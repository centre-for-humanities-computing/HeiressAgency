 Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our debts,  looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary transactions;  and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a way of doing; and I came of  age,—in fulfilment of Herbert's prediction, that I should do so before I knew  where I was. Herbert had come of age eight months before me. As Herbert had nothing else  than Herbert majority to come into, the event did not make a profound sensation in  Barnard's Inn. But our had looked forward to my one-and-twentieth birthday, with  a crowd of speculations and anticipations, for our had both considered that my  guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion. I had taken care to have that occasion well understood in Little Britain when my birthday  was. On the day before that occasion, I received an official note from Wemmick, informing  me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call upon Mr. Jaggers at five in the  afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced our that something great was to  happen, and threw me into an unusual flutter when I repaired to my guardian's  office, a model of punctuality. In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and incidentally  rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissue-paper that I liked  the look of. But his said nothing respecting it, and motioned me with a nod into  my guardian's room. it was November, and my guardian was standing before my guardian  fire leaning my guardian back against the chimney-piece, with my guardian hands under my guardian  coattails. "Well, Pip," said my guardian, "I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations, Mr.  Pip." We shook hands,—he was always a remarkably short shaker,—and I thanked hands,—he. "Take a chair, Mr. Pip," said my guardian. As I sat down, and my guardian preserved my guardian attitude and bent my guardian brows at my guardian boots, I  felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when I had been put  upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from my guardian, and  their expression was as if their were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to  attend to the conversation. "Now my young friend," my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the box, "I  am going to have a word or two with my young friend." "If you please, sir." "What do you suppose," said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the ground,  and then throwing Mr. Jaggers head back to look at the ceiling,—"what do you suppose  you are living at the rate of?" "At the rate of, sir?" "At," repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling, "the—rate—of?"  And then looked all round the room, and paused with sir pocket-handkerchief in  sir hand, half-way to sir nose. I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed any  slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly, I confessed  sir quite unable to answer the question. This reply seemed agreeable to Mr.  Jaggers, who said, "I thought so!" and blew Mr.   with an air of  satisfaction. "Now, I have asked you a question, my friend," said Mr. Jaggers. "Have you  anything to ask me?" "Of course it would be a great relief to sir to ask you several questions, sir;  but I remember your prohibition." "Ask one," said Mr. Jaggers. "Is my benefactor to be made known to sir to-day?" "No. Ask another." "Is that confidence to be imparted to sir soon?" "Waive that, a moment," said Mr. Jaggers, "and ask another." I looked about sir, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the  inquiry, "Have-I—anything to receive, sir?" On that, Mr. Jaggers said,  triumphantly, "I thought we should come to it!" and called to Wemmick to give  Wemmick that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed that piece of paper in, and disappeared. "Now, Mr. Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, "attend, if you please. You have been drawing  pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's cash-book; but  you are in debt, of course?" "I am afraid I must say yes, sir." "You know you must say yes; don't you?" said Mr. Jaggers. "Yes, sir." "I don't ask you what you owe, because you don't know; and if you did know, you  wouldn't tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend," cried Mr. Jaggers,  waving Mr. Jaggers forefinger to stop me as I made a show of protesting: "it's likely  enough that you think you wouldn't, but you would. You'll excuse me, but I know  better than my friend. Now, take that piece of paper in your hand. You have got that piece of paper?  Very good. Now, unfold that piece of paper and tell me what that piece of paper is." "This is a bank-note," said I, "for five hundred pounds." "That is a bank-note," repeated Mr. Jaggers, "for five hundred pounds. And a  very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?" "How could I do otherwise!" "Ah! But answer the question," said Mr. Jaggers. "Undoubtedly." "You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that handsome sum  of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this day, in earnest of  your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum, and  at no higher rate, you are to live until the donor of the whole appears. That  is to say, you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands,  and you will draw from Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter,  until you are in communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the  mere agent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my  instructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but I am  not paid for giving any opinion on them merits." I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great  liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. "I am not  paid, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, coolly, "to carry your words to any one;" and then  gathered up Mr. Jaggers coat-tails, as Mr. Jaggers had gathered up the subject, and stood  frowning at Mr. Jaggers boots as if Mr. Jaggers suspected them of designs against Mr. Jaggers. After a pause, I hinted,— "There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to waive for  a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?" "What is it?" said Mr. Jaggers. I might have known that Mr. Jaggers would never help me out; but it took me aback to  have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new. "Is it likely," I  said, after hesitating, "that my patron, the fountain-head you have spoken of,  Mr. Jaggers, will soon—" there I delicately stopped. "Will soon what?" asked Mr. Jaggers. "That's no question as it stands, you  know." "Will soon come to London," said I, after casting about for a precise form of  words, "or summon me anywhere else?" "Now, here," replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with Mr. Jaggers dark  deep-set eyes, "we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one  another in your village. What did I tell you then, Pip?" "You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person  appeared." "Just so," said Mr. Jaggers, "that's my answer." As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my strong  desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came quicker, and as  I felt that him saw that it came quicker, I felt that I had less chance than  ever of getting anything out of him. "Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?" Mr. Jaggers shook Mr. Jaggers head,—not in negativing the question, but in altogether  negativing the notion that Mr. Jaggers could anyhow be got to answer it,—and the two  horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my eyes strayed up to them,  as if them had come to a crisis in them suspended attention, and were going to  sneeze. "Come!" said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of Mr. Jaggers legs with the backs of Mr. Jaggers  warmed hands, "I'll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That's a question I must  not be asked. You'll understand that better, when I tell you it's a question  that might compromise me. Come! I'll go a little further with you; I'll say  something more." Mr. Jaggers bent down so low to frown at Mr. Jaggers boots, that Mr. Jaggers was able to rub the calves  of Mr. Jaggers legs in the pause Mr. Jaggers made. "When that person discloses," said Mr. Jaggers, straightening that person, "you and  that person will settle your own affairs. When that person discloses, my part  in this business will cease and determine. When that person discloses, that person will  not be necessary for me to know anything about it. And that's all I have got to  say." We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked thoughtfully at  the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion that Miss Havisham, for  some reason or no reason, had not taken him into Miss Havisham confidence as to Miss Havisham  designing me for Estella; that him resented this, and felt a jealousy about this;  or that him really did object to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with  that scheme. When I raised my eyes again, I found that him had been shrewdly looking at  me all the time, and was doing so still. "If that is all you have to say, sir," I remarked, "there can be nothing left  for me to say." him nodded assent, and pulled out him thief-dreaded watch, and asked me where I  was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert. As a necessary  sequence, I asked Herbert if Herbert would favor us with Herbert company, and Herbert promptly  accepted the invitation. But Herbert insisted on walking home with me, in order that  I might make no extra preparation for Herbert, and first Herbert had a letter or two to  write, and (of course) had Herbert hands to wash. So I said I would go into the  outer office and talk to Wemmick. The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket, a  thought had come into my head which had been often there before; and a  thought  appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such  thought. Herbert had already locked up Herbert safe, and made preparations for going home. Herbert had  left Herbert desk, brought out Herbert two greasy office candlesticks and stood his two greasy office candlesticks in  line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to be extinguished; Herbert  had raked Herbert fire low, put Herbert hat and great-coat ready, and was beating  Herbert all over the chest with Herbert safe-key, as an athletic exercise after  business. "Wemmick," said I, "I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous to serve  a friend." Wemmick tightened Wemmick post-office and shook Wemmick head, as if Wemmick opinion were  dead against any fatal weakness of that sort. "my young friend," I pursued, "is trying to get on in commercial life, but has no  money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning. Now I want  somehow to help my young friend to a beginning." "With money down?" said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust. "With some money down," I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of  that symmetrical bundle of papers at home—"with some money down, and perhaps  some anticipation of my expectations." "Mr. Pip," said Wemmick, "I should like just to run over with you on my  fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as Chelsea  Reach. Let's see; there's London, one; Southwark, two; Blackfriars, three;  Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six." He had checked off each  bridge in each  bridge turn, with the handle of He safe-key on the palm of He hand.  "There's as many as six, you see, to choose from." "I don't understand you," said I. "Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip," returned Wemmick, "and take a walk upon your  bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch of your  bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and you may know  the end of it it too,—but it's a less pleasant and profitable end." I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, his made a newspaper so wide after saying  this. "This is very discouraging," said I. "Meant to be so," said Wemmick. "Then is it your opinion," I inquired, with some little indignation, "that a  man should never—" "—Invest portable property in a friend?" said Wemmick. "Certainly Wemmick should  not. Unless Wemmick wants to get rid of the friend,—and then he wants to get rid of the friend,—and becomes a question  how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of Wemmick." "And that," said I, "is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?" "That," Wemmick returned, "is my deliberate opinion in the  outer office." "Ah!" said I, pressing Wemmick, for I thought I saw Wemmick near a loophole here; "but  would that be your opinion at Walworth?" "Mr. Pip," Wemmick replied, with gravity, "Walworth is one place, and the  outer office is  another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is another. They must  not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth;  none but my official sentiments can be taken in the  outer office." "Very well," said I, much relieved, "then I shall look you up at Walworth, you  may depend upon the  outer office." "Mr. Pip," he returned, "you will be welcome there, in a private and personal  capacity." We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian's ears  to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in he doorway, towelling  he hands, Wemmick got on he great-coat and stood by to snuff out the candles.  We all three went into the street together, and from Wemmickturned he way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned We. I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers had had  an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a Somebody, to  unbend Mr. Jaggers brows a little. It was an uncomfortable consideration on a  twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in  such a guarded and suspicious world as Mr. Jaggers made of it. Mr. Jaggers was a thousand times  better informed and cleverer than Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times  rather have had Wemmick to dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely  melancholy, because, after Mr. Jaggers was gone, Herbert said of Herbert, with Herbert eyes  fixed on the fire, that Herbert thought Herbert must have committed a felony and  forgotten the details of it, Herbert felt so dejected and guilty.
