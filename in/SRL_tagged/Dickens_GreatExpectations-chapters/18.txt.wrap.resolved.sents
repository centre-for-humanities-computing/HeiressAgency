 It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and  It was a Saturday  night.
There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three Jolly Bargemen,  attentive to Mr. Wopsle as Mr. Wopsle read the newspaper aloud.
Of a group assembled round the fire at the Three Jolly Bargemen,  attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud I was one.
A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued in blood  to the eyebrows.
Mr. Wopsle gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description,  and identified Mr. Wopsle with every witness at the Inquest.
Mr. Wopsle faintly moaned, "I  am done for," as the victim, and Mr. Wopsle barbarously bellowed, "I'll serve you out,"  as the murderer.
Mr. Wopsle gave the medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our  local practitioner; and Mr. Wopsle piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had  heard blows, to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the  mental competency of that witness.
The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle's hands, became  Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus.
Mr. Wopsle enjoyed Mr. Wopsle thoroughly, and we  all enjoyed we, and were delightfully comfortable.
In this cosey state  of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder.
Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the  back of the settle opposite me, looking on.
There was an expression of contempt  on contempt   face, and contempt   bit the side of a great forefinger as contempt   watched the group  of faces.
"Well!"
said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, "you have  settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?"
Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer.
contempt   looked at  everybody coldly and sarcastically.
"Guilty, of course?"
said contempt  .
"Out with it.
Come!"
"Sir," returned Mr. Wopsle, "without having the honor of your acquaintance, I  do say Guilty."
Upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur.
"I know you do," said the stranger; "I knew you would.
I told you so.
But now  I'll ask you a question.
Do you know, or do you not know, that the law of  England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is proved-proved—to be  guilty?"
"Sir," Mr. Wopsle began to reply, "as an Englishman myself, I—" "Come!"
said the stranger, biting his forefinger at his.
"Don't evade the  question.
Either you know the  question, or you don't know the  question.
Which is it to be?"
his stood with his head on one side and his on one side, in a bullying,  interrogative manner, and his threw his forefinger at Mr. Wopsle,—as his forefinger were  to mark his out—before biting his forefinger again.
"Now!"
said his.
"Do you know it, or don't you know it?"
"Certainly I know it," replied Mr. Wopsle.
"Certainly you know it.
Then why didn't you say so at first?
Now, I'll ask you  another question,"—taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if Mr. Wopsle had a right to  him,—"do you know that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined?"
Mr. Wopsle was beginning, "I can only say—" when the stranger stopped Mr. Wopsle.
"What?
You won't answer the question, yes or no?
Now, I'll try you again."
Throwing Mr. Wopsle finger at Mr. Wopsle again.
"Attend to Mr. Wopsle.
Are you aware, or are you not  aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined?
Come, I only  want one word from you.
Yes, or no?Mr.
Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of Mr. Wopsle.
"Come!"
said the stranger, "I'll help you.
You don't deserve help, but I'll  help you.
Look at that paper you hold in your hand.
What is it?"
"What is it?"
repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.
"Is it," pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner, "the  printed paper you have just been reading from?"
"Undoubtedly."
"Undoubtedly.
Now, turn to that paper you hold in your hand, and tell me whether that paper you hold in your hand distinctly states  that the prisoner expressly said that the prisoner legal advisers instructed the prisoner  altogether to reserve the prisoner defence?"
"I read that just now,Mr.
Wopsle pleaded.
"Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don't ask you what you read just  now.
You may read the Lord's Prayer backwards, if you like,—and, perhaps,  have done the Lord's Prayer before to-day.
Turn to that paper you hold in your hand.
No, no, no my friend; not to the  top of the column; you know better than that; to the bottom, to the bottom."
(We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of subterfuge.)
"Well?
Have you found  it?"
"Here it is," said Mr. Wopsle.
"Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether that passage with your eye distinctly  states that the prisoner expressly said that the prisoner was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence?
Come!
Do you make that of it?"
Mr. Wopsle answered, "Those are not the exact words."
"Not the exact words!"
repeated the gentleman bitterly.
"Is that the exact  substance?"
"Yes," said Mr. Wopsle.
"Yes," repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company with Mr. Wopsle  right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle.
"And now I ask you what you  say to the conscience of that man who, with that passage before his eyes, can  lay his head upon his pillow after having pronounced a fellow-creature guilty,  unheard?"
We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man We all had thought Mr. Wopsle, and  that Mr. Wopsle was beginning to be found out.
"And that same man, remember," pursued the gentleman, throwing that same man finger at  Mr. Wopsle heavily,—"that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this  very trial, and, having thus deeply committed same man, might return to the  bosom of same man family and lay same man upon same man pillow, after deliberately  swearing that same man would well and truly try the issue joined between Our  Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict  give according to the evidence, so help same man God!"
Our were all deeply persuaded that Mr. Wopsle Mr. Wopsle had gone too far, and  had better stop in Mr. Wopsle reckless career while there was yet time.
The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and with a  manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of Our that would  effectually do for each individual if Mr. Wopsle chose to disclose it, left the back of  the settle, and came into the space between the two settles, in front of the  fire, where Mr. Wopsle remained standing, Mr. Wopsle left hand in Mr. Wopsle pocket, and Mr. Wopsle biting  the forefinger of Mr. Wopsle right.
"From information I have received," said Mr. Wopsle, looking round at Our as we all  quailed before Mr. Wopsle, "I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you,  by name Joseph—or Joe—Gargery.
Which is the man?"
"Here is the man," said the man.
The strange gentleman beckoned the man out of The strange gentleman place, and the man went.
"You have an apprentice," pursued the stranger, "commonly known as Pip?
Is he  here?"
"I am here!"
I cried.
the stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized he as the gentleman I had  met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss Havisham.
I had  known he the moment I saw he looking over the settle, and now that I stood  confronting he with he upon my shoulder, I checked off again in detail  he large head, he dark complexion, he deep-set eyes, he bushy black  eyebrows, he large watch-chain, he strong black dots of beard and whisker,  and even the smell of scented soap on he great hand.
"I wish to have a private conference with you two," said he, when he had  surveyed me at he leisure.
"It will take a little time.
Perhaps we had better  go to your place of residence.
I prefer not to anticipate my communication  here; you will impart as much or as little of my communication   as you please to your friends  afterwards; I have nothing to do with that."
Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen, and in a  wondering silence walked home.
While going along, the strange gentleman  occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of the strange gentleman   finger.
As we  neared home, the strange gentleman   vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and  ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door.
we conference was held  in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by one candle.
Our conference began with the strange gentleman's sitting down at the table, drawing one candle to the strange gentleman  , and looking over some entries in the strange gentleman   pocket-book.
the strange gentleman   then put up  his pocket-book and set one candle a little aside, after peering round his pocket-book into  the darkness at the strange gentleman   and me, to ascertain which was which.
"My name," the strange gentleman   said, "is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London.
I am pretty well  known.
I have unusual business to transact with you, and I commence by  explaining that it is not of my originating.
If my advice had been asked, I  should not have been here.
It was not asked, and you see me here.
What I have  to do as the confidential agent of another, I do.
No less, no more."
Finding that the strange gentleman   could not see us very well from where the strange gentleman   sat, the strange gentleman   got up, and  threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon the back of a chair; thus having one foot  on the seat of a chair, and one foot on the ground.
"Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young  fellow your apprentice.
You would not object to cancel this young   indentures at this young    request and for this young   good?
You would want nothing for so doing?"
"Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip's way," said  the strange gentleman  , staring.
"Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose," returned Jaggers.
"The  question is, Would you want anything?
Do you want anything?"
"The answer is," returned the strange gentleman  , sternly, "No."
I thought Jaggers glanced at the strange gentleman  , as if Jaggers considered Jaggers a fool for Jaggers  disinterestedness.
But I was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity  and surprise, to be sure of it.
"Very well," said Jaggers.
"Recollect the admission you have made, and  don't try to go from the admission you have made presently."
"Who's a going to try?"
retorted the strange gentleman  .
"I don't say anybody is.
Do you keep a dog?"
"Yes, I do keep a dog."
"Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.
Bear  that in mind, will you?"
repeated Jaggers, shutting Jaggers eyes and nodding  Jaggers head at the strange gentleman  , as if Jaggers were forgiving Jaggers something.
"Now, I return to this  young fellow.
And the communication I have got to make is, that this  young fellow has Great  Expectations."
the man and I gasped, and looked at one another.
"I am instructed to communicate to the man," said Jaggers, throwing Jaggers finger  at Jaggers sideways, "that Jaggers will come into a handsome property.
Further, that it  is the desire of the present possessor of a handsome property, that Jaggers be immediately  removed from Jaggers present sphere of life and from this place, and be brought up  as a gentleman,—in a word, as a young fellow of great expectations."
My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss Havisham  was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.
"Now, Mr. Pip," pursued the lawyer, "I address the rest of what I have to say,  to you.
You are to understand, first, that it is the request of the person from  whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of Pip.
You will have  no objection, I dare say, to your great expectations being encumbered with that  easy condition.
But if you have any objection, this is the time to mention it."
My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears, that I  could scarcely stammer I had no objection.
"I should think not!
Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that the  name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret,  until the person chooses to reveal it.
I am empowered to mention that it is the  intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to  yourself.
When or where that intention may be carried out, I cannot say; no one  can say.
that intention may be years hence.
Now, you are distinctly to understand that you  are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any  allusion or reference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as the  individual, in all the communications you may have with me.
If you have a  suspicion in your own breast, keep a  suspicion in your own breast in your own breast.
It is not  the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are; this prohibition may be  the strongest and gravest reasons, or this prohibition may be mere whim.
This is not for  you to inquire into.
The condition is laid down.
Your acceptance of The condition, and  your observance of The condition as binding, is the only remaining condition that I am  charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions, and for whom I am  not otherwise responsible.
That person is the person from whom you derive your  expectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.
Again,  not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune;  but if you have any objection to it, this is the time to mention it.
Speak out."
Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.
"I should think not!
Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations."
Though he  called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he still could not get  rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now he occasionally shut  he and threw he finger at me while he spoke, as much as to express that  he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement, if he only chose to mention  all kinds of things.
"We come next, to mere details of arrangement.
You must know that,  although I have used the term 'expectations' more than once, you are not  endowed with expectations only.
There is already lodged in my hands a sum of  money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance.
You will  please consider me your guardian.
Oh!"
for I was going to thank me your guardian, "I tell  you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn't render my services.
my services is  considered that you must be better educated, in accordance with your altered  position, and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once  entering on that advantage."
I said I had always longed for it.
"Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip," Mr. Pip retorted; "keep to  the record.
If you long for it now, that's enough.
Am I answered that you are  ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor?
Is that it?"
I stammered yes, that was it.
"Good.
Now, your inclinations are to be consulted.
I don't think that wise,  mind, but it's my trust.
Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer  to another?"
I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt; so, I  replied in the negative.
"There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think might  suit the purpose," said Jaggers.
"I don't recommend Jaggers, observe; because I  never recommend anybody.
The gentleman I speak of is one Mr. Matthew Pocket."
Ah!
I caught at the name directly.
Miss Havisham's relation.
The Matthew whom  Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of.
The Matthew whose place was to be at Miss  Havisham's head, when she lay dead, in she bride's dress on her bride's table.
"You know the name?"
said Jaggers, looking shrewdly at Jaggers, and then  shutting up his eyes while Jaggers waited for my answer.
my answer was, that I had heard of the name.
"Oh!"
said Jaggers.
"You have heard of the name.
But the question is, what do you  say of the question?"
I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to Jaggers for Jaggers  recommendation— "No, my young friend!"
Jaggers interrupted, shaking Jaggers great head very slowly.
"Recollect yourself!"
Not recollecting Jaggers, I began again that I was much obliged to Jaggers for Jaggers  recommendation— "No, my young friend," Jaggers interrupted, shaking Jaggers head and frowning and  smiling both at once,—"no, no, no; it's very well done, but it won't do; you  are too young to fix me with it.
Recommendation is not the word, Mr. Pip.
Try  another."
Correcting Jaggers, I said that I was much obliged to Jaggers for Jaggers mention of Mr.  Matthew Pocket— "That's more like it!"
cried Mr. Jaggers.—And (I added), I would gladly try  the strange gentleman  .
"Good.
You had better try Jaggers in Jaggers own house.
The way shall be prepared for  you, and you can see Jaggers son first, who is in London.
When will you come to LondonLondon?"
I said (glancing at the strange gentleman  , who stood looking on, motionless), that I supposed I  could come directly.
"First," said Jaggers, "you should have some new clothes to come in, and  some new clothes to come in should not be working-clothes.
Say this day week.
You'll want some money.
Shall I leave you twenty guineas?"
twenty guineas produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted twenty guineas out on  the table and pushed twenty guineas over to me.
This was the first time twenty guineas had taken twenty guineas  leg from a chair.
twenty guineas sat astride of a chair when twenty guineas had pushed some moneyover, and sat swinging a long purse and eyeing the man.
"Well, Joseph Gargery?
You look dumbfoundered?"
"I am!"
said the man, in a very decided manner.
"It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?"
"It were understood," said the man.
"And It are understood.
And It ever will be  similar according."
"But what," said Jaggers, swinging Jaggers purse,—"what if his purse,—"what was in my  instructions to make you a present, as compensation?"
"As compensation what for?"
the man demanded.
"For the loss of the man services."
the man laid the man hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman.
I have often  thought the man since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or pat an  egg-shell, in the man combination of strength with gentleness.
"Pip is that hearty  welcome," said the man, "to go free with his services, to honor and fortun', as no  words can tell the man.
But if you think as Money can make compensation to me for  the loss of the little child—what come to the forge—and ever the best of  friends!—" O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I see you  again, with your muscular blacksmith's arm before your eyes, and your broad  chest heaving, and your voice dying away.
O dear good faithful tender the man, I  feel the loving tremble of his hand upon your muscular blacksmith's arm before your eyes, as solemnly this day as if your muscular blacksmith's arm before your eyes  had been the rustle of an angel's wing!
But I encouraged the man at the time.
I was lost in the mazes of my future  fortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together.
I begged  the man to be comforted, for (as the man said) we had ever been the best of friends, and  (as I said) we ever would be so.
the man scooped his eyes with the man disengaged  wrist, as if the man were bent on gouging the man, but said not another word.
Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in the man the village  idiot, and in Jaggers Jaggers keeper.
When it was over, Jaggers said, weighing in Jaggers hand  the purse Jaggers had ceased to swing:— "Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance.
No half measures  with Jaggers.
If you mean to take a present that I have a present in charge to make you,  speak out, and you shall have a present.
If on the contrary you mean to say—" Here,  to his great amazement, his was stopped by the man's suddenly working round his with  every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose.
"Which I meantersay," cried the man, "that if you come into my place bull-baiting  and badgering me, come out!
Which I meantersay as sech if you're a man, come  on!
Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay and stand or fall by!"
I drew the man away, and the man immediately became placable; merely stating to Jaggers, in  an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it  might happen to concern, that the man were not a going to be bull-baited and  badgered in the man own place.
Jaggers had risen when the man demonstrated, and had  backed near the door.
Without evincing any inclination to come in again, Jaggers  there delivered Jaggers valedictory remarks.
They were evincing any inclination to come in again.
"Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here—as you are to be a  gentleman—the better.
Let it stand for this day week, and you shall receive  my printed address in the meantime.
You can take a hackney-coach at the  stage-coach office in London, and come straight to me.
Understand, that I  express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust I undertake.
I am paid for  undertaking it, and I do so.
Now, understand that, finally.
Understand that!"
He was throwing He finger at both of us, and I think would have gone on, but  for He seeming to think the man dangerous, and going off.
Something came into my head which induced me to run after He, as He was going  down to the Jolly Bargemen, where He had left a hired carriage.
"I beg your pardon, Mr.
Jaggers."
"Halloa!"
said "Halloa, facing round, "what's the matter?"
"I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions; so I  thought I had better ask.
Would there be any objection to my taking leave of  any one I know, about here, before I go away?"
"No," said "Halloa, looking as if "Halloa hardly understood me.
"I don't mean in the village only, but up town?"
"No," said "Halloa.
"No objection."
I thanked "Halloa and ran home again, and there I found that the man had already locked  the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated by the kitchen fire  with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the burning coals.
I too sat down  before the kitchen fire   and gazed at the burning coals, and nothing was said for a long time.
My sister was in My sister cushioned chair in My sister corner, and Biddy sat at My sister  needle-work before the kitchen fire  , and the man sat next Biddy, and I sat the man the man in the  corner opposite My sister.
The more I looked into the burning coals, The more  incapable I became of looking at the man; The longer the silence lasted, The more  unable I felt to speak.
At length I got out, the manthe man, have you told next Biddy?"
"No, Pip," returned the man, still looking at the kitchen fire  , and holding the man knees  tight, as if the man had private information that they intended to make off  somewhere, "which I left it to yourself, Pip."
"I would rather you told, the man."
"Pip's a gentleman of fortun' then," said the man, "and God bless the man in it!"
Biddy dropped her  needle-work, and looked at me.
the man held his knees   and looked at me.
I looked at both of them.
After a pause, them both heartily congratulated me;  but there was a certain touch of sadness in they both congratulations that I rather  resented.
I took it upon me to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, the man) with the grave  obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say nothing about  the maker of my fortune.
It would all come out in good time, I observed, and in  the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save that I had come into great  expectations from a mysterious patron.
Biddy nodded Biddy thoughtfully at  the kitchen fire   as Biddy took up her  needle-work again, and said Biddy would be very particular;  and the man, still detaining his knees  , said, "Ay, ay, I'll be ekervally  partickler, Pip;" and then they congratulated me again, and went on to express  so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that I didn't half like it.
Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to My sister some idea of  what had happened.
To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely failed.
My sister  laughed and nodded My sister a great many times, and even repeated after Biddy,  the words "Pip" and "Property."
But I doubt if they had more meaning in they  than an election cry, and I cannot suggest a darker picture of My sister state of  mind.
I never could have believed it without experience, but as the man and Biddy became  more at Joe and Biddy cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.
Dissatisfied with my  fortune, of course I could not be; but it is possible that I may have been,  without quite knowing it, dissatisfied with myself.
Any how, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand, looking into  the kitchen fire  , as those two talked about my going away, and about what they should  do without myself, and all that.
And whenever I caught one of they looking at myself,  though never so pleasantly (and they often looked at Biddy),  I felt offended: as if they were expressing some mistrust of myself.
Though Heaven  knows they never did by word or sign.
At those times I would get up and look out at the front door; for our kitchen door  opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to air the  room.
The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid I took to be  but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which I  had passed my life.
"Saturday night," said I, when our sat at our supper of bread and cheese and  beer.
"Five more days, and then the day before the day!
They'll soon go."
"Yes, Pip," observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.
"They'll  soon go."
"Soon, soon go," said Biddy.
"I have been thinking, the man, that when I go down town on Monday, and order my  new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I'll come and put my  new clothes on there, or  that I'll have my  new clothes sent to Mr. Pumblechook's.
It would be very disagreeable to  be stared at by all the people here."
"Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure too,  Pip," said the man, industriously cutting the man bread, with the man cheese on his bread, in the  palm of the man left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper as if the man thought of  the time when we used to compare slices.
"So might Wopsle.
And the Jolly  Bargemen might take Wopsle as a compliment."
"That's just what I don't want, the man.
They would make such a business of  it,—such a coarse and common business,—that I couldn't bear the man."
"Ah, that indeed, Pip!"
said the man.
"If you couldn't abear yourself—" Biddy asked me here, as Biddy sat holding My sister's plate, "Have you thought  about when you'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister and me?
You  will show yourself to us; won't you?"
"Biddy," I returned with some resentment, "you are so exceedingly quick that  it's difficult to keep up with Biddy."
("She always were quick," observed the man.)
"If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say that I  shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,—most likely on the  evening before I go away."
Biddy said no more.
Handsomely forgiving Biddy, I soon exchanged an affectionate  good night with Biddy and the man, and went up to bed.
When I got into the  room, I sat down and took a long look at the  room, as a mean little room that I  should soon be parted from and raised above, for ever.
the  room was furnished with  fresh young remembrances too, and even at the same moment I fell into much the  same confused division of mind between the  room and the better rooms to which I was  going, as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and  Biddy and Estella.
The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and the room  was warm.
As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw the man come slowly  forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two in the air; and then I  saw Biddy come, and bring the man a pipe and light a pipe for the man.
the man never smoked so  late, and it seemed to hint to me that the man wanted comforting, for some reason or  other.
the man presently stood at the dark door immediately beneath me, smoking a pipe, and  Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to the man, and I knew that they talked of  me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of they more  than once.
I would not have listened for more, if I could have heard more; so I  drew away from the window, and sat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling  it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes  should be the loneliest I had ever known.
Looking towards the window, I saw light wreaths from the man's pipe floating  there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,—not obtruded on me or  paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared together.
I put my light  out, and crept into bed; and my light   was an uneasy bed now, and I never slept the  old sound sleep in my light   any more.
