 Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, I  devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the Castle.
On  arriving before the battlements, I found the Union Jack flying and the  drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance, I rang  at the gate, and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the Aged.
"My son, sir," said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, "rather had it  in the old man mind that you might happen to drop in, and the old man left word that the old man would  soon be home from the old man afternoon's walk.
the old man is very regular in the old man walks, is my  son.
Very regular in everything, is my  son."
I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and we went  in and sat down by the fireside.
"You made acquaintance with My son, sir," said the old man, in acquaintance chirping  way, while acquaintance warmed acquaintance hands at the blaze, "at acquaintance office, I expect?"
I  nodded.
"Hah!
I have heerd that my  son is a wonderful hand at my  son business,  sir?"
I nodded hard.
"Yes; so my son is a wonderful hand at his business,  sir tell me.
his business is the Law?"
I nodded  harder.
"Which makes it more surprising in my  son," said the old man, "for my  son  was not brought up to the Law, but to the Wine-Coopering."
Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation  of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at the old gentleman.
the old gentleman threw me into the greatest  confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner, "No, to  be sure; you're right."
And to this hour I have not the faintest notion what the old gentleman  meant, or what joke the old gentleman thought I had made.
As I could not sit there nodding at the old gentleman perpetually, without making some other  attempt to interest the old gentleman, I shouted at inquiry whether the old gentleman own calling in life  had been "the Wine-Coopering."
By dint of straining that term out of myself  several times and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate the chest with  him, I at last succeeded in making my meaning understood.
"No," said the old gentleman; "the warehousing, the warehousing.
First, over  yonder;" the old gentleman appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe the old gentleman intended to refer  me to Liverpool; "and then in the City of London here.
However, having an  infirmity—for I am hard of hearing, sir—" I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.
"—Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon myself, my son my son went  into the Law, and my son took charge of myself, and my son by little and little made out  this elegant and beautiful property.
But returning to what you said, you know,"  pursued the old man, again laughing heartily, "what I say is, No to be sure;  you're right."
I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to  say anything that would have amused the old gentleman half as much as this imaginary  pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of  the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with "JOHN"  upon it.
the old man, following my eyes, cried with great triumph, "My son's  come home!"
and we both went out to the drawbridge.
It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to myself from the other side  of the moat, when we both might have shaken hands across a salute with the greatest ease.
The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge, that I made no offer to  assist The Aged, but stood quiet until Wemmick had come across, and had presented me  to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom The Aged was accompanied.
Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like Miss Skiffins escort, in the  post-office branch of the service.
Miss Skiffins might have been some two or three years  younger than Wemmick, and I judged Miss Skiffins to stand possessed of portable property.
The cut of Miss Skiffins dress from the waist upward, both before and behind, made Miss Skiffins  figure very like a boy's kite; and I might have pronounced Miss Skiffins gown a little  too decidedly orange, and Miss Skiffins gloves a little too intensely green.
But Miss Skiffins  seemed to be a good sort of fellow, and showed a high regard for The Aged.
I  was not long in discovering that Miss Skiffins was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for,  on our going in, and my complimenting Wemmick on Wemmick ingenious contrivance for  announcing Wemmick to The Aged, Wemmick begged me to give my attention for a moment  to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared.
Presently another click  came, and another little door tumbled open with "Miss Skiffins" on it; then  Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then Miss Skiffins and John both  tumbled open together, and finally shut up together.
On Wemmick's return from  working these mechanical appliances, I expressed the great admiration with  which I regarded these mechanical appliances, and John said, "Well, you know, these mechanical appliances're both pleasant and  useful to The Aged.
And by George, sir, it's a thing worth mentioning, that of  all the people who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known  to the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!"
"And Wemmick made them," added Miss Skiffins, "with Wemmick own hands out of  Wemmick own head."
While Miss Skiffins was taking off Miss Skiffins bonnet (Miss Skiffins retained Miss Skiffins green gloves  during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company),  Wemmick invited me to take a walk with Wemmick round the property, and see how the  island looked in wintertime.
Thinking that Wemmick did this to give me an  opportunity of taking Wemmick Walworth sentiments, I seized the opportunity as soon  as we were out of the Castle.
Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I had  never hinted at my subject before.
I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in behalf of  Herbert Pocket, and I told  Herbert Pocket how we had first met, and how we had fought.
I  glanced at Herbert's home, and at Herbert character, and at Herbert having no means but  such as Herbert was dependent on Herbert father for; those, uncertain and unpunctual.
I  alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from  Herbert society, and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from  his society, and that  Herbert might have done better without me and my expectations.
Keeping Miss Havisham  in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility of my  having competed with Herbert in Herbert prospects, and at the certainty of Herbert  possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts,  retaliations, or designs.
For all these reasons (I told Wemmick), and because  Herbert was my young companion and friend, and I had a great affection for Herbert, I  wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon Herbert, and therefore I  sought advice from Wemmick's experience and knowledge of men and affairs, how I  could best try with my resources to help Herbert to some present income,—say  of a hundred a year, to keep Herbert in good hope and heart,—and gradually to buy  Herbert on to some small partnership.
I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to  understand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert's knowledge or  suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could  advise.
I wound up by laying my hand upon Herbert shoulder, and saying, "I can't  help confiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that is  your fault, in having ever brought me here."
Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of start,  "Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing.
This is devilish good of  you."
"Say you'll help me to be good then," said I.
"Ecod," replied Wemmick, shaking I.
"Ecod head, "that's not my trade."
"Nor is this your trading-place," said I.
"You are right," I.
"Ecod returned.
"You hit the nail on his head.
Mr. Pip, I'll put  on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be done by degrees.
Skiffins (that's her brother) is an accountant and agent.
I'll look Skiffins (that's her brother) up and  go to work for you."
"I thank you ten thousand times."
"On the contrary," said Skiffins (that's her brother), "I thank you, for though we are strictly in we  private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there are Newgate  cobwebs about, and it brushes them away."
After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into the  Castle where we found Skiffins (that's her brother) preparing tea.
The responsible duty of  making the toast was delegated to The Aged, and that excellent old gentleman  was so intent upon it that excellent old gentleman   seemed to me in some danger of melting excellent old gentleman   eyes.
It was no nominal meal that we were going to make, but a vigorous reality.
The  Aged prepared such a hay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see The    over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises became  strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed The   desire to participate in the  entertainment.
The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right moment of  time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth as if the moat  were thirty feet wide by as many deep.
Nothing disturbed the tranquillity of  the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of John and Miss Skiffins: which  little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me  sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used to it.
I inferred from the  methodical nature of Miss Skiffins's arrangements that she made tea there every  Sunday night; and I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore,  representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and  a very new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given she by  Wemmick.
We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was  delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it.
The Aged especially,  might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe, just oiled.
After  a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins—in the absence of the little servant  who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of Miss Skiffins— family on Sunday  afternoons—washed up the tea-things, in a trifling lady-like amateur manner  that compromised none of We.
Then, Miss Skiffins— put on Miss Skiffins— gloves again, and We drew  round the fire, and Wemmick said, "Now, Aged Parent, tip We the paper."
Wemmick explained to me while The Aged got Wemmick spectacles out, that this was  according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction  to read the news aloud.
"I won't offer an apology," said Wemmick, "for Wemmick isn't  capable of many pleasures—are you, Aged P.?"
"All right, John, all right," returned the old man, seeing John spoken to.
"Only tip John a nod every now and then when John looks off the paper," said  Wemmick, "and John'll be as happy as a king.
We are all attention, Aged One."
"All right, John, all right!"
returned the old man, so busy and so  pleased, that it really was quite charming.
The Aged's reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's,  with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole.
As he  wanted the candles close to he, and as he was always on the verge of putting  either he head or the newspaper into them, he required as much watching as a  powder-mill.
But Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in he vigilance, and  The Aged read on, quite unconscious of he many rescues.
Whenever he looked at  us, we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he  resumed again.
As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy  corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Wemmick's mouth,  powerfully suggestive of he slowly and gradually stealing he arm round Miss  Skiffins's waist.
In course of time I saw he hand appear on the other side of  Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped he with the  green glove, unwound his arm again as if his arm were an article of dress, and with  the greatest deliberation laid his arm on the table before Miss Skiffins.
Miss Skiffinscomposure while Miss Skiffins did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever  seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind,  I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.
By and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and gradually  fading out of view.
Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to widen again.
After  an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost  painful, I saw his appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins.
Instantly,  Miss Skiffins stopped his hand with the neatness of a placid boxer, took off that  girdle or cestus as before, and laid his hand on the table.
Taking the table to  represent the path of virtue, I am justified in stating that during the whole  time of The Aged's reading, Wemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue  and being recalled to Wemmick's arm by Miss Skiffins.
At last, The Aged read The Aged into a light slumber.
This was the time for  Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black bottle with  a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and  social aspect.
With the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to  drink, including the Aged, who was soon awake again.
Miss Skiffins mixed, and I  observed that Miss Skiffins and Wemmick drank out of one glass.
Of course I knew better  than to offer to see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought  I had best go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of The Aged, and  having passed a pleasant evening.
Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth, stating  that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our  private and personal capacities, and that he would be glad if I could come and  see he again upon it.
So, I went out to Walworth again, and yet again, and yet  again, and I saw he by appointment in the City several times, but never held  any communication with he on the subject in or near Little Britain.
The upshot  was, that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long  established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted capital,  and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner.
Between he and  me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the subject, and I paid  Herbert half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged for sundry other payments:  some, to fall due at certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my  coming into my property.
Miss Skiffins's brother conducted the negotiation.
Wemmick pervaded Wemmick throughout, but never appeared in Wemmick.
The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the least  suspicion of my hand being in Wemmick.
I never shall forget the radiant face with  which Herbert came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty piece of news, of  Herbert having fallen in with one Clarriker (the young merchant's name), and of  Clarriker's having shown an extraordinary inclination towards Herbert, and of Herbert  belief that the opening had come at last.
Day by day as Herbert hopes grew stronger  and Herbert face brighter, Herbert must have thought me a more and more affectionate  friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph  when I saw Herbert so happy.
At length, the thing being done, and Herbert having that  day entered Clarriker's House, and Herbert having talked to me for a whole evening  in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when I  went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody.
A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my view.
But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all the changes it  involved, I must give one chapter to Estella.
It is not much to give to the  theme that so long filled my heart.
