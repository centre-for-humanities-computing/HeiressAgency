 My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in the  morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less severely,  as high as the shoulder; My left arm was very painful, but the flames had set in that  direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My right hand was not so badly  burnt but that I could move the fingers. My right hand was bandaged, of course, but much  less inconveniently than my left hand and arm; those I carried in a sling; and  I could only wear my coat like a cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at  the neck. My hair had been caught by the fire, but not my head or face. When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen Herbert father, Herbert came back to  me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on Herbert. Herbert was the kindest  of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages, and steeped the bandages in the  cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put the bandages on again, with a patient  tenderness that I was deeply grateful for. At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I might  say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames, their  hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I dozed for a minute, I was  awakened by Miss Havisham's cries, and by her running at Herbert with all that  height of fire above her head. This pain of the mind was much harder to strive  against than any bodily pain I suffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did Herbert  utmost to hold my attention engaged. Neither of our spoke of the boat, but we both thought of the boat. That was made  apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our agreeing—without  agreement—to make my recovery of the use of my hands a question of so many  hours, not of so many weeks. My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all was well  down the river? As Herbert replied in the affirmative, with perfect confidence and  cheerfulness, our did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away. But  then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more by the light of the fire than by  the outer light, Herbert went back to it spontaneously. "I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours." "Where was Clara?" "Dear little thing!" said Herbert. "Clara was up and down with Gruffandgrim all  the evening. Herbert was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment Clara left Herbert  sight. I doubt if Herbert can hold out long, though. What with rum and pepper,—and  pepper and rum,—I should think Herbert pegging must be nearly over." "And then you will be married, Herbert?" "How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?—Lay your arm out upon the  back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I'll sit down here, and get the bandage off  so gradually that you shall not know when the bandage comes. I was speaking of Provis.  Do you know, Handel, Handel improves?" "I said to Handel I thought Handel was softened when I last saw Handel." "So you did. And so Handel is. Handel was very communicative last night, and told me  more of Handel life. You remember Handel breaking off here about some woman that Handel  had had great trouble with.—Did I hurt you?" I had started, but not under Handel touch. Handel words had given me a start. "I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it." "Well! Handel went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is. Shall I  tell you? Or would it worry you just now?" "Tell me by all means. Every word." Herbert bent forward to look at Herbert more nearly, as if my reply had been rather  more hurried or more eager than Herbert could quite account for. "Your head is  cool?" Herbert said, touching it. "Quite," said I. "Tell me what Provis said, Herbert." "It seems," said Herbert, "—there's a bandage off most charmingly, and now  comes the cool one,—makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow, don't it?  but it will be comfortable presently,—it seems that the woman was a young  woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman; revengeful, Handel, to the  last degree." "To what last degree?" "Murder.—Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?" "I don't feel it. How did the woman murder? Whom did the woman murder?" "Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name," said Herbert,  "but, the woman was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended the woman, and the reputation of  that defence first made Mr. Jaggers name known to Provis. It was another and a stronger  woman who was the victim, and there had been a struggle—in a barn. Who began  it, or how fair it was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended is  certainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled." "Was the woman brought in guilty?" "No; the woman was acquitted.—My poor Handel, I hurt you!" "It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?" "This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little child of  whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very night when the  object of the woman jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the woman presented  the woman before Provis for one moment, and swore that the woman would destroy the  child (which was in the woman possession), and the  child (which was in her possession) should never see the  child (which was in her possession) again; then the woman  vanished.—There's the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more, and now  there remains but the right hand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better  by this light than by a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don't see the  poor blistered patches too distinctly.—You don't think your breathing is  affected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly." "Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep the woman oath?" "There comes the darkest part of Provis's life. the woman did." "That is, Herbert says the woman did." "Why, of course, my dear boy," returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise, and  again bending forward to get a nearer look at Herbert. "Herbert says it all. I have no  other information." "No, to be sure." "Now, whether," pursued Herbert, "Herbert had used the child's mother ill, or  whether Herbert had used the child's mother well, Provis doesn't say; but the child's mother had  shared some four or five years of the wretched life Herbert described to us at this  fireside, and Herbert seems to have felt pity for the child's mother, and forbearance towards the child's mother.  Therefore, fearing Herbert should be called upon to depose about this destroyed  child, and so be the cause of the child's mother death, Herbert hid Herbert (much as Herbert grieved for  the child), kept Herbert dark, as Herbert says, out of the way and out of the trial,  and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the  jealousy arose. After the acquittal the child's mother disappeared, and thus Herbert lost the child  and the child's mother." "I want to ask—" "A moment, my dear boy, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson, the worst  of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keeping out of the way at  that time and of his reasons for doing so, of course afterwards held the  knowledge over his head as a means of keeping his poorer and working his  harder. It was clear last night that this barbed the point of Provis's  animosity." "I want to know," said I, "and particularly, Herbert, whether Herbert told you when  this happened?" "Particularly? Let me remember, then, what Herbert said as to that. Herbert expression  was, 'a round score o' year ago, and a'most directly after I took up wi'  Compeyson.' How old were you when you came upon Herbert in the little churchyard?" "I think in my seventh year." "Ay. It had happened some three or four years then, Herbert said, and you brought  into Herbert mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would have been about  your age." "Herbert," said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, "can you see me  best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?" "By the firelight," answered Herbert, coming close again. "Look at Herbert." "I do look at you, my dear boy." "Touch me." "I do touch you, my dear boy." "You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much disordered  by the accident of last night?" "N-no, my dear boy," said Herbert, after taking time to examine me. "You are  rather excited, but you are quite yourself." "I know I am quite Herbert. And the man we have in hiding down the river, is  Estella's Father."
