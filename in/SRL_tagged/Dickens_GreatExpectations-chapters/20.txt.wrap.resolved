 The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hours.  It was a little past midday when Mr. Jaggers, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys, Wood  Street, Cheapside, London. We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to  doubt We having and We being the best of everything: otherwise, while I was  scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have had some faint doubts  whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and dirty. Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me Mr. Jaggers address; his address was, Little Britain, and Mr. Jaggers had  written after his address on Mr. Jaggers card, "just out of Smithfield, and close by the  coach-office." Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have as many  capes to Mr. Jaggers greasy great-coat as Mr. Jaggers was years old, packed me up in Mr. Jaggers coach  and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps, as if Mr. Jaggers were  going to take me fifty miles. Mr. Jaggers getting on Mr. Jaggers box, which I remember to have  been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten  into rags, was quite a work of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six  great coronets outside, and ragged things behind for I don't know how many  footmen to hold on by, and a harrow below a wonderful equipage, with six  great coronets outside, to prevent amateur footmen from  yielding to the temptation. I had scarcely had time to enjoy his coach   and to think how like a straw-yard  it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the horses' nose-bags  were kept inside, when I observed the coachman beginning to get down, as if we  were going to stop presently. And stop we presently did, in a gloomy street, at  certain offices with an open door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS. "How much?" I asked the coachman beginning to get down. the coachman beginning to get down answered, "A shilling—unless you wish to make it more." I naturally said I had no wish to make it more. "Then it must be a shilling," observed the coachman beginning to get down. "I don't want to get into  trouble. I know MR!" MR darkly closed an eye at JAGGERS's name, and shook  MR head. When MR had got MR shilling, and had in course of time completed the ascent to  MR box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve MR mind), I went into the  front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers  at home? "Mr. Jaggers   is not," returned the clerk. "Mr. Jaggers   is in Court at present. Am I addressing  Mr. Pip?" I signified that Mr. Jaggers   was addressing Mr. Pip. "Mr. Jaggers   left word, would you wait in Mr. Jaggers   room. Mr. Jaggers   couldn't say how long Mr. Jaggers    might be, having a case on. But a case on stands to reason, Mr. Jaggers   time being valuable,  that Mr. Jaggers   won't be longer than Mr. Jaggers   can help." With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner chamber  at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a velveteen suit and  knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the  perusal of the newspaper. "Go and wait outside, Mike," said the clerk. I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk shoved this  gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used, and tossing the clerk fur  cap out after the clerk, left me alone. his room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal place;  the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the distorted  adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted they to peep down at me  through his room. There were not so many papers about, as I should have expected to  see; and there were some odd objects about, that I should not have expected to  see,—such as an old rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several  strange-looking boxes and packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces  peculiarly swollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers  's own high-backed  chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed  chair, like a  coffin; and I fancied I could see how Mr. Jaggers   leaned back in Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed  chair, and bit Mr. Jaggers    forefinger at the clients. his room was but small, and the clients seemed to  have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the wall, especially opposite  to Mr. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that the  one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent  cause of the  one-eyed gentleman being turned out. I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's chair, and  became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I called to mind that  the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else's  disadvantage, as the clerk master had. I wondered how many other clerks there were  up-stairs, and whether how many other clerks claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of  how many other clerks fellow-creatures. I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter  about his room, and how the history of all the odd litter  about the room came there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces  were of Mr. Jaggers's family, and, if Mr. Jaggers were so unfortunate as to have had a  pair of such ill-looking relations, why Mr. Jaggers stuck them on that dusty perch for  the blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home. Of  course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may have been  oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit that lay thick on  everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr. Jaggers's close room, until  I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair,  and got up and went out. When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited, the clerk  advised me to go round the corner and I should come into Smithfield. So I came  into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all asmear with filth and fat  and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me. So, I rubbed it off with all  possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of  Saint Paul's bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander  said was Newgate Prison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway  covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and  from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and  beer, I inferred that the trials were on. While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister  of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial or so:  informing me that an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister  of justice could give me a front place for half a crown, whence I  should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister  of justice wig and  robes,—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and presently offering  an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister  of justice at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I declined the proposal on the  plea of an appointment, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister  of justice was so good as to take me into a yard and show me  where the gallows was kept, and also where people were publicly whipped, and  then an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister  of justice showed me the Debtors' Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged;  heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand  that "four on 'em" would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight  in the morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a  sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor  wore (from the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor   hat down to the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor   boots and up again to the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor   pocket-handkerchief  inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor   originally,  and which I took it into my head the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor   had bought cheap of the executioner. Under  these circumstances I thought the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor   well rid of the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor   for a shilling. I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I found Mr. Jaggers  had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour of Little  Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became aware that other  people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as I. There were two men of  secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close, and thoughtfully fitting two men of  secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Closefeet into the cracks of the pavement as two men of  secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close talked together, one of whom said  to the other when two men of  secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close first passed me, that "Jaggers would do it if it was to  be done." There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and  one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted her by  saying, as her pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, "Jaggers is for him,  'Melia, and what more could you have?" There was a red-eyed little Jew who came  into the Close while I was loitering there, in company with a second little Jew  whom Jew   sent upon an errand; and while the messenger was gone, I remarked a red-eyed little Jew who came  into the Close while I was loitering there, in company with a second little Jew  whom he sent upon an errandJew  ! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth, give me  Jaggerth!" These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep  impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever. At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into  Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers   coming across the road towards Mr. Jaggers  . All the  others who were waiting saw Mr. Jaggers   at the same time, and there was quite a rush at  Mr. Jaggers  . Mr. Jaggers  , putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at Mr. Jaggers   side  without saying anything to me, addressed Mr. Jaggers   to Mr. Jaggers   followers. First, Mr. Jaggers   took the two secret men. "Now, I have nothing to say to you," said Mr. Jaggers  , throwing Mr. Jaggers   finger at  the two secret men. "I want to know no more than I know. As to the result, it's a toss-up. I  told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you paid Wemmick?" "We made the money up this morning, sir," said one of the two secret men, submissively,  while the other perused Mr. Jaggers  's face. "I don't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it up at  all. Has Wemmick got it?" "Yes, sir," said both the two secret men together. "Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!" said Mr. Jaggers  , waving Mr. Jaggers    hand at the two secret men to put the two secret men behind Mr. Jaggers  . "If you say a word to me, I'll throw up  the case." "We thought, Mr. Jaggers—" one of the two secret men began, pulling off his hat. "That's what I told you not to do," said Mr. Jaggers  . "You thought! I think for  you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to find you; I don't  want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't hear a word." the two secret men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers   waved the two secret men behind again, and  humbly fell back and were heard no more. "And now you!" said Mr. Jaggers  , suddenly stopping, and turning on the two  women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly separated,—"Oh!  Amelia, is it?" "Yes, Mr. Jaggers  ." "And do you remember," retorted Mr. Jaggers  , "that but for Mr. Jaggers   you wouldn't be  here and couldn't be here?" "O yes, sir!" exclaimed the two  women together. "Lord bless you, sir, well we  knows that!" "Then why," said Mr. Jaggers  , "do you come here?" "My Bill, sir!" the crying woman pleaded. "Now, I tell you what!" said Mr. Jaggers  . "Once for all. If you don't know that  your Bill's in good hands, I know it. And if you come here bothering about your  Bill, I'll make an example of both your Bill and you, and let Bill slip through  my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?" "O yes, sir! Every farden." "Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another word—one  single word—and Wemmick shall give you your money back." This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. No one  remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the skirts of Mr.  Jaggers's coat to Mr.   lips several times. "I don't know Mr.  !" said Mr. Jaggers  , in the same devastating strain:  "What does this fellow want?" "Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?" "Who's Mr.  ?" said Mr. Jaggers  . "Let go of Jaggers's coat." The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing The suitor,  replied, "Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate." "You're too late," said Mr. Jaggers  . "I am over the way." "Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!" cried my excitable acquaintance, turning  white, "don't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!" "I am," said Mr. Jaggers  , "and there's an end of it. Get out of the way." "Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen'th gone to Mithter Wemmick at  thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter Jaggerth! Half a  quarter of a moment! If you'd have the condethenthun to be bought off from the  t'other thide—at hany thuperior prithe!—money no object!—Mithter  Jaggerth—Mithter—!" My guardian threw My guardian supplicant off with supreme indifference, and left My guardian  dancing on the pavement as if his supplicant were red hot. Without further interruption, we  reached the front office, where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen  with the fur cap. "Here's Mike," said the clerk, getting down from the clerk stool, and approaching Mr.  Jaggers confidentially. "Oh!" said Mr. Jaggers  , turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of hair in  the middle of Mr. Jaggers   forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the  bell-rope; "your man comes on this afternoon. Well?" "Well, Mas'r Jaggers," returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a  constitutional cold; "arter a deal o' trouble, I've found one, sir, as might  do." "What is sir prepared to swear?" "Well, Mas'r Jaggers," said Mike, wiping Mike nose on Mike fur cap this time; "in  a general way, anythink." Mr. Jaggers   suddenly became most irate. "Now, I warned you before," said Mr. Jaggers  ,  throwing Mr. Jaggers   forefinger at the terrified client, "that if you ever presumed to  talk in that way here, I'd make an example of you. You infernal scoundrel, how  dare you tell ME that?" the terrified client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if the terrified client were unconscious what the terrified client  had done. "Spooney!" said the clerk, in a low voice, giving the terrified client a stir with the terrified client elbow.  "Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?" "Now, I ask you, you blundering booby," said my guardian, very sternly, "once  more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is prepared to  swear?" Mike looked hard at My guardian, as if Mike were trying to learn a lesson from  Mike face, and slowly replied, "Ayther to character, or to having been in Mike  company and never left Mike all the night in question." "Now, be careful. In what station of life is Mike?" Mike looked at his fur cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the ceiling, and  looked at the clerk, and even looked at Mike, before beginning to reply in a  nervous manner, "We've dressed Mike up like—" when My guardian blustered  out,— "What? You WILL, will you?" ("Spooney!" added the clerk again, with another stir.) After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:— "Mike is dressed like a 'spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook." "Is Mike here?" asked My guardian. "I left Mike," said Mike, "a setting on some doorsteps round the corner." "Take Mike past that window, and let me see Mike." that window indicated was that window. We all three went to that window, behind the  wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner, with a  murderous-looking tall individual, in a short suit of white linen and a paper  cap. This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober, and had a black  eye in the green stage of recovery, which was painted over. "Tell him to take him witness away directly," said my guardian to the clerk, in  extreme disgust, "and ask him what him means by bringing such a fellow as that." My guardian then took me into My guardian own room, and while My guardian lunched, standing,  from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (My guardian seemed to bully My guardian very  sandwich as My guardian ate his very  sandwich), informed me what arrangements My guardian had made for My guardian. I was  to go to "Barnard's Inn," to young Mr. Pocket's rooms, where a bed had been  sent in for my accommodation; I was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until  Monday; on Monday I was to go with young Mr. Pocket to young Mr. Pocket father's house on a visit, that I  might try how I liked his father's house. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,—it  was a very liberal one,—and had handed to My guardian from one of my guardian's  drawers, the cards of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds  of clothes, and such other things as I could in reason want. "You will find  your credit good, Mr. Pip," said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt like  a whole caskful, as Mr. Pip hastily refreshed Mr. Pip, "but I shall by this means be  able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you outrunning the  constable. Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but that's no fault of mine." After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked Mr.  Jaggers if I could send for a coach? Mr.   said it was not worth while, I was so  near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with Mr.  , if I pleased. I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk was  rung down from up stairs to take Another clerk place while Another clerk was out, and I accompanied  Another clerk into the street, after shaking hands with My guardian. We found a new set  of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly  yet decisively, "I tell you it's no use; Wemmick won't have a word to say to one of  you;" and We soon got clear of them, and went on side by side.
