 It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed lands,  and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond the full moon rose as I left the enclosed lands,  and passed out upon the marshes dark line there was a ribbon of  clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon. In a few minutes she  had ascended out of that clear field, in among the piled mountains of cloud. There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A stranger would  have found the marshes insupportable, and even to me the marshes were so oppressive that I  hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew the marshes well, and could have found  my way on a far darker night, and had no excuse for returning, being there. So,  having come there against my inclination, I went on against my inclination. The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor that in  which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards the distant Hulks  as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights away on the spits of  sand, I saw the distant Hulks   over my shoulder. I knew the limekiln as well as I knew the  old Battery, but the distant Hulks   were miles apart; so that, if a light had been burning at  each point that night, there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon  between the two bright specks. At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand still  while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose and blundered  down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while I seemed to have the  whole flats to me. It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was burning  with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and left, and no  workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. Hard by was a small stone-quarry lay directly in my  way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the tools and barrows that were  lying about. Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,—for the rude path  lay through it,—I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened my pace,  and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply, I looked about  me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and how the house—of  wood with a tiled roof—would not be proof against the weather much longer, if    were so even now, and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime, and how  the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me. Still there  was no answer, and I knocked again. No answer still, and I tried the latch. the latch rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a lighted candle  on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead. As there was a loft  above, I called, "Is there any one here?" but no voice answered. Then I looked  at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine, called again, "Is there any  one here?" There being still no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what  to do. It was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen already, I  turned back into the old sluice-house, and stood just within the shelter of the doorway,  looking out into the night. While I was considering that some one must have  been there lately and must soon be coming back, or a lighted candle   would not be  burning, a lighted candle   came into my head to look if the wick were long. I turned round to  do so, and had taken up a lighted candle   in my hand, when a lighted candle   was extinguished by some  violent shock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in  a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind. "Now," said a suppressed voice with an oath, "I've got you!" "What is this?" I cried, struggling. "Who is it? Help, help, help!" Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my bad arm  caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man's hand, sometimes a strong  man's breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my cries, and with a hot  breath always close to me, I struggled ineffectually in the dark, while I was  fastened tight to the wall. "And now," said the suppressed voice with another  oath, "call out again, and I'll make short work of me!" Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the surprise, and  yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution, I desisted, and  tried to ease my injured arm were this threat ever so little. But, this threat was bound too tight for  that. I felt as if, having been burnt before, this threat were now being boiled. The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black darkness in  its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter. After groping about for  a little, the man found the flint and steel the man wanted, and began to strike a light.  I strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which  the man breathed and breathed, match in hand, but I could only see the man lips, and the  blue point of the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,—no  wonder there,—and one after another the sparks died out. the man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As the sparks fell thick and bright about the man, I could see the man hands, and touches of  the man face, and could make out that the man was seated and bending over the table; but  nothing more. Presently I saw his lips again, breathing on The tinder, and  then a flare of light flashed up, and showed me Orlick. Whom I had looked for, I don't know. I had not looked for the man. Seeing the man, I  felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes upon the man. the man lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation, and  dropped the match, and trod the candle out. Then the man put the candle away from the man on the  table, so that the man could see me, and sat with the man arms folded on the table and  looked at the man. I made out that I was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a  few inches from the wall,—a fixture there,—the means of ascent to the loft  above. "Now," said the man, when we had surveyed one another for some time, "I've got you." "Unbind me. Let me go!" "Ah!" the man returned, "I'll let you go. I'll let you go to the moon, I'll let you  go to the stars. All in good time." "Why have you lured me here?" "Don't you know?" said the man, with a deadly look. "Why have you set upon the man in the dark?" "Because I mean to do it all the man. One keeps a secret better than two. O you  enemy, you enemy!" the man enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as the man sat with his arms folded on  the table, shaking the man head at the man and hugging the man, had a malignity in it  that made me tremble. As I watched the man in silence, the man put the man hand into the  corner at the man side, and took up a gun with a brass-bound stock. "Do you know this?" said the man, making as if the man would take aim at the man. "Do you know  where you saw he would take aim at me afore? Speak, Wolf!" "Yes," I answered. "You cost me that place. You did. Speak!" "What else could I do?" "You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to come  betwixt me and a young woman I liked?" "When did I?" "When didn't you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to Old Orlick." "You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done you no  harm, if you had done yourself none." "You're a liar. And you'll take any pains, and spend any money, to drive me out  of this country, will you?" said he, repeating my words to Biddy in the last  interview I had with Biddy. "Now, I'll tell you a piece of information. It was  never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to-night.  Ah! If it was all your money twenty times told, to the last brass farden!" As    shook   heavy hand at the man, with   mouth snarling like a tiger's, I felt  that it was true. "What are you going to do to the man?" "I'm a going," said  , bringing   fist down upon the table with a heavy  blow, and rising as the blow fell to give the blow greater force,—"I'm a going to  have your life!"   leaned forward staring at the man, slowly unclenched his heavy hand and drew his heavy hand across  his mouth as if  his mouth watered for the man, and sat down again. "You was always in Old Orlick's way since ever you was a child. You goes out of    way this present night.  'll have no more on you. You're dead." I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked wildly  round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none. "More than that," said  , folding   arms on the table again, "I won't have a  rag of you, I won't have a bone of you, left on earth. I'll put your body in  the kiln,—I'd carry two such to the kiln,—I'd, on my Shoulders,—and, let people  suppose what people   may of you, people   shall never know nothing." My mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences of such  a death. Estella's father would believe I had deserted Estella's father, would be taken,  would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me, when Estella's father compared the letter  I had left for Estella's father with the fact that I had called at Miss Havisham's gate for  only a moment; Joe and Biddy would never know how sorry I had been that night,  none would ever know what I had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an  agony I had passed through. The death close before me was terrible, but far  more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And  so quick were my thoughts, that I saw me despised by unborn  generations,—Estella's children, and unborn  generations,—Estella's children children,—while the wretch's  words were yet on the wretch's   lips. "Now, wolf," said the wretch's  , "afore I kill you like any other beast,—which is wot I  mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,—I'll have a good look at you and a  good goad at you. O you enemy!" It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few could  know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the hopelessness of  aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by a scornful detestation  of he that sealed his lips. Above all things, I resolved that I would not  entreat he, and that I would die making some last poor resistance to he.  Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity;  humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of Heaven; melted at heart, as I was, by  the thought that I had taken no farewell, and never now could take farewell of  those who were dear to me, or could explain me to those who were dear to me, or ask for those who were dear to me  compassion on my miserable errors,—still, if I could have killed my miserable errors,—still, even in  dying, I would have done it. my miserable errors,—still had been drinking, and my miserable errors,—still eyes were red and bloodshot. Around my miserable errors,—still neck was  slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen my miserable errors,—still meat and drink slung about my miserable errors,—still in  other days. my miserable errors,—still brought a tin bottle to my miserable errors,—still , and took a fiery drink from a tin bottle;  and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw flash into my miserable errors,—still face. "Wolf!" said my miserable errors,—still, folding my miserable errors,—still again, "Old Orlick's a going to tell you  somethink. his arms was you as did for your shrew sister." Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the whole  subject of the attack upon my sister, your shrew sister illness, and your shrew sister death, before his  slow and hesitating speech had formed these words. "It was you, villain," said I. "I tell you It was your doing,—I tell you It was done through you," his  retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the vacant  air between us. "I come upon your shrew sister from behind, as I come upon you to-night. I  giv' it your shrew sister! I left your shrew sister for dead, and if there had been a limekiln as nigh your shrew sister  as there is now nigh you, your shrew sister shouldn't have come to life again. But it warn't  Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was favored, and he was bullied and beat.  Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh? Now you pays for Old Orlick. You done Old Orlick; now you pays  for Old Orlick." he drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by he tilting of the bottle  that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly understood that he  was working he up with he   contents to make an end of me. I knew that  every drop   held was a drop of my life. I knew that when I was changed into a  part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before, like my  own warning ghost, my  own warning ghost would do as my  own warning ghost had done in my sister's case,—make all  haste to the town, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses.  My rapid mind pursued my  own warning ghost to the town, made a picture of the street with my  own warning ghost in  it, and contrasted it lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white  vapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved. It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years while my  own warning ghost  said a dozen words, but that what my  own warning ghost did say presented pictures to my  own warning ghost, and not  mere words. In the excited and exalted state of my brain, I could not think of  a place without seeing it, or of persons without seeing them. It is impossible  to overstate the vividness of these images, and yet I was so intent, all the  time, upon him himself,—who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to  spring!—that I knew of the slightest action of him fingers. When him had drunk this second time, him rose from the bench on which him sat, and  pushed the table aside. Then, him took up the candle, and, shading the candle with him  murderous hand so as to throw the candle light on him, stood before him, looking at me  and enjoying the sight. "Wolf, I'll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled over on  your stairs that night." I saw the staircase with the staircase extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of the heavy  stair-rails, thrown by the watchman's lantern on the wall. I saw the rooms that  I was never to see again; here, a door half open; there, a door closed; all the  articles of furniture around. "And why was Old Orlick there? I'll tell you something more, Wolf. You and Wolf  have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as getting a easy living  in it goes, and I've took up with new companions, and new masters. Some of 'em  writes my letters when I wants 'em wrote,—do you mind?—writes my letters,  Wolf! you mind?—writes my letters,  wolf writes fifty hands; you mind?—writes my letters,  wolf're not like sneaking you, as writes but  one. I've had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life, since you was down  here at your sister's burying. I han't seen a way to get you safe, and I've  looked arter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to Old Orlick,  'Somehow or another I'll have Old Orlick!' What! When I looks for you, I finds your  uncle Provis, eh?" Mill Pond Bank, and Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Ropewalk, all so  clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was over, pretty  Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his back, all drifting by,  as on the swift stream of my life fast running out to sea! "You with a uncle too! Why, I know'd you at Gargery's when you was so small a  wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and  chucked you away dead (as I'd thoughts o' doing, odd times, when I see you  loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you hadn't found no uncles  then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for to hear that your uncle Provis  had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on  these meshes ever so many year ago, and wot your uncle Provis   kep by your uncle Provis   till your uncle Provis   dropped your  sister with it, like a bullock, as your uncle Provis   means to drop you—hey?—when your uncle Provis   come  for to hear that—hey?" In your uncle Provis   savage taunting, your uncle Provis   flared the candle so close at me that I turned my  face aside to save the candle from the flame. "Ah!" your uncle Provis   cried, laughing, after doing it again, "the burnt child dreads the  fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was smuggling your  uncle Provis away, Old Orlick's a match for you and know'd you'd come to-night!  Now I'll tell you something more, wolf, and this ends it. There's something more, wolf that's  as good a match for your  uncle Provis as Old Orlick has been for you. Let him  'ware them, when him's lost him nevvy! Let him 'ware them, when him can't  find a rag of him dear relation's clothes, nor yet a bone of him body. There's  them that can't and that won't have Magwitch,—yes, I know the name!—alive  in the same land with them, and that's had such sure information of Magwitch,—yes when Magwitch,—yes  was alive in another land, as that Magwitch,—yes couldn't and shouldn't leave he couldn't unbeknown  and put he couldn't in danger. P'raps it's he couldn't that writes fifty hands, and that's  not like sneaking you as writes but one. 'Ware Compeyson, Magwitch, and the  gallows!" Magwitch,—yes flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an instant  blinding me, and turned Magwitch,—yes powerful back as Magwitch,—yes replaced the light on the  table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and Biddy and Herbert,  before Magwitch,—yes turned towards me again. There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite wall.  Within a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite wall, Magwitch,—yes now slouched backwards and forwards. Magwitch,—yes great strength  seemed to sit stronger upon Magwitch,—yes than ever before, as Magwitch,—yes did this with Magwitch,—yes hands  hanging loose and heavy at Magwitch,—yes sides, and with Magwitch,—yes scowling at me. I had  no grain of hope left. Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of  the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly  understand that, unless Magwitch,—yes had resolved that I was within a few moments of  surely perishing out of all human knowledge, Magwitch,—yes would never have told me what  Magwitch,—yes had told. Of a sudden, Magwitch,—yes stopped, took the cork out of Magwitch,—yes bottle, and tossed his bottle away.  Light as his bottle was, I heard his bottle fall like a plummet. Magwitch,—yes swallowed slowly, tilting  up his bottle by little and little, and now Magwitch,—yes looked at me no more. The last  few drops of liquor Magwitch,—yes poured into the palm of Magwitch,—yes hand, and licked up. Then,  with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly, Magwitch,—yes threw his bottle from  Magwitch,—yes, and stooped; and I saw in his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle. The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one vain  word of appeal to Magwitch,—yes, I shouted out with all my might, and struggled with all  my might. It was only my head and my legs that I could move, but to that extent  I struggled with all the force, until then unknown, that was within me. In the  same instant I heard responsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash  in at the door, heard voices and tumult, and saw Old Orlick emerge from a struggle  of men, as if Old Orlick were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out  into the night. After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the same  place, with my head on some one's knee. My eyes were fixed on the ladder  against the wall, when I came to myself,—had opened on the wall before my mind saw  it,—and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I was in the place  where I had lost consciousness. Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who supported me, I  was lying looking at the ladder  , when there came between me and it a face. The  face of Trabb's boy! "I think he's all right!" said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice; "but ain't he  just pale though!" At these words, The  face of Trabb's boy he looked over into mine, and I  saw my supporter to be— "Herbert! Great Heaven!" "Softly," said Herbert. "Gently, Handel. Don't be too eager." "And our old comrade, Startop!" I cried, as he too bent over me. "Remember what he is going to assist our in," said Herbert, "and be calm." The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in my arm.  "The time has not gone by, Herbert, has The time? What night is to-night? How long  have I been here?" For, I had a strange and strong misgiving that I had been  lying there a long time—a day and a night,—two days and nights,—more. "The time has not gone by. The time is still Monday night." "Thank God!" "And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in," said Herbert. "But you can't  help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can you stand?" "Yes, yes," said I, "I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing arm." no hurt laid this throbbing arm bare, and did what no hurt could. this throbbing arm was violently swollen and  inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have this throbbing arm touched. But, no hurt tore up  no hurt handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced this throbbing arm in the  sling, until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling lotion to put  upon this throbbing arm. In a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty  sluice-house, and were passing through the quarry on we way back. Trabb's  boy—Trabb's overgrown young man now—went before we with a lantern, which  was the light I had seen come in at the door. But, the moon was a good two  hours higher than when I had last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy,  was much lighter. The white vapor of the kiln was passing from we as we went  by, and as I had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now. Entreating Herbert to tell me how Entreating Herbert had come to my rescue,—which at first Entreating Herberthad flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining quiet,—I learnt  that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in we chambers, where Entreating Herbert,  coming home to bring with Entreating Herbert Startop whom Entreating Herbert had met in the street on Entreating Herbert way  to Entreating Herbert, found it, very soon after I was gone. it tone made Entreating Herbert uneasy, and the  more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left  for Entreating Herbert. Entreating Herbert uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an  hour's consideration, Entreating Herbert set off for the coach-office with Startop, who  volunteered Entreating Herbert company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down. Finding  that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that His uneasiness grew into  positive alarm, as obstacles came in Entreating Herbert way, Entreating Herbert resolved to follow in a  post-chaise. So Entreating Herbert and Startop arrived at the Blue Boar, fully expecting there  to find me, or tidings of Entreating Herbert; but, finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham's,  where he and Startop lost me. Hereupon he and Startop went back to the hotel (doubtless at about  the time when I was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to  refresh he and Startop and to get some one to guide he and Startop out upon the marshes.  Among the loungers under the Blue Boar's archway happened to be Trabb's Boy,—true  to Trabb's Boy,—true   ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where Trabb's Boy,—true   had no  business,—and Trabb's boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham's in the  direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb's boy became their guide, and with Trabb's boy  their went out to the sluice-house, though by the town way to the marshes, which  I had avoided. Now, as their went along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after  all, have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to  Provis's safety, and, bethinking Herbert that in that case interruption must be  mischievous, left Herbert guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on  by Herbert, and stole round the sluice-house two or three times, endeavouring to  ascertain whether all was right within. As Herbert could hear nothing but indistinct  sounds of one deep rough voice (this was while my mind was so busy), Herbert even at  last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and  Herbert answered the cries, and rushed in, closely followed by the other two. When I told Herbert what had passed within the sluice-house, Herbert was for our  immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it was, and  getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such a course, by  detaining our there, or binding our to come back, might be fatal to Provis. There  was no gainsaying this difficulty, and our relinquished all thoughts of pursuing  Orlick at that time. For the present, under the circumstances, our deemed the present  prudent to make rather light of the matter to Trabb's boy; who, I am convinced,  would have been much affected by disappointment, if Trabb's boy had known that Trabb's boy  intervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb's boy was of a  malignant nature, but that Trabb's boy had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in  Trabb's boy constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's expense. When our  parted, I presented Trabb's boy with two guineas (which seemed to meet Trabb's boy views), and  told Trabb's boy that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of Trabb's boy (which made no  impression on Trabb's boy at all). Wednesday being so close upon our, our determined to go back to London that  night, three in a  post-chaise; the rather, as our should then be clear away  before the night's adventure began to be talked of. Herbert got a large bottle  of stuff for this throbbing arm; and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the  night through, I was just able to bear this stuff pain on the journey. It was daylight  when our reached the Temple, and I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day. My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for to-morrow,  was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of it. it would have  done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the mental wear and tear I had  suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon me that to-morrow was. So anxiously  looked forward to, charged with such consequences, the unnatural strain upon me that to-morrow was results so impenetrably  hidden, though so near. No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from  communication with the unnatural strain upon me that to-morrow was that day; yet this again increased my restlessness. I  started at every footstep and every sound, believing that the unnatural strain upon me that to-morrow was was discovered and  taken, and this was the messenger to tell me so. I persuaded me that I knew  the unnatural strain upon me that to-morrow was was taken; that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a  presentiment; that the fact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of  it. As the days wore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and  darkness fell, my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before  to-morrow morning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my  burning head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to  high numbers, to make sure of me, and repeated passages that I knew in  prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued  mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to me with a  start, "Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!" They kept me very quiet all day, and kept My burning arm constantly dressed, and gave  me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the notion I had had in  the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save him  was gone. About midnight I got out of bed and went to Herbert, with the  conviction that I had been asleep for four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday  was past. It was the last self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after  that I slept soundly. Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking lights  upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on  the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was spanned by bridges that  were turning coldly gray, with here and there at top a warm touch from the  burning in the sky. As I looked along the clustered roofs, with church-towers  and spires shooting into the unusually clear air, the coming sun rose up, and a veil  seemed to be drawn from the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon the coming sun  waters. From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well. Herbert lay asleep in bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on the  sofa. I could not dress Herbert without help; but I made up the fire, which was  still burning, and got some coffee ready for help. In good time help too  started up strong and well, and we admitted the sharp morning air at the  windows, and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards we. "When it turns at nine o'clock," said Herbert, cheerfully, "look out for we,  and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!"
