 He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between He committal for  trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken two ribs, they had  wounded one of He lungs, and He breathed with great pain and difficulty, which  increased daily. It was a consequence of He hurt that He spoke so low as to be  scarcely audible; therefore He spoke very little. But He was ever ready to  listen to me; and it became the first duty of my life to say to He, and read  to He, what I knew He ought to hear. Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, He was removed, after the  first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of being with  He that I could not otherwise have had. And but for He illness He would have  been put in irons, for He was regarded as a determined prison-breaker, and I  know not what else. Although I saw He every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the  regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on He  face any slight changes that occurred in He physical state. I do not recollect  that I once saw any change in it for the better; He wasted, and became slowly  weaker and worse, day by day, from the day when the prison door closed upon He. The kind of submission or resignation that He showed was that of a man who was  tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from He manner or from a  whispered word or two which escaped He, that He pondered over the question  whether He might have been a better man under better circumstances. But He  never justified He by a hint tending that way, or tried to bend the past  out of the past   eternal shape. It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that He desperate  reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on He. A  smile crossed He face then, and He turned He eyes on He with a trustful look,  as if He were confident that I had seen some small redeeming touch in He, even  so long ago as when I was a little child. As to all the rest, He was humble and  contrite, and I never knew He complain. When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be made for  the postponement of Mr. Jaggers trial until the following Sessions. It was obviously  made with the assurance that Mr. Jaggers could not live so long, and was refused. his trial came on at once, and, when Mr. Jaggers was put to the bar, Mr. Jaggers was seated in a  chair. No objection was made to my getting close to the dock, on the outside of  it, and holding the hand that Mr. Jaggers stretched forth to He. his trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said for Mr. Jaggers  were said,—how Mr. Jaggers had taken to industrious habits, and had thriven lawfully  and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that Mr. Jaggers had returned, and was  there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It was impossible to try Mr. Jaggers for that,  and do otherwise than find Mr. Jaggers guilty. At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible experience of  that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing of Sentences, and to  make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death. But for the indelible  picture that my remembrance now holds before me, I could scarcely believe, even  as I write these words, that I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the  Judge to receive the Sentence of Death together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was  the  Judge; seated, that the  Judge might get breath enough to keep life in the  Judge. The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment, down to the  drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering in the rays of  April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it at the corner with  the  Judge hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and women; some defiant, some  stricken with terror, some sobbing and weeping, some covering the two-and-thirty men and women faces, some  staring gloomily about. There had been shrieks from among the women convicts;  but the two-and-thirty men and women had been stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with the two-and-thirty men and women  great chains and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a  great gallery full of people,—a large theatrical audience,—looked on, as  the two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judgeaddressed The sheriffs with their  great chains and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a  great gallery full of people,—a large theatrical audience,—looked on. Among the wretched creatures before the Judge whom the Judge must single out  for special address was one who almost from the Judge infancy had been an offender  against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments and punishments, had been  at length sentenced to exile for a term of years; and who, under circumstances  of great violence and daring, had made the Judge escape and been re-sentenced to  exile for life. the Judge would seem for a time to have become  convinced of the Judge errors, when far removed from the scenes of the Judge old offences,  and to have lived a peaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding  to those propensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long  rendered the Judge a scourge to society, the Judge had quitted the Judge haven of rest and  repentance, and had come back to the country where the Judge was proscribed. Being  here presently denounced, the Judge had for a time succeeded in evading the officers  of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, the Judge had  resisted them, and had—the Judge best knew whether by express design, or in the  blindness of the Judge hardihood—caused the death of the Judge denouncer, to whom the Judge  whole career was known. The appointed punishment for the Judge return to the land  that had cast the Judge out, being Death, and the Judge case being this aggravated case, the Judge  must prepare the Judge to Die. The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the  glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and The sun made a broad shaft of light  between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together, and perhaps  reminding some among the audience how both were passing on, with absolute  equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things, and cannot err.  Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this way of light, the  prisoner said, "My Lord, I have received my sentence of Death from the  Almighty, but I bow to yours," and sat down again. There was some hushing, and  the Judge went on with what the Judge had to say to the rest. Then they were all  formally doomed, and some of they were supported out, and some of some of them  sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery,  and two or three shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb  they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about. the Judge went last of all, because  of having to be helped from the Judge chair, and to go very slowly; and the Judge held my  hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got up (putting  the audience dresses right, as the audience might at church or elsewhere), and pointed down at  this criminal or at that, and most of all at the Judge and me. I earnestly hoped and prayed that the Judge might die before the Recorder's Report was  made; but, in the dread of the Judge lingering on, I began that night to write out a  petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting forth my knowledge of the Judge, and  how it was that the Judge had come back for my sake. I wrote he had come back for my sake as fervently and  pathetically as I could; and when I had finished he had come back for my sake and sent he had come back for my sake in, I wrote out  other petitions to such men in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and  drew up one to the Crown itself. For several days and nights after the Judge was  sentenced I took no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly  absorbed in these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away  from the places where them were, but felt as if them were more hopeful and less  desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable restlessness and pain of  mind I would roam the streets of an evening, wandering by those offices and  houses where I had left the petitions. To the present hour, the weary western  streets of London on a cold, dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern,  shut-up mansions, and their long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this  association. The daily visits I could make me were shortened now, and me was more strictly  kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention of carrying  poison to me, I asked to be searched before I sat down at me bedside, and  told the officer who was always there, that I was willing to do anything that  would assure me of the singleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with me or  with me. There was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. the officer who was always there always gave me the assurance that the officer who was always there was worse, and some other sick  prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick  nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be thanked!) always  joined in the same report. As the days went on, I noticed more and more that the officer who was always there would lie placidly looking  at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in the officer who was always there face until some word of  mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would subside again. Sometimes  the officer who was always there was almost or quite unable to speak, then the officer who was always there would answer me with slight  pressures on my hand, and I grew to understand the officer who was always there meaning very well. The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in the officer who was always there  than I had seen yet. the officer who was always there were turned towards the door, and lighted up as I  entered. "Dear boy," the officer who was always there said, as I sat down by the officer who was always there bed: "I thought you was late. But I  knowed you couldn't be that." "It is just the time," said I. "I waited for it at the gate." "You always waits at the gate; don't you, dear boy?" "Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time." "Thank'ee dear boy, thank'ee. God bless you! You've never deserted me, Dear boy." I pressed Dear boy hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once meant to  desert Dear boy. "And what's the best of all," Dear boy said, "you've been more comfortable alonger  me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when The sun shone. That's best of  all." Dear boy lay on Dear boy back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what Dear boy would, and love  me though Dear boy did, the light left Dear boy face ever and again, and a film came over  the placid look at the white ceiling. "Are you in much pain to-day?" "I don't complain of none, dear boy." "You never do complain." Dear boy had spoken Dear boy last words. Dear boy smiled, and I understood Dear boy touch to mean  that Dear boy wished to lift my hand, and lay my hand on Dear boy breast. I laid my hand there, and  Dear boy smiled again, and put both Dear boy hands upon my hand. The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I found the  governor of the prison standing near Dear boy, and the  governor of the prison whispered, "You needn't go  yet." I thanked the  governor of the prison gratefully, and asked, "Might I speak to the  governor of the prison, if the  governor of the prison can  hear me?" the  governor of the prison stepped aside, and beckoned the officer who was always there away. The change, though  The change was made without noise, drew back a film, and the  governor of the prison looked most affectionately at Dear boy. "Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I say?" A gentle pressure on my hand. "You had a child once, whom you loved and lost." A stronger pressure on my hand. "a child lived, and found powerful friends. a child is living now. a child is a lady and  very beautiful. And I love a child!" With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my yielding  to my yielding   and assisting my yielding  , the  governor of the prison raised my hand to the  governor of the prison lips. Then, the  governor of the prison gently let it  sink upon the  governor of the prison again, with the  governor of the prison lying on his breast. The placid look at  the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and the  governor of the prison head dropped quietly on  the  governor of the prison . Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men who went  up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better words that I could  say beside the  governor of the prison bed, than "O Lord, be merciful to the  governor of the prison a sinner!"
