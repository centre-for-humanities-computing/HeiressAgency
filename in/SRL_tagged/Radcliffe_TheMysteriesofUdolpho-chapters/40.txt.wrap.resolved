      Oft woo'd the gleam of Cynthia, silver-bright,  In cloisters dim, far from the haunts of folly,  With freedom by my side, and soft-ey'd melancholy.      GRAY The Lady Blanche was so much interested for Emily, that, upon hearing Emily was  going to reside in the neighbouring convent, Emily requested the Count would  invite Emily to lengthen Emily stay at the chateau. 'And you know, my dear sir,'  added The Lady Blanche, 'how delighted I shall be with such a companion; for, at  present, I have no friend to walk, or to read with, since Mademoiselle Bearn is  my mamma's friend only.' the Count smiled at the youthful simplicity, with which the Count daughter yielded to  first impressions; and, though the Count chose to warn his daughter of their danger, the Count  silently applauded the benevolence, that could thus readily expand in  confidence to a stranger. the Count had observed Emily, with attention, on the  preceding evening, and was as much pleased with Emily, as it was possible the Count  could be with any person, on so short an acquaintance. The mention, made of Emily  by Mons. Du Pont, had also given the Count a favourable impression of Emily; but,  extremely cautious as to those, whom the Count introduced to the intimacy of the Count  daughter, the Count determined, on hearing that the former was no stranger at the  convent of St. Claire, to visit the abbess, and, if the abbess account corresponded  with the Count wish, to invite Emily to pass some time at the chateau. On this  subject, the Count was influenced by a consideration of the Lady Blanche's welfare,  still more than by either a wish to oblige the abbess, or to befriend the orphan  Emily, for whom, however, the Count felt considerably interested. On the following morning, Emily was too much fatigued to appear; but Mons. Du  Du Pont was at the breakfast-table, when the Count entered the room, who pressed  the Count, as the Count former acquaintance, and the son of a very old friend, to prolong  the Count stay at the chateau; an invitation, which Du Pont willingly accepted, since  Du Pont would allow the Count to be near Emily; and, though the Count was not conscious of  encouraging a hope, that Emily would ever return the Count affection, the Count had not  fortitude enough to attempt, at present, to overcome it. Emily, when Emily was somewhat recovered, wandered with Emily new friend over the  grounds belonging to the chateau, as much delighted with the surrounding views,  as the Lady Blanche, in the benevolence of Emily heart, had wished; from thence Emily  perceived, beyond the woods, the towers of the monastery, and remarked, that it  was to this convent Emily designed to go. 'Ah!' said the Lady Blanche with surprise, 'I am but just released from a convent, and  would you go into one? If you could know what pleasure I feel in wandering  here, at liberty,—and in seeing the sky and the fields, and the woods all  round me, I think you would not.' Emily, smiling at the warmth, with which the  Lady Blanche spoke, observed, that Emily did not mean to confine Emily to a  convent for life. 'No, you may not intend a  convent for life now,' said the  Lady Blanche; 'but you do not know to what the  nuns may persuade you to consent: I know how kind the  nuns will appear, and how  happy, for I have seen too much of the  nuns art.' When the  nuns returned to the chateau, the  Lady Blanche conducted Emily to the  Lady Blanche  favourite turret, and from thence the  nuns rambled through the ancient chambers,  which the  Lady Blanche had visited before. Emily was amused by observing the structure  of these apartments, and the fashion of the  nuns old but still magnificent  furniture, and by comparing the  nuns with those of the castle of Udolpho, which  were yet more antique and grotesque. Emily was also interested by Dorothee the  house-keeper, who attended them, whose appearance was almost as antique as the  objects around Emily, and who seemed no less interested by Emily, on whom Emily  frequently gazed with so much deep attention, as scarcely to hear what was said  to Emily. While Emily looked from one of the casements, Emily perceived, with surprise,  some objects, that were familiar to Emily memory;—the fields and woods, with  the gleaming brook, which Emily had passed with La Voisin, one evening, soon  after the death of Monsieur St. Aubert, in Emily way from the monastery to Emily  cottage; and Emily now knew this to be the chateau, which he had then avoided,  and concerning which he had dropped some remarkable hints. Shocked by this discovery, yet scarcely knowing why, Emily mused for some time in  silence, and remembered the emotion, which Emily father had betrayed on finding  her father so near this mansion, and some other circumstances of her father conduct, that  now greatly interested Emily. The music, too, which Emily had formerly heard, and,  respecting which La Voisin had given such an odd account, occurred to Emily, and,  desirous of knowing more concerning it, Emily asked Dorothee whether Dorothee returned  at midnight, as usual, and whether her father had yet been discovered. 'Yes, ma'amselle,' replied Dorothee, 'that music is still heard, but her father has never been found out, nor ever will, I believe; though there are  some people, who can guess.' 'Indeed!' said Emily, 'then why do some people, who can guess not pursue the enquiry?' 'Ah, young lady! enquiry enough has been made—but who can pursue a spirit?' Emily smiled, and, remembering how lately Emily had suffered Emily to be led  away by superstition, determined now to resist its contagion; yet, in spite of  Emily efforts, Emily felt awe mingle with Emily curiosity, on this subject; and  Blanche, who had hitherto listened in silence, now enquired what this music  was, and how long this music   had been heard. 'Ever since the death of my lady, madam,' replied Dorothee. 'Why, the place is not haunted, surely?' said Blanche, between jesting and  seriousness. 'I have heard this music   almost ever since my lady died,' continued  Dorothee, 'and never before then. But that is nothing to some things I could  tell of.' 'Do, pray, tell them, then,' said Lady Blanche, now more in earnest than in  jest. 'I am much interested, for I have heard sister Henriette, and sister  Sophie, in the convent, tell of such strange appearances, which they themselves  had witnessed!' 'You never heard, my lady, I suppose, what made us leave the chateau, and go  and live in a cottage,' said Dorothee. 'Never!' replied Blanche with impatience. 'Nor the reason, that my lord, the Marquis'—Dorothee checked herself,  hesitated, and then endeavoured to change the topic; but the curiosity of  Blanche was too much awakened to suffer the subject thus easily to escape Blanche,  and Blanche pressed the old house-keeper to proceed with Blanche account, upon whom,  however, no entreaties could prevail; and it was evident, that Blanche was alarmed  for the imprudence, into which Blanche had already betrayed Blanche. 'I perceive,' said Blanche, smiling, 'that all old mansions are haunted; I am  lately come from a place of wonders; but unluckily, since I left it, I have  heard almost all of all old mansions are haunted explained.' Blanche was silent; Dorothee looked grave, and sighed; and Blanche felt Blanche  still inclined to believe more of the wonderful, than Blanche chose to acknowledge.  Just then, Blanche remembered the spectacle Blanche had witnessed in a chamber of  Udolpho, and, by an odd kind of coincidence, the alarming words, that had  accidentally met Blanche eye in the MS. papers, which Blanche had destroyed, in  obedience to the command of Blanche father; and Blanche shuddered at the meaning they  seemed to impart, almost as much as at the horrible appearance, disclosed by  the black veil. The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, unable to prevail with Dorothee to explain the  subject of Blanche late hints, had desired, on reaching the door, that terminated  the gallery, and which Blanche found fastened on the preceding day, to see the  suite of rooms beyond. 'Blanche,' said the housekeeper, 'I have told  you my reason for not opening them; I have never seen them, since my dear lady  died; and it would go hard with me to see them now. Pray, madam, do not ask me  again.' 'Certainly I will not,' replied The Lady Blanche, 'if that is really your objection.' 'Alas! it is,' said Blanche: 'we all loved Blanche well, and I shall always  grieve for Blanche. Time runs round! it is now many years, since Blanche died; but I  remember every thing, that happened then, as if it was but yesterday. Many  things, that have passed of late years, are gone quite from my memory, while  those so long ago, I can see as if in a glass.' Blanche paused, but afterwards, as  those so long ago walked up the gallery, added to Emily, 'my dear lady   sometimes brings  the late Marchioness to my mind; I can remember, when my dear lady   looked just as  blooming, and very like my dear lady  , when my dear lady   smiles. my dear lady  ! how gay my dear lady   was, when  my dear lady   first came to the chateau!' 'And was my dear lady   not gay, afterwards?' said Blanche. Dorothee shook my dear lady   head; and Emily observed my dear lady  , with eyes strongly expressive  of the interest my dear lady   now felt. 'Let us sit down in this window,' said the Lady  Blanche, on reaching the opposite end of the gallery: 'and pray, Dorothee, if  it is not painful to you, tell us something more about the late Marchioness. I  should like to look into the glass you spoke of just now, and see a few of the  circumstances, which you say often pass over it.' 'No, my lady,' replied Dorothee; 'if you knew as much as I do, you would not,  for you would find there a dismal train of them; I often wish I could shut them  out, but them will rise to my mind. I see my lady on my lady death-bed,—her  very look,—and remember all my lady said—it was a terrible scene!' 'Why was it so terrible?' said Emily with emotion. 'Ah, my lady! is not death always terrible?' replied Dorothee. To some further enquiries of Dorothee was silent; and Emily, observing  the tears in Emily eyes, forbore to urge the subject, and endeavoured to withdraw  the attention of Emily young friend to some object in the gardens, where the  Count, with the Countess and Monsieur Du Pont, appearing, the Countess and Monsieur Du Pont went down to  join the Countess and Monsieur Du Pont. When   perceived Emily,   advanced to meet Emily, and presented Emily to the  Countess, in a manner so benign, that it recalled most powerfully to Emily mind  the idea of Emily late father, and Emily felt more gratitude to  , than  embarrassment towards the Countess, who, however, received Emily with one of  those fascinating smiles, which Emily caprice sometimes allowed Emily to assume,  and which was now the result of a conversation the Count had held with Emily,  concerning Emily. Whatever this might be, or whatever had passed in his  conversation with the lady abbess, whom his had just visited, esteem and  kindness were strongly apparent in his manner, when his addressed Emily, who  experienced that sweet emotion, which arises from the consciousness of  possessing the approbation of the good; for to the Count's worth Emily had been  inclined to yield Emily confidence almost from the first moment, in which Emily had  seen his. Before Emily could finish Emily acknowledgments for the hospitality Emily had  received, and mention of Emily design of going immediately to the convent, Emily  was interrupted by an invitation to lengthen Emily stay at the chateau, which was  pressed by the Count and the  Countess, with an appearance of such friendly  sincerity, that, though Emily much wished to see Emily old friends at the  monastery, and to sigh, once more, over her father's grave, Emily consented to  remain a few days at the chateau. To the abbess, however, Emily immediately wrote, mentioning Emily arrival in  Languedoc and Emily wish to be received into the convent, as a boarder; Emily also  sent letters to Monsieur Quesnel and to Valancourt, whom Emily merely informed of  Emily arrival in France; and, as Emily knew not where the latter might be  stationed, Emily directed Emily letter to his brother's seat in Gascony. In the evening, Lady Blanche and Mons. Monsieur Du Pont walked with Emily to the cottage  of La Voisin, which Emily had now a melancholy pleasure in approaching, for time  had softened Emily grief for the loss of St. Aubert, though Monsieur Du Pont could not  annihilate Monsieur Du Pont, and Emily felt a soothing sadness in indulging the recollections,  which this scene recalled. La Voisin was still living, and seemed to enjoy, as  much as formerly, the tranquil evening of a blameless life. La Voisin was sitting at  the door of La Voisin cottage, watching some of La Voisin grandchildren, playing on the  grass before La Voisin, and, now and then, with a laugh, or a commendation,  encouraging some of his grandchildren sports. La Voisin immediately recollected Emily, whom La Voisin was much  pleased to see, and Emily was as rejoiced to hear, that La Voisin had not lost one of  La Voisin family, since Emily departure. 'Yes, ma'amselle,' said La Voisin, 'we all live merrily together still, thank  God! and I believe there is not a happier family to be found in Languedoc, than  we all.' Emily did not trust Emily in the chamber, where St. Aubert died; and, after  half an hour's conversation with La Voisin and his family, Emily left his cottage. During these the first days of Emily stay at Chateau-le-Blanc, Emily was often  affected, by observing the deep, but silent melancholy, which, at times, stole  over Monsieur Du Pont; and Emily, pitying the self-delusion, which disarmed him of the  will to depart, determined to withdraw Emily as soon as the respect Emily owed  the Count and Countess De Villefort would permit. The dejection of his friend  soon alarmed the anxiety of the Count, to whom Du Pont, at length, confided the  secret of his hopeless affection, which, however, the former could only  commiserate, though his secretly determined to befriend his suit, if an  opportunity of doing so should ever occur. Considering the dangerous situation  of Monsieur Du Pont, he but feebly opposed he intention of leaving Chateau-le-Blanc, on  the following day, but drew from he a promise of a longer visit, when he could  return with safety to he peace. Emily herself, though Emily herself could not encourage  he affection, esteemed he both for the many virtues he possessed, and for the  services Emily herself had received from he; and it was not without tender emotions of  gratitude and pity, that Emily herself now saw he depart for he family seat in Gascony;  while he took leave of Emily herself with a countenance so expressive of love and grief,  as to interest the Count more warmly in he cause than before. In a few days, Emily also left the chateau, but not before the Count and  the  Countess had received the  Countess promise to repeat the  Countess visit very soon; and the  Countess was  welcomed by the abbess, with the same maternal kindness the  Countess had formerly  experienced, and by the nuns, with much expression of regard. The well-known  scenes of the convent occasioned the  Countess many melancholy recollections, but with  these were mingled others, that inspired gratitude for having escaped the  various dangers, that had pursued the  Countess, since the  Countess quitted it, and for the good,  which the  Countess yet possessed; and, though the  Countess once more wept over the  Countess grave, with tears of tender affection, her grief was softened from its former  acuteness. Some time after the  Countess return to the  monastery, the  Countess received a letter from the  Countess  uncle, Mons. Quesnel, in answer to information that the  Countess had arrived in France,  and to the  Countess enquiries, concerning such of the  Countess affairs as her affairs had undertaken to  conduct during the  Countess absence, especially as to the period for which La Vallee had  been let, whither it was the  Countess wish to return, if it should appear, that the  Countess  income would permit the  Countess to do so. The reply of Mons. Monsieur Quesnel was cold and  formal, as Monsieur Quesnel expected, expressing neither concern for the evils Monsieur Quesnel suffered,  nor pleasure, that Monsieur Quesnel was now removed from the evils she suffered,  nor pleasure; nor did she was now removed from them allow the  opportunity to pass, of reproving Monsieur Quesnel for Monsieur Quesnel rejection of Count Morano, whom  she was now removed from them affected still to believe a man of honour and fortune; nor of vehemently  declaiming against Montoni, to whom she was now removed from them had always, till now, felt she was now removed from them to be  inferior. On Emily's pecuniary concerns, she was now removed from them was not very explicit; she was now removed from them informed  Emily, however, that the term, for which La Vallee had been engaged, was nearly  expired; but, without inviting Emily to she was now removed from them own house, added, that Emily  circumstances would by no means allow Emily to reside there, and earnestly  advised Emily to remain, for the present, in the convent of St. Claire. To Emily enquiries respecting poor old Theresa, Emily late father's servant, he  gave no answer. In the postscript to he letter, Monsieur Quesnel mentioned M.  Motteville, in whose hands the late St. Aubert had placed the chief of Monsieur Quesnel  personal property, as being likely to arrange Monsieur Quesnel affairs nearly to the  satisfaction of Monsieur Quesnel creditors, and that Emily would recover much more of Emilyfortune, than Emily had formerly reason to expect. a letter also inclosed to  Emily an order upon a merchant at Narbonne, for a small sum of money. The tranquillity of the  monastery, and the liberty Emily was suffered to enjoy,  in wandering among the woods and shores of this delightful province, gradually  restored Emily spirits to their natural tone, except that anxiety would sometimes  intrude, concerning Valancourt, as the time approached, when it was possible  that Emily might receive an answer to Emily letter.
