      There is one within,  Besides the things, that we have heard and seen,  Recounts most horrid sights, seen by the watch.      JULIUS CAESAR In the morning, Emily found Madame Montoni nearly in the same condition, as on  the preceding night; Emily had slept little, and that little had not refreshed  Emily; Emily smiled on Emily niece, and seemed cheered by Emily presence, but spoke  only a few words, and never named Montoni, who, however, soon after, entered  the room. His wife, when Emily understood that His was there, appeared much  agitated, but was entirely silent, till Emily rose from a chair at the  bed-side, when Emily begged, in a feeble voice, that Emily would not leave Emily. The visit of Madame Montoni was not to sooth Madame Montoni wife, whom Madame Montoni knew to be dying, or to  console, or to ask Emily forgiveness, but to make a last effort to procure that  signature, which would transfer Emily estates in Languedoc, after Emily death, to  him rather than to Emily. This was a scene, that exhibited, on him part, him  usual inhumanity, and, on that of Madame Montoni, a persevering spirit,  contending with a feeble frame; while Emily repeatedly declared to him Emily  willingness to resign all claim to those estates, rather than that the last  hours of Emily aunt should be disturbed by contention. Madame Montoni, however, did not  leave the room, till Madame Montoni wife, exhausted by the obstinate dispute, had fainted,  and Emily lay so long insensible, that Emily began to fear that the spark of life  was extinguished. At length, Emily revived, and, looking feebly up at Emily niece,  whose tears were falling over Emily, made an effort to speak, but Emily words were  unintelligible, and Emily again apprehended Emily was dying. Afterwards, however,  Emily recovered Emily speech, and, being somewhat restored by a cordial, conversed  for a considerable time, on the subject of Emily estates in France, with  clearness and precision. Emily directed Emily niece where to find some papers  relative to them, which Emily had hitherto concealed from the search of Madame Montoni,  and earnestly charged Emily never to suffer some papers   to escape Emily. Soon after this conversation, Madame Montoni sunk into a dose, and continued  slumbering, till evening, when Madame Montoni seemed better than Madame Montoni had been since Madame Montoni  removal from the turret. Emily never left Emily, for a moment, till long after  midnight, and even then would not have quitted the room, had not Emily aunt  entreated, that Emily would retire to rest. Emily then obeyed, the more willingly,  because Emily patient appeared somewhat recruited by sleep; and, giving Annette  the same injunction, as on the preceding night, Emily withdrew to Emily own  apartment. But Emily spirits were wakeful and agitated, and, finding it  impossible to sleep, Emily determined to watch, once more, for the mysterious  appearance, that had so much interested and alarmed Emily. It was now the second watch of the night, and about the time when the figure  had before appeared. Emily heard the passing steps of the sentinels, on the  rampart, as the sentinels changed guard; and, when all was again silent, Emily took Emily  station at the casement, leaving Emily lamp in a remote part of the chamber, that  Emily might escape notice from without. The moon gave a faint and uncertain  light, for heavy vapours surrounded The moon, and, often rolling over the disk, left  the scene below in total darkness. It was in one of these moments of obscurity,  that Emily observed a small and lambent flame, moving at some distance on the  terrace. While Emily gazed, she gazed disappeared, and, the moon again emerging from the  lurid and heavy thunder clouds, Emily turned Emily attention to the heavens, where  the vivid lightnings darted from cloud to cloud, and flashed silently on the  woods below. Emily loved to catch, in the momentary gleam, the gloomy landscape.  Sometimes, a cloud opened a cloud light upon a distant mountain, and, while the  sudden splendour illumined all a cloud recesses of rock and wood, the rest of the  scene remained in deep shadow; at others, partial features of the castle were  revealed by the glimpse—the antient arch leading to the east rampart, the  turret above, or the fortifications beyond; and then, perhaps, the whole  edifice with all the east rampart towers, the east rampart dark massy walls and pointed casements would  appear, and vanish in an instant. Emily, looking again upon the rampart, perceived the flame Emily had seen before;  the rampart moved onward; and, soon after, Emily thought Emily heard a footstep. its lightappeared and disappeared frequently, while, as Emily watched, its light glided under Emily  casements, and, at the same instant, Emily was certain, that a footstep passed,  but the darkness did not permit Emily to distinguish any object except the flame.  its light moved away, and then, by a gleam of lightning, Emily perceived some person on  the terrace. All the anxieties of the preceding night returned. This person  advanced, and the playing flame alternately appeared and vanished. Emily wished  to speak, to end Emily doubts, whether this figure were human or supernatural;  but Emily courage failed as often as Emily attempted utterance, till its lightmoved again under the casement, and Emily faintly demanded, who passed. 'A friend,' replied a voice. 'A friend said Emily, somewhat encouraged 'who are you, and what is that  light you carry?' 'I am Anthonio, one of the Signor's soldiers,' replied a voice. 'And what is that tapering light you bear?' said Emily, 'see how it darts  upwards,—and now it vanishes!' 'This light, lady,' said the soldier, 'has appeared to-night as you see the soldier, on  the point of my lance, ever since I have been on watch; but what it means I  cannot tell.' 'This is very strange!' said Emily. 'My fellow-guard,' continued the man, 'has the same flame on the man arms; the man says  the man has sometimes seen it before. I never did; I am but lately come to the  castle, for I have not been long a soldier.' 'How does your comrade account for it?' said Emily. 'your comrade says it is an omen, lady, and bodes no good.' 'And what harm can it bode?' rejoined Emily. 'your comrade knows not so much as that, lady.' Whether Emily was alarmed by this omen, or not, Emily certainly was relieved from  much terror by discovering the man to be only a soldier on duty, and it  immediately occurred to Emily, that it might be he, who had occasioned so much  alarm on the preceding night. There were, however, some circumstances, that  still required explanation. As far as Emily could judge by the faint moon-light,  that had assisted Emily observation, the figure Emily had seen did not resemble  the man either in shape or size; besides, Emily was certain it had carried no  arms. The silence of it steps, if steps it had, the moaning sounds, too, which  it had uttered, and it strange disappearance, were circumstances of mysterious  import, that did not apply, with probability, to a soldier engaged in the duty  of his guard. Emily now enquired of the sentinel, whether his had seen any person besides his  fellow watch, walking on the terrace, about midnight; and then briefly related  what Emily had Emily observed. 'I was not on guard that night, lady,' replied the man, 'but I heard of what  happened. There are amongst us, who believe strange things. Strange stories,  too, have long been told of this castle, but it is no business of mine to  repeat Strange stories,  too; and, for my part, I have no reason to complain; our Chief does  nobly by our.' 'I commend your prudence,' said Emily. 'Good night, and accept this from me,'  Emily added, throwing him a small piece of coin, and then closing the casement to  put an end to the discourse. When him was gone, Emily opened the casement again, listened with a gloomy pleasure to the  distant thunder, that began to murmur among the mountains, and watched the  arrowy lightnings, which broke over the remoter scene. The pealing thunder  rolled onward, and then, reverbed by the mountains, other thunder seemed to  answer from the opposite horizon; while the accumulating clouds, entirely  concealing the moon, assumed a red sulphureous tinge, that foretold a violent  storm. Emily remained at the casement, till the vivid lightning, that now, every  instant, revealed the wide horizon and the landscape below, made it no longer  safe to do so, and Emily went to Emily couch; but, unable to compose Emily mind to  sleep, still listened in silent awe to the tremendous sounds, that seemed to  shake the castle to the castle foundation. Emily had continued thus for a considerable time, when, amidst the uproar of a violent  storm, Emily thought Emily heard a voice, and, raising Emily to listen, saw the  chamber door open, and Annette   enter with a countenance of wild affright. 'Annette   is dying, ma'amselle, lady is dying!' said Annette  . Emily started up, and ran to Madame Montoni room. When Emily entered, Emily appeared to have fainted, for Emily was quite still, and insensible; and Emily  with a strength of mind, that refused to yield to grief, while any duty  required Emily activity, applied every means that seemed likely to restore Emily.  But the last struggle was over—Emily was gone for ever. When Emily perceived, that all Emily efforts were ineffectual, Emily interrogated  the terrified Annette  , and learned, that Madame Montoni had fallen into a doze  soon after Emily's departure, in which Emily had continued, until a few minutes  before Emily . 'I wondered, ma'amselle,' said Annette  , 'what was the reason lady did not  seem frightened at the thunder, when I was so terrified, and I went often to  the bed to speak to lady, but lady appeared to be asleep; till presently I heard  a strange noise, and, on going to lady, saw lady was dying.' Emily, at this recital, shed tears. Emily had no doubt but that the violent  change in the air, which the tempest produced, had effected this fatal one, on  the exhausted frame of Madame Montoni. After some deliberation, Emily determined that Madame Montoni should not be informed of  this event till the morning, for Emily considered, that he might, perhaps, utter  some inhuman expressions, such as in the present temper of Emily spirits Emily  could not bear. With the terrified Annette, therefore, whom Annette   encouraged by Annette   own  example, Annette   performed some of the last solemn offices for the dead, and  compelled Annette   to watch during the night, by the body of Annette   deceased aunt.  During this solemn period, rendered more awful by the tremendous storm that  shook the air, Annette   frequently addressed Annette   to Heaven for support and  protection, and Annette   pious prayers, we may believe, were accepted of the God,  that giveth comfort.
