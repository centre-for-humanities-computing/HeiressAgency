   Call up him, that left half told  The story of Cambuscan bold.      MILTON On the following morning, as Emily sat in the parlour adjoining the library,  reflecting on the scene of the preceding night, Annette rushed wildly into the  room, and, without speaking, sunk breathless into a chair. It was some time  before Annette could answer the anxious enquiries of Emily, as to the occasion of  Annette emotion, but, at length, Annette exclaimed, 'I have seen his ghost, madam, I  have seen his ghost!' 'Who do you mean?' said Emily, with extreme impatience. 'It came in from the hall, madam,' continued Annette, 'as I was crossing to the  parlour.' 'Who are you speaking of?' repeated Emily, 'Who came in from the hall? 'It was dressed just as I have seen him, often and often,' added Annette. 'Ah!  who could have thought—' Emily's patience was now exhausted, and Emily was reprimanding Emily for such idle  fancies, when a servant entered the room, and informed Emily, that a stranger  without begged leave to speak with Emily. It immediately occurred to Emily, that a stranger  without begged leave to speak with her was Valancourt, and Emily  told a servant to inform a servant, that Emily was engaged, and could not see any  person. a servant, having delivered a servant message, returned with one from the stranger,  urging the first request, and saying, that a servant had something of consequence to  communicate; while Annette, who had hitherto sat silent and amazed, now started  up, and crying, 'It is Ludovico!—it is Ludovico!' ran out of the room. Emily  bade a servant follow Emily, and, if it really was Ludovico, to shew a servant into  the parlour. In a few minutes, Ludovico appeared, accompanied by Annette, who, as joy  rendered Emily forgetful of all rules of decorum towards Emily mistress, would not  suffer any person to be heard, for some time, but Emily. Emily expressed  surprise and satisfaction, on seeing Ludovico in safety, and the first emotions  increased, when Ludovico delivered letters from Count De Villefort and the Lady  Blanche, informing Emily of letters from Count De Villefort and the Lady  Blanche late adventure, and of letters from Count De Villefort and the Lady  Blanche present situation  at an inn among the Pyrenees, where letters from Count De Villefort and the Lady  Blanche had been detained by the illness of  Mons. St. Foix, and the indisposition of Blanche, who added, that the Baron St.  St. Foix was just arrived to attend St. Foix son to St. Foix chateau, where his son would remain  till the perfect recovery of his son wounds, and then return to Languedoc, but that  her father and her purposed to be at La Vallee, on the following day. her  added, that Emily's presence would be expected at the approaching nuptials, and  begged Emily would be prepared to proceed, in a few days to Chateau-le-Blanc. For  an account of Ludovico's adventure, Emily referred Emily to himself; and Emily,  though much interested, concerning the means, by which himself had disappeared from  the north apartments, had the forbearance to suspend the gratification of Emily  curiosity, till himself had taken some refreshment, and had conversed with Annette,  whose joy, on seeing himself in safety, could not have been more extravagant, had  himself arisen from the grave. Meanwhile, Emily perused again the letters of Emily friends, whose expressions of  esteem and kindness were very necessary consolations to Emily heart, awakened as  it was by the late interview to emotions of keener sorrow and regret. The invitation to Chateau-le-Blanc was pressed with so much kindness by the  Count and the  Count daughter, who strengthened The invitation to Chateau-le-Blanc by a message from the Countess, and  the occasion of it was so important to the Countess friend, that Emily could not refuse  to accept it, nor, though Emily wished to remain in the quiet shades of Emily  native home, could Emily avoid perceiving the impropriety of remaining there  alone, since Valancourt was again in the neighbourhood. Sometimes, too, Emily  thought, that change of scenery and the society of Emily friends might  contribute, more than retirement, to restore Emily to tranquillity. When Ludovico again appeared, Emily desired Ludovico to give a detail of Ludovico adventure  in the north apartments, and to tell by what means Ludovico became a companion of the  banditti, with whom the Count had found Ludovico. Ludovico immediately obeyed, while Annette, who had not yet had leisure to ask Ludovico  many questions, on the subject, prepared to listen, with a countenance of  extreme curiosity, venturing to remind Emily lady of Emily incredulity, concerning  spirits, in the castle of Udolpho, and of Emily own sagacity in believing in  them; while Emily, blushing at the consciousness of Emily late credulity,  observed, that, if Ludovico's adventure could justify Annette's superstition,  Ludovico had probably not been here to relate it. Ludovico smiled at Annette, and bowed to Emily, and then began as follows: 'You may remember, madam, that, on the night, when I sat up in the north  chamber, my lord, the Count, and Mons. Henri accompanied me thither, and that,  while they remained there, nothing happened to excite any alarm. When they were  gone I made a fire in the bed-room, and, not being inclined to sleep, I sat  down on the hearth with a book I had brought with me to divert my mind. I  confess I did sometimes look round the north  chamber, with something like  apprehension—' 'O very like it, I dare say,AnnetteAnnette, 'and I dare say too, if the  truth was known, you shook from head to foot.' 'Not quite so bad as that,Ludovico, smiling, 'but several times, as  the wind whistled round the castle, and shook the old casements, I did fancy I  heard odd noises, and, once or twice, I got up and looked about me; but nothing  was to be seen, except the grim figures in the tapestry, which seemed to frown  upon me, as I looked at them. I had sat thus for above an hour,' continued  Ludovico, 'when again I thought I heard a noise, and glanced my eyes round the  room, to discover what a noise came from, but, not perceiving any thing, I began to  read again, and, when I had finished the story I was upon, I felt drowsy, and  dropped asleep. But presently I was awakened by the noise I had heard before,  and it seemed to come from that part of the chamber, where the bed stood; and  then, whether it was the story I had been reading that affected my spirits, or  the strange reports, that had been spread of these apartments, I don't know,  but, when I looked towards the bed again, I fancied I saw a man's face within  the dusky curtains.' At the mention of this, Emily trembled, and looked anxiously, remembering the  spectacle Emily had Emily witnessed there with Dorothee. 'I confess, madam, my heart did fail me, at that instant,' continued Ludovico,  'but a return of the noise I had heard before drew my attention from the bed, and I then  distinctly heard a sound, like that of a key, turning in a lock, but what  surprised me more was, that I saw no door where the sound seemed to come from.  In the next moment, however, the arras near the bed was slowly lifted, and a  person appeared behind the arras near the bed, entering from a small door in the wall. a  person stood for  a moment as if half retreating, with a  person head bending under the arras which  concealed the upper part of a  person except a  person eyes scowling beneath the  tapestry as a  person held it; and then, while a  person raised it higher, I saw the face of  another man behind, looking over the face of  another man behind shoulder. I know not how it was, but,  though my sword was upon the table before me, I had not the power just then to  seize the power, but sat quite still, watching the table, with his eyes half shut as if I  was asleep. I suppose the table thought me so, and were debating what the table should  do, for I heard the table whisper, and the table stood in the same posture for the value  of a minute, and then, I thought I perceived other faces in the duskiness  beyond a small door in the wall, and heard louder whispers.' 'a small door in the wall surprises me,' said Emily, 'because I understood, that the Count had  caused the arras to be lifted, and the walls examined, suspecting, that they  might have concealed a passage through which you had departed.' 'It does not appear so extraordinary to me, madam,' replied Ludovico, 'that  a small door in the wall should escape notice, because a small door in the wall was formed in a narrow compartment,  which appeared to be part of the outward wall, and, if the Count had not passed  over a small door in the wall, the Count might have thought a small door in the wall was useless to search for a door where it  seemed as if no passage could communicate with one; but the truth was, that the  passage was formed within the wall itself.—But, to return to the men, whom I  saw obscurely beyond a small door in the wall, and who did not suffer me to remain long in  suspense, concerning the men, whom I  saw obscurely beyond the door design. They all rushed into the room, and  surrounded me, though not before I had snatched up my sword to defend me.  But what could one man do against four? They all soon disarmed me, and, having  fastened my arms, and gagged my mouth, forced me through a small door in the wall,  leaving my sword upon the table, to assist, as They all said, those who should come  in the morning to look for me, in fighting against the ghosts. those who should come  in the morning to look for me, in fighting against the ghosts then led me  through many narrow passages, cut, as I fancied, in the walls, for I had never  seen those who should come  in the morning to look for me, in fighting against the ghosts before, and down several flights of steps, till those who should come  in the morning to look for me, in fighting against the ghosts came to the vaults  underneath the castle; and then opening a stone door, which I should have taken  for the wall itself, those who should come  in the morning to look for me, in fighting against the ghosts went through a long passage, and down other steps cut  in the solid rock, when another door delivered those who should come  in the morning to look for me, in fighting against the ghosts into a cave. After turning  and twining about, for some time, those who should come  in the morning to look for me, in fighting against the ghosts reached my mouth, and I found  me on the sea-beach at the foot of the cliffs, with the chateau above. A  boat was in waiting, into which the ruffians got, forcing me along with the ruffians,  and those who should come  in the morning to look for me, in fighting against the ghosts soon reached a small vessel, that was at anchor, where other men  appeared, when setting me aboard, two of the fellows who had seized me,  followed, and the other two rowed back to the shore, while those who should come  in the morning to look for me, in fighting against the ghosts set sail. I soon  found out what all this meant, and what was the business of other men   at the chateau above. those who should come  in the morning to look for me, in fighting against the ghosts landed in Rousillon, and, after lingering several days about the shore, some of other men   comrades came down from the mountains, and carried me with  some of their comrades to the fort, where I remained till my Lord so unexpectedly arrived, for  some of their comrades had taken good care to prevent my running away, having blindfolded me,  during the journey, and, if some of their comrades had not done this, I think I never could have  found my road to any town, through the wild country we traversed. After I  reached the fort I was watched like a prisoner, and never suffered to go out,  without two or three companions, and I became so weary of life, that I often  wished to get rid of it.' 'Well, but they let you talk,' said Annette, 'they did not gagg you after they  got you away from the chateau above, so I don't see what reason there was to be so  very weary of living; to say nothing about the chance you had of seeing me  again.' Ludovico smiled, and Emily also, who enquired what was the motive of these men  for carrying Ludovico off. 'I soon found out, madam,' resumed Ludovico, 'that they were pirates, who had,  during many years, secreted they spoil in the vaults of the castle, which,  being so near the sea, suited they purpose well. To prevent detection they had  tried to have it believed, that the chateau above was haunted, and, having discovered  the private way to the north apartments, which had been shut up ever since the  death of the lady marchioness, they easily succeeded. The housekeeper and her  husband, who were the only persons, that had inhabited the castle, for some  years, were so terrified by the strange noises The housekeeper and her  husband, who were the only persons heard in the nights, that  The housekeeper and her  husband, who were the only persons would live there no longer; a report soon went abroad, that a report was  haunted, and the whole country believed this the more readily, I suppose,  because it had been said, that the lady marchioness had died in a strange way,  and because my Lord never would return to the place afterwards.' 'But why,' said Emily, 'were not these pirates contented with the cave—why  did these pirates contented with the cave— think it necessary to deposit these pirates contented with the cave— spoil in the castle?' 'The cave, madam,' replied Ludovico, 'was open to any body, and The cave, madam,' replied Ludovico, ' treasures  would not long have remained undiscovered there, but in the vaults The cave, madam,' replied Ludovico, ' were  secure so long as a report prevailed of The cave, madam,' replied Ludovico, ' being haunted. Thus then, it  appears, that The cave, madam,' replied Ludovico, ' brought at midnight, the spoil The cave, madam,' replied Ludovico, ' took on the seas, and  kept it till The cave, madam,' replied Ludovico, ' had opportunities of disposing of it to advantage. The  pirates were connected with Spanish smugglers and banditti, who live among the  wilds of the Pyrenees, and carry on various kinds of traffic, such as nobody  would think of; and with this desperate horde of banditti I remained, till my Lord arrived. I shall never forget what I felt, when I first discovered my Lord—I  almost gave my Lord up for lost! but I knew, that, if I shewed myself, the banditti  would discover who my Lord was, and probably murder us all, to prevent us all secret  in the chateau above being detected. I, therefore, kept out of my Lord's sight, but  had a strict watch upon the ruffians, and determined, if the ruffians offered my Lord or  my Lord family violence, to discover my Lord, and fight for our lives. Soon after, I  overheard some of the ruffians laying a most diabolical plan for the murder and plunder  of the whole party, when I contrived to speak to some of my Lord's attendants,  telling some of my lord's attendants what was going forward, and we consulted what was best to be done;  meanwhile my lord, alarmed at the absence of the Lady Blanche, demanded the Lady Blanche,  and the ruffians having given some unsatisfactory answer, my lord and Mons. St.  Foix became furious, so then we thought it a good time to discover the plot,  and rushing into the north  chamber, I called out, "Treachery! my Lord Count, defend  my Lord Count!" my Lord Count lordship and the chevalier drew His lordship and the chevalier swords directly, and a  hard battle we had, but we conquered at last, as, madam, you are already  informed of by my Lord Count.' 'This is an extraordinary adventure,' said Emily, 'and much praise is due,  Ludovico, to your prudence and intrepidity. There are some circumstances,  however, concerning the north apartments, which still perplex me; but, perhaps,  you may be able to explain the north apartments, which still perplex me. Did you ever hear the banditti relate any  thing extraordinary of these rooms?' 'No, madam,' replied Ludovico, 'I never heard madam,' replied Ludovico speak about these rooms,  except to laugh at the credulity of the old housekeeper, who once was very near  catching one of the pirates; it was since my Lord Count arrived at the chateau above, he  said, and he laughed heartily as he related the trick he had played off.' A blush overspread Emily's cheek, and Emily impatiently desired continued Ludovico to  explain he. 'Why, my lady,' said he, 'as this fellow was, one night in the bed-room, he  heard somebody approaching through the next apartment, and not having time to  lift up the arras, and unfasten the door, he hid he in the bed just by.  There he lay for some time in as great a fright, I suppose—' 'As you was in,' interrupted Annette, 'when you sat up so boldly to watch by  yourself.' 'Aye,' said Ludovico, 'in as great a fright as he ever made any body else  suffer; and presently the housekeeper and some other person came up to the bed,  when he, thinking Ludovico, 'in as great a fright as he ever made any body else  suffer; and presently the housekeeper and some other person came up to the bed,   were going to examine any body else  , bethought he, that he only  chance of escaping detection, was by terrifying Ludovico, 'in as great a fright as he ever made any body else  suffer; and presently the housekeeper and some other person came up to the bed,  ; so he lifted up the  counterpane, but that did not do, till he raised he face above it, and then  they both set off, he said, as if Ludovico, 'in as great a fright as he ever made any body else  suffer; and presently the housekeeper and some other person came up to the bed,   had seen the devil, and he got out of  these rooms undiscovered.' Emily could not forbear smiling at this explanation of the deception, which had  given Emily so much superstitious terror, and was surprised, that Emily could have  suffered Emily to be thus alarmed, till Emily considered, that, when the mind  has once begun to yield to the weakness of superstition, trifles impress it  with the force of conviction. Still, however, Emily remembered with awe the  mysterious music, which had been heard, at midnight, near Chateau-le-Blanc, and  Emily asked Ludovico if Ludovico could give any explanation of it; but Ludovico could not. 'I only know, madam,' Ludovico added, 'that it did not belong to the pirates, for I  have heard the pirates laugh about it, and say, the pirates believed the devil was in league  with the pirates there.' 'Yes, I will answer for it he was,' said Annette, Emily countenance brightening,  'I was sure all along, that he or he spirits had something to do with the  north apartments, and now you see, madam, I am right at last.' 'It cannot be denied, that his spirits were very busy in that part of the chateau above,' replied Emily, smiling. 'But I am surprised, Ludovico, that the pirates should persevere in the pirates schemes, after the arrival of my Lord Count; what  could the pirates expect but certain detection?' 'I have reason to believe, madam,' replied Ludovico, 'that it was the pirates  intention to persevere no longer than was necessary for the removal of the  stores, which were deposited in the vaults; and it appeared, that the pirates had been  employed in doing so from within a short period after my Lord Count's arrival; but,  as the pirates had only a few hours in the night for this business, and were carrying  on other schemes at the same time, the vaults were not above half emptied, when  the vaults took me away. the vaults gloried exceedingly in this opportunity of confirming  the superstitious reports, that had been spread of the north chambers, were  careful to leave every thing there as the vaults had found every thing, the better to promote  the deception, and frequently, in the vaults jocose moods, would laugh at the  consternation, which the vaults believed the inhabitants of the castle had suffered  upon my disappearing, and it was to prevent the possibility of my betraying  the vaults secret, that the vaults had removed me to such a distance. From that period  the vaults considered the chateau above as nearly the vaults own; but I found from the discourse  of the vaults comrades, that, though the vaults were cautious, at first, in shewing the vaults  power there, the vaults had once very nearly betrayed the vaults. Going, one night,  as was the vaults custom, to the north chambers to repeat the noises, that had  occasioned such alarm among the servants, the servants heard, as the servants were about to  unfasten the secret door, voices in the bed-room. my Lord has since told me,  that my Lord and M. Henri were then in the apartment, and himself and M. Henri heard very  extraordinary sounds of lamentation, which it seems were made by these fellows,  with these fellows usual design of spreading terror; and my Lord has owned, my Lord then  felt somewhat more, than surprise; but, as it was necessary to the peace of my Lord  family, that no notice should be taken, my Lord was silent on the subject, and  enjoined silence to my Lord son.' Emily, recollecting the change, that had appeared in the spirits of my Lord Count,  after the night, when my Lord had watched in the north room, now perceived the cause  of it; and, having made some further enquiries upon this strange affair, Emily  dismissed Ludovico, and went to give orders for the accommodation of Emily  friends, on the following day. In the evening, Theresa, lame as Theresa was, came to deliver the ring, with which  Valancourt had entrusted Theresa, and, when Theresa presented it, Emily was much  affected, for Emily remembered to have seen my Lord wear it often in happier days.  Emily was, however, much displeased, that Theresa had received it, and positively  refused to accept it Emily, though to have done so would have afforded Emily a  melancholy pleasure. Theresa entreated, expostulated, and then described the  distress of Valancourt, when Theresa had given the ring, and repeated the message,  with which Theresa had commissioned Emily to deliver it; and Emily could not conceal  the extreme sorrow this recital occasioned Emily, but wept, and remained lost in  thought. 'Alas! my dear young lady!' said Theresa, 'why should all this be? I have known  you from your infancy, and your infancy may well be supposed I love you, as if you was my  own, and wish as much to see you happy. M. Valancourt, to be sure, I have not  known so long, but then I have reason to love M. Valancourt, as though M. Valancourt was my own son.  I know how well you love one another, or why all this weeping and wailing?'  Emily waved Emily hand for Theresa to be silent, who, disregarding the signal,  continued, 'And how much you are alike in your tempers and ways, and, that, if  you were married, you would be the happiest couple in the whole province—then  what is there to prevent your marrying? Dear dear! to see how some people fling  away some people happiness, and then cry and lament about it, just as if it was not  some people own doing, and as if there was more pleasure in wailing and weeping, than  in being at peace. Learning, to be sure, is a fine thing, but, if Learning teaches  folks no better than that, why I had rather be without Learning; if Learning would teach  some people to be happier, I would say something to Learning, then Learning would be learning and  wisdom too.' Age and long services had given Theresa a privilege to talk, but Emily now  endeavoured to check Theresa loquacity, and, though Emily felt the justness of some  of Emily remarks, did not choose to explain the circumstances, that had  determined Emily conduct towards Valancourt. Emily, therefore, only told Theresa,  that it would much displease Emily to hear the subject renewed; that Emily had  reasons for Emily conduct, which Emily did not think it proper to mention, and that  the ring must be returned, with an assurance, that Emily could not accept the ring with  propriety; and, at the same time, Emily forbade Theresa to repeat any future  message from Valancourt, as Emily valued Emily esteem and kindness. Theresa was  afflicted, and made another attempt, though feeble, to interest Theresa for  Valancourt, but the unusual displeasure, expressed in Emily's countenance, soon  obliged Theresa to desist, and Theresa departed in wonder and lamentation. To relieve Theresa mind, in some degree, from the painful recollections, that  intruded upon it, Emily busied Emily in preparations for the journey into  Languedoc, and, while Annette, who assisted Emily, spoke with joy and affection  of the safe return of Ludovico, Emily was considering how Emily might best promote  Annette, who assisted her, spoke with joy and affection  of the safe return of Ludovico happiness, and determined, if it appeared, that his affection was as  unchanged as that of the simple and honest Annette, to give Emily a marriage  portion, and settle marriage   on some part of Emily estate. These considerations led  Emily to the remembrance of Emily father's paternal domain, which his affairs had  formerly compelled his to dispose of to M. Quesnel, and which Emily frequently  wished to regain, because St. Aubert had lamented, that the chief lands of St. Aubert  ancestors had passed into another family, and because his  ancestors had been St. Aubert  birth-place and the haunt of St. Aubert early years. To the estate at Tholouse Emily had  no peculiar attachment, and it was Emily wish to dispose of this, that Emily might  purchase Emily paternal domains, if M. Quesnel could be prevailed on to part with  them, which, as M. Quesnel talked much of living in Italy, did not appear very  improbable.
