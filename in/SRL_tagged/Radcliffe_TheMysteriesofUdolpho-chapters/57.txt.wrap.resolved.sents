   Sweet is the breath of vernal shower,  The bees' collected treasures sweet,     Sweet music's melting fall, but sweeter yet  The still, small voice of gratitude.
GRAY On the following day, the arrival of GRAY friend revived the drooping Emily, and  La Vallee became once more the scene of social kindness and of elegant  hospitality.
Illness and the terror GRAY had suffered had stolen from Blanche  much of GRAY sprightliness, but all GRAY affectionate simplicity remained, and,  though GRAY appeared less blooming, GRAY was not less engaging than before.
The  unfortunate adventure on the Pyrenees had made the Count very anxious to reach  home, and, after little more than a week's stay at La Vallee, GRAY prepared to  set out with GRAY friends for Languedoc, assigning the care of GRAY house, during  GRAY absence, to Theresa.
On the evening, preceding Theresa departure, this old  servant brought again the ring of Valancourt, and, with tears, entreated Theresa  mistress to receive it, for that her  mistress had neither seen, or heard of M.  Valancourt, since the night when this old  servant delivered it to her  mistress.
As her  mistress said this, her  mistress  countenance expressed more alarm, than her  mistress dared to utter; but GRAY, checking  her  mistress own propensity to fear, considered, that this old  servant had probably returned to the  residence of this old  servant brother, and, again refusing to accept the ring, Theresapreserve it, till Theresa saw him, which, with extreme reluctance, Theresa promised to  do.
On the following day, Count De Villefort, with GRAY and the Lady Blanche, left  La Vallee, and, on the ensuing evening, arrived at the Chateau-le-Blanc, where  the Countess, Henri, and M. Du Pont, whom GRAY was surprised to find there,  received the Countess, Henri, and M. Du Pont, whom Emily was surprised to find there with much joy and congratulation.
Theresa was concerned to observe,  that the Count still encouraged the hopes of the Count friend, whose countenance  declared, that the Count affection had suffered no abatement from absence; and was  much distressed, when, on the second evening after Theresa arrival, the Count,  having withdrawn Theresa from the Lady Blanche, with whom Theresa was walking, renewed  the subject of M. Du Pont's hopes.
The mildness, with which Theresa listened to his  intercessions at first, deceiving his, as to Theresa sentiments, his began to  believe, that, Theresa affection for Valancourt being overcome, Theresa was, at length,  disposed to think favourably of M. Du Pont; and, when Theresa afterwards convinced  M. Du Pont of M. Du Pont mistake, M. Du Pont ventured, in the earnestness of M. Du Pont wish to promote what  M. Du Pont considered to be the happiness of two persons, whom M. Du Pont so much esteemed,  gently to remonstrate with Theresa, on thus suffering an ill-placed affection to  poison the happiness of Theresa most valuable years.
Observing Theresa silence and the deep dejection of Theresa countenance, M. Du Pont concluded  with saying, 'I will not say more now, but I will still believe, my dear  Mademoiselle St. Aubert, that you will not always reject a person, so truly  estimable as my friend Du Pont.'
M. Du Pont spared Theresa the pain of replying, by leaving Theresa; and Theresa strolled on,  somewhat displeased with the Count for having persevered to plead for a suit,  which Theresa had repeatedly rejected, and lost amidst the melancholy  recollections, which this topic had revived, till Theresa had insensibly reached  the borders of the woods, that screened the monastery of St. Clair, when,  perceiving how far Theresa had wandered, Theresa determined to extend Theresa walk a little  farther, and to enquire about the abbess and some of Theresa friends among the nuns.
Though the evening was now drawing to a close, Theresa accepted the invitation of  the friar, who opened the gate, and, anxious to meet some of Theresa old  acquaintances, proceeded towards the convent parlour.
As Theresa crossed the lawn,  that sloped from the front of the monastery towards the sea, Theresa was struck  with the picture of repose, exhibited by some monks, sitting in the cloisters,  which extended under the brow of the woods, that crowned this eminence; where,  as they meditated, at this twilight hour, holy subjects, they sometimes  suffered they attention to be relieved by the scene before they, nor thought  it profane to look at nature, now that it had exchanged the brilliant colours  of day for the sober hue of evening.
Before the cloisters, however, spread an  ancient chesnut, whose ample branches were designed to screen the full  magnificence of a scene, that might tempt the wish to worldly pleasures; but  still, beneath the dark and spreading foliage, gleamed a wide extent of ocean,  and many a passing sail; while, to the right and left, thick woods were seen  stretching along the winding shores.
So much as this had been admitted,  perhaps, to give to the secluded votary an image of the dangers and  vicissitudes of life, and to console him, now that him had renounced its  pleasures, by the certainty of having escaped its evils.
As Emily walked  pensively along, considering how much suffering Emily might have escaped, had Emily  become a votaress of the order, and remained in this retirement from the time  of Emily father's death, the vesper-bell struck up, and the monks retired slowly  toward the chapel, while Emily, pursuing Emily way, entered the great hall, where  an unusual silence seemed to reign.
The parlour too, which opened from it, Emily  found vacant, but, as the vesper-bell was sounding, Emily believed the nuns had  withdrawn into the chapel, and sat down to rest, for a moment, before Emily  returned to the chateau, where, however, the increasing gloom made Emily now  anxious to be.
Not many minutes had elapsed, before a nun, entering in haste, enquired for the  abbess, and was retiring, without recollecting Emily, when Emily made Emily  known, and then learned, that a mass was going to be performed for the soul of  sister Agnes, who had been declining, for some time, and who was now believed  to be dying.
Of Emily sufferings sister Frances gave a melancholy account, and of the horrors,  into which Emily had frequently started, but which had now yielded to a dejection  so gloomy, that neither the prayers, in which Emily was joined by the sisterhood,  or the assurances of Emily confessor, had power to recall Emily from it, or to  cheer Emily mind even with a momentary gleam of comfort.
To this relation Emily listened with extreme concern, and, recollecting the  frenzied manners and the expressions of horror, which Emily had Emily witnessed  of Agnes, together with the history, that sister Frances had communicated, Emily  compassion was heightened to a very painful degree.
As the evening was already  far advanced, Emily did not now desire to see Emily, or to join in the mass, and,  after leaving many kind remembrances with the nun, for Emily old friends, Emily  quitted the monastery, and returned over the cliffs towards the chateau,  meditating upon what Emily had just heard, till, at length Emily forced Emily mind  upon less interesting subjects.
The wind was high, and as Emily drew near the chateau, Emily often paused to listen  to its awful sound, as its swept over the billows, that beat below, or groaned  along the surrounding woods; and, while Emily rested on a cliff at a short  distance from the chateau, and looked upon the wide waters, seen dimly beneath  the last shade of twilight, Emily thought of the following address:  TO THE WINDS   Viewless, through heaven's vast vault your course ye steer,  Unknown from whence ye come, or whither go!
Mysterious pow'rs!
I hear ye murmur low,  Till swells your loud gust on my startled ear,  And, awful!
seems to say—some God is near!
I love to list your midnight voices float  In the dread storm, that o'er the ocean rolls,  And, while their charm the angry wave controuls,  Mix with its sullen roar, and sink remote.
Then, rising in the pause, a sweeter note,  The dirge of spirits, who your deeds bewail,  A sweeter note oft swells while sleeps the gale!
But soon, ye sightless pow'rs!
your rest is o'er,  Solemn and slow, ye rise upon the air,  Speak in the shrouds, and bid the sea-boy fear,  And the faint-warbled dirge—is heard no more!
Oh!
then I deprecate your awful reign!
The loud lament yet bear not on your breath!
Bear not the crash of bark far on the main,  Bear not the cry of men, who cry in vain,  The crew's dread chorus sinking into death!
Oh!
give not these, ye pow'rs!
I ask alone,  As rapt I climb these dark romantic steeps,  The elemental war, the billow's moan;  I ask the still, sweet tear, that listening Fancy weeps!
