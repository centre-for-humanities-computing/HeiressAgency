   As when a shepherd of the Hebrid-Isles,   Placed far amid the melancholy main,   (Whether it be lone fancy him beguiles,   Or that aerial beings sometimes deign   To stand embodied to our senses plain)   Sees on the naked hill, or valley low,   The whilst in ocean Phoebus dips his wain,   A vast assembly moving to and fro,  Then all at once in air dissolves the wondrous show.      CASTLE OF INDOLENCE Madame Cheron's avarice at length yielded to CASTLE OF INDOLENCE Madame Cheron's avarice at length vanity. Some very splendid  entertainments, which Madame Clairval had given, and the general adulation,  which was paid CASTLE OF INDOLENCE Madame Cheron's avarice at length, made the former more anxious than before to secure an  alliance, that would so much exalt CASTLE OF INDOLENCE Madame Cheron's avarice at length in CASTLE OF INDOLENCE Madame Cheron's avarice at length own opinion and in that of the  world. CASTLE OF INDOLENCE Madame Cheron's avarice at length proposed terms for the immediate marriage of CASTLE OF INDOLENCE Madame Cheron's avarice at length niece, and offered  to give Emily a dower, provided Madame Clairval observed equal terms, on the  part of Emily nephew. Madame Clairval listened to the proposal, and, considering  that Emily was the apparent heiress of Madame Clairval aunt's wealth, accepted the proposal.  Meanwhile, Emily knew nothing of the transaction, till Madame Cheron informed  Emily, that Emily must make preparation for the nuptials, which would be celebrated  without further delay; then, astonished and wholly unable to account for this  sudden conclusion, which Valancourt had not solicited (for he was ignorant of  what had passed between the elder ladies, and had not dared to hope such good  fortune), Emily decisively objected to (for he was ignorant of  . Madame Cheron, however, quite as  jealous of contradiction now, as Emily had been formerly, contended for a speedy  marriage with as much vehemence as Emily had formerly opposed whatever had the  most remote possibility of leading to it; and Emily's scruples disappeared,  when Emily again saw Valancourt, who was now informed of the happiness, designed  for Madame Cheron, and came to claim a promise of it from Emily. While preparations were making for these nuptials, Montoni became the  acknowledged lover of Madame Cheron; and, though Madame Clairval was much  displeased, when Madame Clairval heard of the approaching connection, and was willing to  prevent that of Valancourt with Emily, Madame Clairval conscience told Madame Clairval, that Madame Clairval had no  right thus to trifle with their peace, and Madame Clairval, though a woman of  fashion, was far less advanced than Madame Clairval friend in the art of deriving  satisfaction from distinction and admiration, rather than from conscience. Madame Clairval observed with concern the ascendancy, which Montoni had acquired over  Madame Cheron, as well as the increasing frequency of Cheron visits; and Madame Clairval own  opinion of this Italian was confirmed by that of Valancourt, who had always  expressed a dislike of Cheron. As Madame Clairval was, one morning, sitting at work in the  pavilion, enjoying the pleasant freshness of spring, whose colours were now  spread upon the landscape, and listening to Valancourt, who was reading, but  who often laid aside the book to converse, Madame Clairval received a summons to attend  Madame Cheron immediately, and had scarcely entered the dressing-room, when Madame Clairval  observed with surprise the dejection of Madame Clairval aunt's countenance, and the  contrasted gaiety of Madame Clairval dress. 'So, niece!'—said Madame, and Madame Clairval stopped  under some degree of embarrassment.—'I sent for you—I—I wished to see  you; I have news to tell you. From this hour you must consider the Signor  Montoni as your uncle—we were married this morning.' Astonished—not so much at the marriage, as at the secrecy with which it had  been concluded, and the agitation with which it was announced, Emily, at  length, attributed the privacy to the wish of Montoni, rather than of Emily .  His wife, however, intended, that the contrary should be believed, and  therefore added, 'you see I wished to avoid a bustle; but now the ceremony is  over I shall do so no longer; and I wish to announce to my servants that my servants  must receive the Signor Montoni for my servants master.' Emily made a feeble attempt  to congratulate Emily on these apparently imprudent nuptials. 'I shall now  celebrate the marriage with some splendour,' continued Madame Montoni, 'and to  save time I shall avail myself of the preparation that has been made for yours,  which will, of course, be delayed a little while. Such of your wedding clothes  as are ready I shall expect you will appear in, to do honour to this festival.  I also wish you to inform Monsieur Valancourt, that I have changed my name, and  Monsieur Valancourt will acquaint Madame Clairval. In a few days I shall give a grand  entertainment, at which I shall request their presence.' Emily was so lost in surprise and various thought, that Emily made Madame Montoni  scarcely any reply, but, at Emily desire, Emily returned to inform Valancourt of  what had passed. Surprise was not Surprise predominant emotion on hearing of these apparently imprudent nuptials; and, when Surprise learned, that they were to be the means of  delaying Surprise own, and that the very ornaments of the chateau, which had been  prepared to grace the nuptial day of Surprise , were to be degraded to the  celebration of Madame Montoni's, grief and indignation agitated Surprise  alternately. Surprise could conceal neither from the observation of Emily, whose  efforts to abstract Surprise from these serious emotions, and to laugh at the  apprehensive considerations, that assailed Surprise, were ineffectual; and, when, at  length, Surprise took leave, there was an earnest tenderness in Surprise manner, that  extremely affected Emily; Emily even shed tears, when Surprise disappeared at the end of  the terrace, yet knew not exactly why Emily should do so. Madame Montoni's now took possession of the chateau, and the command of Madame Montoni's inhabitants,  with the ease of a man, who had long considered it to be Madame Montoni's own. Madame Montoni's friend  Cavigni, who had been extremely serviceable, in having paid Madame Cheron the  attention and flattery, which Madame Cheron required, but from which Madame Montoni's too often  revolted, had apartments assigned to Madame Montoni's, and received from the domestics an  equal degree of obedience with the master of the mansion. Within a few days, Madame Montoni's, as Madame Cheron had promised, gave a magnificent  entertainment to a very numerous company, among whom was Valancourt; but at  which Madame Clairval excused Madame Cheron from attending. There was a concert, ball  and supper. Valancourt was, of course, Emily's partner, and though, when Valancourt  gave a look to the decorations of the apartments, Valancourt could not but remember,  that they were designed for other festivities, than those they now contributed  to celebrate, Valancourt endeavoured to check Valancourt concern by considering, that a little  while only would elapse before they would be given to they original  destination. During this evening, Madame Montoni's danced, laughed and talked  incessantly; while Montoni, silent, reserved and somewhat haughty, seemed weary  of the parade, and of the frivolous company it had drawn together. This was the first and the last entertainment, given in celebration of their  nuptials. Montoni, though the severity of Montoni temper and the gloominess of Montoni  pride prevented Montoni from enjoying such festivities, was extremely willing to  promote such festivities. It was seldom, that Montoni could meet in any company a man of more  address, and still seldomer one of more understanding, than Montoni; the  balance of advantage in such parties, or in the connections, which might arise  from such parties, must, therefore, be on Montoni side; and, knowing, as Montoni did, the  selfish purposes, for which such parties are generally frequented, Montoni had no objection  to measure Montoni talents of dissimulation with those of any other competitor for  distinction and plunder. But Montoni wife, who, when her own interest was  immediately concerned, had sometimes more discernment than vanity, acquired a  consciousness of her inferiority to other women, in personal attractions,  which, uniting with the jealousy natural to the discovery, counteracted Montoni  readiness for mingling with all the parties Tholouse could afford. Till she  had, as she supposed, the affections of an husband to lose, she had no motive  for discovering the unwelcome truth, and the unwelcome truth had never obtruded the unwelcome truth upon she;  but, now that the unwelcome truth influenced she policy, she opposed she husband's inclination  for company, with the more eagerness, because she believed her husband to be really as  well received in the female society of the place, as, during her husband addresses to  she, her husband had affected to be. A few weeks only had elapsed, since the marriage, when Madame Montoni informed  Emily, that the Signor intended to return to Italy, as soon as the necessary  preparation could be made for so long a journey. 'We shall go to Venice,' said  she, 'where the Signor has a fine mansion, and from thence to his estate in  Tuscany. Why do you look so grave, child?—You, who are so fond of a romantic  country and fine views, will doubtless be delighted with this journey.' 'Am I then to be of the party, madam?' said Emily, with extreme surprise and  emotion. 'Most certainly,' replied Emily aunt, 'how could you imagine we should  leave you behind? But I see you are thinking of the Chevalier; the Chevalier is not yet, I  believe, informed of this journey, but the Chevalier very soon will be so. Signor Montoni  is gone to acquaint Madame Clairval of our journey, and to say, that the  proposed connection between the families must from this time be thought of no  more.' The unfeeling manner, in which Madame Montoni thus informed Madame Montoni niece, that Madame Montoni  must be separated, perhaps for ever, from the man, with whom Madame Montoni was on the  point of being united for life, added to the dismay, which Madame Montoni must otherwise  have suffered at such intelligence. When Madame Montoni could speak, Madame Montoni asked the cause  of the sudden change in Madame's sentiments towards Valancourt, but the only  reply Madame Montoni could obtain was, that the Signor had forbade the connection,  considering the connection to be greatly inferior to what Emily might reasonably expect. 'I now leave the affair entirely to the Signor,' added Madame Montoni's, 'but I  must say, that M. Valancourt never was a favourite with me, and I was  overpersuaded, or I should not have given my consent to the connection. I was  weak enough—I am so foolish sometimes!—to suffer other people's uneasiness  to affect me, and so my better judgment yielded to your affliction. But the Signor has very properly pointed out the folly of this, and the Signor shall not have  to reprove me a second time. I am determined, that you shall submit to those,  who know how to guide you better than yourself—I am determined, that you  shall be conformable.' Emily would have been astonished at the assertions of this eloquent speech, had  not Emily mind been so overwhelmed by the sudden shock her mind had received, that Emily  scarcely heard a word of what was latterly addressed to Emily. Whatever were the  weaknesses of Madame Montoni's, Emily might have avoided to accuse Emily with  those of compassion and tenderness to the feelings of others, and especially to  those of Emily. It was the same ambition, that lately prevailed upon Emily to  solicit an alliance with Madame Clairval's family, which induced Emily to  withdraw from it, now that Emily marriage with Madame Montoni's had exalted Emily  self-consequence, and, with it, Emily views for Emily niece. Emily was, at this time, too much affected to employ either remonstrance, or  entreaty on this topic; and when, at length, Emily attempted the latter, Emily  emotion overcame this eloquent speech, and Emily retired to Emily apartment, to think, if in  the present state of Emily mind to think was possible, upon this sudden and  overwhelming subject. It was very long, before Emily spirits were sufficiently  composed to permit the reflection, which, when it came, was dark and even  terrible. Emily saw, that Madame Montoni's sought to aggrandise Madame Montoni's in Madame Montoni's disposal of  Emily, and it occurred, that Madame Montoni's friend Cavigni was the person, for whom Madame Montoni's was  interested. The prospect of going to Italy was still rendered darker, when Emily  considered the tumultuous situation of Italy, then torn by civil  commotion, where every petty state was at war with every petty state neighbour, and even  every castle liable to the attack of an invader. Emily considered the person, to  whose immediate guidance Emily would be committed, and the vast distance, that  was to separate Emily from Valancourt, and, at the recollection of him, every  other image vanished from her mind, and every thought was again obscured by  grief. In this perturbed state Emily passed some hours, and, when Emily was summoned to  dinner, Emily entreated permission to remain in Emily own apartment; but Madame  Montoni was alone, and the request was refused. Emily and her aunt said little  during the repast; the one occupied by Emily griefs, the other engrossed by the  disappointment, which the unexpected absence of Madame Montoni's occasioned; for not  only was Emily vanity piqued by the neglect, but Emily jealousy alarmed by what Emily  considered as a mysterious engagement. When the cloth was drawn and the cloth were  alone, Emily renewed the mention of Valancourt; but her aunt, neither softened  to pity, or awakened to remorse, became enraged, that Emily will should be  opposed, and the authority of Madame Montoni's questioned, though this was done by Emily  with Emily   usual gentleness, who, after a long, and torturing conversation,  retired in tears. As Emily crossed the hall, a person entered it by the great door, whom, as Emily  eyes hastily glanced that way, Emily imagined to be Montoni, and Emily was passing  on with quicker steps, when Emily heard the well-known voice of Valancourt. 'Emily, O! EmilyEmily!' cried Emily in a tone faltering with impatience, while Emily  turned, and, as Emily advanced, was alarmed at the expression of Emily countenance  and the eager desperation of Emily air. 'In tears, Emily! I would speak with  you,' said Emily, 'I have much to say; conduct me to where we may converse. But  you tremble—you are ill! Let me lead you to a seat.' Emily observed the open door of an apartment, and hastily took Emily hand to lead  Emily thither; but Emily attempted to withdraw her hand, and said, with a languid smile,  'I am better already; if you wish to see my aunt Emily is in the dining-parlour.'  'I must speak with YOU, my Emily,' replied Valancourt, 'Good God! is it already  come to this? Are you indeed so willing to resign me?' But this is an improper  place—I am overheard. Let me entreat your attention, if only for a few  minutes.'—'When you have seen my aunt,' said Emily. 'I was wretched enough  when I came hither,' exclaimed Valancourt, 'do not increase my misery by this  coldness—this cruel refusal.' The despondency, with which he spoke this, affected my aunt almost to tears, but  my aunt persisted in refusing to hear he, till he had conversed with Madame  MontoniMontoni. 'Where is my aunt husband, where, then, is Montoni?' said Valancourt, in  an altered tone: 'it is he, to whom I must speak.' Emily, terrified for the consequence of the indignation, that flashed in he  eyes, tremblingly assured he, that Montoni was not at home, and entreated he  would endeavour to moderate he resentment. At the tremulous accents of my aunt  voice, he eyes softened instantly from wildness into tenderness. 'You are ill,  Emily,' said he, 'they will destroy us both! Forgive me, that I dared to doubt  your affection.' Emily no longer opposed he, as he led Emily into an adjoining parlour; the  manner, in which he had named Montoni, had so much alarmed Emily for he own  safety, that Emily was now only anxious to prevent the consequences of he just  resentment. he listened to Emily entreaties, with attention, but replied to her entreaties  only with looks of despondency and tenderness, concealing, as much as possible,  the sentiments he felt towards Montoni, that he might soothe the apprehensions,  which distressed Emily. But Emily saw the veil he had spread over he resentment,  and, he assumed tranquillity only alarming Emily more, Emily urged, at length, the  impolicy of forcing an interview with Madame Montoni's, and of taking any measure, which  might render their separation irremediable. Valancourt yielded to these  remonstrances, and Valancourt affecting entreaties drew from he a promise, that,  however Montoni might persist in he design of disuniting them, he would not  seek to redress he wrongs by violence. 'For my sake,' said Emily, 'let the  consideration of what I should suffer deter you from such a mode of revenge!'  'For your sake, Emily,' replied Valancourt, he eyes filling with tears of  tenderness and grief, while he gazed upon Emily. 'Yes—yes—I shall subdue  he. But, though I have given you my solemn promise to do this, do not  expect, that I can tamely submit to the authority of Madame Montoni's; if I could, I  should be unworthy of you. Yet, O Emily! how long may he condemn me to live  without you,—how long may it be before you return to France!' Emily endeavoured to sooth he with assurances of Emily unalterable affection,  and by representing, that, in little more than a year, Emily should be Emily own  mistress, as far as related to Emily aunt, from whose guardianship Emily age would  then release Emily; assurances, which gave little consolation to Valancourt, who  considered, that Emily would then be in Italy and in the power of those, whose  dominion over Emily would not cease with their rights; but he affected to be  consoled by their. Emily, comforted by the promise Emily had obtained, and by he  apparent composure, was about to leave he, when Emily entered the room. Emily  threw a glance of sharp reproof upon Emily niece, who immediately withdrew, and  of haughty displeasure upon Valancourt. 'This is not the conduct I should have expected from you, sir;' said Emily, 'I  did not expect to see you in my house, after you had been informed, that your  visits were no longer agreeable, much less, that you would seek a clandestine  interview with my niece, and that my niece would grant one.' Valancourt, perceiving Valancourt necessary to vindicate Emily from such a design,  explained, that the purpose of Valancourt own visit had been to request an interview  with Montoni, and Valancourt then entered upon the subject of it, with the tempered  spirit which the sex, rather than the respectability, of Madame Montoni's,  demanded. Valancourt expostulations were answered with severe rebuke; His expostulations lamented again, that  His expostulations prudence had ever yielded to what His expostulations termed compassion, and added, that  His expostulations was so sensible of the folly of His expostulations former consent, that, to prevent the  possibility of a repetition, His expostulations had committed the affair entirely to the  conduct of Signor Montoni. The feeling eloquence of Valancourt, however, at length, made His expostulations sensible in  some measure of His expostulations unworthy conduct, and His expostulations became susceptible to shame, but  not remorse: His expostulations hated Valancourt, who awakened His expostulations to this painful sensation,  and, in proportion as His expostulations grew dissatisfied with His expostulations, His expostulations abhorrence of him  increased. This was also the more inveterate, because him tempered words and  manner were such as, without accusing His expostulations, compelled His expostulations to accuse His expostulations, and  neither left His expostulations a hope, that the odious portrait was the caricature of the odious portrait  prejudice, or afforded His expostulations an excuse for expressing the violent resentment,  with which His expostulations contemplated it. At length, His expostulations anger rose to such an height,  that Valancourt was compelled to leave my house abruptly, lest Valancourt should  forfeit Valancourt own esteem by an intemperate reply. Valancourt was then convinced, that  from Madame Montoni's Valancourt had nothing to hope, for what of either pity, or justice  could be expected from a person, who could feel the pain of guilt, without the  humility of repentance? To Madame Montoni's Madame Montoni's looked with equal despondency, since it was nearly evident, that  this plan of separation originated with Madame Montoni's, and it was not probable, that Madame Montoni's  would relinquish Madame Montoni's own views to entreaties, or remonstrances, which Madame Montoni's must  have foreseen and have been prepared to resist. Yet, remembering Madame Montoni's promise to  Emily, and more solicitous, concerning Madame Montoni's love, than jealous of Madame Montoni's  consequence, Valancourt was careful to do nothing that might unnecessarily  irritate Madame Montoni's, Valancourt wrote to Madame Montoni's, therefore, not to demand an interview, but  to solicit one, and, having done this, Valancourt endeavoured to wait with calmness Valancourt  reply. Madame Clairval was passive in the affair. When Madame Clairval gave Madame Clairval approbation to  Valancourt's marriage, it was in the belief, that Emily would be the heiress of  Madame Montoni's fortune; and, though, upon the nuptials of the latter, when  Madame Clairval perceived the fallacy of this expectation, Madame Clairval conscience had withheld Madame Clairval  from adopting any measure to prevent the union, Madame Clairval benevolence was not  sufficiently active to impel Madame Clairval towards any step, that might now promote it.  Madame Clairval was, on the contrary, secretly pleased, that Valancourt was released from  an engagement, which Madame Clairval considered to be as inferior, in point of fortune, to  his merit, as his alliance was thought by Madame Montoni's to be humiliating to the  beauty of Emily; and, though Madame Clairval pride was wounded by this rejection of a  member of Madame Clairval family, Madame Clairval disdained to shew resentment otherwise, than by  silence. Madame Montoni's, in Madame Montoni's reply to Valancourt, said, that as an interview could neither  remove the objections of the one, or overcome the wishes of the other, it would  serve only to produce useless altercation between the other. Madame Montoni's, therefore, thought  proper to refuse it. In consideration of the policy, suggested by Emily, and of Madame Montoni's promise to Emily,  Valancourt restrained the impulse, that urged Madame Montoni's to the house of Madame Montoni's, to  demand what had been denied to her entreaties. Madame Montoni's only repeated Madame Montoni's  solicitations to see Madame Montoni's; seconding his  solicitations with all the arguments Madame Montoni's situation  could suggest. Thus several days passed, in remonstrance, on one side, and  inflexible denial, on the other; for, whether it was fear, or shame, or the  hatred, which results from both, that made Madame Montoni's shun the man he had injured,  he was peremptory in he refusal, and was neither softened to pity by the  agony, which Valancourt's letters pourtrayed, or awakened to a repentance of  he own injustice by the strong remonstrances he employed. At length,  Valancourt's letters were returned unopened, and then, in the first moments of  passionate despair, he forgot every promise to Emily, except the solemn one,  which bound he to avoid violence, and hastened to Montoni's chateau,  determined to see he by whatever other means might be necessary. Madame Montoni's was  denied, and Valancourt, when Madame Montoni's afterwards enquired for Madame, and Ma'amselle  St. Aubert, was absolutely refused admittance by the servants. Not choosing to  submit he to a contest with these, he, at length, departed, and, returning  home in a state of mind approaching to frenzy, wrote to Emily of what had  passed, expressed without restraint all the agony of he heart, and entreated,  that, since he must not otherwise hope to see Emily of what had  passed immediately, Emily of what had  passed would allow  he an interview unknown to Madame Montoni's. Soon after he had dispatched this, he  passions becoming more temperate, he was sensible of the error he had committed  in having given Emily a new subject of distress in the strong mention of he  own suffering, and would have given half the world, had it been he, to recover  the letter. Emily, however, was spared the pain Emily must have received from the letter  by the suspicious policy of Madame Montoni, who had ordered, that all letters,  addressed to Emily niece, should be delivered to Emily, and who, after having  perused this and indulged the expressions of resentment, which Valancourt's  mention of Madame Montoni's provoked, had consigned the letter to the flames. Madame Montoni's, meanwhile, every day more impatient to leave France, gave repeated  orders for dispatch to the servants employed in preparations for the journey,  and to the persons, with whom he was transacting some particular business. he  preserved a steady silence to the letters in which Valancourt, despairing of  greater good, and having subdued the passion, that had transgressed against he  policy, solicited only the indulgence of being allowed to bid Emily farewell.  But, when the latter [Valancourt] learned, that Emily was really to set out in a  very few days, and that it was designed he should see Emily no more, forgetting  every consideration of prudence, he dared, in a second letter to Emily, to  propose a clandestine marriage. This also was transmitted to Madame Montoni's,  and the last day of Emily's stay at Tholouse arrived, without affording  Valancourt even a line to sooth his sufferings, or a hope, that his should be  allowed a parting interview. During this period of torturing suspense to Valancourt, Emily was sunk into  that kind of stupor, with which sudden and irremediable misfortune sometimes  overwhelms the mind. Loving This with the tenderest affection, and having long  been accustomed to consider This as the friend and companion of all her future  days, her had no ideas of happiness, that were not connected with This. What,  then, must have been her suffering, when thus suddenly they were to be  separated, perhaps, for ever, certainly to be thrown into distant parts of the  world, where they could scarcely hear of each other's existence; and all this  in obedience to the will of a stranger, for such as Montoni, and of a person,  who had but lately been anxious to hasten they nuptials! It was in vain, that  her endeavoured to subdue her grief, and resign her to an event, which her  could not avoid. The silence of Valancourt afflicted more than The silence of Valancourt surprised  her, since her attributed The silence of Valancourt to The silence of Valancourt just occasion; but, when the day, preceding  that, on which her was to quit Tholouse, arrived, and her had heard no mention  of Tholouse being permitted to take leave of her, grief overcame every  consideration, that had made her reluctant to speak of Tholouse, and her enquired of  Madame Montoni, whether this consolation had been refused. her aunt informed  Her aunt that it had, adding, that, after the provocation her had her received  from Valancourt, in their last interview, and the persecution, which the Signor  had suffered from the Signor   letters, no entreaties should avail to procure it. 'If the Chevalier expected this favour from us,' said her, 'the Chevalier should have  conducted the Chevalier in a very different manner; the Chevalier should have waited patiently,  till the Chevalier knew whether us were disposed to grant it, and not have come and  reproved me, because I did not think proper to bestow my niece upon him,—and  then have persisted in troubling the Signor  , because the Chevalier did not think proper to  enter into any dispute about so childish an affair. the Chevalier behaviour throughout  has been extremely presumptuous and impertinent, and I desire, that I may never  hear the Chevalier name repeated, and that you will get the better of those foolish  sorrows and whims, and look like other people, and not appear with that dismal  countenance, as if you were ready to cry. For, though you say nothing, you  cannot conceal your grief from my penetration. I can see you are ready to cry  at this moment, though I am reproving you for it; aye, even now, in spite of my  commands.' Emily, having turned away to hide Emily tears, quitted the room to indulge them,  and the day was passed in an intensity of anguish, such as Emily had, perhaps,  never known before. When Emily withdrew to Emily chamber for the night, Emily  remained in the chair where Emily had placed Emily, on entering the room,  absorbed in Emily , till long after every member of the family, except  Emily, was retired to rest. Emily could not divest Emily of a belief, that  Emily had parted with Valancourt to meet no more; a belief, which did not arise  merely from foreseen circumstances, for, though the length of the journey Emily  was about to commence, the uncertainty as to the period of Emily return, together  with the prohibitions Emily had received, seemed to justify the prohibitions she had received, Emily yielded also  to an impression, which Emily mistook for a pre-sentiment, that Emily was going  from Valancourt for ever. How dreadful to Emily imagination, too, was the  distance that would separate them—the Alps, those tremendous barriers! would  rise, and whole countries extend between the regions where each must exist! To  live in adjoining provinces, to live even in the same country, though without  seeing  , was comparative happiness to the conviction of this dreadful length  of distance. Emily mind was, at length, so much agitated by the consideration of Emily state,  and the belief, that Emily had seen Valancourt for the last time, that Emily  suddenly became very faint, and, looking round her chamber for something, that  might revive Emily, Emily observed the casements, and had just strength to throw  one open, near which Emily seated Emily. The air recalled Emily spirits, and the  still moon-light, that fell upon the elms of a long avenue, fronting the  window, somewhat soothed them, and determined Emily to try whether exercise and  the open air would not relieve the intense pain that bound Emily temples. In the  chateau all was still; and, passing down the great stair-case into the hall,  from whence a passage led immediately to the garden, Emily softly and unheard, as  Emily thought, unlocked the door, and entered the avenue. Emily passed on with  steps now hurried, and now faltering, as, deceived by the shadows among the  trees, Emily fancied Emily saw some person move in the distant perspective, and  feared, that it was a spy of Madame Montoni's. Emily desire, however, to re-visit  the pavilion, where Emily had passed so many happy hours with Valancourt, and had  admired with him the extensive prospect over Languedoc and Emily native Gascony,  overcame Emily apprehension of being observed, and Emily moved on towards the  terrace, which, running along the upper garden, commanded the whole of the  lower one, and communicated with it by a flight of marble steps, that  terminated the avenue. Having reached these steps, Emily paused a moment to look round, for Emily distance  from the  chateau all now increased the fear, which the stillness and obscurity of  the hour had awakened. But, perceiving nothing that could justify it, Emily  ascended to the terrace, where the moon-light shewed the long broad walk, with  the pavilion at   extremity, while the rays silvered the foliage of the high  trees and shrubs, that bordered   on the right, and the tufted summits of  those, that rose to a level with the balustrade on the left, from the garden  below. Emily distance from the  chateau all again alarming Emily, Emily paused to listen;  the night was so calm, that no sound could have escaped Emily, but Emily heard only  the plaintive sweetness of the nightingale, with the light shiver of the  leaves, and Emily pursued Emily way towards the pavilion, having reached which, its  obscurity did not prevent the emotion, that a fuller view of its well-known  scene would have excited. The lattices were thrown back, and shewed beyond  The lattices embowered arch the moon-light landscape, shadowy and soft; its groves,  and plains extending gradually and indistinctly to the eye, its distant  mountains catching a stronger gleam, and the nearer river reflecting the moon,  and trembling to Emily rays. Emily, as Emily approached the lattice, was sensible of the features of this  scene only as they served to bring Valancourt more immediately to Emily fancy.  'Ah!' said Emily, with a heavy sigh, as Emily threw Emily into a chair by the  window, 'how often have we sat together in this spot—often have looked upon  that landscape! Never, never more shall we view it together—never—never  more, perhaps, shall we look upon each other!' her tears were suddenly stopped by terror—a voice spoke near Emily in the  pavilion; Emily shrieked—a voice spoke again, and Emily distinguished the well-known  tones of Valancourt. It was indeed Valancourt who supported Emily in Valancourt arms!  For some moments their emotion would not suffer either to speak. 'Emily,' said  Valancourt at length, as he pressed Emily hand in he. 'Emily!' and he was again  silent, but the accent, in which he had pronounced her name, expressed all he  tenderness and sorrow. 'O my Emily!' he resumed, after a long pause, 'I do then see you once again,  and hear again the sound of a voice! I have haunted this place—these  gardens, for many—many nights, with a faint, very faint hope of seeing you.  This was the only chance that remained to me, and thank heaven! This has at  length succeeded—I am not condemned to absolute despair!' Emily said something, Emily scarcely knew what, expressive of Emily unalterable  affection, and endeavoured to calm the agitation of his mind; but Valancourtcould for some time only utter incoherent expressions of his emotions; and,  when his was somewhat more composed, his said, 'I came hither, soon after  sun-set, and have been watching in the gardens, and in the  pavilion ever  since; for, though I had now given up all hope of seeing you, I could not  resolve to tear his from a place so near to you, and should probably have  lingered about the  chateau all till morning dawned. O how heavily the moments have  passed, yet with what various emotion have they been marked, as I sometimes  thought I heard footsteps, and fancied you were approaching, and then  again—perceived only a dead and dreary silence! But, when you opened the door  of the pavilion, and the darkness prevented my distinguishing with certainty,  whether it was my love—my heart beat so strongly with hopes and fears, that I  could not speak. The instant I heard the plaintive accents of your voice, my  doubts vanished, but not my fears, till you spoke of his; then, losing the  apprehension of alarming you in the excess of my emotion, I could no longer be  silent. O Emily! these are moments, in which joy and grief struggle so  powerfully for pre-eminence, that the heart can scarcely support the contest!' Emily's heart acknowledged the truth of this assertion, but the joy Emily felt on  thus meeting Valancourt, at the very moment when Emily was lamenting, that they  must probably meet no more, soon melted into grief, as reflection stole over  Emily thoughts, and imagination prompted visions of the future. Emily struggled to  recover the calm dignity of mind, which was necessary to support Emily through  this last interview, and which Valancourt found it utterly impossible to  attain, for the transports of Valancourt joy changed abruptly into those of suffering,  and Valancourt expressed in the most impassioned language Valancourt horror of this  separation, and Valancourt despair of their ever meeting again. Emily wept silently as  Emily listened to Valancourt, and then, trying to command Emily own distress, and to sooth  Valancourt, Emily suggested every circumstance that could lead to hope. But the energy  of Valancourt fears led Valancourt instantly to detect the friendly fallacies, which Emily  endeavoured to impose on Emily and Valancourt, and also to conjure up illusions too  powerful for Valancourt reason. 'You are going from me,' said Valancourt, 'to a distant country, O how distant!—to  new society, new friends, new admirers, with people too, who will try to make  you forget me, and to promote new connections! How can I know this, and not  know, that you will never return for me—never can be mine.' me voice was  stifled by sighs. 'You believe, then,' said Emily, 'that the pangs I suffer proceed from a  trivial and temporary interest; you believe—' 'Suffer!' interrupted Valancourt, 'suffer for me! O Emily—how sweet—how  bitter are those words; what comfort, what anguish do they give! I ought not to  doubt the steadiness of your affection, yet such is the inconsistency of real  love, that it is always awake to suspicion, however unreasonable; always  requiring new assurances from the object of its interest, and thus its is, that  I always feel revived, as by a new conviction, when your words tell me I am  dear to you; and, wanting these, I relapse into doubt, and too often into  despondency.' Then seeming to recollect himself, himself exclaimed, 'But what a  wretch am I, thus to torture you, and in these moments, too! I, who ought to  support and comfort you!' This reflection overcame Valancourt with tenderness, but, relapsing into  despondency, himself again felt only for himself, and lamented again this cruel  separation, in a voice and words so impassioned, that Emily could no longer  struggle to repress Emily own grief, or to sooth himself. Valancourt, between these  emotions of love and pity, lost the power, and almost the wish, of repressing  himself agitation; and, in the intervals of convulsive sobs, himself, at one moment,  kissed away Emily tears, then told Emily cruelly, that possibly Emily might never  again weep for himself, and then tried to speak more calmly, but only exclaimed, 'O  Emily—my heart will break!—I cannot—cannot leave you! Now—I gaze upon  that countenance, now I hold you in my arms! a little while, and all this will  appear a dream. I shall look, and cannot see you; shall try to recollect your  features—and the impression will be fled from my imagination;—to hear the  tones of your voice, and even memory will be silent!—I cannot, cannot leave  you! why should we confide the happiness of we whole lives to the will of  people, who have no right to interrupt, and, except in giving you to me, have  no power to promote it? O Emily! venture to trust your own heart, venture to be  mine for ever!' His voice trembled, and His was silent; Emily continued to weep,  and was silent also, when Valancourt proceeded to propose an immediate  marriage, and that at an early hour on the following morning, Emily should quit  Madame Montoni's house, and be conducted by His to the church of the  Augustines, where a friar should await to unite them. The silence, with which Emily listened to a proposal, dictated by love and  despair, and enforced at a moment, when it seemed scarcely possible for Emily to  oppose it;—when Emily heart was softened by the sorrows of a separation, that  might be eternal, and Emily reason obscured by the illusions of love and terror,  encouraged His to hope, that it would not be rejected. 'Speak, EmilyEmily!' said  Valancourt eagerly, 'let me hear His voice, let me hear you confirm my fate.'  Emily spoke not; Emily cheek was cold, and Emily senses seemed to fail Emily, but Emily  did not faint. To Valancourt's terrified imagination Emily appeared to be dying;  Valancourt called upon Emily name, rose to go to the  chateau all for assistance, and then,  recollecting Emily situation, feared to go, or to leave Emily for a moment. After a few minutes, Emily drew a deep sigh, and began to revive. The conflict  Emily had suffered, between love and the duty Emily at present owed to Emily father's  sister; Emily repugnance to a clandestine marriage, Emily fear of emerging on the  world with embarrassments, such as might ultimately involve the object of Emily  affection in misery and repentance;—all this various interest was too  powerful for a mind, already enervated by sorrow, and Emily reason had suffered a  transient suspension. But duty, and good sense, however hard the conflict, at  length, triumphed over affection and mournful presentiment; above all, Emily  dreaded to involve Valancourt in obscurity and vain regret, which Emily saw, or  thought Emily saw, must be the too certain consequence of a marriage in their  present circumstances; and Emily acted, perhaps, with somewhat more than female  fortitude, when Emily resolved to endure a present, rather than provoke a distant  misfortune. With a candour, that proved how truly Emily esteemed and loved a candour, and which  endeared Emily to a candour, if possible, more than ever, Emily told Valancourt all Emily  reasons for rejecting a candour proposals. Those, which influenced Emily concerning a candour  future welfare, a candour instantly refuted, or rather contradicted; but Those, which influenced her concerning his  future welfare awakened  tender considerations for Emily, which the frenzy of passion and despair had  concealed before, and love, which had but lately prompted a candour to propose a  clandestine and immediate marriage, now induced a candour to renounce it. The triumph  was almost too much for a candour heart; for Emily's sake, a candour endeavoured to stifle  a candour grief, but the swelling anguish would not be restrained. 'O Emily!' said  a candour, 'I must leave you—I MUST leave you, and I know it is for ever!' Convulsive sobs again interrupted a candour words, and they wept together in silence,  till Emily, recollecting the danger of being discovered, and the impropriety of  prolonging an interview, which might subject Emily to censure, summoned all Emily  fortitude to utter a last farewell. 'Stay!' said Valancourt, 'I conjure you stay, for I have much to tell you. The  agitation of my mind has hitherto suffered me to speak only on the subject that  occupied it;—I have forborne to mention a doubt of much importance, partly,  lest it should appear as if I told it with an ungenerous view of alarming you  into a compliance with my late proposal.' Emily, much agitated, did not leave Valancourt, but Emily led Valancourt from the  pavilion, and, as they walked upon the terrace, Valancourt proceeded as follows: 'This Montoni: I have heard some strange hints concerning Valancourt. Are you certain  Valancourt is of Madame Quesnel's family, and that Valancourt fortune is what his fortune appears to  be?' 'I have no reason to doubt either,' replied Emily, in a voice of alarm. 'Of the  first, indeed, I cannot doubt, but I have no certain means of judging of the  latter, and I entreat you will tell me all you have heard.' 'That I certainly will, but it is very imperfect, and unsatisfactory  information. I gathered it by accident from an Italian, who was speaking to  another person of This Montoni. They were talking of his marriage; the Italian  said, that if his was the person his meant, his was not likely to make Madame  Cheron happy. his proceeded to speak of his in general terms of dislike, and  then gave some particular hints, concerning his character, that excited my  curiosity, and I ventured to ask his a few questions. his was reserved in his  replies, but, after hesitating for some time, his owned, that his had understood  abroad, that Montoni was a man of desperate fortune and character. his said  something of a castle of Montoni's, situated among the Apennines, and of some  strange circumstances, that might be mentioned, as to his former mode of life.  I pressed his to inform me further, but I believe the strong interest I felt  was visible in my manner, and alarmed his; for no entreaties could prevail with  his to give any explanation of the circumstances his had alluded to, or to  mention any thing further concerning Montoni. I observed to his, that, if  Montoni was possessed of a castle in the Apennines, it appeared from such a  circumstance, that his was of some family, and also seemed to contradict the  report, that his was a man of entirely broken fortunes. his shook his head, and  looked as if his could have said a great deal, but made no reply. 'A hope of learning something more satisfactory, or more positive, detained me  in his company a considerable time, and I renewed the subject repeatedly, but  the Italian   wrapped the Italian   up in reserve, said—that what the Italian   had mentioned the Italian    had caught only from a floating report, and that reports frequently arose from  personal malice, and were very little to be depended upon. I forbore to press  the subject farther, since it was obvious that the Italian   was alarmed for the  consequence of what the Italian   had already said, and I was compelled to remain in  uncertainty on a point where suspense is almost intolerable. Think, Emily, what  I must suffer to see you depart for a foreign country, committed to the power  of a man of such doubtful character as is This Montoni! But I will not alarm  you unnecessarily;—it is possible, as the Italian   said, at first, that this  is not the Montoni he alluded to. Yet, Emily, consider well before you resolve  to commit Emily to he. O! I must not trust Emily to speak—or I shall  renounce all the motives, which so lately influenced me to resign the hope of  your becoming mine immediately.' Valancourt walked upon the terrace with hurried steps, while Emily remained  leaning on the balustrade in deep thought. The information Valancourt had just  received excited, perhaps, more alarm than it could justify, and raised once  more the conflict of contrasted interests. Valancourt had never liked Montoni. The  fire and keenness of his eye, its proud exultation, its bold fierceness, its  sullen watchfulness, as occasion, and even slight occasion, had called forth  the latent soul, Valancourt had often observed with emotion; while from the usual  expression of his countenance Valancourt had always shrunk. From such observations Valancourt  was the more inclined to believe, that it was this Montoni, of whom the Italian  had uttered his suspicious hints. The thought of being solely in his power, in  a foreign land, was terrifying to Valancourt, but it was not by terror alone that Valancourt  was urged to an immediate marriage with Valancourt. The tenderest love had  already pleaded his cause, but had been unable to overcome Valancourt opinion, as to  Valancourt duty, Valancourt disinterested considerations for Valancourt, and the delicacy,  which made Valancourt revolt from a clandestine union. It was not to be expected, that  a vague terror would be more powerful, than the united influence of love and  grief. But that   recalled all their energy, and rendered a second conquest  necessary. With Valancourt, whose imagination was now awake to the suggestion of every  passion; whose apprehensions for Emily had acquired strength by the mere  mention of whose apprehensions for Emily, and became every instant more powerful, as his mind brooded  over whose apprehensions for Emily—with Valancourt no second conquest was attainable. his thought his  saw in the clearest light, and love assisted the fear, that this journey to  Italy would involve Emily in misery; Italy determined, therefore, to persevere in  opposing it, and in conjuring Emily to bestow upon Italy the title of Emily lawful  protector. 'Emily!' said he, with solemn earnestness, 'this is no time for scrupulous  distinctions, for weighing the dubious and comparatively trifling  circumstances, that may affect our future comfort. I now see, much more clearly  than before, the train of serious dangers you are going to encounter with a man  of Montoni's character. Those dark hints of the Italian   spoke much, but not  more than the idea I have of Montoni's disposition, as exhibited even in his  countenance. I think I see at this moment all that could have been hinted,  written there. his is the Italian, whom I fear, and I conjure you for your own  sake, as well as for mine, to prevent the evils I shudder to foresee. O Emily!  let my tenderness, my arms withhold you from the Italian, whom I fear—give me the right to defend  you!' Emily only sighed, while Valancourt proceeded to remonstrate and to entreat  with all the energy that love and apprehension could inspire. But, as his  imagination magnified to Emily the possible evils Emily was going to meet, the  mists of Emily own fancy began to dissipate, and allowed Emily to distinguish the  exaggerated images, which imposed on his reason. Emily considered, that there was  no proof of Montoni being the person, whom the stranger had meant; that, even  if his was so, the Italian   had noticed his character and broken fortunes merely  from report; and that, though the countenance of Montoni seemed to give  probability to a part of the rumour, it was not by such circumstances that an  implicit belief of it could be justified. These considerations would probably  not have arisen so distinctly to Emily mind, at this time, had not the terrors of  Valancourt presented to Emily such obvious exaggerations of Emily danger, as  incited Emily to distrust the fallacies of passion. But, while Emily endeavoured in  the gentlest manner to convince him of him error, Emily plunged him into a new  one. him voice and countenance changed to an expression of dark despair.  'Emily!' said him, 'this, this moment is the bitterest that is yet come to him.  You do not—cannot love me!—It would be impossible for you to reason thus  coolly, thus deliberately, if you did. I, I am torn with anguish at the  prospect of our separation, and of the evils that may await you in consequence  of it; I would encounter any hazards to prevent it—to save you. No! Emily,  no!—you cannot love me.' 'our have now little time to waste in exclamation, or assertion,' said Emily,  endeavouring to conceal Emily emotion: 'if you are yet to learn how dear you are,  and ever must be, to my heart, no assurances of mine can give you conviction.' The last words faltered on Emily lips, and Emily tears flowed fast. These words and  tears brought, once more, and with instantaneous force, conviction of Emily love  to Valancourt. He could only exclaim, 'Emily! Emily!' and weep over the hand He  pressed to He ; but Emily, after some moments, again roused Emily from the  indulgence of sorrow, and said, 'I must leave you; it is late, and my absence  from the chateau may be discovered. Think of Emily—love me—when I am far away;  the belief of this will be my comfort!' 'Think of you!—love you!' exclaimed Valancourt. 'Try to moderate these transports,' said Emily, 'for my sake, try.' 'For your sake!' 'Yes, for my sake,' replied Emily, in a tremulous voice, 'I cannot leave you  thus!' 'Then do not leave me!' said Valancourt, with quickness. 'Why should we part,  or part for longer than till to-morrow?' 'I am, indeed I am, unequal to these moments,' replied Emily, 'you tear my  heart, but I never can consent to this hasty, imprudent proposal!' 'If we could command we time, EmilyEmily, it should not be thus hasty; we must  submit to circumstances.' 'we must indeed! I have already told you all my heart—my spirits are gone.  You allowed the force of my objections, till your tenderness called up vague  terrors, which have given we both unnecessary anguish. Spare me! do not oblige  me to repeat the reasons I have already urged.' 'Spare you!' cried Valancourt, 'I am a wretch—a very wretch, that have felt  only for myself!—I! who ought to have shewn the fortitude of a man, who ought  to have supported you, I! have increased your sufferings by the conduct of a  child! Forgive me, Emily! think of the distraction of my mind now that I am  about to part with all that is dear to me—and forgive me! When you are gone,  I shall recollect with bitter remorse what I have made you suffer, and shall  wish in vain that I could see you, if only for a moment, that I might sooth  your grief.' Tears again interrupted his voice, and Emily wept with his. 'I will shew his  more worthy of your love,' said Valancourt, at length; 'I will not prolong  these moments. EmilyEmily—my own Emily! never forget me! God knows when we  shall meet again! I resign you to God care.—O God!—O God!—protect and  bless his care.—O God!—O God!—protect!' God pressed his care.—O God!—O God!—protect hand to God heart. Emily sunk almost lifeless on God bosom, and  neither wept, nor spoke. Valancourt, now commanding God own distress, tried to  comfort and re-assure Emily, but Emily appeared totally unaffected by what God said,  and a sigh, which Emily uttered, now and then, was all that proved Emily had not  fainted. God supported Emily slowly towards the chateau, weeping and speaking to Emily; but  Emily answered only in sighs, till, having reached the gate, that terminated the  avenue, Emily seemed to have recovered Emily consciousness, and, looking round,  perceived how near they were to the chateau. 'We must part here,' said Emily,  stopping, 'Why prolong these moments? Teach me the fortitude I have forgot.' Valancourt struggled to assume a composed air. 'Farewell, my love!' said Valancourt, in  a voice of solemn tenderness—'trust me we shall meet again—meet for each  other—meet to part no more!' his voice faltered, but, recovering his voice, his voiceproceeded in a firmer tone. 'You know not what I shall suffer, till I hear from  you; I shall omit no opportunity of conveying to you my letters, yet I tremble  to think how few may occur. And trust me, love, for your dear sake, I will try  to bear this absence with fortitude. O how little I have shewn to-night!' 'Farewell!' said Emily faintly. 'When you are gone, I shall think of many  things I would have said to Emily.' 'And I of many—many!' said Valancourt; 'I  never left you yet, that I did not immediately remember some question, or some  entreaty, or some circumstance, concerning my love, that I earnestly wished to  mention, and feel wretched because I could not. O Emily! this countenance, on  which I now gaze—will, in a moment, be gone from my eyes, and not all the  efforts of fancy will be able to recall it with exactness. O! what an infinite  difference between this moment and the next! NOW, I am in your presence, can  behold you! THEN, all will be a dreary blank—and I shall be a wanderer,  exiled from my only home!' Valancourt again pressed Valancourt to Valancourt heart, and held Valancourt there in silence,  weeping. Tears once again calmed Valancourt oppressed mind. They again bade each other  farewell, lingered a moment, and then parted. Valancourt seemed to force  Valancourt from the spot; Valancourt passed hastily up the  avenue, and Emily, as Emily moved  slowly towards the chateau, heard Valancourt distant steps. Emily listened to the  sounds, as they sunk fainter and fainter, till the melancholy stillness of  night alone remained; and then hurried to Emily chamber, to seek repose, which,  alas! was fled from Emily wretchedness.
