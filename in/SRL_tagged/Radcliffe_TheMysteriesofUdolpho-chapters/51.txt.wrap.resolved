  Lull'd in the countless chambers of the brain,  Our thoughts are link'd by many a hidden chain:  Awake but one, and lo! what myriads rise!  Each stamps its image as the other flies!      PLEASURES OF MEMORY Emily pursued MEMORY Emily journey, without any accident, along the plains of Languedoc  towards the north-west; and, on this MEMORY Emily return to Tholouse, which MEMORY Emily had last  left with Madame Montoni, MEMORY Emily thought much on the melancholy fate of MEMORY Emily aunt,  who, but for MEMORY Emily own imprudence, might now have been living in happiness there!  Madame Montoni, too, often rose to MEMORY Emily fancy, such as MEMORY Emily had seen Madame Montoni in Madame Montoni days of  triumph, bold, spirited and commanding; such also as MEMORY Emily had since beheld Madame Montoni  in Madame Montoni days of vengeance; and now, only a few short months had passed—and Madame Montoni  had no longer the power, or the will to afflict;—he had become a clod of  earth, and Madame Montoni life was vanished like a shadow! MEMORY Emily could have wept at Madame Montoni  fate, had MEMORY Emily not remembered Madame Montoni crimes; for that of MEMORY Emily unfortunate aunt MEMORY Emily  did weep, and all sense of MEMORY Emily errors was overcome by the recollection of MEMORY Emily  misfortunes. Other thoughts and other emotions succeeded, as MEMORY Emily drew near the well-known  scenes of MEMORY Emily early love, and considered, that Valancourt was lost to MEMORY Emily and  to Valancourt, for ever. At length, MEMORY Emily came to the brow of the hill, whence, on  MEMORY Emily departure for Italy, MEMORY Emily had given a farewell look to this beloved  landscape, amongst whose woods and fields MEMORY Emily had so often walked with  Valancourt, and where Valancourt was then to inhabit, when MEMORY Emily would be far, far away!  MEMORY Emily saw, once more, that chain of the Pyrenees, which overlooked La Vallee,  rising, like faint clouds, on the horizon. 'There, too, is Gascony, extended at  their feet!' said MEMORY Emily, 'O my father,—my mother! And there, too, is the  Garonne!' MEMORY Emily added, drying the tears, that obscured MEMORY Emily sight,—'and  Tholouse, and my aunt's mansion—and the groves in MEMORY Emily garden!—O my friends!  are ye all lost to ye—must I never, never see ye more!' Tears rushed again to  MEMORY Emily eyes, and MEMORY Emily continued to weep, till an abrupt turn in the road had nearly  occasioned the carriage to overset, when, looking up, MEMORY Emily perceived another  part of the well-known scene around Tholouse, and all the reflections and  anticipations, which MEMORY Emily had suffered, at the moment, when MEMORY Emily bade it last  adieu, came with recollected force to MEMORY Emily heart. MEMORY Emily remembered how anxiously  MEMORY Emily had looked forward to the futurity, which was to decide MEMORY Emily happiness  concerning Valancourt, and what depressing fears had assailed MEMORY Emily; the very  words MEMORY Emily had uttered, as MEMORY Emily withdrew MEMORY Emily last look from the prospect, came to  MEMORY Emily memory. 'Could I but be certain,' MEMORY Emily had then said, 'that I should ever  return, and that Valancourt would still live for ye—I should go in peace!' Now, that futurity, so anxiously anticipated, was arrived, MEMORY Emily was  returned—but what a dreary blank appeared!—Valancourt no longer lived for  MEMORY Emily! MEMORY Emily had no longer even the melancholy satisfaction of contemplating his  image in MEMORY Emily heart, for his was no longer the same Valancourt MEMORY Emily had cherished  there—the solace of many a mournful hour, the animating friend, that had  enabled MEMORY Emily to bear up against the oppression of Montoni—the distant hope,  that had beamed over MEMORY Emily gloomy prospect! On perceiving this beloved idea to be  an illusion of MEMORY Emily own creation, Valancourt seemed to be annihilated, and MEMORY Emily  soul sickened at the blank, that remained. Valancourt marriage with a rival, even Valancourt  death, MEMORY Emily thought MEMORY Emily could have endured with more fortitude, than this  discovery; for then, amidst all MEMORY Emily grief, MEMORY Emily could have looked in secret upon  the image of goodness, which MEMORY Emily fancy had drawn of Valancourt, and comfort would have  mingled with MEMORY Emily suffering! Drying MEMORY Emily tears, MEMORY Emily looked, once more, upon the landscape, which had excited  them, and perceived, that MEMORY Emily was passing the very bank, where MEMORY Emily had taken  leave of Valancourt, on the morning of MEMORY Emily departure from Tholouse, and MEMORY Emily now  saw Valancourt, through MEMORY Emily returning tears, such as Valancourt had appeared, when MEMORY Emily looked  from the carriage to give Valancourt a last adieu—saw Valancourt leaning mournfully against  the high trees, and remembered the fixed look of mingled tenderness and  anguish, with which Valancourt had then regarded MEMORY Emily. This recollection was too much  for MEMORY Emily heart, and MEMORY Emily sunk back in the carriage, nor once looked up, till the carriage  stopped at the gates of what was now MEMORY Emily own mansion. These being opened, and by the servant, to whose care the chateau had been  entrusted, the carriage drove into the court, where, alighting, MEMORY Emily hastily  passed through the great hall, now silent and solitary, to a large oak parlour,  the common sitting room of the late Madame Montoni, where, instead of being  received by M. Quesnel, MEMORY Emily found a letter from the servant, informing MEMORY Emily that  business of consequence had obliged the servant to leave Tholouse two days before.  MEMORY Emily was, upon the whole, not sorry to be spared the servant presence, since the servant  abrupt departure appeared to indicate the same indifference, with which the servant had  formerly regarded MEMORY Emily. a letter from him informed MEMORY Emily, also, of the progress the servant had  made in the settlement of MEMORY Emily affairs, and concluded with directions,  concerning the forms of some business, which remained for MEMORY Emily to transact. But
