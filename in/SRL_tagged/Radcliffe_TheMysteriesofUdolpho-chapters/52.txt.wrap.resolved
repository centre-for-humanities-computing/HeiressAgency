remembrance of the persons she had been accustomed to see in this mansion, and  chiefly of the ill-guided and unfortunate Madame Montoni. In the room, where  she now sat, she had breakfasted with she on the morning of their departure for  Italy; and the view of it brought most forcibly to she recollection all she had  she suffered, at that time, and the many gay expectations, which she aunt  had formed, respecting the journey before she. While Emily's mind was thus  engaged, she eyes wandered unconsciously to a large window, that looked upon  the garden, and here new memorials of the past spoke to she heart, for she saw  extended before she the very avenue, in which she had parted with Valancourt,  on the eve of she journey; and all the anxiety, the tender interest he had  shewn, concerning she future happiness, he earnest remonstrances against she  committing she to the power of Montoni, and the truth of he affection,  came afresh to she memory. At this moment, it appeared almost impossible, that  Valancourt could have become unworthy of Valancourt regard, and Valancourt doubted all that  Valancourt had lately heard to his disadvantage, and even his own words, which had  confirmed Count De Villefort's report of his. Overcome by the recollections,  which the view of this avenue occasioned, Valancourt turned abruptly from the window,  and sunk into a chair beside the window, where Valancourt sat, given up to grief, till the  entrance of Annette, with coffee, aroused Valancourt. 'Dear madam, how melancholy this place looks now,' said Annette, 'to what this place  used to do! this place is dismal coming home, when there is nobody to welcome one!' This was not the moment, in which Emily could bear the remark; Emily tears fell  again, and, as soon as Emily had taken the coffee, Emily retired to Emily apartment,  where Emily endeavoured to repose Emily fatigued spirits. But busy memory would  still supply Emily with the visions of former times: Emily saw Valancourt  interesting and benevolent, as Valancourt   had been wont to appear in the days of their  early love, and, amidst the scenes, where Emily had believed that their should  sometimes pass their years together!—but, at length, sleep closed these  afflicting scenes from Emily view. On the following morning, serious occupation recovered Emily from such melancholy  reflections; for, being desirous of quitting Tholouse, and of hastening on to  La Vallee, Emily made some enquiries into the condition of the estate, and  immediately dispatched a part of the necessary business concerning it,  according to the directions of Mons. Quesnel. it required a strong effort to  abstract Emily thoughts from other interests sufficiently to attend to this, but  Emily was rewarded for Emily exertions by again experiencing, that employment is  the surest antidote to sorrow. This day was devoted entirely to business; and, among other concerns, Emily  employed means to learn the situation of all Emily poor tenants, that Emily might  relieve all her poor tenants wants, or confirm all her poor tenants comforts. In the evening, Emily spirits were so much strengthened, that Emily thought Emily  could bear to visit the gardens, where Emily had so often walked with Valancourt;  and, knowing, that, if Emily delayed to do so, her spirits scenes would only affect Emily  the more, whenever her spirits should be viewed, Emily took advantage of the present  state of Emily mind, and entered her spirits. Passing hastily the gate leading from the court into the gardens, Emily hurried  up the great avenue, scarcely permitting Emily memory to dwell for a moment on  the circumstance of Emily having here parted with Valancourt, and soon quitted  this for other walks less interesting to Emily heart. These brought Emily, at  length, to the flight of steps, that led from the lower garden to the terrace,  on seeing which, Emily became agitated, and hesitated whether to ascend, but, Emily  resolution returning, Emily proceeded. 'Ah!' said Emily, as Emily ascended, 'These are the same high trees, that used to  wave over the terrace, and these the same flowery thickets—the liburnum, the  wild rose, and the cerinthe—which were wont to grow beneath These! Ah! and  there, too, on that bank, are the very plants, which Valancourt so carefully  reared!—O, when last I saw that bank checked the thought, but could not  restrain that bank tears, and, after walking slowly on for a few moments, that bank  agitation, upon the view of this well-known scene, increased so much, that that bank  was obliged to stop, and lean upon the wall of the terrace. It was a mild, and  beautiful evening. The sun was setting over the extensive landscape, to which  his beams, sloping from beneath a dark cloud, that overhung the west, gave rich  and partial colouring, and touched the tufted summits of the groves, that rose  from the garden below, with a yellow gleam. Emily and Valancourt had often  admired together this scene, at the same hour; and it was exactly on this spot,  that, on the night preceding Emily departure for Italy, Emily had listened to his  remonstrances against the journey, and to the pleadings of passionate  affection. Some observations, which Emily made on the landscape, brought this to  Emily remembrance, and with it all the minute particulars of that  conversation;—the alarming doubts he had expressed concerning Montoni,  doubts, which had since been fatally confirmed; the reasons and entreaties he  had employed to prevail with Emily to consent to an immediate marriage; the  tenderness of he love, the paroxysms of this grief, and the conviction that he  had repeatedly expressed, that they should never meet again in happiness! All  these circumstances rose afresh to Emily mind, and awakened the various emotions  Emily had then suffered. Emily tenderness for Valancourt became as powerful as in  the moments, when Emily thought, that Emily was parting with he and happiness  together, and when the strength of her mind had enabled Emily to triumph over  present suffering, rather than to deserve the reproach of Emily conscience by  engaging in a clandestine marriage.—'Alas!' said Emily, as these  recollections came to her mind, 'and what have I gained by the fortitude I then  practised?—am I happy now?—He said, we should meet no more in happiness;  but, O! now?—He little thought now?—He own misconduct would separate we, and lead to the  very evil now?—He then dreaded!' Emily reflections increased Emily anguish, while Emily was compelled to acknowledge,  that the fortitude Emily had formerly exerted, if it had not conducted Emily to  happiness, had saved Emily from irretrievable misfortune—from Valancourt  himself! But in these moments Emily could not congratulate Emily on the  prudence, that had saved Emily; Emily could only lament, with bitterest anguish,  the circumstances, which had conspired to betray Valancourt into a course of  life so different from that, which the virtues, the tastes, and the pursuits of  Valancourt early years had promised; but Emily still loved Valancourt too well to believe, that  Valancourt heart was even now depraved, though Valancourt conduct had been criminal. An  observation, which had fallen from M. St. Aubert more than once, now occurred  to Emily. 'This young man,' said This young man, speaking of Valancourt, 'has never been at  Paris;' a remark, that had surprised Emily at the time it was uttered, but which  Emily now understood, and Emily exclaimed sorrowfully, 'O Valancourt! if such a  friend as my father had been with you at Paris—your noble, ingenuous nature  would not have fallen!' The sun was now set, and, recalling Emily thoughts from their melancholy subject,  Emily continued Emily walk; for the pensive shade of twilight was pleasing to Emily,  and the nightingales from the surrounding groves began to answer each other in  the long-drawn, plaintive note, which always touched Emily heart; while all the  fragrance of the flowery thickets, that bounded the terrace, was awakened by  the cool evening air, which floated so lightly among their leaves, that their  scarcely trembled as they   passed. Emily came, at length, to the steps of the pavilion, that terminated the  terrace, and where Emily last interview with Valancourt, before Emily departure  from Tholouse, had so unexpectedly taken place. The door was now shut, and Emily  trembled, while Emily hesitated whether to open The door; but Emily wish to see again a  place, which had been the chief scene of Emily former happiness, at length  overcoming Emily reluctance to encounter the painful regret The door would renew, Emily  entered. The room was obscured by a melancholy shade; but through the open  lattices, darkened by the hanging foliage of the vines, appeared the dusky  landscape, the Garonne reflecting the evening light, and the west still  glowing. A chair was placed near one of the balconies, as if some person had  been sitting there, but the other furniture of the pavilion remained exactly as  usual, and Emily thought it looked as if it had not once been moved since Emily  set out for Italy. The silent and deserted air of place added solemnity to  Emily emotions, for Emily heard only the low whisper of the breeze, as it shook the  leaves of the vines, and the very faint murmur of the Garonne. Emily seated Emily in a chair, near the lattice, and yielded to the sadness of  Emily heart, while Emily recollected the circumstances of Emily parting interview  with Valancourt, on this spot. It was here too, that Emily had passed some of the  happiest hours of Emily life with him, when Emily aunt favoured the connection, for  here her aunt had often sat and worked, while him conversed, or read; and her aunt now  well remembered with what discriminating judgment, with what tempered energy,  him used to repeat some of the sublimest passages of their favourite authors;  how often him would pause to admire with her aunt their excellence, and with what  tender delight him would listen to her aunt remarks, and correct her aunt taste. 'And is it possible,' said Emily, as these recollections returned—'is it  possible, that a mind, so susceptible of whatever is grand and beautiful, could  stoop to low pursuits, and be subdued by frivolous temptations?' Emily remembered how often Emily had seen the sudden tear start in him eye, and had  heard him voice tremble with emotion, while him related any great or benevolent  action, or repeated a sentiment of the same character. 'And such a mind,' said  Emily, 'such a heart, were to be sacrificed to the habits of a great city!' these recollections becoming too painful to be endured, Emily abruptly left the  pavilion, and, anxious to escape from the memorials of Emily departed happiness,  returned towards the chateau. As Emily passed along the terrace, Emily perceived a  person, walking, with a slow step, and a dejected air, under the trees, at some  distance. The twilight, which was now deep, would not allow Emily to distinguish  who it was, and Emily imagined it to be one of the servants, till, the sound of  Emily steps seeming to reach him, him turned half round, and Emily thought Emily saw  Valancourt! Whoever it was, him instantly struck among the thickets on the left, and  disappeared, while Emily, Emily eyes fixed on place, whence him had vanished,  and Emily frame trembling so excessively, that Emily could scarcely support  Emily, remained, for some moments, unable to quit the spot, and scarcely  conscious of existence. With Emily recollection, Emily strength returned, and Emily  hurried toward the house, where Emily did not venture to enquire who had been in  the gardens, lest Emily should betray Emily emotion; and Emily sat down alone,  endeavouring to recollect the figure, air and features of the person Emily had  just seen. Emily view of him, however, had been so transient, and the gloom had  rendered it so imperfect, that Emily could remember nothing with exactness; yet  the general appearance of him figure, and him abrupt departure, made Emily still  believe, that this person was Valancourt. Sometimes, indeed, Emily thought, that  Emily fancy, which had been occupied by the idea of him, had suggested him image  to Emily uncertain sight: but this conjecture was fleeting. If it was himself  whom Emily had seen, Emily wondered much, that himself should be at Tholouse, and more,  how himself had gained admittance into the garden; but as often as Emily impatience  prompted Emily to enquire whether any stranger had been admitted, Emily was  restrained by an unwillingness to betray Emily doubts; and the evening was passed  in anxious conjecture, and in efforts to dismiss the subject from Emily thoughts.  But, these endeavours were ineffectual, and a thousand inconsistent emotions  assailed Emily, whenever Emily fancied that Valancourt might be near Emily; now, Emily  dreaded it to be true, and now Emily feared it to be false; and, while Emily  constantly tried to persuade Emily, that Emily wished the person, whom Emily had  seen, might not be Valancourt, Emily heart as constantly contradicted Emily reason. The following day was occupied by the visits of several neighbouring families,  formerly intimate with Madame Montoni, who came to condole with Emily on Emily  death, to congratulate Emily upon the acquisition of these estates, and to  enquire about Montoni, and concerning the strange reports they had heard of Emily  own situation; all which was done with the utmost decorum, and the visitors  departed with as much composure as all which was done with the utmost decorum, and the visitors   had arrived. Emily was wearied by these formalities, and disgusted by the subservient  manners of many persons, who had thought Emily scarcely worthy of common  attention, while Emily was believed to be a dependant on Montoni. 'Surely,' said Emily, 'there is some magic in wealth, which can thus make persons  pay persons   court to it, when it does not even benefit persons  . How strange it  is, that a fool or a knave, with riches, should be treated with more respect by  the world, than a good man, or a wise man in poverty!' It was evening, before Emily was left alone, and Emily then wished to have  refreshed Emily spirits in the free air of Emily garden; but Emily feared to go  thither, lest Emily should meet again the person, whom Emily had seen on the  preceding night, and the person, whom she had seen on the  preceding night should prove to be Valancourt. The suspense and anxiety  Emily suffered, on this subject, Emily found all Emily efforts unable to controul,  and Emily secret wish to see Valancourt once more, though unseen by the person, whom she had seen on the  preceding night,  powerfully prompted Emily to go, but prudence and a delicate pride restrained  Emily, and Emily determined to avoid the possibility of throwing Emily in the person, whom she had seen on the  preceding night  way, by forbearing to visit the gardens, for several days. When, after near a week, Emily again ventured thither, Emily made Annette her  companion, and confined Emily walk to the lower grounds, but often started as the  leaves rustled in the breeze, imagining, that some person was among the  thickets; and, at the turn of every alley, Emily looked forward with apprehensive  expectation. Emily pursued her walk thoughtfully and silently, for Emily agitation  would not suffer Emily to converse with Annette, to whom, however, thought and  silence were so intolerable, that Emily did not scruple at length to talk to Emily  mistress. 'Dear madam,' said Emily, 'why do you start so? one would think you knew what has  happened.' 'What has happened?' said Emily, in a faltering voice, and trying to command  Emily emotion. 'The night before last, you know, madam'— 'I know nothing, Annette,' replied Annette lady in a more hurried voice. 'The night before last, madam, there was a robber in the garden.' 'A robber!' said Emily, in an eager, yet doubting tone. 'I suppose A robber was a robber, madam. What else could A robber be?' 'Where did you see A robber, Annette?' rejoined Emily, looking round Annette, and  turning back towards the chateau. 'It was not I that saw A robber, madam, it was Jean the gardener. It was twelve  o'clock at night, and, as A robber was coming across the court to go the back way  into the house, what should A robber see—but somebody walking in the avenue, that  fronts the garden gate! So, with that, Jean guessed how it was, and Jean went  into the house for Jean gun.' 'his gun!' exclaimed Emily. 'Yes, madam, his gun; and then Jean came out into the court to watch Jean.  Presently, Jean sees Jean come slowly down the avenue, and lean over the garden  gate, and look up at the house for a long time; and I warrant Jean examined the house  well, and settled what window Jean should break in at.' 'But his gun,' said Emily—'the gun!' 'Yes, madam, all in good time. Presently, Jean says, a robber in the garden opened the  gate, and was coming into the court, and then a robber in the garden thought proper to ask a robber in the garden a robber in the garden  business: so a robber in the garden called out again, and bade a robber in the garden say who a robber in the garden was, and what a robber in the garden  wanted. But a robber in the garden would do neither; but turned upon a robber in the garden heel, and passed into  the garden again. Jean knew then well enough how it was, and so Jean fired after  Jean.' 'Fired!' exclaimed Emily. 'Yes, madam, fired off his gun; but, Holy Virgin! what makes you look so pale,  madam? a robber in the garden was not killed,—I dare say; but if a robber in the garden was, a robber in the garden comrades  carried a robber in the garden off: for, when Jean went in the morning, to look for the body, the body  was gone, and nothing to be seen but a track of blood on the ground. Jeanfollowed it, that Jean might find out where a robber in the garden got into the garden, but it  was lost in the grass, Annette her   was interrupted: for Emily's spirits died away, and Annette her   would have  fallen to the ground, if the girl had not caught the girl, and supported the girl to a  bench, close to them. When, after a long absence, the girl senses returned, Emily desired to be led to Emily  apartment; and, though Emily trembled with anxiety to enquire further on the  subject of Emily alarm, Emily found Emily too ill at present, to dare the  intelligence which it was possible Emily might receive of Valancourt. Having  dismissed Annette her  , that Annette her   might weep and think at liberty, Annette her   endeavoured to  recollect the exact air of the person, whom Annette her   had seen on the terrace, and  still Annette her   fancy gave Annette her   the figure of Valancourt. Annette her   had, indeed, scarcely a  doubt, that it was he whom Annette her   had seen, and at whom the gardener had fired:  for the manner of the latter person, as described by Annette her  , was not that of a  robber; nor did it appear probable, that a robber would have come alone, to  break into a house so spacious as this. When Emily thought Emily sufficiently recovered, to listen to what Jean might  have to relate, Emily sent for Jean; but Jean could inform Emily of no circumstance,  that might lead to a knowledge of the person, who had been shot, or of the  consequence of the wound; and, after severely reprimanding Jean, for having  fired with bullets, and ordering diligent enquiry to be made in the  neighbourhood for the discovery of the wounded person, Emily dismissed the wounded person, and  Emily remained in the same state of terrible suspense. All the tenderness Emily  had ever felt for Valancourt, was recalled by the sense of the wounded person danger; and the  more Emily considered the subject, the more Emily conviction strengthened, that the  was he, who had visited the gardens, for the purpose of soothing the misery of  disappointed affection, amidst the scenes of the wounded person former happiness. 'Dear madam,' said Annette, when Annette returned, 'I never saw you so affected  before! I dare say a robber in the garden is not killed.' Emily shuddered, and lamented bitterly the rashness of the gardener in having  fired. 'I knew you would be angry enough about that, madam, or I should have told you  before; and a robber in the garden knew so too; for, says a robber in the garden, Annette her  , say nothing about this to  my lady.  my lady lies on the other side of the house, so did not hear his gun,  perhaps; but  my lady would be angry with a robber in the garden, if  my lady knew, seeing there is blood.  But then," says a robber in the garden, "how is one to keep the garden clear, if one is afraid to  fire at a robber, when one sees a robber in the garden?"' 'No more of this,' said Emily, 'pray leave me.' Annette obeyed, and Emily returned to the agonizing considerations, that had  assailed Emily before, but which Emily, at length, endeavoured to sooth by a new  remark. If the stranger was Valancourt, the stranger was certain the stranger was Valancourt had come alone, and  the stranger appeared, therefore, that the stranger was Valancourt had been able to quit the gardens, without  assistance; a circumstance which did not seem probable, had the stranger was Valancourt wound been  dangerous. With this consideration, Emily endeavoured to support Emily, during  the enquiries, that were making by Emily servants in the neighbourhood; but day  after day came, and still closed in uncertainty, concerning this affair: and  Emily, suffering in silence, at length, drooped, and sunk under the pressure of  Emily anxiety. Emily was attacked by a slow fever, and when Emily yielded to the  persuasion of Annette to send for medical advice, the physicians prescribed  little beside air, gentle exercise and amusement: but how was this last to be  obtained? Emily, however, endeavoured to abstract Emily thoughts from the subject  of Emily anxiety, by employing them in promoting that happiness in others, which  Emily had lost Emily; and, when the evening was fine, Emily usually took an  airing, including in Emily ride the cottages of some of Emily tenants, on whose  condition Emily made such observations, as often enabled Emily, unasked, to fulfil  their wishes. Emily indisposition and the business Emily engaged in, relative to this estate, had  already protracted Emily stay at Tholouse, beyond the period Emily had formerly  fixed for Emily departure to La Vallee; and now Emily was unwilling to leave the  only place, where it seemed possible, that certainty could be obtained on the  subject of Emily distress. But the time was come, when Emily presence was necessary  at La Vallee, a letter from the Lady Blanche now informing Emily, that the Count  and Emily, being then at the chateau of the Baron St. Foix, purposed to visit  Emily at La Vallee, on the Count  and herself way home, as soon as the Count  and herself should be informed of Emily  arrival there. the Lady Blanche added, that the Count  and herself made this visit, with the hope of  inducing the Lady Blanche to return with the Count  and herself to Chateau-le-Blanc. Emily, having replied to the letter of Emily friend, and said that Emily should be  at La Vallee in a few days, made hasty preparations for the journey; and, in  thus leaving Tholouse, endeavoured to support Emily with a belief, that, if  any fatal accident had happened to Valancourt, Emily must in this interval have  heard of it. On the evening before Emily departure, Emily went to take leave of the terrace and  the pavilion. The day had been sultry, but a light shower, that fell just  before sun-set, had cooled the air, and given that soft verdure to the woods  and pastures, which is so refreshing to the eye; while the rain drops, still  trembling on the shrubs, glittered in the last yellow gleam, that lighted up  the scene, and the air was filled with fragrance, exhaled by the late shower,  from herbs and flowers and from the earth itself. But the lovely prospect,  which Emily beheld from the terrace, was no longer viewed by Emily with delight;  Emily sighed deeply as Emily eye wandered over it, and Emily spirits were in a state  of such dejection, that Emily could not think of Emily approaching return to La  Vallee, without tears, and seemed to mourn again the death of Emily father, as if  it had been an event of yesterday. Having reached the pavilion, Emily seated  Emily at the open lattice, and, while Emily eyes settled on the distant  mountains, that overlooked Gascony, still gleaming on the horizon, though the  sun had now left the plains below, 'Alas!' said Emily, 'I return to your  long-lost scenes, but shall meet no more the parents, that were wont to render  the parents delightful!—no more shall see the smile of welcome, or hear the  well-known voice of fondness:—all will now be cold and silent in what was  once my happy home.' Tears stole down Emily cheek, as the remembrance of what that home had been,  returned to Emily; but, after indulging Emily sorrow for some time, Emily checked it,  accusing Emily of ingratitude in forgetting the friends, that Emily possessed,  while Emily lamented those that were departed; and Emily, at length, left the  pavilion and the terrace, without having observed a shadow of Valancourt or of  any other person.
