heart found almost heart first relief in conversing of heart parents, with a man,  whom heart so much revered, and who, though with such an ungracious appearance,  possessed to much goodness of heart and delicacy of mind. Several weeks passed away in quiet retirement, and Emily's affliction began to  soften into melancholy. heart could bear to read the books heart had before read  with heart father; to sit in her father chair in the library—to watch the flowers her father  hand had planted—to awaken the tones of that instrument her father fingers had  pressed, and sometimes even to play her father favourite air. When heart mind had recovered from the first shock of affliction, perceiving the  danger of yielding to indolence, and that activity alone could restore that activity alone  tone, heart scrupulously endeavoured to pass all heart hours in employment. And it  was now that heart understood the full value of the education heart had received  from St. Aubert, for in cultivating heart understanding he had secured heart an  asylum from indolence, without recourse to dissipation, and rich and varied  amusement and information, independent of the society, from which heart situation  secluded heart. Nor were the good effects of this education confined to selfish  advantages, since, St. Aubert having nourished every amiable qualify of St. Aubert  heart, St. Aubert now expanded in benevolence to all around St. Aubert, and taught St. Aubert, when  St. Aubert could not remove the misfortunes of others, at least to soften the misfortunes of others by  sympathy and tenderness;—a benevolence that taught St. Aubert to feel for all, that  could suffer. Madame Cheron returned no answer to Emily's letter, who began to hope, that St. Aubert  should be permitted to remain some time longer in St. Aubert retirement, and St. Aubert mind  had now so far recovered its strength, that St. Aubert ventured to view the scenes,  which most powerfully recalled the images of past times. Among she  should be permitted to remain some time longer in her retirement, and her mind  had now so far recovered its strength, that she ventured to view the scenes,  which most powerfully recalled the images of past times was the  fishing-house; and, to indulge still more the affectionate melancholy of the  visit, St. Aubert took thither St. Aubert lute, that St. Aubert might again hear there the tones, to  which St. Aubert and St. Aubert mother had so often delighted to listen. St. Aubert went  alone, and at that still hour of the evening which is so soothing to fancy and  to grief. The last time St. Aubert had been here St. Aubert was in company with Monsieur and  Madame St. Aubert, a few days preceding that, on which the latter was seized  with a fatal illness. Now, when Emily again entered the woods, that surrounded  the building, Madame St. Aubert, a few days preceding that, on which the latter was seized  with a fatal illness awakened so forcibly the memory of former times, that Emily  resolution yielded for a moment to excess of grief. Emily stopped, leaned for  support against a tree, and wept for some minutes, before Emily had recovered  Emily sufficiently to proceed. The little path, that led to the building, was  overgrown with grass and the flowers which St. Aubert had scattered carelessly  along the border were almost choked with weeds—the tall thistle—the  fox-glove, and the nettle. Emily often paused to look on the desolate spot, now  so silent and forsaken, and when, with a trembling hand, Emily opened the door of  the fishing-house, 'Ah!' said Emily, 'every thing—every thing remains as when I  left every thing last—left every thing with those who never must return!' Emily went to a window,  that overhung the rivulet, and, leaning over the rivulet, with Emily eyes fixed on the  current, was soon lost in melancholy reverie. The lute Emily had brought lay  forgotten beside Emily; the mournful sighing of the breeze, as it waved the high  pines above, and it softer whispers among the osiers, that bowed upon the  banks below, was a kind of music more in unison with Emily feelings. It did not  vibrate on the chords of unhappy memory, but was soothing to the heart as the  voice of Pity. Emily continued to muse, unconscious of the gloom of evening, and  that the sun's last light trembled on the heights above, and would probably  have remained so much longer, if a sudden footstep, without the building, had  not alarmed Emily attention, and first made Emily recollect that Emily was  unprotected. In the next moment, a door opened, and a stranger appeared, who  stopped on perceiving Emily, and then began to apologize for a stranger intrusion. But  Emily, at the sound of a stranger voice, lost Emily fear in a stronger emotion: its  tones were familiar to Emily ear, and, though Emily could not readily distinguish  through the dusk the features of the person who spoke, Emily felt a remembrance  too strong to be distrusted. a stranger repeated a stranger apology, and Emily then said something in reply, when a stranger eagerly advancing, exclaimed, 'Good God! can a stranger be—surely I am not  mistaken—ma'amselle St. Aubert?—is it not?' 'It is indeed,' said Emily, who was confirmed in Emily first conjecture, for Emily  now distinguished the countenance of Valancourt, lighted up with still more  than Valancourt usual animation. A thousand painful recollections crowded to Emily mind,  and the effort, which Emily made to support Emily, only served to increase Emily  agitation. Valancourt, meanwhile, having enquired anxiously after Emily health,  and expressed Valancourt hopes, that M. St. Aubert had found benefit from travelling,  learned from the flood of tears, which Emily could no longer repress, the fatal  truth. Valancourt led Emily to a seat, and sat down by Emily, while Emily continued to  weep, and Valancourt to hold the hand, which Emily was unconscious Valancourt had taken,  till it was wet with the tears, which grief for M. St. Aubert and sympathy for  Emily had called forth. 'I feel,' said Valancourt at length, 'I feel how insufficient all attempt at  consolation must be on this subject. I can only mourn with you, for I cannot  doubt the source of your tears. Would to God I were mistaken!' Emily could still answer only by tears, till Emily rose, and begged they might  leave the melancholy spot, when Valancourt, though Valancourt saw Emily feebleness, could  not offer to detain Emily, but took Emily arm within Valancourt, and led Emily from the  fishing-house. they walked silently through the woods, Valancourt anxious to  know, yet fearing to ask any particulars concerning M. St. Aubert; and Emily too  much distressed to converse. After some time, however, Emily acquired fortitude  enough to speak of Emily father, and to give a brief account of the manner of her father  death; during which recital Valancourt's countenance betrayed strong emotion,  and, when her father heard that M. St. Aubert had died on the road, and that Emily had  been left among strangers, her father pressed Emily hand between her father, and involuntarily  exclaimed, 'Why was I not there!' but in the next moment recollected her father,  for her father immediately returned to the mention of her father; till, perceiving that  Emily spirits were exhausted, her father gradually changed the subject, and spoke of  her father. Emily thus learned that, after they had parted, her father had wandered, for  some time, along the shores of the Mediterranean, and had then returned through  Languedoc into Gascony, which was her father native province, and where her father usually  resided. When her father had concluded her father little narrative, her father sunk into a silence, which Emily  was not disposed to interrupt, and his little narrative continued, till they reached the gate of  the chateau, when her father stopped, as if her father had known this to be the limit of her father  walk. Here, saying, that it was her father intention to return to Estuviere on the  following day, her father asked Emily   if Emily   would permit her father to take leave of Emily   in the  morning; and Emily, perceiving that Emily   could not reject an ordinary civility,  without expressing by Emily   refusal an expectation of something more, was  compelled to answer, that Emily   should be at home. Emily   passed a melancholy evening, during which the retrospect of all that had  happened, since Emily   had seen Valancourt, would rise to Emily   imagination; and the  scene of Emily   father's death appeared in tints as fresh, as if the  scene of her father's death had passed on  the preceding day. Emily   remembered particularly the earnest and solemn manner,  in which he had required Emily   to destroy the manuscript papers, and, awakening  from the lethargy, in which sorrow had held Emily  , Emily   was shocked to think Emily    had not yet obeyed he, and determined, that another day should not reproach  Emily   with the neglect.
