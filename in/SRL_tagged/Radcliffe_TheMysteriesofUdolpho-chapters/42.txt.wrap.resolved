   Is all the council that we two have shared,      the hours that we have spent,  When we have chid the hasty-footed time  For parting we—Oh! and is all forgot?   And will you rend we ancient love asunder?      MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM In the evening, when Emily was at length informed, that Count De Villefort  requested to see Emily, Emily guessed that Valancourt was below, and, endeavouring  to assume composure and to recollect all Emily spirits, Emily rose and left the  apartment; but on reaching the door of the library, where Emily imagined him to  be, Emily emotion returned with such energy, that, fearing to trust Emily in  the room, Emily returned into the hall, where Emily continued for a considerable  time, unable to command Emily agitated spirits. When Emily could recall them, Emily found in the library Valancourt, seated with  the Count, who both rose on Emily entrance; but Emily did not dare to look at  Valancourt, and the Count, having led Emily to a chair, immediately withdrew. Emily remained with Emily eyes fixed on the floor, under such oppression of  heart, that Emily could not speak, and with difficulty breathed; while Valancourt  threw Valancourt   into a chair beside Emily, and, sighing heavily, continued silent,  when, had Emily raised Emily eyes, Emily would have perceived the violent emotions,  with which Valancourt   was agitated. At length, in a tremulous voice, Valancourt   said, 'I have solicited to see you this  evening, that I might, at least, be spared the further torture of suspense,  which your altered manner had occasioned me, and which the hints I have just  received from the Count have in part explained. I perceive I have enemies,  Emily, who envied me my late happiness, and who have been busy in searching out  the means to destroy it: I perceive, too, that time and absence have weakened  the affection you once felt for me, and that you can now easily be taught to  forget me.' you can now easily be taught to  forget me last words faltered, and Emily, less able to speak than before, continued  silent. 'O what a meeting is this!' exclaimed Valancourt, starting from you can now easily be taught to  forget me seat, and  pacing the room with hurried steps, 'what a meeting is this, after our  long—long separation!' Again you can now easily be taught to  forget me sat down, and, after the struggle of a  moment, you can now easily be taught to  forget me added in a firm but despairing tone, 'This is too much—I cannot  bear This! Emily, will you not speak to Emily?' you can now easily be taught to  forget me covered you can now easily be taught to  forget me face with you can now easily be taught to  forget me hand, as if to conceal you can now easily be taught to  forget me emotion, and took  Emily's, which Emily did not withdraw. Emily tears could no longer be restrained;  and, when you can now easily be taught to  forget me raised you can now easily be taught to  forget me eyes and perceived that Emily was weeping, all you can now easily be taught to  forget me  tenderness returned, and a gleam of hope appeared to cross you can now easily be taught to  forget me mind, for you can now easily be taught to  forget me  exclaimed, 'O! you do pity me, then, you do love me! Yes, you are still my own  Emily—let me believe Her tears, that tell me so!' Emily now made an effort to recover Emily firmness, and, hastily drying Her tears,  'Yes,' said Emily, 'I do pity you—I weep for Emily—but, ought I to think of you  with affection? You may remember, that yester-evening I said, I had still  sufficient confidence in your candour to believe, that, when I should request  an explanation of your words, you would give an explanation of your words. an explanation of your words is now  unnecessary, I understand them too well; but prove, at least, that your candour  is deserving of the confidence I give your candour  , when I ask you, whether you are  conscious of being the same estimable Valancourt—whom I once loved.' 'Once loved!' cried he,—'the same—the same!' He paused in extreme emotion,  and then added, in a voice at once solemn, and dejected,—'No—I am not the  same!—I am lost—I am no longer worthy of you!' He again concealed He face. Emily was too much affected by this honest  confession to reply immediately, and, while Emily struggled to overcome the  pleadings of Emily heart, and to act with the decisive firmness, which was  necessary for Emily future peace, Emily perceived all the danger of trusting long  to Emily resolution, in the presence of Valancourt, and was anxious to conclude  an interview, that tortured them both; yet, when Emily considered, that this was  probably them last meeting, Emily fortitude sunk at once, and Emily experienced  only emotions of tenderness and of despondency. Valancourt, meanwhile, lost in emotions of remorse and grief, which Valancourt had  neither the power, or the will to express, sat insensible almost of the  presence of Emily, Valancourt features still concealed, and Valancourt breast agitated by  convulsive sighs. 'Spare me the necessity,' said Emily, recollecting her fortitude, 'spare me the  necessity of mentioning those circumstances of your conduct, which oblige me to  break our connection forever.—We must part, I now see you for the last time.' 'Impossible!' cried Valancourt, roused from Valancourt deep silence, 'You cannot mean  what you say!—you cannot mean to throw me from you forever!' 'We must part,' repeated Emily, with emphasis,—'and that forever! Your own  conduct has made this necessary.' 'This is the Count's determination,' said Valancourt haughtily, 'not you, and I shall  enquire by what authority Valancourt interferes between us.' Valancourt now rose, and walked  about the room in great emotion. 'Let me save you from this error,' said Emily, not less agitated—'it is my  determination, and, if you reflect a moment on your late conduct, you will  perceive, that my future peace requires it.' 'my future peace requires, that we should part—part forever!' said  Valancourt, 'How little did I ever expect to hear you say so!' 'And how little did I expect, that it would be necessary for me to say so!'  rejoined Emily, while Emily voice softened into tenderness, and Emily tears flowed  again.—'That you—you, Valancourt, would ever fall from my esteem!' Valancourt was silent a moment, as if overwhelmed by the consciousness of no longer  deserving this esteem, as well as the certainty of having lost it, and then,  with impassioned grief, lamented the criminality of Valancourt late conduct and the  misery to which it had reduced Valancourt, till, overcome by a recollection of the  past and a conviction of the future, Valancourt burst into tears, and uttered only deep  and broken sighs. The remorse Valancourt had expressed, and the distress Valancourt suffered could not be  witnessed by Emily with indifference, and, had Emily not called to Emily  recollection all the circumstances, of which Count De Villefort had informed  Emily, and all Count De Villefort had said of the danger of confiding in repentance, formed under  the influence of passion, Emily might perhaps have trusted to the assurances of  Emily heart, and have forgotten Valancourt misconduct in the tenderness, which that  repentance excited. Valancourt, returning to the chair beside Emily, at length, said, in a calm  voice, ''Tis true, I am fallen—fallen from my own esteem! but could you,  Emily, so soon, so suddenly resign, if you had not before ceased to love me,  or, if your conduct was not governed by the designs, I will say, the selfish  designs of another person! Would you not otherwise be willing to hope for my  reformation—and could you bear, by estranging me from you, to abandon me to  misery—to myself!'—Emily wept aloud.—'No, Emily—no—you would not do  this, if you still loved me. You would find your own happiness in saving mine.' 'There are too many probabilities against that hope,' said Emily, 'to justify  me in trusting the comfort of my whole life to it. May I not also ask, whether  you could wish me to do this, if you really loved me?' 'Really loved you!' exclaimed Valancourt—'is this possible you can doubt my  love! Yet this is reasonable, that you should do so, since you see, that I am  less ready to suffer the horror of parting with you, than that of involving you  in my ruin. Yes, Emily—I am ruined—irreparably ruined—I am involved in  debts, which I can never discharge!' Valancourt's look, which was wild, as Valancourt  spoke this, soon settled into an expression of gloomy despair; and Emily, while  Emily was compelled to admire Valancourt sincerity, saw, with unutterable anguish, new  reasons for fear in the suddenness of Valancourt feelings and the extent of the  misery, in which they might involve Valancourt. After some minutes, Emily seemed to  contend against Emily grief and to struggle for fortitude to conclude the  interview. 'I will not prolong these moments,' said Emily, 'by a conversation,  which can answer no good purpose. Valancourt, farewell!' 'You are not going?' said Valancourt, wildly interrupting her—'You will not leave me  thus—you will not abandon me even before my mind has suggested any  possibility of compromise between the last indulgence of my despair and the  endurance of my loss!' Emily was terrified by the sternness of Valancourt look, and  said, in a soothing voice, 'You have yourself acknowledged, that it is  necessary we should part;—if you wish, that I should believe you love me, you  will repeat the acknowledgment.'—'Never—never,' cried he—'I was  distracted when I made it. O! Emily—this is too much;—though you are not  deceived as to my faults, you must be deluded into this exasperation against  them. The Count is the barrier between us; but The Count shall not long remain so.' 'You are, indeed, distracted,' said Emily, 'The Count is not your enemy; on the  contrary, The Count is my friend, and that might, in some degree, induce you to  consider The Count as yours.'—'Your friend!' said Valancourt, hastily, 'how long  has The Count been your friend, that The Count can so easily make you forget your lover? Was  it he, who recommended to your favour the Monsieur Du Pont, who, you say,  accompanied you from Italy, and who, I say, has stolen your affections? But I  have no right to question you;—you are your own mistress. Du Pont, perhaps,  may not long triumph over my fallen fortunes!' Emily, more frightened than  before by the frantic looks of Valancourt, said, in a tone scarcely audible,  'For heaven's sake be reasonable—be composed. Du Pont is not your  rival, nor is the Count Du Pont advocate. You have no rival; nor, except yourself,  an enemy. My heart is wrung with anguish, which must increase while your  frantic behaviour shews me, more than ever, that you are no longer the  Valancourt I have been accustomed to love.' the  Valancourt made no reply, but sat with the  Valancourt arms rested on the table and the  Valancourt face  concealed by the  Valancourt hands; while Emily stood, silent and trembling, wretched for  Emily and dreading to leave the  Valancourt in this state of mind. 'O excess of misery!' the  Valancourt suddenly exclaimed, 'that I can never lament my  sufferings, without accusing the  Valancourt, nor remember you, without recollecting the  folly and the vice, by which I have lost you! Why was I forced to Paris, and  why did I yield to allurements, which were to make me despicable for ever! O!  why cannot I look back, without interruption, to those days of innocence and  peace, the days of our early love!'—The recollection seemed to melt the  Valancourt  heart, and the frenzy of despair yielded to tears. After a long pause, turning  towards Emily and taking Emily hand, the  Valancourt said, in a softened voice, 'Emily, can you  bear that we should part—can you resolve to give up an heart, that loves you  like mine—an heart, which, though it has erred—widely erred, is not  irretrievable from error, as, you well know, it never can be retrievable from  love?' Emily made no reply, but with tears. 'Can you,' continued the  Valancourt, 'can  you forget all our former days of happiness and confidence—when I had not a  thought, that I might wish to conceal from you—when I had no taste—no  pleasures, in which you did not participate?' 'O do not lead me to the remembrance of those days,' said Emily, 'unless you  can teach me to forget the present; I do not mean to reproach you; if I did, I  should be spared tears; but why will you render your present sufferings  more conspicuous, by contrasting tears with your former virtues?' 'your former virtues,' said Valancourt, 'might, perhaps, again be mine, if your  affection, which nurtured your former virtues, was unchanged;—but I fear, indeed, I see,  that you can no longer love me; else the happy hours, which we have passed  together, would plead for me, and you could not look back upon your former virtues unmoved.  Yet, why should I torture me with the remembrance of those days—why do I linger here?  Am I not ruined—would it not be madness to involve you in my misfortunes,  even if your heart was still my own? I will not distress you further. Yet,  before I go,' added he, in a solemn voice, 'let me repeat, that, whatever may  be my destiny—whatever I may be doomed to suffer, I must always love  you—most fondly love you! I am going, Emily, I am going to leave you—to  leave you, forever!' As he spoke the last words, a solemn voice trembled, and he  threw he again into the chair, from which he had risen. Emily was utterly  unable to leave the room, or to say farewell. All impression of he criminal  conduct and almost of he follies was obliterated from Emily mind, and Emily was  sensible only of pity and grief. 'My fortitude is gone,' said Valancourt at length; 'I can no longer even  struggle to recall Valancourt at length. I cannot now leave you—I cannot bid you an eternal  farewell; say, at least, that you will see me once again.' Emily's heart was  somewhat relieved by the request, and Emily endeavoured to believe, that Emily  ought not to refuse the request. Yet Emily was embarrassed by recollecting, that Emily was a  visitor in the house of the Count, who could not be pleased by the return of Valancourt. Other considerations, however, soon overcame this, and Emily granted  his request, on the condition, that his would neither think of the Count, as his  enemy, nor Du Pont as his rival. his then left Emily, with a heart, so much  lightened by this short respite, that his almost lost every former sense of  misfortune. Emily withdrew to Emily own room, that Emily might compose Emily spirits and remove  the traces of tears, which would encourage the censorious remarks of the  Countess and Emily favourite, as well as excite the curiosity of the rest of the  family. Emily found it, however, impossible to tranquillize her mind, from which  Emily could not expel the remembrance of the late scene with Valancourt, or the  consciousness, that Emily was to see him again, on the morrow. This meeting now  appeared more terrible to Emily than the last, for the ingenuous confession him  had made of him ill conduct and him embarrassed circumstances, with the  strength and tenderness of affection, which this confession discovered, had  deeply impressed Emily, and, in spite of all Emily had heard and believed to him  disadvantage, Emily esteem began to return. This meeting now   frequently appeared to Emily  impossible, that him could have been guilty of the depravities, reported of him,  which, if not inconsistent with him warmth and impetuosity, were entirely so  with him candour and sensibility. Whatever was the criminality, which had given  rise to the reports, Emily could not now believe the reports to be wholly true, nor that  him heart was finally closed against the charms of virtue. The deep  consciousness, which him felt as well as expressed of him errors, seemed to  justify the opinion; and, as Emily understood not the instability of youthful  dispositions, when opposed by habit, and that professions frequently deceive  those, who make, as well as those, who hear professions, Emily might have yielded to the  flattering persuasions of Emily own heart and the pleadings of Valancourt, had  Emily not been guided by the superior prudence of the Count. him represented to  Emily, in a clear light, the danger of Emily present situation, that of listening  to promises of amendment, made under the influence of strong passion, and the  slight hope, which could attach to a connection, whose chance of happiness  rested upon the retrieval of ruined circumstances and the reform of corrupted  habits. On these accounts, him lamented, that Emily had consented to a second  interview, for him saw how much it would shake Emily resolution and increase the  difficulty of Emily conquest. Emily mind was now so entirely occupied by nearer interests, that Emily forgot the  old housekeeper and the promised history, which so lately had excited Emily  curiosity, but which Dorothee was probably not very anxious to disclose, for  night came; the hours passed; and Emily did not appear in Emily's chamber. With  the latter it was a sleepless and dismal night; the more Emily suffered Emily  memory to dwell on the late scenes with Valancourt, the more Emily resolution  declined, and Emily was obliged to recollect all the arguments, which the Count  had made use of to strengthen it, and all the precepts, which Emily had received  from Emily deceased father, on the subject of self-command, to enable Emily to act,  with prudence and dignity, on this the most severe occasion of Emily life. There  were moments, when all Emily fortitude forsook Emily, and when, remembering the  confidence of former times, Emily thought it impossible, that Emily could renounce  Valancourt. she could renounce  Valancourt reformation then appeared certain; the arguments of Count De  Villefort were forgotten; Emily readily believed all Emily wished, and was willing  to encounter any evil, rather than that of an immediate separation. Thus passed the night in ineffectual struggles between affection and reason,  and Emily rose, in the morning, with a mind, weakened and irresolute, and a  frame, trembling with illness.
