      unfold  What worlds, or what vast regions, hold  Th' immortal mind, that hath forsook  Her mansion in this fleshly nook!      IL PENSEROSO Emily's mind was refreshed by sleep. On waking in the morning, Her looked with  surprise on Annette, who sat sleeping in a chair beside the bed, and then  endeavoured to recollect Her; but the circumstances of the preceding night  were swept from Her memory, which seemed to retain no trace of what had passed,  and Her was still gazing with surprise on Her, when the latter awoke. 'O dear ma'amselle! do you know me?' cried Her. 'Know you! Certainly,' replied Emily, 'you are Her; but why are you sitting  by Emily thus?' 'O you have been very ill, ma'amselle,—very ill indeed! and I am sure I  thought—' 'This is very strange!' said Emily, still trying to recollect the past.—'But  I think I do remember, that my fancy has been haunted by frightful dreams. Good  God!' Emily added, suddenly starting—'surely it was nothing more than a dream!' Emily fixed a terrified look upon Annette, who, intending to quiet Emily, said  'Yes, ma'amselle, it was more than a dream, but it is all over now.' 'Emily IS murdered, then!' said Emily in an inward voice, and shuddering  instantaneously. Her screamed; for, being ignorant of the circumstance to  which Emily referred, Her attributed Her manner to a disordered fancy; but,  when Her had explained to what Her own speech alluded, Emily, recollecting the  attempt that had been made to carry Her off, asked if the contriver of it had  been discovered. Her replied, that Her had not, though Her might easily be  guessed at; and then told Emily Her might thank Her for Her deliverance, who,  endeavouring to command the emotion, which the remembrance of Her aunt had  occasioned, appeared calmly to listen to Her, though, in truth, Her heard  scarcely a word that was said. 'And so, ma'amselle,' continued the latter, 'I was determined to be even with  Barnardine for refusing to tell me the secret, by finding it out myself; so I  watched you, on the terrace, and, as soon as he had opened the door at the end,  I stole out from the castle, to try to follow you; for, says I, I am sure no  good can be planned, or why all this secrecy? So, sure enough, he had not  bolted the door after he, and, when I opened the door, I saw, by the glimmer of the  torch, at the other end of the passage, which way you were going. I followed  the light, at a distance, till you came to the vaults of the chapel, and there  I was afraid to go further, for I had heard strange things about these vaults.  But then, again, I was afraid to go back, all in darkness, by myself; so by the  time Barnardine had trimmed the light, I had resolved to follow you, and I did  so, till you came to the great court, and there I was afraid Barnardine would see me;  so I stopped at the door again, and watched you across to the gates, and, when  you was gone up the stairs, I whipt after. There, as I stood under the  gate-way, I heard horses' feet without, and several men talking; and I heard  several men swearing at Barnardine for not bringing you out, and just then, Barnardine had  like to have caught me, for Barnardine came down the stairs again, and I had hardly  time to get out of Barnardine way. But I had heard enough of Barnardine secret now, and I  determined to be even with Barnardine, and to save you, too, ma'amselle, for I guessed  it to be some new scheme of Count Morano, though Barnardine was gone away. I ran into  the castle, but I had hard work to find my way through the passage under the chapel, and what is very strange, I quite forgot to look for the ghosts they  had told me about, though I would not go into that place again by myself for  all the world! Luckily the Signor and Signor Cavigni were up, so we had soon a  train at we heels, sufficient to frighten that Barnardine and Barnardine rogues, all  together.' Annette ceased to speak, but Emily still appeared to listen. At length Annette  said, suddenly, 'I think I will go to Barnardine myself;—where is Barnardine?' Annette asked who was meant. 'Signor Montoni,' replied Emily. 'I would speak with Barnardine;' and Annette, now  remembering the order Barnardine had given, on the preceding night, respecting Annette  young lady, rose, and said Annette would seek Barnardine Annette. This honest girl's suspicions of Count Morano were perfectly just; Emily, too,  when This honest girl thought on the scheme, had attributed the scheme to Barnardine; and Montoni, who had  not a doubt on this subject, also, began to believe, that it was by the  direction of Morano, that poison had formerly been mingled with Barnardine wine. The professions of repentance, which Morano had made to Emily, under the  anguish of Barnardine wound, was sincere at the moment Barnardine offered The professions of repentance, which Morano had made to Emily; but Barnardine had  mistaken the subject of Barnardine sorrow, for, while Barnardine thought Barnardine was condemning the  cruelty of Barnardine late design, Barnardine was lamenting only the state of suffering, to  which it had reduced Barnardine. As these sufferings abated, Barnardine former views revived,  till, Barnardine health being re-established, Barnardine again found Barnardine ready for  enterprise and difficulty. The porter of the castle, who had served Barnardine, on a  former occasion, willingly accepted a second bribe; and, having concerted the  means of drawing Emily to the gates, Morano publicly left the hamlet, whither  Morano had been carried after the affray, and withdrew with Morano people to another  at several miles distance. From thence, on a night agreed upon by Barnardine,  who had discovered from the thoughtless prattle of Annette, the most probable  means of decoying Emily, the Count sent back the Count servants to the castle, while  the Count awaited her arrival at the hamlet, with an intention of carrying her  immediately to Venice. How this, the Count second scheme, was frustrated, has already  appeared; but the violent, and various passions with which this Italian lover  was now agitated, on the Count return to Venice, can only be imagined. Annette having made this Italian lover   report to Montoni of Emily's health and of Emily request  to see the Count, the Count replied, that Emily might attend the Count in the cedar room, in about  an hour. It was on the subject, that pressed so heavily on Emily mind, that Emily  wished to speak to the Count, yet Emily   did not distinctly know what good purpose this  could answer, and sometimes Emily   even recoiled in horror from the expectation of  the Count presence. Emily   wished, also, to petition, though Emily   scarcely dared to  believe her request   would be granted, that the Count would permit Emily  , since Emily   aunt  was no more, to return to Emily   native country. As the moment of interview approached, Emily   agitation increased so much, that  Emily   almost resolved to excuse Emily   under what could scarcely be called a  pretence of illness; and, when Emily   considered what could be said, either  concerning Emily  , or the fate of her aunt  , Emily   was equally hopeless as to the  event of Emily   entreaty, and terrified as to her entreaty effect upon the vengeful spirit  of Montoni. Yet, to pretend ignorance of Emily   death, appeared, in some degree,  to be sharing some degree criminality, and, indeed, the  event of her entreaty was the only ground, on  which Emily could rest Emily petition for leaving Udolpho. While Emily thoughts thus wavered, a message was brought, importing, that Montoni  could not see Emily, till the next day; and Emily spirits were then relieved, for a  moment, from an almost intolerable weight of apprehension. Emily said, Emily  fancied the Chevaliers were going out to the wars again, for the court-yard was  filled with horses, and Emily heard, that the rest of the party, who went out  before, were expected at the castle. 'And I heard one of the soldiers, too,'  added Emily, 'say to his comrade, that his would warrant they'd bring home a rare  deal of booty.—So, thinks I, if the Signor can, with a safe conscience, send  the Signor people out a-robbing—why it is no business of mine. I only wish I was  once safe out of the castle; and, if the castle had not been for poor Ludovico's sake,  I would have let Count Morano's people run away with us both, for it would have  been serving you a good turn, ma'amselle, as well as myself.' Emily might have continued thus talking for hours for any interruption Emily  would have received from Emily, who was silent, inattentive, absorbed in  thought, and passed the whole of this day in a kind of solemn tranquillity,  such as is often the result of faculties overstrained by suffering. When night returned, Emily recollected the mysterious strains of music, that  Emily had lately heard, in which Emily still felt some degree of interest, and of  which Emily hoped to hear again the soothing sweetness. The influence of  superstition now gained on the weakness of Emily long-harassed mind; Emily looked,  with enthusiastic expectation, to the guardian spirit of Emily father, and,  having dismissed Emily for the night, determined to watch alone for their  return. It was not yet, however, near the time when Emily had heard the music on  a former night, and anxious to call off Emily thoughts from distressing subjects,  Emily sat down with one of the few books, that Emily had brought from France; but  Emily mind, refusing controul, became restless and agitated, and Emily went often  to the casement to listen for a sound. Once, Emily thought Emily heard a voice, but  then, every thing without the casement remaining still, Emily concluded, that Emily  fancy had deceived Emily. Thus passed the time, till twelve o'clock, soon after which the distant sounds,  that murmured through the castle, ceased, and sleep seemed to reign over all.  Emily then seated Emily at the casement, where Emily was soon recalled from the  reverie, into which Emily sunk, by very unusual sounds, not of music, but like  the low mourning of some person in distress. As Emily listened, Emily heart  faltered in terror, and Emily became convinced, that the former sound was more  than imaginary. Still, at intervals, Emily heard a kind of feeble lamentation,  and sought to discover whence a kind of feeble lamentation came. There were several rooms underneath,  adjoining the rampart, which had been long shut up, and, as the sound probably  rose from one of these, Emily leaned from the casement to observe, whether any  light was visible there. The chambers, as far as Emily could perceive, were quite  dark, but, at a little distance, on the rampart below, Emily thought Emily saw  something moving. The faint twilight, which the stars shed, did not enable Emily to distinguish  what it was; but Emily judged it to be a sentinel, on watch, and Emily removed Emily  light to a remote part of the chamber, that Emily might escape notice, during Emily  further observation. The same object still appeared. Presently, The same object advanced along the rampart,  towards Emily window, and Emily then distinguished something like a human form, but  the silence, with which The same object moved, convinced Emily The same object was no sentinel. As it drew  near, Emily hesitated whether to retire; a thrilling curiosity inclined Emily to  stay, but a dread of Emily scarcely knew what warned Emily to withdraw. While Emily paused, the figure came opposite to Emily casement, and was stationary.  Every thing remained quiet; Emily had not heard even a foot-fall; and the  solemnity of this silence, with the mysterious form Emily saw, subdued Emily  spirits, so that Emily was moving from her casement, when, on a sudden, Emily  observed the figure start away, and glide down the rampart, after which it was  soon lost in the obscurity of night. Emily continued to gaze, for some time, on  the way it had passed, and then retired within Emily chamber, musing on this  strange circumstance, and scarcely doubting, that Emily had witnessed a  supernatural appearance. When her spirits recovered composure, Emily looked round for some other  explanation. Remembering what Emily had heard of the daring enterprises of  Montoni of Emily's health, it occurred to Emily, that Emily had just seen some unhappy person, who,  having been plundered by his banditti, was brought hither a captive; and that  the music Emily had formerly heard, came from his. Yet, if they had plundered  his, it still appeared improbable, that they should have brought his to the  castle, and it was also more consistent with the manners of banditti to murder  those they rob, than to make those they rob prisoners. But what, more than any other  circumstance, contradicted the supposition, that it was a prisoner, was that it was a prisoner  wandered on the terrace, without a guard: a consideration, which made Emily  dismiss immediately Emily first surmise. Afterwards, Emily was inclined to believe, that Count Morano had obtained  admittance into the castle; but Emily soon recollected the difficulties and  dangers, that must have opposed such an enterprise, and that, if he had so far  succeeded, to come alone and in silence to Emily casement at midnight was not the  conduct he would have adopted, particularly since the private stair-case,  communicating with Emily apartment, was known to he; neither would he have  uttered the dismal sounds Emily had heard. Another suggestion represented, that this might be some person, who had designs  upon the castle; but the mournful sounds destroyed, also, that probability.  Thus, enquiry only perplexed Emily. Who, or what, it could be that haunted this  lonely hour, complaining in such doleful accents and in such sweet music (for  Emily was still inclined to believe, that the former strains and the late  appearance were connected,) Emily had no means of ascertaining; and imagination  again assumed Emily empire, and roused the mysteries of superstition. Emily determined, however, to watch on the following night, when Emily doubts  might, perhaps, be cleared up; and Emily almost resolved to address the figure,  if the figure should appear again.
