  He is a great observer, and he looks  Quite through the deeds of men:  he loves no plays,      he hears no music;  Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort,  As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his spirit  that could be mov'd to smile at any thing.  Such men as he be never at heart's ease,  While they behold a greater than themselves.      JULIUS CAESAR Montoni and his companion did not return home, till many hours after the dawn  had blushed upon the Adriatic. The airy groups, which had danced all night  along the colonnade of St. Mark, dispersed before the morning, like so many  spirits. Montoni had been otherwise engaged; his soul was little susceptible of  light pleasures. He delighted in the energies of the passions; the difficulties  and tempests of life, which wreck the happiness of others, roused and  strengthened all the powers of his mind, and afforded him the highest  enjoyments, of which his nature was capable. Without some object of strong  interest, life was to him little more than a sleep; and, when pursuits of real  interest failed, he substituted artificial ones, till habit changed their  nature, and they ceased to be unreal. Of this kind was the habit of gaming,  which he had adopted, first, for the purpose of relieving him from the languor  of inaction, but had since pursued with the ardour of passion. In this  occupation he had passed the night with Cavigni and a party of young men, who  had more money than rank, and more vice than either. Montoni despised the  greater part of these for the inferiority of their talents, rather than for  their vicious inclinations, and associated with them only to make them the  instruments of his purposes. Among these, however, were some of superior  abilities, and a few whom Montoni admitted to his intimacy, but even towards  these he still preserved a decisive and haughty air, which, while it imposed  submission on weak and timid minds, roused the fierce hatred of strong ones. He  had, of course, many and bitter enemies; but the rancour of their hatred proved  the degree of his power; and, as power was his chief aim, he gloried more in  such hatred, than it was possible he could in being esteemed. A feeling so  tempered as that of esteem, he despised, and would have despised himself also  had he thought himself capable of being flattered by it. Among the few whom he distinguished, were the Signors Bertolini, Orsino, and  Verezzi. The first was a man of gay temper, strong passions, dissipated, and of  unbounded extravagance, but generous, brave, and unsuspicious. Orsino was  reserved, and haughty; loving power more than ostentation; of a cruel and  suspicious temper; quick to feel an injury, and relentless in avenging it;  cunning and unsearchable in contrivance, patient and indefatigable in the  execution of his schemes. He had a perfect command of feature and of his  passions, of which he had scarcely any, but pride, revenge and avarice; and, in  the gratification of these, few considerations had power to restrain him, few  obstacles to withstand the depth of his stratagems. This man was the chief  favourite of Montoni. Verezzi was a man of some talent, of fiery imagination,  and the slave of alternate passions. He was gay, voluptuous, and daring; yet  had neither perseverance or true courage, and was meanly selfish in all his  aims. Quick to form schemes, and sanguine in his hope of success, he was the  first to undertake, and to abandon, not only his own plans, but those adopted  from other persons. Proud and impetuous, he revolted against all subordination;  yet those who were acquainted with his character, and watched the turn of his  passions, could lead him like a child. Such were the friends whom Montoni introduced to his family and his table, on  the day after his arrival at Venice. There were also of the party a Venetian  nobleman, Count Morano, and a Signora Livona, whom Montoni had introduced to  his wife, as a lady of distinguished merit, and who, having called in the  morning to welcome her to Venice, had been requested to be of the dinner party. Madame Montoni received with a very ill grace, the compliments of the Signors.  She disliked them, because they were the friends of her husband; hated them,  because she believed they had contributed to detain him abroad till so late an  hour of the preceding morning; and envied them, since, conscious of her own  want of influence, she was convinced, that he preferred their society to her  own. The rank of Count Morano procured him that distinction which she refused  to the rest of the company. The haughty sullenness of her countenance and  manner, and the ostentatious extravagance of her dress, for she had not yet  adopted the Venetian habit, were strikingly contrasted by the beauty, modesty,  sweetness and simplicity of Emily, who observed, with more attention than  pleasure, the party around her. The beauty and fascinating manners of Signora  Livona, however, won her involuntary regard; while the sweetness of her accents  and her air of gentle kindness awakened with Emily those pleasing affections,  which so long had slumbered. In the cool of the evening the party embarked in Montoni's gondola, and rowed  out upon the sea. The red glow of sun-set still touched the waves, and lingered  in the west, where the melancholy gleam seemed slowly expiring, while the dark  blue of the upper aether began to twinkle with stars. Emily sat, given up to  pensive and sweet emotions. The smoothness of the water, over which she glided,  its reflected images—a new heaven and trembling stars below the waves, with  shadowy outlines of towers and porticos, conspired with the stillness of the  hour, interrupted only by the passing wave, or the notes of distant music, to  raise those emotions to enthusiasm. As she listened to the measured sound of  the oars, and to the remote warblings that came in the breeze, her softened  mind returned to the memory of St. Aubert and to Valancourt, and tears stole to  her eyes. The rays of the moon, strengthening as the shadows deepened, soon  after threw a silvery gleam upon her countenance, which was partly shaded by a  thin black veil, and touched it with inimitable softness. Hers was the CONTOUR  of a Madona, with the sensibility of a Magdalen; and the pensive uplifted eye,  with the tear that glittered on her cheek, confirmed the expression of the  character. The last strain of distant music now died in air, for the gondola was far upon  the waves, and the party determined to have music of their own. The Count  Morano, who sat next to Emily, and who had been observing her for some time in  silence, snatched up a lute, and struck the chords with the finger of harmony  herself, while his voice, a fine tenor, accompanied them in a rondeau full of  tender sadness. To him, indeed, might have been applied that beautiful  exhortation of an English poet, had it then existed:      Strike up, my master,  But touch the strings with a religious softness!  Teach sounds to languish through the night's dull ear  Till Melancholy starts from off her couch,  And Carelessness grows concert to attention! With such powers of expression the Count sung the following      RONDEAU   Soft as yon silver ray, that sleeps  Upon the ocean's trembling tide;  Soft as the air, that lightly sweeps  Yon sad, that swells in stately pride:   Soft as the surge's stealing note,  That dies along the distant shores,  Or warbled strain, that sinks remote—  So soft the sigh my bosom pours!   True as the wave to Cynthia's ray,  True as the vessel to the breeze,  True as the soul to music's sway,  Or music to Venetian seas:   Soft as yon silver beams, that sleep  Upon the ocean's trembling breast;  So soft, so true, fond Love shall weep,  So soft, so true, with THEE shall rest. The cadence with which he returned from the last stanza to a repetition of the  first; the fine modulation in which his voice stole upon the first line, and  the pathetic energy with which it pronounced the last, were such as only  exquisite taste could give. When he had concluded, he gave the lute with a sigh  to Emily, who, to avoid any appearance of affectation, immediately began to  play. She sung a melancholy little air, one of the popular songs of her native  province, with a simplicity and pathos that made it enchanting. But its  well-known melody brought so forcibly to her fancy the scenes and the persons,  among which she had often heard it, that her spirits were overcome, her voice  trembled and ceased—and the strings of the lute were struck with a disordered  hand; till, ashamed of the emotion she had betrayed, she suddenly passed on to  a song so gay and airy, that the steps of the dance seemed almost to echo to  the notes. BRAVISSIMO! burst instantly from the lips of her delighted auditors,  and she was compelled to repeat the air. Among the compliments that followed,  those of the Count were not the least audible, and they had not concluded, when  Emily gave the instrument to Signora Livona, whose voice accompanied it with  true Italian taste. Afterwards, the Count, Emily, Cavigni, and the Signora, sung canzonettes,  accompanied by a couple of lutes and a few other instruments. Sometimes the  instruments suddenly ceased, and the voices dropped from the full swell of  harmony into a low chant; then, after a deep pause, they rose by degrees, the  instruments one by one striking up, till the loud and full chorus soared again  to heaven! Meanwhile, Montoni, who was weary of this harmony, was considering how he might  disengage himself from his party, or withdraw with such of it as would be  willing to play, to a Casino. In a pause of the music, he proposed returning to  shore, a proposal which Orsino eagerly seconded, but which the Count and the  other gentlemen as warmly opposed. Montoni still meditated how he might excuse himself from longer attendance upon  the Count, for to him only he thought excuse necessary, and how he might get to  land, till the gondolieri of an empty boat, returning to Venice, hailed his  people. Without troubling himself longer about an excuse, he seized this  opportunity of going thither, and, committing the ladies to the care of his  friends, departed with Orsino, while Emily, for the first time, saw him go with  regret; for she considered his presence a protection, though she knew not what  she should fear. He landed at St. Mark's, and, hurrying to a Casino, was soon  lost amidst a crowd of gamesters. Meanwhile, the Count having secretly dispatched a servant in Montoni's boat,  for his own gondola and musicians, Emily heard, without knowing his project,  the gay song of gondolieri approaching, as they sat on the stern of the boat,  and saw the tremulous gleam of the moon-light wave, which their oars disturbed.  Presently she heard the sound of instruments, and then a full symphony swelled  on the air, and, the boats meeting, the gondolieri hailed each other. The count  then explaining himself, the party removed into his gondola, which was  embellished with all that taste could bestow. While they partook of a collation of fruits and ice, the whole band, following  at a distance in the other boat, played the most sweet and enchanting strains,  and the Count, who had again seated himself by Emily, paid her unremitted  attention, and sometimes, in a low but impassioned voice, uttered compliments  which she could not misunderstand. To avoid them she conversed with Signora  Livona, and her manner to the Count assumed a mild reserve, which, though  dignified, was too gentle to repress his assiduities: he could see, hear, speak  to no person, but Emily while Cavigni observed him now and then, with a look of  displeasure, and Emily, with one of uneasiness. She now wished for nothing so  much as to return to Venice, but it was near mid-night before the gondolas  approached St. Mark's Place, where the voice of gaiety and song was loud. The  busy hum of mingling sounds was heard at a considerable distance on the water,  and, had not a bright moon-light discovered the city, with its terraces and  towers, a stranger would almost have credited the fabled wonders of Neptune's  court, and believed, that the tumult arose from beneath the waves. They landed at St. Mark's, where the gaiety of the colonnades and the beauty of  the night, made Madame Montoni willingly submit to the Count's solicitations to  join the promenade, and afterwards to take a supper with the rest of the party,  at his Casino. If any thing could have dissipated Emily's uneasiness, it would  have been the grandeur, gaiety, and novelty of the surrounding scene, adorned  with Palladio's palaces, and busy with parties of masqueraders. At length they withdrew to the Casino, which was fitted up with infinite taste,  and where a splendid banquet was prepared; but here Emily's reserve made the  Count perceive, that it was necessary for his interest to win the favour of  Madame Montoni, which, from the condescension she had already shewn to him,  appeared to be an achievement of no great difficulty. He transferred,  therefore, part of his attention from Emily to her aunt, who felt too much  flattered by the distinction even to disguise her emotion; and before the party  broke up, he had entirely engaged the esteem of Madame Montoni. Whenever he  addressed her, her ungracious countenance relaxed into smiles, and to whatever  he proposed she assented. He invited her, with the rest of the party, to take  coffee, in his box at the opera, on the following evening, and Emily heard the  invitation accepted, with strong anxiety, concerning the means of excusing  herself from attending Madame Montoni thither. It was very late before their gondola was ordered, and Emily's surprise was  extreme, when, on quitting the Casino, she beheld the broad sun rising out of  the Adriatic, while St. Mark's Place was yet crowded with company. Sleep had  long weighed heavily on her eyes, but now the fresh sea-breeze revived her, and  she would have quitted the scene with regret, had not the Count been present,  performing the duty, which he had imposed upon himself, of escorting them home.  There they heard that Montoni was not yet returned; and his wife, retiring in  displeasure to her apartment, at length released Emily from the fatigue of  further attendance. Montoni came home late in the morning, in a very ill humour, having lost  considerably at play, and, before he withdrew to rest, had a private conference  with Cavigni, whose manner, on the following day, seemed to tell, that the  subject of it had not been pleasing to him. In the evening, Madame Montoni, who, during the day, had observed a sullen  silence towards her husband, received visits from some Venetian ladies, with  whose sweet manners Emily was particularly charmed. They had an air of ease and  kindness towards the strangers, as if they had been their familiar friends for  years; and their conversation was by turns tender, sentimental and gay. Madame,  though she had no taste for such conversation, and whose coarseness and  selfishness sometimes exhibited a ludicrous contrast to their excessive  refinement, could not remain wholly insensible to the captivations of their  manner. In a pause of conversation, a lady who was called Signora Herminia took up a  lute, and began to play and sing, with as much easy gaiety, as if she had been  alone. Her voice was uncommonly rich in tone, and various in expression; yet  she appeared to be entirely unconscious of its powers, and meant nothing less  than to display them. She sung from the gaiety of her heart, as she sat with  her veil half thrown back, holding gracefully the lute, under the spreading  foliage and flowers of some plants, that rose from baskets, and interlaced one  of the lattices of the saloon. Emily, retiring a little from the company,  sketched her figure, with the miniature scenery around her, and drew a very  interesting picture, which, though it would not, perhaps, have borne criticism,  had spirit and taste enough to awaken both the fancy and the heart. When she  had finished it, she presented it to the beautiful original, who was delighted  with the offering, as well as the sentiment it conveyed, and assured Emily,  with a smile of captivating sweetness, that she should preserve it as a pledge  of her friendship. In the evening Cavigni joined the ladies, but Montoni had other engagements;  and they embarked in the gondola for St. Mark's, where the same gay company  seemed to flutter as on the preceding night. The cool breeze, the glassy sea,  the gentle sound of its waves, and the sweeter murmur of distant music; the  lofty porticos and arcades, and the happy groups that sauntered beneath them;  these, with every feature and circumstance of the scene, united to charm Emily,  no longer teased by the officious attentions of Count Morano. But, as she  looked upon the moon-light sea, undulating along the walls of St. Mark, and,  lingering for a moment over those walls, caught the sweet and melancholy song  of some gondolier as he sat in his boat below, waiting for his master, her  softened mind returned to the memory of her home, of her friends, and of all  that was dear in her native country. After walking some time, they sat down at the door of a Casino, and, while  Cavigni was accommodating them with coffee and ice, were joined by Count  Morano. He sought Emily with a look of impatient delight, who, remembering all  the attention he had shewn her on the preceding evening, was compelled, as  before, to shrink from his assiduities into a timid reserve, except when she  conversed with Signora Herminia and the other ladies of her party. It was near midnight before they withdrew to the opera, where Emily was not so  charmed but that, when she remembered the scene she had just quitted, she felt  how infinitely inferior all the splendour of art is to the sublimity of nature.  Her heart was not now affected, tears of admiration did not start to her eyes,  as when she viewed the vast expanse of ocean, the grandeur of the heavens, and  listened to the rolling waters, and to the faint music that, at intervals,  mingled with their roar. Remembering these, the scene before her faded into  insignificance. Of the evening, which passed on without any particular incident, she wished the  conclusion, that she might escape from the attentions of the Count; and, as  opposite qualities frequently attract each other in our thoughts, thus Emily,  when she looked on Count Morano, remembered Valancourt, and a sigh sometimes  followed the recollection. Several weeks passed in the course of customary visits, during which nothing  remarkable occurred. Emily was amused by the manners and scenes that surrounded  her, so different from those of France, but where Count Morano, too frequently  for her comfort, contrived to introduce himself. His manner, figure and  accomplishments, which were generally admired, Emily would, perhaps, have  admired also, had her heart been disengaged from Valancourt, and had the Count  forborne to persecute her with officious attentions, during which she observed  some traits in his character, that prejudiced her against whatever might  otherwise be good in it. Soon after his arrival at Venice, Montoni received a packet from M. Quesnel, in  which the latter mentioned the death of his wife's uncle, at his villa on the  Brenta; and that, in consequence of this event, he should hasten to take  possession of that estate and of other effects bequeathed to him. This uncle  was the brother of Madame Quesnel's late mother; Montoni was related to her by  the father's side, and though he could have had neither claim nor expectation  concerning these possessions, he could scarcely conceal the envy which M.  Quesnel's letter excited. Emily had observed with concern, that, since they left France, Montoni had not  even affected kindness towards her aunt, and that, after treating her, at  first, with neglect, he now met her with uniform ill-humour and reserve. She  had never supposed, that her aunt's foibles could have escaped the discernment  of Montoni, or that her mind or figure were of a kind to deserve his attention.  Her surprise, therefore, at this match, had been extreme; but since he had made  the choice, she did not suspect that he would so openly have discovered his  contempt of it. But Montoni, who had been allured by the seeming wealth of  Madame Cheron, was now severely disappointed by her comparative poverty, and  highly exasperated by the deceit she had employed to conceal it, till  concealment was no longer necessary. He had been deceived in an affair, wherein  he meant to be the deceiver; out-witted by the superior cunning of a woman,  whose understanding he despised, and to whom he had sacrificed his pride and  his liberty, without saving himself from the ruin, which had impended over his  head. Madame Montoni had contrived to have the greatest part of what she really  did possess, settled upon herself: what remained, though it was totally  inadequate both to her husband's expectations, and to his necessities, he had  converted into money, and brought with him to Venice, that he might a little  longer delude society, and make a last effort to regain the fortunes he had  lost. The hints which had been thrown out to Valancourt, concerning Montoni's  character and condition, were too true; but it was now left to time and  occasion, to unfold the circumstances, both of what had, and of what had not  been hinted, and to time and occasion we commit them. Madame Montoni was not of a nature to bear injuries with meekness, or to resent  them with dignity: her exasperated pride displayed itself in all the violence  and acrimony of a little, or at least of an ill-regulated mind. She would not  acknowledge, even to herself, that she had in any degree provoked contempt by  her duplicity, but weakly persisted in believing, that she alone was to be  pitied, and Montoni alone to be censured; for, as her mind had naturally little  perception of moral obligation, she seldom understood its force but when it  happened to be violated towards herself: her vanity had already been severely  shocked by a discovery of Montoni's contempt; it remained to be farther  reproved by a discovery of his circumstances. His mansion at Venice, though its  furniture discovered a part of the truth to unprejudiced persons, told nothing  to those who were blinded by a resolution to believe whatever they wished.  Madame Montoni still thought herself little less than a princess, possessing a  palace at Venice, and a castle among the Apennines. To the castle di Udolpho,  indeed, Montoni sometimes talked of going for a few weeks to examine into its  condition, and to receive some rents; for it appeared that he had not been  there for two years, and that, during this period, it had been inhabited only  by an old servant, whom he called his steward. Emily listened to the mention of this journey with pleasure, for she not only  expected from it new ideas, but a release from the persevering assiduities of  Count Morano. In the country, too, she would have leisure to think of  Valancourt, and to indulge the melancholy, which his image, and a recollection  of the scenes of La Vallee, always blessed with the memory of her parents,  awakened. The ideal scenes were dearer, and more soothing to her heart, than  all the splendour of gay assemblies; they were a kind of talisman that expelled  the poison of temporary evils, and supported her hopes of happy days: they  appeared like a beautiful landscape, lighted up by a gleam of sun-shine, and  seen through a perspective of dark and rugged rocks. But Count Morano did not long confine himself to silent assiduities; he  declared his passion to Emily, and made proposals to Montoni, who encouraged,  though Emily rejected, him: with Montoni for his friend, and an abundance of  vanity to delude him, he did not despair of success. Emily was astonished and  highly disgusted at his perseverance, after she had explained her sentiments  with a frankness that would not allow him to misunderstand them. He now passed the greater part of his time at Montoni's, dining there almost  daily, and attending Madame and Emily wherever they went; and all this,  notwithstanding the uniform reserve of Emily, whose aunt seemed as anxious as  Montoni to promote this marriage; and would never dispense with her attendance  at any assembly where the Count proposed to be present. Montoni now said nothing of his intended journey, of which Emily waited  impatiently to hear; and he was seldom at home but when the Count, or Signor  Orsino, was there, for between himself and Cavigni a coolness seemed to  subsist, though the latter remained in his house. With Orsino, Montoni was  frequently closeted for hours together, and, whatever might be the business,  upon which they consulted, it appeared to be of consequence, since Montoni  often sacrificed to it his favourite passion for play, and remained at home the  whole night. There was somewhat of privacy, too, in the manner of Orsino's  visits, which had never before occurred, and which excited not only surprise,  but some degree of alarm in Emily's mind, who had unwillingly discovered much  of his character when he had most endeavoured to disguise it. After these  visits, Montoni was often more thoughtful than usual; sometimes the deep  workings of his mind entirely abstracted him from surrounding objects, and  threw a gloom over his visage that rendered it terrible; at others, his eyes  seemed almost to flash fire, and all the energies of his soul appeared to be  roused for some great enterprise. Emily observed these written characters of  his thoughts with deep interest, and not without some degree of awe, when she  considered that she was entirely in his power; but forbore even to hint her  fears, or her observations, to Madame Montoni, who discerned nothing in her  husband, at these times, but his usual sternness. A second letter from M. Quesnel announced the arrival of himself and his lady  at the Villa Miarenti; stated several circumstances of his good fortune,  respecting the affair that had brought him into Italy; and concluded with an  earnest request to see Montoni, his wife and niece, at his new estate. Emily received, about the same period, a much more interesting letter, and  which soothed for a while every anxiety of her heart. Valancourt, hoping she  might be still at Venice, had trusted a letter to the ordinary post, that told  her of his health, and of his unceasing and anxious affection. He had lingered  at Tholouse for some time after her departure, that he might indulge the  melancholy pleasure of wandering through the scenes where he had been  accustomed to behold her, and had thence gone to his brother's chateau, which  was in the neighbourhood of La Vallee. Having mentioned this, he added, 'If the  duty of attending my regiment did not require my departure, I know not when I  should have resolution enough to quit the neighbourhood of a place which is  endeared by the remembrance of you. The vicinity to La Vallee has alone  detained me thus long at Estuviere: I frequently ride thither early in the  morning, that I may wander, at leisure, through the day, among scenes, which  were once your home, where I have been accustomed to see you, and to hear you  converse. I have renewed my acquaintance with the good old Theresa, who  rejoiced to see me, that she might talk of you: I need not say how much this  circumstance attached me to her, or how eagerly I listened to her upon her  favourite subject. You will guess the motive that first induced me to make  myself known to Theresa: it was, indeed, no other than that of gaining  admittance into the chateau and gardens, which my Emily had so lately  inhabited: here, then, I wander, and meet your image under every shade: but  chiefly I love to sit beneath the spreading branches of your favourite plane,  where once, Emily, we sat together; where I first ventured to tell you, that I  loved. O Emily! the remembrance of those moments overcomes me—I sit lost in  reverie—I endeavour to see you dimly through my tears, in all the heaven of  peace and innocence, such as you then appeared to me; to hear again the accents  of that voice, which then thrilled my heart with tenderness and hope. I lean on  the wall of the terrace, where we together watched the rapid current of the  Garonne below, while I described the wild scenery about its source, but thought  only of you. O Emily! are these moments passed for ever—will they never more  return?' In another part of his letter he wrote thus. 'You see my letter is dated on  many different days, and, if you look back to the first, you will perceive,  that I began to write soon after your departure from France. To write was,  indeed, the only employment that withdrew me from my own melancholy, and  rendered your absence supportable, or rather, it seemed to destroy absence;  for, when I was conversing with you on paper, and telling you every sentiment  and affection of my heart, you almost appeared to be present. This employment  has been from time to time my chief consolation, and I have deferred sending  off my packet, merely for the comfort of prolonging it, though it was certain,  that what I had written, was written to no purpose till you received it.  Whenever my mind has been more than usually depressed I have come to pour forth  its sorrows to you, and have always found consolation; and, when any little  occurrence has interested my heart, and given a gleam of joy to my spirits, I  have hastened to communicate it to you, and have received reflected  satisfaction. Thus, my letter is a kind of picture of my life and of my  thoughts for the last month, and thus, though it has been deeply interesting to  me, while I wrote it, and I dare hope will, for the same reason, be not  indifferent to you, yet to other readers it would seem to abound only in  frivolities. Thus it is always, when we attempt to describe the finer movements  of the heart, for they are too fine to be discerned, they can only be  experienced, and are therefore passed over by the indifferent observer, while  the interested one feels, that all description is imperfect and unnecessary,  except as it may prove the sincerity of the writer, and sooth his own  sufferings. You will pardon all this egotism—for I am a lover.' 'I have just heard of a circumstance, which entirely destroys all my fairy  paradise of ideal delight, and which will reconcile me to the necessity of  returning to my regiment, for I must no longer wander beneath the beloved  shades, where I have been accustomed to meet you in thought.—La Vallee is  let! I have reason to believe this is without your knowledge, from what Theresa  told me this morning, and, therefore, I mention the circumstance. She shed  tears, while she related, that she was going to leave the service of her dear  mistress, and the chateau where she had lived so many happy years; and all  this, added she, without even a letter from Mademoiselle to soften the news;  but it is all Mons. Quesnel's doings, and I dare say she does not even know  what is going forward.' 'Theresa added, That she had received a letter from him, informing her the  chateau was let, and that, as her services would no longer be required, she  must quit the place, on that day week, when the new tenant would arrive.' 'Theresa had been surprised by a visit from M. Quesnel, some time before the  receipt of this letter, who was accompanied by a stranger that viewed the  premises with much curiosity.' Towards the conclusion of his letter, which is dated a week after this  sentence, Valancourt adds, 'I have received a summons from my regiment, and I  join it without regret, since I am shut out from the scenes that are so  interesting to my heart. I rode to La Vallee this morning, and heard that the  new tenant was arrived, and that Theresa was gone. I should not treat the  subject thus familiarly if I did not believe you to be uninformed of this  disposal of your house; for your satisfaction I have endeavoured to learn  something of the character and fortune of your tenant, but without success. He  is a gentleman, they say, and this is all I can hear. The place, as I wandered  round the boundaries, appeared more melancholy to my imagination, than I had  ever seen it. I wished earnestly to have got admittance, that I might have  taken another leave of your favourite plane-tree, and thought of you once more  beneath its shade: but I forbore to tempt the curiosity of strangers: the  fishing-house in the woods, however, was still open to me; thither I went, and  passed an hour, which I cannot even look back upon without emotion. O Emily!  surely we are not separated for ever—surely we shall live for each other!' This letter brought many tears to Emily's eyes; tears of tenderness and  satisfaction on learning that Valancourt was well, and that time and absence  had in no degree effaced her image from his heart. There were passages in this  letter which particularly affected her, such as those describing his visits to  La Vallee, and the sentiments of delicate affection that its scenes had  awakened. It was a considerable time before her mind was sufficiently  abstracted from Valancourt to feel the force of his intelligence concerning La  Vallee. That Mons. Quesnel should let it, without even consulting her on the  measure, both surprised and shocked her, particularly as it proved the absolute  authority he thought himself entitled to exercise in her affairs. It is true,  he had proposed, before she left France, that the chateau should be let, during  her absence, and to the oeconomical prudence of this she had nothing to object;  but the committing what had been her father's villa to the power and caprice of  strangers, and the depriving herself of a sure home, should any unhappy  circumstances make her look back to her home as an asylum, were considerations  that made her, even then, strongly oppose the measure. Her father, too, in his  last hour, had received from her a solemn promise never to dispose of La  Vallee; and this she considered as in some degree violated if she suffered the  place to be let. But it was now evident with how little respect M. Quesnel had  regarded these objections, and how insignificant he considered every obstacle  to pecuniary advantage. It appeared, also, that he had not even condescended to  inform Montoni of the step he had taken, since no motive was evident for  Montoni's concealing the circumstance from her, if it had been made known to  him: this both displeased and surprised her; but the chief subjects of her  uneasiness were—the temporary disposal of La Vallee, and the dismission of  her father's old and faithful servant.—'Poor Theresa,' said Emily, 'thou  hadst not saved much in thy servitude, for thou wast always tender towards the  poor, and believd'st thou shouldst die in the family, where thy best years had  been spent. Poor Theresa!—now thou art turned out in thy old age to seek thy  bread!' Emily wept bitterly as these thoughts passed over her mind, and she determined  to consider what could be done for Theresa, and to talk very explicitly to M.  Quesnel on the subject; but she much feared that his cold heart could feel only  for itself. She determined also to enquire whether he had made any mention of  her affairs, in his letter to Montoni, who soon gave her the opportunity she  sought, by desiring that she would attend him in his study. She had little  doubt, that the interview was intended for the purpose of communicating to her  a part of M. Quesnel's letter concerning the transactions at La Vallee, and she  obeyed him immediately. Montoni was alone. 'I have just been writing to Mons. Quesnel,' said he when Emily appeared, 'in  reply to the letter I received from him a few days ago, and I wished to talk to  you upon a subject that occupied part of it.' 'I also wished to speak with you on this topic, sir,' said Emily. 'It is a subject of some interest to you, undoubtedly,' rejoined Montoni, 'and  I think you must see it in the light that I do; indeed it will not bear any  other. I trust you will agree with me, that any objection founded on sentiment,  as they call it, ought to yield to circumstances of solid advantage.' 'Granting this, sir,' replied Emily, modestly, 'those of humanity ought surely  to be attended to. But I fear it is now too late to deliberate upon this plan,  and I must regret, that it is no longer in my power to reject it.' 'It is too late,' said Montoni; 'but since it is so, I am pleased to observe,  that you submit to reason and necessity without indulging useless complaint. I  applaud this conduct exceedingly, the more, perhaps, since it discovers a  strength of mind seldom observable in your sex. When you are older you will  look back with gratitude to the friends who assisted in rescuing you from the  romantic illusions of sentiment, and will perceive, that they are only the  snares of childhood, and should be vanquished the moment you escape from the  nursery. I have not closed my letter, and you may add a few lines to inform  your uncle of your acquiescence. You will soon see him, for it is my intention  to take you, with Madame Montoni, in a few days to Miarenti, and you can then  talk over the affair.' Emily wrote on the opposite page of the paper as follows: 'It is now useless, sir, for me to remonstrate upon the circumstances of which Signor Montoni informs me that he has written. I could have wished, at least, that the affair had been concluded with less precipitation, that I might have taught myself to subdue some prejudices, as the Signor calls them, which still linger in my heart. As it is, I submit. In point of prudence nothing certainly can be objected; but, though I submit, I have yet much to say on some other points of the subject, when I shall have the honour of seeing you. In the meantime I entreat you will take care of Theresa, for the sake of,     Sir,      Your affectionate niece,      EMILY ST. AUBERT.' Montoni smiled satirically at what Emily had written, but did not object to it,  and she withdrew to her own apartment, where she sat down to begin a letter to  Valancourt, in which she related the particulars of her journey, and her  arrival at Venice, described some of the most striking scenes in the passage  over the Alps; her emotions on her first view of Italy; the manners and  characters of the people around her, and some few circumstances of Montoni's  conduct. But she avoided even naming Count Morano, much more the declaration he  had made, since she well knew how tremblingly alive to fear is real love, how  jealously watchful of every circumstance that may affect its interest; and she  scrupulously avoided to give Valancourt even the slightest reason for believing  he had a rival. On the following day Count Morano dined again at Montoni's. He was in an  uncommon flow of spirits, and Emily thought there was somewhat of exultation in  his manner of addressing her, which she had never observed before. She  endeavoured to repress this by more than her usual reserve, but the cold  civility of her air now seemed rather to encourage than to depress him. He  appeared watchful of an opportunity of speaking with her alone, and more than  once solicited this; but Emily always replied, that she could hear nothing from  him which he would be unwilling to repeat before the whole company. In the evening, Madame Montoni and her party went out upon the sea, and as the  Count led Emily to his zendaletto, he carried her hand to his lips, and thanked  her for the condescension she had shown him. Emily, in extreme surprise and  displeasure, hastily withdrew her hand, and concluded that he had spoken  ironically; but, on reaching the steps of the terrace, and observing by the  livery, that it was the Count's zendaletto which waited below, while the rest  of the party, having arranged themselves in the gondolas, were moving on, she  determined not to permit a separate conversation, and, wishing him a good  evening, returned to the portico. The Count followed to expostulate and  entreat, and Montoni, who then came out, rendered solicitation unnecessary,  for, without condescending to speak, he took her hand, and led her to the  zendaletto. Emily was not silent; she entreated Montoni, in a low voice, to  consider the impropriety of these circumstances, and that he would spare her  the mortification of submitting to them; he, however, was inflexible. 'This caprice is intolerable,' said he, 'and shall not be indulged: there is no  impropriety in the case.' At this moment, Emily's dislike of Count Morano rose to abhorrence. That he  should, with undaunted assurance, thus pursue her, notwithstanding all she had  expressed on the subject of his addresses, and think, as it was evident he did,  that her opinion of him was of no consequence, so long as his pretensions were  sanctioned by Montoni, added indignation to the disgust which she had felt  towards him. She was somewhat relieved by observing that Montoni was to be of  the party, who seated himself on one side of her, while Morano placed himself  on the other. There was a pause for some moments as the gondolieri prepared  their oars, and Emily trembled from apprehension of the discourse that might  follow this silence. At length she collected courage to break it herself, in  the hope of preventing fine speeches from Morano, and reproof from Montoni. To  some trivial remark which she made, the latter returned a short and disobliging  reply; but Morano immediately followed with a general observation, which he  contrived to end with a particular compliment, and, though Emily passed it  without even the notice of a smile, he was not discouraged. 'I have been impatient,' said he, addressing Emily, 'to express my gratitude;  to thank you for your goodness; but I must also thank Signor Montoni, who has  allowed me this opportunity of doing so.' Emily regarded the Count with a look of mingled astonishment and displeasure. 'Why,' continued he, 'should you wish to diminish the delight of this moment by  that air of cruel reserve?—Why seek to throw me again into the perplexities  of doubt, by teaching your eyes to contradict the kindness of your late  declaration? You cannot doubt the sincerity, the ardour of my passion; it is  therefore unnecessary, charming Emily! surely unnecessary, any longer to  attempt a disguise of your sentiments.' 'If I ever had disguised them, sir,' said Emily, with recollected spirit, 'it  would certainly be unnecessary any longer to do so. I had hoped, sir, that you  would have spared me any farther necessity of alluding to them; but, since you  do not grant this, hear me declare, and for the last time, that your  perseverance has deprived you even of the esteem, which I was inclined to  believe you merited.' 'Astonishing!' exclaimed Montoni: 'this is beyond even my expectation, though I  have hitherto done justice to the caprice of the sex! But you will observe,  Mademoiselle Emily, that I am no lover, though Count Morano is, and that I will  not be made the amusement of your capricious moments. Here is the offer of an  alliance, which would do honour to any family; yours, you will recollect, is  not noble; you long resisted my remonstrances, but my honour is now engaged,  and it shall not be trifled with.—You shall adhere to the declaration, which  you have made me an agent to convey to the Count.' 'I must certainly mistake you, sir,' said Emily; 'my answers on the subject  have been uniform; it is unworthy of you to accuse me of caprice. If you have  condescended to be my agent, it is an honour I did not solicit. I myself have  constantly assured Count Morano, and you also, sir, that I never can accept the  honour he offers me, and I now repeat the declaration.' The Count looked with an air of surprise and enquiry at Montoni, whose  countenance also was marked with surprise, but it was surprise mingled with  indignation. 'Here is confidence, as well as caprice!' said the latter. 'Will you deny your  own words, Madam?' 'Such a question is unworthy of an answer, sir;' said Emily blushing; 'you will  recollect yourself, and be sorry that you have asked it.' 'Speak to the point,' rejoined Montoni, in a voice of increasing vehemence.  'Will you deny your own words; will you deny, that you acknowledged, only a few  hours ago, that it was too late to recede from your engagements, and that you  accepted the Count's hand?' 'I will deny all this, for no words of mine ever imported it.' 'Astonishing! Will you deny what you wrote to Mons. Quesnel, your uncle? if you  do, your own hand will bear testimony against you. What have you now to say?'  continued Montoni, observing the silence and confusion of Emily. 'I now perceive, sir, that you are under a very great error, and that I have  been equally mistaken.' 'No more duplicity, I entreat; be open and candid, if it be possible.' 'I have always been so, sir; and can claim no merit in such conduct, for I have  had nothing to conceal.' 'How is this, Signor?' cried Morano, with trembling emotion. 'Suspend your judgment, Count,' replied Montoni, 'the wiles of a female heart  are unsearchable. Now, Madame, your EXPLANATION.' 'Excuse me, sir, if I withhold my explanation till you appear willing to give  me your confidence; assertion as present can only subject me to insult.' 'Your explanation, I entreat you!' said Morano. 'Well, well,' rejoined Montoni, 'I give you my confidence; let us hear this  explanation.' 'Let me lead to it then, by asking a question.' 'As many as you please,' said Montoni, contemptuously. 'What, then, was the subject of your letter to Mons. Quesnel?' 'The same that was the subject of your note to him, certainly. You did well to  stipulate for my confidence before you demanded that question.' 'I must beg you will be more explicit, sir; what was that subject?' 'What could it be, but the noble offer of Count Morano,' said Montoni. 'Then, sir, we entirely misunderstood each other,' replied Emily. 'We entirely misunderstood each other too, I suppose,' rejoined Montoni, 'in  the conversation which preceded the writing of that note? I must do you the  justice to own, that you are very ingenious at this same art of  misunderstanding.' Emily tried to restrain the tears that came to her eyes, and to answer with  becoming firmness. 'Allow me, sir, to explain myself fully, or to be wholly  silent.' 'The explanation may now be dispensed with; it is anticipated. If Count Morano  still thinks one necessary, I will give him an honest one—You have changed  your intention since our last conversation; and, if he can have patience and  humility enough to wait till to-morrow, he will probably find it changed again:  but as I have neither the patience or the humility, which you expect from a  lover, I warn you of the effect of my displeasure!' 'Montoni, you are too precipitate,' said the Count, who had listened to this  conversation in extreme agitation and impatience;—'Signora, I entreat your  own explanation of this affair!' 'Signor Montoni has said justly,' replied Emily, 'that all explanation may now  be dispensed with; after what has passed I cannot suffer myself to give one. It  is sufficient for me, and for you, sir, that I repeat my late declaration; let  me hope this is the last time it will be necessary for me to repeat it—I  never can accept the honour of your alliance.' 'Charming Emily!' exclaimed the Count in an impassioned tone, 'let not  resentment make you unjust; let me not suffer for the offence of  Montoni!—Revoke—' 'Offence!' interrupted Montoni—'Count, this language is ridiculous, this  submission is childish!—speak as becomes a man, not as the slave of a pretty  tyrant.' 'You distract me, Signor; suffer me to plead my own cause; you have already  proved insufficient to it.' 'All conversation on this subject, sir,' said Emily, 'is worse than useless,  since it can bring only pain to each of us: if you would oblige me, pursue it  no farther.' 'It is impossible, Madam, that I can thus easily resign the object of a  passion, which is the delight and torment of my life.—I must still  love—still pursue you with unremitting ardour;—when you shall be convinced  of the strength and constancy of my passion, your heart must soften into pity  and repentance.' 'Is this generous, sir? is this manly? can it either deserve or obtain the  esteem you solicit, thus to continue a persecution from which I have no present  means of escaping?' A gleam of moonlight that fell upon Morano's countenance, revealed the strong  emotions of his soul; and, glancing on Montoni discovered the dark resentment,  which contrasted his features. 'By heaven this is too much!' suddenly exclaimed the Count; 'Signor Montoni,  you treat me ill; it is from you that I shall look for explanation.' 'From me, sir! you shall have it;' muttered Montoni, 'if your discernment is  indeed so far obscured by passion, as to make explanation necessary. And for  you, Madam, you should learn, that a man of honour is not to be trifled with,  though you may, perhaps, with impunity, treat a BOY like a puppet.' This sarcasm roused the pride of Morano, and the resentment which he had felt  at the indifference of Emily, being lost in indignation of the insolence of  Montoni, he determined to mortify him, by defending her. 'This also,' said he, replying to Montoni's last words, 'this also, shall not  pass unnoticed. I bid you learn, sir, that you have a stronger enemy than a  woman to contend with: I will protect Signora St. Aubert from your threatened  resentment. You have misled me, and would revenge your disappointed views upon  the innocent.' 'Misled you!' retorted Montoni with quickness, 'is my conduct—my word'—then  pausing, while he seemed endeavouring to restrain the resentment, that flashed  in his eyes, in the next moment he added, in a subdued voice, 'Count Morano,  this is a language, a sort of conduct to which I am not accustomed: it is the  conduct of a passionate boy—as such, I pass it over in contempt.' 'In contempt, Signor?' 'The respect I owe myself,' rejoined Montoni, 'requires, that I should converse  more largely with you upon some points of the subject in dispute. Return with  me to Venice, and I will condescend to convince you of your error.' 'Condescend, sir! but I will not condescend to be so conversed with.' Montoni smiled contemptuously; and Emily, now terrified for the consequences of  what she saw and heard, could no longer be silent. She explained the whole  subject upon which she had mistaken Montoni in the morning, declaring, that she  understood him to have consulted her solely concerning the disposal of La  Vallee, and concluding with entreating, that he would write immediately to M.  Quesnel, and rectify the mistake. But Montoni either was, or affected to be, still incredulous; and Count Morano  was still entangled in perplexity. While she was speaking, however, the  attention of her auditors had been diverted from the immediate occasion of  their resentment, and their passion consequently became less. Montoni desired  the Count would order his servants to row back to Venice, that he might have  some private conversation with him; and Morano, somewhat soothed by his  softened voice and manner, and eager to examine into the full extent of his  difficulties, complied. Emily, comforted by this prospect of release, employed the present moments in  endeavouring, with conciliating care, to prevent any fatal mischief between the  persons who so lately had persecuted and insulted her. Her spirits revived, when she heard once more the voice of song and laughter,  resounding from the grand canal, and at length entered again between its  stately piazzas. The zendaletto stopped at Montoni's mansion, and the Count  hastily led her into the hall, where Montoni took his arm, and said something  in a low voice, on which Morano kissed the hand he held, notwithstanding  Emily's effort to disengage it, and, wishing her a good evening, with an accent  and look she could not misunderstand, returned to his zendaletto with Montoni. Emily, in her own apartment, considered with intense anxiety all the unjust and  tyrannical conduct of Montoni, the dauntless perseverance of Morano, and her  own desolate situation, removed from her friends and country. She looked in  vain to Valancourt, confined by his profession to a distant kingdom, as her  protector; but it gave her comfort to know, that there was, at least, one  person in the world, who would sympathize in her afflictions, and whose wishes  would fly eagerly to release her. Yet she determined not to give him unavailing  pain by relating the reasons she had to regret the having rejected his better  judgment concerning Montoni; reasons, however, which could not induce her to  lament the delicacy and disinterested affection that had made her reject his  proposal for a clandestine marriage. The approaching interview with her uncle  she regarded with some degree of hope, for she determined to represent to him  the distresses of her situation, and to entreat that he would allow her to  return to France with him and Madame Quesnel. Then, suddenly remembering that  her beloved La Vallee, her only home, was no longer at her command, her tears  flowed anew, and she feared that she had little pity to expect from a man who,  like M. Quesnel, could dispose of it without deigning to consult with her, and  could dismiss an aged and faithful servant, destitute of either support or  asylum. But, though it was certain, that she had herself no longer a home in  France, and few, very few friends there, she determined to return, if possible,  that she might be released from the power of Montoni, whose particularly  oppressive conduct towards herself, and general character as to others, were  justly terrible to her imagination. She had no wish to reside with her uncle,
