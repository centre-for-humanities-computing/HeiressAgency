uniformly such as to convince her, that in flying to him she could only obtain  an exchange of oppressors; neither had she the slightest intention of  consenting to the proposal of Valancourt for an immediate marriage, though this  would give her a lawful and a generous protector, for the chief reasons, which  had formerly influenced her conduct, still existed against it, while others,  which seemed to justify the step, would not be done away; and his interest, his  fame were at all times too dear to her, to suffer her to consent to a union,  which, at this early period of their lives, would probably defeat both. One  sure, and proper asylum, however, would still be open to her in France. She  knew that she could board in the convent, where she had formerly experienced so  much kindness, and which had an affecting and solemn claim upon her heart,  since it contained the remains of her late father. Here she could remain in  safety and tranquillity, till the term, for which La Vallee might be let,  should expire; or, till the arrangement of M. Motteville's affairs enabled her  so far to estimate the remains of her fortune, as to judge whether it would be  prudent for her to reside there. Concerning Montoni's conduct with respect to his letters to M. Quesnel, she had  many doubts; however he might be at first mistaken on the subject, she much  suspected that he wilfully persevered in his error, as a means of intimidating  her into a compliance with his wishes of uniting her to Count Morano. Whether  this was or was not the fact, she was extremely anxious to explain the affair  to M. Quesnel, and looked forward with a mixture of impatience, hope and fear,  to her approaching visit. On the following day, Madame Montoni, being alone with Emily, introduced the  mention of Count Morano, by expressing her surprise, that she had not joined  the party on the water the preceding evening, and at her abrupt departure to  Venice. Emily then related what had passed, expressed her concern for the  mutual mistake that had occurred between Montoni and herself, and solicited her  aunt's kind offices in urging him to give a decisive denial to the count's  further addresses; but she soon perceived, that Madame Montoni had not been  ignorant of the late conversation, when she introduced the present. 'You have no encouragement to expect from me,' said her aunt, 'in these  notions. I have already given my opinion on the subject, and think Signor  Montoni right in enforcing, by any means, your consent. If young persons will  be blind to their interest, and obstinately oppose it, why, the greatest  blessings they can have are friends, who will oppose their folly. Pray what  pretensions of any kind do you think you have to such a match as is now offered  you?' 'Not any whatever, Madam,' replied Emily, 'and, therefore, at least, suffer me  to be happy in my humility.' 'Nay, niece, it cannot be denied, that you have pride enough; my poor brother,  your father, had his share of pride too; though, let me add, his fortune did  not justify it.' Emily, somewhat embarrassed by the indignation, which this malevolent allusion  to her father excited, and by the difficulty of rendering her answer as  temperate as it should be reprehensive, hesitated for some moments, in a  confusion, which highly gratified her aunt. At length she said, 'My father's  pride, Madam, had a noble object—the happiness which he knew could be derived  only from goodness, knowledge and charity. As it never consisted in his  superiority, in point of fortune, to some persons, it was not humbled by his  inferiority, in that respect, to others. He never disdained those, who were  wretched by poverty and misfortune; he did sometimes despise persons, who, with  many opportunities of happiness, rendered themselves miserable by vanity,  ignorance and cruelty. I shall think it my highest glory to emulate such pride.' 'I do not pretend to understand any thing of these high-flown sentiments,  niece; you have all that glory to yourself: I would teach you a little plain  sense, and not have you so wise as to despise happiness.' 'That would indeed not be wisdom, but folly,' said Emily, 'for wisdom can boast  no higher attainment than happiness; but you will allow, Madam, that our ideas  of happiness may differ. I cannot doubt, that you wish me to be happy, but I  must fear you are mistaken in the means of making me so.' 'I cannot boast of a learned education, niece, such as your father thought  proper to give you, and, therefore, do not pretend to understand all these fine  speeches about happiness. I must be contented to understand only common sense,  and happy would it have been for you and your father, if that had been included  in his education.' Emily was too much shocked by these reflections on her father's memory, to  despise this speech as it deserved. Madame Montoni was about to speak, but Emily quitted the room, and retired to  her own, where the little spirit she had lately exerted yielded to grief and  vexation, and left her only to her tears. From every review of her situation  she could derive, indeed, only new sorrow. To the discovery, which had just  been forced upon her, of Montoni's unworthiness, she had now to add, that of  the cruel vanity, for the gratification of which her aunt was about to  sacrifice her; of the effrontery and cunning, with which, at the time that she  meditated the sacrifice, she boasted of her tenderness, or insulted her victim;  and of the venomous envy, which, as it did not scruple to attack her father's  character, could scarcely be expected to withhold from her own. During the few days that intervened between this conversation and the departure  for Miarenti, Montoni did not once address himself to Emily. His looks  sufficiently declared his resentment; but that he should forbear to renew a  mention of the subject of it, exceedingly surprised her, who was no less  astonished, that, during three days, Count Morano neither visited Montoni, or  was named by him. Several conjectures arose in her mind. Sometimes she feared  that the dispute between them had been revived, and had ended fatally to the  Count. Sometimes she was inclined to hope, that weariness, or disgust at her  firm rejection of his suit had induced him to relinquish it; and, at others,  she suspected that he had now recourse to stratagem, and forbore his visits,  and prevailed with Montoni to forbear the repetition of his name, in the  expectation that gratitude and generosity would prevail with her to give him  the consent, which he could not hope from love. Thus passed the time in vain conjecture, and alternate hopes and fears, till  the day arrived when Montoni was to set out for the villa of Miarenti, which,  like the preceding ones, neither brought the Count, or the mention of him. Montoni having determined not to leave Venice, till towards evening, that he  might avoid the heats, and catch the cool breezes of night, embarked about an  hour before sun-set, with his family, in a barge, for the Brenta. Emily sat  alone near the stern of the vessel, and, as it floated slowly on, watched the  gay and lofty city lessening from her view, till its palaces seemed to sink in  the distant waves, while its loftier towers and domes, illumined by the  declining sun, appeared on the horizon, like those far-seen clouds which, in  more northern climes, often linger on the western verge, and catch the last  light of a summer's evening. Soon after, even these grew dim, and faded in  distance from her sight; but she still sat gazing on the vast scene of  cloudless sky, and mighty waters, and listening in pleasing awe to the  deep-sounding waves, while, as her eyes glanced over the Adriatic, towards the  opposite shores, which were, however, far beyond the reach of sight, she  thought of Greece, and, a thousand classical remembrances stealing to her mind,  she experienced that pensive luxury which is felt on viewing the scenes of  ancient story, and on comparing their present state of silence and solitude  with that of their former grandeur and animation. The scenes of the Illiad  illapsed in glowing colours to her fancy—scenes, once the haunt of  heroes—now lonely, and in ruins; but which still shone, in the poet's strain,  in all their youthful splendour. As her imagination painted with melancholy touches, the deserted plains of  Troy, such as they appeared in this after-day, she reanimated the landscape  with the following little story.      STANZAS   O'er Ilion's plains, where once the warrior bled,  And once the poet rais'd his deathless strain,  O'er Ilion's plains a weary driver led  His stately camels:  For the ruin'd fane   Wide round the lonely scene his glance he threw,  For now the red cloud faded in the west,  And twilight o'er the silent landscape drew  Her deep'ning veil; eastward his course he prest:   There, on the grey horizon's glimm'ring bound,  Rose the proud columns of deserted Troy,  And wandering shepherds now a shelter found  Within those walls, where princes wont to joy.   Beneath a lofty porch the driver pass'd,  Then, from his camels heav'd the heavy load;  Partook with them the simple, cool repast,  And in short vesper gave himself to God.   From distant lands with merchandise he came,  His all of wealth his patient servants bore;  Oft deep-drawn sighs his anxious wish proclaim  To reach, again, his happy cottage door;   For there, his wife, his little children, dwell;  Their smiles shall pay the toil of many an hour:  Ev'n now warm tears to expectation swell,  As fancy o'er his mind extends her pow'r.   A death-like stillness reign'd, where once the song,  The song of heroes, wak'd the midnight air,  Save, when a solemn murmur roll'd along,  That seem'd to say—'for future worlds prepare.'   For Time's imperious voice was frequent heard  Shaking the marble temple to its fall,  (By hands he long had conquer'd, vainly rear'd),  And distant ruins answer'd to his call.   While Hamet slept, his camels round him lay,  Beneath him, all his store of wealth was piled;  And here, his cruse and empty wallet lay,  And there, the flute that chear'd him in the wild.   The robber Tartar on his slumber stole,  For o'er the waste, at eve, he watch'd his train;  Ah! who his thirst of plunder shall control?  Who calls on him for mercy—calls in vain!   A poison'd poignard in his belt he wore,  A crescent sword depended at his side,  The deathful quiver at his back he bore,  And infants—at his very look had died!   The moon's cold beam athwart the temple fell,  And to his sleeping prey the Tartar led;  But soft!—a startled camel shook his bell,  Then stretch'd his limbs, and rear'd his drowsy head.   Hamet awoke! the poignard glitter'd high!  Swift from his couch he sprung, and 'scap'd the blow;  When from an unknown hand the arrows fly,  That lay the ruffian, in his vengeance, low.   He groan'd, he died! from forth a column'd gate  A fearful shepherd, pale and silent, crept,  Who, as he watch'd his folded flock star-late,  Had mark'd the robber steal where Hamet slept.   He fear'd his own, and sav'd a stranger's life!  Poor Hamet clasp'd him to his grateful heart;  Then, rous'd his camels for the dusty strife,  And, with the shepherd, hasten'd to depart.   And now, aurora breathes her fresh'ning gale,  And faintly trembles on the eastern cloud;  And now, the sun, from under twilight's veil,  Looks gaily forth, and melts her airy shroud.   Wide o'er the level plains, his slanting beams  Dart their long lines on Ilion's tower'd site;  The distant Hellespont with morning gleams,  And old Scamander winds his waves in light.   All merry sound the camel bells, so gay,  And merry beats fond Hamet's heart, for he,  E'er the dim evening steals upon the day,  His children, wife and happy home shall see. As Emily approached the shores of Italy she began to discriminate the rich  features and varied colouring of the landscape—the purple hills, groves of  orange pine and cypress, shading magnificent villas, and towns rising among  vineyards and plantations. The noble Brenta, pouring its broad waves into the  sea, now appeared, and, when she reached its mouth, the barge stopped, that the  horses might be fastened which were now to tow it up the stream. This done,  Emily gave a last look to the Adriatic, and to the dim sail,      that from the sky-mix'd wave  Dawns on the sight, and the barge slowly glided between the green and luxuriant slopes of the  river. The grandeur of the Palladian villas, that adorn these shores, was  considerably heightened by the setting rays, which threw strong contrasts of  light and shade upon the porticos and long arcades, and beamed a mellow lustre  upon the orangeries and the tall groves of pine and cypress, that overhung the  buildings. The scent of oranges, of flowering myrtles, and other odoriferous  plants was diffused upon the air, and often, from these embowered retreats, a  strain of music stole on the calm, and 'softened into silence.' The sun now sunk below the horizon, twilight fell over the landscape, and  Emily, wrapt in musing silence, continued to watch its features gradually  vanishing into obscurity. She remembered her many happy evenings, when with St.  Aubert she had observed the shades of twilight steal over a scene as beautiful  as this, from the gardens of La Vallee, and a tear fell to the memory of her  father. Her spirits were softened into melancholy by the influence of the hour,  by the low murmur of the wave passing under the vessel, and the stillness of  the air, that trembled only at intervals with distant music:—why else should  she, at these moments, have looked on her attachment to Valancourt with  presages so very afflicting, since she had but lately received letters from  him, that had soothed for a while all her anxieties? It now seemed to her  oppressed mind, that she had taken leave of him for ever, and that the  countries, which separated them, would never more be re-traced by her. She  looked upon Count Morano with horror, as in some degree the cause of this; but  apart from him, a conviction, if such that may be called, which arises from no  proof, and which she knew not how to account for, seized her mind—that she  should never see Valancourt again. Though she knew, that neither Morano's  solicitations, nor Montoni's commands had lawful power to enforce her  obedience, she regarded both with a superstitious dread, that they would  finally prevail. Lost in this melancholy reverie, and shedding frequent tears, Emily was at  length roused by Montoni, and she followed him to the cabin, where refreshments  were spread, and her aunt was seated alone. The countenance of Madame Montoni  was inflamed with resentment, that appeared to be the consequence of some  conversation she had held with her husband, who regarded her with a kind of  sullen disdain, and both preserved, for some time, a haughty silence. Montoni  then spoke to Emily of Mons. Quesnel: 'You will not, I hope, persist in  disclaiming your knowledge of the subject of my letter to him?' 'I had hoped, sir, that it was no longer necessary for me to disclaim it,' said  Emily, 'I had hoped, from your silence, that you was convinced of your error.' 'You have hoped impossibilities then,' replied Montoni; 'I might as reasonably  have expected to find sincerity and uniformity of conduct in one of your sex,  as you to convict me of error in this affair.' Emily blushed, and was silent; she now perceived too clearly, that she had  hoped an impossibility, for, where no mistake had been committed no conviction  could follow; and it was evident, that Montoni's conduct had not been the  consequence of mistake, but of design. Anxious to escape from conversation, which was both afflicting and humiliating  to her, she soon returned to the deck, and resumed her station near the stern,  without apprehension of cold, for no vapour rose from the water, and the air  was dry and tranquil; here, at least, the benevolence of nature allowed her the  quiet which Montoni had denied her elsewhere. It was now past midnight. The  stars shed a kind of twilight, that served to shew the dark outline of the  shores on either hand, and the grey surface of the river; till the moon rose  from behind a high palm grove, and shed her mellow lustre over the scene. The  vessel glided smoothly on: amid the stillness of the hour Emily heard, now and  then, the solitary voice of the barge-men on the bank, as they spoke to their  horses; while, from a remote part of the vessel, with melancholy song,      The sailor sooth'd,  Beneath the trembling moon, the midnight wave. Emily, meanwhile, anticipated her reception by Mons, and Madame Quesnel;  considered what she should say on the subject of La Vallee; and then, to  with-hold her mind from more anxious topics, tried to amuse herself by  discriminating the faint-drawn features of the landscape, reposing in the  moon-light. While her fancy thus wandered, she saw, at a distance, a building  peeping between the moon-light trees, and, as the barge approached, heard  voices speaking, and soon distinguished the lofty portico of a villa,  overshadowed by groves of pine and sycamore, which she recollected to be the  same, that had formerly been pointed out to her, as belonging to Madame  Quesnel's relative. The barge stopped at a flight of marble steps, which led up the bank to a lawn.  Lights appeared between some pillars beyond the portico. Montoni sent forward  his servant, and then disembarked with his family. They found Mons. and Madame  Quesnel, with a few friends, seated on sofas in the portico, enjoying the cool  breeze of the night, and eating fruits and ices, while some of their servants  at a little distance, on the river's bank, were performing a simple serenade.  Emily was now accustomed to the way of living in this warm country, and was not  surprised to find Mons. and Madame Quesnel in their portico, two hours after  midnight. The usual salutations being over, the company seated themselves in the portico,  and refreshments were brought them from the adjoining hall, where a banquet was  spread, and servants attended. When the bustle of this meeting had subsided,  and Emily had recovered from the little flutter into which it had thrown her  spirits, she was struck with the singular beauty of the hall, so perfectly  accommodated to the luxuries of the season. It was of white marble, and the  roof, rising into an open cupola, was supported by columns of the same  material. Two opposite sides of the apartment, terminating in open porticos,  admitted to the hall a full view of the gardens, and of the river scenery; in  the centre a fountain continually refreshed the air, and seemed to heighten the  fragrance, that breathed from the surrounding orangeries, while its dashing  waters gave an agreeable and soothing sound. Etruscan lamps, suspended from the  pillars, diffused a brilliant light over the interior part of the hall, leaving  the remoter porticos to the softer lustre of the moon. Mons. Quesnel talked apart to Montoni of his own affairs, in his usual strain  of self-importance; boasted of his new acquisitions, and then affected to pity  some disappointments, which Montoni had lately sustained. Meanwhile, the  latter, whose pride at least enabled him to despise such vanity as this, and  whose discernment at once detected under this assumed pity, the frivolous  malignity of Quesnel's mind, listened to him in contemptuous silence, till he  named his niece, and then they left the portico, and walked away into the  gardens. Emily, however, still attended to Madame Quesnel, who spoke of France (for even  the name of her native country was dear to her) and she found some pleasure in  looking at a person, who had lately been in it. That country, too, was  inhabited by Valancourt, and she listened to the mention of it, with a faint  hope, that he also would be named. Madame Quesnel, who, when she was in France,  had talked with rapture of Italy, now, that she was in Italy, talked with equal  praise of France, and endeavoured to excite the wonder and the envy of her  auditors by accounts of places, which they had not been happy enough to see. In  these descriptions she not only imposed upon them, but upon herself, for she  never thought a present pleasure equal to one, that was passed; and thus the  delicious climate, the fragrant orangeries and all the luxuries, which  surrounded her, slept unnoticed, while her fancy wandered over the distant  scenes of a northern country. Emily listened in vain for the name of Valancourt. Madame Montoni spoke in her  turn of the delights of Venice, and of the pleasure she expected from visiting  the fine castle of Montoni, on the Apennine; which latter mention, at least,  was merely a retaliating boast, for Emily well knew, that her aunt had no taste  for solitary grandeur, and, particularly, for such as the castle of Udolpho  promised. Thus the party continued to converse, and, as far as civility would  permit, to torture each other by mutual boasts, while they reclined on sofas in  the portico, and were environed with delights both from nature and art, by  which any honest minds would have been tempered to benevolence, and happy  imaginations would have been soothed into enchantment. The dawn, soon after, trembled in the eastern horizon, and the light tints of  morning, gradually expanding, shewed the beautifully declining forms of the  Italian mountains and the gleaming landscapes, stretched at their feet. Then  the sun-beams, shooting up from behind the hills, spread over the scene that  fine saffron tinge, which seems to impart repose to all it touches. The  landscape no longer gleamed; all its glowing colours were revealed, except that  its remoter features were still softened and united in the mist of distance,  whose sweet effect was heightened to Emily by the dark verdure of the pines and  cypresses, that over-arched the foreground of the river. The market people, passing with their boats to Venice, now formed a moving  picture on the Brenta. Most of these had little painted awnings, to shelter  their owners from the sun-beams, which, together with the piles of fruit and  flowers, displayed beneath, and the tasteful simplicity of the peasant girls,  who watched the rural treasures, rendered them gay and striking objects. The  swift movement of the boats down the current, the quick glance of oars in the  water, and now and then the passing chorus of peasants, who reclined under the  sail of their little bark, or the tones of some rustic instrument, played by a  girl, as she sat near her sylvan cargo, heightened the animation and festivity  of the scene. When Montoni and M. Quesnel had joined the ladies, the party left the portico  for the gardens, where the charming scenery soon withdrew Emily's thoughts from  painful subjects. The majestic forms and rich verdure of cypresses she had  never seen so perfect before: groves of cedar, lemon, and orange, the spiry  clusters of the pine and poplar, the luxuriant chesnut and oriental plane,  threw all their pomp of shade over these gardens; while bowers of flowering  myrtle and other spicy shrubs mingled their fragrance with that of flowers,  whose vivid and various colouring glowed with increased effect beneath the  contrasted umbrage of the groves. The air also was continually refreshed by  rivulets, which, with more taste than fashion, had been suffered to wander  among the green recesses. Emily often lingered behind the party, to contemplate the distant landscape,  that closed a vista, or that gleamed beneath the dark foliage of the  foreground;—the spiral summits of the mountains, touched with a purple tint,  broken and steep above, but shelving gradually to their base; the open valley,  marked by no formal lines of art; and the tall groves of cypress, pine and  poplar, sometimes embellished by a ruined villa, whose broken columns appeared  between the branches of a pine, that seemed to droop over their fall. From other parts of the gardens, the character of the view was entirely  changed, and the fine solitary beauty of the landscape shifted for the crowded  features and varied colouring of inhabitation. The sun was now gaining fast upon the sky, and the party quitted the gardens,  and retired to repose.
