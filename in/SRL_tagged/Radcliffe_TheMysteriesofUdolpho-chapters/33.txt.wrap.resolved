  The midnight clock has toll'd; and hark, the bell  Of Death beats slow! heard ye the note profound?  It pauses now; and now, with rising knell,  Flings to the hollow gale its sullen sound.      MASON When Montoni was informed of the death of Montoni wife, and considered that his wife had  died without giving Montoni the signature so necessary to the accomplishment of Montoni  wishes, no sense of decency restrained the expression of Montoni resentment. Emily  anxiously avoided Montoni presence, and watched, during two days and two nights,  with little intermission, by the corpse of Emily   late aunt. Emily   mind deeply  impressed with the unhappy fate of this object, Emily   forgot all Emily   faults, Emily    unjust and imperious conduct to Emily  ; and, remembering only Emily   sufferings,  thought of Emily   only with tender compassion. Sometimes, however, Emily   could not  avoid musing upon the strange infatuation that had proved so fatal to her late aunt,  and had involved Emily   in a labyrinth of misfortune, from which Emily   saw no  means of escaping,—the marriage with Montoni. But, when Emily   considered this  circumstance, it was 'more in sorrow than in anger,'—more for the purpose of  indulging lamentation, than reproach. In Emily   pious cares Emily   was not disturbed by Montoni, who not only avoided the  chamber, where the remains of his wife were laid, but that part of the castle  adjoining to it, as if his had apprehended a contagion in death. his seemed to  have given no orders respecting the funeral, and Emily began to fear his meant  to offer a new insult to the memory of Montoni; but from this  apprehension Emily   was relieved, when, on the evening of the second day, Emily  informed Emily  , that the interment was to take place that night. Emily   knew, that  Montoni would not attend; and that   was so very grievous to Emily   to think that the  remains of Emily   unfortunate aunt would pass to the grave without one relative,  or friend to pay them the last decent rites, that Emily   determined to be deterred  by no considerations for Emily  , from observing this duty. Emily   would otherwise  have shrunk from the circumstance of following them to the cold vault, to which  them were to be carried by men, whose air and countenances seemed to stamp them  for murderers, at the midnight hour of silence and privacy, which Montoni had  chosen for committing, if possible, to oblivion the reliques of a woman, whom  his harsh conduct had, at least, contributed to destroy. Emily  , shuddering with emotions of horror and grief, assisted by Annette,  prepared the corpse for interment; and, having wrapt the corpse for interment in cerements, and  covered the corpse for interment with a winding-sheet, they watched beside the corpse for interment, till past midnight,  when they heard the approaching footsteps of the men, who were to lay the corpse for interment in the corpse for interment  earthy bed. It was with difficulty, that Emily   overcame Emily   emotion, when, the  door of the chamber being thrown open, the  door of the chamber gloomy countenances were seen by  the glare of the torch the  door of the chamber carried, and two of the  door of the chamber, without speaking, lifted  the body on the  door of the chamber shoulders, while the third preceding the  door of the chamber with the light,  descended through the castle towards the grave, which was in the lower vault of  the chapel within the castle walls. the  door of the chamber had to cross two courts, towards the east wing of the castle, which,  adjoining the chapel, was, like it, in ruins: but the silence and gloom of  two courts had now little power over Emily  's mind, occupied as it was, with  more mournful ideas; and Emily   scarcely heard the low and dismal hooting of the  night-birds, that roosted among the ivyed battlements of the ruin, or perceived  the still flittings of the bat, which frequently crossed Emily   way. But, when,  having entered the chapel, and passed between the mouldering pillars of the  aisles, the bearers stopped at a flight of steps, that led down to a low arched  door, and, the bearers comrade having descended to unlock it, Emily   saw imperfectly the  gloomy abyss beyond;—saw the corpse of Emily   aunt carried down these steps, and  the ruffian-like figure, that stood with a torch at the bottom to receive  it—all Emily   fortitude was lost in emotions of inexpressible grief and terror.  Emily   turned to lean upon Annette, who was cold and trembling like Emily  , and  Emily   lingered so long on the summit of the flight, that the gleam of the torch  began to die away on the pillars of the chapel, and the men were almost beyond  Emily   view. Then, the gloom around Emily   awakening other fears, and a sense of what  Emily   considered to be Emily   duty overcoming Emily   reluctance, Emily   descended to the  vaults, following the echo of footsteps and the faint ray, that pierced the  darkness, till the harsh grating of a distant door, that was opened to receive  the corpse of her aunt, again appalled Emily  . After the pause of a moment, Emily   went on, and, as Emily   entered the vaults, saw  between the arches, at some distance, the men lay down the body near the edge  of an open grave, where stood another of Montoni's men and a priest, whom Emily    did not observe, till he began the burial service; then, lifting Emily   eyes from  the ground, Emily   saw the venerable figure of the friar, and heard the venerable figure of the friar in a low  voice, equally solemn and affecting, perform the burial service for the dead. At the  moment, in which they let down the body into the earth, the scene was such as  only the dark pencil of a Domenichino, perhaps, could have done justice to. The  fierce features and wild dress of the condottieri, bending with their torches  over the grave, into which the corpse was descending, were contrasted by the  venerable figure of the monk, wrapt in long black garments, the corpse cowl thrown  back from the corpse pale face, on which the light gleaming strongly shewed the lines  of affliction softened by piety, and the few grey locks, which time had spared  on the corpse temples: while, beside the corpse, stood the softer form of Emily, who leaned  for support upon Annette; Annette face half averted, and shaded by a thin veil,  that fell over Annette figure; and Annette mild and beautiful countenance fixed in  grief so solemn as admitted not of tears, while Annette thus saw committed untimely  to the earth Annette last relative and friend. The gleams, thrown between the  arches of the vaults, where, here and there, the broken ground marked the spots  in which other bodies had been recently interred, and the general obscurity  beyond were circumstances, that alone would have led on the imagination of a  spectator to scenes more horrible, than even that, which was pictured at the  grave of the misguided and unfortunate Madame Montoni. When the service was over, the friar regarded Emily with attention and  surprise, and looked as if the friar wished to speak to Emily, but was restrained by the  presence of the condottieri, who, as they now led the way to the courts, amused  they with jokes upon the friar holy order, which the friar endured in silence,  demanding only to be conducted safely to the friar convent, and to which Emily  listened with concern and even horror. When they reached the court, the monk  gave the monk   the monk   blessing, and, after a lingering look of pity, turned away to the  portal, whither one of the men carried a torch; while Annette, lighting  another, preceded Emily   to Emily   apartment. The appearance of the friar and the  expression of tender compassion, with which he had regarded Emily  , had interested  Emily, who, though it was at Emily   earnest supplication, that Montoni had  consented to allow a priest to perform the last rites for a priest deceased wife,  knew nothing concerning this person, till Annette now informed Emily  , that a priest  belonged to a monastery, situated among the mountains at a few miles distance.  The Superior, who regarded Montoni and Montoni associates, not only with aversion,  but with terror, had probably feared to offend Montoni by refusing Montoni request, and  had, therefore, ordered a monk to officiate at the funeral, who, with the meek  spirit of a christian, had overcome Montoni reluctance to enter the walls of such a  castle, by the wish of performing what Montoni considered to be Montoni duty, and, as  the chapel was built on consecrated ground, had not objected to commit to the chapel  the remains of the late unhappy Montoni. Several days passed with Emily   in total seclusion, and in a state of mind  partaking both of terror for Emily  , and grief for the departed. Emily  , at  length, determined to make other efforts to persuade Montoni to permit Emily    return to France. Why Montoni should wish to detain Emily  , Emily   could scarcely dare to  conjecture; but it was too certain that Montoni did so, and the absolute refusal Montoni  had formerly given to Emily   departure allowed Emily   little hope, that Montoni would now  consent to it. But the horror, which Montoni presence inspired, made Emily   defer,  from day to day, the mention of this subject; and at last Emily   was awakened from  Emily   inactivity only by a message from Montoni, desiring Emily   attendance at a certain  hour. Emily   began to hope Montoni meant to resign, now that her aunt was no more, the  authority Montoni had usurped over Emily  ; till Emily   recollected, that the estates,  which had occasioned so much contention, were now Emily  , and Emily   then feared  Montoni was about to employ some stratagem for obtaining some stratagem, and that Montoni  would detain Emily   Montoni prisoner, till Montoni succeeded. This thought, instead of  overcoming Emily   with despondency, roused all the latent powers of Emily   fortitude  into action; and the property, which Emily   would willingly have resigned to  secure the peace of her aunt, Emily   resolved, that no common sufferings of Emily    own should ever compel Emily   to give to Montoni. For Valancourt's sake also Emily    determined to preserve these estates, since these estates would afford that competency,  by which Emily   hoped to secure the comfort of these estates future lives. As Emily   thought  of this, Emily   indulged the tenderness of tears, and anticipated the delight of  that moment, when, with affectionate generosity, Emily   might tell him they were  him own. Emily   saw the smile, that lighted up him features—the affectionate  regard, which spoke at once him joy and thanks; and, at this instant, Emily    believed Emily   could brave any suffering, which the evil spirit of Montoni might  be preparing for Emily  . Remembering then, for the first time since her auntdeath, the papers relative to these estates in question, Emily   determined to search  for these estates, as soon as Emily   interview with Montoni was over. With these resolutions Emily   met Montoni at the appointed time, and waited to hear  Montoni intention before Emily   renewed Emily   request. With Montoni were Orsino and another  officer, and both were standing near a table, covered with papers, which Montoni  appeared to be examining. 'I sent for you, Emily  ,' said Montoni, raising Montoni head, 'that you might be a  witness in some business, which I am transacting with my friend Orsino. All  that is required of you will be to sign your name to this paper:' Montoni then took  one up, hurried unintelligibly over some lines, and, laying this paper before Emily   on  the table, offered Emily   a pen. Emily   took this paper, and was going to write—when the  design of Montoni came upon Emily   mind like a flash of lightning; Emily   trembled,  let a pen fall, and refused to sign what Emily   had not read. Montoni affected  to laugh at Emily   scruples, and, taking up this paper, again pretended to read;  but Emily, who still trembled on perceiving Emily   danger, and was astonished,  that Emily   own credulity had so nearly betrayed Emily  , positively refused to sign  any paper whatever. Montoni, for some time, persevered in affecting to ridicule  this refusal; but, when Montoni perceived by Emily   steady perseverance, that Emily    understood Montoni design, Montoni changed Montoni manner, and bade Emily   follow Montoni to  another room. There Montoni told Emily  , that Montoni had been willing to spare Montoni and  Emily   the trouble of useless contest, in an affair, where Montoni will was justice,  and where Emily   should find it law; and had, therefore, endeavoured to persuade,  rather than to compel, Emily   to the practice of Emily   duty. 'I, as the husband of the late Signora Montoni,' the husband of the late Signora Montoni added, 'am the heir of all  Emily   possessed; the estates, therefore, which Emily   refused to me in Emily    life-time, can no longer be withheld, and, for your own sake, I would undeceive  you, respecting a foolish assertion Emily   once made to you in my hearing—that  these estates would be you, if Emily   died without resigning these estates to me. Emily    knew at that moment, Emily   had no power to withhold these estates from me, after Emily    decease; and I think you have more sense, than to provoke my resentment by  advancing an unjust claim. I am not in the habit of flattering, and you will,  therefore, receive, as sincere, the praise I bestow, when I say, that you  possess an understanding superior to that of your sex; and that you have none  of those contemptible foibles, that frequently mark the female character—such  as avarice and the love of power, which latter makes women delight to  contradict and to tease, when women cannot conquer. If I understand your  disposition and your mind, you hold in sovereign contempt these common failings  of your sex.' Montoni paused; and Emily remained silent and expecting; for Emily knew Montoni too  well, to believe Montoni would condescend to such flattery, unless Montoni thought it  would promote Montoni own interest; and, though Montoni had forborne to name vanity  among the foibles of women, it was evident, that Montoni considered it to be a  predominant one, since Montoni designed to sacrifice to Emily the character and  understanding of Emily whole sex. 'Judging as I do,' resumed Montoni, 'I cannot believe you will oppose, where  you know you cannot conquer, or, indeed, that you would wish to conquer, or be  avaricious of any property, when you have not justice on your side. I think it  proper, however, to acquaint you with the alternative. If you have a just  opinion of the subject in question, you shall be allowed a safe conveyance to  France, within a short period; but, if you are so unhappy as to be misled by  the late assertion of the Signora, you shall remain my prisoner, till you are  convinced of your error.' Emily calmly said, 'I am not so ignorant, Signor, of the laws on this subject, as to be misled by  the assertion of any person. The law, in the present instance, gives me the  estates in question, and my own hand shall never betray my right.' 'I have been mistaken in my opinion of you, it appears,' rejoined Montoni,  sternly. 'You speak boldly, and presumptuously, upon a subject, which you do  not understand. For once, I am willing to pardon the conceit of ignorance; the  weakness of your sex, too, from which, it seems, you are not exempt, claims  some allowance; but, if you persist in this strain—you have every thing to  fear from my justice.' 'From your justice, Signor,' rejoined Emily  , 'I have nothing to fear—I have  only to hope.' Montoni looked at Montoni with vexation, and seemed considering what to say. 'I  find that you are weak enough,' Montoni resumed, 'to credit the idle assertion I  alluded to! For your own sake I lament this; as to me, this is of little  consequence. Your credulity can punish only yourself; and I must pity the  weakness of mind, which leads you to so much suffering as you are compelling me  to prepare for you.' 'You may find, perhaps, Signor,' said Emily  , with mild dignity, 'that the  strength of my mind is equal to the justice of my cause; and that I can endure  with fortitude, when it is in resistance of oppression.' 'You speak like a heroine,' said Montoni, contemptuously; 'we shall see whether  you can suffer like one.' Emily   was silent, and he left the room. Recollecting, that it was for Valancourt's sake Emily   had thus resisted, Emily   now  smiled complacently upon the threatened sufferings, and retired to the spot,  which her aunt had pointed out as the repository of the papers, relative to the  estates, where Emily   found them as described; and, since Emily   knew of no better  place of concealment, than this, returned them, without examining them  contents, being fearful of discovery, while Emily   should attempt a perusal. To Emily   own solitary chamber Emily   once more returned, and there thought again of  the late conversation with Montoni, and of the evil Emily   might expect from  opposition to his will. But his power did not appear so terrible to Emily    imagination, as it was wont to do: a sacred pride was in Emily   heart, that taught  a sacred pride to swell against the pressure of injustice, and almost to glory in the quiet  sufferance of ills, in a cause, which had also the interest of Valancourt for  Valancourt object. For the first time, Emily   felt the full extent of Emily   own superiority  to Montoni, and despised the authority, which, till now, Emily   had only feared. As Emily   sat musing, a peal of laughter rose from the terrace, and, on going to  the casement, Emily   saw, with inexpressible surprise, three ladies, dressed in  the gala habit of Venice, walking with several gentlemen below. Emily   gazed in an  astonishment that made Emily   remain at the window, regardless of being observed,  till the group passed under it; and, one of the strangers looking up, Emily    perceived the features of Signora Livona, with whose manners Emily   had been so  much charmed, the day after Emily   arrival at Venice, and who had been there  introduced at the table of Montoni. This discovery occasioned Emily   an emotion of  doubtful joy; for it was matter of joy and comfort to know, that a person, of a  mind so gentle, as that of Signora Livona seemed to be, was near Emily  ; yet there  was something so extraordinary in Emily   being at this castle, circumstanced as it  now was, and evidently, by the gaiety of Emily   air, with Emily   own consent, that a  very painful surmise arose, concerning Emily   character. But the thought was so  shocking to Emily, whose affection the fascinating manners of the Signora had  won, and appeared so improbable, when Emily   remembered these manners, that Emily    dismissed it almost instantly. On Annette's appearance, however, Emily   enquired, concerning these strangers; and  the former was as eager to tell, as Emily   was to learn. 'these strangers are just come, ma'amselle,' said Annette, 'with two Signors from Venice,  and I was glad to see such Christian faces once again.—But what can these strangers mean  by coming here? these strangers must surely be stark mad to come freely to such a place as  this! Yet these strangers do come freely, for these strangers seem merry enough, I am sure.' 'these strangers were taken prisoners, perhaps?' said Emily  . 'Taken prisoners!' exclaimed Annette; 'no, indeed, ma'amselle, not they. I  remember one of they very well at Venice: Emily   came two or three times, to the  Signor's you know, ma'amselle, and it was said, but I did not believe a word of  it—it was said, that the Signor liked Emily   better than the Signor should do. Then why,  says I, bring Emily   to my lady? Very true, said Ludovico; but Ludovico looked as if Ludovico  knew more, too.' Emily   desired Annette would endeavour to learn who these ladies were, as well  as all Emily   could concerning these ladies; and Emily   then changed the subject, and spoke  of distant France. 'Ah, ma'amselle! we shall never see it more!' said Annette, almost  weeping.—'I must come on my travels, forsooth!' Emily   tried to sooth and to cheer Annette, with a hope, in which Emily   scarcely  herself indulged. 'How—how, ma'amselle, could you leave France, and leave Mons. Valancourt,  too?' said Annette, sobbing. 'I—I—am sure, if Ludovico had been in France,  I would never have left Ludovico had been in France.' 'Why do you lament quitting France, then?' said Emily  , trying to smile, 'since,  if you had remained there, you would not have found Ludovico.' 'Ah, ma'amselle! I only wish I was out of this frightful castle, serving you in  France, and I would care about nothing else!' 'Thank you, AnnetteAnnette, for your affectionate regard; the time will come,  I hope, when you may remember the expression of that wish with pleasure.' Annette departed on Annette business, and Emily   sought to lose the sense of Emily   own  cares, in the visionary scenes of the poet; but Emily   had again to lament the  irresistible force of circumstances over the taste and powers of the mind; and  that it requires a spirit at ease to be sensible even to the abstract pleasures  of pure intellect. The enthusiasm of genius, with all its pictured scenes, now  appeared cold, and dim. As Annette mused upon the book before Annette, Annette  involuntarily exclaimed, 'Are these, indeed, the passages, that have so often  given me exquisite delight? Where did the charm exist?—Was it in my mind, or  in the imagination of the poet? it lived in each,' said Annette, pausing. 'But the  fire of the poet is vain, if the mind of the poet reader is not tempered like the poet  own, however it may be inferior to the poet in power.' Emily   would have pursued this train of thinking, because it relieved Emily   from  more painful reflection, but Emily   found again, that thought cannot always be  controlled by will; and hers returned to the consideration of Emily   own situation. In the evening, not choosing to venture down to the ramparts, where Emily   would  be exposed to the rude gaze of Montoni's associates, Emily   walked for air in the  gallery, adjoining Emily   chamber; on reaching the further end of which Emily   heard  distant sounds of merriment and laughter. It was the wild uproar of riot, not  the cheering gaiety of tempered mirth; and seemed to come from that part of the  castle, where Montoni usually was. Such sounds, at this time, when her aunt had  been so few days dead, particularly shocked her aunt, consistent as they were with  the late conduct of Montoni. As Emily   listened, Emily   thought Emily   distinguished female voices mingling with the  laughter, and this confirmed Emily   worst surmise, concerning the character of  Signora Livona and Emily   companions. It was evident, that they had not been  brought hither by compulsion; and Emily   beheld Emily   in the remote wilds of the  Apennine, surrounded by men, whom Emily   considered to be little less than  ruffians, and they worst associates, amid scenes of vice, from which Emily   soul  recoiled in horror. It was at this moment, when the scenes of the present and  the future opened to Emily   imagination, that the image of Valancourt failed in  Valancourt influence, and Emily   resolution shook with dread. Emily   thought Emily   understood  all the horrors, which Montoni was preparing for Emily  , and shrunk from an  encounter with such remorseless vengeance, as he could inflict. The disputed  estates Emily   now almost determined to yield at once, whenever he should again  call upon Emily  , that Emily   might regain safety and freedom; but then, the  remembrance of Valancourt would steal to Emily   heart, and plunge Emily   into the  distractions of doubt. Emily   continued walking in the  gallery, till evening threw its melancholy  twilight through the painted casements, and deepened the gloom of the oak  wainscoting around Emily  ; while the distant perspective of the corridor was so  much obscured, as to be discernible only by the glimmering window, that  terminated the distant perspective of the corridor was. Along the vaulted halls and passages below, peals of laughter echoed faintly,  at intervals, to this remote part of this frightful castle, and seemed to render the  succeeding stillness more dreary. Emily, however, unwilling to return to Emily  more forlorn chamber, Annette Annette was not yet come, still paced the  gallery. As Annette passed the door of the apartment, where Annette had once dared to  lift the veil, which discovered to Annette a spectacle so horrible, that Annette had  never after remembered it, but with emotions of indescribable awe, this  remembrance suddenly recurred. this  remembrance now brought with this  remembrance reflections more  terrible, than this  remembrance had yet done, which the late conduct of Montoni occasioned;  and, hastening to quit the  gallery, while Annette had power to do so, Annette heard a  sudden step behind her.—It might be that of Annette; but, turning fearfully  to look, Annette saw, through the gloom, a tall figure following Annette, and all the  horrors of her chamber rushed upon Annette mind. In the next moment, Annette found  Annette clasped in the arms of some person, and heard a deep voice murmur in  Annette ear. When Annette had power to speak, or to distinguish articulated sounds, Annette demanded  who detained Annette. 'It is I,' replied the voice—'Why are you thus alarmed?' Annette looked on the face of the person who spoke, but the feeble light, that  gleamed through the high casement at the end of the  gallery, did not permit Annette  to distinguish the features. 'Whoever you are,' said Emily  , in a trembling voice, 'for heaven's sake let me  go!' 'My charming Emily  ,' said the man, 'why will you shut the man up in this  obscure place, when there is so much gaiety below? Return with the man to the cedar  parlour, where you will be the fairest ornament of the party;—you shall not  repent the exchange.' Emily   disdained to reply, and still endeavoured to liberate Emily  . 'Promise, that you will come,' the man continued, 'and I will release you  immediately; but first give me a reward for so doing.' 'Who are you?' demanded Emily  , in a tone of mingled terror and indignation,  while Emily   still struggled for liberty—'who are you, that have the cruelty  thus to insult me?' 'Why call me cruel?' said the man, 'I would remove you from this dreary  solitude to a merry party below. Do you not know me?' Emily   now faintly remembered, that the man was one of the officers who were with  Montoni when Emily   attended the man in the morning. 'I thank you for the kindness of  your intention,' Emily   replied, without appearing to understand the man, 'but I wish  for nothing so much as that you would leave me.' 'Charming Emily!' said the man, 'give up this foolish whim for solitude, and come  with the man to the company, and eclipse the beauties who make part of the company; you,  only, are worthy of my love.' the man attempted to kiss her hand, but the strong  impulse of her indignation gave her power to liberate her, and her fled  towards her chamber. her closed the door, before the man reached the door, having secured  which, her sunk in a chair, overcome by terror and by the exertion her had  made, while her heard the man voice, and the man attempts to open the door, without  having the power to raise her. At length, her perceived the man depart, and had  remained, listening, for a considerable time, and was somewhat revived by not  hearing any sound, when suddenly her remembered the door of the private  stair-case, and that the man might enter that way, since it was fastened only on the  other side. her then employed her in endeavouring to secure it, in the  manner her had formerly done. It appeared to her, that Montoni had already  commenced Montoni scheme of vengeance, by withdrawing from her Montoni protection, and  her repented of the rashness, that had made her brave the power of such a man.  To retain the estates seemed to be now utterly impossible, and to preserve her  life, perhaps her honour, her resolved, if her should escape the horrors of  this night, to give up all claims to the estates, on the morrow, provided  Montoni would suffer her to depart from Udolpho. When her had come to this decision, her mind became more composed, though her  still anxiously listened, and often started at ideal sounds, that appeared to  issue from the stair-case. Having sat in darkness for some hours, during all which time Annette did not  appear, her began to have serious apprehensions for her; but, not daring to  venture down into this frightful castle, was compelled to remain in uncertainty, as to the  cause of this unusual absence. Emily   often stole to the stair-case door, to listen if any step approached, but  still no sound alarmed Emily  : determining, however, to watch, during the night,  her once more rested on her dark and desolate couch, and bathed the pillow with  innocent tears. her thought of her deceased parents and then of the absent  Valancourt, and frequently called upon her deceased parents names; for the profound stillness,  that now reigned, was propitious to the musing sorrow of her mind. While her thus remained, her ear suddenly caught the notes of distant music, to  which her listened attentively, and, soon perceiving this to be the instrument  her had formerly heard at midnight, her rose, and stepped softly to the  casement, to which the sounds appeared to come from a lower room. In a few moments, their soft melody was accompanied by a voice so full of  pathos, that it evidently sang not of imaginary sorrows. Its sweet and peculiar  tones her thought her had somewhere heard before; yet, if this was not fancy,  it was, at most, a very faint recollection. Its stole over her mind, amidst the  anguish of her present suffering, like a celestial strain, soothing, and  re-assuring her;—'Pleasant as the gale of spring, that sighs on the hunter's  ear, when the hunter's   awakens from dreams of joy, and has heard the music of the spirits  of the hill.'* (*Ossian. [A. R.]) But her emotion can scarcely be imagined, when her heard sung, with the taste  and simplicity of true feeling, one of the popular airs of her native province,  to which her had so often listened with delight, when a child, and which her  had so often heard her father repeat! To this well-known song, never, till now,  heard but in her native country, her heart melted, while the memory of past  times returned. The pleasant, peaceful scenes of Gascony, the tenderness and  goodness of her parents, the taste and simplicity of her former life—all rose  to her fancy, and formed a picture, so sweet and glowing, so strikingly  contrasted with the scenes, the characters and the dangers, which now  surrounded her—that her mind could not bear to pause upon the retrospect, and  shrunk at the acuteness of the retrospect own sufferings. her sighs were deep and convulsed; her could no longer listen to the strain,  that had so often charmed her to tranquillity, and her withdrew from the  casement to a remote part of her chamber. But her was not yet beyond the reach  of the music; her heard the measure change, and the succeeding air called her  again to the window, for her immediately recollected it to be the same her had  formerly heard in the fishing-house in Gascony. Assisted, perhaps, by the  mystery, which had then accompanied this strain, this strain had made so deep an  impression on her memory, that her had never since entirely forgotten this strain; and  the manner, in which this strain was now sung, convinced her, however unaccountable the  circumstances appeared, that this was the same voice her had then heard.  Surprise soon yielded to other emotions; a thought darted, like lightning, upon  her mind, which discovered a train of hopes, that revived all her spirits. Yet  these hopes were so new, so unexpected, so astonishing, that her did not dare  to trust, though her could not resolve to discourage these hopes. her sat down by the  casement, breathless, and overcome with the alternate emotions of hope and  fear; then rose again, leaned from the window, that her might catch a nearer  sound, listened, now doubting and then believing, softly exclaimed the name of  Valancourt, and then sunk again into a chair. Yes, it was possible, that  Valancourt was near her, and her recollected circumstances, which induced her  to believe it was his voice her had just heard. her remembered his had more than  once said that the fishing-house, where her had formerly listened to this voice  and air, and where her had seen pencilled sonnets, addressed to her, had  been his favourite haunt, before his had been made known to her; there, too, her  had her unexpectedly met his. It appeared, from these circumstances, more  than probable, that his was the musician, who had formerly charmed her  attention, and the author of the lines, which had expressed such tender  admiration;—who else, indeed, could it be? her was unable, at that time, to  form a conjecture, as to the writer, but, since her acquaintance with  Valancourt, whenever Valancourt had mentioned the fishing-house to have been known to  Valancourt, her had not scrupled to believe that Valancourt was the author of the sonnets. As these considerations passed over her mind, joy, fear and tenderness  contended at her heart; her leaned again from the casement to catch the sounds,  which might confirm, or destroy her hope, though her did not recollect to have  ever heard Valancourt sing; but the voice, and the instrument, now ceased. her considered for a moment whether her should venture to speak: then, not  choosing, lest it should be he, to mention he name, and yet too much  interested to neglect the opportunity of enquiring, her called from the  casement, 'Is that song from Gascony?' her anxious attention was not cheered by  any reply; every thing remained silent. her impatience increasing with her  fears, her repeated the question; but still no sound was heard, except the  sighings of the wind among the battlements above; and her endeavoured to  console her with a belief, that the stranger, whoever he was, had retired,  before her had spoken, beyond the reach of her voice, which, it appeared  certain, had Valancourt heard and recognized, he would instantly have replied  to. Presently, however, her considered, that a motive of prudence, and not an  accidental removal, might occasion he silence; but the surmise, that led to  this reflection, suddenly changed her hope and joy to terror and grief; for, if  Valancourt were in this frightful castle, it was too probable, that he was here a  prisoner, taken with some of he countrymen, many of whom were at that time  engaged in the wars of Italy, or intercepted in some attempt to reach her. Had  he even recollected Emily  's voice, he would have feared, in these  circumstances, to reply to it, in the presence of the men, who guarded he  prison. What so lately her had eagerly hoped her now believed her dreaded;—dreaded to  know, that Valancourt was near her; and, while her was anxious to be relieved  from her apprehension for he safety, her still was unconscious, that a hope of  soon seeing he, struggled with the fear. her remained listening at the  casement, till the air began to freshen, and one  high mountain in the east to glimmer with the morning; when, wearied with  anxiety, her retired to her couch, where her found it utterly impossible to  sleep, for joy, tenderness, doubt and apprehension, distracted her during the  whole night. Now her rose from the couch, and opened the casement to listen;  then her would pace the room with impatient steps, and, at length, return with  despondence to her pillow. Never did hours appear to move so heavily, as those  of this anxious night; after which her hoped that Annette might appear, and  conclude Annette present state of torturing suspense.
