       I think it is the weakness of mine eyes,  That shapes this monstrous apparition.
this monstrous apparition comes upon me!
JULIUS CAESAR Daylight dispelled from Emily's mind the glooms of superstition, but not those  of apprehension.
The Count Morano was the first image, that occurred to The Count Morano  waking thoughts, and then came a train of anticipated evils, which The Count Morano could  neither conquer, nor avoid.
The Count Morano rose, and, to relieve The Count Morano mind from the busy  ideas, that tormented it, compelled The Count Morano to notice external objects.
From  The Count Morano casement The Count Morano looked out upon the wild grandeur of the scene, closed nearly  on all sides by alpine steeps, whose tops, peeping over each other, faded from  the eye in misty hues, while the promontories below were dark with woods, that  swept down to their base, and stretched along the narrow vallies.
The rich pomp  of these woods was particularly delightful to Emily; and Emily viewed with  astonishment the fortifications of the castle spreading along a vast extent of  rock, and now partly in decay, the grandeur of the ramparts below, and the  towers and battlements and various features of the fabric above.
From these Emily  sight wandered over the cliffs and woods into the valley, along which foamed a  broad and rapid stream, seen falling among the crags of an opposite mountain,  now flashing in the sun-beams, and now shadowed by over-arching pines, till over-arching pines  was entirely concealed by their thick foliage.
Again over-arching pines burst from beneath this  darkness in one broad sheet of foam, and fell thundering into the vale.
Nearer,  towards the west, opened the mountain-vista, which Emily had viewed with such  sublime emotion, on Emily approach to the castle: a thin dusky vapour, that rose  from the valley, overspread the castle features with a sweet obscurity.
As this  ascended and caught the sun-beams, this   kindled into a crimson tint, and touched  with exquisite beauty the woods and cliffs, over which this   passed to the summit  of the mountains; then, as the veil drew up, the veil was delightful to watch the  gleaming objects, that progressively disclosed the  gleaming objects in the valley—the  green turf—dark woods—little rocky recesses—a few peasants' huts—the  foaming stream—a herd of cattle, and various images of pastoral beauty.
Then,  the pine-forests brightened, and then the broad breast of the mountains, till,  at length, the mist settled round their summit, touching their with a ruddy  glow.
The features of the vista now appeared distinctly, and the broad deep  shadows, that fell from the lower cliffs, gave strong effect to the streaming  splendour above; while the mountains, gradually sinking in the perspective,  appeared to shelve into the Adriatic sea, for such Emily imagined to be the  gleam of blueish light, that terminated the view.
Thus Emily endeavoured to amuse Emily fancy, and was not unsuccessful.
The breezy  freshness of the morning, too, revived Emily.
Emily raised Emily thoughts in prayer,  which Emily felt always most disposed to do, when viewing the sublimity of  nature, and Emily mind recovered its strength.
When Emily turned from the casement, Emily eyes glanced upon the door Emily had so  carefully guarded, on the preceding night, and Emily now determined to examine  whither her eyes led; but, on advancing to remove the chairs, Emily perceived, that  the chairs were already moved a little way.
Emily surprise cannot be easily imagined,  when, in the next minute, Emily perceived that the door was fastened.—She felt,  as if Emily had seen an apparition.
The door of the corridor was locked as Emily  had left The door of the corridor, but this door, which could be secured only on the outside, must  have been bolted, during the night.
Emily became seriously uneasy at the thought  of sleeping again in a chamber, thus liable to intrusion, so remote, too, as it  was from the family, and Emily determined to mention the circumstance to Madame  Montoni, and to request a change.
After some perplexity Emily found Emily way into the great hall, and to the room,  which Emily had left, on the preceding night, where breakfast was spread, and Emily  aunt was alone, for Montoni had been walking over the environs of the castle,  examining the condition of Montoni fortifications, and talking for some time with  Carlo.
Emily observed that her  aunt had been weeping, and her  aunt heart softened  towards her  aunt, with an affection, that shewed itself in her  aunt manner, rather than  in words, while her  aunt carefully avoided the appearance of having noticed, that  her  aunt was unhappy.
her  aunt seized the opportunity of Montoni's absence to mention the  circumstance of the door, to request that her  aunt might be allowed another  apartment, and to enquire again, concerning the occasion of their sudden  journey.
On the first subject her  aunt referred her  aunt to Montoni, positively  refusing to interfere in the affair; on the last, her  aunt professed utter ignorance.
Emily, then, with a wish of making her  aunt more reconciled to her  aunt situation,  praised the grandeur of the castle and the surrounding scenery, and endeavoured  to soften every unpleasing circumstance attending it.
But, though misfortune  had somewhat conquered the asperities of Montoni temper, and, by  increasing her  aunt cares for her  aunt, had taught her  aunt to feel in some degree for  others, the capricious love of rule, which nature had planted and habit had  nourished in her  aunt heart, was not subdued.
her  aunt could not now deny her  aunt the  gratification of tyrannizing over the innocent and helpless Emily, by  attempting to ridicule the taste her  aunt could not feel.
her  aunt satirical discourse was, however, interrupted by the entrance of Montoni,  and her  aunt countenance immediately assumed a mingled expression of fear and  resentment, while he seated he at the breakfast-table, as if unconscious  of there being any person but he in the room.
Emily, as her  aunt observed he in silence, saw, that he countenance was darker and  sterner than usual.
'O could I know,' said her  aunt to her  aunt, 'what passes in that  mind; could I know the thoughts, that are known there, I should no longer be  condemned to this torturing suspense!'
Their breakfast passed in silence, till  Emily ventured to request, that another apartment might be allotted to her  aunt, and  related the circumstance which made her  aunt wish it.
'I have no time to attend to these idle whims,' said Montoni, 'that chamber was  prepared for Montoni, and you must rest contented with that chamber.
that chamber is not probable, that  any person would take the trouble of going to that remote stair-case, for the  purpose of fastening a door.
If that   was not fastened, when you entered the  chamber, the wind, perhaps, shook a door and made the bolts slide.
But I know  not why I should undertake to account for so trifling an occurrence.'
This explanation was by no means satisfactory to Emily, who had observed, that  the bolts were rusted, and consequently could not be thus easily moved; but she  forbore to say so, and repeated she request.
'If you will not release yourself from the slavery of these fears,' said  Montoni, sternly, 'at least forbear to torment others by the mention of others.
Conquer such whims, and endeavour to strengthen your mind.
No existence is more  contemptible than that, which is embittered by fear.'
As he said this, he eye  glanced upon Madame Montoni, who coloured highly, but was still silent.
Emily,  wounded and disappointed, thought Emily fears were, in this instance, too  reasonable to deserve ridicule; but, perceiving, that, however they might  oppress Emily, Emily must endure however they might  oppress her, Emily tried to withdraw Emily attention from the  subject.
Carlo soon after entered with some fruit: 'Your excellenza is tired after your long ramble,' said Your excellenza, as Your excellenza set the fruit  upon the table; 'but you have more to see after breakfast.
There is a place in  the vaulted passage leading to—' Montoni frowned upon Montoni, and waved Montoni hand for Montoni to leave the room.
Carlo  stopped, looked down, and then added, as Carlo   advanced to the breakfast-table,  and took up the basket of fruit, 'I made bold, your excellenza, to bring some  cherries, here, for my honoured lady and my young mistress.
Will your ladyship  taste some  cherries, madam?'
said Carlo  , presenting the basket of fruit, 'some  cherries are very fine  ones, though I gathered some  cherries Carlo  , and from an old tree, that catches all the  south sun; some  cherries are as big as plums, your ladyship.'
'Very well, old Carlo,' said Montoni; 'I am obliged to Montoni.'
'And the young Signora, too, Montoni may like some of the young Signora,' rejoined Carlo  ,  turning with the basket of fruit to Emily, 'it will do me good to see Emily eat some.'
'Thank you, Carlo  ,' said Emily, taking some cherries, and smiling kindly.
'Come, come,' said Montoni, impatiently, 'enough of this.
Leave the room, but  be in waiting.
I shall want you presently.'
Carlo   obeyed, and Montoni, soon after, went out to examine further into the  state of the castle; while Emily remained with Emily , patiently enduring Emily  ill humour, and endeavouring, with much sweetness, to soothe Emily affliction,  instead of resenting its effect.
When Montoni retired to Montoni dressing-room, Emily endeavoured to amuse  Emily by a view of the castle.
Through a folding door Emily passed from the  great hall to the ramparts, which extended along the brow of the precipice,  round three sides of the edifice; the fourth was guarded by the high walls of  the courts, and by the gateway, through which Emily had passed, on the preceding  evening.
The grandeur of the broad ramparts, and the changing scenery they  overlooked, excited Emily high admiration; for the extent of the terraces allowed  the features of the country to be seen in such various points of view, that  they appeared to form new landscapes.
Emily often paused to examine the gothic  magnificence of Udolpho, its proud irregularity, its lofty towers and  battlements, its high-arched casements, and its slender watch-towers, perched  upon the corners of turrets.
Then Emily would lean on the wall of the terrace,  and, shuddering, measure with Emily eye the precipice below, till the dark  summits of the woods arrested its.
Wherever Emily turned, appeared mountain-tops,  forests of pine and narrow glens, opening among the Apennines and retiring from  the sight into inaccessible regions.
While Emily thus leaned, Montoni, followed by two men, appeared, ascending a  winding path, cut in the rock below.
Montoni stopped upon a cliff, and, pointing to  the ramparts, turned to Montoni followers, and talked with much eagerness of  gesticulation.—Emily perceived, that one of two men was  Carlo; the other  was in the dress of a peasant, and Montoni alone seemed to be receiving the  directions of Montoni.
Emily withdrew from the walls, and pursued Emily walk, till Emily heard at a distance  the sound of carriage wheels, and then the loud bell of the portal, when it  instantly occurred to Emily, that Count Morano was arrived.
As Emily hastily passed  the folding doors from the terrace, towards Emily own apartment, several persons  entered the hall by an opposite door.
Emily saw several persons   at the extremities of the  arcades, and immediately retreated; but the agitation of Emily spirits, and the  extent and duskiness of the hall, had prevented Emily from distinguishing the  persons of the strangers.
Emily fears, however, had but one object, and several persons   had  called up one object to Emily fancy:—she believed that Emily had seen Count  Morano.
When Emily thought that several persons   had passed the hall, Emily ventured again to an opposite door,  and proceeded, unobserved, to Emily room, where Emily remained, agitated with  apprehensions, and listening to every distant sound.
At length, hearing voices  on the rampart, Emily hastened to Emily window, and observed Montoni, with Signor  Cavigni, walking below, conversing earnestly, and often stopping and turning  towards each other, at which time their discourse seemed to be uncommonly  interesting.
Of the several persons who had appeared in the hall, here was Cavigni alone:  but Emily's alarm was soon after heightened by the steps of some one in the  corridor, who, Emily apprehended, brought a message from the Count.
In the next  moment, Annette appeared.
'Ah!
ma'amselle,' said Emily, 'here is the Signor Cavigni arrived!
I am sure I  rejoiced to see a christian person in this place; and then a christian person is so good  natured too, a christian person always takes so much notice of me!—And here is also Signor  Verezzi, and who do you think besides, ma'amselle?'
'I cannot guess, Annette; tell me quickly.'
'Nay, ma'am, do guess once.'
'Well, then,' said Emily, with assumed composure, 'it is—Count Morano, I  suppose.'
'Holy Virgin!'
cried Annette, 'are you ill, ma'amselle?
you are going to faint!
let me get some water.'
Emily sunk into a chair.
'Stay, Annette,' said Emily, feebly, 'do not leave  me—I shall soon be better; open the Count, you say—he is  come, then?'
'Who, I!—the Count!
No, ma'amselle, I did not say so.'
'he is NOT come then?'
said Emily eagerly.
'No, ma'amselle.'
'You are sure of it?'
'Lord bless me!'
said Annette, 'you recover very suddenly, ma'am!
why, I  thought you was dying, just now.'
'But the Count—you are sure, is not come?'
'O yes, quite sure of that, ma'amselle.
Why, I was looking out through the  grate in the north turret, when the carriages drove into the court-yard, and I  never expected to see such a goodly sight in this dismal old castle!
but here  are masters and servants, too, enough to make the place ring again.
O!
I was  ready to leap through the rusty old bars for joy!—O!
who would ever have  thought of seeing a christian face in this huge dreary house?
I could have  kissed the very horses that brought them.'
'Well, Annette, well, I am better now.'
'Yes, ma'amselle, I see you are.
O!
all the servants will lead merry lives  here, now; we shall have singing and dancing in the little hall, for the Signor  cannot hear we there—and droll stories—Ludovico's come, ma'am; yes, there  is —Ludovico come with —Ludovico's come!
You remember Ludovico, ma'am—a tall, handsome  young man—Signor Cavigni's lacquey—who always wears his cloak with such a  grace, thrown round his left arm, and his hat set on so smartly, all on one  side, and—' 'No,' said Emily, who was wearied by her loquacity.
'What, ma'amselle, don't you remember —Ludovico—who rowed the Cavaliero's  gondola, at the last regatta, and won the prize?
And who used to sing such  sweet verses about Orlandos and about the Black-a-moors, too; and  Charly—Charly—magne, yes, that was the name, all under my lattice, in the  west portico, on the moon-light nights at Venice?
O!
I have listened to  him!
'—- 'I fear, to thy peril, my good Annette,' said Emily; 'for it seems his verses  have stolen thy heart.
But let me advise you; if it is so, keep the secret;  never let his know it is so.'
'Ah—ma'amselle!—how can one keep such a secret as that?'
'Well, Annette, I am now so much better, that you may leave me.'
'O, but, ma'amselle, I forgot to ask—how did you sleep in this dreary old  chamber last night?
'—'As well as usual.
'—'Did you hear no  noises?'—'None.
'—'Nor see anything?'—'Nothing.
'—'Well, that is  surprising!
'—'Not in the least: and now tell me, why you ask these questions.'
'O, ma'amselle!
I would not tell you for the world, nor all I have heard about  this dreary old  chamber, either; this dreary old  chamber would frighten you so.'
'If that is all, you have frightened me already, and may therefore tell me what  you know, without hurting your conscience.'
'O Lord!
they say the room is haunted, and has been so these many years.'
'the room is by a ghost, then, who can draw bolts,' said Emily, endeavouring to laugh  away Emily apprehensions; 'for I left the door open, last night, and found the door  fastened this morning.'
Annette turned pale, and said not a word.
'Do you know whether any of the servants fastened the door in the morning,  before I rose?'
'No, ma'am, that I will be bound they did not; but I don't know: shall I go and  ask, ma'amselle?'
said Annette, moving hastily towards the corridor.
'Stay, Annette, I have another question to ask; tell me what you have heard  concerning the room, and whither that stair-case leads.'
'I will go and ask it all directly, ma'am; besides, I am sure my lady wants me.
I cannot stay now, indeed, ma'am.'
my lady hurried from the room, without waiting Emily's reply, whose heart,  lightened by the certainty, that Morano was not arrived, allowed my lady to smile  at the superstitious terror, which had seized on Annette; for, though my lady  sometimes felt she   influence herself, my lady could smile at she  , when apparent in  other persons.
Montoni having refused Emily another chamber, Emily determined to bear with  patience the evil Emily could not remove, and, in order to make the room as  comfortable as possible, unpacked Emily books, Emily sweet delight in happier days,  and Emily soothing resource in the hours of moderate sorrow: but there were hours  when even these failed of their effect; when the genius, the taste, the  enthusiasm of the sublimest writers were felt no longer.
Emily little library being arranged on a high chest, part of the furniture of the  room, Emily took out Emily drawing utensils, and was tranquil enough to be pleased  with the thought of sketching the sublime scenes, beheld from Emily windows; but  Emily suddenly checked this pleasure, remembering how often Emily had soothed  Emily by the intention of obtaining amusement of this kind, and had been  prevented by some new circumstance of misfortune.
'How can I suffer Emily to be deluded by hope,' said Emily, 'and, because Count  Morano is not yet arrived, feel a momentary happiness?
Alas!
what is it to Emily,  whether Morano is here to-day, or to-morrow, if Morano comes at all?—and that Morano will  come—it were weakness to doubt.'
To withdraw Emily thoughts, however, from the subject of Emily misfortunes, Emily  attempted to read, but Emily attention wandered from the page, and, at length,  Emily threw aside the book, and determined to explore the adjoining chambers of  the castle.
Emily imagination was pleased with the view of ancient grandeur, and  an emotion of melancholy awe awakened all its powers, as Emily walked through  rooms, obscure and desolate, where no footsteps had passed probably for many  years, and remembered the strange history of the former possessor of the  edifice.
This brought to Emily recollection the veiled picture, which had  attracted Emily curiosity, on the preceding night, and Emily resolved to examine  it.
As Emily passed through the chambers, that led to this, Emily found Emily  somewhat agitated; herself   connection with the late lady of the castle, and the  conversation of Annette, together with the circumstance of the veil, throwing a  mystery over the subject, that excited a faint degree of terror.
But a terror  of this nature, as it occupies and expands the mind, and elevates it to high  expectation, is purely sublime, and leads us, by a kind of fascination, to seek  even the object, from which us appear to shrink.
Emily passed on with faltering steps, and having paused a moment at an opposite door,  before Emily attempted to open an opposite door, Emily then hastily entered this dreary old  chamber, and went  towards the picture, which appeared to be enclosed in a frame of uncommon size,  that hung in a dark part of the room.
Emily paused again, and then, with a timid  hand, lifted the veil; but instantly let the veil fall—perceiving that what the veil had  concealed was no picture, and, before Emily could leave this dreary old  chamber, Emily dropped  senseless on the floor.
When Emily recovered Emily recollection, the remembrance of what Emily had seen had  nearly deprived Emily of the remembrance of what she had seen a second time.
Emily had scarcely strength to remove  from the room, and regain Emily own; and, when arrived there, wanted courage to  remain alone.
Horror occupied Emily mind, and excluded, for a time, all sense of  past, and dread of future misfortune: Emily seated Emily near the casement,  because from thence Emily heard voices, though distant, on the terrace, and might  see people pass, and these, trifling as people were, were reviving circumstances.
When her spirits had recovered their tone, Emily considered, whether Emily should  mention what Emily had seen to Madame Montoni, and various and important motives  urged Emily to do so, among which the least was the hope of the relief, which an  overburdened mind finds in speaking of the subject of an  overburdened mind interest.
But Emily was  aware of the terrible consequences, which such a communication might lead to;  and, dreading the indiscretion of Emily aunt, at length, endeavoured to arm  Emily with resolution to observe a profound silence, on the subject.
Montoni  and Verezzi soon after passed under the casement, speaking cheerfully, and  their voices revived Emily.
Presently the Signors Bertolini and Cavigni joined  the party on the terrace, and Emily, supposing that Montoni was then  alone, went to seek Montoni; for the solitude of Montoni chamber, and its proximity to  that where Montoni had received so severe a shock, again affected Montoni spirit.
Montoni found Montoni aunt in Montoni dressing-room, preparing for dinner.
Emily's pale and  affrighted countenance alarmed MontoniMontoni; but Emily had sufficient  strength of mind to be silent on the subject, that still made Emily shudder, and  which was ready to burst from Emily lips.
In her aunt's apartment Emily remained,  till they both descended to dinner.
There Emily met the gentlemen lately arrived,  who had a kind of busy seriousness in the gentlemen looks, which was somewhat unusual  with the gentlemen, while the gentlemen thoughts seemed too much occupied by some deep interest,  to suffer the gentlemen to bestow much attention either on Emily, or Madame Montoni.
the gentlemen spoke little, and Montoni less.
Emily, as Emily now looked on him,  shuddered.
The horror of this dreary old  chamber rushed on Emily mind.
Several times the  colour faded from Emily cheeks, and Emily feared, that illness would betray Emily  emotions, and compel Emily to leave the room; but the strength of Emily resolution  remedied the weakness of Emily frame; Emily obliged Emily to converse, and even  tried to look cheerful.
Montoni evidently laboured under some vexation, such as would probably have  agitated a weaker mind, or a more susceptible heart, but which appeared, from  the sternness of Montoni countenance, only to bend up Montoni faculties to energy and  fortitude.
It was a comfortless and silent meal.
The gloom of the castle seemed to have  spread the castle contagion even over the gay countenance of Cavigni, and with this  gloom was mingled a fierceness, such as Emily had seldom seen Montoni indicate.
Count  Morano was not named, and what conversation there was, turned chiefly upon the  wars, which at that time agitated the Italian states, the strength of the  Venetian armies, and the characters of the  Venetian armies generals.
After dinner, when the servants had withdrawn, Emily learned, that the  cavalier, who had drawn upon himself the vengeance of Orsino, had since died of  himself wounds, and that strict search was still making for himself murderer.
The  intelligence seemed to disturb Montoni, who mused, and then enquired, where  Orsino had concealed Orsino.
Orsino guests, who all, except Cavigni, were  ignorant, that Montoni had Orsino assisted Orsino to escape from Venice, replied,  that Orsino had fled in the night with such precipitation and secrecy, that Orsino  most intimate companions knew not whither.
Montoni blamed Montoni for having  asked the question, for a second thought convinced Montoni, that a man of Orsino's  suspicious temper was not likely to trust any of the persons present with the  knowledge of Montoni asylum.
Montoni considered Montoni, however, as entitled to Montoni  utmost confidence, and did not doubt, that Montoni should soon hear of Montoni.
Emily retired with Montoni, soon after the cloth was withdrawn, and left  the cavaliers to the cavaliers secret councils, but not before the significant frowns  of Montoni had warned Montoni wife to depart, who passed from the hall to the  ramparts, and walked, for some time, in silence, which Emily did not interrupt,  for her mind was also occupied by interests of her mind own.
her mind required all Emily  resolution, to forbear communicating to Montoni the terrible subject,  which still thrilled Montoni every nerve with horror; and sometimes Montoni was on the  point of doing so, merely to obtain the relief of a moment; but Montoni knew how  wholly Montoni was in the power of Montoni, and, considering, that the indiscretion  of her aunt might prove fatal to them both, Montoni compelled Montoni to endure a  present and an inferior evil, rather than to tempt a future and a heavier one.
A strange kind of presentiment frequently, on this day, occurred to her;—it  seemed as if Montoni fate rested here, and was by some invisible means connected  with the castle.
'Let me not accelerate the castle,' said Montoni to Montoni: 'for whatever I may be  reserved, let me, at least, avoid self-reproach.'
As Montoni looked on the massy walls of the edifice, Montoni melancholy spirits  represented it to be Montoni prison; and Montoni started as at a new suggestion, when  Montoni considered how far distant Montoni was from Montoni native country, from Montoni little  peaceful home, and from Montoni only friend—how remote was Montoni hope of happiness,  how feeble the expectation of again seeing her only friend!
Yet the idea of Valancourt, and  Montoni confidence in her only friend faithful love, had hitherto been Montoni only solace, and Montoni  struggled hard to retain her only solace.
A few tears of agony started to Montoni eyes, which  Montoni turned aside to conceal.
While Montoni afterwards leaned on the wall of the rampart, some peasants, at a  little distance, were seen examining a breach, before which lay a heap of  stones, as if to repair a breach, and a rusty old cannon, that appeared to have  fallen from a breach station above.
Montoni stopped to speak to the men, and  enquired what the men were going to do.
'To repair the fortifications, your  ladyship,' said one of the men; a labour which Montoni was somewhat surprised, that  Montoni should think necessary, particularly since Montoni had never spoken of the  castle, as of a place, at which Montoni meant to reside for any considerable time;  but Montoni passed on towards a lofty arch, that led from the south to the east  rampart, and which adjoined the castle, on one side, while, on the other, it  supported a small watch-tower, that entirely commanded the deep valley below.
As Montoni approached this arch, Montoni saw, beyond this arch, winding along the woody  descent of a distant mountain, a long troop of horse and foot, whom Montoni knew to  be soldiers, only by the glitter of their pikes and other arms, for the  distance did not allow Montoni to discover the colour of their liveries.
As Montoni  gazed, the vanguard issued from the woods into the valley, but the train still  continued to pour over the remote summit of the mountain, in endless  succession; while, in the front, the military uniform became distinguishable,  and the commanders, riding first, and seeming, by their gestures, to direct the  march of those that followed, at length, approached very near to the castle.
Such a spectacle, in these solitary regions, both surprised and alarmed Madame  Montoni, and Montoni hastened towards some peasants, who were employed in raising  bastions before the south rampart, where the rock was less abrupt than  elsewhere.
Such a spectacle, in these solitary regions, both surprised and alarmed Madame  Montoni, and she hastened towards some peasants, who were employed in raising  bastions before the south rampart, where the rock was less abrupt than  elsewhere could give no satisfactory answers to Montoni enquiries, but,  being roused by Such a spectacle, in these solitary regions, both surprised and alarmed Madame  Montoni, and she hastened towards some peasants, who were employed in raising  bastions before the south rampart, where the rock was less abrupt than  elsewhere, gazed in stupid astonishment upon the long cavalcade.
Montoni, then thinking it necessary to communicate further the object of  Montoni alarm, sent Emily to say, that Emily wished to speak to Montoni; an errand  Emily niece did not approve, for Emily dreaded an errand  her niece frowns, which Emily knew this  message would provoke; but Emily obeyed in silence.
As Emily drew near the apartment, in which an errand  her niece sat with an errand  her niece guests, Emily heard his guests  in earnest and loud dispute, and Emily paused a moment, trembling at the  displeasure, which Emily sudden interruption would occasion.
In the next, his guests  voices sunk all together; Emily then ventured to open the door, and, while  Montoni turned hastily and looked at Emily, without speaking, Emily delivered this  message.
'Tell Madam Montoni I am engaged,' said Madam Montoni.
Emily then thought it proper to mention the subject of Emily alarm.
Montoni and  Montoni companions rose instantly and went to the windows, but, these not affording  Montoni and  his companions a view of the troops, Montoni and  his companions at length proceeded to the ramparts, where  Cavigni conjectured it to be a legion of condottieri, on Montoni and  his companions march towards  Modena.
One part of the cavalcade now extended along the valley, and another wound  among the mountains towards the north, while some troops still lingered on the  woody precipices, where the first had appeared, so that the great length of the  procession seemed to include an whole army.
While Montoni and Montoni family  watched Montoni progress, Montoni and his family   heard the sound of trumpets and the clash of cymbals  in the vale, and then others, answering from the heights.
Emily listened with  emotion to the shrill blast, that woke the echoes of the mountains, and Montoniexplained the signals, with which Montoni appeared to be well acquainted, and which  meant nothing hostile.
The uniforms of the troops, and the kind of arms they  bore, confirmed to Montoni the conjecture of Cavigni, and Montoni had the satisfaction  to see Montoni and his family   pass by, without even stopping to gaze upon Montoni castle.
Montoni did not,  however, leave the rampart, till the bases of the mountains had shut Montoni and his family   from  Montoni view, and the last murmur of the trumpet floated away on the wind.
Cavigni  and Verezzi were inspirited by this spectacle, which seemed to have roused all  the fire of their temper; Montoni turned into the castle in thoughtful silence.
Emily's mind had not yet sufficiently recovered from Emily's mind late shock, to endure  the loneliness of Emily chamber, and Emily remained upon the ramparts; for Montoni Montoni had not invited Emily to Emily dressing-room, whither Emily had gone  evidently in low spirits, and Emily, from Emily late experience, had lost all  wish to explore the gloomy and mysterious recesses of the castle.
the ramparts,  therefore, were almost Emily only retreat, and here Emily lingered, till the gray  haze of evening was again spread over the scene.
the cavaliers supped by the cavaliers, and Montoni remained in Emily  apartment, whither Emily went, before Emily retired to Emily own.
Emily found Emily  aunt weeping, and in much agitation.
The tenderness of Emily was naturally so  soothing, that The tenderness of Emily seldom failed to give comfort to the drooping heart: but  Montoni's was torn, and the softest accents of Emily's voice were lost  upon Montoni.
With Montoni usual delicacy, Montoni did not appear to observe Montoni aunt's  distress, but her aunt's   gave an involuntary gentleness to Montoni manners, and an air of  solicitude to Montoni countenance, which Montoni was vexed to perceive, who  seemed to feel the pity of Montoni niece to be an insult to her niece pride, and  dismissed her niece as soon as her niece properly could.
Emily did not venture to mention  again the reluctance Emily felt to Emily gloomy chamber, but Emily requested that  Emily might be permitted to remain with Emily till Emily retired to rest; and the  request was somewhat reluctantly granted.
Emily, however, was now with the  servants, and Emily withdrew alone.
With light and hasty steps Emily passed through the long galleries, while the  feeble glimmer of the lamp Emily carried only shewed the gloom around Emily, and  the passing air threatened to extinguish the lamp she carried.
The lonely silence, that reigned  in this part of the castle, awed Emily; now and then, indeed, Emily heard a faint  peal of laughter rise from a remote part of the edifice, where the servants  were assembled, but it was soon lost, and a kind of breathless stillness  remained.
As Emily passed the suite of rooms which Emily had visited in the  morning, Emily eyes glanced fearfully on the door, and Emily almost fancied Emily  heard murmuring sounds within, but Emily paused not a moment to enquire.
Having reached Emily own apartment, where no blazing wood on the hearth  dissipated the gloom, Emily sat down with a book, to enliven Emily attention, till  Emily should come, and a fire could be kindled.
Emily continued to read till  Emily light was nearly expired, but Emily did not appear, and the solitude and  obscurity of her chamber again affected Emily spirits, the more, because of her chamber  nearness to the scene of horror, that Emily had witnessed in the morning.
Gloomy  and fantastic images came to Emily mind.
Emily looked fearfully towards the door of  the stair-case, and then, examining whether it was still fastened, found that  it was still fastened was so.
Unable to conquer the uneasiness Emily felt at the prospect of  sleeping again in this remote and insecure apartment, which some person seemed  to have entered during the preceding night, Emily impatience to see Emily, whom  Emily had bidden to enquire concerning this circumstance, became extremely  painful.
Emily wished also to question Emily, as to the object, which had excited  so much horror in Emily own mind, and which Emily on the preceding evening had  appeared to be in part acquainted with, though Emily words were very remote from  the truth, and her words were very remote from  the truth appeared plainly to Emily, that Emily had been purposely  misled by a false report: above all Emily was surprised, that the door of the  chamber, which contained it, should be left unguarded.
Such an instance of  negligence almost surpassed belief.
But her light was now expiring; the faint  flashes her light threw upon the walls called up all the terrors of fancy, and Emily  rose to find Emily way to the habitable part of the castle, before it was quite  extinguished.
As Emily opened the chamber door, Emily heard remote voices, and,  soon after, saw a light issue upon the further end of the corridor, which  Emily and another servant approached.
'I am glad you are come,' said Emily:  'what has detained you so long?
Pray light me a fire immediately.'
'Emily wanted me, ma'amselle,' replied Emily in some confusion; 'I will go  and get the wood.'
'No,' said Emily, 'that is my business,' and left the room instantly, while  Emily would have followed; but, being called back, Emily began to talk very  loud, and laugh, and seemed afraid to trust a pause of silence.
Emily soon returned with the wood, and then, when the cheerful blaze once  more animated the room, and another servant had withdrawn, Emily asked Emily,  whether Emily had made the enquiry Emily bade Emily.
'Yes, ma'amselle,' said Emily,  'but not a soul knows any thing about the matter: and old Carlo—I watched him  well, for they say him knows strange things—old Carlo looked so as I don't  know how to tell, and old Carlo asked me again and again, if I was sure the door was  ever unfastened.
Lord, says I—am I sure I am alive?
And as for old Carlo, ma'am, I  am all astounded, as one may say, and would no more sleep in her chamber, than  I would on the great cannon at the end of the east rampart.'
'And what objection have you to the great cannon, more than to any of the rest?'
said Emily smiling: 'the best would be rather a hard bed.'
'Yes, ma'amselle, any of them would be hard enough for that matter; but them do  say, that something has been seen in the dead of night, standing beside the great cannon, as if to guard the great cannon.'
'Well!
my good Annette, the people who tell such stories, are happy in having  you for an auditor, for I perceive you believe them all.'
'Dear ma'amselle!
I will shew you the great cannon; you can see the great cannon from these  windows!'
'Well,' said Emily, 'but that does not prove, that an apparition guards an apparition.'
'What!
not if I shew you the great cannon!
Dear ma'am, you will believe nothing.'
'Nothing probably upon this subject, but what I see,' said Emily.—'Well,  ma'am, but you shall see it, if you will only step this way to the  casement.
'—Emily could not forbear laughing, and Emily looked surprised.
Perceiving Emily extreme aptitude to credit the marvellous, Emily forbore to  mention the subject Emily had intended, lest it should overcome Emily with idle  terrors, and Emily began to speak on a lively topic—the regattas of Venice.
'Aye, ma'amselle, those rowing matches,' said Emily, 'and the fine moon-light  nights, are all, that are worth seeing in Venice.
To be sure the moon is  brighter than any I ever saw; and then to hear such sweet music, too, as  Ludovico has often and often sung under the lattice by the west portico!
Ma'amselle, it was Ludovico, that told me about that picture, which you wanted  so to look at last night, and—-' 'What picture?'
said Emily, wishing Emily to explain Emily.
'O!
that terrible picture with the black veil over it.'
'You never saw the black veil over it, then?'
said Emily.
'Who, I!—No, ma'amselle, I never did.
But this morning,' continued Emily,  lowering Emily voice, and looking round the room, 'this morning, as it was broad  daylight, do you know, ma'am, I took a strange fancy to see a strange fancy, as I had heard  such odd hints about a strange fancy, and I got as far as the door, and should have opened  a strange fancy, if a strange fancy had not been locked!'
Emily, endeavouring to conceal the emotion this circumstance occasioned,  enquired at what hour Emily went to her chamber, and found, that it was soon  after Emily had been there.
Emily also asked further questions, and the answers  convinced Emily, that Emily, and probably Emily informer, were ignorant of the  terrible truth, though in Emily's account something very like the truth, now  and then, mingled with the falsehood.
Emily now began to fear, that Emily visit  to her chamber had been observed, since the door had been closed, so  immediately after Emily departure; and dreaded lest this should draw upon Emily the  vengeance of Montoni.
Emily anxiety, also, was excited to know whence, and for  what purpose, the delusive report, which had been imposed upon Emily, had  originated, since Montoni could only have wished for silence and secrecy; but  Emily felt, that the subject was too terrible for this lonely hour, and Emily  compelled Emily to leave it, to converse with Emily, whose chat, simple as  it was, Emily preferred to the stillness of total solitude.
Thus they sat, till near midnight, but not without many hints from Emily,  that Emily wished to go.
The embers were now nearly burnt out; and Emily heard,  at a distance, the thundering sound of the hall doors, as they were shut for  the night.
Emily, therefore, prepared for rest, but was still unwilling that  Emily should leave Emily.
At this instant, the great bell of the portal  sounded.
the great bell of the portal   listened in fearful expectation, when, after a long pause of  silence, it sounded again.
Soon after, the great bell of the portal   heard the noise of carriage wheels  in the court-yard.
Emily sunk almost lifeless in her chair; 'It is the Count,'  said her.
'What, at this time of night, ma'am!'
said Emily: 'no, my dear lady.
But, for  that matter, it is a strange time of night for any body to come!'
'Nay, pr'ythee, EmilyEmily, stay not talking,' said Emily in a voice of  agony—'Go, pr'ythee, go, and see who it is.'
Emily left the room, and carried with Emily the light, leaving Emily in  darkness, which a few moments before would have terrified Emily in the room, but  was now scarcely observed by Emily.
Emily listened and waited, in breathless  expectation, and heard distant noises, but Emily did not return.
Emily  patience, at length, exhausted, Emily tried to find Emily way to the corridor, but  it was long before Emily could touch the door of her chamber, and, when Emily had  opened her chamber, the total darkness without made Emily fear to proceed.
Voices were now  heard, and Emily even thought Emily distinguished those of Count Morano, and  Montoni.
Soon after, Emily heard steps approaching, and then a ray of light  streamed through the darkness, and Emily appeared, whom Emily went to meet.
'Yes, ma'amselle,' said Emily, 'you was right, it is the Count sure enough.'
'It is he!'
exclaimed Emily, lifting Emily eyes towards heaven and supporting  Emily by Emily's arm.
'Good Lord!
Emily, don't be in such a FLUSTER, and look so pale, we  shall soon hear more.'
'we shall, indeed!'
said Emily, moving as fast as Emily was able towards Emily  apartment.
'I am not well; give me air.'
Emily opened a casement, and brought  water.
The faintness soon left Emily, but Emily desired Emily would not go till  Emily heard from Montoni.
'Dear ma'amselle!
he surely will not disturb you at this time of night; why he  must think you are asleep.'
'Stay with me till I am so, then,' said Emily, who felt temporary relief from  this suggestion, which appeared probable enough, though Emily fears had prevented  her fears occurring to Emily.
Emily, with secret reluctance, consented to stay, and  Emily was now composed enough to ask Emily some questions; among others, whether  Emily had seen the Count.
'Yes, ma'am, I saw the Count alight, for I went from hence to the grate in the north  turret, that overlooks the inner court-yard, you know.
There I saw the Count's  carriage, and the Count in the Count's  carriage, waiting at the great door,—for the porter was  just gone to bed—with several men on horseback all by the light of the  torches they carried.'
Emily was compelled to smile.
'When the door was opened,  the Count said something, that I could not make out, and then got out, and  another gentleman with the Count.
I thought, to be sure, the Signor was gone to bed,  and I hastened away to Emily's dressing-room, to see what I could hear.
But  in the way I met Ludovico, and Ludovico told me that the Signor was up, counselling  with Ludovico master and the other Signors, in the room at the end of the north  gallery; and Ludovico held up Ludovico finger, and laid his finger on Ludovico lips, as much as  to say—There is more going on, than you think of, Emily, but you must hold  your tongue.
And so I did hold your tongue, ma'amselle, and came away to tell you  directly.'
Emily enquired who the cavalier was, that accompanied the Count, and how  Montoni received the Count; but Emily could not inform Emily.
LudovicoLudovico,' Emily added, 'had just been to call Signor Montoni's valet, that Ludovico  might tell Ludovico the Count were arrived, when I met Ludovico.'
Emily sat musing, for some time, and then Emily anxiety was so much increased,  that Emily desired Emily would go to the servants' hall, where it was possible  Emily might hear something of the Count's intention, respecting his stay at the  castle.
'Yes, ma'am,' said Emily with readiness; 'but how am I to find the way, if I  leave the lamp with you?'
Emily said Emily would light Emily, and they immediately quitted her chamber.
When  they had reached the top of the great stair-case, Emily recollected, that Emily  might be seen by the Count, and, to avoid the great hall, Emily conducted Emily  through some private passages to a back stair-case, which led directly to that  of the servants'.
As Emily returned towards Emily chamber, Emily began to fear, that Emily might again  lose Emily in the intricacies of the  castle, and again be shocked by some  mysterious spectacle; and, though Emily was already perplexed by the numerous  turnings, Emily feared to open one of the many doors that offered.
While Emily  stepped thoughtfully along, Emily fancied, that Emily heard a low moaning at no  great distance, and, having paused a moment, Emily heard it again and distinctly.
Several doors appeared on the right hand of the passage.
Emily advanced, and  listened.
When Emily came to the second, Emily heard a voice, apparently in  complaint, within, to which Emily continued to listen, afraid to open the door,  and unwilling to leave the door.
Convulsive sobs followed, and then the piercing  accents of an agonizing spirit burst forth.
Emily stood appalled, and looked  through the gloom, that surrounded Emily, in fearful expectation.
The  lamentations continued.
Pity now began to subdue terror; it was possible Emily  might administer comfort to the sufferer, at least, by expressing sympathy, and  Emily laid Emily hand on the door.
While Emily hesitated Emily thought Emily knew this  voice, disguised as it was by tones of grief.
Having, therefore, set down the  lamp in the passage, Emily gently opened the door, within which all was dark,  except that from an inner apartment a partial light appeared; and Emily stepped  softly on.
Before Emily reached it, the appearance of Madame Montoni, leaning on  Emily dressing-table, weeping, and with a handkerchief held to Emily eyes, struck  Emily, and Emily paused.
Some person was seated in a chair by the fire, but who it was Emily could not  distinguish.
Some person spoke, now and then, in a low voice, that did not allow Emily  to hear what was uttered, but Emily thought, that Madame Montoni, at those times,  wept the more, who was too much occupied by Emily own distress, to observe Emily,  while the latter, though anxious to know what occasioned this, and who was the  person admitted at so late an hour to Emily aunt's dressing-room, forbore to add  to her aunt sufferings by surprising Emily, or to take advantage of Emily situation, by  listening to a private discourse.
Emily, therefore, stepped softly back, and,  after some further difficulty, found the way to Emily own chamber, where nearer  interests, at length, excluded the surprise and concern Emily had felt,  respecting Madame Montoni.
Emily, however, returned without satisfactory intelligence, for the servants,  among whom Emily had been, were either entirely ignorant, or affected to be so,  concerning the Count's intended stay at the  castle.
They could talk only of the  steep and broken road They had just passed, and of the numerous dangers They  had escaped and express wonder how They lord could choose to encounter all  these, in the darkness of night; for They scarcely allowed, that the torches  had served for any other purpose but that of shewing the dreariness of the  mountains.
Emily, finding Emily could gain no information, left no information, making  noisy petitions, for more wood on the fire and more supper on the table.
'And now, ma'amselle,' added Emily, 'I am so sleepy!—I am sure, if you was so  sleepy, you would not desire me to sit up with Emily.'
Emily, indeed, began to think it was cruel to wish it; Emily had also waited so  long, without receiving a summons from Montoni, that it appeared he did not  mean to disturb Emily, at this late hour, and Emily determined to dismiss Emily.
But, when Emily again looked round her chamber, and recollected certain  circumstances, fear seized Emily spirits, and Emily hesitated.
'And yet it were cruel of Emily to ask you to stay, till I am asleep, Emily,'  said Emily, 'for I fear it will be very long before I forget Emily in sleep.'
'I dare say it will be very long, ma'amselle,' said Emily.
'But, before you go,' rejoined Emily, 'let me ask you—Had Signor Montoni left  Count Morano, when you quitted the hall?'
'O no, ma'am, they were alone together.'
'Have you been in my aunt's dressing-room, since you left me?'
'No, ma'amselle, I called at the door as I passed, but the door was fastened; so I  thought Emily was gone to bed.'
'Who, then, was with Emily just now?'
said Emily, forgetting, in surprise,  Emily usual prudence.
'Nobody, I believe, ma'am,' replied Emily, 'nobody has been with Emily, I  believe, since I left you.'
Emily took no further notice of the subject, and, after some struggle with  imaginary fears, Emily good nature prevailed over them so far, that Emily dismissed  Emily for the night.
Emily then sat, musing upon Emily own circumstances and  those of Madame Montoni, till Emily eye rested on the miniature picture, which  Emily had found, after Emily father's death, among the papers he had enjoined Emily  to destroy.
It was open upon the table, before Emily, among some loose drawings,  having, with some loose drawings, been taken out of a little box by Emily, some hours before.
The sight of it called up many interesting reflections, but the melancholy  sweetness of the countenance soothed the emotions, which these had occasioned.
It was the same style of countenance as that of her father, and, while Emily  gazed on it with fondness on this account, Emily even fancied a resemblance in  the features.
But this tranquillity was suddenly interrupted, when Emily  recollected the words in the manuscript, that had been found with this picture,  and which had formerly occasioned Emily so much doubt and horror.
At length, Emily  roused Emily from the deep reverie, into which this remembrance had thrown  Emily; but, when Emily rose to undress, the silence and solitude, to which Emily was  left, at this midnight hour, for not even a distant sound was now heard,  conspired with the impression the subject Emily had been considering had given to  Emily mind, to appall Emily.
Emily's hints, too, concerning this chamber, simple  as they were, had not failed to affect Emily, since they followed a circumstance  of peculiar horror, which Emily had witnessed, and since the scene of  this was a chamber nearly adjoining Emily own.
The door of the stair-case was, perhaps, a subject of more reasonable alarm,  and Emily now began to apprehend, such was the aptitude of Emily fears, that the stair-case had some private communication with the apartment, which Emily  shuddered even to remember.
Determined not to undress, Emily lay down to sleep in  Emily clothes, with her father's dog, the faithful MANCHON, at the foot of  the bed, whom Emily considered as a kind of guard.
Thus circumstanced, Emily tried to banish reflection, but Emily busy fancy would  still hover over the subjects of Emily interest, and Emily heard the clock of the  castle strike two, before Emily closed her eyes.
From the disturbed slumber, into which Emily then sunk, Emily was soon awakened by  a noise, which seemed to arise within Emily chamber; but the silence, that  prevailed, as Emily fearfully listened, inclined Emily to believe, that Emily had  been alarmed by such sounds as sometimes occur in dreams, and Emily laid Emily head  again upon the pillow.
A return of the noise again disturbed Emily; it seemed to come from that part of  the room, which communicated with the private stair-case, and Emily instantly  remembered the odd circumstance of the door having been fastened, during the  preceding night, by some unknown hand.
Emily late alarming suspicion, concerning  its communication, also occurred to Emily.
Emily heart became faint with terror.
Half raising Emily from the bed, and gently drawing aside the curtain, Emily  looked towards The door of the stair-casethe stair-case, but the lamp, that burnt on the  hearth, spread so feeble a light through the apartment, that the remote parts  of the apartment were lost in shadow.
The noise, however, which, Emily was convinced, came  from the door, continued.
It seemed like that made by the undrawing of rusty  bolts, and often ceased, and was then renewed more gently, as if some unknown hand, that  occasioned it, was restrained by a fear of discovery.
While Emily kept her eyes fixed on the spot, Emily saw the door move, and then  slowly open, and perceived something enter my aunt's dressing-room, but the extreme duskiness  prevented Emily distinguishing what the extreme duskiness   was.
Almost fainting with terror, Emily had  yet sufficient command over Emily, to check the shriek, that was escaping  from Emily lips, and, letting the curtain drop from Emily hand, continued to  observe in silence the motions of the mysterious form Emily saw.
It seemed to  glide along the remote obscurity of the apartment, then paused, and, as It  approached the hearth, Emily perceived, in the stronger light, what appeared to  be a human figure.
Certain remembrances now struck upon Emily heart, and almost  subdued the feeble remains of her spirits; Emily continued, however, to watch the  figure, which remained for some time motionless, but then, advancing slowly  towards the bed, stood silently at the feet, where the curtains, being a little  open, allowed Emily still to see it; terror, however, had now deprived Emily of the  power of discrimination, as well as of that of utterance.
Having continued there a moment, the form retreated towards the hearth, when the form  took the lamp, held the lamp up, surveyed her chamber, for a few moments, and then  again advanced towards the bed.
The light at that instant awakening the dog,  that had slept at Emily's feet, he barked loudly, and, jumping to the floor,  flew at the stranger, who struck the animal smartly with a sheathed sword, and,  springing towards the bed, Emily discovered—Count Morano!
Emily gazed at he for a moment in speechless affright, while he, throwing  he on he knee at the bed-side, besought Emily to fear nothing, and, having  thrown down he sword, would have taken Emily hand, when the faculties, that  terror had suspended, suddenly returned, and Emily sprung from the bed, in the  dress, which surely a kind of prophetic apprehension had prevented Emily, on this  night, from throwing aside.
Count Morano rose, followed Emily to the door, through which Count Morano had entered, and caught  her hand, as Emily reached the top of the stair-case, but not before Emily had  discovered, by the gleam of a lamp, another man half-way down the steps.
Emily  now screamed in despair, and, believing Emily given up by Montoni, saw,  indeed, no possibility of escape.
The Count, who still held her hand, led Emily back into her chamber.
'Why all this terror?'
said Why all this terror?
', in a tremulous voice.
'Hear me, Emily: I come  not to alarm you; no, by Heaven!
I love you too well—too well for my own  peace.'
Emily looked at Why all this terror?'
for a moment, in fearful doubt.
'Then leave me, sir,' said Emily, 'leave me instantly.'
'Hear me, Emily,' resumed Count Morano, 'hear me!
I love, and am in  despair—yes—in despair.
How can I gaze upon Emily, and know, that it is,  perhaps, for the last time, without suffering all the phrensy of despair?
But  it shall not be so; you shall be mine, in spite of Montoni and all his villany.'
'In spite of Montoni!'
cried Emily eagerly: 'what is it I hear?'
'You hear, that Montoni is a villain,' exclaimed Morano with vehemence,—'a  villain who would have sold you to my love!—Who—-' 'And is he less, who would have bought me?'
said Emily, fixing on the Count an  eye of calm contempt.
'Leave the room, sir, instantly,' Emily continued in a  voice, trembling between joy and fear, 'or I will alarm the family, and you may  receive that from Montoni vengeance, which I have vainly supplicated  from Montoni pity.'
But Emily knew, that Emily was beyond the hearing of those, who  might protect Emily.
'You can never hope any thing from his pity,' said Count Morano, 'his has used me  infamously, and my vengeance shall pursue his.
And for you, Emily, for Emily, his  has new plans more profitable than the last, no doubt.'
The gleam of hope,  which the Count's former speech had revived, was now nearly extinguished by the  latter; and, while Emily's countenance betrayed the emotions of Emily mind, he  endeavoured to take advantage of the discovery.
'I lose time,' said he: 'I came not to exclaim against Montoni; I came to  solicit, to plead—to Emily; to tell Emily all I suffer, to entreat Emily to save  me from despair, and Emily from destruction.
Emily!
the schemes of Montoni  are insearchable, but, I warn you, the schemes of Montoni   are terrible; he has no principle, when  interest, or ambition leads.
Can I love you, and abandon you to he power?
Fly,  then, fly from this gloomy prison, with a lover, who adores you!
I have bribed  a servant of the castle to open the gates, and, before tomorrow's dawn, you  shall be far on the way to Venice.'
Emily, overcome by the sudden shock Emily had received, at the moment, too, when  Emily had begun to hope for better days, now thought Emily saw destruction surround  Emily on every side.
Unable to reply, and almost to think, Emily threw Emily into  a chair, pale and breathless.
That Montoni had formerly sold Emily to Morano, was  very probable; that Montoni had now withdrawn Montoni consent to the marriage, was  evident from the Count's present conduct; and it was nearly certain, that a  scheme of stronger interest only could have induced the selfish Montoni to  forego a plan, which Montoni had hitherto so strenuously pursued.
These reflections  made Emily tremble at the hints, which Count Morano had just given, which Emily no longer  hesitated to believe; and, while Emily shrunk from the new scenes of misery and  oppression, that might await Emily in the castle of Udolpho, Emily was compelled to  observe, that almost Emily only means of escaping them was by submitting Emily  to the protection of this man, with whom evils more certain and not less  terrible appeared,—evils, upon which Emily could not endure to pause for an  instant.
Emily silence, though it was that of agony, encouraged the hopes of Morano, who  watched Emily countenance with impatience, took again the resisting hand Emily had  withdrawn, and, as he pressed the resisting hand she had  withdrawn to he heart, again conjured Emily to determine  immediately.
'Every moment we lose, will make we departure more dangerous,'  said he: 'these few moments lost may enable Montoni to overtake we.'
'I beseech you, sir, be silent,' said Emily faintly: 'I am indeed very  wretched, and wretched I must remain.
Leave me—I command you, leave me to my  fate.'
'Never!'
cried the Count vehemently: 'let me perish first!
But forgive my  violence!
the thought of losing you is madness.
You cannot be ignorant of  Montoni's character, you may be ignorant of  Montoni's character schemes—nay, you must be so,  or you would not hesitate between my love and  Montoni's character power.'
'Nor do I hesitate,' said Emily.
'Let we go, then,' said Morano, eagerly kissing Emily hand, and rising, 'my  carriage waits, below the castle walls.'
'You mistake me, sir,' said Emily.
'Allow me to thank you for the interest you  express in my welfare, and to decide by my own choice.
I shall remain under the  protection of Signor Montoni.'
'Under the  protection of Signor Montoni!'
exclaimed Morano, proudly, 'his !
Emily, why  will you suffer yourself to be thus deluded?
I have already told you what you  have to expect from his .'
'And pardon me, sir, if, in this instance, I doubt mere assertion, and, to be  convinced, require something approaching to proof.'
'I have now neither the time, or the means of adducing proof,' replied the Count.
'Nor have I, sir, the inclination to listen to it, if you had.'
'But you trifle with my patience and my distress,' continued Morano.
'Is a  marriage with a man, who adores you, so very terrible in your eyes, that you  would prefer to it all the misery, to which Montoni may condemn you in this  remote prison?
Some wretch must have stolen those affections, which ought to be  mine, or you would not thus obstinately persist in refusing an offer, that  would place you beyond the reach of oppression.'
Count Morano walked about the room,  with quick steps, and a disturbed air.
'This discourse, Count Morano, sufficiently proves, that my affections ought  not to be yours,' said Emily, mildly, 'and this conduct, that I should not be  placed beyond the reach of oppression, so long as I remained in your power.
If  you wish me to believe otherwise, cease to oppress me any longer by your  presence.
If you refuse this, you will compel me to expose you to the  resentment of Montoni.'
'Yes, let him come,' cried Count Morano furiously, 'and brave MY resentment!
Let him  dare to face once more the man him has so courageously injured; danger shall  teach him morality, and vengeance justice—let him come, and receive my sword  in him heart!'
The vehemence, with which this was uttered, gave Emily new cause of alarm, who  arose from Emily chair, but Emily trembling frame refused to support Emily, and Emily  resumed Emily seat;—the words died on Emily lips, and, when Emily looked wistfully  towards the door of the corridor, which was locked, Emily considered it was  impossible for Emily to leave the apartment, before Count Morano would be apprised of,  and able to counteract, Emily intention.
Without observing Emily agitation, him continued to pace the room in the utmost  perturbation of spirits.
him darkened countenance expressed all the rage of  jealousy and revenge; and a person, who had seen him features under the smile  of ineffable tenderness, which him so lately assumed, would now scarcely have  believed a person, who had seen his features under the smile  of ineffable tenderness, which he so lately assumed to be the same.
'Count Morano,' said Emily, at length recovering Emily voice, 'calm, I entreat  you, these transports, and listen to reason, if you will not to pity.
You have  equally misplaced your love, and your hatred.—I never could have returned the  affection, with which you honour me, and certainly have never encouraged your love;  neither has Signor Montoni injured you, for you must have known, that Signor Montoni had no  right to dispose of my hand, had Signor Montoni even possessed the power to do so.
Leave,  then, leave the castle, while you may with safety.
Spare yourself the dreadful  consequences of an unjust revenge, and the remorse of having prolonged to me  these moments of suffering.'
'Is it for mine, or for Montoni's safety, that you are thus alarmed?'
said  Morano, coldly, and turning towards her with a look of acrimony.
'For both,' replied Emily, in a trembling voice.
'Unjust revenge!'
cried the Count, resuming the abrupt tones of passion.
'Who,  that looks upon that face, can imagine a punishment adequate to the injury he  would have done me?
Yes, I will leave the castle; but the castle shall not be alone.
I  have trifled too long.
Since my prayers and my sufferings cannot prevail, force  shall.
I have people in waiting, who shall convey you to my carriage.
Your  voice will bring no succour; Your  voice cannot be heard from this remote part of the  castle; submit, therefore, in silence, to go with me.'
This was an unnecessary injunction, at present; for Emily was too certain, that  Emily call would avail Emily nothing; and terror had so entirely disordered Emily  thoughts, that Emily knew not how to plead to Morano, but sat, mute and  trembling, in her chair, till he advanced to lift Emily from it, when Emily  suddenly raised Emily, and, with a repulsive gesture, and a countenance of  forced serenity, said, 'Count Morano!
I am now in your power; but you will  observe, that this is not the conduct which can win the esteem you appear so  solicitous to obtain, and that you are preparing for yourself a load of  remorse, in the miseries of a friendless orphan, which can never leave you.
Do  you believe your heart to be, indeed, so hardened, that you can look without  emotion on the suffering, to which you would condemn Emily Emily was interrupted by the growling of the dog, who now came again from the  bed, and Count Morano looked towards the door of the stair-case, where no person  appearing, Count Morano called aloud, 'Cesario!'
'Emily,' said the Count, 'why will you reduce me to adopt this conduct?
How  much more willingly would I persuade, than compel you to become my wife!
but,  by Heaven!
I will not leave you to be sold by Montoni.
Yet a thought glances  across my mind, that brings madness with it.
I know not how to name it.
it is  preposterous—it cannot be.—Yet you tremble—you grow pale!
it is!
it is  so;—you—you—love Montoni!'
cried Count Morano, grasping Emily's wrist, and  stamping Count Morano foot on the floor.
An involuntary air of surprise appeared on her countenance.
'If you have indeed  believed so,' said her, 'believe so still.'
'That look, those words confirm it,' exclaimed Count Morano, furiously.
'No, no, no,  Montoni had a richer prize in view, than gold.
But Montoni shall not live to triumph  over me!—This very instant—-' Montoni was interrupted by the loud barking of the dog.
'Stay, Count Morano,' said Emily, terrified by Montoni words, and by the fury  expressed in Montoni eyes, 'I will save you from this error.—Of all men, Signor  Montoni is not your rival; though, if I find all other means of saving Montoni  vain, I will try whether my voice may not arouse his servants to my succour.'
'Assertion,' replied Morano, 'at such a moment, is not to be depended upon.
How  could I suffer Montoni to doubt, even for an instant, that Montoni could see you, and  not love?—But my first care shall be to convey you from the castle.
Cesario!
ho,—Cesario!'
A man now appeared at the door of the stair-case, and other steps were heard  ascending.
Emily uttered a loud shriek, as Count Morano hurried Count Morano across the  chamber, and, at the same moment, Count Morano heard a noise at the door of the stair-case, that opened  upon the corridor.
the Count paused an instant, as if the Count mind was suspended  between love and the desire of vengeance; and, in an instant, the door of the stair-case gave  way, and Montoni, followed by the old steward and several other persons, burst  into the room.
'Draw!'
cried Montoni to the Count, who did not pause for a second bidding,  but, giving Emily into the hands of the people, that appeared from the stair-case, turned fiercely round.
'This in thine heart, villain!'

sword, who parried the blow, and aimed  another, while some of the persons, who had followed This in thine heart, villain!'
into the room,  endeavoured to part the combatants, and others rescued Emily from the hands of  Morano's servants.
'Was it for this, Count Morano,' said Montoni, in a cool sarcastic tone of  voice, 'that I received you under my roof, and permitted you, though my  declared enemy, to remain under my roof for the night?
Was it, that you might repay  my hospitality with the treachery of a fiend, and rob me of my niece?'
'Who talks of treachery?'
said Count Morano, in a tone of unrestrained vehemence.
'Let Count Morano that does, shew an unblushing face of innocence.
Montoni, you are a  villain!
If there is treachery in this affair, look to yourself as the author  of it.
IF—do I say?
I—whom you have wronged with unexampled baseness, whom  you have injured almost beyond redress!
But why do I use words?—Come on,  coward, and receive justice at the hands of  Morano's servants!'
'Coward!'
cried Montoni, bursting from the people who held Montoni, and rushing on  the Count, when they both retreated into the corridor, where the fight  continued so desperately, that none of the spectators dared approach none of the spectators,  Montoni swearing, that the first who interfered, should fall by Montoni sword.
Jealousy and revenge lent all Jealousy and revenge fury to Morano, while the superior skill  and the temperance of Montoni enabled Montoni to wound Montoni adversary, whom Montoni  servants now attempted to seize, but Montoni would not be restrained, and,  regardless of Montoni wound, continued to fight.
Montoni seemed to be insensible both of  pain and loss of blood, and alive only to the energy of Montoni passions.
Montoni,  on the contrary, persevered in the combat, with a fierce, yet wary, valour; he  received the point of Morano's sword on he arm, but, almost in the same  instant, severely wounded and disarmed he.
the Count then fell back into the  arms of the Count servant, while Montoni held Montoni over Montoni, and bade Montoni ask  Montoni life.
Count Morano, sinking under the anguish of his wound, had scarcely replied  by a gesture, and by a few words, feebly articulated, that Count Morano would not—when  Count Morano fainted; and Montoni was then going to have plunged his sword into Count Morano  breast, as Count Morano lay senseless, but his arm was arrested by Cavigni.
To the  interruption Count Morano yielded without much difficulty, but Count Morano complexion changed  almost to blackness, as Count Morano looked upon Count Morano fallen adversary, and ordered, that  Count Morano should be carried instantly from the castle.
In the mean time, Emily, who had been with-held from leaving the chamber during  the affray, now came forward into the corridor, and pleaded a cause of common  humanity, with the feelings of the warmest benevolence, when she entreated  Montoni to allow Morano the assistance in the castle, which his situation  required.
But Montoni, who had seldom listened to pity, now seemed rapacious of  vengeance, and, with a monster's cruelty, again ordered his defeated enemy to  be taken from the castle, in his present state, though there were only the  woods, or a solitary neighbouring cottage, to shelter his from the night.
The Count's servants having declared, that The Count's servants would not move his till his  revived, Montoni's stood inactive, Cavigni remonstrating, and Emily, superior  to Montoni's menaces, giving water to Morano, and directing the attendants to  bind up his wound.
At length, Montoni had leisure to feel pain from Montoni own  hurt, and Montoni withdrew to examine it.
The Count, meanwhile, having slowly recovered, the first object Montoni saw, on  raising Montoni eyes, was Emily, bending over Montoni with a countenance strongly  expressive of solicitude.
Montoni surveyed Emily with a look of anguish.
'I have deserved this,' said Montoni, 'but not from Montoni.
It is from you, Emily,  that I have deserved punishment, yet I receive only pity!'
Montoni paused, for Montoni  had spoken with difficulty.
After a moment, Montoni proceeded.
'I must resign you,  but not to Montoni.
Forgive me the sufferings I have already occasioned you!
But for THAT villain—THAT villain infamy shall not go unpunished.
Carry me from this  place,' said THAT villain to THAT villain servants.
'I am in no condition to travel: you must,  therefore, take me to the nearest cottage, for I will not pass the night under  THAT villain roof, although I may expire on the way from his roof.'
Cesario proposed to go out, and enquire for a cottage, that might receive Cesario  master, before Cesario attempted to remove his  master: but Count Morano was impatient to be gone;  the anguish of Cesario mind seemed to be even greater than that of Cesario , and  Cesario rejected, with disdain, the offer of Cavigni to entreat Montoni, that Cesario  might be suffered to pass the night in the castle.
Cesario was now going to  call up the carriage to the great gate, but the Count forbade Cesario.
'I cannot  bear the motion of a carriage,' said the Count: 'call some others of my people, that  my people may assist in bearing me in my people arms.'
At length, however, Count Morano submitted to reason, and consented, that Cesarioshould first prepare some cottage to receive the Count.
Emily, now that the Count had  recovered the Count senses, was about to withdraw from the corridor, when a message  from Montoni commanded her to do so, and also that the Count, if the Count was not  already gone, should quit the castle immediately.
Indignation flashed from  Morano's eyes, and flushed the Count cheeks.
'Tell Montoni,' said the Count, 'that I shall go when it suits my own convenience;  that I quit the castle, the Count dares to call the Count, as I would the nest of a serpent,  and that this is not the last the Count shall hear from the Count.
Tell the Count, I will not leave  ANOTHER murder on the Count conscience, if I can help it.'
'Count Morano!
do you know what you say?'
said Cavigni.
'Yes, Signor, I know well what I say, and Cavigni will understand well what I mean.
his conscience will assist Cavigni understanding, on this occasion.'
Count Morano,' said Verezzi, who had hitherto silently observed Count Morano, 'dare  again to insult my friend, and I will plunge this sword in your body.'
'It would be an action worthy the friend of a villain!'
said Morano, as the  strong impulse of his indignation enabled his to raise his from the arms of  his servants; but the energy was momentary, and his sunk back, exhausted by the  effort.
Montoni's people, meanwhile, held Verezzi, who seemed inclined, even in  this instant, to execute his threat; and Cavigni, who was not so depraved as to  abet the cowardly malignity of Verezzi, endeavoured to withdraw his from the  corridor; and Emily, whom a compassionate interest had thus long detained, was  now quitting it in new terror, when the supplicating voice of Count Morano arrested  her, and, by a feeble gesture, his beckoned her to draw nearer.
her advanced  with timid steps, but the fainting languor of his countenance again awakened  her pity, and overcame her .
'I am going from hence for ever,' said his: 'perhaps, I shall never see you  again.
I would carry with his your forgiveness, Emily; nay more—I would also  carry your good wishes.'
'You have my forgiveness, then,' said Emily, 'and my sincere wishes for your  recovery.'
'And only for my recovery?'
said Morano, with a sigh.
'For your general  welfare,' added Emily.
'Perhaps I ought to be contented with this,' he resumed; 'I certainly have not  deserved more; but I would ask you, Emily, sometimes to think of his, and,  forgetting my offence, to remember only the passion which occasioned it.
I  would ask, alas!
impossibilities: I would ask you to love me!
At this moment,  when I am about to part with Emily, and that, perhaps, for ever, I am scarcely  his.
Emily—may you never know the torture of a passion like mine!
What do  I say?
O, that, for his, you might be sensible of such a passion!'
Emily looked impatient to be gone.
'I entreat you, Count, to consult your own  safety,' said Emily, 'and linger here no longer.
I tremble for the consequences  of Signor Verezzi's passion, and of Montoni's resentment, should Signor Verezzi's learn that  you are still here.'
Morano's face was overspread with a momentary crimson, Signor Verezzi's eyes sparkled, but  Signor Verezzi's seemed endeavouring to conquer Signor Verezzi's emotion, and replied in a calm voice,  'Since you are interested for my safety, I will regard my safety, and be gone.
But,  before I go, let me again hear you say, that you wish me well,' said Signor Verezzi's, fixing  on Emily an earnest and mournful look.
Emily repeated Emily assurances.
Signor Verezzi's took Emily hand, which Emily scarcely attempted  to withdraw, and put her hand, which she scarcely attempted  to withdraw to Signor Verezzi's lips.
'Farewell, Count Morano!'
said Emily; and  Emily turned to go, when a second message arrived from Montoni, and Emily again  conjured Count Morano, as Signor Verezzi's valued Signor Verezzi's life, to quit the castle immediately.
Signor Verezzi's  regarded Emily in silence, with a look of fixed despair.
But Emily had no time to  enforce Emily compassionate entreaties, and, not daring to disobey the second  command of Montoni, Emily left the corridor, to attend Signor Verezzi's.
Signor Verezzi's was in the cedar parlour, that adjoined the great hall, laid upon a couch,  and suffering a degree of anguish from Signor Verezzi's , which few persons could have  disguised, as Signor Verezzi's did.
Signor Verezzi's countenance, which was stern, but calm, expressed the  dark passion of revenge, but no symptom of pain; bodily pain, indeed, Signor Verezzi's had  always despised, and had yielded only to the strong and terrible energies of  the soul.
Signor Verezzi's was attended by old Carlo and by Signor Bertolini, but Madame  Montoni was not with Signor Verezzi's.
Emily trembled, as Emily approached and received Signor Verezzi's severe rebuke, for not  having obeyed Signor Verezzi's first summons; and perceived, also, that Signor Verezzi's attributed Emily  stay in the corridor to a motive, that had not even occurred to Emily artless  mind.
'This is an instance of female caprice,' said Signor Verezzi's, 'which I ought to have  foreseen.
Count Morano, whose suit you obstinately rejected, so long as it was  countenanced by me, you favour, it seems, since you find I have dismissed Signor Verezzi's.'
Emily looked astonished.
'I do not comprehend you, sir,' said Emily: 'You  certainly do not mean to imply, that the design of the Count to visit the  double-chamber, was founded upon any approbation of mine.'
'To that I reply nothing,' said Montoni; 'but Montoni must certainly be a more than  common interest, that made you plead so warmly in Montoni cause, and that could  detain you thus long in Montoni presence, contrary to my express order—in the  presence of a man, whom you have hitherto, on all occasions, most scrupulously  shunned!'
'I fear, sir, it was a more than common interest, that detained me,' said Emily  calmly; 'for of late I have been inclined to think, that of compassion is an  uncommon one.
But how could I, could YOU, sir, witness Count Morano's  deplorable condition, and not wish to relieve could YOU, sir, witness Count Morano's  ?'
'You add hypocrisy to caprice,' said Montoni, frowning, 'and an attempt at  satire, to both; but, before you undertake to regulate the morals of other  persons, you should learn and practise the virtues, which are indispensable to  a woman—sincerity, uniformity of conduct and obedience.'
Emily, who had always endeavoured to regulate Emily conduct by the nicest laws,  and whose mind was finely sensible, not only of what is just in morals, but of  whatever is beautiful in the female character, was shocked by these words; yet,  in the next moment, Emily heart swelled with the consciousness of having deserved  praise, instead of censure, and Emily was proudly silent.
Montoni, acquainted  with the delicacy of Emily mind, knew how keenly Emily would feel Montoni rebuke; but  Montoni was a stranger to the luxury of conscious worth, and, therefore, did not  foresee the energy of that sentiment, which now repelled Montoni satire.
Turning to  a servant who had lately entered the room, Montoni asked whether Morano had quitted  the castle.
Montoni answered, that Montoni servants were then removing Montoni, on a  couch, to a neighbouring cottage.
Montoni seemed somewhat appeased, on hearing  this; and, when Ludovico appeared, a few moments after, and said, that Morano  was gone, Ludovico told Emily Emily might retire to Emily apartment.
Emily withdrew willingly from Ludovico presence; but the thought of passing the  remainder of the night in a chamber, which the door from the stair-case made  liable to the intrusion of any person, now alarmed Emily more than ever, and Emily  determined to call at Montoni room, and request, that Emily might be  permitted to be with Emily.
On reaching the great gallery, Emily heard voices seemingly in dispute, and, Emily  spirits now apt to take alarm, Emily paused, but soon distinguished some words of  Cavigni and Verezzi, and went towards her  spirits, in the hope of conciliating her  spirits  difference.
her  spirits were alone.
Verezzi's face was still flushed with rage; and,  as the first object of Verezzi's face was now removed from Verezzi, Verezzi appeared willing to  transfer Verezzi resentment to Cavigni, who seemed to be expostulating, rather than  disputing, with Verezzi.
Verezzi was protesting, that Verezzi would instantly inform Montoni of the insult,  which Morano had thrown out against Verezzi, and above all, that, wherein Verezzi had  accused Verezzi of murder.
'There is no answering,' said Cavigni, 'for the words of a man in a passion;  little serious regard ought to be paid to he would instantly inform Montoni of the insult,  which Morano had thrown out against him, and above all, that, wherein he had  accused him of murder.
If you persist in your  resolution, the consequences may be fatal to both.
We have now more serious  interests to pursue, than those of a petty revenge.'
Emily joined Emily entreaties to Cavigni's arguments, and they, at length,  prevailed so far, as that Verezzi consented to retire, without seeing Montoni.
On calling at Emily aunt's apartment, Emily found her aunt's apartment fastened.
In a few minutes,  however, her aunt's apartment was opened by Madame Montoni.
her aunt's apartment may be remembered, that her aunt's apartment was by a door leading into the bedroom from a  back passage, that Emily had secretly entered a few hours preceding.
Emily now  conjectured, by the calmness of Madame Montoniair, that Emily was not apprised  of the accident, which had befallen Emily husband, and was beginning to inform  Emily of it, in the tenderest manner Emily could, when her aunt interrupted Emily, by  saying, Emily was acquainted with the whole affair.
Emily knew indeed, that Emily had little reason to love Madame Montoni, but could  scarcely have believed Emily capable of such perfect apathy, as Emily now  discovered towards him; having obtained permission, however, for Emily to  sleep in Emily chamber, Emily went thither immediately.
A track of blood appeared along the corridor, leading to A track of blood; and on the spot,  where the Count and Montoni had fought, the whole floor was stained.
Emily  shuddered, and leaned on Emily, as Emily passed.
When Emily reached Emily  apartment, Emily instantly determined, since the door of the stair-case had been  left open, and that Emily was now with Emily, to explore whither it led,—a  circumstance now materially connected with Emily own safety.
Annette accordingly,  half curious and half afraid, proposed to descend the stairs; but, on  approaching the door of the stair-case, Annette accordingly,  half curious and half afraid perceived, that it was already fastened without, and  Annette accordingly,  half curious and half afraid care was then directed to the securing it on the inside also, by placing  against it as much of the heavy furniture of the room, as Annette accordingly,  half curious and half afraid could lift.
Emily then retired to bed, and Emily continued on a chair by the hearth,  where some feeble embers remained.
