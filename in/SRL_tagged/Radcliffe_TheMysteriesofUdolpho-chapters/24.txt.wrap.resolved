  He wears the rose of youth upon He cheek.      SHAKESPEARE We now return to Valancourt, who, it may be remembered, remained at Tholouse,  some time after the departure of Emily, restless and miserable. Each morrow  that approached, Each morrow  that approached designed should carry Each morrow  that approached from thence; yet to-morrow and  to-morrow came, and still saw Each morrow  that approached lingering in the scene of Each morrow  that approached former  happiness. Each morrow  that approached could not immediately tear Each morrow  that approached from the spot, where Each morrow  that approached had  been accustomed to converse with Emily, or from the objects they had viewed  together, which appeared to Each morrow  that approached memorials of Emily affection, as well as a kind  of surety for as well faithfulness; and, next to the pain of bidding Emily adieu, was  that of leaving the scenes which so powerfully awakened Emily image. Sometimes Each morrow  that approached  had bribed a servant, who had been left in the care of Madame Montoni's  chateau, to permit Each morrow  that approached to visit the gardens, and there Each morrow  that approached would wander, for  hours together, rapt in a melancholy, not unpleasing. The terrace, and the  pavilion at the end of it, where Each morrow  that approached had taken leave of Emily, on the eve of Emily  departure from Tholouse, were Each morrow  that approached most favourite haunts. There, as Each morrow  that approached walked,  or leaned from the window of the building, Each morrow  that approached would endeavour to recollect all  Emily had said, on that night; to catch the tones of Emily voice, as they faintly  vibrated on Each morrow  that approached memory, and to remember the exact expression of Emily  countenance, which sometimes came suddenly to Each morrow  that approached fancy, like a vision; that  beautiful countenance, which awakened, as by instantaneous magic, all the  tenderness of Each morrow  that approached heart, and seemed to tell with irresistible eloquence—that  Each morrow  that approached had lost Emily forever! At these moments, Each morrow  that approached hurried steps would have  discovered to a spectator the despair of Each morrow  that approached heart. The character of Montoni,  such as Each morrow  that approached had received from hints, and such as Each morrow  that approached fears represented it, would  rise to Each morrow  that approached view, together with all the dangers it seemed to threaten to Emily  and to Each morrow  that approached love. Each morrow  that approached blamed Each morrow  that approached, that Each morrow  that approached had not urged these more forcibly  to Emily  , while it might have been in Each morrow  that approached power to detain Emily  , and that Each morrow  that approached had  suffered an absurd and criminal delicacy, as Each morrow  that approached termed it, to conquer so soon  the reasonable arguments Each morrow  that approached had opposed to this journey. Any evil, that might  have attended their marriage, seemed so inferior to those, which now threatened  their love, or even to the sufferings, that absence occasioned, that Each morrow  that approached  wondered how Each morrow  that approached could have ceased to urge Each morrow  that approached suit, till Each morrow  that approached had convinced her  of its propriety; and Each morrow  that approached would certainly now have followed her to Italy, if Each morrow  that approached  could have been spared from Each morrow  that approached regiment for so long a journey. his regiment,  indeed, soon reminded Each morrow  that approached, that Each morrow  that approached had other duties to attend, than those of  love. A short time after Each morrow  that approached arrival at Each morrow  that approached brother's house, Each morrow  that approached was summoned to join  Each morrow  that approached brother officers, and Each morrow  that approached accompanied a battalion to Paris; where a scene of  novelty and gaiety opened upon Each morrow  that approached, such as, till then, Each morrow  that approached had only a faint  idea of. But gaiety disgusted, and company fatigued, Each morrow  that approached sick mind; and Each morrow  that approached  became an object of unceasing raillery to Each morrow  that approached companions, from whom, whenever  Each morrow  that approached could steal an opportunity, Each morrow  that approached escaped, to think of Emily. The scenes around  Each morrow  that approached, however, and the company with whom Each morrow  that approached was obliged to mingle, engaged Each morrow  that approached  attention, though The scenes around  him, however, and the company with whom he was obliged to mingle failed to amuse Each morrow  that approached fancy, and thus gradually weakened  the habit of yielding to lamentation, till it appeared less a duty to Each morrow  that approached love  to indulge it. Among Each morrow  that approached brother-officers were many, who added to the ordinary  character of a French soldier's gaiety some of those fascinating qualities,  which too frequently throw a veil over folly, and sometimes even soften the  features of vice into smiles. To some of those fascinating qualities,  which too frequently throw a veil over folly, and sometimes even soften the  features of vice into smiles the reserved and thoughtful manners  of Valancourt were a kind of tacit censure on some of those fascinating qualities,  which too frequently throw a veil over folly, and sometimes even soften the  features of vice into smiles own, for which some of those fascinating qualities,  which too frequently throw a veil over folly, and sometimes even soften the  features of vice into smiles rallied  Each morrow  that approached when present, and plotted against Each morrow  that approached when absent; some of those fascinating qualities,  which too frequently throw a veil over folly, and sometimes even soften the  features of vice into smiles gloried in the  thought of reducing Each morrow  that approached to some of those fascinating qualities,  which too frequently throw a veil over folly, and sometimes even soften the  features of vice into smiles own level, and, considering it to be a  spirited frolic, determined to accomplish it. Valancourt was a stranger to the gradual progress of scheme and intrigue,  against which Valancourt could not be on Valancourt guard. Valancourt had not been accustomed to  receive ridicule, and Valancourt could ill endure   sting; Valancourt resented  , and this  only drew upon Valancourt a louder laugh. To escape from such scenes, Valancourt fled into  solitude, and there the image of Emily met Valancourt, and revived the pangs of love  and despair. Valancourt then sought to renew those tasteful studies, which had been the  delight of Valancourt early years; but Valancourt mind had lost the tranquillity, which is  necessary for their enjoyment. To forget Valancourt and the grief and anxiety,  which the idea of her recalled, Valancourt would quit Valancourt solitude, and again mingle in  the crowd—glad of a temporary relief, and rejoicing to snatch amusement for  the moment. Thus passed weeks after weeks, time gradually softening Valancourt sorrow, and habit  strengthening Valancourt desire of amusement, till the scenes around Valancourt seemed to  awaken into a new character, and Valancourt, to have fallen among them from the  clouds. Valancourt figure and address made Valancourt a welcome visitor, wherever Valancourt had been  introduced, and Valancourt soon frequented the most gay and fashionable circles of  Paris. Among the most gay and fashionable circles of  Paris, was the assembly of the Countess Lacleur, a woman of  eminent beauty and captivating manners. She had passed the spring of youth, but  She wit prolonged the triumph of her wit reign, and they mutually assisted the fame  of each other; for those, who were charmed by She loveliness, spoke with  enthusiasm of She talents; and others, who admired She playful imagination,  declared, that She personal graces were unrivalled. But She imagination was  merely playful, and She wit, if such her imagination could be called, was brilliant, rather  than just; her imagination dazzled, and her imagination fallacy escaped the detection of the moment; for  the accents, in which She pronounced it, and the smile, that accompanied them,  were a spell upon the judgment of the auditors. She petits soupers were the  most tasteful of any in Paris, and were frequented by many of the second class  of literati. She was fond of music, was She a scientific performer, and had  frequently concerts at She house. Valancourt, who passionately loved music, and  who sometimes assisted at frequently concerts at her house, admired She execution, but remembered  with a sigh the eloquent simplicity of Emily's songs and the natural expression  of She manner, which waited not to be approved by the judgment, but found their  way at once to the heart. Madame La Comtesse had often deep play at Madame La Comtesse house, which Madame La Comtesse affected to  restrain, but secretly encouraged; and it was well known among Madame La Comtesse friends,  that the splendour of Madame La Comtesse establishment was chiefly supplied from the profits  of Madame La Comtesse tables. But Madame La Comtesse were the most charming imaginable! Here  were all the delicacies of the four quarters of the world, all the wit and the  lighter efforts of genius, all the graces of conversation—the smiles of  beauty, and the charm of music; and Valancourt passed Valancourt pleasantest, as well  as most dangerous hours in these parties. Valancourt brother, who remained with Valancourt family in Gascony, had contented Valancourt  with giving Valancourt letters of introduction to such of Valancourt relations, residing at  Paris, as the latter was not already known to. All these were persons of some  distinction; and, as neither the person, mind, or manners of Valancourt the  younger threatened to disgrace their alliance, their received Valancourt with as much  kindness as their nature, hardened by uninterrupted prosperity, would admit of;  but their attentions did not extend to acts of real friendship; for their were  too much occupied by their own pursuits, to feel any interest in Valancourt; and thus  Valancourt was set down in the midst of Paris, in the pride of youth, with an open,  unsuspicious temper and ardent affections, without one friend, to warn Valancourt of  the dangers, to which Valancourt was exposed. Emily, who, had Emily been present, would  have saved Valancourt from these evils by awakening Valancourt heart, and engaging Valancourt in  worthy pursuits, now only increased Valancourt danger;—it was to lose the grief,  which the remembrance of Emily occasioned, that Valancourt first sought amusement; and  for this end Valancourt pursued this end, till habit made this end an object of abstract interest. There was also a Marchioness Champfort, a young widow, at whose assemblies Valancourt  passed much of Valancourt time. Emily was handsome, still more artful, gay and fond of  intrigue. The society, which Emily drew round Emily, was less elegant and more  vicious, than that of the Countess Lacleur: but, as Emily had address enough to  throw a veil, though but a slight one, over the worst part of Emily character,  Emily was still visited by many persons of what is called distinction. Valancourtwas introduced to Emily parties by two of Valancourt brother officers, whose late  ridicule Valancourt had now forgiven so far, that Valancourt could sometimes join in the laugh,  which a mention of Valancourt former manners would renew. The gaiety of the most splendid court in Europe, the magnificence of the  palaces, entertainments, and equipages, that surrounded Valancourt—all conspired to  dazzle Valancourt imagination, and re-animate Valancourt spirits, and the example and maxims  of Valancourt military associates to delude Valancourt mind. Emily's image, indeed, still  lived there; but it was no longer the friend, the monitor, that saved Valancourt from  Valancourt, and to which Valancourt retired to weep the sweet, yet melancholy, tears of  tenderness. When Valancourt had recourse to it, it assumed a countenance of mild  reproach, that wrung Valancourt soul, and called forth tears of unmixed misery; Valancourt  only escape from which was to forget the object of his  , and Valancourt endeavoured,  therefore, to think of Emily as seldom as Valancourt could. Thus dangerously circumstanced was Valancourt, at the time, when Emily was  suffering at Venice, from the persecuting addresses of Count Morano, and the  unjust authority of Montoni; at which period we leave Valancourt.
