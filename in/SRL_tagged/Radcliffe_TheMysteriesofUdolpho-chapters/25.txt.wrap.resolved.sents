  The image of a wicked, heinous fault  Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his  Does shew the mood of a much-troubled breast.
KING JOHN Leaving the gay scenes of Paris, we return to those of the gloomy Apennine,  where Emily's thoughts were still faithful to Valancourt.
Looking to KING JOHN as to  her only hope, her recollected, with jealous exactness, every assurance and  every proof her had witnessed of KING JOHN affection; read again and again the  letters her had received from KING JOHN; weighed, with intense anxiety, the force of  every word, that spoke of KING JOHN attachment; and dried her tears, as her trusted  in KING JOHN truth.
Montoni, meanwhile, had made strict enquiry concerning the strange circumstance  of Montoni alarm, without obtaining information; and was, at length, obliged to  account for it by the reasonable supposition, that it was a mischievous trick  played off by one of Montoni domestics.
Montoni disagreements with Montoni, on  the subject of Montoni settlements, were now more frequent than ever; Montoni even  confined Montoni entirely to Montoni own apartment, and did not scruple to threaten Montoni  with much greater severity, should Montoni persevere in a refusal.
Reason, had Montoni consulted it, would now have perplexed Montoni in the choice of a  conduct to be adopted.
it would have pointed out the danger of irritating by  further opposition a man, such as Montoni had proved Montoni to be, and to  whose power Montoni had so entirely committed Montoni; and it would also have told  Montoni, of what extreme importance to Montoni future comfort it was, to reserve for  Montoni those possessions, which would enable Montoni to live independently of  Montoni, should Montoni ever escape from Montoni immediate controul.
But Montoni was  directed by a more decisive guide than reason—the spirit of revenge, which  urged Montoni to oppose violence to violence, and obstinacy to obstinacy.
Wholly confined to the solitude of Montoni apartment, Montoni was now reduced to  solicit the society Montoni had lately rejected; for Montoni was the only person,  except Annette, with whom Montoni was permitted to converse.
Generously anxious for Montoni peace, Montoni, therefore, tried to persuade, when Montoni  could not convince, and sought by every gentle means to induce Montoni to forbear  that asperity of reply, which so greatly irritated Montoni.
The pride of Montoni  aunt did sometimes soften to the soothing voice of Montoni, and there even were  moments, when Montoni regarded Montoni affectionate attentions with goodwill.
The scenes of terrible contention, to which Montoni was frequently compelled to  be witness, exhausted Montoni spirits more than any circumstances, that had  occurred since Montoni departure from Tholouse.
The gentleness and goodness of Montoni  parents, together with the scenes of Montoni early happiness, often stole on Montoni  mind, like the visions of a higher world; while the characters and  circumstances, now passing beneath Montoni eye, excited both terror and surprise.
Montoni could scarcely have imagined, that passions so fierce and so various, as  those which Montoni exhibited, could have been concentrated in one individual;  yet what more surprised Montoni, was, that, on great occasions, he could bend these  passions, wild as they were, to the cause of he interest, and generally could  disguise in he countenance they operation on he mind; but Montoni had seen he  too often, when he had thought it unnecessary to conceal he nature, to be  deceived on such occasions.
Montoni present life appeared like the dream of a distempered imagination, or like  one of those frightful fictions, in which the wild genius of the poets  sometimes delighted.
Reflection brought only regret, and anticipation terror.
How often did Montoni wish to 'steal the lark's wing, and mount the swiftest gale,'  that Languedoc and repose might once more be hers!
Of Count Morano's health Montoni made frequent enquiry; but Montoni heard only  vague reports of his danger, and that his surgeon had said his would never leave  the cottage alive; while Emily could not but be shocked to think, that Emily,  however innocently, might be the means of his death; and Annette, who did not  fail to observe Emily emotion, interpreted it in Emily own way.
But a circumstance soon occurred, which entirely withdrew Montoni's attention  from this subject, and awakened the surprise and curiosity so natural to Emily.
Coming one day to Emily's apartment, with a countenance full of importance,  'What can all this mean, ma'amselle?'
said Emily.
'Would I was once safe in  Languedoc again, they should never catch me going on my travels any more!
I  must think it a fine thing, truly, to come abroad, and see foreign parts!
I  little thought I was coming to be catched up in a old castle, among such dreary  mountains, with the chance of being murdered, or, what is as good, having my  throat cut!'
'What can all this mean, indeed, Montoni?'
said Emily, in astonishment.
'Aye, ma'amselle, you may look surprised; but you won't believe it, perhaps,  till they have murdered you, too.
You would not believe about the ghost I told  you of, though I shewed you the very place, where it used to appear!—You will  believe nothing, ma'amselle.'
'Not till you speak more reasonably, Montoni; for Heaven's sake, explain your  meaning.
You spoke of murder!'
'Aye, ma'amselle, they are coming to murder us all, perhaps; but what signifies  explaining?—you will not believe.'
Emily again desired Emily to relate what Emily had seen, or heard.
'O, I have seen enough, ma'am, and heard too much, as Ludovico can prove.
Poor  soul!
they will murder Ludovico, too!
I little thought, when Ludovico sung those sweet  verses under my lattice, at Venice!
'—Emily looked impatient and displeased.
'Well, ma'amselle, as I was saying, these preparations about the castle, and  these strange-looking people, that are calling here every day, and the Signor's  cruel usage of my lady, and Ludovico odd goings-on—all these, as I told Ludovico,  can bode no good.
And Ludovico bid me hold my tongue.
So, says I, the Signor's  strangely altered, Ludovico, in the castle, to what Ludovico was in France;  there, all so gay!
Nobody so gallant to my lady, then; and Ludovico could smile, too,  upon a poor servant, sometimes, and jeer my lady, too, good-naturedly enough.
I  remember once, when Ludovico said to Ludovico, as I was going out of my lady's  dressing-room—Annette, says he—' 'Never mind what the Signor's   said,' interrupted Emily; 'but tell me, at once,  the circumstance, which has thus alarmed you.'
'Aye, ma'amselle,' rejoined Annette, 'that is just what Ludovico said: says Ludovico,  Never mind what the Signor's   says to you.
So I told Signor what I thought about the Signor's  .
Signor is so strangely altered, said I: for now Signor is so haughty, and so  commanding, and so sharp with my lady; and, if Signor meets one, Signor'll scarcely  look at one, unless it be to frown.
So much the better, says Ludovico, so much  the better.
And to tell you the truth, ma'amselle, I thought this was a very  ill-natured speech of Ludovico: but I went on.
And then, says I, Signor is always  knitting Signor brows; and if one speaks to Signor, Signor does not hear; and then Signor  sits up counselling so, of a night, with the other Signors—there they are,  till long past midnight, discoursing together!
Aye, but says Ludovico, you  don't know what they are counselling about.
No, said I, but I can guess—it is  about my lady.
Upon that, Ludovico burst out a-laughing, quite loud; so  Ludovico put me in a huff, for I did not like that either I or you, ma'amselle,  should be laughed at; and I turned away quick, but Ludovico stopped me.
"Don't be  affronted, Annette," said Ludovico, "but I cannot help laughing;" and with that Ludovico  laughed again.
"What!"
says Ludovico, "do you think the Signors sit up, night after  night, only to counsel about my lady!
No, no, there is something more in  the wind than that.
And these repairs about the castle, and these preparations  about the ramparts—these preparations  about the ramparts are not making about young ladies."
Why, surely, said  I, the Signor, my master, is not going to make war?
"Make war!"
said Ludovico,  "what, upon the mountains and the woods?
for here is no living soul to make war  upon that I see."
'What are these preparations for, then?
said I; why surely nobody is coming to  take away my master's castle!
"Then there are so many ill-looking fellows  coming to the castle every day," says Ludovico, without answering my question,  "and the Signor sees so many ill-looking fellows  , and talks with so many ill-looking fellows  , and so many ill-looking fellows   stay in  the neighbourhood!
By holy St. Marco!
some of so many ill-looking fellows   are the most  cut-throat-looking dogs I ever set my eyes upon."
'I asked Ludovico again, if Ludovico thought some of them were coming to take away my  master's castle; and Ludovico said, No, Ludovico did not think some of them were, but Ludovico did not  know for certain.
"Then yesterday," said Ludovico, but you must not tell this,  ma'amselle, "yesterday, a party of some of them came, and left all some of them horses in  the castle stables, where, it seems, a party of these men are to stay, for the Signor ordered  them all to be entertained with the best provender in the manger; but the men  are, most of them all, in the neighbouring cottages."
'So, ma'amselle, I came to tell you all this, for I never heard any thing so  strange in my life.
But what can the men   be come about, if it is  not to murder us?
And the Signor's   knows this, or why should the Signor's   be so civil to  them?
And why should the Signor's   fortify the castle, and counsel so much with the other  Signors, and be so thoughtful?'
'Is this all you have to tell, Montoni?'
said Montoni.
'Have you heard nothing  else, that alarms you?'
'Nothing else, ma'amselle!'
said Montoni; 'why, is not this enough?'
'Quite  enough for my patience, Montoni, but not quite enough to convince me us are all  to be murdered, though I acknowledge here is sufficient food for curiosity.'
Montoni forbore to speak Montoni apprehensions, because Montoni would not encourage  Montoni's wild terrors; but the present circumstances of the castle both  surprised, and alarmed Montoni.
Montoni, having told Montoni tale, left the chamber, on  the wing for new wonders.
In the evening, Emily had passed some melancholy hours with Montoni, and  was retiring to rest, when Emily was alarmed by a strange and loud knocking at  Emily chamber door, and then a heavy weight fell against a heavy weight, that almost burst a heavy weight  open.
Emily called to know who was there, and receiving no answer, repeated the  call; but a chilling silence followed.
It occurred to Emily—for, at this  moment, Emily could not reason on the probability of circumstances—that some  one of the strangers, lately arrived at the castle, had discovered Emily  apartment, and was come with such intent, as their looks rendered too  possible—to rob, perhaps to murder, Emily.
The moment Emily admitted this  possibility, terror supplied the place of conviction, and a kind of instinctive  remembrance of Emily remote situation from the family heightened it to a degree,  that almost overcame Emily senses.
Emily looked at the door, which led to the  staircase, expecting to see the  staircase open, and listening, in fearful silence, for a  return of the noise, till Emily began to think the  staircase had proceeded from this door,  and a wish of escaping through the opposite one rushed upon Emily mind.
Emily went  to this door, and then, fearing to open this door, lest some person might be  silently lurking for Emily without, Emily stopped, but with Emily eyes fixed in  expectation upon the opposite door of the stair-case.
As thus Emily stood, Emily  heard a faint breathing near Emily, and became convinced, that some person was on  the other side of the door, which was already locked.
Emily sought for other  fastening, but there was none.
While Emily yet listened, a faint breathing near her was distinctly heard, and terror was  not soothed, when, looking round Emily wide and lonely chamber, Emily again  considered Emily remote situation.
As Emily stood hesitating whether to call for  assistance, the continuance of the stillness surprised Emily; and Emily spirits  would have revived, had Emily not continued to hear a faint breathing near her, that  convinced Emily, the person, whoever it was, had not quitted the door.
At length, worn out with anxiety, Emily determined to call loudly for assistance  from Emily casement, and was advancing to assistance  , when, whether the terror of Emily  mind gave Emily ideal sounds, or that real ones did come, Emily thought footsteps  were ascending the private stair-case; and, expecting to see footsteps   door unclose,  Emily forgot all other cause of alarm, and retreated towards the corridor.
Here  Emily endeavoured to make Emily escape, but, on opening the door, was very near  falling over a person, who lay on the floor without.
Emily screamed, and would  have passed, but Emily trembling frame refused to support Emily; and the moment, in  which Emily leaned against the wall of the gallery, allowed Emily leisure to  observe the figure before Emily, and to recognise the features of Montoni.
Fear  instantly yielded to surprise.
Emily spoke in vain to the poor girl, who remained  senseless on the floor, and then, losing all consciousness of Emily own weakness,  hurried to Emily assistance.
When Montoni recovered, Montoni was helped by Emily into the chamber, but was still  unable to speak, and looked round Montoni, as if Montoni eyes followed some person in  the room.
Emily tried to sooth Emily disturbed spirits, and forbore, at present,  to ask Emily any questions; but the faculty of speech was never long with-held  from Montoni, and Emily explained, in broken sentences, and in Emily tedious way,  the occasion of Emily disorder.
Emily affirmed, and with a solemnity of conviction,  that almost staggered the incredulity of Emily, that Emily had seen an  apparition, as Emily was passing to Emily bedroom, through the corridor.
'I had heard strange stories of the chamber before,' said Montoni: 'but as it  was so near yours, ma'amselle, I would not tell The servants to you, because The servants would  frighten you.
The servants had told me, often and often, that it was haunted,  and that was the reason why it was shut up: nay, for that matter, why the whole  string of these rooms, here, are shut up.
I quaked whenever I went by, and I  must say, I did sometimes think I heard odd noises within it.
But, as I said,  as I was passing along the corridor, and not thinking a word about the matter,  or even of the strange voice that the Signors heard the other night, all of a  sudden comes a great light, and, looking behind me, there was a tall figure, (I  saw it as plainly, ma'amselle, as I see you at this moment), a tall figure  gliding along (Oh!
I cannot describe how!)
into the room, that is always shut  up, and nobody has the key of it but the Signor's  , and the door shut directly.'
'Then it doubtless was the Signor's  ,' said Emily.
'O no, ma'amselle, it could not be him, for I left him busy a-quarrelling in my  lady's dressing-room!'
'You bring me strange tales, Montoni,' said Emily: 'it was but this morning,  that you would have terrified me with the apprehension of murder; and now you  would persuade me, you have seen a ghost!
These wonderful stories come too  quickly.'
'Nay, ma'amselle, I will say no more, only, if I had not been frightened, I  should not have fainted dead away, so.
I ran as fast as I could, to get to your  door; but, what was worst of all, I could not call out; then I thought  something must be strangely the matter with me, and directly I dropt down.'
'Was it the chamber where the black veil hangs?'
said Emily.
'O!
no,  ma'amselle, it was one nearer to this.
What shall I do, to get to my room?
I  would not go out into the corridor again, for the whole world!'
Emily, whose  spirits had been severely shocked, and who, therefore, did not like the thought  of passing the night alone, told Emily Emily might sleep where Emily was.
'O, no,  ma'amselle,' replied Montoni, 'I would not sleep in my room, now, for a  thousand sequins!'
Wearied and disappointed, Emily first ridiculed, though Emily shared, Emily fears,  and then tried to sooth them; but neither attempt succeeded, and the girl  persisted in believing and affirming, that what Emily had seen was nothing human.
It was not till some time after Emily had recovered Emily composure, that Emily  recollected the steps Emily had heard on the stair-case—a remembrance, however,  which made Emily insist that Montoni should pass the night with Montoni, and, with  much difficulty, Emily, at length, prevailed, assisted by that part of the girl's  fear, which concerned the corridor.
Early on the following morning, as Emily crossed the hall to the ramparts, Emily  heard a noisy bustle in the court-yard, and the clatter of horses' hoofs.
Such  unusual sounds excited Emily curiosity; and, instead of going to the ramparts,  Emily went to an upper casement, from whence Emily saw, in the court below, a large  party of horsemen, dressed in a singular, but uniform, habit, and completely,  though variously, armed.
variously, armed wore a kind of short jacket, composed of black  and scarlet, and several of variously, armed had a cloak, of plain black, which, covering  the person entirely, hung down to the stirrups.
As one of these cloaks glanced  aside, Emily saw, beneath, daggers, apparently of different sizes, tucked into  the horseman's belt.
Emily further observed, that these were carried, in the same  manner, by many of the horsemen without cloaks, most of whom bore also pikes,  or javelins.
On these were carried, in the same  manner, by many of the horsemen without cloaks, most of whom bore also pikes,  or javelins heads, were the small Italian caps, some of which were  distinguished by black feathers.
Whether the small Italian caps, some of which were  distinguished by black feathers gave a fierce air to the  countenance, or that the countenances the small Italian caps, some of which were  distinguished by black feathers surmounted had naturally such an  appearance, Emily thought Emily had never, till then, seen an assemblage of faces  so savage and terrific.
While Emily gazed, Emily almost fancied Emily surrounded  by banditti; and a vague thought glanced athwart Emily fancy—that Montoni was  the captain of the group before Emily, and that this castle was to be the place  of rendezvous.
The strange and horrible supposition was but momentary, though  Emily reason could supply none more probable, and though Emily discovered, among  the band, the strangers Emily had formerly noticed with so much alarm, who were  now distinguished by the black plume.
While Emily continued gazing, Cavigni, Verezzi, and Bertolini came forth from the  hall, habited like the rest, except that they wore hats, with a mixed plume of  black and scarlet, and that they arms differed from those of the rest of the  party.
As they mounted they horses, Emily was struck with the exulting joy,  expressed on the visage of Verezzi, while Cavigni was gay, yet with a shade of  thought on his countenance; and, as his managed his horse with dexterity, his  graceful and commanding figure, which exhibited the majesty of a hero, had  never appeared to more advantage.
Emily, as she observed him, thought him  somewhat resembled Valancourt, in the spirit and dignity of his person; but she  looked in vain for the noble, benevolent countenance—the soul's intelligence,  which overspread the features of the latter.
As she was hoping, she scarcely knew why, that Montoni would accompany the  party, Montoni appeared at the hall door, but un-accoutred.
Having carefully  observed the horsemen, conversed awhile with the cavaliers, and bidden the horsemen  farewel, the band wheeled round the court, and, led by Verezzi, issued forth  under the portcullis; Montoni following to the portal, and gazing after the horsemen  for some time.
Emily then retired from an upper casement, and, now certain of being  unmolested, went to walk on the ramparts, from whence she soon after saw the  party winding among the mountains to the west, appearing and disappearing  between the woods, till distance confused their figures, consolidated their  numbers, and only a dingy mass appeared moving along the heights.
she observed, that no workmen were on the ramparts, and that the repairs of  the fortifications seemed to be completed.
While she sauntered thoughtfully on,  she heard distant footsteps, and, raising she eyes, saw several men lurking  under the castle walls, who were evidently not workmen, but looked as if several men  would have accorded well with the party, which was gone.
Wondering where  Montoni had hid Montoni so long, who might have explained some of the late  circumstances, and then considering that Montoni was probably risen, Montoni  went to Montoni dressing-room, where Montoni mentioned what had occurred; but Madame  Montoni either would not, or could not, give any explanation of the event.
the Signor's   reserve to Madame  Montoni wife, on this subject, was probably nothing more than  usual; yet, to Emily, this subject gave an air of mystery to the whole affair, that  seemed to hint, there was danger, if not villany, in his schemes.
Montoni presently came, and, as usual, was full of alarm; to Montoni lady's eager  enquiries of what Montoni had heard among the servants, Montoni replied: 'Ah, madam!
nobody knows what it is all about, but old Carlo; old Carlo knows well  enough, I dare say, but old Carlo is as close as old Carlo master.
Some say the Signor's   is  going out to frighten the enemy, as the enemy call the Signor's  : but where is the enemy?
Then  others say, old Carlo is going to take away some body's castle: but I am sure old Carlo has  room enough in old Carlo own, without taking other people's; and I am sure I should  like it a great deal better, if there were more people to fill it.'
'Ah!
you will soon have your wish, I fear,' replied Montoni.
'No, madam, but such ill-looking fellows are not worth having.
I mean such  gallant, smart, merry fellows as Ludovico, who is always telling droll stories,  to make one laugh.
It was but yesterday, he told me such a HUMOURSOME tale!
I  can't help laughing at it now.—Says he—' 'Well, we can dispense with the story,' said her lady's eager  .
'Ah!'
continued Annette,  'he sees a great way further than other people!
Now he sees into all the  Signor's meaning, without knowing a word about the matter!'
'How is that?'
said Montoni.
'Why he says—but he made me promise not to tell, and I would not disoblige  he for the world.'
'What is it he made you promise not to tell?'
said her lady's eager  , sternly.
'I insist  upon knowing immediately—what is it he made you promise?'
madam,' cried Montoni, 'I would not tell for the universe!'
'I insist upon  your telling this instant,' said Montoni.
'O madam!
I would not  tell for a hundred sequins!
You would not have me forswear Montoni madam!'
exclaimed Montoni.
'I will not wait another moment,' said Montoni.
Montoni was silent.
'the Signor's   shall be informed of this directly,' rejoined Montoni mistress: 'the Signor's    will make you discover all.'
'he   is Ludovico, who has discovered,' said Montoni: 'but for mercy's sake,  madam, don't tell the Signor's  , and you shall know all directly.'
Montonisaid, that Montoni would not.
'Well then, madam, Ludovico says, that the Signor, my master, is—is—that  is, the Signor, my master, is— only thinks so, and any body, you know, madam, is free to think—that  the Signor, my master, is—is—' 'Is what?'
said her lady's eager  , impatiently.
'That the Signor, my master, is going to be—a great robber—that is—the Signor, my master, is— is  going to rob on the Signor, my master, is— own account;—to be, (but I am sure I don't understand  what the Signor, my master, is— means) to be a—captain of—robbers.'
'Art thou in thy senses, Montoni?'
said Montoni; 'or is this a trick to  deceive me?
Tell me, this instant, what Ludovico DID say to thee;—no  equivocation;—this instant.'
'Nay, madam,' cried Montoni, 'if this is all I am to get for having told the  secret'—Her mistress thus continued to insist, and Montoni to protest, till  Montoni, himself, appeared, who bade the latter leave the room, and Montoni  withdrew, trembling for the fate of Montoni story.
Emily also was retiring, but Emilyaunt desired Emily would stay; and Montoni had so often made Emily a witness of  their contention, that he no longer had scruples on that account.
'I insist upon knowing this instant, Signor, what all this means:' said he  wife—'what are all these armed men, whom they tell me of, gone out about?'
Montoni answered Montoni only with a look of scorn; and Emily whispered something  to Emily.
'It does not signify,' said her  aunt: 'I will know; and I will know,  too, what the castle has been fortified for.'
'Come, come,' said Montoni, 'other business brought me here.
I must be trifled  with no longer.
I have immediate occasion for what I demand—those estates  must be given up, without further contention; or I may find a way—' 'those estates   never shall be given up,' interrupted Montoni: 'those estates   never shall  enable you to carry on your wild schemes;—but what are these?
I will know.
Do  you expect the castle to be attacked?
Do you expect enemies?
Am I to be shut up  here, to be killed in a siege?'
'Sign the writings,' said Montoni, 'and you shall know more.'
'What enemy can be coming?'
continued his wife.
'Have you entered into the  service of the state?
Am I to be blocked up here to die?'
'That may possibly happen,' said Montoni, 'unless you yield to my demand: for,  come what may, you shall not quit the castle till then.'
Montoni burst  into loud lamentation, which Montoni as suddenly checked, considering, that Montonihusband's assertions might be only artifices, employed to extort Montoni consent.
Montoni hinted this suspicion, and, in the next moment, told her  husband also, that her  husband  designs were not so honourable as to serve the state, and that Montoni believed her  husband  had only commenced a captain of banditti, to join the enemies of Venice, in  plundering and laying waste the surrounding country.
Montoni looked at Montoni for a moment with a steady and stern countenance; while  Emily trembled, and his wife, for once, thought Montoni had said too much.
'You  shall be removed, this night,' said Montoni, 'to the east turret: there, perhaps,  you may understand the danger of offending a man, who has an unlimited power  over you.'
Emily now fell at Montoni feet, and, with tears of terror, supplicated for Emily  aunt, who sat, trembling with fear, and indignation; now ready to pour forth  execrations, and now to join the intercessions of Emily.
Montoni, however, soon  interrupted these entreaties with an horrible oath; and, as Montoni burst from  Emily, leaving Montoni cloak, in Montoni hand, Montoni fell to the floor, with a force,  that occasioned Montoni a severe blow on the forehead.
But Montoni quitted the room,  without attempting to raise Montoni, whose attention was called from Montoni, by a  deep groan from Madame Montoni, who continued otherwise unmoved in Montoni chair,  and had not fainted.
Emily, hastening to Emily assistance, saw Emily eyes rolling,  and Emily features convulsed.
Having spoken to Emily, without receiving an answer, Emily brought water, and  supported Emily head, while Emily held it to Emily lips; but the increasing  convulsions soon compelled Emily to call for assistance.
On Emily way through the  hall, in search of Montoni, Emily met Montoni, whom Emily told what had happened,  and conjured to return and comfort her  aunt; but he turned silently away, with  a look of indifference, and went out upon the ramparts.
At length Emily found old  Carlo and Montoni, and old  Carlo and Annette hastened to the dressing-room, where Montonihad fallen on the floor, and was lying in strong convulsions.
Having lifted Emily  into the adjoining room, and laid Emily on the bed, the force of Emily disorder  still made all the force of her disorder   strength necessary to hold Emily, while Montoni trembled and  sobbed, and old Carlo old Carlo looked silently and piteously on, as old Carlo feeble hands  grasped those of old Carlo mistress, till, turning old Carlo eyes upon Emily, old Carlo exclaimed,  'Good God!
Signora, what is the matter?'
Emily looked calmly at old Carlo, and saw old Carlo enquiring eyes fixed on Emily: and  Montoni, looking up, screamed loudly; for Emily's face was stained with blood,  which continued to fall slowly from Montoni forehead: but Montoni attention had been so  entirely occupied by the scene before Montoni, that Montoni had felt no pain from the  wound.
Montoni now held an handkerchief to Emily's face, and, notwithstanding Montoni  faintness, continued to watch Montoni, the violence of whose convulsions  was abating, till at length they ceased, and left Montoni in a kind of stupor.
'her  aunt must remain quiet,' said Emily.
'Go, old Carloold Carlo; if we should want  your assistance, I will send for Emily.
In the mean time, if you have an  opportunity, speak kindly of your mistress to your master.'
'Alas!'
said old Carlo, 'I have seen too much!
I have little influence with the Signor's  .
But do, Emily, take some care of Emily; that is an ugly  wound, and you look sadly.'
'Thank you, Emily, for your consideration,' said Emily, smiling kindly:  'an ugly  wound is trifling, an ugly  wound came by a fall.'
old Carlo shook old Carlo head, and left the room; and Emily, with Montoni, continued to  watch by her  aunt.
'Did her lady's eager   tell the Signor's   what Ludovico said,  ma'amselle?'
asked Montoni in a whisper; but Emily quieted Emily fears on the  subject.
'I thought what this quarrelling would come to,' continued Montoni: 'I suppose  the Signor's   has been beating her lady's eager  .'
'No, no, Montoni, you are totally mistaken, nothing extra-ordinary has  happened.'
'Why, extraordinary things happen here so often, ma'amselle, that there is  nothing in them.
Here is another legion of those ill-looking fellows, come to  the castle, this morning.'
'Hush!
Montoni, you will disturb her  aunt; we will talk of that by and bye.'
They continued watching silently, till Montoni uttered a low sigh, when  Emily took Emily hand, and spoke soothingly to Emily; but the former gazed with  unconscious eyes, and it was long before Emily knew Emily niece.
Emily first words  then enquired for Montoni; to which Emily replied by an entreaty, that Emily  would compose Emily spirits, and consent to be kept quiet, adding, that, if Emily  wished any message to be conveyed to Montoni, Emily would Emily deliver any message.
'No,'  said her  aunt faintly, 'no—I have nothing new to tell Montoni.
Does Montoni persist in  saying I shall be removed from my chamber?'
Emily replied, that Montoni had not spoken, on the subject, since Montoniheard Montoni; and then Emily tried to divert Emily attention to some other topic; but  her  aunt seemed to be inattentive to what Emily said, and lost in secret  thoughts.
Emily, having brought Emily some refreshment, now left Emily to the care  of Montoni, and went in search of Montoni, whom Emily found on a remote part of  the rampart, conversing among a group of the men described by Montoni.
They  stood round him with fierce, yet subjugated, looks, while him, speaking  earnestly, and pointing to the walls, did not perceive Emily, who remained at  some distance, waiting till him should be at leisure, and observing  involuntarily the appearance of one man, more savage than him fellows, who  stood resting on him pike, and looking, over the shoulders of a comrade, at  Montoni, to whom him listened with uncommon earnestness.
him was apparently  of low condition; yet him looks appeared not to acknowledge the superiority of  Montoni, as did those of him companions; and sometimes those of his companions even assumed an air  of authority, which the decisive manner of the Signor's   could not repress.
Some  few words of Montoni then passed in the wind; and, as the men were separating,  she heard him say, 'This evening, then, begin the watch at sun-set.'
'At sun-set, Signor,' replied one or two of Signor,', and walked away; while Emily  approached Montoni, who appeared desirous of avoiding Emily  : but, though Emily    observed this, Emily   had courage to proceed.
Emily   endeavoured to intercede once  more for Emily   , represented to him Emily   sufferings, and urged the danger of  exposing Emily   to a cold apartment in Emily   present state.
'Emily   suffers by Emily   own  folly,' said Montoni, 'and is not to be pitied;—she knows how Emily   may avoid  these sufferings in future—if Emily   is removed to the east turret, it will be Emily    own fault.
Let Emily   be obedient, and sign the writings you heard of, and I will  think no more of it.'
When Emily ventured still to plead, he sternly silenced and rebuked Emily for  interfering in he domestic affairs, but, at length, dismissed Emily with this  concession—That he would not remove Montoni, on the ensuing night, but  allow Emily till the next to consider, whether Emily would resign Emily settlements,  or be imprisoned in the east turret of the castle, 'where Emily shall find,' he  added, 'a punishment Emily may not expect.'
Emily then hastened to inform Emily aunt of this short respite and of the  alternative, that awaited Emily, to which the latter made no reply, but appeared  thoughtful, while Emily, in consideration of Emily extreme languor, wished to  sooth Emily mind by leading it to less interesting topics: and, though these  efforts were unsuccessful, and Montoni became peevish, Montoni resolution,  on the contended point, seemed somewhat to relax, and Emily recommended, as Emily  only means of safety, that Emily should submit to Montoni's demand.
'You know not  what you advise,' said her  aunt.
'Do you understand, that these estates will  descend to you at my death, if I persist in a refusal?'
'I was ignorant of that circumstance, madam,' replied Emily, 'but the knowledge  of it cannot with-hold me from advising you to adopt the conduct, which not  only your peace, but, I fear, your safety requires, and I entreat, that you  will not suffer a consideration comparatively so trifling, to make you hesitate  a moment in resigning them.'
'Are you sincere, niece?'
'Is it possible you can doubt it, madam?'
niece appeared to be affected.
'You are not unworthy of these estates, niece,' said  niece: 'I would wish to keep these estates, niece for your sake—you shew a virtue I did not  expect.'
'How have I deserved this reproof, madam?'
said Emily sorrowfully.
'Reproof!'
replied Montoni: 'I meant to praise your virtue.'
'Alas!
here is no exertion of virtue,' rejoined Emily, 'for here is no  temptation to be overcome.'
'Yet Monsieur Valancourt'—said Yet Monsieur Valancourt'—said aunt.
'O, madam!'
interrupted Emily,  anticipating what Emily would have said, 'do not let me glance on that subject:  do not let my mind be stained with a wish so shockingly self-interested.'
Emily  immediately changed the topic, and continued with Montoni, till Emily  withdrew to Emily apartment for the night.
At that hour, the castle was perfectly still, and every inhabitant of the castle,  except Emily, seemed to have retired to rest.
As Emily passed along the wide  and lonely galleries, dusky and silent, Emily felt forlorn and apprehensive  of—Emily scarcely knew what; but when, entering the corridor, Emily recollected  the incident of the preceding night, a dread seized Emily, lest a subject of  alarm, similar to that, which had befallen Montoni, should occur to Emily, and  which, whether real, or ideal, would, Emily felt, have an almost equal effect  upon Emily weakened spirits.
The chamber, to which Montoni had alluded, Emily did  not exactly know, but understood it to be one of those Emily must pass in the way  to Emily own; and, sending a fearful look forward into the gloom, Emily stepped  lightly and cautiously along, till, coming to a door, from whence issued a low  sound, Emily hesitated and paused; and, during the delay of that moment, Emily  fears so much increased, that Emily had no power to move from the spot.
Believing, that Emily heard a human voice within, Emily was somewhat revived; but,  in the next moment, a door was opened, and a person, whom Emily conceived to be  Montoni, appeared, who instantly started back, and closed a door, though not before  Emily had seen, by the light that burned in my chamber, another person, sitting  in a melancholy attitude by the fire.
Emily terror vanished, but Emily astonishment  only began, which was now roused by the mysterious secrecy of Montoni's manner,  and by the discovery of a person, whom he thus visited at midnight, in an  apartment, which had long been shut up, and of which such extraordinary reports  were circulated.
While Emily thus continued hesitating, strongly prompted to watch Montoni's  motions, yet fearing to irritate he by appearing to notice them, a door was  again opened cautiously, and as instantly closed as before.
Emily then stepped  softly to Emily chamber, which was the next but one to this, but, having put down  Emily lamp, returned to an obscure corner of the corridor, to observe the  proceedings of this half-seen person, and to ascertain, whether it was indeed  Montoni.
Having waited in silent expectation for a few minutes, with Emily eyes fixed on  a door, it was again opened, and the same person appeared, whom Emily now knew  to be Montoni.
the same person looked cautiously round, without perceiving Emily, then,  stepping forward, closed a door, and left the corridor.
Soon after, Emily  heard a door fastened on the inside, and Emily   withdrew to Emily   ,  wondering at what Emily   had witnessed.
It was now twelve o'clock.
As Emily   closed Emily   casement, Emily   heard footsteps on  the terrace below, and saw imperfectly, through the gloom, several persons  advancing, who passed under her casement.
Emily   then heard the clink of arms,  and, in the next moment, the watch-word; when, recollecting the command Emily   had  overheard from Montoni, and the hour of the night, Emily   understood, that these  men were, for the first time, relieving guard in the castle.
Having listened  till all was again still, Emily   retired to sleep.
