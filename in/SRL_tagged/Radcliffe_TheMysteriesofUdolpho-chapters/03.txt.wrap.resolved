  I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word  Would harrow up thy soul.      SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert was interred in the neighbouring village church; SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert husband  and daughter attended SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert to the grave, followed by a long train of the  peasantry, who were sincere mourners of SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert. On SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert return from the funeral, SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert shut SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert in SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert chamber. When SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert  came forth, it was with a serene countenance, though pale in sorrow. SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert gave  orders that SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert family should attend SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert. Emily only was absent; who, overcome  with the scene SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert had just witnessed, had retired to SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert closet to weep alone.  SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert followed SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert thither: SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert took SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert hand in silence, while SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert  continued to weep; and it was some moments before SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert could so far command SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert  voice as to speak. It trembled while SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert said, 'SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert, I am going to prayers  with my family; you will join us. us must ask support from above. Where else  ought us to seek it—where else can us find it?' SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert checked SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert tears, and followed SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert father to the parlour, where, the  servants being assembled, SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert read, in a low and solemn voice, the  evening service, and added a prayer for the soul of the departed. During this,  SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert voice often faltered, her tears fell upon the book, and at length SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert  paused. But the sublime emotions of pure devotion gradually elevated SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert views  above this world, and finally brought comfort to SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert heart. When the service was ended, and the  servants were withdrawn, SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert tenderly kissed  SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert, and said, 'I have endeavoured to teach you, from your earliest youth,  the duty of self-command; I have pointed out to you the great importance of the duty of self-command  through life, not only as it preserves us in the various and dangerous  temptations that call us from rectitude and virtue, but as it limits the  indulgences which are termed virtuous, yet which, extended beyond a certain  boundary, are vicious, for their consequence is evil. All excess is vicious;  even that sorrow, which is amiable in All excess origin, becomes a selfish and unjust  passion, if indulged at the expence of our duties—by our duties I mean what  our owe to our, as well as to others. The indulgence of excessive grief  enervates the mind, and almost incapacitates The indulgence of excessive grief   for again partaking of those  various innocent enjoyments which a benevolent God designed to be the sun-shine  of our lives. My dear Emily, recollect and practise the precepts I have so  often given you, and which your own experience has so often shewn you to be  wise. 'Your sorrow is useless. Do not receive this as merely a commonplace remark,  but let reason THEREFORE restrain sorrow. I would not annihilate your feelings,  my child, I would only teach you to command them; for whatever may be the evils  resulting from a too susceptible heart, nothing can be hoped from an insensible  one; that, on the other hand, is all vice—vice, of which the deformity is not  softened, or the effect consoled for, by any semblance or possibility of good.  You know my sufferings, and are, therefore, convinced that mine are not the  light words which, on these occasions, are so often repeated to destroy even  the sources of honest emotion, or which merely display the selfish ostentation  of a false philosophy. I will shew my Emily, that I can practise what I advise.  I have said thus much, because I cannot bear to see you wasting in useless  sorrow, for want of that resistance which is due from mind; and I have not said  it till now, because there is a period when all reasoning must yield to nature;  that is past: and another, when excessive indulgence, having sunk into habit,  weighs down the elasticity of the spirits so as to render conquest nearly  impossible; this is to come. You, my Emily, will shew that you are willing to  avoid it.' my Emily smiled through my Emily tears upon my Emily father: 'Dear sir,' said my Emily, and my Emily  voice trembled; my Emily would have added, 'I will shew my Emily worthy of being your  daughter;' but a mingled emotion of gratitude, affection, and grief overcame  my Emily. St. Aubert suffered St. Aubert to weep without interruption, and then began to  talk on common topics. The first person who came to condole with St. Aubert was a M. Barreaux, an  austere and seemingly unfeeling man. A taste for botany had introduced a M. Barreaux, an  austere and seemingly unfeeling man to  each other, for a M. Barreaux, an  austere and seemingly unfeeling man had frequently met in a M. Barreaux, an  austere and seemingly unfeeling man wanderings among the  mountains. M. Barreaux had retired from the world, and almost from society, to  live in a pleasant chateau, on the skirts of the woods, near La Vallee. M. Barreaux also  had been disappointed in M. Barreaux opinion of mankind; but M. Barreaux did not, like St.  Aubert, pity and mourn for them; M. Barreaux felt more indignation at them vices, than  compassion for them weaknesses. St. Aubert St. Aubert was somewhat surprised to see M. Barreaux; for, though M. Barreaux had often pressed  M. Barreaux to come to a pleasant chateau, M. Barreaux had never till now accepted the invitation; and  now M. Barreaux came without ceremony or reserve, entering the parlour as an old friend.  The claims of misfortune appeared to have softened down all the ruggedness and  prejudices of M. Barreaux heart. St. Aubert St. Aubert unhappy, seemed to be the sole idea that  occupied St. Aubert mind. It was in manners, more than in words, that St. Aubert appeared to  sympathize with St. Aubert friends: St. Aubert spoke little on the subject of his friends grief; but  the minute attention St. Aubert gave his friends, and the modulated voice, and softened look  that accompanied the modulated voice, came from St. Aubert heart, and spoke to his friends. At this melancholy period St. Aubert was likewise visited by Madame Cheron, St. Aubert  only surviving sister, who had been some years a widow, and now resided on a widow  own estate near Tholouse. The intercourse between Madame Cheron, his  only surviving sister, who had been some years a widow, and now resided on her  own estate near Tholouse had not been very  frequent. In her condolements, words were not wanting; her understood not the  magic of the look that speaks at once to the soul, or the voice that sinks like  balm to the heart: but her assured St. Aubert that her sincerely sympathized  with St. Aubert, praised the virtues of St. Aubert late wife, and then offered what her  considered to be consolation. Emily wept unceasingly while her spoke; St. Aubert was tranquil, listened to what St. Aubert said in silence, and then turned the  discourse upon another subject. At parting St. Aubert pressed St. Aubert and St. Aubert niece to make St. Aubert an early visit. 'Change of  place will amuse you,' said St. Aubert, 'and it is wrong to give way to grief.' St.  St. Aubert acknowledged the truth of these words of course; but, at the same time,  felt more reluctant than ever to quit the spot which St. Aubert past happiness had  consecrated. The presence of his late wife had sanctified every surrounding scene,  and, each day, as it gradually softened the acuteness of St. Aubert suffering,  assisted the tender enchantment that bound St. Aubert to home. But there were calls which must be complied with, and of this kind was the  visit St. Aubert paid to St. Aubert brother-in-law M. Quesnel. An affair of an interesting  nature made it necessary that St. Aubert should delay her an early visit no longer, and,  wishing to rouse Emily from Emily dejection, St. Aubert took Emily with St. Aubert to Epourville. As the carriage entered upon the forest that adjoined St. Aubert paternal domain, St. Aubert  eyes once more caught, between the chesnut avenue, the turreted corners of the  chateau. St. Aubert sighed to think of what had passed since St. Aubert was last there, and  that it was now the property of a man who neither revered nor valued it. At  length St. Aubert entered the avenue, whose lofty trees had so often delighted St. Aubert when  a boy, and whose melancholy shade was now so congenial with the tone of St. Aubert  spirits. Every feature of the edifice, distinguished by an air of heavy  grandeur, appeared successively between the branches of the trees—the broad  turret, the arched gate-way that led into the courts, the drawbridge, and the  dry fosse which surrounded the whole. The sound of carriage wheels brought a troop of servants to the great gate,  where St. Aubert alighted, and from which St. Aubert led Emily into the gothic hall,  now no longer hung with the arms and ancient banners of the family. the arms and ancient banners of the family were  displaced, and the oak wainscotting, and beams that crossed the roof, were  painted white. The large table, too, that used to stretch along the upper end  of the hall, where the master of the mansion loved to display the master of the mansion hospitality,  and whence the peal of laughter, and the song of conviviality, had so often  resounded, was now removed; even the benches that had surrounded the gothic hall were  no longer there. The heavy walls were hung with frivolous ornaments, and every  thing that appeared denoted the false taste and corrupted sentiments of the  present owner. SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert St. Aubert followed a gay Parisian servant to a parlour, where sat Mons. and  Madame Quesnel, who received a gay Parisian servant with a stately politeness, and, after a few  formal words of condolement, seemed to have forgotten that they ever had a  sister. Emily felt tears swell into Emily eyes, and then resentment checked they. St.  Aubert, calm and deliberate, preserved his dignity without assuming importance,  and Quesnel was depressed by his without exactly knowing wherefore. After some general conversation, SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert requested to speak with SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert alone;  and Emily, being left with Quesnel, soon learned that a large party was  invited to dine at a pleasant chateau, and was compelled to hear that nothing which  was past and irremediable ought to prevent the festivity of the present hour. St. Aubert, when SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert was told that company were expected, felt a mixed emotion  of disgust and indignation against the insensibility of Quesnel, which prompted  SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert to return home immediately. But SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert was informed, that Madame Cheron had  been asked to meet SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert; and, when SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert looked at Emily, and considered that a  time might come when the enmity of Emily uncle would be prejudicial to Emily, her uncle  determined not to incur it her uncle, by conduct which would be resented as  indecorous, by the very persons who now showed so little sense of decorum. Among the visitors assembled at dinner were two Italian gentlemen, of whom one  was named Montoni, a distant relation of Quesnel, a man about forty, of  an uncommonly handsome person, with features manly and expressive, but whose  countenance exhibited, upon the whole, more of the haughtiness of command, and  the quickness of discernment, than of any other character. Signor Cavigni, Signor Cavigni friend, appeared to be about thirty—inferior in dignity,  but equal to Signor Cavigni in penetration of countenance, and superior in insinuation of  manner. Emily was shocked by the salutation with which Madame Cheron met Emily  father—'Dear brother,' said Emily, 'I am concerned to see you look so very ill;  do, pray, have advice!' St. Aubert answered, with a melancholy smile, that St. Aubert  felt St. Aubert much as usual; but Emily's fears made Emily now fancy that Emily looked worse than St. Aubert really did. Emily would have been amused by the new characters Emily saw, and the varied  conversation that passed during dinner, which was served in a style of  splendour Emily had seldom seen before, had Emily spirits been less oppressed. Of  the guests, Signor Montoni was lately come from Italy, and Signor Montoni spoke of the  commotions which at that period agitated the country; talked of party  differences with warmth, and then lamented the probable consequences of the  tumults. Signor Montoni friend spoke with equal ardour, of the politics of His friend ;  praised the government and prosperity of Venice, and boasted of the country decided  superiority over all the other Italian states. Signor Montoni then turned to the ladies,  and talked with the same eloquence, of Parisian fashions, the French opera, and  French manners; and on the latter subject Signor Montoni did not fail to mingle what is so  particularly agreeable to French taste. The flattery was not detected by those  to whom The flattery was addressed, though The flattery effect, in producing submissive attention,  did not escape his observation. When his could disengage his from the  assiduities of the other ladies, his sometimes addressed Emily: but Emily knew  nothing of Parisian fashions, or Parisian operas; and Emily modesty, simplicity,  and correct manners formed a decided contrast to those of Emily female companions. After dinner, St. Aubert stole from the room to view once more the old chesnut  which Quesnel talked of cutting down. As his stood under its shade, and looked  up among its branches, still luxuriant, and saw here and there the blue sky  trembling between them; the pursuits and events of his early days crowded fast  to his mind, with the figures and characters of friends—long since gone from  the earth; and his now felt his to be almost an insulated being, with nobody  but his Emily for his heart to turn to. his stood lost amid the scenes of years which fancy called up, till the  succession closed with the picture of his dying wife, and his started away, to  forget it, if possible, at the social board. St. Aubert St. Aubert ordered St. Aubert carriage at an early hour, and Emily observed, that St. Aubert  was more than usually silent and dejected on the way home; but Emily considered  this to be the effect of St. Aubert visit to a place which spoke so eloquently of  former times, nor suspected that St. Aubert had a cause of grief which St. Aubert concealed  from Emily. On entering a pleasant chateau Emily felt more depressed than ever, for Emily more than  ever missed the presence of that dear parent, who, whenever Emily had been from  home, used to welcome Emily return with smiles and fondness; now, all was silent  and forsaken. But what reason and effort may fail to do, time effects. Week after week passed  away, and each, as it passed, stole something from the harshness of Emily  affliction, till it was mellowed to that tenderness which the feeling heart  cherishes as sacred. SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert, on the contrary, visibly declined in health;  though Emily, who had been so constantly with SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert, was almost the last person  who observed it. SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert constitution had never recovered from the late attack of  the fever, and the succeeding shock His constitution received from SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert death  had produced His constitution present infirmity. SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert physician now ordered SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert to travel;  for it was perceptible that sorrow had seized upon SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert nerves, weakened as they  had been by the preceding illness; and variety of scene, it was probable,  would, by amusing His physician mind, restore they  had been by the preceding illness; and variety of scene, it was probable,   to they  had been by the preceding illness; and variety of scene, it was probable,   proper tone. For some days Emily was occupied in preparations to attend His physician; and His physician, by  endeavours to diminish His physician expences at home during the journey—a purpose  which determined His physician at length to dismiss His physician domestics. Emily seldom opposed  Emily father's wishes by questions or remonstrances, or Emily would now have asked  why His physician did not take a servant, and have represented that His physician infirm health made  one almost necessary. But when, on the eve of their departure, Emily found that  His physician had dismissed Jacques, Francis, and Mary, and detained only Theresa the old  housekeeper, Emily was extremely surprised, and ventured to ask His physician reason for  having done so. 'To save expences, my dear,' His physician replied—'we are going on an  expensive excursion.' His physician had prescribed the air of Languedoc and Provence; and St. Aubert  determined, therefore, to travel leisurely along the shores of the  Mediterranean, towards Provence. They retired early to They chamber on the night before They departure; but  Emily had a few books and other things to collect, and the clock had struck  twelve before Emily had finished, or had remembered that some of Emily drawing  instruments, which Emily meant to take with Emily, were in the parlour below. As  Emily went to fetch some of her drawing  instruments, which she meant to take with her, were in the parlour below, Emily passed Emily father's room, and, perceiving the door  half open, concluded that her father was in her father study—for, since the death of Madame  SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert, it had been frequently her father custom to rise from her father restless bed,  and go thither to compose her father . When Emily was below stairs Emily looked into  her father's room, but without finding her father; and as Emily returned to Emily chamber, Emily  tapped at the door  , and receiving no answer, stepped softly in, to be certain  whether her father was there.  this room was dark, but a light glimmered through some panes of glass that were  placed in the upper part of a closet-door. Emily believed her father to be in  the closet, and, surprised that her father was up at so late an hour, apprehended her father  was unwell, and was going to enquire; but, considering that Emily sudden  appearance at this hour might alarm her father, Emily removed a light to the  stair-case, and then stepped softly to  the closet. On looking through the panes  of glass, Emily saw her father seated at a small table, with papers before her father, some of  which her father was reading with deep attention and interest, during which her father often  wept and sobbed aloud. Emily, who had come to the door   to learn whether her father was ill, was now detained there by a mixture of curiosity and  tenderness. Emily could not witness her father sorrow, without being anxious to know the  subject of; and Emily therefore continued to observe her father in silence, concluding  that those papers were letters of Emily late mother. Presently her father knelt down, and  with a look so solemn as Emily had seldom seen her father assume, and which was mingled  with a certain wild expression, that partook more of horror than of any other  character, her father prayed silently for a considerable time. When her father rose, a ghastly paleness was on her father countenance. Emily was hastily  retiring; but Emily saw her father turn again to those papers, and Emily stopped. her father took  from among them a small case, and from thence a miniature picture. The rays of  light fell strongly upon The rays of  light, and Emily perceived The rays of  light to be that of a lady, but not  of her late mother. St. Aubert gazed earnestly and tenderly upon St. Aubert portrait, put his portrait to St. Aubert lips,  and then to St. Aubert heart, and sighed with a convulsive force. Emily could scarcely  believe what Emily saw to be real. Emily never knew till now that St. Aubert had a picture  of any other lady than her late mother, much less that St. Aubert had one which St. Aubert evidently  valued so highly; but having looked repeatedly, to be certain that it was not  the resemblance of SHAKESPEARE Madame St. Aubert, Emily became entirely convinced that it was not  the resemblance of Madame St. Aubert was  designed for that of some other person. At length St. Aubert returned the picture to St. Aubert case; and Emily, recollecting  that Emily was intruding upon his private sorrows, softly withdrew from their chamber.
