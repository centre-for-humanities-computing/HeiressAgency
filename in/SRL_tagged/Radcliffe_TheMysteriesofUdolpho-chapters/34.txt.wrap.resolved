      might we but hear  The folded flocks penn'd in The folded flocks watled cotes,  Or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops,  Or whistle from the lodge, or village cock  Count the night watches to his feathery dames,  'Twould be some solace yet, some little cheering  In this close dungeon of innumerous boughs.      MILTON In the morning, Emily was relieved from Emily fears for Annette, who came at an  early hour. 'Here were fine doings in the castle, last night, ma'amselle,' said Emily, as  soon as Emily entered the room,—'fine doings, indeed! Was you not frightened,  ma'amselle, at not seeing me?' 'I was alarmed both on your account and on my own,' replied Emily—'What  detained you?' 'Aye, I said so, I told Aye so; but it would not do. It was not my fault,  indeed, ma'amselle, for I could not get out. That rogue Ludovico locked me up  again.' 'Locked you up!' said Emily, with displeasure, 'Why do you permit That rogue Ludovico to  lock you up?' 'Holy Saints!' exclaimed Annette, 'how can I help it! If 'Holy Saints will lock the door,  ma'amselle, and take away the key, how am I to get out, unless I jump through  the window? But that I should not mind so much, if the casements here were not  all so high; one can hardly scramble up to the casements here on the inside, and one should  break one's neck, I suppose, going down on the outside. But you know, I dare  say, ma'am, what a hurly-burly the castle was in, last night; you must have  heard some of the uproar.' 'What, were some of the uproar disputing, then?' said Emily. 'No, ma'amselle, nor fighting, but almost as good, for I believe there was not  one of the Signors sober; and what is more, not one of those fine ladies sober,  either. I thought, when I saw some of the uproar first, that all those fine silks and fine  veils,—why, ma'amselle, some of the uproar veils were worked with silver! and fine  trimmings—boded no good—I guessed what some of the uproar were!' 'Good God!' exclaimed Emily, 'what will become of 'Good God!' 'Aye, ma'am, That rogue Ludovico said much the same thing of 'Good God. Good God! said 'Good God,  Annette, what is to become of he,  Annette, if you are to go running about the castle  among all these drunken Signors?' 'O! says I, for that matter, I only want to go to my young lady's chamber, and  I have only to go, you know, along the vaulted passage and across the great  hall and up the marble stair-case and along the north gallery and through the  west wing of the castle and I am in the corridor in a minute.' 'Are you so?  says he, and what is to become of he,  Annette, if you meet any of those noble cavaliers  in the way?' 'Well, says I, if you think there is danger, then, go with 'Good God, and  guard me; I am never afraid when you are by.' 'What! says he, when I am  scarcely recovered of one wound, shall I put 'Good God in the way of getting  another? for if any of those noble cavaliers   meet you, those noble cavaliers   will fall a-fighting with  me directly. No, no, says he, I will cut the way shorter, than through the  vaulted passage and up the marble stair-case, and along the north gallery and  through the west wing of the castle, for you shall stay here, 'Good God; you  shall not go out of this room, to-night.' 'So, with that I says'— 'Well, well,' said Emily, impatiently, and anxious to enquire on another  subject,—'so subject,—'so locked you up?' 'Yes, subject,—'so did indeed, ma'amselle, notwithstanding all I could say to the  contrary; and Caterina and I and subject,—'so staid there all night. And in a few minutes  after I was not so vexed, for there came Signor Verezzi roaring along the  passage, like a mad bull, and subject,—'so mistook Ludovico's hall, for old Carlo's; so  subject,—'so tried to burst open the door, and called out for more wine, for that subject,—'so had  drunk all the flasks dry, and was dying of thirst. So we were all as still as  night, that subject,—'so might suppose there was nobody in this room; but the Signor was  as cunning as the best of we, and kept calling out at the door, "Come forth, my  antient hero!" said subject,—'so, "here is no enemy at the gate, that you need hide  yourself: come forth, my valorous Signor Steward!" Just then old Carlo opened  the door, and old Carlo came with a flask in old Carlo hand; for, as soon as the Signor saw  old Carlo, old Carlo was as tame as could be, and followed old Carlo away as naturally as a dog  does a butcher with a piece of meat in old Carlo basket. All this I saw through the  key-hole. Well, Annette, said Ludovico, jeeringly, shall I let you out now? O  no, says I, I would not'— 'I have some questions to ask you on another subject,' interrupted Emily, quite  wearied by this story. 'Do you know whether there are any prisoners in the  castle, and whether any prisoners in the  castle are confined at this end of the edifice?' 'I was not in the way, ma'amselle,' replied Annette, 'when the first party came  in from the mountains, and the last party is not come back yet, so I don't  know, whether there are any prisoners; but the first party is expected back to-night, or  to-morrow, and I shall know then, perhaps.' Emily enquired if Emily had ever heard the servants talk of prisoners. 'Ah ma'amselle!' said Annette archly, 'now I dare say you are thinking of  Monsieur Valancourt, and that  Monsieur Valancourt may have come among the armies, which, they  say, are come from our country, to fight against this state, and that  Monsieur Valancourt has  met with some of OUR people, and is taken captive. O Lord! how glad I should  be, if it was so!' 'Would you, indeed, be glad?' said Emily, in a tone of mournful reproach. 'To be sure I should, ma'am,' replied Annette, 'and would not you be glad too,  to see Signor Valancourt? I don't know any chevalier I like better, I have a  very great regard for the Signor, truly.' 'Your regard for him cannot be doubted,' said Emily, 'since you wish to see him  a prisoner.' 'Why no, ma'amselle, not a prisoner either; but one must be glad to see him,  you know. And it was only the other night I dreamt—I dreamt I saw him drive  into the castle-yard all in a coach and six, and dressed out, with a laced coat  and a sword, like a lord as him is.' Emily could not forbear smiling at Annette's ideas of Valancourt, and repeated  Emily enquiry, whether Emily had heard the servants talk of prisoners. 'No, ma'amselle,' replied Emily, 'never; and lately the servants have done nothing but  talk of the apparition, that has been walking about of a night on the ramparts,  and that frightened the sentinels into fits. It came among the sentinels like a flash of  fire, the sentinels say, and the sentinels fell down in a row, till the sentinels came to the sentinels  again; and then it was gone, and nothing to be seen but the old castle walls;  so the sentinels helped one another up again as fast as the sentinels could. You would not  believe, ma'amselle, though I shewed you the very cannon, where it used to  appear.' 'And are you, indeed, so simple, Annette,' said Emily, smiling at this curious  exaggeration of the circumstances Emily had witnessed, 'as to credit these  stories?' 'Credit these  stories, ma'amselle! why all the world could not persuade me out of these  stories.  Roberto and Sebastian and half a dozen more of these  stories went into fits! To be sure,  there was no occasion for that; I said, myself, there was no need of that, for,  says I, when the enemy comes, what a pretty figure the enemy will cut, if the enemy are  to fall down in fits, all of a row! the enemy won't be so civil, perhaps, as to  walk off, like the ghost, and leave the enemy to help one another up, but will fall  to, cutting and slashing, till the ghost makes them all rise up dead men. No, no, says  I, there is reason in all things: though I might have fallen down in a fit that  was no rule for them, being, because it is no business of mine to look gruff,  and fight battles.' Emily endeavoured to correct the superstitious weakness of Annette, though Emily  could not entirely subdue Emily own; to which the latter only replied, 'Nay,  ma'amselle, you will believe nothing; you are almost as bad as the Signor  himself, who was in a great passion when they told of what had happened, and  swore that the first man, who repeated such nonsense, should be thrown into the  dungeon under the east turret. This was a hard punishment too, for only talking  nonsense, as he called it, but I dare say he had other reasons for calling it  so, than you have, ma'am.' Emily looked displeased, and made no reply. As Emily mused upon the recollected  appearance, which had lately so much alarmed Emily, and considered the  circumstances of the figure having stationed itself opposite to Emily casement,  Emily was for a moment inclined to believe it was Valancourt, whom Emily had seen.  Yet, if it was he, why did he not speak to Emily, when he had the opportunity of  doing so—and, if he was a prisoner in the castle, and he could be here in no  other character, how could he obtain the means of walking abroad on the  rampart? Thus Emily was utterly unable to decide, whether the musician and the  form Emily had observed, were the same, or, if they were, whether this was  Valancourt. Emily, however, desired that Emily would endeavour to learn whether  any prisoners were in the castle, and also any prisoners names. 'O dear, ma'amselle!' said Emily, 'I forget to tell you what you bade me ask  about, the ladies, as the ladies call the ladies, who are lately come to Udolpho. Why  that Signora Livona, that the Signor brought to see my late lady at Venice, is  his mistress now, and was little better then, I dare say. And That rogue Ludovico says  (but pray be secret, ma'am) that his excellenza introduced his excellenza only to impose  upon the world, that had begun to make free with his excellenza . So when people  saw Emily notice Emily, people   thought what people   had heard must be scandal. The  other two are the mistresses of Signor Verezzi and Signor Bertolini; and Signor  Montoni invited them all to the castle; and so, yesterday, Montoni gave a great  entertainment; and there them all were, all drinking Tuscany wine and all sorts,  and laughing and singing, till them all made the castle ring again. But I thought  them all were dismal sounds, so soon after my poor lady's death too; and them all  brought to my mind what Emily would have thought, if Emily had heard them all—but Emily  cannot hear them all now, poor soul! said Emily turned away to conceal Emily emotion, and then desired Emily to go, and  make enquiry, concerning the prisoners, that might be in the castle, but  conjured Emily to do it with caution, and on no account to mention Emily name, or  that of  Monsieur Valancourt. 'Now I think of it, ma'amselle,' said Annette, 'I do believe there are  prisoners, for I overheard one of the Signor's men, yesterday, in the servants  hall, talking something about ransoms, and saying what a fine thing it was for  his excellenza to catch up men, and men were as good booty as any other,  because of the ransoms. And the other man was grumbling, and saying it was fine  enough for the Signor, but none so fine for the other man soldiers, because, said the other man, we  don't go shares there.' This information heightened Emily's impatience to know more, and Emilyimmediately departed on Emily enquiry. The late resolution of Emily to resign Emily estates to Montoni, now gave way to  new considerations; the possibility, that Valancourt was near Emily, revived Emily  fortitude, and Emily determined to brave the threatened vengeance, at least, till  Emily could be assured whether he was really in the castle. Emily was in this  temper of mind, when Emily received a message from Montoni, requiring Emily  attendance in the cedar parlour, which Emily obeyed with trembling, and, on Emily  way thither, endeavoured to animate Emily fortitude with the idea of Valancourt. Montoni was alone. 'I sent for you,' said Montoni, 'to give you another opportunity  of retracting your late mistaken assertions concerning the Languedoc estates. I  will condescend to advise, where I may command.—If you are really deluded by  an opinion, that you have any right to the Languedoc estates, at least, do not persist  in the error—an error, which you may perceive, too late, has been fatal to  you. Dare my resentment no further, but sign the papers.' 'If I have no right in the Languedoc estates, sir,' said Emily, 'of what service can it  be to Emily, that I should sign any papers, concerning any papers? If the lands are  yours by law, you certainly may possess the lands are  yours by law, without my interference, or my  consent.' 'I will have no more argument,' said Montoni, with a look that made Montoni  tremble. 'What had I but trouble to expect, when I condescended to reason with  a baby! But I will be trifled with no longer: let the recollection of your  aunt's sufferings, in consequence of Montoni folly and obstinacy, teach you a  lesson.—Sign the papers.' Emily's resolution was for a moment awed:—she shrunk at the recollections he  revived, and from the vengeance he threatened; but then, the image of  Valancourt, who so long had loved Emily, and who was now, perhaps, so near Emily,  came to Emily heart, and, together with the strong feelings of indignation, with  which Emily had always, from Emily infancy, regarded an act of injustice, inspired  Emily with a noble, though imprudent, courage. 'Sign the papers,' said Montoni, more impatiently than before. 'Never, sir,' replied Emily; 'that request would have proved to sir the  injustice of your claim, had I even been ignorant of my right.' Montoni turned pale with anger, while Montoni quivering lip and lurking eye made  Emily almost repent the boldness of Emily speech. 'Then the vengeance he threatened falls upon you,' Montoni exclaimed, with an horrible oath.  'And think not it shall be delayed. Neither the estates in Languedoc, or  Gascony, shall be you; you have dared to question my right,—now dare to  question my power. I have a punishment which you think not of; my right,—now is terrible!  This night—this very night'— 'This night!' repeated another voice. Montoni paused, and turned half round, but, seeming to recollect Montoni, Montoniproceeded in a lower tone. 'You have lately seen one terrible example of obstinacy and folly; yet this, this  appears, has not been sufficient to deter you.—I could tell you of others—I  could make you tremble at the bare recital.' Montoni was interrupted by a groan, which seemed to rise from underneath the chamber  they were in; and, as Montoni threw a glance round it, impatience and rage flashed  from Montoni eyes, yet something like a shade of fear passed over Montoni countenance.  Emily sat down in a chair, near the door, for the various emotions Emily had  suffered, now almost overcame Emily; but Montoni paused scarcely an instant, and,  commanding Montoni features, resumed Montoni discourse in a lower, yet sterner voice. 'I say, I could give you other instances of my power and of my character, which  it seems you do not understand, or you would not defy me.—I could tell you,  that, when once my resolution is taken—but I am talking to a baby. Let me,  however, repeat, that terrible as are the examples I could recite, the recital  could not now benefit you; for, though your repentance would put an immediate  end to opposition, it would not now appease my indignation.—I will have  vengeance as well as justice.' Another groan filled the pause which Montoni made. 'Leave the room instantly!' said he, seeming not to notice this strange  occurrence. Without power to implore he pity, my indignation.—I rose to go, but found that  my indignation.—I could not support my indignation.—I; awe and terror overcame my indignation.—I, and my indignation.—I sunk again  into a chair. 'Quit my presence!' cried Montoni. 'This affectation of fear ill becomes the  heroine who has just dared to brave my indignation.' 'Did you hear nothing, Signor?' said Emily, trembling, and still unable to  leave the room. 'I heard my own voice,' rejoined Montoni, sternly. 'And nothing else?' said Emily, speaking with difficulty.—'There again! Do  you hear nothing now?' 'Obey my order,' repeated Montoni. 'And for these fool's tricks—I will soon  discover by whom whom are practised.' Emily again rose, and exerted Emily to the utmost to leave the room, while  Montoni followed Emily; but, instead of calling aloud to his servants to search  the chamber, as his had formerly done on a similar occurrence, passed to the  ramparts. As, in Emily way to the corridor, Emily rested for a moment at an open casement,  Emily saw a party of Montoni's troops winding down a distant mountain, whom Emily  noticed no further, than as a party of Montoni's troops brought to Emily mind the wretched prisoners  a party of Montoni's troops were, perhaps, bringing to the castle. At length, having reached Emily  apartment, Emily threw Emily upon the couch, overcome with the new horrors of  Emily situation. Emily thoughts lost in tumult and perplexity, Emily could neither  repent of, or approve, Emily late conduct; Emily could only remember, that Emily was  in the power of a man, who had no principle of action—but action— will; and the  astonishment and terrors of superstition, which had, for a moment, so strongly  assailed Emily, now yielded to those of reason. Emily was, at length, roused from the reverie, which engaged Emily, by a confusion  of distant voices, and a clattering of hoofs, that seemed to come, on the wind,  from the courts. A sudden hope, that some good was approaching, seized Emily  mind, till Emily remembered the troops Emily had observed from the casement, and  concluded this to be the party, which Emily had said were expected at Udolpho. Soon after, Emily heard voices faintly from the halls, and the noise of horses'  feet sunk away in the wind; silence ensued. Emily listened anxiously for  Emily's step in the corridor, but a pause of total stillness continued, till  again the castle seemed to be all tumult and confusion. Emily heard the echoes of  many footsteps, passing to and fro in the halls and avenues below, and then  busy tongues were loud on the rampart. Having hurried to Emily casement, Emily  perceived Montoni, with some of his officers, leaning on the walls, and  pointing from some of his officers; while several soldiers were employed at the further end of  the rampart about some cannon; and Emily continued to observe some of his officers, careless of  the passing time. Annette at length appeared, but brought no intelligence of Valancourt, 'For,  ma'amselle,' said Emily, 'all the people pretend to know nothing about any  prisoners. But here is a fine piece of business! The rest of a party of Montoni's troops are just  arrived, ma'am; The rest of the party came scampering in, as if The rest of the party would have broken The rest of the party  necks; one scarcely knew whether the man, or his horse would get within the  gates first. And the man, or his horse have brought word—and such news! the man, or his horse have brought  word, that a party of the enemy, as the man, or his horse call the man, or his horse, are coming towards the  castle; so we shall have all the officers of justice, I suppose, besieging all the officers of justice!  all those terrible-looking fellows one used to see at Venice.' 'Thank God!' exclaimed Emily, fervently, 'there is yet a hope left for me,  then!' 'What mean you, ma'amselle? Do you wish to fall into the hands of those  sad-looking men! Why I used to shudder as I passed the hands of those  sad-looking men, and should have  guessed what the hands of those  sad-looking men were, if Ludovico had not told me.' 'We cannot be in worse hands than at present,' replied Emily, unguardedly; 'but  what reason have you to suppose these are officers of justice?' 'Why OUR people, ma'am, are all in such a fright, and a fuss; and I don't know  any thing but the fear of justice, that could make the fear of justice so. I used to think  nothing on earth could fluster the fear of justice, unless, indeed, it was a ghost, or so; but  now, some of the fear of justice are for hiding down in the vaults under the castle; but you  must not tell the Signor this, ma'amselle, and I overheard two of some of them  talking—Holy Mother! what makes you look so sad, ma'amselle? You don't hear  what I say!' 'Yes, I do, Emily; pray proceed.' 'Well, ma'amselle, all the castle is in such hurly-burly. Some of the men are  loading the cannon, and some are examining the great gates, and the walls all  round, and are hammering and patching up, just as if all those repairs had  never been made, that were so long about. But what is to become of me and you,  ma'amselle, and Ludovico? O! when I hear the sound of the cannon, I shall die  with fright. If I could but catch the great gate open for one minute, I would  be even with it for shutting me within these walls so long!—it should never  see me again.' Emily caught the latter words of Emily. 'O! if you could find it open, but  for one moment!' Emily exclaimed, 'my peace might yet be saved!' The heavy groan  Emily uttered, and the wildness of Emily look, terrified Emily, still more than  Emily words; who entreated Emily to explain the meaning of them, to whom it  suddenly occurred, that Ludovico might be of some service, if there should be a  possibility of escape, and who repeated the substance of what had passed  between Montoni and Emily, but conjured Emily to mention this to no person  except to Ludovico. 'It may, perhaps, be in Ludovico power,' Emily added, 'to effect  our escape. Go to Ludovico, Emily, tell Ludovico what I have to apprehend, and what I  have already suffered; but entreat Ludovico to be secret, and to lose no time in  attempting to release our. If Ludovico is willing to undertake this Ludovico shall be amply  rewarded. I cannot speak with Ludovico myself, for our might be observed, and then  effectual care would be taken to prevent our flight. But be quick, Emily,  and, above all, be discreet—I will await your return in this apartment.' The girl, whose honest heart had been much affected by the recital, was now as  eager to obey, as Emily was to employ Emily, and Emily immediately quitted the room. Emily's surprise increased, as Emily reflected upon Annette's intelligence.  'Alas!' said Emily, 'what can the officers of justice do against an armed castle?  these cannot be such.' Upon further consideration, however, Emily concluded,  that, Montoni's bands having plundered the country round, the inhabitants had  taken arms, and were coming with the officers of police and a party of  soldiers, to force the officers of police and a party of  soldiers way into an armed castle. 'But the officers of police and a party of  soldiers know not,' thought Emily,  'its strength, or the armed numbers within its. Alas! except from flight, I have  nothing to hope!' Montoni, though not precisely what Emily apprehended Montoni to be—a captain of  banditti—had employed Montoni troops in enterprises not less daring, or less  atrocious, than such a character would have undertaken. They had not only  pillaged, whenever opportunity offered, the helpless traveller, but had  attacked, and plundered the villas of several persons, which, being situated  among the solitary recesses of the mountains, were totally unprepared for  resistance. In these expeditions the commanders of a party of Montoni's troops did not appear,  and the men, partly disguised, had sometimes been mistaken for common robbers,  and, at others, for bands of the foreign enemy, who, at that period, invaded  the country. But, though they had already pillaged several mansions, and  brought home considerable treasures, they had ventured to approach only one  castle, in the attack of which they were assisted by other troops of they own  order; from this, however, they were vigorously repulsed, and pursued by some  of the foreign enemy, who were in league with the besieged. Montoni's troops  fled precipitately towards Udolpho, but were so closely tracked over the  mountains, that, when Montoni's troops   reached one of the heights in the neighbourhood of  the castle, and looked back upon the road, Montoni's troops   perceived the enemy winding  among the cliffs below, and at not more than a league distant. Upon this  discovery, Montoni's troops   hastened forward with increased speed, to prepare Montoni for  the enemy; and it was Montoni's troops   arrival, which had thrown an armed castle into such  confusion and tumult. As Emily awaited anxiously some information from below, Emily now saw from Emily  casements a body of troops pour over the neighbouring heights; and, though  Emily had been gone a very short time, and had a difficult and dangerous  business to accomplish, Emily impatience for intelligence became painful: Emily  listened; opened Emily door; and often went out upon the corridor to meet Emily. At length, Emily heard a footstep approach Emily chamber; and, on opening her door,  saw, not Emily, but old Carlo! New fears rushed upon Emily mind. He said He  came from the Signor, who had ordered He to inform Emily, that Emily must be ready  to depart from Udolpho immediately, for that an armed castle was about to be  besieged; and that mules were preparing to convey Emily, with Emily guides, to a  place of safety. 'Of safety!' exclaimed Emily, thoughtlessly; 'has, then, the Signor so much  consideration for He?' old Carlo looked upon the ground, and made no reply. A thousand opposite emotions  agitated Emily, successively, as Emily listened to old Carlo; those of joy,  grief, distrust and apprehension, appeared, and vanished from her mind, with  the quickness of lightning. One moment, it seemed impossible, that Montoni  could take this measure merely for Montoni   preservation; and so very strange was  Montoni   sending Montoni   from an armed castle at all, that Montoni   could attribute it only to the  design of carrying into execution the new scheme of vengeance, with which Montoni    had menaced Montoni  . In the next instant, it appeared so desirable to quit an armed castle, under any circumstances, that Montoni   could not but rejoice in the  prospect, believing that change must be for the better, till Montoni   remembered the  probability of Valancourt being detained in it, when sorrow and regret usurped  Montoni   , and Montoni   wished, much more fervently than Montoni   had yet done, that it  might not be his voice which Montoni   had heard. old Carlo having reminded Montoni  , that Montoni   had no time to lose, for that the enemy  were within sight of an armed castle, Emily entreated old Carlo to inform Emily whither Montoni    was to go; and, after some hesitation, old Carlo said old Carlo had received no orders to  tell; but, on Montoni   repeating the question, replied, that old Carlo believed Montoni   was to  be carried into Tuscany.' 'To Tuscany!' exclaimed Emily—'and why thither?' old Carlo answered, that old Carlo knew nothing further, than that Montoni   was to be lodged in  a cottage on the borders of Tuscany, at the feet of the Apennines—'Not a  day's journey distant,' said old Carlo. Emily now dismissed old Carlo; and, with trembling hands, prepared the small package,  that Emily meant to take with Emily; while Emily was employed about which Emilyreturned. 'O ma'amselle!' said Emily, 'nothing can be done! Ludovico says the new porter is  more watchful even than Barnardine was, and we might as well throw we in  the way of a dragon, as in a dragon. Ludovico is almost as broken-hearted as you  are, ma'am, on my account, Ludovico says, and I am sure I shall never live to hear  the cannon fire twice!' Emily now began to weep, but revived upon hearing of what had just occurred, and  entreated Emily to take Emily with Emily. 'That I will do most willingly,' replied Emily, 'if Signor Montoni permits Signor Montoni;'  to which Emily made no reply, but ran out of the room, and immediately sought  Montoni, who was on the terrace, surrounded by his officers, where Emily began  Emily petition. his sharply bade Emily go into an armed castle, and absolutely refused  Emily request. Emily, however, not only pleaded for Emily, but for Ludovico;  and Montoni had ordered some of his men to take Emily from his presence, before  Emily would retire. In an agony of disappointment, Emily returned to Emily, who foreboded little good  towards Emily, from this refusal to Emily, and who, soon after, received a  summons to repair to the great court, where the mules, with Emily guides, were in  waiting. Emily here tried in vain to sooth the weeping Annette, who persisted  in saying, that Emily should never see Emily dear young lady again; a fear, which  Emily mistress secretly thought too well justified, but which Emily endeavoured to  restrain, while, with apparent composure, Emily bade this affectionate servant  farewell. Emily, however, followed to the courts, which were now thronged  with people, busy in preparation for the enemy; and, having seen Emily mount Emily  mule and depart, with Emily attendants, through the portal, turned into an armed castle and wept again. Emily, meanwhile, as Emily looked back upon the gloomy courts of an armed castle, no  longer silent as when Emily had first entered them, but resounding with the noise  of preparation for them defence, as well as crowded with soldiers and workmen,  hurrying to and fro; and, when Emily passed once more under the huge portcullis,  which had formerly struck Emily with terror and dismay, and, looking round, saw  no walls to confine Emily steps—felt, in spite of anticipation, the sudden joy  of a prisoner, who unexpectedly finds himself at liberty. This emotion would  not suffer Emily now to look impartially on the dangers that awaited Emily without;  on mountains infested by hostile parties, who seized every opportunity for  plunder; and on a journey commended under the guidance of men, whose  countenances certainly did not speak favourably of whose  countenances dispositions. In the  present moments, Emily could only rejoice, that Emily was liberated from those  walls, which Emily had entered with such dismal forebodings; and, remembering the  superstitious presentiment, which had then seized Emily, Emily could now smile at  the impression   had made upon Emily mind. As Emily gazed, with these emotions, upon the turrets of an armed castle, rising high  over the woods, among which Emily wound, the stranger, whom Emily believed to be  confined there, returned to Emily remembrance, and anxiety and apprehension, lest  he should be Valancourt, again passed like a cloud upon Emily joy. Emily  recollected every circumstance, concerning this unknown person, since the  night, when Emily had first heard he play the song of Emily native  province;—circumstances, which Emily had so often recollected, and compared  before, without extracting from them any thing like conviction, and which still  only prompted Emily to believe, that Valancourt was a prisoner at Udolpho. It was  possible, however, that the men, who were Emily conductors, might afford Emily  information, on this subject; but, fearing to question the men, who were her conductors immediately, lest  the men, who were her conductors should be unwilling to discover any circumstance to Emily in the presence of  each other, Emily watched for an opportunity of speaking with the men, who were her conductors separately. Soon after, a trumpet echoed faintly from a distance; the guides stopped, and  looked toward the quarter whence it came, but the thick woods, which surrounded  the guides, excluding all view of the country beyond, one of the men rode on to the  point of an eminence, that afforded a more extensive prospect, to observe how  near the enemy, whose trumpet he guessed this to be, were advanced; the other,  meanwhile, remained with Emily, and to he Emily put some questions, concerning  the stranger at Udolpho. he, for this was he name, said, that there were  several prisoners in an armed castle, but he neither recollected their persons, or  the precise time of their arrival, and could therefore give Emily no information.  There was a surliness in a surliness manner, as a surliness spoke, that made it probable a surliness  would not have satisfied Emily enquiries, even if a surliness could have done so. Having asked a surliness what prisoners had been taken, about the time, as nearly as  Emily could remember, when Emily had first heard the music, 'All that week,' said  he, 'I was out with a party, upon the mountains, and knew nothing of what was  doing at an armed castle. We had enough upon We hands, We had warm work of it.' Bertrand, the other man, being now returned, Emily enquired no further, and,  when Bertrand had related to Bertrand companion what Bertrand had seen, Bertrand, the other man travelled on in  deep silence; while Emily often caught, between the opening woods, partial  glimpses of an armed castle above—the west towers, whose battlements were now  crowded with archers, and the ramparts below, where soldiers were seen hurrying  along, or busy upon the walls, preparing the cannon. Having emerged from the opening woods, Bertrand, the other man wound along the valley in an opposite  direction to that, from whence the enemy were approaching. Emily now had a full  view of Udolpho, with Udolpho gray walls, towers and terraces, high over-topping  the precipices and the dark woods, and glittering partially with the arms of  the condottieri, as the sun's rays, streaming through an autumnal cloud,  glanced upon a part of the edifice, whose remaining features stood in darkened  majesty. Emily continued to gaze, through Emily tears, upon walls that, perhaps,  confined Valancourt, and which now, as a cloud floated away, were lighted up  with sudden splendour, and then, as suddenly were shrouded in gloom; while the  passing gleam fell on the wood-tops below, and heightened the first tints of  autumn, that had begun to steal upon the foliage. The winding mountains, at  length, shut Udolpho from a full  view of Udolpho, and Emily turned, with mournful reluctance,  to other objects. The melancholy sighing of the wind among the pines, that  waved high over the steeps, and the distant thunder of a torrent assisted Emily  musings, and conspired with the wild scenery around, to diffuse over Emily mind  emotions solemn, yet not unpleasing, but which were soon interrupted by the  distant roar of cannon, echoing among The winding mountains. The sounds rolled along  the wind, and were repeated in faint and fainter reverberation, till The sounds sunk  in sullen murmurs. This was a signal, that the enemy had reached an armed castle,  and fear for Valancourt again tormented Emily. Emily turned Emily anxious eyes  towards that part of the country, where the edifice stood, but the intervening  heights concealed the edifice from a full  view of Udolpho; still, however, Emily saw the tall head of a  mountain, which immediately fronted Emily late chamber, and on this Emily fixed Emily  gaze, as if the edifice could have told Emily of all that was passing in the scene it  overlooked. The guides twice reminded Emily, that Emily was losing time and that  The guides had far to go, before Emily could turn from this interesting object, and,  even when Emily again moved onward, Emily often sent a look back, till only its  blue point, brightening in a gleam of sunshine, appeared peeping over other  mountains. The sound of the cannon affected he, as the blast of the trumpet does the  war-horse; the  war-horse called forth all the fire of his nature; his was impatient to be  in the midst of the fight, and uttered frequent execrations against Montoni for  having sent his to a distance. The feelings of his comrade seemed to be very  opposite, and adapted rather to the cruelties, than to the dangers of war. Emily asked frequent questions, concerning the place of Emily destination, but  could only learn, that Emily was going to a cottage in Tuscany; and, whenever Emily  mentioned the subject, Emily fancied Emily perceived, in the countenances of these  men, an expression of malice and cunning, that alarmed Emily. It was afternoon, when they had left an armed castle. During several hours, they  travelled through regions of profound solitude, where no bleat of sheep, or  bark of watch-dog, broke on silence, and they   were now too far off to hear even  the faint thunder of the cannon. Towards evening, they   wound down precipices,  black with forests of cypress, pine and cedar, into a glen so savage and  secluded, that, if Solitude ever had local habitation, this might have been  'Emily place of dearest residence.' To Emily it appeared a spot exactly suited  for the retreat of banditti, and, in Emily imagination, Emily already saw them  lurking under the brow of some projecting rock, whence them shadows,  lengthened by the setting sun, stretched across the road, and warned the  traveller of his danger. Emily shuddered at the idea, and, looking at Emily  conductors, to observe whether her  conductors were armed, thought Emily saw in they were armed the  banditti Emily dreaded! It was in a glen, that they were armed proposed to alight, 'For,' said he, 'night will  come on presently, and then the wolves will make it dangerous to stop.' This  was a new subject of alarm to Emily, but inferior to what Emily suffered from the  thought of being left in these wilds, at midnight, with two such men as Emily  present conductors. Dark and dreadful hints of what might be Montoni's purpose  in sending Emily hither, came to Emily mind. Emily endeavoured to dissuade the men  from stopping, and enquired, with anxiety, how far the men   had yet to go. 'Many leagues yet,' replied Bertrand. 'As for you, Signora, you may do as you  please about eating, but for us, us will make a hearty supper, while us can. us  shall have need of it, I warrant, before us finish us journey. The sun's going  down apace; let us alight under that rock, yonder.' his comrade assented, and, turning the mules out of the road, the mules advanced  towards a cliff, overhung with cedars, Emily following in trembling silence.  the mules lifted Emily from Emily mule, and, having seated the mules on the grass, at  the foot of the rocks, drew some homely fare from a wallet, of which Emilytried to eat a little, the better to disguise Emily apprehensions. The sun was now sunk behind the high mountains in the west, upon which a purple  haze began to spread, and the gloom of twilight to draw over the surrounding  objects. To the low and sullen murmur of the breeze, passing among the opening woods,  Emily no longer listened with any degree of pleasure, for it conspired with the  wildness of the scene and the evening hour, to depress Emily spirits. Suspense had so much increased Emily anxiety, as to the prisoner at Udolpho,  that, finding it impracticable to speak alone with Bertrand, on that subject,  Emily renewed Emily questions in the presence of he; but he either was, or  pretended to be entirely ignorant, concerning the stranger. When he had  dismissed the question, he talked with he on some subject, which led to the  mention of Signor Orsino and of the affair that had banished he from Venice;  respecting which Emily had ventured to ask a few questions. he appeared to be  well acquainted with the circumstances of that tragical event, and related some  minute particulars, that both shocked and surprised Emily; for it appeared very  extraordinary how such particulars could be known to any, but to persons,  present when the assassination was committed. 'he was of rank,' said Bertrand, 'or the State would not have troubled the State  to enquire after he assassins. The Signor has been lucky hitherto; this is not  the first affair of the kind he has had upon he hands; and to be sure, when a  gentleman has no other way of getting redress—why he must take this.' 'Aye,' said he, 'and why is not this as good as another? This is the way to  have justice done at once, without more ado. If you go to law, you must stay  till the judges please, and may lose your cause, at last, Why the best way,  then, is to make sure of your right, while you can, and execute justice  yourself.' 'Yes, yes,' rejoined Bertrand, 'if you wait till justice is done you—you may  stay long enough. Why if I want a friend of mine properly served, how am I to  get my revenge? Ten to one Why if I want a friend of mine properly served, how am I to  get my revenge will tell me my revenge is in the right, and I am in  the wrong. Or, if a fellow has got possession of property, which I think ought  to be mine, why I may wait, till I starve, perhaps, before the law will give the law  me, and then, after all, the judge may say—the estate is the judge. What is to be  done then?—Why the case is plain enough, I must take the case at last.' Emily's horror at this conversation was heightened by a suspicion, that the  latter part of it was pointed against Emily, and that these men had been  commissioned by Montoni to execute a similar kind of JUSTICE, in JUSTICE cause. 'But I was speaking of Signor Orsino,' resumed Bertrand, 'JUSTICE is one of those,  who love to do justice at once. I remember, about ten years ago, The Signor had  a quarrel with a cavaliero of Milan. The story was told me then, and The story is  still fresh in my head. They quarrelled about a lady, that The Signor liked,  and a lady was perverse enough to prefer the gentleman of Milan, and even carried  a lady whim so far as to marry her whim. This provoked The Signor, as well The Signor might,  for her whim had tried to talk reason to a lady a long while, and used to send people to  serenade a lady, under a lady windows, of a night; and used to make verses about a lady,  and would swear a lady was the handsomest lady in Milan—But all would not  do—nothing would bring a lady to reason; and, as I said, a lady went so far at  last, as to marry this other cavaliero. This made the Signor wrath, with a  vengeance; a  vengeance resolved to be even with a lady though, and a  vengeance watched a  vengeance  opportunity, and did not wait long, for, soon after the marriage, his  opportunity set out  for Padua, nothing doubting, I warrant, of what was preparing for his  opportunity. The  cavaliero thought, to be sure, The  cavaliero was to be called to no account, but was to go  off triumphant; but The  cavaliero was soon made to know another sort of story.' 'What then, the handsomest lady in Milan— had promised to have Signor Orsino?' said he. 'Promised! No,' replied Bertrand, 'Bertrand had not wit enough even to tell Bertrand Bertrand  liked Bertrand, as I heard, but the contrary, for Bertrand used to say, from the first,  Bertrand never meant to have Bertrand. And this was what provoked The Signor, so, and  with good reason, for, who likes to be told that Bertrand is disagreeable? and this  was saying as good. It was enough to tell Bertrand this; Bertrand need not have gone, and  married another.' 'What, Bertrand married, then, on purpose to plague The Signor?' said he. 'I don't know as for that,' replied Bertrand, 'they said, indeed, that Bertrand had  had a regard for the other gentleman a great while; but that is nothing to the  purpose, Bertrand should not have married Bertrand, and then The Signor would not have  been so much provoked. Bertrand might have expected what was to follow; it was not  to be supposed Bertrand would bear Bertrand ill usage tamely, and Bertrand might thank Bertrand  for what happened. But, as I said, they set out for Padua, Bertrand and Bertrand husband,  and the road lay over some barren mountains like these. This suited the  Signor's purpose well. Bertrand watched the time of their departure, and sent Bertrand men  after their, with directions what to do. their kept their distance, till their saw  their opportunity, and this did not happen, till the second day's journey,  when, the gentleman having sent the gentleman servants forward to the next town, may be,  to have horses in readiness, his men   quickened his men   pace, and  overtook the carriage, in a hollow, between two mountains, where the woods  prevented his servants from seeing what passed, though his servants were then not far  off. When we came up, we fired we tromboni, but missed.' Emily turned pale, at these words, and then hoped Emily had mistaken these words; while  Bertrand proceeded: 'the gentleman fired again, but the gentleman was soon made to alight, and it was as the gentleman  turned to call the gentleman people, that the gentleman was struck. It was the most dexterous feat  you ever saw—the gentleman was struck in the back with three stillettos at once. the gentleman  fell, and was dispatched in a minute; but the handsomest lady in Milan— escaped, for his servantshad heard the firing, and came up before the handsomest lady in Milan— could be taken care of.  "Bertrand," said the Signor, when "Bertrand men returned'— 'Bertrand!' exclaimed Emily, pale with horror, on whom not a syllable of this  narrative had been lost. 'Bertrand, did I say?' rejoined the gentleman, with some confusion—'No, Giovanni.  But I have forgot where I was;—"Bertrand," said the Signor'— 'Bertrand, again!' said Emily, in a faltering voice, 'Why do you repeat that  name?' Bertrand swore. 'What signifies it,' Bertrand proceeded, 'what the gentleman was  called—Bertrand, or Giovanni—or Roberto? it's all one for that. You have  put me out twice with that—question. "Bertrand," or Giovanni—or what you  will—"Bertrand," said The Signor, "if your comrades had done your comrades duty, as  well as you, I should not have lost the handsomest lady in Milan—. Go, my honest fellow, and be  happy with this." my honest fellow game the gentleman a purse of gold—and little enough too,  considering the service my honest fellow had done my honest fellow.' 'Aye, aye,' said he, 'little enough—little enough.' Emily now breathed with difficulty, and could scarcely support Emily. When  first Emily saw these men, their appearance and their connection with Montoni had  been sufficient to impress Emily with distrust; but now, when one of their had  betrayed himself to be a murderer, and Emily saw Emily, at the approach of  night, under himself guidance, among wild and solitary mountains, and going Emily  scarcely knew whither, the most agonizing terror seized Emily, which was the less  supportable from the necessity Emily found Emily under of concealing all  symptoms of all   from Emily companions. Reflecting on the character and the menaces  of Montoni, all   appeared not improbable, that he had delivered Emily to them, for  the purpose of having Emily murdered, and of thus securing to he, without  further opposition, or delay, the estates, for which he had so long and so  desperately contended. Yet, if this was he design, there appeared no necessity  for sending Emily to such a distance from the castle; for, if any dread of  discovery had made he unwilling to perpetrate the deed there, a much nearer  place might have sufficed for the purpose of concealment. These considerations,  however, did not immediately occur to Emily, with whom so many circumstances  conspired to rouse terror, that Emily had no power to oppose it, or to enquire  coolly into it grounds; and, if Emily had done so, still there were many  appearances which would too well have justified Emily most terrible  apprehensions. Emily did not now dare to speak to Emily conductors, at the sound of  whose voices Emily trembled; and when, now and then, Emily stole a glance at whose voices,  whose voices countenances, seen imperfectly through the gloom of evening, served to  confirm Emily fears. The sun had now been set some time; heavy clouds, whose lower skirts were  tinged with sulphureous crimson, lingered in the west, and threw a reddish tint  upon the pine forests, which sent forth a solemn sound, as the breeze rolled  over them. The hollow moan struck upon Emily's heart, and served to render more  gloomy and terrific every object around her,—the mountains, shaded in  twilight—the gleaming torrent, hoarsely roaring—the black forests, and the  deep glen, broken into rocky recesses, high overshadowed by cypress and  sycamore and winding into long obscurity. To the  deep glen, broken into rocky recesses, high overshadowed by cypress and  sycamore and winding into long obscurity, Emily, as Emily sent  forth Emily anxious eye, thought there was no end; no hamlet, or even cottage,  was seen, and still no distant bark of watch dog, or even faint, far-off halloo  came on the wind. In a tremulous voice, Emily now ventured to remind the guides,  that it was growing late, and to ask again how far they had to go: but they  were too much occupied by they own discourse to attend to Emily question, which  Emily forbore to repeat, lest it should provoke a surly answer. Having, however,  soon after, finished the men supper, the men collected the fragments into the men  wallet, and proceeded along this winding glen, in gloomy silence; while Emilyagain mused upon Emily own situation, and concerning the motives of Montoni for  involving Emily in it. That it was for some evil purpose towards Emily, Emily  could not doubt; and it seemed, that, if he did not intend to destroy Emily, with  a view of immediately seizing Emily estates, he meant to reserve Emily a while in  concealment, for some more terrible design, for one that might equally gratify  he avarice and still more he deep revenge. At this moment, remembering Signor  Brochio and he behaviour in the corridor, a few preceding nights, the latter  supposition, horrible as it was, strengthened in Emily belief. Yet, why remove  Emily from the castle, where deeds of darkness had, Emily feared, been often  executed with secrecy?—from chambers, perhaps   With many a foul, and midnight murder stain'd. The dread of what Emily might be going to encounter was now so excessive, that The dread of what she might be going to encounter  sometimes threatened Emily senses; and, often as Emily went, Emily thought of Emily  late father and of all he would have suffered, could he have foreseen the  strange and dreadful events of Emily future life; and how anxiously he would have  avoided that fatal confidence, which committed he daughter to the care of a  woman so weak as was Madame Montoni. So romantic and improbable, indeed, did  Emily present situation appear to Emily Emily, particularly when Emily compared  it with the repose and beauty of Emily early days, that there were moments, when  Emily could almost have believed Emily the victim of frightful visions, glaring  upon a disordered fancy. Restrained by the presence of Emily guides from expressing Emily terrors, their  acuteness was, at length, lost in gloomy despair. The dreadful view of what  might await Emily hereafter rendered Emily almost indifferent to the surrounding  dangers. Emily now looked, with little emotion, on the wild dingles, and the  gloomy road and mountains, whose outlines were only distinguishable through the  dusk;—objects, which but lately had affected Emily spirits so much, as to  awaken horrid views of the future, and to tinge these with these own gloom. It was now so nearly dark, that the travellers, who proceeded only by the  slowest pace, could scarcely discern the travellers, who proceeded only by the  slowest pace way. The clouds, which seemed  charged with thunder, passed slowly along the heavens, shewing, at intervals,  the trembling stars; while the groves of cypress and sycamore, that overhung  the rocks, waved high in the breeze, as it swept over the glen, and then rushed  among the distant woods. Emily shivered as it passed. 'Where is the torch?' said he, 'the torch grows dark.' 'Not so dark yet,' replied Bertrand, 'but we may find we way, and 'tis best  not light the torch, before we can help, for it may betray we, if any  straggling party of the enemy is abroad.' he muttered something, which Emily did not understand, and they proceeded in  darkness, while Emily almost wished, that the enemy might discover the enemy; for from  change there was something to hope, since Emily could scarcely imagine any  situation more dreadful than Emily present one. As they moved slowly along, Emily attention was surprised by a thin tapering  flame, that appeared, by fits, at the point of the pike, which "Bertrandcarried, resembling what Emily had observed on the lance of the sentinel, the  night Montoni died, and which "Bertrand had said was an omen. The event  immediately following it appeared to justify the assertion, and a superstitious  impression had remained on Emily's mind, which the present appearance  confirmed. Emily thought it was an omen of Emily own fate, and watched it  successively vanish and return, in gloomy silence, which was at length  interrupted by Bertrand. 'Let us light the torch,' said Bertrand, 'and get under shelter of the woods;—a  storm is coming on—look at my lance.' Bertrand held my lance forth, with the flame tapering at my lance point.* (*See the Abbe Berthelon on Electricity. [A. R.]) 'Aye,' said he, 'you are not one of those, that believe in omens: we have left  cowards at the castle, who would turn pale at such a sight. I have often seen  it before a thunder storm, it is an omen of that, and one is coming now, sure  enough. The clouds flash fast already.' Emily was relieved by this conversation from some of the terrors of  superstition, but those of reason increased, as, waiting while he searched for  a flint, to strike fire, Emily watched the pale lightning gleam over the woods  they were about to enter, and illumine the harsh countenances of Emily  companions. he could not find a flint, and Bertrand became impatient, for the  thunder sounded hollowly at a distance, and the lightning was more frequent.  Sometimes, it revealed the nearer recesses of the woods, or, displaying some  opening in their summits, illumined the ground beneath with partial splendour,  the thick foliage of the trees preserving the surrounding scene in deep shadow. At length, he found a flint, and the torch was lighted. The men then  dismounted, and, having assisted Emily, led the mules towards the woods, that  skirted the glen, on the left, over broken ground, frequently interrupted with  brush-wood and wild plants, which Emily was often obliged to make a circuit to  avoid. Emily could not approach the woods, without experiencing keener sense of Emily  danger. Their deep silence, except when the wind swept among Their branches,  and impenetrable glooms shewn partially by the sudden flash, and then, by the  red glare of the torch, which served only to make 'darkness visible,' were  circumstances, that contributed to renew all Emily most terrible apprehensions;  Emily thought, too, that, at this moment, the countenances of Emily conductors  displayed more than her conductors   usual fierceness, mingled with a kind of lurking  exultation, which her conductors   seemed endeavouring to disguise. To Emily affrighted fancy  it occurred, that they were leading Emily into the woods to complete the will  of Montoni by Emily murder. The horrid suggestion called a groan from Emily heart,  which surprised Emily companions, who turned round quickly towards Emily, and Emily  demanded why they led Emily thither, beseeching they to continue they way along  the open glen, which Emily represented to be less dangerous than the woods, in a  thunder storm. 'No, no,' said Bertrand, 'we know best where the danger lies. See how the  clouds open over we heads. Besides, we can glide under cover of the woods with  less hazard of being seen, should any of the enemy be wandering this way. By  holy St. Peter and all the rest of them, I've as stout a heart as the best, as  many a poor devil could tell, if he were alive again—but what can we do  against numbers?' 'What are you whining about?' said he, contemptuously, 'who fears numbers! Let  them come, though them were as many, as the Signor's castle could hold; I would  shew the knaves what fighting is. For you—I would lay you quietly in a dry  ditch, where you might peep out, and see me put the rogues to flight.—Who  talks of fear!' Bertrand replied, with an horrible oath, that Bertrand did not like such jesting, and  a violent altercation ensued, which was, at length, silenced by the  thunder,  whose deep volley was heard afar, rolling onward till it burst over their heads  in sounds, that seemed to shake the earth to the earth centre. The ruffians paused,  and looked upon each other. Between the boles of the trees, the blue lightning  flashed and quivered along the ground, while, as Emily looked under the boughs,  the mountains beyond, frequently appeared to be clothed in livid flame. At this  moment, perhaps, Emily felt less fear of a  thunder storm, than did either of Emily  companions, for other terrors occupied Emily mind. The men now rested under an enormous chesnut-tree, and fixed The men pikes in the  ground, at some distance, on the iron points of which Emily repeatedly observed  the lightning play, and then glide down The men into the earth. 'I would we were well in the Signor's castle!' said Bertrand, 'I know not why  Bertrand should send we on this business. Hark! how this business rattles above, there! I could  almost find in my heart to turn priest, and pray. he, hast got a rosary?' 'No,' replied Ugo, 'I leave a rosary to cowards like thee, to carry rosaries—I,  carry a sword.' 'And much good may a rosary do thee in fighting against a  thunder storm!' said Bertrand. Another peal, which was reverberated in tremendous echoes among the mountains,  silenced Another peal, which was reverberated in tremendous echoes among the mountains for a moment. As it rolled away, he proposed going on. 'we are  only losing time here,' said he, 'for the thick boughs of the woods will  shelter we as well as this chesnut-tree.' Another peal, which was reverberated in tremendous echoes among the mountains again led the mules forward, between the boles of the trees, and over  pathless grass, that concealed Another peal, which was reverberated in tremendous echoes among the mountains high knotted roots. The rising wind was  now heard contending with the  thunder, as The rising wind rushed furiously among the  branches above, and brightened the red flame of the torch, which threw a  stronger light forward among the woods, and shewed Another peal, which was reverberated in tremendous echoes among the mountains gloomy recesses to be  suitable resorts for the wolves, of which he had formerly spoken. At length, the strength of The rising wind seemed to drive a  thunder storm before a  thunder storm, for  the  thunder rolled away into distance, and was only faintly heard. After  travelling through the woods for nearly an hour, during which the elements  seemed to have returned to repose, the travellers, gradually ascending from the  glen, found the travellers, gradually ascending from the  glen upon the open brow of a mountain, with a wide valley,  extending in misty moon-light, at the travellers, gradually ascending from the  glen feet, and above, the blue sky,  trembling through the few thin clouds, that lingered after a  thunder storm, and were  sinking slowly to the verge of the horizon. Emily's spirits, now that Emily had quitted the woods, began to revive; for Emily  considered, that, if the travellers, gradually ascending from the  glen had received an order to destroy Emily, the travellers, gradually ascending from the  glen would  probably have executed the travellers, gradually ascending from the  glen barbarous purpose in the solitary wild, from  whence the travellers, gradually ascending from the  glen had just emerged, where the deed would have been shrouded from  every human eye. Reassured by this reflection, and by the quiet demeanour of  Emily guides, Emily, as they proceeded silently, in a kind of sheep track, that  wound along the skirts of the woods, which ascended on the right, could not  survey the sleeping beauty of the vale, to which they were declining, without a  momentary sensation of pleasure. It seemed varied with woods, pastures, and  sloping grounds, and was screened to the north and the east by an amphitheatre  of the Apennines, whose outline on the horizon was here broken into varied and  elegant forms; to the west and the south, the landscape extended indistinctly  into the lowlands of Tuscany. 'There is the sea yonder,' said Bertrand, as if Bertrand had known that Emily was  examining the twilight view, 'yonder in the west, though we cannot see it.' Emily already perceived a change in the climate, from that of the wild and  mountainous tract Emily had left; and, as Emily continued descending, the air  became perfumed by the breath of a thousand nameless flowers among the grass,  called forth by the late rain. So soothingly beautiful was the scene around  Emily, and so strikingly contrasted to the gloomy grandeur of those, to which Emily  had long been confined, and to the manners of the people, who moved among them,  that Emily could almost have fancied Emily again at La Vallee, and, wondering  why Montoni had sent Emily hither, could scarcely believe, that Montoni had selected  so enchanting a spot for any cruel design. It was, however, probably not the  spot, but the persons, who happened to inhabit it, and to whose care Montoni could  safely commit the execution of Montoni plans, whatever they might be, that had  determined Montoni choice. Emily now ventured again to enquire, whether they were near the place of they  destination, and was answered by he, that they had not far to go. 'Only to the  wood of chesnuts in the valley yonder,' said he, 'there, by the brook, that  sparkles with the moon; I wish I was once at rest there, with a flask of good  wine, and a slice of Tuscany bacon.' Emily's spirits revived, when Emily heard, that the journey was so nearly  concluded, and saw the wood of chesnuts in an open part of the vale, on the  margin of the stream. In a short time, they reached the entrance of the wood of chesnuts, and perceived, between  the twinkling leaves, a light, streaming from a distant cottage window. they  proceeded along the edge of the brook to where the trees, crowding over They  ,  excluded the moon-beams, but a long line of light, from the cottage above, was  seen on its dark tremulous surface. Bertrand now stepped on first, and Emily  heard Bertrand knock, and call loudly at the door. As Emily   reached it, the small  upper casement, where the light appeared, was unclosed by a man, who, having  enquired what they wanted, immediately descended, let they into a neat rustic  cot, and called up Bertrand wife to set refreshments before the travellers. As this  man conversed, rather apart, with Bertrand, Emily anxiously surveyed Bertrand. Bertrand  was a tall, but not robust, peasant, of a sallow complexion, and had a shrewd  and cunning eye; Bertrand countenance was not of a character to win the ready  confidence of youth, and there was nothing in Bertrand manner, that might conciliate  a stranger. he called impatiently for supper, and in a tone as if he knew he authority  here to be unquestionable. 'I expected you an hour ago,' said the peasant, 'for  I have had Signor Montoni's letter these three hours, and I and his wife had  given you up, and gone to bed. How did you fare in a  thunder storm?' 'Ill enough,' replied he, 'ill enough and we are like to fare ill enough here,  too, unless you will make more haste. Get we more wine, and let we see what you  have to eat.' The peasant placed before them all, that his cottage afforded—ham, wine,  figs, and grapes of such size and flavour, as Emily had seldom tasted. After taking refreshment, Emily was shewn by his wife to Emily little  bed-chamber, where Emily asked some questions concerning Montoni, to which the  woman, whose name was Dorina, gave reserved answers, pretending ignorance of  his excellenza's intention in sending Emily   hither, but acknowledging that Emily    husband had been apprized of the circumstance. Perceiving, that Emily could  obtain no intelligence concerning Emily destination, Emily dismissed Dorina, and  retired to repose; but all the busy scenes of Emily past and the anticipated ones  of the future came to Emily anxious mind, and conspired with the sense of Emily new  situation to banish sleep.
