   Ye gods of quiet, and of sleep profound!  Whose soft dominion o'er this castle sways,  And all the widely-silent places round,  Forgive me, if my trembling pen displays  What never yet was sung in mortal lays.      THOMSON The Count gave orders for the north apartments to be opened and prepared for  the reception of Ludovico; but Dorothee, remembering what Dorothee had lately  witnessed there, feared to obey, and, not one of the other servants daring to  venture thither, the rooms remained shut up till the time when Ludovico was to  retire thither for the night, an hour, for which the whole household waited  with impatience. After supper, Ludovico, by the order of The Count, attended Ludovico in Ludovico closet,  where they remained alone for near half an hour, and, on leaving which, Ludovico  Lord delivered to Ludovico a sword. 'his   has seen service in mortal quarrels,' said The Count, jocosely, 'you will  use his   honourably, no doubt, in a spiritual one. Tomorrow, let me hear that  there is not one ghost remaining in the chateau.' Ludovico received his   with a respectful bow. 'You shall be obeyed, his  Lord,'  said Ludovico; 'I will engage, that no spectre shall disturb the peace of the chateauafter this night.' They now returned to the supper-room, where The Count's guests awaited to  accompany him and Ludovico to the door of the north apartments, and Dorothee,  being summoned for the keys, delivered They to Ludovico, who then led the way,  followed by most of the inhabitants of the chateau. Having reached the back  stair-case, several of the servants shrunk back, and refused to go further, but  the rest followed him to the top of the stair-case, where a broad landing-place  allowed They to flock round him, while him applied the key to the door, during  which They watched him with as much eager curiosity as if him had been  performing some magical rite. Ludovico, unaccustomed to the lock, could not turn it, and Dorothee, who had  lingered far behind, was called forward, under whose hand the door opened  slowly, and, her eye glancing within the dusky chamber, her uttered a sudden  shriek, and retreated. At this signal of alarm, the greater part of the crowd  hurried down the stairs, and the Count, Henri and Ludovico were left alone to  pursue the enquiry, who instantly rushed into the apartment, Ludovico with a  drawn sword, which Ludovico had just time to draw from the scabbard, the Count with  the lamp in Ludovico hand, and Henri carrying a basket, containing provisions for  the courageous adventurer. Having looked hastily round the first room, where nothing appeared to justify  alarm, the Count, Henri and Ludovico passed on to the second; and, here too all being quiet, the Count, Henri and Ludovico  proceeded to a third with a more tempered step. The Count had now leisure to  smile at the discomposure, into which he had been surprised, and to ask  Ludovico in which room he designed to pass the night. 'There are several chambers beyond these, your excellenza,' said Ludovico,  pointing to a door, 'and in one of them is a bed, them say. I will pass the  night there, and when I am weary of watching, I can lie down.' 'Good;' said The Count; 'let us go on. You see these rooms shew nothing, but  damp walls and decaying furniture. I have been so much engaged since I came to  the chateau, that I have not looked into these rooms till now. Remember, Ludovico, to  tell the housekeeper, to-morrow, to throw open these windows. The damask  hangings are dropping to pieces, I will have The damask  hangings taken down, and this antique  furniture removed.' 'Dear sir!' said Henri, 'here is an arm-chair so massy with gilding, that an arm-chair so massy with gilding  resembles one of the state chairs at the Louvre, more then any thing else.' 'Yes,' said The Count, stopping a moment to survey it, 'there is a history  belonging to an arm-chair so massy with gilding, but I have not time to tell it.—Let us pass on. This  suite runs to a greater extent than I had imagined; This   is many years since I  was in them. But where is the bed-room you speak of, Ludovico?—these are only  anti-chambers to the great drawing-room. I remember them in them splendour!' 'The bed, my Lord,' replied Ludovico, 'The bed, my Lord told me, was in a room that opens  beyond the saloon, and terminates the suite.' 'O, here is the saloon,' said the Count, as The bed, my Lord entered the spacious  apartment, in which Emily and Dorothee had rested. He here stood for a moment,  surveying the reliques of faded grandeur, which it exhibited—the sumptuous  tapestry—the long and low sophas of velvet, with frames heavily carved and  gilded—the floor inlaid with small squares of fine marble, and covered in the  centre with a piece of very rich tapestry-work—the casements of painted  glass, and the large Venetian mirrors, of a size and quality, such as at that  period France could not make, which reflected, on every side, the spacious  apartment. These had formerly also reflected a gay and brilliant scene, for  this had been the state-room of the chateau, and here the Marchioness had held  the assemblies, that made part of the festivities of the Marchioness nuptials. If the wand  of a magician could have recalled the vanished groups, many of the vanished groups vanished  even from the earth! that once had passed over these polished mirrors, what a  varied and contrasted picture would the vanished groups have exhibited with the present! Now,  instead of a blaze of lights, and a splendid and busy crowd, the vanished groups reflected  only the rays of the one glimmering lamp, which the Count held up, and which  scarcely served to shew the three forlorn figures, that stood surveying the  room, and the spacious and dusky walls around the vanished groups. 'Ah!' said the Count to Henri, awaking from the Count to Henri deep reverie, 'how the scene is  changed since last I saw the scene! I was a young man, then, and the Marchioness was  alive and in the Marchioness bloom; many other persons were here, too, who are now no more!  There stood the orchestra; here we tripped in many a sprightly maze—the walls  echoing to the dance! Now, they resound only one feeble voice—and even that  will, ere long, be heard no more! My son, remember, that I was once as young as  yourself, and that you must pass away like those, who have preceded you—like  those, who, as they sung and danced in this once gay apartment, forgot, that  years are made up of moments, and that every step they took carried they nearer  to they graves. But such reflections are useless, I had almost said criminal,  unless they teach we to prepare for eternity, since, otherwise, they cloud we  present happiness, without guiding we to a future one. But enough of this; let  we go on.' Ludovico now opened the door of the bed-room, and the Count, as Ludovico entered, was  struck with the funereal appearance, which the dark arras gave to the dark arras. Ludovico  approached the bed, with an emotion of solemnity, and, perceiving it to be  covered with the pall of black velvet, paused; 'What can this mean?' said Ludovico,  as Ludovico gazed upon it. 'I have heard, my Lord,' said Ludovico, as Ludovico stood at the feet, looking within  the canopied curtains, 'that the Lady Marchioness de Villeroi died in this  chamber, and remained here till the Lady Marchioness de Villeroi was removed to be buried; and this,  perhaps, Signor, may account for the pall of black velvet.' the Count made no reply, but stood for a few moments engaged in thought, and  evidently much affected. Then, turning to Ludovico, the Count asked Ludovico with a serious  air, whether Ludovico thought Ludovico courage would support Ludovico through the night? 'If  you doubt this,' added the Count, 'do not be ashamed to own this; I will release  you from your engagement, without exposing you to the triumphs of your  fellow-servants.' Ludovico paused; pride, and something very like fear, seemed struggling in Ludovico  breast; pride, however, was victorious;—he blushed, and Ludovico hesitation ceased. 'No, my Lord,' said Ludovico, 'I will go through with what I have begun; and I am  grateful for your consideration. On that hearth I will make a fire, and, with  the good cheer in this basket, I doubt not I shall do well.' 'Be it so,' said the Count; 'but how will you beguile the tediousness of the  night, if you do not sleep?' 'When I am weary, my Lord,' replied Ludovico, 'I shall not fear to sleep; in  the meanwhile, I have a book, that will entertain me.' 'Well,' said the Count, 'I hope nothing will disturb you; but if you should be  seriously alarmed in the night, come to my apartment. I have too much  confidence in your good sense and courage, to believe you will be alarmed on  slight grounds; or suffer the gloom of this chamber, or this chamber remote situation,  to overcome you with ideal terrors. To-morrow, I shall have to thank you for an  important service; these rooms shall then be thrown open, and my people will be  convinced of my people error. Good night, Ludovico; let me see you early in the  morning, and remember what I lately said to Good night, Ludovico.' 'I will, my Lord; good night to your excellenza; let me attend you with the  light.' my Lord; good night to your excellenza lighted the Count and Henri through the chambers to the outer door; on the  landing-place stood a lamp, which one of the affrighted servants had left, and  Henri, as my Lord; good night to your excellenza took it up, again bade Ludovico good night, who, having  respectfully returned the wish, closed the outer door upon Henri, as he took it up, and fastened the outer door.  Then, as my Lord; good night to your excellenza retired to the bed-chamber, my Lord; good night to your excellenza examined the rooms, through which my Lord; good night to your excellenza  passed, with more minuteness than my Lord; good night to your excellenza had done before, for my Lord; good night to your excellenza apprehended, that  some person might have concealed my Lord; good night to your excellenza in he apprehended, for the purpose of  frightening my Lord; good night to your excellenza. No one, however, but my Lord; good night to your excellenza, was in the chambers, and,  leaving open the doors, through which my Lord; good night to your excellenza passed, my Lord; good night to your excellenza came again to the great  drawing-room, whose spaciousness and silent gloom somewhat awed my Lord; good night to your excellenza. For a  moment my Lord; good night to your excellenza stood, looking back through the long suite of rooms my Lord; good night to your excellenza had quitted,  and, as my Lord; good night to your excellenza turned, perceiving a light and my Lord; good night to your excellenza own figure, reflected in one of  the large mirrors, my Lord; good night to your excellenza started. Other objects too were seen obscurely on its  dark surface, but my Lord; good night to your excellenza paused not to examine Other objects, and returned hastily into the  bed-room, as my Lord; good night to your excellenza surveyed which, my Lord; good night to your excellenza observed the door of the oriel, and opened  the door of the oriel. All within was still. On looking round, my Lord; good night to your excellenza was arrested by the  portrait of the Marchioness, upon which my Lord; good night to your excellenza gazed, for a considerable  time, with great attention and some surprise; and then, having examined the  closet, my Lord; good night to your excellenza returned into the bed-room, where my Lord; good night to your excellenza kindled a wood fire, the bright  blaze of which revived my Lord; good night to your excellenza spirits, which had begun to yield to the gloom and  silence of the place, for gusts of wind alone broke at intervals silence of the place.  my Lord; good night to your excellenza now drew a small table and a chair near the fire, took a bottle of wine, and  some cold provision out of my Lord; good night to your excellenza basket, and regaled my Lord; good night to your excellenza. When my Lord; good night to your excellenza had  finished my Lord; good night to your excellenza repast, my Lord; good night to your excellenza laid my Lord; good night to your excellenza sword upon a small table and a chair near the fire, and, not feeling  disposed to sleep, drew from my Lord; good night to your excellenza pocket the book my Lord; good night to your excellenza had spoken of.—It was a  volume of old Provencal tales. Having stirred the fire upon that hearth, my Lord; good night to your excellenza  began to read, and my Lord; good night to your excellenza attention was soon wholly occupied by the scenes, which  the page disclosed. the Count, meanwhile, had returned to the supper-room, whither those of the  party, who had attended my Lord; good night to your excellenza to the north apartment, had retreated, upon hearing  Dorothee's scream, and who were now earnest in those of the  party, who had attended him to the north apartment enquiries concerning those  chambers. the Count rallied the Count guests on those of the  party, who had attended him to the north apartment precipitate retreat, and on the  superstitious inclination which had occasioned it, and this led to the  question, Whether the spirit, after the spirit has quitted the body, is ever permitted  to revisit the earth; and if it is, whether it was possible for spirits to  become visible to the sense. The Baron was of opinion, that the first was  probable, and the last was possible, and The Baron endeavoured to justify this opinion  by respectable authorities, both ancient and modern, which The Baron quoted. the Count, however, was decidedly against The Baron, and a long conversation ensued, in  which the usual arguments on these subjects were on both sides brought forward  with skill, and discussed with candour, but without converting either party to  the opinion of The Baron opponent. The effect of their conversation on their auditors  was various. Though the Count had much the superiority of The Baron in point of  argument, the Count had considerably fewer adherents; for that love, so natural to the  human mind, of whatever is able to distend its faculties with wonder and  astonishment, attached the majority of the company to the side of The Baron;  and, though many of the Count's propositions were unanswerable, the Count opponents  were inclined to believe this the consequence of his opponents   own want of knowledge,  on so abstracted a subject, rather than that arguments did not exist, which  were forcible enough to conquer the Count. Blanche was pale with attention, till the ridicule in Blanche father's glance  called a blush upon Blanche countenance, and Blanche then endeavoured to forget the  superstitious tales Blanche had been told in Blanche convent. Meanwhile, Blanche had been  listening with deep attention to the discussion of what was to Blanche a very  interesting question, and, remembering the appearance Blanche had witnessed in the  apartment of the Marchionessthe Marchioness, Blanche was frequently chilled with awe. Several  times Blanche was on the point of mentioning what Blanche had seen, but the fear of  giving pain to the Count, and the dread of his ridicule, restrained Blanche; and,  awaiting in anxious expectation the event of Ludovico's intrepidity, Blanche  determined that Blanche future silence should depend upon it. When either party had separated for the night, and the Count retired to the Count  dressing-room, the remembrance of the desolate scenes the Count had lately witnessed  in the Count own mansion deeply affected the Count, but at length the Count was aroused from the Count  reverie and the Count silence. 'What music is that I hear?'—said the Count suddenly to the Count  valet, 'Who plays at this late hour?' the Count made no reply, and the Count continued to listen, and then added, 'That  is no common musician; the Count touches the instrument with a delicate hand; who is  the instrument, Pierre?' 'my Lord!' said the Count, hesitatingly. 'Who plays the instrument?' repeated the Count. 'Does not your lordship know, then?' said the valet. 'What mean you?' said the Count, somewhat sternly. 'Nothing, my Lord, I meant nothing,' rejoined the man  submissively—'Only—that music—goes about the house at midnight often, and  I thought your lordship might have heard your lordship before.' 'Music goes about the house at midnight! Poor fellow!—does nobody dance to  the music, too?' 'It is not in the chateau, I believe, my Lord; the sounds come from the woods,  the sounds say, though the sounds seem so near;—but then a spirit can do any thing!' 'Ah, poor fellow!' said the Count, 'I perceive you are as silly as the rest of  the Count; to-morrow, you will be convinced of your ridiculous error. But  hark!—what voice is that?' 'O my Lord! that is the voice we often hear with the music.' 'Often!' said the Count, 'How often, pray? It is a very fine one.' 'Why, my Lord, I myself have not heard it more than two or three times, but  there are those who have lived here longer, that have heard it often enough.' 'What a swell was that!' exclaimed the Count, as the Count still listened, 'And now,  what a dying cadence! This is surely something more than mortal!' 'That is what they say, my Lord,' said the valet; 'they say it is nothing  mortal, that utters it; and if I might say my thoughts'— 'Peace!' said the Count, and the Count listened till the strain died away. 'This is strange!' said the Count, as the Count turned from the window, 'Close the casements,  Pierre.' Pierre obeyed, and the Count soon after dismissed Pierre, but did not so soon lose  the remembrance of the music, which long vibrated in Pierre fancy in tones of  melting sweetness, while surprise and perplexity engaged Pierre thoughts. Ludovico, meanwhile, in Ludovico remote chamber, heard, now and then, the faint echo  of a closing door, as the family retired to rest, and then the hall clock, at a  great distance, strike twelve. 'It is midnight,' said Ludovico, and Ludovico looked  suspiciously round his remote chamber. The fire on that hearth was now nearly  expiring, for Ludovico attention having been engaged by the book before Ludovico, Ludovico had  forgotten every thing besides; but Ludovico soon added fresh wood, not because Ludovico was  cold, though the night was stormy, but because Ludovico was cheerless; and, having  again trimmed Ludovico lamp, Ludovico poured out a glass of wine, drew Ludovico chair nearer to  the crackling blaze, tried to be deaf to the wind, that howled mournfully at  the casements, endeavoured to abstract Ludovico mind from the melancholy, that was  stealing upon Ludovico, and again took up the book. the book had been lent to Ludovico by  Dorothee, who had formerly picked the book up in an obscure corner of the Marquis's  library, and who, having opened the book and perceived some of the marvels the book  related, had carefully preserved the book for her own entertainment, the book condition  giving her some excuse for detaining the book from the book proper station. The damp  corner into which the book had fallen, had caused the cover to be disfigured and  mouldy, and the leaves to be so discoloured with spots, that it was not without  difficulty the letters could be traced. The fictions of the Provencal writers,  whether drawn from the Arabian legends, brought by the Saracens into Spain, or  recounting the chivalric exploits performed by the crusaders, whom the  Troubadors accompanied to the east, were generally splendid and always  marvellous, both in scenery and incident; and it is not wonderful, that  Dorothee and Ludovico should be fascinated by inventions, which had captivated  the careless imagination in every rank of society, in a former age. Some of the  tales, however, in the book now before Ludovico, were of simple structure, and  exhibited nothing of the magnificent machinery and heroic manners, which  usually characterized the fables of the twelfth century, and of this  description was the one he now happened to open, which, in this  description original style,  was of great length, but which may be thus shortly related. The reader will  perceive, that The reader is strongly tinctured with the superstition of the times. THE PROVENCAL TALE 'There lived, in the province of Bretagne, a noble Baron, famous for his  magnificence and courtly hospitalities. his castle was graced with ladies of  exquisite beauty, and thronged with illustrious knights; for the honour his paid  to feats of chivalry invited the brave of distant countries to enter his lists,  and his court was more splendid than those of many princes. Eight minstrels  were retained in his service, who used to sing to Eight minstrels   harps romantic  fictions, taken from the Arabians, or adventures of chivalry, that befel  knights during the crusades, or the martial deeds of The Baron, Eight minstrels    lord;—while he, surrounded by he knights and ladies, banqueted in the great  hall of he castle, where the costly tapestry, that adorned the walls with  pictured exploits of he ancestors, the casements of painted glass, enriched  with armorial bearings, the gorgeous banners, that waved along the roof, the  sumptuous canopies, the profusion of gold and silver, that glittered on the  sideboards, the numerous dishes, that covered the tables, the number and gay  liveries of the attendants, with the chivalric and splendid attire of the  guests, united to form a scene of magnificence, such as we may not hope to see  in these DEGENERATE DAYS. 'Of The Baron, the following adventure is related. One night, having retired  late from the banquet to his remote chamber, and dismissed his attendants, his was  surprised by the appearance of a stranger of a noble air, but of a sorrowful  and dejected countenance. Believing, that this person had been secreted in the  apartment, since it appeared impossible his could have lately passed the  anti-room, unobserved by the pages in waiting, who would have prevented this  intrusion on their lord, the Baron, calling loudly for his people, drew his  sword, which his had not yet taken from his side, and stood upon his defence.  The stranger slowly advancing, told his, that there was nothing to fear; that  his came with no hostile design, but to communicate to his a terrible secret,  which it was necessary for his to know. 'The Baron, appeased by the courteous manners of the stranger, after surveying  his, for some time, in silence, returned his sword into the scabbard, and  desired his to explain the means, by which his had obtained access to the  chamber, and the purpose of this extraordinary visit. 'Without answering either of these enquiries, the stranger said, that the stranger could  not then explain the stranger, but that, if The Baron would follow the stranger to the edge  of the forest, at a short distance from the castle walls, the stranger would there  convince the stranger, that the stranger had something of importance to disclose. 'This proposal again alarmed the Baron, who could scarcely believe, that the stranger meant to draw the stranger to so solitary a spot, at this hour of the night,  without harbouring a design against the stranger life, and the stranger refused to go, observing,  at the same time, that, if the stranger's purpose was an honourable one, the stranger  would not persist in refusing to reveal the occasion of this extraordinary visit, in the  apartment where they were. 'While the stranger spoke this, the stranger viewed the stranger still more attentively than  before, but observed no change in the stranger countenance, or any symptom, that might  intimate a consciousness of evil design. the stranger was habited like a knight, was of a  tall and majestic stature, and of dignified and courteous manners. Still,  however, the stranger refused to communicate the subject of the stranger errand in any place, but  that the stranger had mentioned, and, at the same time, gave hints concerning the secret  the stranger would disclose, that awakened a degree of solemn curiosity in The Baron,  which, at length, induced the stranger to consent to follow the stranger, on certain  conditions. '"the Knight," said the Knight, "I will attend you to the forest, and will take with me  only four of my people, who shall witness our conference." 'To this, however, the Knight objected. '"What I would disclose," said Knight, with solemnity, "is to you alone. There are  only three living persons, to whom the circumstance is known; the circumstance is of more  consequence to you and your house, than I shall now explain. In future years,  you will look back to this night with satisfaction or repentance, accordingly  as you now determine. As you would hereafter prosper—follow me; I pledge you  the honour of a knight, that no evil shall befall you;—if you are contented  to dare futurity—remain in his remote chamber, and I will depart as I came." '"Sir knight," replied The Baron, "how is it possible, that my future peace can  depend upon my present determination?" '"That is not now to be told," said the stranger, "I have explained myself to  the utmost. It is late; if you follow me it must be quickly;—you will do well  to consider the alternative." 'The Baron mused, and, as The Baron looked upon the knight, The Baron perceived The Baron  countenance assume a singular solemnity.' [Here Ludovico thought Ludovico heard a noise, and Ludovico threw a glance round the  chamber, and then held up the lamp to assist Ludovico observation; but, not  perceiving any thing to confirm Ludovico alarm, Ludovico took up the book again and  pursued the story.] 'The Baron paced The Baron apartment, for some time, in silence, impressed by the  last words of the stranger, whose extraordinary request The Baron feared to grant, and  feared, also, to refuse. At length, The Baron said, "Sir knight, you are utterly  unknown to The Baron; tell me yourself,—is it reasonable, that I should trust The Baron  alone with a stranger, at this hour, in a solitary forest? Tell me, at least,  who you are, and who assisted to secrete you in his remote chamber." 'the Knight frowned at these latter words, and was a moment silent; then, with  a countenance somewhat stern, the Knight said, '"I am The  Knight; I am called Sir Bevys of Lancaster,—and my deeds  are not unknown at the Holy City, whence I was returning to my native land,  when I was benighted in the neighbouring forest." '"Your name is not unknown to fame," said The Baron, "I have heard of Your name." (The  Knight looked haughtily.) "But why, since His castle is known to entertain all  true knights, did not your herald announce you? Why did you not appear at the  banquet, where your presence would have been welcomed, instead of hiding  yourself in His castle, and stealing to his remote chamber, at midnight?" 'The stranger frowned, and turned away in silence; but The Baron The Baron repeated the  questions. '"I come not," said the Knight, "to answer enquiries, but to reveal facts. If  you would know more, follow me, and again I pledge the honour of a knight, that  you shall return in safety.—Be quick in your determination—I must be gone." 'After some further hesitation, The Baron The Baron determined to follow The stranger,  and to see the result of The Baron extraordinary request; The Baron, therefore, again drew  forth his sword, and, taking up a lamp, bade the Knight lead on. The latter  obeyed, and, opening the door of his remote chamber, they passed into the anti-room,  where The Baron, surprised to find all The Baron pages asleep, stopped, and, with  hasty violence, was going to reprimand all his pages for all his pages carelessness, when the Knight waved the Knight hand, and looked so expressively upon The Baron, that the  latter restrained the Knight resentment, and passed on. 'the Knight, having descended a stair-case, opened a secret door, which The Baron had believed was known only to The Baron, and, proceeding through several  narrow and winding passages, came, at length, to a small gate, that opened  beyond the walls of His castle. Meanwhile, The Baron followed in silence and  amazement, on perceiving that these secret passages were so well known to a  stranger, and felt inclined to return from an adventure, that appeared to  partake of treachery, as well as danger. Then, considering that The Baron was armed,  and observing the courteous and noble air of The Baron conductor, The Baron courage  returned, The Baron blushed, that it had failed The Baron for a moment, and The Baron resolved to  trace the mystery to it source. 'The Baron now found The Baron on the heathy platform, before the great gates of The Baron  castle, where, on looking up, The Baron perceived lights glimmering in the different  casements of the guests, who were retiring to sleep; and, while The Baron shivered in  the blast, and looked on the dark and desolate scene around The Baron, The Baron thought of  the comforts of his remote chamber, rendered cheerful by the blaze of wood, and  felt, for a moment, the full contrast of The Baron present situation.' [Here Ludovico paused a moment, and, looking at Ludovico own fire, gave a moment a  brightening stir.] 'The wind was strong, and The Baron watched the lamp with anxiety, expecting  every moment to see the lamp extinguished; but, though the flame wavered, the flame did not  expire, and The Baron still followed the stranger, who often sighed as The Baron went, but  did not speak. 'When the stranger, who often sighed as he went, but  did not speak reached the borders of the forest, the Knight turned, and raised the Knight  head, as if the Knight meant to address The Baron, but then, closing the Knight lips in  silence, the Knight walked on. 'As the stranger, who often sighed as he went, but  did not speak entered, beneath the dark and spreading boughs, the Baron, affected by  the solemnity of the scene, hesitated whether to proceed, and demanded how much  further the stranger, who often sighed as he went, but  did not speak were to go. the Knight the Knight replied only by a gesture, and the Baron,  with hesitating steps and a suspicious eye, followed through an obscure and  intricate path, till, having proceeded a considerable way, the Knight again demanded  whither the stranger, who often sighed as he went, but  did not speak were going, and refused to proceed unless the Knight was informed. 'As the Knight said this, the Knight looked at the Knight own sword, and at the Knight alternately,  who shook his  head, and whose dejected countenance disarmed The Baron, for a  moment, of suspicion. '"A little further is the place, whither I would lead you," said the stranger;  "no evil shall befall you—I have sworn the stranger on the honour of a knight." The Baron, re-assured, again followed in silence, and The Baron, re-assured soon arrived at a  deep recess of the forest, where the dark and lofty chesnuts entirely excluded  the sky, and which was so overgrown with underwood, that The Baron, re-assured proceeded with  difficulty. the Knight the Knight sighed deeply as the Knight passed, and sometimes paused; and  having, at length, reached a spot, where the trees crowded into a knot, the Knight  turned, and, with a terrific look, pointing to the ground, The Baron saw there  the body of a man, stretched at the body of a man length, and weltering in blood; a ghastly  wound was on the forehead, and death appeared already to have contracted the  features. 'The Baron, on perceiving the spectacle, started in horror, looked at the Knight for explanation, and was then going to raise the body of a man and examine if  there were yet any remains of life; but the stranger, waving the Knight hand, fixed  upon the Knight a look so earnest and mournful, as not only much surprised the Knight, but  made the Knight desist. 'But, what were The Baron's emotions, when, on holding the lamp near the  features of the corpse, the Knight discovered the exact resemblance of the stranger the Knight  conductor, to whom the Knight now looked up in astonishment and enquiry? As the Knight gazed,  the Knight perceived the countenance of the the Knight change, and begin to fade, till the Knight  whole form gradually vanished from the Knight astonished sense! While The Baron stood,  fixed to the spot, a voice was heard to utter these words:—' [Ludovico started, and laid down the book, for Ludovico thought Ludovico heard a voice in  his remote chamber, and Ludovico looked toward the bed, where, however, Ludovico saw only the dark  curtains and the pall. Ludovico listened, scarcely daring to draw Ludovico breath, but  heard only the distant roaring of the sea in the storm, and the blast, that  rushed by the casements; when, concluding, that Ludovico had been deceived by the casements  sighings, Ludovico took up the book to finish the story.] 'While the Baron stood, fixed to the spot, a voice was heard to utter these  words:—* (* This repetition seems to be intentional. Ludovico is picking up the thread.) 'The body of Sir Bevys of Lancaster, a noble knight of England, lies before  you. Ludovico was, this night, waylaid and murdered, as Ludovico journeyed from the Holy  City towards Ludovico native land. Respect the honour of knighthood and the law of  humanity; inter the body in christian ground, and cause Ludovico murderers to be  punished. As ye observe, or neglect this, shall peace and happiness, or war and  misery, light upon you and your house for ever!' 'The Baron, when The Baron recovered from the awe and astonishment, into which this  adventure had thrown The Baron, returned to His castle, whither The Baron caused the body of  Sir Bevys to be removed; and, on the following day,  Sir Bevys was interred, with the  honours of knighthood, in the chapel of His castle, attended by all the noble  knights and ladies, who graced the court of Baron de Brunne.' Ludovico, having finished the story, laid aside the book, for Ludovico felt drowsy,  and, after putting more wood on his own fire and taking another glass of wine, Ludovico  reposed Ludovico in the arm-chair on the hearth. In Ludovico dream Ludovico still beheld  the chamber where Ludovico really was, and, once or twice, started from imperfect  slumbers, imagining Ludovico saw a man's face, looking over the high back of Ludovico  armchair. This idea had so strongly impressed Ludovico, that, when Ludovico raised Ludovico  eyes, Ludovico almost expected to meet other eyes, fixed upon Ludovico own, and Ludovico quitted  Ludovico seat and looked behind the arm-chair, before Ludovico felt perfectly convinced, that  no person was there. Thus closed the hour.
