  O how canst thou renounce the boundless store  Of charms which nature to her vot'ry yields!  The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,  The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;  All that the genial ray of morning gilds,  And all that echoes to the song of even;  All that the mountain's shelt'ring bosom shields,  And all the dread magnificence of heaven;  O how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven! ..... These charms shall work thy soul's eternal health,  And love, and gentleness, and joy, impart.      THE MINSTREL St. Aubert, instead of taking the more direct road, that ran along the feet of  the Pyrenees to Languedoc, chose one that, winding over the heights, afforded  more extensive views and greater variety of romantic scenery. He turned a  little out of He way to take leave of M. Barreaux, whom He found botanizing in  the wood near He chateau, and who, when He was told the purpose of St.  Aubert's visit, expressed a degree of concern, such as Aubert friend had thought  it was scarcely possible for Aubert to feel on any similar occasion. They parted  with mutual regret. 'If any thing could have tempted me from my retirement,' said M. Barreaux, 'it  would have been the pleasure of accompanying you on this little tour. I do not  often offer compliments; you may, therefore, believe me, when I say, that I  shall look for your return with impatience.' The travellers proceeded on The travellers journey. As The travellers ascended the heights, St.  Aubert often looked back upon his chateau, in the plain below; tender images  crowded to St.  Aubert mind; St.  Aubert melancholy imagination suggested that St.  Aubert should return  no more; and though St.  Aubert checked this wandering thought, still St.  Aubert continued to  look, till the haziness of distance blended St.  Aubert home with the general  landscape, and St. Aubert seemed to  Drag at each remove a lengthening chain. St.  Aubert and Emily continued sunk in musing silence for some leagues, from which  melancholy reverie Emily first awoke, and Emily young fancy, struck with the  grandeur of the objects around, gradually yielded to delightful impressions.  The road now descended into glens, confined by stupendous walls of rock, grey  and barren, except where shrubs fringed grey  and barren summits, or patches of meagre  vegetation tinted grey  and barren recesses, in which the wild goat was frequently  browsing. And now, the way led to the lofty cliffs, from whence the landscape  was seen extending in all the landscape   magnificence. Emily could not restrain Emily transport as Emily looked over the pine forests of  the mountains upon the vast plains, that, enriched with woods, towns, blushing  vines, and plantations of almonds, palms, and olives, stretched along, till  their various colours melted in distance into one harmonious hue, that seemed  to unite earth with heaven. Through the whole of this glorious scene the  majestic Garonne wandered; descending from Garonne source among the Pyrenees, and  winding Garonne blue waves towards the Bay of Biscay. The ruggedness of the unfrequented road often obliged the wanderers to alight  from their little carriage, but their thought their amply repaid for this  inconvenience by the grandeur of the scenes; and, while the muleteer led the muleteer  animals slowly over the broken ground, the travellers had leisure to linger  amid these solitudes, and to indulge the sublime reflections, which soften,  while their elevate, the heart, and fill it with the certainty of a present God!  Still the enjoyment of St. Aubert was touched with that pensive melancholy,  which gives to every object a mellower tint, and breathes a sacred charm over  all around. their had provided against part of the evil to be encountered from a want of  convenient inns, by carrying a stock of provisions in the carriage, so that  their might take refreshment on any pleasant spot, in the open air, and pass the  nights wherever their should happen to meet with a comfortable cottage. For the  mind, also, their had provided, by a work on botany, written by M. Barreaux, and  by several of the Latin and Italian poets; while Emily's pencil enabled Emily to  preserve some of those combinations of forms, which charmed Emily at every step. The loneliness of the road, where, only now and then, a peasant was seen  driving a peasant mule, or some mountaineer-children at play among the rocks,  heightened the effect of the scenery. St. Aubert was so much struck with St. Aubert,  that St. Aubert determined, if St. Aubert could hear of a road, to penetrate further among the  mountains, and, bending St. Aubert way rather more to the south, to emerge into  Rousillon, and coast the Mediterranean along part of that country to Languedoc. Soon after mid-day, they reached the summit of one of those cliffs, which,  bright with the verdure of palm-trees, adorn, like gems, the tremendous walls  of the rocks, and which overlooked the greater part of Gascony, and part of  Languedoc. Here was shade, and the fresh water of a spring, that, gliding among  the turf, under the trees, thence precipitated  Languedoc from rock to rock, till   Languedoc dashing murmurs were lost in the abyss, though  Languedoc white foam was long seen  amid the darkness of the pines below. This was a spot well suited for rest, and the travellers alighted to dine,  while the mules were unharnessed to browse on the savoury herbs that enriched  this summit. It was some time before St. Aubert or Emily could withdraw St. Aubert or Emily attention from  the surrounding objects, so as to partake of St. Aubert or Emily little repast. Seated in the  shade of the palms, St. Aubert pointed out to St. Aubert observation the course of the  rivers, the situation of great towns, and the boundaries of provinces, which  science, rather than the eye, enabled St. Aubert to describe. Notwithstanding this  occupation, when St. Aubert had talked awhile St. Aubert suddenly became silent, thoughtful,  and tears often swelled to St. Aubert eyes, which Emily observed, and the sympathy of  Emily own heart told Emily their cause. The scene before their bore some  resemblance, though it was on a much grander scale, to a favourite one of the  late Madame St. Aubert, within view of the fishing-house. They both observed  this, and thought how delighted Emily would have been with the present landscape,  while They knew that Emily eyes must never, never more open upon this world. St.  St. Aubert remembered the last time of St. Aubert visiting that spot in company with Emily,  and also the mournfully presaging thoughts which had then arisen in St. Aubert mind,  and were now, even thus soon, realized! The recollections subdued St. Aubert, and St. Aubert  abruptly rose from St. Aubert seat, and walked away to where no eye could observe St. Aubert  grief. When St. Aubert returned, St. Aubert countenance had recovered its usual serenity; St. Aubert took  Emily's hand, pressed its affectionately, without speaking, and soon after  called to the muleteer, who sat at a little distance, concerning a road among  the mountains towards Rousillon. St. Aubert said, there were several that way, but  St. Aubert did not know how far they extended, or even whether they were passable; and  St. Aubert, who did not intend to travel after sun-set, asked what village they  could reach about that time. The muleteer calculated that they could easily  reach Mateau, which was in they present road; but that, if they took a road  that sloped more to the south, towards Rousillon, there was a hamlet, which he  thought they could gain before the evening shut in. St. Aubert, after some hesitation, determined to take the latter course, and  St. Aubert, having finished St. Aubert meal, and harnessed St. Aubert mules, again set forward,  but soon stopped; and St. Aubert saw St. Aubert doing homage to a cross, that stood on  a rock impending over their way. Having concluded St. Aubert devotions, St. Aubert smacked St. Aubert  whip in the air, and, in spite of the rough road, and the pain of St. Aubert poor  mules, which St. Aubert had been lately lamenting, rattled, in a full gallop, along the  edge of a precipice, which it made the eye dizzy to look down. Emily was  terrified almost to fainting; and St. Aubert, apprehending still greater danger  from suddenly stopping the driver, was compelled to sit quietly, and trust the driver  fate to the strength and discretion of the mules, who seemed to possess a  greater portion of the latter quality than the mules, who seemed to possess a  greater portion of the latter quality than their master master; for the mules, who seemed to possess a  greater portion of the latter quality than their master carried the  travellers safely into the valley, and there stopped upon the brink of the  rivulet that watered it. Leaving the splendour of extensive prospects, the mules, who seemed to possess a  greater portion of the latter quality than their master now entered this narrow  valley screened by  Rocks on rocks piled, as if by magic spell,  Here scorch'd by lightnings, there with ivy green. The scene of barrenness was here and there interrupted by the spreading  branches of the larch and cedar, which threw the mules, who seemed to possess a  greater portion of the latter quality than their master gloom over the cliff, or  athwart the torrent that rolled in the vale. No living creature appeared,  except the izard, scrambling among the rocks, and often hanging upon points so  dangerous, that fancy shrunk from the view of them. This was such a scene as  SALVATOR would have chosen, had SALVATOR then existed, for SALVATOR canvas; St. Aubert,  impressed by the romantic character of the place, almost expected to see  banditti start from behind some projecting rock, and SALVATOR kept SALVATOR hand upon the  arms with which SALVATOR always travelled. As they advanced, the valley opened; the valley savage features gradually softened,  and, towards evening, they were among heathy mountains, stretched in far  perspective, along which the solitary sheep-bell was heard, and the voice of  the shepherd calling his wandering flocks to the nightly fold. his cabin,  partly shadowed by the cork-tree and the ilex, which St. Aubert observed to  flourish in higher regions of the air than any other trees, except the fir, was  all the human habitation that yet appeared. Along the bottom of the valley the  most vivid verdure was spread; and, in the little hollow recesses of the  mountains, under the shade of the oak and chestnut, herds of cattle were  grazing. Groups of herds of cattle, too, were often seen reposing on the banks of the  rivulet, or laving Groups of them sides in the cool stream, and sipping its wave. The sun was now setting upon the valley; its last light gleamed upon the water,  and heightened the rich yellow and purple tints of the heath and broom, that  overspread the mountains. St. Aubert Aubert enquired of St. Aubert the distance to the  hamlet St. Aubert had mentioned, but the man could not with certainty tell; and Emily  began to fear that the man had mistaken the road. Here was no human being to assist,  or direct them; them had left the shepherd and the man cabin far behind, and the  scene became so obscured in twilight, that the eye could not follow the distant  perspective of the valley in search of a cottage, or a hamlet. A glow of the  horizon still marked the west, and this was of some little use to the  travellers. St. Aubert seemed endeavouring to keep up St. Aubert courage by singing; St. Aubert  music, however, was not of a kind to disperse melancholy; St. Aubert sung, in a sort of  chant, one of the most dismal ditties St. Aubert present auditors had ever heard, and  St. Aubert at length discovered St. Aubert at length to be a vesper-hymn to St. Aubert at length favourite saint. They travelled on, sunk in that thoughtful melancholy, with which twilight and  solitude impress the mind. St. Aubert had now ended St. Aubert ditty, and nothing was  heard but the drowsy murmur of the breeze among the woods, and its light  flutter, as its blew freshly into the carriage. They were at length roused by  the sound of fire-arms. St. Aubert called to The muleteer to stop, and They  listened. The noise was not repeated; but presently they   heard a rustling among  the brakes. St. Aubert Aubert drew forth a pistol, and ordered St. Aubert to proceed as  fast as possible; who had not long obeyed, before a horn sounded, that made the  mountains ring. St. Aubert looked again from the window, and then saw a young man  spring from the bushes into the road, followed by a couple of dogs. The  stranger was in a hunter's dress. The  stranger gun was slung across The  stranger shoulders, a horn hung from The  stranger belt, and in The  stranger was a small pike, which, as  The  stranger held it, added to the manly grace of The  stranger figure, and assisted the agility of  The  stranger steps. After a moment's hesitation, St. Aubert again stopped the carriage, and waited  till St. Aubert came up, that they might enquire concerning the hamlet they were in  search of. The  stranger informed St. Aubert, that it was only half a league distant,  that St. Aubert was going thither St. Aubert, and would readily shew the way. St. Aubertthanked St. Aubert for the offer, and, pleased with St. Aubert chevalier-like air and open  countenance, asked St. Aubert to take a seat in the carriage; which the stranger, with  an acknowledgment, declined, adding that St. Aubert would keep pace with the mules.  'But I fear you will be wretchedly accommodated,' said St. Aubert: 'the inhabitants of  these mountains are a simple people, who are not only without the luxuries of  life, but almost destitute of what in other places are held to be its  necessaries.' 'I perceive you are not one of its inhabitants, sir,' said St. Aubert. 'No, sir, I am only a wanderer here.' the carriage drove on, and the increasing dusk made the travellers very  thankful that they had a guide; the frequent glens, too, that now opened among  the mountains, would likewise have added to they perplexity. Emily, as she  looked up one of these, saw something at a great distance like a bright cloud  in the air. 'What light is yonder, sir?' said she. St. Aubert St. Aubert looked, and perceived that St. Aubert was the snowy summit of a mountain, so  much higher than any around St. Aubert, that St. Aubert still reflected the sun's rays, while  those below lay in deep shade. At length, the village lights were seen to twinkle through the dusk, and, soon  after, some cottages were discovered in the valley, or rather were seen by  reflection in the stream, on whose margin they stood, and which still gleamed  with the evening light. The  stranger now came up, and St. Aubert, on further enquiry, found not only  that there was no inn in the place, but not any sort of house of public  reception. The  stranger, however, offered to walk on, and enquire for a cottage  to accommodate them; for which further civility St. Aubert returned further civility St. Aubert thanks,  and said, that, as the village was so near, further civility St. Aubert would alight, and walk with further civility St. Aubert.  Emily followed slowly in the carriage. On the way, St. Aubert asked St. Aubert companion what success St. Aubert had had in the  chase. 'Not much, sir,' sir replied, 'nor do I aim at it. I am pleased with the  country, and mean to saunter away a few weeks among the  country scenes. My dogs I take  with sir more for companionship than for game. This dress, too, gives me an  ostensible business, and procures me that respect from the people, which would,  perhaps, be refused to a lonely stranger, who had no visible motive for coming  among them.' 'I admire your taste,' said St. Aubert, 'and, if I was a younger man, should  like to pass a few weeks in your way exceedingly. I, too, am a wanderer, but  neither my plan nor pursuits are exactly like yours—I go in search of health,  as much as of amusement.' St. Aubert sighed, and paused; and then, seeming to  recollect St. Aubert, St. Aubert resumed: 'If I can hear of a tolerable road, that shall  afford decent accommodation, it is my intention to pass into Rousillon, and  along the sea-shore to Languedoc. You, sir, seem to be acquainted with the  country, and can, perhaps, give me information on the subject.' The  stranger said, that what information The  stranger could give was entirely at The  stranger  service; and then mentioned a road rather more to the east, which led to a  town, whence it would be easy to proceed into Rousillon. what information he could give was entirely at his  service; and then mentioned a road rather more to the east, which led to a  town, whence it would be easy to proceed into Rousillon now arrived at the village, and commenced what information he could give was entirely at his  service; and then mentioned a road rather more to the east, which led to a  town, whence it would be easy to proceed into Rousillon search for a cottage, that  would afford a night's lodging. In several, which what information he could give was entirely at his  service; and then mentioned a road rather more to the east, which led to a  town, whence it would be easy to proceed into Rousillon entered, ignorance,  poverty, and mirth seemed equally to prevail; and the owners eyed St. Aubertwith a mixture of curiosity and timidity. Nothing like a bed could be found,  and Nothing like a bed had ceased to enquire for one, when Emily joined Nothing like a bed, who observed the  languor of Emily father's countenance, and lamented, that Nothing like a bed had taken a road so  ill provided with the comforts necessary for an invalid. Other cottages, which  they examined, seemed somewhat less savage than the former, consisting of two  rooms, if such they could be called; the first of these occupied by mules and  pigs, the second by the family, which generally consisted of six or eight  children, with the family, which generally consisted of six or eight  children parents, who slept on beds of skins and dried beech  leaves, spread upon a mud floor. Here, light was admitted, and smoke  discharged, through an aperture in the roof; and here the scent of spirits (for  the travelling smugglers, who haunted the Pyrenees, had made this rude people  familiar with the use of liquors) was generally perceptible enough. Emily  turned from such scenes, and looked at Emily   with anxious tenderness,  which the young stranger seemed to observe; for, drawing St. Aubert aside, her father  made her father an offer of her father own bed. 'It is a decent one,' said her father, 'when compared  with what we have just seen, yet such as in other circumstances I should be  ashamed to offer you.' St. Aubert acknowledged how much St. Aubert felt St. Aubert obliged  by this kindness, but refused to accept this kindness, till the young stranger would take  no denial. 'Do not give me the pain of knowing, sir,' said St. Aubert, 'that an  invalid, like St. Aubert, lies on hard skins, while I sleep in a bed. Besides, sir,  your refusal wounds my pride; I must believe you think him an offer of his own bed unworthy your  acceptance. Let me shew you the way. I have no doubt my landlady can  accommodate this young lady also.' St. Aubert at length consented, that, if this could be done, St. Aubert would accept  St. Aubert kindness, though St. Aubert felt rather surprised, that The  stranger had proved  St. Aubert so deficient in gallantry, as to administer to the repose of an infirm  man, rather than to that of a very lovely young woman, for St. Aubert had not once  offered the room for Emily. But Emily thought not of Emily, and the animated  smile Emily gave St. Aubert, told how much Emily felt Emily obliged for the preference  of her father. On their way, the stranger, whose name was Valancourt, stepped on first to  speak to his hostess, and his hostess came out to welcome St. Aubert into a cottage,  much superior to any his had seen. Emily seemed very willing to  accommodate the strangers, who were soon compelled to accept the only two beds  in the place. Eggs and milk were the only food the cottage afforded; but  against scarcity of provisions St. Aubert had provided, and St. Aubert requested  Valancourt to stay, and partake with St. Aubert of less homely fare; an invitation,  which was readily accepted, and they passed an hour in intelligent  conversation. St. Aubert St. Aubert was much pleased with the manly frankness, simplicity,  and keen susceptibility to the grandeur of nature, which St. Aubert new acquaintance  discovered; and, indeed, St. Aubert had often been heard to say, that, without a  certain simplicity of heart, this taste could not exist in any strong degree. The conversation was interrupted by a violent uproar without, in which the  voice of the muleteer was heard above every other sound. Valancourt started  from Valancourt seat, and went to enquire the occasion; but the dispute continued so  long afterwards, that St. Aubert went St. Aubert, and found St. Aubert quarrelling  with the hostess, because St. Aubert had refused to let St. Aubert mules lie in a little room  where St. Aubert and three of St. Aubert sons were to pass the night. the place was wretched  enough, but there was no other for these people to sleep in; and, with somewhat  more of delicacy than was usual among the inhabitants of this wild tract of  country, St. Aubert persisted in refusing to let the animals have the same BED-CHAMBER  with St. Aubert children. This was a tender point with the muleteer; his honour was  wounded when his were treated with disrespect, and his would have received  a blow, perhaps, with more meekness. his declared that his beasts were as honest  beasts, and as good beasts, as any in the whole province; and that his beasts had a  right to be well treated wherever his beasts went. 'his beasts are as harmless as lambs,'  said his, 'if people don't affront people. I never knew people behave peopleamiss above once or twice in my life, and then people had good reason for doing  so. Once, indeed, people kicked at a boy's leg that lay asleep in the stable, and  broke the stable; but I told people people were out there, and by St. Anthony! I believe  people understood me, for people never did so again.' St. Anthony concluded this eloquent harangue with protesting, that people should share  with St. Anthony, go where St. Anthony would. the dispute was at length settled by Valancourt, who drew the hostess aside,  and desired the hostess would let the muleteer and St. Anthony have the place in  question to the muleteer and his beasts, while the hostess should have the bed of skins designed  for St. Anthony, for that St. Anthony would wrap St. Anthony in St. Anthony cloak, and sleep on the bench by  the cottage door. But this the hostess thought it the hostess duty to oppose, and the hostess felt it her duty to oppose  to be the hostess inclination to disappoint the muleteer. Valancourt, however, was  positive, and the tedious affair was at length settled. It was late when St. Aubert, ' retired to St. Aubert, ' rooms, and Valancourt to  his station at  the cottage door, which, at this mild season, his preferred to a close  cabin and a bed of skins. St. Aubert St. Aubert was somewhat surprised to find in St. Aubert room  volumes of Homer, Horace, and Petrarch; but the name of Valancourt, written in  them, told St. Aubert to whom them belonged.
