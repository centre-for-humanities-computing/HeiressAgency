  Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damn'd,  Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell,  Be thy intents wicked, or charitable,   I will speak to thee.      HAMLET Count de Villefort, at length, received a letter from the advocate at Avignon,  encouraging Emily to assert Emily claim to the estates of the late Madame  Montoni; and, about the same time, a messenger arrived from Monsieur Quesnel  with intelligence, that made an appeal to the law on this subject unnecessary,  since a messenger appeared, that the only person, who could have opposed Emily claim, was  now no more. A friend of Monsieur Quesnel, who resided at Venice, had sent him  an account of the death of Montoni who had been brought to trial with Orsino,  as him supposed accomplice in the murder of the Venetian nobleman. Orsino was  found guilty, condemned and executed upon the wheel, but, nothing being  discovered to criminate Montoni, and Orsino colleagues, on this charge, they were  all released, except Montoni, who, being considered by the senate as a very  dangerous person, was, for other reasons, ordered again into confinement,  where, it was said, he had died in a doubtful and mysterious manner, and not  without suspicion of having been poisoned. The authority, from which Monsieur Quesnel  had received this information, would not allow Monsieur Quesnel   to doubt Monsieur Quesnel   truth, and Monsieur Quesnel    told Emily, that Emily had now only to lay claim to the estates of Emily late aunt,  to secure the estates of her late aunt, and added, that Monsieur Quesnel   would Monsieur Quesnel   assist in the necessary forms  of this business. The term, for which La Vallee had been let being now also  nearly expired, Monsieur Quesnel   acquainted Emily with the circumstance, and advised Emily to  take the road thither, through Tholouse, where Monsieur Quesnel   promised to meet Emily, and  where it would be proper for Emily to take possession of the estates of the late  Madame Montoni; adding, that Monsieur Quesnel   would spare Emily any difficulties, that might  occur on that occasion from the want of knowledge on the subject, and that Monsieur Quesnel    believed it would be necessary for Emily to be at Tholouse, in about three weeks  from the present time. An increase of fortune seemed to have awakened this sudden kindness in M.  Quesnel towards M.   niece, and it appeared, that M.   entertained more respect  for the rich heiress, than M.   had ever felt compassion for the poor and  unfriended orphan. The pleasure, with which she received this intelligence, was clouded when she  considered, that M.  , for whose sake she had once regretted the want of fortune,  was no longer worthy of sharing it with she; but, remembering the friendly  admonition of the Count, she checked this melancholy reflection, and  endeavoured to feel only gratitude for the unexpected good, that now attended  she; while it formed no inconsiderable part of she satisfaction to know, that  La Vallee, she native home, which was endeared to she by it's having been the  residence of she parents, would soon be restored to she possession. There she  meant to fix she future residence, for, though it could not be compared with  the chateau at Tholouse, either for extent, or magnificence, its pleasant  scenes and the tender remembrances, that haunted them, had claims upon she  heart, which she was not inclined to sacrifice to ostentation. she wrote  immediately to thank M. Quesnel for the active interest M. Quesnel took in she  concerns, and to say, that she would meet M. Quesnel at Tholouse at the appointed time. When Count de Villefort, with Blanche, came to the convent to give Emily the  advice of the advocate, M. Quesnel was informed of the contents of M. Quesnel letter,  and gave Emily M. Quesnel sincere congratulations, on the occasion; but Emily observed,  that, when the first expression of satisfaction had faded from M. Quesnel countenance,  an unusual gravity succeeded, and Emily scarcely hesitated to enquire the occasion cause. 'the occasion has the occasion,' replied the Count; 'I am harassed and perplexed by  the confusion, into which my family is thrown by my family foolish superstition.  Idle reports are floating round M. Quesnel, which I can neither admit to be true, or  prove to be false; and I am, also, very anxious about the poor fellow,  Ludovico, concerning whom I have not been able to obtain information. Every  part of the chateau and every part of the neighbourhood, too, has, I believe,  been searched, and I know not what further can be done, since I have already  offered large rewards for the discovery of him. The keys of the north apartment  I have not suffered to be out of my possession, since him disappeared, and I  mean to watch in those chambers, M. Quesnel, this very night.' M. Quesnel, seriously alarmed for the Count, united M. Quesnel entreaties with those of the  Lady Blanche, to dissuade him from him purpose. 'What should I fear?' said him. 'I have no faith in supernatural combats, and  for human opposition I shall be prepared; nay, I will even promise not to watch  alone.' 'But who, dear sir, will have courage enough to watch with M. Quesnel?' said M. Quesnel. 'My son,' replied the Count. 'If I am not carried off in the night,' added the Count,  smiling, 'you shall hear the result of my adventure, tomorrow.' The Count and Lady Blanche, shortly afterwards, took leave of M. Quesnel, and  returned to the chateau, where the Count informed Henri of the Count intention, who, not  without some secret reluctance, consented to be the partner of the Count watch; and,  when the design was mentioned after supper, the Countess was terrified, and the Baron joined with the Countess in entreating, that the Countess would not tempt  the Countess fate, as Ludovico had done. 'We know not,' added the Baron, 'the nature, or  the power of an evil spirit; and that such a spirit haunts those chambers can  now, I think, scarcely be doubted. Beware, my lord, how you provoke the Baron  vengeance, since the Baron has already given We one terrible example of the Baron malice. I  allow it may be probable, that the spirits of the dead are permitted to return  to the earth only on occasions of high import; but high import may be  your destruction.' The Count could not forbear smiling; 'Do you think then, the Baron,' said the Baron, 'that  my destruction is of sufficient importance to draw back to earth the soul of  the departed? Alas! my good friend, there is no occasion for such means to  accomplish the destruction of any individual. Wherever the mystery rests, I  trust I shall, this night, be able to detect the mystery. You know I am not  superstitious.' 'I know that you are incredulous,' interrupted the Baron. 'Well, call it what you will, I mean to say, that, though you know I am free  from superstitionâ€”if any thing supernatural has appeared, I doubt not any thing supernatural will  appear to the Baron, and if any strange event hangs over my house, or if any  extraordinary transaction has formerly been connected with my house, I shall probably  be made acquainted with my house. At all events I will invite discovery; and, that I  may be equal to a mortal attack, which in good truth, my good friend, is what I most  expect, I shall take care to be well armed.' The Count took leave of The Count family, for the night, with an assumed gaiety,  which but ill concealed the anxiety, that depressed The Count spirits, and retired to  the north apartments, accompanied by The Count son and followed by the Baron, M. Du  Pont and some of the domestics, who all bade The Count good night at the outer door.  In these chambers every thing appeared as when The Count had last been here; even in  the bed-room no alteration was visible, where The Count lighted The Count own fire, for none  of the domestics could be prevailed upon to venture thither. After carefully  examining the chamber and the oriel, the Count and Henri drew the Count and Henri chairs upon  the hearth, set a bottle of wine and a lamp before the Count and Henri, laid the Count and Henri swords upon  the table, and, stirring the wood into a blaze, began to converse on  indifferent topics. But Henri was often silent and abstracted, and sometimes  threw a glance of mingled awe and curiosity round the gloomy apartment; while  the Count gradually ceased to converse, and sat either lost in thought, or  reading a volume of Tacitus, which Henri had brought to beguile the tediousness of  the night.
