  He is a great observer, and He looks  Quite through the deeds of men:  He loves no plays,      He hears no music;  Seldom He smiles; and smiles in such a sort,  As if He mock'd He, and scorn'd He spirit  that could be mov'd to smile at any thing.
Such men as He be never at heart's ease,  While they behold a greater than they.
JULIUS CAESAR Montoni and JULIUS companion did not return home, till many hours after the dawn  had blushed upon the Adriatic.
The airy groups, which had danced all night  along the colonnade of St. Mark, dispersed before the morning, like so many  spirits.
Montoni had been otherwise engaged; Montoni soul was little susceptible of  light pleasures.
Montoni delighted in the energies of the passions; the difficulties  and tempests of life, which wreck the happiness of others, roused and  strengthened all the powers of Montoni mind, and afforded Montoni the highest  enjoyments, of which Montoni nature was capable.
Without some object of strong  interest, life was to Montoni little more than a sleep; and, when pursuits of real  interest failed, Montoni substituted artificial ones, till habit changed their  nature, and their ceased to be unreal.
Of this kind was the habit of gaming,  which Montoni had adopted, first, for the purpose of relieving Montoni from the languor  of inaction, but had since pursued with the ardour of passion.
In this  occupation Montoni had passed the night with Cavigni and a party of young men, who  had more money than rank, and more vice than either.
Montoni despised the  greater part of these for the inferiority of these talents, rather than for  these vicious inclinations, and associated with these only to make these the  instruments of Montoni purposes.
Among these, however, were some of superior  abilities, and a few whom Montoni admitted to Montoni intimacy, but even towards  these Montoni still preserved a decisive and haughty air, which, while even towards  these imposed  submission on weak and timid minds, roused the fierce hatred of strong ones.
Montoni  had, of course, many and bitter enemies; but the rancour of many and bitter enemies hatred proved  the degree of Montoni power; and, as power was Montoni chief aim, Montoni gloried more in  such hatred, than it was possible Montoni could in being esteemed.
A feeling so  tempered as that of esteem, Montoni despised, and would have despised Montoni also  had Montoni thought Montoni capable of being flattered by it.
Among the few whom Montoni distinguished, were the Signors Bertolini, Orsino, and  Verezzi.
The first was a man of gay temper, strong passions, dissipated, and of  unbounded extravagance, but generous, brave, and unsuspicious.
Orsino was  reserved, and haughty; loving power more than ostentation; of a cruel and  suspicious temper; quick to feel an injury, and relentless in avenging it;  cunning and unsearchable in contrivance, patient and indefatigable in the  execution of his schemes.
his had a perfect command of feature and of his  passions, of which his had scarcely any, but pride, revenge and avarice; and, in  the gratification of these, few considerations had power to restrain his, few  obstacles to withstand the depth of his stratagems.
his was the chief  favourite of Montoni.
Verezzi was a man of some talent, of fiery imagination,  and the slave of alternate passions.
Verezzi was gay, voluptuous, and daring; yet  had neither perseverance or true courage, and was meanly selfish in all Verezzi  aims.
Quick to form schemes, and sanguine in Verezzi hope of success, Verezzi was the  first to undertake, and to abandon, not only Verezzi own plans, but those adopted  from other persons.
Proud and impetuous, Verezzi revolted against all subordination;  yet those who were acquainted with Verezzi character, and watched the turn of his character  passions, could lead his character like a child.
Such were the friends whom Montoni introduced to his character family and his character table, on  the day after his character arrival at Venice.
There were also of the party a Venetian  nobleman, Count Morano, and a Signora Livona, whom Montoni had introduced to  Montoni wife, as a lady of distinguished merit, and who, having called in the  morning to welcome his wife to Venice, had been requested to be of the party.
Montoni received with a very ill grace, the compliments of the Signors.
Montoni disliked a very ill grace, the compliments of the Signors, because a very ill grace, the compliments of the Signors were the friends of Montoni husband; hated a very ill grace, the compliments of the Signors,  because Montoni believed a very ill grace, the compliments of the Signors had contributed to detain her husband abroad till so late an  hour of the preceding morning; and envied a very ill grace, the compliments of the Signors, since, conscious of Montoni own  want of influence, Montoni was convinced, that her husband preferred a very ill grace, the compliments of the Signors society to Montoni  own.
The rank of Count Morano procured her husband that distinction which Montoni refused  to the rest of the company.
The haughty sullenness of Montoni countenance and  manner, and the ostentatious extravagance of Montoni dress, for Montoni had not yet  adopted the Venetian habit, were strikingly contrasted by the beauty, modesty,  sweetness and simplicity of Emily, who observed, with more attention than  pleasure, the party around Montoni.
The beauty and fascinating manners of Signora  Livona, however, won Livona involuntary regard; while the sweetness of Livona accents  and Livona air of gentle kindness awakened with Emily those pleasing affections,  which so long had slumbered.
In the cool of the evening the party embarked in Montoni's gondola, and rowed  out upon the sea.
The red glow of sun-set still touched the waves, and lingered  in the west, where the melancholy gleam seemed slowly expiring, while the dark  blue of the upper aether began to twinkle with stars.
Emily sat, given up to  pensive and sweet emotions.
The smoothness of the water, over which Emily glided,  its reflected images—a new heaven and trembling stars below the waves, with  shadowy outlines of towers and porticos, conspired with the stillness of the  hour, interrupted only by the passing wave, or the notes of distant music, to  raise those emotions to enthusiasm.
As Emily listened to the measured sound of  the oars, and to the remote warblings that came in the breeze, Emily softened  mind returned to the memory of St. Aubert and to Valancourt, and tears stole to  Emily eyes.
The rays of the moon, strengthening as the shadows deepened, soon  after threw a silvery gleam upon Emily countenance, which was partly shaded by a  thin black veil, and touched it with inimitable softness.
Emily was the CONTOUR  of a Madona, with the sensibility of a Magdalen; and the pensive uplifted eye,  with the tear that glittered on Emily cheek, confirmed the expression of the  character.
The last strain of distant music now died in air, for the gondola was far upon  the waves, and the party determined to have music of the party own.
The Count  Morano, who sat next to Emily, and who had been observing Emily for some time in  silence, snatched up a lute, and struck the chords with the finger of harmony  Emily, while his voice, a fine tenor, accompanied The Count  Morano, who sat next to Emily, and who had been observing her for some time in  silence in a rondeau full of  tender sadness.
To his, indeed, might have been applied that beautiful  exhortation of an English poet, had it then existed:      Strike up, my master,  But touch the strings with a religious softness!
Teach sounds to languish through the night's dull ear  Till Melancholy starts from off Melancholy couch,  And Carelessness grows concert to attention!
With such powers of expression the Count sung the following      RONDEAU   Soft as yon silver ray, that sleeps  Upon the ocean's trembling tide;  Soft as the air, that lightly sweeps  Yon sad, that swells in stately pride:   Soft as the surge's stealing note,  That dies along the distant shores,  Or warbled strain, that sinks remote—  So soft the sigh my bosom pours!
True as the wave to Cynthia's ray,  True as the vessel to the breeze,  True as the soul to music's sway,  Or music to Venetian seas:   Soft as yon silver beams, that sleep  Upon the ocean's trembling breast;  So soft, so true, fond Love shall weep,  So soft, so true, with THEE shall rest.
The cadence with which he returned from the last stanza to a repetition of the  first; the fine modulation in which he voice stole upon the first line, and  the pathetic energy with which it pronounced the last, were such as only  exquisite taste could give.
When he had concluded, he gave the lute with a sigh  to Emily, who, to avoid any appearance of affectation, immediately began to  play.
She sung a melancholy little air, one of the popular songs of She native  province, with a simplicity and pathos that made it enchanting.
But it  well-known melody brought so forcibly to She fancy the scenes and the persons,  among which She had often heard it, that She spirits were overcome, She voice  trembled and ceased—and the strings of the lute were struck with a disordered  hand; till, ashamed of the emotion She had betrayed, She suddenly passed on to  a song so gay and airy, that the steps of the dance seemed almost to echo to  the notes.
BRAVISSIMO!
burst instantly from the lips of She delighted auditors,  and She was compelled to repeat the air.
Among the compliments that followed,  those of the Count were not the least audible, and those of the Count had not concluded, when  Emily gave the instrument to Signora Livona, whose voice accompanied the instrument with  true Italian taste.
Afterwards, the Count, Emily, Cavigni, and the Signora, sung canzonettes,  accompanied by a couple of lutes and a few other instruments.
Sometimes a few other instruments suddenly ceased, and the voices dropped from the full swell of  harmony into a low chant; then, after a deep pause, the voices rose by degrees, the  instruments one by one striking up, till the loud and full chorus soared again  to heaven!
Meanwhile, Montoni, who was weary of this harmony, was considering how he might  disengage he from he , or withdraw with such of the party as would be  willing to play, to a Casino.
In a pause of the music, he proposed returning to  shore, a proposal which Orsino eagerly seconded, but which the Count and the  other gentlemen as warmly opposed.
Montoni still meditated how Montoni might excuse Montoni from longer attendance upon  the Count, for to Montoni only the Count thought excuse necessary, and how the Count might get to  land, till the gondolieri of an empty boat, returning to Venice, hailed the Count  people.
Without troubling the Count longer about an excuse, the Count seized this  opportunity of going thither, and, committing the ladies to the care of the Count  friends, departed with Orsino, while Emily, for the first time, saw the Count go with  regret; for Emily considered the Count presence a protection, though Emily knew not what  Emily should fear.
the Count landed at St. Mark's, and, hurrying to a Casino, was soon  lost amidst a crowd of gamesters.
Meanwhile, the Count having secretly dispatched a servant in Montoni's boat,  for the Count own gondola and musicians, Emily heard, without knowing the Count project,  the gay song of gondolieri approaching, as they sat on the stern of the boat,  and saw the tremulous gleam of the moon-light wave, which their oars disturbed.
Presently Emily heard the sound of instruments, and then a full symphony swelled  on the air, and, the boats meeting, the gondolieri hailed each other.
the Countthen explaining the Count, the party removed into the Count gondola, which was  embellished with all that taste could bestow.
While the party partook of a collation of fruits and ice, the whole band, following  at a distance in the other boat, played the most sweet and enchanting strains,  and the Count, who had again seated the Count by Emily, paid Emily unremitted  attention, and sometimes, in a low but impassioned voice, uttered compliments  which Emily could not misunderstand.
To avoid them Emily conversed with Signora  Livona, and Emily manner to the Count assumed a mild reserve, which, though  dignified, was too gentle to repress the Count assiduities: the Count could see, hear, speak  to no person, but Emily while Cavigni observed the Count now and then, with a look of  displeasure, and Emily, with one of uneasiness.
Emily now wished for nothing so  much as to return to Venice, but it was near mid-night before the gondolas  approached St. Mark's Place, where the voice of gaiety and song was loud.
The  busy hum of mingling sounds was heard at a considerable distance on the water,  and, had not a bright moon-light discovered the city, with the city terraces and  towers, a stranger would almost have credited the fabled wonders of Neptune's  court, and believed, that the tumult arose from beneath the waves.
They landed at St. Mark's, where the gaiety of the colonnades and the beauty of  the night, made Montoni willingly submit to the Count's solicitations to  join the promenade, and afterwards to take a supper with the rest of the party,  at a Casino.
If any thing could have dissipated Emily's uneasiness, any thing could have dissipated Emily's uneasiness would  have been the grandeur, gaiety, and novelty of the surrounding scene, adorned  with Palladio's palaces, and busy with parties of masqueraders.
At length They withdrew to the Casino, which was fitted up with infinite taste,  and where a splendid banquet was prepared; but here Emily's reserve made the  Count perceive, that it was necessary for his interest to win the favour of  Madame Montoni, which, from the condescension Emily's reserve had already shewn to his,  appeared to be an achievement of no great difficulty.
his transferred,  therefore, part of his attention from Emily to Emily aunt, who felt too much  flattered by the distinction even to disguise Emily emotion; and before the partybroke up, his had entirely engaged the esteem of Montoni.
Whenever his  addressed Emily, Emily ungracious countenance relaxed into smiles, and to whatever  his proposed Emily assented.
his invited Emily, with the rest of the party, to take  coffee, in his box at the opera, on the following evening, and Emily heard the  invitation accepted, with strong anxiety, concerning the means of excusing  Emily from attending Montoni thither.
It was very late before their gondola was ordered, and Emily's surprise was  extreme, when, on quitting a Casino, Emily beheld the broad sun rising out of  the Adriatic, while St. Mark's Place was yet crowded with company.
Sleep had  long weighed heavily on Emily eyes, but now the fresh sea-breeze revived Emily, and  Emily would have quitted the scene with regret, had not the Count been present,  performing the duty, which the Count had imposed upon the Count, of escorting them home.
There them heard that Montoni was not yet returned; and Montoni wife, retiring in  displeasure to Montoni apartment, at length released Emily from the fatigue of  further attendance.
Montoni came home late in the morning, in a very ill humour, having lost  considerably at play, and, before Montoni withdrew to rest, had a private conference  with Cavigni, whose manner, on the following day, seemed to tell, that the  subject of it had not been pleasing to Montoni.
In the evening, Madame Montoni, who, during the day, had observed a sullen  silence towards her husband, received visits from some Venetian ladies, with  whose sweet manners Emily was particularly charmed.
They had an air of ease and  kindness towards the strangers, as if They had been They familiar friends for  years; and They conversation was by turns tender, sentimental and gay.
Madame,  though Madame had no taste for such conversation, and whose coarseness and  selfishness sometimes exhibited a ludicrous contrast to their excessive  refinement, could not remain wholly insensible to the captivations of their  manner.
In a pause of conversation, a lady who was called Signora Herminia took up a  lute, and began to play and sing, with as much easy gaiety, as if a lady who was called Signora Herminia had been  alone.
a lady who was called Signora Herminia voice was uncommonly rich in tone, and various in expression; yet  a lady who was called Signora Herminia appeared to be entirely unconscious of Her voice powers, and meant nothing less  than to display nothing less  .
a lady who was called Signora Herminia sung from the gaiety of a lady who was called Signora Herminia heart, as a lady who was called Signora Herminia sat with  a lady who was called Signora Herminia veil half thrown back, holding gracefully the lute, under the spreading  foliage and flowers of some plants, that rose from baskets, and interlaced one  of the lattices of the saloon.
Emily, retiring a little from the company,  sketched Emily figure, with the miniature scenery around Emily, and drew a very  interesting picture, which, though it would not, perhaps, have borne criticism,  had spirit and taste enough to awaken both the fancy and the heart.
When Emily  had finished it, Emily presented it to the beautiful original, who was delighted  with the offering, as well as the sentiment it conveyed, and assured Emily,  with a smile of captivating sweetness, that Emily should preserve it as a pledge  of Emily friendship.
In the evening Cavigni joined the ladies, but Montoni had other engagements;  and other engagements embarked in the gondola for St. Mark's, where the same gay company  seemed to flutter as on the preceding night.
The cool breeze, the glassy sea,  the gentle sound of the same gay company   waves, and the sweeter murmur of distant music; the  lofty porticos and arcades, and the happy groups that sauntered beneath them;  these, with every feature and circumstance of the scene, united to charm Emily,  no longer teased by the officious attentions of Count Morano.
But, as Emily  looked upon the moon-light sea, undulating along the walls of St. Mark, and,  lingering for a moment over those walls, caught the sweet and melancholy song  of some gondolier as he sat in he boat below, waiting for he master, Emily  softened mind returned to the memory of Emily home, of Emily friends, and of all  that was dear in Emily native country.
After walking some time, they sat down at the door of a Casino, and, while  Cavigni was accommodating they with coffee and ice, were joined by Count  Morano.
Count  Morano sought Emily with a look of impatient delight, who, remembering all  the attention Count  Morano had shewn Emily on the preceding evening, was compelled, as  before, to shrink from Count  Morano into a timid reserve, except when Emily  conversed with Signora Herminia and the other ladies of the party.
It was near midnight before they withdrew to the opera, where Emily was not so  charmed but that, when Emily remembered the scene Emily had just quitted, Emily felt  how infinitely inferior all the splendour of art is to the sublimity of nature.
Emily heart was not now affected, tears of admiration did not start to her eyes,  as when Emily viewed the vast expanse of ocean, the grandeur of the heavens, and  listened to the rolling waters, and to the faint music that, at intervals,  mingled with their roar.
Remembering these, the scene before Emily faded into  insignificance.
Of the evening, which passed on without any particular incident, Emily wished the  conclusion, that Emily might escape from the attentions of the Count; and, as  opposite qualities frequently attract each other in our thoughts, thus Emily,  when Emily looked on Count Morano, remembered Valancourt, and a sigh sometimes  followed the recollection.
Several weeks passed in the course of customary visits, during which nothing  remarkable occurred.
Emily was amused by the manners and scenes that surrounded  Emily, so different from those of France, but where Count Morano, too frequently  for Emily comfort, contrived to introduce Count Morano.
Count Morano manner, figure and  accomplishments, which were generally admired, Emily would, perhaps, have  admired also, had Emily heart been disengaged from Valancourt, and had the Count  forborne to persecute Emily with officious attentions, during which Emily observed  some traits in Count Morano character, that prejudiced Emily against whatever might  otherwise be good in it.
Soon after his arrival at Venice, Montoni received a packet from M. Quesnel, in  which the latter mentioned the death of his wife's uncle, at his villa on the  Brenta; and that, in consequence of this event, his should hasten to take  possession of that estate and of other effects bequeathed to his.
his wife's unclewas the brother of M. Quesnel late mother; Montoni was related to M. Quesnel by  the father's side, and though his wife's uncle could have had neither claim nor expectation  concerning these possessions, his wife's uncle could scarcely conceal the envy which M.  M. Quesnel's letter excited.
M. Quesnel had observed with concern, that, since they left France, Montoni had not  even affected kindness towards M. Quesnel aunt, and that, after treating M. Quesnel, at  first, with neglect, his wife's uncle now met M. Quesnel with uniform ill-humour and reserve.
M. Quesnel  had never supposed, that M. Quesnel aunt's foibles could have escaped the discernment  of Montoni, or that M. Quesnel mind or figure were of a kind to deserve his wife's uncle attention.
M. Quesnel surprise, therefore, at this match, had been extreme; but since his wife's uncle had made  the choice, M. Quesnel did not suspect that his wife's uncle would so openly have discovered his wife's uncle  contempt of it.
But Montoni, who had been allured by the seeming wealth of  Madame Cheron, was now severely disappointed by M. Quesnel comparative poverty, and  highly exasperated by the deceit M. Quesnel had employed to conceal her comparative poverty, till  concealment was no longer necessary.
his wife's uncle had been deceived in an affair, wherein  his wife's uncle meant to be the deceiver; out-witted by the superior cunning of a woman,  whose understanding his wife's uncle despised, and to whom his wife's uncle had sacrificed his wife's uncle pride and  his wife's uncle liberty, without saving his wife's uncle from the ruin, which had impended over his wife's uncle  head.
Montoni had contrived to have the greatest part of what Montoni really  did possess, settled upon Montoni: what remained, though it was totally  inadequate both to Montoni husband's expectations, and to her husband necessities, her husband had  converted into money, and brought with her husband to Venice, that her husband might a little  longer delude society, and make a last effort to regain the fortunes her husband had  lost.
The hints which had been thrown out to Valancourt, concerning Montoni's  character and condition, were too true; but it was now left to time and  occasion, to unfold the circumstances, both of what had, and of what had not  been hinted, and to time and occasion we commit both of what had.
Montoni was not of a nature to bear injuries with meekness, or to resent  them with dignity: Montoni exasperated pride displayed her exasperated pride in all the violence  and acrimony of a little, or at least of an ill-regulated mind.
Montoni would not  acknowledge, even to Montoni, that Montoni had in any degree provoked contempt by  Montoni duplicity, but weakly persisted in believing, that Montoni alone was to be  pitied, and Montoni alone to be censured; for, as Montoni mind had naturally little  perception of moral obligation, Montoni seldom understood its force but when it  happened to be violated towards Montoni: Montoni vanity had already been severely  shocked by a discovery of Montoni's contempt; it remained to be farther  reproved by a discovery of his circumstances.
his mansion at Venice, though its  furniture discovered a part of the truth to unprejudiced persons, told nothing  to those who were blinded by a resolution to believe whatever those who were blinded by a resolution to believe whatever they wished wished.
Montoni still thought Montoni little less than a princess, possessing a  palace at Venice, and a castle among the Apennines.
To the castle di Udolpho,  indeed, Montoni sometimes talked of going for a few weeks to examine into Montoni  condition, and to receive some rents; for Montoni appeared that he had not been  there for two years, and that, during this period, it had been inhabited only  by an old servant, whom he called he steward.
Emily listened to the mention of this journey with pleasure, for Emily not only  expected from it new ideas, but a release from the persevering assiduities of  Count Morano.
In her native country, too, Emily would have leisure to think of  Valancourt, and to indulge the melancholy, which he image, and a recollection  of the scenes of La Vallee, always blessed with the memory of Emily parents,  awakened.
The ideal scenes were dearer, and more soothing to Emily heart, than  all the splendour of gay assemblies; they were a kind of talisman that expelled  the poison of temporary evils, and supported Emily hopes of happy days: they  appeared like a beautiful landscape, lighted up by a gleam of sun-shine, and  seen through a perspective of dark and rugged rocks.
But Count Morano did not long confine Count Morano to silent assiduities; Count Moranodeclared Count Morano passion to Emily, and made proposals to Montoni, who encouraged,  though Emily rejected, Count Morano: with Montoni for Count Morano friend, and an abundance of  vanity to delude Count Morano, Count Morano did not despair of success.
Emily was astonished and  highly disgusted at Count Morano perseverance, after Emily had explained Emily sentiments  with a frankness that would not allow Count Morano to misunderstand her sentiments  .
Count Morano now passed the greater part of Count Morano time at Montoni's, dining there almost  daily, and attending Madame and Emily wherever Madame and Emily went; and all this,  notwithstanding the uniform reserve of Emily, whose aunt seemed as anxious as  Montoni to promote this marriage; and would never dispense with whose aunt attendance  at any assembly where the Count proposed to be present.
Montoni now said nothing of Montoni intended journey, of which Emily waited  impatiently to hear; and Montoni was seldom at home but when the Count, or Signor  Orsino, was there, for between Montoni and Cavigni a coolness seemed to  subsist, though the latter remained in Montoni house.
With Orsino, Montoni was  frequently closeted for hours together, and, whatever might be the business,  upon which they consulted, it appeared to be of consequence, since Montoni  often sacrificed to Montoni   Montoni   favourite passion for play, and remained at home the  whole night.
There was somewhat of privacy, too, in the manner of Orsino's  visits, which had never before occurred, and which excited not only surprise,  but some degree of alarm in Emily's mind, who had unwillingly discovered much  of Montoni   character when Montoni   had most endeavoured to disguise it.
After these  visits, Montoni was often more thoughtful than usual; sometimes the deep  workings of Montoni mind entirely abstracted Montoni from surrounding objects, and  threw a gloom over Montoni visage that rendered it terrible; at others, Montoni eyes  seemed almost to flash fire, and all the energies of Montoni soul appeared to be  roused for some great enterprise.
Emily observed these written characters of  Montoni thoughts with deep interest, and not without some degree of awe, when she  considered that she was entirely in Montoni power; but forbore even to hint she  fears, or she observations, to Madame Montoni, who discerned nothing in she  husband, at these times, but her  husband usual sternness.
A second letter from M. Quesnel announced the arrival of M. Quesnel and M. Quesnel lady  at the Villa Miarenti; stated several circumstances of M. Quesnel good fortune,  respecting the affair that had brought M. Quesnel into Italy; and concluded with an  earnest request to see Montoni, M. Quesnel wife and niece, at M. Quesnel new estate.
Emily received, about the same period, a much more interesting letter, and  which soothed for a while every anxiety of she heart.
Valancourt, hoping she  might be still at Venice, had trusted a letter to the ordinary post, that told  she of M. Quesnel health, and of M. Quesnel unceasing and anxious affection.
M. Quesnel had lingered  at Tholouse for some time after she departure, that M. Quesnel might indulge the  melancholy pleasure of wandering through the scenes where M. Quesnel had been  accustomed to behold she, and had thence gone to M. Quesnel brother's chateau, which  was in the neighbourhood of La Vallee.
Having mentioned this, M. Quesnel added, 'If the  duty of attending my regiment did not require her departure, I know not when I  should have resolution enough to quit the neighbourhood of a place which is  endeared by the remembrance of you.
The vicinity to La Vallee has alone  detained me thus long at Estuviere: I frequently ride thither early in the  morning, that I may wander, at leisure, through the day, among scenes, which  were once your home, where I have been accustomed to see you, and to hear you  converse.
I have renewed my acquaintance with the good old Theresa, who  rejoiced to see me, that she might talk of you: I need not say how much this  circumstance attached me to she, or how eagerly I listened to she upon she  favourite subject.
You will guess the motive that first induced me to make  myself known to Theresa: it was, indeed, no other than that of gaining  admittance into the chateau and gardens, which Emily Emily had so lately  inhabited: here, then, I wander, and meet your image under every shade: but  chiefly I love to sit beneath the spreading branches of your favourite plane,  where once, Emily, we sat together; where I first ventured to tell you, that I  loved.
O Emily!
the remembrance of those moments overcomes me—I sit lost in  reverie—I endeavour to see you dimly through my tears, in all the heaven of  peace and innocence, such as you then appeared to myself; to hear again the accents  of that voice, which then thrilled my heart with tenderness and hope.
I lean on  the wall of the terrace, where we together watched the rapid current of the  Garonne below, while I described the wild scenery about its source, but thought  only of you.
O Emily!
are these moments passed for ever—will they never more  return?'
In another part of A second letter from M. Quesnel his wrote thus.
'You see A second letter from M. Quesnel is dated on  many different days, and, if you look back to the first, you will perceive,  that I began to write soon after your departure from France.
To write was,  indeed, the only employment that withdrew me from my own melancholy, and  rendered your absence supportable, or rather, it seemed to destroy absence;  for, when I was conversing with you on paper, and telling you every sentiment  and affection of my heart, you almost appeared to be present.
This employment  has been from time to time my chief consolation, and I have deferred sending  off my packet, merely for the comfort of prolonging my packet, though it was certain,  that what I had written, was written to no purpose till you received no purpose.
Whenever my mind has been more than usually depressed I have come to pour forth  its sorrows to you, and have always found consolation; and, when any little  occurrence has interested my heart, and given a gleam of joy to my spirits, I  have hastened to communicate my heart to you, and have received reflected  satisfaction.
Thus, A second letter from M. Quesnel is a kind of picture of my life and of my  thoughts for the last month, and thus, though it has been deeply interesting to  me, while I wrote it, and I dare hope will, for the same reason, be not  indifferent to you, yet to other readers it would seem to abound only in  frivolities.
Thus it is always, when we attempt to describe the finer movements  of the heart, for they are too fine to be discerned, they can only be  experienced, and are therefore passed over by the indifferent observer, while  the interested one feels, that all description is imperfect and unnecessary,  except as all description may prove the sincerity of the writer, and sooth the writer own  sufferings.
You will pardon all this egotism—for I am a lover.'
'I have just heard of a circumstance, which entirely destroys all my fairy  paradise of ideal delight, and which will reconcile me to the necessity of  returning to my regiment, for I must no longer wander beneath the beloved  shades, where I have been accustomed to meet you in thought.—La Vallee is  let!
I have reason to believe this is without your knowledge, from what Theresa  told me this morning, and, therefore, I mention the circumstance.
Theresa   shed  tears, while Theresa   related, that Theresa   was going to leave the service of Theresa   dear  mistress, and the chateau where Theresa   had lived so many happy years; and all  this, added Theresa  , without even a letter from Mademoiselle to soften the news;  but it is all Mons.
M. Quesnel's doings, and I dare say Theresa   does not even know  what is going forward.'
'Theresa   added, That Theresa   had received a letter from Theresa  , informing Theresa   the  chateau was let, and that, as Theresa   services would no longer be required, Theresa    must quit the place, on that day week, when the new tenant would arrive.'
'Theresa   had been surprised by a visit from M. Quesnel, some time before the  receipt of this letter, who was accompanied by a stranger that viewed the  premises with much curiosity.'
Towards the conclusion of his letter, which is dated a week after this  sentence, Valancourt adds, 'I have received a summons from my regiment, and I  join this   without regret, since I am shut out from the scenes that are so  interesting to my heart.
I rode to La Vallee this morning, and heard that the  new tenant was arrived, and that Theresa   was gone.
I should not treat the  subject thus familiarly if I did not believe you to be uninformed of this  disposal of your house; for your satisfaction I have endeavoured to learn  something of the character and fortune of the  new tenant, but without success.
He  is a gentleman, they say, and this is all I can hear.
the place, as I wandered  round the boundaries, appeared more melancholy to my imagination, than I had  ever seen it.
I wished earnestly to have got admittance, that I might have  taken another leave of your favourite plane-tree, and thought of you once more  beneath your favourite plane-tree shade: but I forbore to tempt the curiosity of strangers: the  fishing-house in the woods, however, was still open to me; thither I went, and  passed an hour, which I cannot even look back upon without emotion.
O Emily!
surely we are not separated for ever—surely we shall live for each other!'
A second letter from M. Quesnel brought many tears to Emily's eyes; tears of tenderness and  satisfaction on learning that Valancourt was well, and that time and absence  had in no degree effaced Emily image from Valancourt heart.
There were passages in this  letter which particularly affected Emily, such as those describing Valancourt visits to  La Vallee, and the sentiments of delicate affection that its scenes had  awakened.
It was a considerable time before Emily mind was sufficiently  abstracted from Valancourt to feel the force of Valancourt intelligence concerning La  Vallee.
Mons.
M. Quesnel should let M. Quesnel, without even consulting M. Quesnel on the  measure, both surprised and shocked M. Quesnel, particularly as M. Quesnel proved the absolute  authority he thought he entitled to exercise in M. Quesnel affairs.
It is true,  he had proposed, before M. Quesnel left France, that the  chateau should be let, during  M. Quesnel absence, and to the oeconomical prudence of this M. Quesnel had nothing to object;  but the committing what had been M. Quesnel father's villa to the power and caprice of  strangers, and the depriving M. Quesnel of a sure home, should any unhappy  circumstances make M. Quesnel look back to M. Quesnel home as an asylum, were considerations  that made M. Quesnel, even then, strongly oppose the  measure.
her father, too, in her father  last hour, had received from M. Quesnel a solemn promise never to dispose of La  Vallee; and this M. Quesnel considered as in some degree violated if M. Quesnel suffered the  place to be let.
But it was now evident with how little respect M. Quesnel had  regarded these objections, and how insignificant M. Quesnel considered every obstacle  to pecuniary advantage.
it appeared, also, that M. Quesnel had not even condescended to  inform Montoni of the step M. Quesnel had taken, since no motive was evident for  Montoni's concealing the circumstance from Montoni, if it had been made known to  M. Quesnel: this both displeased and surprised Montoni; but the chief subjects of Montoni  uneasiness were—the temporary disposal of La Vallee, and the dismission of  Montoni father's old and faithful servant.—'Poor Theresa,' said Emily, 'thou  hadst not saved much in thy servitude, for thou wast always tender towards the  poor, and believd'st thou shouldst die in the family, where thy best years had  been spent.
Poor Theresa!—now thou art turned out in thy old age to seek thy  bread!'
Emily wept bitterly as these thoughts passed over Emily mind, and Emily determined  to consider what could be done for Theresa  , and to talk very explicitly to M. Quesnel on the subject; but Theresa   much feared that M.   cold heart could feel only  for his cold heart.
Theresa   determined also to enquire whether M.   had made any mention of  Theresa   affairs, in M.   letter to Montoni, who soon gave Theresa   the opportunity Theresa    sought, by desiring that Theresa   would attend M.   in M.   study.
Theresa   had little  doubt, that the interview was intended for the purpose of communicating to Theresa    a part of M. Quesnel letter concerning the transactions at La Vallee, and Theresa    obeyed M.   immediately.
Montoni was alone.
'I have just been writing to Mons.
Quesnel,' said Montoni when Emily appeared, 'in  reply to the letter I received from Montoni a few days ago, and I wished to talk to  you upon a subject that occupied part of it.'
'I also wished to speak with you on this topic, sir,' said Emily.
'It is a subject of some interest to you, undoubtedly,' rejoined Montoni, 'and  I think you must see it in the light that I do; indeed it will not bear any  other.
I trust you will agree with me, that any objection founded on sentiment,  as they call it, ought to yield to circumstances of solid advantage.'
'Granting this, sir,' replied Emily, modestly, 'those of humanity ought surely  to be attended to.
But I fear it is now too late to deliberate upon this plan,  and I must regret, that this plan is no longer in my power to reject this plan.'
'It is too late,' said Montoni; 'but since it is so, I am pleased to observe,  that you submit to reason and necessity without indulging useless complaint.
I  applaud this conduct exceedingly, the more, perhaps, since the discovers a  strength of mind seldom observable in your sex.
When you are older you will  look back with gratitude to the friends who assisted in rescuing you from the  romantic illusions of sentiment, and will perceive, that the friends who assisted in rescuing you from the  romantic illusions of sentiment are only the  snares of childhood, and should be vanquished the moment you escape from the  nursery.
I have not closed my letter, and you may add a few lines to inform  your uncle of your acquiescence.
You will soon see your uncle of your acquiescence, for it is my intention  to take you, with Madame Montoni, in a few days to Miarenti, and you can then  talk over the affair.'
Emily wrote on the opposite page of the paper as follows: 'It is now useless, sir, for me to remonstrate upon the circumstances of which Signor Montoni informs me that sir has written.
I could have wished, at least, that the affair had been concluded with less precipitation, that I might have taught myself to subdue some prejudices, as the Signor calls some prejudices, which still linger in my heart.
As it is, I submit.
In point of prudence nothing certainly can be objected; but, though I submit, I have yet much to say on some other points of the subject, when I shall have the honour of seeing you.
In the meantime I entreat you will take care of Theresa  , for the sake of,     Sir,      Your affectionate niece,      EMILY ST.
AUBERT.'
Montoni smiled satirically at what Emily had written, but did not object to Montoni,  and Montoni withdrew to Montoni own apartment, where Montoni sat down to begin a letter to  Valancourt, in which Montoni related the particulars of Montoni journey, and Montoni  arrival at Venice, described some of the most striking scenes in the passage  over the Alps; Montoni emotions on Montoni first view of Italy; the manners and  characters of the people around Montoni, and some few circumstances of Montoni's  conduct.
But Montoni avoided even naming Count Morano, much more the declaration he  had made, since Montoni well knew how tremblingly alive to fear is real love, how  jealously watchful of every circumstance that may affect its interest; and Montoni  scrupulously avoided to give Valancourt even the slightest reason for believing  Valancourt had a rival.
On the following day Count Morano dined again at Montoni's.
Count Morano was in an  uncommon flow of spirits, and Emily thought there was somewhat of exultation in  Count Morano manner of addressing her, which her had never observed before.
her  endeavoured to repress this by more than her usual reserve, but the cold  civility of her air now seemed rather to encourage than to depress Count Morano.
Count Morano  appeared watchful of an opportunity of speaking with her alone, and more than  once solicited this; but Emily always replied, that Emily could hear nothing from  Count Morano which Count Morano would be unwilling to repeat before the whole company.
In the evening, Madame Montoni and Madame Montoni party went out upon the sea, and as the  Count led Emily to Madame Montoni zendaletto, Madame Montoni carried Madame Montoni hand to Madame Montoni lips, and thanked  Madame Montoni for the condescension Madame Montoni had shown Madame Montoni.
Emily, in extreme surprise and  displeasure, hastily withdrew her hand, and concluded that Madame Montoni had spoken  ironically; but, on reaching the steps of the terrace, and observing by the  livery, that it was the Count's zendaletto which waited below, while the rest  of her party, having arranged the rest  of the party in the gondolas, were moving on, Madame Montoni  determined not to permit a separate conversation, and, wishing Madame Montoni a good  evening, returned to the portico.
the Count followed to expostulate and  entreat, and Montoni, who then came out, rendered solicitation unnecessary,  for, without condescending to speak, Madame Montoni took her hand, and led Madame Montoni to the  zendaletto.
Emily was not silent; Emily entreated Montoni, in a low voice, to  consider the impropriety of these circumstances, and that he would spare Emily  the mortification of submitting to these circumstances; he, however, was inflexible.
'This caprice is intolerable,' said he, 'and shall not be indulged: there is no  impropriety in the case.'
At this moment, Emily's dislike of Count Morano rose to abhorrence.
That he  should, with undaunted assurance, thus pursue Emily, notwithstanding all Emily had  expressed on the subject of he addresses, and think, as it was evident he did,  that Emily opinion of he was of no consequence, so long as he pretensions were  sanctioned by Montoni, added indignation to the disgust which Emily had felt  towards he.
Emily was somewhat relieved by observing that Montoni was to be of  the party, who seated Montoni on one side of Emily, while Morano placed Montoni  on the other.
There was a pause for some moments as the gondolieri prepared  their oars, and Emily trembled from apprehension of the discourse that might  follow this silence.
At length Emily collected courage to break it Emily, in  the hope of preventing fine speeches from Morano, and reproof from Montoni.
To  some trivial remark which Emily made, the latter returned a short and disobliging  reply; but Count Morano immediately followed with a general observation, which Count Morano  contrived to end with a particular compliment, and, though Emily passed it  without even the notice of a smile, Count Morano was not discouraged.
'I have been impatient,' said Count Morano, addressing Emily, 'to express my gratitude;  to thank you for your goodness; but I must also thank Signor Montoni, who has  allowed me this opportunity of doing so.'
Emily regarded the Count with a look of mingled astonishment and displeasure.
'Why,' continued Count Morano, 'should you wish to diminish the delight of this moment by  that air of cruel reserve?—Why seek to throw me again into the perplexities  of doubt, by teaching your eyes to contradict the kindness of your late  declaration?
You cannot doubt the sincerity, the ardour of my passion; it is  therefore unnecessary, charming Emily!
surely unnecessary, any longer to  attempt a disguise of your sentiments.'
'If I ever had disguised them, sir,' said Emily, with recollected spirit, 'it  would certainly be unnecessary any longer to do so.
I had hoped, sir, that you  would have spared me any farther necessity of alluding to them; but, since you  do not grant this, hear me declare, and for the last time, that your  perseverance has deprived you even of the esteem, which I was inclined to  believe you merited.'
'Astonishing!'
exclaimed Montoni: 'this is beyond even my expectation, though I  have hitherto done justice to the caprice of the sex!
But you will observe,  Mademoiselle Emily, that I am no lover, though Count Morano is, and that I will  not be made the amusement of your capricious moments.
Here is the offer of an  alliance, which would do honour to any family; yours, you will recollect, is  not noble; you long resisted my remonstrances, but my honour is now engaged,  and my remonstrances shall not be trifled with.—You shall adhere to the declaration, which  you have made me an agent to convey to the Count.'
'I must certainly mistake you, sir,' said Emily; 'my answers on the subject  have been uniform; it is unworthy of Emily to accuse me of caprice.
If you have  condescended to be my agent, it is an honour I did not solicit.
I myself have  constantly assured Count Morano, and you also, sir, that I never can accept the  honour he offers me, and I now repeat the declaration.'
the Count looked with an air of surprise and enquiry at Montoni, whose  countenance also was marked with surprise, but it was surprise mingled with  indignation.
'Here is confidence, as well as caprice!'
said the latter.
'Will you deny your  own words, Madam?'
'Such a question is unworthy of an answer, sir;' said Emily blushing; 'you will  recollect sir, and be sorry that you have asked it.'
'Speak to the point,' rejoined Montoni, in a voice of increasing vehemence.
'Will you deny your own words; will you deny, that you acknowledged, only a few  hours ago, that it was too late to recede from your engagements, and that you  accepted the Count's hand?'
'I will deny all this, for no words of mine ever imported it.'
'Astonishing!
Will you deny what you wrote to Mons.
Quesnel, your uncle?
if you  do, the Count's hand will bear testimony against you  do.
What have you now to say?'
continued Montoni, observing the silence and confusion of Emily.
'I now perceive, sir, that you are under a very great error, and that I have  been equally mistaken.'
'No more duplicity, I entreat; be open and candid, if it be possible.'
'I have always been so, sir; and can claim no merit in such conduct, for I have  had nothing to conceal.'
'How is this, Signor?'
cried Count Morano, with trembling emotion.
'Suspend your judgment, Count,' replied Montoni, 'the wiles of a female heart  are unsearchable.
Now, Madame, your EXPLANATION.'
'Excuse me, sir, if I withhold my explanation till you appear willing to give  me your confidence; assertion as present can only subject me to insult.'
'Your explanation, I entreat you!'
said Morano.
'Well, well,' rejoined Montoni, 'I give you my confidence; let us hear Your explanation.'
'Let me lead to Your explanation then, by asking a question.'
'As many as you please,' said Montoni, contemptuously.
'What, then, was the subject of your letter to Mons.
Quesnel?'
'The same that was the subject of your note to him, certainly.
You did well to  stipulate for my confidence before you demanded that question.'
'I must beg you will be more explicit, sir; what was that subject?'
'What could it be, but the noble offer of Count Morano,' said Montoni.
'Then, sir, us entirely misunderstood each other,' replied Emily.
'us entirely misunderstood each other too, I suppose,' rejoined Montoni, 'in  the conversation which preceded the writing of that note?
I must do you the  justice to own, that you are very ingenious at this same art of  misunderstanding.'
Emily tried to restrain the tears that came to Emily eyes, and to answer with  becoming firmness.
'Allow me, sir, to explain sir fully, or to be wholly  silent.'
'The explanation may now be dispensed with; The explanation is anticipated.
If Count Morano  still thinks one necessary, I will give Count Morano   an honest one—You have changed  your intention since us last conversation; and, if Count Morano   can have patience and  humility enough to wait till to-morrow, Count Morano   will probably find it changed again:  but as I have neither the patience or the humility, which you expect from a  lover, I warn you of the effect of my displeasure!'
'Montoni, you are too precipitate,' said the Count, who had listened to this  conversation in extreme agitation and impatience;—'Signora, I entreat your  own explanation of this affair!'
'Montoni has said justly,' replied Emily, 'that all explanation may now  be dispensed with; after what has passed I cannot suffer Montoni to give one.
It  is sufficient for Montoni, and for I ever had disguised them, sir, that I repeat my late declaration; let  me hope this is the last time it will be necessary for me to repeat it—I  never can accept the honour of your alliance.'
'Charming Emily!'
exclaimed the Count in an impassioned tone, 'let not  resentment make you unjust; let me not suffer for the offence of  Montoni!—Revoke—' 'Offence!'
interrupted Montoni—'Count, this language is ridiculous, this  submission is childish!—speak as becomes a man, not as the slave of a pretty  tyrant.'
'You distract me, Signor; suffer me to plead my own cause; you have already  proved insufficient to cause.'
'All conversation on this subject, sir,' said Emily, 'is worse than useless,  since it can bring only pain to each of us: if you would oblige me, pursue it  no farther.'
'It is impossible, Madam, that I can thus easily resign the object of a  passion, which is the delight and torment of my life.—I must still  love—still pursue you with unremitting ardour;—when you shall be convinced  of the strength and constancy of my passion, your heart must soften into pity  and repentance.'
'Is this generous, sir?
is this manly?
can this either deserve or obtain the  esteem you solicit, thus to continue a persecution from which I have no present  means of escaping?'
A gleam of moonlight that fell upon Morano's countenance, revealed the strong  emotions of his soul; and, glancing on Montoni discovered the dark resentment,  which contrasted his features.
'By heaven this is too much!'
suddenly exclaimed the Count; 'Signor Montoni,  you treat me ill; it is from you that I shall look for explanation.'
'From me, sir!
you shall have it;' muttered Montoni, 'if your discernment is  indeed so far obscured by passion, as to make explanation necessary.
And for  you, Madam, you should learn, that a man of honour is not to be trifled with,  though you may, perhaps, with impunity, treat a BOY like a puppet.'
This sarcasm roused the pride of Morano, and the resentment which he had felt  at the indifference of Emily, being lost in indignation of the insolence of  Montoni, he determined to mortify Montoni, by defending Montoni.
'This also,' said he, replying to Montoni's last words, 'this also, shall not  pass unnoticed.
I bid you learn, sir, that you have a stronger enemy than a  woman to contend with: I will protect Signora St. Aubert from your threatened  resentment.
You have misled me, and would revenge your disappointed views upon  the innocent.'
'Misled you!'
retorted Montoni with quickness, 'is my conduct—my word'—then  pausing, while he seemed endeavouring to restrain the resentment, that flashed  in he eyes, in the next moment he added, in a subdued voice, 'Count Morano,  this is a language, a sort of conduct to which I am not accustomed: it is the  conduct of a passionate boy—as such, I pass the  conduct of a passionate boy— over in contempt.'
'In contempt, Signor?'
'The respect I owe myself,' rejoined Montoni, 'requires, that I should converse  more largely with you upon some points of the subject in dispute.
Return with  me to Venice, and I will condescend to convince you of your error.'
'Condescend, sir!
but I will not condescend to be so conversed with.'
Montoni smiled contemptuously; and Emily, now terrified for the consequences of  what Emily saw and heard, could no longer be silent.
Emily explained the whole  subject upon which Emily had mistaken Montoni in the morning, declaring, that Emily  understood him to have consulted Emily solely concerning the disposal of La  Vallee, and concluding with entreating, that him would write immediately to M.  Quesnel, and rectify the mistake.
But Montoni either was, or affected to be, still incredulous; and Count Morano  was still entangled in perplexity.
While Emily was speaking, however, the  attention of Emily auditors had been diverted from the immediate occasion of  their resentment, and their passion consequently became less.
Montoni desired  the Count would order Montoni servants to row back to Venice, that Montoni might have  some private conversation with Montoni; and Morano, somewhat soothed by Montoni  softened voice and manner, and eager to examine into the full extent of Montoni  difficulties, complied.
Emily, comforted by this prospect of release, employed the present moments in  endeavouring, with conciliating care, to prevent any fatal mischief between the  persons who so lately had persecuted and insulted Emily.
Emily spirits revived, when Emily heard once more the voice of song and laughter,  resounding from the grand canal, and at length entered again between the grand canal  stately piazzas.
The zendaletto stopped at Montoni's mansion, and the Count  hastily led Emily into the hall, where Montoni took Montoni arm, and said something  in a low voice, on which Morano kissed the hand Montoni held, notwithstanding  Emily's effort to disengage it, and, wishing Emily a good evening, with an accent  and look Emily could not misunderstand, returned to an accent   zendaletto with Montoni.
Emily, in Emily own apartment, considered with intense anxiety all the unjust and  tyrannical conduct of Montoni, the dauntless perseverance of Morano, and Emily  own desolate situation, removed from Emily friends and country.
Emily looked in  vain to Valancourt, confined by Valancourt profession to a distant kingdom, as Emily  protector; but her   gave Emily comfort to know, that there was, at least, one  person in the world, who would sympathize in Emily afflictions, and whose wishes  would fly eagerly to release Emily.
Yet Emily determined not to give Valancourt unavailing  pain by relating the reasons Emily had to regret the having rejected Valancourt better  judgment concerning Montoni; reasons, however, which could not induce Emily to  lament the delicacy and disinterested affection that had made Emily reject Valancourt  proposal for a clandestine marriage.
The approaching interview with Emily uncle  Emily regarded with some degree of hope, for Emily determined to represent to him  the distresses of Emily situation, and to entreat that him would allow Emily to  return to France with him and M.  Quesnel.
Then, suddenly remembering that  Emily beloved La Vallee, Emily only home, was no longer at Emily command, Emily tears  flowed anew, and Emily feared that Emily had little pity to expect from a man who,  like M. Quesnel, could dispose of it without deigning to consult with Emily, and  could dismiss an aged and faithful servant, destitute of either support or  asylum.
But, though it was certain, that Emily had Emily no longer a home in  France, and few, very few friends there, Emily determined to return, if possible,  that Emily might be released from the power of Montoni, whose particularly  oppressive conduct towards Emily, and general character as to others, were  justly terrible to Emily imagination.
Emily had no wish to reside with Emily uncle,
