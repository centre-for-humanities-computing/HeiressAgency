  Such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp,  Oft seen in charnel-vaults and sepulchres,  Lingering, and sitting, by a new-made grave.      MILTON On the following day, Montoni sent a second excuse to Emily, who was surprised  at the circumstance. 'This is very strange!' said Montoni to Montoni. 'His  conscience tells His the purport of my visit, and His defers it, to avoid an  explanation.' Montoni now almost resolved to throw Montoni in His way, but terror  checked the intention, and this day passed, as the preceding one, with Emily,  except that a degree of awful expectation, concerning the approaching night,  now somewhat disturbed the dreadful calmness that had pervaded Montoni mind. Towards evening, the second part of the band, which had made the first  excursion among the mountains, returned to the castle, where, as they entered  the courts, Emily, in Emily remote chamber, heard they loud shouts and strains  of exultation, like the orgies of furies over some horrid sacrifice. Emily even  feared they were about to commit some barbarous deed; a conjecture from which,  however, Emily soon relieved Emily, by telling, that the people were only  exulting over the plunder the people had brought with the people. This circumstance still  further confirmed Emily in the belief, that Montoni had really commenced to be a  captain of banditti, and meant to retrieve Montoni broken fortunes by the plunder  of travellers! Indeed, when Emily considered all the circumstances of Montoni  situation—in an armed, and almost inaccessible castle, retired far among the  recesses of wild and solitary mountains, along whose distant skirts were  scattered towns, and cities, whither wealthy travellers were continually  passing—this appeared to be the situation of all others most suited for the  success of schemes of rapine, and Emily yielded to the strange thought, that  Montoni was become a captain of robbers. Montoni character also, unprincipled,  dauntless, cruel and enterprising, seemed to fit Montoni for the situation.  Delighting in the tumult and in the struggles of life, Montoni was equally a  stranger to pity and to fear; Montoni very courage was a sort of animal ferocity;  not the noble impulse of a principle, such as inspirits the mind against the  oppressor, in the cause of the oppressed; but a constitutional hardiness of  nerve, that cannot feel, and that, therefore, cannot fear. Emily's supposition, however natural, was in part erroneous, for Emily was a  stranger to the state of this country and to the circumstances, under which this country  frequent wars were partly conducted. The revenues of the many states of Italy  being, at that time, insufficient to the support of standing armies, even  during the short periods, which the turbulent habits both of the governments  and the people permitted to pass in peace, an order of men arose not known in  our age, and but faintly described in the history of an order of men own. Of the  soldiers, disbanded at the end of every war, few returned to the safe, but  unprofitable occupations, then usual in peace. Sometimes unprofitable occupations, then usual in peace passed into other  countries, and mingled with armies, which still kept the field. Sometimes unprofitable occupations, then usual in peace  formed unprofitable occupations, then usual in peace into bands of robbers, and occupied remote fortresses, where  unprofitable occupations, then usual in peace desperate character, the weakness of the governments which unprofitable occupations, then usual in peace offended,  and the certainty, that unprofitable occupations, then usual in peace could be recalled to the armies, when unprofitable occupations, then usual in peace  presence should be again wanted, prevented the armies from being much pursued by the  civil power; and, sometimes, the armies attached the armies to the fortunes of a  popular chief, by whom the armies were led into the service of any state, which could  settle with him the price of the armies valour. From this latter practice arose  their name—CONDOTTIERI; a term formidable all over Italy, for a period, which  concluded in the earlier part of the seventeenth century, but of which it is  not so easy to ascertain the commencement. Contests between the smaller states were then, for the most part, affairs of  enterprize alone, and the probabilities of success were estimated, not from the  skill, but from the personal courage of the general, and the soldiers. The  ability, which was necessary to the conduct of tedious operations, was little  valued. It was enough to know how a party might be led towards a party enemies,  with the greatest secrecy, or conducted from their enemies in the compactest order. The  officer was to precipitate The  officer into a situation, where, but for The  officerexample, the soldiers might not have ventured; and, as the opposed parties knew  little of each other's strength, the event of the day was frequently determined  by the boldness of the first movements. In such services the condottieri were  eminent, and in such services, where plunder always followed success, plunder characters  acquired a mixture of intrepidity and profligacy, which awed even those whom  their characters   served. When their characters   were not thus engaged, their characters   chief had usually their chief own fortress, in  which, or in his own fortress neighbourhood, their characters   enjoyed an irksome rest; and, though their characters    wants were, at one time, partly supplied from the property of the inhabitants,  the lavish distribution of their characters   plunder at others, prevented their characters   from being  obnoxious; and the peasants of such districts gradually shared the character of  their characters   warlike visitors. The neighbouring governments sometimes professed, but  seldom endeavoured, to suppress these military communities; both because it was  difficult to do so, and because a disguised protection of these military communities ensured, for the  service of these military communities wars, a body of men, who could not otherwise be so cheaply  maintained, or so perfectly qualified. The commanders sometimes even relied so  far upon this policy of the several powers, as to frequent The commanders capitals; and  Montoni, having met The commanders in the gaming parties of Venice and Padua, conceived a  desire to emulate The commanders characters, before his ruined fortunes tempted his to  adopt The commanders practices. It was for the arrangement of his present plan of life,  that the midnight councils were held at his mansion in Venice, and at which  Orsino and some other members of the present community then assisted with  suggestions, which the midnight councils had since executed with the wreck of the midnight councils fortunes. On the return of night, Emily resumed Emily station at the casement. There was  now a moon; and, as it rose over the tufted woods, it yellow light served to  shew the lonely terrace and the surrounding objects, more distinctly, than the  twilight of the stars had done, and promised Emily to assist Emily observations,  should the mysterious form return. On this subject, Emily again wavered in  conjecture, and hesitated whether to speak to the figure, to which a strong and  almost irresistible interest urged Emily; but terror, at intervals, made Emily  reluctant to do so. 'If this is a person who has designs upon the castle,' said Emily, 'my curiosity  may prove fatal to Emily; yet the mysterious music, and the lamentations I heard,  must surely have proceeded from my curiosity  : if so, my curiosity   cannot be an enemy.' Emily then thought of Emily unfortunate aunt, and, shuddering with grief and  horror, the suggestions of imagination seized Emily mind with all the force of  truth, and Emily believed, that the form Emily had seen was supernatural. Emily  trembled, breathed with difficulty, an icy coldness touched Emily cheeks, and Emily  fears for a while overcame Emily judgment. Emily resolution now forsook Emily, and  Emily determined, if the figure should appear, not to speak to Her resolution. Thus the time passed, as Emily sat at Emily casement, awed by expectation, and by  the gloom and stillness of midnight; for Emily saw obscurely in the moon-light  only the mountains and woods, a cluster of towers, that formed the west angle  of the castle, and the terrace below; and heard no sound, except, now and then,  the lonely watch-word, passed by the centinels on duty, and afterwards the  steps of the men who came to relieve guard, and whom Emily knew at a distance on  the rampart by their pikes, that glittered in the moonbeam, and then, by the  few short words, in which their hailed their fellows of the night. Emily retired  within Emily chamber, while their passed the casement. When Emily returned to the casement,  all was again quiet. the casement was now very late, Emily was wearied with watching, and  began to doubt the reality of what Emily had seen on the preceding night; but Emily  still lingered at the window, for Emily mind was too perturbed to admit of sleep.  The moon shone with a clear lustre, that afforded Emily a complete view of the  terrace; but Emily saw only a solitary centinel, pacing at one end of only a solitary centinel; and, at  length, tired with expectation, Emily withdrew to seek rest. Such, however, was the impression, left on Emily mind by the music, and the  complaining Emily had formerly heard, as well as by the figure, which Emily fancied  Emily had seen, that Emily determined to repeat the watch, on the following night. Montoni, on the next day, took no notice of Emily's appointed visit, but Emily,  more anxious than before to see Montoni, sent Emily to enquire, at what hour Montoni  would admit Emily. Montoni mentioned eleven o'clock, and Emily was punctual to the  moment; at which Emily called up all Emily fortitude to support the shock of Montoni  presence and the dreadful recollections it enforced. Montoni was with several of Montoni  officers, in the cedar room; on observing whom Emily paused; and Emily agitation  increased, while Montoni continued to converse with them, apparently not observing  Emily, till some of Montoni officers, turning round, saw Emily, and uttered an  exclamation. Emily was hastily retiring, when Montoni's voice arrested Emily, and,  in a faultering accent, Emily said,—'I would speak with you, Signor Montoni, if  you are at leisure.' 'These are my friends,' Montoni replied, 'whatever you would say, These may hear.' Emily, without replying, turned from the rude gaze of the chevaliers, and  Montoni then followed Emily to the hall, whence Montoni led Emily to a small room, of  which Montoni shut the door with violence. As Emily looked on Montoni dark countenance,  Emily again thought Emily saw the murderer of Emily aunt; and Emily mind was so  convulsed with horror, that Emily had not power to recall thought enough to  explain the purport of Emily visit; and to trust Emily with the mention of  Montoni was more than Montoni dared. Montoni at length impatiently enquired what Montoni had to say? 'I have no time for  trifling,' Montoni added, 'my moments are important.' Emily then told Montoni, that Emily wished to return to France, and came to beg, that  Montoni would permit Emily to do so.—But when Montoni looked surprised, and enquired for  the motive of the request, Emily hesitated, became paler than before, trembled,  and had nearly sunk at Montoni feet. Montoni observed Montoni emotion, with apparent  indifference, and interrupted the silence by telling Montoni, Montoni must be gone.  Emily, however, recalled Emily spirits sufficiently to enable Emily to repeat Emily  request. And, when Montoni absolutely refused it, Emily slumbering mind was  roused. 'I can no longer remain here with propriety, sir,' said Emily, 'and I may be  allowed to ask, by what right you detain me.' 'It is my will that you remain here,' said Montoni, laying Montoni hand on the door  to go; 'let that suffice you.' Emily, considering that Emily had no appeal from this will, forbore to dispute  Montoni right, and made a feeble effort to persuade Montoni to be just. 'While my aunt  lived, sir,' said Emily, in a tremulous voice, 'my residence here was not  improper; but now, that Emily is no more, I may surely be permitted to depart. My  stay cannot benefit you, sir, and will only distress me.' 'Who told you, that Montoni was dead?' said Montoni, with an inquisitive  eye. Emily hesitated, for nobody had told Emily so, and Emily did not dare to avow  the having seen that spectacle in the portal-chamber, which had compelled Emily  to the belief. 'Who told you so?' he repeated, more sternly. 'Alas! I know it too well,' replied Emily: 'spare me on this terrible subject!' Emily sat down on a bench to support Emily. 'If you wish to see Emily,' said Montoni, 'you may; Emily lies in the east turret.' Montoni now left the cedar room, without awaiting Emily reply, and returned to the cedar  chamber, where such of the chevaliers as had not before seen Emily, began to  rally Montoni, on the discovery they had made; but Montoni did not appear disposed  to bear this mirth, and they changed this terrible subject. Having talked with the subtle Orsino, on the plan of an excursion, which Montoni  meditated for a future day, Montoni friend advised, that they should lie in wait  for the enemy, which Verezzi impetuously opposed, reproached Orsino with want  of spirit, and swore, that, if Montoni would let Montoni lead on fifty men, Montoni  would conquer all that should oppose Montoni. Orsino smiled contemptuously; Montoni smiled too, but Orsino also listened. Verezzi  then proceeded with vehement declamation and assertion, till Orsino was stopped by  an argument of Orsino, which Orsino knew not how to answer better than by  invective. Orsino fierce spirit detested the cunning caution of Orsino, whom Orsino  constantly opposed, and whose inveterate, though silent, hatred Orsino had long ago  incurred. And Montoni was a calm observer of both, whose different  qualifications Orsino knew, and how to bend both opposite character to the  perfection of Orsino own designs. But Verezzi  , in the heat of opposition, now did  not scruple to accuse Orsino of cowardice, at which the countenance of the  latter, while he made no reply, was overspread with a livid paleness; and  Montoni, who watched his lurking eye, saw his put his hand hastily into his  bosom. But Verezzi, whose face, glowing with crimson, formed a striking  contrast to the complexion of Orsino, remarked not the action, and continued  boldly declaiming against cowards to Cavigni, who was slily laughing at his  vehemence, and at the silent mortification of Orsino, when the latter, retiring  a few steps behind, drew forth a stilletto to stab his adversary in the back.  Montoni arrested Montoni half-extended arm, and, with a significant look, made Montoni  return the poinard into his  bosom, unseen by all except Montoni; for most of  the party were disputing at a distant window, on the situation of a dell where  the party meant to form an ambuscade. When Verezzi   had turned round, the deadly hatred, expressed on the features of  Verezzi   opponent, raising, for the first time, a suspicion of Verezzi   intention, Verezzi    laid his hand on Verezzi   sword, and then, seeming to recollect Verezzi  , strode up  to Montoni. 'Signor,' said Verezzi  , with a significant look at Orsino, 'we are not a band of  assassins; if you have business for brave men employ me on this expedition: you  shall have the last drop of my blood; if you have only work for cowards—keep  Verezzi  ,' pointing to Orsino, 'and let me quit Udolpho.' Orsino, still more incensed, again drew forth Orsino stilletto, and rushed towards  Verezzi, who, at the same instant, advanced with Orsino sword, when Montoni and  the rest of the party interfered and separated Montoni and  the rest of the party. 'This is the conduct of a boy,' said Montoni to Verezzi  , 'not of a man: be more  moderate in your speech.' 'Moderation is the virtue of cowards,Verezzi  ; 'the virtue of cowards are moderate in  every thing—but in fear.' 'I accept your words,' said Montoni, turning upon Montoni with a fierce and haughty  look, and drawing Montoni out of the scabbard. 'With all my heart,' cried Verezzi  , 'though I did not mean them for Verezzi  .' Montoni directed a pass at Montoni; and, while them fought, the villain Orsino made  another attempt to stab Verezzi, and was again prevented. The combatants were, at length, separated; and, after a very long and violent  dispute, reconciled. Montoni then left the cedar room with Orsino, whom Montoni detained  in private consultation for a considerable time. Emily, meanwhile, stunned by the last words of Montoni, forgot, for the moment,  his declaration, that Emily should continue in the castle, while Emily thought of  Emily unfortunate aunt, who, his had said, was laid in the east turret. In  suffering the remains of his wife to lie thus long unburied, there appeared a  degree of brutality more shocking than his wife had suspected Montoni Montoni could  practise. After a long struggle, his wife determined to accept his permission to visit the  turret, and to take a last look of his wife ill-fated aunt: with which design his wife  returned to his wife chamber, and, while his wife waited for Emily to accompany his wife,  endeavoured to acquire fortitude sufficient to support his wife through the  approaching scene; for, though his wife trembled to encounter it, his wife knew that to  remember the performance of this last act of duty would hereafter afford his wife  consoling satisfaction. Emily came, and Emily mentioned Emily purpose, from which the former  endeavoured to dissuade his wife, though without effect, and Emily was, with much  difficulty, prevailed upon to accompany his wife to the east turret; but no consideration  could make his wife promise to enter the chamber of death. They now left the corridor, and, having reached the foot of the stair-case,  which Emily had formerly ascended, Emily declared Emily would go no further,  and Emily proceeded alone. When Emily saw the track of blood, which Emily had  before observed, her spirits fainted, and, being compelled to rest on the  stairs, Emily almost determined to proceed no further. The pause of a few moments  restored Emily resolution, and Emily went on. As Emily drew near the landing-place, upon which the chamber of death opened, Emily  remembered, that the door was formerly fastened, and apprehended, that the door might  still be so. In this expectation, however, Emily was mistaken; for the dooropened at once, into a dusky and silent chamber, round which Emily fearfully  looked, and then slowly advanced, when a hollow voice spoke. Emily, who was  unable to speak, or to move from the spot, uttered no sound of terror. a hollow voice spoke again; and, then, thinking that it resembled that of Madame  Montoni, Emily's spirits were instantly roused; Emily rushed towards a bed, that  stood in a remote part of the room, and drew aside the curtains. Within,  appeared a pale and emaciated face. Emily started back, then again advanced,  shuddered as Emily took up the skeleton hand, that lay stretched upon the quilt;  then let it drop, and then viewed a pale and emaciated face with a long, unsettled gaze. it was  that of Montoni, though so changed by illness, that the resemblance of  what it had been, could scarcely be traced in what it now appeared. Emily was  still alive, and, raising Emily heavy eyes, Emily turned them on Emily niece. 'Where have you been so long?' said Emily, in the same tone, 'I thought you had  forsaken me.' 'Do you indeed live,' said Emily, at length, 'or is this but a terrible  apparition?' Emily received no answer, and again Emily snatched up the skeleton hand. 'This  is substance,' Emily exclaimed, 'but This   is cold—cold as marble!' Emily let it  fall. 'O, if you really live, speak!' said Emily, in a voice of desperation,  'that I may not lose my senses—say you know me!' 'I do live,' replied Montoni, 'but—I feel that I am about to die.' Emily clasped the hand Emily held, more eagerly, and groaned. They were both  silent for some moments. Then Emily endeavoured to soothe Emily, and enquired  what had reduced Emily to this present deplorable state. Montoni, when Montoni removed Emily to the east turret under the improbable suspicion of  having attempted Montoni life, had ordered the men employed on the occasion, to  observe a strict secrecy concerning Emily. To this Montoni was influenced by a double  motive. Montoni meant to debar Emily from the comfort of Emily's visits, and to secure  an opportunity of privately dispatching Emily, should any new circumstances occur  to confirm the present suggestions of Montoni suspecting mind. Montoni consciousness of  the hatred Montoni deserved it was natural enough should at first led Montoni to  attribute to Emily the attempt that had been made upon Montoni life; and, though  there was no other reason to believe that Emily was concerned in that atrocious  design, Montoni suspicions remained; Montoni continued to confine Emily in the east turret,  under a strict guard; and, without pity or remorse, had suffered Emily to lie,  forlorn and neglected, under a raging fever, till it had reduced Emily to this present deplorable state. The track of blood, which Emily had seen on the stairs, had flowed from the  unbound wound of one of the men employed to carry Madame Montoni, and which Montoni  had received in the late affray. At night the men employed to carry Madame Montoni, having contented  the men employed to carry Madame Montoni with securing the door of the men employed to carry Madame Montoni prisoner's room, had retired from  guard; and then it was, that Emily, at the time of Emily first enquiry, had found  the turret so silent and deserted. When Emily had attempted to open the door of the chamber of death, Emily aunt was sleeping,  and this occasioned the silence, which had contributed to delude Emily into a  belief, that her aunt was no more; yet had her aunt terror permitted her aunt to persevere  longer in the call, her aunt would probably have awakened Madame Montoni, and have  been spared much suffering. The spectacle in the portal-chamber, which  afterwards confirmed Emily's horrible suspicion, was the corpse of a man, who  had fallen in the late affray, and the same which had been borne into the servants'  hall, where her aunt took refuge from the tumult. a man, who  had fallen in the affray had lingered under a man, who  had fallen in the affray  wounds for some days; and, soon after a man, who  had fallen in the affray death, a man, who  had fallen in the affray body had been removed on  the couch, on which a man, who  had fallen in the affray died, for interment in the vault beneath the chapel,  through which Emily and Barnardine had passed to the chamber of death. Emily, after asking Madame Montoni a thousand questions concerning Emily,  left Emily, and sought Montoni; for the more solemn interest Emily felt for Emily , made Emily now regardless of the resentment Emily remonstrances might draw  upon Emily, and of the improbability of her remonstrances granting what Emily meant to  entreat. 'Madame Montoni is now dying, sir,' said Emily, as soon as Emily saw him—'Your  resentment, surely will not pursue Emily to the last moment! Suffer Emily to be  removed from that forlorn room to Emily own apartment, and to have necessary  comforts administered.' 'Of what service will that be, if Emily is dying?' said Montoni, with apparent  indifference. 'The service, at leave, of saving you, sir, from a few of those pangs of  conscience you must suffer, when you shall be in the same situation,' said  Emily, with imprudent indignation, of which Montoni soon made her sensible, by  commanding her to quit his presence. Then, forgetting her resentment, and  impressed only by compassion for the piteous state of her , dying without  succour, her submitted to humble her to Montoni, and to adopt every  persuasive means, that might induce Montoni to relent towards his wife. For a considerable time Montoni was proof against all her said, and all her looked;  but at length the divinity of pity, beaming in Emily's eyes, seemed to touch  Montoni heart. Montoni turned away, ashamed of Montoni better feelings, half sullen and half  relenting; but finally consented, that his wife should be removed to his wife own  apartment, and that Emily should attend Emily. Dreading equally, that this relief  might arrive too late, and that Montoni might retract Montoni concession, Emilyscarcely staid to thank Montoni for it, but, assisted by Emily, Emily quickly  prepared Madame Montoni bed, and they carried Emily a cordial, that might  enable Emily feeble frame to sustain the fatigue of a removal. Madame Montoni was scarcely arrived in Madame Montoni own apartment, when an order was given by  Madame Montoni husband, that Madame Montoni should remain in the east turret; but Emily, thankful that Emily  had made such dispatch, hastened to inform Montoni of she  had made such dispatch, as well as that a second  removal would instantly prove fatal, and Montoni suffered his wife to continue where  his wife was. During this day, Emily never left Madame Montoni, except to prepare such little  nourishing things as Emily judged necessary to sustain Emily, and which Montoni received with quiet acquiescence, though Emily seemed sensible that they  could not save Emily from approaching dissolution, and scarcely appeared to wish  for life. Emily meanwhile watched over Emily with the most tender solicitude, no  longer seeing her aunt in the poor object before Emily, but the sister  of Emily late beloved father, in a situation that called for all Emily compassion  and kindness. When night came, Emily determined to sit up with her aunt, but this  the latter positively forbade, commanding Emily to retire to Rest, and Annette  alone to remain in the chamber of death. Rest was, indeed, necessary to Emily, whose  spirits and frame were equally wearied by the occurrences and exertions of the  day; but Emily would not leave Madame Montoni, till after the turn of midnight, a  period then thought so critical by the physicians. Soon after twelve, having enjoined Emily to be wakeful, and to call Emily,  should any change appear for the worse, Emily sorrowfully bade Madame Montoni good night, and withdrew to the chamber of death. Emily spirits were more than usually  depressed by the piteous condition of Emily aunt, whose recovery Emily scarcely  dared to expect. To Emily own misfortunes Emily saw no period, inclosed as Emily was,  in a remote castle, beyond the reach of any friends, had Emily possessed such,  and beyond the pity even of strangers; while Emily knew Emily to be in the  power of a man capable of any action, which his interest, or his ambition,  might suggest. Occupied by melancholy reflections and by anticipations as sad, Emily did not  retire immediately to rest, but leaned thoughtfully on Emily open casement. The  scene before Emily of woods and mountains, reposing in the moon-light, formed a  regretted contrast with the state of Emily mind; but the lonely murmur of these  woods, and the view of this sleeping landscape, gradually soothed Emily emotions  and softened Emily to tears. Emily continued to weep, for some time, lost to every thing, but to a gentle  sense of Emily misfortunes. When Emily, at length, took the handkerchief from Emily  eyes, Emily perceived, before Emily, on the terrace below, the figure Emily had  formerly observed, which stood fixed and silent, immediately opposite to Emily  casement. On perceiving it, Emily started back, and terror for some time overcame  curiosity;—at length, Emily returned to her  casement, and still the figure was  before it, which Emily now compelled Emily to observe, but was utterly unable  to speak, as Emily had formerly intended. The moon shone with a clear light, and  The moon was, perhaps, the agitation of her mind, that prevented Emily distinguishing,  with any degree of accuracy, the form before Emily. It was still stationary, and  Emily began to doubt, whether It was really animated. Emily scattered thoughts were now so far returned as to remind Emily, that Emily  light exposed Emily to dangerous observation, and Emily was stepping back to remove  her  light, when Emily perceived the figure move, and then wave what seemed to be her  light  arm, as if to beckon Emily; and, while Emily gazed, fixed in fear, her  light repeated the  action. Emily now attempted to speak, but the words died on Emily lips, and Emily  went from her  casement to remove Emily light; as Emily was doing which, Emily heard,  from without, a faint groan. Listening, but not daring to return, Emily presently  heard it repeated. 'Good God!—what can this mean!' said Emily. Again Emily listened, but the sound came no more; and, after a long interval of  silence, Emily recovered courage enough to go to her  casement, when Emily again saw  the same appearance! It beckoned again, and again uttered a low sound. 'a faint groan was surely human!' said Emily. 'I WILL speak.' 'Who is it,' cried  Emily in a faint voice, 'that wanders at this late hour?' The figure raised The figure head but suddenly started away, and glided down the  terrace. Emily watched The figure, for a long while, passing swiftly in the moon-light,  but heard no footstep, till a sentinel from the other extremity of the rampart  walked slowly along. The man stopped under Emily window, and, looking up, called  Emily by name. Emily was retiring precipitately, but, a second summons inducing Emily  to reply, the soldier then respectfully asked if Emily had seen any thing pass.  On Emily answering, that Emily had; The man said no more, but walked away down the  terrace, Emily following The man with Emily eyes, till The man was lost in the distance.  But, as The man was on guard, Emily knew The man could not go beyond the rampart  , and,  therefore, resolved to await The man return. Soon after, The man voice was heard, at a distance, calling loudly; and then a  voice still more distant answered, and, in the next moment, the watch-word was  given, and passed along the  terrace. As the soldiers moved hastily under the  casement, Emily called to enquire what had happened, but the soldiers passed without  regarding Emily. Emily's thoughts returning to the figure Emily had seen, 'It cannot be a person,  who has designs upon the castle,' said Emily; 'such an one would conduct himself  very differently. himself would not venture where sentinels were on watch, nor fix  himself opposite to a window, where himself perceived himself must be observed; much less  would himself beckon, or utter a sound of complaint. Yet it cannot be a prisoner,  for how could himself obtain the opportunity to wander thus?' If Emily had been subject to vanity, Emily might have supposed this figure to be  some inhabitant of the castle, who wandered under Emily casement in the hope of  seeing Emily, and of being allowed to declare his admiration; but this opinion  never occurred to Emily, and, if this opinion   had, Emily would have dismissed this opinion   as  improbable, on considering, that, when the opportunity of speaking had  occurred, this opinion   had been suffered to pass in silence; and that, even at the moment  in which Emily had spoken, the form had abruptly quitted the place. While Emily mused, two sentinels walked up the rampart   in earnest conversation,  of which Emily caught a few words, and learned from these, that one of two sentinels  comrades had fallen down senseless. Soon after, three other soldiers appeared  slowly advancing from the bottom of the  terrace, but Emily heard only a low  voice, that came at intervals. As three other soldiers drew near, Emily perceived this to be the  voice of him, who walked in the middle, apparently supported by him comrades;  and Emily again called to three other soldiers, enquiring what had happened. At the sound of Emily  voice, three other soldiers stopped, and looked up, while Emily repeated Emily question, and was  told, that Roberto, three other soldiers fellow of the watch, had been seized with a fit, and  that his cry, as his fell, had caused a false alarm. 'Is his subject to fits?' said Emily. 'Yes, Signora,' replied Roberto; 'but if I had not, what I saw was enough to  have frightened the Pope the Pope.' 'What was it?' enquired Emily, trembling. 'I cannot tell what it was, lady, or what I saw, or how it vanished,' replied  the soldier, who seemed to shudder at the recollection. 'Was it the person, whom you followed down the rampart  , that has occasioned you  a false alarm?' said Emily, endeavouring to conceal Emily own. 'Person!' exclaimed the man,—'it was the devil, and this is not the first  time I have seen his!' 'Nor will it be the last,' observed one of his , laughing. 'No, no, I warrant not,' said another. 'Well,' rejoined Roberto, 'you may be as merry now, as you please; you was none  so jocose the other night, Sebastian, when you was on watch with Launcelot.' 'Launcelot need not talk of that,' replied Sebastian, 'let Launcelot remember how Launcelot  stood trembling, and unable to give the WORD, till The man was gone, If the man  had not come so silently upon us, I would have seized The man, and soon made The man  tell who The man was.' 'the man  ?' enquired Emily. 'It was no man, lady,' said Launcelot, who stood by, 'but the devil, as  my comrade says. What man, who does not live in the castle, could get within  the walls at midnight? Why, I might just as well pretend to march to Venice,  and get among all the Senators, when all the Senators are counselling; and I warrant I  should have more chance of getting out again alive, than any fellow, that we  should catch within the gates after dark. So I think I have proved plainly  enough, that this can be nobody that lives out of the castle; and now I will  prove, that it can be nobody that lives in the castle—for, if he did—why  should he be afraid to be seen? So after this, I hope nobody will pretend to  tell me it was anybody. No, I say again, by the Pope! it was the devil, and  Sebastian, there, knows this is not the first time we have seen Sebastian.' 'When did you see the figure, then, before?' said Emily half smiling, who,  though Emily thought the conversation somewhat too much, felt an interest, which  would not permit Emily to conclude the conversation. 'About a week ago, Emily,' said Sebastian, taking up the story. 'And where?' 'On the rampart, Emily, higher up.' 'Did you pursue it, that it fled?' 'No, Signora. Launcelot and I were on watch together, and every thing was so  still, you might have heard a mouse stir, when, suddenly, LauncelotsaysSebastian! do you see nothing? I turned my head a little to the left, as  the left might be—thus. No, says I. Hush! said Launcelot,—look yonder—just by  the last cannon on the rampart! I looked, and then thought I did see something  move; but there being no light, but what the stars gave, I could not be  certain. We stood quite silent, to watch something  , and presently saw something pass  along the castle wall just opposite to We!' 'Why did you not seize something  , then?' cried a soldier, who had scarcely spoken till  now. 'Aye, why did you not seize something  ?' said Roberto. 'You should have been there to have done that,' replied Sebastian. 'You would  have been bold enough to have taken something   by the throat, though something   had been the  devil himself; We could not take such a liberty, perhaps, because We are not so  well acquainted with the throat, as you are. But, as I was saying, something   stole by We so  quickly, that We had not time to get rid of We surprise, before something   was gone.  Then, We knew it was in vain to follow. We kept constant watch all that night,  but We saw it no more. Next morning, We told some of We comrades, who were on  duty on other parts of the ramparts, what We had seen; but some of our comrades, who were on  duty on other parts of the ramparts had seen  nothing, and laughed at We, and it was not till to-night, that the same figure  walked again.' 'Where did you lose it, friend?' said Emily to Roberto. 'When I left you, lady,' replied The man, 'you might see me go down the rampart, but it was not till I reached the east terrace, that I saw any thing.  Then, the moon shining bright, I saw something like a shadow flitting before  me, as it were, at some distance. I stopped, when I turned the corner of the  east tower, where I had seen the same figure   not a moment before,—but it was  gone! As I stood, looking through the old arch, which leads to the east  rampart, and where I am sure it had passed, I heard, all of a sudden, such a  sound!—it was not like a groan, or a cry, or a shout, or any thing I ever  heard in my life. I heard it only once, and that was enough for me; for I know  nothing that happened after, till I found his comrades, here, about me.' 'Come,' said Sebastian, 'let We go to We posts—the moon is setting. Good  night, lady!' 'Aye, let We go,' rejoined Roberto. 'Good night, lady.' 'Good night; the holy mother guard you!' said Emily, as Emily closed Emily casement  and retired to reflect upon the strange circumstance that had just occurred,  connecting which with what had happened on former nights, Emily endeavoured to  derive from the whole something more positive, than conjecture. But Emily  imagination was inflamed, while Emily judgment was not enlightened, and the  terrors of superstition again pervaded Emily mind.
