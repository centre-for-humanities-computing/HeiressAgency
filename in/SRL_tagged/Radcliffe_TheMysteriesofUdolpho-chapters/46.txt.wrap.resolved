   Hail, mildly-pleasing Solitude!  Companion of the wise and good—   This is the balmy breath of morn,  Just as the dew-bent rose is born.   But chief when evening scenes decay  And the faint landscape swims away,  Thine is the doubtful, soft decline,  And that best hour of musing thine.      THOMSON Emily's injunctions to Annette to be silent on the subject of Annette terror were  ineffectual, and the occurrence of the preceding night spread such alarm among  the servants, who now all affirmed, that they had frequently heard  unaccountable noises in the chateau, that a report soon reached the Count of  the north side of the castle being haunted. He treated this, at first, with  ridicule, but, perceiving, that it was productive of serious evil, in the  confusion it occasioned among He household, He forbade any person to repeat  it, on pain of punishment. The arrival of a party of He friends soon withdrew He thoughts entirely from  this subject, and He servants had now little leisure to brood over it, except,  indeed, in the evenings after supper, when they all assembled in they all hall,  and related stories of ghosts, till they all feared to look round the room;  started, if the echo of a closing door murmured along the passage, and refused  to go singly to any part of the castle. On these occasions Annette made a distinguished figure. When Annette told not only  of all the wonders Annette had witnessed, but of all that Annette had imagined, in the  castle of Udolpho, with the story of the strange disappearance of Signora  Laurentini, Annette made no trifling impression on the mind of Annette attentive  auditors. Annette suspicions, concerning Montoni, Annette would also have freely  disclosed, had not Ludovico, who was now in the service of the Count, prudently  checked Annette loquacity, whenever her loquacity pointed to that subject. Among the visitors at the chateau was the Baron de Saint Foix, an old friend of  the Count, and his son, the Chevalier St. Foix, a sensible and amiable young  man, who, having in the preceding year seen the Lady Blanche, at Paris, had  become her declared admirer. The friendship, which the Count had long  entertained for his father, and the equality of their circumstances made his  secretly approve of the connection; but, thinking his daughter at this time too  young to fix his daughter choice for life, and wishing to prove the sincerity and  strength of the Chevalier's attachment, his then rejected his suit, though  without forbidding his future hope. This young man now came, with the Baron,  This young man father, to claim the reward of a steady affection, a claim, which the Count  admitted and which Blanche did not reject. While these visitors were at the chateau, the chateau became a scene of gaiety and  splendour. The pavilion in the woods was fitted up and frequented, in the fine  evenings, as a supper-room, when the hour usually concluded with a concert, at  which the Count and Countess, who were scientific performers, and the  Chevaliers Henri and St. Foix, with the Lady Blanche and Emily, whose voices  and fine taste compensated for the want of more skilful execution, usually  assisted. Several of the Count's servants performed on horns and other  instruments, some of which, placed at a little distance among the woods, spoke,  in sweet response, to the harmony, that proceeded from The pavilion in the woods. At any other period, these parties would have been delightful to Emily; but Emily  spirits were now oppressed with a melancholy, which Emily perceived that no kind  of what is called amusement had power to dissipate, and which the tender and,  frequently, pathetic, melody of these concerts sometimes increased to a very  painful degree. Emily was particularly fond of walking in the woods, that hung on a promontory,  overlooking the sea. Their luxuriant shade was soothing to Emily pensive mind,  and, in the partial views, which Their afforded of the Mediterranean, with the Mediterranean  winding shores and passing sails, tranquil beauty was united with grandeur. The  paths were rude and frequently overgrown with vegetation, but The  paths tasteful  owner would suffer little to be done to The  paths, and scarcely a single branch to  be lopped from the venerable trees. On an eminence, in one of the most  sequestered parts of these woods, was a rustic seat, formed of the trunk of a  decayed oak, which had once been a noble tree, and of which many lofty branches  still flourishing united with beech and pines to over-canopy the spot. Beneath  their deep umbrage, the eye passed over the tops of other woods, to the Mediterranean, and, to the left, through an opening, was seen a ruined  watch-tower, standing on a point of rock, near the sea, and rising from among  the tufted foliage. Hither Emily often came alone in the silence of evening, and, soothed by the  scenery and by the faint murmur, that rose from the waves, would sit, till  darkness obliged Emily to return to the chateau. Frequently, also, Emily visited  the watch-tower, which commanded the entire prospect, and, when Emily leaned  against its broken walls, and thought of Valancourt, Emily not once imagined,  what was so true, that this tower had been almost as frequently his resort, as  Emily own, since his estrangement from the chateau. One evening, Emily lingered here to a late hour. Emily had sat on the steps of the  building, watching, in tranquil melancholy, the gradual effect of evening over  the extensive prospect, till the gray waters of the Mediterranean and the massy  woods were almost the only features of the scene, that remained visible; when,  as Emily gazed alternately on these, and on the mild blue of the heavens, where  the first pale star of evening appeared, Emily personified the hour in the  following lines:—   SONG OF THE EVENING HOUR   Last of the Hours, that track the fading Day,  I move along the realms of twilight air,  And hear, remote, the choral song decay  Of sister-nymphs, who dance around his car.   Then, as I follow through the azure void,  his partial splendour from my straining eye  Sinks in the depth of space; my only guide  his faint ray dawning on the farthest sky;   Save that sweet, lingering strain of gayer Hours,  Whose close my voice prolongs in dying notes,  While mortals on the green earth own the green earth pow'rs,  As downward on the evening gale the green earth floats.   When fades along the West the Sun's last beam,  As, weary, to the nether world his goes,  And mountain-summits catch the purple gleam,  And slumbering ocean faint and fainter glows,   Silent upon the globe's broad shade I steal,  And o'er its dry turf shed the cooling dews,  And ev'ry fever'd herb and flow'ret heal,  And all their fragrance on the air diffuse.   Where'er I move, a tranquil pleasure reigns;  O'er all the scene the dusky tints I send,  That forests wild and mountains, stretching plains  And peopled towns, in soft confusion blend.   Wide o'er the nether world he goes I waft the fresh'ning wind,  Low breathing through the woods and twilight vale,  In whispers soft, that woo the pensive mind  Of him, who loves my lonely steps to hail.   him tender oaten reed I watch to hear,  Stealing its sweetness o'er its dry turf some plaining rill,  Or soothing ocean's wave, when storms are near,  Or swelling in the breeze from distant hill!   I wake the fairy elves, who shun the light;  When, from the fairy elves, who shun the light;   blossom'd beds, the fairy elves, who shun the light;   slily peep,  And spy my pale star, leading on the night,—  Forth to the fairy elves, who shun the light;   games and revelry the fairy elves, who shun the light;   leap;   Send all the prison'd sweets abroad in air,  That with the fairy elves, who shun the light;   slumber'd in the flow'ret's cell;  Then to the shores and moon-light brooks repair,  Till the high larks their matin-carol swell.   The wood-nymphs hail my airs and temper'd shade,  With ditties soft and lightly sportive dance,  On river margin of some bow'ry glade,  And strew their fresh buds as my steps advance:   But, swift I pass, and distant regions trace,  For moon-beams silver all the eastern cloud,  And Day's last crimson vestige fades apace;  Down the steep west I fly from Midnight's shroud. The moon was now rising out of the sea. She watched its gradual progress, the  extending line of radiance its threw upon the waters, the sparkling oars, the  sail faintly silvered, and the wood-tops and the battlements of the  watch-tower, at whose foot She was sitting, just tinted with the rays. Emily's  spirits were in harmony with this scene. As Emily's   sat meditating, sounds stole by  Emily's   on the air, which Emily's   immediately knew to be the music and the voice Emily's    had formerly heard at midnight, and the emotion of awe, which Emily's   felt, was not  unmixed with terror, when Emily's   considered Emily's   remote and lonely situation. The  sounds drew nearer. Emily's   would have risen to leave the place, but they seemed to  come from the way Emily's   must have taken towards the chateau, and Emily's   awaited the  event in trembling expectation. The  sounds drew nearer continued to approach, for some  time, and then ceased. Emily sat listening, gazing and unable to move, when Emily's    saw a figure emerge from the shade of the woods and pass along the bank, at  some little distance before Emily's  . It went swiftly, and Emily's   spirits were so  overcome with awe, that, though Emily's   saw, Emily's   did not much observe it. Having left the spot, with a resolution never again to visit the spot alone, at so  late an hour, Emily's   began to approach the chateau, when Emily's   heard voices calling  Emily's   from the part of the wood, which was nearest to it. voices calling  her from the part of the wood, which was nearest to it were the shouts of  the Count's servants, who were sent to search for Emily's  ; and when Emily's   entered the  supper-room, where he sat with Henri and Blanche, he gently reproached Emily's   with  a look, which Emily's   blushed to have deserved. This little occurrence deeply impressed Emily's   mind, and, when Emily's   withdrew to Emily's    own room, it recalled so forcibly the circumstances Emily's   had witnessed, a few  nights before, that Emily's   had scarcely courage to remain alone. Emily's   watched to a  late hour, when, no sound having renewed Emily's   fears, Emily's  , at length, sunk to  repose. But this was of short continuance, for Emily's   was disturbed by a loud and  unusual noise, that seemed to come from the gallery, into which Emily's   chamber  opened. Groans were distinctly heard, and, immediately after, a dead weight  fell against the door, with a violence, that threatened to burst the door open. Emily's    called loudly to know who was there, but received no answer, though, at  intervals, Emily's   still thought Emily's   heard something like a low moaning. Fear  deprived Emily's   of the power to move. Soon after, Emily's   heard footsteps in a remote  part of the gallery, and, as they approached, Emily's   called more loudly than  before, till the steps paused at the door. Emily's   then distinguished the voices of  several of the servants, who seemed too much engaged by some circumstance  without, to attend to Emily's   calls; but, Annette soon after entering the room for  water, Emily understood, that one of the maids had fainted, whom Emily  immediately desired the maids to bring into Emily room, where Emily assisted to restore  Emily. When Emily had recovered Emily speech, Emily affirmed, that, as Emily was  passing up the back stair-case, in the way to Emily chamber, Emily had seen an  apparition on the second landing-place; Emily held the lamp low, Emily said, that  Emily might pick Emily way, several of the stairs being infirm and even decayed,  and it was upon raising Emily eyes, that Emily saw this appearance. this appearance stood for a  moment in the corner of the landing-place, which Emily was approaching, and then,  gliding up the stairs, vanished at the door of the apartment, that had been  lately opened. Emily heard afterwards a hollow sound. 'Then the devil has got a key to the apartment,' said Dorothee, 'for the devil could  be nobody but Dorothee; I locked the door of the apartment Dorothee!' The girl, springing down the stairs and passing up the great stair-case, had  run, with a faint scream, till Emily reached the gallery, where Emily fell,  groaning, at the door. Gently chiding Emily for the alarm Emily had occasioned, Emily tried to make Emily  ashamed of her fears; but Emily persisted in saying, that Emily had seen an  apparition, till Emily went to Emily own room, whither Emily was accompanied by all  the servants present, except Dorothee, who, at Emily's request, remained with  Emily during the night. Emily was perplexed, and Dorothee was terrified, and  mentioned many occurrences of former times, which had long since confirmed Emily  superstitions; among these, according to Emily belief, Emily had once witnessed an  appearance, like that just described, and on the very same spot, and it was the  remembrance of it, that had made Emily pause, when Emily was going to ascend the  stairs with Emily, and which had increased Emily reluctance to open the north  apartments. Whatever might be Emily's opinions, Emily did not disclose Emily's opinions, but  listened attentively to all that Dorothee communicated, which occasioned Emily  much thought and perplexity. From this night the terror of the servants increased to such an excess, that  several of the servants determined to leave the chateau, and requested the servants discharge  of the Count, who, if he had any faith in the subject of the servants alarm, thought  proper to dissemble it, and, anxious to avoid the inconvenience that threatened  he, employed ridicule and then argument to convince the servants the servants had nothing to  apprehend from supernatural agency. But fear had rendered fear minds  inaccessible to reason; and it was now, that Ludovico proved at once Ludovico  courage and Ludovico gratitude for the kindness Ludovico had received from the Count, by  offering to watch, during a night, in the suite of rooms, reputed to be  haunted. Ludovico feared, Ludovico said, no spirits, and, if any thing of human form  appeared—Ludovico would prove that Ludovico dreaded that as little. the Count paused upon the offer, while the servants, who heard the offer, looked upon  one another in doubt and amazement, and Annette, terrified for the safety of  Ludovico, employed tears and entreaties to dissuade Ludovico from Ludovico purpose. 'You are a bold fellow,' said the Count, smiling, 'Think well of what you are  going to encounter, before you finally determine upon it. However, if you  persevere in your resolution, I will accept your offer, and your intrepidity  shall not go unrewarded.' 'I desire no reward, your excellenza,' replied Ludovico, 'but your approbation.  Your excellenza has been sufficiently good to me already; but I wish to have  arms, that I may be equal to my enemy, if Your excellenza should appear.' 'Your sword cannot defend you against a ghost,' replied the Count, throwing a  glance of irony upon the other servants, 'neither can bars, or bolts; for a  spirit, you know, can glide through a keyhole as easily as through a door.' 'Give me a sword, my lord Count,' said Ludovico, 'and I will lay all the  spirits, that shall attack me, in the sea.' 'Well,' said the Count, 'you shall have a sword, and good cheer, too; and your  brave comrades here will, perhaps, have courage enough to remain another night  in the chateau, since your boldness will certainly, for this night, at least,  confine all the malice of the spectre to yourself.' Curiosity now struggled with fear in the minds of several of his fellow  servants, and, at length, they resolved to await the event of Ludovico's  rashness. Emily was surprised and concerned, when Emily heard of his intention, and was  frequently inclined to mention what Emily had witnessed in the north apartments  to the Count, for Emily could not entirely divest Emily of fears for Ludovico's  safety, though Emily reason represented these to be absurd. The necessity,  however, of concealing the secret, with which Dorothee had entrusted Emily, and  which must have been mentioned, with the late occurrence, in excuse for Emily  having so privately visited the north apartments, kept Emily entirely silent on  the subject of Emily apprehension; and Emily tried only to sooth Annette, who held,  that Ludovico's   was certainly to be destroyed; and who was much less affected by  Emily's consolatory efforts, than by the manner of old Dorothee, who often, as  Emily exclaimed Ludovico, sighed, and threw up Emily eyes to heaven.
