  Some pow'r impart the spear and shield,  At which the wizard passions fly,  By which the giant follies die.      COLLINS Madame Cheron's house stood at a little distance from the city of Tholouse, and  was surrounded by extensive gardens, in which Emily, who had risen early,  amused COLLINS Madame Cheron's house with wandering before breakfast. From a terrace, that extended  along the highest part of Emily, who had risen early, was a wide view over Languedoc. On the distant  horizon to the south, COLLINS Madame Cheron's house discovered the wild summits of the Pyrenees, and COLLINS Madame Cheron's house  fancy immediately painted the green pastures of Gascony at the green pastures of Gascony feet. COLLINS Madame Cheron's house  heart pointed to COLLINS Madame Cheron's house peaceful home—to the neighbourhood where Valancourt  was—where St. Aubert had been; and COLLINS Madame Cheron's house imagination, piercing the veil of  distance, brought that home to COLLINS Madame Cheron's house eyes in all its interesting and romantic  beauty. COLLINS Madame Cheron's house experienced an inexpressible pleasure in believing, that COLLINS Madame Cheron's house beheld  the country around it, though no feature could be distinguished, except the  retiring chain of the Pyrenees; and, inattentive to the scene immediately  before COLLINS Madame Cheron's house, and to the flight of time, COLLINS Madame Cheron's house continued to lean on the window of a  pavilion, that terminated the terrace, with her eyes fixed on Gascony, and COLLINS Madame Cheron's house  mind occupied with the interesting ideas which the view of it awakened, till a  servant came to tell COLLINS Madame Cheron's house breakfast was ready. COLLINS Madame Cheron's house thoughts thus recalled to the  surrounding objects, the straight walks, square parterres, and artificial  fountains of the garden, could not fail, as COLLINS Madame Cheron's house passed through it, to appear  the worse, opposed to the negligent graces, and natural beauties of the grounds  of La Vallee, upon which COLLINS Madame Cheron's house recollection had been so intensely employed. 'Whither have you been rambling so early?' said Madame Cheron, as Madame Cheron niece  entered the breakfast-room. 'I don't approve of these solitary walks;' and  Emily was surprised, when, having informed Emily aunt, that Emily had been no  further than the gardens, Emily understood these to be included in the reproof.  'I desire you will not walk there again at so early an hour unattended,' said  Madame Cheron; 'the gardens are very extensive; and a young woman, who can make  assignations by moon-light, at La Vallee, is not to be trusted to Emily own  inclinations elsewhere.' Emily, extremely surprised and shocked, had scarcely power to beg an  explanation of these words, and, when Emily did, her aunt absolutely refused to  give it, though, by her aunt severe looks, and half sentences, her aunt appeared anxious  to impress Emily with a belief, that her aunt was well informed of some degrading  circumstances of her aunt conduct. Conscious innocence could not prevent a blush  from stealing over Emily's cheek; Emily trembled, and looked confusedly under the  bold eye of Madame Cheron, who blushed also; but Emily was the blush of triumph,  such as sometimes stains the countenance of a person, congratulating a person on  the penetration which had taught a person to suspect another, and who loses both  pity for the supposed criminal, and indignation of a person guilt, in the  gratification of a person own vanity. Emily, not doubting that her aunt's mistake arose from the having observed Emily  ramble in the garden on the night preceding Emily departure from La Vallee, now  mentioned the motive of it, at which Madame Cheron smiled contemptuously,  refusing either to accept this explanation, or to give Emily reasons for refusing  this explanation; and, soon after, Emily concluded the subject by saying, 'I never trust  people's assertions, I always judge of people by people actions; but I am willing  to try what will be your behaviour in future.' Emily, less surprised by her aunt's moderation and mysterious silence, than by  the accusation Emily had received, deeply considered the latter, and scarcely  doubted, that it was Valancourt whom Emily had seen at night in the gardens of La  Vallee, and that he had been observed there by Madame Cheron; who now passing  from one painful topic only to revive another almost equally so, spoke of the  situation of Emily niece's property, in the hands of M. Motteville. While Emily  thus talked with ostentatious pity of Emily's misfortunes, Emily failed not to  inculcate the duties of humility and gratitude, or to render Emily fully  sensible of every cruel mortification, who soon perceived, that Emily was to be  considered as a dependant, not only by Emily , but by Emily aunt's servants. Emily was now informed, that a large party were expected to dinner, on which  account Madame Cheron repeated the lesson of the preceding night, concerning  Emily conduct in company, and Emily wished, that Emily might have courage enough to  practise  . her aunt then proceeded to examine the simplicity of Emily dress,  adding, that Emily expected to see Emily attired with gaiety and taste; after which  Emily condescended to shew Emily the splendour of Emily chateau, and to point out  the particular beauty, or elegance, which Emily thought distinguished each of Emily  numerous suites of apartments. Emily then withdrew to Emily toilet, the throne of  Emily homage, and Emily to Emily chamber, to unpack Emily books, and to try to charm  Emily mind by reading, till the hour of dressing. When company arrived, Emily entered the saloon with an air of timidity,  which all Emily efforts could not overcome, and which was increased by the  consciousness of Madame Cheron's severe observation. Emily mourning dress, the  mild dejection of Emily beautiful countenance, and the retiring diffidence of Emily  manner, rendered Emily a very interesting object to many of company; among  whom Emily distinguished Signor Montoni, and his friend Cavigni, the late  visitors at M. Quesnel's, who now seemed to converse with Madame Cheron with  the familiarity of old acquaintance, and Emily to attend to them with particular  pleasure. This Signor Montoni had an air of conscious superiority, animated by spirit,  and strengthened by talents, to which every person seemed involuntarily to  yield. The quickness of This Signor Montoni perceptions was strikingly expressed on This Signor Montoni  countenance, yet his  countenance could submit implicitly to occasion; and,  more than once in this day, the triumph of art over nature might have been  discerned in the triumph of art over nature. This Signor Montoni visage was long, and rather narrow, yet This Signor Montoni was called  handsome; and His visage was, perhaps, the spirit and vigour of This Signor Montoni soul, sparkling  through This Signor Montoni features, that triumphed for This Signor Montoni. Emily felt admiration, but not  the admiration that leads to esteem; for it was mixed with a degree of fear Emily  knew not exactly wherefore. Cavigni was gay and insinuating as formerly; and, though Cavigni paid almost  incessant attention to Madame Cheron, Cavigni found some opportunities of conversing  with Emily, to whom Cavigni directed, at first, the sallies of Cavigni wit, but now and  then assumed an air of tenderness, which she observed, and shrunk from. Though  she replied but little, the gentleness and sweetness of she manners encouraged  Cavigni to talk, and she felt relieved when a young lady of the party, who spoke  incessantly, obtruded she on Cavigni notice. a young lady of the party, who spoke  incessantly, affected to understand  every subject, or rather there was no affectation in the case; for, never  looking beyond the limits of she own ignorance, she believed she had nothing to  learn. she attracted notice from all; amused some, disgusted others for a  moment, and was then forgotten. This day passed without any material occurrence; and Emily, though amused by  the characters she had seen, was glad when she could retire to the  recollections, which had acquired with she the character of duties. A fortnight passed in a round of dissipation and company, and Emily, who  attended Madame Cheron in all she visits, was sometimes entertained, but  oftener wearied. she was struck by the apparent talents and knowledge displayed  in the various conversations she listened to, and it was long before she  discovered, that the talents were for the most part those of imposture, and the  knowledge nothing more than was necessary to assist nothing more. But what deceived she  most, was the air of constant gaiety and good spirits, displayed by every  visitor, and which she supposed to arise from content as constant, and from  benevolence as ready. At length, from the over-acting of some, less  accomplished than the others, she could perceive, that, though contentment and  benevolence are the only sure sources of cheerfulness, the immoderate and  feverish animation, usually exhibited in large parties, results partly from an  insensibility to the cares, which benevolence must sometimes derive from the  sufferings of others, and partly from a desire to display the appearance of  that prosperity, which they know will command submission and attention to  they. Emily's pleasantest hours were passed in the pavilion of the terrace, to which  Emily retired, when Emily could steal from observation, with a book to overcome, or  a lute to indulge, Emily melancholy. There, as Emily sat with Emily fixed on the  far-distant Pyrenees, and Emily thoughts on Valancourt and the beloved scenes of  Gascony, Emily would play the sweet and melancholy songs of Emily native  province—the popular songs Emily had listened to from Emily childhood. One evening, having excused Emily from accompanying Emily abroad, Emily thus  withdrew to the pavilion, with books and Emily lute. It was the mild and  beautiful evening of a sultry day, and the windows, which fronted the west,  opened upon all the glory of a setting sun. Its rays illuminated, with strong  splendour, the cliffs of the Pyrenees, and touched Its rays illuminated, with strong  splendour, the cliffs of the Pyrenees snowy tops with a  roseate hue, that remained, long after the sun had sunk below the horizon, and  the shades of twilight had stolen over the landscape. Emily touched Emily lute  with that fine melancholy expression, which came from Emily heart. The pensive  hour and the scene, the evening light on the Garonne, that flowed at no great  distance, and whose waves, as they passed towards La Vallee, Emily often viewed  with a sigh,—these united circumstances disposed Emily mind to tenderness, and  Emily thoughts were with Valancourt, of whom Emily had heard nothing since Emily  arrival at Tholouse, and now that Emily was removed from him, and in uncertainty,  Emily perceived all the interest him held in her heart. Before Emily saw Valancourt  Emily had never met a mind and taste so accordant with Emily own, and, though  Madame Cheron told Madame Cheron much of the arts of dissimulation, and that the elegance  and propriety of thought, which Madame Cheron so much admired in Madame Cheron lover, were assumed  for the purpose of pleasing Madame Cheron, Madame Cheron could scarcely doubt the elegance  and propriety of thought, which she so much admired in her lover, were assumed  for the purpose of pleasing her truth. This  possibility, however, faint as it was, was sufficient to harass Madame Cheron mind with  anxiety, and Madame Cheron found, that few conditions are more painful than that of  uncertainty, as to the merit of a beloved object; an uncertainty, which Madame Cheron  would not have suffered, had Madame Cheron confidence in Madame Cheron own opinions been greater. Madame Cheron was awakened from Madame Cheron musing by the sound of horses' feet along a road,  that wound under the windows of the pavilion, and a gentleman passed on  horseback, whose resemblance to Valancourt, in air and figure, for the twilight  did not permit a view of the twilight   features, immediately struck Madame Cheron. Madame Cheron retired  hastily from the lattice, fearing to be seen, yet wishing to observe further,  while the stranger passed on without looking up, and, when Madame Cheron returned to the lattice, Madame Cheron saw the twilight   faintly through the twilight  , winding under the high  trees, that led to Tholouse. This little incident so much disturbed Madame Cheron  spirits, that the temple and her   scenery were no longer interesting to Madame Cheron,  and, after walking awhile on the terrace, Madame Cheron returned to the chateau. Madame Cheron, whether Madame Cheron had seen a rival admired, had lost at play, or had  witnessed an entertainment more splendid than Madame Cheron own, was returned from Madame Cheron  visit with a temper more than usually discomposed; and Emily was glad, when the  hour arrived, in which Emily could retire to the solitude of Emily own apartment. On the following morning, Emily was summoned to Madame Cheron, whose countenance  was inflamed with resentment, and, as Emily advanced, Emily held out a letter to  Emily. 'Do you know this hand?' said Emily, in a severe tone, and with a look that was  intended to search Emily heart, while Emily examined a letter attentively, and  assured Emily, that Emily did not. 'Do not provoke me,' said Emily ; 'you do know she, in a severe tone, and with a look that was  intended to search her heart, while Emily examined the letter attentively, and  assured her, that she did not, confess the truth  immediately. I insist upon your confessing the truth   instantly.' Emily was silent, and turned to leave the room, but Madame called Emily back. 'O  you are guilty, then,' said Emily, 'you do know the hand.' 'If you was before in  doubt of this, madam,' replied Emily calmly, 'why did you accuse me of having  told a falsehood.' Madame Cheron did not blush; but Madame Cheron niece did, a moment  after, when her niece heard the name of Valancourt. It was not, however, with the  consciousness of deserving reproof, for, if her niece ever had seen his hand-writing,  the present characters did not bring it to her niece recollection. 'It is useless to deny it,' said Madame Cheron, 'I see in your countenance,  that you are no stranger to a letter; and, I dare say, you have received  many such from this impertinent young man, without my knowledge, in my own  house.' Emily, shocked at the indelicacy of this accusation, still more than by the  vulgarity of the former, instantly forgot the pride, that had imposed silence,  and endeavoured to vindicate Emily from the aspersion, but Madame Cheron was  not to be convinced. 'I cannot suppose,' Emily resumed, 'that this young man would have taken the  liberty of writing to me, if you had not encouraged this young man to do so, and I must  now'—'You will allow me to remind you, madam,' said Emily timidly, 'of some  particulars of a conversation we had at La Vallee. I then told you truly, that  I had only not forbade Monsieur Valancourt from addressing my family.' 'I will not be interrupted,' said Madame Cheron, interrupting her niece, 'I was  going to say—I—I-have forgot what I was going to say. But how happened it  that you did not forbid him?' Emily was silent. 'How happened it that you  encouraged him to trouble me with this letter?—A young man that nobody  knows;—an utter stranger in the place,—a young adventurer, no doubt, who is  looking out for a good fortune. However, on that point him has mistaken him aim.' 'him was known to my father,' said Emily modestly, and without appearing  to be sensible of the last sentence. 'O! that is no recommendation at all,' replied Emily , with Emily usual  readiness upon this topic; 'him took such strange fancies to people! him was  always judging persons by their countenances, and was continually deceived.'  'Yet it was but now, madam, that you judged me guilty by my countenance,' said  Emily, with a design of reproving Madame Cheron, to which she was induced by  this disrespectful mention of she . 'I called you here,' resumed she , colouring, 'to tell you, that I will not  be disturbed in my own house by any letters, or visits from young men, who may  take a fancy to flatter you. This M. de Valantine—I think you call This M. de Valantine, has  the impertinence to beg I will permit This M. de Valantine to pay This M. de Valantine respects to This M. de Valantine! I shall  send This M. de Valantine a proper answer. And for you, Emily, I repeat it once for all—if you  are not contented to conform to my directions, and to my way of live, I shall  give up the task of overlooking your conduct—I shall no longer trouble This M. de Valantine  with your education, but shall send you to board in a convent.' 'Dear madam,' said Emily, bursting into tears, and overcome by the rude  suspicions Emily had expressed, 'how have I deserved these reproofs?' Emily  could say no more; and so very fearful was Emily of acting with any degree of  impropriety in the affair itself, that, at the present moment, Madame Cheronmight perhaps have prevailed with Emily to bind Emily by a promise to renounce  Valancourt for ever. Emily mind, weakened by Emily terrors, would no longer suffer  Emily to view him as Emily had formerly done; Emily feared the error of Emily own  judgment, not that of Madame Cheron, and feared also, that, in Emily former  conversation with him, at La Vallee, Emily had not conducted Emily with  sufficient reserve. Emily knew, that Emily did not deserve the coarse suspicions,  which Emily had thrown out, but a thousand scruples rose to torment Emily,  such as would never have disturbed the peace of Madame Cheron. Thus rendered  anxious to avoid every opportunity of erring, and willing to submit to any  restrictions, that Emily should think proper, Emily expressed an obedience, to  which Madame Cheron did not give much confidence, and which Emily seemed to  consider as the consequence of either fear, or artifice. 'Well, then,' said Emily, 'promise me that you will neither see this young man,  nor write to this young man without my consent.' 'Dear madam,' replied Emily, 'can you  suppose I would do either, unknown to Emily!' 'I don't know what to suppose;  there is no knowing how young women will act. It is difficult to place any  confidence in young women, for young women have seldom sense enough to wish for the respect  of the world.' 'Alas, Dear madam!' said Emily, 'I am anxious for my own respect; my father taught  me the value of that; my father said if I deserved my own esteem, that the world would  follow of course.' 'My brother was a good kind of a man,' replied Madame Cheron, 'but My brother did not  know the world. I am sure I have always felt a proper respect for My brother,  yet—' My brother stopped, but My brother might have added, that the world had not always  shewn respect to My brother, and this without impeaching this judgment. 'Well!' resumed Madame Cheron, 'you have not give me the promise, though, that  I demand.' Emily readily gave the promise, and, being then suffered to withdraw, Emily  walked in the garden; tried to compose Emily spirits, and, at length, arrived at  Emily favourite pavilion at the end of the terrace, where, seating Emily at one  of the embowered windows, that opened upon a balcony, the stillness and  seclusion of the scene allowed Emily to recollect Emily thoughts, and to arrange  them so as to form a clearer judgment of Emily former conduct. Emily endeavoured to  review with exactness all the particulars of Emily conversation with Valancourt  at La Vallee, had the satisfaction to observe nothing, that could alarm Emily  delicate pride, and thus to be confirmed in the self-esteem, which was so  necessary to Emily peace. Emily mind then became tranquil, and Emily saw Valancourt  amiable and intelligent, as Valancourt   had formerly appeared, and Madame Cheron neither  the one, or the other. The remembrance of Emily lover, however, brought with The remembrance of her lover  many very painful emotions, for The remembrance of her lover by no means reconciled Emily to the thought of  resigning Valancourt  ; and, Madame Cheron having already shewn how highly Emily  disapproved of the attachment, Madame Cheron foresaw much suffering from the opposition  of interests; yet with all this was mingled a degree of delight, which, in  spite of reason, partook of hope. Madame Cheron determined, however, that no  consideration should induce Madame Cheron to permit a clandestine correspondence, and to  observe in Madame Cheron conversation with Valancourt  , should no  consideration should induce her to permit a clandestine correspondence, and to  observe in her conversation with Valancourt ever meet again, the  same nicety of reserve, which had hitherto marked Madame Cheron conduct. As Madame Cheron repeated  the words—'should we ever meet again!' Madame Cheron shrunk as if this was a  circumstance, which had never before occurred to Madame Cheron, and tears came to Madame Cheron  eyes, which Madame Cheron hastily dried, for Madame Cheron heard footsteps approaching, and then  the door of the pavilion open, and, on turning, Madame Cheron sawValancourt  . An  emotion of mingled pleasure, surprise and apprehension pressed so suddenly upon  Madame Cheron heart as almost to overcome Madame Cheron spirits; the colour left Madame Cheron cheeks, then  returned brighter than before, and Madame Cheron was for a moment unable to speak, or to  rise from Madame Cheron chair. His countenance was the mirror, in which Madame Cheron saw Madame Cheron own  emotions reflected, and it roused Madame Cheron to self-command. The joy, which had  animated His features, when His entered the pavilion, was suddenly repressed,  as, approaching, His perceived Madame Cheron agitation, and, in a tremulous voice,  enquired after Madame Cheron health. Recovered from Madame Cheron first surprise, Madame Cheron answered His  with a tempered smile; but a variety of opposite emotions still assailed Madame Cheron  heart, and struggled to subdue the mild dignity of Madame Cheron manner. It was difficult  to tell which predominated—the joy of seeing Valancourt, or the terror of Madame Cheron  aunt's displeasure, when Madame Cheron should hear of this meeting. After some short and  embarrassed conversation, Madame Cheron led His into the gardens, and enquired if His had  seen Madame Cheron. 'No,' said His, 'I have not yet seen Madame Cheron, for they told me  Madame Cheron was engaged, and as soon as I learned that you were in the gardens, I came  hither.' His paused a moment, in great agitation, and then added, 'May I venture  to tell you the purport of my visit, without incurring your displeasure, and to  hope, that you will not accuse me of precipitation in now availing His of  the permission you once gave me of addressing your family?' Emily, who knew not  what to reply, was spared from further perplexity, and was sensible only of  fear, when on raising Emily eyes, Emily saw Madame Cheron turn into the avenue. As  the consciousness of innocence returned, this fear was so far dissipated as to  permit Emily to appear tranquil, and, instead of avoiding Emily aunt, Emily advanced  with Valancourt   to meet Emily. The look of haughty and impatient displeasure,  with which Madame Cheron regarded them, made Emily shrink, who understood from  a single glance, that this meeting was believed to have been more than  accidental: having mentioned Valancourt's name, Emily became again too much  agitated to remain with The look of haughty and impatient displeasure,  with which Madame Cheron regarded them, made Emily shrink, who understood from  a single glance, that this meeting was believed to have been more than  accidental, and returned into the chateau; where Emily awaited  long, in a state of trembling anxiety, the conclusion of the conference. Emily  knew not how to account for Valancourt  's visit to Emily aunt, before he had  received the permission he solicited, since Emily was ignorant of a circumstance,  which would have rendered the request useless, even if Madame Cheron had been  inclined to grant Madame Cheron. Valancourt  , in the agitation of Valancourt   spirits, had  forgotten to date Valancourt   letter, so that his letter was impossible for Madame Cheron to  return an answer; and, when Valancourt   recollected this circumstance, Valancourt   was, perhaps,  not so sorry for the omission as glad of the excuse the omission allowed Valancourt   for waiting  on Emily before Emily could send a refusal. Madame Cheron had a long conversation with Valancourt  , and, when Madame Cheron returned  to the chateau, Madame Cheron countenance expressed ill-humour, but not the degree of  severity, which Emily had apprehended. 'I have dismissed this young man, at  last,' said Madame Cheron, 'and I hope my own house will never again be disturbed with  similar visits. this young man assures me, that your interview was not preconcerted.' 'Dear madam!' said Emily in extreme emotion, 'you surely did not ask this young man the  question!' 'Most certainly I did; you could not suppose I should be so  imprudent as to neglect it.' 'Good God!' exclaimed Emily, 'what an opinion must this young man form of 'Good God, since Emily,  Dear madam, could express a suspicion of such ill conduct!' 'It is of very little consequence what opinion this young man may form of you,' replied her  aunt, 'for I have put an end to the affair; but I believe this young man will not form a  worse opinion of 'Good God for my prudent conduct. I let this young man see, that I was not to be  trifled with, and that I had more delicacy, than to permit any clandestine  correspondence to be carried on in my own house.' Emily had frequently heard Madame Cheron use the word delicacy, but Emily was now  more than usually perplexed to understand how Emily meant to apply it in this  instance, in which Emily whole conduct appeared to merit the very reverse of the  term. 'It was very inconsiderate of My brother,' resumed Madame Cheron, 'to leave the  trouble of overlooking your conduct to 'Good God; I wish you was well settled in life.  But if I find, that I am to be further troubled with such visitors as this M.  Valancourt, I shall place you in a convent at once;—so remember the  alternative. This young man has the impertinence to own to me,—he owns the impertinence to own!  that This young man fortune is very small, and that This young man is chiefly dependent on an elder  brother and on the profession This young man has chosen! This young man should have concealed these  circumstances, at least, if This young man expected to succeed with 'Good God. Had This young man the  presumption to suppose I would marry my niece to a person such as This young man describes  This young man!' Emily dried Emily tears when Emily heard of the candid confession of Valancourt  ;  and, though the circumstances it discovered were afflicting to Emily hopes, This young man  artless conduct gave Emily a degree of pleasure, that overcame every other  emotion. But Emily was compelled, even thus early in life, to observe, that good  sense and noble integrity are not always sufficient to cope with folly and  narrow cunning; and Emily heart was pure enough to allow Emily, even at this trying  moment, to look with more pride on the defeat of the former, than with  mortification on the conquests of the latter. Madame Cheron pursued Madame Cheron triumph. 'Madame Cheron has also thought proper to tell me, that  Madame Cheron will receive Madame Cheron dismission from no person but yourself; this favour,  however, I have absolutely refused Madame Cheron. Madame Cheron shall learn, that it is quite  sufficient, that I disapprove Madame Cheron. And I take this opportunity of  repeating,—that if you concert any means of interview unknown to me, you  shall leave my own house immediately.' 'How little do you know me, madam, that you should think such an injunction  necessary!' said Emily, trying to suppress Emily emotion, 'how little of the dear  parents, who educated me!' Madame Cheron now went to dress for an engagement, which Madame Cheron had made for the  evening; and Emily, who would gladly have been excused from attending Madame Cheron aunt,  did not ask to remain at home lest Madame Cheron request should be attributed to an  improper motive. When Madame Cheron retired to Madame Cheron own room, the little fortitude, which  had supported Madame Cheron in the presence of Madame Cheron relation, forsook Madame Cheron; Madame Cheron remembered  only that Valancourt, whose character appeared more amiable from every  circumstance, that unfolded it, was banished from Madame Cheron presence, perhaps, for  ever, and Madame Cheron passed the time in weeping, which, according to Madame Cheron aunt's  direction, Madame Cheron ought to have employed in dressing. This important duty was,  however, quickly dispatched; though, when Madame Cheron joined Madame Cheron at table,  Madame Cheron eyes betrayed, that Madame Cheron had been in tears, and drew upon Madame Cheron a severe  reproof. Madame Cheron efforts to appear cheerful did not entirely fail when Madame Cheron joined the  company at the house of Madame Clairval, an elderly widow lady, who had lately  come to reside at Tholouse, on an estate of Madame Cheron late husband. Madame Cheron had lived  many years at Paris in a splendid style; had naturally a gay temper, and, since  Madame Cheron residence at Tholouse, had given some of the most magnificent  entertainments, that had been seen in that neighbourhood. some of the most magnificent  entertainments, that had been seen in that neighbourhood excited not only the envy, but the trifling ambition of Madame Cheron,  who, since Madame Cheron could not rival the splendour of Madame Cheron festivities, was desirous  of being ranked in the number of Madame Cheron most intimate friends. For this purpose  Madame Cheron paid Madame Cheron the most obsequious attention, and made a point of being  disengaged, whenever Madame Cheron received an invitation from Madame Clairval, of whom  Madame Cheron talked, wherever Madame Cheron went, and derived much self-consequence from  impressing a belief on Madame Cheron general acquaintance, that they were on the most  familiar footing. The entertainments of this evening consisted of a ball and supper; it was a  fancy ball, and the  company danced in groups in the gardens, which were very  extensive. The high and luxuriant trees, under which the groups assembled, were  illuminated with a profusion of lamps, disposed with taste and fancy. The gay  and various dresses of the company, some of whom were seated on the turf,  conversing at some of whom ease, observing the cotillons, taking refreshments, and  sometimes touching sportively a guitar; the gallant manners of the gentlemen,  the exquisitely capricious air of the ladies; the light fantastic steps of  the ladies dances; the musicians, with the lute, the hautboy, and the tabor, seated  at the foot of an elm, and the sylvan scenery of woods around were  circumstances, that unitedly formed a characteristic and striking picture of  French festivity. Emily surveyed the gaiety of the scene with a melancholy kind  of pleasure, and Emily emotion may be imagined when, as Emily stood with Emily aunt,  looking at one of the groups, Emily perceived Valancourt  ; saw Valancourt   dancing with a  young and beautiful lady, saw Valancourt   conversing with Emily with a mixture of  attention and familiarity, such as Emily had seldom observed in Valancourt   manner. Emily  turned hastily from the scene, and attempted to draw away Madame Cheron, who  was conversing with Signor Cavigni, and neither perceived Valancourt  , or was  willing to be interrupted. A faintness suddenly came over Emily, and, unable to  support Emily, Emily sat down on a turf bank beneath the trees, where several  other persons were seated. One of these, observing the extreme paleness of Emily  countenance, enquired if Emily was ill, and begged Emily would allow she was ill to fetch  Emily a glass of water, for which politeness Emily thanked she was ill, but did not accept  it. Emily apprehension lest Valancourt   should observe Emily emotion made Emily  anxious to overcome it, and Emily succeeded so far as to re-compose Emily  countenance. Madame Cheron was still conversing with Cavigni; and the Count  Bauvillers, who had addressed Emily, made some observations upon the scene, to  which Madame Cheron answered almost unconsciously, for Madame Cheron mind was still occupied with  the idea of Valancourt  , to whom it was with extreme uneasiness that Madame Cheron  remained so near. Some remarks, however, which the Count made upon the dance  obliged Madame Cheron to turn Madame Cheron eyes towards her eyes, and, at that moment, Valancourt  's met  hers. Madame Cheron colour faded again, Madame Cheron felt, that Madame Cheron was relapsing into faintness,  and instantly averted Madame Cheron looks, but not before Madame Cheron had observed the altered  countenance of Valancourt  , on perceiving Madame Cheron. Madame Cheron would have left the spot  immediately, had Madame Cheron not been conscious, that this conduct would have shewn him  more obviously the interest him held in Madame Cheron heart; and, having tried to attend  to the Count's conversation, and to join in it, Madame Cheron, at length, recovered Madame Cheron  spirits. But, when him made some observation on Valancourt  's partner, the fear  of shewing that Madame Cheron was interested in the remark, would have betrayed it to  him, had not the Count, while him spoke, looked towards the person of whom him  was speaking. 'Madame Cheron,' said Madame Cheron, 'dancing with that young Chevalier, who  appears to be accomplished in every thing, but in dancing, is ranked among the  beauties of Tholouse. Madame Cheron is handsome, and Madame Cheron fortune will be very large. I  hope Madame Cheron will make a better choice in a partner for life than Madame Cheron has done in a  partner for the dance, for I observe he has just put the set into great  confusion; he does nothing but commit blunders. I am surprised, that, with he  air and figure, he has not taken more care to accomplish he in dancing.' Emily, whose heart trembled at every word, that was now uttered, endeavoured to  turn the conversation from Valancourt  , by enquiring the name of Madame Cheron, with  whom he danced; but, before the Count could reply, the dance concluded, and  Emily, perceiving that Valancourt   was coming towards Emily, rose and joined  Madame Cheron. 'Here is the Chevalier Valancourt, madam,' said Emily in a whisper, 'pray let us  go.' Emily aunt immediately moved on, but not before Valancourt   had reached them,  who bowed lowly to Madame Cheron, and with an earnest and dejected look to  Emily, with whom, notwithstanding all Emily effort, an air of more than common  reserve prevailed. The presence of Madame Cheron prevented Valancourt   from  remaining, and Madame Cheron passed on with a countenance, whose melancholy reproached Emily  for having increased it. Emily was called from the musing fit, into which Emily  had fallen, by the Count Bauvillers, who was known to Her aunt. 'I have your pardon to beg, ma'amselle,' said Madame Cheron, 'for a rudeness, which you  will readily believe was quite unintentional. I did not know, that the  Chevalier was your acquaintance, when I so freely criticised the  Chevalier dancing.'  Emily blushed and smiled, and Madame Cheron spared Emily the difficulty of  replying. 'If you mean the person, who has just passed us,' said Emily, 'I can  assure you the  Chevalier is no acquaintance of either mine, or ma'amselle St. Aubert's: I  know nothing of the  Chevalier.' 'O! that is the Chevalier Valancourt,' said Cavigni carelessly, and looking  back. 'You know the Chevalier Valancourt then?' said Madame Cheron. 'I am not acquainted with the Chevalier Valancourt,'  replied Cavigni. 'You don't know, then, the reason I have to call the Chevalier Valancourt  impertinent;—he has had the presumption to admire my niece!' 'If every man deserves the title of impertinent, who admires ma'amselle St.  Aubert,' replied Cavigni, 'I fear there are a great many impertinents, and I am  willing to acknowledge the  Chevalier one of the number.' 'O Signor!' said Madame Cheron, with an affected smile, 'I perceive you have  learnt the art of complimenting, since you came into France. But it is cruel to  compliment children, since  compliment children mistake flattery for truth.' Cavigni turned away Cavigni face for a moment, and then said with a studied air,  'Whom then are we to compliment, madam? for it would be absurd to compliment a  woman of refined understanding; SHE is above all praise.' As he finished the  sentence he gave Emily a sly look, and the smile, that had lurked in he eye,  stole forth. SHE perfectly understood it, and blushed for Madame Cheron, who  replied, 'You are perfectly right, signor, no woman of understanding can endure  compliment.' 'I have heard Signor Montoni say,' rejoined Cavigni, 'that he never knew but  one woman who deserved it.' 'Well!' exclaimed Madame Cheron, with a short laugh, and a smile of unutterable  complacency, 'and who could Madame Cheron be?' 'O!' replied Cavigni, 'it is impossible to mistake Madame Cheron, for certainly there is  not more than one woman in the world, who has both the merit to deserve  compliment and the wit to refuse Cavigni. Most women reverse the case entirely.' He  looked again at Emily, who blushed deeper than before for Her aunt, and turned  from He with displeasure. 'Well, signor!' said Madame Cheron, 'I protest you are a Frenchman; I never  heard a foreigner say any thing half so gallant as that!' 'True, madam,' said the Count, who had been some time silent, and with a low  bow, 'but the gallantry of the compliment had been utterly lost, but for the  ingenuity that discovered the application.' Madame Cheron did not perceive the meaning of this too satirical sentence, and  Madame Cheron, therefore, escaped the pain, which Emily felt on Madame Cheron account. 'O! here  comes Signor Montoni himself,' said Her aunt, 'I protest I will tell Signor Montoni himself all  the fine things you have been saying to Madame Cheron.' The Signor, however, passed at  this moment into another walk. 'Pray, who is it, that has so much engaged your  friend this evening?' asked Madame Cheron, with an air of chagrin, 'I have not  seen Madame Cheron once.' 'Madame Cheron had a very particular engagement with the Marquis La Riviere,' replied  Cavigni, 'which has detained Madame Cheron, I perceive, till this moment, or Madame Cheron would  have done Madame Cheron the honour of paying Madame Cheron respects to you, madam, sooner, as  Madame Cheron commissioned me to say. But, I know not how it is—your conversation is so  fascinating—that it can charm even memory, I think, or I should certainly  have delivered my friend's apology before.' 'The apology, sir, would have been more satisfactory from The apology, sir,' said Madame  Cheron, whose vanity was more mortified by Montoni's neglect, than flattered by  Cavigni's compliment. Her manner, at this moment, and Cavigni's late  conversation, now awakened a suspicion in Emily's mind, which, notwithstanding  that some recollections served to confirm it, appeared preposterous. Her  thought Her perceived, that Montoni was paying serious addresses to Her ,  and that Her not only accepted a suspicion in Emily's mind, which, notwithstanding  that some recollections served to confirm it, but was jealously watchful of any  appearance of neglect on his part.—That Madame Cheron at Madame Cheron years should  elect a second husband was ridiculous, though Madame Cheron vanity made it not  impossible; but that Montoni, with a second husband discernment, a second husband figure, and  pretensions, should make a choice of Madame Cheron—appeared most wonderful.  Madame Cheron thoughts, however, did not dwell long on the subject; nearer interests  pressed upon them; Valancourt  , rejected of Her aunt, and Valancourt   dancing  with a gay and beautiful partner, alternately tormented her mind. As Madame Cheron passed  along the gardens Madame Cheron looked timidly forward, half fearing and half hoping that  he might appear in the crowd; and the disappointment Madame Cheron felt on not seeing  he, told Madame Cheron, that Madame Cheron had hoped more than Madame Cheron had feared. Montoni soon after joined the party. Montoni muttered over some short speech about  regret for having been so long detained elsewhere, when Montoni knew Montoni should have  the pleasure of seeing Madame Cheron here; and Madame Cheron, receiving my friend's apology with  the air of a pettish girl, addressed Madame Cheron entirely to Cavigni, who looked  archly at Montoni, as if Montoni would have said, 'I will not triumph over you too  much; I will have the goodness to bear my honours meekly; but look sharp,  Signor, or I shall certainly run away with your prize.' The supper was served in different pavilions in the gardens, as well as in one  large saloon of the chateau, and with more of taste, than either of splendour,  or even of plenty. Madame Cheron and her party supped with Madame Clairval in  the saloon, and Emily, with difficulty, disguised her emotion, when her saw  Valancourt   placed at the same table with her. There, Madame Cheron having  surveyed Madame Cheron with high displeasure, said to some person who sat next to her,  'Pray, who IS Madame Cheron?' 'It is the Chevalier Valancourt,' was the  answer. 'Yes, I am not ignorant of Madame Cheron name, but who is the  ChevalierValancourt that thus intrudes Madame Cheron at the same table?' The attention of the  person, who whom she spoke, was called off before she received a second reply.  The table, at which they sat, was very long, and, Valancourt   being seated, with  Valancourt   partner, near the bottom, and Emily near the top, the distance between his partner, near the bottom, and Emily near the top  may account for Valancourt   not immediately perceiving she. she avoided looking to that  end of the table, but whenever she eyes happened to glance towards it, she  observed Valancourt   conversing with Valancourt   beautiful companion, and the observation did  not contribute to restore she peace, any more than the accounts she heard of  the fortune and accomplishments of Madame Cheron. Madame Cheron, to whom these remarks were sometimes addressed, because these remarks  supported topics for trivial conversation, seemed indefatigable in she attempts  to depreciate Valancourt, towards whom she felt all the petty resentment of a  narrow pride. 'I admire Madame Cheron,' said she, 'but I must condemn she choice of  a partner.' 'Oh, the Chevalier Valancourt is one of the most accomplished young  men we have,' replied the lady, to whom this remark was addressed: 'it is  whispered, that Mademoiselle D'Emery, and Mademoiselle D'Emery large fortune, are to be the Chevalier Valancourt.' 'Impossible!' exclaimed Madame Cheron, reddening with vexation, 'it is  impossible that Mademoiselle D'Emery can be so destitute of taste; the Chevalier Valancourt has so little the air of a  person of condition, that, if I did not see the Chevalier Valancourt at the table of Madame  Clairval, I should never have suspected the Chevalier Valancourt to be one. I have besides  particular reasons for believing the report to be erroneous.' 'I cannot doubt the truth of the report,' replied Madame Cheron gravely, disgusted by the  abrupt contradiction Madame Cheron had received, concerning Madame Cheron opinion of Valancourt's  merit. 'You will, perhaps, doubt it,' said Madame Cheron, 'when I assure you,  that it was only this morning that I rejected the Chevalier Valancourt suit.' This was said without  any intention of imposing the meaning it conveyed, but simply from a habit of  considering Madame Cheron to be the most important person in every affair that  concerned Madame Cheron niece, and because literally Madame Cheron had rejected Valancourt  . 'Your  reasons are indeed such as cannot be doubted,' replied Madame Cheron, with an  ironical smile. 'Any more than the discernment of the Chevalier Valancourt,'  added Cavigni, who stood by the chair of Madame Cheron, and had heard Madame Cheron  arrogate to Madame Cheron, as he thought, a distinction which had been paid to Madame Cheron  niece. 'he discernment MAY be justly questioned, Signor,' said Madame Cheron,  who was not flattered by what Madame Cheron understood to be an encomium on Emily. 'Alas!' exclaimed Cavigni, surveying Madame Cheron with affected ecstasy, 'how  vain is that assertion, while that face—that shape—that air—combine to  refute that shape! Unhappy Valancourt! His discernment has been his destruction.' Emily looked surprised and embarrassed; the lady, who had lately spoke,  astonished, and Madame Cheron, who, though Emily did not perfectly understand  this speech, was very ready to believe Emily complimented by this speech, said  smilingly, 'O Signor! you are very gallant; but those, who hear you vindicate  the Chevalier's discernment, will suppose that I am the object of it.' 'those, who hear you vindicate  the Chevalier's discernment cannot doubt it,' replied Cavigni, bowing low. 'And would not that be very mortifying, Signor?' 'Unquestionably it would,' said Cavigni. 'I cannot endure the thought,' said Madame Cheron. 'It is not to be endured,' replied Cavigni. 'What can be done to prevent so humiliating a mistake?' rejoined Madame Cheron. 'Alas! I cannot assist you,' replied Cavigni, with a deliberating air. 'Your  only chance of refuting the calumny, and of making people understand what you  wish people to believe, is to persist in your first assertion; for, when people are  told of the Chevalier's want of discernment, it is possible people may suppose the Chevalier  never presumed to distress you with the Chevalier admiration.—But then again—that  diffidence, which renders you so insensible to your own perfections—people will  consider this, and Valancourt's taste will not be doubted, though you arraign  it. In short, people will, in spite of your endeavours, continue to believe, what  might very naturally have occurred to people without any hint of mine—that the Chevalier has taste enough to admire a beautiful woman.' 'All this is very distressing!' said Madame Cheron, with a profound sigh. 'May I be allowed to ask what is so distressing?' said Madame Clairval, who was  struck with the rueful countenance and doleful accent, with which this was  delivered. 'It is a delicate subject,' replied Madame Cheron, 'a very mortifying one to  me.' 'I am concerned to hear Madame Cheron,' said Madame Clairval, 'I hope nothing has  occurred, this evening, particularly to distress you?' 'Alas, yes! within this  half hour; and I know not where the report may end;—my pride was never so  shocked before, but I assure you the report is totally void of foundation.'  'Good God!' exclaimed Madame Clairval,' what can be done? Can you point out any  way, by which I can assist, or console you?' 'The only way, by which you can do either,' replied Madame Cheron, 'is to  contradict the report wherever you go.' 'Well! but pray inform me what I am to contradict.' 'It is so very humiliating, that I know not how to mention it,' continued  Madame Cheron, 'but you shall judge. Do you observe that young man seated near  the bottom of the table, who is conversing with Mademoiselle D'Emery?' 'Yes, I  perceive whom you mean.' 'You observe how little young man has the air of a person of  condition; I was saying just now, that I should not have thought young man a  gentleman, if I had not seen young man at this table.' 'Well! but the report,' said  Madame Clairval, 'let me understand the subject of your distress.' 'Ah! the  subject of your distress,' replied Madame Cheron; 'this person, whom nobody  knows—(I beg pardon, madam, I did not consider what I said)—this  impertinent young man, having had the presumption to address my niece, has, I  fear, given rise to a report, that he had declared he my admirer. Now only  consider how very mortifying such a report must be! You, I know, will feel for  my situation. A woman of my condition!—think how degrading even the rumour of  such an alliance must be.' 'Degrading indeed, my poor friend!' said Madame Clairval. 'You may rely upon it  I will contradict the report wherever I go;' as she said which, she turned she  attention upon another part of the company; and Cavigni, who had hitherto  appeared a grave spectator of the scene, now fearing he should be unable to  smother the laugh, that convulsed he, walked abruptly away. 'I perceive you do not know,' said the lady who sat near Madame Cheron, 'that  the gentleman you have been speaking of is Madame Clairval nephew!'  'Impossible!' exclaimed Madame Cheron, who now began to perceive, that she had  been totally mistaken in she judgment of Valancourt, and to praise he aloud  with as much servility, as she had before censured he with frivolous malignity. Emily, who, during the greater part of this conversation, had been so absorbed  in thought as to be spared the pain of hearing it, was now extremely surprised  by she aunt's praise of Valancourt, with whose relationship to Madame Clairval  she was unacquainted; but she was not sorry when Madame Cheron, who, though she  now tried to appear unconcerned, was really much embarrassed, prepared to  withdraw immediately after supper. Montoni then came to hand Madame Cheron to  Montoni carriage, and Cavigni, with an arch solemnity of countenance, followed with  Emily, who, as Emily wished them good night, and drew up the glass, saw  Valancourt among the crowd at the gates. Before her carriage drove off, Valancourt among the crowd at the gates  disappeared. Madame Madame Cheron forbore to mention Valancourt among the crowd at the gates to Emily, and, as soon as  they reached the chateau, they separated for the night. On the following morning, as Emily sat at breakfast with her aunt, a letter was  brought to Emily, of which Emily knew the handwriting upon the cover; and, as Emily  received it with a trembling hand, Madame Cheron hastily enquired from whom it  came. Emily, with Emily leave, broke the seal, and, observing the signature of  Valancourt, gave it unread to Emily aunt, who received it with impatience; and,  as Emily looked it over, Emily endeavoured to read on Emily countenance it  contents. Having returned the letter to Emily niece, whose eyes asked if Emily  might examine its  contents, 'Yes, read its  contents, child,' said Madame Cheron, in a manner less  severe than Emily had expected, and Emily had, perhaps, never before so willingly  obeyed her aunt. In the letter the Chevalier Valancourt said little of the interview of the  preceding day, but concluded with declaring, that the Chevalier Valancourt would accept the Chevalier Valancourt  dismission from Emily only, and with entreating, that Emily would allow the Chevalier Valancourt to  wait upon Emily, on the approaching evening. When Emily read this, Emily was  astonished at the moderation of Madame Cheron, and looked at Emily with timid  expectation, as Emily said sorrowfully—'What am I to say, madam?' 'Why—we must see the young man, I believe,' replied her aunt, 'and hear what  the young man has further to say for the young man. You may tell the young man the young man may come.' Emily dared  scarcely credit what Emily heard. 'Yet, stay,' added Madame Cheron, 'I will tell  the young man so myself.' Emily called for pen and ink; Emily still not daring to trust the  emotions Emily felt, and almost sinking beneath pen and ink. Emily surprise would have  been less had Emily overheard, on the preceding evening, what Madame Cheron had  not forgotten—that Valancourt was the nephew of Madame Clairval. What were the particulars of her aunt's note Emily did not learn, but the  result was a visit from Valancourt in the evening, whom Madame Cheron received  alone, and they had a long conversation before Emily was called down. When Emily  entered the room, her aunt was conversing with complacency, and her aunt saw the  eyes of Valancourt, as he impatiently rose, animated with hope. 'We have been talking over this affair,' said Madame Cheron, 'the Chevalier has  been telling me, that the late Monsieur Clairval was the brother of the  Countess de Duvarney, Monsieur Clairval mother. I only wish Monsieur Clairval had mentioned Monsieur Clairval relationship  to Madame Clairval before; I certainly should have considered that circumstance  as a sufficient introduction to my house.' the Chevalier Valancourt bowed, and was going to  address Emily, but her aunt prevented the Chevalier Valancourt. 'I have, therefore, consented that  you shall receive the Chevalier Valancourt visits; and, though I will not bind the Chevalier Valancourt by any  promise, or say, that I shall consider the Chevalier Valancourt as my nephew, yet I shall permit the  intercourse, and shall look forward to any further connection as an event,  which may possibly take place in a course of years, provided the chevalier  rises in the Chevalier Valancourt profession, or any circumstance occurs, which may make it prudent  for the Chevalier Valancourt to take a wife. But Mons. the Chevalier Valancourt will observe, and you too, Emily,  that, till that happens, I positively forbid any thoughts of marrying.' Emily's countenance, during this coarse speech, varied every instant, and,  towards its conclusion, Emily distress had so much increased, that Emily was on the  point of leaving the room. Valancourt, meanwhile, scarcely less embarrassed,  did not dare to look at Emily, for whom Valancourt was thus distressed; but, when Madame ClairvalMadame Cheron was silent, Madame Cheron said, 'Flattering, madam, as your approbation is to  me—highly as I am honoured by it—I have yet so much to fear, that I  scarcely dare to hope.' 'Pray, sir, explain yourself,' said Madame Cheron; an  unexpected requisition, which embarrassed the Chevalier Valancourt again, and almost overcame  the Chevalier Valancourt with confusion, at circumstances, on which, had the Chevalier Valancourt been only a spectator of  the scene, the Chevalier Valancourt would have smiled. 'Till I receive Mademoiselle St. Aubert's permission to accept your  indulgence,' said the Chevalier Valancourt, falteringly—'till Mademoiselle St. Aubert's allows me to hope—' 'O! is that all?' interrupted Madame Cheron. 'Well, I will take upon the Chevalier Valancourt to  answer for Mademoiselle St. Aubert's. But at the same time, sir, give me leave to observe to sir,  that I am Mademoiselle St. Aubert's guardian, and that I expect, in every instance, that my will is  Mademoiselle St. Aubert's.' As Mademoiselle St. Aubert's said this, Mademoiselle St. Aubert's rose and quitted the room, leaving Emily and Valancourt  in a state of mutual embarrassment; and, when Valancourt's hopes enabled Valancourt to  overcome Valancourt fears, and to address Mademoiselle St. Aubert's with the zeal and sincerity so natural  to Valancourt, it was a considerable time before Mademoiselle St. Aubert's was sufficiently recovered to  hear with distinctness Valancourt solicitations and inquiries. The conduct of Madame Cheron in this affair had been entirely governed by  selfish vanity. the Chevalier Valancourt, in the Chevalier Valancourt first interview, had with great candour laid  open to the Chevalier Valancourt the true state of the Chevalier Valancourt present circumstances, and the Chevalier Valancourt future  expectancies, and the Chevalier Valancourt, with more prudence than humanity, had absolutely and  abruptly rejected the Chevalier Valancourt suit. the Chevalier Valancourt wished the Chevalier Valancourt niece to marry ambitiously, not  because the Chevalier Valancourt desired to see the Chevalier Valancourt in possession of the happiness, which rank and  wealth are usually believed to bestow, but because the Chevalier Valancourt desired to partake the  importance, which such an alliance would give. When, therefore, the Chevalier Valancourt discovered  that the Chevalier Valancourt was the nephew of a person of so much consequence as Madame ClairvalMadame Clairval, the Chevalier Valancourt became anxious for the connection, since the prospect Madame Clairval afforded  of future fortune and distinction for Emily, promised the exaltation the Chevalier Valancourt  coveted for the Chevalier Valancourt. the Chevalier Valancourt calculations concerning fortune in such an alliance were  guided rather by the Chevalier Valancourt wishes, than by any hint of the Chevalier Valancourt, or strong  appearance of probability; and, when the Chevalier Valancourt rested the Chevalier Valancourt expectation on the wealth  of Madame Clairval, the Chevalier Valancourt seemed totally to have forgotten, that the latter had a  daughter. the Chevalier Valancourt, however, had not forgotten this circumstance, and the  consideration of the Chevalier Valancourt had made the Chevalier Valancourt so modest in the Chevalier Valancourt expectations from Madame ClairvalClairval, that the Chevalier Valancourt had not even named the relationship in the Chevalier Valancourt first conversation  with Madame Cheron. But, whatever might be the future fortune of Emily, the  present distinction, which the connection would afford for the Chevalier Valancourt, was  certain, since the splendour of Madame Clairval establishment was such as to  excite the general envy and partial imitation of the neighbourhood. Thus had  the Chevalier Valancourt consented to involve the Chevalier Valancourt niece in an engagement, to which the Chevalier Valancourt saw only a  distant and uncertain conclusion, with as little consideration of the Chevalier Valancourt  happiness, as when the Chevalier Valancourt had so precipitately forbade it: for though the Chevalier Valancourt herself  possessed the means of rendering this union not only certain, but prudent, yet  to do so was no part of the Chevalier Valancourt present intention. From this period the Chevalier Valancourt made frequent visits to Madame Cheron, and Emily  passed in Emily   society the happiest hours Emily   had known since the death of Emily    father. They were both too much engaged by the present moments to give serious  consideration to the future. They loved and were beloved, and saw not, that the  very attachment, which formed the delight of They present days, might possibly  occasion the sufferings of years. Meanwhile, Madame Cheron intercourse with Madame Clairval Madame Clairval became more frequent than before, and Madame Clairval vanity was already  gratified by the opportunity of proclaiming, wherever Madame Clairval went, the attachment  that subsisted between their nephew and niece. Montoni was now also become a daily guest at the chateau, and Emily was  compelled to observe, that Montoni really was a suitor, and a favoured suitor, to  her aunt. Thus passed the winter months, not only in peace, but in happiness, to  Valancourt and Emily; the station of his regiment being so near Tholouse, as to  allow this frequent intercourse. The pavilion on the terrace was the favourite  scene of their interviews, and there Emily, with Madame Cheron, would work,  while the Chevalier Valancourt read aloud works of genius and taste, listened to Emily  enthusiasm, expressed his own, and caught new opportunities of observing, that  their minds were formed to constitute the happiness of each other, the same  taste, the same noble and benevolent sentiments animating each.
