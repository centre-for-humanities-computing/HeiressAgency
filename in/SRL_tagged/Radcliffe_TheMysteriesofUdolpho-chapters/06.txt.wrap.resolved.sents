      While in the rosy vale  Love breath'd        infant sighs, from anguish free.
Thomson St. Aubert, sufficiently restored by a night's repose to pursue        journey,  set out in the morning, with        family and Valancourt, for Rousillon, which         hoped to reach before night-fall.
The scenes, through which they now passed,  were as wild and romantic, as any they had yet observed, with this difference,  that beauty, every now and then, softened the landscape into smiles.
Little  woody recesses appeared among the mountains, covered with bright verdure and  flowers; or a pastoral valley opened a pastoral valley grassy bosom in the shade of the  cliffs, with flocks and herds loitering along the banks of a rivulet, that  refreshed that   with perpetual green.
Thomson St. Aubert could not repent the having taken  this fatiguing road, though Thomson St. Aubert was this day, also, frequently obliged to  alight, to walk along the rugged precipice, and to climb the steep and flinty  mountain.
The wonderful sublimity and variety of the prospects repaid Thomson St. Aubert for  all this, and the enthusiasm, with which The wonderful sublimity and variety of the prospects were viewed by Thomson St. Aubert young  companions, heightened Thomson St. Aubert own, and awakened a remembrance of all the  delightful emotions of Thomson St. Aubert early days, when the sublime charms of nature were  first unveiled to Thomson St. Aubert.
Thomson St. Aubert found great pleasure in conversing with Valancourt,  and in listening to Thomson St. Aubert ingenuous remarks.
The fire and simplicity of Thomson St. Aubert  manners seemed to render Thomson St. Aubert a characteristic figure in the scenes around them;  and Thomson St. Aubert discovered in Thomson St. Aubert sentiments the justness and the dignity of an  elevated mind, unbiased by intercourse with the world.
Thomson St. Aubert perceived, that Thomson St. Aubert  opinions were formed, rather than imbibed; were more the result of thought,  than of learning.
Of the world Thomson St. Aubert seemed to know nothing; for Thomson St. Aubert believed well  of all mankind, and this opinion gave Thomson St. Aubert the reflected image of Thomson St. Aubert own heart.
Thomson St. Aubert, as Thomson St. Aubert sometimes lingered to examine the wild plants in Thomson St. Aubert path,  often looked forward with pleasure to Emily and Valancourt, as they strolled on  together; Thomson St. Aubert, with a countenance of animated delight, pointing to Emily attention  some grand feature of the scene; and Emily, listening and observing with a look  of tender seriousness, that spoke the elevation of Emily mind.
they appeared like  two lovers who had never strayed beyond these they native mountains; whose  situation had secluded they from the frivolities of common life, whose ideas  were simple and grand, like the landscapes among which they moved, and who knew  no other happiness, than in the union of pure and affectionate hearts.
St.  Thomson St. Aubert smiled, and sighed at the romantic picture of felicity Thomson St. Aubert fancy drew;  and sighed again to think, that nature and simplicity were so little known to  the world, as that their pleasures were thought romantic.
'the world,' said Thomson St. Aubert, pursuing this train of thought, 'ridicules a passion  which it seldom feels; it scenes, and it interests, distract the mind,  deprave the taste, corrupt the heart, and love cannot exist in a heart that has  lost the meek dignity of innocence.
Virtue and taste are nearly the same, for  virtue is little more than active taste, and the most delicate affections of  each combine in real love.
How then are we to look for love in great cities,  where selfishness, dissipation, and insincerity supply the place of tenderness,  simplicity and truth?'
It was near noon, when the travellers, having arrived at a piece of steep and  dangerous road, alighted to walk.
dangerous road wound up an ascent, that was clothed  with wood, and, instead of following the carriage, they entered the refreshing  shade.
A dewy coolness was diffused upon the air, which, with the bright  verdure of turf, that grew under the trees, the mingled fragrance of flowers  and of balm, thyme, and lavender, that enriched it, and the grandeur of the  pines, beech, and chestnuts, that overshadowed they, rendered this a most  delicious retreat.
Sometimes, the thick foliage excluded all view of the  country; at others, it admitted some partial catches of the distant scenery,  which gave hints to the imagination to picture landscapes more interesting,  more impressive, than any that had been presented to the eye.
The wanderers  often lingered to indulge in these reveries of fancy.
The pauses of silence, such as had formerly interrupted the conversations of  Valancourt and Emily, were more frequent today than ever.
Valancourt often  dropped suddenly from the most animating vivacity into fits of deep musing, and  there was, sometimes, an unaffected melancholy in Valancourt smile, which Emily could  not avoid understanding, for Emily heart was interested in the sentiment it spoke.
St. Aubert was refreshed by the shades, and St. Aubert continued to saunter under  the shades, following, as nearly as St. Aubert could guess, the direction of the road, till  St. Aubert perceived that St. Aubert had totally lost it.
St. Aubert had continued near the brow  of the precipice, allured by the scenery it exhibited, while the road wound far  away over the cliff above.
Valancourt called loudly to Michael, but heard no  voice, except Michael own, echoing among the rocks, and Michael various efforts to  regain the road were equally unsuccessful.
While they were thus circumstanced,  they perceived a shepherd's cabin, between the boles of the trees at some  distance, and Valancourt bounded on first to ask assistance.
When Michael reached  it, Michael saw only two little children, at play, on the turf before the door.
Michael  looked into the hut, but no person was there, and the eldest of the boys told  no person that the boys father was with no person flocks, and the boys mother was gone down into  the vale, but would be back presently.
As no person stood, considering what was  further to be done, on a sudden no person heard Michael's voice roaring forth most  manfully among the cliffs above, till no person made the boys echoes ring.
Valancourt  immediately answered the call, and endeavoured to make Valancourt   way through the  thicket that clothed the steeps, following the direction of the sound.
After  much struggle over brambles and precipices, Valancourt   reached Michael, and at length  prevailed with Michael to be silent, and to listen to Michael.
The road was at a  considerable distance from the spot where St. Aubert and Emily were; the  carriage could not easily return to the entrance of the wood, and, since the  carriage  would be very fatiguing for St. Aubert to climb the long and steep road to the  place where the  carriage now stood, Valancourt   was anxious to find a more easy ascent, by  the way Valancourt   had Valancourt   passed.
Meanwhile St. Aubert and Emily approached the cottage, and rested St. Aubert and Emily on  a rustic bench, fastened between two pines, which overshadowed it, till  Valancourt, whose steps St. Aubert and Emily had observed, should return.
The eldest of the children desisted from Valancourt   play, and stood still to observe  the strangers, while the younger continued Valancourt   little gambols, and teased Valancourt    brother to join in the children.
St. Aubert St. Aubert looked with pleasure upon this picture of  infantine simplicity, till it brought to St. Aubert remembrance St. Aubert own boys, whom St. Aubert  had lost about the age of these, and these lamented mother; and St. Aubert sunk into a  thoughtfulness, which Emily observing, Emily immediately began to sing one of  those simple and lively airs St. Aubert was so fond of, and which Emily knew how to give  with the most captivating sweetness.
St. Aubert St. Aubert smiled on St. Aubert through St. Auberttears, took Emily hand and pressed her hand affectionately, and then tried to dissipate  the melancholy reflections that lingered in St. Aubert mind.
While Emily sung, Valancourt approached, who was unwilling to interrupt Emily, and  paused at a little distance to listen.
When Emily had concluded, St. Aubert joined the  party, and told the  party, that St. Aubert had found Michael, as well as a way, by which St. Aubert  thought the  party could ascend the cliff to the carriage.
St. Aubert pointed to the woody  steeps above, which St. Aubert surveyed with an anxious eye.
St. Aubert was already  wearied by St. Aubert walk, and this ascent was formidable to St. Aubert.
St. Aubert thought,  however, it would be less toilsome than the long and broken road, and St. Aubert  determined to attempt it; but Emily, ever watchful of St. Aubert ease, proposing that  St. Aubert should rest, and dine before dine proceeded further, Valancourt went to the  carriage for the refreshments deposited there.
On St. Aubert return, St. Aubert proposed removing a little higher up the mountain, to where  the woods opened upon a grand and extensive prospect; and thither dine were  preparing to go, when dine saw a young woman join the children, and caress and  weep over the children.
The travellers, interested by a young woman distress, stopped to observe a young woman.
a young woman took  the youngest of the children in a young woman arms, and, perceiving the strangers,  hastily dried a young woman , and proceeded to the cottage.
St. Aubert, on enquiring  the occasion of a young woman sorrow, learned that a young woman husband, who was a shepherd, and  lived here in the summer months to watch over the flocks he led to feed upon  these mountains, had lost, on the preceding night, he little all.
A gang of  gipsies, who had for some time infested the neighbourhood, had driven away  several of he master's sheep.
'Jacques,' added the shepherd's wife, 'had saved  a little money, and had bought a few sheep with a few sheep, and now they must go to he  master for those that are stolen; and what is worse than all, his master, when  he comes to know how it is, will trust he no longer with the care of he  flocks, for he is a hard man!
and then what is to become of our children!'
The innocent countenance of the woman, and the simplicity of the woman manner in  relating the woman grievance, inclined Thomson St. Aubert to believe the woman story; and  Valancourt, convinced that it was true, asked eagerly what was the value of a few sheep; on hearing which he turned away with a look of disappointment.
Thomson St. Aubert put some money into her hand, Emily too gave something from Emily  little purse, and they walked towards the cliff; but Valancourt   lingered  behind, and spoke to the shepherd's wife, who was now weeping with gratitude  and surprise.
Thomson St. Aubert enquired how much money was yet wanting to replace a few sheep, and found, that how much money was a sum very little short of all Thomson St. Aubert had about Thomson St. Aubert.
Thomson St. Aubert was perplexed and distressed.
'a sum then,' said Thomson St. Aubert to Thomson St. Aubert, 'would  make this poor family completely happy—it is in my power to give it—to make  this poor family completely happy!
But what is to become of me?—how shall I contrive to  reach home with the little money that will remain?'
For a moment Thomson St. Aubert stood,  unwilling to forego the luxury of raising a family from ruin to happiness, yet  considering the difficulties of pursuing Thomson St. Aubert journey with so small a sum as  would be left.
While Thomson St. Aubert was in this state of perplexity, the shepherd himself appeared: Thomson St. Aubert  children ran to meet Thomson St. Aubert; Thomson St. Aubert took one of his  children in Thomson St. Aubert arms, and, with the other  clinging to Thomson St. Aubert coat, came forward with a loitering step.
Thomson St. Aubert forlorn and  melancholy look determined Valancourt at once; Thomson St. Aubert threw down all the money Thomson St. Aubert  had, except a very few louis, and bounded away after St. Aubert and Emily, who  were proceeding slowly up the steep.
Valancourt had seldom felt Thomson St. Aubert heart so  light as at this moment; Valancourt gay spirits danced with pleasure; every object  around Valancourt appeared more interesting, or beautiful, than before.
Thomson St. Aubertobserved the uncommon vivacity of Valancourt countenance: 'What has pleased you so  much?'
said Valancourt.
'O what a lovely day,' replied Valancourt, 'how brightly the  sun shines, how pure is this air, what enchanting scenery!'
'It is indeed  enchanting,' said St. Aubert, whom early experience had taught to understand  the nature of Valancourt's present feelings.
'What pity that the wealthy, who  can command such sunshine, should ever pass St. Aubert, whom early experience had taught to understand  the nature of Valancourt's present feelings days in gloom—in the cold  shade of selfishness!
For my young friend, my young friend, may the  sun always shine as  brightly as at this moment; may your own conduct always give you the sunshine  of benevolence and reason united!'
Valancourt, highly flattered by this compliment, could make no reply but by a  smile of gratitude.
They continued to wind under the woods, between the grassy knolls of the  mountain, and, as They reached the shady summit, which he had pointed out, the  party burst into an exclamation.
Behind the spot where the  party stood, the  rock rose perpendicularly in a massy wall to a considerable height, and then  branched out into overhanging crags.
Their grey tints were well contrasted by  the bright hues of the plants and wild flowers, that grew in Their fractured  sides, and were deepened by the gloom of the pines and cedars, that waved  above.
The steeps below, over which an anxious eye passed abruptly to the valley, were  fringed with thickets of alpine shrubs; and, lower still, appeared the tufted  tops of the chesnut woods, that clothed the tufted  tops of the chesnut woods base, among which peeped forth  the shepherd's cottage, just left by the travellers, with the shepherd blueish smoke  curling high in the air.
On every side appeared the majestic summits of the  Pyrenees, some exhibiting tremendous crags of marble, whose appearance was  changing every instant, as the varying lights fell upon the varying lights surface; others,  still higher, displaying only snowy points, while others,  still higher, displaying only snowy points lower steeps were  covered almost invariably with forests of pine, larch, and oak, that stretched  down to the vale.
This was one of the narrow vallies, that open from the  Pyrenees into the country of Rousillon, and whose green pastures, and  cultivated beauty, form a decided and wonderful contrast to the romantic  grandeur that environs it.
Through a vista of the mountains appeared the  lowlands of Rousillon, tinted with the blue haze of distance, as they united  with the waters of the Mediterranean; where, on a promontory, which marked the  boundary of the shore, stood a lonely beacon, over which were seen circling  flights of sea-fowl.
Beyond, appeared, now and then, a stealing sail, white  with the sun-beam, and whose progress was perceivable by its approach to the  light-house.
Sometimes, too, was seen a sail so distant, that its served only to  mark the line of separation between the sky and the waves.
On the other side of the valley, immediately opposite to the spot where the  travellers rested, a rocky pass opened toward Gascony.
Here no sign of  cultivation appeared.
The rocks of granite, that screened the glen, rose  abruptly from their base, and stretched their barren points to the clouds,  unvaried with woods, and uncheered even by a hunter's cabin.
Sometimes, indeed,  a gigantic larch threw a gigantic larch long shade over the precipice, and here and there a  cliff reared on a gigantic larch brow a monumental cross, to tell the traveller the fate of  him who had ventured thither before.
the spot where the  travellers rested seemed the very haunt of  banditti; and Emily, as Emily looked down upon it, almost expected to see them  stealing out from some hollow cave to look for them prey.
Soon after an object  not less terrific struck her,—a gibbet standing on a point of rock near the  entrance of a rocky pass, and immediately over one of the crosses Emily had before  observed.
These were hieroglyphics that told a plain and dreadful story.
Emily  forbore to point it out to St. Aubert, but it threw a gloom over Emily spirits,  and made Emily anxious to hasten forward, that they might with certainty reach  Rousillon before night-fall.
It was necessary, however, that St. Aubert should  take some refreshment, and, seating they on the short dry turf, they  opened the basket of provisions, while      by breezy murmurs cool'd,  Broad o'er THEIR heads the verdant cedars wave,  And high palmetos lift their graceful shade.
——-THEY draw  Ethereal soul, there drink reviving gales  Profusely breathing from the piney groves,  And vales of fragrance; there at a distance hear  The roaring floods, and cataracts.
*      *St. Aubert was revived by rest, and by the serene air of this summit; and  Valancourt was so charmed with all around, and with the conversation of Valancourtcompanions, that St. Aubert seemed to have forgotten St. Aubert had any further to go.
Having  concluded the conversation of his  companions, that he seemed to have forgotten he had any further to go simple repast, the conversation of his  companions, that he seemed to have forgotten he had any further to go gave a long farewell look to the scene, and  again began to ascend.
Thomson St. Aubert St. Aubert rejoiced when Thomson St. Aubert reached the carriage, which  Emily entered with Thomson St. Aubert; but Valancourt, willing to take a more extensive view  of the enchanting country, into which they were about to descend, than Thomson St. Aubert could  do from a carriage, loosened Thomson St. Aubert dogs, and once more bounded with his dogs along  the banks of the road.
Thomson St. Aubert often quitted it for points that promised a wider  prospect, and the slow pace, at which the mules travelled, allowed Thomson St. Aubert to  overtake the mules with ease.
Whenever a scene of uncommon magnificence appeared, Thomson St. Aubert  hastened to inform St. Aubert, who, though Thomson St. Aubert was too much tired to walk  Thomson St. Aubert, sometimes made the chaise wait, while Emily went to the neighbouring  cliff.
It was evening when they descended the lower alps, that bind Rousillon, and  form a majestic barrier round that charming country, leaving Rousillon open only on  the east to the Mediterranean.
The gay tints of cultivation once more  beautified the landscape; for the lowlands were coloured with the richest hues,  which a luxuriant climate, and an industrious people can awaken into life.
Groves of orange and lemon perfumed the air, Groves of orange and lemon ripe fruit glowing among the  foliage; while, sloping to the plains, extensive vineyards spread Groves of orange and lemon  treasures.
Beyond these, woods and pastures, and mingled towns and hamlets  stretched towards the sea, on whose bright surface gleamed many a distant sail;  while, over the whole scene, was diffused the purple glow of evening.
This  landscape with the surrounding alps did, indeed, present a perfect picture of  the lovely and the sublime, of 'beauty sleeping in the lap of horror.'
The travellers, having reached the plains, proceeded, between hedges of  flowering myrtle and pomegranate, to the town of Arles, where they proposed to  rest for the night.
they met with simple, but neat accommodation, and would  have passed a happy evening, after the toils and the delights of this day, had  not the approaching separation thrown a gloom over they spirit.
It was St.  St. Aubert's plan to proceed, on the morrow, to the borders of the Mediterranean,  and travel along its shores into Languedoc; and Valancourt, since St. Aubert was now  nearly recovered, and had no longer a pretence for continuing with St. Aubert new  friends, resolved to leave his new  friends here.
St. Aubert, who was much pleased with  St. Aubert, invited St. Aubert to go further, but did not repeat the invitation, and  Valancourt had resolution enough to forego the temptation of accepting it, that  Valancourt might prove Valancourt not unworthy of the favour.
On the following morning,  therefore, they were to part, St. Aubert St. Aubert to pursue St. Aubert way to Languedoc, and  Valancourt to explore new scenes among the mountains, on St. Aubert return home.
During this evening St. Aubert was often silent and thoughtful; St. Aubert's manner  towards St. Aubert was affectionate, though grave, and Emily was serious, though Emily  made frequent efforts to appear cheerful.
After one of the most melancholy  evenings they had yet passed together, they separated for the night.
