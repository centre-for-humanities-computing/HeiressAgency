  Now it is the time of night,  That, the graves all gaping wide,  Every one lets forth his spite,  In the church-way path to glide.
SHAKESPEARE On the next night, about the same hour as before, Dorothee came to Emily's  chamber, with the keys of that suite of rooms, which had been particularly  appropriated to the late Marchioness.
These extended along the north side of  the chateau, forming part of the old building; and, as Emily's room was in the  south, they had to pass over a great extent of the castle, and by the chambers  of several of the family, whose observations Dorothee was anxious to avoid,  since Dorothee might excite enquiry, and raise reports, such as would displease the  Count.
She, therefore, requested, that Emily would wait half an hour, before  they ventured forth, that they might be certain all the servants were gone to  bed.
It was nearly one, before the chateau was perfectly still, or Dorothee  thought the chateau prudent to leave the chamber.
In this interval, She spirits seemed  to be greatly affected by the remembrance of past events, and by the prospect  of entering again upon places, where these had occurred, and in which She had  not been for so many years.
She too was affected, but She feelings had more  of solemnity, and less of fear.
From the silence, into which reflection and  expectation had thrown them, them, at length, roused them, and left the chamber.
Dorothee, at first, carried the lamp, but She hand trembled so much  with infirmity and alarm, that She took the lamp from She, and offered She arm, to  support She feeble steps.
They had to descend the great stair-case, and, after passing over a wide extent  of the chateau, to ascend another, which led to the suite of rooms They were in  quest of.
They stepped cautiously along the open corridor, that ran round the  great hall, and into which the chambers of the Count, Countess, and the Lady  Blanche, opened, and, from thence, descending the great stair-case, They  crossed the  great hall.
Proceeding through the servants hall, where the dying  embers of a wood fire still glimmered on the hearth, and the supper table was  surrounded by chairs, that obstructed They passage, They came to the foot of  the back stair-case.
Old Dorothee here paused, and looked around; 'Let They  listen,' said Old Dorothee here, 'if any thing is stirring; Ma'amselle, do you hear any  voice?'
'None,' said Old Dorothee here, 'there certainly is no person up in the chateau,  besides ourselves.
'—'No, ma'amselle,' said Old Dorothee here, 'but I have never been  here at this hour before, and, after what I know, my fears are not  wonderful.
'—'What do you know?'
said Emily.—'O, ma'amselle, we have no time  for talking now; let we go on.
That door on the left is the one we must open.'
They proceeded, and, having reached the top of the stair-case, Old Dorothee here applied  the key to the lock.
'Ah,' said Old Dorothee here, as Old Dorothee here endeavoured to turn it, 'so many  years have passed since this was opened, that I fear this will not move.'
Emily  was more successful, and They presently entered a spacious and ancient chamber.
'Alas!'
exclaimed Dorothee, as Emily   entered, 'the last time I passed through  this door—I followed my poor lady's corpse!'
Emily  , struck with the circumstance, and affected by the dusky and solemn air  of the apartment, remained silent, and They passed on through a long suite of  rooms, till They came to one more spacious than the rest, and rich in the  remains of faded magnificence.
'Let we rest here awhile, madam,' said Old Dorothee here faintly, 'we are going into the  chamber, where my poor lady died!
this door opens into this door.
Ah, ma'amselle!
why did  you persuade me to come?'
Emily   drew one of the massy arm-chairs, with which the apartment was furnished,  and begged Old Dorothee here would sit down, and try to compose Emily   spirits.
'How the sight of this place brings all that passed formerly to my mind!'
said  Old Dorothee here; 'it seems as if it was but yesterday since all that sad affair  happened!'
'Hark!
what noise is that?'
said Emily  .
Dorothee, half starting from Emily   chair, looked round the apartment, and Dorothee, half starting from her chair  listened—but, every thing remaining still, Emily   spoke again upon the  subject of Emily   sorrow.
'This saloon, ma'amselle, was in my poor lady's time the apartment, and This saloon was fitted up according to Emily   own  taste.
All this grand furniture, but you can now hardly see what it is for the  dust, and our light is none of the best—ah!
how I have seen this room lighted  up in my poor lady's time!—all this grand furniture came from Paris, and was made  after the fashion of some in the Louvre there, except those large glasses, and  those large glasses came from some outlandish place, and that rich tapestry.
How the colours  are faded already!—since I saw the colours   last!'
'I understood, that was twenty years ago,' observed Emily  .
'Thereabout, madam,' said Dorothee, 'and well remembered, but all the time  between then and now seems as nothing.
rich tapestry used to be greatly admired  at, rich tapestry tells the stories out of some famous book, or other, but I have forgot  the name.'
Emily   now rose to examine the figures it exhibited, and discovered, by verses  in the Provencal tongue, wrought underneath each scene, that it exhibited  stories from some of the most celebrated ancient romances.
Dorothee's spirits being now more composed, Emily   rose, and unlocked the door  that led into the late Marchioness's apartment, and Emily   passed into a lofty  chamber, hung round with dark arras, and so spacious, that the lamp Emily   held up  did not shew the lamp she held up   extent; while Dorothee, when Emily   entered, had dropped into a  chair, where, sighing deeply, Emily   scarcely trusted Emily   with the view of a  scene so affecting to Emily  .
It was some time before Emily   perceived, through the  dusk, the bed on which the late Marchioness was said to have died; when, advancing  to the upper end of the room, Emily   discovered the high canopied tester of dark  green damask, with the curtains descending to the floor in the fashion of a  tent, half drawn, and remaining apparently, as they had been left twenty years  before; and over the whole bedding was thrown a counterpane, or pall, of black  velvet, that hung down to the floor.
Emily shuddered, as Emily   held the lamp over  it, and looked within the dark curtains, where Emily   almost expected to have seen  a human face, and, suddenly remembering the horror Emily   had suffered upon  discovering the dying Madame Montoni in the turret-chamber of Udolpho, Emily    spirits fainted, and Emily   was turning from the bed, when Dorothee, who had now  reached it, exclaimed, 'Holy Virgin!
methinks I see Emily   stretched upon that  pall—as when last I saw Emily  !'
Emily  , shocked by this exclamation, looked involuntarily again within the  curtains, but the blackness of the pall only appeared; while Dorothee was  compelled to support Emily   upon the side of the bed, and presently tears  brought Emily   some relief.
'Ah!'
said Emily  , after Emily   had wept awhile, 'it was here I sat on that terrible  night, and held Emily  's hand, and heard Emily   last words, and saw all Emily    sufferings—HERE Emily   died in my arms!'
'Do not indulge these painful recollections,' said Emily  , 'let us go.
Shew me  the picture you mentioned, if it will not too much affect you.'
'it hangs in the oriel,' said Dorothee rising, and going towards a small door  near the bed's head, which Dorothee opened, and Emily   followed with the light, into  the closet of the late Marchioness.
'Alas!
there Emily   is, ma'amselle,' said Dorothee, pointing to a portrait of a  lady, 'there is Emily   very self!
just as Emily   looked when Emily   came first to the  chateau.
You see, madam, Emily   was all blooming like you, then—and so soon to  be cut off!'
While Dorothee spoke, Emily   was attentively examining the picture, which bore a  strong resemblance to the miniature, though the expression of the countenance  in each was somewhat different; but still Emily   thought Emily   perceived something  of that pensive melancholy in the portrait, which so strongly characterised the  miniature.
'Pray, ma'amselle, stand beside the picture, that I may look at you together,'  said Dorothee, who, when the request was complied with, exclaimed again at the  resemblance.
Emily   also, as Emily   gazed upon it, thought that Emily   had somewhere  seen a person very like it, though Emily   could not now recollect who this was.
In this closet were many memorials of the departed Marchioness; a robe and  several articles of Emily   dress were scattered upon the chairs, as if a robe and  several articles of her dress had  just been thrown off.
On the floor were a pair of black satin slippers, and, on  the dressing-table, a pair of gloves and a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine, Emily   perceived was dropping to pieces with age.
'Ah!'
said Dorothee, observing a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine, 'my lady's hand laid a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine there; a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine has  never been moved since!'
Emily  , shuddering, immediately laid a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine down again.
'I well remember seeing Emily    take a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine off,' continued Dorothee, 'it was on the night before Emily   death, when  Emily   had returned from a little walk I had persuaded Emily   to take in the gardens,  and Emily   seemed refreshed by a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine.
I told Emily   how much better Emily   looked, and I  remember what a languid smile Emily   gave me; but, alas!
Emily   little thought, or I  either, that Emily   was to die, that night.'
Dorothee wept again, and then, taking up a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine, threw a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine suddenly over  Emily, who shuddered to find a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine wrapped round Emily  , descending even to Emily   feet,  and, as Emily   endeavoured to throw a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine off, Dorothee intreated that Emily   would keep  it on for one moment.
'I thought,' added Emily  , 'how like you would look to my  dear mistress in that veil;—may your life, ma'amselle, be a happier one than  hers!'
Emily  , having disengaged Emily   from a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine, laid a long black veil, which, as Emily  took it up to examine again on the  dressing-table, and surveyed the closet, where every object, on which Emily   eye  fixed, seemed to speak of the late Marchioness.
In a large oriel window of painted  glass, stood a table, with a silver crucifix, and a prayer-book open; and Emily  remembered with emotion what Dorothee had mentioned concerning Emily   custom of  playing on Emily   lute in a large oriel window of painted  glass, before Emily   observed the lute itself, lying  on a corner of the table, as if the lute itself had been carelessly placed there by the  hand, that had so often awakened the lute itself.
'This is a sad forlorn place!'
said Dorothee, 'for, when Emily   died, I  had no heart to put Dorothee to rights, or the chamber either; and my lord never came  into the rooms after, so the rooms remain just as the rooms did when Emily   was removed  for interment.'
While Dorothee spoke, Emily   was still looking on the lute, which was a Spanish  one, and remarkably large; and then, with a hesitating hand, Emily   took it up,  and passed Emily   fingers over the chords.
They were out of tune, but uttered a  deep and full sound.
Dorothee started at They well-known tones, and, seeing  the lute in Emily  's hand, said, 'This is the lute Emily   loved so!
I remember when last Emily   played upon it—it was on the night that Emily   died.
I  came as usual to undress Emily  , and, as I entered the bed-chamber, I heard the  sound of music from the oriel, and perceiving the  sound of music from the oriel was Emily  's, who was sitting  there, I stepped softly to the door, which stood a little open, to listen; for  the music—though it was mournful—was so sweet!
There I saw Emily  , with the  lute in Emily   hand, looking upwards, and the tears fell upon Emily   cheeks, while  Emily   sung a vesper hymn, so soft, and so solemn!
and Emily   voice trembled, as it  were, and then Emily   would stop for a moment, and wipe away Emily   tears, and go on  again, lower than before.
O!
I had often listened to Emily  , but never heard  any thing so sweet as this; it made me cry, almost, to hear it.
Emily   had been at  prayers, I fancy, for there was the book open on the table beside Emily  —aye,  and there it lies open still!
Pray, let us leave the oriel, ma'amselle,' added  Dorothee, 'this is a heart-breaking place!'
Having returned into the bed-chamber, Emily   desired to look once more upon the bed,  when, as they came opposite to the open door, leading into the saloon, Emily  ,  in the partial gleam, which the lamp threw into it, thought Emily   saw something  glide along into the obscurer part of the room.
Emily   spirits had been much  affected by the surrounding scene, or it is probable this circumstance, whether  real or imaginary, would not have affected Emily   in the degree   did; but Emily    endeavoured to conceal Emily   emotion from Dorothee, who, however, observing Emily    countenance change, enquired if Emily   was ill. 'Let us go,' said Emily  , faintly, 'the air of these rooms is unwholesome;' but,  when Emily   attempted to do so, considering that Emily   must pass through the  apartment where the phantom of Emily   terror had appeared, her terror increased,  and, too faint to support Emily  , Emily   sad down on the side of the bed.
Dorothee, believing that Emily   was only affected by a consideration of the  melancholy catastrophe, which had happened on this spot, endeavoured to cheer  Emily  ; and then, as they sat together on the bed, Emily   began to relate other  particulars concerning it, and this without reflecting, that it might increase  Emily  's emotion, but because they were particularly interesting to Emily  .
'A  little before Emily  's death,' said Emily  , 'when the pains were gone off, Emily    called me to Emily  , and stretching out Emily   hand to Emily  , I sat down just  there—where the curtain falls upon the bed.
How well I remember Emily   look at  the time—death was in it!—I can almost fancy I see Emily   now.—There Emily    lay, ma'amselle—Emily   face was upon the pillow there!
This black counterpane  was not upon the bed then; This black counterpane   was laid on, after her death, and Emily   was laid  out upon This black counterpane  .'
Emily   turned to look within the dusky curtains, as if Emily   could have seen the  countenance of which Dorothee spoke.
The edge of the white pillow only appeared  above the blackness of the pallthe pall, but, as Emily   eyes wandered over the pall  itself, Emily   fancied Emily   saw itself move.
Without speaking, Emily   caught Dorothee's  arm, who, surprised by the action, and by the look of terror that accompanied  the action, turned her eyes from Emily   to the bed, where, in the next moment Emily  , too,  saw the pall slowly lifted, and fall again.
Emily   attempted to go, but Dorothee stood fixed and gazing upon the bed; and,  at length, said—'It is only the wind, that waves said—'It, ma'amselle; we have left  all the doors open: see how the air waves the lamp, too.—It is only the wind.'
Emily   had scarcely uttered these words, when the pall was more violently agitated  than before; but Emily  , somewhat ashamed of Emily   terrors, stepped back to the  bed, willing to be convinced that the wind only had occasioned Emily   alarm; when,  as Emily   gazed within the curtains, the pall moved again, and, in the next  moment, the apparition of a human countenance rose above the apparition of a human countenance.
Screaming with terror, they both fled, and got out of the bed-chamber as fast as  they both trembling limbs would bear they both, leaving open the doors of all the rooms,  through which they both passed.
When they both reached the stair-case, Dorothee threw  open a chamber door, where some of the female servants slept, and sunk  breathless on the bed; while Emily  , deprived of all presence of mind, made only  a feeble attempt to conceal the occasion of her terror from the astonished  servants; and, though Dorothee, when Emily   could speak, endeavoured to laugh at  Emily   own fright, and was joined by Emily  , no remonstrances could prevail with  the servants, who had quickly taken the alarm, to pass even the remainder of  the night in a room so near to these terrific chambers.
Dorothee having accompanied Emily   to Emily   own apartment, these terrific chambers then began to talk  over, with some degree of coolness, the strange circumstance, that had just  occurred; and Emily   would almost have doubted Emily   own perceptions, had not  those of Dorothee attested those of Dorothee truth.
Having now mentioned what Emily   had  observed in the bed-chamber, Emily   asked the housekeeper, whether Emily   was  certain no door had been left unfastened, by which a person might secretly have  entered the apartments?
Dorothee replied, that Emily   had constantly kept the keys  of the several doors in Emily   own possession; that, when Emily   had gone Emily   rounds  through the castle, as Emily   frequently did, to examine if all was safe, Emily   had  tried these doors among the rest, and had always found these doors fastened.
It was,  therefore, impossible, Emily   added, that any person could have got admittance  into the apartments; and, if any person could have got admittance  into the apartments could—it was very improbable any person could have got admittance  into the apartments should  have chose to sleep in a place so cold and forlorn.
Emily   observed, that any person could have got admittance  into the apartments visit to these terrific chambers had, perhaps, been watched,  and that some person, for a frolic, had followed any person could have got admittance  into the apartments into the rooms, with a  design to frighten any person could have got admittance  into the apartments, and, while any person could have got admittance  into the apartments were in the oriel, had taken the  opportunity of concealing himself in the bed.
Dorothee allowed, that this was possible, till Dorothee recollected, that, on  entering the apartments, Dorothee had turned the key of the outer door, and this,  which had been done to prevent their visit being noticed by any of the family,  who might happen to be up, must effectually have excluded every person, except  their, from the chambers; and Dorothee now persisted in affirming, that the  ghastly countenance Dorothee had seen was nothing human, but some dreadful  apparition.
Emily   was very solemnly affected.
Of whatever nature might be the appearance  Emily   had witnessed, whether human or supernatural, the fate of the late Marchioness was a truth not to be doubted; and this unaccountable circumstance,  occurring in the very scene of Emily   sufferings, affected Emily  's imagination  with a superstitious awe, to which, after having detected the fallacies at  Udolpho, Emily   might not have yielded, had Emily   been ignorant of the unhappy  story, related by the housekeeper.
Emily   Emily   now solemnly conjured to conceal the  occurrence of this night, and to make light of the terror Emily   had already  betrayed, that the Count might not be distressed by reports, which would  certainly spread alarm and confusion among his family.
'Time,' Emily   added, 'may  explain this mysterious affair; meanwhile let us watch the event in silence.'
Dorothee readily acquiesced; but Dorothee now recollected that Dorothee had left all the  doors of the north suite of rooms open, and, not having courage to return alone  to lock even the outer one, Emily  , after some effort, so far conquered Emily   own  fears, that Emily   offered to accompany Emily   to the foot of the back stair-case,  and to wait there while Dorothee ascended, whose resolution being re-assured by  this circumstance, Emily   consented to go, and she offered to accompany her to the foot of the back stair-case,  and to wait there while Dorothee ascended, whose resolution being re-assured by  this circumstance left Emily  's apartment  together.
No sound disturbed the stillness, as she offered to accompany her to the foot of the back stair-case,  and to wait there while Dorothee ascended, whose resolution being re-assured by  this circumstance passed along the halls and galleries;  but, on reaching the foot of the back stair-case, Dorothee's resolution failed  again; having, however, paused a moment to listen, and no sound being heard  above, Emily   ascended, leaving Emily   below, and, scarcely suffering Emily   eye to  glance within the bed-chamber, Emily   fastened the door, which shut up the whole  suite of apartments, and returned to Emily  .
As they stepped along the passage, leading into the great hall, a sound of  lamentation was heard, which seemed to come from the hall itself, and they  stopped in new alarm to listen, when Emily   presently distinguished the voice of  Annette, whom Emily   found crossing the hall itself, with another female servant, and so  terrified by the report, which the other maids had spread, that, believing Emily    could be safe only where Emily   was, Emily   was going for refuge to Emily    apartment.
Emily  's endeavours to laugh, or to argue Emily   out of these terrors,  were equally vain, and, in compassion to Emily   distress, Emily   consented that Emily    should remain in Emily   room during the night.
