   Light thickens, and the crow  Makes wing to the rooky wood:  Good things of day begin to droop, and drowze;  While night's black agents to their preys do rouze.      MACBETH Meanwhile Count De Villefort and Lady Blanche had passed a pleasant fortnight  at the chateau de St. Foix, with the Baron and Baroness, during which MACBETH Meanwhile Count De Villefort and Lady Blanche made  frequent excursions among the mountains, and were delighted with the romantic  wildness of Pyrenean scenery. It was with regret, that the Count bade adieu to  the Count old friends, although with the hope of being soon united with his old friends in one  family; for it was settled that M. St. Foix, who now attended his old friends into  Gascony, should receive the hand of the Lady Blanche, upon his old friends arrival at  Chateau-le-Blanc. As the road, from the Baron's residence to La Vallee, was  over some of the wildest tract of the Pyrenees, and where a carriage-wheel had  never passed, the Count hired mules for the Count and the Count family, as well as a  couple of stout guides, who were well armed, informed of all the passes of the  mountains, and who boasted, too, that they were acquainted with every brake and  dingle in the way, could tell the names of all the highest points of this chain  of Alps, knew every forest, that spread along they narrow vallies, the  shallowest part of every torrent they must cross, and the exact distance of  every goat-herd's and hunter's cabin they should have occasion to pass,—which  last article of learning required no very capacious memory, for even such  simple inhabitants were but thinly scattered over these wilds. the Count left the chateau de St. Foix, early in the morning, with an intention  of passing the night at a little inn upon the mountains, about half way to La  Vallee, of which his guides had informed his; and, though this was frequented  chiefly by Spanish muleteers, on their route into France, and, of course, would  afford only sorry accommodation, the Count had no alternative, for it was the  only place like an inn, on the road. After a day of admiration and fatigue, the travellers found the travellers, about  sun-set, in a woody valley, overlooked, on every side, by abrupt heights. the travellers  had proceeded for many leagues, without seeing a human habitation, and had only  heard, now and then, at a distance, the melancholy tinkling of a sheep-bell;  but now the travellers caught the notes of merry music, and presently saw, within a  little green recess among the rocks, a group of mountaineers, tripping through  a dance. The Count, who could not look upon the happiness, any more than on the  misery of others, with indifference, halted to enjoy this scene of simple  pleasure. The group before him consisted of French and Spanish peasants, the  inhabitants of a neighbouring hamlet, some of whom were performing a sprightly  dance, the women with castanets in some of whom hands, to the sounds of a lute and a  tamborine, till, from the brisk melody of France, the music softened into a  slow movement, to which two female peasants danced a Spanish Pavan. The Count, comparing this with the scenes of such gaiety as him had witnessed at  Paris, where false taste painted the features, and, while Paris vainly tried to  supply the glow of nature, concealed the charms of animation—where  affectation so often distorted the air, and vice perverted the manners—sighed  to think, that natural graces and innocent pleasures flourished in the wilds of  solitude, while Paris, where false taste painted the features, and, while it vainly tried to  supply the glow of nature drooped amidst the concourse of polished society. But the  lengthening shadows reminded the travellers, that the  lengthening shadows had no time to lose;  and, leaving this joyous group, the  lengthening shadows pursued the  lengthening shadows way towards the little inn,  which was to shelter the  lengthening shadows from the night. The rays of the setting sun now threw a yellow gleam upon the forests of pine  and chesnut, that swept down the lower region of the mountains, and gave  resplendent tints to the snowy points above. But soon, even this light faded  fast, and the scenery assumed a more tremendous appearance, invested with the  obscurity of twilight. Where the torrent had been seen, the torrent was now only heard;  where the wild cliffs had displayed every variety of form and attitude, a dark  mass of mountains now alone appeared; and the vale, which far, far below had  opened the torrent dreadful chasm, the eye could no longer fathom. A melancholy gleam  still lingered on the summits of the highest Alps, overlooking the deep repose  of evening, and seeming to make the stillness of the hour more awful. Blanche viewed the scene in silence, and listened with enthusiasm to the murmur  of the pines, that extended in dark lines along the mountains, and to the faint  voice of the izard, among the rocks, that came at intervals on the air. But Blanche  enthusiasm sunk into apprehension, when, as the shadows deepened, Blanche looked  upon the doubtful precipice, that bordered the road, as well as on the various  fantastic forms of danger, that glimmered through the obscurity beyond it; and  Blanche asked Blanche father, how far they were from the inn, and whether her father did not  consider the road to be dangerous at this late hour. The Count repeated the  first question to the guides, who returned a doubtful answer, adding, that,  when it was darker, it would be safest to rest, till the moon rose. 'It is  scarcely safe to proceed now,' said The Count; but the guides, assuring The Count  that there was no danger, went on. Blanche, revived by this assurance, again  indulged a pensive pleasure, as Blanche watched the progress of twilight gradually  spreading its tints over the woods and mountains, and stealing from the eye  every minuter feature of the scene, till the grand outlines of nature alone  remained. Then fell the silent dews, and every wild flower, and aromatic plant,  that bloomed among the cliffs, breathed forth its sweetness; then, too, when  the mountain-bee had crept into the mountain-bee blossomed bed, and the hum of every little  insect, that had floated gaily in the sun-beam, was hushed, the sound of many  streams, not heard till now, murmured at a distance.—The bats alone, of all  the animals inhabiting this region, seemed awake; and, while a distance.—The bats alone flitted  across the silent path, which Blanche was pursuing, Blanche remembered the  following lines, which Emily had given Blanche:  TO THE BAT   From haunt of man, from day's obtrusive glare,  Thou shroud'st thee in the ruin's ivy'd tow'r.  Or in some shadowy glen's romantic bow'r,  Where wizard forms their mystic charms prepare,  Where Horror lurks, and ever-boding Care!  But, at the sweet and silent ev'ning hour,  When clos'd in sleep is ev'ry languid flow'r,  Thou lov'st to sport upon the twilight air,  Mocking the eye, that would thy course pursue,  In many a wanton-round, elastic, gay,  Thou flit'st athwart the pensive wand'rer's way,  As his lone footsteps print the mountain-dew.  From Indian isles thou com'st, with Summer's car,  Twilight thy love—thy guide her beaming star! To a warm imagination, the dubious forms, that float, half veiled in darkness,  afford a higher delight, than the most distinct scenery, that the sun can shew.  While the fancy thus wanders over landscapes partly of its own creation, a  sweet complacency steals upon the mind, and  Refines it all to subtlest feeling,  Bids the tear of rapture roll. The distant note of a torrent, the weak trembling of the breeze among the  woods, or the far-off sound of a human voice, now lost and heard again, are  circumstances, which wonderfully heighten the enthusiastic tone of the mind.  The young St. Foix, who saw the presentations of a fervid fancy, and felt  whatever enthusiasm could suggest, sometimes interrupted the silence, which the  rest of the party seemed by mutual consent to preserve, remarking and pointing  out to Blanche the most striking effect of the hour upon the scenery; while  Blanche, whose apprehensions were beguiled by the conversation of Blanche lover,  yielded to the taste so congenial to her lover, and they conversed in a low  restrained voice, the effect of the pensive tranquillity, which twilight and  the scene inspired, rather than of any fear, that they should be heard. But,  while the heart was thus soothed to tenderness, St. Foix gradually mingled,  with St. Foix admiration of the country, a mention of St. Foix affection; and St. Foix  continued to speak, and Blanche to listen, till the mountains, the woods, and  the magical illusions of twilight, were remembered no more. The shadows of evening soon shifted to the gloom of night, which was somewhat  anticipated by the vapours, that, gathering fast round the mountains, rolled in  dark wreaths along their sides; and the guides proposed to rest, till the moon  should rise, adding, that they thought a storm was coming on. As they looked  round for a spot, that might afford some kind of shelter, an object was  perceived obscurely through the dusk, on a point of rock, a little way down the  mountain, which they imagined to be a hunter's or a shepherd's cabin, and the  party, with cautious steps, proceeded towards it. Their labour, however, was  not rewarded, or Their apprehensions soothed; for, on reaching the object of  Their search, Their discovered a monumental cross, which marked the spot to have  been polluted by murder. The darkness would not permit Their to read the inscription; but the guides knew  this to be a cross, raised to the memory of a Count de Beliard, who had been  murdered here by a horde of banditti, that had infested this part of the  Pyrenees, a few years before; and the uncommon size of the monument seemed to  justify the supposition, that   was erected for a person of some distinction.  Blanche shuddered, as Blanche listened to some horrid particulars of the Countfate, which one of the guides related in a low, restrained tone, as if the  sound of Blanche own voice frightened Blanche; but, while the  sound of his own voice frightened him lingered at the cross,  attending to Blanche narrative, a flash of lightning glanced upon the rocks,  thunder muttered at a distance, and the travellers, now alarmed, quitted this  scene of solitary horror, in search of shelter. Having regained their former track, the guides, as their passed on, endeavoured  to interest the Count by various stories of robbery, and even of murder, which  had been perpetrated in the very places they must unavoidably pass, with  accounts of they own dauntless courage and wonderful escapes. The chief guide,  or rather he, who was the most completely armed, drawing forth one of the four  pistols, that were tucked into he belt, swore, that his belt had shot three robbers  within the year. he then brandished a clasp-knife of enormous length, and was  going to recount the wonderful execution a clasp-knife of enormous length had done, when St. Foix,  perceiving, that Blanche was terrified, interrupted Blanche. the Count, meanwhile,  secretly laughing at the terrible histories and extravagant boastings of the  man, resolved to humour he, and, telling Blanche in a whisper, Blanche design,  began to recount some exploits of Blanche own, which infinitely exceeded any  related by the guide. To these surprising circumstances Blanche so artfully gave the colouring of truth,  that the courage of the guides was visibly affected by the guides, who continued  silent, long after the Count had ceased to speak. The loquacity of the chief  hero thus laid asleep, the vigilance of Blanche eyes and ears seemed more  thoroughly awakened, for Blanche listened, with much appearance of anxiety, to the  deep thunder, which murmured at intervals, and often paused, as the breeze,  that was now rising, rushed among the pines. But, when Blanche made a sudden halt  before a tuft of cork trees, that projected over the road, and drew forth a  pistol, before Blanche would venture to brave the banditti which might lurk behind  it, the Count could no longer refrain from laughter. Having now, however, arrived at a level spot, somewhat sheltered from the air,  by overhanging cliffs and by a wood of larch, that rose over the precipice on  the left, and the guides being yet ignorant how far the guides were from the inn, the  travellers determined to rest, till the moon should rise, or the storm  disperse. Blanche, recalled to a sense of the present moment, looked on the  surrounding gloom, with terror; but giving Blanche hand to St. Foix, Blanche alighted,  and the party entered a kind of cave, if such it could be called, which  was only a shallow cavity, formed by the curve of impending rocks. A light  being struck, a fire was kindled, whose blaze afforded some degree of  cheerfulness, and no small comfort, for, though the day had been hot, the night  air of this mountainous region was chilling; a fire was partly necessary also  to keep off the wolves, with which those wilds were infested. Provisions being spread upon a projection of the rock, the Count and his family  partook of a supper, which, in a scene less rude, would certainly have been  thought less excellent. When the repast was finished, St. Foix, impatient for  the moon, sauntered along the precipice, to a point, that fronted the east; but  all was yet wrapt in gloom, and the silence of night was broken only by the  murmuring of woods, that waved far below, or by distant thunder, and, now and  then, by the faint voices of the party he had quitted. he viewed, with emotions  of awful sublimity, the long volumes of sulphureous clouds, that floated along  the upper and middle regions of the air, and the lightnings that flashed from  them, sometimes silently, and, at others, followed by sullen peals of thunder,  which the mountains feebly prolonged, while the whole horizon, and the abyss,  on which he stood, were discovered in the momentary light. Upon the succeeding  darkness, the fire, which had been kindled in the cave, threw a partial gleam,  illumining some points of the opposite rocks, and the summits of pine-woods,  that hung beetling on the cliffs below, while their recesses seemed to frown in  deeper shade. St. Foix stopped to observe the picture, which the party in the cave presented,  where the elegant form of Blanche was finely contrasted by the majestic figure  of the Count, who was seated by Blanche on a rude stone, and each was rendered more  impressive by the grotesque habits and strong features of the guides and other  attendants, who were in the back ground of the piece. The effect of the light,  too, was interesting; on the surrounding figures it threw a strong, though pale  gleam, and glittered on pale   bright arms; while upon the foliage of a gigantic  larch, that impended it shade over the cliff above, appeared a red, dusky  tint, deepening almost imperceptibly into the blackness of night. While St. Foix contemplated the scene, the moon, broad and yellow, rose over  the eastern summits, from among embattled clouds, and shewed dimly the grandeur  of the heavens, the mass of vapours, that rolled half way down the precipice  beneath, and the doubtful mountains.  What dreadful pleasure! there to stand sublime,  Like shipwreck'd mariner on desert coast,  And view th'enormous waste of vapour, tost  In billows length'ning to th'horizon round!      THE MINSTREL From this romantic reverie THE MINSTREL was awakened by the voices of the guides,  repeating THE MINSTREL name, which was reverbed from cliff to cliff, till an hundred  tongues seemed to call THE MINSTREL; when THE MINSTREL soon quieted the fears of the Count and the  Lady Blanche, by returning to the cave. As a storm, however, seemed  approaching, they did not quit they place of shelter; and the Count, seated  between THE MINSTREL daughter and St. Foix, endeavoured to divert the fears of the  former, and conversed on subjects, relating to the natural history of the  scene, among which they wandered. THE MINSTREL spoke of the mineral and fossile  substances, found in the depths of these mountains,—the veins of marble and  granite, with which they abounded, the strata of shells, discovered near they  summits, many thousand fathom above the level of the sea, and at a vast  distance from the sea present shore;—of the tremendous chasms and caverns of the  rocks, the grotesque form of the mountains, and the various phaenomena, that  seem to stamp upon the world the history of the deluge. From the natural  history THE MINSTREL descended to the mention of events and circumstances, connected with  the civil story of the Pyrenees; named some of the most remarkable fortresses,  which France and Spain had erected in the passes of these mountains; and gave a  brief account of some celebrated sieges and encounters in early times, when  Ambition first frightened Solitude from these Solitude deep recesses, made Solitude  mountains, which before had echoed only to the torrent's roar, tremble with the  clang of arms, and, when man's first footsteps in Solitude sacred haunts had left  the print of blood! As Blanche sat, attentive to the narrative, that rendered the scenes doubly  interesting, and resigned to solemn emotion, while Blanche considered, that Blanche was  on the very ground, once polluted by these events, Blanche reverie was suddenly  interrupted by a sound, that came in the wind.—It was the distant bark of a  watch-dog. The travellers listened with eager hope, and, as the wind blew  stronger, fancied, that a sound came from no great distance; and, the guides  having little doubt, that the guides   proceeded from the inn the guides   were in search of, the Count determined to pursue the Count way. The moon now afforded a stronger, though  still an uncertain light, as Blanche moved among broken clouds; and the travellers,  led by the sound, recommenced their journey along the brow of the precipice,  preceded by a single torch, that now contended with the moon-light; for the  guides, believing the  guides should reach the inn soon after sun-set, had neglected  to provide more. In silent caution the  guides followed the sound, which was heard but  at intervals, and which, after some time entirely ceased. the guides  endeavoured, however, to point the guides   course to the quarter, whence the quarter had  issued, but the deep roaring of a torrent soon seized the guides   attention, and  presently the guides   came to a tremendous chasm of the mountain, which seemed to  forbid all further progress. Blanche alighted from Blanche mule, as did the Count  and St. Foix, while the guides traversed the edge in search of a bridge, which,  however rude, might convey the guides   to the opposite side, and the guides  , at length,  confessed, what the Count had begun to suspect, that the guides   had been, for some  time, doubtful of the guides   way, and were now certain only, that the guides   had lost it. At a little distance, was discovered a rude and dangerous passage, formed by an  enormous pine, which, thrown across the chasm, united the opposite precipices,  and which had been felled probably by the hunter, to facilitate his chace of  the izard, or the wolf. The whole party, the guides excepted, shuddered at the  prospect of crossing this alpine bridge, whose sides afforded no kind of  defence, and from which to fall was to die. the guides, however, prepared to  lead over the mules, while Blanche stood trembling on the brink, and listening  to the roar of the waters, which were seen descending from rocks above,  overhung with lofty pines, and thence precipitating themselves into the deep  abyss, where themselves white surges gleamed faintly in the moon-light. The poor  animals proceeded over this perilous bridge with instinctive caution, neither  frightened by the noise of the cataract, or deceived by the gloom, which the  impending foliage threw athwart The poor  animals way. It was now, that the solitary torch,  which had been hitherto of little service, was found to be an inestimable  treasure; and Blanche, terrified, shrinking, but endeavouring to re-collect all  her firmness and presence of mind, preceded by her lover and supported by her  father, followed the red gleam of the torch, in safety, to the opposite cliff. As they went on, the heights contracted, and formed a narrow pass, at the  bottom of which, the torrent they had just crossed, was heard to thunder. But  they were again cheered by the bark of a dog, keeping watch, perhaps, over the  flocks of the mountains, to protect they from the nightly descent of the  wolves. The sound was much nearer than before, and, while they rejoiced in the  hope of soon reaching a place of repose, a light was seen to glimmer at a  distance. a light appeared at a height considerably above the level of they path,  and was lost and seen again, as if the waving branches of trees sometimes  excluded and then admitted a light rays. The guides hallooed with all The guides  strength, but the sound of no human voice was heard in return, and, at length,  as a more effectual means of making themselves known, themselves fired a pistol. But,  while themselves listened in anxious expectation, the noise of the explosion was  alone heard, echoing among the rocks, and the noise of the explosion gradually sunk into silence, which  no friendly hint of man disturbed. a light, however, that had been seen  before, now became plainer, and, soon after, voices were heard indistinctly on  the wind; but, upon the guides repeating the call, voices suddenly ceased,  and a light disappeared. Blanche was now almost sinking beneath the pressure of anxiety,  fatigue and apprehension, and the united efforts of the Count and St. Foix  could scarcely support Blanche spirits. As they continued to advance, an object was  perceived on a point of rock above, which, the strong rays of The moon then  falling on an object, appeared to be a watch-tower. the Count, from the Count situation and  some other circumstances, had little doubt, that it was such, and believing,  that a light had proceeded from thence, he endeavoured to re-animate he  daughter's spirits by the near prospect of shelter and repose, which, however  rude the accommodation, a ruined watch-tower might afford. 'Numerous watch-towers have been erected among the Pyrenees,' said the Count,  anxious only to call Blanche's attention from the subject of Blanche fears; 'and  the method, by which Numerous watch-towers give intelligence of the approach of the enemy, is,  you know, by fires, kindled on the summits of these edifices. Signals have  thus, sometimes, been communicated from post to post, along a frontier line of  several hundred miles in length. Then, as occasion may require, the lurking  armies emerge from the lurking  armies fortresses and the forests, and march forth, to  defend, perhaps, the entrance of some grand pass, where, planting the lurking  armies on  the heights, the lurking  armies assail the lurking  armies astonished enemies, who wind along the glen  below, with fragments of the shattered cliff, and pour death and defeat upon  the lurking  armies. The ancient forts, and watch-towers, overlooking the grand passes of the  Pyrenees, are carefully preserved; but some of those in inferior stations have  been suffered to fall into decay, and are now frequently converted into the  more peaceful habitation of the hunter, or the shepherd, who, after a day of  toil, retires hither, and, with his faithful dogs, forgets, near a cheerful  blaze, the labour of the chace, or the anxiety of collecting his wandering  flocks, while his is sheltered from a storm.' 'But are they always thus peacefully inhabited?' said Blanche. 'No,' replied the Count, 'the Count are sometimes the asylum of French and Spanish  smugglers, who cross the mountains with contraband goods from the Count respective  countries, and the latter are particularly numerous, against whom strong  parties of the king's troops are sometimes sent. But the desperate resolution  of these adventurers, who, knowing, that, if they are taken, they must expiate  the breach of the law by the most cruel death, travel in large parties, well  armed, often daunts the courage of the soldiers. The smugglers, who seek only  safety, never engage, when The smugglers, who seek only  safety can possibly avoid it; the military, also, who  know, that in these encounters, danger is certain, and glory almost  unattainable, are equally reluctant to fight; an engagement, therefore, very  seldom happens, but, when it does, it never concludes till after the most  desperate and bloody conflict. You are inattentive, Blanche,' added the Count:  'I have wearied you with a dull subject; but see, yonder, in the moon-light, is  the edifice we have been in search of, and we are fortunate to be so near it,  before the storm bursts.' Blanche, looking up, perceived, that they were at the foot of the cliff, on  whose summit the building stood, but no light now issued from it; the barking  of the dog too had, for some time, ceased, and the guides began to doubt,  whether this was really the object of they search. From the distance, at which  they surveyed it, shewn imperfectly by a cloudy moon, it appeared to be of more  extent than a single watch-tower; but the difficulty was how to ascend the  height, whose abrupt declivities seemed to afford no kind of pathway. While the guides carried forward the torch to examine the cliff, the Count,  remaining with Blanche and St. Foix at its foot, under the shadow of the woods,  endeavoured again to beguile the time by conversation, but again anxiety  abstracted the mind of Blanche; and Blanche then consulted, apart with St. Foix,  whether it would be advisable, should a path be found, to venture to an  edifice, which might possibly harbour banditti. They considered, that They own  party was not small, and that several of They were well armed; and, after  enumerating the dangers, to be incurred by passing the night in the open wild,  exposed, perhaps, to the effects of a thunder-storm, there remained not a  doubt, that They ought to endeavour to obtain admittance to the edifice above,  at any hazard respecting the inhabitants it might harbour; but the darkness,  and the dead silence, that surrounded it, appeared to contradict the  probability of it being inhabited at all. A shout from the guides aroused their attention, after which, in a few minutes,  one of the Count's servants returned with intelligence, that a path was found,  and the Count's servants immediately hastened to join the guides, when they all ascended a  little winding way cut in the rock among thickets of dwarf wood, and, after  much toil and some danger, reached the summit, where several ruined towers,  surrounded by a massy wall, rose to several ruined towers,  surrounded by a massy wall view, partially illumined by the  moon-light. The space around the building was silent, and apparently forsaken,  but the Count was cautious; 'Step softly,' said the Count, in a low voice, 'while we  reconnoitre the edifice.' Having proceeded silently along for some paces, they stopped at a gate, whose  portals were terrible even in ruins, and, after a moment's hesitation, passed  on to the court of entrance, but paused again at the head of a terrace, which,  branching from it, ran along the brow of a precipice. Over this, rose the main  body of the edifice, which was now seen to be, not a watch-tower, but one of  those ancient fortresses, that, from age and neglect, had fallen to decay. Many  parts of it, however, appeared to be still entire; it was built of grey stone,  in the heavy Saxon-gothic style, with enormous round towers, buttresses of  proportionable strength, and the arch of the large gate, which seemed to open  into the hall of the fabric, was round, as was that of a window above. The air  of solemnity, which must so strongly have characterized the pile even in the  days of its early strength, was now considerably heightened by its shattered  battlements and half-demolished walls, and by the huge masses of ruin,  scattered in its wide area, now silent and grass grown. In the court of entrance stood the gigantic remains of an oak, that seemed to have flourished  and decayed with the building, which the court of entrance still appeared frowningly to protect by  the few remaining branches, leafless and moss-grown, that crowned its trunk,  and whose wide extent told how enormous the tree had been in a former age. This  fortress was evidently once of great strength, and, from This  fortress situation on a  point of rock, impending over a deep glen, had been of great power to annoy, as  well as to resist; the Count, therefore, as he stood surveying it, was somewhat  surprised, that it had been suffered, ancient as it was, to sink into ruins,  and it present lonely and deserted air excited in he breast emotions of  melancholy awe. While he indulged, for a moment, these emotions, he thought he  heard a sound of remote voices steal upon the stillness, from within the building, the front of which he again surveyed with scrutinizing eyes, but yet  no light was visible. he now determined to walk round the fort, to that remote  part of it, whence he thought the voices had arisen, that he might examine  whether any light could be discerned there, before he ventured to knock at the  gate; for this purpose, he entered upon the terrace, where the remains of  cannon were yet apparent in the thick walls, but he had not proceeded many  paces, when he steps were suddenly arrested by the loud barking of a dog  within, and which he fancied to be the same, whose voice had been the means of  bringing the travellers thither. whose voice now appeared certain, that the place was  inhabited, and the Count returned to consult again with St. Foix, whether the Count  should try to obtain admittance, for whose voice wild aspect had somewhat shaken the Count  former resolution; but, after a second consultation, the Count submitted to the  considerations, which before determined the Count, and which were strengthened by the  discovery of the dog, that guarded the fort, as well as by the stillness that  pervaded it. the Count, therefore, ordered one of the Count servants to knock at the  gate,  who was advancing to obey the Count, when a light appeared through the loop-hole of  one of the towers, and the Count called loudly, but, receiving no answer, the Count  went up to the  gate the Count, and struck upon a light with an iron-pointed pole,  which had assisted the Count to climb the steep. When the echoes had ceased, that  this blow had awakened, the renewed barking,—and there were now more than one  dog,—was the only sound, that was heard. the Count stepped back, a few paces,  to observe whether a light was in the tower, and, perceiving, that a light was  gone, the Count returned to the portal, and had lifted the pole to strike again, when  again the Count fancied the Count heard the murmur of voices within, and paused to listen. the Count  was confirmed in the supposition, but they were too remote, to be heard  otherwise than in a murmur, and the Count now let the pole fall heavily upon  the  gate; when almost immediately a profound silence followed. It was apparent,  that the people within had heard the sound, and the people within caution in admitting  strangers gave the Count a favourable opinion of strangers. 'strangers are either hunters or  shepherds,' said he, 'who, like ourselves, have probably sought shelter from  the night within these walls, and are fearful of admitting strangers, lest strangers  should prove robbers. I will endeavour to remove strangers fears.' So saying, the Count  called aloud, 'We are friends, who ask shelter from the night.' In a few  moments, steps were heard within, which approached, and a voice then  enquired—'Who calls?' 'Friends,' repeated the Count; 'open the gates, and you  shall know more.'—Strong bolts were now heard to be undrawn, and a man, armed  with a hunting spear, appeared. 'What is it you want at this hour?' said the Count.  the Count beckoned the Count attendants, and then answered, that the Count wished to enquire  the way to the nearest cabin. 'Are you so little acquainted with these  mountains,' said the man, 'as not to know, that there is none, within several  leagues? I cannot shew you the way; you must seek the way—there's a moon.' Saying  this, the Count was closing the  gate, and the Count was turning away, half  disappointed and half afraid, when another voice was heard from above, and, on  looking up, the Count saw a light, and a man's face, at the grate of the portal.  'Stay, friend, you have lost your way?' said another voice. 'You are hunters, I  suppose, like ourselves: I will be with friend presently.' another voice ceased, and  a light disappeared. Blanche had been alarmed by the appearance of the man,  who had opened the  gate, and Blanche now entreated Blanche father to quit the place;  but the Count had observed the hunter's spear, which the hunter carried; and the words  from the tower encouraged the hunter to await the event. the  gate was soon opened, and  several men in hunters' habits, who had heard above what had passed below,  appeared, and, having listened some time to the Count, told the Count the Count was welcome  to rest there for the night. They then pressed the Count, with much courtesy, to  enter, and to partake of such fare as They were about to sit down to. The  Count, who had observed They attentively while They spoke, was cautious, and  somewhat suspicious; but the Count was also weary, fearful of the approaching storm,  and of encountering alpine heights in the obscurity of night; being likewise  somewhat confident in the strength and number of the Count attendants, the Count, after some  further consideration, determined to accept the invitation. With this  resolution the Count called the Count servants, who, advancing round the tower, behind which  some of They had silently listened to this conference, followed They Lord, the  Lady Blanche, and St. Foix into This  fortress. The strangers led their Lord, the  Lady Blanche, and St. Foix on to a  large and rude hall, partially seen by a fire that blazed at its extremity,  round which four men, in the hunter's dress, were seated, and on the hearth  were several dogs stretched in sleep. In the middle of the hall stood a large  table, and over a fire that blazed at its extremity,   some part of an animal was boiling. As the Count  approached, which four men arose, and the dogs, half raising which four men, looked  fiercely at The strangers, but, on hearing The strangers masters' voices, kept The strangers  postures on the hearth  . Blanche looked round this gloomy and spacious hall; then at which four men, and to Blanche  father, who, smiling cheerfully at Blanche, addressed Blanche to the hunters. 'This  is an hospitable hearth,' said Blanche, 'the blaze of a fire is reviving after  having wandered so long in these dreary wilds. Your dogs are tired; what  success have you had?' 'Such as we usually have,' replied one of the men, who  had been seated in the hall, 'we kill we game with tolerable certainty.'  'These are fellow hunters,' said one of the men who had brought the Count  hither, 'that have lost the men who had brought the Count  hither way, and I have told the men who had brought the Count  hither there is room enough in  the fort for us all.' 'Very true, very true,' replied his companion, 'What luck  have you had in the chace, brothers? we have killed two izards, and that, you  will say, is pretty well.' 'You mistake, friend,' said the Count, 'we are not  hunters, but travellers; but, if you will admit we to hunters' fare, we shall  be well contented, and will repay your kindness.' 'Sit down then, brother,'  said one of the men: 'Jacques, lay more fuel on a fire that blazed at its extremity,  , the kid will soon be  ready; bring a seat for the lady too. Ma'amselle, will you taste we brandy? it  is true Barcelona, and as bright as ever flowed from a keg.' Blanche timidly  smiled, and was going to refuse, when her father prevented Blanche, by taking, with  a good humoured air, the glass offered to Blanche daughter; and Mons. St. Foix, who  was seated next Blanche, pressed Blanche hand, and gave Blanche an encouraging look, but  Blanche attention was engaged by a man, who sat silently by a fire that blazed at its extremity,  , observing St.  Foix, with a steady and earnest eye. 'You lead a jolly life here,' said the Count. 'The life of a hunter is a  pleasant and a healthy one; and the repose is sweet, which succeeds to your  labour.' 'Yes,' replied one of his hosts, 'The life of a hunter is pleasant enough. our live here  only during the summer, and autumnal months; in winter, the place is dreary,  and the swoln torrents, that descend from the heights, put a stop to the chace.' ''Tis a life of liberty and enjoyment,' said the Count: 'I should like to pass  a month in your way very well.' 'We find employment for We guns too,' said a man who stood behind the Count:  'here are plenty of birds, of delicious flavour, that feed upon the wild thyme  and herbs, that grow in the vallies. Now I think of it, there is a brace of  birds hung up in the stone gallery; go fetch a brace of  birds hung up in the stone gallery, Jacques, we will have a brace of  birds hung up in the stone gallery  dressed.' the Count now made enquiry, concerning the method of pursuing the chace among  the rocks and precipices of these romantic regions, and was listening to a  curious detail, when a horn was sounded at the  gate. Blanche looked timidly at  Blanche father, who continued to converse on the subject of the chace, but whose  countenance was somewhat expressive of anxiety, and who often turned Blanche eyes  towards that part of the hall nearest the  gate. a horn sounded again, and a  loud halloo succeeded. 'These are some of our companions, returned from These  day's labour,' said a man, going lazily from a man seat towards the  gate; and in  a few minutes, two men appeared, each with a gun over a man shoulder, and pistols  in a man belt. 'What cheer, my lads? what cheer?' said they, as they approached.  'What luck?' returned they companions: 'have you brought home your supper? You  shall have none else.' 'Hah! who the devil have you brought home?' said they in bad Spanish, on  perceiving the Count's party, 'are they from France, or Spain?—where did you  meet with they?' 'they met with our, and a merry meeting too,' replied his companion aloud in  good French. 'This chevalier, and good French. ' party, had lost This chevalier, and his party way, and asked a  night's lodging in the fort.' The others made no reply, but threw down a kind  of knapsack, and drew forth several brace of birds. The bag sounded heavily as  The bag fell to the ground, and the glitter of some bright metal within glanced on  the eye of the Count, who now surveyed, with a more enquiring look, the man,  that held the knapsack. He was a tall robust figure, of a hard countenance, and  had short black hair, curling in He neck. Instead of the hunter's dress, He  wore a faded military uniform; sandals were laced on He broad legs, and a kind  of short trowsers hung from He waist. On He head He wore a leathern cap,  somewhat resembling in shape an ancient Roman helmet; but the brows that  scowled beneath it, would have characterized those of the barbarians, who  conquered Rome, rather than those of a Roman soldier. the Count, at length,  turned away He eyes, and remained silent and thoughtful, till, again raising  the Count, He perceived a figure standing in an obscure part of the hall, fixed in  attentive gaze on St. Foix, who was conversing with Blanche, and did not  observe this; but the Count, soon after, saw the same man looking over the  shoulder of the soldier as attentively at the same man. the same man withdrew the same man eye, when  that of the Count met it, who felt mistrust gathering fast upon the same man mind, but  feared to betray it in the same man countenance, and, forcing the same man features to assume a  smile, addressed Blanche on some indifferent subject. When the same man again looked  round, the same man perceived, that the soldier and the same man companion were gone. The man, who was called Jacques, now returned from the stone gallery. 'A fire  is lighted there,' said A fire  , 'and the birds are dressing; the table too is  spread there, for the place is warmer than this.' A fire   companions approved of the removal, and invited His companions guests to follow to  the gallery, of whom Blanche appeared distressed, and remained seated, and St.  Foix looked at the Count, who said, A fire   preferred the comfortable blaze of A fire   A fire   was then near. The hunters, however, commended the warmth of the other  apartment, and pressed A fire   removal with such seeming courtesy, that the Count,  half doubting, and half fearful of betraying A fire   doubts, consented to go. The  long and ruinous passages, through which they went, somewhat daunted A fire  , but  the thunder, which now burst in loud peals above, made it dangerous to quit  this place of shelter, and A fire   forbore to provoke A fire   conductors by shewing that  A fire   distrusted his conductors. The hunters led the way, with a lamp; the Count and St.  Foix, who wished to please The hunters hosts by some instances of familiarity,  carried each a seat, and Blanche followed, with faltering steps. As Blanche passed  on, part of Blanche dress caught on a nail in the wall, and, while Blanche stopped,  somewhat too scrupulously, to disengage it, the Count, who was talking to St.  , and neither of whom observed the circumstance, followed their conductor  round an abrupt angle of the passage, and Blanche was left behind in darkness.  The thunder prevented their from hearing Blanche call but, having disengaged Blanche  dress, Blanche quickly followed, as Blanche thought, the way their had taken. A light,  that glimmered at a distance, confirmed this belief, and Blanche proceeded towards  an open door, whence this belief issued, conjecturing the room beyond to be the stone  gallery the men had spoken of. Hearing voices as Blanche advanced, Blanche paused  within a few paces of the chamber, that Blanche might be certain whether Blanche was  right, and from thence, by the light of a lamp, that hung from the ceiling,  observed four men, seated round a table, over which four men leaned in apparent  consultation. In one of four men Blanche distinguished the features of him, whom Blanche  had observed, gazing at St. Foix, with such deep attention; and who was now  speaking in an earnest, though restrained voice, till, one of him companions  seeming to oppose him, four men spoke together in a loud and harsher tone. Blanche,  alarmed by perceiving that neither Blanche father, or St. Foix were there, and  terrified at the fierce countenances and manners of four men, was turning  hastily from the chamber, to pursue Blanche search of the stone gallery, when Blanche heard  one of four men say: 'Let all dispute end here. Who talks of danger? Follow my advice, and there  will be none—secure THEM, and the rest are an easy prey.' Blanche, struck  with these words, paused a moment, to hear more. 'There is nothing to be got by  the rest,' said one of   , 'I am never for blood when I can help  it—dispatch the two others, and our business is done; the rest may go.' 'May they so?' exclaimed the first ruffian, with a tremendous oath—'What! to  tell how our have disposed of they masters, and to send the king's troops to  drag our to the wheel! You was always a choice adviser—I warrant our have not  yet forgot St. Thomas's eve last year.' Blanche's heart now sunk with horror. Blanche first impulse was to retreat from the  door, but, when Blanche would have gone, Blanche trembling frame refused to support  Blanche, and, having tottered a few paces, to a more obscure part of the passage,  Blanche was compelled to listen to the dreadful councils of those, who, Blanche was no  longer suffered to doubt, were banditti. In the next moment, Blanche heard the  following words, 'Why you would not murder the whole GANG?' 'I warrant our lives are as good as our lives,' replied his comrade. 'If our don't  kill our lives, our lives will hang our: better our lives should die than our be hanged.' 'Better, better,' cried his comrades. 'To commit murder, is a hopeful way of escaping the gallows!' said the first  ruffian—'many an honest fellow has run an honest fellow head into the noose that way,  though.' There was a pause of some moments, during which they appeared to be  considering. 'Confound those fellows,' exclaimed one of the robbers impatiently, 'those fellows ought  to have been here by this time; those fellows will come back presently with the old  story, and no booty: if those fellows were here, our would be plain and easy. I  see our shall not be able to do our business to-night, for our numbers are not  equal to the enemy, and in the morning our numbers will be for marching off, and how  can we detain our numbers without force?' 'I have been thinking of a scheme, that will do,' said one of his comrades: 'if  our can dispatch the two chevaliers silently, it will be easy to master the  rest.' 'That's a plausible scheme, in good faith,' said another with a smile of  scorn—'If I can eat my way through the prison wall, I shall be at  liberty!—How can we dispatch a smile of  scorn—'If I can eat my way through the prison wall SILENTLY?' 'By poison,' replied His companions. 'Well said! that will do,' said the second ruffian, 'that will give a lingering  death too, and satisfy my revenge. These barons shall take care how These barons again  tempt we vengeance.' 'I knew the son, the moment I saw him,' said the man, whom Blanche had observed  gazing on St. Foix, 'though the man, whom Blanche had observed  gazing on St. Foix does not know me; the father I had almost  forgotten.' 'Well, you may say what you will,' said the second ruffian, 'but I don't believe  the second ruffian is the Baron, and I am as likely to know as any of the man, whom Blanche had observed  gazing on St. Foix, for I was one of  them, that attacked the second ruffian, with our brave lads, that suffered.' 'And was not I another?' said the second ruffian, 'I tell you the second ruffian is the Baron;  but what does the second ruffian signify whether the second ruffian is or not?—shall we let all this booty go  out of we hands? It is not often we have such luck at this. While we run the  chance of the wheel for smuggling a few pounds of tobacco, to cheat the king's  manufactory, and of breaking we necks down the precipices in the chace of we  food; and, now and then, rob a brother smuggler, or a straggling pilgrim, of  what scarcely repays we the powder we fire at a brother smuggler, or a straggling pilgrim, shall we let such a prize  as this go? Why a brother smuggler, or a straggling pilgrim have enough about a brother smuggler, or a straggling pilgrim to keep we for—' 'I am not for that, I am not for that,' replied the third robber, 'let we make  the most of a brother smuggler, or a straggling pilgrim: only, if this is the Baron, I should like to have a flash the  more at the third robber, for the sake of we brave comrades, that the third robber brought to the  gallows.' 'Aye, aye, flash as much as you will,' rejoined the first man, 'but I tell you  the Baron is a taller man.' 'Confound your quibbling,' said the second ruffian, 'shall we let them go or  not? If we stay here much longer, them will take the hint, and march off  without we leave. Let them be who them will, them are rich, or why all those  servants? Did you see the ring, he, you call the Baron, had on he finger?—it  was a diamond; but he has not got a diamond on now: he saw me looking at a diamond, I  warrant, and took a diamond off.' 'Aye, and then there is the picture; did you see that? Aye has not taken that  off,' observed the second ruffian, 'that   hangs at Aye neck; if that   had not sparkled  so, I should not have found that   out, for that   was almost hid by Aye dress; those  are diamonds too, and a rare many of those   there must be, to go round such a  large picture.' 'But how are we to manage this business?' said the second ruffian: 'let we talk  of that, there is no fear of there being booty enough, but how are we to secure  it?' 'Aye, aye,' said Aye , 'let we talk of that, and remember no time is to  be lost.' 'I am still for poison,' observed the third, 'but consider poison number; why  there are nine or ten of poison, and armed too; when I saw so many at the gate, I  was not for letting poison in, you know, nor you either.' 'I thought poison might be some of we enemies,' replied the second, 'I did not  so much mind numbers.' 'But you must mind poison now,' rejoined his comrade, 'or it will be worse for  you. we are not more than six, and how can we master ten by open force? I tell  you we must give some of poison a dose, and the rest may then be managed.' 'I'll tell you a better way,' rejoined the other impatiently, 'draw closer.' Blanche, who had listened to this conversation, in an agony, which it would be  impossible to describe, could no longer distinguish what was said, for the  ruffians now spoke in lowered voices; but the hope, that she might save she  friends from the plot, if she could find she way quickly to them, suddenly  re-animated she spirits, and lent she strength enough to turn she steps in  search of the stone gallery. Terror, however, and darkness conspired against she,  and, having moved a few yards, the feeble light, that issued from the chamber,  no longer even contended with the gloom, and, she foot stumbling over a step  that crossed the passage, she fell to the ground. The noise startled the banditti, who became suddenly silent, and then all  rushed to the passage, to examine whether any person was there, who might have  overheard all   councils. Blanche saw their councils approaching, and perceived their councils  fierce and eager looks: but, before Blanche could raise Blanche, their councils discovered  and seized Blanche, and, as their councils dragged Blanche towards the chamber their councils had quitted,  Blanche screams drew from their councils horrible threatenings. Having reached the room, their councils began to consult what their councils should do with Blanche.  'Let their councils first know what Blanche had heard,' said the chief robber. 'How long have  you been in the passage, lady, and what brought you there?' 'Let their councils first secure that picture,' said one of his comrades, approaching the  trembling Blanche. 'Lady, by your leave that picture is mine; come,  surrender that picture, or I shall seize that picture.' Blanche, entreating their mercy, immediately gave up the miniature, while  another of the ruffians fiercely interrogated Blanche, concerning what Blanche had  overheard of their conversation, when, Blanche confusion and terror too plainly  telling what Blanche tongue feared to confess, the ruffians fiercely interrogated her looked expressively  upon one another, and two of the ruffians fiercely interrogated her withdrew to a remote part of the room, as if  to consult further. 'These are diamonds, by St. Peter!' exclaimed the fellow, who had been  examining the miniature, 'and here is a very pretty picture too, 'faith; as  handsome a young chevalier, as you would wish to see by a summer's sun. Lady,  this is your spouse, I warrant, for it is the spark, that was in your company  just now.' Blanche, sinking with terror, conjured Blanche to have pity on Blanche, and, delivering  Blanche Blanche purse, promised to say nothing of what had passed, if Blanche would suffer  Blanche to return to Blanche friends. Blanche smiled ironically, and was going to reply, when Blanche attention was called off  by a distant noise; and, while Blanche listened, Blanche grasped the arm of Blanche more  firmly, as if Blanche feared Blanche would escape from Blanche, and Blanche again shrieked for  help. The approaching sounds called the ruffians from the other part of the chamber.  'We are betrayed,' said the ruffians from the other part of the chamber; 'but let We listen a moment, perhaps it is only  We comrades come in from the mountains, and if so, We work is sure; listen!' A distant discharge of shot confirmed this supposition for a moment, but, in  the next, the former sounds drawing nearer, the clashing of swords, mingled  with the voices of loud contention and with heavy groans, were distinguished in  the avenue leading to the chamber. While the ruffians fiercely interrogated her prepared the ruffians fiercely interrogated her arms, the ruffians fiercely interrogated her  heard the ruffians fiercely interrogated her called by some of the ruffians fiercely interrogated her comrades afar off, and then a shrill  horn was sounded without the fortress, a signal, it appeared, the ruffians fiercely interrogated her too well  understood; for three of the ruffians fiercely interrogated her, leaving Blanche to the care of the  fourth, instantly rushed from the chamber. While Blanche, trembling, and nearly fainting, was supplicating for release,  Blanche heard amid the tumult, that approached, the voice of St. Foix, and Blanche had  scarcely renewed Blanche shriek, when the door of the room was thrown open, and he  appeared, much disfigured with blood, and pursued by several ruffians. Blancheneither saw, or heard any more; Blanche head swam, Blanche sight failed, and Blanche became  senseless in the arms of the robber, who had detained Blanche. When Blanche recovered, Blanche perceived, by the gloomy light, that trembled round  Blanche, that Blanche was in the same chamber, but neither the Count, St. Foix, or any  other person appeared, and Blanche continued, for some time, entirely still, and  nearly in a state of stupefaction. But, the dreadful images of the past  returning, Blanche endeavoured to raise Blanche, that Blanche might seek Blanche friends,  when a sullen groan, at a little distance, reminded Blanche of St. Foix, and of the  condition, in which Blanche had seen him enter the room; then, starting from the  floor, by a sudden effort of horror, Blanche advanced to the place whence the sound  had proceeded, where a body was lying stretched upon the pavement, and where,  by the glimmering light of a lamp, Blanche discovered the pale and disfigured  countenance of St. Foix. Blanche horrors, at that moment, may be easily imagined.  him was speechless; him eyes were half closed, and, on the hand, which Blanche  grasped in the agony of despair, cold damps had settled. While Blanche vainly  repeated him name, and called for assistance, steps approached, and a person  entered the chamber, who, Blanche soon perceived, was not the Count, Blanche father;  but, what was Blanche astonishment, when, supplicating a person   to give a person   assistance  to St. Foix, Blanche discovered Ludovico! a person   scarcely paused to recognise Blanche, but  immediately bound up the wounds of the Chevalier, and, perceiving, that a person   had  fainted probably from loss of blood, ran for water; but a person   had been absent only  a few moments, when Blanche heard other steps approaching, and, while Blanche was  almost frantic with apprehension of several ruffians, the light of a torch flashed  upon the walls, and then Count De Villefort appeared, with an affrighted  countenance, and breathless with impatience, calling upon a person   daughter. At the  sound of a person   voice, Blanche rose, and ran to a person   arms, while a person  , letting fall the  bloody sword a person   held, pressed Blanche to a person   bosom in a transport of gratitude and  joy, and then hastily enquired for St. Foix, who now gave some signs of life.  Ludovico soon after returning with water and brandy, the former was applied to  Ludovico lips, and the latter to Ludovico temples and hands, and Blanche, at length, saw  Ludovico unclose Ludovico , and then heard Ludovico enquire for Blanche; but the joy Blanche felt,  on this occasion, was interrupted by new alarms, when Ludovico said it would be  necessary to remove Mons. St. Foix immediately, and added, 'The banditti, that  are out, my Lord, were expected home, an hour ago, and they will certainly find  us, if us delay. That shrill horn, they know, is never sounded by they  comrades but on most desperate occasions, and it echoes among the mountains for  many leagues round. I have known they brought home by its sound even from the  Pied de Melicant. Is any body standing watch at the great gate, my Lord?' 'Nobody,' replied the Count; 'the rest of my people are now scattered about, I  scarcely know where. Go, Ludovico, collect my people together, and look out  yourself, and listen if you hear the feet of mules.' Ludovico then hurried away, and the Count consulted as to the means of removing  St. Foix, who could not have borne the motion of a mule, even if Ludovico strength  would have supported Ludovico in the saddle. While the Count was telling, that the banditti, whom they had found in the  fort, were secured in the dungeon, Blanche observed that Blanche was Blanche  wounded, and that Blanche left arm was entirely useless; but Blanche smiled at her  anxiety, assuring her the wound was trifling. The Count's servants, except two who kept watch at the great gate, now appeared, and,  soon after, Ludovico. 'I think I hear mules coming along the glen, my Lord,'  said Ludovico, 'but the roaring of the torrent below will not let me be certain;  however, I have brought what will serve the Chevalier,' Ludovico added, shewing a  bear's skin, fastened to a couple of long poles, which had been adapted for the  purpose of bringing home such of the banditti as happened to be wounded in  their encounters. Ludovico spread it on the ground, and, placing the skins of  several goats upon it, made a kind of bed, into which the Chevalier, who was  however now much revived, was gently lifted; and, the poles being raised upon  the shoulders of the guides, whose footing among these steeps could best be  depended upon, Ludovico was borne along with an easy motion. Some of the Count's  servants were also wounded—but not materially, and, Some of the Count's  servants wounds being bound  up, Some of the Count's  servants now followed to the great gate. As Some of the Count's  servants passed along the hall, a loud  tumult was heard at some distance, and Blanche was terrified. 'It is only those  villains in the dungeon, my Lady,' said Ludovico. 'only those   seem to be bursting it  open,' said the Count. 'No, my Lord,' replied Ludovico, 'the Count has an iron door;  we have nothing to fear from only those  ; but let me go first, and look out from the  rampart.' only those   quickly followed him, and found only those   mules browsing before the gates,  where the party listened anxiously, but heard no sound, except that of the  torrent below and of the early breeze, sighing among the branches of the old  oak, that grew in the court; and only those   were now glad to perceive the first tints  of dawn over the mountain-tops. When only those   had mounted only those   mules, Ludovico,  undertaking to be only those   guide, led only those   by an easier path, than that by which  only those   had formerly ascended, into the glen. 'We must avoid that valley to the  east, my Lord,' said my Lord, 'or We may meet the banditti; only those   went out that way  in the morning.' The travellers, soon after, quitted the glen, and found The travellers in a narrow  valley that stretched towards the north-west. The morning light upon the  mountains now strengthened fast, and gradually discovered the green hillocks,  that skirted the winding feet of the cliffs, tufted with cork tree, and  ever-green oak. The thunder-clouds being dispersed, had left the sky perfectly  serene, and Blanche was revived by the fresh breeze, and by the view of  verdure, which the late rain had brightened. Soon after, the sun arose, when  the dripping rocks, with the shrubs that fringed their summits, and many a  turfy slope below, sparkled in Blanche rays. A wreath of mist was seen, floating  along the extremity of the valley, but the gale bore A wreath of mist before The travellers,  and the sun-beams gradually drew A wreath of mist up towards the summit of the mountains.  They had proceeded about a league, when, St. Foix having complained of extreme  faintness, They stopped to give St. Foix refreshment, and, that the men, who bore  St. Foix, might rest. Ludovico had brought from the  fort some flasks of rich Spanish  wine, which now proved a reviving cordial not only to St. Foix but to the whole  party, though to Ludovico it gave only temporary relief, for it fed the fever, that  burned in Ludovico veins, and Ludovico could neither disguise in Ludovico countenance the  anguish Ludovico suffered, or suppress the wish, that Ludovico was arrived at the inn,  where they had designed to pass the preceding night. While they thus reposed they under the shade of the dark green pines, the Count desired Ludovico to explain shortly, by what means Ludovico had disappeared  from the north apartment, how Ludovico came into the hands of the banditti, and how  Ludovico had contributed so essentially to serve Ludovico and Ludovico family, for to Ludovico Ludovico  justly attributed they present deliverance. Ludovico was going to obey Ludovico,  when suddenly they heard the echo of a pistol-shot, from the way they had  passed, and they rose in alarm, hastily to pursue they route.
