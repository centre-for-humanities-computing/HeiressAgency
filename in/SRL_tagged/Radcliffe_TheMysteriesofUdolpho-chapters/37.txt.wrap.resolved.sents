      Thus on the chill Lapponian's dreary land,  For many a long month lost in snow profound,  When Sol from Cancer sends the seasons bland,  And in their northern cave the storms hath bound;  From silent mountains, straight, with startling sound,  Torrents are hurl'd, green hills emerge, and lo,  The trees with foliage, cliffs with flow'rs are crown'd;  Pure rills through vales of verdure warbling go;  And wonder, love, and joy, the peasant's heart o'erflow.
BEATTIE Several of BEATTIE succeeding days passed in suspense, for Ludovico could only  learn from the soldiers, that there was a prisoner in the apartment, described  to BEATTIE by Emily, and that BEATTIE was a Frenchman, whom they had taken in one of  they skirmishes, with a party of BEATTIE countrymen.
During this interval, Emily  escaped the persecutions of Bertolini, and Verezzi, by confining Emily   to Emily    apartment; except that sometimes, in an evening, Emily   ventured to walk in the  adjoining corridor.
Montoni appeared to respect Montoni last promise, though Montoni had  prophaned Montoni first; for to Montoni protection only could Emily   attribute Emily   present  repose; and in this Emily   was now so secure, that Emily   did not wish to leave the  castle, till Emily   could obtain some certainty concerning Valancourt; for which  Emily   waited, indeed, without any sacrifice of Emily   own comfort, since no  circumstance had occurred to make Emily   escape probable.
On the fourth day, Ludovico informed Emily  , that Ludovico had hopes of being admitted  to the presence of the prisoner; it being the turn of a soldier, with whom he  had been for some time familiar, to attend he on the following night.
he was  not deceived in he hope; for, under pretence of carrying in a pitcher of  water, he entered the prison, though, he prudence having prevented he from  telling the sentinel the real motive of he visit, he was obliged to make he  conference with the prisoner a very short one.
Emily awaited the result in her own apartment, Ludovico having promised to  accompany Annette to the corridor, in the evening; where, after several hours  impatiently counted, Ludovico arrived.
Emily, having then uttered the name of  Valancourt, could articulate no more, but hesitated in trembling expectation.
'The Chevalier would not entrust me with The Chevalier name, Signora,' replied Ludovico;  'but, when I just mentioned The Chevalier, The Chevalier seemed overwhelmed with joy, though The Chevalier  was not so much surprised as I expected.'
'Does The Chevalier then remember me?'
she  exclaimed.
'O!
it is Mons.
Valancourt,' said Annette, and looked impatiently at Ludovico,  who understood Annette look, and replied to Emily: 'Yes, lady, The Chevalier does,  indeed, remember you, and, I am sure, has a very great regard for Emily, and I  made bold to say you had for The Chevalier.
The Chevalier then enquired how you came to know The Chevalier was  in the castle, and whether you ordered me to speak to The Chevalier.
The first question I  could not answer, but the second I did; and then The Chevalier went off into The Chevalier ecstasies  again.
I was afraid The Chevalier joy would have betrayed The Chevalier to the sentinel at the  door.'
'But how does The Chevalier look, Ludovico?'
interrupted Emily: 'is Ludovico not melancholy and  ill with this long confinement?
'—'Why, as to melancholy, I saw no symptom of  that, lady, while I was with Ludovico, for Ludovico seemed in the finest spirits I ever  saw any body in, in all my life.
Ludovico countenance was all joy, and, if one may  judge from that, Ludovico was very well; but I did not ask Ludovico.'
'Did Ludovico send me no  message?'
said Emily.
'O yes, Signora, and something besides,' replied  Ludovico, who searched his pockets.
'Surely, I have not lost it,' added his.
'The Chevalier said, The Chevalier would have written, madam, if The Chevalier had had pen and ink,  and was going to have sent a very long message, when the sentinel entered the  room, but not before The Chevalier had give me this.'
Ludovico then drew forth a miniature  from Ludovico bosom, which Emily received with a trembling hand, and perceived to be  a portrait of Emily—the very picture, which Emily mother had lost so  strangely in the fishing-house at La Vallee.
Tears of mingled joy and tenderness flowed to Emily eyes, while Ludovicoproceeded—'"Tell your lady," said The Chevalier, as The Chevalier gave me the picture,  "that this has been my companion, and only solace in all my misfortunes.
Tell  Emily, that I have worn it next my heart, and that I sent it Emily as the pledge of  an affection, which can never die; that I would not part with it, but to Emily,  for the wealth of worlds, and that I now part with it, only in the hope of soon  receiving it from Emily hands.
Tell her"—Just then, Signora, the sentinel came  in, and The Chevalier said no more; but The Chevalier had before asked me to contrive an  interview for The Chevalier with you; and when I told The Chevalier, how little hope I had of  prevailing with the guard to assist me, The Chevalier said, that was not, perhaps, of so  much consequence as I imagined, and bade me contrive to bring back your answer,  and The Chevalier would inform me of more than The Chevalier chose to do then.
So this, I think,  lady, is the whole of what passed.'
'How, Ludovico, shall I reward you for your zeal?'
said Emily: 'but, indeed, I  do not now possess the means.
When can you see The Chevalier The Chevalier again?'
'That is  uncertain, Signora,' replied The Chevalier.
'It depends upon who stands guard next: there  are not more than one or two among guard, from whom I would dare to ask  admittance to the prison-chamber.'
'I need not bid you remember, Ludovico,' resumed Emily, 'how very much  interested I am in your seeing The Chevalier The Chevalier soon; and, when you do so, tell  The Chevalier, that I have received the picture, and, with the sentiments The Chevalier wished.
Tell  The Chevalier I have suffered much, and still suffer—' She paused.
'But shall I tell  The Chevalier you will see The Chevalier, lady?'
said Ludovico.
'Most certainly I will,' replied  Emily.
'But when, Signora, and where?'
'That must depend upon circumstances,'  returned Emily.
'The place, and the hour, must be regulated by The Chevalier  opportunities.'
'As to the place, mademoiselle,' said Annette, 'there is no other place in the  castle, besides this corridor, where WE can see him in safety, you know; and,  as for the hour,—it must be when all the Signors are asleep, if that ever  happens!'
'You may mention these circumstances to The Chevalier,'  said The Chevalier, checking the flippancy of Annette, 'and leave the flippancy of Annette to The Chevalier judgment  and opportunity.
Tell The Chevalier, my heart is unchanged.
But, above all, let The Chevalier see  you again as soon as possible; and, Ludovico, I think it is needless to tell  you I shall very anxiously look for The Chevalier.'
Having then wished The Chevalier good night,  Ludovico descended the staircase, and Emily retired to rest, but not to sleep,  for joy now rendered Emily as wakeful, as Emily had ever been from grief.
Montoni  and Montoni   castle had all vanished from Emily mind, like the frightful vision of a  necromancer, and Emily wandered, once more, in fairy scenes of unfading happiness:      As when, beneath the beam  Of summer moons, the distant woods among,  Or by some flood, all silver'd with the gleam,  The soft embodied Fays thro' airy portals stream.
A week elapsed, before Ludovico again visited the prison; for the sentinels,  during that period, were men, in whom Ludovico could not confide, and Ludovico feared to  awaken curiosity, by asking to see men, in whom he could not confide prisoner.
In this interval, Ludovico  communicated to Emily terrific reports of what was passing in the castle; of  riots, quarrels, and of carousals more alarming than either; while from some  circumstances, which Ludovico mentioned, Emily not only doubted, whether Montoni   meant  ever to release Emily, but greatly feared, that Ludovico had designs, concerning  her,—such as Emily had formerly dreaded.
Emily name was frequently mentioned in  the conversations, which Bertolini and Verezzi held together, and, at those  times, those   were frequently in contention.
Montoni   had lost large sums to  Verezzi, so that there was a dreadful possibility of Montoni   designing Montoni   to be a  substitute for the debt; but, as Montoni   was ignorant, that Montoni   had formerly  encouraged the hopes of Bertolini also, concerning Montoni  , after the latter  had done Montoni   some signal service, Montoni   knew not how to account for these  contentions between Bertolini and Verezzi.
The cause of them, however, appeared  to be of little consequence, for Montoni   thought Montoni   saw destruction approaching in  many forms, and Montoni   entreaties to Ludovico to contrive an escape and to see the  prisoner again, were more urgent than ever.
At length, the  prisoner informed Montoni  , that the  prisoner had again visited the Chevalier, who had  directed the  prisoner to confide in the guard of the prison, from whom the  prisoner had already  received some instances of kindness, and who had promised to permit the  prisoner going  into the castle for half an hour, on the ensuing night, when Montoni   and Montoni    companions should be engaged at Montoni and his  companions carousals.
'This was kind, to be sure,'  added Ludovico: 'but Sebastian knows Sebastian runs no risque in letting The Chevalierout, for, if Sebastian can get beyond the bars and iron doors of the castle, Sebastian must  be cunning indeed.
But The Chevalier desired me, Signora, to go to you  immediately, and to beg you would allow Sebastian to visit you, this night, if it was  only for a moment, for that Sebastian could no longer live under the same roof,  without seeing you; the hour, Sebastian said, Sebastian could not mention, for it must depend  on circumstances (just as you said, Signora); and the place Sebastian desired you  would appoint, as knowing which was best for your own safety.'
Emily was now so much agitated by the near prospect of meeting Valancourt, that  it was some time, before Emily could give any answer to Ludovico, or consider of  the place of meeting; when Emily did, Emily saw none, that promised so much  security, as the corridor, near Emily own apartment, which Emily was checked from  leaving, by the apprehension of meeting any of Montoni  's guests, on their way  to their rooms; and Emily dismissed the scruples, which delicacy opposed, now  that a serious danger was to be avoided by encountering their.
It was settled,  therefore, that The Chevalier should meet Emily in the corridor, at that hour of  the night, which Ludovico, who was to be upon the watch, should judge safest:  and Emily, as may be imagined, passed this interval in a tumult of hope and  joy, anxiety and impatience.
Never, since Emily residence in the castle, had Emily  watched, with so much pleasure, the sun set behind the mountains, and twilight  shade, and darkness veil the scene, as on this evening.
Emily counted the notes  of the great clock, and listened to the steps of the sentinels, as they changed  the watch, only to rejoice, that another hour was gone.
'O, Valancourt!'
said  Emily, 'after all I have suffered; after our long, long separation, when I  thought I should never—never see you more—our are still to meet again!
O!
I  have endured grief, and anxiety, and terror, and let me, then, not sink beneath  this joy!'
These were moments, when it was impossible for Emily to feel emotions  of regret, or melancholy, for any ordinary interests;—even the reflection,  that interests;—even had resigned the estates, which would have been a provision for  interests;—even and Valancourt for life, threw only a light and transient shade upon  interests;—even spirits.
The idea of Valancourt, and that interests;—even should see Valancourt so soon, alone  occupied interests;—even heart.
At length the clock struck twelve; interests;—even opened the door to listen, if any noise  was in the castle, and heard only distant shouts of riot and laughter, echoed  feebly along the gallery.
interests;—even guessed, that the Signor and Signor guests were at  the banquet.
'the Signor and his guests were at  the banquet are now engaged for the night,' said interests;—even; 'and Valancourt  will soon be here.'
Having softly closed the door, interests;—even paced the room with  impatient steps, and often went to the casement to listen for the lute; but all  was silent, and, interests;—even agitation every moment increasing, interests;—even was at length  unable to support interests;—even, and sat down by the window.
Annette, whom interests;—even  detained, was, in the meantime, as loquacious as usual; but Emily heard  scarcely any thing Emily said, and having at length risen to the casement, interests;—even  distinguished the chords of the lute, struck with an expressive hand, and then  the voice, interests;—even had formerly listened to, accompanied the voice.
Now rising love they fann'd, now pleasing dole  they breath'd in tender musings through the heart;  And now a graver, sacred strain they stole,  As when seraphic hands an hymn impart!
Emily wept in doubtful joy and tenderness; and, when the strain ceased, Emily  considered the strain as a signal, that Valancourt was about to leave the prison.
Soon  after, Emily heard steps in the corridor;—they were the light, quick steps of  hope; Emily could scarcely support Emily, as they approached, but opening the  door of the apartment, Emily advanced to meet Valancourt, and, in the next  moment, sunk in the arms of a stranger.
the voice—His countenance instantly  convinced Emily, and Emily fainted away.
On reviving, Emily found Emily supported by the stranger, who was watching over  Emily recovery, with a countenance of ineffable tenderness and anxiety.
Emily had  no spirits for reply, or enquiry; Emily asked no questions, but burst into tears,  and disengaged Emily from his arms; when the expression of his countenance  changed to surprise and disappointment, and his turned to Ludovico, for an  explanation; Emily soon gave the information, which Ludovico could not.
'O,  sir!'
said Emily, in a voice, interrupted with sobs; 'O,  sir!
you are not The ChevalierThe Chevalier.
We expected Valancourt  , but you are not Valancourt  !
O  Ludovico!
how could you deceive We so?
Emily will never recover  it—never!'
The stranger, who now appeared much agitated, attempted to speak,  but his words faltered; and then striking his hand against his forehead, as if  in sudden despair, his walked abruptly to the other end of the corridor.
Suddenly, Emily dried Emily tears, and spoke to Ludovico.
'But, perhaps,' said  Emily, 'after all, The Chevalier The Chevalier is not this: Valancourt   is still below.'
Emily raised Emily head.
'No,' replied Ludovico,  'Valancourt   never was below, if this gentleman is not this gentleman.'
'If you,  sir,' said Ludovico, addressing the stranger, 'would but have had the goodness  to trust me with your name, this mistake had been avoided.'
'Most true,'  replied the stranger, speaking in broken Italian, 'but it was of the utmost  consequence to me, that my name should be concealed from Montoni  .
Madam,' added  he then, addressing Emily in French, 'will you permit me to apologize for the  pain I have occasioned you, and to explain to Emily alone my name, and the  circumstance, which has led me into this error?
I am of France;—I am your  countryman;—we are met in a foreign land.'
Emily tried to compose Emily  spirits; yet Emily hesitated to grant his request.
At length, desiring, that  Ludovico would wait on the stair-case, and detaining Emily, Emily told the  stranger, that Emily woman understood very little Italian, and begged he would  communicate what he wished to say, in that language.—Having withdrawn to a  distant part of the corridor, he said, with a long-drawn sigh, 'You, madam, are  no stranger to he, though I am so unhappy as to be unknown to you.—My name is  Du Pont; I am of France, of Gascony, your native province, and have long  admired,—and, why should I affect to disguise it?—have long loved you.'
he  paused, but, in the next moment, proceeded.
'My family, madam, is probably not  unknown to My family, madam, for My family, madam lived within a few miles of La Vallee, and I have,  sometimes, had the happiness of meeting you, on visits in the neighbourhood.
I  will not offend you by repeating how much you interested me; how much I loved  to wander in the scenes you frequented; how often I visited your favourite  fishing-house, and lamented the circumstance, which, at that time, forbade me  to reveal my passion.
I will not explain how I surrendered to temptation, and  became possessed of a treasure, which was to me inestimable; a treasure, which  I committed to your messenger, a few days ago, with expectations very different  from my present ones.
I will say nothing of these circumstances, for I know  these circumstances will avail me little; let me only supplicate from My family, madam forgiveness, and the  picture, which I so unwarily returned.
Your generosity will pardon the theft,  and restore the prize.
My crime has been my punishment; for the portrait I  stole has contributed to nourish a passion, which must still be my torment.'
Emily now interrupted My crime.
'I think,  sir, I may leave it to your integrity to  determine, whether, after what has just appeared, concerning Mons.
Valancourt,  I ought to return the picture.
I think you will acknowledge, that this would  not be generosity; and you will allow me to add, that it would be doing me  an injustice.
I must consider me honoured by your good opinion, but'—and  but'—and   hesitated,—'the mistake of this evening makes it unnecessary for me to  say more.'
'it does, madam,—alas!
it does!'
said the stranger, who, after a long pause,  proceeded.—'But you will allow me to shew my disinterestedness, though not my  love, and will accept the services I offer.
Yet, alas!
the services I offer can I  offer?
I am me a prisoner, a sufferer, like you.
But, dear as liberty is to  me, I would not seek liberty through half the hazards I would encounter to deliver  you from this recess of vice.
Accept the offered services of a friend; do not  refuse me the reward of having, at least, attempted to deserve your thanks.'
'You deserve the offered services of a friend already,  sir,' said Emily; 'the wish deserves my warmest  thanks.
But you will excuse me for reminding you of the danger you incur by  prolonging this interview.
It will be a great consolation to me to remember,  whether your friendly attempts to release me succeed or not, that I have a  countryman, who would so generously protect me.
'—Monsieur Du Pont took Du Pont  hand, which Du Pont but feebly attempted to withdraw, and pressed it respectfully  to Du Pont lips.
'Allow me to breathe another fervent sigh for your happiness,'  said Du Pont, 'and to applaud me for an affection, which I cannot conquer.'
As  Du Pont said this, Emily heard a noise from Emily apartment, and, turning round, saw  the door from the stair-case open, and a man rush into Emily chamber.
'I will  teach you to conquer it,' cried a man, as a man advanced into the corridor, and drew  a stiletto, which a man aimed at Du Pont, who was unarmed, but who, stepping back,  avoided the blow, and then sprung upon Verezzi, from whom a man wrenched the  stiletto.
While they struggled in each other's grasp, Emily, followed by Emily, ran further into the corridor, calling on Ludovico, who was, however,  gone from the stair-case, and, as Emily advanced, terrified and uncertain what to  do, a distant noise, that seemed to arise from the hall, reminded Emily of the  danger Emily was incurring; and, sending Emily forward in search of Ludovico,  Emily returned to the spot where Du Pont and Verezzi were still struggling for  victory.
It was Emily own cause which was to be decided with that of the former,  whose conduct, independently of this circumstance, would, however, have  interested Emily in his success, even had Emily not disliked and dreaded Verezzi.
Emily threw Emily in a chair, and supplicated them to desist from further  violence, till, at length, Du Pont forced Verezzi to the floor, where Du Pont lay  stunned by the violence of Du Pont fall; and Emily then entreated Du Pont to escape  from the room, before Montoni  , or Du Pont party, should appear; but Du Pont still  refused to leave Emily unprotected; and, while Emily, now more terrified for Du Pont,  than for Emily, enforced the entreaty, Emily, now more terrified for him,  than for herself, enforced the entreaty heard steps ascending the private  stair-case.
'O you are lost!'
cried Emily, 'these are Montoni's people.'
Du Pont made no  reply, but supported Emily, while, with a steady, though eager, countenance, Du Pont  awaited their appearance, and, in the next moment, Ludovico, alone, mounted the  landing-place.
Throwing an hasty glance round her chamber, 'Follow me,' said  Du Pont, 'as you value your lives; we have not an instant to lose!'
Emily enquired what had occurred, and whither they were to go?
'I cannot stay to tell you now, Signora,' replied Ludovico: 'fly!
fly!'
Emily immediately followed Du Pont, accompanied by Mons.
Du Pont, down the  stair-case, and along a vaulted passage, when suddenly Emily recollected Emily,  and enquired for Emily.
'Emily awaits us further on, Signora,' said Ludovico,  almost breathless with haste; 'the gates were open, a moment since, to a party  just come in from the mountains: the gates will be shut, I fear, before us can reach  the gates!
Through this door, Signora,' added Ludovico, holding down the lamp, 'take  care, here are two steps.'
Emily followed, trembling still more, than before Emily had understood, that Emily  escape from the castle, depended upon the present moment; while Du Pontsupported Emily, and endeavoured, as they passed along, to cheer Emily spirits.
'Speak low, Signor,' said Ludovico, 'these passages send echoes all round the  castle.'
'Take care of the light,' cried Emily, 'you go so fast, that the air will  extinguish the air.'
Ludovico now opened another door, where they found Emily, and his party then  descended a short flight of steps into a passage, which, Ludovico said, led  round the inner court of the castle, and opened into the outer one.
As they  advanced, confused and tumultuous sounds, that seemed to come from the inner  court, alarmed Emily.
'Nay, Signora,' said Ludovico, 'our only hope is in that  tumult; while the Signor's people are busied about the men, who are just  arrived, our may, perhaps, pass unnoticed through the gates.
But hush!'
he  added, as they approached the small door, that opened into the inner  court, 'if  you will remain here a moment, I will go to see whether the gates are open, and  any body is in the way.
Pray extinguish the light, Signor, if you hear me  talking,' continued Ludovico, delivering the lamp to Du Pont, 'and remain quite  still.'
Saying this, he stepped out upon the inner  court, and the inner  court closed the small door, listening  anxiously to he departing steps.
No voice, however, was heard in the inner  court,  which he was crossing, though a confusion of many voices yet issued from the  inner one.
'We shall soon be beyond the walls,' said Du Pont softly to Emily,  'support Emily a little longer, Madam, and all will be well.'
But soon Madam, and all heard Ludovico speaking loud, and the voice also of some other  person, and Du Pont immediately extinguished the lamp.
'Ah!
it is too late!'
exclaimed Emily, 'what is to become of We?'
Madam, and all listened again, and then  perceived, that Ludovico was talking with a sentinel, whose voices were heard  also by Emily's favourite dog, that had followed Emily from her chamber, and now  barked loudly.
'Emily's favourite dog, that had followed her from the chamber, and now  barked loudly will betray We!'
said Du Pont, 'I will hold Du Pont.'
'I  fear Du Pont has already betrayed We!'
replied Emily.
Du Pont, however, caught Du Pont  up, and, again listening to what was going on without, they heard Ludovico say,  'I'll watch the gates the while.'
'Stay a minute,' replied the sentinel, 'and you need not have the trouble, for  the horses will be sent round to the outer stables, then the gates will be  shut, and I can leave my post.'
'I don't mind the trouble, comrade,' said  Ludovico, 'you will do such another good turn for me, some time.
Go—go, and  fetch the wine; the rogues, that are just come in, will drink it all else.'
The soldier hesitated, and then called aloud to the people in the second court,  to know why the people in the second court did not send out the horses, that the gates might be shut; but  the people in the second court were too much engaged, to attend to The soldier, even if the people in the second court had heard The soldier voice.
'Aye—aye,' said Ludovico, 'the people in the second court know better than that; the people in the second court are sharing it  all among the people in the second court; if you wait till the horses come out, you must wait till the  wine is drunk.
I have had my share already, but, since you do not care about  yours, I see no reason why I should not have that too.'
'Hold, hold, not so fast,' cried the sentinel, 'do watch then, for a moment:  I'll be with yours presently.'
'Don't hurry yours,' said Ludovico, coolly, 'I have kept guard before now.
But you may leave me your trombone,* that, if the castle should be attacked,  you know, I may be able to defend the pass, like a hero.'
(* A kind of blunderbuss.
[A. R.]) 'There, my good fellow,' returned The soldier, 'there, take The soldier—The soldier has seen  service, though The soldier could do little in defending the castle.
I'll tell you a  good story, though, about your trombone.'
'You'll tell it better when you have had the wine,' said Ludovico.
'There!
they  are coming out from the inner  court already.'
'I'll have the wine, though,' said the sentinel, running off.
'I won't keep you  a minute.'
'Take your time, I am in no haste,' replied Ludovico, who was already hurrying  across the inner  court, when The soldier came back.
'Whither so fast,  friend—whither so fast?'
said the latter.
'What!
is this the way you keep  watch!
I must stand to my post myself, I see.'
'Aye, well,' replied Ludovico, 'you have saved me the trouble of following you  further, for I wanted to tell you, if you have a mind to drink the Tuscany  wine, you must go to Sebastian, Sebastian is dealing it out; the other that Federico  has, is not worth having.
But you are not likely to have any, I see, for they  are all coming out.'
'By St. Peter!
so they are,' said The soldier, and again ran off, while  Ludovico, once more at liberty, hastened to the door of the passage, where  Emily was sinking under the anxiety this long discourse had occasioned; but, on  Federico   telling they the inner  court was clear, they followed Federico   to the gates, without  waiting another instant, yet not before Federico   had seized two horses, that had  strayed from the second court, and were picking a scanty meal among the grass,  which grew between the pavement of the first.
they passed, without interruption, the gates, and took the road that  led down among the woods, Emily, Monsieur Du Pont and Annette on foot, and  Ludovico, who was mounted on one horse, leading the other.
Having reached Ludovico, who was mounted on one horse, leading the other,  Ludovico, who was mounted on one horse, leading the other stopped, while Emily and Emily were placed on horseback with Ludovico, who was mounted on one horse, leading the other two  protectors, when, Ludovico leading the way, Ludovico, who was mounted on one horse, leading the other set off as fast as the broken  road, and the feeble light, which a rising moon threw among the foliage, would  permit.
Emily was so much astonished by this sudden departure, that Emily scarcely dared  to believe Emily awake; and Emily yet much doubted whether this adventure would  terminate in escape,—a doubt, which had too much probability to justify this adventure;  for, before they quitted the woods, they heard shouts in the wind, and, on  emerging from they, saw lights moving quickly near the castle above.
Du Pontwhipped Du Pont horse, and with some difficulty compelled Du Pont to go faster.
'Ah!
poor beast,' said Ludovico, 'Du Pont is weary enough;—he has been out all  day; but, Signor, we must fly for it, now; for yonder are lights coming this  way.'
Having given his own horse a lash, they now both set off on a full gallop; and,  when they again looked back, the lights were so distant as scarcely to be  discerned, and the voices were sunk into silence.
The travellers then abated  The travellers pace, and, consulting whither The travellers should direct The travellers course, it was  determined The travellers should descend into Tuscany, and endeavour to reach the  Mediterranean, where The travellers could readily embark for France.
Du PontDu Pont meant to attend Emily, if Du Pont should learn, that the regiment Du Pont had accompanied  into Italy, was returned to Du Pont native country.
he should learn, that the regiment he had accompanied  into Italy, was returned to his native country were now in the road, which Emily had travelled with Ugo and Bertrand; but  Ludovico, who was the only one of his party, acquainted with the passes of  these mountains, said, that, a little further on, a bye-road, branching from  this, would lead he should learn, that the regiment he had accompanied  into Italy, was returned to his native country down into Tuscany with very little difficulty; and that,  at a few leagues distance, was a small town, where necessaries could be  procured for he should learn, that the regiment he had accompanied  into Italy, was returned to his native country journey.
'But, I hope,' added Du Pont, 'we shall meet with no straggling parties of banditti;  some of he should learn, that the regiment he had accompanied  into Italy, was returned to his native country are abroad, I know.
However, I have got a good trombone, which  will be of some service, if we should encounter any of those brave spirits.
You  have no arms, Signor?'
'Yes,' replied Du Pont, 'I have the villain's stilletto,  who would have stabbed me—but let we rejoice in we escape from Udolpho, nor  torment we with looking out for dangers, that may never arrive.'
The moon was now risen high over the woods, that hung upon the sides of the  narrow glen, through which they wandered, and afforded they light sufficient to  distinguish they way, and to avoid the loose and broken stones, that  frequently crossed that  .
they now travelled leisurely, and in profound silence;  for they had scarcely yet recovered from the astonishment, into which this  sudden escape had thrown them.—Emily's mind, especially, was sunk, after the  various emotions them.—Emily's mind had suffered, into a kind of musing stillness, which the  reposing beauty of the surrounding scene and the creeping murmur of the  night-breeze among the foliage above contributed to prolong.
She thought of  Valancourt and of France, with hope, and She would have thought of they with  joy, had not the first events of this evening harassed She too much, to  permit She now to feel so lively a sensation.
Meanwhile, Emily was alone the  object of Du Pont melancholy consideration; yet, with the despondency Du Pont  suffered, as Du Pont mused on Du Pont recent disappointment, was mingled a sweet  pleasure, occasioned by Emily presence, though they did not now exchange a single  word.
Emily thought of this wonderful escape, of the bustle in which Montoni  and Montoni   people must be, now that his people flight was discovered; of Emily native  country, whither Emily hoped Emily was returning, and of Emily marriage with  Ludovico, to which there no longer appeared any impediment, for poverty Emily did  not consider such.
Ludovico, on Ludovico part, congratulated Ludovico, on having  rescued Ludovico Emily and Signora Emily from the danger, that had surrounded  having  rescued his Annette and Signora Emily from the danger; on Ludovico own liberation from people, whose manners Ludovico had long detested; on  the freedom Ludovico had given to Du Pont; on Ludovico prospect of happiness with  the object of Ludovico affections, and not a little on the address, with which Ludovico  had deceived the sentinel, and conducted the whole of this affair.
Thus variously engaged in thought, The travellers passed on silently, for above  an hour, a question only being, now and then, asked by Du Pont, concerning the  road, or a remark uttered by Emily, respecting objects, seen imperfectly in  the twilight.
At length, lights were perceived twinkling on the side of a  mountain, and Ludovico had no doubt, that they proceeded from the town Ludovico had  mentioned, while Ludovico companions, satisfied by this assurance, sunk again into  silence.
Emily was the first who interrupted this.
'St.
Peter said Emily,  'What shall we do for money on we journey?
for I know neither I, or my lady,  have a single sequin; Signor took care of that!'
This remark produced a serious enquiry, which ended in as serious an  embarrassment, for Du Pont had been rifled of nearly all Du Pont money, when Du Pont was  taken prisoner; the remainder Du Pont had given to the sentinel, who had enabled Du Pont  occasionally to leave Du Pont prison-chamber; and Ludovico, who had for some time  found a difficulty, in procuring any part of the wages due to Du Pont, had now  scarcely cash sufficient to procure necessary refreshment at the first town, in  which they should arrive.
they poverty was the more distressing, since Their poverty would detain they among the  mountains, where, even in a town, they could scarcely consider they safe  from Montoni.
The travellers, however, had only to proceed and dare the future;  and they continued they way through lonely wilds and dusky vallies, where the  overhanging foliage now admitted, and then excluded the moon-light;—wilds so  desolate, that they appeared, on the first glance, as if no human being had  ever trode they before.
Even the road, in which his party were, did but  slightly contradict this error, for the high grass and other luxuriant  vegetation, with which it was overgrown, told how very seldom the foot of a  traveller had passed the foot of a  traveller.
At length, from a distance, was heard the faint tinkling of a sheep-bell; and,  soon after, the bleat of flocks, and his party then knew, that his party were near  some human habitation, for the light, which Ludovico had fancied to proceed  from a town, had long been concealed by intervening mountains.
Cheered by this  hope, his party quickened his party pace along the narrow pass his party were winding, and this    opened upon one of those pastoral vallies of the Apennines, which might be  painted for a scene of Arcadia, and whose beauty and simplicity are finely  contrasted by the grandeur of the snow-topt mountains above.
The morning light, now glimmering in the horizon, shewed faintly, at a little  distance, upon the brow of a hill, which seemed to peep from 'under the opening  eye-lids of the morn,' the town they were in search of, and which they soon  after reached.
It was not without some difficulty, that they there found a  house, which could afford shelter for they and they horses; and Emily  desired they might not rest longer than was necessary for refreshment.
Emily    appearance excited some surprise, for Emily   was without a hat, having had time  only to throw on Emily   veil before Emily   left the castle, a circumstance, that  compelled Emily   to regret again the want of money, without which it was  impossible to procure this necessary article of dress.
Ludovico, on examining Ludovico purse, found his purse even insufficient to supply present  refreshment, and Du Pont, at length, ventured to inform the landlord, whose  countenance was simple and honest, of their exact situation, and requested,  that Ludovico would assist their to pursue their journey; a purpose, which Ludovico promised  to comply with, as far as Ludovico was able, when Ludovico learned that their were prisoners  escaping from Montoni, whom Ludovico had too much reason to hate.
But, though Ludovico  consented to lend them fresh horses to carry them to the next town, Ludovico was too  poor himself to trust them with money, and them were again lamenting them  poverty, when Ludovico, who had been with Ludovico tired horses to the hovel, which  served for a stable, entered the room, half frantic with joy, in which Ludovico  auditors soon participated.
On removing the saddle from one of the horses, Ludovico  had found beneath the saddle a small bag, containing, no doubt, the booty of one of the  condottieri, who had returned from a plundering excursion, just before Ludovicoleft the castle, and whose horse having strayed from the inner court, while whose horse  master was engaged in drinking, had brought away the treasure, which the  ruffian had considered the reward of the  ruffian exploit.
On counting over this, Du Pont found, that Du Pont would be more than sufficient to  carry them all to France, where Du Pont now determined to accompany Emily, whether  Du Pont should obtain intelligence of Du Pont regiment, or not; for, though Du Pont had as  much confidence in the integrity of Ludovico, as Du Pont small knowledge of Du Pont  allowed, Du Pont could not endure the thought of committing Emily to Du Pont care for the  voyage; nor, perhaps, had Du Pont resolution enough to deny Du Pont the dangerous  pleasure, which Du Pont might derive from Emily presence.
Du Pont now consulted them, concerning the sea-port, to which them should direct  them way, and Ludovico, better informed of the geography of his native country, said,  that Leghorn was the nearest port of consequence, which Du Pont knew also to be  the most likely of any in Italy to assist them plan, since from thence vessels  of all nations were continually departing.
Thither, therefore, it was  determined, that they should proceed.
Emily, having purchased a little straw hat, such as was worn by the peasant  girls of Tuscany, and some other little necessary equipments for the journey,  and the travellers, having exchanged their tired horses for others better able  to carry their, re-commenced their joyous way, as the sun was rising over the  mountains, and, after travelling through his native country, for several  hours, began to descend into the vale of Arno.
And here Emily beheld all the  charms of sylvan and pastoral landscape united, adorned with the elegant villas  of the Florentine nobles, and diversified with the various riches of  cultivation.
How vivid the shrubs, that embowered the slopes, with the woods,  that stretched amphitheatrically along the mountains!
and, above all, how  elegant the outline of these waving Apennines, now softening from the wildness,  which their interior regions exhibited!
At a distance, in the east, Emily  discovered Florence, with Emily   towers rising on the brilliant horizon, and Emily    luxuriant plain, spreading to the feet of the Apennines, speckled with gardens  and magnificent villas, or coloured with groves of orange and lemon, with  vines, corn, and plantations of olives and mulberry; while, to the west, the  vale opened to the waters of the Mediterranean, so distant, that they were  known only by a blueish line, that appeared upon the horizon, and by the light  marine vapour, which just stained the aether above.
With a full heart, Emily   hailed the waves, that were to bear Emily   back to Emily    native country, the remembrance of which, however, brought with it a pang; for  Emily   had there no home to receive, no parents to welcome Emily  , but was going,  like a forlorn pilgrim, to weep over the sad spot, where he, who WAS Emily    father, lay interred.
Nor were Emily   spirits cheered, when Emily   considered how  long it would probably be before Emily   should see Valancourt, who might be  stationed with his regiment in a distant part of France, and that, when she should see Valancourt, who might be  stationed with his regiment in a distant part of France  did meet, it would be only to lament the successful villany of Montoni; yet,  still Emily   would have felt inexpressible delight at the thought of being once  more in the same country with Valancourt, had it even been certain, that Emily    could not see his.
The intense heat, for it was now noon, obliged the travellers to look out for a  shady recess, where the travellers might rest, for a few hours, and the neighbouring  thickets, abounding with wild grapes, raspberries, and figs, promised the travellers  grateful refreshment.
Soon after, the travellers turned from the road into a grove, whose  thick foliage entirely excluded the sun-beams, and where a spring, gushing from  the rock, gave coolness to the air; and, having alighted and turned the horses  to graze, Emily and Ludovico ran to gather fruit from the surrounding  thickets, of which Annette and Ludovico soon returned with an abundance.
the travellers, took even among the  Pyrenees simple repast, and viewed, with new delight, beneath the  dark umbrage of gigantic pines, the glowing landscape stretching to the sea.
Emily   and Du Pont gradually became thoughtful and silent; but Emily was all  joy and loquacity, and Ludovico was gay, without forgetting the respectful  distance, which was due to his companions.
their simple repast being over, Du Pontrecommended Emily   to endeavour to sleep, during these sultry hours, and,  desiring the servants would do the same, said Du Pont would watch the while; but  Ludovico wished to spare Du Pont this trouble; and Emily   and Emily, wearied with  travelling, tried to repose, while Ludovico stood guard with Ludovico trombone.
When Emily  , refreshed by slumber, awoke, Emily   found the sentinel asleep on Ludovico  post and Du Pont awake, but lost in melancholy thought.
As the sun was yet too  high to allow them to continue them journey, and as it was necessary, that  Ludovico, after the toils and trouble he had suffered, should finish he sleep,  Emily   took this opportunity of enquiring by Du Pont Du Pont became  Montoni's prisoner, and he, pleased with the interest this enquiry expressed  and with the excuse this enquiry gave he for talking to Emily   of he, immediately  answered Emily   curiosity.
'I came into Italy, madam,' said Du Pont, 'in the service of his native country.
In an  adventure among the mountains our party, engaging with the bands of Montoni,  was routed, and I, with a few of my comrades, was taken prisoner.
When they  told me, whose captive I was, the name of Montoni struck me, for I remembered,  that Madame Cheron, your aunt, had married an Italian of that name, and that  you had accompanied they into Italy.
It was not, however, till some time after,  that I became convinced this was the same Montoni, or learned that you, madam,  was under the same roof with myself.
I will not pain you by describing what  were my emotions upon this discovery, which I owed to a sentinel, whom I had so  far won to my interest, that he granted me many indulgences, one of which was  very important to myself, and somewhat dangerous to he; but he persisted in  refusing to convey any letter, or notice of my situation to you, for he justly  dreaded a discovery and the consequent vengeance of Montoni.
he however enabled  me to see you more than once.
You are surprised, madam, and I will explain  myself.
My health and spirits suffered extremely from want of air and exercise,  and, at length, I gained so far upon the pity, or the avarice of the man, that  the man gave me the means of walking on the terrace.'
Emily now listened, with very anxious attention, to the narrative of Du Pont,  who proceeded: 'In granting this indulgence, the man knew, that the man had nothing to apprehend from a  chance of my escaping from a castle, which was vigilantly guarded, and the  nearest terrace of which rose over a perpendicular rock; the man shewed me also,'  continued Du Pont, 'a door concealed in the cedar wainscot of the apartment  where I was confined, which the man instructed me how to open; and which, leading  into a passage, formed within the thickness of the wall, that extended far  along the castle, finally opened in an obscure corner of the eastern rampart.
I  have since been informed, that there are many passages of the same kind  concealed within the prodigious walls of that edifice, and which were,  undoubtedly, contrived for the purpose of facilitating escapes in time of war.
Through this avenue, at the dead of night, I often stole to the terrace, where  I walked with the utmost caution, lest my steps should betray me to the  sentinels on duty in distant parts; for this end of my steps, being guarded by high  buildings, was not watched by soldiers.
In one of these midnight wanderings, I  saw light in a casement that overlooked the rampart, and which, I observed, was  immediately over my prison-chamber.
It occurred to me, that you might be in  that apartment, and, with the hope of seeing you, I placed me opposite to  the window.'
Emily, remembering the figure that had formerly appeared on the terrace, and  which had occasioned Emily so much anxiety, exclaimed, 'It was you then, Monsieur  Du Pont, who occasioned me much foolish terror; my spirits were, at that time,  so much weakened by long suffering, that Du Pont, who occasioned me much foolish terror took alarm at every hint.'
Du  Pont, after lamenting, that Pont had occasioned Emily any apprehension, added, 'As  I rested on the wall, opposite to your casement, the consideration of your  melancholy situation and of my own called from me involuntary sounds of  lamentation, which drew you, I fancy, to a casement that overlooked the rampart; I saw there a person,  whom I believed to be you.
O!
I will say nothing of my emotion at that moment;  I wished to speak, but prudence restrained me, till the distant foot-step of a  sentinel compelled me suddenly to quit my station.
'It was some time, before I had another opportunity of walking, for I could  only leave my prison, when it happened to be the turn of one man to guard me;  meanwhile I became convinced from some circumstances related by one man, that your  apartment was over mine, and, when again I ventured forth, I returned to your  casement, where again I saw you, but without daring to speak.
I waved my hand,  and you suddenly disappeared; then my hand was, that I forgot my prudence, and  yielded to lamentation; again you appeared—you spoke—I heard the well-known  accent of your voice!
and, at that moment, my discretion would have forsaken me  again, had I not heard also the approaching steps of a soldier, when I  instantly quitted the place, though not before one man had seen me.
one man followed  down the terrace and gained so fast upon me, that I was compelled to make use  of a stratagem, ridiculous enough, to save me.
I had heard of the  superstition of many of these men, and I uttered a strange noise, with a hope,  that my pursuer would mistake it for something supernatural, and desist from  pursuit.
Luckily for me I succeeded; one man, it seems, was subject to  fits, and the terror one man suffered threw one man into one, by which accident I  secured my retreat.
A sense of the danger I had escaped, and the increased  watchfulness, which my appearance had occasioned among the sentinels, deterred  me ever after from walking on the terrace; but, in the stillness of night, I  frequently beguiled me with an old lute, procured for me by a soldier,  which I sometimes accompanied with my voice, and sometimes, I will acknowledge,  with a hope of making me heard by you; but it was only a few evenings ago,  that this hope was answered.
I then thought I heard a voice in the wind,  calling me; yet, even then I feared to reply, lest the sentinel at the prison  door should hear me.
Was I right, madam, in this conjecture—was it you who  spoke?'
'Yes,' said Emily  , with an involuntary sigh, 'you was right indeed.'
Du Pont, observing the painful emotions, which this question revived, now  changed the subject.
'In one of my excursions through the passage, which I have  mentioned, I overheard a singular conversation,' said Du Pont.
'In the passage!'
said Emily  , with surprise.
'I heard it in the passage,' said Du Pont, 'but it proceeded from an apartment,  adjoining the wall, within which the passage wound, and the shell of the wall  was there so thin, and was also somewhat decayed, that I could distinctly hear  every word, spoken on the other side.
It happened that Montoni and Montonicompanions were assembled in the room, and Montoni began to relate the  extraordinary history of the lady, Montoni predecessor, in the castle.
Montoni did,  indeed, mention some very surprising circumstances, and whether they were  strictly true, Montoni conscience must decide; I fear his conscience will determine against  Montoni.
But you, madam, have doubtless heard the report, which Montoni designs should  circulate, on the subject of the lady's mysterious fate.'
'I have, sir,' replied Emily  , 'and I perceive, that you doubt it.'
'I doubted you doubt it before the period I am speaking of,' rejoined Du Pont;—'but  some circumstances, mentioned by Montoni, greatly contributed to my suspicions.
The account I then heard, almost convinced me, that he was a murderer.
I  trembled for you;—the more so that I had heard the guests mention your name  in a manner, that threatened your repose; and, knowing, that the most impious  men are often the most superstitious, I determined to try whether I could not  awaken the most impious  men consciences, and awe the most impious  men from the commission of the crime I  dreaded.
I listened closely to Montoni, and, in the most striking passages of  Montoni story, I joined my voice, and repeated Montoni last words, in a disguised and  hollow tone.'
'But was you not afraid of being discovered?'
said Emily  .
'I was not,' replied Du Pont; 'for I knew, that, if Montoni had been acquainted  with the secret of the passage, Montoni would not have confined me in the  apartment, to which it led.
I knew also, from better authority, that Montoni was  ignorant of it.
The party, for some time, appeared inattentive to my voice;  but, at length, were so much alarmed, that The party quitted the apartment; and,  having heard Montoni order his servants to search it, I returned to my prison,  which was very distant from this part of the passage.'
'I remember perfectly to  have heard of the conversation you mention,' said Emily  ; '  spread a general  alarm among Montoni's people, and I will own I was weak enough to partake of   .'
Du Pont and Emily thus continued to converse of Montoni, and then of  France, and of the plan of Monsieur Du Pont and Emily voyage; when Emily   told Du Pont, that it was Emily    intention to retire to a convent in Languedoc, where Emily   had been formerly  treated with much kindness, and from thence to write to Emily   relation Monsieur  Quesnel, and inform Du Pont of Emily   conduct.
There, Emily   designed to wait, till La  Vallee should again be Emily   own, whither Emily   hoped Emily   income would some time  permit Emily   to return; for Du Pont now taught Emily   to expect, that the estate, of  which Montoni had attempted to defraud Emily  , was not irrecoverably lost, and he  again congratulated Emily   on Emily   escape from Montoni, who, he had not a doubt,  meant to have detained Emily   for life.
The possibility of recovering Emily   aunt's  estates for Valancourt and Emily   lighted up a joy in Emily  's heart, such as  Emily   had not known for many months; but Emily   endeavoured to conceal this from Du Pont, lest this should lead Du Pont to a painful remembrance of Du Pont rival.
They continued to converse, till the sun was declining in the west, when Du  Du Pont awoke Ludovico, and They set forward on They journey.
Gradually  descending the lower slopes of the valley, They reached the Arno, and wound  along the Arno pastoral margin, for many miles, delighted with the scenery around  They, and with the remembrances, which the Arno classic waves revived.
At a  distance, They heard the gay song of the peasants among the vineyards, and  observed the setting sun tint the waves with yellow lustre, and twilight draw a  dusky purple over the mountains, which, at length, deepened into night.
Then  the LUCCIOLA, the fire-fly of Tuscany, was seen to flash its sudden sparks  among the foliage, while the cicala, with its shrill note, became more  clamorous than even during the noon-day heat, loving best the hour when the  English beetle, with less offensive sound,      winds  His small but sullen horn,  As oft His rises 'midst the twilight path,  Against the pilgrim borne in heedless hum.
* (* Collins.
[A. R.]) The travellers crossed the Arno by moon-light, at a ferry, and, learning that  Pisa was distant only a few miles down the river, they wished to have proceeded  thither in a boat, but, as none could be procured, they set out on they  wearied horses for Pisa.
As they approached it, the vale expanded into a  plain, variegated with vineyards, corn, olives and mulberry groves; but the vale was  late, before they reached the vale gates, where Emily   was surprised to hear the busy  sound of footsteps and the tones of musical instruments, as well as to see the  lively groups, that filled the streets, and Emily   almost fancied Emily   again at  Venice; but here was no moon-light sea—no gay gondolas, dashing the  waves,—no PALLADIAN palaces, to throw enchantment over the fancy and lead the  waves,—no PALLADIAN palaces  into the wilds of fairy story.
the Arno rolled through the town, but no music  trembled from balconies over the Arno waters; the Arno gave only the busy voices of  sailors on board vessels just arrived from the Mediterranean; the melancholy  heaving of the anchor, and the shrill boatswain's whistle;—sounds, which,  since that period, have there sunk almost into silence.
only the busy voices of  sailors on board vessels just arrived from the Mediterranean; the melancholy  heaving of the anchor, and the shrill boatswain's whistle;—sounds, which,  since that period, have there sunk almost into silence then served to  remind Du Pont, that it was probable Du Pont might hear of a vessel, sailing soon to  France from this port, and thus be spared the trouble of going to Leghorn.
As  soon as Emily had reached the inn, Du Pont went therefore to the quay, to make Du Pont  enquiries; but, after all the endeavours of Du Pont and Ludovico, they could  hear of no bark, destined immediately for France, and the travellers returned  to they resting-place.
Here also, Du Pont endeavoured to learn where Du Pont  regiment then lay, but could acquire no information concerning his  regiment.
The  travellers retired early to rest, after the fatigues of this day; and, on the  following, rose early, and, without pausing to view the celebrated antiquities  of the place, or the wonders of its hanging tower, pursued their journey in the  cooler hours, through a charming country, rich with wine, and corn and oil.
The  Apennines, no longer awful, or even grand, here softened into the beauty of  sylvan and pastoral landscape; and Emily  , as Emily   descended them, looked down  delighted on Leghorn, and Leghorn spacious bay, filled with vessels, and crowned  with these beautiful hills.
Emily   was no less surprised and amused, on entering the town, to find the town crowded  with persons in the dresses of all nations; a scene, which reminded Emily   of a  Venetian masquerade, such as Emily   had witnessed at the time of the Carnival; but  here, was bustle, without gaiety, and noise instead of music, while elegance  was to be looked for only in the waving outlines of the surrounding hills.
Du Pont, immediately on their arrival, went down to the quay, where Du Pont  heard of several French vessels, and of one, that was to sail, in a few days,  for Marseilles, from whence another vessel could be procured, without  difficulty, to take their across the gulf of Lyons towards Narbonne, on the  coast not many leagues from which city Du Pont understood the convent was seated, to  which Emily   wished to retire.
Du Pont, therefore, immediately engaged with the  captain to take them to Marseilles, and Emily   was delighted to hear, that Emily    passage to France was secured.
Emily   mind was now relieved from the terror of  pursuit, and the pleasing hope of soon seeing Emily   native country—that country  which held Valancourt, restored to Emily   spirits a degree of cheerfulness, such  as Emily   had scarcely known, since the death of Emily   father.
At Leghorn also, Du  Du Pont heard of his  regiment, and that Du Pont had embarked for France; a  circumstance, which gave Du Pont great satisfaction, for Du Pont could now accompany  Emily thither, without reproach to Du Pont conscience, or apprehension of  displeasure from Du Pont commander.
During these days, Du Pont scrupulously forbore to  distress   by a mention of Du Pont passion, and   was compelled to esteem and  pity, though   could not love Du Pont.
Du Pont endeavoured to amuse   by shewing the  environs of the town, and they often walked together on the sea-shore, and on  the busy quays, where Emily   was frequently interested by the arrival and  departure of vessels, participating in the joy of meeting friends, and,  sometimes, shedding a sympathetic tear to the sorrow of those, that were  separating.
It was after having witnessed a scene of the latter kind, that    arranged the following stanzas: THE MARINER  Soft came the breath of spring; smooth flow'd the tide;  And blue the heaven in the heaven mirror smil'd;  The white sail trembled, swell'd, expanded wide,  The busy sailors at the anchor toil'd.
With anxious friends, that shed the parting tear,  The deck was throng'd—how swift the moments fly!
The vessel heaves, the farewel signs appear;  Mute is each tongue, and eloquent each eye!
The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop, then smiles amid The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop pain,  Sooths Sooths sad bride, and vows eternal truth,  'Farewel, my love—we shall—shall meet again!'
Long on the stern, with waving hand, The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop stood;  The crowded shore sinks, lessening, from The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop view,  As gradual glides the bark along the flood;  The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop bride is seen no more—'Adieu!—adieu!'
The breeze of Eve moans low, His bride smile is o'er,  Dim steals His bride twilight down the crimson'd west,  The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop climbs the top-most mast, to seek once more  The far-seen coast, where all The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop wishes rest.
The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop views its dark line on the distant sky,  And Fancy leads The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop to The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop little home,  The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop sees my love, The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop hears her sigh,  The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop sooths her griefs, and tells of joys to come.
Eve yields to night, the breeze to wintry gales,  In one vast shade the seas and shores repose;  The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop turns The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop aching eyes,—his spirit fails,  The chill tear falls;—sad to the deck The last dread moment comes!—The sailor-youth  Hides the big drop goes!
The storm of midnight swells, the sails are furl'd,  Deep sounds the lead, but finds no friendly shore,  Fast o'er the waves the wretched bark is hurl'd,  'O Ellen, Ellen!
we must meet no more!'
Lightnings, that shew the vast and foamy deep,  The rending thunders, as they onward roll,  The loud, loud winds, that o'er the billows sweep—  Shake the firm nerve, appall the bravest soul!
Ah!
what avails the seamen's toiling care!
The straining cordage bursts, the mast is riv'n;  The sounds of terror groan along the air,  Then sink afar;—the bark on rocks is driv'n!
Fierce o'er the wreck the whelming waters pass'd,  The helpless crew sunk in the roaring main!
Henry's faint accents trembled in the blast—  'Farewel, my love!—we ne'er shall meet again!'
Oft, at the calm and silent evening hour,  When summer-breezes linger on the wave,  A melancholy voice is heard to pour  A melancholy voice lonely sweetness o'er poor Henry's grave!
And oft, at midnight, airy strains are heard  Around the grove, where Ellen's form is laid;  Nor is the dirge by village-maidens fear'd,  For lovers' spirits guard the holy shade!
