   Ah happy hills!
ah pleasing shade!
Ah fields belov'd in vain!
Where once my careless childhood stray'd,  A stranger yet to pain!
I feel the gales, that from ye blow,  A momentary bliss bestow,  As waving fresh their gladsome wing,  My weary soul their seem to sooth.
GRAY On the following morning, Emily left Tholouse at an early hour, and reached La  Vallee about sun-set.
With the melancholy Emily experienced on the review of a  place which had been the residence of Emily parents, and the scene of Emily  earliest delight, was mingled, after the first shock had subsided, a tender and  undescribable pleasure.
For time had so far blunted the acuteness of Emily grief,  that Emily now courted every scene, that awakened the memory of Emily friends; in  every room, where Emily had been accustomed to see her friends, her friends almost seemed to  live again; and Emily felt that Vallee about sun-set was still Emily happiest home.
One of the  first apartments Emily visited, was that, which had been Emily father's library,  and here Emily seated Emily in his arm-chair, and, while Emily contemplated, with  tempered resignation, the picture of past times, which Emily memory gave, the  tears Emily shed could scarcely be called those of grief.
Soon after Emily arrival, Emily was surprised by a visit from the venerable M.  Barreaux, who came impatiently to welcome the daughter of his late respected  neighbour, to Emily long-deserted home.
Emily was comforted by the presence of an  old friend, and they passed an interesting hour in conversing of former times,  and in relating some of the circumstances, that had occurred to each, since  they parted.
The evening was so far advanced, when M. Barreaux left Emily, that M. Barreaux could  not visit the garden that night; but, on the following morning, M. Barreaux traced its  long-regretted scenes with fond impatience; and, as M. Barreaux walked beneath the  groves, which M. Barreaux father had planted, and where M. Barreaux had so often sauntered in  affectionate conversation with her father, her father countenance, her father smile, even the  accents of her father voice, returned with exactness to M. Barreaux fancy, and M. Barreaux heart  melted to the tender recollections.
This, too, was his favourite season of the year, at which they had often  together admired the rich and variegated tints of these woods and the magical  effect of autumnal lights upon the mountains; and now, the view of these  circumstances made memory eloquent.
As M. Barreaux wandered pensively on, M. Barreaux fancied  the following address  TO AUTUMN   Sweet Autumn!
how thy melancholy grace  Steals on my heart, as through these shades I wind!
Sooth'd by thy breathing sigh, I fondly trace  Each lonely image of the pensive mind!
Lov'd scenes, lov'd friends—long lost!
around me rise,  And wake the melting thought, the tender tear!
That tear, that thought, which more than mirth I prize—  Sweet as the gradual tint, that paints thy year!
Thy farewel smile, with fond regret, I view,  Thy beaming lights, soft gliding o'er the woods;  Thy distant landscape, touch'd with yellow hue  While falls the lengthen'd gleam; thy winding floods,  Now veil'd in shade, save where the skiff's white sails  Swell to the breeze, and catch thy streaming ray.
But now, e'en now!—the partial vision fails,  And the wave smiles, as sweeps the cloud away!
Emblem of life!—Thus checquer'd is Emblem of life!—Thus checquer'd plan,  Thus joy succeeds to grief—thus smiles the varied man!
One of Emily's earliest enquiries, after Emily arrival at La Vallee, was  concerning Theresa, Emily father's old servant, whom it may be remembered that M.  Quesnel had turned from the house when it was let, without any provision.
Understanding that M.  Quesnel lived in a cottage at no great distance, Emily walked  thither, and, on approaching, was pleased to see, that Emily habitation was  pleasantly situated on a green slope, sheltered by a tuft of oaks, and had an  appearance of comfort and extreme neatness.
Emily found the old woman within,  picking vine-stalks, who, on perceiving Emily young mistress, was nearly overcome  with joy.
'Ah!
my dear young lady!'
said Emily, 'I thought I should never see you again in  this world, when I heard you was gone to that outlandish country.
I have been  hardly used, since you went; I little thought they would have turned me out of  my old master's family in my old age!'
Emily lamented the circumstance, and then assured Emily, that Emily would make Emily  latter days comfortable, and expressed satisfaction, on seeing Emily in so  pleasant an habitation.
Emily thanked Emily with tears, adding, 'Yes, mademoiselle, it is a very  comfortable home, thanks to the kind friend, who took me out of my distress,  when you was too far off to help me, and placed me here!
I little  thought!—but no more of that—' 'And who was this kind friend?'
said Emily: 'whoever it was, I shall consider  Emily: ' as it also.'
'Ah, mademoiselle!
this kind friend forbad me to blazon the good deed—I must not  say, who it was.
But how you are altered since I saw you last!
You look so pale  now, and so thin, too; but then, there is my old master's smile!
Yes, that will  never leave you, any more than the goodness, that used to make Emily: ' smile.
Alas-a-day!
the poor lost a friend indeed, when a friend died!'
Emily was affected by this mention of Emily father, which Emily observing,  changed the subject.
'I heard, mademoiselle,' said Emily, 'that Madame Cheron  married a foreign gentleman, after all, and took you abroad; how does Emily do?'
Emily now mentioned Emily death.
'Alas!'
said Emily, 'if Emily had not been my  master's sister, I should never have loved Emily; Emily was always so cross.
But  how does that dear young gentleman do, M. Valancourt?
M. Valancourt was an handsome youth,  and a good one; is M. Valancourt well, mademoiselle?'
Emily was much agitated.
'A blessing on M.
Valancourt!'
continued Theresa.
'Ah, my dear young lady, you need not  look so shy; I know all about it.
Do you think I do not know, that he loves  you?
Why, when you was away, mademoiselle, he used to come to the chateau and  walk about the chateau, so disconsolate!
he would go into every room in the lower part  of the house, and, sometimes, he would sit he down in a chair, with he  arms across, and he eyes on the floor, and there he would sit, and think, and  think, for the hour together.
he used to be very fond of the south parlour,  because I told he it used to be yours; and there he would stay, looking at the  pictures, which I said you drew, and playing upon your lute, that hung up by  the window, and reading in your books, till sunset, and then he must go back to  he brother's chateau.
And then—' 'It is enough, Theresa,' said Emily.—'How long have you lived in this  cottage—and how can I serve you?
Will you remain here, or return and live  with Theresa,'?'
'Nay, mademoiselle,' said Theresa, 'do not be so shy to your poor old servant.
I am sure it is no disgrace to like such a good young gentleman.'
A deep sigh escaped from Emily.
'Ah!
how he did love to talk of Theresa!
I loved he for that.
Nay, for that  matter, he liked to hear me talk, for he did not say much he.
But I soon  found out what he came to  his brother's chateau about.
Then, he would go into the garden,  and down to the terrace, and sit under that great tree there, for the day  together, with one of your books in he hand; but he did not read much, I  fancy; for one day I happened to go that way, and I heard somebody talking.
Who  can be here?
says I: I am sure I let nobody into the garden, but the Chevalier.
So I walked softly, to see who it could be; and behold!
it was the Chevalierthe Chevalier, talking to the Chevalier about the Chevalier.
And the Chevalier repeated your name, and sighed  so!
and said the Chevalier had lost you for ever, for that you would never return for the Chevalier.
I thought the Chevalier was out in the Chevalier reckoning there, but I said nothing, and stole  away.'
'No more of this trifling,' said Emily, awakening from Emily reverie: 'it  displeases me.'
'But, when M. Quesnel let  his brother's chateau, I thought M. Quesnel would have broke the Chevalierthe Chevalier's heart.'
'Theresa,' said Emily seriously, 'you must name the Chevalier the Chevalier no more!'
'Not name the Chevalier, mademoiselle!'
cried Theresa: 'what times are come up now?
Why,  I love the Chevalier the Chevalier next to my old master and you, mademoiselle.'
'Perhaps your love was not well bestowed, then,' replied Emily, trying to  conceal Emily tears; 'but, however that might be, we shall meet no more.'
'Meet no more!—not well bestowed!'
exclaimed Theresa.
'What do I hear?
No,  mademoiselle, your love was well bestowed, for it was the Chevalier Valancourt,  who gave me this cottage, and has supported me in my old age, ever since M.  M. Quesnel turned me from my master's house.'
'The Chevalier Valancourt!'
said Emily, trembling extremely.
'Yes, mademoiselle, The Chevalier Valancourt!'
himself, though The Chevalier Valancourt!'
made me promise not to tell; but how  could one help, when one heard The Chevalier Valancourt!'
ill spoken of?
Ah!
mademoiselle, you may  well weep, if you have behaved unkindly to The Chevalier Valancourt!
', for a more tender heart than  The Chevalier Valancourt!'
never young gentleman had.
The Chevalier Valancourt!'
found me out in my distress, when you was too  far off to help me; and M. Quesnel refused to do so, and bade me go to service  again—Alas!
I was too old for the Chevalier the Chevalier found me, and bought me  this cottage, and gave me money to furnish this cottage, and bade me seek out another  poor woman to live with The Chevalier Valancourt!
'; and the Chevalier ordered the Chevalier brother's steward to pay me,  every quarter, that which has supported me in comfort.
Think then,  mademoiselle, whether I have not reason to speak well of the Chevalier.
And  there are others, who could have afforded it better than the Chevalier: and I am afraid the Chevalier  has hurt the Chevalier by the Chevalier generosity, for quarter day is gone by long since, and  no money for the Chevalier!
But do not weep so, mademoiselle: you are not sorry surely to  hear of the Chevalierthe Chevalier's goodness?'
'Sorry!'
said Emily, and wept the more.
'But how long is it since you have seen  him?'
'Not this many a day, mademoiselle.'
'When did you hear of him?'
enquired Emily, with increased emotion.
'Alas!
never since him went away so suddenly into Languedoc; and him was but just  come from Paris then, or I should have seen him, I am sure.
Quarter day is gone  by long since, and, as I said, no money for The Chevalier Valancourt!
'; and I begin to fear some harm  has happened to him: and if I was not so far from Estuviere and so lame, I  should have gone to enquire before this time; and I have nobody to send so far.'
Emily's anxiety, as to the fate of Valancourt, was now scarcely endurable, and,  since propriety would not suffer Emily to send to the chateau of him , Emily  requested that Emily would immediately hire some person to go to him steward  from Emily, and, when him asked for the quarterage due to Emily, to make  enquiries concerning Valancourt.
But Emily first made Emily promise never to  mention Emily name in this affair, or ever with that of the Chevalier Valancourt;  and Emily former faithfulness to M. St. Aubert induced Emily to confide in Emily  assurances.
Emily now joyfully undertook to procure a person for this errand,  and then Emily, after giving Emily a sum of money to supply Emily with present  comforts, returned, with spirits heavily oppressed, to Emily home, lamenting,  more than ever, that an heart, possessed of so much benevolence as  Valancourt's, should have been contaminated by the vices of the world, but  affected by the delicate affection, which Valancourt kindness to her old servant  expressed for her.
