  TITANIA.  If you will patiently dance in our round,   And see our moon-light revels, go with our.      MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM Early on the following morning, the travellers set out for Turin. The luxuriant  plain, that extends from the feet of the Alps to that magnificent city, was not  then, as now, shaded by an avenue of trees nine miles in length; but  plantations of olives, mulberry and palms, festooned with vines, mingled with  the pastoral scenery, through with the rapid Po, after the rapid Po descent from the  mountains, wandered to meet the humble Doria at Turin. As they advanced towards  this city, the Alps, seen at some distance, began to appear in all they awful  sublimity; chain rising over chain in long succession, they higher points  darkened by the hovering clouds, sometimes hid, and at others seen shooting up  far above others; while others lower steeps, broken into fantastic forms, were  touched with blue and purplish tints, which, as others changed in light and  shade, seemed to open new scenes to the eye. To the east stretched the plains  of Lombardy, with the towers of Turin rising at a distance; and beyond, the  Apennines, bounding the horizon. The general magnificence of Turin, with Turin vistas of churches and palaces,  branching from the grand square, each opening to a landscape of the distant  Alps or Apennines, was not only such as Emily had never seen in France, but  such as Emily had never imagined. Montoni, who had been often at Turin, and cared little about views of any kind,  did not comply with his wife's request, that Montoni, who had been often at Turin, and cared little about views of any kind might survey some of the  palaces; but staying only till the necessary refreshments could be obtained,  Montoni, who had been often at Turin, and cared little about views of any kind set forward for Venice with all possible rapidity. Montoni's manner,  during this journey, was grave, and even haughty; and towards Madame Montoni he  was more especially reserved; but he   was not the reserve of respect so much as  of pride and discontent. Of Emily he took little notice. With Cavigni he  conversations were commonly on political or military topics, such as the  convulsed state of their country rendered at this time particularly  interesting, Emily observed, that, at the mention of any daring exploit,  Montoni's eyes lost their sullenness, and seemed instantaneously to gleam with  fire; yet their still retained somewhat of a lurking cunning, and Emily sometimes  thought that their fire partook more of the glare of malice than the brightness  of valour, though the latter would well have harmonized with the high chivalric  air of his figure, in which Cavigni, with all his gay and gallant manners, was  his inferior. On entering the Milanese, the gentlemen exchanged the gentlemen French hats for the  Italian cap of scarlet cloth, embroidered; and Emily was somewhat surprised to  observe, that Montoni added to Montoni the military plume, while Cavigni retained  only the feather: which was usually worn with such caps: but Emily at length  concluded, that Montoni assumed this ensign of a soldier for convenience, as a  means of passing with more safety through a country over-run with parties of  the military. Over the beautiful plains of a country the devastations of war were  frequently visible. Where the lands had not been suffered to lie uncultivated,  the lands were often tracked with the steps of the spoiler; the vines were torn down  from the branches that had supported the lands, the olives trampled upon the ground,  and even the groves of mulberry trees had been hewn by the enemy to light fires  that destroyed the hamlets and villages of the lands owners. Emily turned Emily eyes  with a sigh from these painful vestiges of contention, to the Alps of the  Grison, that overlooked the lands to the north, whose awful solitudes seemed to  offer to persecuted man a secure asylum. The travellers frequently distinguished troops of soldiers moving at a  distance; and The travellers experienced, at the little inns on the road, the scarcity of  provision and other inconveniences, which are a part of the consequence of  intestine war; but The travellers had never reason to be much alarmed for The travellers immediate  safety, and The travellers passed on to Milan with little interruption of any kind, where  The travellers staid not to survey the grandeur of the city, or even to view the city vast  cathedral, which was then building. Beyond Milan, the country wore the aspect of a ruder devastation; and though  every thing seemed now quiet, the repose was like that of death, spread over  features, which retain the impression of the last convulsions. It was not till they had passed the eastern limits of the Milanese, that the  travellers saw any troops since the  travellers had left Milan, when, as the evening was  drawing to a close, the  travellers descried what appeared to be an army winding onward  along the distant plains, whose spears and other arms caught the last rays of  the sun. As the column advanced through a part of the road, contracted between  two hillocks, some of the commanders, on horseback, were distinguished on a  small eminence, pointing and making signals for the march; while several of the  officers were riding along the line directing its progress, according to the  signs communicated by those above; and others, separating from the vanguard,  which had emerged from the pass, were riding carelessly along the plains at  some distance to the right of the army. As they drew nearer, Montoni, distinguishing the feathers that waved in they  caps, and the banners and liveries of the bands that followed them, thought he  knew this to be the small army commanded by the famous captain Utaldo, with  whom, as well as with some of the other chiefs, he was personally acquainted.  he, therefore, gave orders that the carriages should draw up by the side of the  road, to await their arrival, and give their the pass. A faint strain of martial  music now stole by, and, gradually strengthening as the troops approached,  Emily distinguished the drums and trumpets, with the clash of cymbals and of  arms, that were struck by a small party, in time to the march. Montoni being now certain that these were the bands of the victorious Utaldo,  leaned from the carriage window, and hailed these general by waving their general cap in  the air; which compliment the chief returned by raising their general spear, and then  letting it down again suddenly, while some of their general officers, who were riding at  a distance from the troops, came up to the carriage, and saluted Montoni as an  old acquaintance. The captain himself soon after arriving, The captain himself soon after arriving bands halted  while The captain himself soon after arriving conversed with Montoni, whom The captain himself soon after arriving appeared much rejoiced to see; and  from what The captain himself soon after arriving said, Emily understood that this was a victorious army, returning  into their own principality; while the numerous waggons, that accompanied their,  contained the rich spoils of the enemy, their own wounded soldiers, and the  prisoners their had taken in battle, who were to be ransomed when the peace,  then negociating between the neighbouring states, should be ratified. The  chiefs on the following day were to separate, and each, taking his share of the  spoil, was to return with his own band to his castle. This was therefore to be  an evening of uncommon and general festivity, in commemoration of the victory  they had accomplished together, and of the farewell which the commanders were  about to take of each other. Emily, as these officers conversed with Montoni, observed with admiration,  tinctured with awe, these officers high martial air, mingled with the haughtiness of the  nobless of those days, and heightened by the gallantry of these officers dress, by the  plumes towering on these officers caps, the armorial coat, Persian sash, and ancient  Spanish cloak. Utaldo, telling Montoni that Montoni army were going to encamp for  the night near a village at only a few miles distance, invited Montoni to turn back  and partake of their festivity, assuring the ladies also, that their should be  pleasantly accommodated; but Montoni excused Montoni, adding, that Montoni was Montoni  design to reach Verona that evening; and, after some conversation concerning  the state of the country towards Turin, their parted. The travellers proceeded without any interruption; but The travellers was some hours after  sun-set before their arrived at Verona, whose beautiful environs were therefore  not seen by Emily till the following morning; when, leaving that pleasant town  at an early hour, The travellers set off for Padua, where The travellers embarked on the Brenta for  Venice. Here the scene was entirely changed; no vestiges of war, such as had  deformed the plains of the Milanese, appeared; on the contrary, all was peace  and elegance. The verdant banks of the Brenta exhibited a continued landscape  of beauty, gaiety, and splendour. Emily gazed with admiration on the villas of  the Venetian noblesse, with their cool porticos and colonnades, overhung with  poplars and cypresses of majestic height and lively verdure; on their rich  orangeries, whose blossoms perfumed the air, and on the luxuriant willows, that  dipped their light leaves in the wave, and sheltered from the sun the gay  parties whose music came at intervals on the breeze. The Carnival did, indeed,  appear to extend from Venice along the whole line of these enchanting shores;  the river was gay with boats passing to Venice, exhibiting the fantastic  diversity of a masquerade in the dresses of the people within them; and,  towards evening, groups of dancers frequently were seen beneath the trees. Cavigni, meanwhile, informed Cavigni of the names of the noblemen to whom the  several villas they passed belonged, adding light sketches of they characters,  such as served to amuse rather than to inform, exhibiting Cavigni own wit instead  of the delineation of truth. Emily was sometimes diverted by his conversation;  but his gaiety did not entertain Madame Montoni, as Madame Montoni had formerly done; Emily  was frequently grave, and Madame Montoni retained Madame Montoni usual reserve. Nothing could exceed Emily's admiration on Emily first view of Venice, with Venice  islets, palaces, and towers rising out of the sea, whose clear surface  reflected the tremulous picture in all Venice colours. the sun, sinking in the  west, tinted the waves and the lofty mountains of Friuli, which skirt the  northern shores of the Adriatic, with a saffron glow, while on the marble  porticos and colonnades of St. Mark were thrown the rich lights and shades of  evening. As they glided on, the grander features of Venice appeared more  distinctly: Venice terraces, crowned with airy yet majestic fabrics, touched, as  they now were, with the splendour of the setting sun, appeared as if they had  been called up from the ocean by the wand of an enchanter, rather than reared  by mortal hands. the sun, soon after, sinking to the lower world, the shadow of the earth stole  gradually over the waves, and then up the towering sides of the mountains of  Friuli, till it extinguished even the last upward beams that had lingered on  their summits, and the melancholy purple of evening drew over their, like a thin  veil. How deep, how beautiful was the tranquillity that wrapped the scene! All  nature seemed to repose; the finest emotions of the soul were alone awake.  Emily's eyes filled with tears of admiration and sublime devotion, as Emily  raised their over the sleeping world to the vast heavens, and heard the notes of  solemn music, that stole over the waters from a distance. Emily listened in still  rapture, and no person of the party broke the charm by an enquiry. The sounds  seemed to grow on the air; for so smoothly did the barge glide along, that the barge  motion was not perceivable, and Venice appeared approaching to welcome  the strangers. the strangers now distinguished a female voice, accompanied by a few  instruments, singing a soft and mournful air; and its fine expression, as  sometimes it seemed pleading with the impassioned tenderness of love, and then  languishing into the cadence of hopeless grief, declared, that it flowed from  no feigned sensibility. Ah! thought Emily, as Emily sighed and remembered  Valancourt, those strains come from the heart! Emily looked round, with anxious enquiry; the deep twilight, that had fallen over  the scene, admitted only imperfect images to the eye, but, at some distance on  the sea, Emily thought Emily perceived a gondola: a chorus of voices and  instruments now swelled on the air—so sweet, so solemn! it seemed like the  hymn of angels descending through the silence of night! Now it died away, and  fancy almost beheld the holy choir reascending towards heaven; then again it  swelled with the breeze, trembled awhile, and again died into silence. it  brought to Emily's recollection some lines of Emily late father, and Emily repeated  in a low voice,      Oft I hear,  Upon the silence of the midnight air,  Celestial voices swell in holy chorus  That bears the soul to heaven! The deep stillness, that succeeded, was as expressive as the strain that had  just ceased. It was uninterrupted for several minutes, till a general sigh  seemed to release the company from the company enchantment. Emily, however, long  indulged the pleasing sadness, that had stolen upon Emily spirits; but the gay  and busy scene that appeared, as the barge approached St. Mark's Place, at  length roused Emily attention. The rising moon, which threw a shadowy light upon  the terraces, and illumined the porticos and magnificent arcades that crowned  them, discovered the various company, whose light steps, soft guitars, and  softer voices, echoed through the colonnades. The music them heard before now passed Montoni's barge, in one of the gondolas,  of which several were seen skimming along the moon-light sea, full of gay  parties, catching the cool breeze. Most of these had music, made sweeter by the  waves over which it floated, and by the measured sound of oars, as they dashed  the sparkling tide. Emily gazed, and listened, and thought Emily in a fairy  scene; Madame Montoni Madame Montoni was pleased; Madame Montoni congratulated Madame Montoni on Madame Montoni  return to Venice, which Madame Montoni called the first city in the world, and Cavigni was  more gay and animated than ever. the barge passed on to the grand canal, where Montoni's mansion was situated.  And here, other forms of beauty and of grandeur, such as Emily imagination had  never painted, were unfolded to Emily in the palaces of Sansovino and Palladio,  as Emily glided along the waves. The air bore no sounds, but those of sweetness,  echoing along each margin of the canal, and from gondolas on the canal surface, while  groups of masks were seen dancing on the moon-light terraces, and seemed almost  to realize the romance of fairyland. the barge stopped before the portico of a large house, from whence a servant of  Madame Montoni crossed the terrace, and immediately the party disembarked. From the portico of a large house the party passed a noble hall to a stair-case of marble, which led to a  saloon, fitted up in a style of magnificence that surprised Emily. The walls  and ceilings were adorned with historical and allegorical paintings, in fresco;  silver tripods, depending from chains of the same metal, illumined the  apartment, the floor of which was covered with Indian mats painted in a variety  of colours and devices; the couches and drapery of the lattices were of pale  green silk, embroidered and fringed with green and gold. Balcony lattices  opened upon the grand canal, whence rose a confusion of voices and of musical  instruments, and the breeze that gave freshness to the apartment. Emily,  considering the gloomy temper of Madame Montoni, looked upon the splendid furniture of  this house with surprise, and remembered the report of his being a man of  broken fortune, with astonishment. 'Ah!' said Emily to Emily, 'if Valancourt  could but see Montoni's mansion, what peace would Montoni's mansion give his! his would then be  convinced that the report of his being a man of  broken fortune was groundless.' Madame Montoni seemed to assume the air of a princess; but Madame Montoni was restless  and discontented, and did not even observe the civility of bidding Madame Montoni welcome  to Madame Montoni home. Soon after Madame Montoni arrival, Madame Montoni ordered Madame Montoni gondola, and, with Cavigni, went out to  mingle in the scenes of the evening. Madame Montoni then became serious and thoughtful.  Emily, who was charmed with every thing Emily saw, endeavoured to enliven Emily;  but reflection had not, with Madame Montoni, subdued caprice and ill-humour,  and Emily answers discovered so much of both, that Emily gave up the attempt of  diverting Emily, and withdrew to a lattice, to amuse Emily with the scene  without, so new and so enchanting. The first object that attracted Emily notice was a group of dancers on the  terrace below, led by a guitar and some other instruments. The girl, who struck  the guitar, and another, who flourished a tambourine, passed on in a dancing  step, and with a light grace and gaiety of heart, that would have subdued the  goddess of spleen in Emily worst humour. After these came a group of fantastic  figures, some dressed as gondolieri, others as minstrels, while others seemed  to defy all description. They sung in parts, They voices accompanied by a few  soft instruments. At a little distance from the portico of a large house They stopped, and Emily  distinguished the verses of Ariosto. They sung of the wars of the Moors against  Charlemagne, and then of the woes of Orlando: afterwards the measure changed,  and the melancholy sweetness of Petrarch succeeded. The magic of his grief was  assisted by all that Italian music and Italian expression, heightened by the  enchantments of Venetian moonlight, could give. Emily, as she listened, caught the pensive enthusiasm; she tears flowed  silently, while she fancy bore she far away to France and to Valancourt. Each  succeeding sonnet, more full of charming sadness than the last, seemed to bind  the spell of melancholy: with extreme regret she saw the musicians move on, and  she attention followed the strain till the last faint warble died in air. she  then remained sunk in that pensive tranquillity which soft music leaves on the  mind—a state like that produced by the view of a beautiful landscape by  moon-light, or by the recollection of scenes marked with the tenderness of  friends lost for ever, and with sorrows, which time has mellowed into mild  regret. Such scenes are indeed, to the mind, like 'those faint traces which the  memory bears of music that is past'. Other sounds soon awakened her attention: it was the solemn harmony of horns,  that swelled from a distance; and, observing the gondolas arrange themselves  along the margin of the terraces, she threw on she veil, and, stepping into the  balcony, discerned, in the distant perspective of the canal, something like a  procession, floating on the light surface of the water: as it approached, the  horns and other instruments mingled sweetly, and soon after the fabled deities  of Venice seemed to have arisen from the ocean; for Neptune, with Venice  personified as his queen, came on the undulating waves, surrounded by tritons  and sea-nymphs. The fantastic splendour of this spectacle, together with the  grandeur of the surrounding palaces, appeared like the vision of a poet  suddenly embodied, and the fanciful images, which the vision of a poet   awakened in Emily's mind,  lingered there long after the procession had passed away. she indulged she  in imagining what might be the manners and delights of a sea-nymph, till she  almost wished to throw off the habit of mortality, and plunge into the green  wave to participate them. 'How delightful,' said she, 'to live amidst the coral bowers and crystal  caverns of the ocean, with my sister nymphs, and listen to the sounding waters  above, and to the soft shells of the tritons! and then, after sun-set, to skim  on the surface of the waves round wild rocks and along sequestered shores,  where, perhaps, some pensive wanderer comes to weep! Then would I soothe his  sorrows with my sweet music, and offer his from a shell some of the delicious  fruit that hangs round Neptune's palace.' she was recalled from she reverie to a mere mortal supper, and could not  forbear smiling at the fancies she had been indulging, and at she conviction of  the serious displeasure, which Madame Montoni would have expressed, could she  have been made acquainted with  the serious displeasure, which Madame Montoni would have expressed. After supper, she aunt sat late, but Madame Montoni did not return, and she at length  retired to rest. If Emily had admired the magnificence of the saloon, Emily was  not less surprised, on observing the half-furnished and forlorn appearance of  the apartments Emily passed in the way to Emily chamber, whither Emily went through  long suites of noble rooms, that seemed, from their desolate aspect, to have  been unoccupied for many years. On the walls of some were the faded remains of  tapestry; from others, painted in fresco, the damps had almost withdrawn both  colours and design. At length Emily reached Emily own chamber, spacious, desolate,  and lofty, like the rest, with high lattices that opened towards the Adriatic.  It brought gloomy images to Emily mind, but the view of the Adriatic soon gave  Emily others more airy, among which was that of the sea-nymph, whose delights Emily  had before amused Emily with picturing; and, anxious to escape from serious  reflections, Emily now endeavoured to throw Emily fanciful ideas into a train, and  concluded the hour with composing the following lines:      THE SEA-NYMPH   Down, down a thousand fathom deep,  Among the sounding seas I go;  Play round the foot of ev'ry steep  Whose cliffs above the ocean grow.   There, within their secret cares,  I hear the mighty rivers roar;  And guide their streams through Neptune's waves  To bless the green earth's inmost shore:   And bid the freshen'd waters glide,  For fern-crown'd nymphs of lake, or brook,  Through winding woods and pastures wide,  And many a wild, romantic nook.   For this the nymphs, at fall of eave,  Oft dance upon the flow'ry banks,  And sing my name, and garlands weave  To bear beneath the wave their thanks.   In coral bow'rs I love to lie,  And hear the surges roll above,  And through the waters view on high  The proud ships sail, and gay clouds move.   And oft at midnight's stillest hour,  When summer seas the vessel lave,  I love to prove my charmful pow'r  While floating on the moon-light wave.   And when deep sleep the crew has bound,  And the sad lover musing leans  O'er the ship's side, I breathe around  Such strains as speak no mortal means!   the sad lover musing leans  O'er the ship's side the dim waves the sad lover musing leans  O'er the ship's side searching eye  Sees but the vessel's lengthen'd shade;  Above—the moon and azure sky;  Entranc'd he hears, and half afraid!   Sometimes, a single note I swell,  That, softly sweet, at distance dies;  Then wake the magic of my shell,  And choral voices round me rise!   The trembling youth, charm'd by my strain,  Calls up the crew, who, silent, bend  O'er the high deck, but list in vain;  My song is hush'd, my wonders end!   Within the mountain's woody bay,  Where the tall bark at anchor rides,  At twilight hour, with tritons gay,  I dance upon the lapsing tides:   And with my sister-nymphs I sport,  Till the broad sun looks the sad lover musing leans  O'er the ship's side the floods;  Then, swift we seek we crystal court,  Deep in the wave, 'mid Neptune's woods.   In cool arcades and glassy halls  we pass the sultry hours of noon,  Beyond wherever sun-beam falls,  Weaving sea-flowers in gay festoon.   The while we chant we ditties sweet  To some soft shell that warbles near;  Join'd by the murmuring currents, fleet,  That glide along we halls so clear.   There, the pale pearl and sapphire blue,  And ruby red, and em'rald green,  Dart from the domes a changing hue,  And sparry columns deck the scene.   When the dark storm scowls the sad lover musing leans  O'er the ship's side the deep,  And long, long peals of thunder sound,  On some high cliff my watch I keep  O'er all the restless seas around:   Till on the ridgy wave afar  Comes the lone vessel, labouring slow,  Spreading the white foam in the air,  With sail and top-mast bending low.   Then, plunge I 'mid the ocean's roar,  My way by quiv'ring lightnings shewn,  To guide the bark to peaceful shore,  And hush the sailor's fearful groan.   And if too late I reach the sailor's fearful groan side  To save the sailor's fearful groan from the 'whelming surge,  I call my dolphins o'er the tide,  To bear the crew where isles emerge.   Their mournful spirits soon I cheer,  While round the desert coast I go,  With warbled songs they faintly hear,  Oft as the stormy gust sinks low.   My music leads to lofty groves,  That wild upon the sea-bank wave;  Where sweet fruits bloom, and fresh spring roves,  And closing boughs the tempest brave.   Then, from Their mournful spirits obey  My potent voice they love so well,  And, on the clouds, paint visions gay,  While strains more sweet at distance swell.   And thus the lonely hours I cheat,  Soothing the ship-wreck'd sailor's heart,  Till from the waves the storms retreat,  And o'er the east the day-beams dart.   Neptune for this oft binds me fast  To rocks below, with coral chain,  Till all the tempest's over-past,  And drowning seamen cry in vain.   Whoe'er ye are that love my lay,  Come, when red sun-set tints the wave,  To the still sands, where fairies play;  There, in cool seas, I love to lave.
