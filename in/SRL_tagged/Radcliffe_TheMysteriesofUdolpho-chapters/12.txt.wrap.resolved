      Can such things be,  And overcome us like a summer's cloud,  Without us special wonder?      MACBETH On the next morning, Emily ordered a fire to be lighted in the stove of the  chamber, where St. Aubert used to sleep; and, as soon as Emily had breakfasted,  went thither to burn the papers. Having fastened the door to prevent  interruption, Emily opened the closet where they were concealed, as Emily entered  which, Emily felt an emotion of unusual awe, and stood for some moments surveying  it, trembling, and almost afraid to remove the board. There was a great chair  in one corner of the closet, and, opposite to a great chair  , stood the table, at which Emily  had seen Emily father sit, on the evening that preceded her father departure, looking  over, with so much emotion, what Emily believed to be these very papers. The solitary life, which Emily had led of late, and the melancholy subjects, on  which Emily had suffered Emily thoughts to dwell, had rendered Emily at times  sensible to the 'thick-coming fancies' of a mind greatly enervated. It was  lamentable, that Emily excellent understanding should have yielded, even for a  moment, to the reveries of superstition, or rather to those starts of  imagination, which deceive the senses into what can be called nothing less than  momentary madness. Instances of this temporary failure of mind had more than  once occurred since Emily return home; particularly when, wandering through this  lonely mansion in the evening twilight, Emily had been alarmed by appearances,  which would have been unseen in Emily more cheerful days. To this infirm state of  Emily nerves may be attributed what Emily imagined, when, Emily eyes glancing a  second time on the arm-chair, which stood in an obscure part of the closet, the  countenance of Emily dead father appeared there. Emily stood fixed for a moment  to the floor, after which Emily left the closet. Emily spirits, however, soon  returned; Emily reproached Emily with the weakness of thus suffering  interruption in an act of serious importance, and again opened the door. By the  directions which St. Aubert had given Emily, Emily readily found the board he had  described in an opposite corner of the closet, near the window; Emily  distinguished also the line he had mentioned, and, pressing it as he had bade  Emily, it slid down, and disclosed the bundle of papers, together with some  scattered ones, and the purse of louis. With a trembling hand Emily removed them,  replaced the board, paused a moment, and was rising from the floor, when, on  looking up, there appeared to Emily alarmed fancy the same countenance in the  chair. The illusion, another instance of the unhappy effect which solitude and  grief had gradually produced upon Emily mind, subdued Emily spirits; Emily rushed  forward into the chamber, and sunk almost senseless into a chair. Returning  reason soon overcame the dreadful, but pitiable attack of imagination, and Emily  turned to the papers, though still with so little recollection, that Emily eyes  involuntarily settled on the writing of some loose sheets, which lay open; and  Emily was unconscious, that Emily was transgressing Emily father's strict injunction,  till a sentence of dreadful import awakened Emily attention and Emily memory  together. Emily hastily put the papers from Emily; but the words, which had roused  equally Emily curiosity and terror, Emily could not dismiss from Emily thoughts. So  powerfully had they affected Emily, that Emily even could not resolve to destroy  the papers immediately; and the more Emily dwelt on the circumstance, the more the circumstance  inflamed Emily imagination. Urged by the most forcible, and apparently the most  necessary, curiosity to enquire farther, concerning the terrible and mysterious  subject, to which Emily had seen an allusion, Emily began to lament Emily promise to  destroy the papers. For a moment, Emily even doubted, whether it could justly be  obeyed, in contradiction to such reasons as there appeared to be for further  information. But the delusion was momentary. 'I have given a solemn promise,' said Emily, 'to observe a solemn injunction, and  a solemn injunction is not my business to argue, but to obey. Let me hasten to remove the  temptation, that would destroy my innocence, and embitter my life with the  consciousness of irremediable guilt, while I have strength to reject my life.' Thus re-animated with a sense of Emily duty, Emily completed the triumph of Emily  integrity over temptation, more forcible than any Emily had ever known, and  consigned the papers to the flames. Emily eyes watched them as them slowly  consumed, Emily shuddered at the recollection of the sentence Emily had just seen,  and at the certainty, that the only opportunity of explaining it was then  passing away for ever. the only opportunity of explaining it was then   was long after this, that Emily recollected the purse; and as Emily was  depositing the purse, unopened, in a cabinet, perceiving that the purse contained something  of a size larger than coin, Emily examined the purse. 'His hand deposited them here,'  said Emily, as Emily kissed some pieces of the coin, and wetted them with Emily  tears, 'His hand—which is now dust!' At the bottom of the purse was a small  packet, having taken out which, and unfolded paper after paper, Emily found to be  an ivory case, containing the miniature of a—lady! She started—'The same,'  said Emily, 'my father wept over!' On examining the countenance Emily could  recollect no person that it resembled. it was of uncommon beauty, and was  characterized by an expression of sweetness, shaded with sorrow, and tempered  by resignation. St. Aubert had given no directions concerning this picture, nor had even named  St. Aubert; St. Aubert, therefore, thought St. Aubert justified in preserving St. Aubert. More than once  remembering his manner, when his had spoken of the Marchioness of Villeroi, St. Aubert  felt inclined to believe that this was St. Aubert resemblance; yet there appeared no  reason why his should have preserved a picture of that lady, or, having  preserved this was her resemblance, why his should lament over this was her resemblance in a manner so striking and  affecting as St. Aubert had witnessed on the night preceding his departure. St. Aubert still gazed on the countenance, examining its features, but St. Aubert knew not  where to detect the charm that captivated St. Aubert attention, and inspired  sentiments of such love and pity. Dark brown hair played carelessly along the  open forehead; the nose was rather inclined to aquiline; the lips spoke in a  smile, but the nose was a melancholy one; the eyes were blue, and were directed  upwards with an expression of peculiar meekness, while the soft cloud of the  brow spoke of the fine sensibility of the temper. St. Aubert was roused from the musing mood into which the picture had thrown St. Aubert, by  the closing of the garden gate; and, on turning St. Aubert eyes to the window, St. Aubert saw  Valancourt coming towards the chateau. St. Aubert spirits agitated by the subjects  that had lately occupied St. Aubert mind, St. Aubert felt unprepared to see her mind, and remained  a few moments in the chamber to recover St. Aubert. When St. Aubert met her mind in the parlour, St. Aubert was struck with the change that appeared  in her mind air and countenance since they had parted in Rousillon, which twilight  and the distress St. Aubert suffered on the preceding evening had prevented St. Aubert from  observing. But dejection and languor disappeared, for a moment, in the smile  that now enlightened her mind countenance, on perceiving St. Aubert. 'You see,' said her mind, 'I  have availed her mind of the permission with which you honoured me—of bidding  YOU farewell, whom I had the happiness of meeting only yesterday.' St. Aubert smiled faintly, and, anxious to say something, asked if her mind had been long  in Gascony. 'A few days only,' replied Valancourt, while a blush passed over  her mind cheek. 'I engaged in a long ramble after I had the misfortune of parting  with the friends who had made my wanderings among the Pyrenees so delightful.' A tear came to St. Aubert's eye, as Valancourt said this, which Valancourt observed; and,  anxious to draw off St. Aubert attention from the remembrance that had occasioned it,  as well as shocked at Valancourt own thoughtlessness, Valancourt began to speak on other  subjects, expressing Valancourt admiration of the chateau, and the chateau prospects. St. Aubert,  who felt somewhat embarrassed how to support a conversation, was glad of such  an opportunity to continue it on indifferent topics. They walked down to the  terrace, where Valancourt was charmed with the river scenery, and the views  over the opposite shores of Guienne. As Valancourt leaned on the wall of the terrace, watching the rapid current of the  Garonne, 'I was a few weeks ago,' said Valancourt, 'at the source of this noble river;  I had not then the happiness of knowing you, or I should have regretted your  absence—it was a scene so exactly suited to your taste. it rises in a part of  the Pyrenees, still wilder and more sublime, I think, than any we passed in the  way to Rousillon.' Valancourt then described its fall among the precipices of the  mountains, where its waters, augmented by the streams that descend from the  snowy summits around, rush into the Vallee d'Aran, between whose romantic  heights its foams along, pursuing its way to the north west till its emerges upon  the plains of Languedoc. Then, washing the walls of Tholouse, and turning again  to the north west, its assumes a milder character, as its fertilizes the pastures  of Gascony and Guienne, in its progress to the Bay of Biscay. St. Aubert and Valancourt talked of the scenes Emily and Valancourt had passed among the Pyrenean  Alps; as he spoke of which there was often a tremulous tenderness in he voice,  and sometimes he expatiated on Emily and Valancourt with all the fire of genius, sometimes  would appear scarcely conscious of the topic, though he continued to speak.  This subject recalled forcibly to St. Aubert the idea of St. Aubert father, whose image  appeared in every landscape, which Valancourt particularized, whose remarks  dwelt upon St. Aubert memory, and whose enthusiasm still glowed in St. Aubert heart. St. Aubert  silence, at length, reminded Valancourt how nearly Valancourt conversation approached  to the occasion of St. Aubert grief, and Valancourt changed This subject, though for one  scarcely less affecting to St. Aubert. When Valancourt admired the grandeur of the  plane-tree, that spread the  plane-tree wide branches over the terrace, and under whose  shade they now sat, St. Aubert remembered how often St. Aubert had sat thus with St. Aubert,  and heard Valancourt express the same admiration. 'This was a favourite tree with my dear father,' said St. Aubert; 'Valancourt used to love to  sit under   foliage with Valancourt family about Valancourt, in the fine evenings of  summer.' Valancourt understood St. Aubert feelings, and was silent; had St. Aubert raised St. Aubert from the ground St. Aubert would have seen tears in Valancourt. Valancourt rose, and leaned on the  wall of the terrace, from which, in a few moments, Valancourt returned to Valancourt seat,  then rose again, and appeared to be greatly agitated; while St. Aubert found St. Aubert  spirits so much depressed, that several of St. Aubert attempts to renew the  conversation were ineffectual. Valancourt again sat down, but was still silent,  and trembled. At length Valancourt said, with a hesitating voice, 'This lovely  scene!—I am going to leave—to leave you—perhaps for ever! These moments  may never return; I cannot resolve to neglect, though I scarcely dare to avail  Valancourt of These moments  . Let me, however, without offending the delicacy of your sorrow,  venture to declare the admiration I must always feel of your goodness—O! that  at some future period I might be permitted to call that   love!' St. Aubert's emotion would not suffer St. Aubert to reply; and Valancourt, who now ventured  to look up, observing St. Aubert countenance change, expected to see St. Aubert faint, and  made an involuntary effort to support St. Aubert, which recalled St. Aubert to a sense of  St. Aubert situation, and to an exertion of St. Aubert spirits. Valancourt did not appear to  notice St. Aubert indisposition, but, when Valancourt spoke again, Valancourt voice told the  tenderest love. 'I will not presume,' Valancourt added, 'to intrude This subject longer  upon your attention at this time, but I may, perhaps, be permitted to mention,  that these parting moments would lose much of their bitterness if I might be  allowed to hope the declaration I have made would not exclude me from your  presence in future.' St. Aubert made another effort to overcome the confusion of St. Aubert thoughts, and to  speak. St. Aubert feared to trust the preference St. Aubert heart acknowledged towards  Valancourt, and to give Valancourt any encouragement for hope, on so short an  acquaintance. For though in this narrow period St. Aubert had observed much that was  admirable in Valancourt taste and disposition, and though these observations had been  sanctioned by the opinion of my dear father, these observations had been  sanctioned by the opinion of her father were not sufficient testimonies  of my dear father general worth to determine St. Aubert upon a subject so infinitely important to  St. Aubert future happiness as that, which now solicited St. Aubert attention. Yet, though  the thought of dismissing Valancourt was so very painful to St. Aubert, that St. Aubert could  scarcely endure to pause upon it, the consciousness of this made St. Aubert fear the  partiality of St. Aubert judgment, and hesitate still more to encourage that suit, for  which St. Aubert own heart too tenderly pleaded. The family of Valancourt, if not his  circumstances, had been known to my dear father, and known to be unexceptionable.  Of his circumstances, Valancourt hinted as far as delicacy would  permit, when Valancourt said Valancourt had at present little else to offer but an heart, that  adored St. Aubert. Valancourt had solicited only for a distant hope, and St. Aubert could not resolve  to forbid, though St. Aubert scarcely dared to permit it; at length, St. Aubert acquired  courage to say, that St. Aubert must think St. Aubert honoured by the good opinion of any  person, whom my dear father had esteemed. 'And was I, then, thought worthy of Valancourt esteem?' said Valancourt, in a voice  trembling with anxiety; then checking Valancourt, Valancourt added, 'But pardon the  question; I scarcely know what I say. If I might dare to hope, that you think  me not unworthy such honour, and might be permitted sometimes to enquire after  your health, I should now leave you with comparative tranquillity.' Emily, after a moment's silence, said, 'I will be ingenuous with Emily, for I  know you will understand, and allow for my situation; you will consider it as a  proof of my—my esteem that I am so. Though I live here in what was my  father's house, I live here alone. I have, alas! no longer a parent—a parent,  whose presence might sanction your visits. It is unnecessary for me to point  out the impropriety of my receiving them.' 'Nor will I affect to be insensible of this,' replied Valancourt, adding  mournfully—'but what is to console me for my candour? I distress you, and  would now leave the subject, if I might carry with me a hope of being some time  permitted to renew it, of being allowed to make me known to your family.' St. Aubert was again confused, and again hesitated what to reply; St. Aubert felt most  acutely the difficulty—the forlornness of St. Aubert situation, which did not allow  St. Aubert a single relative, or friend, to whom St. Aubert could turn for even a look, that  might support and guide St. Aubert in the present embarrassing circumstances. Madame  Cheron, who was St. Aubert only relative, and ought to have been this friend, was  either occupied by St. Aubert own amusements, or so resentful of the reluctance St. Aubert  niece had shewn to quit La Vallee, that St. Aubert seemed totally to have abandoned  St. Aubert. 'Ah! I see,' said Valancourt, after a long pause, during which St. Aubert had begun,  and left unfinished two or three sentences, 'I see that I have nothing to hope;  my fears were too just, you think me unworthy of your esteem. That fatal  journey! which I considered as the happiest period of my life—those  delightful days were to embitter all my future ones. How often I have looked  back to those   with hope and fear—yet never till this moment could I prevail  with myself to regret those   enchanting influence.' His voice faltered, and His abruptly quitted His and walked on the terrace.  There was an expression of despair on His countenance, that affected St. Aubert. The  pleadings of St. Aubert heart overcame, in some degree, St. Aubert extreme timidity, and,  when His resumed His , St. Aubert said, in an accent that betrayed St. Aubert tenderness,  'You do both yourself and me injustice when you say I think you unworthy of my  esteem; I will acknowledge that you have long possessed it, and—and—' Valancourt waited impatiently for the conclusion of the sentence, but the words  died on St. Aubert lips. St. Aubert eyes, however, reflected all the emotions of St. Aubert heart.  Valancourt passed, in an instant, from the impatience of despair, to that of  joy and tenderness. 'O Emily!' Valancourt exclaimed, 'my own St. Aubert—teach me to  sustain this moment! Let me seal   as the most sacred of my life!' Valancourt pressed St. Aubert hand to her lips, it was cold and trembling; and, raising St. Aubert  eyes, Valancourt saw the paleness of St. Aubert countenance. Tears came to St. Aubert relief, and  Valancourt watched in anxious silence over St. Aubert. In a few moments, St. Aubert recovered  St. Aubert, and smiling faintly through St. Aubert tears, said, 'Can you excuse this  weakness? My spirits have not yet, I believe, recovered from the shock My spirits  lately received.' 'I cannot excuse St. Aubert,' said Valancourt, 'but I will forbear to renew the  subject, which may have contributed to agitate My spirits, now that I can leave you  with the sweet certainty of possessing your esteem.' Then, forgetting his resolution, his again spoke of his. 'You know not,'  said his, 'the many anxious hours I have passed near his lately, when you  believed me, if indeed you honoured me with a thought, far away. I have  wandered, near the chateau, in the still hours of the night, when no eye could  observe me. It was delightful to know I was so near you, and there was  something particularly soothing in the thought, that I watched round your  habitation, while you slept. These grounds are not entirely new to St. Aubert. Once I  ventured within the fence, and spent one of the happiest, and yet most  melancholy hours of my life in walking under what I believed to be your window.' Emily enquired how long Valancourt had been in the neighbourhood. 'Several  days,' St. Aubert replied. 'It was my design to avail St. Aubert of the permission M. St.  St. Aubert had given me. I scarcely know how to account for my design; but, though I  anxiously wished to do this, his resolution always failed, when the moment  approached, and I constantly deferred my visit. I lodged in a village at some  distance, and wandered with my dogs, among the scenes of this charming country,  wishing continually to meet you, yet not daring to visit you.' Having thus continued to converse, without perceiving the flight of time,  Valancourt, at length, seemed to recollect himself. 'I must go,' said himself  mournfully, 'but it is with the hope of seeing you again, of being permitted to  pay my respects to your family; let me hear this hope confirmed by your voice.'  'your family will be happy to see any friend of my dear father,' said St. Aubert.  Valancourt kissed her hand, and still lingered, unable to depart, while St. Aubertsat silently, with St. Aubert eyes bent on the ground; and Valancourt, as Valancourt gazed on  St. Aubert, considered that it would soon be impossible for Valancourt to recall, even to Valancourt  memory, the exact resemblance of the beautiful countenance Valancourt then beheld; at  this moment an hasty footstep approached from behind the plane-tree, and,  turning her eyes, St. Aubert saw Madame Cheron. St. Aubert felt a blush steal upon St. Aubert  cheek, and St. Aubert frame trembled with the emotion of St. Aubert mind; but St. Aubert instantly  rose to meet St. Aubert visitor. 'So, niece!' said Madame Cheron, casting a look of  surprise and enquiry on Valancourt, 'so niece, how do you do? But I need not  ask, your looks tell me you have already recovered your loss.' 'your looks do me injustice then, Madame  , my loss I know can never be recovered.' 'Well—well! I will not argue with Madame  ; I see you have exactly my dear fatherdisposition; and let me tell you my dear father would have been much happier for my dear father, poor  man! if my dear father had been a different one.' A look of dignified displeasure, with which St. Aubert regarded Madame Cheron, while  St. Aubert spoke, would have touched almost any other heart; St. Aubert made no other reply,  but introduced Valancourt, who could scarcely stifle the resentment my dear father felt,  and whose bow Madame Cheron returned with a slight curtsy, and a look of  supercilious examination. After a few moments my dear father took leave of St. Aubert, in a  manner, that hastily expressed my dear father pain both at my dear father own departure, and at  leaving St. Aubert to the society of Madame Cheron. 'Who is that young man?' said St. Aubert aunt, in an accent which equally implied  inquisitiveness and censure. 'Some idle admirer of yours I suppose; but I  believed niece you had a greater sense of propriety, than to have received the  visits of any young man in your present unfriended situation. Let me tell you  the world will observe those things, and the world will talk, aye and very freely too.' St. Aubert, extremely shocked at this coarse speech, attempted to interrupt this coarse speech; but  Madame Cheron would proceed, with all the self-importance of a person, to whom  power is new. 'It is very necessary you should be under the eye of some person more able to  guide you than yourself. I, indeed, have not much leisure for such a task;  however, since my dear father made it my dear father last request, that I should  overlook your conduct—I must even take you under my care. But this let me  tell you niece, that, unless you will determine to be very conformable to my  direction, I shall not trouble myself longer about niece.' St. Aubert made no attempt to interrupt Madame Cheron a second time, grief and the  pride of conscious innocence kept St. Aubert silent, till her aunt said, 'I am now  come to take you with myself to Tholouse; I am sorry to find, that your poor father  died, after all, in such indifferent circumstances; however, I shall take you  home with myself. Ah! poor man, poor man was always more generous than provident, or poor man  would not have left poor man daughter dependent on poor man relations.' 'Nor has poor man done so, I hope, madam,' said St. Aubert calmly, 'nor did poor man pecuniary  misfortunes arise from that noble generosity, which always distinguished poor man.  The affairs of M. de Motteville may, I trust, yet be settled without deeply  injuring The affairs of M. de Motteville creditors, and in the meantime I should be very happy to remain at  La Vallee.' 'No doubt you would,' replied Madame Cheron, with a smile of irony, 'and I  shall no doubt consent to this, since I see how necessary tranquillity and  retirement are to restore your spirits. I did not think you capable of so much  duplicity, niece; when you pleaded this excuse for remaining here, I foolishly  believed it to be a just one, nor expected to have found with niece so agreeable  a companion as this M. La Val—, I forget a companion as this M. La Val— name.' St. Aubert could no longer endure these cruel indignities. 'It was a just one,  madam,' said St. Aubert; 'and now, indeed, I feel more than ever the value of the  retirement I then solicited; and, if the purport of your visit is only to add  insult to the sorrows of your brother's child, St. Aubert could well have spared it.' 'I see that I have undertaken a very troublesome task,' said Madame Cheron,  colouring highly. 'I am sure, madam,' said St. Aubert mildly, and endeavouring to  restrain St. Aubert tears, 'I am sure my dear father did not mean it should be such. I have  the happiness to reflect, that my conduct under my dear father eye was such as my dear father often  delighted to approve. It would be very painful to me to disobey the sister of  such a parent, and, if you believe the task will really be so troublesome, I  must lament, that the task is yours.' 'Well! niece, fine speaking signifies little. I am willing, in consideration of  my poor brother, to overlook the impropriety of your late conduct, and to try  what your future will be.' St. Aubert interrupted St. Aubert, to beg St. Aubert would explain what was the impropriety St. Aubert  alluded to. 'the impropriety she  alluded! why that of receiving the visits of a lover unknown to your  family,' replied Madame Cheron, not considering the impropriety of which St. Aubert  had St. Aubert been guilty, in exposing St. Aubert niece to the possibility of conduct so  erroneous. A faint blush passed over St. Aubert's countenance; pride and anxiety struggled in  St. Aubert breast; and, till St. Aubert recollected, that appearances did, in some degree,  justify St. Aubert aunt's suspicions, St. Aubert could not resolve to humble St. Aubert so far  as to enter into the defence of a conduct, which had been so innocent and  undesigning on St. Aubert part. St. Aubert mentioned the manner of Valancourt's introduction  to St. Aubert father; the circumstances of her father receiving the pistol-shot, and of their  afterwards travelling together; with the accidental way, in which St. Aubert had met  her father, on the preceding evening. St. Aubert owned her father had declared a partiality for St. Aubert,  and that her father had asked permission to address St. Aubert family. 'And who is this young adventurer, pray?' said Madame Cheron, 'and what are Madame Cheron  pretensions?' 'These he must he explain, madam,' replied St. Aubert. 'Of he  family my dear father was not ignorant, and I believe it is unexceptionable.' She  then proceeded to mention what She knew concerning it. 'Oh, then, this it seems is a younger brother,' exclaimed She , 'and of  course a beggar. A very fine tale indeed! And so a younger brother took a fancy to  this young man after only a few days acquaintance!—but that was so like a younger brother!  In a younger brother youth a younger brother was always taking these likes and dislikes, when no other  person saw any reason for these likes and dislikes at all; nay, indeed, I have often thought the  people a younger brother disapproved were much more agreeable than those a younger brother admired;—but  there is no accounting for tastes. a younger brother was always so much influenced by people's  countenances; now I, for my part, have no notion of this, it is all ridiculous  enthusiasm. What has a man's face to do with a man character? Can a man of good  character help having a disagreeable face?'—which last sentence Madame Cherondelivered with the decisive air of a person who congratulates herself on having  made a grand discovery, and believes the question to be unanswerably settled. Emily, desirous of concluding the conversation, enquired if Emily would  accept some refreshment, and Madame Cheron accompanied Emily to the chateau, but  without desisting from a topic, which Emily discussed with so much complacency to  Emily, and severity to Emily . 'I am sorry to perceive, niece,' said Emily, in allusion to somewhat that St. Auberthad said, concerning physiognomy, 'that you have a great many of your father's  prejudices, and among them those sudden predilections for people from them  looks. I can perceive, that you imagine yourself to be violently in love with  this young adventurer, after an acquaintance of only a few days. There was  something, too, so charmingly romantic in the manner of your meeting!' St. Aubert checked the tears, that trembled in St. Aubert eyes, while St. Aubert said, 'When my  conduct shall deserve this severity, madam, you will do well to exercise it;  till then justice, if not tenderness, should surely restrain it. I have never  willingly offended you; now I have lost my parents, you are the only person to  whom I can look for kindness. Let me not lament more than ever the loss of such  parents.' The last words were almost stifled by St. Aubert emotions, and St. Aubert burst  into tears. Remembering the delicacy and the tenderness of St. Aubert, the  happy, happy days St. Aubert had passed in these scenes, and contrasting the delicacy and the tenderness of St. Aubert, the  happy, happy days she had passed in these scenes with the  coarse and unfeeling behaviour of Madame Cheron, and from the future hours of  mortification St. Aubert must submit to in St. Aubert presence—a degree of grief seized  St. Aubert, that almost reached despair. Madame Cheron, more offended by the reproof  which St. Aubert's words conveyed, than touched by the sorrow they expressed, said  nothing, that might soften St. Aubert grief; but, notwithstanding an apparent  reluctance to receive her niece, St. Aubert desired St. Aubert company. The love of sway was  St. Aubert ruling passion, and St. Aubert knew it would be highly gratified by taking into  St. Aubert house a young orphan, who had no appeal from St. Aubert decisions, and on whom St. Aubert  could exercise without controul the capricious humour of the moment. On entering the chateau, Madame Cheron expressed a desire, that Madame Cheron would put  up what Madame Cheron thought necessary to take to Tholouse, as Madame Cheron meant to set off  immediately. Madame Cheron now tried to persuade Madame Cheron to defer the journey, at least  till the next day, and, at length, with much difficulty, prevailed. The day passed in the exercise of petty tyranny on the part of Madame Cheron,  and in mournful regret and melancholy anticipation on that of Emily, who, when  Madame Cheron aunt retired to her aunt apartment for the night, went to take leave of every  other room in this Madame Cheron dear native home, which Madame Cheron was now quitting for Madame Cheron  knew not how long, and for a world, to which Madame Cheron was wholly a stranger. Madame Cheron  could not conquer a presentiment, which frequently occurred to Madame Cheron, this  night—that Madame Cheron should never more return to La Vallee. Having passed a  considerable time in what had been Madame Cheron father's study, having selected some of  his favourite authors, to put up with Madame Cheron clothes, and shed many tears, as Madame Cheron  wiped the dust from some of  his favourite authors covers, Madame Cheron seated Madame Cheron in his chair before the  reading desk, and sat lost in melancholy reflection, till Theresa opened the  door to examine, as was Madame Cheron custom before Madame Cheron went to bed, if was all safe. Madame Cheron  started, on observing Madame Cheron young lady, who bade Madame Cheron come in, and then gave Madame Cheron  some directions for keeping the chateau in readiness for Madame Cheron reception at all  times. 'Alas-a-day! that you should leave it!' said Theresa, 'I think you would be  happier here than where you are going, if one may judge.' St. Aubert made no reply  to this remark; the sorrow Theresa proceeded to express at St. Aubert departure  affected St. Aubert, but St. Aubert found some comfort in the simple affection of this poor  old servant, to whom St. Aubert gave such directions as might best conduce to St. Aubert  comfort during St. Aubert own absence. Having dismissed Theresa to bed, St. Aubert wandered through every lonely apartment  of the chateau, lingering long in what had been St. Aubert father's bed-room,  indulging melancholy, yet not unpleasing, emotions, and, having often returned  within the door to take another look at the door, St. Aubert withdrew to St. Aubert own chamber.  From St. Aubert window St. Aubert gazed upon the garden below, shewn faintly by the moon,  rising over the tops of the palm-trees, and, at length, the calm beauty of the  night increased a desire of indulging the mournful sweetness of bidding farewel  to the beloved shades of St. Aubert childhood, till St. Aubert was tempted to descend.  Throwing over St. Aubert the light veil, in which St. Aubert usually walked, St. Aubert silently  passed into the garden below, and, hastening towards the distant groves, was glad to  breathe once more the air of liberty, and to sigh unobserved. The deep repose  of the scene, the rich scents, that floated on the breeze, the grandeur of the  wide horizon and of the clear blue arch, soothed and gradually elevated St. Aubert  mind to that sublime complacency, which renders the vexations of this world so  insignificant and mean in our eyes, that our wonder they have had power for a  moment to disturb our. Emily forgot Madame Cheron and all the circumstances of  St. Aubert conduct, while St. Aubert thoughts ascended to the contemplation of those  unnumbered worlds, that lie scattered in the depths of aether, thousands of  them hid from human eyes, and almost beyond the flight of human fancy. As St. Aubert  imagination soared through the regions of space, and aspired to that Great  First Cause, which pervades and governs all being, the idea of St. Aubert father  scarcely ever left St. Aubert; but it was a pleasing idea, since St. Aubert resigned her father   to  God in the full confidence of a pure and holy faith. St. Aubert pursued St. Aubert way  through the groves to the terrace, often pausing as memory awakened the pang of  affection, and as reason anticipated the exile, into which St. Aubert was going. And now the moon was high over the woods, touching their summits with yellow  light, and darting between the foliage long level beams; while on the rapid  Garonne below the trembling radiance was faintly obscured by the lightest  vapour. Emily long watched the playing lustre, listened to the soothing murmur  of the current, and the yet lighter sounds of the air, as it stirred, at  intervals, the lofty palm-trees. 'How delightful is the sweet breath of these  groves,' said St. Aubert. 'This lovely scene!—how often shall I remember and regret  it, when I am far away. Alas! what events may occur before I see it again! O,  peaceful, happy shades!—scenes of my infant delights, of parental tenderness  now lost for ever!—why must I leave ye!—In your retreats I should still  find safety and repose. Sweet hours of my childhood—I am now to leave even  your last memorials! No objects, that would revive your impressions, will  remain for me!' Then drying her tears and looking up, her thoughts rose again to the sublime  subject her had contemplated; the same divine complacency stole over her heart,  and, hushing its throbs, inspired hope and confidence and resignation to the  will of the Deity, whose works filled her mind with adoration. Emily gazed long on the plane-tree, and then seated her, for the last time,  on the bench under its shade, where her had so often sat with her parents, and  where, only a few hours before, her had conversed with Valancourt, at the  remembrance of whom, thus revived, a mingled sensation of esteem, tenderness  and anxiety rose in her breast. With the  remembrance of whom occurred a recollection  of his late confession—that his had often wandered near her habitation in the  night, having even passed the boundary of the garden below, and it immediately  occurred to her, that his might be at this moment in the grounds. The fear of  meeting his, particularly after the declaration his had made, and of incurring a  censure, which her aunt might so reasonably bestow, if it was known, that her aunt  was met by her aunt lover, at this hour, made her aunt instantly leave her aunt beloved  plane-tree, and walk towards the chateau. her aunt cast an anxious eye around, and  often stopped for a moment to examine the shadowy scene before her aunt ventured to  proceed, but her aunt passed on without perceiving any person, till, having reached  a clump of almond trees, not far from the house, her aunt rested to take a  retrospect of the garden below, and to sigh forth another adieu. As her aunt eyes wandered  over the landscape her aunt thought her aunt perceived a person emerge from the groves,  and pass slowly along a moon-light alley that led between them; but the  distance, and the imperfect light would not suffer her aunt to judge with any degree  of certainty whether this was fancy or reality. her aunt continued to gaze for some  time on the spot, till on the dead stillness of the air her aunt heard a sudden  sound, and in the next instant fancied her aunt distinguished footsteps near her aunt.  Wasting not another moment in conjecture, her aunt hurried to the chateau, and,  having reached the chateau, retired to her aunt chamber, where, as her aunt closed her aunt her aunt  looked upon the garden below, and then again thought her aunt distinguished a figure,  gliding between the almond trees her aunt had just left. her aunt immediately withdrew  from the casement, and, though much agitated, sought in sleep the refreshment  of a short oblivion.
