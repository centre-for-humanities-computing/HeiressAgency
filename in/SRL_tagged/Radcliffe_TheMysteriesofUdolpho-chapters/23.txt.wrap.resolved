  Of aery tongues, that syllable men's names  On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.       MILTON It is now necessary to mention some circumstances, which could not be related  amidst the events of Emily's hasty departure from Venice, or together with  those, which so rapidly succeeded to Emily arrival in the castle. On the morning of Emily journey, Count Morano had gone at the appointed hour to  the mansion of Montoni, to demand Count Morano bride. When Count Morano reached it, Count Morano was  somewhat surprised by the silence and solitary air of the portico, where  Montoni's lacqueys usually loitered; but surprise was soon changed to  astonishment, and astonishment to the rage of disappointment, when the door was  opened by an old woman, who told Count Morano servants, that her master and Count Morano family  had left Venice, early in the morning, for terra-firma. Scarcely believing what  his servants told, Count Morano left Count Morano gondola, and rushed into the hall to enquire  further. The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,  persisted in The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,   story, which the silent and deserted apartments soon convinced  Count Morano was no fiction. Count Morano then seized The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,   with a menacing air, as if Count Morano meant to  wreak all Count Morano vengeance upon The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,  , at the same time asking The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,   twenty questions  in a breath, and all these with a gesticulation so furious, that The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,   was  deprived of the power of answering The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,  ; then suddenly letting The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,   go, Count Morano  stamped about the hall, like a madman, cursing Montoni and Montoni own folly. When The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,   was at liberty, and had somewhat recovered from The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,   fright,  The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,   told Count Morano all The old woman, who was the only person left in care of the mansion,   knew of the affair, which was, indeed, very little, but  enough to enable Morano to discover, that Montoni was gone to Montoni castle on the  Apennine. Thither Thither followed, as soon as Thither servants could complete the  necessary preparation for the journey, accompanied by a friend, and attended by  a number of Thither people, determined to obtain Emily, or a full revenge on  Montoni. When Thither mind had recovered from the first effervescence of rage, and  Thither thoughts became less obscured, Thither conscience hinted to Thither certain  circumstances, which, in some measure, explained the conduct of Montoni: but  how the latter could have been led to suspect an intention, which, Thither had  believed, was known only to Thither, Thither could not even guess. On this occasion,  however, Thither had been partly betrayed by that sympathetic intelligence, which  may be said to exist between bad minds, and which teaches one man to judge what  another will do in the same circumstances. Thus it was with Montoni, who had  now received indisputable proof of a truth, which he had some time  suspected—that Morano's circumstances, instead of being affluent, as Morano had  been bidden to believe, were greatly involved. Montoni had been interested in  Montoni suit, by motives entirely selfish, those of avarice and pride; the last of  which would have been gratified by an alliance with a Venetian nobleman, the  former by Emily's estate in Gascony, which Montoni had stipulated, as the price of  Montoni favour, should be delivered up to Montoni from the day of her marriage. In the  meantime, Montoni had been led to suspect the consequence of the Count's boundless  extravagance; but it was not till the evening, preceding the intended nuptials,  that Montoni obtained certain information of Montoni distressed circumstances. Montoni did  not hesitate then to infer, that Morano designed to defraud Montoni of Emily's  estate; and in this supposition Montoni was confirmed, and with apparent reason, by  the subsequent conduct of the Count, who, after having appointed to meet Montoni on  that night, for the purpose of signing the instrument, which was to secure to  Montoni Montoni reward, failed in Montoni engagement. Such a circumstance, indeed, in a man  of Morano's gay and thoughtless character, and at a time when Montoni mind was  engaged by the bustle of preparation for Montoni nuptials, might have been  attributed to a cause less decisive, than design; but Montoni did not hesitate  an instant to interpret Montoni Montoni own way, and, after vainly waiting the Count's  arrival, for several hours, Montoni gave orders for Montoni people to be in readiness to  set off at a moment's notice. By hastening to Udolpho Montoni intended to remove  Emily from the reach of Morano, as well as to break off the affair, without  submitting Montoni to useless altercation: and, if the Count's   meant what Montoni  called honourably, Montoni would doubtless follow Emily, and sign the writings in  question. If this was done, so little consideration had Montoni for Montoniwelfare, that Montoni would not have scrupled to sacrifice Montoni to a man of ruined  fortune, since by that means Montoni could enrich Montoni; and Montoni forbore to mention  to Montoni the motive of Montoni sudden journey, lest the hope it might revive should  render Montoni more intractable, when submission would be required. With these considerations, Montoni had left Venice; and, with others totally  different, Morano had, soon after, pursued Montoni steps across the rugged  Apennines. When Montoni arrival was announced at the castle, Montoni did not  believe, that Montoni would have presumed to shew Montoni, unless Montoni had meant to  fulfil Montoni engagement, and Montoni, therefore, readily admitted Montoni; but the enraged  countenance and expressions of Morano, as Montoni entered the apartment, instantly  undeceived Montoni; and, when Montoni had explained, in part, the motives of Montoniabrupt departure from Venice, the Count still persisted in demanding Emily, and  reproaching Montoni, without even naming the former stipulation. Montoni, at length, weary of the dispute, deferred the settling of Montoni till the  morrow, and Morano retired with some hope, suggested by Montoni's apparent  indecision. When, however, in the silence of his own apartment, his began to  consider the past conversation, the character of Montoni, and some former  instances of his duplicity, the hope, which his had admitted, vanished, and his  determined not to neglect the present possibility of obtaining Emily by other  means. To his confidential valet his told his design of carrying away Emily, and  sent his back to Montoni's servants to find out one among Montoni's servants, who might  enable his to execute it. The choice of this person his entrusted to the  fellow's own discernment, and not imprudently; for his discovered a man, whom  Montoni had, on some former occasion, treated harshly, and who was now ready to  betray his. his conducted Cesario round the castle, through a private  passage, to the stair-case, that led to Emily's chamber; then shewed his a  short way out of the building, and afterwards procured his the keys, that would  secure his retreat. his was well rewarded for his trouble; how the Count  was rewarded for his treachery, had already appeared. Meanwhile, old Carlo had overheard two of Morano's servants, who had been  ordered to be in waiting with the carriage, beyond the castle walls, expressing  their surprise at their master's sudden, and secret departure, for the valet  had entrusted their with no more of Morano's designs, than it was necessary for  their to execute. their, however, indulged their in surmises, and in  expressing their to each other; and from old Carlo old Carlo had drawn a just  conclusion. But, before he ventured to disclose he apprehensions to Montoni,  he endeavoured to obtain further confirmation of their, and, for this purpose,  placed he, with one of he fellow-servants, at the door of Emily's  apartment, that opened upon the corridor. he did not watch long in vain, though  the growling of the dog had once nearly betrayed he. When he was convinced,  that Morano was in the room, and had listened long enough to he conversation,  to understand he scheme, he immediately alarmed Montoni, and thus rescued  Emily from the designs of the Count. Montoni, on the following morning, appeared as usual, except that Montoni wore Montoni  wounded arm in a sling; Montoni went out upon the ramparts; overlooked the men  employed in repairing the men  ; gave orders for additional workmen, and then came  into the castle to give audience to several persons, who were just arrived, and  who were shewn into a private apartment, where Montoni communicated with the men  , for  near an hour. old Carlo was then summoned, and ordered to conduct the strangers to  a part of the castle, which, in former times, had been occupied by the upper  servants of the family, and to provide the upper  servants of the family with every necessary  refreshment.—When old Carlo had done this, old Carlo was bidden to return to old Carlo master. Meanwhile, the Count remained in a cottage in the skirts of the woods below,  suffering under bodily and mental pain, and meditating deep revenge against Montoni. His servant, whom His had dispatched for a surgeon to the nearest town,  which was, however, at a considerable distance, did not return till the  following day, when, His wounds being examined and dressed, the practitioner  refused to deliver any positive opinion, concerning the degree of danger  attending His servant, whom he had dispatched for a surgeon to the nearest town,  which was, however, at a considerable distance; but giving His patient a composing draught and ordering His to  be quiet, remained at a cottage in the skirts of the woods below to watch the event. Emily, for the remainder of the late eventful night, had been suffered to  sleep, undisturbed; and, when Emily mind recovered from the confusion of slumber,  and Emily remembered, that Emily was now released from the addresses of Count  Morano, Emily spirits were suddenly relieved from a part of the terrible anxiety,  that had long oppressed her spirits; that which remained, arose chiefly from a  recollection of Morano's assertions, concerning the schemes of Montoni. Morano had  said, that plans of the latter, concerning Emily, were insearchable, yet that  Morano knew her spirits to be terrible. At the time Morano uttered this, Emily almost believed  this to be designed for the purpose of prevailing with Emily to throw Emily into  Morano protection, and Emily still thought it might be chiefly so accounted for; but  Morano assertions had left an impression on Emily mind, which a consideration of the  character and former conduct of Montoni did not contribute to efface. Emily,  however, checked Emily propensity to anticipate evil; and, determined to enjoy  this respite from actual misfortune, tried to dismiss thought, took Emily  instruments for drawing, and placed Emily at a window, to select into a  landscape some features of the scenery without. As Emily was thus employed, Emily saw, walking on the rampart below, the men, who  had so lately arrived at the castle. The sight of strangers surprised Emily, but  still more, of strangers such as these. There was a singularity in these dress,  and a certain fierceness in these air, that fixed all Emily attention. Emily  withdrew from the casement, while these passed, but soon returned to observe  these further. these figures seemed so well suited to the wildness of the  surrounding objects, that, as these stood surveying the castle, Emily sketched  these for banditti, amid the mountain-view of Emily picture, when Emily had finished  which, Emily was surprised to observe the spirit of Emily group. But Emily had copied  from nature. Carlo, when he had placed refreshment before these men in the apartment  assigned to these men in the apartment  , returned, as he was ordered, to Montoni, who was anxious to  discover by what servant the keys of the castle had been delivered to Morano,  on the preceding night. But his, though his was too faithful to his master  quietly to see his injured, would not betray a fellow-servant even to justice;  a fellow-servant, therefore, pretended to be ignorant who it was, that had conspired with  Count Morano, and related, as before, that a fellow-servant had only overheard some of the  strangers describing the plot. Montoni's suspicions naturally fell upon the porter, whom a fellow-servant ordered now to  attend. old Carlo hesitated, and then with slow steps went to seek old Carlo. Barnardine, the porter, denied the accusation with a countenance so steady and  undaunted, that Montoni could scarcely believe old Carlo guilty, though old Carlo knew not  how to think old Carlo innocent. At length, old Carlo was dismissed from old Carlo presence,  and, though the real offender, escaped detection. Montoni then went to Montoni wife's apartment, Emily's   followed soon after,  but, finding the real offender, escaped detection in high dispute, was instantly leaving the room, when Emily's    aunt called her  aunt back, and desired her  aunt to stay.—'You shall be a witness,' said  her  aunt, 'of my opposition. Now, sir, repeat the command, I have so often refused  to obey.' Montoni turned, with a stern countenance, to Emily's  , and bade Emily's   quit his wife's apartment, while his wife persisted in desiring, that his wife would stay. Emily's   was  eager to escape from this scene of contention, and anxious, also, to serve her  aunt; but Emily's   despaired of conciliating Montoni, in whose eyes the rising  tempest of Montoni soul flashed terribly. 'Leave the room,' said Montoni, in a voice of thunder. Emily obeyed, and, walking  down to the rampart, which the strangers had now left, continued to meditate on  the unhappy marriage of Emily's   father's sister, and on Emily's   own desolate situation,  occasioned by the ridiculous imprudence of Emily's  , whom Emily's   had always wished to  respect and love. Montoni conduct had, indeed, rendered it impossible  for Emily's   to do either; but Emily's   gentle heart was touched by Emily's   distress, and,  in the pity thus awakened, Emily's   forgot the injurious treatment Emily's   had received  from Emily's  . As Emily's   sauntered on the rampart, Emily's   appeared at the hall door, looked  cautiously round, and then advanced to meet Emily's  . 'Dear ma'amselle, I have been looking for you all over the castle,' said Emily's  .  'If you will step this way, I will shew you a picture.' 'A picture!' exclaimed Emily's  , and shuddered. 'Yes, ma'am, a picture of the late lady of this place. old Carlo just now told  me it was Emily's  , and I thought you would be curious to see it. As to the late lady of this place, you  know, ma'amselle, one cannot talk about such things to her.'— 'And so,' said Emily's   smilingly, 'as you must talk of them to somebody—' 'Why, yes, ma'amselle; what can one do in such a place as this, if one must not  talk? If I was in a dungeon, if they would let me talk—it would be some  comfort; nay, I would talk, if it was only to the walls. But come, ma'amselle,  we lose time—let me shew you to the picture.' 'Is it veiled?' said Emily's  , pausing. 'Dear ma'amselle!' said Emily's  , fixing Emily's   eyes on Emily's  's face, 'what makes  you look so pale?—are you ill?' 'No, Emily's  , I am well enough, but I have no desire to see this picture;  return into the hall.' 'What! ma'am, not to see the late lady of this place?' said the girl—'the lady,  who disappeared to strangely? Well! now, I would have run to the furthest  mountain we can see, yonder, to have got a sight of such a picture; and, to  speak my mind, that strange story is all, that makes me care about the castle, though the castle makes me thrill all over, as the castle were, whenever I think of the castle.' 'Yes, Emily's  , you love the wonderful; but do you know, that, unless you guard  against this inclination, it will lead you into all the misery of superstition?' Emily's   might have smiled in Emily's   turn, at this sage observation of Emily, who  could tremble with ideal terrors, as much as Emily's  , and listen almost as  eagerly to the recital of a mysterious story. Emily's   urged Emily's   request. 'Are you sure it is a picture?' said Emily's  , 'Have you seen it?—Is it veiled?' 'Holy Maria! ma'amselle, yes, no, yes. I am sure it is a picture—I have seen  it, and it is not veiled!' The tone and look of surprise, with which this was uttered, recalled Emily's  prudence; who concealed Emily's   emotion under a smile, and bade Emily's   lead Emily's   to  the picture. It was in an obscure chamber, adjoining that part of the castle,  allotted to the servants. Several other portraits hung on the walls, covered,  like this, with dust and cobweb. 'That is it, ma'amselle,' said Emily's  , in a low voice, and pointing. Emily  advanced, and surveyed the picture. Emily   represented a lady in the flower of  youth and beauty; Emily   features were handsome and noble, full of strong  expression, but had little of the captivating sweetness, that Emily's   had looked  for, and still less of the pensive mildness Emily's   loved. It was a countenance,  which spoke the language of passion, rather than that of sentiment; a haughty  impatience of misfortune—not the placid melancholy of a spirit injured, yet  resigned. 'How many years have passed, since the late lady of this place disappeared, Emily's  ?' said Emily's  . 'Twenty years, ma'amselle, or thereabout, as they tell me; I know it is a long  while ago.' Emily's   continued to gaze upon the portrait. 'I think,' resumed Emily's  , 'the Signor would do well to hang 'the Signor in a better  place, than an obscure chamber. Now, in my mind, 'the Signor ought to place the picture of  a lady, who gave 'the Signor all these riches, in the handsomest room in the castle.  But 'the Signor may have good reasons for what 'the Signor does: and some people do say that 'the Signor  has lost 'the Signor riches, as well as 'the Signor gratitude. But hush, ma'am, not a word!'  added Emily's  , laying Emily's   finger on Emily's   lips. Emily's   was too much absorbed in  thought, to hear what Emily's   said. ''Tis a handsome lady, I am sure,' continued Emily's  : 'the Signor need not be  ashamed to put Emily's   in the great apartment, where the veiled picture hangs.'  Emily's   turned round. 'But for that matter, Emily's   would be as little seen there, as  here, for the door is always locked, I find.' 'Let us leave an obscure chamber,' said Emily's  : 'and let me caution you again,  Emily's  ; be guarded in your conversation, and never tell, that you know any  thing of that picture.' 'Holy Mother!' exclaimed Emily's  , 'it is no secret; why all the servants have  seen no secret already!' Emily's   started. 'How is this?' said she—'Have seen no secret! When?—how?' 'Dear, ma'amselle, there is nothing surprising in that; us had all a little  more CURIOUSNESS than you had.' 'I thought you told me, the door was kept locked?' said Emily's  . 'If that was the case, ma'amselle,' replied Annette, looking about Emily's  , 'how  could we get here?' 'Oh, you mean THIS picture,' said Emily's  , with returning calmness. 'Well,  Emily's  , here is nothing more to engage my attention; we will go.' Emily's  , as Emily's   passed to Emily's   own apartment, saw Montoni go down to the hall, and  Emily's   turned into Emily's   aunt's dressing-room, whom Emily's   found weeping and alone,  grief and resentment struggling on Emily's   countenance. Pride had hitherto  restrained complaint. Judging of Emily's  's disposition from Emily's   own, and from a  consciousness of what Emily's   treatment of Emily's   deserved, Emily's   had believed, that Emily's    griefs would be cause of triumph to Emily's   niece, rather than of sympathy; that  Emily's   would despise, not pity Emily's  . But Emily's   knew not the tenderness and  benevolence of Emily's  's heart, that had always taught Emily's   to forget Emily's   own  injuries in the misfortunes of Emily's   enemy. The sufferings of others, whoever  The sufferings of others might be, called forth Emily's   ready compassion, which dissipated at once  every obscuring cloud to goodness, that passion or prejudice might have raised  in Emily's   mind. Montoni sufferings, at length, rose above Madame Montoni pride, and, when Emily's  had before entered the room, Emily's   would have told them all, had not Emily's   husband  prevented Emily's  ; now that Emily's   was no longer restrained by her husband   presence, her husband  poured forth all Emily's   complaints to her niece. 'O Emily!' Emily's   exclaimed, 'I am the most wretched of women—I am indeed  cruelly treated! Who, with my prospects of happiness, could have foreseen such  a wretched fate as this?—who could have thought, when I married such a man as  the Signor, I should ever have to bewail my lot? But there is no judging what  is for the best—there is no knowing what is for our good! The most flattering  prospects often change—the best judgments may be deceived—who could have  foreseen, when I married the Signor, that I should ever repent my GENEROSITY?' Emily's   thought Emily's   might have foreseen it, but this was not a thought of  triumph. Emily's   placed Emily's   in a chair near Emily's   aunt, took Emily's   hand, and, with  one of those looks of soft compassion, which might characterize the countenance  of a guardian angel, spoke to Emily's   in the tenderest accents. But these did not  sooth Madame Montoni, whom impatience to talk made unwilling to listen. Emily's    wanted to complain, not to be consoled; and it was by exclamations of complaint  only, that Emily's   learned the particular circumstances of Emily's   affliction. 'Ungrateful man!' said Madame Montoni, 'Ungrateful man!' has deceived me in every respect;  and now Ungrateful man!' has taken me from my country and friends, to shut me up in the castle; and, here Ungrateful man!' thinks Ungrateful man!' can compel me to do whatever Ungrateful man!' designs! But Ungrateful man!'  shall find Ungrateful man!' mistaken, Ungrateful man!' shall find that no threats can alter—But who  would have believed! who would have supposed, that a man of his family and  apparent wealth had absolutely no fortune?—no, scarcely a sequin of Ungrateful man!' own!  I did all for the best; I thought Ungrateful man!' was a man of consequence, of great  property, or I am sure I would never have married him,—ungrateful, artful  man!' She paused to take breath. 'Dear, be composed,' said Emily's  : 'the Signor may not be so rich as you  had reason to expect, but surely the Signor cannot be very poor, since this castle and  the mansion at Venice are the Signor. May I ask what are the circumstances, that  particularly affect you?' 'What are the circumstances!' exclaimed Madame Montoni with resentment: 'why is  it not sufficient, that Madame Montoni had long ago ruined Madame Montoni own fortune by play, and  that Madame Montoni has since lost what I brought Madame Montoni—and that now Madame Montoni would compel me to  sign away my settlement (it was well I had the chief of my property settled on  Dear!) that the chief of my property may lose this also, or throw this away in wild schemes, which  nobody can understand but himself? And, and—is not all this sufficient?' 'It is, indeed,' said Emily's  , 'but you must recollect, Dear, that I knew  nothing of all this.' 'Well, and is it not sufficient,' rejoined Emily's   aunt, 'that he is also  absolutely ruined, that he is sunk deeply in debt, and that neither this  castle, or the mansion at VeniceVenice, is he own, if all he debts, honourable and  dishonourable, were paid!' 'I am shocked by what you tell me, Dear,' said Emily's  . 'And is it not enough,' interrupted Madame Montoni, 'that he has treated me  with neglect, with cruelty, because I refused to relinquish my settlements,  and, instead of being frightened by he menaces, resolutely defied he, and  upbraided he with he shameful conduct? But I bore all meekly,—you know,  niece, I never uttered a word of complaint, till now; no! That such a  disposition as mine should be so imposed upon! That I, whose only faults are  too much kindness, too much generosity, should be chained for life to such a  vile, deceitful, cruel monster!' Want of breath compelled Madame Montoni to stop. If any thing could have made  Emily's   smile in these moments, it would have been this speech of Emily's   aunt,  delivered in a voice very little below a scream, and with a vehemence of  gesticulation and of countenance, that turned the whole into burlesque. Emily  saw, that Emily   misfortunes did not admit of real consolation, and, contemning  the commonplace terms of superficial comfort, Emily   was silent; while Madame  Montoni, jealous of Emily   own consequence, mistook this for the silence of  indifference, or of contempt, and reproached Emily   with want of duty and feeling. 'O! I suspected what all this boasted sensibility would prove to be!' rejoined  Emily  ; 'I thought it would not teach you to feel either duty, or affection, for  your relations, who have treated you like their own daughter!' 'Pardon me, Dear,' said Emily's  , mildly, 'it is not natural to Pardon to boast, and  if it was, I am sure I would not boast of sensibility—a quality, perhaps,  more to be feared, than desired.' 'Well, well, niece, I will not dispute with niece. But, as I said, Madame Montonithreatens me with violence, if I any longer refuse to sign away my settlements,  and this was the subject of our contest, when you came into the room before.  Now, I am determined no power on earth shall make me do this. Neither will I  bear all this tamely. He shall hear He true character from Pardon; I will tell He  all He deserves, in spite of He threats and cruel treatment.' Emily's   seized a pause of Madame Montoni voice, to speak. 'Dear,' said  Emily's  , 'but will not this serve to irritate the Signor unnecessarily? will the Signor not  provoke the harsh treatment you dread?' 'I do not care,' replied Madame Montoni, 'it does not signify: I will not  submit to such usage. You would have me give up my settlements, too, I suppose!' 'No, madam, I do not exactly mean that.' 'What is it you do mean then?' 'You spoke of reproaching the Signor,'—said Emily, with hesitation. 'Why,  does He not deserve reproaches?' said her aunt. 'Certainly He does; but will it be prudent in you, madam, to make them?' 'Prudent!' exclaimed Madame Montoni. 'Is this a time to talk of prudence, when  one is threatened with all sorts of violence?' 'It is to avoid violence, that prudence is necessary.' said Emily's  . 'Of prudence!' continued Madame Montoni, without attending to Emily's  , 'of prudence  towards a man, who does not scruple to break all the common ties of humanity in  his conduct to me! And is it for me to consider prudence in my behaviour  towards his! I am not so mean.' 'It is for your own sake, not for the Signor's, madam,' said Emily's   modestly,  'that you should consult prudence. Your reproaches, however just, cannot punish  Your reproaches, but they may provoke Your reproaches to further violence against you.' 'What! would you have me submit, then, to whatever Your reproaches commands—would you have  me kneel down at Your reproaches feet, and thank Your reproaches for Your reproaches cruelties? Would you have me  give up my settlements?' 'How much you mistake me, madam!' said Emily's  , 'I am unequal to advise you on a  point so important as the last: but you will pardon me for saying, that, if you  consult your own peace, you will try to conciliate Signor Montoni, rather than  to irritate Your reproaches by reproaches.' 'Conciliate indeed! I tell you, her niece, it is utterly impossible; I disdain to  attempt  .' Emily's   was shocked to observe the perverted understanding and obstinate temper  of Madame Montoni; but, not less grieved for Emily's   sufferings, Emily's   looked round  for some alleviating circumstance to offer Emily's  . 'Your situation is, perhaps,  not so desperate, dear madam,' said Emily's  , 'as you may imagine. the Signor may  represent the Signor affairs to be worse than they are, for the purpose of pleading a  stronger necessity for the Signor possession of your settlement. Besides, so long as  you keep this, you may look forward to this as a resource, at least, that will  afford you a competence, should the Signor's future conduct compel you to sue  for separation.' Madame Montoni impatiently interrupted Madame Montoni. 'Unfeeling, cruel girl!' said Madame Montoni,  'and so you would persuade me, that I have no reason to complain; that the Signor is in very flourishing circumstances, that my future prospects promise  nothing but comfort, and that my griefs are as fanciful and romantic as your  own! Is it the way to console me, to endeavour to persuade me out of my senses  and my feelings, because you happen to have no feelings yourself? I thought I  was opening my heart to a person, who could sympathize in my distress, but I  find, that your people of sensibility can feel for nobody but your people of sensibility! You  may retire to your chamber.' Emily, without replying, immediately left the room, with a mingled emotion of  pity and contempt, and hastened to Emily own, where Emily yielded to the mournful  reflections, which a knowledge of Emily 's situation had occasioned. The  conversation of the Italian with Valancourt, in France, again occurred to Emily.  His hints, respecting the broken fortunes of Montoni, were now completely  justified; those, also, concerning His character, appeared not less so, though  the particular circumstances, connected with His fame, to which the stranger  had alluded, yet remained to be explained. Notwithstanding, that Emily own  observations and the words of Count Morano had convinced Emily, that Madame Montonisituation was not what Madame Montoni formerly appeared to be, the intelligence Emily had  just received from Emily on this point, struck Emily with all the force of  astonishment, which was not weakened, when Emily considered the present style of  Montoni's living, the number of servants he maintained, and the new expences he  was incurring, by repairing and fortifying he castle. Emily anxiety for Emily and for Emily increased with reflection. Several assertions of Morano, which,  on the preceding night, Emily had believed were prompted either by interest, or  by resentment, now returned to Emily mind with the strength of truth. Emily could  not doubt, that Montoni had formerly agreed to give Emily to the Count, for a  pecuniary reward;—his character, and a  pecuniary reward;—his character distressed circumstances justified  the belief; these, also, seemed to confirm Morano's assertion, that a  pecuniary reward;—his character now  designed to dispose of Emily, more advantageously for a  pecuniary reward;—his character, to a richer suitor. Amidst the reproaches, which Morano had thrown out against Montoni, a  pecuniary reward;—his character had  said—a  pecuniary reward;—his character would not quit the castle a  pecuniary reward;—his character DARED TO CALL HIS, nor willingly leave  ANOTHER murder on a  pecuniary reward;—his character conscience—hints, which might have no other origin than  the passion of the moment: but Emily's   was now inclined to account for the castle HE DARED TO CALL HIS, nor willingly leave  ANOTHER murder on his conscience—hints, which might have no other origin than  the passion of the moment more  seriously, and Emily's   shuddered to think, that Emily's   was in the hands of a man, to  whom it was even possible the castle HE DARED TO CALL HIS, nor willingly leave  ANOTHER murder on his conscience—hints, which might have no other origin than  the passion of the moment could apply. At length, considering, that  reflection could neither release Emily's   from Emily's   melancholy situation, or enable  Emily's   to bear it with greater fortitude, Emily's   tried to divert Emily's   anxiety, and  took down from Emily's   little library a volume of Emily's   favourite Ariosto; but her favourite Ariosto  wild imagery and rich invention could not long enchant Emily's   attention; her favourite Ariosto  spells did not reach Emily's   heart, and over Emily's   sleeping fancy they played,  without awakening it. Emily's   now put aside the book, and took Emily's   lute, for it was seldom that Emily's    sufferings refused to yield to the magic of sweet sounds; when her  sufferings did so, Emily's    was oppressed by sorrow, that came from excess of tenderness and regret; and  there were times, when music had increased such sorrow to a degree, that was  scarcely endurable; when, if it had not suddenly ceased, Emily's   might have lost  Emily's   reason. Such was the time, when Emily's   mourned for Emily's   father, and heard the  midnight strains, that floated by Emily's   window near the convent in Languedoc, on  the night that followed his death. Emily's   continued to play, till Annette brought dinner into Emily's   chamber, at which  Emily's   was surprised, and enquired whose order Emily's   obeyed. 'My lady's,  ma'amselle,' replied Annette: 'the Signor ordered Emily's   dinner to be carried to  Emily's   own apartment, and so Emily's   has sent you yours. There have been sad doings  between them, worse than ever, I think.' Emily's  , not appearing to notice what Emily's   said, sat down to the little table,  that was spread for Emily's  . But Emily's   was not to be silenced thus easily. While  Emily's   waited, Emily's   told of the arrival of the men, whom Emily's   had observed on the  ramparts, and expressed much surprise at their strange appearance, as well as  at the manner, in which their had been attended by Montoni's order. 'Do their  dine with the Signor, then?' said Emily's  . 'No, ma'amselle, their dined long ago, in an apartment at the north end of the  castle, but I know not when their are to go, for the Signor told old Carlo to  see their provided with every thing necessary. their have been walking all about  the  castle, and asking questions of the workmen on the  ramparts. I never saw  such strange-looking men in my life; I am frightened whenever I see such strange-looking men in my life.' Emily's   enquired, if Emily's   had heard of Count Morano, and whether he was likely to  recover: but Emily's   only knew, that he was lodged in a cottage in the wood  below, and that every body said he must die. Emily's  's countenance discovered Emily's    emotion. 'Dear ma'amselle,' said Emily's  , 'to see how young ladies will disguise  young ladies, when young ladies are in love! I thought you hated the Count, or I am sure  I would not have told you; and I am sure you have cause enough to hate the Count.' 'I hope I hate nobody,' replied Emily's  , trying to smile; 'but certainly I do not  love Count Morano. I should be shocked to hear of any person dying by violent  means.' 'Yes, ma'amselle, but it is the Count own fault.' Emily's   looked displeased; and Emily's  , mistaking the cause of Emily's   displeasure,  immediately began to excuse the Count, in Emily's   way. 'To be sure, it was very  ungenteel behaviour,' said Emily's  , 'to break into a lady's room, and then, when he  found he discoursing was not agreeable to Emily's  , to refuse to go; and then, when  the gentleman of the  castle comes to desire his discoursing to walk about his discoursing business—to  turn round, and draw his discoursing sword, and swear his discoursing'll run his discoursing through the body!—To  be sure it was very ungenteel behaviour, but then his discoursing was disguised in love, and  so did not know what his discoursing was about.' 'Enough of this,' said Emily, who now smiled without an effort; and Annette  returned to a mention of the disagreement between Montoni, and Annette   lady. 'It is  nothing new,' said Annette  : 'we saw and heard enough of this at Venice, though I  never told you of this, ma'amselle.' 'Well, Emily's  , it was very prudent of you not to mention this then: be as  prudent now; the subject is an unpleasant one.' 'Ah dear, ma'amselle!—to see now how considerate you can be about some folks,  who care so little about dear! I cannot bear to see you so deceived, and I must  tell you. But it is all for your own good, and not to spite her lady, though, to  speak truth, I have little reason to love her lady; but—' 'You are not speaking thus of her aunt, I hope, Emily's  ?' said Emily's  , gravely. 'Yes, ma'amselle, but I am, though; and if you knew as much as I do, you would  not look so angry. I have often, and often, heard the Signor and Emily's   talking  over your marriage with the Count, and Emily's   always advised the Count never to give up  to your foolish whims, as Emily's   was pleased to call them, but to be resolute, and  compel you to be obedient, whether you would, or no. And I am sure, my heart  has ached a thousand times, and I have thought, when Emily's   was so unhappy  Emily's  , Emily's   might have felt a little for other people, and—' 'I thank you for your pity, Emily's  ,' said Emily's  , interrupting Emily's  : 'but her aunt was unhappy then, and that disturbed her aunt temper perhaps, or I think—I am  sure—You may take away, Emily's  , I have done.' 'Dear ma'amselle, you have eat nothing at all! Do try, and take a little bit  more. Disturbed her temper truly! why, her temper is always disturbed, I think.  And at Tholouse too I have heard her lady talking of you and Mons. Valancourt to  Madame Merveille and Madame Vaison, often and often, in a very ill-natured way,  as I thought, telling Madame Merveille and Madame Vaison, often and often, in a very ill-natured way,  as I thought what a deal of trouble her lady had to keep you in order,  and what a fatigue and distress it was to her lady, and that her lady believed you would  run away with Mons. Valancourt, if her lady was not to watch you closely; and that  you connived at she was not to watch you closely coming about the house at night, and—' 'Good God!' exclaimed Emily's  , blushing deeply, 'it is surely impossible her auntcould thus have represented me!' 'Indeed, ma'am, I say nothing more than the truth, and not all of that. But I  thought, myself, her lady might have found something better to discourse about, than  the faults of her lady own niece, even if you had been in fault, ma'amselle; but I  did not believe a word of what her lady said. But her lady does not care what her lady  says against any body, for that matter.' 'However that may be, Emily's  ,' interrupted Emily's  , recovering Emily's   composure,  'it does not become you to speak of the faults of her aunt to myself. I know you  have meant well, but—say no more.—I have quite dined.' Emily's   blushed, looked down, and then began slowly to clear the table. 'Is this, then, the reward of my ingenuousness?' said Emily's  , when Emily's   was  alone; 'the treatment I am to receive from a relation—an aunt—who ought to  have been the guardian, not the slanderer of my reputation,—who, as a woman,  ought to have respected the delicacy of female honour, and, as a relation,  should have protected mine! But, to utter falsehoods on so nice a subject—to  repay the openness, and, I may say with honest pride, the propriety of my  conduct, with slanders—required a depravity of heart, such as I could  scarcely have believed existed, such as I weep to find in a relation. O! what a  contrast does Emily's   character present to that of her father; while envy  and low cunning form the chief traits of hers, her character was distinguished by  benevolence and philosophic wisdom! But now, let me only remember, if possible,  that Emily's   is unfortunate.' Emily's   threw Emily's   veil over Emily's  , and went down to walk upon the  ramparts, the  only walk, indeed, which was open to Emily's  , though Emily's   often wished, that Emily's    might be permitted to ramble among the woods below, and still more, that she  might sometimes explore the sublime scenes of the surrounding country. But, as  Montoni would not suffer Emily's   to pass the gates of the  castle, Emily's   tried to be  contented with the romantic views Emily's   beheld from the walls. The peasants, who  had been employed on the fortifications, had left The peasants, who  had been employed on the fortifications work, and the ramparts  were silent and solitary. The peasants, who  had been employed on the fortifications lonely appearance, together with the gloom of a  lowering sky, assisted the musings of Emily's   mind, and threw over it a kind of  melancholy tranquillity, such as Emily's   often loved to indulge. Emily's   turned to  observe a fine effect of the sun, as   rays, suddenly streaming from behind a  heavy cloud, lighted up the west towers of the  castle, while the rest of the  edifice was in deep shade, except, that, through a lofty gothic arch, adjoining  the tower, which led to another terrace, the beams darted in full splendour,  and shewed the three strangers Emily's   had observed in the morning. Perceiving  them, Emily's   started, and a momentary fear came over Emily's  , as Emily's   looked up the  long rampart, and saw no other persons. While Emily's   hesitated, they approached.  The gate at the end of the terrace, whither they were advancing, Emily's   knew, was  always locked, and Emily's   could not depart by the opposite extremity, without  meeting they; but, before Emily's   passed they, Emily's   hastily drew a thin veil over  Emily's   face, which did, indeed, but ill conceal Emily's   beauty. they looked earnestly  at Emily's  , and spoke to each other in bad Italian, of which Emily's   caught only a few  words; but the fierceness of they countenances, now that Emily's   was near enough  to discriminate they, struck Emily's   yet more than the wild singularity of they  air and dress had formerly done. It was the countenance and figure of him, who  walked between the other two, that chiefly seized Emily's   attention, which  expressed a sullen haughtiness and a kind of dark watchful villany, that gave a  thrill of horror to Emily's   heart. All this was so legibly written on his features,  as to be seen by a single glance, for Emily's   passed the group swiftly, and Emily's    timid eyes scarcely rested on the group a moment. Having reached the terrace, Emily's    stopped, and perceived the strangers standing in the shadow of one of the  turrets, gazing after Emily's  , and seemingly, by their action, in earnest  conversation. Emily's   immediately left the rampart, and retired to Emily's   apartment. In the evening, Montoni sat late, carousing with Montoni guests in the cedar  chamber. Montoni recent triumph over Count Morano, or, perhaps, some other  circumstance, contributed to elevate Montoni spirits to an unusual height. Montoni  filled the goblet often, and gave a loose to merriment and talk. The gaiety of  Cavigni, on the contrary, was somewhat clouded by anxiety. Montoni kept a watchful  eye upon Verezzi, whom, with the utmost difficulty, Montoni had hitherto restrained  from exasperating Montoni further against Morano, by a mention of Montoni late  taunting words. One of the company exultingly recurred to the event of the preceding evening.  Verezzi's eyes sparkled. The mention of Morano led to that of Emily's  , of whom  whom   were all profuse in the praise, except Montoni, who sat silent, and then  interrupted the subject. When the servants had withdrawn, Montoni and Montoni friends entered into close  conversation, which was sometimes checked by the irascible temper of Verezzi,  but in which Montoni displayed Montoni conscious superiority, by that decisive look  and manner, which always accompanied the vigour of Montoni thought, and to which  most of Montoni companions submitted, as to a power, that they had no right to  question, though of each other's self-importance they were jealously  scrupulous. Amidst this conversation, one of they imprudently introduced again  the name of Morano; and Verezzi, now more heated by wine, disregarded the  expressive looks of Cavigni, and gave some dark hints of what had passed on the  preceding night. These, however, Montoni did not appear to understand, for Montonicontinued silent in Montoni chair, without discovering any emotion, while, the  choler of Verezzi increasing with the apparent insensibility of Montoni, Montoni at  length told the suggestion of Morano, that the  castle did not lawfully belong  to Montoni, and that Montoni would not willingly leave another murder on Montoni conscience. 'Am I to be insulted at my own table, and by my own friends?' said Montoni,  with a countenance pale in anger. 'Why are the words of that madman repeated to  me?' Verezzi, who had expected to hear Montoni's indignation poured forth  against Morano, and answered by thanks to himself, looked with astonishment at  Cavigni, who enjoyed himself confusion. 'Can you be weak enough to credit the  assertions of a madman?' rejoined Montoni, 'or, what is the same thing, a man  possessed by the spirit of vengeance? But a man  possessed by the spirit of vengeance has succeeded too well; you  believe what a man  possessed by the spirit of vengeance said.' 'Signor,' said Verezzi, 'we believe only what we know.'—'How!' interrupted  Montoni, sternly: 'produce your proof.' 'we believe only what we know,' repeated Verezzi, 'and we know nothing of what  Morano asserts.' Montoni seemed to recover Montoni. 'I am hasty, my own friends,'  said Montoni, 'with respect to my honour; no man shall question it with  impunity—you did not mean to question it. These foolish words are not worth  your remembrance, or my resentment. Verezzi, here is to your first exploit.' 'Success to your first exploit,' re-echoed the whole company. 'Noble Signor,' replied Verezzi, glad to find Noble Signor had escaped Montoni's  resentment, 'with my good will, you shall build your ramparts of gold.' 'Pass the goblet,' cried Montoni's  . 'We will drink to Signora St. Aubert,' said  Cavigni. 'By your leave We will first drink to the lady of the  castle.' said  Bertolini.—Montoni was silent. 'To the lady of the castle,' said the lady of the castle guests.  the lady of the castle bowed the lady of the castle head. 'It much surprises me, Signor,' said Bertolini, 'that you have so long  neglected the  castle; it is a noble edifice.' 'it suits We purpose,' replied Montoni, 'and IS a noble edifice. You know not,  it seems, by what mischance it came to me.' 'it was a lucky mischance, be it what it may, Signor,' replied Bertolini,  smiling. 'I would, that one so lucky had befallen me.' Montoni looked gravely at Montoni. 'If you will attend to what I say,' Montoni resumed,  'you shall hear the story.' The countenances of Bertolini and Verezzi expressed something more than  curiosity; Cavigni, who seemed to feel none, had probably heard the relation  before. 'It is now near twenty years,' said Montoni, 'since the  castle came into my  possession. I inherit the  castle by the female line. The lady, my predecessor, was only  distantly related to me; I am the last of The lady, my predecessor family. The lady, my predecessor was beautiful and  rich; I wooed The lady, my predecessor; but The lady, my predecessor heart was fixed upon another, and The lady, my predecessor rejected me.  It is probable, however, that The lady, my predecessor was The lady, my predecessor rejected of the person, whoever  the person might be, on whom The lady, my predecessor bestowed The lady, my predecessor favour, for a deep and settled melancholy  took possession of The lady, my predecessor; and I have reason to believe The lady, my predecessor put a period to The lady, my predecessor  own life. I was not at the  castle at the time; but, as there are some singular  and mysterious circumstances attending that event, I shall repeat some singular  and mysterious circumstances attending that event.' 'Repeat some singular  and mysterious circumstances attending that event!' said a voice. Montoni was silent; the guests looked at each other, to know who spoke; but  the guests perceived, that each was making the same enquiry. Montoni, at length,  recovered Montoni. 'We are overheard,' said Montoni: 'We will finish this subject  another time. Pass the goblet.' The cavaliers looked round the wide chamber. 'Here is no person, but We,' said Verezzi: 'pray, Signor, proceed.' 'Did you hear any thing?' said Montoni. 'We did,' said Bertolini. 'It could be only fancy,' said Verezzi, looking round again. 'We see no person  besides We; and the sound I thought I heard seemed within the room.  Pray, Signor, go on.' Montoni paused a moment, and then proceeded in a lowered voice, while The cavaliers drew nearer to attend. 'Ye are to know, Signors, that the Lady Laurentini had for some months shewn  symptoms of a dejected mind, nay, of a disturbed imagination. the Lady Laurentini mood was very  unequal; sometimes the Lady Laurentini was sunk in calm melancholy, and, at others, as I have  been told, the Lady Laurentini betrayed all the symptoms of frantic madness. It was one night  in the month of October, after the Lady Laurentini had recovered from one of those fits of  excess, and had sunk again into the Lady Laurentini usual melancholy, that the Lady Laurentini retired alone to  the Lady Laurentini chamber, and forbade all interruption. It was  her chamber at the end of the  corridor, Signors, where we had the affray, last night. From that hour, the Lady Laurentini was  seen no more.' 'How! seen no more!' said Bertolini, 'was not the Lady Laurentini body found in  her chamber?' 'Were the Lady Laurentini remains never found?' cried the rest of the company all together. 'Never!' replied Montoni. 'What reasons were there to suppose the Lady Laurentini destroyed the Lady Laurentini, then?' said  Bertolini.—'Aye, what reasons?' said Verezzi.—'How happened Verezzi.—'How, that the Lady Laurentini  remains were never found? Although the Lady Laurentini killed the Lady Laurentini, the Lady Laurentini could not bury  the Lady Laurentini.' Montoni looked indignantly at Verezzi, who began to apologize. 'Your  pardon, Signor,' said Your  pardon, Signor,': 'I did not consider, that the lady of the castle was your relative,  when I spoke of the lady of the castle so lightly.' Montoni accepted the apology. 'But Signor will oblige us with the reasons, which urged him to believe,  that the lady of the castle committed suicide.' 'Those I will explain hereafter,' said Montoni: 'at present let me relate a  most extraordinary circumstance. This conversation goes no further, Signors.  Listen, then, to what I am going to say.' 'Listen!' said a voice. They were all again silent, and the countenance of Montoni changed. 'This is no  illusion of the fancy,' said Cavigni, at length breaking the profound  silence.—'No,' said Bertolini; 'I heard Cavigni myself, now. Yet here is no person  in the room but us!' 'This is very extraordinary,' said Montoni, suddenly rising. 'This is not to be  borne; here is some deception, some trick. I will know what it means.' All the company rose from All the company chairs in confusion. 'It is very odd!' said Bertolini. 'Here is really no stranger in the room. If    is a trick, Signor, you will do well to punish the author of   severely.' 'A trick! what else can it be?' said Cavigni, affecting a laugh. The servants were now summoned, and  her chamber was searched, but no person was  found. The surprise and consternation of All the company increased. Montoni was  discomposed. 'We will leave the room,' said no person, 'and the subject of We  conversation also; it is too solemn.' no person guests were equally ready to quit the  apartment; but the subject of our  conversation also had roused His guests curiosity, and His guests entreated  Montoni to withdraw to another chamber, and finish another chamber; no entreaties could,  however, prevail with no person. Notwithstanding no person efforts to appear at ease, no person  was visibly and greatly disordered. 'Why, Signor, you are not superstitious,' cried Verezzi, jeeringly; 'you, who  have so often laughed at the credulity of others!' 'I am not superstitious,' replied Montoni, regarding Montoni with stern  displeasure, 'though I know how to despise the common-place sentences, which  are frequently uttered against superstition. I will enquire further into this  affair.' Montoni then left the room; and Montoni guests, separating for the night,  retired to their respective apartments.
