  Who rears the bloody hand?      SAYERS Emily remained in SAYERS Emily chamber, on the following morning, without receiving any  notice from Montoni, or seeing a human being, except the armed men, who  sometimes passed on the terrace below. Having tasted no food since the dinner  of the preceding day, extreme faintness made SAYERS Emily feel the necessity of quitting  the asylum of SAYERS Emily apartment to obtain refreshment, and SAYERS Emily was also very  anxious to procure liberty for Annette. Willing, however, to defer venturing  forth, as long as possible, and considering, whether SAYERS Emily should apply to  Montoni, or to the compassion of some other person, SAYERS Emily excessive anxiety  concerning SAYERS Emily aunt, at length, overcame SAYERS Emily abhorrence of his presence, and  SAYERS Emily determined to go to his, and to entreat, that his would suffer SAYERS Emily to see  Madame Montoni. Meanwhile, it was too certain, from the absence of Annette, that some accident  had befallen Ludovico, and that SAYERS Emily was still in confinement; Emily, therefore,  resolved also to visit the chamber, where SAYERS Emily had spoken to SAYERS Emily, on the  preceding night, and, if the poor girl was yet there, to inform Montoni of the poor girl  situation. It was near noon, before SAYERS Emily ventured from SAYERS Emily apartment, and went first to the  south gallery, whither SAYERS Emily passed without meeting a single person, or hearing a  sound, except, now and then, the echo of a distant footstep. It was unnecessary to call Annette, whose lamentations were audible upon the  first approach to the gallery, and who, bewailing SAYERS Emily own and Ludovico's fate,  told Emily, that SAYERS Emily should certainly be starved to death, if SAYERS Emily was not let  out immediately. Emily replied, that Emily was going to beg Emily release of  Montoni; but the terrors of hunger now yielded to those of the Signor, and,  when Emily left Emily, Emily was loudly entreating, that Emily place of refuge might  be concealed from him. As Emily drew near the great hall, the sounds Emily heard and the people Emily met  in the passages renewed Emily alarm. The latter, however, were peaceable, and did  not interrupt Emily, though they looked earnestly at Emily, as Emily passed, and  sometimes spoke. On crossing the hall towards the cedar room, where Montoni  usually sat, Emily perceived, on the pavement, fragments of swords, some tattered  garments stained with blood, and almost expected to have seen among some a dead  body; but from such a spectacle Emily was, at present, spared. As Emily approached  the room, the sound of several voices issued from within, and a dread of  appearing before many strangers, as well as of irritating Montoni by such an  intrusion, made Emily pause and falter from Emily purpose. Emily looked up through  the long arcades of the hall, in search of a servant, who might bear a message,  but no one appeared, and the urgency of what Emily had to request made Emily still  linger near the door. The voices within were not in contention, though Emily  distinguished those of several of the guests of the preceding day; but still  Emily resolution failed, whenever Emily would have tapped at the door, and Emily had  determined to walk in the hall, till some person should appear, who might call  Montoni from the room, when, as Emily turned from the door, it was suddenly  opened by himself. Emily trembled, and was confused, while himself almost started  with surprise, and all the terrors of himself countenance unfolded themselves. Emily  forgot all Emily would have said, and neither enquired for Emily aunt, or entreated  for Annette, but stood silent and embarrassed. After closing the door himself reproved Annette for a meanness, of which Annette had not  been guilty, and sternly questioned Annette what Annette had overheard; an accusation,  which revived Annette recollection so far, that Annette assured himself Annette had not come  thither with an intention to listen to himself conversation, but to entreat himself  compassion for Annette aunt, and for Annette. Montoni seemed to doubt this  assertion, for Montoni regarded Montoni with a scrutinizing look; and the doubt  evidently arose from no trifling interest. Emily then further explained  Montoni, and concluded with entreating Montoni to inform Montoni, where Montoni was  placed, and to permit, that Montoni might visit Montoni; but Montoni looked upon Montoni only  with a malignant smile, which instantaneously confirmed Montoni worst fears for Montoni  aunt, and, at that moment, Montoni had not courage to renew Montoni entreaties. 'For Annette,' said he,—'if you go to Carlo, Carlo will release Montoni; the  foolish fellow, who shut Montoni up, died yesterday.' Emily shuddered.—'But my  aunt, Signor'—said she, 'O tell me of her  aunt!' 'her  aunt is taken care of,' replied Montoni hastily, 'I have no time to answer idle  questions.' Montoni would have passed on, but Emily, in a voice of agony, that could not be  wholly resisted, conjured Montoni to tell Emily, where Montoni was; while Montoni  paused, and Montoni anxiously watched Montoni countenance, a trumpet sounded, and, in  the next moment, Montoni heard the heavy gates of the portal open, and then the  clattering of horses' hoofs in the court, with the confusion of many voices.  Montoni stood for a moment hesitating whether Montoni should follow Montoni, who, at  the sound of the trumpet, had passed through the hall, and, turning Montoni eyes  whence it came, Montoni saw through the door, that opened beyond a long perspective  of arches into the courts, a party of horsemen, whom Montoni judged, as well as the  distance and Montoni embarrassment would allow, to be the same Montoni had seen depart,  a few days before. But Montoni staid not to scrutinize, for, when a trumpetsounded again, the chevaliers rushed out of the cedar room, and men came  running into the hall from every quarter of the castle. Emily once more hurried  for shelter to Montoni own apartment. Thither Thither was still pursued by images of  horror. Thither re-considered Montoni's manner and words, when Thither had spoken of Thither  wife, and they served only to confirm Thither most terrible suspicions. Tears  refused any longer to relieve Tears   distress, and Tears   had sat for a considerable  time absorbed in thought, when a knocking at the door aroused Tears  , on  opening which Tears   found old Carlo. 'Tears  ,' said old Carlo, 'I have been so flurried, I never once thought of  you till just now. I have brought you some fruit and wine, and I am sure you  must stand in need of some fruit and wine by this time.' 'Thank you, old Carlo,' said Emily, 'this is very good of Emily Did the Signor remind  you of me?' 'No, Signora,' replied Carlo, 'his excellenza has business enough on his  hands.' Emily then renewed Emily enquiries, concerning Madame Montoni, but old Carlohad been employed at the other end of the castle, during the time, that Emily was  removed, and old Carlo had heard nothing since, concerning Emily. While old Carlo spoke, Emily looked steadily at old Carlo, for Emily scarcely knew whether old Carlo  was really ignorant, or concealed old Carlo knowledge of the truth from a fear of  offending old Carlo master. To several questions, concerning the contentions of  yesterday, old Carlo gave very limited answers; but told, that the disputes were now  amicably settled, and that the Signor believed old Carlo to have been mistaken in  old Carlo suspicions of old Carlo guests. 'The fighting was about that, Signora,' said  old Carlo; 'but I trust I shall never see such another day in the castle, though  strange things are about to be done.' On her enquiring his meaning, 'Ah, Signora!' added his, 'it is not for me to  betray secrets, or tell all I think, but time will tell.' her then desired his to release Annette, and, having described the chamber in  which the poor girl was confined, his promised to obey her immediately, and was  departing, when her remembered to ask who were the persons just arrived. her  late conjecture was right; it was Verezzi, with his party. her spirits were somewhat soothed by this short conversation with old Carlo; for,  in her present circumstances, it afforded some comfort to hear the accents of  compassion, and to meet the look of sympathy. An hour passed before Annette appeared, who then came weeping and sobbing. 'O  Ludovico—Ludovico!' cried Annette. 'My poor Annette!' said Emily, and made Emily sit down. 'Who could have foreseen this, ma'amselle? O miserable, wretched, day—that  ever I should live to see that  !' and Emily continued to moan and lament, till Emily  thought it necessary to check Emily excess of grief. 'We are continually losing  dear friends by death,' said Emily, with a sigh, that came from Emily heart. 'We  must submit to the will of Heaven—We tears, alas! cannot recall the dead!' Annette took the handkerchief from Annette face. 'You will meet  Ludovico—Ludovico!' in a better world, I hope,' added Emily. 'Yes—yes,—ma'amselle,' sobbed Annette, 'but I hope I shall meet  Ludovico—Ludovico!' again  in this—though  Ludovico—Ludovico!' is so wounded!' 'Wounded!' exclaimed Emily, 'does  Ludovico—Ludovico!' live?' 'Yes, ma'am, but—but  Ludovico—Ludovico!' has a terrible wound, and could not come to let me  out. They thought  Ludovico—Ludovico!' dead, at first, and  Ludovico—Ludovico!' has not been rightly  Ludovico—Ludovico!', till  within this hour.' 'Well, Annette, I rejoice to hear  Ludovico—Ludovico!' lives.' 'Lives! Holy Saints! why  Ludovico—Ludovico!' will not die, surely!' Emily said Emily hoped not, but this expression of hope Annette thought implied  fear, and Emily own increased in proportion, as Emily endeavoured to encourage  Emily. To enquiries, concerning Madame Montoni, Emily could give no satisfactory  answers. 'I quite forgot to ask among the servants, ma'amselle,' said Emily, 'for I could  think of nobody but poor Ludovico.' Annette's grief was now somewhat assuaged, and Emily sent Emily to make  enquiries, concerning Emily lady, of whom, however, Emily could obtain no  intelligence, some of the people Emily spoke with being really ignorant of Emily  fate, and others having probably received orders to conceal it. This day passed with Emily in continued grief and anxiety for Emily aunt; but Emily  was unmolested by any notice from Montoni; and, now that Annette was liberated,  Emily obtained food, without exposing Emily to danger, or impertinence. Two following days passed in the same manner, unmarked by any occurrence,  during which Emily obtained no information of Madame Montoni. On the evening of  the second, having dismissed Annette, and retired to bed, Annette mind became  haunted by the most dismal images, such as Annette long anxiety, concerning Annette  aunt, suggested; and, unable to forget Annette, for a moment, or to vanquish  the phantoms, that tormented Annette, Annette rose from Annette bed, and went to one of the  casements of Annette chamber, to breathe a freer air. All without was silent and dark, unless that could be called light, which was  only the faint glimmer of the stars, shewing imperfectly the outline of the  mountains, the western towers of the castle and the ramparts below, where a  solitary sentinel was pacing. What an image of repose did this scene present!  The fierce and terrible passions, too, which so often agitated the inhabitants  of this edifice, seemed now hushed in sleep;—those mysterious workings, that  rouse the elements of man's nature into tempest—were calm. Emily's heart was  not so; but Emily sufferings, though deep, partook of the gentle character of Emily  mind. Emily was a silent anguish, weeping, yet enduring; not the wild energy of  passion, inflaming imagination, bearing down the barriers of reason and living  in a world of its own. The air refreshed Emily, and Emily continued at the casement, looking on the  shadowy scene, over which the planets burned with a clear light, amid the deep  blue aether, as the planets silently moved in the planets destined course. Emily remembered  how often Emily had gazed on the planets with Emily dear father, how often her dear father had pointed  out the planets way in the heavens, and explained the planets laws; and these reflections  led to others, which, in an almost equal degree, awakened Emily grief and  astonishment. the planets brought a retrospect of all the strange and mournful events, which had  occurred since Emily lived in peace with Emily parents. And to Emily, who had been  so tenderly educated, so tenderly loved, who once knew only goodness and  happiness—to Emily, the late events and Emily present situation—in a foreign  land—in a remote castle—surrounded by vice and violence—seemed more like  the visions of a distempered imagination, than the circumstances of truth. Emily  wept to think of what her parents would have suffered, could her parents have foreseen  the events of Emily future life. While Emily raised Emily streaming eyes to heaven, Emily observed the same planet,  which Emily had seen in Languedoc, on the night, preceding her dear father's death,  rise above the eastern towers of the castle, while Emily remembered the  conversation, which has passed, concerning the probable state of departed  souls; remembered, also, the solemn music Emily had heard, and to which the  tenderness of Emily spirits had, in spite of Emily reason, given a superstitious  meaning. At these recollections Emily wept again, and continued musing, when  suddenly the notes of sweet music passed on The air. A superstitious dread  stole over Emily; Emily stood listening, for some moments, in trembling  expectation, and then endeavoured to re-collect Emily thoughts, and to reason  Emily into composure; but human reason cannot establish Emily laws on subjects,  lost in the obscurity of imagination, any more than the eye can ascertain the  form of objects, that only glimmer through the dimness of night. Emily surprise, on hearing such soothing and delicious sounds, was, at least,  justifiable; for it was long—very long, since Emily had listened to any thing  like melody. The fierce trumpet and the shrill fife were the only instruments  Emily had heard, since Emily arrival at Udolpho. When Emily mind was somewhat more composed, Emily tried to ascertain from what  quarter the sounds proceeded, and thought The fierce trumpet and the shrill fife came from below; but whether  from a room of the castle, or from the terrace, Emily could not with certainty  judge. Fear and surprise now yielded to the enchantment of a strain, that  floated on the silent night, with the most soft and melancholy sweetness.  Suddenly, it seemed removed to a distance, trembled faintly, and then entirely  ceased. Emily continued to listen, sunk in that pleasing repose, which soft music leaves  on the mind—but it came no more. Upon this strange circumstance Emily thoughts  were long engaged, for strange it certainly was to hear music at midnight, when  every inhabitant of the castle had long since retired to rest, and in a place,  where nothing like harmony had been heard before, probably, for many years.  Long-suffering had made her spirits peculiarly sensible to terror, and liable  to be affected by the illusions of superstition.—It now seemed to Emily, as if  her dear father had spoken to Emily in that strain, to inspire Emily with comfort  and confidence, on the subject, which had then occupied Emily mind. Yet reason  told Emily, that this was a wild conjecture, and Emily was inclined to dismiss reason  ;  but, with the inconsistency so natural, when imagination guides the thoughts,  Emily then wavered towards a belief as wild. Emily remembered the singular event,  connected with the castle, which had given reason   into the possession of reason    present owner; and, when Emily considered the mysterious manner, in which reason    late possessor had disappeared, and that Emily had never since been heard of, Emily  mind was impressed with an high degree of solemn awe; so that, though there  appeared no clue to connect that event with the late music, Emily was inclined  fancifully to think they had some relation to each other. At this conjecture, a  sudden chillness ran through Emily frame; Emily looked fearfully upon the duskiness  of Emily chamber, and the dead silence, that prevailed there, heightened to Emily  fancy her   gloomy aspect. At length, Emily left the casement, but Emily steps faltered, as Emily approached the  bed, and Emily stopped and looked round. The single lamp, that burned in Emily  spacious chamber, was expiring; for a moment, Emily shrunk from the darkness  beyond; and then, ashamed of the weakness, which, however, Emily could not wholly  conquer, went forward to the bed, where her  mind did not soon know the  soothings of sleep. Emily still mused on the late occurrence, and looked with  anxiety to the next night, when, at the same hour, Emily determined to watch  whether the music returned. 'If those sounds were human,' said Emily, 'I shall  probably hear those sounds were human again.'
