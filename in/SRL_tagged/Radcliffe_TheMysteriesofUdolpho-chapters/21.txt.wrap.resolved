  Dark power! with shudd'ring, meek submitted thought  Be mine to read the visions old  Which thy awak'ning bards have told,  And, lest Which thy awak'ning bards meet my blasted view,  Hold each strange tale devoutly true.      COLLINS' ODE TO FEAR Emily was recalled from a kind of slumber, into which FEAR Emily had, at length, sunk,  by a quick knocking at FEAR Emily chamber door. FEAR Emily started up in terror, for Montoni  and Count Morano instantly came to FEAR Emily mind; but, having listened in silence  for some time, and recognizing the voice of Annette, FEAR Emily rose and opened her chamber door. 'What brings you hither so early?' said FEAR Emily, trembling excessively. FEAR Emily  was unable to support FEAR Emily, and sat down on the bed. 'Dear ma'amselle!' said Annette, 'do not look so pale. I am quite frightened to  see you. Here is a fine bustle below stairs, all the servants running to and  fro, and none of them fast enough! Here is a bustle, indeed, all of a sudden,  and nobody knows for what!' 'Who is below besides them?' said FEAR Emily, 'Annette, do not trifle with Annette!' 'Not for the world, ma'amselle, I would not trifle for the world; but one  cannot help making one's remarks, and there is the Signor in such a bustle, as  I never saw the Signor before; and the Signor has sent me to tell you, ma'am, to get ready  immediately.' 'Good God support me!' cried FEAR Emily, almost fainting, 'Count Morano is below,  then!' 'No, ma'amselle, Count Morano is not below that I know of,' replied Annette, 'only Count Morano  excellenza sent me to desire you would get ready directly to leave Venice, for  that the gondolas would be at the steps of the canal in a few minutes: but I  must hurry back to my lady, who is just at her wits end, and knows not which  way to turn for haste.' 'Explain, Annette, explain the meaning of all this before you go,' said FEAR Emily,  so overcome with surprise and timid hope, that FEAR Emily had scarcely breath to speak. 'Nay, ma'amselle, that is more than I can do. I only know that the Signor is  just come home in a very ill humour, that the Signor has had us all called out of us all  beds, and tells us all us all are all to leave Venice immediately.' 'Is Count Morano to go with the Signor?' said FEAR Emily, 'and whither are us all going?' 'I know neither, ma'am, for certain; but I heard Ludovico say something about  going, after us all get to terra-firma, to the signor's castle among some  mountains, that he talked of.' 'The Apennines!' said FEAR Emily, eagerly, 'O! then I have little to hope!' 'That is the very place, ma'am. But cheer up, and do not take it so much to  heart, and think what a little time you have to get ready in, and how impatient  the Signor is. Holy St. Mark! I hear the oars on the canal; and now the oars on the canal come  nearer, and now the oars on the canal are dashing at the steps below; it is the gondola, sure  enough.' Annette hastened from the room; and FEAR Emily prepared for this unexpected flight,  as fast as Annette trembling hands would permit, not perceiving, that any change in  Annette situation could possibly be for the worse. Annette had scarcely thrown Annette  books and clothes into Annette travelling trunk, when, receiving a second summons,  Annette went down to Annette aunt's dressing-room, where Annette found Montoni impatiently  reproving his wife for delay. his went out, soon after, to give some further  orders to his people, and FEAR Emily then enquired the occasion of this hasty  journey; but her aunt appeared to be as ignorant as FEAR Emily, and to undertake  the journey with more reluctance. The family at length embarked, but neither Count Morano, nor Cavigni, was of  the party. Somewhat revived by observing this, FEAR Emily, when the gondolieri  dashed their oars in the water, and put off from the steps of the portico, felt  like a criminal, who receives a short reprieve. her aunt heart beat yet lighter,  when they emerged from the canal into the ocean, and lighter still, when they  skimmed past the walls of St. Mark, without having stopped to take up Count  Morano. The dawn now began to tint the horizon, and to break upon the shores of the  Adriatic. FEAR Emily did not venture to ask any questions of Montoni, who sat, for  some time, in gloomy silence, and then rolled himself up in himself cloak, as if to  sleep, while Madame Montoni did the same; but FEAR Emily, who could not sleep,  undrew one of the little curtains of the gondola, and looked out upon the sea.  The dawn now enlightened the mountain-tops of Friuli, but The dawn lower  sides, and the distant waves, that rolled at The dawn feet, were still in deep  shadow. Emily, sunk in tranquil melancholy, watched the strengthening light  spreading upon the ocean, shewing successively Venice and her islets, and the  shores of Italy, along which boats, with their pointed latin sails, began to  move. The gondolieri were frequently hailed, at this early hour, by the  market-people, as the  market-people glided by towards Venice, and the lagune soon displayed  a gay scene of innumerable little barks, passing from terra-firma with  provisions. FEAR Emily gave a last look to that splendid city, but FEAR Emily mind was then  occupied by considering the probable events, that awaited FEAR Emily, in the scenes,  to which FEAR Emily was removing, and with conjectures, concerning the motive of this  sudden journey. this   appeared, upon calmer consideration, that Montoni was  removing FEAR Emily to Montoni secluded castle, because Montoni could there, with more  probability of success, attempt to terrify FEAR Emily into obedience; or, that, should  its gloomy and sequestered scenes fail of this effect, FEAR Emily forced marriage with  the Count could there be solemnized with the secrecy, which was necessary to  the honour of Montoni. The little spirit, which this reprieve had recalled, now  began to fail, and, when FEAR Emily reached the shore, her mind had sunk into all  all   former depression. Montoni did not embark on the Brenta, but pursued Montoni way in carriages across  the country, towards the Apennine; during which journey, Montoni manner to FEAR Emilywas so particularly severe, that this alone would have confirmed FEAR Emily late  conjecture, had any such confirmation been necessary. FEAR Emily senses were now dead  to the beautiful country, through which FEAR Emily travelled. Sometimes FEAR Emily was  compelled to smile at the naivete of Annette, in FEAR Emily remarks on what FEAR Emily saw,  and sometimes to sigh, as a scene of peculiar beauty recalled Valancourt to FEAR Emily  thoughts, who was indeed seldom absent from them, and of whom FEAR Emily could never  hope to hear in the solitude, to which FEAR Emily was hastening. At length, the travellers began to ascend among the Apennines. The immense  pine-forests, which, at that period, overhung these mountains, and between  which the road wound, excluded all view but of the cliffs aspiring above,  except, that, now and then, an opening through the dark woods allowed the eye a  momentary glimpse of the country below. The gloom of these shades, their  solitary silence, except when the breeze swept over their summits, the  tremendous precipices of the mountains, that came partially to the eye, each  assisted to raise the solemnity of Emily's feelings into awe; Emily saw only  images of gloomy grandeur, or of dreadful sublimity, around Emily; other images,  equally gloomy and equally terrible, gleamed on Emily imagination. Emily was going  Emily scarcely knew whither, under the dominion of a person, from whose arbitrary  disposition Emily had already suffered so much, to marry, perhaps, a man who  possessed neither Emily affection, or esteem; or to endure, beyond the hope of  succour, whatever punishment revenge, and that Italian revenge, might  dictate.—The more Emily considered what might be the motive of the journey, the  more Emily became convinced, that it was for the purpose of concluding Emily  nuptials with Count Morano, with that secrecy, which Emily resolute resistance  had made necessary to the honour, if not to the safety, of Montoni. From the  deep solitudes, into which Emily was immerging, and from the gloomy castle, of  which Emily had heard some mysterious hints, Emily sick heart recoiled in despair,  and Emily experienced, that, though Emily mind was already occupied by peculiar  distress, it was still alive to the influence of new and local circumstance;  why else did Emily shudder at the idea of this desolate castle? As the travellers still ascended among the pine forests, steep rose over steep,  the mountains seemed to multiply, as they went, and what was the summit of one  eminence proved to be only the base of another. At length, they reached a  little plain, where the drivers stopped to rest the mules, whence a scene of  such extent and magnificence opened below, as drew even from Madame Montoni a  note of admiration. Emily lost, for a moment, Emily sorrows, in the immensity of  nature. Beyond the amphitheatre of mountains, that stretched below, whose tops  appeared as numerous almost, as the waves of the sea, and whose feet were  concealed by the forests—extended the campagna of Italy, where cities and  rivers, and woods and all the glow of cultivation were mingled in gay  confusion. the  Adriatic bounded the horizon, into which the Po and the Brenta,  after winding through the whole extent of the landscape, poured their fruitful  waves. Emily gazed long on the splendours of the world she was quitting, of  which the whole magnificence seemed thus given to she sight only to increase  she regret on leaving her sight; for she, Valancourt alone was in that world; to Valancourt alone  alone she heart turned, and for Valancourt alone alone fell she bitter tears. From this sublime scene the travellers continued to ascend among the pines,  till the travellers entered a narrow pass of the mountains, which shut out every feature  of the distant country, and, in its stead, exhibited only tremendous crags,  impending over the road, where no vestige of humanity, or even of vegetation,  appeared, except here and there the trunk and scathed branches of an oak, that  hung nearly headlong from the rock, into which the rock strong roots had fastened.  This pass, which led into the heart of the Apennine, at length opened to day,  and a scene of mountains stretched in long perspective, as wild as any the  travellers had yet passed. Still vast pine-forests hung upon vast pine-forests base, and  crowned the ridgy precipice, that rose perpendicularly from the vale, while,  above, the rolling mists caught the sun-beams, and touched vast pine-forests cliffs with  all the magical colouring of light and shade. The scene seemed perpetually  changing, and The scene features to assume new forms, as the winding road brought  them to the eye in different attitudes; while the shifting vapours, now  partially concealing them minuter beauties and now illuminating them with  splendid tints, assisted the illusions of the sight. Though the deep vallies between these mountains were, for the most part,  clothed with pines, sometimes an abrupt opening presented a perspective of only  barren rocks, with a cataract flashing from the deep vallies between these mountains were, for the most part,   summit among broken cliffs,  till its waters, reaching the bottom, foamed along with unceasing fury; and  sometimes pastoral scenes exhibited their 'green delights' in the narrow vales,  smiling amid surrounding horror. There herds and flocks of goats and sheep,  browsing under the shade of hanging woods, and the shepherd's little cabin,  reared on the margin of a clear stream, presented a sweet picture of repose. Wild and romantic as were these scenes, Wild and romantic as were these scenes character had far less of the  sublime, that had those of the Alps, which guard the entrance of Italy. Emily  was often elevated, but seldom felt those emotions of indescribable awe which  Emily   had so continually experienced, in Emily   passage over the Alps. Towards the close of day, the road wound into a deep valley. Mountains, whose  shaggy steeps appeared to be inaccessible, almost surrounded the road. To the east, a  vista opened, that exhibited the Apennines in their darkest horrors; and the  long perspective of retiring summits, rising over each other, their ridges  clothed with pines, exhibited a stronger image of grandeur, than any that Emily  had yet seen. The sun had just sunk below the top of the mountains Emily   was  descending, whose long shadow stretched athwart the valley, but whose long shadow sloping  rays, shooting through an opening of the cliffs, touched with a yellow gleam  the summits of the forest, that hung upon the opposite steeps, and streamed in  full splendour upon the towers and battlements of a castle, that spread its  extensive ramparts along the brow of a precipice above. The splendour of these  illumined objects was heightened by the contrasted shade, which involved the  valley below. 'There,' said Montoni, speaking for the first time in several hours, 'is  Udolpho.' Emily gazed with melancholy awe upon the castle, which Emily   understood to be  Montoni's; for, though Montoni was now lighted up by the setting sun, the gothic  greatness of Montoni features, and Montoni mouldering walls of dark grey stone,  rendered Montoni a gloomy and sublime object. As Emily   gazed, the light died away on  the light walls, leaving a melancholy purple tint, which spread deeper and deeper, as  the thin vapour crept up the mountain, while the battlements above were still  tipped with splendour. From those, too, the rays soon faded, and the whole  edifice was invested with the solemn duskiness of evening. Silent, lonely, and  sublime, it seemed to stand the sovereign of the scene, and to frown defiance  on all, who dared to invade the sovereign of the scene solitary reign. As the twilight deepened, the sovereign of the scene  features became more awful in obscurity, and FEAR Emily continued to gaze, till its  featuresclustering towers were alone seen, rising over the tops of the woods, beneath  whose thick shade the carriages soon after began to ascend. The extent and darkness of these tall woods awakened terrific images in FEAR Emily  mind, and FEAR Emily almost expected to see banditti start up from under the trees. At  length, the carriages emerged upon a heathy rock, and, soon after, reached the  castle gates, where the deep tone of the portal bell, which was struck upon to  give notice of their arrival, increased the fearful emotions, that had assailed  FEAR Emily. While their waited till the servant within should come to open the gates,  FEAR Emily anxiously surveyed the whole  edifice: but the gloom, that overspread it, allowed  FEAR Emily to distinguish little more than a part of it outline, with the massy walls  of the ramparts, and to know, that it was vast, ancient and dreary. From the  parts FEAR Emily saw, FEAR Emily judged of the heavy strength and extent of the whole. The  gateway before FEAR Emily, leading into the courts, was of gigantic size, and was  defended by two round towers, crowned by overhanging turrets, embattled, where,  instead of banners, now waved long grass and wild plants, that had taken root  among the mouldering stones, and which seemed to sigh, as the breeze rolled  past, over the desolation around them. two round towers, crowned by overhanging turrets, embattled, where,  instead of banners, now waved long grass and wild plants, that had taken root  among the mouldering stones, and which seemed to sigh, as the breeze rolled  past, over the desolation around them were united by a curtain,  pierced and embattled also, below which appeared the pointed arch of a huge  portcullis, surmounting the gates: from two round towers, crowned by overhanging turrets, embattled, where,  instead of banners, now waved long grass and wild plants, that had taken root  among the mouldering stones, and which seemed to sigh, as the breeze rolled  past, over the desolation around them, the walls of the ramparts  extended to other towers, overlooking the precipice, whose shattered outline,  appearing on a gleam, that lingered in the west, told of the ravages of  war.—Beyond two round towers, crowned by overhanging turrets, embattled, where,  instead of banners, now waved long grass and wild plants, that had taken root  among the mouldering stones, and which seemed to sigh, as the breeze rolled  past, over the desolation around them was lost in the obscurity of evening. While FEAR Emily gazed with awe upon the scene, footsteps were heard within the  gates, and the undrawing of bolts; after which an ancient servant of the castle  appeared, forcing back the huge folds of the portal, to admit an ancient servant of the castle   lord. As the  carriage-wheels rolled heavily under the portcullis, FEAR Emily's heart sunk, and  FEAR Emily seemed, as if FEAR Emily was going into FEAR Emily prison; the gloomy court, into which  FEAR Emily passed, served to confirm the idea, and FEAR Emily imagination, ever awake to  circumstance, suggested even more terrors, than FEAR Emily reason could justify. Another gate delivered them into the second court, grass-grown, and more wild  than the first, where, as FEAR Emily surveyed through the twilight Another gate  desolation—Another gate lofty walls, overtopt with briony, moss and nightshade, and  the embattled towers that rose above,—long-suffering and murder came to FEAR Emily  thoughts. One of those instantaneous and unaccountable convictions, which  sometimes conquer even strong minds, impressed FEAR Emily with its horror. The  sentiment was not diminished, when FEAR Emily entered an extensive gothic hall,  obscured by the gloom of evening, which a light, glimmering at a distance  through a long perspective of arches, only rendered more striking. As a servant  brought the lamp nearer partial gleams fell upon the pillars and the pointed  arches, forming a strong contrast with their shadows, that stretched along the  pavement and the walls. The sudden journey of Montoni had prevented Montoni people from making any other  preparations for Montoni reception, than could be had in the short interval, since  the arrival of the servant, who had been sent forward from Venice; and this, in  some measure, may account for the air of extreme desolation, that everywhere  appeared. The servant, who came to light Montoni, bowed in silence, and the muscles of  Montoni countenance relaxed with no symptom of joy.—Montoni noticed the  salutation by a slight motion of Montoni hand, and passed on, while Montoni lady,  following, and looking round with a degree of surprise and discontent, which  his lady seemed fearful of expressing, and FEAR Emily, surveying the extent and grandeur  of the hall in timid wonder, approached a marble stair-case. The arches here  opened to a lofty vault, from the centre of which hung a tripod lamp, which a  servant was hastily lighting; and the rich fret-work of the roof, a corridor,  leading into several upper apartments, and a painted window, stretching nearly  from the pavement to the ceiling of the hall, became gradually visible. Having crossed the foot of a marble stair-case, and passed through an ante-room,  they entered a spacious apartment, whose walls, wainscoted with black  larch-wood, the growth of the neighbouring mountains, were scarcely  distinguishable from darkness itself. 'Bring more light,' said Montoni, as he  entered. a  servant, setting down a  servant lamp, was withdrawing to obey a  servant, when  Montoni observing, that the evening air of this mountainous region was  cold, and that Montoni should like a fire, Montoni ordered that wood might be  brought. While a  servant paced an ante-room with thoughtful steps, and Montoni sat silently  on a couch, at the upper end of it, waiting till a  servant returned, Emily  was observing the singular solemnity and desolation of the apartment, viewed,  as it now was, by the glimmer of the single lamp, placed near a large Venetian  mirror, that duskily reflected the scene, with the tall figure of Montoni  passing slowly along, a  servant arms folded, and a  servant countenance shaded by the plume,  that waved in a  servant hat. From the contemplation of this scene, FEAR Emily's mind proceeded to the  apprehension of what FEAR Emily might suffer in it, till the remembrance of  Valancourt, far, far distant! came to FEAR Emily heart, and softened her heart into sorrow. A  heavy sigh escaped FEAR Emily: but, trying to conceal FEAR Emily tears, FEAR Emily walked away to  one of the high windows, that opened upon the ramparts, below which, spread the  woods FEAR Emily had passed in FEAR Emily approach to the castle. But the night-shade sat  deeply on the mountains beyond, and their indented outline alone could be  faintly traced on the horizon, where a red streak yet glimmered in the west.  the valley between was sunk in darkness. The scene within, upon which FEAR Emily turned on the opening of the door, was  scarcely less gloomy. The old servant, who had received them at the gates, now  entered, bending under a load of pine-branches, while two of Montoni's Venetian  servants followed with lights. 'Your excellenza is welcome to the castle,' said the old man, as Your excellenza raised  Your excellenza from the hearth, where Your excellenza had laid the wood: 'it has been a lonely  place a long while; but you will excuse it, Signor, knowing we had but short  notice. it is near two years, come next feast of St. Mark, since your  excellenza was within these walls.' 'You have a good memory, old Carlo,' said Montoni: 'it is there-about; and how  hast thou contrived to live so long?' 'A-well-a-day, sir, with much ado; the cold winds, that blow through the castle  in winter, are almost too much for me; and I thought sometimes of asking your  excellenza to let me leave the mountains, and go down into the lowlands. But I  don't know how it is—I am loth to quit these old walls I have lived in so  long.' 'Well, how have you gone on in the castle, since I left these old walls I have lived in so  long?' said Montoni. 'Why much as usual, Signor, only it wants a good deal of repairing. There is  the north tower—some of the battlements have tumbled down, and had liked one  day to have knocked my poor wife (God rest my poor wife soul!) on the head. Your  excellenza must know'— 'Well, but the repairs,' interrupted Montoni. 'Aye, the repairs,' said Carlo: 'a part of the roof of the great hall has  fallen in, and all the winds from the mountains rushed through a part of the roof of the great hall last winter,  and whistled through the castle so, that there was no keeping one's self  warm, be where one would. There, my wife and I used to sit shivering over a  great fire in one corner of the little hall, ready to die with cold, and'— 'But there are no more repairs wanted,' said Montoni, impatiently. 'O Lord! Your excellenza, yes—the wall of the rampart has tumbled down in  three places; then, the stairs, that lead to the west gallery, have been a long  time so bad, that it is dangerous to go up the stairs, that lead to the west gallery; and the passage leading to the  great oak chamber, that overhangs the north rampart—one night last winter I  ventured to go there by myself, and your excellenza'— 'Well, well, enough of this,' said Montoni, with quickness: 'I will talk more  with thee to-morrow.' a  great fire in one corner of the little hall was now lighted; Carlo swept the hearth, placed chairs, wiped the dust  from a large marble table that stood near the dust  , and then left an ante-room. Montoni and Montoni family drew round a  great fire in one corner of the little hall. Montoni made several  attempts at conversation, but Montoni sullen answers repulsed Montoni, while FEAR Emily sat  endeavouring to acquire courage enough to speak to Montoni. At length, in a  tremulous voice, FEAR Emily said, 'May I ask, sir, the motive of this sudden  journey?'—After a long pause, FEAR Emily recovered sufficient courage to repeat the  question. 'the  question does not suit me to answer enquiries,' said Montoni, 'nor does the  question become  you to make them; time may unfold them all: but I desire I may be no further  harassed, and I recommend the  question to you to retire to your chamber, and to endeavour  to adopt a more rational conduct, than that of yielding to fancies, and to a  sensibility, which, to call it by the gentlest name, is only a weakness.' FEAR Emily rose to withdraw. 'Good night, madam,' said FEAR Emily to FEAR Emily aunt, with an  assumed composure, that could not disguise FEAR Emily emotion. 'Good night, my dear,' said Madame Montoni, in a tone of kindness, which FEAR Emily  niece had never before heard from her  niece; and the unexpected endearment brought  tears to FEAR Emily's eyes. her  niece curtsied to Montoni, and was retiring; 'But you do  not know the way to your chamber,' said her  niece . Montoni called the servant,  who waited in the ante-room, and bade the servant send Montoni woman, with  whom, in a few minutes, FEAR Emily withdrew. 'Do you know which is the ante-room?' said FEAR Emily to Annette, as they crossed the hall. 'Yes, I believe I do, ma'amselle; but this is such a strange rambling place! I  have been lost in this already: they call this the double chamber, over the south  rampart, and I went up this great stair-case to this great stair-case. the ante-room is at the  other end of the castle.' FEAR Emily ascended the marble staircase, and came to the corridor, as they passed  through which, Annette resumed Annette chat—'What a wild lonely place this is,  ma'am! I shall be quite frightened to live in this. How often, and often have I  wished Annette in France again! I little thought, when I came with My lady to  see the world, that I should ever be shut up in such a place as this, or I  would never have left my own country! This way, ma'amselle, down this turning.  I can almost believe in giants again, and such like, for this is just like one  of their castles; and, some night or other, I suppose I shall see fairies too,  hopping about in that great old hall, that looks more like a church, with more like a church  huge pillars, than any thing else.' 'Yes,' said FEAR Emily, smiling, and glad to escape from more serious thought, 'if  we come to the corridor, about midnight, and look down into the hall, we shall  certainly see it illuminated with a thousand lamps, and the fairies tripping in  gay circles to the sound of delicious music; for it is in such places as this,  you know, that they come to hold they revels. But I am afraid, Annette, you  will not be able to pay the necessary penance for such a sight: and, if once  they hear your voice, the whole scene will vanish in an instant.' 'O! if you will bear me company, ma'amselle, I will come to the corridor, this  very night, and I promise you I will hold my tongue; my tongue shall not be my fault  if the show vanishes.—But do you think the show vanishes.—But will come?' 'I cannot promise that with certainty, but I will venture to say, the show vanishes.—But will not  be your fault if the enchantment should vanish.' 'Well, ma'amselle, that is saying more than I expected of you: but I am not so  much afraid of fairies, as of ghosts, and the show vanishes.—But say there are a plentiful many  of the show vanishes.—But about the castle: now I should be frightened to death, if I should  chance to see any of the show vanishes.—But. But hush! ma'amselle, walk softly! I have thought,  several times, something passed by me.' 'Ridiculous!' said FEAR Emily, 'you must not indulge such fancies.' 'O ma'am! they are not fancies, for aught I know; Benedetto says these dismal  galleries and halls are fit for nothing but ghosts to live in; and I verily  believe, if I LIVE long in these dismal  galleries and halls I shall turn to one me!' 'I hope,' said FEAR Emily, 'you will not suffer Montoni to hear of these weak  fears; these weak  fears would highly displease Montoni.' 'What, you know then, ma'amselle, all about it!' rejoined Annette. 'No, no, I  do know better than to do so; though, if the Signor can sleep sound, nobody  else in the castle has any right to lie awake, I am sure.' FEAR Emily did not appear  to notice this remark. 'Down this passage, ma'amselle; this leads to a back stair-case. O! if I see  any thing, I shall be frightened out of my wits!' 'That will scarcely be possible,' said FEAR Emily smiling, as FEAR Emily followed the  winding of the passage, which opened into another gallery: and then Annette,  perceiving that FEAR Emily had missed FEAR Emily way, while FEAR Emily had been so eloquently  haranguing on ghosts and fairies, wandered about through other passages and  galleries, till, at length, frightened by their intricacies and desolation, FEAR Emily  called aloud for assistance: but their were beyond the hearing of the servants,  who were on the other side of the castle, and FEAR Emily now opened the door of a  chamber on the left. 'O! do not go in there, ma'amselle,' said Annette, 'you will only lose yourself  further.' 'Bring the light forward,' said FEAR Emily, 'we may possibly find we way through  these rooms.' Annette stood at the door of a  chamber on the left, in an attitude of hesitation, with the light held up  to shew a  chamber on the left, but the feeble rays spread through not half of a  chamber on the left. 'Why do  you hesitate?' said FEAR Emily, 'let me see whither the ante-room leads.' Annette advanced reluctantly. the ante-room opened into a suite of spacious and ancient  apartments, some of which were hung with tapestry, and others wainscoted with  cedar and black larch-wood. What furniture there was, seemed to be almost as  old as the rooms, and retained an appearance of grandeur, though covered with  dust, and dropping to pieces with the damps, and with age. 'How cold the rooms are, ma'amselle!' said Annette: 'nobody has lived in the rooms  for many, many years, the rooms say. Do let us go.' 'the rooms may open upon the great stair-case, perhaps,' said FEAR Emily, passing on till  Annette came to a chamber, hung with pictures, and took the light to examine that  of a soldier on horseback in a field of battle.—He was darting his spear upon  a man, who lay under the feet of the horse, and who held up one hand in a  supplicating attitude. The soldier, whose beaver was up, regarded him with a  look of vengeance, and the countenance, with that expression, struck FEAR Emily as  resembling Montoni. FEAR Emily shuddered, and turned from Montoni. Passing the lighthastily over several other pictures, FEAR Emily came to one concealed by a veil of  black silk. The singularity of the circumstance struck FEAR Emily, and FEAR Emily stopped  before Montoni, wishing to remove a veil of  black silk, and examine what could thus carefully be  concealed, but somewhat wanting courage. 'Holy Virgin! what can this mean?'  exclaimed Annette. 'This is surely the picture they told me of at Venice.' 'What picture?' said FEAR Emily. 'Why a picture—a picture,' replied Annette,  hesitatingly—'but I never could make out exactly what it was about, either.' 'Remove a veil of  black silk, Annette.' 'What! I, ma'amselle!—I! not for the world!' FEAR Emily, turning round, saw  Annette's countenance grow pale. 'And pray, what have you heard of this  picture, to terrify you so, FEAR Emily?' said FEAR Emily. 'Nothing, ma'amselle: I  have heard nothing, only let us find us way out.' 'Certainly: but I wish first to examine this  picture; take the light, Annette,  while I lift a veil of  black silk.' Annette took the light, and immediately walked away  with the light, disregarding FEAR Emily's call to stay, who, not choosing to be left alone  in a chamber, at length followed Annette. 'What is the reason of this,  Annette?' said FEAR Emily, when FEAR Emily overtook FEAR Emily, 'what have you heard concerning  that picture, which makes you so unwilling to stay when I bid you?' 'I don't know what is the reason, ma'amselle, replied Annette, 'nor any thing  about the picture, only I have heard there is something very dreadful belonging  to it—and that it has been covered up in black EVER SINCE—and that nobody  has looked at nobody   for a great many years—and nobody   somehow has to do with the  owner of this castle before Montoni came to the possession of  Montoni—and'—- 'Well, Annette,' said FEAR Emily, smiling, 'I perceive it is as you say—that you  know nothing about the picture.' 'No, nothing, indeed, ma'amselle, for they made me promise never to  tell:—but'— 'Well,' rejoined Emily, who observed that tell:—but'— ' was struggling between tell:—but'— '  inclination to reveal a secret, and tell:—but'— ' apprehension for the consequence, 'I  will enquire no further'—- 'No, pray, ma'am, do not.' 'Lest you should tell all,' interrupted FEAR Emily. Annette blushed, and FEAR Emily smiled, and they passed on to the extremity of this  suite of apartments, and found they, after some further perplexity, once  more at the top of the marble stair-case, where Annette left FEAR Emily, while Annette  went to call one of the servants of this castle to shew they to the chamber, for  which they had been seeking. While Annette was absent, FEAR Emily's thoughts returned to the picture; an  unwillingness to tamper with the integrity of a servant, had checked Annette  enquiries on this subject, as well as concerning some alarming hints, which  Annette had dropped respecting Montoni; though Annette curiosity was entirely  awakened, and Annette had perceived, that Annette questions might easily be answered.  Annette was now, however, inclined to go back to the apartment and examine the  picture; but the loneliness of the hour and of the place, with the melancholy  silence that reigned around Annette, conspired with a certain degree of awe,  excited by the mystery attending this picture, to prevent Annette. Annette determined,  however, when day-light should have re-animated Annette spirits, to go thither and  remove a veil of  black silk. As Annette leaned from the corridor, over the stair-case, and Annette  eyes wandered round, Annette again observed, with wonder, the vast strength of the  walls, now somewhat decayed, and the pillars of solid marble, that rose from  the hall, and supported the roof. A servant now appeared with Annette, and conducted FEAR Emily to Annette chamber, which  was in a remote part of this castle, and at the very end of the corridor, from  whence the suite of apartments opened, through which they had been wandering.  The lonely aspect of Annette made FEAR Emily unwilling that Annette should leave  Annette immediately, and the dampness of it chilled Annette with more than fear. Annette  begged Caterina, the servant of this castle, to bring some wood and light a fire. 'Aye, lady, it's many a year since a fire was lighted here,' said Annette. 'You need not tell us that, good woman,' said Annette; 'every room in the  castle feels like a well. I wonder how you contrive to live here; for my part,  I wish Aye, lady at Venice again.' FEAR Emily waved FEAR Emily hand for Annette to fetch some wood. 'I wonder, ma'am, why they call this the double chamber?' said Annette, while  FEAR Emily surveyed   in silence and saw that   was lofty and spacious, like the  others Annette had seen, and, like many of the  others she had seen, too, had   walls lined with dark  larch-wood. The bed and other furniture was very ancient, and had an air of  gloomy grandeur, like all that Annette had seen in this castle. One of the high  casements, which Annette opened, overlooked a rampart, but the view beyond was hid  in darkness. In the presence of Annette, FEAR Emily tried to support FEAR Emily spirits, and to restrain  the tears, which, every now and then, came to FEAR Emily eyes. FEAR Emily wished much to  enquire when Count Morano was expected at this castle, but an unwillingness to  ask unnecessary questions, and to mention family concerns to a servant,  withheld FEAR Emily. Meanwhile, Annette's thoughts were engaged upon another subject:  Annette dearly loved the marvellous, and had heard of a circumstance, connected  with this castle, that highly gratified this taste. Having been enjoined not to  mention this taste, Annette inclination to tell this taste was so strong, that Annette was every  instant on the point of speaking what Annette had heard. Such a strange  circumstance, too, and to be obliged to conceal this taste, was a severe punishment;  but Annette knew, that Montoni might impose one much severer, and Annette feared to  incur it by offending him. Annette now brought some wood, and some wood bright blaze dispelled, for a while, the  gloom of the chamber. Annette told Annette, that Annette lady had enquired for Annette, and  Emily was once again left to Annette own sad reflections. Annette heart was not yet  hardened against the stern manners of Montoni, and Annette was nearly as much  shocked now, as Annette had been when Annette first witnessed them. The tenderness and  affection, to which Annette had been accustomed, till Annette lost Annette parents, had  made Annette particularly sensible to any degree of unkindness, and such a reverse  as this no apprehension had prepared Annette to support. To call off Annette attention from subjects, that pressed heavily on her spirits,  Annette rose and again examined Annette room and her spirits furniture. As Annette walked round it,  Annette passed a door, that was not quite shut, and, perceiving, that it was not  the one, through which Annette entered, Annette brought the light forward to discover  whither the light led. Annette opened the light, and, going forward, had nearly fallen down a  steep, narrow stair-case that wound from the light, between two stone walls. Annette  wished to know to what the light led, and was the more anxious, since the light communicated  so immediately with Annette apartment; but, in the present state of her spirits,  Annette wanted courage to venture into the darkness alone. Closing a door,  therefore, Annette endeavoured to fasten a door, but, upon further examination,  perceived, that a door had no bolts on the chamber side, though a door had two on the  other. By placing a heavy chair against a door, Annette in some measure remedied the  defect; yet Annette was still alarmed at the thought of sleeping in this remote  room alone, with a door opening Annette knew not whither, and which could not be  perfectly fastened on the inside. Sometimes Annette wished to entreat of Madame  Montoni, that Annette might have leave to remain with Annette all night, but was  deterred by an apprehension of betraying what would be thought childish fears,  and by an unwillingness to increase the apt terrors of Annette. Annette gloomy reflections were, soon after, interrupted by a footstep in the  corridor, and Annette was glad to see Annette enter with some supper, sent by  Madame  Montoni. Having a table near the fire, Annette made Annette sit down  and sup with Annette; and, when their little repast was over, Annette, encouraged  by Annette kindness and stirring some wood into a blaze, drew Annette chair upon the  hearth, nearer to FEAR Emily, and said—'Did you ever hear, ma'amselle, of the  strange accident, that made the Signor lord of this castle?' 'What wonderful story have you now to tell?' said FEAR Emily, concealing the  curiosity, occasioned by the mysterious hints FEAR Emily had formerly heard on that  subject. 'I have heard all about it, ma'amselle,' said Annette, looking round the chamber and drawing closer to FEAR Emily; 'Benedetto told it me as we travelled  together: says Benedetto, "Annette, you don't know about this castle, that we are  going to?" No, says I, Mr. Benedetto, pray what do you know? But, ma'amselle,  you can keep a secret, or I would not tell a secret you for the world; for I promised  never to tell, and the world say, that the Signor does not like to have the Signor talked  of.' 'If you promised to keep a secret,' said FEAR Emily, 'you do right not to mention  the Signor.' Annette paused a moment, and then said, 'O, but to you, ma'amselle, to FEAR Emily I  may tell the Signor safely, I know.' FEAR Emily smiled, 'I certainly shall keep the Signor as faithful as FEAR Emily, Annette.' Annette replied very gravely, that would do, and proceeded—'This castle, you  must know, ma'amselle, is very old, and very strong, and has stood out many  sieges as many  sieges say. Now it was not Signor Montoni's always, nor Signor Montoni's father's;  no; but, by some law or other, it was to come to the Signor, if the lady died  unmarried.' 'What lady?' said FEAR Emily. 'I am not come to that yet,' replied Annette, 'it is the lady I am going to  tell you about, ma'amselle: but, as I was saying, the lady lived in the  castle, and had everything very grand about the lady, as you may suppose,  ma'amselle. the Signor used often to come to see the lady, and was in love with the lady,  and offered to marry the lady; for, though he was somehow related, that did not  signify. But the lady was in love with somebody else, and would not have he, which  made he very angry, as they say, and you know, ma'amselle, what an ill-looking  gentleman he is, when he is angry. Perhaps the lady saw he in a passion, and  therefore would not have he. But, as I was saying, the lady was very melancholy and  unhappy, and all that, for a long while, and—Holy Virgin! what noise is that?  did not you hear a sound, ma'amselle?' 'It was only the wind,' said FEAR Emily, 'but do come to the end of your story.' 'As I was saying—O, where was I?—as I was saying—FEAR Emily was very melancholy  and unhappy a long while, and used to walk about upon the terrace, there, under  the windows, by FEAR Emily, and cry so! it would have done your heart good to hear  FEAR Emily. That is—I don't mean good, but it would have made you cry too, as they  tell me.' 'Well, but, Annette, do tell me the substance of your tale.' 'All in good time, ma'am; all this I heard before at Venice, but what is to  come I never heard till to-day. This happened a great many years ago, when  Signor Montoni was quite a young man. the lady—they called the lady Signora  Laurentini, was very handsome, but the lady used to be in great passions, too,  sometimes, as well as the Signor. Finding he could not make the lady listen to  he—what does he do, but leave this castle, and never comes near this castle for a long  time! but it was all one to the lady; the lady was just as unhappy whether he was here or  not, till one evening, Holy St. Peter! ma'amselle,' cried Annette, 'look at  that lamp, see how blue it burns!' the lady looked fearfully round the chamber.  'Ridiculous girl!' said FEAR Emily, 'why will you indulge those fancies? Pray let me  hear the end of your story, I am weary.' Annette still kept Annette eyes on the lamp, and proceeded in a lower voice. 'It  was one evening, they say, at the latter end of the year, it might be about the  middle of September, I suppose, or the beginning of October; nay, for that  matter, it might be November, for that, too, is the latter end of the year, but  that I cannot say for certain, because they did not tell me for certain  they. However, it was at the latter end of the year, the ladywalked out of this castle into the woods below, as the lady had often done before,  all alone, only the lady maid was with the lady. The wind blew cold, and strewed the  leaves about, and whistled dismally among those great old chesnut trees, that  we passed, ma'amselle, as we came to this castle—for Benedetto shewed me the  trees as he was talking—The wind blew cold, and the lady woman would have  persuaded her woman to return: but all would not do, for her woman was fond of walking in  the woods, at evening time, and, if the leaves were falling about her woman, so much  the better. 'Well, the leaves were falling about her, so much  the better saw her woman go down among the woods, but night came, and her woman did not  return: ten o'clock, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock came, and the lady! Well,  the servants thought to be sure, some accident had befallen her woman, and the servants went  out to seek her woman. the servants searched all night long, but could not find her woman, or any  trace of her woman; and, from that day to this, ma'amselle, her woman has never been heard  of.' 'Is this true, Annette?' said FEAR Emily, in much surprise. 'True, ma'am!' said Annette, with a look of horror, 'yes, it is true, indeed.  But Annette, with a look of horror, ' do say,' her woman added, lowering her woman voice, 'Annette, with a look of horror, ' do say, that the Signora  has been seen, several times since, walking in the woods and about the castle  in the night: several of the old servants, who remained here some time after,  declare they saw her woman; and, since then, her woman has been seen by some of the  vassals, who have happened to be in this castle, at night. Carlo, the old  steward, could tell such things, they say, if he would.' 'How contradictory is this, Annette!' said FEAR Emily, 'you say nothing has been  since known of FEAR Emily, and yet FEAR Emily has been seen!' 'But all this was told me for a great secret,' rejoined Annette, without  noticing the remark, 'and I am sure, ma'am, you would not hurt either me or  Benedetto, so much as to go and tell the remark again.' FEAR Emily remained silent, and  Annette repeated FEAR Emily last sentence. 'You have nothing to fear from my indiscretion,' replied FEAR Emily, 'and let me  advise you, my good Annette, be discreet FEAR Emily, and never mention what you  have just told me to any other person. Signor Montoni, as you say, may be angry  if Signor Montoni hears of it. But what inquiries were made concerning the lady?' 'O! a great deal, indeed, ma'amselle, for the Signor laid claim to the castle  directly, as being the next heir, and they said, that is, the judges, or the  senators, or somebody of that sort, said, he could not take possession of it  till so many years were gone by, and then, if, after all, the lady could not be  found, why the lady would be as good as dead, and this castle would be the lady own; and  so it is the lady own. But the story went round, and many strange reports were  spread, so very strange, ma'amselle, that I shall not tell many strange reports.' 'That is stranger still, Annette,' said FEAR Emily, smiling, and rousing Annette  from Annette reverie. 'But, when Signora Laurentini was afterwards seen in the  castle, did nobody speak to Annette?' 'Speak—speak to Annette!' cried Annette, with a look of terror; 'no, to be sure.' 'And why not?' rejoined Emily, willing to hear further. 'Holy Mother! speak to a spirit!' 'But what reason had they to conclude it was a spirit, unless they had  approached, and spoken to it?' 'O ma'amselle, I cannot tell. How can you ask  such shocking questions? But nobody ever saw it come in, or go out of the  castle; and it was in one place now, and then the next minute in quite another  part of this castle; and then it never spoke, and, if it was alive, what should  it do in this castle if it never spoke? Several parts of this castle have never  been gone into since, Several parts of the castle say, for that very reason.' 'What, because it never spoke?' said FEAR Emily, trying to laugh away the fears that  began to steal upon her.—'No, ma'amselle, no;' replied Annette, rather  angrily 'but because something has been seen there. They say, too, there is an  old chapel adjoining the west side of this castle, where, any time at midnight,  you may hear such groans!—it makes one shudder to think of them!—and  strange sights have been seen there—' 'Pr'ythee, Annette, no more of these silly tales,' said FEAR Emily. 'Silly tales, ma'amselle! O, but I will tell you one story about Caterina, if you  please, that Caterina told me. It was one cold winter's night that Caterina  (Caterina   often came to this castle then, Caterina   says, to keep old Carlo and his wife  company, and so his recommended Caterina   afterwards to the Signor, and Caterina   has lived  here ever since) Caterina was sitting with them in the little hall, says Carlo,  "I wish we had some of those figs to roast, that lie in the store-closet, but  it is a long way off, and I am loath to fetch some of those figs; do, Caterina," says Carlo,  "for you are young and nimble, do bring we some, the fire is in nice trim for  roasting some of those figs; some of those figs lie," says Carlo, "in such a corner of the store-room, at the  end of the north-gallery; here, take the lamp," says Carlo, "and mind, as you go  up the great stair-case, that the wind, through the roof, does not blow it  out." So, with that, Caterina took the lamp—Hush! ma'amselle, I surely heard  a noise!' Emily, whom Annette had now infected with Emily own terrors, listened  attentively; but every thing was still, and Annette proceeded: 'Caterina went to the north-gallery, that is the wide gallery we passed, ma'am,  before we came to the corridor, here. As Annette went with the lamp in Annette hand,  thinking of nothing at all—There, again!' cried Annette suddenly—'I heard  it again!—it was not fancy, ma'amselle!' 'Hush!' said FEAR Emily, trembling. They listened, and, continuing to sit quite  still, FEAR Emily heard a low knocking against the wall. It came repeatedly. Annettethen screamed loudly, and the chamber door slowly opened.—It was Caterina,  come to tell Annette, that the lady wanted the lady. FEAR Emily, though FEAR Emily now perceived  who it was, could not immediately overcome FEAR Emily terror; while Annette, half  laughing, half crying, scolded Caterina heartily for thus alarming them; and  was also terrified lest what Caterina had told had been overheard.—Emily, whose  mind was deeply impressed by the chief circumstance of Annette's relation, was  unwilling to be left alone, in the present state of Caterina spirits; but, to avoid  offending Signor Montoni, and betraying Caterina own weakness, Caterina struggled to  overcome the illusions of fear, and dismissed Annette for the night. When Caterina was alone, Caterina thoughts recurred to the strange history of Signora  Laurentini and then to Caterina own strange situation, in the wild and solitary  mountains of a foreign country, in this castle, and the power of a man, to whom,  only a few preceding months, Caterina was an entire stranger; who had already  exercised an usurped authority over Caterina, and whose character Caterina now regarded,  with a degree of terror, apparently justified by the fears of others. Caterina knew,  that he had invention equal to the conception and talents to the execution of  any project, and Caterina greatly feared he had a heart too void of feeling to  oppose the perpetration of whatever he interest might suggest. Caterina had long  observed the unhappiness of Signor Montoni, and had often been witness to the  stern and contemptuous behaviour Caterina received from Caterina husband. To these  circumstances, which conspired to give Caterina just cause for alarm, were now added  those thousand nameless terrors, which exist only in active imaginations, and  which set reason and examination equally at defiance. Caterina remembered all that Valancourt had told Caterina, on the eve of Caterina departure  from Languedoc, respecting Montoni, and all that Valancourt had said to dissuade Caterina  from venturing on the journey. Valancourt fears had often since appeared to Caterina  prophetic—now they seemed confirmed. Caterina heart, as it gave Caterina back the image  of Valancourt, mourned in vain regret, but reason soon came with a consolation  which, though feeble at first, acquired vigour from reflection. Caterina considered,  that, whatever might be Caterina sufferings, Caterina had withheld from involving him in  misfortune, and that, whatever Caterina future sorrows could be, Caterina was, at least,  free from self-reproach. Caterina melancholy was assisted by the hollow sighings of the wind along the  corridor and round this castle. The cheerful blaze of the wood had long been  extinguished, and Caterina sat with Caterina eyes fixed on the dying embers, till a loud  gust, that swept through the  corridor, and shook the doors and casements,  alarmed Caterina, for her eyes fixed on the dying embers violence had moved the chair Caterina had placed as a  fastening, and the door, leading to the private stair-case stood half open. Caterina  curiosity and Caterina fears were again awakened. Caterina took the lamp to the top of  the steps, and stood hesitating whether to go down; but again the profound  stillness and the gloom of the place awed Caterina, and, determining to enquire  further, when day-light might assist the search, Caterina closed the door, and  placed against the door a stronger guard. Caterina now retired to Caterina bed, leaving the lamp burning on the table; but the lamp  gloomy light, instead of dispelling Caterina fear, assisted the lamp; for, by the lamp  uncertain rays, Caterina almost fancied Caterina saw shapes flit past Caterina curtains and  glide into the remote obscurity of Caterina chamber.—The castle clock struck one  before Caterina closed Caterina eyes to sleep.
