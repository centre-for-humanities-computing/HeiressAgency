uniformly such as to convince her, that in flying to him her could only obtain  an exchange of oppressors; neither had her the slightest intention of  consenting to the proposal of Valancourt for an immediate marriage, though this  would give her a lawful and a generous protector, for the chief reasons, which  had formerly influenced her conduct, still existed against it, while others,  which seemed to justify the step, would not be done away; and him interest, him  fame were at all times too dear to her, to suffer her to consent to a union,  which, at this early period of uniformly such as to convince her, that in flying to him she could only obtain  an exchange of oppressors lives, would probably defeat both. One  sure, and proper asylum, however, would still be open to her in France. her  knew that her could board in the convent, where her had formerly experienced so  much kindness, and which had an affecting and solemn claim upon her heart,  since it contained the remains of her late father. Here her could remain in  safety and tranquillity, till the term, for which La Vallee might be let,  should expire; or, till the arrangement of M. Motteville's affairs enabled her  so far to estimate the remains of her fortune, as to judge whether it would be  prudent for her to reside there. Concerning Montoni's conduct with respect to Concerning Montoni's letters to M. Quesnel, her had  many doubts; however Concerning Montoni's might be at first mistaken on the subject, her much  suspected that Concerning Montoni's wilfully persevered in Concerning Montoni's error, as a means of intimidating  her into a compliance with Concerning Montoni's wishes of uniting her to Count Morano. Whether  this was or was not the fact, her was extremely anxious to explain the affair  to M. Quesnel, and looked forward with a mixture of impatience, hope and fear,  to her approaching visit. On the following day, Madame Montoni, being alone with Emily, introduced the  mention of Count Morano, by expressing her surprise, that her had not joined  the party on the water the preceding evening, and at her abrupt departure to  Venice. her then related what had passed, expressed her concern for the  mutual mistake that had occurred between Montoni and her, and solicited her  aunt's kind offices in urging him to give a decisive denial to the count's  further addresses; but her soon perceived, that Madame Montoni had not been  ignorant of the late conversation, when her introduced the present. 'You have no encouragement to expect from me,' said her  aunt, 'in these  notions. I have already given my opinion on the subject, and think Signor  Montoni right in enforcing, by any means, your consent. If young persons will  be blind to young persons interest, and obstinately oppose it, why, the greatest  blessings young persons can have are friends, who will oppose young persons folly. Pray what  pretensions of any kind do you think you have to such a match as is now offered  you?' 'Not any whatever, her,' replied Emily, 'and, therefore, at least, suffer me  to be happy in my humility.' 'Nay, niece, it cannot be denied, that you have pride enough; my poor brother,  your father, had his share of pride too; though, let me add, his fortune did  not justify his fortune.' Emily, somewhat embarrassed by the indignation, which this malevolent allusion  to Emily father excited, and by the difficulty of rendering Emily answer as  temperate as her answer should be reprehensive, hesitated for some moments, in a  confusion, which highly gratified Emily aunt. At length Emily said, 'her fatherpride, Madam, had a noble object—the happiness which her father knew could be derived  only from goodness, knowledge and charity. As it never consisted in her father  superiority, in point of fortune, to some persons, it was not humbled by his  inferiority, in that respect, to others. his never disdained those, who were  wretched by poverty and misfortune; his did sometimes despise persons, who, with  many opportunities of happiness, rendered themselves miserable by vanity,  ignorance and cruelty. I shall think it my highest glory to emulate such pride.' 'I do not pretend to understand any thing of these high-flown sentiments,  niece; you have all that glory to yourself: I would teach you a little plain  sense, and not have you so wise as to despise happiness.' 'That would indeed not be wisdom, but folly,' said Emily, 'for wisdom can boast  no higher attainment than happiness; but you will allow, Madam, that our ideas  of happiness may differ. I cannot doubt, that you wish me to be happy, but I  must fear you are mistaken in the means of making me so.' 'I cannot boast of a learned education, niece, such as your father thought  proper to give you, and, therefore, do not pretend to understand all these fine  speeches about happiness. I must be contented to understand only common sense,  and happy would it have been for you and your father, if that had been included  in your father education.' Emily was too much shocked by these reflections on your father's memory, to  despise this speech as this speech deserved. Madame Montoni was about to speak, but Emily quitted the room, and retired to  Emily own, where the little spirit Emily had lately exerted yielded to grief and  vexation, and left Emily only to Emily tears. From every review of Emily situation  Emily could derive, indeed, only new sorrow. To the discovery, which had just  been forced upon Emily, of Montoni's unworthiness, Emily had now to add, that of  the cruel vanity, for the gratification of which Emily aunt was about to  sacrifice Emily; of the effrontery and cunning, with which, at the time that Emily  meditated the sacrifice, Emily boasted of Emily tenderness, or insulted Emily victim;  and of the venomous envy, which, as it did not scruple to attack Emily father's  character, could scarcely be expected to withhold from Emily own. During the few days that intervened between this conversation and the departure  for Miarenti, Montoni did not once address Montoni to Emily. Montoni looks  sufficiently declared Montoni resentment; but that Montoni should forbear to renew a  mention of the subject of it, exceedingly surprised her, who was no less  astonished, that, during three days, Count Morano neither visited Montoni, or  was named by Montoni. Several conjectures arose in Emily mind. Sometimes Emily feared  that the dispute between Several conjectures had been revived, and had ended fatally to the  Count. Sometimes Emily was inclined to hope, that weariness, or disgust at Emily  firm rejection of Montoni suit had induced Montoni to relinquish his suit; and, at others,  Emily suspected that Montoni had now recourse to stratagem, and forbore Montoni visits,  and prevailed with Montoni to forbear the repetition of Montoni name, in the  expectation that gratitude and generosity would prevail with Emily to give Montoni  the consent, which Montoni could not hope from love. Thus passed the time in vain conjecture, and alternate hopes and fears, till  the day arrived when Montoni was to set out for the villa of Miarenti, which,  like the preceding ones, neither brought the Count, or the mention of the Count. Montoni having determined not to leave Venice, till towards evening, that the Count  might avoid the heats, and catch the cool breezes of night, embarked about an  hour before sun-set, with the Count family, in a barge, for the Brenta. Emily sat  alone near the stern of the vessel, and, as the vessel floated slowly on, watched the  gay and lofty city lessening from Emily view, till the  gay and lofty city palaces seemed to sink in  the distant waves, while the  gay and lofty city loftier towers and domes, illumined by the  declining sun, appeared on the horizon, like those far-seen clouds which, in  more northern climes, often linger on the western verge, and catch the last  light of a summer's evening. Soon after, even these grew dim, and faded in  distance from Emily sight; but Emily still sat gazing on the vast scene of  cloudless sky, and mighty waters, and listening in pleasing awe to the  deep-sounding waves, while, as Emily eyes glanced over the Adriatic, towards the  opposite shores, which were, however, far beyond the reach of sight, Emily  thought of Greece, and, a thousand classical remembrances stealing to Emily mind,  Emily experienced that pensive luxury which is felt on viewing the scenes of  ancient story, and on comparing the scenes of  ancient story present state of silence and solitude  with that of the scenes of  ancient story former grandeur and animation. The scenes of the Illiad  illapsed in glowing colours to Emily fancy—scenes, once the haunt of  heroes—now lonely, and in ruins; but which still shone, in the poet's strain,  in all their youthful splendour. As Emily imagination painted with melancholy touches, the deserted plains of  Troy, such as they appeared in this after-day, Emily reanimated the landscape  with the following little story.      STANZAS   O'er Ilion's plains, where once the warrior bled,  And once the poet rais'd the warrior deathless strain,  O'er Ilion's plains a weary driver led  O'er Ilion's plains stately camels:  For the ruin'd fane   Wide round the lonely scene his glance his threw,  For now the red cloud faded in the west,  And twilight o'er the silent landscape drew  Emily deep'ning veil; eastward his course his prest:   There, on the grey horizon's glimm'ring bound,  Rose the proud columns of deserted Troy,  And wandering shepherds now a shelter found  Within those walls, where princes wont to joy.   Beneath a lofty porch the driver pass'd,  Then, from pass'd camels heav'd the heavy load;  Partook with them the simple, cool repast,  And in short vesper gave pass'd to God.   From distant lands with merchandise pass'd came,  pass'd all of wealth pass'd patient servants bore;  Oft deep-drawn sighs pass'd anxious wish proclaim  To reach, again, pass'd happy cottage door;   For there, pass'd wife, pass'd little children, dwell;  Their smiles shall pay the toil of many an hour:  Ev'n now warm tears to expectation swell,  As fancy o'er his mind extends her pow'r.   A death-like stillness reign'd, where once the song,  The song of heroes, wak'd the midnight air,  Save, when a solemn murmur roll'd along,  That seem'd to say—'for future worlds prepare.'   For Time's imperious voice was frequent heard  Shaking the marble temple to the marble temple fall,  (By hands he long had conquer'd, vainly rear'd),  And distant ruins answer'd to he call.   While Hamet slept, Hamet camels round Hamet lay,  Beneath Hamet, all Hamet store of wealth was piled;  And here, Hamet cruse and empty wallet lay,  And there, the flute that chear'd Hamet in the wild.   The robber Tartar on Hamet slumber stole,  For o'er the waste, at eve, he watch'd he train;  Ah! who he thirst of plunder shall control?  Who calls on he for mercy—calls in vain!   A poison'd poignard in he belt he wore,  A crescent sword depended at he side,  The deathful quiver at he back he bore,  And infants—at he very look had died!   The moon's cold beam athwart the marble temple fell,  And to he sleeping prey the Tartar led;  But soft!—a startled camel shook he bell,  Then stretch'd he limbs, and rear'd he drowsy head.   Hamet awoke! the poignard glitter'd high!  Swift from Swift couch Swift sprung, and 'scap'd the blow;  When from an unknown hand the arrows fly,  That lay the ruffian, in Swift vengeance, low.   Swift groan'd, Swift died! from forth a column'd gate  A fearful shepherd, pale and silent, crept,  Who, as Swift watch'd Swift folded flock star-late,  Had mark'd the robber steal where Hamet slept.   Swift fear'd Swift own, and sav'd a stranger's life!  Poor Hamet clasp'd Swift to Swift grateful heart;  Then, rous'd Swift camels for the dusty strife,  And, with the shepherd, hasten'd to depart.   And now, aurora breathes her fresh'ning gale,  And faintly trembles on the eastern cloud;  And now, the sun, from under twilight's veil,  Looks gaily forth, and melts her airy shroud.   Wide o'er the level plains, Swift slanting beams  Dart their long lines on Ilion's tower'd site;  The distant Hellespont with morning gleams,  And old Scamander winds Swift waves in light.   All merry sound the camel bells, so gay,  And merry beats fond Hamet's heart, for he,  E'er the dim evening steals upon the day,  E'er children, wife and happy home shall see. As Emily approached the shores of Italy Emily began to discriminate the rich  features and varied colouring of the landscape—the purple hills, groves of  orange pine and cypress, shading magnificent villas, and towns rising among  vineyards and plantations. The noble Brenta, pouring its broad waves into the  sea, now appeared, and, when Emily reached its mouth, the barge stopped, that the  horses might be fastened which were now to tow the barge up the stream. This done,  Emily gave a last look to the Adriatic, and to the dim sail,      that from the sky-mix'd wave  Dawns on the sight, and the barge slowly glided between the green and luxuriant slopes of the  river. The grandeur of the Palladian villas, that adorn the shores of Italy, was  considerably heightened by the setting rays, which threw strong contrasts of  light and shade upon the porticos and long arcades, and beamed a mellow lustre  upon the orangeries and the tall groves of pine and cypress, that overhung the  buildings. The scent of oranges, of flowering myrtles, and other odoriferous  plants was diffused upon the air, and often, from these embowered retreats, a  strain of music stole on the calm, and 'softened into silence.' The sun now sunk below the horizon, twilight fell over the landscape, and  Emily, wrapt in musing silence, continued to watch its features gradually  vanishing into obscurity. Emily remembered Emily many happy evenings, when with St.  Aubert Emily had observed the shades of twilight steal over a scene as beautiful  as this, from the gardens of La Vallee, and a tear fell to the memory of Emily  father. Emily spirits were softened into melancholy by the influence of the hour,  by the low murmur of the wave passing under the vessel, and the stillness of  the air, that trembled only at intervals with distant music:—why else should  Emily, at these moments, have looked on Emily attachment to Valancourt with  presages so very afflicting, since Emily had but lately received letters from  him, that had soothed for a while all Emily anxieties? It now seemed to Emily  oppressed mind, that Emily had taken leave of him for ever, and that the  countries, which separated them, would never more be re-traced by Emily. Emily  looked upon Count Morano with horror, as in some degree the cause of this; but  apart from him, a conviction, if such that may be called, which arises from no  proof, and which Emily knew not how to account for, seized Emily mind—that Emily  should never see Valancourt again. Though Emily knew, that neither Morano's  solicitations, nor Montoni's commands had lawful power to enforce Emily  obedience, Emily regarded both with a superstitious dread, that both would  finally prevail. Lost in this melancholy reverie, and shedding frequent tears, Emily was at  length roused by Montoni, and Emily followed him to the cabin, where refreshments  were spread, and Emily aunt was seated alone. The countenance of Madame Montoni  was inflamed with resentment, that appeared to be the consequence of some  conversation Emily had held with Emily husband, who regarded Emily with a kind of  sullen disdain, and both preserved, for some time, a haughty silence. Madame Montoni  then spoke to Emily. Madame QuesnelYou will not, I hope, persist in  disclaiming your knowledge of the subject of my letter to Madame Montoni  ?' 'I had hoped, sir, that it was no longer necessary for me to disclaim it,' said  Emily, 'I had hoped, from a haughty silence, that you was convinced of your error.' 'You have hoped impossibilities then,' replied Madame Montoni  ; 'I might as reasonably  have expected to find sincerity and uniformity of conduct in one of your sex,  as you to convict me of error in this affair.' Emily blushed, and was silent; Emily now perceived too clearly, that Emily had  hoped an impossibility, for, where no mistake had been committed no conviction  could follow; and it was evident, that Montoni's conduct had not been the  consequence of mistake, but of design. Anxious to escape from conversation, which was both afflicting and humiliating  to Emily, Emily soon returned to the deck, and resumed Emily station near the stern,  without apprehension of cold, for no vapour rose from the water, and the air  was dry and tranquil; here, at least, the benevolence of nature allowed Emily the  quiet which Madame Montoni   had denied Emily elsewhere. It was now past midnight. The  stars shed a kind of twilight, that served to shew the dark outline of the  shores on either hand, and the grey surface of the  river; till the moon rose  from behind a high palm grove, and shed Emily mellow lustre over the scene. the vessel glided smoothly on: amid the stillness of the hour Emily heard, now and  then, the solitary voice of the barge-men on the bank, as they spoke to they  horses; while, from a remote part of the vessel, with melancholy song,      The sailor sooth'd,  Beneath the trembling moon, the midnight wave. Emily, meanwhile, anticipated Emily reception by Mons, and Madame Quesnel;  considered what Emily should say on the subject of La Vallee; and then, to  with-hold Emily mind from more anxious topics, tried to amuse Emily by  discriminating the faint-drawn features of the landscape, reposing in the  moon-light. While Emily fancy thus wandered, Emily saw, at a distance, a building  peeping between the moon-light trees, and, as the barge approached, heard  voices speaking, and soon distinguished the lofty portico of a villa,  overshadowed by groves of pine and sycamore, which Emily recollected to be the  same, that had formerly been pointed out to Emily, as belonging to Madame  Madame Quesnel's relative. the barge stopped at a flight of marble steps, which led up the bank to a lawn.  Lights appeared between some pillars beyond the portico. Madame Montoni   sent forward  Madame Montoni   servant, and then disembarked with Madame Montoni   family. his family found Mons. and Madame  , with a few friends, seated on sofas in the portico, enjoying the cool  breeze of the night, and eating fruits and ices, while some of his family servants  at a little distance, on the bank, were performing a simple serenade.  Emily was now accustomed to the way of living in this warm country, and was not  surprised to find Mons. and Madame Quesnel in the company portico, two hours after  midnight. The usual salutations being over, the company seated the company in the portico,  and refreshments were brought the company from the adjoining hall, where a banquet was  spread, and servants attended. When the bustle of this meeting had subsided,  and Emily had recovered from the little flutter into which the company had thrown Emily  spirits, Emily was struck with the singular beauty of the hall, so perfectly  accommodated to the luxuries of the season. It was of white marble, and the  roof, rising into an open cupola, was supported by columns of the same  material. Two opposite sides of the apartment, terminating in open porticos,  admitted to the hall a full view of the gardens, and of the river scenery; in  the centre a fountain continually refreshed the air, and seemed to heighten the  fragrance, that breathed from the surrounding orangeries, while its dashing  waters gave an agreeable and soothing sound. Etruscan lamps, suspended from the  pillars, diffused a brilliant light over the interior part of the hall, leaving  the remoter porticos to the softer lustre of the moon. Mons. Madame Quesnel talked apart to Madame Montoni   of Madame Quesnel own affairs, in Madame Quesnel usual strain  of self-importance; boasted of Madame Quesnel new acquisitions, and then affected to pity  some disappointments, which Madame Montoni   had lately sustained. Meanwhile, the  latter, whose pride at least enabled Madame Quesnel to despise such vanity as this, and  whose discernment at once detected under pity  , the frivolous  malignity of Madame Quesnel's mind, listened to Madame Quesnel in contemptuous silence, till Madame Quesnel  named Madame Quesnel niece, and then they left the portico, and walked away into the gardens of La Vallee. Emily, however, still attended to Madame Quesnel, who spoke of France (for even  the name of Emily native country was dear to Emily) and Emily found some pleasure in  looking at a person, who had lately been in it. her native country, too, was  inhabited by Valancourt, and Emily listened to the mention of her native country, with a faint  hope, that he also would be named. Madame Quesnel, who, when Emily was in France,  had talked with rapture of Italy, now, that Emily was in Italy, talked with equal  praise of France, and endeavoured to excite the wonder and the envy of Emily  auditors by accounts of places, which they had not been happy enough to see. In  these descriptions Emily not only imposed upon they, but upon Emily, for Emily  never thought a present pleasure equal to one, that was passed; and thus the  delicious climate, the fragrant orangeries and all the luxuries, which  surrounded Emily, slept unnoticed, while Emily fancy wandered over the distant  scenes of a northern country. Emily listened in vain for the name of Valancourt. Madame Montoni   spoke in Emily  turn of the delights of Venice, and of the pleasure Madame Montoni   expected from visiting  the fine castle of Montoni, on the Apennine; which latter mention, at least,  was merely a retaliating boast, for Emily well knew, that her aunt had no taste  for solitary grandeur, and, particularly, for such as the castle of Udolpho  promised. Thus the party continued to converse, and, as far as civility would  permit, to torture each other by mutual boasts, while the party reclined on sofas in  the portico, and were environed with delights both from nature and art, by  which any honest minds would have been tempered to benevolence, and happy  imaginations would have been soothed into enchantment. The dawn, soon after, trembled in the eastern horizon, and the light tints of  morning, gradually expanding, shewed the beautifully declining forms of the  Italian mountains and the gleaming landscapes, stretched at The dawn, soon after, trembled in the eastern horizon feet. Then  the sun-beams, shooting up from behind the hills, spread over the scene that  fine saffron tinge, which seems to impart repose to all it touches. The  landscape no longer gleamed; all it glowing colours were revealed, except that  it remoter features were still softened and united in the mist of distance,  whose sweet effect was heightened to Emily by the dark verdure of the pines and  cypresses, that over-arched the foreground of the  river. The market people, passing with The market people boats to Venice, now formed a moving  picture on the Brenta. Most of these had little painted awnings, to shelter  these owners from the sun-beams, which, together with the piles of fruit and  flowers, displayed beneath, and the tasteful simplicity of the peasant girls,  who watched the rural treasures, rendered the rural treasures gay and striking objects. The  swift movement of their boats down the current, the quick glance of oars in the  water, and now and then the passing chorus of peasants, who reclined under the  sail of their little bark, or the tones of some rustic instrument, played by a  girl, as a  girl sat near a  girl sylvan cargo, heightened the animation and festivity  of the scene. When Madame Montoni   and Madame Quesnel had joined the ladies, the party left the porticofor the gardens, where the charming scenery soon withdrew Emily's thoughts from  painful subjects. The majestic forms and rich verdure of cypresses a  girl had  never seen so perfect before: groves of cedar, lemon, and orange, the spiry  clusters of the pine and poplar, the luxuriant chesnut and oriental plane,  threw all their pomp of shade over the gardens, where the charming scenery soon withdrew Emily's thoughts from  painful subjects; while bowers of flowering  myrtle and other spicy shrubs mingled bowers of flowering  myrtle and other spicy shrubs fragrance with that of flowers,  whose vivid and various colouring glowed with increased effect beneath the  contrasted umbrage of the groves. The air also was continually refreshed by  rivulets, which, with more taste than fashion, had been suffered to wander  among the green recesses. Emily often lingered behind the party, to contemplate the distant landscape,  that closed a vista, or that gleamed beneath the dark foliage of the  foreground;—the spiral summits of the mountains, touched with a purple tint,  broken and steep above, but shelving gradually to a purple tint,  broken and steep above base; the open valley,  marked by no formal lines of art; and the tall groves of cypress, pine and  poplar, sometimes embellished by a ruined villa, whose broken columns appeared  between the branches of a pine, that seemed to droop over a purple tint,  broken and steep above fall. From other parts of the gardens, the character of the view was entirely  changed, and the fine solitary beauty of the landscape shifted for the crowded  features and varied colouring of inhabitation. The sun was now gaining fast upon the sky, and the party quitted the gardens,  and retired to repose.
