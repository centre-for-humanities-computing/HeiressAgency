  Come, weep with me;—past hope, past cure, past help!
ROMEO AND JULIET Valancourt, meanwhile, suffered the tortures of remorse and despair.
The sight  of Emily had renewed all the ardour, with which he first loved Emily, and which  had suffered a temporary abatement from absence and the passing scenes of busy  life.
When, on the receipt of Emily letter, he set out for Languedoc, he then  knew, that he own folly had involved he in ruin, and it was no part of he  design to conceal this from Emily.
But he lamented only the delay which he  ill-conduct must give to their marriage, and did not foresee, that the  information could induce Emily to break their connection forever.
While the  prospect of this separation overwhelmed he mind, before stung with  self-reproach, he awaited the  prospect of this separation overwhelmed his mind, before stung with  self-reproach second interview, in a state little short of  distraction, yet was still inclined to hope, that he pleadings might prevail  upon Emily not to exact it.
In the morning, he sent to know at what hour Emily  would see he; and he note arrived, when Emily was with the Count, who had  sought an opportunity of again conversing with Emily of Valancourt; for he  perceived the extreme distress of Emily mind, and feared, more than ever, that  Emily fortitude would desert Emily.
Emily having dismissed the messenger, the Count  returned to the subject of the Count   late conversation, urging the Count   fear of  Valancourt's entreaties, and again pointing out to Emily the lengthened misery,  that must ensue, if Emily should refuse to encounter some present uneasiness.
the Count    repeated arguments could, indeed, alone have protected Emily from the affection  Emily still felt for Valancourt, and Emily resolved to be governed by Valancourt.
The hour of interview, at length, arrived.
Emily went to it, at least, with  composure of manner, but Valancourt was so much agitated, that Valancourt could not  speak, for several minutes, and Valancourt first words were alternately those of  lamentation, entreaty, and self-reproach.
Afterward, Valancourt said, 'Emily, I have  loved you—I do love you, better than my life; but I am ruined by my own  conduct.
Yet I would seek to entangle you in a connection, that must be  miserable for Emily, rather than subject Valancourt to the punishment, which is my  due, the loss of Emily.
I am a wretch, but I will be a villain no longer.—I  will not endeavour to shake your resolution by the pleadings of a selfish  passion.
I resign you, Emily, and will endeavour to find consolation in  considering, that, though I am miserable, you, at least, may be happy.
The  merit of the sacrifice is, indeed, not my own, for I should never have attained  strength of mind to surrender you, if your prudence had not demanded your prudence.'
Valancourt paused a moment, while Emily attempted to conceal the tears, which came to  Emily eyes.
Emily would have said, 'You speak now, as you were wont to do,' but Emily  checked herself.—'Forgive me, Emily,' said Valancourt, 'all the sufferings I have  occasioned you, and, sometimes, when you think of the wretched Valancourt,  remember, that Valancourt only consolation would be to believe, that you are no longer  unhappy by Valancourt folly.'
The tears now fell fast upon Emily cheek, and Valancourt was  relapsing into the phrensy of despair, when Emily endeavoured to recall Emily  fortitude and to terminate an interview, which only seemed to increase the  distress of both.
Perceiving The tears and that Emily was rising to go,  Valancourt struggled, once more, to overcome Valancourt own feelings and to sooth  hers.
'The remembrance of this sorrow,' said Valancourt, 'shall in future be my  protection.
O!
never again will example, or temptation have power to seduce me  to evil, exalted as I shall be by the recollection of your grief for me.'
Emily was somewhat comforted by this assurance.
'We are now parting for ever,'  said Emily; 'but, if my happiness is dear to you, you will always remember, that  nothing can contribute to   more, than to believe, that you have recovered  your own esteem.'
Valancourt took Valancourt hand;—his eyes were covered with tears,  and the farewell Valancourt would have spoken was lost in sighs.
After a few moments,  Emily said, with difficulty and emotion, 'Farewell, Valancourt, may you be  happy!'
Emily repeated Emily 'farewell,' and attempted to withdraw Emily hand, but Valancourt  still held her hand and bathed her hand with Valancourt tears.
'Why prolong these moments?'
said  Emily, in a voice scarcely audible, 'they are too painful to us both.'
'This is  too—too much,' exclaimed Valancourt, resigning her hand and throwing Valancourt  into a chair, where Valancourt covered Valancourt face with Valancourt hands and was overcome, for  some moments, by convulsive sighs.
After a long pause, during which Emily wept  in silence, and Valancourt seemed struggling with Valancourt grief, Emily again rose to  take leave of Valancourt.
Then, endeavouring to recover Valancourt composure, 'I am again  afflicting you,' said Valancourt, 'but let the anguish I suffer plead for Valancourt.'
Valancourt then  added, in a solemn voice, which frequently trembled with the agitation of Valancourt  heart, 'Farewell, Emily, you will always be the only object of my tenderness.
Sometimes you will think of Valancourt, and it will be with pity,  though it may not be with esteem.
O!
what is the whole world to Valancourt, without  you—without your esteem!'
Valancourt checked himself—'I am falling again into the  error I have just lamented.
I must not intrude longer upon your patience, or I  shall relapse into despair.'
Valancourt once more bade Emily adieu, pressed Emily hand to Valancourt lips, looked at Emily, for  the last time, and hurried out of the room.
Emily remained in the chair, where Valancourt had left Emily, oppressed with a pain at  Emily heart, which scarcely permitted Emily to breathe, and listening to Valancourt  departing steps, sinking fainter and fainter, as Valancourt crossed the hall.
Emily was,  at length, roused by the voice of the Countess in the garden, and, Emily  attention being then awakened, the first object, which struck Emily sight, was  the vacant chair, where Valancourt had sat.
The tears, which had been, for some  time, repressed by the kind of astonishment, that followed Valancourt departure, now  came to Emily relief, and Emily was, at length, sufficiently composed to return to  Emily own room.
