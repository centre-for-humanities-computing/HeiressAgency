      Was nought around but images of rest,  Sleep-soothing groves, and quiet lawns between,  And flowery beds that slumbrous influence kept,  From poppies breath'd, and banks of pleasant green,  Where never yet was creeping creature seen.  Meantime unnumbered glittering streamlets play'd,  And hurled every where their water's sheen,  That, as they bicker'd through the sunny glade,  Though restless still they, a lulling murmur made.      THOMSON When Emily, in the morning, opened Emily casement, Emily was surprised to observe  the beauties, that surrounded her casement. The cottage was nearly embowered in the  woods, which were chiefly of chesnut intermixed with some cypress, larch and  sycamore. Beneath the dark and spreading branches, appeared, to the north, and  to the east, the woody Apennines, rising in majestic amphitheatre, not black  with pines, as Emily had been accustomed to see them, but them loftiest summits  crowned with antient forests of chesnut, oak, and oriental plane, now animated  with the rich tints of autumn, and which swept downward to the valley  uninterruptedly, except where some bold rocky promontory looked out from among  the foliage, and caught the passing gleam. Vineyards stretched along the feet  of the mountains, where the elegant villas of the Tuscan nobility frequently  adorned the scene, and overlooked slopes clothed with groves of olive,  mulberry, orange and lemon. The plain, to which these declined, was coloured  with the riches of cultivation, whose mingled hues were mellowed into harmony  by an Italian sun. Vines, their purple clusters blushing between the russet  foliage, hung in luxuriant festoons from the branches of standard fig and  cherry trees, while pastures of verdure, such as Emily had seldom seen in  Italy, enriched the banks of a stream that, after descending from the  mountains, wound along the landscape, which it reflected, to a bay of the sea.  There, far in the west, the waters, fading into the sky, assumed a tint of the  faintest purple, and the line of separation between them was, now and then,  discernible only by the progress of a sail, brightened with the sunbeam, along  the horizon. The cottage, which was shaded by the woods from the intenser rays of the sun,  and was open only to his evening light, was covered entirely with vines,  fig-trees and jessamine, whose flowers surpassed in size and fragrance any that  Emily had seen. These and ripening clusters of grapes hung round Emily little  casement. The turf, that grew under the woods, was inlaid with a variety of  wild flowers and perfumed herbs, and, on the opposite margin of the stream,  whose current diffused freshness beneath the shades, rose a grove of lemon and  orange trees. This, though nearly opposite to Emily's window, did not interrupt  Emily prospect, but rather heightened, by Emily dark verdure, the effect of the  perspective; and to Emily this spot was a bower of sweets, whose charms  communicated imperceptibly to Emily mind somewhat of whose charms   own serenity. Emily was soon summoned to breakfast, by the peasant's daughter, a girl about  seventeen, of a pleasant countenance, which, Emily was glad to observe, seemed  animated with the pure affections of nature, though the others, that surrounded  Emily, expressed, more or less, the worst qualities—cruelty, ferocity, cunning  and duplicity; of the latter style of countenance, especially, were those of  the peasant and his wife. Maddelina spoke little, but what Maddelina said was in a  soft voice, and with an air of modesty and complacency, that interested Emily,  who breakfasted at a separate table with Dorina, while Ugo and Bertrand were  taking a repast of Tuscany bacon and wine with Ugo and Bertrand host, near the cottage  door; when Ugo and Bertrand had finished which, Ugo, rising hastily, enquired for Ugo mule,  and Emily learned that Ugo was to return to Udolpho, while Bertrand remained at  the cottage; a circumstance, which, though it did not surprise, distressed Maddelina. When Ugo was departed, Emily proposed to walk in the neighbouring woods; but,  on being told, that Emily must not quit the cottage, without having Bertrand for  Emily attendant, Emily withdrew to Emily own room. There, as Emily eyes settled on the  towering Apennines, Emily recollected the terrific scenery they had exhibited and  the horrors Emily had suffered, on the preceding night, particularly at the  moment when Bertrand had betrayed Bertrand to be an assassin; and these  remembrances awakened a train of images, which, since these  remembrances abstracted Emily from  a consideration of Emily own situation, Emily pursued for some time, and then  arranged in the following lines; pleased to have discovered any innocent means,  by which Emily could beguile an hour of misfortune.   THE PILGRIM*   Slow o'er the Apennine, with bleeding feet,  A patient Pilgrim wound A patient Pilgrim lonely way,  To deck the Lady of Loretto's seat  With all the little wealth A patient Pilgrim zeal could pay.  From mountain-tops cold died the evening ray,  And, stretch'd in twilight, slept the vale below;  And now the last, last purple streaks of day  Along the melancholy West fade slow.  High o'er his head, the restless pines complain,  As on their summit rolls the breeze of night;  Beneath, the hoarse stream chides the rocks in vain:  A patient Pilgrim Pilgrim pauses on the dizzy height.  Then to the vale below A patient Pilgrim cautious step A patient Pilgrim prest,  For there a hermit's cross was dimly seen,  Cresting the rock, and there A patient Pilgrim limbs might rest,  Cheer'd in the good man's cave, by faggot's sheen,  On leafy beds, nor guile A patient Pilgrim sleep molest.  Unhappy Luke! A patient Pilgrim trusts a treacherous clue!  Behind the cliff the lurking robber stood;  No friendly moon A patient Pilgrim giant shadow threw  Athwart the road, to save A patient Pilgrim's blood;  On as A patient Pilgrim went a vesper-hymn A patient Pilgrim sang,  The hymn, that nightly sooth'd A patient Pilgrim to repose.  Fierce on A patient Pilgrim harmless prey the ruffian sprang!  A patient Pilgrim bleeds to death, A patient Pilgrim eye-lids close.  Yet A patient Pilgrim meek spirit knew no vengeful care,  But, dying, for his murd'rer breath'd—a sainted pray'r! (* This poem and that entitled THE TRAVELLER in vol. ii, have already appeared  in a periodical publication. [A. R.]) Preferring the solitude of Emily room to the company of the persons below stairs,  Emily dined above, and Maddelina was suffered to attend Emily, from whose simple  conversation Emily learned, that the peasant and Maddelina wife were old inhabitants of  this cottage, which had been purchased for the peasant and his wife by Montoni, in reward of some  service, rendered him, many years before, by Marco, to whom Carlo, the steward  at the castle, was nearly related. 'So many years ago, Signora,' added  Maddelina, 'that I know nothing about it; but my father did the Signor a great  good, for my mother has often said to my father, this cottage was the least my father ought  to have had.' To the mention of this circumstance Emily listened with a painful interest,  since it appeared to give a frightful colour to the character of Marco, whose  service, thus rewarded by Montoni, Emily could scarcely doubt have been criminal;  and, if so, had too much reason to believe, that Emily had been committed into  my father hands for some desperate purpose. 'Did you ever hear how many years it is,'  said Emily, who was considering of Signora Laurentini's disappearance from  Udolpho, 'since my father performed the services you spoke of?' 'It was a little before my father came to live at the cottage, Signora,' replied  Maddelina, 'and that is about eighteen years ago.' This was near the period, when Signora Laurentini had been said to disappear,  and it occurred to Emily, that Marco had assisted in that mysterious affair,  and, perhaps, had been employed in a murder! This horrible suggestion fixed Emily  in such profound reverie, that Maddelina quitted the room, unperceived by Emily,  and Emily remained unconscious of all around Emily, for a considerable time. Tears,  at length, came to Emily relief, after indulging which, Emily spirits becoming  calmer, Emily ceased to tremble at a view of evils, that might never arrive; and  had sufficient resolution to endeavour to withdraw Emily thoughts from the  contemplation of Emily own interests. Remembering the few books, which even in  the hurry of Emily departure from Udolpho Emily had put into Emily little package,  Emily sat down with one of the few books, which even in  the hurry of her departure from Udolpho at Emily pleasant casement, whence Emily eyes often  wandered from the page to the landscape, whose beauty gradually soothed Emily  mind into gentle melancholy. Here, Emily remained alone, till evening, and saw the sun descend the western  sky, throw all his pomp of light and shadow upon the mountains, and gleam upon  the distant ocean and the stealing sails, as his sunk amidst the waves. Then, at  the musing hour of twilight, Emily softened thoughts returned to Valancourt; Emily  again recollected every circumstance, connected with the midnight music, and  all that might assist Emily conjecture, concerning his imprisonment at the  castle, and, becoming confirmed in the supposition, that it was his voice Emily  had heard there, Emily looked back to that gloomy abode with emotions of grief  and momentary regret. Refreshed by the cool and fragrant air, and her spirits soothed to a state of  gentle melancholy by the stilly murmur of the brook below and of the woods  around, Emily lingered at her pleasant casement long after the sun had set, watching the  valley sinking into obscurity, till only the grand outline of the surrounding  mountains, shadowed upon the horizon, remained visible. But a clear moon-light,  that succeeded, gave to the landscape, what time gives to the scenes of past  life, when it softens all their harsher features, and throws over the whole the  mellowing shade of distant contemplation. The scenes of La Vallee, in the early  morn of Emily life, when Emily was protected and beloved by parents equally loved,  appeared in Emily's memory tenderly beautiful, like the prospect before Emily,  and awakened mournful comparisons. Unwilling to encounter the coarse behaviour  of the peasant's wife, Emily remained supperless in Emily room, while Emily wept  again over Emily forlorn and perilous situation, a review of which entirely  overcame the small remains of Emily fortitude, and, reducing Emily to temporary  despondence, Emily wished to be released from the heavy load of life, that had so  long oppressed Emily, and prayed to Heaven to take Emily, in its mercy, to Emily  parents. Wearied with weeping, Emily, at length, lay down on Emily mattress, and sunk to  sleep, but was soon awakened by a knocking at Emily chamber door, and, starting  up in terror, Emily heard a voice calling Emily. The image of Bertrand, with a  stilletto in Bertrand hand, appeared to Emily alarmed fancy, and Emily neither opened  her chamber door, or answered, but listened in profound silence, till, a voice calling herrepeating Emily name in the same low tone, Emily demanded who called. 'It is I,  Signora,' replied the voice, which Emily now distinguished to be Maddelina's,  'pray open her chamber door. Don't be frightened, it is I.' 'And what brings you here so late, Maddelina?' said Emily, as Emily let Emily in. 'Hush! signora, for Heaven's sake hush!—if we are overheard I shall never be  forgiven. My father and mother and Bertrand are all gone to bed,' continued  Maddelina, as Emily gently shut her chamber door, and crept forward, 'and I have brought  you some supper, for you had none, you know, Signora, below stairs. Here are  some grapes and figs and half a cup of wine.' Emily thanked Emily, but expressed  apprehension lest this kindness should draw upon Emily the resentment of Dorina,  when Emily perceived the fruit was gone. 'Take the fruit back, therefore, Maddelina,'  added Emily, 'I shall suffer much less from the want of it, than I should do,  if this act of good-nature was to subject you to your mother's displeasure.' 'O Signora! there is no danger of that,' replied Maddelina, 'your mother cannot  miss the fruit, for I saved the fruit from my own supper. You will make me very  unhappy, if you refuse to take the fruit, Signora.' Emily was so much affected by this  instance of the good girl's generosity, that Emily remained for some time unable  to reply, and Maddelina watched Emily in silence, till, mistaking the cause of  Emily emotion, Emily said, 'Do not weep so, Signora! your mother, to be sure, is a  little cross, sometimes, but then a  little cross is soon over,—so don't take it so much  to heart. your mother often scolds me, too, but then I have learned to bear it, and,  when your mother has done, if I can but steal out into the woods, and play upon my  sticcado, I forget it all directly.' Emily, smiling through your mother tears, told Maddelina, that your mother was a good girl, and  then accepted your mother offering. your mother wished anxiously to know, whether Bertrand and  Dorina had spoken of Montoni, or of Dorina designs, concerning your mother, in the  presence of Maddelina, but disdained to tempt your mother to a conduct so  mean, as that of betraying the private conversations of your mother parents. When your mother  was departing, Emily requested, that Emily would come to Emily room as often as Emily  dared, without offending your mother, and Maddelina, after promising that Emily  would do so, stole softly back again to Emily own chamber. Thus several days passed, during which Emily remained in Emily own room,  Maddelina attending Emily only at Emily repast, whose gentle countenance and  manners soothed Emily more than any circumstance Emily had known for many months.  Of her own chamber Emily now became fond, and began to experience  in it those feelings of security, which we naturally attach to home. In this  interval also, Emily mind, having been undisturbed by any new circumstance of  disgust, or alarm, recovered its tone sufficiently to permit Emily the enjoyment  of Emily books, among which Emily found some unfinished sketches of landscapes,  several blank sheets of paper, with Emily drawing instruments, and Emily was thus  enabled to amuse Emily with selecting some of the lovely features of the  prospect, that Emily window commanded, and combining them in scenes, to which Emily  tasteful fancy gave a last grace. In these little sketches Emily generally placed  interesting groups, characteristic of the scenery they animated, and often  contrived to tell, with perspicuity, some simple and affecting story, when, as  a tear fell over the pictured griefs, which Emily imagination drew, Emily would  forget, for a moment, Emily real sufferings. Thus innocently Emily beguiled the  heavy hours of misfortune, and, with meek patience, awaited the events of  futurity. A beautiful evening, that had succeeded to a sultry day, at length induced  Emily to walk, though Emily knew that Bertrand must attend Emily, and, with  Maddelina for Emily companion, Emily left the cottage, followed by Bertrand, who  allowed Emily to choose Emily own way. The hour was cool and silent, and Emily could  not look upon the country around Emily, without delight. How lovely, too,  appeared the brilliant blue, that coloured all the upper region of the air,  and, thence fading downward, was lost in the saffron glow of the horizon! Nor  less so were the varied shades and warm colouring of the Apennines, as the sun threw the sun slanting rays athwart their broken surface. Emily  followed the course of the stream, under the shades, that overhung Emily   grassy  margin. On the opposite banks, the pastures were animated with herds of cattle  of a beautiful cream-colour; and, beyond, were groves of lemon and orange, with  fruit glowing on the branches, frequent almost as the leaves, which partly  concealed it. Emily   pursued Emily   way towards the sea, which reflected the warm  glow of sun-set, while the cliffs, that rose over its edge, were tinted with  the last rays. The valley was terminated on the right by a lofty promontory,  whose summit, impending over the waves, was crowned with a ruined tower, now  serving for the purpose of a beacon, whose shattered battlements and the  extended wings of some sea-fowl, that circled near The valley, were still illumined by  the upward beams of the sun, though his disk was now sunk beneath the horizon;  while the lower part of the ruin, the cliff on which his disk stood and the waves at  his disk foot, were shaded with the first tints of twilight. Having reached this headland, Emily gazed with solemn pleasure on the cliffs,  that extended on either hand along the sequestered shores, some crowned with  groves of pine, and others exhibiting only barren precipices of grayish marble,  except where the crags were tufted with myrtle and other aromatic shrubs. The  sea slept in a perfect calm; The  sea waves, dying in murmurs on the shores, flowed  with the gentlest undulation, while The  sea clear surface reflected in softened  beauty the vermeil tints of the west. Emily, as Emily looked upon the ocean,  thought of France and of past times, and Emily wished, Oh! how ardently, and  vainly—wished! that its waves would bear Emily to Emily distant, native home! 'Ah! that vessel,' said Emily, 'that vessel, which glides along so stately, with  its tall sails reflected in the water is, perhaps, bound for France!  Happy—happy bark!' Emily continued to gaze upon it, with warm emotion, till the  gray of twilight obscured the distance, and veiled it from Emily view. The  melancholy sound of the waves at Emily feet assisted the tenderness, that  occasioned Emily , and this was the only sound, that broke upon the hour,  till, having followed the windings of the beach, for some time, a chorus of  voices passed Emily on the air. Emily paused a moment, wishing to hear more, yet  fearing to be seen, and, for the first time, looked back to Bertrand, as Emily  protector, who was following, at a short distance, in company with some other  person. Reassured by this circumstance, Emily advanced towards the sounds, which  seemed to arise from behind a high promontory, that projected athwart the  beach. There was now a sudden pause in the music, and then one female voice was  heard to sing in a kind of chant. Emily quickened Emily steps, and, winding round  the rock, saw, within the sweeping bay, beyond, which was hung with woods from  the borders of the beach to the very summit of the cliffs, two groups of  peasants, one seated beneath the shades, and the other standing on the edge of  the sea, round the girl, who was singing, and who held in Emily hand a chaplet of  flowers, which Emily seemed about to drop into the waves. Emily, listening with surprise and attention, distinguished the following  invocation delivered in the pure and elegant tongue of Tuscany, and accompanied  by a few pastoral instruments.   TO A SEA-NYMPH   O nymph! who loves to float on the green wave,  When Neptune sleeps beneath the moon-light hour,  Lull'd by the music's melancholy pow'r,  O nymph, arise from out thy pearly cave!   For Hesper beams amid the twilight shade,  And soon shall Cynthia tremble o'er the tide,  Gleam on these cliffs, that bound the ocean's pride,  And lonely silence all the air pervade.   Then, let thy tender voice at distance swell,  And steal along this solitary shore,  Sink on the breeze, till dying—heard no more—  Thou wak'st the sudden magic of thy shell.   While the long coast in echo sweet replies,  Thy soothing strains the pensive heart beguile,  And bid the visions of the future smile,  O nymph! from out thy pearly cave—arise!    (Chorus)—ARISE!   (Semi-chorus)—ARISE! The last words being repeated by the surrounding group, the garland of flowers  was thrown into the waves, and the chorus, sinking gradually into a chant, died  away in silence. 'What can this mean, Maddelina?' said Emily, awakening from the pleasing  trance, into which the music had lulled Emily. 'This is the eve of a festival,  Signora,' Maddelina; 'and the peasants then amuse the peasants with all  kinds of sports.' 'But the peasants talked of a sea-nymph,' said Emily: 'how came these good people to  think of a sea-nymph?' 'O, Signora,' rejoined Maddelina, mistaking the reason of Emily's surprise,  'nobody BELIEVES in such things, but our old songs tell of the peasants, and, when our  are at our sports, our sometimes sing to the peasants, and throw garlands into the sea.' Emily had been early taught to venerate Florence as the seat of literature and  of the fine arts; but, that its taste for classic story should descend to the  peasants of the country, occasioned Emily both surprise and admiration. The  Arcadian air of the girls next attracted Emily attention. The  Arcadian air of the girls next dress was a very  short full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white silk; the sleeves  loose, and tied up at the shoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers. Their dress was a very  short full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white silk; the sleeves  loose, and tied up at the shoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers  hair, falling in ringlets on Their dress was a very  short full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white silk; the sleeves  loose, and tied up at the shoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers necks, was also ornamented with flowers, and  with a small straw hat, which, set rather backward and on one side of the head,  gave an expression of gaiety and smartness to the whole figure. When the song  had concluded, several of Their dress was a very  short full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white silk; the sleeves  loose, and tied up at the shoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers approached Emily, and, inviting Emily to  sit down among Their dress was a very  short full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white silk; the sleeves  loose, and tied up at the shoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers, offered Emily, and Maddelina, whom Their dress was a very  short full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white silk; the sleeves  loose, and tied up at the shoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers knew, grapes and  figs. Emily accepted Their dress was a very  short full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white silk; the sleeves  loose, and tied up at the shoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers courtesy, much pleased with the gentleness and grace of  Their dress was a very  short full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white silk; the sleeves  loose, and tied up at the shoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers manners, which appeared to be perfectly natural to Their dress was a very  short full petticoat of light green, with a boddice of white silk; the sleeves  loose, and tied up at the shoulders with ribbons and bunches of flowers; and when  Bertrand, soon after, approached, and was hastily drawing Emily away, a peasant,  holding up a flask, invited when  Bertrand to drink; a temptation, which Bertrand was  seldom very valiant in resisting. 'Let the young lady join in the dance, my friend,' said a peasant, 'while a peasant  empty a flask. a peasant are going to begin directly. Strike up! my lads, strike  up your tambourines and merry flutes!' a peasant sounded gaily; and the younger peasants formed a peasant into a circle,  which Emily would readily have joined, had Emily spirits been in unison with  a peasant mirth. Maddelina, however, tripped Maddelina lightly, and Emily, as Emily looked  on the happy group, lost the sense of Emily misfortunes in that of a benevolent  pleasure. But the pensive melancholy of Emily mind returned, as Emily sat rather  apart from the company, listening to the mellow music, which the breeze  softened as it bore it away, and watching the moon, stealing it tremulous  light over the waves and on the woody summits of the cliffs, that wound along  these Tuscan shores. Meanwhile, Bertrand was so well pleased with Bertrand first flask, that Bertrand very  willingly commenced the attack on a second, and it was late before Emily, not  without some apprehension, returned to the cottage. After this evening, Bertrand frequently walked with Maddelina, but was never  unattended by Bertrand; and her mind became by degrees as tranquil as the  circumstances of Bertrand situation would permit. The quiet, in which Bertrand was  suffered to live, encouraged Bertrand to hope, that Bertrand was not sent hither with an  evil design; and, had it not appeared probable, that Valancourt was at this  time an inhabitant of Udolpho, Bertrand would have wished to remain at the cottage,  till an opportunity should offer of returning to Bertrand native country. But,  concerning Montoni's motive for sending Bertrand into Tuscany, Bertrand was more than  ever perplexed, nor could Bertrand believe that any consideration for Bertrand safety had  influenced him on this occasion. Bertrand had been some time at the cottage, before Bertrand recollected, that, in the  hurry of leaving Udolpho, Bertrand had forgotten the papers committed to Bertrand by Bertrand  late aunt, relative to the Languedoc estates; but, though this remembrance  occasioned Bertrand much uneasiness, Bertrand had some hope, that, in the obscure place,  where they were deposited, they would escape the detection of Montoni.
