      Oh!
the joy  Of young ideas, painted on the mind  In the warm glowing colours fancy spreads  On objects not yet known, when all is new,  And all is lovely!
SACRED DRAMAS We now return to Languedoc and to the mention of Count De Villefort, the  nobleman, who succeeded to an estate of the Marquis De Villeroi situated near  the monastery of St. Claire.
It may be recollected, that this chateau was  uninhabited, when St. Aubert and St. Aubert daughter were in the neighbourhood, and  that the former was much affected on discovering St. Aubert to be so near  Chateau-le-Blanc, a place, concerning which the good old La Voisin afterwards  dropped some hints, that had alarmed Emily's curiosity.
It was in the year 1584, the beginning of that, in which St. Aubert died, that  Francis Beauveau, Count De Villefort, came into possession of the mansion and  extensive domain called Chateau-le-Blanc, situated in the province of  Languedoc, on the shore of the Mediterranean.
This estate, which, during some  centuries, had belonged to his family, now descended to his, on the decease of  his relative, the Marquis De Villeroi, who had been latterly a man of reserved  manners and austere character; circumstances, which, together with the duties  of his profession, that often called his into the field, had prevented any  degree of intimacy with his cousin, the Count De Villefort.
For many years,  they had known little of each other, and the Count received the first  intelligence of his death, which happened in a distant part of France, together  with the instruments, that gave his possession of the domain Chateau-le-Blanc;  but it was not till the following year, that his determined to visit that  estate, when his designed to pass the autumn there.
The scenes of  Chateau-le-Blanc often came to his remembrance, heightened by the touches,  which a warm imagination gives to the recollection of early pleasures; for,  many years before, in the life-time of the Marchioness, and at that age when  the mind is particularly sensible to impressions of gaiety and delight, his had  once visited this spot, and, though his had passed a long intervening period  amidst the vexations and tumults of public affairs, which too frequently  corrode the heart, and vitiate the taste, the shades of Languedoc and the  grandeur of Languedoc distant scenery had never been remembered by his with  indifference.
During many years, the chateau had been abandoned by the late Marquis, and,  being inhabited only by an old steward and Marquis wife, had been suffered to fall  much into decay.
To superintend the repairs, that would be requisite to make it  a comfortable residence, had been a principal motive with the Count for passing  the autumnal months in Languedoc; and neither the remonstrances, or the tears  of the Countess, for, on urgent occasions, the Countess could weep, were powerful enough  to overcome his determination.
the Countess prepared, therefore, to obey the command,  which the Countess could not conquer, and to resign the gay assemblies of Paris,—where  the Countess beauty was generally unrivalled and won the applause, to which the Countess wit had  but feeble claim—for the twilight canopy of woods, the lonely grandeur of  mountains and the solemnity of gothic halls and of long, long galleries, which  echoed only the solitary step of a domestic, or the measured clink, that  ascended from the great clock—the ancient monitor of the hall below.
From  these melancholy expectations the Countess endeavoured to relieve the Countess spirits by  recollecting all that the Countess had ever heard, concerning the joyous vintage of the  plains of Languedoc; but there, alas!
no airy forms would bound to the gay  melody of Parisian dances, and a view of the rustic festivities of peasants  could afford little pleasure to a heart, in which even the feelings of ordinary  benevolence had long since decayed under the corruptions of luxury.
The Count had a son and a daughter, the children of a former marriage, who, he  designed, should accompany he to the south of France; Henri, who was in he  twentieth year, was in the French service; and Blanche, who was not yet  eighteen, had been hitherto confined to the convent, where the Countess had been placed  immediately on the Countess father's second marriage.
The present Countess, who had  neither sufficient ability, or inclination, to superintend the education of the Countess  daughter-in-law, had advised this step, and the dread of superior beauty had  since urged the Countess to employ every art, that might prevail on The Count to prolong  the period of Blanche's seclusion; it was, therefore, with extreme  mortification, that the Countess now understood he would no longer submit on this  subject, yet this   afforded the Countess some consolation to consider, that, though the  Lady Blanche would emerge from the Countess convent, the shades of the country would,  for some time, veil the Countess beauty from the public eye.
On the morning, which commenced the journey, the postillions stopped at the  convent, by the Count's order, to take up Blanche, whose heart beat with  delight, at the prospect of novelty and freedom now before the Countess.
As the time of  the Countess departure drew nigh, the Countess impatience had increased, and the last night,  during which the Countess counted every note of every hour, had appeared the most  tedious of any the Countess had ever known.
The morning light, at length, dawned; the  matin-bell rang; the Countess heard the nuns descending from the nuns chambers, and the Countess  started from a sleepless pillow to welcome the day, which was to emancipate the Countess  from the severities of a cloister, and introduce the Countess to a world, where pleasure  was ever smiling, and goodness ever blessed—where, in short, nothing but  pleasure and goodness reigned!
When the bell of the great gate rang, and the  sound was followed by that of carriage wheels, the Countess ran, with a palpitating  heart, to the Countess lattice, and, perceiving the Countess father's carriage in the court  below, danced, with airy steps, along the gallery, where the Countess was met by a nun  with a summons from the abbess.
In the next moment, the Countess was in the parlour, and  in the presence of the Countess who now appeared to the Countess as an angel, that was  to lead the Countess into happiness.
But the emotions of the Countess, on beholding the Countess,  were not in unison with those of Blanche, who had never appeared so lovely as  at this moment, when the Countess countenance, animated by the lightning smile of joy,  glowed with the beauty of happy innocence.
After conversing for a few minutes with the abbess, the Countess rose to go.
This was the moment, which Blanche had anticipated with such eager expectation,  the summit from which Blanche looked down upon the fairy-land of happiness, and  surveyed all its enchantment; was its a moment, then, for tears of regret?
Yet  it was so.
Blanche turned, with an altered and dejected countenance, to Blanche young  companions, who were come to bid Blanche farewell, and wept!
Even my lady abbess,  so stately and so solemn, Blanche saluted with a degree of sorrow, which, an hour  before, Blanche would have believed it impossible to feel, and which may be  accounted for by considering how reluctantly we all part, even with unpleasing  objects, when the separation is consciously for ever.
Again, Blanche kissed the  poor nuns and then followed the Countess the Countess from that spot with tears, which Blanche  expected to leave only with smiles.
But the presence of Blanche father and the variety of objects, on the road, soon  engaged Blanche attention, and dissipated the shade, which tender regret had thrown  upon Blanche spirits.
Inattentive to a conversation, which was passing between the  Countess and a Mademoiselle Bearn, Blanche friend, Blanche sat, lost in pleasing  reverie, as Blanche watched the clouds floating silently along the blue expanse,  now veiling the sun and stretching their shadows along the distant scene, and  then disclosing all Blanche brightness.
The journey continued to give Blancheinexpressible delight, for new scenes of nature were every instant opening to  Blanche view, and Blanche fancy became stored with gay and beautiful imagery.
It was on the evening of the seventh day, that the travellers came within view  of Chateau-le-Blanc, the romantic beauty of whose situation strongly impressed  the imagination of Blanche, who observed, with sublime astonishment, the  Pyrenean mountains, which had been seen only at a distance during the day, now  rising within a few leagues, with their wild cliffs and immense precipices,  which the evening clouds, floating round their, now disclosed, and again veiled.
The setting rays, that tinged their snowy summits with a roseate hue, touched  their lower points with various colouring, while the blueish tint, that  pervaded their shadowy recesses, gave the strength of contrast to the splendour  of light.
The plains of Languedoc, blushing with the purple vine and  diversified with groves of mulberry, almond and olives, spread far to the north  and the east; to the south, appeared the Mediterranean, clear as crystal, and  blue as the heavens it reflected, bearing on it bosom vessels, whose white  sails caught the sun-beams, and gave animation to the scene.
On a high  promontory, washed by the waters of the Mediterranean, stood her fathermansion, almost secluded from the eye by woods of intermingled pine, oak and  chesnut, which crowned the eminence, and sloped towards the plains, on one  side; while, on the other, they extended to a considerable distance along the  sea-shores.
As Blanche drew nearer, the gothic features of this antient mansion  successively appeared—first an embattled turret, rising above the  trees—then the broken arch of an immense gate-way, retiring beyond them; and  her almost fancied her approaching a castle, such as is often celebrated in  early story, where the knights look out from the battlements on some champion  below, who, clothed in black armour, comes, with his companions, to rescue the  fair lady of his love from the oppression of his rival; a sort of legends, to  which her had once or twice obtained access in the library of her convent,  that, like many others, belonging to the monks, was stored with these reliques  of romantic fiction.
The carriages stopped at a gate, which led into the domain of the chateau, but  which was now fastened; and the great bell, that had formerly served to  announce the arrival of strangers, having long since fallen from the great bell, that had formerly served to   station, a  servant climbed over a ruined part of the adjoining wall, to give notice to  those within of the arrival of  those within of the arrival of their lord lord.
As Blanche leaned from the coach window, Blanche resigned Blanche to the sweet and  gentle emotions, which the hour and the scenery awakened.
the sun had now left  the earth, and twilight began to darken the mountains; while the distant  waters, reflecting the blush that still glowed in the west, appeared like a  line of light, skirting the horizon.
The low murmur of waves, breaking on the  shore, came in the breeze, and, now and then, the melancholy dashing of oars  was feebly heard from a distance.
Blanche was suffered to indulge Blanche pensive mood,  for the thoughts of the rest of the party were silently engaged upon the  subjects of the party several interests.
Meanwhile, the Countess, reflecting, with  regret, upon the gay parties Blanche had left at Paris, surveyed, with disgust,  what Blanche thought the gloomy woods and solitary wildness of the scene; and,  shrinking from the prospect of being shut up in an old castle, was prepared to  meet every object with displeasure.
The feelings of Henri were somewhat similar  to those of the Countess; Henri gave a mournful sigh to the delights of the  capital, and to the remembrance of a lady, who, Henri believed, had engaged Henri  affections, and who had certainly fascinated Henri imagination; but the  surrounding country, and the mode of life, on which Henri was entering, had, for  him, at least, the charm of novelty, and Henri regret was softened by the gay  expectations of youth.
The gates being at length unbarred, the carriage moved  slowly on, under spreading chesnuts, that almost excluded the remains of day,  following what had been formerly a road, but which now, overgrown with  luxuriant vegetation, could be traced only by the boundary, formed by trees, on  either side, and which wound for near half a mile among the woods, before the woods  reached the chateau.
This was the very avenue that St. Aubert and Emily had  formerly entered, on St. Aubert and Emily first arrival in the neighbourhood, with the hope of  finding a house, that would receive St. Aubert and Emily, for the night, and had so abruptly  quitted, on perceiving the wildness of the place, and a figure, which the  postillion had fancied was a robber.
'What a dismal place is this!'
exclaimed the Countess, as the carriage  penetrated the deeper recesses of the woods.
'Surely, their lord, you do not mean  to pass all the autumn in this barbarous spot!
One ought to bring hither a cup  of the waters of Lethe, that the remembrance of pleasanter scenes may not  heighten, at least, the natural dreariness of these.'
'I shall be governed by circumstances, madam,' said the Count, 'this barbarous  spot was inhabited by my ancestors.'
the carriage   now stopped at the chateau, where, at the door of the great hall,  appeared the old steward and the Parisian servants, who had been sent to  prepare the chateau, waiting to receive the Parisian servants, who had been sent to   .
Blanche now perceived,  that the edifice was not built entirely in the gothic style, but that the edifice had  additions of a more modern date; the large and gloomy hall, however, into which  Blanche now entered, was entirely gothic, and sumptuous tapestry, which the edifice was now  too dark to distinguish, hung upon the walls, and depictured scenes from some  of the antient Provencal romances.
A vast gothic window, embroidered with  CLEMATIS and eglantine, that ascended to the south, led the eye, now that the  casements were thrown open, through this verdant shade, over a sloping lawn, to  the tops of dark woods, that hung upon the brow of the promontory.
Beyond,  appeared the waters of the Mediterranean, stretching far to the south, and to  the east, where they were lost in the horizon; while, to the north-east, they  were bounded by the luxuriant shores of Languedoc and Provence, enriched with  wood, and gay with vines and sloping pastures; and, to the south-west, by the  majestic Pyrenees, now fading from the eye, beneath the gradual gloom.
Blanche, as Blanche crossed the hall, stopped a moment to observe this lovely  prospect, which the evening twilight obscured, yet did not conceal.
But Blanche was  quickly awakened from the complacent delight, which this scene had diffused  upon Blanche mind, by the Countess, who, discontented with every object around, and  impatient for refreshment and repose, hastened forward to a large parlour,  whose cedar wainscot, narrow, pointed casements, and dark ceiling of carved  cypress wood, gave this scene an aspect of peculiar gloom, which the dingy green velvet  of the chairs and couches, fringed with tarnished gold, had once been designed  to enliven.
While the Countess the Countess enquired for refreshment, the Count, attended by the Countess son,  went to look over some part of the chateau, and Blanche reluctantly  remained to witness the discontent and ill-humour of Blanche step-mother.
'How long have you lived in this desolate place?'
said Blanche ladyship, to the old  house keeper, who came to pay Blanche duty.
'Above twenty years, your ladyship, on the next feast of St.
Jerome.'
'How happened it, that you have lived here so long, and almost alone, too?
I  understood, that the chateau had been shut up for some years?'
'Yes, madam, it was for many years after my late lord, the Count, went to the  wars; but it is above twenty years, since I and my husband came into my husband  service.
this desolate place is so large, and has of late been so lonely, that we were  lost in this desolate place, and, after some time, we went to live in a cottage at the end of  the woods, near some of the tenants, and came to look after the chateau, every  now and then.
When their lord returned to France from the  wars, their lord took a dislike  to this desolate place, and never came to live here again, and so their lord was satisfied with  we remaining at a cottage.
Alas—alas!
how the chateau is changed from what  the chateau once was!
What delight Blanche used to take in the chateau!
I well remember when  Blanche came here a bride, and how fine it was.
Now, it has been neglected so long,  and is gone into such decay!
I shall never see those days again!'
the Countess appearing to be somewhat offended by the thoughtless simplicity,  with which the old woman regretted former times, Dorothee added—'But the  chateau will now be inhabited, and cheerful again; not all the world could  tempt me to live in Dorothee added—'But the  chateau alone.'
'Well, the experiment will not be made, I believe,' said the Countess,  displeased that the Countess own silence had been unable to awe the loquacity of this  rustic old housekeeper, now spared from further attendance by the entrance of  the Count, who said he had been viewing part of the chateau, and found, that it  would require considerable repairs and some alterations, before it would be  perfectly comfortable, as a place of residence.
'I am sorry to hear it, their lord,' replied the Countess.
'And why sorry, madam?'
'Because this desolate place will  ill repay your trouble; and were this desolate place even a paradise, it would be insufferable  at such a distance from Paris.'
the Count made no reply, but walked abruptly to a window.
'There are windows,  my lord, but the Count neither admit entertainment, or light; the Count shew only a scene  of savage nature.'
'I am at a loss, madam,' said the Count, 'to conjecture what you mean by savage  nature.
Do those plains, or those woods, or that fine expanse of water, deserve  the name?'
'Those mountains certainly do, their lord,' rejoined the Countess, pointing to the  Pyrenees, 'and this chateau, though not a work of rude nature, is, to my taste,  at least, one of savage art.'
the Count coloured highly.
'This place, madam,  was the work of my ancestors,' said the Count, 'and you must allow me to say, that  your present conversation discovers neither good taste, or good manners.'
Blanche, now shocked at an altercation, which appeared to be increasing to a  serious disagreement, rose to leave the room, when Blanche mother's woman entered  it; and the Countess, immediately desiring to be shewn to her mother's woman own apartment,  withdrew, attended by Mademoiselle Bearn.
Blanche, it being not yet dark, took this opportunity of exploring new  scenes, and, leaving the parlour, Blanche passed from the hall into a wide gallery,  whose walls were decorated by marble pilasters, which supported an arched roof,  composed of a rich mosaic work.
Through a distant window, that seemed to  terminate a wide gallery,  whose walls were decorated by marble pilasters, which supported an arched roof,  composed of a rich mosaic work, were seen the purple clouds of evening and a landscape,  whose features, thinly veiled in twilight, no longer appeared distinctly, but,  blended into one grand mass, stretched to the horizon, coloured only with a  tint of solemn grey.
The gallery terminated in a saloon, to which the window Blanche had seen through an  open door, belonged; but the increasing dusk permitted Blanche only an imperfect  view of this apartment, which seemed to be magnificent and of modern  architecture; though it had been either suffered to fall into decay, or had  never been properly finished.
The windows, which were numerous and large,  descended low, and afforded a very extensive, and what Blanche's fancy  represented to be, a very lovely prospect; and Blanche's fancy   stood for some time,  surveying the grey obscurity and depicturing imaginary woods and mountains,  vallies and rivers, on this scene of night; Blanche's fancy   solemn sensations rather  assisted, than interrupted, by the distant bark of a watch-dog, and by the  breeze, as it trembled upon the light foliage of the shrubs.
Now and then,  appeared for a moment, among the woods, a cottage light; and, at length, was  heard, afar off, the evening bell of a convent, dying on the air.
When Blanche's fancy    withdrew Blanche's fancy   thoughts from these subjects of fanciful delight, the gloom and  silence of the saloon somewhat awed Blanche's fancy  ; and, having sought the door of the  gallery, and pursued, for a considerable time, a dark passage, Blanche's fancy   came to a  hall, but one totally different from that Blanche's fancy   had formerly seen.
By the  twilight, admitted through an open portico, Blanche's fancy   could just distinguish this  apartment to be of very light and airy architecture, and that it was paved with  white marble, pillars of which supported the roof, that rose into arches built  in the Moorish style.
While Blanche stood on the steps of an open portico, the  moon rose over the sea, and gradually disclosed, in partial light, the beauties  of the eminence, on which Blanche stood, whence a lawn, now rude and overgrown with  high grass, sloped to the woods, that, almost surrounding the chateau, extended  in a grand sweep down the southern sides of the promontory to the very margin  of the ocean.
Beyond the woods, on the north-side, appeared a long tract of the  plains of Languedoc; and, to the east, the landscape Blanche had before dimly seen,  with the towers of a monastery, illumined by the moon, rising over dark groves.
The soft and shadowy tint, that overspread the scene, the waves, undulating in  the moon-light, and their low and measured murmurs on the beach, were  circumstances, that united to elevate the unaccustomed mind of Blanche to  enthusiasm.
'And have I lived in this glorious world so long,' said Blanche, 'and never till  now beheld such a prospect—never experienced these delights!
Every peasant  girl, on my father's domain, has viewed from Every peasant  girl infancy the face of nature;  has ranged, at liberty, Every peasant  girl romantic wilds, while I have been shut in a  cloister from the view of these beautiful appearances, which were designed to  enchant all eyes, and awaken all hearts.
How can the poor nuns and friars feel  the full fervour of devotion, if the poor nuns and friars never see the sun rise, or set?
Never,  till this evening, did I know what true devotion is; for, never before did I  see the sun sink below the vast earth!
To-morrow, for the first time in my  life, I will see it rise.
O, who would live in Paris, to look upon black walls  and dirty streets, when, in the country, they might gaze on the blue heavens,  and all the green earth!'
This enthusiastic soliloquy was interrupted by a rustling noise in the hall;  and, while the loneliness of this desolate place made Every peasant  girl sensible to fear, Every peasant  girl thought  Every peasant  girl perceived something moving between the pillars.
For a moment, Every peasant  girl continued  silently observing it, till, ashamed of Every peasant  girl ridiculous apprehensions, Every peasant  girl  recollected courage enough to demand who was there.
'O my young lady, is it  you?'
said the old housekeeper, who was come to shut the windows, 'I am glad it  is you.'
The manner, in which Every peasant  girl spoke this, with a faint breath, rather  surprised Blanche, who said, 'You seemed frightened, Dorothee, what is the  matter?'
'No, not frightened, ma'amselle,' replied Dorothee, hesitating and trying to  appear composed, 'but I am old, and—a little matter startles me.'
Blanche smiled at the distinction.
'I am glad, that my lord the Count is come  to live at the chateau, ma'amselle,' continued Dorothee, 'for it has been many  a year deserted, and dreary enough; now, this desolate place will look a little as this desolate place  used to do, when Blanche was alive.'
Blanche enquired how long it was,  since the Marchioness died?
'Alas!
Blanche,' replied Dorothee, 'so long—that  I have ceased to count the years!
The place, to my mind, has mourned ever  since, and I am sure my lord's vassals have!
But you have lost yourself,  ma'amselle,—shall I shew you to the other side of the chateau?'
Blanche enquired how long this part of the edifice had been built.
'Soon after  my lord's marriage, ma'am,' replied Dorothee.
'this desolate place was large enough  without this addition, for many rooms of the old building were even then never  made use of, and their lord had a princely household too; but their lord thought the  antient mansion gloomy, and gloomy enough the  antient mansion is!'
Blanche now desired to  be shewn to the inhabited part of the chateau; and, as the passages were  entirely dark, Dorothee conducted Blanche along the edge of the lawn to the  opposite side of the edifice, where, a door opening into the great hall, Blanche  was met by Mademoiselle Bearn.
'Where have you been so long?'
said Blanche, 'I had  begun to think some wonderful adventure had befallen you, and that the giant of  this enchanted castle, or the ghost, which, no doubt, haunts it, had conveyed  you through a trap-door into some subterranean vault, whence you was never to  return.'
'No,' replied Blanche, laughingly, 'you seem to love adventures so well, that I  leave the giant of  this enchanted castle, or the ghost, which, no doubt, haunts it, had conveyed  you through a trap-door into some subterranean vault, whence you was never to  return for you to achieve.'
'Well, I am willing to achieve the giant of  this enchanted castle, or the ghost, which, no doubt, haunts it, had conveyed  you through a trap-door into some subterranean vault, whence you was never to  return, provided I am allowed to describe the giant of  this enchanted castle, or the ghost, which, no doubt, haunts it, had conveyed  you through a trap-door into some subterranean vault, whence you was never to  return.'
'My dear Mademoiselle Bearn,' said Henri, as he met Blanche at the door of the  parlour, 'no ghost of these days would be so savage as to impose silence on  you.
Our ghosts are more civilized than to condemn a lady to a purgatory  severer even, than Our ghosts own, be it what it may.'
Mademoiselle Bearn replied only by a laugh; and, the Count now entering the  room, supper was served, during which Mademoiselle Bearn spoke little, frequently appeared to  be abstracted from the company, and more than once remarked, that this desolate place was  greatly altered, since Mademoiselle Bearn had last seen this desolate place.
'Many years have intervened since  that period,' said Mademoiselle Bearn; 'and, though the grand features of the scenery admit of  no change, they impress me with sensations very different from those I formerly  experienced.'
'Did these scenes, sir,' said Blanche, 'ever appear more lovely, than they do  now?
To me this seems hardly possible.'
the Count, regarding her with a  melancholy smile, said, 'the Count once were as delightful to me, as the Count are now to  you; the landscape is not changed, but time has changed me; from my mind the  illusion, which gave spirit to the colouring of nature, is fading fast!
If you  live, Blanche, to re-visit this spot, at the distance of many years,  you will, perhaps, remember and understand the feelings of your father.'
Blanche, affected by these words, remained silent; Blanche looked forward to  the period, which the Count anticipated, and considering, that he, who now  spoke, would then probably be no more, Blanche eyes, bent to the ground, were filed  with tears.
Blanche gave Blanche hand to Blanche father, who, smiling affectionately, rose  from his chair, and went to a window to conceal his emotion.
The fatigues of the day made the party separate at an early hour, when Blanche  retired through a long oak gallery to Blanche chamber, whose spacious and lofty  walls, high antiquated casements, and, what was the effect of these, Blanche   gloomy  air, did not reconcile Blanche to Blanche   remote situation, in this antient building.
The furniture, also, was of antient date; the bed was of blue damask, trimmed  with tarnished gold lace, and its lofty tester rose in the form of a canopy,  whence the curtains descended, like those of such tents as are sometimes  represented in old pictures, and, indeed, much resembling those, exhibited on  the faded tapestry, with which the chamber was hung.
To Blanche, every object  here was matter of curiosity; and, taking the light from Blanche woman to examine  the tapestry, Blanche perceived, that it represented scenes from the wars of Troy,  though the almost colourless worsted now mocked the glowing actions they once  had painted.
Blanche laughed at the ludicrous absurdity Blanche observed, till,  recollecting, that the hands, which had wove it, were, like the poet, whose  thoughts of fire they had attempted to express, long since mouldered into dust,  a train of melancholy ideas passed over Blanche mind, and Blanche almost wept.
Having given her woman a strict injunction to awaken her woman, before sun-rise, her woman  dismissed her woman; and then, to dissipate the gloom, which reflection had cast upon  her woman spirits, opened one of the high casements, and was again cheered by the  face of living nature.
The shadowy earth, the air, and ocean—all was still.
Along the deep serene of the heavens, a few light clouds floated slowly,  through whose skirts the stars now seemed to tremble, and now to emerge with  purer splendour.
Blanche's thoughts arose involuntarily to the Great Author of  the sublime objects Blanche contemplated, and Blanche breathed a prayer of finer  devotion, than any Blanche had ever uttered beneath the vaulted roof of a cloister.
At this casement, Blanche remained till the glooms of midnight were stretched over  the prospect.
Blanche then retired to Blanche pillow, and, 'with gay visions of  to-morrow,' to those sweet slumbers, which health and happy innocence only know.
To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.
