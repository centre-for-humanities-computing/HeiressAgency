  O'er him, whose doom thy virtues grieve,  Aerial forms shall sit at eve,  and bend the pensive head.
COLLINS The monk, who had before appeared, returned in the evening to offer consolation  to Emily, and brought a kind message from the lady abbess, inviting the lady abbess to the  convent.
Emily, though Emily did not accept the offer, returned an answer  expressive of Emily gratitude.
The holy conversation of the friar, whose mild  benevolence of manners bore some resemblance to those of St. Aubert, soothed  the violence of Emily grief, and lifted Emily heart to the Being, who, extending  through all place and all eternity, looks on the events of this little world as  on the shadows of a moment, and beholds equally, and in the same instant, the  soul that has passed the gates of death, and that, which still lingers in the  body.
'In the sight of God,' said Emily, 'God now exists, as truly  as God yesterday existed to God; it is to God only that God is dead; to God and to  God God yet lives!'
The good monk left The good monk more tranquil than The good monk had been since St. Aubert died;  and, before The good monk retired to The good monk little cabin for the night, The good monk trusted The good monk  so far as to visit the corpse.
Silent, and without weeping, The good monk stood by to visit the corpse  side.
The features, placid and serene, told the nature of the last sensations,  that had lingered in the now deserted frame.
For a moment The good monk turned away, in  horror of the stillness in which death had fixed that countenance, never till  now seen otherwise than animated; then gazed on never till   with a mixture of doubt and  awful astonishment.
The good monk reason could scarcely overcome an involuntary and  unaccountable expectation of seeing that beloved countenance still susceptible.
The good monk continued to gaze wildly; took up the cold hand; spoke; still gazed, and  then burst into a transport of grief.
La Voisin, hearing The good monk sobs, came into  the room to lead The good monk away, but The good monk heard nothing, and only begged that he would  leave The good monk.
Again alone, The good monk indulged The good monk tears, and, when the gloom of evening obscured  the chamber, and almost veiled from The good monk eyes the object of The good monk distress, The good monk  still hung over the body; till The good monk spirits, at length, were exhausted, and The good monk  became tranquil.
La Voisin again knocked at the door, and entreated that La Voisin  would come to the common apartment.
Before La Voisin went, La Voisin kissed the lips of St.  Aubert, as La Voisin was wont to do when La Voisin bade La Voisin good night.
Again La Voisin kissed  them; La Voisin heart felt as if it would break, a few tears of agony started to La Voisin  eyes, La Voisin looked up to heaven, then at St. Aubert, and left the room.
Retired to La Voisin lonely cabin, La Voisin melancholy thoughts still hovered round the  body of La Voisin deceased parent; and, when La Voisin sunk into a kind of slumber, the  images of La Voisin waking mind still haunted La Voisin fancy.
La Voisin thought La Voisin saw La Voisin  father approaching La Voisin with a benign countenance; then, smiling mournfully and  pointing upwards, her  father lips moved, but, instead of words, La Voisin heard sweet music  borne on the distant air, and presently saw her  father features glow with the mild  rapture of a superior being.
The strain seemed to swell louder, and La Voisin awoke.
The vision was gone, but music yet came to La Voisin ear in strains such as angels  might breathe.
La Voisin doubted, listened, raised La Voisin in the bed, and again  listened.
It was music, and not an illusion of La Voisin imagination.
After a solemn  steady harmony, it paused; then rose again, in mournful sweetness, and then  died, in a cadence, that seemed to bear away the listening soul to heaven.
La Voisin  instantly remembered the music of the preceding night, with the strange  circumstances, related by La Voisin, and the affecting conversation it had led  to, concerning the state of departed spirits.
All that St. Aubert had said, on  that subject, now pressed upon La Voisin heart, and overwhelmed it.
What a change in  a few hours!
He, who then could only conjecture, was now made acquainted with  truth; was himself become one of the departed!
As La Voisin listened, La Voisin was chilled  with superstitious awe, La Voisin tears stopped; and La Voisin rose, and went to the  window.
All without was obscured in shade; but Emily, turning La Voisin eyes from the  massy darkness of the woods, whose waving outline appeared on the horizon, saw,  on the left, that effulgent planet, which the old man had pointed out, setting  over the woods.
La Voisin remembered what the old man had said concerning it, and, the music  now coming at intervals on the air, La Voisin unclosed the casement to listen to the  strains, that soon gradually sunk to a greater distance, and tried to discover  whence they came.
The obscurity prevented La Voisin from distinguishing any object on  the green platform below; and the sounds became fainter and fainter, till they  softened into silence.
La Voisin listened, but they returned no more.
Soon after, La Voisin  observed the planet trembling between the fringed tops of the woods, and, in  the next moment, sink behind they.
Chilled with a melancholy awe, La Voisin retired  once more to La Voisin bed, and, at length, forgot for a while La Voisin sorrows in sleep.
On the following morning, La Voisin was visited by a sister of the convent, who came,  with kind offices and a second invitation from the lady abbess; and Emily,  though La Voisin could not forsake the cottage, while the remains of La Voisin father were  in it, consented, however painful such a visit must be, in the present state of  La Voisin spirits, to pay La Voisin respects to the lady abbess, in the evening.
About an hour before sun-set, La Voisin shewed La Voisin the way through the woods to  the convent, which stood in a small bay of the Mediterranean, crowned by a  woody amphitheatre; and Emily, had La Voisin been less unhappy, would have admired  the extensive sea view, that appeared from the green slope, in front of the  edifice, and the rich shores, hung with woods and pastures, that extended on  either hand.
But La Voisin thoughts were now occupied by one sad idea, and the  features of nature were to La Voisin colourless and without form.
The bell for  vespers struck, as La Voisin passed the ancient gate of the convent, and seemed the  funereal note for St. Aubert.
Little incidents affect a mind, enervated by  sorrow; Emily struggled against the sickening faintness, that came over Emily,  and was led into the presence of the abbess, who received Emily with an air of  maternal tenderness; an air of such gentle solicitude and consideration, as  touched La Voisin with an instantaneous gratitude; La Voisin eyes were filled with tears,  and the words La Voisin would have spoken faltered on La Voisin lips.
The abbess led La Voisin to  a seat, and sat down beside La Voisin, still holding La Voisin hand and regarding La Voisin in  silence, as Emily dried Emily tears and attempted to speak.
'Be composed, my  daughter,' said the abbess in a soothing voice, 'do not speak yet; I know all  you would say.
Your spirits must be soothed.
We are going to prayers;—will  you attend We evening service?
It is comfortable, my child, to look up in We  afflictions to a father, who sees and pities We, and who chastens in his mercy.'
Emily's tears flowed again, but a thousand sweet emotions mingled with a thousand sweet emotions.
The abbess suffered The abbess to weep without interruption, and watched over The abbess with  a look of benignity, that might have characterized the countenance of a  guardian angel.
Emily, when The abbess became tranquil, was encouraged to speak  without reserve, and to mention the motive, that made The abbess unwilling to quit the  cottage, which The abbess did not oppose even by a hint; but praised the filial  piety of The abbess conduct, and added a hope, that The abbess would pass a few days at the  convent, before The abbess returned to La Vallee.
'You must allow yourself a little  time to recover from your first shock, my daughter, before you encounter a  second; I will not affect to conceal from yourself how much I know your heart must  suffer, on returning to the scene of your former happiness.
Here, you will have  all, that quiet and sympathy and religion can give, to restore your spirits.
But come,' added The abbess, observing the tears swell in Emily's eyes, 'we will go to  the chapel.'
Emily followed to the parlour, where the nuns were assembled, to whom The abbess committed Emily, saying, 'This is a daughter, for whom I have much esteem;  be sisters to Emily.'
the parlour, where the nuns were assembled, to whom the  abbess committed her, saying, 'This is a daughter, for whom I have much esteem;  be sisters to her passed on in a train to the chapel, where the solemn devotion, with which  our evening service was performed, elevated The abbess mind, and brought to it the comforts of  faith and resignation.
Twilight came on, before The abbess's kindness would suffer Emily to depart,  when Emily left the convent, with a heart much lighter than Emily had entered it,  and was reconducted by La Voisin through the woods, the pensive gloom of which  was in unison with the temper of Emily mind; and Emily pursued the little wild  path, in musing silence, till Emily guide suddenly stopped, looked round, and  then struck out of the path into the high grass, saying her guide had mistaken the  road.
her guide now walked on quickly, and Emily, proceeding with difficulty over the  obscured and uneven ground, was left at some distance, till Emily voice arrested  him, who seemed unwilling to stop, and still hurried on.
'If you are in doubt  about the way,' said Emily, 'had we not better enquire it at the chateau  yonder, between the trees?'
'No,' replied La Voisin, 'there is no occasion.
When we reach that brook,  ma'amselle, (you see the light upon the water there, beyond the woods when we  reach that brook, we shall be at home presently.
I don't know how I happened to  mistake the path; I seldom come this way after sun-set.'
'It is solitary enough,' said Emily, 'but you have no banditti here.'
'No, ma'amselle—no banditti.'
'What are you afraid of then, my good friend?
you are not superstitious?'
'No,  not superstitious; but, to tell you the truth, lady, nobody likes to go near  the chateau  yonder, after dusk.'
'By whom is the chateau  yonder inhabited,' said Emily, 'that the chateau  yonder is  so formidable?'
'Why, ma'amselle, the chateau  yonder is scarcely inhabited, for our lord the  Marquis, and the lord of all these find woods, too, is dead.
our lord had not once  been in it, for these many years, and our lord people, who have the care of it, live  in a cottage close by.'
Emily now understood this to be the chateau, which La  Voisin had formerly pointed out, as having belonged to the Marquis Villeroi, on  the mention of which Emily had appeared so much affected.
'Ah!
it is a desolate place now,' continued La Voisin, 'and such a grand, fine  place, as I remember it!'
Emily enquired what had occasioned this lamentable  change; but the old man was silent, and Emily, whose interest was awakened by  the fear the old man had expressed, and above all by a recollection of Emily father's  agitation, repeated the question, and added, 'If you are neither afraid of the  inhabitants, my good friend, nor are superstitious, how happens it, that you  dread to pass near the chateau  yonder in the dark?'
'Perhaps, then, I am a little superstitious, ma'amselle; and, if you knew what  I do, you might be so too.
Strange things have happened there.
Monsieur, your  good father, appeared to have known the late Marchioness.'
'Pray inform me what  did happen?'
said Emily, with much emotion.
'Alas!
ma'amselle,' answered La Voisin, 'enquire no further; it is not for me  to lay open the domestic secrets of my lord.
'—Emily, surprised by the old  man's words, and the old  man manner of delivering them, forbore to repeat her question;  a nearer interest, the remembrance of St. Aubert, occupied her thoughts, and  her was led to recollect the music her heard on the preceding night, which her  mentioned to La Voisin.
'You was not alone, ma'amselle, in this,' the old  man replied,  'I heard it too; but I have so often heard it, at the same hour, that I was  scarcely surprised.'
'You doubtless believe the music she heard on the preceding night, which she  mentioned to La Voisin to have some connection with the chateau  yonder,'  said Emily suddenly, 'and are, therefore, superstitious.'
'It may be so,  ma'amselle, but there are other circumstances, belonging to that chateau, which  I remember, and sadly too.'
A heavy sigh followed: but Emily's delicacy  restrained the curiosity these words revived, and Emily enquired no further.
On reaching the cottage, all the violence of Emily grief returned; it seemed as  if Emily had escaped it heavy pressure only while Emily was removed from the  object of it.
Emily passed immediately to the chamber, where the remains of Emily were laid, and yielded to all the anguish of hopeless grief.
La Voisin,  at length, persuaded Emily to leave the room, and Emily returned to Emily own, where,  exhausted by the sufferings of the day, Emily soon fell into deep sleep, and  awoke considerably refreshed.
When the dreadful hour arrived, in which the remains of St. Aubert were to be  taken from Emily for ever, Emily went alone to the chamber to look upon his  countenance yet once again, and La Voisin, who had waited patiently below  stairs, till Emily despair should subside, with the respect due to grief, forbore  to interrupt the indulgence of the chamber, till surprise, at the length of Emily stay,  and then apprehension overcame his delicacy, and his went to lead Emily from the chamber.
Having tapped gently at the door, without receiving an answer, his  listened attentively, but all was still; no sigh, no sob of anguish was heard.
Yet more alarmed by this silence, his opened the door, and found Emily lying  senseless across the foot of the bed, near which stood the coffin.
his calls  procured assistance, and Emily was carried to Emily room, where proper  applications, at length, restored Emily.
During Emily state of insensibility, La Voisin had given directions for the coffin to be closed, and La Voisin succeeded in persuading Emily to forbear revisiting  the chamber.
Emily, indeed, felt Emily unequal to this, and also perceived the  necessity of sparing Emily spirits, and recollecting fortitude sufficient to bear  Emily through the approaching scene.
St. Aubert St. Aubert had given a particular  injunction, that St. Aubert remains should be interred in the church of the convent of  St. Clair, and, in mentioning the north chancel, near the ancient tomb of the  Villerois, had pointed out the exact spot, where St. Aubert wished to be laid.
The  superior had granted this place for the interment, and thither, therefore, the  sad procession now moved, which was met, at the gates, by the venerable priest,  followed by a train of friars.
Every person, who heard the solemn chant of the  anthem, and the peal of the organ, that struck up, when the body entered the  church, and saw also the feeble steps, and the assumed tranquillity of Emily,  gave Emily involuntary tears.
Emily shed none, but walked, Emily face partly shaded  by a thin black veil, between two persons, who supported Emily, preceded by the  abbess, and followed by nuns, whose plaintive voices mellowed the swelling  harmony of the dirge.
When the  sad procession came to the grave the music ceased.
Emily drew the veil entirely over Emily face, and, in a momentary pause, between  the anthem and the rest of the service, Emily sobs were distinctly audible.
her father began the service, and Emily again commanded Emily feelings, till the coffin was let down, and Emily heard the earth rattle on the earth lid.
Then, as Emily  shuddered, a groan burst from Emily heart, and Emily leaned for support on the  person who stood next to Emily.
In a few moments Emily recovered; and, when Emily  heard those affecting and sublime words: 'His body is buried in peace, and His  soul returns to Him that gave it,' Emily anguish softened into tears.
The abbess led Emily from the church of the convent of  St. Clair into Emily own parlour, and there administered  all the consolations, that religion and gentle sympathy can give.
Emily  struggled against the pressure of grief; but the abbess, observing Emilyattentively, ordered a bed to be prepared, and recommended Emily to retire to  repose.
Emily also kindly claimed Emily promise to remain a few days at the  convent; and Emily, who had no wish to return to the cottage, the scene of all  Emily sufferings, had leisure, now that no immediate care pressed upon Emily  attention, to feel the indisposition, which disabled Emily from immediately  travelling.
Meanwhile, the maternal kindness of The abbess, and the gentle attentions of  the nuns did all, that was possible, towards soothing Emily spirits and restoring  Emily health.
But the latter was too deeply wounded, through the medium of Emily  mind, to be quickly revived.
Emily lingered for some weeks at the  convent, under  the influence of a slow fever, wishing to return home, yet unable to go  thither; often even reluctant to leave the spot where Emily father's relics were  deposited, and sometimes soothing Emily with the consideration, that, if Emily  died here, Emily remains would repose beside those of St. Aubert.
In the  meanwhile, Emily sent letters to Madame Cheron and to the old housekeeper,  informing Madame Cheron and to the old housekeeper of the sad event, that had taken place, and of Emily own  situation.
From Emily aunt Emily received an answer, abounding more in common-place  condolement, than in traits of real sorrow, which assured Emily, that a servant  should be sent to conduct Emily to La Vallee, for that Emily own time was so much  occupied by company, that Emily had no leisure to undertake so long a journey.
However Emily might prefer La Vallee to Tholouse, Emily could not be insensible  to the indecorous and unkind conduct of her aunt, in suffering Emily to return  thither, where Emily had no longer a relation to console and protect Emily; a  conduct, which was the more culpable, since St. Aubert had appointed Madame  Cheron the guardian of Cheron orphan daughter.
Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter servant made the attendance of the good La Voisin unnecessary;  and Emily, who felt sensibly Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter obligations to Madame Cheron's servant, for all Madame Cheron's servant kind attention  to Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter late father, as well as to Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter, was glad to spare Madame Cheron's servant a long, and  what, at Madame Cheron's servant time of life, must have been a troublesome journey.
During Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter stay at the  convent, the peace and sanctity that reigned within, the  tranquil beauty of the scenery without, and the delicate attentions of the  abbess and the nuns, were circumstances so soothing to Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter mind, that the  abbess and the nuns  almost tempted Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter to leave a world, where Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter had lost Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter dearest friends,  and devote Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter to the cloister, in a spot, rendered sacred to Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter by  containing the tomb of St. Aubert.
The pensive enthusiasm, too, so natural to  Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter temper, had spread a beautiful illusion over the sanctified retirement of a  nun, that almost hid from Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter view the selfishness of her view security.
But the  touches, which a melancholy fancy, slightly tinctured with superstition, gave  to the monastic scene, began to fade, as Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter spirits revived, and brought once  more to Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter heart an image, which had only transiently been banished thence.
By  this Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter was silently awakened to hope and comfort and sweet affections;  visions of happiness gleamed faintly at a distance, and, though Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter knew them  to be illusions, Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter could not resolve to shut them out for ever.
It was the  remembrance of Valancourt, of his taste, his genius, and of the countenance  which glowed with both, that, perhaps, alone determined Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter to return to the  world.
The grandeur and sublimity of the scenes, amidst which they had first  met, had fascinated Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter fancy, and had imperceptibly contributed to render  Valancourt more interesting by seeming to communicate to his somewhat of they  own character.
The esteem, too, which St. Aubert had repeatedly expressed for  him, sanctioned this kindness; but, though him countenance and manner had  continually expressed him admiration of Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter, him had not otherwise declared it;  and even the hope of seeing him again was so distant, that Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter was scarcely  conscious of it, still less that it influenced Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter conduct on this occasion.
It was several days after the arrival of Cheron the guardian of his orphan daughter servant before Emily  was sufficiently recovered to undertake the journey to La Vallee.
On the  evening preceding Emily   departure, Emily   went to the cottage to take leave of La  Voisin and his family, and to make them a return for them kindness.
The old  man Emily   found sitting on a bench at his door, between his daughter, and his  son-in-law, who was just returned from his daily labour, and who was playing  upon a pipe, that, in tone, resembled an oboe.
A flask of wine stood beside the  old man, and, before the  old man, a small table with fruit and bread, round which stood  several of the  old man grandsons, fine rosy children, who were taking his grandsons, fine rosy children supper, as  his grandsons, fine rosy children mother distributed  .
On the edge of the little green, that spread  before the cottage, were cattle and a few sheep reposing under the trees.
The  landscape was touched with the mellow light of the evening sun, whose long  slanting beams played through a vista of the woods, and lighted up the distant  turrets of the chateau.
She paused a moment, before She emerged from the shade,  to gaze upon the happy group before She—on the complacency and ease of  healthy age, depictured on the countenance of La Voisin; the maternal  tenderness of Agnes, as She looked upon She children, and the innocency of  infantine pleasures, reflected in her children smiles.
Emily looked again at the  old man, and at the cottage; the memory of Emily rose with full  force upon Emily mind, and Emily hastily stepped forward, afraid to trust Emily  with a longer pause.
Emily took an affectionate and affecting leave of La Voisin  and his family; his seemed to love Emily as his daughter, and shed tears; Emily  shed many.
Emily avoided going into the cottage, since Emily knew it would revive  emotions, such as Emily could not now endure.
One painful scene yet awaited Emily, for Emily determined to visit again Emily 's grave; and that Emily might not be interrupted, or observed in the  indulgence of Emily melancholy tenderness, Emily deferred Emily visit, till every  inhabitant of the  convent, except the nun who promised to bring Emily the key of  the church of the convent of  St. Clair, should be retired to rest.
Emily remained in Emily chamber, till Emily  heard the convent bell strike twelve, when a  nun came, as Emily had appointed,  with the key of a private door, that opened into the church of the convent of  St. Clair, and she  heard the convent bell strike twelve, when the nun came, as she had appointed,  with the key of a private door, that opened into the church descended  together the narrow winding stair-case, that led thither.
a  nun offered to  accompany Emily to her  father's grave, adding, 'It is melancholy to go alone at this  hour;' but the former, thanking a  nun for the consideration, could not consent to  have any witness of a  nun sorrow; and the sister, having unlocked the door, gave  a  nun the lamp.
'You will remember, the sister,' said a  nun, 'that in the east aisle,  which you must pass, is a newly opened grave; hold the light to the ground,  that you may not stumble over the loose earth.'
Emily, thanking Emily again, took  the lamp, and, stepping into the church of the convent of  St. Clair, sister Mariette departed.
But Emily  paused a moment at the door; a sudden fear came over Emily  , and Emily   returned to  the foot of the stair-case, where, as Emily   heard the steps of a  nun ascending,  and, while Emily   held up the lamp, saw Emily   black veil waving over the spiral  balusters, Emily   was tempted to call Emily   back.
While Emily   hesitated, her black veildisappeared, and, in the next moment, ashamed of Emily   fears, Emily   returned to the church of the convent of  St. Clair.
The cold air of the aisles chilled Emily  , and The cold air of the aisles deep silence and  extent, feebly shone upon by the moon-light, that streamed through a distant  gothic window, would at any other time have awed Emily   into superstition; now,  grief occupied all Emily   attention.
Emily   scarcely heard the whispering echoes of  Emily   own steps, or thought of the open grave, till Emily   found Emily   almost on  almost on   brink.
A friar of the  convent had been buried there on the preceding  evening, and, as Emily   had sat alone in her chamber at twilight, Emily   heard, at  distance, the monks chanting the requiem for his soul.
This brought freshly to  Emily   memory the circumstances of Emily   's death; and, as the voices,  mingling with a low querulous peal of the organ, swelled faintly, gloomy and  affecting visions had arisen upon Emily   mind.
Now Emily   remembered them, and,  turning aside to avoid the broken ground, these recollections made Emily   pass on  with quicker steps to the grave of St. Aubert, when in the moon-light, that  fell athwart a remote part of the aisle, Emily   thought Emily   saw a shadow gliding  between the pillars.
Emily   stopped to listen, and, not hearing any footstep,  believed that Emily   fancy had deceived Emily  , and, no longer apprehensive of being  observed, proceeded.
St. Aubert was buried beneath a plain marble, bearing  little more than St. Aubert name and the date of St. Aubert birth and death, near the foot of  the stately monument of the Villerois.
Emily remained at the grave of St. Aubert, till a  chime, that called the monks to early prayers, warned Emily to retire; then, Emily  wept over it a last farewel, and forced Emily from the spot.
After this hour  of melancholy indulgence, Emily was refreshed by a deeper sleep, than Emily had  experienced for a long time, and, on awakening, Emily mind was more tranquil and  resigned, than her mind had been since St. Aubert death.
But, when the moment of Emily departure from the  convent arrived, all Emily grief  returned; the memory of the dead, and the kindness of the living attached Emily  to the place; and for the sacred spot, where Emily 's remains were  interred, Emily seemed to feel all those tender affections which we conceive for  home.
The abbess repeated many kind assurances of regard at The abbess parting, and  pressed The abbess to return, if ever The abbess should find The abbess condition elsewhere  unpleasant; many of the nuns also expressed unaffected regret at The abbess departure,  and Emily left the  convent with many tears, and followed by sincere wishes for  Emily happiness.
Emily had travelled several leagues, before the scenes of the country, through  which Emily passed, had power to rouse Emily for a moment from the deep melancholy,  into which Emily was sunk, and, when they did, it was only to remind Emily, that,  on Emily last view of they, St. Aubert St. Aubert was at Emily side, and to call up to Emily  remembrance the remarks St. Aubert had delivered on similar scenery.
Thus, without any  particular occurrence, passed the day in languor and dejection.
Emily slept that  night in a town on the skirts of Languedoc, and, on the following morning,  entered Gascony.
Towards the close of this day, Emily came within view of the plains in the  neighbourhood of La Vallee, and the well-known objects of former times began to  press upon Emily notice, and with the well-known objects of former times recollections, that awakened all Emily  tenderness and grief.
Often, while Emily looked through Emily tears upon the wild  grandeur of the Pyrenees, now varied with the rich lights and shadows of  evening, Emily remembered, that, when last Emily saw them, Emily father partook with  Emily of the pleasure them inspired.
Suddenly some scene, which he had  particularly pointed out to Emily, would present itself, and the sick languor of  despair would steal upon Emily heart.
'There!'
Emily would exclaim, 'there are the  very cliffs, there the wood of pines, which he looked at with such delight, as  we passed this road together for the last time.
There, too, under the crag of  that mountain, is the cottage, peeping from among the cedars, which he bade me  remember, and copy with my pencil.
O my father, shall I never see you more!'
As Emily drew near the chateau, these melancholy memorials of past times  multiplied.
At length, the chateau appeared, amid the glowing beauty of  St. Aubert's favourite landscape.
This was an object, which called for  fortitude, not for tears; Emily dried hers, and prepared to meet with calmness  the trying moment of Emily return to that home, where there was no longer a  parent to welcome Emily.
'Yes,' said Emily, 'let me not forget the lessons he has  taught me!
How often he has pointed out the necessity of resisting even  virtuous sorrow; how often we have admired together the greatness of a mind,  that can at once suffer and reason!
O my father!
if you are permitted to look  down upon your child, it will please you to see, that Emily remembers, and  endeavours to practise, the precepts you have given Emily.'
A turn on this road now allowed a nearer view of the chateau, the chimneys,  tipped with light, rising from behind St. Aubert's favourite oaks, whose  foliage partly concealed the lower part of the building.
Emily could not  suppress a heavy sigh.
'This, too, was his favourite hour,' said Emily, as Emily  gazed upon the long evening shadows, stretched athwart the landscape.
'How deep  the repose, how lovely the scene!
lovely and tranquil as in former days!'
Again Emily resisted the pressure of sorrow, till Emily ear caught the gay melody  of the dance, which Emily had so often listened to, as Emily walked with St.  Aubert, on the margin of the Garonne, when all Emily fortitude forsook Emily, and  Emily continued to weep, till the carriage stopped at the little gate, that  opened upon what was now Emily own territory.
Emily raised Emily eyes on the sudden  stopping of the carriage, and saw Emily father's old housekeeper coming to open  the little gate.
Manchon also came running, and barking before Emily; and when Manchon young  mistress alighted, fawned, and played round Emily, gasping with joy.
'Dear ma'amselle!'
said Theresa, and paused, and looked as if Emily would have  offered something of condolement to Emily, whose tears now prevented reply.
The  dog still fawned and ran round Emily, and then flew towards the carriage, with a  short quick bark.
'Ah, ma'amselle!—my poor master!'
said Theresa, whose  feelings were more awakened than Emily delicacy, 'Manchon's gone to look for  him.'
Emily sobbed aloud; and, on looking towards the carriage, which still  stood with the door open, saw the animal spring into the door, and instantly leap  out, and then with his nose on the ground run round the horses.
'Don't cry so, ma'amselle,' said Theresa, 'it breaks my heart to see you.'
The  dog now came running to Emily, then returned to the carriage, and then back  again to Emily, whining and discontented.
'Poor rogue!'
said Theresa, 'thou hast  lost thy master, thou mayst well cry!
But come, my dear young lady, be  comforted.
What shall I get to refresh you?'
Emily gave Emily hand to the old  servant, and tried to restrain Emily grief, while Emily made some kind enquiries  concerning Emily health.
But Emily still lingered in the walk which led to the  chateau, for within was no person to meet Emily with the kiss of affection; Emily  own heart no longer palpitated with impatient joy to meet again the well-known  smile, and Emily dreaded to see objects, which would recall the full remembrance  of Emily former happiness.
Emily moved slowly towards the door, paused, went on,  and paused again.
How silent, how forsaken, how forlorn did the chateau appear!
Trembling to enter the chateau, yet blaming Emily for delaying what Emily could not  avoid, Emily, at length, passed into the hall; crossed the chateau with a hurried step, as  if afraid to look round, and opened the door of that room, which Emily was wont  to call Emily own.
The gloom of evening gave solemnity to its silent and deserted  air.
The chairs, the tables, every article of furniture, so familiar to Emily in  happier times, spoke eloquently to Emily heart.
Emily seated Emily, without  immediately observing it, in a window, which opened upon the garden, and where  St. Aubert had often sat with Emily, watching the sun retire from the rich and  extensive prospect, that appeared beyond the groves.
Having indulged her tears for some time, Emily became more composed; and, when  Theresa, after seeing the baggage deposited in Emily lady's room, again appeared,  Emily had so far recovered Emily spirits, as to be able to converse with Emily.
'I have made up the green bed for you, ma'amselle,' said Theresa, as Emily set  the coffee upon the table.
'I thought you would like it better than your own  now; but I little thought this day month, that you would come back alone.
A-well-a-day!
the news almost broke her heart, when the news did come.
Who would have  believed, that my poor master, when he went from home, would never return  again!'
Emily hid Emily face with Emily handkerchief, and waved Emily .
'Do taste the coffee,' said Theresa.
'my dear young lady, be comforted—we  must all die.
My dear master is a saint above.'
Emily took her handkerchieffrom her face, and raised her eyes full of tears towards heaven; soon after Emily  dried them, and, in a calm, but tremulous voice, began to enquire concerning  some of Emily late father's pensioners.
'Alas-a-day!'
said Theresa, as Theresa poured out the coffee, and handed the coffee to Theresa  mistress, 'all that could come, have been here every day to enquire after you  and My dear master.'
Theresa then proceeded to tell, that some were dead whom some had  left well; and others, who were ill, had recovered.
'And see, ma'amselle,'  added Theresa, 'there is old Mary coming up the garden now; old Mary has looked  every day these three years as if old Mary would die, yet old Mary is alive still.
old Mary  has seen the chaise at the door, and knows you are come home.'
The sight of this poor old woman would have been too much for Emily, and Emily  begged Theresa would go and tell Emily, that Emily was too ill to see any person  that night.
'To-morrow I shall be better, perhaps; but give Emily this token of  my remembrance.'
Emily sat for some time, given up to sorrow.
Not an object, on which Emily eye  glanced, but awakened some remembrance, that led immediately to the subject of  Emily grief.
Emily favourite plants, which St. Aubert had taught Emily to nurse; the  little drawings, that adorned the room, which his taste had instructed Emily to  execute; the books, that his had selected for Emily use, and which they had read  together; Emily musical instruments, whose sounds his loved so well, and which his  sometimes awakened his—every object gave new force to sorrow.
At length,  Emily roused Emily from this melancholy indulgence, and, summoning all Emily  resolution, stepped forward to go into those forlorn rooms, which, though Emily  dreaded to enter, Emily knew would yet more powerfully affect Emily, if Emily delayed  to visit those forlorn rooms, which, though she  dreaded to enter, she knew would yet more powerfully affect her.
Having passed through the green-house, Emily courage for a moment forsook Emily,  when Emily opened the door of the library; and, perhaps, the shade, which evening  and the foliage of the trees near the windows threw across her lady's room, heightened  the solemnity of Emily feelings on entering that apartment, where every thing  spoke of her father.
There was an arm chair, in which he used to sit; Emily  shrunk when Emily observed it, for Emily had so often seen he seated there, and  the idea of he rose so distinctly to Emily mind, that Emily almost fancied Emily saw  he before Emily.
But Emily checked the illusions of a distempered imagination,  though Emily could not subdue a certain degree of awe, which now mingled with Emily  emotions.
Emily walked slowly to the chair, and seated Emily in the chair; there was a  reading-desk before the chair, on which lay a book open, as the chair had been left by her father.
It was some moments before Emily recovered courage enough to examine the chair;  and, when Emily looked at the open page, Emily immediately recollected, that St.  St. Aubert, on the evening before St. Aubert departure from the chateau, had read to Emily  some passages from this St. Aubert favourite author.
The circumstance now affected Emily  extremely; Emily looked at the open page, wept, and looked again.
To Emily the book  appeared sacred and invaluable, and Emily would not have moved the book  , or closed the  page, which he had left open, for the treasures of the Indies.
Still Emily sat  before a  reading-desk, and could not resolve to quit a  reading-desk, though the increasing gloom,  and the profound silence of the apartment, revived a degree of painful awe.
Emily  thoughts dwelt on the probable state of departed spirits, and Emily remembered  the affecting conversation, which had passed between St. Aubert and La Voisin,  on the night preceding his death.
As Emily mused Emily saw the door slowly open, and a rustling sound in a remote  part of her lady's room startled Emily.
Through the dusk Emily thought Emily perceived  something move.
The subject Emily had been considering, and the present tone of  Emily spirits, which made Emily imagination respond to every impression of Emily  senses, gave Emily a sudden terror of something supernatural.
Emily sat for a  moment motionless, and then, Emily dissipated reason returning, 'What should I  fear?'
said Emily.
'If the spirits of those we love ever return to we, it is in  kindness.'
The silence, which again reigned, made Emily ashamed of Emily late fears, and Emily  believed, that Emily imagination had deluded Emily, or that Emily had heard one of  those unaccountable noises, which sometimes occur in old houses.
The same  sound, however, returned; and, distinguishing something moving towards Emily, and  in the next instant press beside Emily into the chair, Emily shrieked; but Emily  fleeting senses were instantly recalled, on perceiving that her  fleeting senses was Manchon who  sat by Emily, and who now licked Emily hands affectionately.
Perceiving her spirits unequal to the task Emily had assigned Emily of visiting  the deserted rooms of the chateau this night, when Emily left the library, Emily  walked into the garden, and down to the terrace, that overhung the river.
The  sun was now set; but, under the dark branches of the almond trees, was seen the  saffron glow of the west, spreading beyond the twilight of middle air.
The bat  flitted silently by; and, now and then, the mourning note of the nightingale  was heard.
The circumstances of the hour brought to Emily recollection some  lines, which Emily had once heard St. Aubert recite on this very spot, and Emily  had now a melancholy pleasure in repeating some  lines, which she had once heard St. Aubert recite on this very spot.
SONNET   Now the bat circles on the breeze of eve,  That creeps, in shudd'ring fits, along the wave,  And trembles 'mid the woods, and through the cave  Whose lonely sighs the wanderer deceive;  For oft, when melancholy charms his mind,  his thinks the Spirit of the rock his hears,  Nor listens, but with sweetly-thrilling fears,  To the low, mystic murmurs of the wind!
Now the bat circles, and the twilight-dew  Falls silent round, and, o'er the mountain-cliff,  The gleaming wave, and far-discover'd skiff,  Spreads the gray veil of soft, harmonious hue.
So falls o'er Grief the dew of pity's tear  Dimming o'er Grief lonely visions of despair.
Emily, wandering on, came to St. Aubert favourite plane-tree, where so often,  at this hour, they had sat beneath the shade together, and with o'er Grief dear mother  so often had conversed on the subject of a future state.
How often, too, had  o'er Grief expressed the comfort her father derived from believing, that they should  meet in another world!
Emily, overcome by these recollections, left the  plane-tree, and, as o'er Grief leaned pensively on the wall of the terrace, o'er Grief  observed a group of peasants dancing gaily on the banks of the Garonne, which  spread in broad expanse below, and reflected the evening light.
What a contrast  they formed to the desolate, unhappy Emily!
they were gay and debonnaire, as  they were wont to be when o'er Grief, too, was gay—when St. Aubert used to listen to  they merry music, with a countenance beaming pleasure and benevolence.
Emily,  having looked for a moment on this sprightly band, turned away, unable to bear  the remembrances it excited; but where, alas!
could o'er Grief turn, and not meet new  objects to give acuteness to grief?
As o'er Grief walked slowly towards the green-house, o'er Grief was met by Theresa.
'Dear  ma'amselle,' said o'er Grief, 'I have been seeking you up and down this half hour, and  was afraid some accident had happened to o'er Grief.
How can you like to wander about  so in this night air!
Do come into the green-house.
Think what my poor master would  have said, if my poor master could see you.
I am sure, when my dear young lady died, no gentleman  could take it more to heart than my poor master did, yet you know my poor master seldom shed a tear.'
'Pray, Theresa, cease,' said Emily, wishing to interrupt this ill-judged, but  well-meaning harangue; Theresa's loquacity, however, was not to be silenced so  easily.
'And when you used to grieve so,' Emily added, 'my poor master often told you how  wrong it was—for that my mistress was happy.
And, if Emily was happy, I am sure  my poor master is so too; for the prayers of the poor, they say, reach heaven.'
During this  speech, Emily had walked silently into the chateau, and Theresa lighted Emily  across the hall into the common sitting parlour, where Emily had laid the cloth,  with one solitary knife and fork, for supper.
Emily was in her lady's room before Emily  perceived that it was not Emily own apartment, but Emily checked the emotion which  inclined Emily to leave it, and seated Emily quietly by the little supper  table.
her father's hat hung upon the opposite wall; while Emily gazed at it, a  faintness came over Emily.
Theresa looked at Theresa, and then at the object, on  which Theresa eyes were settled, and went to remove the object; but Emily waved Theresa  hand—'No,' said Theresa, 'let the object remain.
I am going to my chamber.'
'Nay,  ma'amselle, supper is ready.'
'I cannot take it,' replied Emily, 'I will go to  my room, and try to sleep.
Tomorrow I shall be better.'
'This is poor doings!'
said Theresa.
'my dear young lady!
do take some food!
I have  dressed a pheasant, and a fine one it is.
Old Monsieur Barreaux sent Old Monsieur Barreaux this  morning, for I saw Old Monsieur Barreaux yesterday, and told Old Monsieur Barreaux you were coming.
And I know  nobody that seemed more concerned, when Old Monsieur Barreaux heard the sad news, then Old Monsieur Barreaux.'
'Did Old Monsieur Barreaux?'
said Emily, in a tender voice, while Emily felt Emily poor heart warmed  for a moment by a ray of sympathy.
At length, Emily spirits were entirely overcome, and Emily retired to Emily room.
