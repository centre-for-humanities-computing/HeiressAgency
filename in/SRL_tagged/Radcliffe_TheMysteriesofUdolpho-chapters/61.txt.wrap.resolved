   Now my task is smoothly done,  I can fly, or I can run  Quickly to the green earth's end,  Where the bow'd welkin low doth bend,  And, from thence, can soar as soon  To the corners of the moon.      MILTON The marriages of the Lady Blanche and Emily St. Aubert were celebrated, on the  same day, and with the ancient baronial magnificence, at Chateau-le-Blanc. The  feasts were held in the great hall of the castle, which, on this occasion, was  hung with superb new tapestry, representing the exploits of Charlemagne and Charlemagne  twelve peers; here, were seen the Saracens, with the Saracens horrible visors,  advancing to battle; and there, were displayed the wild solemnities of  incantation, and the necromantic feats, exhibited by the magician JARL before  the Emperor. The sumptuous banners of the family of Villeroi, which had long  slept in dust, were once more unfurled, to wave over the gothic points of  painted casements; and music echoed, in many a lingering close, through every  winding gallery and colonnade of that vast edifice. As Annette looked down from the corridor upon the hall, whose arches and  windows were illuminated with brilliant festoons of lamps, and gazed on the  splendid dresses of the dancers, the costly liveries of the attendants, the  canopies of purple velvet and gold, and listened to the gay strains that  floated along the vaulted roof, Annette almost fancied Annette in an enchanted  palace, and declared, that Annette had not met with any place, which charmed Annette so  much, since Annette read the fairy tales; nay, that the fairies themselves, at  the fairies themselves nightly revels in this old hall, could display nothing finer; while old  Dorothee, as Annette surveyed the scene, sighed, and said, the castle looked as the castle  was wont to do in the time of Annette youth. After gracing the festivities of Chateau-le-Blanc, for some days, Valancourt  and Emily took leave of their kind friends, and returned to La Vallee, where  the faithful Theresa received their with unfeigned joy, and the pleasant shades  welcomed their with a thousand tender and affecting remembrances; and, while  their wandered together over the scenes, so long inhabited by the late Mons. and  Madame St. Aubert, and Emily pointed out, with pensive affection, Madame St. Aubert, and Emily  favourite haunts, Emily present happiness was heightened, by considering, that it  would have been worthy of Madame St. Aubert, and Emily approbation, could Madame St. Aubert, and Emily have witnessed it. Valancourt   led Emily to the plane-tree on the terrace, where Valancourt   had first  ventured to declare Valancourt   love, and where now the remembrance of the anxiety Valancourt    had then suffered, and the retrospect of all the dangers and misfortunes they  had each encountered, since last they sat together beneath Valancourt   broad branches,  exalted the sense of they present felicity, which, on this spot, sacred to the  memory of St. Aubert, they solemnly vowed to deserve, as far as possible, by  endeavouring to imitate Valancourt   benevolence,—by remembering, that superior  attainments of every sort bring with they duties of superior exertion,—and by  affording to they fellow-beings, together with that portion of ordinary  comforts, which prosperity always owes to misfortune, the example of lives  passed in happy thankfulness to GOD, and, therefore, in careful tenderness to  GOD creatures. Soon after their return to La Vallee, the brother of Valancourt came to  congratulate the brother of Valancourt on the brother of Valancourt marriage, and to pay the brother of Valancourt respects to Emily, with whom  the brother of Valancourt was so much pleased, as well as with the prospect of rational happiness,  which these nuptials offered to Valancourt, that the brother of Valancourt immediately resigned to the brother of Valancourt  a part of the rich domain, the whole of which, as the brother of Valancourt had no family, would of  course descend to the brother of Valancourt brother, on the brother of Valancourt decease. The estates, at Tholouse, were disposed of, and Emily purchased of Mons.  Quesnel the ancient domain of Emily late father, where, having given Annette a  marriage portion, Annette settled Annette as the housekeeper, and Ludovico as the  steward; but, since both Valancourt and Annette preferred the pleasant and  long-loved shades of La Vallee to the magnificence of Epourville, Valancourt and herself  continued to reside there, passing, however, a few months in the year at the  birth-place of St. Aubert, in tender respect to his memory. The legacy, which had been bequeathed to Emily by Signora Laurentini, Emily  begged Valancourt would allow Emily to resign to Mons. Bonnac; and Valancourt,  when Emily made the request, felt all the value of the compliment the request conveyed.  The castle of Udolpho, also, descended to the wife of Mons. Bonnac, who was the  nearest surviving relation of the house of that name, and thus affluence  restored his long-oppressed spirits to peace, and his family to comfort. O! how joyful it is to tell of happiness, such as that of Valancourt and Emily;  to relate, that, after suffering under the oppression of the vicious and the  disdain of the weak, they were, at length, restored to each other—to the  beloved landscapes of they native country,—to the securest felicity of this  life, that of aspiring to moral and labouring for intellectual improvement—to  the pleasures of enlightened society, and to the exercise of the benevolence,  which had always animated their hearts; while the bowers of La Vallee became,  once more, the retreat of goodness, wisdom and domestic blessedness! O! useful may it be to have shewn, that, though the vicious can sometimes pour  affliction upon the good, the vicious can sometimes pour  affliction upon the good power is transient and the vicious can sometimes pour  affliction upon the good punishment  certain; and that innocence, though oppressed by injustice, shall, supported by  patience, finally triumph over misfortune! And, if the weak hand, that has recorded this tale, has, by its scenes,  beguiled the mourner of one hour of sorrow, or, by its moral, taught him to  sustain its—the effort, however humble, has not been vain, nor is the writer  unrewarded.
