   But in these cases,  We still have judgment here; that We but teach  Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return  To plague the inventor:  thus even-handed justice  Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice  To our own lips.
MACBETH Some circumstances of an extraordinary nature now withdrew Emily from Emily own  sorrows, and excited emotions, which partook of both surprise and horror.
A few days followed that, on which Signora Laurentini died, Emily will was opened  at the monastery, in the presence of the superiors and Mons.
Bonnac, when it  was found, that one third of Emily personal property was bequeathed to the  nearest surviving relative of the late Marchioness de Villeroi, and that Emily  was the person.
With the secret of Emily's family the abbess had long been acquainted, and the abbess  was in observance of the earnest request of St. Aubert, who was known to the  friar, that attended him on him death-bed, that him daughter had remained in  ignorance of his daughter relationship to the Marchioness.
But some hints, which had  fallen from Signora Laurentini, during his daughter last interview with Emily, and a  confession of a very extraordinary nature, given in his daughter dying hours, had made  the abbess think the abbess necessary to converse with his daughter young friend, on the topic  his daughter had not before ventured to introduce; and it was for this purpose, that his daughter  had requested to see his daughter on the morning that followed his daughter interview with the  nun.
Emily's indisposition had then prevented the intended conversation; but  now, after the will had been examined, his daughter received a summons, which his daughter  immediately obeyed, and became informed of circumstances, that powerfully  affected his daughter.
As the narrative of the abbess was, however, deficient in many  particulars, of which the reader may wish to be informed, and the history of  the  nun is materially connected with the fate of the Marchioness de Villeroi,  we shall omit the conversation, that passed in the parlour of the convent, and  mingle with we relation a brief history of  LAURENTINI DI UDOLPHO, Who was the only child of his daughter parents, and heiress of the ancient house of  Udolpho, in the territory of Venice.
It was the first misfortune of his daughter life,  and that which led to all his daughter succeeding misery, that the friends, who ought to  have restrained his daughter strong passions, and mildly instructed his daughter in the art of  governing them, nurtured them by early indulgence.
But them cherished them own  failings in his daughter; for them conduct was not the result of rational kindness,  and, when them either indulged, or opposed the passions of them child, them  gratified them own.
Thus them indulged his daughter with weakness, and reprehended his daughter  with violence; his daughter spirit was exasperated by them vehemence, instead of being  corrected by them wisdom; and them oppositions became contest for victory, in  which the due tenderness of the parents, and the affectionate duties of the  child, were equally forgotten; but, as returning fondness disarmed the parentsresentment soonest, Laurentini was suffered to believe that Laurentini had conquered,  and Laurentini passions became stronger by every effort, that had been employed to  subdue the parents.
The death of Laurentini father and mother in the same year left Laurentini to Laurentini own  discretion, under the dangerous circumstances attendant on youth and beauty.
Laurentini was fond of company, delighted with admiration, yet disdainful of the  opinion of the world, when it happened to contradict Laurentini inclinations; had a  gay and brilliant wit, and was mistress of all the arts of fascination.
Laurentini  conduct was such as might have been expected, from the weakness of Her  principles and the strength of Laurentini passions.
Among Laurentini numerous admirers was the late Marquis de Villeroi, who, on his tour  through Italy, saw Laurentini at Venice, where Laurentini usually resided, and became  Laurentini passionate adorer.
Equally captivated by the figure and accomplishments of  the Marquis, who was at that period one of the most distinguished noblemen of  the French court, Laurentini had the art so effectually to conceal from his the  dangerous traits of Laurentini character and the blemishes of Laurentini late conduct, that  his solicited Laurentini hand in marriage.
Before the nuptials were concluded, Laurentini retired to the castle of Udolpho,  whither the Marquis followed, and, where Laurentini conduct, relaxing from the  propriety, which Laurentini had lately assumed, discovered to his the precipice, on  which his stood.
A minuter enquiry than his had before thought it necessary to  make, convinced his, that his had been deceived in her character, and her, whom  his had designed for his wife, afterwards became his mistress.
Having passed some weeks at Udolpho, his was called abruptly to France, whither  his returned with extreme reluctance, for his heart was still fascinated by the  arts of Laurentini, with whom, however, his had on various pretences delayed his  marriage; but, to reconcile his  marriage to this separation, his now gave repeated  promises of returning to conclude the nuptials, as soon as the affair, which  thus suddenly called his to France, should permit.
Soothed, in some degree, by these assurances, his  marriage suffered his to depart; and,  soon after, his  marriage relative, Montoni, arriving at Udolpho, renewed the addresses,  which his  marriage had before refused, and which his  marriage now again rejected.
Meanwhile, his  marriage  thoughts were constantly with the Marquis de Villeroi, for whom his  marriage suffered  all the delirium of Italian love, cherished by the solitude, to which his  marriage  confined his  marriage; for his  marriage had now lost all taste for the pleasures of society  and the gaiety of amusement.
his  marriage only indulgences were to sigh and weep over a  miniature of the Marquis; to visit the scenes, that had witnessed Her only indulgences were to sigh and weep over a  miniature of the Marquis; to visit the scenes  happiness, to pour forth his  marriage heart to his in writing, and to count the weeks,  the days, which must intervene before the period that his had mentioned as  probable for his return.
But this period passed without bringing his; and week  after week followed in heavy and almost intolerable expectation.
During this  interval, Laurentini's fancy, occupied incessantly by one idea, became  disordered; and, his  marriage whole heart being devoted to one object, life became  hateful to his  marriage, when his  marriage believed one object lost.
Several months passed, during which his  marriage heard nothing from the Marquis de  Villeroi, and his  marriage days were marked, at intervals, with the phrensy of passion  and the sullenness of despair.
his  marriage secluded his  marriage from all visitors, and,  sometimes, remained in his  marriage apartment, for weeks together, refusing to speak to  every person, except his  marriage favourite female attendant, writing scraps of letters,  reading, again and again, those his  marriage had received from the Marquis, weeping over  his picture, and speaking to his picture, for many hours, upbraiding, reproaching and  caressing his picture alternately.
At length, a report reached his  marriage, that the Marquis had married in France, and,  after suffering all the extremes of love, jealousy and indignation, his  marriage formed  the desperate resolution of going secretly to that country, and, if a reportproved true, of attempting a deep revenge.
To his  marriage favourite woman only her favourite woman  confided the plan of his  marriage journey, and his  marriage engaged his  marriage to partake of it.
Having  collected his  marriage jewels, which, descending to his  marriage from many branches of his  marriage  family, were of immense value, and all his  marriage cash, to a very large amount, all her cash, to a very large amount  were packed in a trunk, which was privately conveyed to a neighbouring town,  whither Laurentini, with this only servant, followed, and thence proceeded  secretly to Leghorn, where all her cash, to a very large amount embarked for France.
When, on his  marriage arrival in Languedoc, his  marriage found, that the Marquis de Villeroi had  been married, for some months, his  marriage despair almost deprived his  marriage of reason, and  his  marriage alternately projected and abandoned the horrible design of murdering the  Marquis, his wife and his  marriage.
At length his  marriage contrived to throw his  marriage in his  way, with an intention of reproaching his, for his conduct, and of stabbing  his  marriage in his presence; but, when his  marriage again saw his, who so long had been the  constant object of his  marriage thoughts and affections, resentment yielded to love; his  marriage  resolution failed; his  marriage trembled with the conflict of emotions, that assailed  his  marriage heart, and fainted away.
the Marquis was not proof against his  marriage beauty and sensibility; all the energy,  with which the Marquis had first loved, returned, for the Marquis passion had been resisted by  prudence, rather than overcome by indifference; and, since the honour of the Marquis  family would not permit the Marquis to marry his  marriage, the Marquis had endeavoured to subdue the Marquis  love, and had so far succeeded, as to select the then the Marchioness for the Marquis wife,  whom the Marquis loved at first with a tempered and rational affection.
But the mild  virtues of that amiable lady did not recompense the Marquis for that amiable lady indifference, which  appeared, notwithstanding that amiable lady efforts to conceal it; and the Marquis had, for some time,  suspected that that amiable lady affections were engaged by another person, when Laurentini  arrived in Languedoc.
This artful Italian soon perceived, that that amiable lady had regained  that amiable lady influence over the Marquis, and, soothed by the discovery, that amiable lady determined to live,  and to employ all that amiable lady enchantments to win the Marquis consent to the diabolical deed,  which that amiable lady believed was necessary to the security of that amiable lady happiness.
that amiable lady  conducted that amiable lady scheme with deep dissimulation and patient perseverance, and,  having completely estranged the affections of the Marquis from the Marquis wife, whose  gentle goodness and unimpassioned manners had ceased to please, when contrasted  with the captivations of the Italian, that amiable lady proceeded to awaken in the Marquis mind the  jealousy of pride, for it was no longer that of love, and even pointed out to  the Marquis the person, to whom that amiable lady affirmed the Marchioness had sacrificed that amiable lady honour;  but Laurentini had first extorted from the Marquis a solemn promise to forbear avenging  the Marquis upon the Marquis rival.
This was an important part of that amiable lady plan, for that amiable lady knew,  that, if the Marquis desire of vengeance was restrained towards one party, his desire of vengeance was restrained towards one party would  burn more fiercely towards the other, and the Marquis might then, perhaps, be prevailed  on to assist in the horrible act, which would release the Marquis from the only  barrier, that with-held the Marquis from making that amiable lady the Marquis wife.
The innocent Marchioness, meanwhile, observed, with extreme grief, the  alteration in that amiable lady husband's manners.
the Marquis became reserved and thoughtful in that amiable lady  presence; the Marquis conduct was austere, and sometimes even rude; and the Marquis left that amiable lady,  for many hours together, to weep for the Marquis unkindness, and to form plans for the  recovery of the Marquis affection.
his conduct afflicted that amiable lady the more, because, in  obedience to the command of that amiable lady father, that amiable lady had accepted the Marquis hand, though that amiable lady  affections were engaged to another, whose amiable disposition, that amiable lady had reason  to believe, would have ensured that amiable lady happiness.
This circumstance Laurentini had  discovered, soon after that amiable lady arrival in France, and had made ample use of it in  assisting that amiable lady designs upon the Marquis, to whom that amiable lady adduced such seeming proof  of the Marquis wife's infidelity, that, in the frantic rage of wounded honour, the Marquis  consented to destroy his wife.
A slow poison was administered, and his wife fell a  victim to the jealousy and subtlety of Laurentini and to the guilty weakness of  his wife husband.
But the moment of Laurentini's triumph, the moment, to which his wife had looked  forward for the completion of all his wife wishes, proved only the commencement of a  suffering, that never left his wife to his wife dying hour.
The passion of revenge, which had in part stimulated his wife to the commission of  this atrocious deed, died, even at the moment when it was gratified, and left  his wife to the horrors of unavailing pity and remorse, which would probably have  empoisoned all the years his wife had promised his wife with the Marquis de Villeroi,  had his wife expectations of an alliance with him been realized.
But him, too, had  found the moment of him revenge to be that of remorse, as to him, and  detestation, as to the partner of him crime; the feeling, which him had mistaken  for conviction, was no more; and him stood astonished, and aghast, that no proof  remained of him wife's infidelity, now that his wife had suffered the punishment of  guilt.
Even when him was informed, that his wife was dying, him had felt suddenly and  unaccountably reassured of his wife innocence, nor was the solemn assurance his wife made  him in his wife last hour, capable of affording him a stronger conviction of his wife  blameless conduct.
In the first horrors of remorse and despair, him felt inclined to deliver up  him and the woman, who had plunged him into this abyss of guilt, into the  hands of justice; but, when the paroxysm of him suffering was over, him  intention changed.
Laurentini, however, Laurentini saw only once afterwards, and that  was, to curse Laurentini as the instigator of Laurentini crime, and to say, that Laurentini spared  Laurentini life only on condition, that Laurentini passed the rest of Laurentini days in prayer and  penance.
Overwhelmed with disappointment, on receiving contempt and abhorrence  from the man, for whose sake Laurentini had not scrupled to stain Laurentini conscience with  human blood, and, touched with horror of the unavailing crime Laurentini had  committed, Laurentini renounced the world, and retired to the monastery of St. Claire,  a dreadful victim to unresisted passion.
the Marquis, immediately after the death of the Marquis wife, quitted Chateau-le-Blanc,  to which the Marquis never returned, and endeavoured to lose the sense of the Marquis crime  amidst the tumult of war, or the dissipations of a capital; but the Marquis efforts  were vain; a deep dejection hung over the Marquis ever after, for which the Marquis most  intimate friend could not account, and the Marquis, at length, died, with a degree of  horror nearly equal to that, which Laurentini had suffered.
The physician, who  had observed the singular appearance of the unfortunate Marchioness, after  death, had been bribed to silence; and, as the surmises of a few of the  servants had proceeded no further than a whisper, the affair had never been  investigated.
Whether a whisper ever reached the father of the Marchioness,  and, if a whisper did, whether the difficulty of obtaining proof deterred the Marquis from  prosecuting the Marquis de Villeroi, is uncertain; but  death was deeply  lamented by some part of her family, and particularly by her brother, M. St.  Aubert; for that was the degree of relationship, which had existed between  Emily's father and the Marchioness; and there is no doubt, that the Marquis suspected  the manner of her .
Many letters passed between the Marquis and him, soon  after the decease of him beloved sister, the subject of which was not known,  but there is reason to believe, that Many letters related to the cause of her ;  and these were the papers, together with some letters of the Marchioness, who  had confided to her brother the occasion of her unhappiness, which St. Aubert  had so solemnly enjoined St. Aubert   daughter to destroy: and anxiety for his daughter peace had  probably made St. Aubert   forbid his daughter to enquire into the melancholy story, to which  together with some letters of the Marchioness, who  had confided to her brother the occasion of her unhappiness, which St. Aubert  had so solemnly enjoined his daughter to destroy: and anxiety for her peace alluded.
Such, indeed, had been St. Aubert   affliction, on the premature death of  this St. Aubert   favourite sister, whose unhappy marriage had from the first excited  St. Aubert   tenderest pity, that St. Aubert   never could hear his daughter named, or mention his daughter himself  after his daughter , except to St. Aubert  .
From Emily, whose sensibility St. Aubert    feared to awaken, St. Aubert   had so carefully concealed his daughter history and name, that his daughter  was ignorant, till now, that his daughter ever had such a relative as the Marchioness de  Villeroi; and from this motive St. Aubert   had enjoined silence to St. Aubert   only surviving  sister, Madame Cheron, who had scrupulously observed St. Aubert   request.
It was over some of the last pathetic letters of the Marchioness, that St.  St. Aubert   was weeping, when St. Aubert   was observed by Emily, on the eve of Emily departure  from La Vallee, and it was Emily picture, which St. Aubert   had so tenderly caressed.
Emily may account for the emotion St. Aubert   had betrayed, on hearing Emily  named by La Voisin, and for St. Aubert   request to be interred near the monument of the  Villerois, where Emily remains were deposited, but not those of Emily husband, who  was buried, where St. Aubert   died, in the north of France.
The confessor, who attended St. Aubert in St. Aubert   last moments, recollected St. Aubert   to  be the brother of the late Marchioness, when St. Aubert, from tenderness to  Emily, had conjured St. Aubert   to conceal the circumstance, and to request that the  abbess, to whose care St. Aubert   particularly recommended Emily, would do the same; a  request, which had been exactly observed.
Laurentini, on her arrival in France, had carefully concealed Laurentini name and  family, and, the better to disguise Laurentini real history, had, on entering the  convent, caused the story to be circulated, which had imposed on sister  Frances, and it is probable, that the abbess, who did not preside in the  convent, at the time of Laurentini noviciation, was also entirely ignorant of the  truth.
The deep remorse, that seized on the mind of Laurentini, together with  the sufferings of disappointed passion, for Laurentini still loved the Marquis, again  unsettled Laurentini intellects, and, after the first paroxysms of despair were  passed, a heavy and silent melancholy had settled upon Laurentini spirits, which  suffered few interruptions from fits of phrensy, till the time of  death.
During many years, it had been Laurentini only amusement to walk in the woods near the  monastery, in the solitary hours of night, and to play upon a favourite  instrument, to which Laurentini sometimes joined the delightful melody of Laurentini voice,  in the most solemn and melancholy airs of Laurentini native country, modulated by all  the energetic feeling, that dwelt in Laurentini heart.
The physician, who had attended  Laurentini, recommended it to the superior to indulge Laurentini in this whim, as the only  means of soothing Laurentini distempered fancy; and Laurentini was suffered to walk in the  lonely hours of night, attended by the servant, who had accompanied Laurentini from  Italy; but, as the indulgence transgressed against the rules of the convent, it  was kept as secret as possible; and thus the mysterious music of Laurentini had  combined with other circumstances, to produce a report, that not only the  chateau, but it neighbourhood, was haunted.
Soon after Laurentini entrance into this holy community, and before Laurentini had shewn any  symptoms of insanity there, Laurentini made a will, in which, after bequeathing a  considerable legacy to the convent, Laurentini divided the remainder of Laurentini personal  property, which Laurentini jewels made very valuable, between the wife of Mons.
Bonnac, who was an Italian lady and Laurentini relation, and the nearest surviving  relative of the late Marchioness de Villeroi.
As St. Aubert   was not only  the nearest, but the sole relative, this legacy descended to St. Aubert  , and thus  explained to St. Aubert   the whole mystery of St. Aubert   father's conduct.
The resemblance between Emily and Emily unfortunate aunt had frequently been  observed by Laurentini, and had occasioned the singular behaviour, which had  formerly alarmed Emily; but it was in the nun's dying hour, when Emily conscience  gave Emily perpetually the idea of the Marchioness, that Emily became more  sensible, than ever, of this likeness, and, in Emily phrensy, deemed this likeness no  resemblance of the person Emily had injured, but the original Emily.
The bold  assertion, that had followed, on the recovery of Emily senses, that Emily was the  daughter of the Marchioness de Villeroi, arose from a suspicion that Emily was  so; for, knowing that Emily rival, when Emily married the Marquis, was attached to  another lover, Emily had scarcely scrupled to believe, that Emily honour had been  sacrificed, like Emily own, to an unresisted passion.
Of a crime, however, to which Emily had suspected, from Emily phrensied  confession of murder, that Emily had been instrumental in the castle of Udolpho,  Laurentini was innocent; and Laurentini had Laurentini been deceived, concerning the  spectacle, that formerly occasioned Laurentini so much terror, and had since compelled  Laurentini, for a while, to attribute the horrors of the nun to a consciousness of a  murder, committed in that castle.
It may be remembered, that, in a chamber of Udolpho, hung a black veil, whose  singular situation had excited Emily's curiosity, and which afterwards  disclosed an object, that had overwhelmed Laurentini with horror; for, on lifting it,  there appeared, instead of the picture Laurentini had expected, within a recess of the  wall, a human figure of ghastly paleness, stretched at its length, and dressed  in the habiliments of the grave.
What added to the horror of the spectacle,  was, that the face appeared partly decayed and disfigured by worms, which were  visible on the features and hands.
On such an object, it will be readily  believed, that no person could endure to look twice.
Emily, it may be  recollected, had, after the first glance, let a black veil, whose  singular situation had excited Emily's curiosity, and which afterwards  disclosed an object, that had overwhelmed her with horror; for, on lifting it,  there appeared, instead of the picture she had expected, within a recess of the  wall, a human figure of ghastly paleness, stretched at its length, and dressed  in the habiliments of the grave drop, and Emily terror had  prevented Emily from ever after provoking a renewal of such suffering, as Emily had  then experienced.
Had Emily dared to look again, Emily delusion and Emily fears would  have vanished together, and Emily would have perceived, that the figure before  Emily was not human, but formed of wax.
The history of it is somewhat  extraordinary, though not without example in the records of that fierce  severity, which monkish superstition has sometimes inflicted on mankind.
A  member of the house of Udolpho, having committed some offence against the  prerogative of the church, had been condemned to the penance of contemplating,  during certain hours of the day, a waxen image, made to resemble a human body  in the state, to which a human body   is reduced after death.
This penance, serving as a  memento of the condition at which he must he arrive, had been designed to  reprove the pride of the Marquis of Udolpho, which had formerly so much  exasperated that of the church; and he had not only superstitiously  observed this penance he, which, he had believed, was to obtain a pardon  for all he sins, but had made a pardon   a condition in he will, that he descendants  should preserve the image, on pain of forfeiting to the church a certain part  of he domain, that his descendants   also might profit by the humiliating moral it  conveyed.
The figure, therefore, had been suffered to retain The figure station in the  wall of the chamber, but The figure excused his descendants   from observing the  penance, to which The figure had been enjoined.
This image was so horribly natural, that This image is not surprising Emily should have  mistaken This image for the object This image resembled, nor, since Emily had heard such an  extraordinary account, concerning the disappearing of the late lady of the  castle, and had such experience of the character of Montoni, that Emily should  have believed this to be the murdered body of the lady Laurentini, and that he  had been the contriver of Emily .
The situation, in which Emily had discovered it, occasioned Emily, at first, much  surprise and perplexity; but the vigilance, with which the doors of the  chamber, where it was deposited, were afterwards secured, had compelled Emily to  believe, that Montoni, not daring to confide the secret of Emily to any  person, had suffered Emily remains to decay in the chamber.
The ceremony  of the veil, however, and the circumstance of the doors having been left open,  even for a moment, had occasioned Emily much wonder and some doubts; but these  were not sufficient to overcome Emily suspicion of Montoni; and it was the dread  of his terrible vengeance, that had sealed Emily lips in silence, concerning what  Emily had seen in the chamber.
Emily, in discovering the Marchioness de Villeroi to have been the sister of  Mons.
St. Aubert, was variously affected; but, amidst the sorrow, which St. Aubert  suffered for St. Aubert , St. Aubert was released from an anxious and painful  conjecture, occasioned by the rash assertion of Signora Laurentini, concerning  St. Aubert birth and the honour of St. Aubert parents.
St. Aubert faith in St. Aubert principles  would scarcely allow St. Aubert to suspect that he had acted dishonourably; and St. Aubert  felt such reluctance to believe St. Aubert the daughter of any other, than St. Aubert,  whom St. Aubert had always considered and loved as a mother, that St. Aubert would hardly  admit such a circumstance to be possible; yet the likeness, which it had  frequently been affirmed St. Aubert bore to the late Marchioness, the former behaviour  of Dorothee the old housekeeper, the assertion of Laurentini, and the  mysterious attachment, which St. Aubert had discovered, awakened doubts, as to  St. Aubert connection with the Marchioness, which St. Aubert reason could neither vanquish,  or confirm.
From these, however, St. Aubert was now relieved, and all the  circumstances of her father's conduct were fully explained: but St. Aubert heart was  oppressed by the melancholy catastrophe of St. Aubert amiable relative, and by the  awful lesson, which the history of the nun exhibited, the indulgence of whose  passions had been the means of leading St. Aubert gradually to the commission of a  crime, from the prophecy of which in St. Aubert early years St. Aubert would have recoiled in  horror, and exclaimed—that it could not be!—a crime, which whole years of  repentance and of the severest penance had not been able to obliterate from St. Aubert  conscience.
