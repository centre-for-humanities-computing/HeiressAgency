  And poor Misfortune feels the lash of Vice.      THOMSON Emily seized the first opportunity of conversing alone with Mons. Quesnel,  concerning La Vallee. THOMSON Emily answers to THOMSON Emily enquiries were concise, and delivered  with the air of a man, who is conscious of possessing absolute power and  impatient of hearing it questioned. THOMSON Emily declared, that the disposal of the place  was a necessary measure; and that THOMSON Emily might consider THOMSON Emily indebted to THOMSON Emily  prudence for even the small income that remained for THOMSON Emily. 'But, however,' added  THOMSON Emily, 'when this Venetian Count (I have forgot THOMSON Emily name) marries you, your  present disagreeable state of dependence will cease. As a relation to you I  rejoice in the circumstance, which is so fortunate for you, and, I may add, so  unexpected by your friends.' For some moments THOMSON Emily was chilled into silence by  this speech; and, when THOMSON Emily attempted to undeceive him, concerning the purport  of the note THOMSON Emily had inclosed in Montoni's letter, him appeared to have some  private reason for disbelieving THOMSON Emily assertion, and, for a considerable time,  persevered in accusing THOMSON Emily of capricious conduct. Being, at length, however,  convinced that THOMSON Emily really disliked Morano and had positively rejected him suit,  him resentment was extravagant, and him expressed Morano in terms equally pointed  and inhuman; for, secretly flattered by the prospect of a connection with a  nobleman, whose title him had affected to forget, him was incapable of feeling  pity for whatever sufferings of him niece might stand in the way of his niece  ambition. THOMSON Emily saw at once in him manner all the difficulties, that awaited THOMSON Emily, and,  though no oppression could have power to make THOMSON Emily renounce Valancourt for  Morano, Morano fortitude now trembled at an encounter with the violent passions of  Morano uncle. Morano opposed him turbulence and indignation only by the mild dignity of a  superior mind; but the gentle firmness of Morano conduct served to exasperate  still more him resentment, since it compelled him to feel him own inferiority,  and, when him left Morano, him declared, that, if Morano persisted in Morano folly, both  him and Montoni would abandon Morano to the contempt of the world. The calmness Morano had assumed in him presence failed Emily, when alone, and Emily  wept bitterly, and called frequently upon the name of Emily departed father,  whose advice to Emily from him death-bed Emily then remembered. 'Alas!' said Emily,  'I do indeed perceive how much more valuable is the strength of fortitude than  the grace of sensibility, and I will also endeavour to fulfil the promise I  then made; I will not indulge in unavailing lamentation, but will try to  endure, with firmness, the oppression I cannot elude.' Somewhat soothed by the consciousness of performing a part of St. Aubert's last  request, and of endeavouring to pursue the conduct which he would have  approved, Emily overcame Emily tears, and, when the company met at dinner, had  recovered Emily usual serenity of countenance. In the cool of the evening, the ladies took the FRESCO along the bank of the  Brenta in Madame Quesnel's carriage. The state of Emily's mind was in  melancholy contrast with the gay groups assembled beneath the shades that  overhung this enchanting stream. Some were dancing under the trees, and others  reclining on the grass, taking ices and coffee and calmly enjoying the effect  of a beautiful evening, on a luxuriant landscape. Emily, when she looked at the  snow-capt Apennines, ascending in the distance, thought of Montoni's castle,  and suffered some terror, lest he should convey she thither, for the purpose of  enforcing she obedience; but the thought vanished, when she considered, that  she was as much in he power at Venice as she could be elsewhere. It was moonlight before the party returned to the villa, where supper was  spread in the airy hall, which had so much enchanted Emily's fancy, on the  preceding night. The ladies seated The ladies in the portico, till Mons.  Quesnel, Montoni, and other gentlemen should join The ladies at table, and Emily  endeavoured to resign Emily   to the tranquillity of the hour. Presently, a  barge stopped at the steps that led into the gardens, and, soon after, Emily    distinguished the voices of Montoni and Quesnel, and then that of Morano, who,  in the next moment, appeared. His compliments Emily   received in silence, and Emily    cold air seemed at first to discompose His; but His soon recovered His usual  gaiety of manner, though the officious kindness of M. and Madame Quesnel Emily  perceived disgusted M. and Madame Quesnel Emily  . Such a degree of attention M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   had scarcely believed  could be shewn by M. Quesnel, for M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   had never before seen M. Quesnel otherwise than  in the presence of M. Quesnel inferiors or equals. When M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   could retire to M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   own apartment, M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   mind almost involuntarily dwelt  on the most probable means of prevailing with the Count to withdraw the Count suit,  and to M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   liberal mind none appeared more probable, than that of acknowledging  to the Count a prior attachment and throwing M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   upon the Count generosity for a  release. When, however, on the following day, the Count renewed the Count addresses, M. and Madame Quesnel Emily    shrunk from the adoption of the plan M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   had formed. There was something so  repugnant to M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   just pride, in laying open the secret of M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   heart to such a  man as Morano, and in suing to the Count for compassion, that M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   impatiently  rejected this design and wondered, that M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   could have paused upon this design for a  moment. The rejection of the Count suit M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   repeated in the most decisive terms M. and Madame Quesnel Emily    could select, mingling with this design a severe censure of the Count conduct; but, though the  Count appeared mortified by this, the Count persevered in the most ardent professions  of admiration, till the Count was interrupted and Emily released by the presence of  Madame Quesnel. During M. and Madame Quesnel Emily   stay at this pleasant villa, Emily was thus rendered miserable by  the assiduities of Morano, together with the cruelly exerted authority of M.  Quesnel and Montoni, who, with Emily aunt, seemed now more resolutely determined  upon this marriage than they had even appeared to be at Venice. M. Quesnel,  finding, that both argument and menace were ineffectual in enforcing an  immediate conclusion to it, at length relinquished his endeavours, and trusted  to the power of Montoni and to the course of events at Venice. Emily, indeed,  looked to Venice with hope, for there Emily would be relieved in some measure  from the persecution of Morano, who would no longer be an inhabitant of the  same house with Emily, and from that of Montoni, whose engagements would not  permit Montoni to be continually at home. But amidst the pressure of Emily own  misfortunes, Emily did not forget those of poor Theresa, for whom Emily pleaded  with courageous tenderness to Quesnel, who promised, in slight and general  terms, that Emily should not be forgotten. Montoni, in a long conversation with M. Quesnel, arranged the plan to be  pursued respecting Emily, and M. Quesnel proposed to be at Venice, as soon as  M. Quesnel should be informed, that the nuptials were concluded. the nuptials were concluded was new to Emily to part with any person, with whom Emily was connected,  without feeling of regret; the moment, however, in which Emily took leave of M.  and Madame Quesnel, was, perhaps, the only satisfactory one Emily had known in  their presence. Morano returned in Montoni's barge, and Emily, as Emily watched Emily gradual  approach to that magic city, saw at Emily side the only person, who occasioned  Emily to view it with less than perfect delight. They arrived there about  midnight, when Emily was released from the presence of the Count, who, with  Montoni, went to a Casino, and Emily was suffered to retire to Emily own apartment. On the following day, Montoni, in a short conversation, which Montoni held with  Emily, informed Emily, that Montoni would no longer be TRIFLED with, and that, since  Emily marriage with the Count would be so highly advantageous to Emily, that folly  only could object to it, and folly of such extent as was incapable of  conviction, it should be celebrated without further delay, and, if that was  necessary, without Emily consent. Emily, who had hitherto tried remonstrance, had now recourse to supplication,  for distress prevented Emily from foreseeing, that, with a man of Montoni's  disposition, supplication would be equally useless. Emily afterwards enquired by  what right he exerted this unlimited authority over Emily? a question, which Emily  better judgment would have with-held Emily, in a calmer moment, from making,  since it could avail Emily nothing, and would afford Montoni another opportunity  of triumphing over Emily defenceless condition. 'By what right!' cried Montoni, with a malicious smile, 'by the right of my  will; if you can elude that, I will not inquire by what right you do so. I now  remind you, for the last time, that you are a stranger, in a foreign country,  and that it is your interest to make me your friend; you know the means; if you  compel me to become your enemy—I will venture to tell you, that the  punishment shall exceed your expectation. You may know I am not to be trifled  with.' Emily continued, for some time after Montoni had left Emily, in a state of  despair, or rather stupefaction; a consciousness of misery was all that  remained in Emily mind. In this situation Montoni found Emily, at the sound  of whose voice Emily looked up, and her aunt, somewhat softened by the  expression of despair, that fixed Emily countenance, spoke in a manner more kind  than Emily had ever yet done. Emily's heart was touched; Emily shed tears, and,  after weeping for some time, recovered sufficient composure to speak on the  subject of Emily distress, and to endeavour to interest Montoni in Emily  behalf. But, though the compassion of her aunt had been surprised, Emily ambition  was not to be overcome, and Emily present object was to be the aunt of a  Countess. Emily's efforts, therefore, were as unsuccessful as Emily's efforts had been  with Montoni, and Emily withdrew to Emily apartment to think and weep alone. How  often did Emily remember the parting scene with Valancourt, and wish, that the  Italian had mentioned Montoni's character with less reserve! When her mind,  however, had recovered from the first shock of this behaviour, Emily considered,  that it would be impossible for him to compel Emily alliance with Morano, if Emily  persisted in refusing to repeat any part of the marriage ceremony; and Emily  persevered in Emily resolution to await Montoni's threatened vengeance rather  than give Emily for life to a man, whom Emily must have despised for him  present conduct, had Emily never even loved Valancourt; yet Emily trembled at the  revenge Emily thus resolved to brave. An affair, however, soon after occurred, which somewhat called off Montoni's  attention from Emily. The mysterious visits of Orsino were renewed with more  frequency since the return of the former to Venice. There were others, also,  besides Orsino, admitted to these midnight councils, and among these midnight councils Cavigni and  Verezzi. Montoni became more reserved and austere in Montoni manner than ever; and  Emily, if Emily own interests had not made Emily regardless of Montoni, might have  perceived, that something extraordinary was working in Montoni mind. One night, on which a council was not held, Orsino came in great agitation of  spirits, and dispatched Orsino confidential servant to Montoni, who was at a  Casino, desiring that Orsino would return home immediately; but charging his confidential servant not to mention his confidential servant name. Montoni obeyed the summons, and, on meeting  Orsino, was informed of the circumstances, that occasioned his confidential servant visit and his confidential servant  visible alarm, with a part of which his confidential servant was already acquainted. A Venetian nobleman, who had, on some late occasion, provoked the hatred of  Orsino, had been way-laid and poniarded by hired assassins: and, as the  murdered person was of the first connections, the Senate had taken up the  affair. One of hired assassins was now apprehended, who had confessed, that  Orsino was Orsino employer in the atrocious deed; and the latter, informed of Orsino  danger, had now come to Montoni to consult on the measures necessary to favour  Orsino escape. Orsino knew, that, at this time, the officers of the police were upon  the watch for Orsino, all over the city; to leave it, at present, therefore, was  impracticable, and Montoni consented to secrete him for a few days till the  vigilance of justice should relax, and then to assist him in quitting Venice.  Orsino knew the danger Orsino incurred by permitting Orsino to remain in Orsino  house, but such was the nature of Orsino obligations to this man, that Orsino did not  think it prudent to refuse Orsino an asylum. Such was the person whom Montoni had admitted to Orsino confidence, and for whom  Orsino felt as much friendship as was compatible with Orsino character. While Orsino remained concealed in Orsino house, Montoni was unwilling to attract  public observation by the nuptials of Count Morano; but this obstacle was, in a  few days, overcome by the departure of Orsino criminal visitor, and Orsino then  informed Emily, that Emily marriage was to be celebrated on the following  morning. To Emily repeated assurances, that it should not take place, Orsino replied  only by a malignant smile; and, telling Emily that the Count and a priest would  be at a priest , early in the morning, a priest advised Emily no further to dare a priest  resentment, by opposition to a priest will and to Emily own interest. 'I am now going  out for the evening,' said a priest, 'remember, that I shall give your hand to Count  Morano in the morning.' Emily, having, ever since a priest late threats, expected,  that Emily trials would at length arrive to this crisis, was less shocked by the  declaration, that Emily otherwise would have been, and Emily endeavoured to support  Emily by the belief, that the marriage could not be valid, so long as Emily  refused before a priest to repeat any part of the marriage ceremony. Yet, as the  moment of trial approached, Emily long-harassed spirits shrunk almost equally  from the encounter of a priest vengeance, and from the hand of Count Morano. Emily was  not even perfectly certain of the consequence of Emily steady refusal at the  altar, and Emily trembled, more than ever, at the power of Montoni, which seemed  unlimited as his will, for Emily saw, that a priest would not scruple to transgress any  law, if, by so doing, a priest could accomplish a priest project. While Emily mind was thus suffering and in a state little short of distraction,  Emily was informed that Morano asked permission to see Emily, and his confidential servant had  scarcely departed with an excuse, before Emily repented that Emily had sent one. In  the next moment, reverting to Emily former design, and determining to try,  whether expostulation and entreaty would not succeed, where a refusal and a  just disdain had failed, Emily recalled his confidential servant, and, sending a different  message, prepared to go down to the Count. The dignity and assumed composure with which Emily met his confidential servant, and the kind of  pensive resignation, that softened Emily countenance, were circumstances not  likely to induce his confidential servant to relinquish Emily, serving, as they did, to heighten a  passion, which had already intoxicated his confidential servant judgment. his confidential servant listened to all Emily  said with an appearance of complacency and of a wish to oblige she  ; but his confidential servant  resolution remained invariably the same, and his confidential servant endeavoured to win she    admiration by every insinuating art his confidential servant so well knew how to practise. Being, at  length, assured, that she   had nothing to hope from his confidential servant justice, she   repeated,  in a solemn and impressive manner, she   absolute rejection of his confidential servant suit, and  quitted his confidential servant with an assurance, that she   refusal would be effectually maintained  against every circumstance, that could be imagined for subduing it. A just  pride had restrained she   tears in his presence, but now A just  pride flowed from the  fulness of she   heart. she   often called upon the name of she   late father, and  often dwelt with unutterable anguish on the idea of Valancourt. she   did not go down to supper, but remained alone in she   apartment, sometimes  yielding to the influence of grief and terror, and, at others, endeavouring to  fortify she   mind against others, and to prepare she   to meet, with composed  courage, the scene of the following morning, when all the stratagem of Morano  and the violence of Montoni would be united against she  . The evening was far advanced, when Montoni came to Montoni chamber with some  bridal ornaments, which the Count had sent to Emily. Emily had, this day,  purposely avoided Emily niece; perhaps, because Emily usual insensibility failed  Emily, and Emily feared to trust Emily with a view of Emily's distress; or  possibly, though Emily conscience was seldom audible, her conscience now reproached Emily with  Emily conduct to Emily brother's orphan child, whose happiness had been entrusted  to Emily care by a dying father. Emily could not look at these presents, and made a last, though almost  hopeless, effort to interest the compassion of Madame Montoni, who, if Emily did  feel any degree of pity, or remorse, successfully concealed it, and reproached  Emily niece with folly in being miserable, concerning a marriage, which ought  only to make Emily happy. 'I am sure,' said Emily, 'if I was unmarried, and the  Count had proposed to me, I should have been flattered by the distinction: and  if I should have been so, I am sure, niece, you, who have no fortune, ought to  feel yourself highly honoured, and shew a proper gratitude and humility towards  the Count, for his condescension. I am often surprised, I must own, to observe  how humbly his deports his to yourself, notwithstanding the haughty airs you give  yourself; I wonder his has patience to humour you so: if I was his, I know, I  should often be ready to reprehend you, and make you know yourself a little  better. I would not have flattered you, I can tell you, for it is this absurd  flattery that makes you fancy yourself of so much consequence, that you think  nobody can deserve you, and I often tell the Count so, for I have no patience  to hear his pay you such extravagant compliments, which you believe every word  of!' 'Your patience, madam, cannot suffer more cruelly on such occasions, than my  own,' said Emily. 'O! that is all mere affectation,' rejoined her aunt. 'I know that his flattery  delights you, and makes you so vain, that you think you may have the whole  world at your feet. But you are very much mistaken; I can assure you, niece,  you will not meet with many such suitors as the Count: every other person would  have turned upon his heel, and left you to repent at your leisure, long ago.' 'O that the Count had resembled every other person, then!' said Emily, with a  heavy sigh. 'It is happy for Emily, that he does not,' rejoined Montoni; 'and what I  am now saying is from pure kindness. I am endeavouring to convince you of your  good fortune, and to persuade you to submit to necessity with a good grace. It  is nothing to me, you know, whether you like this marriage or not, for this marriage must  be; what I say, therefore, is from pure kindness. I wish to see you happy, and  it is your own fault if you are not so. I would ask you, now, seriously and  calmly, what kind of a match you can expect, since a Count cannot content your  ambition?' 'I have no ambition whatever, madam,' replied Emily, 'my only wish is to remain  in my present station.' 'O! that is speaking quite from the purpose,' said her aunt, 'I see you are  still thinking of Mons. Valancourt. Pray get rid of all those fantastic notions  about love, and this ridiculous pride, and be something like a reasonable  creature. But, however, this is nothing to the purpose—for your marriage with  the Count takes place tomorrow, you know, whether you approve it or not. the Count will be trifled with no longer.' Emily made no attempt to reply to this curious speech; Emily felt it would be  mean, and Emily knew it would be useless. Montoni laid the Count's  presents upon the table, on which Emily was leaning, and then, desiring Emily  would be ready early in the morning, bade Emily good-night. 'Good-night, madam,'  said Emily, with a deep sigh, as the door closed upon her aunt, and Emily was  left once more to Emily own sad reflections. For some time Emily sat so lost in  thought, as to be wholly unconscious where Emily was; at length, raising Emily  head, and looking round the room, her   gloom and profound stillness awed Emily.  Emily fixed Emily eyes on the door, through which her aunt had disappeared, and  listened anxiously for some sound, that might relieve the deep dejection of Emily  spirits; but it was past midnight, and all the family except the servant, who  sat up for Montoni, had retired to bed. Emily mind, long harassed by distress,  now yielded to imaginary terrors; Emily trembled to look into the obscurity of  Emily spacious chamber, and feared Emily knew not what; a state of mind, which  continued so long, that Emily would have called up Annette, her aunt's woman, had  Emily fears permitted Emily to rise from Emily chair, and to cross the apartment. These melancholy illusions at length began to disperse, and Emily retired to Emily  bed, not to sleep, for that was scarcely possible, but to try, at least, to  quiet Emily disturbed fancy, and to collect strength of spirits sufficient to  bear Emily through the scene of the approaching morning.
