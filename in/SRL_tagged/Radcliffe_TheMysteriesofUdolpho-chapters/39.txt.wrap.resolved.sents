      What transport to retrace our early plays,  our easy bliss, when each thing joy supplied  The woods, the mountains and the warbling maze  Of the wild brooks!
THOMSON Blanche's slumbers continued, till long after the hour, which THOMSON Blanche's slumbers had so  impatiently anticipated, for THOMSON Blanche's slumbers woman, fatigued with travelling, did not call  THOMSON Blanche's slumbers, till breakfast was nearly ready.
THOMSON Blanche's slumbers disappointment, however, was  instantly forgotten, when, on opening the casement, THOMSON Blanche's slumbers saw, on one hand, the  wide sea sparkling in the morning rays, with the  wide sea stealing sails and glancing  oars; and, on the other, the fresh woods, the plains far-stretching and the  blue mountains, all glowing with the splendour of day.
As THOMSON Blanche's slumbers inspired the pure breeze, health spread a deeper blush upon THOMSON Blanche's slumbers  countenance, and pleasure danced in THOMSON Blanche's slumbers eyes.
'Who could first invent convents!'
said THOMSON Blanche's slumbers, 'and who could first persuade  people to go into people?
and to make religion a pretence, too, where all that  should inspire it, is so carefully shut out!
God is best pleased with the  homage of a grateful heart, and, when we view God glories, we feel most  grateful.
I never felt so much devotion, during the many dull years I was in  the convent, as I have done in the few hours, that I have been here, where I  need only look on all around me—to adore God in my inmost heart!'
Saying this, THOMSON Blanche's slumbers left the window, bounded along the gallery, and, in the next  moment, was in the breakfast room, where the Count was already seated.
The  cheerfulness of a bright sunshine had dispersed the melancholy glooms of The  cheerfulness of a bright sunshine  reflections, a pleasant smile was on The  cheerfulness of a bright sunshine countenance, and The  cheerfulness of a bright sunshine spoke in an  enlivening voice to Blanche, whose heart echoed back the tones.
Henri and, soon  after, the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn appeared, and the whole party  seemed to acknowledge the influence of the scene; the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn was so much  re-animated as to receive the civilities of the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn husband with complacency, and  but once forgot the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn good-humour, which was when the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn asked whether they had any  neighbours, who were likely to make THIS BARBAROUS SPOT more tolerable, and  whether the Count believed it possible for the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn to exist here, without some  amusement?
Soon after breakfast the whole party   dispersed; the Count, ordering his steward to  attend his in the library, went to survey the condition of his premises, and to  visit some of his tenants; Henri hastened with alacrity to the shore to examine  a boat, that was to bear some of his tenants on a little voyage in the evening and to  superintend the adjustment of a silk awning; while the Countess, attended by  Mademoiselle Bearn, retired to an apartment on the modern side of the chateau,  which was fitted up with airy elegance; and, as the windows opened upon  balconies, that fronted the sea, the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn was there saved from a view of the HORRID  Pyrenees.
Here, while the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn reclined on a sofa, and, casting the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn languid eyes  over the ocean, which appeared beyond the wood-tops, indulged in the luxuries  of ENNUI, the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn companion read aloud a sentimental novel, on some fashionable  system of philosophy, for the Countess was the Countess somewhat of a PHILOSOPHER,  especially as to INFIDELITY, and among a certain circle the Countess opinions were  waited for with impatience, and received as doctrines.
The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, hastened to indulge, amidst the wild wood-walks  around the chateau, the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn new enthusiasm, where, as the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn wandered under the  shades, the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn gay spirits gradually yielded to pensive complacency.
Now, the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn  moved with solemn steps, beneath the gloom of thickly interwoven branches,  where the fresh dew still hung upon every flower, that peeped from among the  grass; and now tripped sportively along the path, on which the sunbeams darted  and the checquered foliage trembled—where the tender greens of the beech, the  acacia and the mountain-ash, mingling with the solemn tints of the cedar, the  pine and cypress, exhibited as fine a contrast of colouring, as the majestic  oak and oriental plane did of form, to the feathery lightness of the cork tree  and the waving grace of the poplar.
Having reached a rustic seat, within a deep recess of the woods, the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn rested  awhile, and, as the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn eyes caught, through a distant opening, a glimpse of the  blue waters of the Mediterranean, with the white sail, gliding on its bosom, or  of the broad mountain, glowing beneath the mid-day sun, the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn mind experienced  somewhat of that exquisite delight, which awakens the fancy, and leads to  poetry.
The hum of bees alone broke the stillness around the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn, as, with other  insects of various hues, The hum of bees alone sported gaily in the shade, or sipped sweets from  the fresh flowers: and, while Blanche watched a butter-fly, flitting from bud  to bud, the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn indulged the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn in imagining the pleasures of its short day, till  the Countess with Mademoiselle Bearn had composed the following stanzas.
THE BUTTER-FLY TO HIS LOVE   What bowery dell, with fragrant breath,  Courts thee to stay thy airy flight;  Nor seek again the purple heath,  So oft the scene of gay delight?
Long I've watch'd i' the lily's bell,  Whose whiteness stole the morning's beam;  No fluttering sounds thy coming tell,  No waving wings, at distance, gleam.
But fountain fresh, nor breathing grove,  Nor sunny mead, nor blossom'd tree,  So sweet as lily's cell shall prove,—  The bower of constant love and me.
When April buds begin to blow,  The prim-rose, and the hare-bell blue,  That on the verdant moss bank grow,  With violet cups, that weep in dew;   When wanton gales breathe through the shade,  And shake the blooms, and steal the blooms sweets,  And swell the song of ev'ry glade,  I range the forest's green retreats:   There, through the tangled wood-walks play,  Where no rude urchin paces near,  Where sparely peeps the sultry day,  And light dews freshen all the air.
High on a sun-beam oft I sport  O'er bower and fountain, vale and hill;  Oft ev'ry blushing flow'ret court,  That hangs its head o'er winding rill.
But these I'll leave to be thy guide,  And shew thee, where the jasmine spreads  the jasmine snowy leaf, where may-flow'rs hide,  And rose-buds rear their peeping heads.
With me the mountain's summit scale,  And taste the wild-thyme's honied bloom,  Whose fragrance, floating on the gale,  Oft leads me to the cedar's gloom.
Yet, yet, no sound comes in the breeze!
What shade thus dares to tempt thy stay?
Once, me alone thou wish'd to please,  And with me only thou wouldst stray.
But, while thy long delay I mourn,  And chide the sweet shades for their guile,  Thou may'st be true, and their forlorn,  And fairy favours court thy smile.
The tiny queen of fairy-land,  Who knows thy speed, hath sent thee far,  To bring, or ere the night-watch stand,  Rich essence for Rich shadowy car:   Perchance Rich acorn-cups to fill  With nectar from the Indian rose,  Or gather, near some haunted rill,  May-dews, that lull to sleep Love's woes:   Or, o'er the mountains, bade thee fly,  To tell Rich fairy love to speed,  When ev'ning steals upon the sky,  To dance along the twilight mead.
But now I see thee sailing low,  Gay as the brightest flow'rs of spring,  Thy coat of blue and jet I know,  And well thy gold and purple wing.
Borne on the gale, thou com'st to me;  O!
welcome, welcome to my home!
In lily's cell we'll live in glee,  Together o'er the mountains roam!
When Lady Blanche returned to the chateau, instead of going to the apartment of  the Countess, Lady Blanche amused Lady Blanche with wandering over that part of the edifice,  which Lady Blanche had not yet examined, of which the most antient first attracted Lady Blanche  curiosity; for, though what Lady Blanche had seen of the modern was gay and elegant,  there was something in the former more interesting to Lady Blanche imagination.
Having  passed up the great stair-case, and through the oak gallery, Lady Blanche entered upon a  long suite of chambers, whose walls were either hung with tapestry, or  wainscoted with cedar, the furniture of which looked almost as antient as the  rooms themselves; the spacious fire-places, where no mark of social cheer  remained, presented an image of cold desolation; and the whole suite had so  much the air of neglect and desertion, that it seemed, as if the venerable  persons, whose portraits hung upon the walls, had been the last to inhabit whose portraits.
On leaving the  rooms themselves, Lady Blanche found Lady Blanche in another gallery, one end of which  was terminated by a back stair-case, and the other by a door, that seemed to  communicate with the north-side of the chateau, but which being fastened, Lady Blanche  descended the great stair-case, and, opening a door in the wall, a few steps down,  found Lady Blanche in a small square room, that formed part of the west turret of  the castle.
Three windows presented each a separate and beautiful prospect;  that to the north, overlooking Languedoc; another to the west, the hills  ascending towards the Pyrenees, whose awful summits crowned the landscape; and  a third, fronting the south, gave the Mediterranean, and a part of the wild  shores of Rousillon, to the eye.
Having left the west turret of  the castle, and descended the narrow stair-case, Lady Blanche found Lady Blanche  in a dusky passage, where Lady Blanche wandered, unable to find Lady Blanche way, till impatience  yielded to apprehension, and Lady Blanche called for assistance.
Presently steps  approached, and light glimmered through a door at the other extremity of the  passage, which was opened with caution by some person, who did not venture  beyond it, and whom Blanche observed in silence, till a door was closing,  when Lady Blanche called aloud, and, hastening towards a door, perceived the old  housekeeper.
'Dear ma'amselle!
is it you?'
said Dorothee, 'How could you find  your way hither?'
Had Lady Blanche been less occupied by Lady Blanche own fears, Lady Blanche would  probably have observed the strong expressions of terror and surprise on  Dorothee's countenance, who now led Lady Blanche through a long succession of passages  and rooms, that looked as if they had been uninhabited for a century, till they  reached that appropriated to the housekeeper, where Dorothee entreated Lady Blanche  would sit down and take refreshment.
Lady Blanche accepted the sweet meats, offered  to Lady Blanche, mentioned Lady Blanche discovery of the pleasant turret, and Lady Blanche wish to  appropriate it to Lady Blanche own use.
Whether Dorothee's taste was not so sensible to  the beauties of landscape as Lady Blanche young lady's, or that the constant view of  lovely scenery had deadened it, Lady Blanche forbore to praise the subject of Lady Blanche's  enthusiasm, which, however, Lady Blanche silence did not repress.
To Blanche's    enquiry of whither the door Lady Blanche had found fastened at the end of the gallery  led, Lady Blanche replied, that it opened to a suite of rooms, which had not been  entered, during many years, 'For,' added Lady Blanche, 'Lady Blanche's   died in one of  them, and I could never find in my heart to go into them since.'
Lady Blanche, though Lady Blanche wished to see these chambers, forbore, on observing that  Dorothee's eyes were filled with tears, to ask Lady Blanche to unlock them, and, soon  after, went to dress for dinner, at which the whole party met in good spirits  and good humour, except the Countess, whose vacant mind, overcome by the  languor of idleness, would neither suffer Lady Blanche to be happy Lady Blanche, or to  contribute to the happiness of others.
Mademoiselle Bearn, attempting to be  witty, directed Lady Blanche badinage against Henri, who answered, because he could not  well avoid it, rather than from any inclination to notice Lady Blanche, whose liveliness  sometimes amused, but whose conceit and insensibility often disgusted he.
The cheerfulness, with which Lady Blanche rejoined the whole party, vanished, on Lady Blanche  reaching the margin of the sea; Lady Blanche gazed with apprehension upon the immense  expanse of waters, which, at a distance, Lady Blanche had beheld only with delight and  astonishment, and it was by a strong effort, that Lady Blanche so far overcame Lady Blanche fears  as to follow Lady Blanche father into the boat.
As Lady Blanche silently surveyed the vast horizon, bending round the distant verge of  the ocean, an emotion of sublimest rapture struggled to overcome a sense of  personal danger.
A light breeze played on the water, and on the silk awning of  the boat, and waved the foliage of the receding woods, that crowned the cliffs,  for many miles, and which the Count surveyed with the pride of conscious  property, as well as with the eye of taste.
At some distance, among these woods, stood a pavilion, which had once been the  scene of social gaiety, and which its situation still made one of romantic  beauty.
Thither, the Count had ordered coffee and other refreshment to be  carried, and thither the sailors now steered the sailors course, following the  windings of the shore round many a woody promontory and circling bay; while the  pensive tones of horns and other wind instruments, played by the attendants in  a distant boat, echoed among the rocks, and died along the waves.
Lady Blanche had  now subdued Lady Blanche fears; a delightful tranquillity stole over Lady Blanche mind, and held  Lady Blanche in silence; and Lady Blanche was too happy even to remember the convent, or Lady Blanche  former sorrows, as subjects of comparison with Lady Blanche present felicity.
the Countess felt less unhappy than the Countess had done, since the moment of the Countess  leaving Paris; for her mind was now under some degree of restraint; the Countess feared  to indulge the moment of her  leaving Paris wayward humours, and even wished to recover the Count's good  opinion.
On his family, and on the surrounding scene, his looked with tempered  pleasure and benevolent satisfaction, while his son exhibited the gay spirits  of youth, anticipating new delights, and regretless of those, that were passed.
After near an hour's rowing, the whole party landed, and ascended a little path,  overgrown with vegetation.
At a little distance from the point of the eminence,  within the shadowy recess of the woods, appeared the pavilion, which Blanche's  perceived, as Blanche's   caught a glimpse of its portico between the trees, to be  built of variegated marble.
As Blanche's   followed the Countess, Blanche's   often turned Blanche's    eyes with rapture towards the ocean, seen beneath the dark foliage, far below,  and from thence upon the deep woods, whose silence and impenetrable gloom  awakened emotions more solemn, but scarcely less delightful.
The pavilion had been prepared, as far as was possible, on a very short notice,  for the reception of The pavilion visitors; but the faded colours of The pavilion painted walls  and ceiling, and the decayed drapery of The pavilion once magnificent furniture,  declared how long The pavilion had been neglected, and abandoned to the empire of the  changing seasons.
While the party partook of a collation of fruit and coffee,  the horns, placed in a distant part of the woods, where an echo sweetened and  prolonged their melancholy tones, broke softly on the stillness of the scene.
This spot seemed to attract even the admiration of the Countess, or, perhaps,  it was merely the pleasure of planning furniture and decorations, that made Blanche's    dwell so long on the necessity of repairing and adorning it; while the Count,  never happier than when he saw Blanche's   mind engaged by natural and simple objects,  acquiesced in all Blanche's   designs, concerning The pavilion.
The paintings on the  walls and coved ceiling were to be renewed, the canopies and sofas were to be  of light green damask; marble statues of wood-nymphs, bearing on The paintings on the  walls and coved ceiling heads  baskets of living flowers, were to adorn the recesses between the windows,  which, descending to the ground, were to admit to every part of the room, and  it was of octagonal form, the various landscape.
One window opened upon a  romantic glade, where the eye roved among the woody recesses, and the scene was  bounded only by a lengthened pomp of groves; from another, the woodsdisclosed the distant summits of the Pyrenees; a third fronted an avenue,  beyond which the grey towers of Chateau-le-Blanc, and a picturesque part of its  ruin were seen partially among the foliage; while a fourth gave, between the  trees, a glimpse of the green pastures and villages, that diversify the banks  of the Aude.
the Mediterranean, with the bold cliffs, that overlooked the Mediterranean  shores, were the grand objects of a fifth window, and the others gave, in  different points of view, the wild scenery of the woods.
After wandering, for some time, in some time, the whole party returned to the shore and  embarked; and, the beauty of the evening tempting the whole party to extend the whole party  excursion, the whole party proceeded further up the bay.
A dead calm had succeeded the  light breeze, that wafted the whole party hither, and the whole party took to the whole party oars.
Around,  the waters were spread into one vast expanse of polished mirror, reflecting the  grey cliffs and feathery woods, that over-hung its surface, the glow of the  western horizon and the dark clouds, that came slowly from the east.
Blanche's  loved to see their oars imprint the water, and to watch the spreading  circles their oars left, which gave a tremulous motion to the reflected landscape,  without destroying the harmony of a tremulous motion features.
Above the darkness of the woods, Blanche's   now caught a cluster of high towers,  touched with the splendour of the setting rays; and, soon after, the horns  being then silent, Blanche's   heard the faint swell of choral voices from a distance.
'What voices are those, upon the air?'
said the Count, looking round, and  listening; but the strain had ceased.
'It seemed to be a vesper-hymn, which I  have often heard in my convent,' said Blanche's  .
'We are near the monastery, then,' observed the Count; and, the boat soon after  doubling a lofty head-land, the monastery appeared, seated near  the margin of the sea, where the cliffs, suddenly sinking, formed a low shore  within a small bay, almost encircled with woods, among which partial features  of the edifice were seen;—the great gate and gothic window of the hall, the  cloisters and the side of a chapel more remote; while a venerable arch, which  had once led to a part of the fabric, now demolished, stood a majestic ruin  detached from the main building, beyond which appeared a grand perspective of  the woods.
On the grey walls, the moss had fastened, and, round the pointed  windows of a chapel, the ivy and the briony hung in many a fantastic wreath.
All without was silent and forsaken; but, while Blanche's   gazed with admiration  on this venerable pile, whose effect was heightened by the strong lights and  shadows thrown athwart it by a cloudy sun-set, a sound of many voices, slowly  chanting, arose from within.
the Count bade the Count rest on their oars.
The  monks were singing the hymn of vespers, and some female voices mingled with the  strain, which rose by soft degrees, till the high organ and the choral sounds  swelled into full and solemn harmony.
The strain, soon after, dropped into  sudden silence, and was renewed in a low and still more solemn key, till, at  length, the holy chorus died away, and was heard no more.—Blanche sighed,  tears trembled in her eyes, and her thoughts seemed wafted with the sounds to  heaven.
While a rapt stillness prevailed in the boat, a train of friars, and  then of nuns, veiled in white, issued from the cloisters, and passed, under the  shade of the woods, to the main body of the edifice.
the Countess was the first of the whole party to awaken from this pause of silence.
'These dismal hymns and friars make one quite melancholy,' said the Countess; 'twilight  is coming on; pray let us return, or it will be dark before us get home.'
the Count, looking up, now perceived, that the twilight of evening was  anticipated by an approaching storm.
In the east a tempest was collecting; a  heavy gloom came on, opposing and contrasting the glowing splendour of the  setting sun.
The clamorous sea-fowl skimmed in fleet circles upon the surface  of the sea, dipping The clamorous sea-fowl light pinions in the wave, as The clamorous sea-fowl fled away in  search of shelter.
The boatmen pulled hard at The boatmen ; but the thunder, that  now muttered at a distance, and the heavy drops, that began to dimple the  water, made the Count determine to put back to the monastery for shelter, and  the course of the boat was immediately changed.
As the clouds approached the  west, the clouds approached the  west lurid darkness changed to a deep ruddy glow, which, by reflection,  seemed to fire the tops of the woods and the shattered towers of the monastery.
The appearance of the heavens alarmed the Countess and Mademoiselle Bearn,  whose expressions of apprehension distressed the Count, and perplexed his men;  while Lady Blanche continued silent, now agitated with fear, and now with  admiration, as Lady Blanche viewed the grandeur of the clouds, and their effect on the  scenery, and listened to the long, long peals of thunder, that rolled through  the air.
the boat having reached the lawn before the monastery, the Count sent a servant  to announce a servant   arrival, and to entreat shelter of the Superior, who, soon  after, appeared at the great gate, attended by several monks, while a servant  returned with a message, expressive at once of hospitality and pride, but of  pride disguised in submission.
the whole party immediately disembarked, and, having  hastily crossed the lawn—for the shower was now heavy—were received at the  gate by the Superior, who, as they entered, stretched forth his hands and gave  his blessing; and they passed into the great hall, where the lady abbess  waited, attended by several nuns, clothed, like the lady abbess  , in black, and veiled  in white.
The veil of the lady abbess   was, however, thrown half back, and discovered  a countenance, whose chaste dignity was sweetened by the smile of welcome, with  which the lady abbess   addressed the Countess, whom the lady abbess   led, with Blanche and Mademoiselle  Bearn, into the convent parlour, while the Count and Henri were conducted by  the Superior to the refectory.
the Countess, fatigued and discontented, received the politeness of the lady abbess  with careless haughtiness, and had followed the Countess, with indolent steps, to the  parlour, over which the painted casements and wainscot of larch-wood threw, at  all times, a melancholy shade, and where the gloom of evening now loured almost  to darkness.
While the lady abbess   ordered refreshment, and conversed with the Countess,  Blanche's   withdrew to a window, the lower panes of which, being without painting,  allowed the Countess to observe the progress of the storm over the Mediterranean, whose  dark waves, that had so lately slept, now came boldly swelling, in long  succession, to the shore, where they burst in white foam, and threw up a high  spray over the rocks.
A red sulphureous tint overspread the long line of  clouds, that hung above the western horizon, beneath whose dark skirts the sun  looking out, illumined the distant shores of Languedoc, as well as the tufted  summits of the nearer woods, and shed a partial gleam on the western waves.
The  rest of the scene was in deep gloom, except where a sun-beam, darting between  the clouds, glanced on the white wings of the sea-fowl, that circled high among  them, or touched the swelling sail of a vessel, which was seen labouring in the  storm.
Blanche's  , for some time, anxiously watched the progress of the bark, as  the bark threw the western waves in foam around the bark, and, as the lightnings flashed, looked to  the opening heavens, with many a sigh for the fate of the poor mariners.
The sun, at length, set, and the heavy clouds, which had long impended, dropped  over the splendour of his course; the vessel, however, was yet dimly seen, and  Blanche's   continued to observe the vessel, till the quick succession of flashes, lighting  up the gloom of the whole horizon, warned Blanche's   to retire from the window, and  Blanche's   joined the Abbess, who, having exhausted all Blanche's   topics of conversation  with the Countess, had now leisure to notice Blanche's  .
But their discourse was interrupted by tremendous peals of thunder; and the  bell of the monastery soon after ringing out, summoned the inhabitants to  prayer.
As Blanche's   passed the window, Blanche's   gave another look to the ocean,  where, by the momentary flash, that illumined the vast body of the waters, Blanche's    distinguished the vessel Blanche's   had observed before, amidst a sea of foam,  breaking the billows, the mast now bowing to the waves, and then rising high in  air.
Blanche's   sighed fervently as Blanche's   gazed, and then followed the Lady Abbess and the  Countess to a chapel.
Meanwhile, some of the Count's servants, having gone by  land to the chateau for carriages, returned soon after vespers had concluded,  when, an approaching storm being somewhat abated, the Count and his family returned home.
Blanche's   was surprised to discover how much the windings of the shore had  deceived Blanche's  , concerning the distance of the chateau from the monastery, whose  vesper bell Blanche's   had heard, on the preceding evening, from the windows of the  west saloon, and whose towers Blanche's   would also have seen from thence, had not  twilight veiled them.
On them arrival at the chateau, the Countess, affecting more fatigue, than Blanche's    really felt, withdrew to Blanche's   apartment, and the Count, with his daughter and  Henri, went to the supper-room, where his daughter and  Henri had not been long, when his daughter and  Henri heard,  in a pause of the gust, a firing of guns, which the Count understanding to be  signals of distress from some vessel in an approaching storm, went to a window, that  opened towards the Mediterranean, to observe further; but the sea was now  involved in utter darkness, and the loud howlings of a tempest had again  overcome every other sound.
Blanche's  , remembering the bark, which Blanche's   had before  seen, now joined Blanche's   father, with trembling anxiety.
In a few moments, the  report of guns was again borne along the wind, and as suddenly wafted away; a  tremendous burst of thunder followed, and, in the flash, that had preceded the  report of guns,  and which seemed to quiver over the whole surface of the waters, a vessel was  discovered, tossing amidst the white foam of the waves at some distance from  the shore.
Impenetrable darkness again involved the scene, but soon a second  flash shewed the bark, with one sail unfurled, driving towards the coast.
Blanche's   hung upon her father's arm, with looks full of the agony of united  terror and pity, which were unnecessary to awaken the heart of the Count, who  gazed upon the sea with a piteous expression, and, perceiving, that no boat  could live in an approaching storm, forbore to send one; but Blanche's   gave orders to Blanche's   people  to carry torches out upon the cliffs, hoping his people   might prove a kind of beacon  to the vessel, or, at least, warn the crew of the rocks his people   were approaching.
While Henri went out to direct on what part of the cliffs the lights should  appear, Blanche's   remained with her father, at the window, catching, every now  and then, as the lightnings flashed, a glimpse of the vessel; and Blanche's   soon saw,  with reviving hope, the torches flaming on the blackness of night, and, as they  waved over the cliffs, casting a red gleam on the gasping billows.
When the  firing of guns was repeated, the torches were tossed high in the air, as if  answering the signal, and the  firing of guns was then redoubled; but, though the wind  bore the sound away, Blanche's   fancied, as the lightnings glanced, that the vesselwas much nearer the shore.
the Count's servants were now seen, running to and fro, on the rocks; some  venturing almost to the point of the crags, and bending over, held out the Count's servants  torches fastened to long poles; while others, whose steps could be traced only  by the course of the lights, descended the steep and dangerous path, that wound  to the margin of the sea, and, with loud halloos, hailed the mariners, whose  shrill whistle, and then feeble voices, were heard, at intervals, mingling with  an approaching storm.
Sudden shouts from the people on the rocks increased the anxiety of  Blanche to an almost intolerable degree: but  Blanche suspense, concerning the fate  of the mariners, was soon over, when Henri, running breathless into the room,  told that the vessel was anchored in the bay below, but in so shattered a  condition, that the vessel was feared  Blanche would part before the crew could disembark.
the Count immediately gave orders for the Count own boats to assist in bringing his own boats  to shore, and that such of these unfortunate strangers as could not be  accommodated in the adjacent hamlet should be entertained at the chateau.
Among  the latter, were Emily St. Aubert, Monsieur Du Pont, Ludovico and Annette, who,  having embarked at Leghorn and reached Marseilles, were from thence crossing  the Gulf of Lyons, when an approaching storm overtook them.
them were received by the  Count with his usual benignity, who, though  Blanche wished to have proceeded  immediately to the monastery of St. Claire, would not allow  Blanche to leave the  chateau, that night; and, indeed, the terror and fatigue  Blanche had suffered would  scarcely have permitted  Blanche to go farther.
In Monsieur Du Pont the Count discovered an old acquaintance, and much joy and  congratulation passed between them, after which  Blanche was introduced by name to  the Count's family, whose hospitable benevolence dissipated the little  embarrassment, which  Blanche situation had occasioned  Blanche, and the whole party were soon  seated at the supper-table.
The unaffected kindness of Blanche's   and the lively  joy  Blanche expressed on the escape of the strangers, for whom  Blanche pity had been so  much interested, gradually revived  Blanche's languid spirits; and Monsieur Du Pont,  relieved from his terrors for  Blanche and for his, felt the full contrast,  between his late situation on a dark and tremendous ocean, and his present one,  in a cheerful mansion, where his was surrounded with plenty, elegance and smiles  of welcome.
Blanche, meanwhile, in the Count's servants hall, was telling of all the dangers  Blanche  had encountered, and congratulating  Blanche so heartily upon  Blanche own and  Ludovico's escape, and on  Blanche present comforts, that  Blanche often made all that  part of the chateau ring with merriment and laughter.
Ludovico's spirits were  as gay as  Blanche own, but Ludovico's spirits had discretion enough to restrain discretion enough, and tried to  check hers, though in vain, till  Blanche laughter, at length, ascended to MY LADY'S  chamber, who sent to enquire what occasioned so much uproar in the chateau, and  to command silence.
Blanche withdrew early to seek the repose  Blanche so much required, but  Blanche pillow  was long a sleepless one.
On this  Blanche return to  Blanche native country, many  interesting remembrances were awakened; all the events and sufferings  Blanche had  experienced, since  Blanche quitted it, came in long succession to  Blanche fancy, and  were chased only by the image of Valancourt, with whom to believe  Blanche once  more in the same land, after they had been so long, and so distantly separated,  gave  Blanche emotions of indescribable joy, but which afterwards yielded to anxiety  and apprehension, when  Blanche considered the long period, that had elapsed, since  any letter had passed between they, and how much might have happened in this  interval to affect  Blanche future peace.
But the thought, that Valancourt might be  now no more, or, if living, might have forgotten  Blanche, was so very terrible to   Blanche heart, that  Blanche would scarcely suffer  Blanche to pause upon the  possibility.
Blanche determined to inform him, on the following day, of  Blanche arrival  in France, which it was scarcely possible him could know but by a letter from   Blanche, and, after soothing  Blanche spirits with the hope of soon hearing, that him  was well, and unchanged in him affections,  Blanche, at length, sunk to repose.
