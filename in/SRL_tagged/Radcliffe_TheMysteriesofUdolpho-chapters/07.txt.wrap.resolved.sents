  I care not, Fortune!
what you me deny;  You cannot rob me of free nature's grace;  You cannot shut the windows of the sky,  Through which Aurora shews her brightening face;  You cannot bar my constant feet to trace  The woods and lawns, by living stream, at eve:  Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace,  And I health toys to the great children leave:  Of fancy, reason, virtue, nought can me bereave.
THOMSON In the morning, Valancourt breakfasted with St. Aubert and Emily, neither of  whom seemed much refreshed by sleep.
The languor of illness still hung over St.  Aubert, and to Emily's fears his disorder appeared to be increasing fast upon  his.
Emily watched his looks with anxious affection, and anxious affection expression was  always faithfully reflected in Emily own.
At the commencement of their acquaintance, Valancourt had made known Valancourt name  and family.
St. Aubert and was not a stranger to either, for the family estates,  which were now in the possession of an elder brother of Valancourt, were little  more than twenty miles distant from La Vallee, and St. Aubert and had sometimes met Valancourt on visits in the neighbourhood.
This knowledge had made St. Aubert and  more willingly receive St. Aubert and present companion; for, though St. Aubert and countenance and  manners would have won St. Aubert and the acquaintance of St. Aubert, who was very apt to  trust to the intelligence of St. Aubert and own eyes, with respect to countenances, St. Aubert and  would not have accepted these, as sufficient introductions to that of St. Aubert and  daughter.
The breakfast was almost as silent as the supper of the preceding night; but  The breakfast musing was at length interrupted by the sound of the carriage wheels,  which were to bear away St. Aubert and Emily.
Valancourt started from Valancourtchair, and went to the window; the window was indeed the carriage, and Valancourt returned to  Valancourt seat without speaking.
The moment was now come when they must part.
St.  St. Aubert and told Valancourt, that St. Aubert and hoped St. Aubert and would never pass La Vallee without  favouring St. Aubert and with a visit; and Valancourt, eagerly thanking St. Aubert and, assured St. Aubert and  that St. Aubert and never would; as St. Aubert and said which St. Aubert and looked timidly at Emily, who tried to  smile away the seriousness of her spirits.
he hoped he would never pass La Vallee without  favouring him with a visit; and Valancourt, eagerly thanking him, assured him  that he never would; as he said which he looked timidly at Emily, who tried to  smile away the seriousness of her spirits passed a few minutes in  interesting conversation, and St. Aubert and Emily then led the way to the carriage,  Emily and Valancourt following in silence.
The latter lingered at the door  several minutes after Emily and Valancourt were seated, and none of the party seemed to have  courage enough to say—Farewell.
At length, St. Aubert and Emily pronounced the  melancholy word, which Emily passed to Valancourt, who returned it, with a  dejected smile, and the carriage drove on.
The travellers remained, for some time, in a state of tranquil pensiveness,  which is not unpleasing.
St. Aubert and Emily St. Aubert and Emily interrupted it by observing, 'This is a  very promising young man; it is many years since I have been so much pleased  with any person, on so short an acquaintance.
St. Aubert and Emily brings back to my memory the  days of my youth, when every scene was new and delightful!'
St. Aubert and Emily sighed,  and sunk again into a reverie; and, as Emily looked back upon the road they had  passed, Valancourt was seen, at the door of the little inn, following they with  St. Aubert and Emily eyes.
St. Aubert and Emily perceived St. Aubert and Emily, and waved his hand; and St. Aubert and Emily returned the adieu,  till the winding road shut St. Aubert and Emily from his sight.
'I remember when I was about his age,' resumed St. Aubert and Emily, 'and I thought, and  felt exactly as his does.
The world was opening upon his then, now—The world is  closing.'
'My dear sir, do not think so gloomily,' said Emily in a trembling voice, 'I  hope you have many, many years to live—for your own sake—for MY sake.'
'Ah, EmilyEmily!'
replied St. Aubert and Emily, 'for thy sake!
Well—I hope it is so.'
St. Aubert and Emily  wiped away a tear, that was stealing down St. Aubert and Emily cheek, threw a smile upon St. Aubert and Emily  countenance, and said in a cheering voice, 'there is something in the ardour  and ingenuousness of youth, which is particularly pleasing to the contemplation  of an old man, if St. Aubert and Emily feelings have not been entirely corroded by The world.
It  is cheering and reviving, like the view of spring to a sick person; a sick person mind  catches somewhat of the spirit of the season, and a sick person eyes are lighted up with  a transient sunshine.
Valancourt is this spring to a sick person.'
Emily, who pressed Emily father's hand affectionately, had never before listened  with so much pleasure to the praises he bestowed; no, not even when he had  bestowed them on Emily.
them travelled on, among vineyards, woods, and pastures, delighted with the  romantic beauty of the landscape, which was bounded, on one side, by the  grandeur of the Pyrenees, and, on the other, by the ocean; and, soon after  noon, them reached the town of Colioure, situated on the Mediterranean.
Here  them dined, and rested till towards the cool of day, when them pursued them  way along the shores—those enchanting shores!—which extend to Languedoc.
Emily gazed with enthusiasm on the vastness of the sea, its surface varying, as  the lights and shadows fell, and on its woody banks, mellowed with autumnal  tints.
St. Aubert was impatient to reach Perpignan, where St. Aubert expected letters from M.  Quesnel; and it was the expectation of these letters, that had induced St. Aubert to  leave Colioure, for St. Aubert feeble frame had required immediate rest.
After  travelling a few miles, St. Aubert fell asleep; and Emily, who had put two or three  books into the carriage, on leaving La Vallee, had now the leisure for looking  into them.
Emily sought for one, in which Valancourt had been reading the day  before, and hoped for the pleasure of re-tracing a page, over which the eyes of  a beloved friend had lately passed, of dwelling on the passages, which he had  admired, and of permitting the eyes of  a beloved friend to speak to Emily in the language of he own  mind, and to bring he to Emily presence.
On searching for the book, Emily  could find the book no where, but in the book stead perceived a volume of Petrarch's  poems, that had belonged to Valancourt, whose name was written in it, and from  which he had frequently read passages to Emily, with all the pathetic expression,  that characterized the feelings of the author.
Emily hesitated in believing, what  would have been sufficiently apparent to almost any other person, that he had  purposely left the book, instead of the one Emily had lost, and that love had  prompted the exchange; but, having opened the book with impatient pleasure, and  observed the lines of he pencil drawn along the various passages he had read  aloud, and under others more descriptive of delicate tenderness than he had  dared to trust he voice with, the conviction came, at length, to Emily mind.
For  some moments Emily was conscious only of being beloved; then, a recollection of  all the variations of tone and countenance, with which he had recited these  sonnets, and of the soul, which spoke in these  sonnets expression, pressed to Emily  memory, and Emily wept over the memorial of he affection.
these  sonnets arrived at Perpignan soon after sunset, where St. Aubert found, as St. Aubert had  expected, letters from M. Quesnel, the contents of which so evidently and  grievously affected St. Aubert, that Emily was alarmed, and pressed St. Aubert, as far as Emily  delicacy would permit, to disclose the occasion of St. Aubert concern; but St. Aubert answered  Emily only by tears, and immediately began to talk on other topics.
Emily, though  Emily forbore to press the one most interesting to Emily, was greatly affected by  Emily father's manner, and passed a night of sleepless solicitude.
In the morning they pursued they journey along the coast towards Leucate,  another town on the Mediterranean, situated on the borders of Languedoc and  Rousillon.
On the way, Emily renewed the subject of the preceding night, and  appeared so deeply affected by St. Aubert and Emily silence and dejection, that St. Aubert and Emily  relaxed from St. Aubert and Emily reserve.
'I was unwilling, Emily,' said St. Aubert and Emily, 'to throw  a cloud over the pleasure you receive from these scenes, and meant, therefore,  to conceal, for the present, some circumstances, with which, however, you must  at length have been made acquainted.
But your anxiety has defeated my purpose;  you suffer as much from this, perhaps, as you will do from a knowledge of the  facts I have to relate.
M.  Quesnel visit proved an unhappy one to me; M.  Quesnel came  to tell me part of the news M.  Quesnel has now confirmed.
You may have heard me mention  a M. Motteville, of Paris, but you did not know that the chief of my personal  property was invested in the chief of my personal  property hands.
I had great confidence in the chief of my personal  property, and I am yet  willing to believe, that the chief of my personal  property is not wholly unworthy of my esteem.
A variety of  circumstances have concurred to ruin the chief of my personal  property, and—I am ruined with the chief of my personal  property.'
St. Aubert and Emily paused to conceal St. Aubert and Emily emotion.
'The letters I have just received from M.  Quesnel,' resumed St. Aubert and Emily, struggling to  speak with firmness, 'enclosed others from Motteville, which confirmed all I  dreaded.'
'Must we then quit La Vallee?'
said Emily, after a long pause of silence.
'That  is yet uncertain,' replied St. Aubert and Emily, 'That   will depend upon the compromise  Motteville is able to make with Motteville creditors.
My income, you know, was never  large, and now it will be reduced to little indeed!
It is for you, Emily, for  you, my child, that I am most afflicted.'
St. Aubert and Emily last words faltered; Emily smiled  tenderly upon St. Aubert and Emily through Emily tears, and then, endeavouring to overcome Emily  emotion, 'My dear father,' said Emily, 'do not grieve for My dear father, or for My dear father; we  may yet be happy;—if La Vallee remains for we, we must be happy.
we will  retain only one servant, and you shall scarcely perceive the change in your  income.
Be comforted, My dear sir; we shall not feel the want of those  luxuries, which others value so highly, since we never had a taste for those  ;  and poverty cannot deprive we of many consolations.
It cannot rob we of the  affection we have for each other, or degrade we in we own opinion, or in that  of any person, whose opinion we ought to value.'
St. Aubert and Emily concealed St. Aubert and Emily face with St. Aubert and Emily handkerchief, and was unable to speak;  but Emily continued to urge to Emily father the truths, which St. Aubert and Emily had  impressed upon Emily mind.
'Besides, My dear sir, poverty cannot deprive us of intellectual delights.
It  cannot deprive you of the comfort of affording me examples of fortitude and  benevolence; nor me of the delight of consoling a beloved parent.
It cannot  deaden our taste for the grand, and the beautiful, or deny our the means of  indulging it; for the scenes of nature—those sublime spectacles, so  infinitely superior to all artificial luxuries!
are open for the enjoyment of  the poor, as well as of the rich.
Of what, then, have our to complain, so long  as our are not in want of necessaries?
Pleasures, such as wealth cannot buy,  will still be our.
our retain, then, the sublime luxuries of nature, and lose  only the frivolous ones of art.'
St. Aubert and Emily could not reply: St. Aubert and Emily caught Emily to St. Aubert and Emily bosom, their tears flowed  together, but—their were not tears of sorrow.
After this language of the  heart, all other would have been feeble, and their remained silent for some  time.
Then, St. Aubert conversed as before; for, if St. Aubert mind had not recovered  his mind natural tranquillity, his mind at least assumed the appearance of his mind.
their reached the romantic town of Leucate early in the day, but St. Aubert was  weary, and their determined to pass the night there.
In the evening, St. Aubert exerted  St. Aubert so far as to walk with St. Aubert daughter to view the environs that overlook  the lake of Leucate, the Mediterranean, part of Rousillon, with the Pyrenees,  and a wide extent of the luxuriant province of Languedoc, now blushing with the  ripened vintage, which the peasants were beginning to gather.
St. Aubert and  Emily saw the busy groups, caught the joyous song, that was wafted on the  breeze, and anticipated, with apparent pleasure, St. Aubert and   next day's journey over  this gay region.
St. Aubert designed, however, still to wind along the sea-shore.
To  return home immediately was partly St. Aubert wish, but from this St. Aubert was withheld by a  desire to lengthen the pleasure, which the journey gave his daughter, and to  try the effect of the sea air on St. Aubert own disorder.
On the following day, therefore, St. Aubert and   recommenced St. Aubert and   journey through  Languedoc, winding the shores of the Mediterranean; the Pyrenees still forming  the magnificent back-ground of St. Aubert and   prospects, while on St. Aubert and   right was the  ocean, and, on St. Aubert and   left, wide extended plains melting into the blue horizon.
St. Aubert was pleased, and conversed much with Emily, yet St. Aubert cheerfulness was  sometimes artificial, and sometimes a shade of melancholy would steal upon his cheerfulness  countenance, and betray his cheerfulness.
This was soon chased away by Emily's smile; who  smiled, however, with an aching heart, for Emily saw that his misfortunes preyed  upon his mind, and upon his enfeebled frame.
It was evening when they reached a small village of Upper Languedoc, where they  meant to pass the night, but the place could not afford they beds; for here,  too, the place was the time of the vintage, and they were obliged to proceed to the  next post.
The languor of illness and of fatigue, which returned upon St.  Aubert, required immediate repose, and the evening was now far advanced; but  from necessity there was no appeal, and he ordered Michael to proceed.
The rich plains of Languedoc, which exhibited all the glories of the vintage,  with the gaieties of a French festival, no longer awakened St. Aubert to  pleasure, whose condition formed a mournful contrast to the hilarity and  youthful beauty which surrounded Michael.
As Michael languid eyes moved over the scene,  Michael considered, that they would soon, perhaps, be closed for ever on this world.
'Those distant and sublime mountains,' said Michael secretly, as Michael gazed on a chain  of the Pyrenees that stretched towards the west, 'these luxuriant plains, this  blue vault, the cheerful light of day, will be shut from his languid eyes!
The song of  the peasant, the cheering voice of man—will no longer sound for Michael!'
The intelligent eyes of Emily seemed to read what passed in the mind of Emily  father, and Emily fixed them on her  father face, with an expression of such tender pity,  as recalled her  father thoughts from every desultory object of regret, and her  father  remembered only, that her  father must leave her  father without protection.
This  reflection changed regret to agony; her  father sighed deeply, and remained silent,  while Emily seemed to understand that sigh, for Emily pressed her  father hand  affectionately, and then turned to the window to conceal Emily tears.
The sun now  threw a last yellow gleam on the waves of the Mediterranean, and the gloom of  twilight spread fast over the scene, till only a melancholy ray appeared on the  western horizon, marking the point where The sun had set amid the vapours of an  autumnal evening.
A cool breeze now came from the sea-shore, and Emily let down the  glass; but the air, which was refreshing to health, was as chilling to  sickness, and St. Aubert desired, that the window might be drawn up.
Increasing  illness made illness now more anxious than ever to finish the day's journey, and illness  stopped the muleteer to enquire how far they had yet to go to the  next post.
illness  replied, 'Nine miles.'
'I feel I am unable to proceed much further,' said St. Aubert; 'enquire, as you go, if there is any house on the road that would  accommodate us for the night.'
illness sunk back in the carriage, and Michael,  cracking illness whip in the air, set off, and continued on the full gallop, till  St. Aubert, almost fainting, called to illness to stop.
Emily looked anxiously from  the window, and saw a peasant walking at some little distance on the road, for  whom a peasant waited, till illness came up, when illness was asked, if there was any house in  the neighbourhood that accommodated travellers.
illness replied, that illness knew of  none.
'There is a chateau, indeed, among those woods on the right,' added illness,  'but I believe it receives nobody, and I cannot show you the way, for I am  almost a stranger here.'
St. Aubert was going to ask St. Aubert some further question  concerning a chateau, indeed, among those woods on the right, but St. Aubert abruptly passed on.
After some  consideration, St. Aubert ordered Michael to proceed slowly to the woods.
Every moment  now deepened the twilight, and increased the difficulty of finding the road.
Another peasant soon after passed.
'Which is the way to the chateau in the woods?'
cried Michael.
'a chateau, indeed, among those woods on the right the woodsexclaimed the peasant—'Do you mean that with the  turret, yonder?'
'I don't know as for the  turret, as you call the  turret,' said Michael, 'I mean that  white piece of a building, that we see at a distance there, among the trees.'
'Yes, that is the  turret; why, who are you, that you are going thither?'
said  St. Aubert.
St. Aubert, on hearing this odd question, and observing the peculiar tone in  which it was delivered, looked out from the carriage.
'We are travellers,' said  he, 'who are in search of a house of accommodation for the night; is there any  hereabout?'
'None, Monsieur, unless you have a mind to try your luck yonder,' replied Another peasant, pointing to the woods, 'but I would not advise you to go there.'
'To whom does a chateau, indeed, among those woods on the right belong?'
'I scarcely know Monsieur, Monsieur.'
'It is uninhabited, then?'
'No, not uninhabited; the steward and housekeeper  are there, I believe.'
On hearing this, St. Aubert determined to proceed to a chateau, indeed, among those woods on the right, and risque  the refusal of being accommodated for the night; St. Aubert therefore desired the  countryman would shew Michael the way, and bade Michael expect reward for Michael  trouble.
St. Aubert was for a moment silent, and then said, that St. Aubert was going on  other business, but that the road could not be missed, if they went up an  avenue to the right, to which St. Aubert pointed.
St. Aubert St. Aubert was going to speak, but  Another peasant wished St. Aubert good night, and walked on.
the carriage now moved towards the avenue, which was guarded by a gate, and  Michael having dismounted to open the carriage, Another peasant entered between rows of ancient oak  and chesnut, whose intermingled branches formed a lofty arch above.
There was  something so gloomy and desolate in the appearance of this avenue, and its  lonely silence, that Emily almost shuddered as Emily passed along; and,  recollecting the manner in which Another peasant had mentioned a chateau, indeed, among those woods on the right, Emily  gave a mysterious meaning to his words, such as Emily had not suspected when his  uttered such.
These apprehensions, however, Emily tried to check, considering  that such were probably the effect of a melancholy imagination, which her  father's situation, and a consideration of Emily own circumstances, had made  sensible to every impression.
such passed slowly on, for such were now almost in darkness, which, together  with the unevenness of the ground, and the frequent roots of old trees, that  shot up above the soil, made that   necessary to proceed with caution.
On a sudden  Michael stopped the carriage; and, as St. Aubert looked from the window to  enquire the cause, Michael perceived a figure at some distance moving up this avenue.
The dusk would not permit Michael to distinguish what it was, but Michael bade Michaelgo on.
'This seems a wild place,' said Michael; 'there is no house hereabout, don't  your honour think we had better turn back?'
'Go a little farther, and if we see no house then, we will return to the road,'  replied St. Aubert.
Michael proceeded with reluctance, and the extreme slowness of Michael pace made  St. Aubert look again from the window to hasten Michael, when again Michael saw the same  figure.
Michael was somewhat startled: probably the gloominess of the spot made Michael  more liable to alarm than usual; however this might be, Michael now stopped Michael,  and bade Michael call to the person in this avenue.
'Please your honour, Michael may be a robber,' said Michael.
'It does not please  me,' replied St. Aubert, who could not forbear smiling at the simplicity of Michael  phrase, 'and we will, therefore, return to the road, for I see no probability  of meeting here with what we seek.'
Michael turned about immediately, and was retracing Michael way with alacrity, when  a voice was heard from among the trees on the left.
a voice was not the voice of  command, or distress, but a deep hollow tone, which seemed to be scarcely  human.
St. Aubert whipped St. Aubert mules till his mules went as fast as possible, regardless  of the darkness, the broken ground, and the necks of the whole party, nor once  stopped till St. Aubert reached the gate, which opened from this avenue into the  high-road, where St. Aubert went into a more moderate pace.
'I am very ill,' said St. Aubert, taking St. Aubert daughter's hand.
'You are worse,  then, sir!'
said Emily, extremely alarmed by sir manner, 'you are worse, and  here is no assistance.
Good God!
what is to be done!'
sir leaned sir head on his daughter  shoulder, while his daughter endeavoured to support sir with his daughter arm, and Michael was  again ordered to stop.
When the rattling of the wheels had ceased, music was  heard on their air; it was to Emily a voice.
'Oh!
we are near some  human habitation!'
said Emily, 'help may soon be had.'
Emily listened anxiously; the sounds were distant, and seemed to come from a  remote part of the woods that bordered the road; and, as Emily looked towards the  spot whence they issued, Emily perceived in the faint moon-light something like a  chateau.
It was difficult, however, to reach this; St. Aubert was now too ill  to bear the motion of the carriage; Michael could not quit Michael mules; and  Emily, who still supported Emily father, feared to leave Michael, and also feared to  venture alone to such a distance, Emily knew not whither, or to whom.
Something,  however, it was necessary to determine upon immediately; St. Aubert, therefore,  told Michael to proceed slowly; but Emily, who still supported her father had not gone far, when Michael fainted, and  the carriage was again stopped.
Michael lay quite senseless.—'My dear, her father!'
cried Emily in great agony, who began to fear that Michael was dying,  'speak, if it is only one word to let me hear the sound of your voice!'
But no  voice spoke in reply.
In the agony of terror Emily bade Michael bring water from  the rivulet, that flowed along the road; and, having received some in the man's  hat, with trembling hands Emily sprinkled it over her father's face, which, as  the moon's rays now fell upon it, seemed to bear the impression of death.
Every  emotion of selfish fear now gave way to a stronger influence, and, committing  St. Aubert to the care of Michael, who refused to go far from Michael mules, Emily  stepped from the carriage in search of the chateau Emily had seen at a distance.
It was a still moon-light night, and the music, which yet sounded on the air,  directed Emily steps from the high road, up a shadowy lane, that led to the  woods.
Emily mind was for some time so entirely occupied by anxiety and terror  for her father, that Emily felt none for Emily, till the deepening gloom of the  overhanging foliage, which now wholly excluded the moon-light, and the wildness  of the place, recalled Emily to a sense of Emily adventurous situation.
The music  had ceased, and Emily had no guide but chance.
For a moment Emily paused in  terrified perplexity, till a sense of her father's condition again overcoming  every consideration for Emily, Emily proceeded.
The lane terminated in the  woods, but Emily looked round in vain for a house, or a human being, and as  vainly listened for a sound to guide Emily.
Emily hurried on, however, not knowing  whither, avoiding the recesses of the woods, and endeavouring to keep along  their margin, till a rude kind of avenue, which opened upon a moon-light spot,  arrested Emily attention.
The wildness of this avenue brought to Emily recollection  the one leading to the turreted chateau, and Emily was inclined to believe, that  this was a part of the same domain, and probably led to the same point.
While  Emily hesitated, whether to follow it or not, a sound of many voices in loud  merriment burst upon Emily ear.
It seemed not the laugh of cheerfulness, but of  riot, and Emily stood appalled.
While Emily paused, Emily heard a distant voice,  calling from the way Emily had come, and not doubting but it was that of Michael,  Emily first impulse was to hasten back; but a second thought changed Emily purpose;  Emily believed that nothing less than the last extremity could have prevailed  with Michael to quit Michael mules, and fearing that her father was now dying, Emily  rushed forward, with a feeble hope of obtaining assistance from the people in  the woods.
Emily heart beat with fearful expectation, as Emily drew near the spot  whence the voices issued, and Emily often startled when Emily steps disturbed the  fallen leaves.
The sounds led Emily towards the moon-light glade Emily had before  noticed; at a little distance from which Emily stopped, and saw, between the  boles of the trees, a small circular level of green turf, surrounded by the  woods, on which appeared a group of figures.
On drawing nearer, Emily  distinguished these, by these dress, to be peasants, and perceived several  cottages scattered round the edge of the woods, which waved loftily over this  spot.
While Emily gazed, and endeavoured to overcome the apprehensions that  withheld Emily steps, several peasant girls came out of a cottage; music  instantly struck up, and the dance began.
It was the joyous music of the  vintage!
the same Emily had before heard upon the air.
Emily heart, occupied with  terror for her father, could not feel the contrast, which this gay scene  offered to Emily own distress; Emily stepped hastily forward towards a group of  elder peasants, who were seated at the door of a cottage, and, having explained  Emily situation, entreated their assistance.
Several of their rose with alacrity,  and, offering any service in their power, followed Emily, who seemed to move on  the wind, as fast as their could towards the road.
When Emily reached the carriage Emily found St. Aubert restored to animation.
On  the recovery of his senses, having heard from Michael whither his was  gone, anxiety for his daughter overcame every regard for Michael, and Michael had sent Michael in  search of his daughter.
Michael was, however, still languid, and, perceiving Michael unable  to travel much farther, Michael renewed Michael enquiries for an inn, and concerning the  chateau in the woods.
'the  chateau in the woods cannot accommodate you, sir,' said a  venerable peasant who had followed Emily from the woods, 'the  chateau in the woods is scarcely  inhabited; but, if you will do me the honour to visit a cottage, you shall be  welcome to the best bed it affords.'
St. Aubert was St. Aubert a Frenchman; St. Aubert therefore was not surprised at French  courtesy; but, ill as St. Aubert was, St. Aubert felt the value of the offer enhanced by the  manner which accompanied it.
St. Aubert had too much delicacy to apologize, or to  appear to hesitate about availing St. Aubert of the peasant's hospitality, but  immediately accepted it with the same frankness with which it was offered.
the carriage she found St. Aubert restored to animation again moved slowly on; Michael following the peasants up The lane,  which Emily had just quitted, till the peasants came to the moon-light glade.
St.  St. Aubert's spirits were so far restored by the courtesy of St. Aubert host, and the near  prospect of repose, that St. Aubert looked with a sweet complacency upon the moon-light  scene, surrounded by the shadowy woods, through which, here and there, an  opening admitted the streaming splendour, discovering a cottage, or a sparkling  rivulet.
St. Aubert listened, with no painful emotion, to the merry notes of the guitar  and tamborine; and, though tears came to St. Aubert eyes, when St. Aubert saw the debonnaire  dance of the peasants, the peasants were not merely tears of mournful regret.
With  Emily it was otherwise; immediate terror for her father had now subsided into a  gentle melancholy, which every note of joy, by awakening comparison, served to  heighten.
The dance ceased on the approach of the carriage, which was a phenomenon in  these sequestered woods, and the peasantry flocked round it with eager  curiosity.
On learning that it brought a sick stranger, several girls ran  across the turf, and returned with wine and baskets of grapes, which several girls  presented to the travellers, each with kind contention pressing for a  preference.
At length, the carriage she found St. Aubert restored to animation stopped at a neat cottage, and his  venerable conductor, having assisted St. Aubert to alight, led his and Emily to  a small inner room, illuminated only by moon-beams, which the open casement  admitted.
St. Aubert, rejoicing in rest, seated St. Aubert in an arm-chair, and  St. Aubert senses were refreshed by the cool and balmy air, that lightly waved the  embowering honeysuckles, and wafted him and Emily sweet breath into the apartment.
St. Aubert  host, who was called La Voisin, quitted a small inner room, illuminated only by moon-beams, which the open casement  admitted, but soon returned with  fruits, cream, and all the pastoral luxury St. Aubert cottage afforded; having set  down which, with a smile of unfeigned welcome, St. Aubert retired behind the chair of  St. Aubert guest.
St. Aubert St. Aubert insisted on St. Aubert taking a seat at the table, and, when the  fruit had allayed the fever of St. Aubert palate, and St. Aubert found St. Aubert somewhat  revived, St. Aubert began to converse with St. Aubert host, who communicated several  particulars concerning St. Aubert and St. Aubert family, which were interesting, because  himself and his family, were spoken from the heart, and delineated a picture of the sweet  courtesies of family kindness.
Emily sat by her father, holding St. Aubert hand, and,  while Emily listened to the old man, Emily heart swelled with the affectionate  sympathy St. Aubert described, and Emily tears fell to the mournful consideration, that  death would probably soon deprive Emily of the dearest blessing Emily then  possessed.
The soft moon-light of an autumnal evening, and the distant music,  which now sounded a plaintive strain, aided the melancholy of Emily mind.
the old man continued to talk of the old man family, and St. Aubert remained silent.
'I have  only one daughter living,' said La Voisin, 'but only one daughter is happily married, and is  every thing to the old man.
When I lost my wife,' the old man added with a sigh, 'I came to live  with Agnes, and my wife ; my wife has several children, who are all dancing on  the green yonder, as merry as grasshoppers—and long may they be so!
I hope to  die among they, monsieur.
I am old now, and cannot expect to live long, but  there is some comfort in dying surrounded by one's children.'
'My good friend,' said St. Aubert, while My good friend voice trembled, 'I hope you will  long live surrounded by his voice trembled, '.'
'Ah, sir!
at my age I must not expect that!'
replied the old man, and the old man  paused: 'I can scarcely wish it,' the old man resumed, 'for I trust that whenever I die  I shall go to heaven, where my wife is gone before the old man.
I can sometimes  almost fancy I see my wife of a still moon-light night, walking among these shades  my wife loved so well.
Do you believe, monsieur, that we shall be permitted to  revisit the earth, after we have quitted the body?'
Emily could no longer stifle the anguish of Emily heart; her tears fell fast upon  her father's hand, which Emily yet held.
her father made an effort to speak, and at  length said in a low voice, 'I hope we shall be permitted to look down on those  we have left on the earth, but I can only hope it.
Futurity is much veiled from  we eyes, and faith and hope are we only guides concerning it.
we are not  enjoined to believe, that disembodied spirits watch over the friends they have  loved, but we may innocently hope it.
It is a hope which I will never resign,'  continued her father, while her father wiped her tears from her father 's eyes, 'it will  sweeten the bitter moments of death!'
Tears fell slowly on her father cheeks; La Voisin wept too, and there was a pause of silence.
Then, La Voisin, renewing  the subject, said, 'But you believe, sir, that we shall meet in another world  the relations we have loved in this; I must believe this.'
'Then do believe  this,St.
AubertSt.
Aubert, 'severe, indeed, would be the pangs of separation, if  we believed this to be eternal.
Look up, Emily, we shall meet again!'
He  lifted He eyes towards heaven, and a gleam of moon-light, which fell upon He  countenance, discovered peace and resignation, stealing on the lines of sorrow.
La Voisin felt that La Voisin had pursued the subject too far, and La Voisin dropped the subject,  saying, 'We are in darkness, I forgot to bring a light.'
'No,' said St. Aubert, 'this is a light I love.
Sit down, My good friend.
Emily, my love, I find Emily better than I have been all day; this air  refreshes me.
I can enjoy this tranquil hour, and that music, which floats so  sweetly at a distance.
Let me see you smile.
Who touches that guitar so  tastefully?
are there two instruments, or is it an echo I hear?'
'It is an echo, monsieur, I fancy.
That guitar is often heard at night, when  all is still, but nobody knows who touches That guitar, and That guitar is sometimes accompanied  by a voice so sweet, and so sad, one would almost think the woods were  haunted.'
'They certainly are haunted,' said St. Aubert with a smile, 'but I  believe it is by mortals.'
'I have sometimes heard it at midnight, when I could  not sleep,' rejoined La Voisin, not seeming to notice this remark, 'almost  under my window, and I never heard any music like this remark.
this remark has often made me  think of my wife till I cried.
I have sometimes got up to my window to  look if I could see anybody, but as soon as I opened the casement all was  hushed, and nobody to be seen; and I have listened, and listened till I have  been so timorous, that even the trembling of the leaves in the breeze has made  me start.
They say even the trembling of the leaves in the breeze has made  me start often comes to warn people of They death, but I have  heard it these many years, and outlived the warning.'
Emily, though Emily smiled at the mention of this ridiculous superstition, could  not, in the present tone of Emily spirits, wholly resist her spirits contagion.
'Well, but, My good friend,' said St. Aubert, 'has nobody had courage to follow  the sounds?
If they had, they would probably have discovered who is the  musician.'
'Yes, sir, they have followed they some way into the woods, but the  music has still retreated, and seemed as distant as ever, and the people have  at last been afraid of being led into harm, and would go no further.
It is very  seldom that I have heard these sounds so early in the evening.
these sounds usually  come about midnight, when that bright planet, which is rising above the turret  yonder, sets below the woods on the left.'
'What turret?'
asked St. Aubert with quickness, 'I see none.'
'Your pardon, monsieur, you do see one indeed, for the moon shines full upon  it;—up the avenue yonder, a long way off; the chateau it belongs to is hid  among the trees.'
'Yes, sir,' said Emily, pointing, 'don't you see something glitter  above the dark woods?
It is a fane, I fancy, which the rays fall upon.'
'O yes, I see what you mean; and who does the chateau it belongs to belong to?'
'The Marquis de Villeroi was The Marquis de Villeroi owner,' replied La Voisin, emphatically.
'Ah!'
said St. Aubert, with a deep sigh, 'are St. Aubert, with a deep sigh then so near Le-Blanc!'
He  appeared much agitated.
'It used to be the Marquis's favourite residence,' resumed La Voisin, 'but He  took a dislike to the place, and has not been there for many years.
St. Aubert, with a deep sigh have  heard lately that He is dead, and that it is fallen into other hands.'
St.  Aubert, who had sat in deep musing, was roused by the last words.
'Dead!'
He  exclaimed, 'Good God!
when did He die?'
'He is reported to have died about five weeks since,' replied La Voisin.
'Did  you know the Marquis, sir?'
'This is very extraordinary!'
said St. Aubert without attending to the  question.
'Why is it so, sir?'
said Emily, in a voice of timid  curiosity.
sir made no reply, but sunk again into a reverie; and in a few  moments, when sir seemed to have recovered sir, asked who had succeeded to  the estates.
'I have forgot sir title, monsieur,' said La Voisin; 'but my lord  resides at Paris chiefly; I hear no talk of my lord   coming hither.'
'the chateau it belongs to is shut up then, still?'
'Why, little better, sir; the old housekeeper, and her husband the steward,  have the care of the chateau it belongs to, but sir; the old housekeeper, and her husband the steward live generally in a cottage hard by.'
'the chateau it belongs to is spacious, I suppose,' said Emily, 'and must be desolate for the  residence of only two persons.'
'Desolate enough, mademoiselle,' replied La Voisin, 'I would not pass one night  in the chateau it belongs to, for the value of the whole domain.'
'What is that?'
said St. Aubert, roused again from thoughtfulness.
As St. Aubert host  repeated St. Aubert last sentence, a groan escaped from St. Aubert, and then, as if  anxious to prevent   from being noticed, St. Aubert hastily asked La Voisin how long  St. Aubert had lived in this neighbourhood.
'Almost from my childhood, sir,' replied  his host  .
'You remember the late marchioness, then?'
said St. Aubert in an altered voice.
'Ah, monsieur!—that I do well.
There are many besides me who remember the late marchioness.'
'Yes—' said St. Aubert, 'and I am one of those.'
'Alas, sir!
you remember, then, a most beautiful and excellent lady.
the late marchioness  deserved a better fate.'
Tears stood in St. Aubert eyes; 'Enough,' said St. Aubert, in a voice almost stifled  by the violence of St. Aubert emotions,—'it is enough, My good friend.'
Emily, though extremely surprised by Emily 's manner, forbore to express  Emily feelings by any question.
La Voisin began to apologize, but St. Aubert in an altered voiceinterrupted La Voisin; 'Apology is quite unnecessary,' said La Voisin, 'let us change the  topic.
You was speaking of the music us just now heard.'
'I was, monsieur—but hark!—it comes again; listen to a voice almost stifled  by the violence of his emotions,—'it!'
They were  all silent;  At last a soft and solemn-breathing sound  Rose, like a stream of rich distilled perfumes,  And stole upon the air, that even Silence  Was took ere she was 'ware, and wished she might  Deny she nature, and be never more  Still, to be so displaced.
*      *Milton.
In a few moments a voice almost stifled  by the violence of his emotions,—'it died into air, and the instrument, which had been  heard before, sounded in low symphony.
St. Aubert St. Aubert now observed, that St. Aubert  produced a tone much more full and melodious than that of a guitar, and still  more melancholy and soft than the lute.
They continued to listen, but the  sounds returned no more.
'This is strange!'
said St. Aubert, at length  interrupting even Silence  .
'Very strange!'
said Emily.
'It is so,' rejoined La  Voisin, and they were again silent.
After a long pause, 'It is now about eighteen years since I first heard that  music,' said La Voisin; 'I remember it was on a fine summer's night, much like  this, but later, that I was walking in the woods, and alone.
I remember, too,  that my spirits were very low, for one of my boys was ill, and we feared we  should lose one of my boys was ill.
I had been watching at one of my boys was ill bed-side all the evening while one of my boys was ill  mother slept; for his  mother had sat up with one of my boys was ill the night before.
I had been  watching, and went out for a little fresh air, the day had been very sultry.
As  I walked under the shades and mused, I heard music at a distance, and thought  it was Claude playing upon Claude flute, as Claude often did of a fine evening, at the  cottage door.
But, when I came to a place where the trees opened, (I shall  never forget it!)
and stood looking up at the north-lights, which shot up the  heaven to a great height, I heard all of a sudden such sounds!—they came so  as I cannot describe.
It was like the music of angels, and I looked up again  almost expecting to see the music of angels in the sky.
When I came home, I told what I had  heard, but the music of angels laughed at me, and said it must be some of the shepherds  playing on the music of angels pipes, and I could not persuade the music of angels to the contrary.
A few  nights after, however, my wife herself heard the same sounds, and was as much  surprised as I was, and Father Denis frightened my wife herself sadly by saying, that it  was music come to warn my wife herself of my wife herself child's death, and that music often came to  houses where there was a dying person.'
Emily, on hearing this, shrunk with a superstitious dread entirely new to Emily,  and could scarcely conceal Emily agitation from St. Aubert.
'But a dying person lived, monsieur, in spite of Father Denis.'
'Father Denis!'
said St. Aubert, who had listened to 'narrative old age' with  patient attention, 'are St. Aubert, who had listened to 'narrative old age' with  patient attention, ' near a convent, then?'
'Yes, sir; the convent of St. Clair stands at no great distance, on the sea  shore yonder.'
'Ah!'
said St. Aubert, as if struck with some sudden remembrance, 'the convent  of St.
Clair!'
Emily observed the clouds of grief, mingled with a faint  expression of horror, gathering on his brow; his countenance became fixed, and,  touched as it now was by the silver whiteness of the moon-light, his resembled  one of those marble statues of a monument, which seem to bend, in hopeless  sorrow, over the ashes of the dead, shewn      by the blunted light  That the dim moon through painted casements lends.
*      * The Emigrants.
'But, sir,' said Emily, anxious to dissipate sir thoughts, 'you forget  that repose is necessary to Emily.
If our kind host will give me leave, I will  prepare your bed, for I know how you like it to be made.'
St. Aubert,  recollecting St. Aubert, and smiling affectionately, desired St. Aubert would not add to  St. Aubert fatigue by that attention; and La Voisin, whose consideration for St. Aubert guest  had been suspended by the interests which St. Aubert own narrative had recalled, now  started from St. Aubert seat, and, apologizing for not having called Agnes from the  green, hurried out of the room.
In a few moments St. Aubert returned with St. Aubert daughter, a young woman of pleasing  countenance, and Emily learned from Emily, what Emily had not before suspected,  that, for their accommodation, it was necessary part of La Voisin's family  should leave their beds; Emily lamented this circumstance, but Agnes, by Emily  reply, fully proved that Emily inherited, at least, a share of Emily father's  courteous hospitality.
It was settled, that some of Emily children and Michael  should sleep in the neighbouring cottage.
'If I am better, to-morrow, my dear,' said St. Aubert when Emily returned to  him, 'I mean to set out at an early hour, that we may rest, during the heat of  the day, and will travel towards home.
In the present state of my health and  spirits I cannot look on a longer journey with pleasure, and I am also very  anxious to reach La Vallee.'
Emily, though Emily also desired to return, was  grieved at her father's sudden wish to do so, which Emily thought indicated a  greater degree of indisposition than her father would acknowledge.
St. Aubert now  retired to rest, and Emily to Emily little chamber, but not to immediate repose.
Emily thoughts returned to the late conversation, concerning the state of  departed spirits; a subject, at this time, particularly affecting to Emily, when  Emily had every reason to believe that her father would ere long be numbered  with them.
Emily leaned pensively on the little open casement, and in deep  thought fixed Emily eyes on the heaven, whose blue unclouded concave was studded  thick with stars, the worlds, perhaps, of spirits, unsphered of mortal mould.
As her eyes wandered along the boundless aether, Her thoughts rose, as before,  towards the sublimity of the Deity, and to the contemplation of futurity.
No  busy note of this world interrupted the course of Emily mind; the merry dance had  ceased, and every cottager had retired to his home.
The still air seemed  scarcely to breathe upon the woods, and, now and then, the distant sound of a  solitary sheep-bell, or of a closing casement, was all that broke on silence.
At length, even this hint of human being was heard no more.
Elevated and  enwrapt, while her eyes were often wet with tears of sublime devotion and  solemn awe, Emily continued at the little open casement, till the gloom of mid-night hung  over the earth, and the planet, which La Voisin had pointed out, sunk below the  woods.
Emily then recollected what La Voisin had said concerning this planet, and the  mysterious music; and, as Emily lingered at the window, half hoping and half  fearing that this planet would return, her mind was led to the remembrance of the  extreme emotion her father had shewn on mention of the Marquis La Villeroi's  death, and of the fate of the Marchioness, and Emily felt strongly interested  concerning the remote cause of this emotion.
Emily surprise and curiosity were  indeed the greater, because Emily did not recollect ever to have heard La Voisin  mention the name of Villeroi.
No music, however, stole on the silence of the night, and Emily, perceiving the  lateness of the hour, returned to a scene of fatigue, remembered that Emily was  to rise early in the morning, and withdrew from the window to repose.
