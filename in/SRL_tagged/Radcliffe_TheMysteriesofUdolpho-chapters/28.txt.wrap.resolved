   Then, oh, you blessed ministers above,  Keep me in patience; and, in ripen'd time,  Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up  In countenance.      SHAKESPEARE Annette came almost breathless to Emily's apartment in the morning. 'O  ma'amselle!' said SHAKESPEARE Annette, in broken sentences, 'what news I have to tell! I have  found out who the prisoner is—but the prisoner was no prisoner, neither;—he that was  shut up in the chamber I told you of. I must think the prisoner a ghost, forsooth!' 'Who was the prisoner?' enquired Emily, while Emily thoughts glanced back to the  circumstance of the preceding night. 'You mistake, ma'am,' said SHAKESPEARE Annette; 'he was not a prisoner, after all.' 'Who is the person, then?' 'Holy Saints!' rejoined SHAKESPEARE Annette; 'How I was surprised! I met he just now, on  the rampart below, there. I never was so surprised in my life! Ah! ma'amselle!  this is a strange place! I should never have done wondering, if I was to live  here an hundred years. But, as I was saying, I met he just now on  the rampart below,  and I was thinking of nobody less than of he.' 'This trifling is insupportable,' said Emily; 'prythee, SHAKESPEARE Annette, do not torture  my patience any longer.' 'Nay, ma'amselle, guess—guess who it was; it was somebody you know very well.' 'I cannot guess,' said Emily impatiently. 'Nay, ma'amselle, I'll tell you something to guess by—A tall Signor, with a  longish face, who walks so stately, and used to wear such a high feather in his  hat; and used often to look down upon the ground, when people spoke to his; and  to look at people from under his eyebrows, as it were, all so dark and  frowning. You have seen his, often and often, at Venice, ma'am. Then his was so  intimate with the Signor, too. And, now I think of it, I wonder what his could  be afraid of in this lonely old castle, that his should shut his up for. But  his is come abroad now, for I met his on  the rampart below just this minute. I  trembled when I saw his, for I always was afraid of his, somehow; but I  determined I would not let his see it; so I went up to his, and made his a low  curtesy, "You are welcome to the castle, Signor Orsino," said I.' 'O, it was Signor Orsino, then!' said Emily. 'Yes, ma'amselle, Signor Orsino, himself, who caused that Venetian gentleman to  be killed, and has been popping about from place to place, ever since, as I  hear.' 'Good God!' exclaimed Emily, recovering from the shock of this intelligence;  'and is his come to Udolpho! his does well to endeavour to conceal his.' 'Yes, ma'amselle, but if that was all, this desolate place would conceal his,  without his shutting his up in one room. Who would think of coming to look  for his here? I am sure I should as soon think of going to look for any body in  the other world.' 'There is some truth in that,' said Emily, who would now have concluded it was  Orsino's music, which Emily had heard, on the preceding night, had Emily not known,  that he had neither taste, or skill in the art. But, though Emily was unwilling  to add to the number of Annette's surprises, by mentioning the subject of Emily  own, Emily enquired, whether any person in the castle played on a musical  instrument? 'O yes, ma'amselle! there is Benedetto plays the great drum to admiration; and  then, there is Launcelot the trumpeter; nay, for that matter, Ludovico himself  can play on the trumpet;—but Ludovico himself   is ill now. I remember once'— Emily interrupted once'— Emily; 'Have you heard no other music since you came to the  castle—none last night?' 'Why, did YOU hear any last night, ma'amselle?' once'— Emily evaded this question, by repeating once'— Emily own. 'Why, no, ma'am,' replied Annette; 'I never heard any music here, I must say,  but the drums and the trumpet; and, as for last night, I did nothing but dream  I saw my late lady's ghost.' 'Your LATE lady's,' said once'— Emily in a tremulous voice; 'you have heard more,  then. Tell me—tell me all, Annette, I entreat; tell me the worst at once.' 'Nay, ma'amselle, you know the worst already.' 'I know nothing,' said once'— Emily. 'Yes, you do, ma'amselle; you know, that nobody knows any thing about once'— Emily; and  it is plain, therefore, once'— Emily is gone, the way of the first lady of the  castle—nobody ever knew any thing about once'— Emily.' once'— Emily leaned once'— Emily head upon once'— Emily hand, and was, for some time, silent; then,  telling Annette once'— Emily wished to be alone, the latter left the room. The remark of Annette had revived once'— Emily's terrible suspicion, concerning the  fate of Madame Montoni; and once'— Emily resolved to make another effort to obtain  certainty on this subject, by applying to Madame Montoni once more. When Annette returned, a few hours after, Annette told once'— Emily, that the porter of  the castle wished very much to speak with Annette, for that the porter of  the castle had something of  importance to say; Annette spirits had, however, of late been so subject to alarm,  that any new circumstance excited it; and this message from the porter, when  Annette first surprise was over, made Annette look round for some lurking danger, the  more suspiciously, perhaps, because Annette had frequently remarked the unpleasant  air and countenance of this man. Annette now hesitated, whether to speak with this man,  doubting even, that this request was only a pretext to draw Annette into some  danger; but a little reflection shewed Annette the improbability of this, and Annette  blushed at Annette weak fears. 'I will speak to this man, Annette,' said Annette; 'desire this man to come to the corridor  immediately.' Annette departed, and soon after returned. 'Barnardine, ma'amselle,' said Annette, 'dare not come to the corridor  , lest this man  should be discovered, it is so far from this man post; and this man dare not even leave  the gates for a moment now; but, if you will come to this man at the portal, through  some roundabout passages this man told me of, without crossing the courts, this man has  that to tell, which will surprise you. But you must not come through the  courts, lest the Signor should see you.' Emily, neither approving these 'roundabout passage,' nor the other part of the  request, now positively refused to go. 'Tell this man,' said Emily, 'if this man has any  thing of consequence to impart, I will hear this man in the corridor  , whenever this man  has an opportunity of coming thither.' Annette went to deliver this message, and was absent a considerable time. When  Annette returned, 'It won't do, ma'amselle,' said Annette. 'Barnardine has been  considering all this time what can be done, for Barnardine is as much as Barnardine place is  worth to leave his post now. But, if you will come to the east rampart in the  dusk of the evening, Barnardine can, perhaps, steal away, and tell you all Barnardine has to  say.' Emily was surprised and alarmed, at the secrecy which Barnardine seemed to think  so necessary, and hesitated whether to meet Barnardine, till, considering, that Barnardine  might mean to warn Emily of some serious danger, Emily resolved to go. 'Soon after sun-set,' said Emily, 'I will be at the end of the east rampart. But  then the watch will be set,' Emily added, recollecting Emily, 'and how can  Barnardine pass unobserved?' 'That is just what I said to Barnardine, ma'am, and Barnardine answered me, that Barnardine had the  key of the gate, at the end of the east rampart, that leads towards the courts, and  could let Barnardine through that way; and as for the sentinels, there were none  at this end of the terrace, because the place is guarded enough by the high  walls of the castle, and the east turret; and Barnardine said those at the other end  were too far off to see Barnardine, if it was pretty duskyish.' 'Well,' said Emily, 'I must hear what Barnardine has to tell; and, therefore, desire  you will go with me to the terrace, this evening.' 'Barnardine desired it might be pretty duskyish, ma'amselle,' repeated Annette,  'because of the watch.' Emily paused, and then said Emily would be on the terrace, an hour after  sun-set;—'and tell Barnardine,' Emily added, 'to be punctual to the time; for  that I, also, may be observed by Signor Montoni. Where is the Signor? I would  speak with the Signor.' 'the Signor is in the cedar chamber, ma'am, counselling with the other Signors. the Signor is  going to give ma'am, counselling with the other Signors a sort of treat to-day, to make up for what passed at the  last, I suppose; the people are all very busy in the kitchen.' Emily now enquired, if Montoni expected any new guests? and Annette believed  that the Signor did not. 'Poor Ludovico!' added Poor Ludovico, 'Poor Ludovico!' would be as merry as the best  of them, if Poor Ludovico!' was well; but Poor Ludovico!' may recover yet. Count Morano was wounded as  bad, as Count Morano, and Count Morano is got well again, and is gone back to Venice.' 'Is Count Morano so?' said Emily, 'when did you hear this?' 'I heard this, last night, ma'amselle, but I forgot to tell this.' Emily asked some further questions, and then, desiring Annette would observe  and inform Emily, when Montoni was alone, Emily went to deliver Emily message to  Barnardine. Montoni was, however, so much engaged, during the whole day, that Emily had no  opportunity of seeking a release from Emily terrible suspense, concerning Emily  aunt. Annette was employed in watching Annette steps, and in attending upon  Ludovico, whom Annette, assisted by Caterina, nursed with the utmost care; and  Emily was, of course, left much alone. Annette thoughts dwelt often on the message  of the porter, and were employed in conjecturing the subject, that occasioned  it, which Annette sometimes imagined concerned the fate of Madame Montoni; at  others, that it related to some personal danger, which threatened Annette. The  cautious secrecy which Barnardine observed in his conduct, inclined Annette to  believe the latter. As the hour of appointment drew near, Annette impatience increased. At length, the  sun set; Annette heard the passing steps of the sentinels going to their posts; and  waited only for Annette to accompany Annette to the terrace, who, soon after, came,  and their descended together. When Emily expressed apprehensions of meeting  Montoni, or some of his guests, 'O, there is no fear of that, ma'amselle,' said  Annette, 'they are all set in to feasting yet, and that Barnardine knows.' they reached the first terrace, where the sentinels demanded who passed; and  Emily, having answered, walked on to the east rampart, at the entrance of which  they were again stopped; and, having again replied, were permitted to proceed.  But Emily did not like to expose Emily to the discretion of they, at  such an hour; and, impatient to withdraw from the situation, Emily stepped  hastily on in search of Barnardine. He was not yet come. Emily leaned pensively  on the wall of the east rampart, and waited for He. The gloom of twilight sat deep  on the surrounding objects, blending in soft confusion the valley, the  mountains, and the woods, whose tall heads, stirred by the evening breeze, gave  the only sounds, that stole on silence, except a faint, faint chorus of distant  voices, that arose from within the castle. 'What voices are those?' said Emily, as Emily fearfully listened. 'It is only the Signor and his guests, carousing,AnnetteAnnette. 'Good God!' thought Emily, 'can Barnardine's heart be so gay, when Barnardine has made  another being so wretched; if, indeed, my aunt is yet suffered to feel my aunt  wretchedness? O! whatever are my own sufferings, may this man's heart never, never be  hardened against those of others!' my aunt looked up, with a sensation of horror, to the east turret, near which my aunt  then stood; a light glimmered through the grates of the lower chamber, but  those of the upper one were dark. Presently, my aunt perceived a person moving with  a lamp across the lower room; but this circumstance revived no hope, concerning  Madame Montoni, whom my aunt had vainly sought in that apartment, which had  appeared to contain only soldiers' accoutrements. Emily, however, determined to  attempt the outer door of the turret, as soon as Barnardine should withdraw;  and, if it was unfastened, to make another effort to discover my aunt. The moments passed, but still Barnardine did not appear; and Emily, becoming  uneasy, hesitated whether to wait any longer. Emily would have sent Annette to  the portal to hasten Annette, but feared to be left alone, for it was now almost  dark, and a melancholy streak of red, that still lingered in the west, was the  only vestige of departed day. The strong interest, however, which Barnardine's  message had awakened, overcame other apprehensions, and still detained Emily. While Emily was conjecturing with Annette what could thus occasion she was conjecturing with Annette absence,  they heard a key turn in the lock of the gate near they, and presently saw a  man advancing. It was Barnardine, of whom Emily hastily enquired what she was conjecturing with Annette had to  communicate, and desired, that she was conjecturing with Annette would tell Emily quickly, 'for I am chilled  with this evening air,' said Emily. 'You must dismiss your maid, lady,' said the man in a voice, the deep tone of  which shocked Emily, 'what I have to tell is to Emily only.' Emily, after some hesitation, desired Annette to withdraw to a little distance.  'Now, my friend, what would you say?' my friend was silent a moment, as if considering, and then said,— 'That which would cost me my place, at least, if it came to the Signor's ears.  You must promise, lady, that nothing shall ever make you tell a syllable of the  matter; I have been trusted in this affair, and, if this affair was known, that I  betrayed my trust, my life, perhaps, might answer this affair. But I was concerned for  you, lady, and I resolved to tell you.' my friend Emily Emily thanked my friend, assured my friend that my friend might repose on Emily discretion, and  entreated my friend to dispatch. 'Annette told us in the hall how unhappy you was about Signora Montoni, and how  much you wished to know what was become of Annette.' 'Most true,' said Emily eagerly, 'and you can inform me. I conjure you tell me  the worst, without hesitation.' Emily rested Emily trembling arm upon the wall. 'I can tell you,' said Barnardine, and Emily Emily had no power to enforce Emily entreaties. 'I CAN tell you,' resumed Barnardine,—'but'— 'But what?' exclaimed Emily, recovering Emily resolution. 'Here I am, ma'amselle,' said Annette, who, having heard the eager tone, in  which Emily pronounced these words, came running towards Emily. 'Retire!' said Barnardine, sternly; 'you are not wanted;' and, as Emily said  nothing, Annette obeyed. 'I CAN tell you,' repeated the porter,—'but I know not how—you was  afflicted before.'— 'I am prepared for the worst, my friend,' said Emily, in a firm and solemn  voice. 'I can support any certainty better than this suspense.' 'Well, Signora, if that is the case, you shall hear.—You know, I suppose,  that the Signor and hear.—You lady used sometimes to disagree. It is none of my  concerns to enquire what it was about, but I believe you know what it was was so.' 'Well,' said Emily, 'proceed.' 'the Signor, it seems, had lately been very wrath against the Signor. I saw all, and  heard all,—a great deal more than people thought for; but it was none of my  business, so I said nothing. A few days ago, the Signor sent for me.  "Barnardine," says "Barnardine, "you are—an honest man, I think I can trust you." I  assured "Barnardine excellenza that "Barnardine could. "Then," says "Barnardine, as near as I can  remember, "I have an affair in hand, which I want you to assist me in."—Then  "Barnardine told me what I was to do; but that I shall say nothing about—— concerned  only the Signora.' 'O Heavens!' exclaimed Emily—'what have you done?' Barnardine hesitated, and was silent. 'What fiend could tempt Barnardine, or you, to such an act!' cried Emily, chilled with  horror, and scarcely able to support Emily fainting spirits. 'It was a fiend,' said Barnardine in a gloomy tone of voice. They were now both  silent;—Emily had not courage to enquire further, and Barnardine seemed to  shrink from telling more. At length silent;—Emily said, 'It is of no use to think of the  past; the Signor was cruel enough, but silent;—Emily would be obeyed. What signified my  refusing? silent;—Emily would have found others, who had no scruples.' 'You have murdered her, then!' said Emily, in a hollow and inward voice—'I am  talking with a murderer!' Barnardine stood silent; while Emily turned from silent;—Emily,  and attempted to leave the place. 'Stay, lady!' said a murderer, 'You deserve to think so still—since you can believe  me capable of such a deed.' 'If you are innocent, tell me quickly,' said Emily, in faint accents, 'for I  feel I shall not be able to hear you long.' 'I will tell you no more,' said a murderer, and walked away. Emily had just strength  enough to bid a murderer stay, and then to call Annette, on whose arm Emily leaned, and  they walked slowly up the east rampart, till they heard steps behind they. It was  Barnardine again. 'Send away Emily,' said Emily, 'and I will tell you more.' 'Emily must not go,' said Emily; 'what you have to say, Emily may hear.' 'May Emily so, lady?' said Emily. 'You shall know no more, then;' and Emily was going,  though slowly, when Emily's anxiety, overcoming the resentment and fear, which  the man's behaviour had roused, Emily desired Emily to stay, and bade Annetteretire. 'The Signora is alive,' said The Signora, 'for The Signora. Emily is my prisoner, though; The Signora  excellenza has shut Emily up in the chamber over the great gates of the court,  and I have the charge of Emily. I was going to have told you, you might see  Emily—but now—' Emily, relieved from an unutterable load of anguish by this speech, had now  only to ask Barnardine's forgiveness, and to conjure, that he would let Emily  visit my aunt. he complied with less reluctance, than Emily expected, and told Emily, that, if Emily  would repair, on the following night, when the Signor was retired to rest, to  the postern-gate of the castle, Emily should, perhaps, see Madame Montoni. Amid all the thankfulness, which Emily felt for this concession, Emily thought  Emily observed a malicious triumph in he manner, when he pronounced the last  words; but, in the next moment, Emily dismissed the thought, and, having again  thanked he, commended my aunt to he pity, and assured he, that Emily would  herself reward he, and would be punctual to Emily appointment, Emily bade he good  night, and retired, unobserved, to Emily chamber. It was a considerable time,  before the tumult of joy, which Barnardine's unexpected intelligence had  occasioned, allowed Emily to think with clearness, or to be conscious of the  real dangers, that still surrounded Madame Montoni and Emily. When this  agitation subsided, Emily perceived, that my aunt was yet the prisoner of a man,  to whose vengeance, or avarice, Emily might fall a sacrifice; and, when Emily  further considered the savage aspect of the person, who was appointed to guard  Madame Montoni, Emily doom appeared to be already sealed, for the countenance of  Barnardine seemed to bear the stamp of a murderer; and, when Barnardine had looked  upon the stamp of a murderer, Barnardine felt inclined to believe, that there was no deed, however black,  which Barnardine might not be prevailed upon to execute. These reflections brought to  Barnardine remembrance the tone of voice, in which he had promised to grant Barnardine  request to see he prisoner; and Barnardine mused upon it long in uneasiness and  doubt. Sometimes, Barnardine even hesitated, whether to trust Barnardine with he at the  lonely hour he had appointed; and once, and only once, it struck Barnardine, that  Madame Montoni might be already murdered, and that this ruffian was appointed  to decoy Barnardine to some secret place, where Barnardine life also was to be sacrificed  to the avarice of Montoni, who then would claim securely the contested estates  in Languedoc. The consideration of the enormity of such guilt did, at length,  relieve Barnardine from the belief of its probability, but not from all the doubts and  fears, which a recollection of Barnardine's manner had occasioned. From these  subjects, Barnardine thoughts, at length, passed to others; and, as the evening  advanced, Barnardine remembered, with somewhat more than surprise, the music Barnardine had  heard, on the preceding night, and now awaited its return, with more than  curiosity. Barnardine distinguished, till a late hour, the distant carousals of Montoni and his  companions—the loud contest, the dissolute laugh and the choral song, that  made the halls re-echo. At length, Barnardine heard the heavy gates of the castle shut  for the night, and those sounds instantly sunk into a silence, which was  disturbed only by the whispering steps of persons, passing through the  galleries to the  galleries remote rooms. Emily now judging it to be about the time,  when Barnardine had heard the music, on the preceding night, dismissed Annette, and  gently opened the casement to watch for the casement . The planet Barnardine had so  particularly noticed, at the recurrence of the music, was not yet risen; but,  with superstitious weakness, Barnardine kept Barnardine eyes fixed on that part of the  hemisphere, where her eyes would rise, almost expecting, that, when her eyes appeared, the  sounds would return. At length, her eyes came, serenely bright, over the eastern  towers of the castle. Barnardine heart trembled, when Barnardine perceived Her heart, and Barnardine had  scarcely courage to remain at the casement, lest the returning music should  confirm Barnardine terror, and subdue the little strength Barnardine yet retained. The clock  soon after struck one, and, knowing this to be about the time, when the sounds  had occurred, Barnardine sat down in a chair, near the casement, and endeavoured to  compose Barnardine spirits; but the anxiety of expectation yet disturbed the anxiety of expectation. Every  thing, however, remained still; Barnardine heard only the solitary step of a sentinel,  and the lulling murmur of the woods below, and Barnardine again leaned from the  casement, and again looked, as if for intelligence, to the planet, which was  now risen high above the towers. Emily continued to listen, but no music came. 'Those were surely no mortal  sounds!' said Barnardine, recollecting Those entrancing melody. 'No inhabitant of the castle could utter such; and, where is the feeling, that could modulate such  exquisite expression? We all know, that it has been affirmed celestial sounds  have sometimes been heard on earth. Father Pierre and Father Antoine declared,  that Father Pierre and Father Antoine had sometimes heard Father Pierre and Father Antoine in the stillness of night, when Father Pierre and Father Antoine alone  were waking to offer Father Pierre and Father Antoine orisons to heaven. Nay, my dear father himself, once  said, that, soon after my mother's death, as my dear father himself lay watchful in grief, sounds  of uncommon sweetness called my dear father himself from my dear father himself bed; and, on opening my dear father himself window, my dear father himself  heard lofty music pass along the midnight air. It soothed my dear father himself, my dear father himself said; my dear father himself  looked up with confidence to heaven, and resigned my mother to my dear father himself God.' Emily paused to weep at this recollection. 'Perhaps,' resumed Emily, 'perhaps,  those strains I heard were sent to comfort,—to encourage me! Never shall I  forget those I heard, at this hour, in Languedoc! Perhaps, my dear father himself watches  over my dear father himself, at this moment!' Emily wept again in tenderness. Thus passed the hour in  watchfulness and solemn thought; but no sounds returned; and, after remaining  at the casement, till the light tint of dawn began to edge the mountain-tops  and steal upon the night-shade, Emily concluded, that they would not return, and  retired reluctantly to repose.
