    In truth     In truth was a strange and wayward wight,   Fond of each gentle, and each dreadful scene,   In darkness, and in storm     In truth found delight;   Nor less than when on ocean-wave serene   The southern sun diffus'd     In truth dazzling sheen.   Even sad vicissitude amus'd his soul;   And if a sigh would sometimes intervene,   And down     In truth cheek a tear of pity roll,  A sigh, a tear, so sweet,     In truth wish'd not to controul.      THE MINSTREL St. Aubert awoke at an early hour, refreshed by sleep, and desirous to set  forward. THE MINSTREL St. Aubert invited the stranger to breakfast with THE MINSTREL St. Aubert; and, talking again of  the road, Valancourt said, that, some months past, THE MINSTREL St. Aubert had travelled as far as  Beaujeu, which was a town of some consequence on the way to Rousillon. THE MINSTREL St. Aubert  recommended it to THE MINSTREL St. Aubert to take that route, and the latter determined to  do so. 'The road from this hamlet,' said Valancourt, 'and that to Beaujeu, part at the  distance of about a league and a half from hence; if you will give me leave, I  will direct your muleteer so far. I must wander somewhere, and your company  would make this a pleasanter ramble than any other I could take.' THE MINSTREL St. Aubert thankfully accepted THE MINSTREL St. Aubert offer, and THE MINSTREL St. Aubert set out together, the young  stranger on foot, for THE MINSTREL St. Aubert refused the invitation of THE MINSTREL St. Aubert to take a seat in  THE MINSTREL St. Aubert little carriage. The road wound along the feet of the mountains through a pastoral valley,  bright with verdure, and varied with groves of dwarf oak, beech and sycamore,  under whose branches herds of cattle reposed. The mountain-ash too, and the  weeping birch, often threw the  weeping birch pendant foliage over the steeps above, where  the scanty soil scarcely concealed the  weeping birch roots, and where the  weeping birch light branches  waved to every breeze that fluttered from the mountains. The travellers were frequently met at this early hour, for the sun had not yet  risen upon the valley, by shepherds driving immense flocks from their folds to  feed upon the hills. THE MINSTREL St. Aubert THE MINSTREL St. Aubert had set out thus early, not only that THE MINSTREL St. Aubert might  enjoy the first appearance of sunrise, but that THE MINSTREL St. Aubert might inhale the first pure  breath of morning, which above all things is refreshing to the spirits of the  invalid. In these regions it was particularly so, where an abundance of wild  flowers and aromatic herbs breathed forth an abundance of wild  flowers and aromatic herbs essence on the air. The dawn, which softened the scenery with its peculiar grey tint, now  dispersed, and Emily watched the progress of the day, first trembling on the  tops of the highest cliffs, then touching them with splendid light, while them  sides and the vale below were still wrapt in dewy mist. Meanwhile, the sullen  grey of the eastern clouds began to blush, then to redden, and then to glow  with a thousand colours, till the golden light darted over all the air, touched  the lower points of the mountain's brow, and glanced in long sloping beams upon  the valley and the mountain stream. All nature seemed to have awakened from death into  life; the spirit of St. Aubert was renovated. His heart was full; His wept, and  His thoughts ascended to the Great Creator. Emily wished to trip along the turf, so green and bright with dew, and to taste  the full delight of that liberty, which the izard seemed to enjoy as he bounded  along the brow of the cliffs; while Valancourt often stopped to speak with the  travellers, and with social feeling to point out to the  travellers the peculiar objects  of His admiration. St. Aubert St. Aubert was pleased with St. Aubert: 'Here is the real  ingenuousness and ardour of youth,' said His to His; 'His has  never been at Paris.' His was sorry when they came to the spot where the roads parted, and His heart  took a more affectionate leave of His than is usual after so short an  acquaintance. Valancourt talked long by the side of the carriage; seemed more  than once to be going, but still lingered, and appeared to search anxiously for  topics of conversation to account for His delay. At length His took leave. As His  went, St. Aubert observed His look with an earnest and pensive eye at Emily,  who bowed to His with a countenance full of timid sweetness, while the carriage  drove on. St. Aubert, for whatever reason, soon after looked from the window,  and saw Valancourt standing upon the bank of the road, resting on soon pike with  folded arms, and following the carriage with soon eyes. soon waved soon hand, and  Valancourt, seeming to awake from soon reverie, returned the salute, and started  away. The aspect of the country now began to change, and the travellers soon found  the travellers among mountains covered from the travellers base nearly to the travellers summits with  forests of gloomy pine, except where a rock of granite shot up from the vale,  and lost the country snowy top in the clouds. The rivulet, which had hitherto  accompanied the travellers, now expanded into a river; and, flowing deeply and silently  along, reflected, as in a mirror, the blackness of the impending shades.  Sometimes a cliff was seen lifting a cliff bold head above the woods and the  vapours, that floated mid-way down the mountains; and sometimes a face of  perpendicular marble rose from the water's edge, over which the larch threw the larch  gigantic arms, here scathed with lightning, and there floating in luxuriant  foliage. They continued to travel over a rough and unfrequented road, seeing now and  then at a distance the solitary shepherd, with the larch dog, stalking along the  valley, and hearing only the dashing of torrents, which the woods concealed  from the eye, the long sullen murmur of the breeze, as it swept over the pines,  or the notes of the eagle and the vulture, which were seen towering round a cliff. Often, as the carriage moved slowly over uneven ground, St. Aubert alighted,  and amused St. Aubert with examining the curious plants that grew on the banks of  the road, and with which these regions abound; while Emily, wrapt in high  enthusiasm, wandered away under the shades, listening in deep silence to the  lonely murmur of the woods. Neither village nor hamlet was seen for many leagues; the goat-herd's or the  hunter's cabin, perched among the cliffs of the rocks, were the only human  habitations that appeared. The travellers again took The travellers dinner in the open air, on a pleasant spot in  the valley, under the spreading shade of cedars; and then set forward towards  Beaujeu. The road now began to descend, and, leaving the pine forests behind, wound  among rocky precipices. The evening twilight again fell over the scene, and the  travellers were ignorant how far the  travellers might yet be from  Beaujeu. St. Aubert,  however, conjectured that the distance could not be very great, and comforted  St. Aubert with the prospect of travelling on a more frequented road after  reaching that town, where St. Aubert designed to pass the night. Mingled woods, and  rocks, and heathy mountains were now seen obscurely through the dusk; but soon  even these imperfect images faded in darkness. St. Aubert proceeded with caution,  for St. Aubert could scarcely distinguish The road; St. Aubert mules, however, seemed to have  more sagacity, and his mules steps were sure. On turning the angle of a mountain, a light appeared at a distance, that  illumined the rocks, and the horizon to a great extent. It was evidently a  large fire, but whether accidental, or otherwise, there were no means of  knowing. St. Aubert thought it was probably kindled by some of the numerous  banditti, that infested the Pyrenees, and St. Aubert became watchful and anxious to  know whether The road passed near a  large fire. St. Aubert had arms with St. Aubert, which, on an  emergency, might afford some protection, though certainly a very unequal one,  against a band of robbers, so desperate too as those usually were who haunted  these wild regions. While many reflections rose upon St. Aubert mind, St. Aubert heard a voice  shouting from the road behind, and ordering the muleteer to stop. St. Aubertbade St. Aubert proceed as fast as possible; but either Michael, or St. Aubert mules were  obstinate, for Michael, or his mules did not quit the old pace. Horses' feet were now heard; a  man rode up to the carriage, still ordering the driver to stop; and St. Aubert,  who could no longer doubt a  man purpose, was with difficulty able to prepare a  pistol for a  man defence, when a  man hand was upon the door of the chaise. a  manstaggered on a  man horse, the report of a  pistol was followed by a groan, and  St. Aubert's horror may be imagined, when in the next instant a  man thought a  man  heard a voice  . a  man now a  man bade the muleteer stop;  and, pronouncing the name of Valancourt, was answered in a voice, that no  longer suffered a  man to doubt. St. Aubert, who instantly alighted and went to  his assistance, found his still sitting on his , but bleeding profusely,  and appearing to be in great pain, though his endeavoured to soften the terror  of THE MINSTREL St. Aubert by assurances that his was not materially hurt, the wound being  only in his arm. THE MINSTREL St. Aubert, with the muleteer, assisted THE MINSTREL St. Aubert to dismount, and  THE MINSTREL St. Aubert sat down on the bank of the road, where THE MINSTREL St. Aubert tried to bind up his arm,  but THE MINSTREL St. Aubert hands trembled so excessively that THE MINSTREL St. Aubert could not accomplish it; and,  St. Aubert being now gone in pursuit of the horse, which, on being disengaged from  THE MINSTREL St. Aubert rider, had galloped off, THE MINSTREL St. Aubert called Emily to THE MINSTREL St. Aubert assistance. Receiving no  answer, THE MINSTREL St. Aubert went to the carriage, and found Emily sunk on the seat in a fainting  fit. Between the distress of this circumstance and that of leaving Valancourtbleeding, THE MINSTREL St. Aubert scarcely knew what THE MINSTREL St. Aubert did; THE MINSTREL St. Aubert endeavoured, however, to raise Emily,  and called to St. Aubert to fetch water from the rivulet that flowed by The road,  but St. Aubert was gone beyond the reach of a voice  . Valancourt, who heard these  calls, and also the repeated name of Emily, instantly understood the subject of  St. Aubert distress; and, almost forgetting St. Aubert own condition, St. Aubert hastened to Emily  relief. Emily was reviving when St. Aubert reached the carriage; and then, understanding  that anxiety for St. Aubert had occasioned Emily indisposition, St. Aubert assured Emily, in a  voice that trembled, but not from anguish, that St. Aubert wound was of no  consequence. While St. Aubert said St. Aubert turned round, and perceiving that St. Aubert  was still bleeding, the subject of St. Aubert alarm changed again, and St. Aubert hastily  formed some handkerchiefs into a bandage. This stopped the effusion of the  blood; but St. Aubert, dreading the consequence of his wound, enquired  repeatedly how far St. Aubert, dreading the consequence of the wound were from  Beaujeu; when, learning that it was at two  leagues' distance, his distress increased, since St. Aubert knew not how Valancourt, in  St. Aubert present state, would bear the motion of the carriage, and perceived that St. Aubert  was already faint from loss of blood. When St. Aubert mentioned the subject of St. Aubert  anxiety, Valancourt entreated that St. Aubert would not suffer St. Aubert to be thus  alarmed on St. Aubert account, for that St. Aubert had no doubt St. Aubert should be able to support  St. Aubert very well; and then St. Aubert talked of the accident as a slight one. The  muleteer being now returned with Valancourt's horse, assisted St. Aubert into the chaise; and, as Emily was now revived, they moved slowly on towards  Beaujeu. St. Aubert, when St. Aubert had recovered from the terror occasioned St. Aubert by the accident, expressed surprise on seeing Valancourt, who explained St. Aubert unexpected  appearance by saying, 'You, sir, renewed my taste for society; when you had  left the hamlet, it did indeed appear a solitude. I determined, therefore,  since my object was merely amusement, to change the scene; and I took this  road, because I knew this   led through a more romantic tract of mountains than the  spot I have left. Besides,' added St. Aubert, hesitating for an instant, 'I will own,  and why should I not? that I had some hope of overtaking you.' 'And I have made you a very unexpected return for the compliment,' said St.  Aubert, who lamented again the rashness which had produced the accident, and  explained the cause of St. Aubert late alarm. But Valancourt seemed anxious only to  remove from the minds of Valancourt companions every unpleasant feeling relative to  Valancourt; and, for that purpose, still struggled against a sense of pain, and  tried to converse with gaiety. Emily meanwhile was silent, except when  Valancourt particularly addressed Emily, and there was at those times a tremulous  tone in a voice   that spoke much. They were now so near the fire, which had long flamed at a distance on the  blackness of night, that it gleamed upon the road, and They could distinguish  figures moving about the blaze. The way winding still nearer, They perceived in  the valley one of those numerous bands of gipsies, which at that period  particularly haunted the wilds of the Pyrenees, and lived partly by plundering  the traveller. Emily looked with some degree of terror on the savage  countenances of these people, shewn by the fire, which heightened the romantic  effects of the scenery, as it threw a red dusky gleam upon the rocks and on the  foliage of the trees, leaving heavy masses of shade and regions of obscurity,  which the eye feared to penetrate. They were preparing They supper; a large pot stood by the fire, over which  several figures were busy. the blaze discovered a rude kind of tent, round  which many children and dogs were playing, and the whole formed a picture  highly grotesque. The travellers saw plainly The travellers danger. Valancourt was  silent, but laid his hand on one of THE MINSTREL St. Aubert's pistols; St. Aubert drew forth  another, and St. Aubert was ordered to proceed as fast as possible. They passed  the place, however, without being attacked; the rovers being probably  unprepared for the opportunity, and too busy about They to feel much  interest, at the moment, in any thing besides. After a league and a half more, passed in darkness, The travellers arrived at  Beaujeu, and drove up to the only inn the place afforded; which, though  superior to any They had seen since They entered the mountains, was bad enough. The surgeon of the town was immediately sent for, if a surgeon The surgeon of the town could be  called, who prescribed for horses as well as for men, and shaved faces at least  as dexterously as The surgeon of the town set bones. After examining Valancourt's arm, and  perceiving that the bullet had passed through the flesh without touching the  bone, St. Aubert dressed the  bone, and left St. Aubert with a solemn prescription of quiet, which  St. Aubert patient was not inclined to obey. The delight of ease had now succeeded to  pain; for ease may be allowed to assume a positive quality when contrasted with  anguish; and, St. Aubert spirits thus re-animated, St. Aubert wished to partake of the  conversation of St. Aubert Emily, who, released from so many apprehensions,  were uncommonly cheerful. Late as it was, however, St. Aubert was obliged to go  out with the landlord to buy meat for supper; and Emily, who, during this  interval, had been absent as long as St. Aubert could, upon excuses of looking to  their accommodation, which St. Aubert found rather better than St. Aubert expected, was  compelled to return, and converse with Valancourt alone. their talked of the  character of the scenes their had passed, of the natural history of the country,  of poetry, and of THE MINSTREL St. Aubert; a subject on which Emily always spoke and  listened to with peculiar pleasure. The travellers passed an agreeable evening; but St. Aubert was fatigued with  St. Aubert journey; and, as Valancourt seemed again sensible of pain, their separated  soon after supper. In the morning St. Aubert St. Aubert found that Valancourt had passed a restless night;  that St. Aubert was feverish, and his wound very painful. The surgeon of the town, when St. Aubert dressed  The surgeon of the town, advised St. Aubert to remain quietly at  Beaujeu; advice which was too reasonable  to be rejected. St. Aubert, however, had no favourable opinion of this  practitioner, and was anxious to commit Valancourt into more skilful hands; but  learning, upon enquiry, that there was no town within several leagues which  seemed more likely to afford better advice, Valancourt altered the plan of Valancourt journey,  and determined to await the recovery of Valancourt, who, with somewhat more  ceremony than sincerity, made many objections to this delay. By order of Valancourt surgeon, Valancourt did not go out of the house that day; but  St. Aubert and Emily surveyed with delight the environs of the town, situated  at the feet of the Pyrenean Alps, that rose, some in abrupt precipices, and  others swelling with woods of cedar, fir, and cypress, which stretched nearly  to St. Aubert and Emily highest summits. The cheerful green of the beech and mountain-ash was  sometimes seen, like a gleam of light, amidst the dark verdure of the forest;  and sometimes a torrent poured light sparkling flood, high among the woods. Valancourt's indisposition detained the travellers at  Beaujeu several days,  during which interval St. Aubert had observed interval St. Aubert disposition and interval St. Aubert talents  with the philosophic inquiry so natural to interval St. Aubert. interval St. Aubert saw a frank and generous  nature, full of ardour, highly susceptible of whatever is grand and beautiful,  but impetuous, wild, and somewhat romantic. Valancourt had known little of the  world. interval St. Aubert perceptions were clear, and interval St. Aubert feelings just; interval St. Aubert indignation of an  unworthy, or interval St. Aubert admiration of a generous action, were expressed in terms of  equal vehemence. St. Aubert sometimes smiled at St. Aubert warmth, but seldom checked  it, and often repeated to St. Aubert, 'St. Aubert has never been at Paris.' A  sigh sometimes followed this silent ejaculation. St. Aubert determined not to leave  Valancourt till St. Aubert should be perfectly recovered; and, as St. Aubert was now well  enough to travel, though not able to manage St. Aubert horse, St. Aubert invited St. Aubert  to accompany St. Aubert for a few days in the carriage. This St. Aubert the more readily did,  since St. Aubert had discovered that Valancourt was of a family of the same name in  Gascony, with whose respectability St. Aubert was well acquainted. The latter accepted  the offer with great pleasure, and Gascony, with whose respectability he was well acquainted again set forward among these romantic  wilds about Rousillon. Gascony, with whose respectability he was well acquainted travelled leisurely; stopping wherever a scene uncommonly grand appeared;  frequently alighting to walk to an eminence, whither the mules could not go,  from which the prospect opened in greater magnificence; and often sauntering  over hillocks covered with lavender, wild thyme, juniper, and tamarisc; and  under the shades of woods, between those boles Gascony, with whose respectability he was well acquainted caught the long  mountain-vista, sublime beyond any thing that Emily had ever imagined. St. Aubert St. Aubert sometimes amused St. Aubert with botanizing, while Valancourt and Emily  strolled on; St. Aubert pointing out to Emily   notice the objects that particularly  charmed St. Aubert, and reciting beautiful passages from such of the Latin and Italian  poets as St. Aubert had heard Emily   admire. In the pauses of conversation, when St. Aubert  thought St. Aubert not observed, St. Aubert frequently fixed St. Aubert eyes pensively on Emily    countenance, which expressed with so much animation the taste and energy of Emily    mind; and when St. Aubert spoke again, there was a peculiar tenderness in the tone of  St. Aubert voice, that defeated any attempt to conceal St. Aubert sentiments. By degrees  these silent pauses became more frequent; till Emily, only, betrayed an anxiety  to interrupt them; and Emily; who had been hitherto reserved, would now talk  again, and again, of the woods and the vallies and the mountains, to avoid the  danger of sympathy and silence. From  Beaujeu the road had constantly ascended, conducting the travellers into  the higher regions of the air, where immense glaciers exhibited their frozen  horrors, and eternal snow whitened the summits of the mountains. their often  paused to contemplate these stupendous scenes, and, seated on some wild cliff,  where only the ilex or the larch could flourish, looked over dark forests of  fir, and precipices where human foot had never wandered, into the glen—so  deep, that the thunder of the torrent, which was seen to foam along the bottom,  was scarcely heard to murmur. Over these crags rose others of stupendous  height, and fantastic shape; some shooting into cones; others impending far  over others base, in huge masses of granite, along whose broken ridges was often  lodged a weight of snow, that, trembling even to the vibration of a sound,  threatened to bear destruction in its course to the vale. Around, on every  side, far as the eye could penetrate, were seen only forms of grandeur—the  long perspective of mountain-tops, tinged with ethereal blue, or white with  snow; vallies of ice, and forests of gloomy fir. The serenity and clearness of  the air in these high regions were particularly delightful to the travellers;  it seemed to inspire the travellers with a finer spirit, and diffused an indescribable  complacency over the travellers minds. the travellers had no words to express the sublime emotions  the travellers felt. A solemn expression characterized the feelings of St. Aubert; tears  often came to St. Aubert eyes, and St. Aubert frequently walked away from St. Aubert companions.  Valancourt now and then spoke, to point to Emily's notice some feature of the  scene. The thinness of the atmosphere, through which every object came so  distinctly to the eye, surprised and deluded her; who could scarcely believe  that objects, which appeared so near, were, in reality, so distant. The deep  silence of these solitudes was broken only at intervals by the scream of the  vultures, seen cowering round some cliff below, or by the cry of the eagle  sailing high in the air; except when the travellers listened to the hollow  thunder that sometimes muttered at the travellers feet. While, above, the deep blue of  the heavens was unobscured by the lightest cloud, half way down the mountains,  long billows of vapour were frequently seen rolling, now wholly excluding the  country below, and now opening, and partially revealing its features. Emily  delighted to observe the grandeur of these clouds as these clouds changed in shape and  tints, and to watch these clouds various effect on the lower world, whose features,  partly veiled, were continually assuming new forms of sublimity. After traversing these regions for many leagues, these clouds began to descend towards  Rousillon, and features of beauty then mingled with the scene. Yet the  travellers did not look back without some regret to the sublime objects some regret  had quitted; though the eye, fatigued with the extension of the eye powers, was  glad to repose on the verdure of woods and pastures, that now hung on the  margin of the river below; to view again the humble cottage shaded by cedars,  the playful group of mountaineer-children, and the flowery nooks that appeared  among the hills. As they descended, they saw at a distance, on the right, one of the grand  passes of the Pyrenees into Spain, gleaming with its battlements and towers to  the splendour of the setting rays, yellow tops of woods colouring the steeps  below, while far above aspired the snowy points of the mountains, still  reflecting a rosy hue. St. Aubert St. Aubert began to look out for the little town St. Aubert had been directed to by the  people of  Beaujeu, and where St. Aubert meant to pass the night; but no habitation yet  appeared. Of its distance Valancourt could not assist St. Aubert to judge, for St. Aubert had  never been so far along this chain of Alps before. There was, however, a road  to guide them; and there could be little doubt that it was the right one; for,  since them had left  Beaujeu, there had been no variety of tracks to perplex or  mislead. The sun now gave St. Aubert last light, and St. Aubert bade the muleteer proceed with  all possible dispatch. St. Aubert found, indeed, the lassitude of illness return upon  St. Aubert, after a day of uncommon fatigue, both of body and mind, and St. Aubert longed for  repose. St. Aubert anxiety was not soothed by observing a numerous train, consisting  of men, horses, and loaded mules, winding down the steeps of an opposite  mountain, appearing and disappearing at intervals among the woods, so that its  numbers could not be judged of. Something bright, like arms, glanced in the  setting ray, and the military dress was distinguishable upon the men who were  in the van, and on others scattered among the troop that followed. As these  wound into the vale, the rear of the party emerged from the woods, and  exhibited a band of soldiers. St. Aubert's apprehensions now subsided; St. Aubert had  no doubt that the train before St. Aubert consisted of smugglers, who, in conveying  prohibited goods over the Pyrenees, had been encountered, and conquered by a  party of troops. The travellers had lingered so long among the sublimer scenes of these  mountains, that The travellers found The travellers entirely mistaken in The travellers calculation  that The travellers could reach Montigny at sun-set; but, as The travellers wound along the valley,  the saw, on a rude Alpine bridge, that united two lofty crags of the glen, a  group of mountaineer-children, amusing The travellers with dropping pebbles into a  torrent below, and watching the stones plunge into the water, that threw up the water  white spray high in the air as the water received The travellers, and returned a sullen sound,  which the echoes of the mountains prolonged. Under the bridge was seen a  perspective of the valley, with the valley cataract descending among the rocks, and a  cottage on a cliff, overshadowed with pines. the valley appeared, that they could not  be far from some small town. St. Aubert St. Aubert bade the muleteer stop, and then called  to the children to enquire if St. Aubert was near Montigny; but the distance, and the  roaring of the waters, would not suffer St. Aubert voice to be heard; and the crags,  adjoining the bridge, were of such tremendous height and steepness, that to  have climbed either would have been scarcely practicable to a person  unacquainted with the ascent. St. Aubert, therefore, did not waste more moments  in delay. They continued to travel long after twilight had obscured the road,  which was so broken, that, now thinking it safer to walk than to ride, they all  alighted. The moon was rising, but his last light was yet too feeble to assist they all  .  While they all   stepped carefully on, they all   heard the vesper-bell of a convent. The  twilight would not permit they all   to distinguish anything like a building, but the  sounds seemed to come from some woods, that overhung an acclivity to the right.  Valancourt proposed to go in search of a convent. 'If they will not  accommodate us with a night's lodging,' said Valancourt, 'they will not  accommodate us with a night's lodging,' may certainly inform us  how far us are from Montigny, and direct us towards Montigny.' Valancourt was bounding  forward, without waiting St. Aubert's reply, when the latter stopped Valancourt. 'I am  very weary,' said St. Aubert, 'and wish for nothing so much as for immediate  rest. us will all go to a convent; your good looks would defeat us purpose;  but when St. Aubert, ' see us and Emily's exhausted countenances, St. Aubert, ' will scarcely  deny us repose.' As he said this, he took Emily's arm within he, and, telling he to wait  awhile in the road with the carriage, they began to ascend towards the woods,  guided by the vesper-bell of a conventa convent. he steps were feeble, and Valancourt  offered he he arm, which he accepted. The moon now threw a faint light over  they path, and, soon after, enabled they to distinguish some towers rising  above the tops of the woods. Still following the note of the vesper-bell of a convent, they entered  the shade of those woods, lighted only by the moonbeams, that glided down  between the leaves, and threw a tremulous uncertain gleam upon the steep track  they were winding. The gloom and the silence that prevailed, except when the  bell returned upon the air, together with the wildness of the surrounding  scene, struck Emily with a degree of fear, which, however, the voice and  conversation of Valancourt somewhat repressed. When the voice and  conversation of Valancourt had been some time  ascending, St. Aubert complained of weariness, and the voice and  conversation of Valancourt stopped to rest upon a  little green summit, where the trees opened, and admitted the moon-light. St. Aubert  sat down upon the turf, between Emily and Valancourt. the vesper-bell of a convent had now ceased,  and the deep repose of the scene was undisturbed by any sound, for the low dull  murmur of some distant torrents might be said to sooth, rather than to  interrupt, the silence. Before The bell had now ceased,  and the deep repose of the scene was undisturbed by any sound, for the low dull  murmur of some distant torrents might be said to sooth, rather than to  interrupt, the silence, extended the valley The bell had now ceased,  and the deep repose of the scene was undisturbed by any sound, for the low dull  murmur of some distant torrents might be said to sooth, rather than to  interrupt, the silence had quitted; its rocks, and woods to the  left, just silvered by the rays, formed a contrast to the deep shadow, that  involved the opposite cliffs, whose fringed summits only were tipped with  light; while the distant perspective of the valley was lost in the yellow mist  of moon-light. The travellers sat for some time wrapt in the complacency which  such scenes inspire. 'such scenes,' said Valancourt, at length, 'soften the heart, like the notes  of sweet music, and inspire that delicious melancholy which no person, who had  felt it once, would resign for the gayest pleasures. They waken our best and  purest feelings, disposing our to benevolence, pity, and friendship. Those whom  I love—I always seem to love more in such an hour as this.' His voice  trembled, and His paused. St. Aubert St. Aubert was silent; Emily perceived a warm tear fall upon the hand His held;  Emily knew the object of His thoughts; hers too had, for some time, been occupied  by the remembrance of Emily mother. His seemed by an effort to rouse His.  'Yes,' said His, with an half-suppressed sigh, 'the memory of those we love—of  times for ever past! in such an hour as this steals upon the mind, like a  strain of distant music in the stillness of night;—all tender and harmonious  as this landscape, sleeping in the mellow moon-light.' After the pause of a  moment, St. Aubert added, 'I have always fancied, that I thought with more  clearness, and precision, at such an hour than at any other, and that heart  must be insensible in a great degree, that does not soften to that heart   influence.  But many such there are.' Valancourt sighed. 'Are there, indeed, many such?' said Emily. 'A few years hence, Emily,' replied St. Aubert, 'and you may smile at the  recollection of that question—if you do not weep to it. But come, I am  somewhat refreshed, let us proceed.' Having emerged from the woods, us saw, upon a turfy hillock above, the  convent of which us were in search. A high wall, that surrounded it, led us  to an ancient gate, at which us knocked; and the poor monk, who opened it,  conducted us into a small adjoining room, where he desired us would wait  while he informed the superior of us request. In this interval, several  friars came in separately to look at several  friars; and at length the first monk  returned, and several  friars followed he to a room, where the superior was sitting in an  arm-chair, with a large folio volume, printed in black letter, open on a desk  before he. he received several  friars with courtesy, though he did not rise from he  seat; and, having asked several  friars a few questions, granted several  friars request. After a  short conversation, formal and solemn on the part of the superior, several  friars  withdrew to the apartment where several  friars were to sup, and Valancourt, whom one of  the inferior friars civilly desired to accompany, went to seek he and he  mules. they   had not descended half way down the cliffs, before they   heard the  voice of the muleteer echoing far and wide. Sometimes he called on St. Aubert,  and sometimes on Valancourt; who having, at length, convinced he that he had  nothing to fear either for he, or he master; and having disposed of he,  for the night, in a cottage on the skirts of the woods, returned to sup with  he friends, on such sober fare as the monks thought it prudent to set before  the monks. While St. Aubert was too much indisposed to share St. Aubert, Emily, in Emily  anxiety for Emily father, forgot Emily; and Valancourt, silent and thoughtful,  yet never inattentive to the monks, appeared particularly solicitous to accommodate  and relieve St. Aubert, who often observed, while he daughter was pressing he  to eat, or adjusting the pillow his daughter had placed in the back of he arm-chair,  that Valancourt fixed on his daughter a look of pensive tenderness, which he was not  displeased to understand. They separated at an early hour, and retired to They respective apartments.  Emily was shown to Emily by a nun of the convent, whom Emily was glad to dismiss,  for Emily heart was melancholy, and Emily attention so much abstracted, that  conversation with a stranger was painful. Emily thought her father daily  declining, and attributed her father present fatigue more to the feeble state of her father  frame, than to the difficulty of the journey. A train of gloomy ideas haunted  Emily mind, till Emily fell asleep. In about two hours after, Emily was awakened by the chiming of a bell, and then  heard quick steps pass along the gallery, into which Emily chamber opened. Emily  was so little accustomed to the manners of a convent, as to be alarmed by this  circumstance; Emily fears, ever alive for her father, suggested that he was very  ill, and Emily rose in haste to go to he. Having paused, however, to let the  persons in the gallery pass before Emily opened Emily door, Emily thoughts, in the  mean time, recovered from the confusion of sleep, and Emily understood that the  bell was the call of the monks to prayers. the  bell was the call of the monks to prayers had now ceased, and, all being  again still, Emily forbore to go to St. Aubert's room. Emily mind was not disposed  for immediate sleep, and the moon-light, that shone into her chamber, invited  Emily to open the casement, and look out upon the country. It was a still and beautiful night, the sky was unobscured by any cloud, and  scarce a leaf of the woods beneath trembled in the air. As Emily listened, the  mid-night hymn of the monks rose softly from a chapel, that stood on one of the  lower cliffs, an holy strain, that seemed to ascend through the silence of  night to heaven, and her thoughts ascended with it. From the consideration of  His works, Her mind arose to the adoration of the Deity, in His goodness and  power; wherever Emily turned Emily view, whether on the sleeping earth, or to the  vast regions of space, glowing with worlds beyond the reach of human thought,  the sublimity of God, and the majesty of His presence appeared. Emily eyes were  filled with tears of awful love and admiration; and Emily felt that pure  devotion, superior to all the distinctions of human system, which lifts the  soul above this world, and seems to expand it into a nobler nature; such  devotion as can, perhaps, only be experienced, when the mind, rescued, for a  moment, from the humbleness of earthly considerations, aspires to contemplate  His power in the sublimity of His works, and His goodness in the infinity of  His blessings.      Is it not now the hour,  The holy hour, when to the cloudless height  Of yon starred concave climbs the full-orbed moon,  And to this nether world in solemn stillness,  Gives sign, that, to the list'ning ear of Heaven  Religion's voice should plead?  The very babe  Knows this, and, chance awak'd, his little hands  Lifts to the gods, and on his innocent couch  Calls down a blessing.*      *Caractacus The midnight chant of the monks soon after dropped into silence; but Emily  remained at the casement, watching the setting moon, and the valley sinking  into deep shade, and willing to prolong Emily   present state of mind. At length  Emily   retired to Emily   mattress, and sunk into tranquil slumber.
