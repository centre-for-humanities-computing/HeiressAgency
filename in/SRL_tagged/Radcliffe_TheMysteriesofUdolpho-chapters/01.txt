      home is the resort
 Of love, of joy, of peace and plenty, where,
 Supporting and supported, polish'd friends
 And dear relations mingle into bliss.*
      *Thomson
On the pleasant banks of the Garonne, in the province of Gascony, stood, in the 
year 1584, the chateau of Monsieur St. Aubert. From its windows were seen the 
pastoral landscapes of Guienne and Gascony stretching along the river, gay with 
luxuriant woods and vine, and plantations of olives. To the south, the view was 
bounded by the majestic Pyrenees, whose summits, veiled in clouds, or 
exhibiting awful forms, seen, and lost again, as the partial vapours rolled 
along, were sometimes barren, and gleamed through the blue tinge of air, and 
sometimes frowned with forests of gloomy pine, that swept downward to their 
base. These tremendous precipices were contrasted by the soft green of the 
pastures and woods that hung upon their skirts; among whose flocks, and herds, 
and simple cottages, the eye, after having scaled the cliffs above, delighted 
to repose. To the north, and to the east, the plains of Guienne and Languedoc 
were lost in the mist of distance; on the west, Gascony was bounded by the 
waters of Biscay.
