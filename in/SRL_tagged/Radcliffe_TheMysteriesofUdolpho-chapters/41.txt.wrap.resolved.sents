      As when a wave, that from a cloud impends,  And, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends,  White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud,  Howl o'er the masts, and sing through ev'ry shroud:  Pale, trembling, tir'd, the sailors freeze with fears,  And instant death on ev'ry wave appears.
POPE'S HOMER The Lady Blanche, meanwhile, who was left much alone, became impatient for the  company of The Lady Blanche new friend, whom The Lady Blanche wished to observe sharing in the delight  The Lady Blanche received from the beautiful scenery around.
The Lady Blanche had now no person, to whom  The Lady Blanche could express The Lady Blanche admiration and communicate The Lady Blanche pleasures, no eye, that  sparkled to The Lady Blanche smile, or countenance, that reflected The Lady Blanche happiness; and The Lady Blanche  became spiritless and pensive.
The Count, observing The Lady Blanche dissatisfaction,  readily yielded to The Lady Blanche entreaties, and reminded Emily of Emily promised visit;  but the silence of Valancourt, which was now prolonged far beyond the period,  when a letter might have arrived from Estuviere, oppressed Emily with severe  anxiety, and, rendering Emily averse to society, Emily would willingly have  deferred Emily acceptance of this invitation, till Emily spirits should be  relieved.
The Count and his family, however, pressed to see Emily; and, as the  circumstances, that prompted Emily wish for solitude, could not be explained,  there was an appearance of caprice in Emily refusal, which Emily could not  persevere in, without offending the friends, whose esteem Emily valued.
At  length, therefore, Emily returned upon a second visit to Chateau-le-Blanc.
Here  the friendly manner of Count De Villefort encouraged Emily to mention to Count De Villefort  Emily situation, respecting the estates of Emily late aunt, and to consult Count De Villefort on  the means of recovering them.
Count De Villefort had little doubt, that the law would decide in  Emily favour, and, advising Emily to apply to it, offered first to write to an  advocate at Avignon, on whose opinion Count De Villefort thought Count De Villefort could rely.
Count De Villefort kindness  was gratefully accepted by Emily, who, soothed by the courtesy Emily daily  experienced, would have been once more happy, could Emily have been assured of  Valancourt's welfare and unaltered affection.
Emily had now been above a week at  the chateau, without receiving intelligence of Count De Villefort, and, though Emily knew, that,  if Count De Villefort was absent from Count De Villefort brother's residence, it was scarcely probable Emily  letter had yet reached Count De Villefort, Emily could not forbear to admit doubts and fears,  that destroyed Emily peace.
Again Emily would consider of all, that might have  happened in the long period, since Emily first seclusion at Udolpho, and Emily mind  was sometimes so overwhelmed with an apprehension, that Valancourt was no more,  or that Valancourt lived no longer for Emily, that the company even of Blanche became  intolerably oppressive, and Emily would sit alone in Emily apartment for hours  together, when the engagements of the family allowed Emily to do so, without  incivility.
In one of these solitary hours, Emily unlocked a little box, which contained some  letters of Valancourt, with some drawings Emily had sketched, during Emily stay in  Tuscany, the latter of which were no longer interesting to Emily; but, in the  letters, Emily now, with melancholy indulgence, meant to retrace the tenderness,  that had so often soothed Emily, and rendered Emily, for a moment, insensible of  the distance, which separated Emily from the writer.
But their effect was now  changed; the affection their expressed appealed so forcibly to Emily heart, when  Emily considered that it had, perhaps, yielded to the powers of time and absence,  and even the view of the hand-writing recalled so many painful recollections,  that Emily found Emily unable to go through the first Emily had opened, and sat  musing, with Emily cheek resting on Emily arm, and tears stealing from Emily eyes,  when old Dorothee entered the room to inform Emily, that dinner would be ready,  an hour before the usual time.
Emily started on perceiving Emily, and hastily put  up the papers, but not before old Dorothee had observed both Emily agitation and Emily  tears.
'Ah, ma'amselle!'
said Emily, 'you, who are so young,—have you reason for  sorrow?'
Emily tried to smile, but was unable to speak.
'Alas!
Emily, when you come to my age, you will not weep at trifles;  and surely you have nothing serious, to grieve you.'
'No, Dorothee, nothing of any consequence,' replied Emily.
old Dorothee, now  stooping to pick up something, that had dropped from among the papers, suddenly  exclaimed, 'Holy Mary!
what is it I see?'
and then, trembling, sat down in a  chair, that stood by the table.
'What is it you do see?'
said Emily, alarmed by Emily manner, and looking round  the room.
'It is Emily,' said old Dorothee, 'Emily very self!
just as Emily looked a little  before Emily died!'
Emily, still more alarmed, began now to fear, that old Dorothee was seized with  sudden phrensy, but entreated Emily to explain Emily.
'That picture!'
said Emily, 'where did you find That picture, Emily?
That picture is my blessed  mistress herself!'
Emily laid on the table the miniature, which Emily had long ago found among the  papers Emily father had enjoined Emily to destroy, and over which Emily had once seen  her father shed such tender and affecting tears; and, recollecting all the various  circumstances of her father conduct, that had long perplexed Emily, Emily emotions  increased to an excess, which deprived Emily of all power to ask the questions  Emily trembled to have answered, and Emily could only enquire, whether old Dorothee was  certain the picture resembled the late marchioness.
'O, ma'amselle!'
said Emily, 'how came it to strike me so, the instant I saw it,  if it was not my lady's likeness?
Ah!'
added Emily, taking up the miniature,  'these are Emily own blue eyes—looking so sweet and so mild; and there is Emily  very look, such as I have often seen it, when Emily had sat thinking for a long  while, and then, the tears would often steal down Emily cheeks—but Emily never  would complain!
It was that look so meek, as it were, and resigned, that used  to break my heart and make me love Emily so!'
'old Dorothee!'
said Emily solemnly, 'I am interested in the cause of that grief,  more so, perhaps, than you may imagine; and I entreat, that you will no longer  refuse to indulge my curiosity;—it is not a common one.'
As Emily said this, Emily remembered the papers, with which the picture had been  found, and had scarcely a doubt, that they had concerned the Marchioness de  Villeroi; but with this supposition came a scruple, whether Emily ought to  enquire further on a subject, which might prove to be the same, that Emily father  had so carefully endeavoured to conceal.
Emily curiosity, concerning the  Marchioness, powerful as it was, it is probable Emily would now have resisted, as  Emily had formerly done, on unwarily observing the few terrible words in the  papers, which had never since been erased from Emily memory, had Emily been certain  that the history of Emily was the subject of those papers, or, that such  simple particulars only as it was probable Dorothee could relate were included  in Emily father's command.
What was known to Emily could be no secret to many other  persons; and, since it appeared very unlikely, that St. Aubert should attempt  to conceal what Emily might learn by ordinary means, Emily at length concluded,  that, if the papers had related to the story of the Marchioness, it was not  those circumstances of it, which Dorothee could disclose, that Dorothee had thought  sufficiently important to wish to have concealed.
Emily, therefore, no longer  hesitated to make the enquiries, that might lead to the gratification of Emily  curiosity.
'Ah, ma'amselle!'
said Dorothee, 'it is a sad story, and cannot be told now:  but what am I saying?
I never will tell it.
Many years have passed, since it  happened; and I never loved to talk of the Marchioness to any body, but my  husband.
my  husband lived in the family, at that time, as well as my  husband, and my  husband knew  many particulars from my  husband, which nobody else did; for I was about the person of  my lady in  my lady last illness, and saw and heard as much, or more than my lord  my  husband.
Sweet saint!
how patient  my lady was!
When  my lady died, I thought I could  have died with  my lady!'
'Dorothee,' said  my lady, interrupting  my lady, 'what you shall tell, you may depend  upon it, shall never be disclosed by  my lady.
I have, I repeat it, particular  reasons for wishing to be informed on this subject, and am willing to bind   my lady, in the most solemn manner, never to mention what you shall wish me to  conceal.'
Dorothee seemed surprised at the earnestness of  my lady's manner, and, after  regarding  my lady for some moments, in silence, said, 'Emily!
that look of  yours pleads for you—it is so like my dear mistress's, that I can almost  fancy I see  my lady before  my lady; if you were  my lady daughter, you could not remind me of   my lady more.
But dinner will be ready—had you not better go down?'
'You will first promise to grant my request,' said  my lady.
'And ought not you first to tell me, ma'amselle, how this picture fell into  your hands, and the reasons you say you have for curiosity about my lady?'
'Why, no, Dorothee,' replied  my lady, recollecting my lady, 'I have also  particular reasons for observing silence, on these subjects, at least, till I  know further; and, remember, I do not promise ever to speak upon these subjects;  therefore, do not let me induce you to satisfy my curiosity, from an  expectation, that I shall gratify yours.
What I may judge proper to conceal,  does not concern  my lady alone, or I should have less scruple in revealing less scruple:  let a confidence in my honour alone persuade you to disclose what I request.'
'Well, lady!'
replied Dorothee, after a long pause, during which Dorothee eyes were  fixed upon Emily, 'you seem so much interested,—and this picture and that  face of yours make me think you have some reason to be so,—that I will trust  you—and tell some things, that I never told before to any body, but my  husband, though there are people, who have suspected as much.
I will tell you  the particulars of my lady's death, too, and some of my own suspicions; but you  must first promise me by all the saints'— Emily, interrupting Emily, solemnly promised never to reveal what should be  confided to Emily, without Dorothee's consent.
'But there is the horn, ma'amselle, sounding for dinner,' said Dorothee; 'I  must be gone.'
'When shall I see you again?'
enquired Emily.
Dorothee mused, and then replied, 'Why, madam, it may make people curious, if  it is known I am so much in your apartment, and that I should be sorry for; so  I will come when I am least likely to be observed.
I have little leisure in the  day, and I shall have a good deal to say; so, if you please, ma'am, I will  come, when the family are all in bed.'
'That will suit me very well,' replied Emily: 'Remember, then, to-night'— 'Aye, that is well remembered,' said Dorothee, 'I fear I cannot come to-night,  madam, for there will be the dance of the vintage, and it will be late, before  the servants go to rest; for, when the servants once set in to dance, the servants will keep it  up, in the cool of the air, till morning; at least, it used to be so in my  time.'
'Ah!
is it the dance of the vintage?'
said  my lady, with a deep sigh,  remembering, that it was on the evening of this festival, in the preceding  year, that St. Aubert and St. Aubert had arrived in the neighbourhood of  Chateau-le-Blanc.
St. Aubert paused a moment, overcome by the sudden recollection, and  then, recovering St. Aubert, added—'But this dance is in the open woods; you,  therefore, will not be wanted, and can easily come to St.
Aubert.'
Dorothee replied, that Dorothee had been accustomed to be present at the dance of  the vintage, and Dorothee did not wish to be absent now; 'but if I can get away,  madam, I will,' said Dorothee.
Emily then hastened to the dining-room, where the Count conducted the Count with  the courtesy, which is inseparable from true dignity, and of which the Countess  frequently practised little, though Dorothee manner to Emily was an exception to Emily  usual habit.
But, if Dorothee retained few of the ornamental virtues, Dorothee cherished  other qualities, which Dorothee seemed to consider invaluable.
Dorothee had dismissed the  grace of modesty, but then Dorothee knew perfectly well how to manage the stare of  assurance; Dorothee manners had little of the tempered sweetness, which is necessary  to render the female character interesting, but Dorothee could occasionally throw  into them an affectation of spirits, which seemed to triumph over every person,  who approached Dorothee.
In the country, however, Dorothee generally affected an elegant  languor, that persuaded Dorothee almost to faint, when Dorothee favourite read to Dorothee a  story of fictitious sorrow; but Dorothee countenance suffered no change, when living  objects of distress solicited Dorothee charity, and Dorothee heart beat with no transport  to the thought of giving no transport   instant relief;—she was a stranger to the  highest luxury, of which, perhaps, the human mind can be sensible, for Dorothee  benevolence had never yet called smiles upon the face of misery.
In the evening, the Count, with all his family, except the Countess and  Mademoiselle Bearn, went to the woods to witness the festivity of the peasants.
The scene was in a glade, where the trees, opening, formed a circle round the  turf they highly overshadowed; between they branches, vines, loaded with ripe  clusters, were hung in gay festoons; and, beneath, were tables, with fruit,  wine, cheese and other rural fare,—and seats for the Count and his family.
At  a little distance, were benches for the elder peasants, few of whom, however,  could forbear to join the jocund dance, which began soon after sun-set, when  several of sixty tripped it with almost as much glee and airy lightness, as  those of sixteen.
The musicians, who sat carelessly on the grass, at the foot of a tree, seemed  inspired by the sound of The musicians, who sat carelessly on the grass, at the foot of a tree own instruments, which were chiefly flutes and a  kind of long guitar.
Behind, stood a boy, flourishing a tamborine, and dancing  a solo, except that, as he sometimes gaily tossed the instrument, he tripped  among the other dancers, when he antic gestures called forth a broader laugh,  and heightened the rustic spirit of The scene.
the Count was highly delighted with the happiness the Count witnessed, to which the Count  bounty had largely contributed, and the Lady Blanche joined the dance with a  young gentleman of the Lady Blanche 's party.
Du Pont requested Emily's hand, but Du Pont  spirits were too much depressed, to permit Du Pont to engage in the present  festivity, which called to Du Pont remembrance that of the preceding year, when St.  St. Aubert was living, and of the melancholy scenes, which had immediately followed  it.
Overcome by these recollections, St. Aubert, at length, left the spot, and walked  slowly into the woods, where the softened music, floating at a distance,  soothed St. Aubert melancholy mind.
The moon threw a mellow light among the foliage;  the air was balmy and cool, and  my lady, lost in thought, strolled on, without  observing whither, till  my lady perceived the sounds sinking afar off, and an awful  stillness round  my lady, except that, sometimes, the nightingale beguiled the  silence with      Liquid notes, that close the eye of day.
At length, St. Aubert found St. Aubert near the avenue, which, on the night of St. Aubert  father's arrival, Michael had attempted to pass in search of a house, which was  still nearly as wild and desolate as it had then appeared; for the Count had  been so much engaged in directing other improvements, that Michael had neglected to  give orders, concerning this extensive approach, and the road was yet broken,  and the trees overloaded with their own luxuriance.
As St. Aubert stood surveying it, and remembering the emotions, which St. Aubert had formerly  suffered there, St. Aubert suddenly recollected the figure, that had been seen  stealing among the trees, and which had returned no answer to Michael's  repeated calls; and St. Aubert experienced somewhat of the fear, that had then  assailed St. Aubert, for it did not appear improbable, that these deep woods were  occasionally the haunt of banditti.
St. Aubert, therefore, turned back, and was  hastily pursuing St. Aubert way to the dancers, when St. Aubert heard steps approaching from  the avenue; and, being still beyond the call of the peasants on the green, for  St. Aubert could neither hear the peasants voices, or the peasants music, St. Aubert quickened St. Aubert pace;  but the persons following gained fast upon St. Aubert, and, at length, distinguishing  the voice of Henri, St. Aubert walked leisurely, till Henri came up.
Henri expressed some  surprise at meeting St. Aubert so far from the company; and, on St. Aubert saying, that the  pleasant moon-light had beguiled St. Aubert to walk farther than St. Aubert intended, an  exclamation burst from the lips of Henri companion, and St. Aubert thought St. Aubert heard  Valancourt speak!
It was, indeed, Henri!
and the meeting was such as may be  imagined, between persons so affectionate, and so long separated as persons had  been.
In the joy of these moments,  my lady forgot all  my lady past sufferings, and  Valancourt seemed to have forgotten, that any person but  my lady existed; while  Henri was a silent and astonished spectator of The scene.
Valancourt asked a thousand questions, concerning Valancourt and Montoni, which  there was now no time to answer; but Valancourt learned, that Valancourt letter had been  forwarded to Valancourt, at Paris, which Valancourt had previously quitted, and was returning  to Gascony, whither the letter also returned, which, at length, informed Valancourt of  Emily's arrival, and on the receipt of which Valancourt had immediately set out for  Languedoc.
On reaching the monastery, whence Valancourt had dated her letter, Valancourt  found, to Valancourt extreme disappointment, that the gates were already closed for  the night; and believing, that Valancourt should not see  my lady, till the morrow, Valancourt was  returning to Valancourt little inn, with the intention of writing to Valancourt, when Valancourt was  overtaken by Henri, with whom Valancourt had been intimate at Paris, and was led to  Valancourt, whom Valancourt was secretly lamenting that Valancourt should not see, till the following  day.
Emily, with Valancourt and Henri, now returned to the green, where the latter  presented Valancourt to the Count, who, Valancourt fancied, received Valancourt with less  than Valancourt usual benignity, though it appeared, that they were not strangers to  each other.
Valancourt was invited, however, to partake of the diversions of the  evening; and, when Valancourt had paid Valancourt respects to the Count, and while the dancers  continued the dancers   festivity, Valancourt seated Valancourt by  my lady, and conversed, without  restraint.
The lights, which were hung among the trees, under which they sat,  allowed Valancourt a more perfect view of the countenance Valancourt had so frequently in  absence endeavoured to recollect, and Valancourt perceived, with some regret, that it  was not the same as when last Valancourt saw it.
There was all it wonted intelligence  and fire; but it had lost much of the simplicity, and somewhat of the open  benevolence, that used to characterise it.
Still, however, it was an  interesting countenance; but  my lady thought  my lady perceived, at intervals, anxiety  contract, and melancholy fix the features of Valancourt; sometimes, too, Valancourt  fell into a momentary musing, and then appeared anxious to dissipate thought;  while, at others, as Valancourt fixed Valancourt eyes on  my lady, a kind of sudden distraction  seemed to cross Valancourt mind.
In  my lady Valancourt perceived the same goodness and beautiful  simplicity, that had charmed Valancourt, on their first acquaintance.
The bloom of  my lady  countenance was somewhat faded, but all her   sweetness remained, and her   was  rendered more interesting, than ever, by the faint expression of melancholy,  that sometimes mingled with  my lady smile.
At Valancourt request,  my lady related the most important circumstances, that had occurred  to  my lady, since  my lady left France, and emotions of pity and indignation alternately  prevailed in Valancourt mind, when Valancourt heard how much  my lady had suffered from the villany  of Montoni.
More than once, when  my lady was speaking of Valancourt conduct, of which the  guilt was rather softened, than exaggerated, by  my lady representation, Valancourt started  from Valancourt seat, and walked away, apparently overcome as much by self accusation  as by resentment.
my lady sufferings alone were mentioned in the few words, which  Valancourt could address to  my lady, and Valancourt listened not to the account, which  my lady was  careful to give as distinctly as possible, of the present loss of Madame  Montoni's estates, and of the little reason there was to expect their  restoration.
At length, Valancourt remained lost in thought, and then some  secret cause seemed to overcome Valancourt with anguish.
Again Valancourt abruptly left  my lady.
When Valancourt returned,  my lady perceived, that Valancourt had been weeping, and tenderly begged,  that Valancourt would compose Valancourt.
'My sufferings are all passed now,' said  my lady,  'for I have escaped from the tyranny of Montoni, and I see you well—let me  also see you happy.'
Valancourt was more agitated, than before.
'I am unworthy of you,  my lady,' said  Valancourt, 'I am unworthy of you;'—words, by Valancourt manner of uttering which  my lady was  then more shocked than by their import.
my lady fixed on Valancourt a mournful and  enquiring eye.
'Do not look thus on me,' said Valancourt, turning away and pressing  my lady  hand; 'I cannot bear those looks.'
'I would ask,' said  my lady, in a gentle, but agitated voice, 'the meaning of  your words; but I perceive, that the question would distress you now.
Let us  talk on other subjects.
To-morrow, perhaps, you may be more composed.
Observe  those moon light woods, and the towers, which appear obscurely in the  perspective.
You used to be a great admirer of landscape, and I have heard you  say, that the faculty of deriving consolation, under misfortune, from the  sublime prospects, which neither oppression, or poverty with-hold from us, was  the peculiar blessing of the innocent.'
Valancourt was deeply affected.
'Yes,'  replied Valancourt, 'I had once a taste for innocent and elegant delights—I had once  an uncorrupted heart.'
Then, checking Valancourt, Valancourt added, 'Do you remember us  journey together in the Pyrenees?'
'Can I forget our  journey together in the Pyrenees?'
said Emily.—'Would that I could!'
Valancourt replied;—'that was  the happiest period of my life.
I then loved, with enthusiasm, whatever was  truly great, or good.'
It was some time before  my lady could repress  my lady tears,  and try to command  my lady emotions.
'If you wish to forget our  journey together in the Pyrenees,' said   my lady, 'it must certainly be my wish to forget it also.'
my lady paused, and then  added, 'You make me very uneasy; but this is not the time for further  enquiry;—yet, how can I bear to believe, even for a moment, that you are less  worthy of my esteem than formerly?
I have still sufficient confidence in your  candour, to believe, that, when I shall ask for an explanation, you will give  an explanation me.
'—'Yes,' said Valancourt, 'yes,  my lady: I have not yet lost my candour:  if I had, I could better have disguised my emotions, on learning what were your  sufferings—your virtues, while I—I—but I will say no more.
I did not mean  to have said even so much—I have been surprised into the self-accusation.
Tell me,  my lady, that you will not forget that journey—will not wish to forget  it, and I will be calm.
I would not lose the remembrance of it for the whole  earth.'
'How contradictory is this!'
said Emily;—'but we may be overheard.
My  recollection of it shall depend upon yours; I will endeavour to forget, or to  recollect it, as you may do.
Let we join the Count.
'—'Tell me first,' said  Valancourt, 'that you forgive the uneasiness I have occasioned you, this  evening, and that you will still love me.
'—'I sincerely forgive you,' replied   my lady.
'You best know whether I shall continue to love you, for you know  whether you deserve my esteem.
At present, I will believe that you do.
It is  unnecessary to say,' added  my lady, observing his dejection, 'how much pain his dejection  would give me to believe otherwise.—The young lady, who approaches, is the  Count's daughter.'
Valancourt and  my lady now joined the Lady Blanche; and the party, soon after,  sat down with the Count, his son, and the Chevalier Du Pont, at a banquet,  spread under a gay awning, beneath the trees.
At the table also were seated  several of the most venerable of the Count's tenants, and it was a festive  repast to all but Valancourt and  my lady.
When the Count retired to the chateau,  the Count did not invite Valancourt to accompany the Count, who, therefore, took leave of   my lady, and retired to the Count solitary inn for the night: meanwhile,  my lady soon  withdrew to  my lady own apartment, where  my lady mused, with deep anxiety and concern,  on the Count behaviour, and on the Count's reception of the Count.
my lady attention was thus  so wholly engaged, that  my lady forgot Dorothee and  my lady appointment, till morning  was far advanced, when, knowing that the good old woman would not come, the good old woman  retired, for a few hours, to repose.
On the following day, when the Count had accidentally joined  my lady in one of  the walks, they talked of the festival of the preceding evening, and this led  the Count to a mention of Valancourt.
'That is a young man of talents,' said the Count; 'you  were formerly acquainted with the Count, I perceive.'
my lady said, that  my lady was.
'the Count  was introduced to  my lady, at Paris,' said the Count, 'and I was much pleased with  the Count, on our first acquaintance.'
the Count paused, and  my lady trembled, between the  desire of hearing more and the fear of shewing the Count, that  my lady felt an  interest on the subject.
'May I ask,' said the Count, at length, 'how long you have  known Monsieur Valancourt?
'—'Will you allow me to ask your reason for the  question, sir?'
said  my lady; 'and I will answer it immediately.
'—'Certainly,'  said the Count, 'that is but just.
I will tell you my reason.
I cannot but  perceive, that Monsieur Valancourt admires you; in that, however, there is  nothing extraordinary; every person, who sees you, must do the same.
I am above  using common-place compliments; I speak with sincerity.
What I fear, is, that    is a favoured admirer.
'—'Why do you fear it, sir?'
said  my lady,  endeavouring to conceal  my lady emotion.—'Because,' replied the Count, 'I think  the Count not worthy of your favour.'
my lady, greatly agitated, entreated further  explanation.
'I will give it,' said the Count, 'if you will believe, that nothing but  a strong interest in your welfare could induce me to hazard that  assertion.
'—'I must believe so, sir,' replied  my lady.
'But let us rest under these trees,' said the Count, observing the paleness of  her countenance; 'here is a seat—you are fatigued.'
They sat down, and the Count proceeded.
'Many young ladies, circumstanced as you are, would think my  conduct, on this occasion, and on so short an acquaintance, impertinent,  instead of friendly; from what I have observed of your temper and  understanding, I do not fear such a return from you.
Our acquaintance has been  short, but long enough to make me esteem you, and feel a lively interest in  your happiness.
You deserve to be very happy, and I trust that you will be so.'
my lady sighed softly, and bowed  my lady thanks.
the Count paused again.
'I am  unpleasantly circumstanced,' said the Count; 'but an opportunity of rendering you  important service shall overcome inferior considerations.
Will you inform me of  the manner of your first acquaintance with Valancourt, if the  subject is not too painful?'
my lady briefly related the accident of their meeting in the presence of  my lady  father, and then so earnestly entreated the Count not to hesitate in declaring  what the Count knew, that the Count perceived the violent emotion, against which  my lady was  contending, and, regarding  my lady with a look of tender compassion, considered how  the Count might communicate the Count information with least pain to the Count anxious auditor.
'The Chevalier and my son,' said my son, 'were introduced to each other, at the  table of a brother officer, at whose house I also met my son, and invited my son to  my own, whenever my son should be disengaged.
I did not then know, that my son had  formed an acquaintance with a set of men, a disgrace to their species, who live  by plunder and pass their lives in continual debauchery.
I knew several of the  Chevalier's family, resident at Paris, and considered the  Chevalier's family as sufficient  pledges for my son introduction to my own.
But you are ill; I will leave the  subject.
'—'No, sir,' said  my lady, 'I beg you will proceed: I am only  distressed.'—'ONLY!'
said the Count, with emphasis; 'however, I will proceed.
I soon learned, that these, my son associates, had drawn my son into a course of  dissipation, from which my son appeared to have neither the power, nor the  inclination, to extricate my son.
my son lost large sums at the gaming-table; my son  became infatuated with play; and was ruined.
I spoke tenderly of this to my son  friends, who assured me, that they had remonstrated with my son, till they were  weary.
I afterwards learned, that, in consideration of my son talents for play,  which were generally successful, when unopposed by the tricks of  villany,—that in consideration of these, the party had initiated my son into the  secrets of the party trade, and allotted my son a share of the party profits.'
'Impossible!'
said  my lady suddenly; 'but—pardon me, sir, I scarcely know what  I say; allow for the distress of my mind.
I must, indeed, I must believe, that  you have not been truly informed.
the  Chevalier had, doubtless, enemies, who  misrepresented the  Chevalier should be most happy to believe so,' replied the Count, 'but I cannot.
Nothing short of conviction, and a regard for your  happiness, could have urged me to repeat these unpleasant reports.'
my lady was silent.
my lady recollected Valancourt's sayings, on the preceding  evening, which discovered the pangs of self-reproach, and seemed to confirm all  that the Count had related.
Yet  my lady had not fortitude enough to dare  conviction.
my lady heart was overwhelmed with anguish at the mere suspicion of his  guilt, and  my lady could not endure a belief of it.
After a silence, the Countsaid, 'I perceive, and can allow for, your want of conviction.
It is necessary  I should give some proof of what I have asserted; but this I cannot do, without  subjecting one, who is very dear to the Count, to danger.
'—'What is the danger you  apprehend, sir?'
said  my lady; 'if I can prevent it, you may safely confide in my  honour.
'—'On your honour I am certain I can rely,' said the Count; 'but can I  trust your fortitude?
Do you think you can resist the solicitation of a  favoured admirer, when the Count pleads, in affliction, for the name of one, who has  robbed the Count of a blessing?
'—'I shall not be exposed to such a temptation,  sir,' said  my lady, with modest pride, 'for I cannot favour one, whom I must no  longer esteem.
I, however, readily give my word.'
Tears, in the mean time,  contradicted her first assertion; and her felt, that time and effort only could  eradicate an affection, which had been formed on virtuous esteem, and cherished  by habit and difficulty.
'I will trust you then,' said the Count, 'for conviction is necessary to your  peace, and cannot, I perceive, be obtained, without this confidence.
My son has  too often been an eye-witness of the  Chevalier's ill conduct; My son was very near  being drawn in by it; My son was, indeed, drawn in to the commission of many  follies, but I rescued My son from guilt and destruction.
Judge then, Mademoiselle  St. Aubert, whether a father, who had nearly lost his only son by the example  of the  Chevalier, has not, from conviction, reason to warn those, whom his  esteems, against trusting those, whom he  esteems happiness in such hands.
I have myself seen the  Chevalier the  Chevalier engaged in deep play with men, whom I almost shuddered to look upon.
If you still doubt, I will refer you to My son.'
'I must not doubt what you have myself witnessed,' replied  my lady, sinking  with grief, 'or what you assert.
But the  Chevalier the  Chevalier has, perhaps, been drawn  only into a transient folly, which the  Chevalier may never repeat.
If you had known the  justness of the  Chevalier former principles, you would allow for my present incredulity.'
'Alas!'
observed the Count, 'it is difficult to believe that, which will make  us wretched.
But I will not sooth you by flattering and false hopes.
We all  know how fascinating the vice of gaming is, and how difficult the vice of gaming is, also, to  conquer habits; the  Chevalier the  Chevalier might, perhaps, reform for a while, but the  Chevalier would  soon relapse into dissipation—for I fear, not only the bonds of habit would  be powerful, but that the  Chevalier morals are corrupted.
And—why should I conceal from  you, that play is not the  Chevalier only vice?
the  Chevalier appears to have a taste for every  vicious pleasure.'
the Count hesitated and paused; while  my lady endeavoured to support  my lady, as,  with increasing perturbation,  my lady expected what the  Chevalier might further say.
A long  pause of silence ensued, during which the  Chevalier was visibly agitated; at length, the  Chevalier  said, 'It would be a cruel delicacy, that could prevail with he   to be  silent—and I will inform you, that the  Chevalier's extravagance has brought  the  Chevalier twice into the prisons of Paris, from whence the  Chevalier was last extricated, as I  was told upon authority, which I cannot doubt, by a well-known Parisian  Countess, with whom the  Chevalier continued to reside, when I left Paris.'
the  Chevalier paused again; and, looking at  my lady, perceived  my lady countenance change, and  that  my lady was falling from the seat; the  Chevalier caught  my lady, but  my lady had fainted, and the  Chevalier  called loudly for assistance.
They were, however, beyond the hearing of the  Chevalier  servants at the chateau, and the  Chevalier feared to leave  my lady while the  Chevalier went thither for  assistance, yet knew not how otherwise to obtain he went thither for  assistance; till a fountain at no  great distance caught the  Chevalier eye, and the  Chevalier endeavoured to support  my lady against the  tree, under which  my lady had been sitting, while the  Chevalier went thither for water.
But  again the  Chevalier was perplexed, for the  Chevalier had nothing near the  Chevalier, in which water could be  brought; but while, with increased anxiety, the  Chevalier watched  my lady, the  Chevalier thought the  Chevalier  perceived in  my lady countenance symptoms of returning life.
It was long, however, before  my lady revived, and then  my lady found  my lady  supported—not by the Count, but by Valancourt, who was observing  my lady with  looks of earnest apprehension, and who now spoke to  my lady in a tone, tremulous  with the  Chevalier anxiety.
At the sound of the  Chevalier well-known voice,  my lady raised  my lady eyes,  but presently closed them, and a faintness again came over  my lady.
the Count, with a look somewhat stern, waved the Count to withdraw; but the Count only  sighed heavily, and called on the name of  my lady, as the Count again held the water,  that had been brought, to  my lady lips.
On the Count's repeating the Count action, and  accompanying it with words, Valancourt answered the Count with a look of deep  resentment, and refused to leave the place, till  my lady should revive, or to  resign  my lady for a moment to the care of any person.
In the next instant, the Count  conscience seemed to inform the Count of what had been the subject of the Count's  conversation with  my lady, and indignation flashed in the Count eyes; but it was  quickly repressed, and succeeded by an expression of serious anguish, that  induced the Count to regard the Count with more pity than resentment, and the view of  which so much affected Emily, when Emily again revived, that Emily yielded to the  weakness of tears.
But Emily soon restrained them, and, exerting Emily resolution  to appear recovered, Emily rose, thanked the Count and Henri, with whom  Valancourt had entered the garden, for whom   care, and moved towards the chateau, without noticing Valancourt, who, heart-struck by Emily manner,  exclaimed in a low voice—'Good God!
how have I deserved this?—what has been  said, to occasion this change?'
my lady, without replying, but with increased emotion, quickened  my lady steps.
'What  has thus disordered you,  my lady?'
said he, as he still walked by  my lady side: 'give  me a few moments' conversation, I entreat you;—I am very miserable!'
Though this was spoken in a low voice, it was overheard by the Count, who  immediately replied, that Mademoiselle St. Aubert was then too much indisposed,  to attend to any conversation, but that Mademoiselle St. Aubert would venture to promise Mademoiselle St. Aubert would  see Monsieur Valancourt on the morrow, if Mademoiselle St. Aubert was better.
Valancourt's cheek was crimsoned: Valancourt looked haughtily at the Count, and then at  Emily, with successive expressions of surprise, grief and supplication, which  Mademoiselle St. Aubert could neither misunderstand, or resist, and Mademoiselle St. Aubert said languidly—'I shall  be better tomorrow, and if you wish to accept the Count's PERMISSION, I will  see you then.'
'See me!'
exclaimed Valancourt, as Valancourt threw a glance of mingled pride and  resentment upon the Count; and then, seeming to recollect Valancourt, Valancourt  added—'But I will come, madam; I will accept the Count's PERMISSION.'
When they reached the door of the chateau, Valancourt lingered a moment, for Valancourt  resentment was now fled; and then, with a look so expressive of tenderness and  grief, that  my lady's heart was not proof against it, Valancourt bade  my lady good morning,  and, bowing slightly to the Count, disappeared.
my lady withdrew to  my lady own apartment, under such oppression of heart as  my lady had  seldom known, when  my lady endeavoured to recollect all that the Count had told, to  examine the probability of the circumstances he himself believed, and to  consider of  my lady future conduct towards Valancourt.
But, when  my lady attempted to  think,  my lady mind refused controul, and  my lady could only feel that  my lady was  miserable.
One moment,  my lady sunk under the conviction, that Valancourt was no  longer the same, whom  my lady had so tenderly loved, the idea of whom had hitherto  supported  my lady under affliction, and cheered  my lady with the hope of happier  days,—but a fallen, a worthless character, whom  my lady must teach  my lady to  despise—if  my lady could not forget.
Then, unable to endure this terrible  supposition,  my lady rejected this terrible  supposition, and disdained to believe him capable of conduct,  such as the Count had described, to whom  my lady believed him had been  misrepresented by some artful enemy; and there were moments, when  my lady even  ventured to doubt the integrity of the Count, and to suspect, that him  was influenced by some selfish motive, to break  my lady connection with Valancourt.
But this was the error of an instant, only; the Count's character, which  my lady  had heard spoken of by Du Pont and many other persons, and had  my lady  observed, enabled  my lady to judge, and forbade the supposition; had  my lady  confidence, indeed, been less, there appeared to be no temptation to betray him  into conduct so treacherous, and so cruel.
Nor did reflection suffer  my lady to  preserve the hope, that Valancourt had been mis-represented to the Count, who  had said, that him spoke chiefly from him own observation, and from him son's  experience.
my lady must part from Valancourt, therefore, for ever—for what of  either happiness or tranquillity could  my lady expect with a man, whose tastes were  degenerated into low inclinations, and to whom vice was become habitual?
whom   my lady must no longer esteem, though the remembrance of what vice once was, and the  long habit of loving vice, would render it very difficult for  my lady to despise  vice.
'O Valancourt!'
my lady would exclaim, 'having been separated so long—do we  meet, only to be miserable—only to part for ever?'
Amidst all the tumult of  my lady mind,  my lady remembered pertinaciously the seeming  candour and simplicity of vice conduct, on the preceding night; and, had  my lady  dared to trust  my lady own heart, it would have led  my lady to hope much from this.
Still  my lady could not resolve to dismiss vice for ever, without obtaining further  proof of vice ill conduct; yet  my lady saw no probability of procuring it, if,  indeed, proof more positive was possible.
Something, however, it was necessary  to decide upon, and  my lady almost determined to be guided in  my lady opinion solely by  the manner, with which Valancourt should receive  my lady hints concerning Valancourt late  conduct.
Thus passed the hours till dinner-time, when  my lady, struggling against the  pressure of  my lady grief, dried  my lady tears, and joined the family at table, where  the Count preserved towards  my lady the most delicate attention; but the Countess  and Mademoiselle Bearn, having looked, for a moment, with surprise, on  my lady  dejected countenance, began, as usual, to talk of trifles, while the eyes of  Lady Blanche asked much of  Lady Blanche friend, who could only reply by a mournful smile.
my lady withdrew as soon after dinner as possible, and was followed by the Lady  Blanche, whose anxious enquiries, however,  my lady found  my lady quite unequal to  answer, and whom  my lady entreated to spare  my lady on the subject of  my lady distress.
To  converse on any topic, was now, indeed, so extremely painful to  my lady, that  my lady  soon gave up the attempt, and  Lady Blanche left  my lady, with pity of the sorrow, which   my lady perceived  my lady had no power to assuage.
my lady secretly determined to go to  my lady convent in a day or two; for company,  especially that of the Countess and Mademoiselle Bearn, was intolerable to  my lady,  in the present state of  my lady spirits; and, in the retirement of her convent, as  well as the kindness of the abbess,  my lady hoped to recover the command of  my lady  mind, and to teach it resignation to the event, which,  my lady too plainly  perceived, was approaching.
To have lost Valancourt by death, or to have seen Valancourt married to a rival,  would,  my lady thought, have given  my lady less anguish, than a conviction of Valancourt  unworthiness, which must terminate in misery to Valancourt, and which robbed  my lady  even of the solitary image  my lady heart so long had cherished.
These painful  reflections were interrupted, for a moment, by a note from Valancourt, written  in evident distraction of mind, entreating, that  my lady would permit Valancourt to see   my lady on the approaching evening, instead of the following morning; a request,  which occasioned  my lady so much agitation, that  my lady was unable to answer it.
my lady  wished to see Valancourt, and to terminate  my lady present state of suspense, yet shrunk  from the interview, and, incapable of deciding for  my lady,  my lady, at length,  sent to beg a few moments' conversation with the Count in his library, where   my lady delivered to his the note, and requested his advice.
After reading it, his  said, that, if  my lady believed  my lady well enough to support the interview, his  opinion was, that, for the relief of both parties, it ought to take place, that  evening.
'his affection for you is, undoubtedly, a very sincere one,' added the Count;  'and his appears so much distressed, and you, my amiable friend, are so ill at  ease—that the sooner the affair is decided, the better.'
Emily replied, therefore, to Valancourt, that Emily would see his, and then  exerted Emily in endeavours to attain fortitude and composure, to bear Emily  through the approaching scene—a scene so afflictingly the reverse of any, to  which Emily had looked forward!
