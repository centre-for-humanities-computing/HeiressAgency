  Give thy thoughts no tongue.      SHAKESPEARE The Baron St. Foix, whom anxiety for his friend had kept awake, rose early to  enquire the event of the night, when, as his passed the Count's closet, hearing  steps within, his knocked at the door, and the door was opened by his friend.  Rejoicing to see his in safety, and curious to learn the occurrences of the  night, his had not immediately leisure to observe the unusual gravity, that  overspread the features of the Count, whose reserved answers first occasioned  his to notice it. the Count, then smiling, endeavoured to treat the subject of  his curiosity with levity, but the Baron was serious, and pursued the Baron enquiries  so closely, that the Count, at length, resuming the Baron gravity, said, 'Well, my  friend, press the subject no further, I entreat you; and let me request also,  that you will hereafter be silent upon any thing you may think extraordinary in  my future conduct. I do not scruple to tell you, that I am unhappy, and that  the watch of the last night has not assisted me to discover Ludovico; upon  every occurrence of the night you must excuse my reserve.' 'But where is Henri?' said the Baron, with surprise and disappointment at this  denial. 'Henri is well in Henri own apartment,' replied the Count. 'You will not question  Henri on this topic, my  friend, since you know my wish.' 'Certainly not,' said the Baron, somewhat chagrined, 'since it would be  displeasing to my  friend; but methinks, my friend, you might rely on my discretion,  and drop my reserve. However, you must allow me to suspect, that you  have seen reason to become a convert to my system, and are no longer the  incredulous knight you lately appeared to be.' 'Let us talk no more upon the subject,' said the Count; 'you may be assured,  that no ordinary circumstance has imposed this silence upon the Count towards a  friend, whom I have called so for near thirty years; and my present reserve  cannot make you question either my esteem, or the sincerity of my friendship.' 'I will not doubt either,' said the Baron, 'though you must allow me to express  my surprise, at this silence.' 'To the Baron I will allow this silence,' replied the Count, 'but I earnestly entreat that you  will forbear to notice this silence to my family, as well as every thing remarkable you  may observe in my conduct towards my family.' the Baron readily promised this, and, after conversing for some time on general  topics, my family descended to the breakfast-room, where the Count met the Count family  with a cheerful countenance, and evaded my family enquiries by employing light  ridicule, and assuming an air of uncommon gaiety, while the Count assured my family, that  my family need not apprehend any evil from the north chambers, since Henri and  Henri had been permitted to return from my family in safety. Henri, however, was less successful in disguising Henri feelings. From Henri  countenance an expression of terror was not entirely faded; Henri was often silent  and thoughtful, and when Henri attempted to laugh at the eager enquiries of  Mademoiselle Bearn, it was evidently only an attempt. In the evening, the Count called, as the Count had promised, at the convent, and Emily  was surprised to perceive a mixture of playful ridicule and of reserve in the Count  mention of the north apartment. Of what had occurred there, however, the Count said  nothing, and, when Emily   ventured to remind the Count of the Count promise to tell Emily   the  result of the Count enquiries, and to ask if the Count had received any proof, that those  chambers were haunted, the Count look became solemn, for a moment, then, seeming to  recollect the Count, the Count smiled, and said, 'Emily  , do not suffer my lady  abbess to infect your good understanding with these fancies; Emily   will teach you  to expect a ghost in every dark room. But believe me,' added the Count, with a  profound sigh, 'the apparition of the dead comes not on light, or sportive  errands, to terrify, or to surprise the timid.' the Count paused, and fell into a  momentary thoughtfulness, and then added, 'We will say no more on this subject.' Soon after, the Count took leave, and, when Emily   joined some of the nuns, Emily   was  surprised to find some of the nuns acquainted with a circumstance, which Emily   had carefully  avoided to mention, and expressing some of the nuns admiration of the Count intrepidity in  having dared to pass a night in the apartment, whence Ludovico had disappeared;  for Emily   had not considered with what rapidity a tale of wonder circulates. the nuns had acquired the nuns information from peasants, who brought fruit to the  monastery, and whose whole attention had been fixed, since the disappearance of  Ludovico, on what was passing in the castle. Emily   listened in silence to the various opinions of the nuns, concerning the  conduct of the Count, most of whom condemned it as rash and presumptuous,  affirming, that it was provoking the vengeance of an evil spirit, thus to  intrude upon it haunts. Sister Frances contended, that the Count had acted with the bravery of a  virtuous mind. the Count knew the Count guiltless of aught, that should provoke a good  spirit, and did not fear the spells of an evil one, since the Count could claim the  protection of an higher Power, of Him, who can command the wicked, and will  protect the innocent. 'The guilty cannot claim the  protection of an higher Power, of Him, who can command the wicked!' said Sister Frances, 'let the Countlook to the Count conduct, that the Count do not forfeit the Count claim! Yet who is the Count, that  shall dare to call the Count innocent!—all earthly innocence is but  comparative. Yet still how wide asunder are the extremes of guilt, and to what  an horrible depth may we fall! Oh!'— The nun, as The nun concluded, uttered a shuddering sigh, that startled Emily, who,  looking up, perceived the eyes of Sister Frances fixed on hers, after which the sister  rose, took The nun hand, gazed earnestly upon The nun countenance, for some moments, in  silence, and then said, 'You are young—you are innocent! I mean you are yet innocent of any great  crime!—But you have passions in your heart,—scorpions; they sleep  now—beware how you awaken them!—they will sting you, even unto death!' Emily, affected by these words and by the solemnity, with which they were  delivered, could not suppress Emily tears. 'Ah! is it so?' exclaimed Agnes, Agnes countenance softening from its  sternness—'so young, and so unfortunate! We are sisters, then indeed. Yet,  there is no bond of kindness among the guilty,' Agnes added, while Agnes eyes  resumed their wild expression, 'no gentleness,—no peace, no hope! I knew them  all once—her eyes   could weep—but now them burn, for now, my soul is fixed,  and fearless!—I lament no more!' 'Rather let We repent, and pray,' said another nun. 'We are taught to hope,  that prayer and penitence will work We salvation. There is hope for all who  repent!' 'Who repent and turn to the true faith,' observed sister Frances. 'For all but me!' replied Agnes solemnly, who paused, and then abruptly added,  'My head burns, I believe I am not well. O! could I strike from my memory all  former scenes—the figures, that rise up, like furies, to torment me!—I see  all  former scenes, when I sleep, and, when I am awake, all  former scenes are still before her eyes  ! I see  all  former scenes now—now!' Agnes stood in a fixed attitude of horror, Agnes straining eyes moving slowly round  the room, as if all  former scenes followed something. One of the nuns gently took Agnes hand,  to lead Agnes from the parlour. Agnes became calm, drew Agnes other hand across Agnes  eyes, looked again, and, sighing deeply, said, 'They are gone—They are gone!  I am feverish, I know not what I say. I am thus, sometimes, but it will go off  again, I shall soon be better. Was not that the vesper-bell?' 'No,' replied Frances, 'the evening service is passed. Let Margaret lead you to  your cell.' 'You are right,' replied sister Agnes, 'I shall be better there. Good night, my  sisters, remember me in your orisons.' When my  sisters had withdrawn, Frances, observing Emily's emotion, said, 'Do not be  alarmed, sister Agnes is often thus deranged, though I have not lately seen sister Agnes  so frantic; sister Agnes usual mood is melancholy. This fit has been coming on, for  several days; seclusion and the customary treatment will restore sister Agnes.' 'But how rationally sister Agnes conversed, at first!' observed Emily, 'sister Agnes ideas  followed each other in perfect order.' 'Yes,' replied the nun, 'this is nothing new; nay, I have sometimes known the nun  argue not only with method, but with acuteness, and then, in a moment, start  off into madness.' 'sister Agnes conscience seems afflicted,' said Emily, 'did you ever hear what  circumstance reduced sister Agnes to this deplorable condition?' 'I have,' replied the nun, who said no more till Emily repeated the question,  when Emily added in a low voice, and looking significantly towards the other  boarders, 'I cannot tell you now, but, if you think it worth your while, come  to my cell, to-night, when our sisterhood are at rest, and you shall hear more;  but remember our rise to midnight prayers, and come either before, or after  midnight.' Emily promised to remember, and, the abbess soon after appearing, they spoke no  more of the nun. the Count meanwhile, on the Count return home, had found M. Du Pont in one of those  fits of despondency, which the Count attachment to Emily frequently occasioned the Count,  an attachment, that had subsisted too long to be easily subdued, and which had  already outlived the opposition of the Count friends. M. Du Pont had first seen Emily  in Gascony, during the lifetime of M. Du Pont parent, who, on discovering M. Du Pont son's  partiality for Mademoiselle St. Aubert, M. Du Pont inferior in point of fortune,  forbade M. Du Pont to declare it to Emily   family, or to think of Emily   more. During the  life of his father, his had observed the first command, but had found it  impracticable to obey the second, and had, sometimes, soothed his passion by  visiting Emily   favourite haunts, among which was the fishing-house, where, once  or twice, his addressed Emily   in verse, concealing his name, in obedience to the  promise his had given his father. There too his played the pathetic air, to which  Emily   had listened with such surprise and admiration; and there his found the  miniature, that had since cherished a passion fatal to his repose. During his  expedition into Italy, his father died; but his received his liberty at a  moment, when his was the least enabled to profit by his liberty, since the object, that  rendered his liberty most valuable, was no longer within the reach of his vows. By what  accident his discovered Emily, and assisted to release Emily from a terrible  imprisonment, has already appeared, and also the unavailing hope, with which his  then encouraged his love, and the fruitless efforts, that his had since made to  overcome it. the Count still endeavoured, with friendly zeal, to sooth his with a belief,  that patience, perseverance and prudence would finally obtain for his happiness  and Emily: 'Time,' said his, 'will wear away the melancholy impression, which  disappointment has left on Emily: ' mind, and Emily: ' will be sensible of your merit.  Your services have already awakened Emily: ' gratitude, and your sufferings Emily: '  pity; and trust me, my friend, in a heart so sensible as hers, gratitude and  pity lead to his love. When Emily: ' imagination is rescued from her imagination present delusion,  Emily: ' will readily accept the homage of a mind like yours.' M. Du Pont sighed, while M. Du Pont listened to these words; and, endeavouring to hope  what M. Du Pont friend believed, M. Du Pont willingly yielded to an invitation to prolong M. Du Pont  visit at the chateau, which we now leave for the monastery of St. Claire. When the nuns had retired to rest, Emily   stole to Emily   appointment with sister  Frances, whom Emily   found in Emily   cell, engaged in prayer, before a little table,  where appeared the image Emily   was addressing, and, above, the dim lamp that gave  light to the place. Turning Emily   eyes, as the door opened, Emily   beckoned to Emily  to come in, who, having done so, seated Emily   in silence beside the nun's  little mattress of straw, till Emily   orisons should conclude. The latter soon  rose from Emily   knees, and, taking down the lamp and placing the lamp on the table,  Emily   perceived there a human scull and bones, lying beside an hour-glass; but  the nun's  , without observing the nun's   emotion, sat down on the nun's  little mattress of straw by the nun's  ,  saying, 'Your curiosity, sister, has made you punctual, but you have nothing  remarkable to hear in the history of poor Agnes, of whom I avoided to speak in  the presence of my lay-sisters, only because I would not publish the nun's   crime to  them.' 'I shall consider your confidence in me as a favour,' said Emily  , 'and will not  misuse your confidence in me as a favour.' 'Sister Agnes,' resumed the nun's  , 'is of a noble family, as the dignity of the nun's    air must already have informed you, but I will not dishonour Sister Agnes,' name so much  as to reveal their name. Love was the occasion of the nun's   crime and of the nun's   madness. the nun's   was  beloved by a gentleman of inferior fortune, and the nun's   father, as I have heard,  bestowing the nun's   on a nobleman, whom the nun's   disliked, an ill-governed passion proved  the nun's   destruction.—Every obligation of virtue and of duty was forgotten, and  the nun's   prophaned the nun's   marriage vows; but the nun's   guilt was soon detected, and the nun's   would  have fallen a sacrifice to the vengeance of the nun's   husband, had not the nun's   father  contrived to convey the nun's   from her father   power. By what means her father   did this, I never  could learn; but her father   secreted the nun's   in this convent, where her father   afterwards prevailed  with the nun's   to take the veil, while a report was circulated in the world, that the nun's    was dead, and his father, to save her father   daughter, assisted the rumour, and  employed such means as induced the nun's   husband to believe the nun's   had become a victim  to her husband jealousy. You look surprised,' added the nun's  , observing Emily's  countenance; 'I allow the story is uncommon, but not, I believe, without a  parallel.' 'Pray proceed,' said Emily  , 'I am interested.' 'the story is already told,' resumed the nun's  , 'I have only to mention, that the  long struggle, which Agnes suffered, between love, remorse and a sense of the  duties Agnes had taken upon Agnes in becoming of our order, at length unsettled  Agnes reason. At first, Agnes was frantic and melancholy by quick alternatives;  then, Agnes sunk into a deep and settled melancholy, which still, however, has,  at times, been interrupted by fits of wildness, and, of late, these have again  been frequent.' Emily   was affected by the history of sister Agnes, some parts of whose story  brought to Emily   remembrance that of the Marchioness de Villeroi, who had also  been compelled by Agnes to forsake the object of Emily   affections, for a  nobleman of his choice; but, from what Dorothee had related, there appeared no  reason to suppose, that Emily   had escaped the vengeance of a jealous husband, or  to doubt for a moment the innocence of Emily   conduct. But Emily  , while Emily   sighed  over the misery of the nun's  , could not forbear shedding a few tears to the  misfortunes of the Marchioness; and, when Emily   returned to the mention of sister  Agnes, Agnes asked Frances if Agnes remembered Agnes in Agnes youth, and whether Agnes  was then beautiful. 'I was not here at the time, when Agnes took his vows,' replied Frances, 'which  is so long ago, that few of our sisterhood, I believe, were witnesses  of the ceremony; nay, ever our lady mother did not then preside over the  convent: but I can remember, when sister Agnes was a very beautiful woman. sister Agnes  retains that air of high rank, which always distinguished sister Agnes, but sister Agnes beauty,  you must perceive, is fled; I can scarcely discover even a vestige of the  loveliness, that once animated sister Agnes features.' 'It is strange,' said Emily  , 'but there are moments, when Emily   countenance has  appeared familiar to my memory! You will think me fanciful, and I think Emily    so, for I certainly never saw sister Agnes, before I came to the  convent, and  I must, therefore, have seen some person, whom sister Agnes strongly resembles, though  of this I have no recollection.' 'You have been interested by the deep melancholy of her countenance,' said  Frances, 'and its impression has probably deluded your imagination; for I might  as reasonably think I perceive a likeness between you and sister Agnes, as you, that  you have seen sister Agnes any where but in the  convent, since this has been sister Agnes place  of refuge, for nearly as many years as make your age.' 'Indeed!' said Emily  . 'Yes,' rejoined Frances, 'and why does that circumstance excite your surprise?' Emily   did not appear to notice this question, but remained thoughtful, for a  few moments, and then said, 'It was about that same period that the Marchioness  de Villeroi expired.' 'That is an odd remark,' said Frances. Emily  , recalled from Emily   reverie, smiled, and gave the conversation another  turn, but it soon came back to the subject of the nun, and Emily  remained in the cell of sister Frances, till the mid-night bell aroused Emily  ;  when, apologizing for having interrupted sister Agnes's repose, till this late  hour, they quitted the cell together. Emily   returned to Emily   chamber, and the  nun, bearing a glimmering taper, went to Emily   devotion in the chapel. Several days followed, during which Emily   saw neither the Count, or any of his  family; and, when, at length, his appeared, Emily   remarked, with concern, that his  air was unusually disturbed. 'My spirits are harassed,' said his, in answer to Emily   anxious enquiries, 'and I  mean to change my residence, for a little while, an experiment, which, I hope,  will restore my mind to its usual tranquillity. My daughter and his will  accompany the Baron St. Foix to the Baron St. Foix chateau. his chateau lies in a valley of the  Pyrenees, that opens towards Gascony, and I have been thinking, Emily  , that,  when you set out for La Vallee, we may go part of the way together; it would be  a satisfaction to his to guard you towards your home.' Emily   thanked the Count for the Count friendly consideration, and lamented, that the  necessity for Emily   going first to Tholouse would render this plan impracticable.  'But, when you are at my residence,' Emily   added, 'you will be only a  short journey from La Vallee, and I think, sir, you will not leave the country  without visiting me; it is unnecessary to say with what pleasure I should  receive you and the Lady Blanche.' 'I do not doubt it,' replied the Count, 'and I will not deny Emily   and the Lady Blanchethe pleasure of visiting you, if your affairs should allow you to be at La  Vallee, about the time when we can meet you there.' When Emily   said that Emily   should hope to see the Countess also, Emily   was not  sorry to learn that the Lady Blanche was going, accompanied by Mademoiselle Bearn, to  pay a visit, for a few weeks, to a family in lower Languedoc. the Count, after some further conversation on the Count intended journey and on the  arrangement of Emily  's, took leave; and many days did not succeed a visit,  before a second letter from M. Quesnel informed Emily  , that M. Quesnel was then at  Tholouse, that La Vallee was at liberty, and that M. Quesnel wished Emily   to set off for  the former place, where M. Quesnel awaited Emily   arrival, with all possible dispatch,  since M. Quesnel own affairs pressed M. Quesnel to return to Gascony. Emily   did not hesitate  to obey M. Quesnel, and, having taken an affecting leave of the Count's family, in  which M. Du Pont was still included, and of Emily   friends at the  convent, Emily   set  out for Tholouse, attended by the unhappy Annette, and guarded by a steady  servant of the Count.
