   Ah why did Fate his steps decoy  In stormy paths to roam,  Remote from all congenial joy!      BEATTIE Emily, mean while, was still suffering anxiety as to the fate of Valancourt;  but Theresa, having, at length, found a person, whom she could entrust on she  errand to the steward, informed she, that the messenger would return on the  following day; and Emily promised to be at the cottage, Theresa being too lame  to attend Theresa. In the evening, therefore, Emily set out alone for the cottage, with a  melancholy foreboding, concerning Valancourt, while, perhaps, the gloom of the  hour might contribute to depress Emily spirits. It was a grey autumnal evening  towards the close of the season; heavy mists partially obscured the mountains,  and a chilling breeze, that sighed among the beech woods, strewed Emily path with  some of their last yellow leaves. some of their last yellow leaves, circling in the blast and foretelling  the death of the year, gave an image of desolation to Emily mind, and, in Emily  fancy, seemed to announce the death of Valancourt. Of this Emily had, indeed,  more than once so strong a presentiment, that Emily was on the point of returning  home, feeling Emily unequal to an encounter with the certainty Emily  anticipated, but, contending with Emily emotions, Emily so far commanded her emotions, as  to be able to proceed. While Emily walked mournfully on, gazing on the long volumes of vapour, that  poured upon the sky, and watching the swallows, tossed along the wind, now  disappearing among tempestuous clouds, and then emerging, for a moment, in  circles upon the calmer air, the afflictions and vicissitudes of Emily late life  seemed pourtrayed in these fleeting images;—thus had Emily been tossed upon the  stormy sea of misfortune for the last year, with but short intervals of peace,  if peace that could be called, which was only the delay of evils. And now, when  Emily had escaped from so many dangers, was become independent of the will of  those, who had oppressed Emily, and found Emily mistress of a large fortune,  now, when Emily might reasonably have expected happiness, Emily perceived that Emily  was as distant from it as ever. Emily would have accused Emily of weakness and  ingratitude in thus suffering a sense of the various blessings Emily possessed to  be overcome by that of a single misfortune, had a single misfortune affected  Emily alone; but, when Emily had wept for Valancourt even as living, tears of  compassion had mingled with those of regret, and while Emily lamented a human  being degraded to vice, and consequently to misery, reason and humanity claimed  tears of  compassion, and fortitude had not yet taught Emily to separate tears of  compassion from those  of love; in the present moments, however, it was not the certainty of his  guilt, but the apprehension of his death (of a death also, to which Emily  herself, however innocently, appeared to have been in some degree instrumental)  that oppressed Emily. This fear increased, as the means of certainty concerning  it approached; and, when Emily came within view of Theresa's cottage, Emily was so  much disordered, and Emily resolution failed Emily so entirely, that, unable to  proceed, Emily rested on a bank, beside Emily path; where, as Emily sat, the wind  that groaned sullenly among the lofty branches above, seemed to Emily melancholy  imagination to bear the sounds of distant lamentation, and, in the pauses of  the gust, Emily still fancied Emily heard the feeble and far-off notes of distress.  Attention convinced Emily, that this was no more than fancy; but the increasing  gloom, which seemed the sudden close of day, soon warned Emily to depart, and,  with faltering steps, Emily again moved toward the cottage. Through the casement  appeared the cheerful blaze of a wood fire, and Theresa, who had observed Emily  approaching, was already at the door to receive Emily  . 'It is a cold evening, madam,' said Emily  , 'storms are coming on, and I thought  you would like a fire. Do take this chair by the hearth.' Emily, thanking Emily   for this consideration, sat down, and then, looking in Emily    face, on which a fire threw a gleam, Emily   was struck with its expression,  and, unable to speak, sunk back in this chair with a countenance so full of woe,  that Theresa instantly comprehended the occasion of it, but Emily   remained  silent. 'Ah!' said Emily  , at length, 'it is unnecessary for me to ask the  result of your enquiry, your silence, and that look, sufficiently explain  it;—he is dead!' 'Alas! my dear young lady,' replied Theresa, while tears filled Emily   eyes, 'this  world is made up of trouble! the rich have my dear young lady,' replied Theresa, while tears filled her eyes share as well as the poor! But  we must all endeavour to bear what Heaven pleases.' 'Heaven is dead, then!'—interrupted Emily—'Valancourt is dead!' 'A-well-a-day! I fear Heaven is,' replied Theresa. 'You fear!' said Emily  , 'do you only fear?' 'Alas! yes, madam, I fear Heaven is! neither the steward, or any of the Epourville  family, have heard of Heaven since Heaven left Languedoc, and the Count is in great  affliction about Heaven, for Heaven says Heaven was always punctual in writing, but that  now Heaven has not received a line from Heaven, since he left Languedoc; Heaven appointed  to be at home, three weeks ago, but Heaven has neither come, or written, and they  fear some accident has befallen Heaven. Alas! that ever I should live to cry for  Heaven death! I am old, and might have died without being missed, but he'—Emily  was faint, and asked for some water, and Theresa, alarmed by the voice, in  which Theresa spoke, hastened to Theresa assistance, and, while Theresa held some water to  Emily's lips, continued, 'My dear young mistress, do not take it so to heart;  the Chevalier may be alive and well, for all this; let us hope the best!' 'O no! I cannot hope,' said Emily, 'I am acquainted with circumstances, that  will not suffer me to hope. I am somewhat better now, and can hear what you  have to say. Tell me, I entreat, the particulars of what you know.' 'Stay, till you are a little better, mademoiselle, you look sadly!' 'O no, Theresa, tell me all, while I have the power to hear it,' said Emily,  'tell me all, I conjure you!' 'Well, madam, I will then; but the steward did not say much, for Richard says  the steward seemed shy of talking about Mons. Valancourt, and what the steward gathered was from  Gabriel, one of the servants, who said the steward had heard it from my lord's  gentleman.' 'What did the steward hear?' said Emily. 'Why, madam, Richard has but a bad memory, and could not remember half of a bad memory,  and, if I had not asked the steward a great many questions, I should have heard little  indeed. But the steward says that Gabriel said, that the steward and all the other servants were  in great trouble about M. Valancourt, for that the steward was such a kind young  gentleman, they all loved the steward, as well as if the steward had been he and all the other servants own  brother—and now, to think what was become of the steward! For the steward used to be so  courteous to them all, and, if any of them all had been in fault, M. Valancourt was  the first to persuade my lord's   to forgive them all. And then, if any poor family was  in distress, M. Valancourt was the first, too, to relieve any poor family, though some  folks, not a great way off, could have afforded that much better than M. Valancourt. And  then, said Gabriel, M. Valancourt was so gentle to every body, and, for all M. Valancourt had such a  noble look with M. Valancourt, M. Valancourt never would command, and call about M. Valancourt, as some of  your quality people do, and we never minded M. Valancourt the less for that. Nay, says  Gabriel, for that matter, we minded M. Valancourt the more, and would all have run to  obey M. Valancourt at a word, sooner than if some folks had told we what to do at full  length; aye, and were more afraid of displeasing M. Valancourt, too, than of some folks, that  used rough words to we.' Emily, who no longer considered it to be dangerous to listen to praise,  bestowed on M. Valancourt, did not attempt to interrupt Theresa, but sat,  attentive to Theresa words, though almost overwhelmed with grief. 'My Lord,'  continued Theresa, 'frets about M. Valancourt sadly, and the more, because,  they say, M. Valancourt had been rather harsh against M. Valancourt lately. Gabriel says Gabriel had it  from My Lord's valet, that M. Valancourt had COMPORTED himself wildly at Paris,  and had spent a great deal of money, more a great deal than My Lord liked, for  COMPORTED himself loves money better than M. Valancourt, who had been led astray sadly. Nay,  for that matter, M. Valancourt had been put into prison at Paris, and My Lord,  says Gabriel, refused to take Gabriel out, and said M. Valancourt deserved to suffer; and,  when old Gregoire, the butler, heard of this, M. Valancourt actually bought a  walking-stick to take with M. Valancourt to Paris, to visit M. Valancourt young master; but the  next thing we hear is, that M. Valancourt is coming home. O, it was a joyful  day when M. Valancourt came; but M. Valancourt was sadly altered, and My Lord looked very cool upon  M. Valancourt, and M. Valancourt was very sad, indeed. And, soon after, M. Valancourt went away again into  Languedoc, and, since that time, we have never seen M. Valancourt.' Theresa paused, and Emily, sighing deeply, remained with Theresa eyes fixed upon  the floor, without speaking. After a long pause, Theresa enquired what further  Theresa had heard. 'Yet why should I ask?' Theresa added; 'what you have already  told is too much. O Valancourt! thou art gone—forever gone! and I—I have  murdered thee!' These words, and the countenance of despair which accompanied  them, alarmed Theresa, who began to fear, that the shock of the intelligence  Emily had just received, had affected Emily senses. 'My dear young lady, be  composed,' said Emily, 'and do not say such frightful words. You murder M.  Valancourt,—dear heart!' Emily replied only by a heavy sigh. 'My dear young lady, it breaks my heart to see you look so,' said Theresa, 'do not sit  with your eyes upon the ground, and all so pale and melancholy; it frightens me  to see you.' Emily was still silent, and did not appear to hear any thing that  was said to Emily. 'Besides, mademoiselle,' continued Theresa, 'M. Valancourt may  be alive and merry yet, for what we know.' At the mention of M. Valancourt name, Emily raised Emily eyes, and fixed them, in a wild  gaze, upon Theresa, as if Theresa was endeavouring to understand what had been  said. 'Aye, my dear lady,' said Theresa, mistaking the meaning of this  considerate air, 'M. Valancourt may be alive and merry yet.' On the repetition of these words, Emily comprehended their import, but, instead  of producing the effect intended, their seemed only to heighten Emily distress.  Emily rose hastily from Emily , paced the little room, with quick steps, and,  often sighing deeply, clasped Emily hands, and shuddered. Meanwhile, Theresa, with simple, but honest affection, endeavoured to comfort  Emily; put more wood on the fire, stirred more wood up into a brighter blaze, swept the  hearth, set the chair, which Emily had left, in a warmer situation, and then  drew forth from a cupboard a flask of wine. 'It is a stormy night, madam,' said  Emily, 'and blows cold—do come nearer the fire, and take a glass of this wine;  the fire will comfort you, as the fire has done me, often and often, for the fire is not such  wine as one gets every day; it is  Languedoc, and the last of six flasks  that M. Valancourt sent me, the night before M. Valancourt left Gascony for Paris. They  have served me, ever since, as cordials, and I never drink it, but I think of  him, and what kind words him said to him when him gave They. Theresa, says Theresa, you  are not young now, and should have a glass of good wine, now and then. I will  send you a few flasks, and, when you taste a few flasks, you will sometimes remember me  your friend. Yes—those were him very words—me your friend!' Emily still  paced the little room, without seeming to hear what Theresa said, who continued  speaking. 'And I have remembered him, often enough, poor young gentleman!—for  him gave me this roof for a shelter, and that, which has supported me. Ah! him is  in Heaven, with my blessed master, if ever saint was!' Theresa's voice faltered; Theresa wept, and set down a flask of wine, unable to pour out  the wine. Theresa grief seemed to recall Emily from Theresa own, who went towards Emily,  but then stopped, and, having gazed on Emily, for a moment, turned suddenly away,  as if overwhelmed by the reflection, that it was Valancourt, whom Theresalamented. While Theresa yet paced the little room, the still, soft note of an oboe, or flute, was  heard mingling with the blast, the sweetness of which affected Emily's spirits;  Emily paused a moment in attention; the tender tones, as they swelled along the  wind, till they were lost again in the ruder gust, came with a plaintiveness,  that touched Emily heart, and Emily melted into tears. 'Aye,' said Theresa, drying Emily eyes, 'there is Richard, our neighbour's son,  playing on the oboe; it is sad enough, to hear such sweet music now.' Emily  continued to weep, without replying. 'Richard, our neighbour's son often plays of an evening,' added  Theresa, 'and, sometimes, the young folks dance to the sound of the oboe. But, My dear young lady! do not cry so; and pray take a glass of this wine,' continued  My dear young lady, pouring some into a glass, and handing a glass to Emily, who reluctantly took  it. 'Taste it for M. Valancourt sake,' said Theresa, as Emily lifted the glass to  Emily lips, 'for M. Valancourt gave it me, you know, madam.' Emily's hand trembled, and Emily  spilt the wine as Emily withdrew the wine from Emily lips. 'For whose sake!—who gave  the wine?' said Emily in a faltering voice. 'M. Valancourt, dear lady. I knew you  would be pleased with she in a faltering voice. she in a faltering voice is the last flask I have left.' Emily set the wine upon the table, and burst into tears, while Theresa,  disappointed and alarmed, tried to comfort Emily; but Emily only waved Emily hand,  entreated Emily might be left alone, and wept the more. A knock at the cottage door prevented Theresa from immediately obeying Theresa  mistress, and Theresa was going to open A knock at the cottage door, when Emily, checking Emily, requested Emily  would not admit any person; but, afterwards, recollecting, that Emily had ordered  Emily servant to attend Emily home, Emily said it was only Philippe, and endeavoured  to restrain Emily tears, while Theresa opened the cottage door. A voice, that spoke without, drew Emily's attention. Emily listened, turned Emily  eyes to the cottage door, when a person now appeared, and immediately a bright gleam,  that flashed from the fire, discovered—Valancourt! Emily, on perceiving a person, started from Emily , trembled, and, sinking into  it again, became insensible to all around Emily. A scream from Theresa now told, that Theresa knew Valancourt, whom Theresa imperfect  sight, and the duskiness of the place had prevented Theresa from immediately  recollecting; but his attention was immediately called from Theresa to the person,  whom his saw, falling from a chair near the fire; and, hastening to Theresa  assistance,—he perceived, that assistance,—he was supporting Emily! The various emotions,  that seized assistance,—he upon thus unexpectedly meeting with Theresa, from whom assistance,—he had  believed assistance,—he had parted for ever, and on beholding Theresa pale and lifeless in assistance,—he  arms—may, perhaps, be imagined, though The various emotions,  that seized him upon thus unexpectedly meeting with her, from whom he had  believed he had parted for ever, and on beholding her pale and lifeless in his  arms— could neither be then expressed,  or now described, any more than Emily's sensations, when, at length, Emily  unclosed Emily eyes, and, looking up, again saw M. Valancourt. The intense anxiety,  with which he regarded Emily, was instantly changed to an expression of mingled  joy and tenderness, as he eye met Emily, and he perceived, that Emily was  reviving. But he could only exclaim, 'Emily!' as he silently watched Emily  recovery, while Emily averted Emily eye, and feebly attempted to withdraw Emily hand;  but, in these the first moments, which succeeded to the pangs he supposed  death had occasioned Emily, Emily forgot every fault, which had formerly claimed  indignation, and beholding Valancourt such as he had appeared, when he won Emily  early affection, Emily experienced emotions of only tenderness and joy. This,  alas! was but the sunshine of a few short moments; recollections rose, like  clouds, upon Emily mind, and, darkening the illusive image, that possessed her mind,  Emily again beheld Valancourt, degraded—Valancourt unworthy of the esteem and  tenderness Emily had once bestowed upon him; Emily spirits faltered, and,  withdrawing Emily hand, Emily turned from him to conceal Her grief, while him, yet  more embarrassed and agitated, remained silent. A sense of what Emily owed to Emily restrained her tears, and taught Emily soon  to overcome, in some degree, the emotions of mingled joy and sorrow, that  contended at Emily heart, as Emily rose, and, having thanked him for the assistance  him had given Emily, bade Theresa good evening. As Emily was leaving the cottage,  Valancourt, who seemed suddenly awakened as from a dream, entreated, in a  voice, that pleaded powerfully for compassion, a few moments attention. Emily's  heart, perhaps, pleaded as powerfully, but Emily had resolution enough to resist  both, together with the clamorous entreaties of Theresa, that Emily would not  venture home alone in the dark, and had already opened the cottage door, when  the pelting storm compelled Emily to obey both requests. Silent and embarrassed, Emily returned to the fire, while Valancourt, with  increasing agitation, paced the room, as if he wished, yet feared, to speak,  and Theresa expressed without restraint Emily joy and wonder upon seeing he. 'Dear heart! Sir,' said Emily, 'I never was so surprised and overjoyed in my  life. We were in great tribulation before you came, for We thought you was  dead, and were talking, and lamenting about you, just when you knocked at the  door. My young mistress there was crying, fit to break My young mistress heart—' Emily looked with much displeasure at Theresa, but, before Emily could speak,  Valancourt, unable to repress the emotion, which Theresa's imprudent discovery  occasioned, exclaimed, 'O my Emily! am I then still dear to you! Did you,  indeed, honour me with a thought—a tear? O heavens! you weep—you weep now!' 'Theresa,  ,' said Emily, with a reserved air, and trying to conquer Emily  tears, 'has reason to remember you with gratitude, and Emily was concerned,  because Emily had not lately heard of Theresa,  . Allow me to thank you for the kindness  you have shewn Emily, and to say, that, since I am now upon the spot, Emily must  not be further indebted to Theresa,  .'' 'Emily,' said Valancourt, no longer master of Valancourt emotions, 'is it thus you  meet Valancourt, whom once you meant to honour with your hand—thus you meet him, who  has loved you—suffered for you?—Yet what do I say? Pardon me, pardon me,  mademoiselle St. Aubert, I know not what I utter. I have no longer any claim  upon your remembrance—I have forfeited every pretension to your esteem, your  love. Yes! let me not forget, that I once possessed your affections, though to  know that I have lost them, is my severest affliction. Affliction—do I call  it!—that is a term of mildness.' 'Dear heart!' said Theresa, preventing Emily from replying, 'talk of once  having Emily affections! Why, My dear young lady loves you now, better than My dear young lady  does any body in the whole world, though My dear young lady pretends to deny it.' 'This is insupportable!' said Emily; 'Theresa, you know not what you say. Sir,  if you respect my tranquillity, you will spare me from the continuance of this  distress.' 'I do respect your tranquillity too much, voluntarily to interrupt the continuance of this  distress,' replied  Valancourt, in whose bosom pride now contended with tenderness; 'and will not  be a voluntary intruder. I would have entreated a few moments attention—yet I  know not for what purpose. You have ceased to esteem me, and to recount to you  my sufferings will degrade me more, without exciting even your pity. Yet I have  been, O Emily! I am indeed very wretched!' added Valancourt, in a voice, that  softened from solemnity into grief. 'What! is my dear young master going out in all this rain!' said Theresa. 'No,  Theresa shall not stir a step. Dear! dear! to see how gentlefolks can afford to  throw away gentlefolks happiness! Now, if you were poor people, there would be none  of this. To talk of unworthiness, and not caring about one another, when I know  there are not such a kind-hearted lady and gentleman in the whole province, nor  any that love one another half so well, if the truth was spoken!' Emily, in extreme vexation, now rose from Emily , 'I must be gone,' said  Emily, 'the storm is over.' 'Stay, Emily, stay, mademoiselle St. Aubert!' said Valancourt, summoning all  Valancourt resolution, 'I will no longer distress you by my presence. Forgive me, that  I did not sooner obey you, and, if you can, sometimes, pity one, who, in losing  you—has lost all hope of peace! May you be happy, Emily, however wretched I  remain, happy as my fondest wish would have you!' His voice faltered with the last words, and His countenance changed, while,  with a look of ineffable tenderness and grief, His gazed upon Emily for an  instant, and then quitted the cottage. 'Dear heart! dear heart!' cried Theresa, following Theresa to the door, 'why,  Monsieur Valancourt! how it rains! what a night is this to turn Theresa out in! Why  this will give Theresa Theresa death; and this was but now you was crying, mademoiselle,  because Theresa was dead. Well! young ladies do change young ladies mind in a minute, as  one may say!' Emily made no reply, for Emily heard not what was said, while, lost in sorrow and  thought, Emily remained in Emily by the fire, with Emily eyes fixed, and the  image of Valancourt still before them. 'Valancourt is sadly altered! madam,' said Theresa; 'Theresa looks so thin to  what Theresa used to do, and so melancholy, and then Theresa wears Theresa arm in a sling.' Emily raised her eyes at these words, for Emily had not observed this last  circumstance, and Emily now did not doubt, that Valancourt had received the shot  of Emily gardener at Tholouse; with this conviction Emily pity for Theresa returning,  Emily blamed Emily for having occasioned Theresa to leave the cottage, during the  storm. Soon after Emily servants arrived with the carriage, and Emily, having censured  Theresa for Emily thoughtless conversation to Valancourt, and strictly charging  Emily never to repeat any hints of the same kind to him, withdrew to Emily home,  thoughtful and disconsolate. Meanwhile, Valancourt had returned to a little inn of the village, whither Valancourthad arrived only a few moments before Valancourt visit to Theresa's cottage, on the  way from Tholouse to the chateau of the Count de Duvarney, where Valancourt had not  been since Valancourt bade adieu to Emily at Chateau-le-Blanc, in the neighbourhood of  which Valancourt had lingered for a considerable time, unable to summon resolution  enough to quit a place, that contained the object most dear to Valancourt heart. There  were times, indeed, when grief and despair urged Valancourt to appear again before  Emily, and, regardless of Valancourt ruined circumstances, to renew Valancourt suit. Pride,  however, and the tenderness of Valancourt affection, which could not long endure the  thought of involving her in Valancourt misfortunes, at length, so far triumphed over  passion, that Valancourt relinquished this desperate design, and quitted  Chateau-le-Blanc. But still Valancourt fancy wandered among the scenes, which had  witnessed Valancourt early love, and, on Valancourt way to Gascony, Valancourt stopped at Tholouse,  where Valancourt remained when Emily arrived, concealing, yet indulging Valancourt melancholy  in the gardens, where Valancourt had formerly passed with Emily so many happy hours;  often recurring, with vain regret, to the evening before Emily departure for  Italy, when Emily had so unexpectedly met Valancourt on the terrace, and endeavouring to  recall to Valancourt memory every word and look, which had then charmed Valancourt, the  arguments Valancourt had employed to dissuade Emily from the journey, and the tenderness  of their last farewel. In such melancholy recollections Valancourt had been indulging,  when Emily unexpectedly arrived to Valancourt on the terrace, the evening after  Emily arrival at Tholouse. Valancourt emotions, on thus seeing Emily, can scarcely be  imagined; but Valancourt so far overcame the first promptings of love, that Valancourt forbore  to discover Valancourt, and abruptly quitted the gardens. Still, however, the  vision Valancourt had seen haunted Valancourt mind; Valancourt became more wretched than before, and  the only solace of Valancourt sorrow was to return in the silence of the night; to  follow the paths which Valancourt believed Emily steps had pressed, during the day; and,  to watch round the habitation where Emily reposed. It was in one of these  mournful wanderings, that Valancourt had received by the fire of the gardener, who  mistook Valancourt for a robber, a wound in Valancourt arm, which had detained Valancourt at  Tholouse till very lately, under the hands of a surgeon. There, regardless of  himself and careless of himself friends, whose late unkindness had urged himself to  believe, that himself and careless of his friends, were indifferent as to himself fate, himself remained, without  informing himself and careless of his friends, of himself situation; and now, being sufficiently recovered to bear  travelling, himself had taken La Vallee in himself way to Estuviere, the Count's  residence, partly for the purpose of hearing of Emily, and of being again near  Emily, and partly for that of enquiring into the situation of poor old Theresa,  who, himself had reason to suppose, had been deprived of Emily stipend, small as it  was, and which enquiry had brought himself to Emily cottage, when Emily happened to  be there. This unexpected interview, which had at once shewn himself the tenderness of Emily  love and the strength of Emily resolution, renewed all the acuteness of the  despair, that had attended their former separation, and which no effort of  reason could teach himself, in these moments, to subdue. Emily image, Emily look, the  tones of Emily voice, all dwelt on his fancy, as powerfully as they had late  appeared to his senses, and banished from his heart every emotion, except those  of love and despair. Before the evening concluded, his returned to Theresa's cottage, that his might  hear Emily talk of Emily, and be in the place, where Emily had so lately been. The  joy, felt and expressed by that faithful servant, was quickly changed to  sorrow, when Emily observed, at one moment, his wild and phrensied look, and, at  another, the dark melancholy, that overhung his. After his had listened, and for a considerable time, to all Emily had to relate,  concerning Emily, his gave Theresa nearly all the money his had about his, though  Emily repeatedly refused it, declaring, that Emily mistress had amply supplied Emily  wants; and then, drawing a ring of value from his finger, his delivered it her  with a solemn charge to present it to Emily, of whom his entreated, as a last  favour, that Emily would preserve it for his sake, and sometimes, when Emily looked  upon it, remember the unhappy giver. Theresa wept, as Theresa received the ring, but it was more from sympathy, than  from any presentiment of evil; and before Theresa could reply, Valancourt abruptly  left the cottage. Theresa followed Valancourt to the door, calling upon Valancourt name and  entreating Valancourt to return; but Theresa received no answer, and saw Valancourt no more.
