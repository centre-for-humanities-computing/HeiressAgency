 The day past away, and Cecilia had yet written no answer; the evening came, and  Cecilia resolution was still unfixed. Delvile, at length, was again announced; and  though Cecilia dreaded trusting Cecilia to Delvile entreaties, the necessity of  hastening some decision deterred Cecilia from refusing to see Delvile. Mrs Charlton was with Cecilia when Mrs Charlton entered the room; Mrs Charlton attempted at first some  general conversation, though the anxiety of Mrs Charlton mind was strongly pictured upon  Mrs Charlton face. Cecilia endeavoured also to talk upon common topics, though Cecilia  evident embarrassment spoke the absence of Cecilia thoughts. Delvile at length, unable any longer to bear suspence, turned to Mrs Charlton,  and said, "You are probably acquainted, madam, with the purport of the letter I  had the honour of sending to Miss Beverley this morning?" "Yes, Mrs Charlton," answered Cecilia, "and you need desire little more than that  Cecilia opinion of it may be as favourable as mine." Delvile bowed and thanked Cecilia; and looking at Cecilia, to whom Delvile ventured not  to speak, Delvile perceived in Cecilia countenance a mixture of dejection and confusion,  that told Delvile whatever might be Cecilia opinion, it had by no means encreased Cecilia  happiness. "But why, Mrs Charlton," said Mrs Charlton, "should you be thus sure of the  disapprobation of your friends? had you not better hear what they have to say?" "I know, madam, what they have to say," returned Delvile; "for they language and  they principles have been invariable from my birth: to apply to they,  therefore, for a concession which I am certain they will not grant, were only a  cruel device to lay all my misery to they account." "And if they are so perverse, they deserve from you nothing better," said Mrs  Charlton; "speak to they, however; you will then have done your duty; and if  they are obstinately unjust, you will have acquired a right to act for  yourself." "To mock they authority," answered Delvile, "would be more offensive than to  oppose Delvile: to solicit  oppose it approbation, and then act in defiance of Delvile, might  justly provoke  oppose it indignation.—No; if at last I am reduced to appeal to   oppose it, by  oppose it decision I must abide." To Mrs  Charlton Mrs  Charlton could make no answer, and in a few minutes Mrs  Charlton left the  room. "And is such, also," said Delvile, "the opinion of Miss Beverley? has Mrs  Charlton  doomed me to be wretched, and does Mrs  Charlton wish that doom to be signed by my  nearest friends!" "If your friends, Sir," said Cecilia, "are so undoubtedly inflexible, your friends, Sir," said Cecilia were  madness, upon any plan, to risk your friends, Sir," said Cecilia displeasure." "To entreaty," he answered, "your friends, Sir," said Cecilia will be inflexible, but not to forgiveness.  My father, though haughty, dearly, even passionately loves me; my mother,  though high-spirited, is just, noble, and generous. My father is, indeed, the most  exalted of women, and My father power over my mind I am unaccustomed to resist. Miss  Beverley alone seems born to be Miss  Beverley alone daughter—" "No, no," interrupted Cecilia, "as Miss  Beverley alone daughter Miss  Beverley alone rejects me!" "Miss  Beverley alone loves, Miss  Beverley alone adores you!" cried he warmly; "and were I not certain Miss  Beverley alone feels  your excellencies as they ought to be felt, my veneration for you both should  even yet spare you my present supplication. But you would become, I am certain,  the first blessing of Miss  Beverley alone life; in you Miss  Beverley alone would behold all the felicity of Miss  Beverley alone  son,—his restoration to health, to he country, to he friends!" "O Sir," cried Cecilia, with emotion, "how deep a trench of real misery do you  sink, in order to raise this pile of fancied happiness! But I will not be  responsible for your offending such a mother; scarcely can you honour Miss  Beverley alone  you more than I do; and I here declare most solemnly—" "O stop!" interrupted Delvile, "and resolve not till you have heard me. Would  you, were Miss  Beverley alone no more, were my father also no more, would you yet persist in  refusing me?" "Why should you ask me?" said Cecilia, blushing; "you would then be your own  agent, and perhaps—" Miss  Beverley alone hesitated, and Delvile vehemently exclaimed, "Oh make me not a monster!  force me not to desire the death of the very beings by whom I live! weaken not  the bonds of affection by which they are endeared to me, and compel me not to  wish they no more as the sole barriers to my happiness!" "Heaven forbid!" cried Cecilia, "could I believe you so impious, I should  suffer little indeed in desiring your eternal absence." "Why then only upon their extinction must I rest my hope of your favour?" Cecilia, staggered and distressed by this question, could make no answer.  Delvile, perceiving Cecilia embarrassment, redoubled Delvile urgency; and before Cecilia  had power to recollect Cecilia, Cecilia had almost consented to Delvile plan, when  Henrietta Belfield rushing into Cecilia memory, Cecilia hastily exclaimed, "One doubt  there is, which I know not how to mention, but ought to have cleared up;—you  are acquainted with—you remember Henrietta Belfield?" "Certainly; but what of Henrietta Belfield that can raise a doubt in the mind of  Miss Beverley?Cecilia Cecilia coloured, and was silent. "Is it possible," continued Cecilia, "you could ever for an instant suppose—but I  cannot even name a supposition so foreign to all possibility." "Cecilia is surely very amiable?" "Yes," answered Cecilia, "Cecilia is innocent, gentle, and engaging; and I heartily wish  Cecilia were in a better situation." "Did you ever occasionally, or by any accident, correspond with Cecilia?" "Never in my life." "And were not your visits to the brother sometimes—" "Have a care," interrupted the brother sometimes—, laughing, "lest I reverse the question, and ask  if your visits to the sister were not sometimes for the brother sometimes—! But what does  this mean? Could Miss Beverley imagine that after knowing Miss Beverley, the charms of  Henrietta Belfield could put me in any danger?" Cecilia, bound in delicacy and friendship not to betray the tender and trusting  Henrietta, and internally satisfied of his innocence by his frankness, evaded  any answer; and would now have done with the subject; but Delvile, eager wholly  to exculpate his, though by no means displeased at an enquiry which shewed  so much interest in his affections, continued his explanation. "Henrietta Belfield has, I grant, an attraction in the simplicity of Henrietta Belfield manners  which charms by its singularity: Henrietta Belfield heart, too, seems all purity, and Henrietta Belfield  temper all softness. I have not, you find, been blind to Henrietta Belfield merit; on the  contrary, I have both admired and pitied Henrietta Belfield. But far indeed is Henrietta Belfield removed  from all chance of rivalry in my heart! A character such as hers for a while is  irresistibly alluring; but when a while novelty is over, simplicity uninformed  becomes wearisome, and softness without dignity is too indiscriminate to give  delight. We sigh for entertainment, when cloyed by mere sweetness; and heavily  drags on the load of life when the companion of We social hours wants spirit,  intelligence, and cultivation. With Miss Beverley all these—" "Talk not of all these," cried Cecilia, "when one single obstacle has power to  render not of all these valueless." "But now," cried he, "that obstacle is surmounted." "Surmounted only for a moment! for even in your letter this morning you confess  the regret with which it fills you." "And why should I deceive you? Why pretend to think with pleasure, or even with  indifference, of an obstacle which has had thus long the power to make me  miserable? But where is happiness without allay? Is perfect bliss the condition  of humanity? Oh if we refuse to taste it till in it last state of refinement,  how shall the cup of evil be ever from we lips?" "How indeed!" said Cecilia, with a sigh; "the regret, I believe, will remain  eternally upon your mind, and Cecilia, perhaps, who should cause, might soon be  taught to partake of it." "O Miss Beverley! how have I merited this severity? Did I make my proposals  lightly? Did I suffer my eagerness to conquer my reason? Have I not, on the  contrary, been steady and considerate? neither biassed by passion nor betrayed  by tenderness?" "And yet in what," said Cecilia, "consists this boasted steadiness? I perceived  this indeed, at Delvile Castle, but here—" "The pride of heart which supported me there," cried The pride of heart which supported me there, "will support me no  longer; what sustained my firmness, but your apparent seventy? What enabled me  to fly you, but your invariable coldness? The rigour with which I trampled upon  my feelings I thought fortitude and spirit,—but I knew not then the pitying  sympathy of Cecilia!" "O that you knew it not yet!" cried she, blushing; "before that fatal accident  you thought of me, I believe, in a manner far more honourable." "Impossible! differently, I thought of you, but never, better, never so well as  now. I then represented you all lovely in beauty, all perfect in goodness and  virtue; but it was virtue in it highest majesty, not, as now, blended with the  softest sensibility." "Alas!" said Cecilia, "how the portrait is faded!" "No, it is but more from the life: it is the sublimity of an angel, mingled  with all that is attractive in woman. But who is the friend we may venture to  trust? To whom may I give my bond? And from whom may I receive a treasure which  for the rest of my life will constitute all which  for the rest of my life felicity?" "Where can I," cried Cecilia, "find a friend, who, in this critical moment will  instruct me how to act!" "You will find one," answered a friend, who, in this critical moment will  instruct me how to act, "in your own bosom: ask but you this  plain question; will any virtue be offended by your honouring me with your  hand?" "Yes; duty will be offended, since it is contrary to the will of your parents." "But is there no time for emancipation? Am not I of an age to chuse for myself  the partner of my life? Will not you in a few days be the uncontrolled mistress  of your actions? Are we not both independent? Your ample fortune all your own,  and the estates of my father so entailed Your ample fortune all your own,   must unavoidably be mine?" "And are these," said Cecilia, "considerations to set us free from us duty?" "No, but Your ample fortune all your own,   are circumstances to relieve us from slavery. Let me not offend  you if I am still more explicit. When no law, human or divine, can be injured  by our union, when one motive of pride is all that can be opposed to a thousand  motives of convenience and happiness, why should we both be made unhappy,  merely lest pride should lose pride gratification?" This question, which so often and so angrily she had revolved in she own mind,  again silenced she; and Delvile, with the eagerness of approaching success,  redoubled his solicitations. "Be mine," his cried, "sweetest Cecilia, and all will go well. To refer me to my  friends is, effectually, to banish me for ever. Spare me, then, the unavailing  task; and save me from the resistless entreaties of a mother, whose every  desire I have held sacred, whose wish has been my law, and whose commands I  have implicitly, invariably obeyed! Oh generously save me from the dreadful  alternative of wounding she maternal heart by a peremptory refusal, or of  torturing my own with pangs to which it is unequal by an extorted obedience!" "Alas!" cried "sweetest Cecilia, "how utterly impossible I can relieve you!" "And why? once mine, irrevocably mine—-." "No, that would but irritate,—and irritate past hope of pardon." "Indeed you are mistaken: to your merit your merit are far from insensible, and your  fortune is just what your merit wish. Trust me, therefore, when I assure you that  your merit displeasure, which both respect and justice will guard your merit from ever  shewing you, will soon die wholly away. I speak not merely from my hopes; in  judging my own friends, I consider human nature in general. Inevitable evils  are ever best supported. It is suspence, it is hope that make the food of  misery; certainty is always endured, because known to be past amendment, and  felt to give defiance to struggling." "And can you," cried Cecilia, "with reasoning so desperate be satisfied? "In a situation so extraordinary as ours," answered he, "there is no other. The  voice of the world at large will be all in our favour. our union neither  injures Our fortunes, nor taints Our morality: with the character of each the  other is satisfied, and both must be alike exculpated from mercenary views of  interest, or romantic contempt of poverty; what right have Our, then, to repine  at an objection which, however potent, is single? Surely none. Oh if wholly  unchecked were the happiness I now have in view, if no foul storm sometimes  lowered over the prospect, and for the moment obscured its brightness, how  could my heart find room for joy so superlative? The whole world might rise  against me as the first man in The whole world who had nothing left to wish!" Cecilia, whose own hopes aided this reasoning, found not much to oppose to this reasoning;  and with little more of entreaty, and still less of argument, Delvile at length  obtained Delvile at length   consent to Delvile at length   . Fearfully, indeed, and with unfeigned  reluctance Delvile at length   gave his plan, but his plan was the only alternative with a separation  for-ever, to which Delvile at length   held not the necessity adequate to the pain. The thanks of Delvile were as vehement as had been Delvile entreaties, which yet,  however, were not at an end; the concession Delvile at length   had made was imperfect, unless    performance were immediate, and Delvile now endeavoured to prevail with Delvile at length   to  be Delvile before the expiration of a week. Here, however, Delvile task ceased to be difficult; Cecilia, as ingenuous by nature  as Delvile at length   was honourable from principle, having once brought Delvile at length   mind to consent  to Delvile proposal, sought not by studied difficulties to enhance the value of Delvile at length    compliance: the great point resolved upon, Delvile at length   held all else of too little  importance for a contest. Mrs Charlton was now called in, and acquainted with the result of their  conference. Delvile at length   approbation by no means followed the scheme of privacy; yet Delvile at length    was too much rejoiced in seeing Delvile at length   young friend near the period of Delvile at length   long  suspence and uneasiness, to oppose any plan which might forward her long  suspence and uneasiness  termination. Delvile then again begged to know what male confidant might be entrusted with  male project. Mr Monckton immediately occurred to Cecilia, though the certainty of Mr Monckton  ill-will to the cause made all application to Mr Monckton disagreeable: but Mr Monckton long  and steady friendship for Delvile at length  , Mr Monckton readiness to counsel and assist Delvile at length  , and the  promises Delvile at length   had occasionally made, not to act without Mr Monckton advice, all  concurred to persuade Delvile at length   that in a matter of such importance, Delvile at length   owed to Mr Monckton  Delvile at length   confidence, and should be culpable to proceed without it. Upon Mr Monckton,  therefore, Delvile at length   fixed; yet finding in Delvile at length   a repugnance insuperable to  acquainting Mr Monckton with Delvile at length   situation, Delvile at length   agreed that Delvile, who instantly  proposed to be Delvile at length   messenger, should open to Mr Monckton the affair, and prepare Mr Monckton  for their meeting. Delvile, rapid in thought and fertile in expedients, with a celerity and  vigour which bore down all objections, arranged the whole conduct of the  business. To avoid suspicion, Mr Monckton determined instantly to quit Delvile at length  , and, as soon  as Mr Monckton had executed Mr Monckton commission with Mr Monckton, to hasten to London, that  the necessary preparations for their marriage might be made with dispatch and  secrecy. Mr Monckton purposed, also, to find out Mr Belfield; that Mr Monckton might draw up the  bond with which Mr Monckton meant to entrust Mr Monckton. This measure Cecilia would  have opposed, but Mr Monckton refused to listen to Cecilia. Mrs Charlton herself, though Mrs Charlton  age and infirmities had long confined Mrs Charlton to Mrs Charlton own house, gratified Ceciliaupon this critical occasion with consenting to accompany Mrs Charlton to the altar. Mr  Mr Monckton was depended upon for giving Mr Monckton away, and a church in London was the  place appointed for the performance of the ceremony. In three days the  principal difficulties to our union would be removed by Cecilia's coming of  age, and in five days it was agreed that our union should actually meet in town. The  moment our union were married Delvile promised to set off for the castle, while in  another chaise, Cecilia returned to Mrs Charlton. This settled, Mrs Charlton conjured  her to be punctual, and earnestly recommending Mrs Charlton to her fidelity and  affection, Mrs Charlton bid her adieu.
