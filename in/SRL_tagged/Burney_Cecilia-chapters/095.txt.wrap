 Cecilia's earliest care, almost at break of day, was to send to the Grove; from  thence she heard nothing but evil; Mr Monckton was still alive, but with little  or no hope of recovery, constantly delirious, and talking of Miss Beverley, and  of her being married to young Delvile. Cecilia, who knew well this, at least, was no delirium, though shocked that he  talked of it, hoped his danger less than was apprehended. The next day, however, more fatal news was brought her, though not from the  quarter she expected it: Mr Monckton, in one of his raving fits, had sent for  Lady Margaret to his bed side, and used her almost inhumanly: he had railed at  her age and her infirmities with incredible fury, called her the cause of all  his sufferings, and accused her as the immediate agent of Lucifer in his  present wound and danger. Lady Margaret, whom neither jealousy nor malignity  had cured of loving him, was dismayed and affrighted; and in hurrying out of  the room upon his attempting, in his frenzy, to strike her, she dropt down dead  in an apoplectic fit. "Good Heaven!" thought Cecilia, "what an exemplary punishment has this man! he  loses his hated wife at the very moment when her death could no longer answer  his purposes! Poor Lady Margaret! her life has been as bitter as her temper!  married from a view of interest, ill used as a bar to happiness, and destroyed  from the fruitless ravings of despair!" She wrote all this intelligence to Ostend, whence she received a letter from  Delvile, acquainting her he was detained from proceeding further by the  weakness and illness of his mother, whose sufferings from seasickness had  almost put an end to her existence. Thus passed a miserable week; Monckton still merely alive, Delvile detained at  Ostend, and Cecilia tortured alike by what was recently passed, actually  present, and fearfully expected; when one morning she was told a gentleman upon  business desired immediately to speak with her. She hastily obeyed the summons; the constant image of her own mind, Delvile,  being already present to her, and a thousand wild conjectures upon what had  brought him back, rapidly occurring to her. Her expectations, however, were ill answered, for she found an entire stranger;  an elderly man, of no pleasant aspect or manners. She desired to know his business. "I presume, madam, you are the lady of this house?" She bowed an assent. "May I take the liberty, madam, to ask your name?' "My name, sir?" "You will do me a favour, madam, by telling it me." "Is it possible you are come hither without already knowing it?" "I know it only by common report, madam." "Common report, sir, I believe is seldom wrong in a matter where to be right is  so easy." "Have you any objection, madam, to telling me your name?" "No, sir; but your business can hardly be very important, if you are yet to  learn whom you are to address. It will be time enough, therefore, for us to  meet when you are elsewhere satisfied in this point." She would then have left the room. "I beg, madam," cried the stranger, "you will have patience; it is necessary,  before I can open my business, that I should hear your name from yourself." "Well, sir," cried she with some hesitation, "you can scarce have come to this  house, without knowing that its owner is Cecilia Beverley." "That, madam, is your maiden name." "My maiden name?" cried she, starting. "Are you not married, madam?" "Married, sir?" she repeated, while her cheeks were the colour of scarlet. "It is, properly, therefore, madam, the name of your husband that I mean to  ask." "And by what authority, sir," cried she, equally astonished and offended, "do  you make these extraordinary enquiries?" "I am deputed, madam, to wait upon you by Mr Eggleston, the next heir to this  estate, by your uncle's will, if you die without children, or change your name  when you marry. His authority of enquiry, madam, I presume you will allow, and  he has vested it in me by a letter of attorney." Cecilia's distress and confusion were now unspeakable; she knew not what to own  or deny, she could not conjecture how she had been betrayed, and she had never  made the smallest preparation against such an attack. "Mr Eggleston, madam," he continued, "has been pretty credibly informed that  you are actually married: he is very desirous, therefore, to know what are your  intentions, for your continuing to be called Miss Beverley, as if still single,  leaves him quite in the dark: but, as he is so deeply concerned in the affair,  he expects, as a lady of honour, you will deal with him without prevarication." "This demand, sir," said Cecilia, stammering, "is so extremely—so—so little  expected—" "The way, madam, in these cases, is to keep pretty closely to the point; are  you married or are you not?" Cecilia, quite confounded, made no answer: to disavow her marriage, when thus  formally called upon, was every way unjustifiable; to acknowledge it in her  present situation, would involve her in difficulties innumerable. "This is not, madam, a slight thing; Mr Eggleston has a large family and a  small fortune, and that, into the bargain, very much encumbered; it cannot,  therefore, be expected that he will knowingly connive at cheating himself, by  submitting to your being actually married, and still enjoying your estate  though your husband does not take your name." Cecilia, now, summoning more presence of mind, answered, "Mr Eggleston, sir,  has, at least, nothing to fear from imposition: those with whom he has, or may  have any transactions in this affair, are not accustomed to practice it." "I am far from meaning any offence, madam; my commission from Mr Eggleston is  simply this, to beg you will satisfy him upon what grounds you now evade the  will of your late uncle, which, till cleared up, appears a point manifestly to  his prejudice." "Tell him, then, sir, that whatever he wishes to know shall be explained to him  in about a week. At present I can give no other answer." "Very well, madam; he will wait that time, I am sure, for he does not wish to  put you to any inconvenience. But when he heard the gentleman was gone abroad  without owning his marriage, he thought it high time to take some notice of the  matter." Cecilia, who by this speech found she was every way discovered, was again in  the utmost confusion, and with much trepidation, said, "since you seem so well,  sir, acquainted with this affair, I should be glad you would inform me by what  means you came to the knowledge of it?" "I heard it, madam, from Mr Eggleston himself, who has long known it." "Long, sir?—impossible! when it is not yet a fortnight—not ten days, or no  more, that—-" She stopt, recollecting she was making a confession better deferred. "That, madam," he answered, "may perhaps bear a little contention: for when  this business comes to be settled, it will be very essential to be exact as to  the time, even to the very hour; for a large income per annum, divides into a  small one per diem: and if your husband keeps his own name, you must not only  give up your uncle's inheritance from the time of relinquishing yours, but  refund from the very day of your marriage." "There is not the least doubt of it," answered she; "nor will the smallest  difficulty be made." "You will please, then, to recollect, madam, that this sum is every hour  encreasing; and has been since last September, which made half a year  accountable for last March. Since then there is now added—-" "Good Heaven, Sir," cried Cecilia, "what calculation are you making out? do you  call last week last September?" "No, madam; but I call last September the month in which you were married." "You will find yourself, then, sir, extremely mistaken; and Mr Eggleston is  preparing himself for much disappointment, if he supposes me so long in arrears  with him." "Mr Eggleston, madam, happens to be well informed of this transaction, as, if  there is any dispute in it, you will find. He was your immediate successor in  the house to which you went last September in Pall-Mall; the woman who kept it  acquainted his servants that the last lady who hired it stayed with her but a  day, and only came to town, she found, to be married: and hearing, upon  enquiry, this lady was Miss Beverley, the servants, well knowing that their  master was her conditional heir, told him the circumstance." "You will find all this, sir, end in nothing." "That, madam, as I said before, remains to be proved. If a young lady at eight  o'clock in the morning, is seen,—and she was seen, going into a church with a  young gentleman, and one female friend; and is afterwards observed to come out  of it, followed by a clergyman and another person, supposed to have officiated  as father, and is seen get into a coach with same young gentleman, and same  female friend, why the circumstances are pretty strong!—" "They may seem so, Sir; but all conclusions drawn from them will be erroneous.  I was not married then, upon my honour!" "We have little, madam, to do with professions; the circumstances are strong  enough to bear a trial, and—" "A trial!—" "We have traced, madam, many witnesses able to stand to divers particulars; and  eight months share of such an estate as this, is well worth a little trouble." "I am amazed, sir! surely Mr Eggleston never desired you to make use of this  language to me?" "Mr Eggleston, madam, has behaved very honourably; though he knew the whole  affair so long ago, he was persuaded Mr Delvile had private reasons for a short  concealment; and expecting every day when they would be cleared up by his  taking your name, he never interfered: but being now informed he set out last  week for the continent, he has been advised by his friends to claim his rights." "That claim, sir, he need not fear will be satisfied; and without any occasion  for threats of enquiries or law suits." "The truth, madam, is this; Mr Eggleston is at present in a little difficulty  about some money matters, which makes it a point with him of some consequence  to have the affair settled speedily: unless you could conveniently compromise  the matter, by advancing a particular sum, till it suits you to refund the  whole that is due to him, and quit the premises." "Nothing, sir, is due to him! at least, nothing worth mentioning. I shall enter  into no terms, for I have no compromise to make. As to the premises, I will  quit them with all the expedition in my power." "You will do well, madam; for the truth is, it will not be convenient to him to  wait much longer." He then went away. "When, next," cried Cecilia, "shall I again be weak, vain, blind enough to form  any plan with a hope of secresy? or enter, with any hope, into a clandestine  scheme! betrayed by those I have trusted, discovered by those I have not  thought of, exposed to the cruellest alarms, and defenceless from the most  shocking attacks!—Such has been the life I have led since the moment I first  consented to a private engagement!—Ah Delvile! your mother, in her  tenderness, forgot her dignity, or she would not have concurred in an action  which to such disgrace made me liable!"
