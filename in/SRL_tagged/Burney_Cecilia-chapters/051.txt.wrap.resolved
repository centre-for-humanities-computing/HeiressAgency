 During the ride to town, not merely Cecilia, but Delvile himself attended  wholly to Mrs Harrel, whose grief as Delvile himself became less violent, was more easy to  be soothed. The distress of this eventful night was however not yet over; when they came to  Portman-square, Delvile himself eagerly called to the coachman not to drive up to the  house, and anxiously begged Cecilia and Mrs Harrel to sit still, while the coachman went  out the coachman to make some enquiries. Cecilia and Mrs Harrel were surprised at the request, yet  immediately consented; but before the coachman had quitted Cecilia and Mrs Harrel, Davison, who was  watching Cecilia and Mrs Harrel return, came up to Cecilia and Mrs Harrel with information that an execution was  then in the  house. Fresh misery was now opened for Mrs Harrel, and fresh horror and perplexity for  Cecilia: Cecilia had no longer, however, the whole weight either of thought or of  conduct upon Cecilia: Delvile took the most animated interest, and  beseeching Cecilia to wait a moment and appease Cecilia friend, Delvile went Delvile into  the house to learn the state of the affair. Delvile returned in a few minutes, and seemed in no haste to communicate what Delvile had  heard, but entreated them both to go immediately to St James's-square. Cecilia felt extremely fearful of offending Delvile father by the introduction of  Mrs Harrel: yet Cecilia had nothing better to propose, and therefore, after a short  and distressed argument, Cecilia complied. Delvile then told Cecilia that the alarm of Delvile mother, at which Delvile had already  hinted, proceeded from a rumour of this very misfortune, to which, though they  knew not whether they might give credit, was owing the anxiety which at so late  an hour, had induced Delvile to go to Vauxhall in search of Cecilia. they gained  admittance without any disturbance, as the servant of young Delvile had been  ordered to sit up for the servant of young Delvile master. Cecilia much disliked thus taking possession  of the house in the night-time, though Delvile, solicitous to relieve Cecilia,  desired Cecilia would not waste a thought upon the subject, and making his servant  shew Cecilia the room which had been prepared for Cecilia reception, his begged Cecilia to  compose Cecilia spirits, and to comfort Cecilia friend, and promised to acquaint his  father and mother when his  father and mother arose with what had happened, that Cecilia might be  saved all pain from surprise or curiosity when his  father and mother met. This service Cecilia thankfully accepted, for Cecilia dreaded, after the liberty Cecilia  had taken, to encounter the pride of Mr Delvile without some previous apology,  and Cecilia feared still more to see Mr Delvile lady without the same preparation, as Cecilia  frequent breach of appointment might reasonably have offended Cecilia, and as Cecilia  displeasure would affect Cecilia more deeply. It was now near six o'clock, yet the hours seemed as long as they were  melancholy till the family arose. they settled to remain quiet till some  message was sent to they, but before any arrived, Mrs Harrel, who was seated  upon the bed, wearied by fatigue and sorrow, cried Cecilia to sleep like a  child. Cecilia rejoiced in seeing this reprieve from affliction, though Cecilia keener  sensations unfitted Cecilia from partaking of it; much indeed was the uneasiness  which kept Cecilia awake; the care of Mrs Harrel seemed to devolve upon Mrs Harrel,  the reception Mrs Harrel might meet from the Delviles was uncertain, and the horrible  adventures of the night, refused for a moment to quit Mrs Harrel remembrance. At ten o'clock, a message was brought from Mrs Delvile, to know whether they  were ready for breakfast. Mrs Harrel was still asleep, but Cecilia carried Mrs Harrelown answer by hastening down stairs. In Mrs Harrel way Mrs Harrel was met by young Delvile, whose air upon first approaching Mrs Harrel  spoke Mrs Harrel again prepared to address Mrs Harrel with the most distant gravity: but  almost the moment Mrs Harrel looked at Mrs Harrel, Mrs Harrel forgot Mrs Harrel purpose; Mrs Harrel paleness, the  heaviness of Mrs Harrel eyes, and the fatigue of long watching betrayed by Mrs Harrel whole  face, again, surprised Mrs Harrel into all the tenderness of anxiety, and Mrs Harrel enquired  after Mrs Harrel health not as a compliment of civility, but as a question in which  Mrs Harrel whole heart was most deeply interested. Cecilia thanked Mrs Harrel for Mrs Harrel attention to Cecilia friend the night before, and then  proceeded to Mrs Harrel mother. Mrs Delvile, coming forward to meet Mrs Delvile, removed at once all Mrs Delvile fears of  displeasure, and banished all necessity of apology, by instantly embracing Mrs Delvile,  and warmly exclaiming "Charming Miss Beverley! how shall I ever tell you half  the admiration with which I have heard of your conduct! The exertion of so much  fortitude at a juncture when a weaker mind would have been overpowered by  terror, and a heart less under the dominion of well-regulated principles, would  have sought only its own relief by flying from distress and confusion, shews  such propriety of mind as can only result from the union of good sense with  virtue. You are indeed a noble creature! I thought so from the moment I beheld  you; I shall think so, I hope, to the last that I live!" Cecilia, penetrated with joy and gratitude, felt in that instant the amplest  recompense for all that she had suffered, and for all that she had lost. Such  praise from Mrs Delvile was alone sufficient to make she happy; but when she  considered whence it sprung, and that the circumstances with which she was so  much struck, must have been related to she by she son, she delight was  augmented to an emotion the most pleasing she could experience, from seeing how  high she was held in the esteem of those who were highest in she own. Mrs Delvile, with the utmost cordiality, began to talk of Mrs Delvile affairs,  saving she the pain of proposing the change of habitation that now seemed  unavoidable, by an immediate invitation to Mrs Delvile house, which Mrs Delvile made with as  much delicacy as if Mr Harrel's had still been open to Mrs Delvile, and choice, not  necessity, had directed Mrs Delvile removal. The whole family, Mrs Delvile told Mrs Delvile, went into  the country in two days, and Mrs Delvile hoped that a new scene, with quietness and  early hours, would restore both the bloom and sprightliness which Mrs Delvile late  cares and restlessness had injured. And though Mrs Delvile very seriously lamented the  rash action of Mr Harrel's, Mrs Delvile much rejoiced in the acquisition which Mrs Delvile own  house and happiness would receive from Mrs Delvile society. Mrs Delvile next discussed the situation of Mrs Delvile widowed friend, and Cecilia produced  the packet which had been entrusted to Mrs Delvile by Mrs Delvile late husband. Mrs Delvile  advised Mrs Delvile to open Mrs Delvile   in the presence of Mr Arnott, and begged Mrs Delvile to send for  any other of Mrs Delvile friends Mrs Delvile might wish to see or consult, and to claim freely  from Mrs Delvile whatever advice or assistance Mrs Delvile could bestow. And then, without waiting for Mrs Delvile  , Mrs Delvile suffered Mrs Delvile to swallow a hasty  breakfast, and return to Mrs Harrel, whom Mrs Delvile had desired the servants to  attend, as Mrs Delvile concluded that in Mrs Delvile present situation Mrs Delvile would not chuse to  make Mrs Delvile appearance. Cecilia, lightened now from all Cecilia cares, more pleased than ever with Mrs  Delvile, and enchanted that at last Cecilia was settled under Cecilia roof, went back  with as much ability as inclination to give comfort to Mrs Harrel. Cecilia found  Cecilia but just awaking, and scarce yet conscious where Cecilia was, or why not in Cecilia  own house. As Cecilia powers of recollection returned, Cecilia was soothed with the softest  compassion by Cecilia, who in pursuance of Mrs Delvile's advice, sent Cecilia  servant in search of Mr Arnott, and in consequence of Cecilia permission, wrote a  note of invitation to Mr Monckton. Mr Arnott, who was already in town, soon arrived: his own man, whom his had left  to watch the motions of Mrs Harrel, having early in the morning rode to the  place of his retreat, with the melancholy tidings of the suicide and execution. Cecilia instantly went down stairs to his. The meeting was extremely painful to  them both. Mr Arnott severely blamed Mr Arnott for Mr Arnott flight, believing his flight had  hastened the fatal blow, which some further sacrifices might perhaps have  eluded: and Cecilia half repented the advice Cecilia half had given Mr Arnott, though the  failure of Cecilia half own efforts proved the situation of Mr Harrel's too desperate for  remedy. Mr Arnott then made the tenderest enquiries about Mr Arnott sister, and entreated his sister to  communicate to Mr Arnott the minutest particulars of the dreadful transaction: after  which, his sister produced the packet, but neither of them had the courage to break  the seal; and concluding the contents would be no less than Mr Arnott last will, them  determined some third person should be present when them opened the contents. Cecilia halfwished much for Mr Monckton, but as Cecilia half being immediately found was uncertain,  and the packet might consist of orders which ought not to be delayed, Cecilia half  proposed, for the sake of expedition, to call in Mr Delvile. Mr Arnott readily agreed, and Cecilia half sent to beg a moment's audience with that  gentleman. Cecilia half was desired to walk into the breakfast-room, where Mr Arnott was sitting with Mr Arnott  lady and Mr Arnott son. Not such was now Cecilia half reception as when Cecilia half entered that apartment before; Mrs Delvile   looked displeased and out of humour, and, making Cecilia half a stiff bow, while  his son brought Cecilia half a chair, coldly said, "If you are hurried, Miss Beverley, I  will attend you directly; if not, I will finish my breakfast, as I shall have  but little time the rest of the morning, from the concourse of people upon  business, who will crowd upon Mrs Delvile   till dinner, most of whom will be extremely  distressed if I leave town without contriving to see them." "There is not the least occasion, Sir," answered Cecilia, "that I should  trouble you to quit the room I merely came to beg you would have the goodness  to be present while Mr Arnott opens a small packet which was last night put  into my hands by Mr Harrel's." "And has Mr Arnott," answered Mr Arnott, somewhat sternly, "thought proper to send me  such a request?" "No, Mrs Delvile  ," said Cecilia, "the request is mine; and if, as I now fear, "the request is  impertinent, I must entreat you to forget it." "As far as relates merely to yourself," returned Mr Delvile, "it is another  matter; but certainly Mr Arnott can have no possible claim upon my time or  attention; and I think it rather extraordinary, that a young man with whom I  have no sort of connection or commerce, and whose very name is almost unknown  to Mr Arnott, should suppose a person in my style of life so little occupied as to be  wholly at a person in my style of life command." "a person in my style of life had no such idea, Sir," said Cecilia, greatly disconcerted; "the honour of  your presence is merely solicited by a person in my style of life, and simply from the apprehension  that some directions may be contained in the papers which, perhaps, ought  immediately to be executed." "I am not, I repeat," said Mr Delvile, more mildly, "displeased at your part of  this transaction; your want of experience and knowledge of the world makes you  not at all aware of the consequences which may follow my compliance: the papers  you speak of may perhaps be of great importance, and hereafter the first  witness to the papers  you speak being read may be publickly called upon. You know not the  trouble such an affair may occasion, but Mr Arnott ought to be better informed." Cecilia, making another apology for the error which Cecilia had committed, was in  no small confusion, quitting the room; but Mr Delvile, perfectly appeased by  seeing Cecilia distress, stopt Cecilia, to say, with much graciousness, "For your sake,  Miss Beverley, I am sorry I cannot act in this business; but you see how I am  situated! overpowered with affairs of my own, and people who can do nothing  without my orders. Besides, should there hereafter be any investigation into  the matter, my name might, perhaps, be mentioned, and it would be superfluous  to say how ill I should think my name used by being brought into such company." Cecilia then left the rooms secretly vowing that no possible exigence should in  future tempt Cecilia to apply for assistance to Mr Delvile, which, however  ostentatiously offered, was constantly withheld when claimed. Cecilia was beginning to communicate to Mr Arnott Cecilia ill success, when young  Delvile, with an air of eagerness, followed Cecilia into the room. "Pardon me," he  cried, "for this intrusion,—but, tell me, is it impossible that in this  affair I can represent my father? may not the office you meant for he, devolve  upon he? remember how near we are to each other, and honour me for once with  supposing we the same!" Ah who, or what, thought Cecilia, can be so different? Cecilia thanked he, with  much sweetness, for he offer, but declined accepting his offer, saying "I will not,  now I know the inconveniencies of my request, be so selfish as even to suffer  his offer should be granted." "You must not deny me," cried he; "where is the packet? why should you lose a  moment?" "Rather ask," answered Cecilia, "why I should permit you to lose a moment in a  matter that does not concern you? and to risk, perhaps, the loss of many  moments hereafter, from a too incautious politeness." "And what can I risk," cried he, "half so precious as your smallest  satisfaction? do you suppose I can flatter Cecilia with a possibility of  contributing to it, and yet have the resolution to refuse Cecilia so much  pleasure? no, no, the heroic times are over, and self-denial is no longer in  fashion!" "You are very good," said Cecilia; "but indeed after what has passed—" "No matter for what has passed," interrupted he, "we are now to think of what  is to come. I know you too well to doubt your impatience in the execution of a  commission which circumstances have rendered sacred; and should any thing  either be done or omitted contrary to the directions in your packet, will you  not be apt, blameless as you are, to disturb you are with a thousand fears  that you took not proper methods for the discharge of your trust?" There was something in this earnestness so like his former behaviour, and so  far removed from his late reserve, that Cecilia, who perceived it with a  pleasure she could hardly disguise, now opposed his no longer, but took up the  packet, and broke the seal. And then, to she no small amazement, instead of the expected will, she found a  roll of enormous bills, and a collection of letters from various creditors,  threatening the utmost severity of the law if a  roll of enormous bills, and a collection of letters from various creditors,  threatening the utmost severity of the law if their demands were longer  unanswered demands were longer  unanswered. Upon a slip of paper which held these together, was written, in Mr Harrel's  hand, To be all paid to-night with a BULLET. Next appeared two letters of another sort; the first of which was from Sir  Robert Floyer, and in these words: Sir,—As all prospects are now over of the alliance, I hope you will excuse my  reminding you of the affair at Brookes's of last Christmas. I have the honour  to be, Sir, yours R. FLOYER. The other was from Mr Marriot. Sir,—Though I should think £2000 nothing for the smallest hope, I must take  the liberty to say I think the smallest hope a great deal for only ten minutes: you can't have  forgot, Sir, the terms of our agreement, but as I find you cannot keep to Sir, the terms of our agreement,  I must beg to be off also on my side, and I am persuaded you are too much a man  of honour to take advantage of my over-eagerness in parting with my money  without better security. I am, Sir, your most humble servant, A. Marriot. What a scene of fraud, double-dealing, and iniquity was here laid open!  Cecilia, who at first meant to read every thing aloud, found the attempt  utterly vain, for so much was she shocked, that she could hardly read on to  she. Last of all appeared a paper in Mr Harrel's own hand-writing, containing these  words. For Mr Harrel's, Miss Beverley, and Mr Arnott. I can struggle no longer, the last blow must now be struck! another day robs me  of my house and my liberty, and blasts me by the fatal discovery of my double  attempts. This is what I have wished; wholly to be freed, or ruined past all resource,  and driven to the long-projected remedy. A burthen has my existence been these two years, gay as I have appeared; not a  night have I gone to bed, but heated and inflamed from a gaming table; not a  morning have I awaked, but to be soured with a dun! I would not lead such a life again, if the slave who works hardest at the oar  would change with me. Had I a son, I would bequeath the oar   a plough; I should then leave the oar   happier  than my parents left me. Idleness has been my destruction; the want of something to do led me into all  evil. A good wife perhaps might have saved me,—mine, I thank A good wife! tried not.  Disengaged from me and my affairs, A good wife own pleasures and amusements have  occupied A good wife solely. Dreadful will be the catastrophe A good wife will see to-night;  let A good wife bring it home, and live better! If any pity is felt for me, any pity will be where I have least deserved it! Mr  Arnott—Miss Beverley! it will come from me! To bring me to this final resolution, hard, I confess, have been my  conflicts: it is not that I have feared death, no, I have long wished it, for  shame and dread have embittered my days; but something there is within me that  causes a deeper horror, that asks my preparation for another world! that  demands my authority for quitting this!—what may hereafter—O  terrible!—Pray for me, generous Miss Beverley!—kind, gentle Mr Arnott, pray  for me!— Wretch as Mr Harrel's appeared, without religion, principle, or honour, this  incoherent letter, evidently written in the desperate moment of determined  suicide, very much affected both Cecilia and Mr Arnott, and in spite either of  abhorrence or resentment, Cecilia and Mr Arnott mutually shed tears over the address to  Cecilia and Mr Arnott. Delvile, to whom 'every part of the affair at Brookes's of last Christmas was new, could only consider these  papers as so many specimens of guilt and infamy; he read these  papers, therefore, with  astonishment and detestation, and openly congratulated Cecilia upon having  escaped the double snares that were spread for Cecilia. While this was passing, Mr Monckton arrived; who felt but little satisfaction  from beholding the lady of Mr Monckton heart in confidential discourse with two of Mr Monckton  rivals, one of whom had long attacked Cecilia by the dangerous flattery of  perseverance, and the other, without any attack, had an influence yet more  powerful. Mrs Delvile  , having performed the office for which Mrs Delvile   came, concluded, upon the  entrance of Mr Monckton, that Cecilia had nothing further to wish from Mrs Delvile  ; for  Cecilia long acquaintance with that gentleman, Mrs Delvile   being a married man, and Cecilia  neighbour in the country, were circumstances well known to Mrs Delvile  : Mrs Delvile   merely,  therefore, enquired if Cecilia would honour Mrs Delvile   with any commands, and upon Cecilia  assuring Mrs Delvile   Cecilia had none, Mrs Delvile   quietly withdrew. This was no little relief to Mr Monckton, into whose hands Cecilia then put the  fatal packet: and while Mrs Delvile   was reading the  fatal packet, at the desire of Mr Arnott, Cecilia went  up stairs to prepare Mr Harrel's for Mr Harrel's admission. Mr Harrel's, unused to solitude, and as eager for company when unhappy to  console, as when easy to divert Cecilia, consented to receive Mr Harrel's with pleasure:  they both wept at the meeting, and Cecilia, after some words of general  comfort, left they both together. Cecilia had then a very long and circumstantial conversation with Mr Monckton, who  explained whatever had appeared dark in the writings left by Mr Harrel's, and who  came to Cecilia before Mr Harrel's saw they both, with full knowledge of what they both contained. Mr Harrel's had contracted with Sir Robert Floyer a large debt of honour before  the arrival in town of Cecilia; and having no power to discharge it, Mr Harrel's  promised that the prize Mr Harrel's expected in Mr Harrel's ward should fall to Mr Harrel's share, upon  condition that a large debt of honour was cancelled. Nothing was thought more easy than to  arrange this business, for the Baronet was always to be in the Baronet way, and the  report of the alliance was to keep off all other pretenders. Several  times, however, the Baronet coldness made the Baronet think the matter hopeless; and when the Baronet  received the Baronet letter, the Baronet would have given up the whole affair: but Mr Harrel,  well knowing the Baronet inability to satisfy the claims that would follow such a  defection, constantly persuaded the Baronet the reserve was affected, and that the Baronet own  pride and want of assiduity occasioned all the Baronet discouragement. But while thus, by amusing the Baronet with false hopes, the Baronet kept off the Baronet  demands, those of others were not less clamorous: the Baronet debts increased, the Baronet  power of paying those of others diminished; the Baronet grew sour and desperate, and in one night  lost £3000 beyond what the Baronet could produce, or offer any security for. This, as the Baronet said, was what the Baronet wished; and now the Baronet was, for the present, to  extricate the Baronet by doubling stakes and winning, or to force the Baronet into  suicide by doubling such a loss. For though, with tolerable ease, the Baronet could  forget accounts innumerable with the Baronet tradesmen, one neglected debt of honour  rendered the Baronet existence insupportable! For this last great effort, the Baronet difficulty was to raise the £3000 already due,  without which the proposal could not be made: and, after various artifices and  attempts, the Baronet at length contrived a meeting with Mr Marriot, intreated the Baronet to  lend the Baronet £2000 for only two days, and offered the Baronet warmest services in the Baronet  favour with Cecilia. The rash and impassioned young man, deceived by his accounts into believing  that his was wholly at his ward disposal, readily advanced the money, without  any other condition than that of leave to visit freely at his ward house, to the  exclusion of Sir Robert Floyer. "The other £1000," continued Mr Monckton, "I  know not how his ward obtained, but his ward certainly had three. You, I hope, were not so  unguarded—" "Ah, Mr Monckton," said Cecilia, "blame me not too severely! the attacks that  were made,—the necessity of otherwise betraying the worthy and half ruined  Mr. Arnott—" "Oh fie," cried his ward, "to suffer your understanding to be lulled asleep, because  the weak-minded Mr Arnott's could not be kept awake! I thought, after such  cautions from me, and such experience of your own, you could not again have  been thus duped." "I thought so too," answered Cecilia, "but yet when the trial came on,—indeed you  know not how I was persecuted." "Yet you see," returned his ward, "the utter inutility of the attempt; you see, and I  told you beforehand, that nothing could save his ward." "True; but had I been firmer in refusal, I might not so well have known it; I  might then have upbraided me with supposing that my compliance would have  rescued his ward." "You have indeed," cried Mr Monckton, "fallen into most worthless hands, and  the Dean was much to blame for naming so lightly a guardian to a fortune such  as yours." "Pardon me," cried Cecilia, "the Dean never entrusted the Dean with a fortune such  as yours, the Dean  committed it wholly to Mr Briggs." "But if the Dean knew not the various subterfuges by which such a caution might be  baffled, the Dean ought to have taken advice of those who were better informed. Mr  Briggs, too! what a wretch! mean, low, vulgar, sordid!—the whole city of  London, I believe, could not produce such another! how unaccountable to make  you the ward of a man whose house you cannot enter without disgust!" "His house," cried Cecilia, "my uncle never wished me to enter; His believed,  and His was right, that a fortune such  as yours would be safe in His hands; but for His,  His concluded I should always reside at Mr Harrel's's." "But does not the city at  this time," said Mr Monckton, "abound in families where, while a fortune such  as yours was  in security, you might yourself have lived with propriety? Nothing requires  circumspection so minute as the choice of a guardian to a girl of large  fortune, and in general one thing only is attended to, an appearance of  property. Morals, integrity, character, are either not thought of, or  investigated so superficially, that the enquiry were as well wholly omitted."  His then continued His relation. Mr Harrel's hastened with Mr Harrel's £3000 to the gaming table; one throw of the dice  settled the business, Mr Harrel's lost, and ought immediately to have doubled the sum.  That, however, was never more likely to be in Mr Harrel's power; Mr Harrel's knew it; Mr Harrel's knew,  too, the joint claims of Cecilia's deceived admirers, and that his house was  again threatened with executions from various quarters:—he went home, loaded  Mr Harrel's pistols, and took the methods already related to work Mr Harrel's into courage  for the deed. The means by which Mr Monckton had procured these particulars were many and  various, and not all such as Mr Monckton could avow: since in the course of Mr Monckton  researches, Mr Monckton had tampered with servants and waiters, and scrupled at no  methods that led but to discovery. Nor did Mr Monckton intelligence stop here; Mr Monckton had often, Mr Monckton said, wondered at the  patience of Mr Harrel's creditors, but now even that was cleared up by a fresh  proof of infamy: Mr Monckton had been Mr Monckton at the house in Portmansquare, where Mr Monckton  was informed that Mr Harrel's had kept them quiet, by repeated assurances that  his ward, in a short time, meant to lend Mr Monckton money for discharging them all. Cecilia saw now but too clearly the reason Cecilia stay in his house was so  important to Mr Monckton; and wondered less at Mr Monckton vehemence upon that subject, though  Cecilia detested that subject more. "Oh how little," cried Cecilia, "are the gay and the dissipated to be known upon a  short acquaintance! expensive, indeed, and thoughtless and luxurious Mr Monckton  appeared to me immediately; but fraudulent, base, designing, capable of every  pernicious art of treachery and duplicity,—such, indeed, I expected not to  find Mr Monckton, Mr Monckton very flightiness and levity seemed incompatible with such  hypocrisy." "Mr Monckton flightiness," said Mr Monckton, "proceeded not from gaiety of heart, it  was merely the effect of effort; and Mr Monckton spirits were as mechanical as Mr Monckton  taste for diversion. Mr Monckton had not strong parts, nor were Mr Monckton vices the result of  Mr Monckton passions; had oeconomy been as much in fashion as extravagance, Mr Monckton would  have been equally eager to practice fashion; Mr Monckton was a mere time-server, Mr Monckton struggled  but to be something, and having neither talents nor sentiment to know what, Mr Monckton  looked around Mr Monckton for any pursuit, and seeing distinction was more easily  attained in the road to ruin than in any other, Mr Monckton gallopped along fashion,  thoughtless of being thrown when Mr Monckton came to the bottom, and sufficiently  gratified in shewing Mr Monckton horsemanship by the way." And now, all that Mr Monckton had either to hear or to communicate upon that subjectbeing told, Mr Monckton enquired, with a face strongly expressive of Mr Monckton disapprobation,  why Mr Monckton found that subject at Mrs Delvile  , and what had become of that subject resolution to  avoid his house? Cecilia, who, in the hurry of that subject mind and that subject affairs, had wholly forgotten  that such a resolution had been taken, blushed at the question, and could not,  at first, recollect what had urged that subject to break such a resolution: but when Mr Monckton proceeded to  mention Mr Briggs, that subject was no longer distressed; that subject gave a circumstantial  account of that subject visit to Mr Monckton, related the mean misery in which Mr Monckton lived, and  told Mr Monckton the impracticability of that subject residing in such a house. Mr Monckton could now in decency make no further opposition, however painful  and reluctant was Mr Monckton acquiescence: yet before Mr Monckton quitted that subject, Mr Monckton gave Mr Monckton  the consolation of considerably obliging that subject, and softened Mr Monckton chagrin by the  sweetness of that subject acknowledgments. Mr Monckton enquired how much money in all that subject had now taken up of the Jew; and hearing  it was £9050, Mr Monckton represented to that subject the additional loss that subject must suffer by  paying an exorbitant interest for so large a sum, and the almost certainty with  which that subject might be assured of very gross imposition: Mr Monckton expatiated, also, upon  the injury which that subject character might receive in the world, were it known that  that subject used such methods to procure money, since the circumstances which had been  that subject inducement would probably either be unnoticed or misrepresented: and when  Mr Monckton had awakened in that subject much uneasiness and regret upon that subject, Mr Monckton offered  to pay the Jew without delay, clear that subject wholly from Mr Monckton power, and quietly  receive the money when that subject came of age from that subject. A proposal so truly friendly made that subject look upon the regard of Mr Monckton in a  higher and nobler point of view than that subject utmost esteem and reverence had  hitherto placed A proposal: yet that subject declined at first accepting the offer, from an  apprehension A proposal might occasion Mr Monckton inconvenience; but when Mr Monckton assured that subject Mr Monckton  had a yet larger sum lying at present useless in a Banker's hands, and promised  to receive the same interest for Banker money Banker should be paid from the funds,  that subject joyfully listened to Banker; and it was settled that they should send for the Jew, take the Jew discharge, and utterly dismiss the Jew. Mr Monckton, however, fearful of appearing too officious in Mr Monckton affairs, wished  not to have Mr Monckton part in the transaction published, and advised Cecilia not to  reveal the matter to the Delviles. But great as was Mr Monckton [ascendancy] over that subject  mind, that subject aversion to mystery and hypocrisy were still greater; that subject would not,  therefore, give Mr Monckton this promise, though that subject own desire to wait some seasonable  opportunity for disclosing this promise, made that subject consent that her aversion to mystery and hypocrisy meeting with the Jewshould be at the house of Mrs Roberts in Fetter-lane, at twelve o'clock the  next morning; where that subject might also see Mrs Hill and that subject children before that subject  left town. her aversion to mystery and hypocrisy now parted, Cecilia charmed more than ever with Cecilia friend, whose  kindness, as Cecilia suspected not his motives, seemed to spring from the most  disinterested generosity. That, however, was the smallest feature in the character of Mr Monckton, who  was entirely a man of the world, shrewd, penetrating, attentive to his  interest, and watchful of every advantage to improve it. In the service he now  did Cecilia, he was gratified by giving her pleasure, but that was by no means  he only gratification; he still hoped her fortune would one day be he own, he  was glad to transact any business with her, and happy in making her owe to he  an obligation: but he principal inducement was yet stronger: he saw with much  alarm the facility of her liberality; and he feared while her continued in  correspondence with the Jew, that the easiness with which her could raise money  would be a motive with her to continue the practice whenever her was softened  by distress, or subdued by entreaty: but he hoped, by totally concluding the  negociation, the temptation would be removed: and that the hazard and  inconvenience of renewing it, would strengthen her aversion to such an  expedient, till, between difficulties and disuse, that dangerous resource would  be thought of no more. Cecilia then returned to Mrs Harrel, whom Cecilia found as Cecilia had left, weeping in  the arms of Cecilia brother. They consulted upon what was best to be done, and  agreed that Cecilia ought instantly to leave town; for which purpose a chaise was  ordered directly. They settled also that Mr Arnott, when Mr Arnott had conveyed Cecilia to  Mr Arnott country house, which was in Suffolk, should hasten back to superintend the  funeral, and see if anything could be saved from the creditors for Mr Arnott sister. Yet this plan, till Cecilia was summoned to dinner, Yet this plan, till Cecilia was summoned to dinner had not the resolution  to put in practice. Yet this plan, till Cecilia was summoned to dinner were then obliged to be gone, and Yet this plan, till Cecilia was summoned to dinner parting was  very melancholy. Mr Harrel's wept immoderately, and Mr Arnott felt a concern too  tender for avowal, though too sincere for concealment. Cecilia, however glad to  change Cecilia situation, was extremely depressed by Cecilia, however glad to  change her situation sorrow, and entreated to  have frequent accounts of Cecilia, however glad to  change her situation proceedings, warmly repeating Cecilia offers of  service, and protestations of faithful regard. Cecilia accompanied Cecilia, however glad to  change her situation to a chaise, and then went to the dining parlour, where  Cecilia found Mr and Mrs Delvile, but saw nothing more of Cecilia, however glad to  change her situation son the whole day. The next morning after breakfast, Mrs Delvile set out upon some leave-taking  visits, and Cecilia went in a chair to Fetter-lane: here, already waiting for  Cecilia, Cecilia met the punctual Mr Monckton, and the disappointed Jew, who most  unwillingly was paid off, and relinquished Mrs Delvile bonds; and who found in the  severe and crafty Mr Monckton, another sort of man to deal with than the  necessitous and heedless Mr Harrel's. As soon as Mrs Delvile was dismissed, other bonds were drawn and signed, the old ones  were destroyed; and Cecilia, to Cecilia infinite satisfaction, had no creditor but  Mr Monckton. Cecilia bookseller, indeed, was still unpaid, but Cecilia debt with Mrs Delvile  was public, and gave Cecilia not any uneasiness. Cecilia now, with the warmest expressions of gratitude, took leave of Mr Monckton,  who suffered the most painful struggles in repressing the various apprehensions  to which the parting, and Cecilia establishment at the Delviles gave rise. Cecilia then enquired briefly into the affairs of Mrs Hill, and having heard a  satisfactory account of the affairs of Mrs Hill, returned to St James's-square.       BOOK VI
