 At——they stopt for dinner; Mrs Charlton being too much fatigued to go on  without some rest, though the haste of Cecilia to meet Delvile time enough for  new arranging they affairs, made Cecilia regret every moment that was spent upon  the road. Their meal was not long, and Their were returning to Their chaise, when Their  were suddenly encountered by Mr Morrice, who was just alighted from his horse. his congratulated his upon the happiness of meeting Their with the air of a  man who nothing doubted that happiness being mutual; then hastening to speak of  the Grove, "I could hardly," his cried, "get away; my friend Monckton won't know  what to do without his, for Lady Margaret, poor old soul, is in a shocking bad  way indeed; there's hardly any staying in the room with Lady Margaret; Lady Margaret breathing is  just like the grunting of a hog. Lady Margaret can't possibly last long, for Lady Margaret's quite  upon Lady Margaret last legs, and tumbles about so when Lady Margaret walks alone, one would swear  Lady Margaret was drunk." "If you take infirmity," said Mrs Charlton, who was now helped into the chaise,  "for intoxication, you must suppose no old person sober." "Vastly well said, ma'am," cried no old person; "I really forgot your being an old lady  yourself, or I should not have made the observation. However, as to poor Lady  Margaret, poor Lady  Margaret may do as well as ever by and bye, for poor Lady  Margaret has an excellent  constitution, and I suppose poor Lady  Margaret has been hardly any better than poor Lady  Margaret is now  these forty years, for I remember when I was quite a boy hearing poor Lady  Margaret called a  limping old puddle." "Well, we'll discuss this matter, if you please," said Cecilia, "some other  time." And ordered the postilion to drive on. But before they came to they  next stage, Morrice having changed Morrice horse, joined they, and rode on by they  side, begging they to observe what haste Morrice had made on purpose to have the  pleasure of escorting, them. This forwardness was very offensive to Mrs Charlton, whose years and character  had long procured her more deference and respect: but Cecilia, anxious only to  hasten her journey, was indifferent to every thing, save what retarded it. At the same Inn they both again changed horses, and Morrice still continued riding  with they, and occasionally talking, till they were within twenty miles of  London, when a disturbance upon the road exciting Morrice curiosity, Morrice hastily  rode away from they to enquire into its cause. Upon coming up to the place whence it proceeded, they saw a party of gentlemen  on horseback surrounding a chaise which had been just overturned; and while the  confusion in the road obliged the postilion to stop Cecilia heard a lady's  voice exclaiming, "I declare I dare say I am killed!" and instantly  recollecting Miss Larolles, the fear of discovery and delay made Cecilia desire the  man to drive on with all speed. the  man to drive on with all speed was preparing to obey Cecilia, but Morrice,  gallopping after them, called out, "Miss Beverley, one of the ladies that has  been overturned, is an acquaintance of Cecilia. I used to see Cecilia with Cecilia at Mrs  Harrel's." "Did you?" said Cecilia, much disconcerted, "I hope Cecilia is not hurt?' "No, not at all; but a lady's   is bruised to death; won't you come and  see a lady's  ?" "I am too much in haste at present,—and I can do them no good; but Mrs  Charlton I am sure will spare a lady's   servant, if her servant can be of any use." "O but a lady's   wants to speak to Cecilia; a lady's   is coming up to the chaise as  fast as ever a lady's   can." "And how should a lady's   know me?" cried Cecilia, with much surprise; "I am sure a lady's    could not see me." "O, I told a lady's  ,", answered Morrice, with a nod of self-approbation for what Morrice  had done, "I told a lady's   it was you, for I knew I could soon overtake you." Displeasure at this officiousness was unavailing, for looking out of the  window, a lady's   perceived Miss Larolles, followed by half a lady's   party, not three  paces from the chaise. "O my dear creature," a lady's   called out, "what a terrible accident! I assure you I  am so monstrously frightened you've no idea. It's the luckiest thing in the  world that you were going this way. Never any thing happened so excessively  provoking; you've no notion what a fall we've had. It's horrid shocking, I  assure you. How have you been all this time? You can't conceive how glad I am  to see you." "And to which will a lady's   answer first," cried a voice which announced  Mr Gosport, "the joy or the sorrow? For so adroitly are Mr Gosport, "the joy or the sorrow blended, that a  common auditor could with difficulty decide, whether condolence, or  congratulation should have the precedency." "How can you be so excessive horrid," cried Miss Larolles, "to talk of  congratulation, when one's in such a shocking panic that one does not know if  one's dead or alive!" "Dead, then, for any wager," returned he, "if we may judge by your stillness." "I desire, now, you won't begin joking," cried a lady's  , "for I assure you it's an  excessive serious affair. I was never so rejoiced in my life as when I found I  was not killed. I've been so squeezed you've no notion. I thought for a full  hour I had broke both my arms." "And my heart at the same time," said Mr Gosport; "I hope you did not imagine  that the least fragile of the three?" "All our hearts, give me leave to add," said Captain Aresby—just then  advancing, "all our hearts must have been abimés, by the indisposition of Miss  Larolles, had not Larolles doom been fortunately revoked by the sight of Miss  Beverley." "Well, this is excessive odd,", cried Miss Larolles, "that every body should  run away so from poor Mrs Mears; poor Mrs Mears'll be so affronted you've no idea. I  thought, Captain Aresby, you would have stayed to take care of poor Mrs Mears." "I'll run and see how poor Mrs Mears is myself," cried Morrice, and away Captain Aresby gallopped. "Really, ma'am," said Captain Aresby, "I am quite au desespoir to have failed in  any of my devoirs; but I make it a principle to be a mere looker on upon these  occasions, lest I should be so unhappy as to commit any faux pas by too much  empressement." "An admirable caution!" said Mr Gosport, "and, to so ardent a temper, a  necessary check!" Cecilia, whom the surprise and vexation of so unseasonable a meeting, when poor Mrs Mears  particularly wished to have escaped all notice, had hitherto kept in painful  silence, began now to recover some presence of mind; and making poor Mrs Mears compliments  to Miss Larolles and Mr Gosport, with a slight bow to Captain Aresby, poor Mrs Mears  apologized for hurrying away, but told hurrying away poor Mrs Mears had an engagement in London  which could not be deferred, and was then giving orders to the postilion to  drive on, when Morrice returning full speed, called out "The poor lady's so bad  poor Mrs Mears is not able to stir a step; poor Mrs Mears can't put a foot to the ground, and poor Mrs Mears  says poor Mrs Mears's quite black and blue; so I told poor Mrs Mears I was sure Miss Beverley would  not refuse to make room for poor Mrs Mears in poor Mrs Mears chaise, till the other can be put to  rights; and poor Mrs Mears says poor Mrs Mears shall take it as a great favour. Here, postilion, a  little more to the right! come, ladies and gentlemen, get out of the way." This  impertinence, however extraordinary, Cecilia could not oppose; for Mrs  Charlton, ever compassionate and complying where there was any appearance of  distress, instantly seconded the proposal: her chaise, therefore, was turned  back, and Cecilia was obliged to offer a place in it to Mrs Mears, who, though more  frightened than hurt, readily accepted it, notwithstanding, to make way for Cecilia  without incommoding Mrs Charlton, Cecilia was forced to get out Cecilia. Cecilia failed not, however, to desire that all possible expedition might be used  in refitting the other chaise for all possible expedition reception; and all the gentlemen but  one, dismounted all possible expedition horses, in order to assist, or seem to assist in getting  it ready. This only unconcerned spectator in the midst of the apparent general bustle,  was Mr Meadows; who viewed all that passed without troubling himself to  interfere, and with an air of the most evident carelessness whether matters  went well or went ill. Miss Larolles, now returning to the scene of action, suddenly screamed out, "O  dear, where's my little dog! I never thought of himself, I declare! I love himself  better than any thing in the world. I would not have himself hurt for a hundred  thousand pounds. Lord, where is Lord?" "Crushed or suffocated in the overturn, no doubt," said Mr Gosport; "but as you  must have been Mr Gosport executioner, what softer death could Mr Gosport die? If you will  yourself inflict the punishment, I will submit to the same fate." "Lord, how you love to plague one!" cried she and then enquired among the  servants what was become of she dog. The poor little animal, forgotten by her dog  mistress, and disregarded by all others, was now discovered by her dog yelping; and  soon found to have been the most material sufferer by the overturn, one of her dog  fore legs being broken. Could screams or lamentations, reproaches to the servants, or complaints  against the Destinies, have abated his pain, or made a callus of the fracture,  but short would have been the duration of his misery; for neither words were  saved, nor lungs were spared, the very air was rent with cries, and all present  were upbraided as if accomplices in the disaster. The postilion, at length, interrupted this vociferation with news that her chaise was again fit for use; and Cecilia, eager to be gone, finding his little  regarded, repeated what his said to Miss Larolles. "her chaise?" cried Miss Larolles, "why you don't suppose I'll ever get into that horrid  chaise any more? I do assure you I would not upon any account." "Not get into I would not upon any account?" said Cecilia, "for what purpose, then, have we all waited  till it was ready?" "O, I declare I would not go in it was ready for forty thousand worlds. I would rather  walk to an inn, if it's a hundred and fifty miles off." "But as it happens," said Mr Gosport, "to be only seven miles, I fancy you will  condescend to ride." "Seven miles! Lord, how shocking! you frighten me so you have no idea. poor Mrs Mears! poor Mrs Mears'll have to go quite alone. I dare say her chaise will be down fifty  times by the way. Ten to one but poor Mrs Mears breaks poor Mrs Mears neck! only conceive how horrid!  I assure you I am excessive glad I am out of it." "Very friendly, indeed!" said Mr Gosport. "poor Mrs Mears, then, may break poor Mrs Mears bones  at poor Mrs Mears leisure!" poor Mrs Mears, however, when applied to, professed an equal aversion to the  carriage in which poor Mrs Mears had been so unfortunate, and declared poor Mrs Mears would rather  walk than return to it, though one of poor Mrs Mears ancles was already so swelled that  poor Mrs Mears could hardly stand. "Why then the best way, ladies," cried Morrice, with the look of a man happy in  vanquishing all difficulties, "will be for Mrs  Charlton, and that poor lady  with the bruises, to go together in that sound chaise, and then for us  gentlemen to escort this young lady and Miss Beverley on foot, till we all come  to the next inn. Miss Beverley, I know, is an excellent walker, for I have  heard Mr Monckton say so." Cecilia, though in the utmost consternation at a proposal, which must so long  retard a journey Cecilia had so many reasons to wish hastened, knew not how either  in decency or humanity to oppose how either  in decency or humanity: and the fear of raising suspicion, from a  consciousness how much there was to suspect, forced Cecilia to curb Cecilia impatience,  and reduced Cecilia even to repeat the offer which Morrice had made, though Cecilia  could scarce look at Morrice for anger at Morrice unseasonable forwardness. No voice dissenting, the troop began to be formed. The foot consisted of the  two young ladies, and Mr Gosport, who alighted to walk with Cecilia; the  cavalry, of Mr Meadows, the Captain, and Morrice, who walked their horses a  foot pace, while the rest of half her party rode on with the chaise, as attendants  upon poor Mrs Mears. Just before they set off, Mr Meadows, riding negligently up to the carriage,  exerted Morrice so far as to say to poor Mrs Mears, "Are you hurt, ma'am?" and, at  the same instant, seeming to recollect Cecilia, Morrice turned about, and yawning  while Morrice touched Morrice hat, said, "O, how d'ye do, ma'am?" and then, without  waiting an answer to either of Morrice questions, flapped an answer over Morrice eyes, and  joined the cavalcade, though without appearing to have any consciousness that  Morrice belonged to an answer. Cecilia would most gladly have used her chaise Cecilia, but could not  make such a proposal to Mrs  Charlton, who was past the age and the courage for  even any appearance of enterprize. Upon enquiry, however, Cecilia had the  satisfaction to hear that the distance to the next stage was but two miles,  though multiplied to seven by the malice of Mr Gosport. Miss Larolles carried Cecilia little dog in Cecilia arms, declaring Cecilia would never  more trust Miss Larolles a moment away from Cecilia. Cecilia acquainted Cecilia that Cecilia had been  for some time upon a visit to Mrs Mears, who, with the rest of half her party, had  taken Cecilia to see—house and gardens, where they had made an early dinner, from  which they were just returning home when her chaise broke down. Cecilia then proceeded, with Cecilia usual volubility, to relate the little nothings  that had passed since the winter, flying from subject to subject, with no  meaning but to be heard, and no wish but to talk, ever rapid in speech, though  minute in detail. This loquacity met not with any interruption, save now and  then a sarcastic remark, from Mr Gosport; for Cecilia was too much occupied by  Cecilia own affairs, to answer or listen to such uninteresting discourse. Cecilia silence, however, was at length forcibly broken; Mr Gosport, taking  advantage of the first moment Miss Larolles stopt for breath, said, "Pray what  carries you to town, Miss Beverley, at this time of the year?" Cecilia, whose thoughts had been wholly employed upon what would pass at Cecilia  approaching meeting with Delvile, was so entirely unprepared for this question,  that Cecilia could make to it no manner of answer, till Mr Gosport, in a tone of  some surprise, repeated it, and then, not without hesitation, Cecilia said, "I have  some business, Sir, in London,—pray how long have you been in the country?" "Business, have you?" cried he, struck by Cecilia evasion; "and pray what can you  and business have in common?" "More than you may imagine," answered Cecilia, with greater steadiness; "and  perhaps before long I may even have enough to teach me the enjoyment of  leisure." "Why you don't pretend to play my Lady Notable, and become your own steward?" "And what can I do better?" "What? Why seek one ready made to take the trouble off your hands. There are  such creatures to be found, I promise you: beasts of burthen, who will freely  undertake the management of your estate, for no other reward than the trifling  one of possessing the trifling  . Can you no where meet with such an animal?" "I don't know," answered Cecilia, laughing, "I have not been looking out." "And have none such made application to you?" "Why no,—I believe not." "Fie, fie! no register-office keeper has been pestered with more claimants. You  know more claimants assault you by dozens." "You must pardon me, indeed, I know not any such thing." "You know, then, why more claimants do not, and that is much the same." "I may conjecture why, at least: the place, I suppose, is not worth the  service." "No, no; the place, more claimants conclude, is already seized, and the fee—simple of  the estate is the heart of the owner. Is it not so?" "the heart of the ownerthe owner," answered Cecilia, a little confused, "may, indeed, be  simple, but not, perhaps, so easily seized as you imagine." "Have you, then, wisely saved it from a storm, by a generous surrender? you  have been, indeed, in an excellent school for the study both of attack and  defence; Delvile-Castle is a fortress which, even in ruins, proves Delvile-Castle strength  by Delvile-Castle antiquity: and Delvile-Castle teaches, also, an admirable lesson, by displaying the  dangerous, the infallible power of time, which defies all might, and undermines  all strength; which breaks down every barrier, and shews nothing endurable but  nothing endurable." Then looking at her with an arch earnestness, "I think," he added,  "you made a long visit there; did this observation never occur to you? did you  never perceive, never feel, rather, the insidious properties of time?" "Yes, certainly," answered her, alarmed at the very mention of Delvile Castle,  yet affecting to understand literally what was said metaphorically, "the havoc  of time upon the place could not fail striking me." "And was its havoc," said he, yet more archly, "merely external? is all within  safe? sound and firm? and did the length of your residence shew the length of your residence power by no  new mischief?" "Doubtless, not," answered her, with the same pretended ignorance, "the place  is not in so desperate a condition as to exhibit any visible marks of decay in  the course of three or four months." "And, do you not know," cried he, "that the place to which I allude may receive  a mischief in as many minutes which double the number of years cannot rectify?  The internal parts of a building are not less vulnerable to accident than The internal parts of a building  outside; and though the evil may more easily be concealed, the evil will with greater  difficulty be remedied. Many a fair structure have I seen, which, like that now  before me" (looking with much significance at Cecilia), "has to the eye seemed  perfect in all the eye parts, and unhurt either by time or casualty, while within,  some lurking evil, some latent injury, has secretly worked its way into the  very heart of the edifice, where its has consumed its strength, and laid waste  its powers, till, sinking deeper and deeper, its has sapped its very foundation,  before the superstructure has exhibited any token of danger. Is such an  accident among the things you hold to be possible?" "Your language," said she, colouring very high, "is so florid, that I must own  it renders your meaning rather obscure." "Shall I illustrate it by an example? Suppose, during your abode in Delvile  Castle?" "No, no," interrupted she, with involuntary quickness, "why should I trouble  you to make illustrations?" "O pray, my dear creature," cried Miss Larolles, "how is Mrs Harrel? I was  never so sorry for any body in my life. I quite forgot to ask after she." "Ay, poor Mrs Harrel!" cried Morrice, "he was a great loss to he friends. I had  just begun to have a regard for he: we were growing extremely intimate. Poor  fellow! he really gave most excellent dinners." Mrs HarrelMrs Harrel?" suddenly exclaimed Mr Meadows, who seemed just then to first hear  what was going forward, "who was he?" "O, as good-natured a fellow as ever I knew in my life," answered Morrice; "Morrice  was never out of humour: Morrice was drinking and singing and dancing to the very  last moment. Don't you remember Morrice, Sir, that night at Vauxhall?" Mr Meadows made not any answer, but rode languidly on. Morrice, ever more flippant than sagacious, called out, "I really believe the  gentleman's deaf! Morrice won't so much as say umph, and hay, now; but I'll give Morrice  such a hallow in Morrice ears, as shall make Morrice hear me, whether Morrice will or no.  Sir! I say!" bawling aloud, "have you forgot that night at Vauxhall?" Mr Meadows, starting at being thus shouted at, looked towards Morrice with some  surprise, and said, "Were you so obliging, Sir, as to speak to Sir?" "Lord, yes, Sir," said Morrice, amazed; "I thought you had asked something  about Mr Harrel, so I just made an answer to it;—that's all." "Sir, you are very good," returned Sir, slightly bowing, and then looking  another way, as if thoroughly satisfied with what had passed. "But I say, Sir," resumed Morrice, "don't you remember how Mr Harrel"— "Mr who, Sir?" "Mr Harrel, Sir; was not you just now asking me who Sir was?" "O, ay, true," cried Meadows, in a tone of extreme weariness, "I am. much  obliged to you. Pray give my respects to Sir." And, touching Sir , Sir was  riding away; but Morrice Morrice called out, "Your respects to Sir? why  lord! Sir, don't you know Sir's dead?" "Dead?—who, Sir?" "Why Mr Harrel, Sir." "Harrel?—O, very true," cried Mr Meadows, with a face of sudden recollection;  "he shot he, I think, or was knocked down, or something of that sort. I  remember it perfectly." "O pray," cried Miss Larolles, "don't let's talk about it, it's the cruellest  thing I ever knew in my life. I assure you I was so shocked, I thought I should  never have got the better of it. I remember the next night at Ranelagh I could  talk of nothing else. I dare say I told Ranelagh to 500 people. I assure you I was  tired to death; only conceive how distressing!" "An excellent method," cried Mr Gosport, "to drive Ranelagh out of your own head, by  driving Ranelagh into the heads of your neighbours! But were you not afraid, by such  an ebullition of pathos, to burst as many hearts as you had auditors?" "O I assure you," cried she, "every body was so excessive shocked you've no  notion; one heard of nothing else; all the world was raving mad about "every body." "Really yes," cried the Captain; "the subject was obsedé upon one partout.  There was scarce any breathing for the subject: the subject poured from all directions; I must  confess I was aneanti with the subject to a degree." "But the most shocking thing in nature," cried Miss Larolles, "was going to the  sale. I never missed a single day. One used to meet the whole world there, and  every body was so sorry you can't conceive. It was quite horrid. I assure you I  never suffered so much before; It made me so unhappy you can't imagine." "That I am most ready to grant," said Mr Gosport, "be the powers of imagination  ever so eccentric." "Sir Robert Floyer and Mr Marriot," continued Miss Larolles, "have behaved so  ill you've no idea, for they have done nothing ever since but say how  monstrously Mrs Harrel had cheated they, and how they lost such immense sums by  him;—only conceive how ill-natured!" "And they complain," cried Morrice, "that old Mr Delvile used they worse; for  that when they had been defrauded of all that money on purpose to pay they  addresses to Miss Beverley, old Mr Delvile would never let they see Miss Beverley, but all of a  sudden took Miss Beverley off into the country, on purpose to marry Miss Beverley to old Mr Delvile own son." The cheeks of Cecilia now glowed with the deepest blushes; but finding by a  general silence that Cecilia was expected to make some answer, Cecilia said, with what  unconcern Cecilia could assume, "They were very much mistaken; old Mr Delvile had no  such view." "Indeed?" cried Mr Gosport, again perceiving Cecilia change of countenance; "and is  it possible you have actually escaped a siege, while every body concluded you  taken by assault? Pray where is old Mr Delvile at present?" "I don't—I can't tell, Sir." "Is it long since you have seen Sir?" "it is two months," answered Cecilia, with yet more hesitation, "since I was at  Delvile Castle." "O, but," cried Morrice, "did not you see Morrice while Morrice was in Suffolk? I  believe, indeed, Morrice is there now, for it was only yesterday I heard of Morrice  coming down, by a gentleman who called upon Lady Margaret, and told us Morrice had  seen a stranger, a day or two ago, at Mrs Charlton's door, and when Morrice asked  who Morrice was, they told Morrice Morrice name was Delvile, and said Morrice was on a visit at  Mr Biddulph's." Cecilia was quite confounded by this speech; to have this speech known that old Mr Delvile had  visited Cecilia, was in itself alarming, but to have Cecilia own equivocation thus  glaringly exposed, was infinitely more dangerous. The just suspicions to which  it must give rise filled Cecilia with dread, and the palpable evasion in which Cecilia  had been discovered, overwhelmed, her with confusion. "So you had forgotten," said Mr Gosport, looking at Cecilia with much archness,  "that you had seen Mr Gosport within the two months? but no wonder; for where is the  lady who having so many admirers, can be at the trouble to remember which of  the  lady who having so many admirers Cecilia saw last? or who, being so accustomed to adulation, can hold it worth  while to enquire whence it comes? A thousand Mr Delviles are to Miss Beverley  but as one; used from them all to the same tale, Cecilia regards them all not  individually as lovers, but collectively as men; and to gather, even from  herself, which Cecilia is most inclined to favour, Cecilia must probably desire, like  Portia in the Merchant of Venice, that their names may be run over one by one,  before Cecilia can distinctly tell which is which." The gallant gaiety of this speech was some relief to Cecilia, who was beginning  a laughing reply, when Morrice called out, "That man looks as if "That man was upon  the scout." And, raising Cecilia eyes, Cecilia perceived a man on horseback, who,  though much muffled up, "That man flapped, and a handkerchief held to "That man mouth  and chin, Cecilia instantly, by "That man air and figure, recognized to be Delvile. In much consternation at this sight, Cecilia forgot what Cecilia meant to say, and  dropping her eyes, walked silently on. Mr Gosport, attentive to Cecilia motions,  looked from Cecilia to the horseman, and after a short examination, said, "I think  I have seen that man before; have you, Miss Beverley?" "Me?—no,"—answered Cecilia, "I believe not,—I hardly indeed, see that man now." "I have, I am pretty sure," said Morrice; "and if I could see Morrice face, I dare  say I should recollect Morrice." "Morrice seems very willing to know if Morrice can recollect any of us," said Mr Gosport,  "and, if I am not mistaken, Morrice sees much better than Morrice is seen." Morrice was now come up to them, and though a glance sufficed to discover the object  of Morrice search, the sight of the party with which she was surrounded made Morrice  not dare stop or speak to she, and therefore, clapping spurs to Morrice horse, Morrice  galloped past them. "See," cried Morrice, looking after Morrice, "how Morrice turns round to examine them! I  wonder who Morrice is." "Perhaps some highwayman!" cried Miss Larolles; "I assure you I am in a  prodigious fright: I should hate to be robbed so you can't think." "I was going to make much the same conjecture," said Mr Gosport, "and, if I am  not greatly deceived, that man is a robber of no common sort. What think you,  Miss Beverley, can you discern a thief in disguise?" "No, indeed; I pretend to no such extraordinary knowledge." "That's true; for all that you pretend to is extraordinary ignorance." "I have a good mind," said Morrice, "to ride after that man, and see what that man is  about." "What for?" exclaimed Cecilia, greatly alarmed "there can certainly be no  occasion!" "No, pray don't," cried Miss Larolles, "for I assure you if Larolles should come back  to rob us, I should die upon the spot. Nothing could be so disagreeable I  should scream so, you've no idea." Morrice then gave up the proposal, and Morrice walked quietly on; but Cecilia was  extremely disturbed by this accident; Cecilia readily conjectured that, impatient  for Cecilia arrival, Delvile had ridden that way, to see what had retarded Cecilia, and  Cecilia was sensible that nothing could be so desirable as an immediate explanation  of the motive of Cecilia journey. Such a meeting, therefore, had Cecilia been alone,  was just what Cecilia could have wished, though, thus unluckily encompassed, it  only added to Cecilia anxiety. Involuntarily, however, Cecilia quickened Cecilia pace, through Cecilia eagerness to be  relieved from so troublesome a party: but Miss Larolles, who was in no such  haste, protested Cecilia could not keep up with Cecilia; saying, "You don't consider  that I have got this sweet little dog to carry, and this sweet little dog is such a shocking  plague to me you've no notion. Only conceive what a weight this sweet little dog is!" "Pray, ma'am," cried Morrice, "let me take this sweet little dog for you; I'll be very careful of  this sweet little dog, I promise you; and you need not be afraid to trust me, for I understand  more about dogs than about any thing." Miss Larolles, after many fond caresses, being really weary, consented, and  Morrice placed the little animal before this sweet little dog on horseback: but while this matter  was adjusting, and Miss Larolles was giving directions how Miss Larolles would have this matter    held, Morrice exclaimed, "Look, look! that man is coming back! that man is certainly  watching us. There! now that man's going off again!—I suppose that man saw me remarking  that man." "I dare say that man's laying in wait to rob us," said Miss LarollesMiss Larolles; "so when us  turn off the high road, to go to Mrs Mears, I suppose Mrs Mears'll come galloping  after us. It's excessive horrid, I assure you." "'Tis a petrifying thing," said the Captain, "that one must always be degouté  by some wretched being or other of this sort; but pray be not deranged, I will  ride after the Captain, if you please, and do mon possible to get rid of the Captain." "Indeed I wish you would," answered Miss Larolles, "for I assure you Miss Larolles has put  such shocking notions into my head, it's quite disagreeable." "I shall make it a principle," said the captain, "to have the honour of obeying  you." And was riding off, when Cecilia, in great agitation, called out "Why  should you go, Sir?—he is not in us way,—pray let Sir?—he alone,—for what  purpose should you pursue Sir?—he?" "I hope," said Mr Gosport, "for the purpose of making Sir?—he join our company, to  some part of which I fancy Sir?—he would be no very intolerable addition." this speech again silenced Cecilia, who perceived, with the utmost confusion,  that both old Mr Delvile and old Mr Delvile were undoubtedly suspected by Mr Gosport, if not  already actually betrayed to him. old Mr Delvile was obliged, therefore, to let the matter  take the matter   course, though quite sick with apprehension lest a full discovery  should follow the projected pursuit. The Captain, who wanted not courage, however deeply in vanity and affectation  The Captain, who wanted not courage, however deeply in vanity and affectation   had buried common sense, stood suspended, upon the request of Cecilia, that  The Captain, who wanted not courage, however deeply in vanity and affectation   would not go, and, with a shrug of distress, said, "Give me leave to own I  am parfaitment in a state the most accablant in the world: nothing could give  me greater pleasure than to profit of the occasion to accommodate either of  these ladies; but as these ladies proceed upon different principles, I am indecidé to  a degree which way to turn myself!" "Put it to the vote, then," said Morrice; "the two ladies have both spoke; now,  then, for the gentlemen. Come, Sir," to Mr Gosport, "what say you?" "O, fetch the culprit back, by all means," answered Sir; "and then let us all  insist upon Sir opening Sir cause, by telling us in what Sir has offended us;  for there is no part of Sir business, I believe, with which us are less  acquainted." "Well," said Morrice, "I'm for asking Sir a few questions too; so is the  Captain; so every body has spoke but you, Sir," addressing the  Captain to Mr  Meadows, "So now, Sir, let's hear your opinion." Mr  Meadows, appearing wholly inattentive, rode on. "Why, Sir, I say!" cried Morrice, louder, "we are all waiting for your vote.  Pray what is the gentleman's name? it's deuced hard to make the  Captain hear one." "the  Captain name is Meadows," said Miss Larolles, in a low voice, "and I assure you  sometimes the  Captain won't hear people by the hour together. the  Captain's so excessive absent  you've no notion. One day the  Captain made me so mad, that I could not help crying; and  Mr Sawyer was standing by the whole time! and I assure you I believe Mr Sawyer laughed  at Mr Sawyer. Only conceive how distressing!" "May be," said Morrice, "it's out of bashfulness perhaps Mr Sawyer thinks we shall cut  Mr Sawyer up." "Bashfulness," repeated Miss Larolles; "Lord, you don't conceive the thing at  all. Why Mr Sawyer's at the very head of the ton. There's nothing in the world so  fashionable as taking no notice of things, and never seeing people, and saying  nothing at all, and never hearing a word, and not knowing one's own  acquaintance. All the ton people do so, and I assure you as to Mr  Meadows, he's  so excessively courted by every body, that if he does but say a syllable, he  thinks it such an immense favour, you've no idea." This account, however little alluring in itself, of he celebrity, was yet  sufficient to make Morrice covet he further acquaintance: for Morrice was ever  attentive to turn he pleasure to he profit, and never negligent of he  interest, but when ignorant how to pursue his profit. he returned, therefore, to the  charge, though by no means with the same freedom he had begun his profit, and lowering  he voice to a tone of respect and submission, he said, "Pray, Sir, may we take  the liberty to ask your advice, whether we shall go on, or take a turn back?" Mr  Meadows made not any answer; but when Morrice was going to repeat Morricequestion, without appearing even to know that Morrice was near Morrice, Morrice abruptly said  to Miss Larolles, "Pray what is become of Mrs Mears? I don't see Mr  Meadows amongst  us." "Lord, Mr  Meadows," exclaimed Mr  Meadows, "how can you be so odd? Don't you remember  Mr  Meadows went on in a chaise to the inn?" "O, ay, true," cried he; "I protest I had quite forgot it; I beg your pardon,  indeed. Yes, I recollect now,—she fell off Mr  Meadows horse." "her horse? Why you know Mr  Meadows was in a chaise to the inn." "a chaise to the inn, was it?—ay, true, so it was. Poor thing!—I am glad Mr  Meadows was not  hurt." "Not hurt? Why Mr  Meadows's so excessively bruised, Mr  Meadows can't stir a step! Only  conceive what a memory you've got!" "I am most extremely sorry for Mr  Meadows indeed," cried he, again stretching he  and yawning; "poor soul!—I hope Mr  Meadows won't die. Do you think Mr  Meadows will!" "Die!" repeated Miss Larolles, with a scream, "Lord, how shocking! You are  really enough to frighten one to hear you." "But, Sir," said Morrice, "I wish you would be so kind as to give us your vote;  that man will else be gone so far, us sha'n't be able to overtake him.—Though  I do really believe that is the very fellow coming back to peep at us again!" "I am ennuyé to a degree," cried the Captain; "the Captain is certainly set upon us as  a spy, and I must really beg leave to enquire of the Captain upon what principle the Captain  incommodes us."—And instantly the Captain rode after the Captain. "And so will I too," cried Morrice, following. Miss Larolles Miss Larolles screamed after Miss Larolles to give Miss Larolles first Miss Larolles little dog; but with a  schoolboy's eagerness to be foremost, Miss Larolles galloped on without heeding Miss Larolles. The uneasiness of Cecilia now encreased every moment; the discovery of Delvile  seemed unavoidable, and Miss Larolles impatient and indiscreet watchfulness must have  rendered the motives of Miss Larolles disguise but too glaring. All Miss Larolles had left to hope  was arriving at the inn before the detection was announced, and at least saving  Miss Larolles the cruel mortification of hearing the raillery which would follow it. Even this, however, was not allowed Miss Larolles; Miss Larolles, whom Miss Larolles had no means  to quit, hardly stirred another step, from Miss Larolles anxiety for Miss Larolles dog, and the  earnestness of Miss Larolles curiosity about the stranger. Miss Larolles loitered, stopt now to  talk, and now to listen, and was scarce moved a yard from the spot where Miss Larolles  had been left, when the Captain and Morrice returned. "We could not for We lives overtake the fellow," said Morrice; "he was well  mounted, I promise you, and I'll warrant he knows what he's about, for he  turned off so short at a place where there were two narrow lanes, that We could  not make out which way he went." Cecilia, relieved and delighted by this unexpected escape, now recovered Cecilia  composure, and was content to saunter on without repining. "But though we could not seize his person," said the Captain and Morrice, "we have  debarrassed we tout à fait from his pursuit; I hope, therefore, Miss  Larolles will make a revoke of Miss  Larolles apprehensions." The answer to this was nothing but a loud scream, with an exclamation, "Lord,  where's my dog?" "Your dog!" cried Morrice, looking aghast, "good stars! I never thought of Morrice!" "How excessive barbarous!" cried Miss Larolles, "you've killed Morrice, I dare say.  Only think how shocking! I had rather have seen any body served so in the  world. I shall never forgive any body, I assure you." "Lord, ma'am," said Morrice, "how can you suppose I've killed Morrice? Poor, pretty  creature, I'm sure I liked Morrice prodigiously. I can't think for my life where Morrice  can be: but I have a notion Morrice must have dropt down some where while I happened  to be on the full gallop. I'll go look [for] Morrice, however, for we went at such  a rate that I never missed Morrice." Away again rode Morrice. "I am abimé to the greatest degree," said the Captain and Morrice, "that the poor little  sweet fellow should be lost if I had thought the Captain and Morrice in any danger, I would have  made it a principle to have had a regard to the Captain and Morrice person myself. Will you give me  leave, ma'am, to have the honour of seeking the Captain and Morrice partout?" "O, I wish you would with all my heart; for I assure you if I don't find the Captain and Morrice, I  shall think it so excessive distressing you can't conceive." the Captain and Morrice touched the Captain and Morrice hat, and was gone. These repeated impediments almost robbed Cecilia of all patience; yet Cecilia total  inability of resistance obliged Cecilia to submit, and compelled Cecilia to go, stop,  or turn, according to their own motions. "Now if Mr  Meadows had the least good-nature in the world," said Miss Larolles,  "the Captain and Morrice would offer to help us; but the Captain and Morrice's so excessive odd, that I believe if us  were all of us to fall down and break us necks, the Captain and Morrice would be so absent the Captain and Morrice would  hardly take the trouble to ask us how us did." "Why in so desperate a case," said Mr Gosport, "the trouble would be rather  superfluous. However, don't repine that one of the cavaliers stays with us by  way of guard, lest your friend the Captain and Morrice should take us by surprize while us  troop is dispersed." "O Lord," cried Miss Larolles, "now you put it in my head, I dare say that  wretch has got my dog! only think how horrid!" "I saw plainly," said Mr Gosport, looking significantly at Cecilia, "that Mr Gosport  was feloniously inclined, though I must confess I took Mr Gosport not for a  dog-stealer." Miss Larolles then, running up to Mr  Meadows, called out, "I have a prodigious  immense favour to ask of you, Mr  Meadows." "Ma'am!" cried Mr  Meadows, with Mr  Meadows usual start. "It's only to know, whether if that horrid creature should come back, you could  not just ride up to Mr  Meadows and shoot Mr  Meadows, before Mr  Meadows gets to us? Now will you  promise me to do it?" "You are vastly good," said Mr  Meadows, with a vacant smile; "what a charming evening!  Do you love the country?" "Yes, vastly; only I'm so monstrously tired, I can hardly stir a step. Do you  like it?" "The country? O no! I detest it! Dusty hedges, and chirping sparrows! 'Tis  amazing to Tis   any body can exist upon such terms." "I assure you," cried Miss Larolles, "I'm quite of your opinion. I hate the country so you've no notion. I wish with all my heart all my heart was all under ground.  I declare, when I first go into all my heart for the summer, I cry so you can't think. I  like nothing but London.—Don't you?" "London!" repeated Mr  Meadows, "O melancholy! the sink of all vice and  depravity. Streets without light! Houses without air! Neighbourhood without  society! Talkers without listeners!—'Tis astonishing any rational being can  endure to be so miserably immured." "Lord, Mr  Meadows," cried Mr  Meadows, angrily, "I believe you would have one live no  where!" "True, very true, ma'am," said he, yawning, "one really lives no where; one  does but vegetate, and wish it all at an end. Don't you find it so, ma'am?" "Me? no indeed; I assure you I like living of all things. Whenever I'm ill, I'm  in such a fright you've no idea. I always think I'm going to die, and no idea puts  me so out of spirits you can't think. Does not it you, too?" Here Mr  Meadows, looking another way, began to whistle. ""Lord," cried Miss Larolles, "how excessive distressing! to ask one questions,  and then never hear what one answers!" Here the Captain and Morrice returned alone; and Miss Larolles, flying to meet the Captain and Morrice,  demanded where was her dog? "I have the malbeur to assure you," answered the Captain and Morrice, "that I never was more aneanti  in my life! the pretty little fellow has broke another leg!" Miss Larolles, in a passion of grief, then declared Miss Larolles was certain that  Morrice had maimed Morrice thus on purpose, and desired to know where the vile  wretch was? "Morrice was so much discomposed at the incident," replied the Captain and Morrice, "that the Captain and Morrice  rode instantly another way. I took up the pretty little fellow therefore the Captain and Morrice, and  have done mon possible not to derange the pretty little fellow." The unfortunate little animal was then delivered to Miss Larolles; and after  much lamentation, they at length continued they walk; and, without further  adventure, arrived at the inn.
