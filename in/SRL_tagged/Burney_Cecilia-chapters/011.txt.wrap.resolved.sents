 The moment Cecilia was at liberty, Cecilia sent Cecilia own servant to examine into the  real situation of the carpenter and her own servant family, and to desire her own servant wife would  call upon Cecilia as soon as Cecilia was at leisure.
The account which her own servant brought back  encreased Cecilia concern for the injuries of these poor people, and determined Cecilia  not to rest satisfied till Cecilia saw these poor people redressed.
her own servant informed Cecilia that these poor people  lived in a small lodging up two pair of stairs; that there were five children,  all girls, the three eldest of whom were hard at work with whom mother in  matting chair-bottoms, and the fourth, though a mere child, was nursing the  youngest; while the poor carpenter himself was confined to her own servant bed, in  consequence of a fall from a ladder while working at Violet-Bank, by which her own servant  was covered with wounds and contusions, and an object of misery and pain.
As soon as Mrs Hill came, Cecilia sent for Cecilia into Cecilia own room, where Cecilia  received Cecilia with the most compassionate tenderness, and desired to know when  Mr Harrel talked of paying Cecilia?
"To-morrow, madam," Cecilia answered, shaking Cecilia head, "that is always her head  honour's speech: but I shall bear it while I can.
However, though I dare not  tell his  honour, something bad will come of his  honour, if I am not paid soon."
"Do you mean, then, to apply to the law?"
"I must not tell you, madam; but to be sure we have thought of it many a sad  time and often; but still, while we could rub on, we thought it best not to  make enemies: but, indeed, madam, his  honour was so hardhearted this morning,  that if I was not afraid you would be angry, I could not tell how to bear it;  for when I told his I had no help now, for I had lost my Billy, his had the  heart to say, 'So much the better, there's one the less of you.'"
"But what," cried Cecilia, extremely shocked by this unfeeling speech, "is the  reason his gives for disappointing you so often?"
"his says, madam, that none of the other workmen are paid yet; and that, to be  sure, is very true; but then none of the other workmen are paid yet; and that, to be  sure, is very true can all better afford to wait than we can,  for we were the poorest of all, madam, and have been misfortunate from the  beginning: and his  honour would never have employed we, only his had run up such  a bill with Mr Wright, that his would not undertake any thing more till his was  paid.
we were told from the first we should not get we money; but we were  willing to hope for the best, for we had nothing to do, and were hard run, and  had never had the offer of so good a job before; and we had a great family to  keep, and many losses, and so much illness!—Oh madam!
if you did but know  what the poor go through!"
this unfeeling speech opened to Cecilia a new view of life; that a young man could appear  so gay and happy, yet be guilty of such injustice and inhumanity, that a young man could  take pride in works which not even money had made a young man own, and live with  undiminished splendor, when a young man credit itself began to fail, seemed to Cecilia  incongruities so irrational, that hitherto Cecilia had supposed that hitherto impossible.
Cecilia then enquired if Cecilia husband had yet had any physician?
"Yes, madam, I humbly thank your goodness," Cecilia answered; "but I am not the  poorer for that, for the gentleman was so kind the gentleman would take nothing."
"And does the gentleman give you any hopes?
what does the gentleman say?"
"the gentleman says the gentleman must die, madam, but I knew that before."
"Poor woman!
and what will you do then?"
"The same, madam, as I did when I lost my Billy, work on the harder!"
"Good heaven, how severe a lot!
but tell me, why is it you seem to love your  my Billy so much better than the rest of your children?"
"Because, madam, my Billy was the only boy that ever I had; my Billy was seventeen years  old, madam, and as tall and as pretty a lad!
and so good, that my Billy never cost me  a wet eye till I lost my Billy.
my Billy worked with my Billy father, and all the folks used to  say my Billy was the better workman of the two."
"And what was the occasion of my Billy death?"
"A consumption, madam, that wasted my Billy quite to nothing: and my Billy was ill a long  time, and cost us a deal of money, for us spared neither for wine nor any thing  that us thought would but comfort my Billy; and us loved my Billy so us never grudged it.
But my Billy died, madam!
and if it had not been for very hard work, the loss of my Billy  would quite have broke my heart."
"Try, however, to think less of my Billy," said Cecilia; "and depend upon my  speaking again for my Billy to Mr Harrel.
You shall certainly have your money; take  care, therefore, of your own health, and go home and give comfort to your sick  husband."
"Oh, madam," cried the poor woman, tears streaming down the poor woman cheeks, "you don't  know how touching it is to hear gentlefolks talk so kindly!
And I have been  used to nothing but roughness from his honour!
But what I most fear, madam, is  that when my husband is gone, my husband will be harder to deal with than ever; for a  widow, madam, is always hard to be righted; and I don't expect to hold out long  my husband, for sickness and sorrow wear fast: and then, when us are both gone, who  is to help us poor children?"
"I will!"
cried the generous Cecilia; "I am able, and I am willing; you shall  not find all the rich hardhearted, and I will try to make you some amends for  the unkindness you have suffered."
The poor woman, overcome by a promise so unexpected, burst into a passionate  fit of tears, and sobbed out the generous Cecilia thanks with a violence of emotion that  frightened Cecilia almost as much as it melted Cecilia.
Cecilia endeavoured, by  re-iterated assurances of assistance, to appease Cecilia, and solemnly pledged Cecilia  own honour that Cecilia should certainly be paid the following Saturday, which was  only three days distant.
Mrs Hill, when a little calmer, dried Mrs Hill eyes, and humbly begging Mrs Hill to  forgive a transport which Mrs Hill could not restrain, most gratefully thanked Mrs Hill  for the engagement into which Mrs Hill had entered, protesting that Mrs Hill would not be  troublesome to Mrs Hill goodness as long as Mrs Hill could help it; "And I believe," Mrs Hill  continued, "that if his honour will but pay me time enough for the burial, I  can make shift with what I have till then.
But when my poor Billy died, we were  sadly off indeed, for we could not bear but bury my poor Billy prettily, because it was  the last we could do for my poor Billy: but we could hardly scrape up enough for it, and  yet we all went without we dinners to help forward, except the little one of  all.
But that did not much matter, for we had no great heart for eating.".
"I cannot bear this!"
cried Cecilia; "you must tell me no more of my poor BillyBilly;  but go home, and chear your spirits, and do every thing in your power to save  your husband."
"I will, madam," answered Mrs Hill, "and his dying prayers shall bless you!
and all my children shall bless you, and every night all my children shall pray for you.
And oh!
"—again bursting into tears, "that Billy was but alive to pray for you  too!"
Cecilia kindly endeavoured to soothe Cecilia, but the poor creature, no longer able  to suppress the violence of Cecilia awakened sorrows, cried out, "I must go, madam,  and pray for Cecilia at home, for now I have once begun crying again, I don't know  how to have done!"
and hurried away.
Cecilia determined to make once more an effort with Mr Harrel for the payment  of the bill, and if that, in two days, did not succeed, to take up money for  the discharge of it Cecilia, and rest all Cecilia security for reimbursement upon  the shame with which such a proceeding must overwhelm Mr Harrel.
Offended, however,  by the repulse she had already received from Mr Harrel, and disgusted by all she had  heard of Mr Harrel unfeeling negligence, she knew not how to address Mr Harrel, and  resolved upon applying again to Mr Arnott, who was already acquainted with the  affair, for advice and assistance.
Mr Arnott, though extremely gratified that she consulted Mr Arnott, betrayed by Mr Arnott  looks a hopelessness of success, that damped all she expectations.
Mr Arnott promised,  however, to speak to Mr Harrel upon the subject, but the promise was evidently  given to oblige the fair mediatrix, without any hope of advantage to the cause.
The next morning Mrs Hill again came, and again without payment was dismissed.
Mr Arnott then, at the request of Cecilia, followed Mr Harrel into Mr Harrel room, to  enquire into the reason of this breach of promise; Mr Arnott then, at the request of Cecilia continued some time  together, and when Mr Harrel returned to Cecilia, Mr Harrel told Cecilia, that Mr Harrel brother had  assured Mr Harrel Mr Harrel would give orders to Davison, Mr Harrel gentleman, to let Cecilia have the  money the next day.
The pleasure with which Cecilia would have heard this intelligence was much checked  by the grave and cold manner in which this intelligence was communicated: Cecilia waited,  therefore, with more impatience than confidence for the result of this fresh  assurance.
The next morning, however, was the same as the last; Mrs Hill came, saw  Davison, and was sent away.
Cecilia, to whom Cecilia related Cecilia grievances, then flew to Mr Arnott, and  entreated Mr Arnott to enquire at least of Davison why Mrs Hill had again been  disappointed.
Mr Arnott obeyed Mrs Hill, and brought for answer, that Davison had received no  orders from Davison master.
"I entreat you then," cried Mrs Hill, with mingled eagerness and vexation, "to go,  for the last time, to Mr Harrel.
I am sorry to impose upon you an office so  disagreeable, but I am sure you compassionate these poor people, and will serve  these poor people now with your interest, as you have already done with your purse.
I only  wish to know if there has been any mistake, or if these delays are merely to  sicken me of petitioning."
Mr Arnott, with a repugnance to the request which Mr Arnott could as ill conceal as  Mr Arnott admiration of the zealous requester, again forced Mr Arnott to follow Mr  Harrel.
Mr Arnott stay was not long, and Cecilia at Mr Arnott return perceived that Mr Arnott was  hurt and disconcerted.
As soon as he was  hurt and disconcerted were alone together, Cecilia at his return begged to know  what had passed?
"Nothing," answered Mr Arnott, "that will give you any pleasure.
When  I entreated my brother to come to the point, Mr Arnott said it was Mr Arnott intention to  pay all Mr Arnott workmen together, for that if Mr Arnott paid any one singly, all the rest  would be dissatisfied."
"And why," said Cecilia, "should Mr Arnott not pay them at once?
There can be no more  comparison in the value of the money to Mr Arnott and to them, than, to speak with  truth, there is in Mr Arnott and in them right to it."
"But, madam, the bills for the new house itself are none of the bills for the new house itself settled, and  Mr Arnott says that the moment Mr Arnott is known to discharge an account for the Temple, Mr Arnott  shall not have any rest for the clamours the clamours will raise among the workmen who  were employed about the new house itself."
"How infinitely strange!"
exclaimed Cecilia; "will Mr Arnott not, then, pay anybody?"
"Next quarter, Mr Arnott says, Mr Arnott shall pay them all, but, at present, Mr Arnott has a  particular call for Mr Arnott money."
Cecilia would not trust Cecilia to make any comments upon such an avowal, but  thanking Mr Arnott for the trouble which Mr Arnott had taken, Cecilia determined, without  any further application, to desire Mr Harrel to advance Cecilia 20 pounds the next  morning, and satisfy the carpenter Cecilia, be the risk what the carpenter might.
The following day, therefore, which was the Saturday when payment was promised,  Cecilia begged an audience of Mr Harrel; which Mr Harrel immediately granted; but, before  Cecilia could make Cecilia demand, Mr Harrel said to Cecilia, with an air of the utmost gaiety and  good-humour, "Well, Miss Beverley, how fares it with your protegee?
I hope, at  length, Cecilia is contented.
But I must beg you would charge Cecilia to keep Cecilia own  counsel, as otherwise Cecilia will draw me into a scrape I shall not thank Cecilia for."
"Have you, then, paid Cecilia?"
cried Cecilia, with much amazement.
"Yes; I promised you I would, you know."
this intelligence equally delighted and astonished Cecilia; Cecilia repeatedly thanked  Mr Harrel for Mr Harrel attention to Cecilia petition, and, eager to communicate Cecilia success to Mr ArnottMr Arnott, Cecilia hastened to find Mr Harrel.
"Now," cried Cecilia, "I shall torment you no  more with painful commissions; the Hills, at last, are paid!"
"From you, madam," answered Mr Harrel gravely, "no commissions could be painful."
"Well, but," said Cecilia, somewhat disappointed, "you don't seem glad of this?"
"Yes," answered Mr Harrel, with a forced smile, "I am very glad to see you so."
"But how was this brought about?
did Mr Harrel relent?
or did you attack Mr Harrel  again?"
The hesitation of Mr Harrel answer convinced Cecilia there was some mystery in the  transaction; Cecilia began to apprehend Cecilia had been deceived, and hastily quitting  the room, sent for Mrs Hill: but the moment Mrs Hill appeared, Cecilia was  satisfied of the contrary, for, almost frantic with joy and gratitude, Cecilia  immediately flung Cecilia upon Cecilia knees, to thank Cecilia benefactress for having  seen Cecilia righted.
Cecilia then gave Cecilia some general advice, promised to continue Cecilia friend, and  offered Cecilia assistance in getting Cecilia husband into an hospital; but Cecilia told  Cecilia her husband had already been in one many months, where her husband had been pronounced  incurable, and therefore was desirous to spend her husband last days in her husband own  lodgings.
"Well," said Cecilia, "make them as easy to her husband as you, can, and come to me  next week, and I will try to put you in a better way of living."
Cecilia then, still greatly perplexed about Mr Arnott, sought Mr Arnott again, and, after  various questions and conjectures, at length brought Mr Arnott to confess Mr Arnott had  Mr Arnott lent Mr Arnott brother the sum with which the Hills had been paid.
Struck with Mr Arnott generosity, Cecilia poured forth thanks and praises so grateful to  Mr Arnott ears, that Cecilia soon gave Mr Arnott a recompense which Mr Arnott would have thought  cheaply purchased by half Mr Arnott fortune.
