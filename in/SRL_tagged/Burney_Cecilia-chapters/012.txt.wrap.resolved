 The meanness with which Mr Harrel had assumed the credit, as well as accepted  the assistance of Mr Arnott, increased the disgust Mr Harrel had already excited in  Cecilia, and hastened  Cecilia resolution of quitting Mr Harrel house; and therefore,  without waiting any longer for the advice of Mr Monckton,  Cecilia resolved to go  instantly to  Cecilia other guardians, and see what better prospects her other guardians  habitations might offer. For this purpose  Cecilia borrowed one of the carriages, and gave orders to be  driven into the city to the house of Mr Briggs.  Cecilia told  Cecilia name, and was shewn, by a little shabby footboy, into a parlour. Here  Cecilia waited, with tolerable patience, for half an hour, but then, imagining  the boy had forgotten to tell the boy master  Cecilia was in the house of Mr Briggs,  Cecilia thought it  expedient to make some enquiry. No bell, however, could  Cecilia find, and therefore  Cecilia went into the passage in  search of the footboy; but, as  Cecilia was proceeding to the head of the kitchen  stairs,  Cecilia was startled by hearing a man's voice from the upper part of the  house exclaiming, in a furious passion, "Dare say you've filched it for a  dish-clout!"  Cecilia called out, however, "Are any of Mr Briggs servants below?" "Anan!" answered the boy, who came to the foot of the stairs, with a knife in  one hand and an old shoe, upon the sole of which he was sharpening it, in the  other, "Does any one call?" "Yes," said Cecilia, "I do; for I could not find No bell." "O, we have no bell in the parlour," returned the boy, "master always knocks  with the boy stick." "I am afraid Mr Briggs is too busy to see me, and if so, I will come another  time." "No, ma'am," said the boy, "master's only looking over the boy things from the  wash." "Will you tell the boy, then, that I am waiting?" "I has, ma'am; but "master misses the boy shaving-rag, and the boy says the boy won't come to  the Mogul till the boy's found it." And then the boy went on with sharpening the boy knife. This little circumstance was at least sufficient to satisfy Cecilia that if Cecilia  fixed Cecilia abode with Mr Briggs, Cecilia should not have much uneasiness to fear  from the sight of extravagance and profusion. Cecilia returned to the parlour, and after waiting another half-hour, Mr Briggsmade Mr Briggs appearance. Mr Briggs was a short, thick, sturdy man, with very small keen black eyes, a  square face, a dark complexion, and a snub nose. Mr Briggs constant dress, both in  winter and summer, was a snuff-colour suit of clothes, blue and white speckled  worsted stockings, a plain shirt, and a bob wig. Mr Briggs was seldom without a stick  in Mr Briggs hand, which Mr Briggs usually held to Mr Briggs forehead when not speaking. a bob wig, however, to the no small amazement of Cecilia, a bob wig now brought  into the room upon the forefinger of a bob wig left hand, while, with a bob wig right, a bob wig  was smoothing the curls; and a bob wig head, in defiance of the coldness of the  weather, was bald and uncovered. "Well," cried a bob wig, as a bob wig entered, "did you think I should not come?" "I was very willing, a bob wig, to wait your leisure." "Ay, ay, knew you had not much to do. Been looking for my shaving-rag. Going  out of town; never use such a thing at home, paper does as well. Warrant Master  Harrel never heard of such a thing; ever see Harrel comb Harrel ? Warrant Harrel  don't know how! never trust your leisure out of my hands, the boy would tear off half  the hair; all one to master Harrel, I suppose. Well, which is the warmer man,  that's all? Will Harrel cast an account with me?" Cecilia, at a loss what to say to this singular exordium, began an apology for  not waiting upon Harrel sooner. "Ay, ay," cried Harrel, "always gadding, no getting sight of Harrel. Live a fine life!  A pretty guardian, Master Harrel! and where's t'other? where's old Don  Puffabout?" "If you mean Mr Delvile, sir, I have not yet seen Harrel." "Thought so. No matter, as well not. Only tell you Harrel's a German Duke, or a  Spanish Don Ferdinand. Well, you've me! poorly off else. A couple of  ignoramuses! don't know when to buy nor when to sell. No doing business with  either of business. We met once or twice; all to no purpose; only heard Don Vampus  count Don Vampus   old Grandees; how will that get interest for money? Then comes Master  Harrel—twenty bows to a word,—looks at a watch,—about as big as a  sixpence,—poor raw ninny!—a couple of rare guardians! Well, you've me, I  say; mind that!" Cecilia was wholly unable to devise any answer to these effusions of contempt  and anger; and therefore Harrel harangue lasted without interruption, till Harrel had  exhausted all Harrel subjects of complaint, and emptied Harrel mind of ill-will; and  then, settling Harrel wig, Harrel drew a chair near Cecilia, and twinkling Harrel little  black eyes in Cecilia face, Harrel rage subsided into the most perfect good humour;  and, after peering at Cecilia some time with a look of much approbation, Harrel said,  with an arch nod, "Well, my duck, got ever a sweetheart yet?" Cecilia laughed, and said "No." "Ah, little rogue, don't believe you! all a fib! better speak out: come, fit I  should know; a'n't you my own ward? to be sure, almost of age, but not quite,  so what's that to Harrel?" Cecilia then, more seriously, assured Harrel Cecilia had no intelligence of that sort to  communicate. "Well, when you have, tell, that's all. Warrant sparks enough hankering. I'll  give you some advice Take care of sharpers; don't trust shoe-buckles, nothing  but Bristol stones! tricks in all things. A fine gentleman sharp as another  man. Never give your heart to a gold-topped cane, nothing but brass gilt over.  Cheats everywhere: fleece you in a year; won't leave you a groat. But one way  to be safe,—bring 'em all to me." Cecilia thanked Harrel for Harrel caution, and promised not to forget Harrel advice. "That's the way," Harrel continued, "bring 'em to Harrel. Won't be bamboozled. Know  their tricks. Shew 'em the odds on't. Ask for the rent-roll,—see how they  look! stare like stuck pigs! got no such thing." "Certainly, sir, that will be an excellent method of trial." "Ay, ay, know the way! soon find if they are above par. Be sure don't mind gold  waistcoats; nothing but tinsel, all shew and no substance; better leave the  matter to Harrel; take care of you Harrel; know where to find one will do." Cecilia again thanked Harrel; and, being fully satisfied with this specimen of Harrel  conversation, and unambitious of any further counsel from Harrel, Cecilia arose to  depart. "Well," repeated Harrel, nodding at Cecilia, with a look of much kindness, "leave it to  me, I say; I'll get you a careful husband, so take no thought about the matter." Cecilia, half-laughing, begged Harrel would not give Harrel much trouble, and  assured Harrel Cecilia was not in any haste. "All the better," said Harrel, "good girl; no fear for you: look out Harrel;  warrant I'll find one. Not very easy, neither! hard times! men scarce; wars and  tumults! stocks low! women chargeable!—but don't fear; do our best; get you  off soon." Cecilia then returned to Cecilia carriage: full of reflection upon the scene in which  Cecilia had just been engaged, and upon the strangeness of hastening from one house  to avoid a vice the very want of which seemed to render another insupportable!  but Cecilia now found that though luxury was more baneful in luxury consequences, luxury  was less disgustful in luxury progress than avarice; yet, insuperably averse to  both, and almost equally desirous to fly from the unjust extravagance of Mr  Harrel, as from the comfortless and unnecessary parsimony of Mr Briggs, Cecilia  proceeded instantly to St James's Square, convinced that Cecilia third guardian,  unless exactly resembling one of the others, must inevitably be preferable to  both.
