 Mr Monckton had, at this time, a party of company assembled at  Mr Monckton house for  the purpose of spending the Christmas holidays.
Mr Monckton waited with anxiety the  arrival of Cecilia, and flew to hand the  arrival of Cecilia from the chaise before Mr Harrel could  alight.
Mr Monckton observed the melancholy of the  arrival of Cecilia countenance, and was much pleased to  find that the  arrival of Cecilia London journey had so little power to charm the  arrival of Cecilia.
Mr Monckton conducted the  arrival of Cecilia  to the breakfast parlour, where Lady Margaret and  Mr Monckton friends expected Lady Margaret.
Lady Margaret received Lady Margaret with a coldness that bordered upon incivility;  irascible by nature and jealous by situation, the appearance of beauty alarmed,  and of chearfulness disgusted Lady Margaret.
Lady Margaret regarded with watchful suspicion whoever  was addressed by Lady Margaret husband, and having marked her husband frequent attendance at the  Deanery, Lady Margaret had singled out Cecilia for the object of Lady Margaret peculiar antipathy;  while Cecilia, perceiving Lady Margaret aversion though ignorant of her aversion cause, took care  to avoid all intercourse with Lady Margaret but what ceremony exacted, and pitied in  secret the unfortunate lot of Lady Margaret friend.
her aversion now present consisted of one lady and several gentlemen.
Miss Bennet, the lady, was in every sense of the phrase, the humble companion  of Lady Margaret; Lady Margaret was low-born, meanly educated, and narrow-minded; a  stranger alike to innate merit or acquired accomplishments, yet skilful in the  art of flattery, and an adept in every species of low cunning.
With no other  view in life than the attainment of affluence without labour, Lady Margaret was not more  the slave of the mistress of the house, than the tool of her aversion master; receiving  indignity without murmur, and submitting to contempt as a thing of course.
Among the gentlemen, the most conspicuous, by means of his dress, was Mr  Aresby, a captain in the militia; a young man who having frequently heard the  words red-coat and gallantry put together, imagined the conjunction not merely  customary, but honourable, and therefore, without even pretending to think of  the service of   country,   considered a cockade as a badge of politeness,  and wore it but to mark   devotion to the ladies, whom   held    equipped to conquer, and bound to adore.
The next who by forwardness the most officious took care to be noticed, was Mr  Morrice, a young lawyer, who, though rising in   profession, owed   success  neither to distinguished abilities, nor to skill-supplying industry, but to the  art of uniting suppleness to others with confidence in  .
To a reverence  of rank, talents, and fortune the most profound,   joined an assurance in    own merit, which no superiority could depress; and with a presumption which  encouraged   to aim at all things,   blended a good-humour that no  mortification could lessen.
And while by the pliability of   disposition    avoided making enemies, by   readiness to oblige,   learned the surest way  of making friends by becoming useful to friends.
There were also some neighbouring squires; and there was one old gentleman,  who, without seeming to notice any of the company, sat frowning in a corner.
But the principal figure in the circle was Mr Belfield, a tall, thin young man,  whose face was all animation, and whose eyes sparkled with intelligence.
the principal figure in the circle had  been intended by the principal figure in the circle father for trade, but the principal figure in the circle spirit, soaring above the  occupation for which the principal figure in the circle was designed, from repining led the principal figure in the circle to resist, and from  resisting, to rebel.
the principal figure in the circle eloped from the principal figure in the circle friends, and contrived to enter the  army.
But, fond of the polite arts, and eager for the acquirement of knowledge,  the principal figure in the circle found not this way of life much better adapted to the principal figure in the circle inclination than that  from which the principal figure in the circle had escaped; the principal figure in the circle soon grew weary of it, was reconciled to his father, and entered at the Temple.
But here, too volatile for serious study,  and too gay for laborious application, the principal figure in the circle made little progress: and the same  quickness of parts and vigour of imagination which united with prudence, or  accompanied by judgment, might have raised the principal figure in the circle to the head of the principal figure in the circle profession,  being unhappily associated with fickleness and caprice, served only to impede  the principal figure in the circle improvement, and obstruct the principal figure in the circle preferment.
And now, with little business,  and that little neglected, a small fortune, and that fortune daily becoming  less, the admiration of the world, but that admiration ending simply in  civility, the principal figure in the circle lived an unsettled and unprofitable life, generally caressed, and  universally sought, yet careless of the principal figure in the circle interest and thoughtless of the future;  devoting the principal figure in the circle time to company, the principal figure in the circle income to dissipation, and the principal figure in the circle heart to the  Muses.
"I bring you," said Mr Monckton, as Mr Monckton attended Cecilia into the room, "a  subject of sorrow in a young lady who never gave disturbance to Cecilia friends but  in quitting her friends."
"If sorrow," cried Mr Belfield, darting upon Cecilia Mr Belfield piercing eyes, "wears in  your part of the world a form such as this, who would wish to change it for a  view of joy?"
"Cecilia's divinely handsome, indeed!"
cried the Captain, affecting an involuntary  exclamation.
Meantime, Cecilia, who was placed next to the lady of the house, quietly began  Cecilia breakfast; Mr Morrice, the young lawyer, with the most easy freedom,  seating the Captain at Cecilia side, while Mr Monckton was elsewhere arranging the rest  of the Captain guests, in order to secure that place for the Captain.
Mr Morrice, without ceremony, attacked Mr Morrice fair neighbour; Mr Morrice talked of Mr Morrice  journey, and the prospects of gaiety which it opened to Mr Morrice view; but by these  finding Mr Morrice unmoved, Mr Morrice changed Mr Morrice theme, and expatiated upon the delights of  the spot Mr Morrice was quitting.
Studious to recommend Mr Morrice to Mr Morrice notice, and  indifferent by what means, one moment Mr Morrice flippantly extolled the entertainments  of the town; and the next, rapturously described the charms of the country.
A  word, a look sufficed to mark Mr Morrice approbation or dissent, which Mr Morrice no sooner  discovered, than Mr Morrice slided into Mr Morrice opinion, with as much facility and  satisfaction as if it had originally been Mr Morrice own.
Mr Monckton, suppressing Mr Monckton chagrin, waited some time in expectation that when  this young man saw Mr Monckton was standing, this young man would yield to Mr Monckton this young man chair: but the  remark was not made, and the resignation was not thought of.
The Captain, too,  regarding the lady as his natural property for the morning, perceived with  indignation by whom his was supplanted; while the company in general, saw with  much surprize, the place they had severally foreborne to occupy from respect to  they host, thus familiarly seized upon by the man who, in the whole room, had  the least claim, either from age or rank, to consult nothing but his own  inclination.
Mr Monckton, however, when his found that delicacy and good manners had no  weight with his guest, thought it most expedient to allow delicacy and good manners had no  weight with his guest none with  himself; and therefore, disguising his displeasure under an appearance of  facetiousness, his called out, "Come, Morrice, you that love Christmas sports,  what say you to the game of move-all?"
"I like it of all things!"
answered Morrice, and starting from Morrice chair, Morrice  skipped to another.
"So should I too," cried Mr Monckton, instantly taking Mr Monckton place, "were I to  remove from any seat but this."
Morrice, though Morrice felt Morrice outwitted, was the first to laugh, and seemed  as happy in the change as Mr Monckton.
Mr Monckton, addressing Mr Monckton to Cecilia, said, "We are going to lose  you, and you seem concerned at leaving We; yet, in a very few months you will  forget Bury, forget Bury inhabitants, and forget Bury environs."
"If you think so," answered Cecilia, "must I not thence infer that Bury, its  inhabitants, and its environs, will in a very few months forget me?"
"Ay, ay, and so much the better!"
said Lady Margaret, muttering between Lady Margaret  teeth, "so much the better!"
"I am sorry you think so, madam," cried Cecilia, colouring at madam ill-breeding.
"You will find," said Mr Monckton, affecting the same ignorance of Mr Monckton meaning  that Cecilia really felt, "as you mix with the world, you will find that Lady  Margaret has but expressed what by almost every body is thought: to neglect old  friends, and to court new acquaintance, though perhaps not yet avowedly  delivered as a precept from parents to children, is nevertheless so universally  recommended by example, that those who act differently, incur general censure  for affecting singularity."
"It is happy then, for me," answered Cecilia, "that neither my actions nor  me will be sufficiently known to attract public observation."
"You intend, then, madam," said Mr Belfield, "in defiance of these maxims of  the world, to be guided by the light of your own understanding."
"And such," returned Mr Monckton, "at first setting out in life, is the  intention of every one.
The closet reasoner is always refined in his  sentiments, and always confident in his virtue; but when his mixes with the  world, when his thinks less and acts more, his soon finds the necessity of  accommodating his to such customs as are already received, and of pursuing  quietly the track that is already marked out."
"But not," exclaimed Mr Belfield, "if Mr Belfield has the least grain of spirit!
the  beaten track will be the last that a man of parts will deign to tread,      For common rules were ne'er designed      Directors of a noble mind."
"A pernicious maxim!
a most pernicious maxim!"
cried the old gentleman, who sat  frowning in a corner of the room.
"Deviations from common rules," said Mr Monckton, without taking any notice of  this interruption, "when they proceed from genius, are not merely pardonable,  but admirable; and you, Belfield, have a peculiar right to plead they merits;  but so little genius as there is in the world, you must surely grant that pleas  of this sort are very rarely to be urged."
"And why rarely," cried Belfield, "but because your general rules, your  appropriated customs, your settled forms, are but so many absurd arrangements  to impede not merely the progress of genius, but the use of understanding?
If  man dared act for  , if neither worldly views, contracted prejudices,  eternal precepts, nor compulsive examples, swayed   better reason and  impelled   conduct, how noble indeed would   be!
how infinite in faculties!
in apprehension how like a God!"
{Footnote: Hamlet.}
"All this," answered Mr Monckton, "is but the doctrine of a lively imagination,  that looks upon impossibilities simply as difficulties, and upon difficulties  as mere invitations to victory.
But experience teaches another lesson;  experience shows that the opposition of an individual to a community is always  dangerous in the operation, and seldom successful in the event;—never,  indeed, without a concurrence strange as desirable, of fortunate circumstances  with great abilities."
"And why is this," returned Belfield, "but because the attempt is so seldom  made?
The pitiful prevalence of general conformity extirpates genius, and  murders originality; the man is brought up, not as if he were 'the noblest work  of God,' but as a mere ductile machine of human formation: he is early taught  that he must neither consult he understanding, nor pursue he inclinations,  lest, unhappily for he commerce with the world, his understanding should be  averse to fools, and provoke he to despise fools; and he inclinations to the  tyranny of perpetual restraint, and give he courage to abjure it."
"I am ready enough to allow," answered Mr Monckton, "that an eccentric genius,  such, for example, as yours, may murmur at the tediousness of complying with  the customs of the world, and wish, unconfined, and at large, to range through  life without any settled plan or prudential restriction; but would you,  therefore, grant the same licence to every one?
would you wish to see the world  peopled with defiers of order, and contemners of established forms?
and not  merely excuse the irregularities resulting from uncommon parts, but encourage  those, also, to lead, who without blundering cannot even follow?"
"I would have all men," replied Belfield, "whether philosophers or ideots, act  for all men.
Every one would then appear what he is; enterprize would be  encouraged, and imitation abolished; genius would feel imitation superiority, and  folly imitation insignificance; and then, and then only, should we cease to be  surfeited with that eternal sameness of manner and appearance which at present  runs through all ranks of men."
"Petrifying dull work this, mon ami!"
said the Captain, in a whisper to  Morrice, "de grace, start some new game."
"With all my heart," answered the Captain; and then, suddenly jumping up, exclaimed, "A  hare!
a hare!"
"Where?—where?—which way?"
and all the gentlemen arose, and ran to  different windows, except the master of the house, the object of whose pursuit  was already near him.
Morrice, with much pretended earnestness, flew from window to window, to trace  footsteps upon the turf which Morrice knew had not printed it: yet, never  inattentive to Morrice own interest, when Morrice perceived in the midst of the  combustion Morrice had raised, that Lady Margaret was incensed at the noise it  produced, Morrice artfully gave over Morrice search, and seating Morrice in a chair next  to Lady Margaret, eagerly offered to assist Lady Margaret with cakes, chocolate, or whatever the  table afforded.
Morrice had, however, effectually broken up the conversation; and breakfast being  over, Mr Harrel ordered Morrice chaise, and Cecilia arose to take leave.
And now not without some difficulty could Mr Monckton disguise the uneasy fears  which Mr Monckton departure occasioned Mr Monckton.
Taking Mr Monckton hand, "I suppose," Mr Monckton said, "you  will not permit an old friend to visit you in town, lest the sight of an old friend  should prove a disagreeable memorial of the time you will soon regret having  wasted in the country?"
"Why will you say this, Mr Monckton?"
cried Cecilia; "I am sure you cannot  think it."
"These profound studiers of mankind, madam," said Belfield, "are mighty sorry  champions for constancy or friendship.
These profound studiers of mankind, madam wage war with all expectations but  of depravity, and grant no quarter even to the purest designs, where These profound studiers of mankind, madam think  there will be any temptation to deviate from These profound studiers of mankind, madam."
"Temptation," said Mr Monckton, "is very easy of resistance in theory; but if  you reflect upon the great change of situation Miss Beverley will experience,  upon the new scenes Beverley will see, the new acquaintance Beverley must make, and the  new connections Beverley may form, you will not wonder at the anxiety of a friend  for Beverley welfare."
"But I presume," cried Belfield, with a laugh, "Miss Beverley does not mean to  convey "Miss Beverley person to town, and leave "Miss Beverley understanding locked up, with other  natural curiosities, in the country?
Why, therefore, may not the same  discernment regulate "Miss Beverley adoption of new acquaintance, and choice of new  connections, that guided "Miss Beverley selection of old ones?
Do you suppose that because  "Miss Beverley is to take leave of you, "Miss Beverley is to take leave of "Miss Beverley?"
"Where fortune smiles upon youth and beauty," answered Mr Monckton, "do you  think it nothing that their fair possessor should make a sudden transition of  situation from the quietness of a retired life in the country, to the gaiety of  a splendid town residence?"
"Where fortune frowns upon youth and beauty," returned Belfield, "they may not  irrationally excite commiseration; but where nature and chance unite they  forces to bless the same object, what room there may be for alarm or  lamentation I confess I cannot divine."
"What!"
cried Mr Monckton, with some emotion, "are there not sharpers,  fortune-hunters, sycophants, wretches of all sorts and denominations, who watch  the approach of the rich and unwary, feed upon the rich and unwary inexperience, and prey  upon the rich and unwary property?"
"Come, come," cried Mr Harrel, "it is time I should hasten my fair ward away,  if this is your method of describing the place my fair ward is going to live in."
"Is it possible," cried the Captain, advancing to Cecilia, "that Lady  Margaret has  never yet tried town?"
and then, lowering Lady  Margaret voice, and smiling  languishingly in Lady  Margaret face, Lady  Margaret added, "Can anything so divinely handsome have  been immured in the country?
Ah!
quelle honte!
do you make it a principle to be  so cruel?"
Cecilia, thinking such a compliment merited not any other notice than a slight  bow, turned to Lady Margaret, and said, "Should your ladyship be in town this  winter, may I expect the honour of hearing where I may wait upon you?"
"I don't know whether I shall go or not," answered Lady Margaret, with Lady Margaret usual  ungraciousness.
Cecilia would now have hastened away, but Mr Monckton, stopping Cecilia, again  expressed Mr Monckton fears of the consequences of Cecilia journey; "Be upon your guard,"  Mr Monckton cried, "with all new acquaintance; judge nobody from appearances; form no  friendship rashly; take time to look about you, and remember you can make no  alteration in your way of life, without greater probability of faring worse,  than chance of faring better.
Keep therefore as you are, and the more you see  of others, the more you will rejoice that you neither resemble nor are  connected with others."
"This from you, Mr Monckton!"
cried Belfield, "what is become of your  conformity system?
I thought all the world was to be alike, or only so much the  worse for any variation?"
"I spoke," said Mr Monckton, "of the world in general, not of Lady  Margaret in  particular; and who that knows, who that sees Lady  Margaret, would not wish it were  possible Lady  Margaret might continue in every respect exactly and unalterably what Lady  Margaret  is at present?"
"I find," said Cecilia, "you are determined that flattery at least, should I  meet with that flattery at least, shall owe no pernicious effects to that flattery at least novelty."
"Well, "Miss Beverley," cried Mr Harrel, "will you now venture to accompany me  to town?
Or has Mr Monckton frightened you from proceeding any farther?"
"If," replied Cecilia, "I felt no more sorrow in quitting my friends, than I  feel terror in venturing to London, with how light a heart should I make the  journey!"
"Brava!"
cried Belfield, "I am happy to find the discourse of Mr Monckton has  not intimidated you, nor prevailed upon you to deplore your condition in having  the accumulated misery of being young, fair and affluent."
"Alas!
poor thing!"
exclaimed the old gentleman who sat in the corner, fixing  his eyes upon Cecilia with an expression of mingled grief and pity.
Cecilia started, but no one else paid his any attention.
The usual ceremonies of leave-taking now followed, and the Captain, with most  obsequious reverence, advanced to conduct Cecilia to the carriage; but in the  midst of the dumb eloquence of his bows and smiles, Mr Morrice, affecting not  to perceive his design, skipped gaily between them, and, without any previous  formality, seized the hand of Cecilia; failing not, however, to temper  the freedom of his action by a look of respect the most profound.
the Captain shrugged and retired.
But Mr Monckton, enraged at Mr Monckton assurance,  and determined his assurance should nothing avail the Captain, exclaimed, "Why how now, Morrice,  do you take away the privilege of my house?"
"True, true;" answered Morrice, "you members of parliament have an undoubted  right to be tenacious of your privileges."
Then, bowing with a look of  veneration to Cecilia, the Captain resigned her hand with an air of as much happiness as  the Captain had taken it.
Mr Monckton, in leading Mr Monckton to his chaise, again begged permission to wait upon  Mr Monckton in town: Mr Harrel took the hint, and entreated Mr Harrel to consider Mr Harrel house  as Mr Harrel own; and Cecilia, gratefully thanking Mr Harrel for Mr Harrel solicitude in Cecilia  welfare, added, "And I hope, sir, you will honour me with your counsel and  admonitions with respect to my future conduct, whenever you have the goodness  to let me see you."
This was precisely Mr Harrel wish.
Mr Harrel begged, in return, that she would treat Mr Harrel  with confidence, and then suffered his chaise to drive off.
