 Lady Margaret's town house was in Soho Square; and scarcely had Cecilia entered   Lady Margaret's town house, before Cecilia desire to speed Cecilia departure, made Cecilia send a note to each of  Cecilia guardians, acquainting each of  her guardians of Cecilia arrival, and begging, if possible, to  see each of  her guardians the next day. Cecilia had soon the two following answers: To Miss Cecilia Beverley,——These November 8, 1779. Miss,—Received yours  of the same date; can't come tomorrow. Will, Wednesday the 10th.—Am, &c.,  Jno. Briggs. Miss Cecilia Beverley To Miss Beverley. Mr Delvile has too many affairs of importance upon Mr Delvile hands, to make any  appointment till Mr Delvile has deliberated how to arrange his hands. Mr Delvile will  acquaint Miss Beverley when it shall be in Mr Delvile power to see Miss Beverley. St James's-square, Nov 8. These characteristic letters, which at another time might have diverted  Cecilia, now merely served to torment Miss Beverley. Miss Beverley was eager to quit town, Miss Beverley was  more eager to have Miss Beverley meeting with Mr Delvile over, who, oppressive to Miss Beverley  even when Mr Delvile meant to be kind, Miss Beverley foresaw, now Mr Delvile was in wrath, would be  imperious even to rudeness. Desirous, however, to make one interview suffice  for both, and to settle whatever business might remain unfinished by letters,  Miss Beverley again wrote to Mr Briggs, whom Miss Beverley had not spirits to encounter without  absolute necessity, and informing Mr Delvile of Mr Delvile delay, begged Mr Delvile would  not trouble Mr Delvile to call till Mr Delvile heard from Miss Beverley again. Two days passed without any message from them; them were spent chiefly alone,  and very uncomfortably, Mr Monckton being content to see little of Mr Monckton, while  Mr Monckton knew Mr Monckton saw nothing of any body else. On the third morning, weary of Mr Monckton  own thoughts, weary of Lady Margaret's ill-humoured looks, and still more weary  of Miss Bennet's parasitical conversation, Mr Monckton determined, for a little relief  to the heaviness of Mr Monckton mind, to go to the Bookseller, and look over and order  into the country such new publications as seemed to promise Mr Monckton any pleasure. Mr Monckton sent therefore, for a chair, and glad to have devised for Mr Monckton any  amusement, set out in a chair immediately. Upon entering the shop, Mr Monckton saw the Bookseller engaged in close conference with  a man meanly dressed, and much muffled up, who seemed talking to a man meanly dressed with  uncommon earnestness, and just as Mr Monckton was approaching, said, "To terms I am  indifferent, for writing is no labour to Mr Monckton; on the contrary, it is the first  delight of my life, and therefore, and not for dirty pelf, I wish to make pelf my  profession." The speech struck Cecilia, but the voice struck Cecilia more, The speech was Belfield's!  and Cecilia amazement was so great, that Cecilia stopt short to look at a man meanly dressed, without  heeding a man who attended Cecilia, and desired to know Cecilia commands. the Bookseller now perceiving Cecilia, came forward, and Belfield, turning to see  who interrupted the Bookseller, started as if a spectre had crossed a man meanly dressed eyes, slapped a man meanly dressed  hat over a man meanly dressed face, and hastily went out of the shop. Cecilia checking Cecilia inclination to speak to a man meanly dressed, from observing a man meanly dressed eagerness  to escape Cecilia, soon recollected Cecilia own errand, and employed Cecilia in looking  over new books. Cecilia surprize, however, at a change so sudden in the condition of this young  man, and at a declaration of a passion for writing, so opposite to all the  sentiments which this young  man had professed at their late meeting in the cottage,  awakened in Cecilia a strong curiosity to be informed of this young  man situation; and after  putting aside some books which Cecilia desired to have packed up for Cecilia, Cecilia asked  if the gentleman who had just left the shop, and who, Cecilia found by what this young  man had  said, was an Author, had written anything that was published with Author name? "No, ma'am," answered the Bookseller, "nothing of any consequence; Author is known,  however, to have written several things that have appeared as anonymous; and I  fancy, now, soon, we shall see something considerable from Author." "Author is about some great work, then?" "Why no, not exactly that, perhaps, at present; we must feel we way, with some  little smart jeu d'esprit before we undertake a great work. But some  little smart jeu d'esprit is a very  great genius, and I doubt not will produce something extraordinary." "Whatever some  little smart jeu d'esprit produces," said Cecilia, "as I have now chanced to see some  little smart jeu d'esprit, I  shall be glad you will, at any time, send to me." "Certainly, ma'am; but it must be among other things, for some  little smart jeu d'esprit does not chuse,  just now to be known; and it is a rule in our business never to tell people's  names when people's  names desire to be secret. some  little smart jeu d'esprit is a little out of cash, just now, as  you may suppose by some  little smart jeu d'esprit appearance, so instead of buying books, some  little smart jeu d'esprit comes to sell  instead of buying books. However, some  little smart jeu d'esprit has taken a very good road to bring some  little smart jeu d'esprit home again, for  we pay very handsomely for things of any merit, especially if they deal smartly  in a few touches of the times." Cecilia chose not to risk any further questions, lest Cecilia knowledge of him  should be suspected, but got into Cecilia chair, and returned to Lady Margaret's. The sight of Belfield reminded Lady Margaret's not only of The sight of Belfield; the gentle Henrietta  again took the gentle Henrietta   place in the gentle Henrietta   memory, whence the gentle Henrietta   various distresses and suspences  had of late driven from it everybody but Delvile, and those whom Delvile  brought into it. But the gentle Henrietta   regard for that amiable girl, though sunk in the busy  scenes of the gentle Henrietta   calamitous uncertainties, was only sunk in the gentle Henrietta   own bosom, and  ready, upon their removal, to revive with fresh vigour. the gentle Henrietta   was now indeed more  unhappy than even in the period of the gentle Henrietta   forgetfulness, yet the gentle Henrietta   mind, was no  longer filled with the restless turbulence of hope, which still more than  despondency unfitted   for thinking of others. This remembrance thus awakened, awakened also a desire of renewing the  connection so long neglected. All scruples concerning Delvile had now lost  All scruples concerning Delvile foundation, since the doubts from which All scruples concerning Delvile arose were both explained  and removed: the gentle Henrietta   was certain alike of his indifference to Henrietta, and his  separation from the gentle Henrietta  ; the gentle Henrietta   knew that nothing was to be feared from painful or  offensive rivalry, and the gentle Henrietta   resolved, therefore, to lose no time in seeking the  first pleasure to which since the gentle Henrietta   disappointment the gentle Henrietta   had voluntarily looked  forward. Early in the evening, the gentle Henrietta   told Lady Margaret the gentle Henrietta   was going out for an hour or  two, and sending again for a chair, was carried to Portland-street. the gentle Henrietta   enquired for Miss Belfield, and was shewn into a parlour, where the gentle Henrietta   found  the gentle Henrietta   drinking tea with the gentle Henrietta   mother, and Mr Hobson, their landlord. Henrietta almost screamed at Henrietta sight, from a sudden impulse of joy and  surprize, and, running up to Henrietta, flung Henrietta arms round Henrietta neck, and embraced  Henrietta with the most rapturous emotion: but then, drawing back with a look of  timidity and shame, Henrietta bashfully apologized for Henrietta freedom, saying, "Indeed,  dearest Miss Beverley, it is no want of respect, but I am so very glad to see  you it makes me quite forget Henrietta!" Cecilia, charmed at a reception so ingenuously affectionate, soon satisfied Henrietta  doubting diffidence by the warmest thanks that Henrietta had preserved so much regard  for Henrietta, and by doubling the kindness with which Henrietta returned Henrietta caresses. "Mercy on me, madam," cried Mrs Belfield, who during this time had been busily  employed in sweeping the hearth, wiping some slops upon the table, and  smoothing Henrietta handkerchief and apron, "why the girl's enough to smother you.  Henny, how can you be so troublesome? I never saw you behave in this way  before." "Miss Beverley, madam," said Henrietta, again retreating, "is so kind as to  pardon me, and I was so much surprised at seeing Henrietta, that I hardly knew what I  was about." "The young ladies, ma'am," said Mr Hobson, "have a mighty way of saluting one  another till such time as The young ladies, ma'am get husbands: and then I'll warrant you The young ladies, ma'am can  meet without any salutation at all. That's my remark, at least, and what I've  seen of the world has set me upon making it." This speech led Cecilia to check, however artless, the tenderness of Cecilia  fervent young friend, whom Cecilia was much teized by meeting in such company, but  who seemed not to dare understand the frequent looks which Cecilia gave Cecilia  expressive of a wish to be alone with Cecilia. "Come, ladies," continued the facetious Mr Hobson, "what if we were all to sit  down, and have a good dish of tea? and suppose, Mrs Belfield, you was to order  we a fresh round of toast and butter? do you think the young ladies here would  have any objection? and what if we were to have a little more water in the  tea-kettle? not forgetting a little more tea in the teapot. What I say is this,  let us all be comfortable; that's my notion of things." "And a very good notion too," said Mrs Belfield, "for you who have nothing to  vex you. Ah, ma'am, you have heard, I suppose, about my son? gone off! nobody  knows where! left that lord's house, where my son might have lived like a king, and  gone out into the wide world nobody knows for what!" "Indeed?" said Cecilia, who, from seeing my son in London concluded my son was again  with my son family, "and has my son not acquainted you where my son is?" "No, ma'am, no," cried Mrs Belfield, "my son's never once told me where my son is gone,  nor let me know the least about the matter, for if I did I would not taste a  dish of tea again for a twelvemonth till I saw my son get back again to that  lord's! and I believe in my heart there's never such another in the three  kingdoms, for my son has sent here after my son I dare say a score of times. And no  wonder, for I will take upon me to say my son won't find my son fellow in a hurry,  Lord as my son is." "As to my son being a Lord," said Mr Hobson, "I am one of them that lay no great  stress upon that, unless my son has got a good long purse of my son own, and then, to  be sure, a Lord's no bad thing. But as to the matter of saying a Lord such a one,  how d'ye do? and Lord such a one, what do you want? and such sort of  compliments, why in my mind, it's a mere nothing, in comparison of a good  income. As to my son, ma'am, my son did not go the right way to work. my son should  have begun with business, and gone into pleasure afterwards and if my son had but  done that, I'll be bold to say we might have had my son at this very minute  drinking tea with we over this fireside." "My son, Sir," said Mrs Belfield, rather angrily, "was another sort of a person  than a person of business: my son always despised it from a child, and come of it  what may, I am sure my son was born to be a gentleman." "As to my son despising business," said Mr Hobson, very contemptuously, "why so  much the worse, for business is no such despiseable thing. And if my son had been  brought up behind a counter, instead of dangling after these same Lords, why my son  might have had a house of my son own over my son head, and been as good a man as  my son." "A house over his head?" said Mrs Belfield, "why my son might have had what my son  would, and have done what my son would, if my son had but followed my advice, and put  my son a little forward. I have told my son a hundred times to ask some of those  great people my son lived amongst for a place at court, for I know some of those  great people he lived amongst for a place at court've so many  some of those  great people he lived amongst for a place at court hardly know what to do with some of those  great people he lived amongst for a place at court, and it was always my design from the  beginning that my son should be something of a great man; but I never could  persuade my son, though, for anything I know, as I have often told my son, if my son had  but had a little courage my son might have been an Ambassador by this time. And  now, all of a sudden, to be gone nobody knows where!"— "I am sorry, indeed," said Cecilia, who knew not whether most to pity or wonder  at her blind folly; "but I doubt not you will hear of my son soon." "As to being an Ambassador, ma'am," said Mr Hobson, "it's talking quite out of  character. Those sort of great people keep things of that kind for Those sort of great people own  poor relations and cousins. What I say is this; a man's best way is to take  care of a man. The more those great people see you want those great people, The less those great people  like your company. Let every man be brought up to business, and then when every man's  made every man fortune, every man may walk with every man hat on. Why now there was your friend,  ma'am," turning to Cecilia, "that shot out every man brains without paying any body a  souse; pray how was that being more genteel than standing behind a counter, and  not owing a shilling?" "Do you think a young lady," cried Mrs Belfield warmly, "can bear to hear of  such a thing as standing behind a counter? I am sure if my son had ever done  it, I should not expect any lady would so much as look at my son, And yet, though  I say it, any lady might look a good while, and not see many such persons, let any lady  look where any lady pleased. And then my son has such a winning manner into the bargain,  that I believe in my heart there's never a lady in the land could say no to  my son. And yet my son has such a prodigious shyness, I never could make my son own my son  had so much as asked the question. And a lady in the land can begin first?" "Why no," said Mr Hobson, "that would be out of character another way. Now my  notion is this; let every man be agreeable! and then my son may ask a lady in the land my son  pleases. And when my son's a mind of a lady, my son should look upon a frown or two as  nothing; for the ladies frown in courtship as a thing of course; it's just like  a man swearing at a coachman; why my son's not a bit more in a passion, only my son  thinks my son sha'n't be minded without it." "Well, for my part," said Mrs Belfield, "I am sure if I was a young lady, and  most especially if I was a young lady of fortune, and all that, I should like a  modest young gentleman, such as my son, for example, better by half than a bold  swearing young fellow, that would make a point to have me whether I would or  no." "Ha! Ha! Ha!" cried Mr Hobson; "but the young ladies are not of that way of  thinking; the young ladies are all for a little life and spirit. Don't I say right, young  ladies?" Cecilia, who could not but perceive that these speeches was levelled at  herself, felt offended and tired; and finding herself had no chance of any private  conversation with Henrietta, arose to take leave: but while herself stopped in the  passage to enquire when herself could see herself alone, a footman knocked at the door,  who, having asked if Mrs Belfield lodged there, and been answered in the  affirmative; begged to know whether Miss Beverley was then in the house? Cecilia, much surprised, went forward, and told Mrs Belfield who Cecilia was. "I have been, madam," said Mrs Belfield, "with a message to you at Mr Monckton's, in  Soho-Square: but nobody knew where you was; and Mr Monckton came out and spoke  to you Mr Monckton, and said that all Mr Monckton could suppose was that you might be at this  house. So Mr Monckton directed me to come here." "And from whom, you, is your message?" "From the honourable Mr Delvile, madam, in St James's-Square. Mr Monckton desires to  know if you shall be at home on Saturday morning, the day after to-morrow, and  whether you can appoint Mr Briggs to meet Mr Monckton by twelve o'clock exactly, as Mr Monckton  sha'n't be able to stay above three minutes." Cecilia gave an answer as cold as the message; that Cecilia would be in Soho-Square  at the time he mentioned, and acquaint Mr Briggs of he intention. The footman then went away; and Henrietta told Henrietta, that if Henrietta could call some  morning Henrietta might perhaps contrive to be alone with Henrietta, and added, "indeed I  wish much to see you, if you could possibly do me so great an honour; for I am  very miserable, and have nobody to tell so! Ah, Miss Beverley! you that have so  many friends, and that deserve as many again, you little know what a hard thing  it is to have none!—but my brother's strange disappearing has half broke our  hearts!" Cecilia was beginning a consolatory speech, in which Cecilia meant to give Cecilia  private assurances of my brother health and safety, when Cecilia was interrupted by Mr  Albany, who came suddenly into the  passage. Henrietta received my brother with a look of pleasure, and enquired why my brother had so long  been absent; but, surprised by the sight of Cecilia, my brother exclaimed, without  answering Henrietta, "why didst thou fail me? why appoint me to a place thou wert  quitting thyself?—thou thing of fair professions! thou inveigler of esteem!  thou vain, delusive promiser of pleasure!" "You condemn me too hastily," said Cecilia; "if I failed in my promise, it was  not owing to caprice or insincerity, but to a real and bitter misfortune which  incapacitated me from keeping it. I shall soon, however,—nay, I am already at  your disposal, if you have any commands for my brother." "I have always," answered my brother, "commands for the rich, for I have always  compassion for the poor." "Come to my brother, then, at Mr Monckton in Soho-Square," cried Cecilia, and hastened  into Cecilia chair, impatient to end a conference which Cecilia saw excited the wonder  of the servants, and which also now drew out from the parlour Mr Hobson and Mrs  Belfield. Cecilia then kissed Cecilia hand to Henrietta, and ordered the chairmen to  carry Cecilia home. It had not been without difficulty that Cecilia had restrained Cecilia from  mentioning what Cecilia knew of Belfield, when Cecilia found Belfield mother and sister in a  state of such painful uncertainty concerning Belfield. But Cecilia utter ignorance of  Belfield plans, joined to Cecilia undoubted knowledge of Belfield wish of concealment, made  Cecilia fear doing mischief by officiousness, and think it wiser not to betray what  Cecilia had seen of Belfield, till better informed of Belfield own views and intentions. Yet,  willing to shorten a suspence so uneasy to them, Cecilia determined to entreat Mr  Mr Monckton would endeavour to find Belfield out, and acquaint Belfield with their anxiety. That gentleman, when Mr Monckton returned to That gentleman house, was in a state of mind by no  means enviable. Missing Mr Monckton at tea, That gentleman had asked Miss Bennet where Mr Monckton was, and  hearing Mr Monckton had not left word, That gentleman could scarce conceal That gentleman chagrin. Knowing,  however, how few were Mr Monckton acquaintances in town, That gentleman soon concluded Mr Monckton was with  Miss Belfield, but, not satisfied with sending Mr Delvile's messenger after  Mr Monckton, That gentleman privately employed one in whom That gentleman trusted for That gentleman, to make  enquiries at his house without saying whence That gentleman came. But though That gentleman was returned, and That gentleman knew Mr Monckton safety, That gentleman still felt  alarmed; That gentleman had flattered That gentleman, from the length of time in which Mr Monckton had now  done nothing without consulting That gentleman, Mr Monckton would scarce even think of any action  without That gentleman previous concurrence. And That gentleman had hoped, by a little longer use, to  make That gentleman counsel become necessary, which That gentleman knew to be a very short step from  rendering it absolute. Nor was That gentleman well pleased to perceive, by this voluntary excursion, a struggle to  cast off Mr Monckton sadness, and a wish to procure Mr Monckton entertainment: it was not  that That gentleman desired Mr Monckton misery, but That gentleman was earnest that all relief from it should  spring from That gentleman: and though far from displeased that Delvile should lose  That gentleman sovereignty over Mr Monckton thoughts, That gentleman was yet of opinion that, till That gentleman own  liberty was restored, That gentleman had less to apprehend from grief indulged, than grief  allayed; one could but lead Mr Monckton to repining retirement, the other might guide  Mr Monckton to a consolatory rival. That gentleman well knew, however, it was as essential to That gentleman cause to disguise That gentleman  disappointments as That gentleman expectations, and, certain that by pleasing alone That gentleman had  any chance of acquiring power, That gentleman cleared up when Cecilia returned, who as  unconscious of feeling, as of owing any subjection to That gentleman, preserved  uncontrolled the right of acting for Cecilia, however desirous and glad of  occasional instruction. Cecilia told That gentleman where Cecilia had been, and related Cecilia meeting Belfield, and the  unhappiness of That gentleman friends, and hinted Cecilia wish that That gentleman could be informed what  his friends suffered. Mr Monckton, eager to oblige Cecilia, went instantly in search of  That gentleman, and returning to supper, told Cecilia That gentleman had traced That gentleman through the  Bookseller, who had not the dexterity to parry That gentleman artful enquiries, and had  actually appointed That gentleman to breakfast in Soho-Square the next morning. That gentleman had found That gentleman, That gentleman said, writing, but in high spirits and good humour. That gentleman had  resisted, for a while, That gentleman invitation on account of That gentleman dress, all That gentleman clothes  but the very coat which That gentleman had on being packed up and at That gentleman mother's: but,  when laughed at by Mr Monckton for still retaining some foppery, Mr Monckton gaily  protested what remained of some foppery should be extinguished; and acknowledging that  Mr Monckton shame was no part of Mr Monckton philosophy, declared Mr Monckton would throw some foppery wholly  aside, and, in spite of Mr Monckton degradation, renew Mr Monckton visits at his house. "I would not tell Mr Monckton,Mr Monckton Mr Monckton continued, "of the anxiety of Mr Monckton family; I  thought it would come more powerfully from yourself, who, having seen, can  better enforce it." Cecilia was very thankful for this compliance with Cecilia request, and anticipated  the pleasure Cecilia hoped soon to give Henrietta, by the restoration of a brother  so much loved and so regretted. Cecilia sent, mean time, to Mr Briggs the message Cecilia had received from Mr Delvile,  and had the satisfaction of an answer that Mr Monckton would observe the appointment.
