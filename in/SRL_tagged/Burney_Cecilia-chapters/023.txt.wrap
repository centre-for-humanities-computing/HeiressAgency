 Cecilia now for about a fortnight passed her time without incident; the Harrels  continued their accustomed dissipation, Sir Robert Floyer, without even seeking  a private conference, persevered in his attentions, and Mr Arnott, though still  silent and humble, seemed only to live by the pleasure of beholding her. She  spent two whole days with Mrs Delvile, both of which served to confirm her  admiration of that lady and of her son; and she joined the parties of the  Harrels, or stayed quietly at home, according to her spirits and inclinations:  while she was visited by Mr Monckton often enough to satisfy him with her  proceedings, yet too seldom to betray either to herself or to the world any  suspicion of his designs. Her L200 pounds however, which was to have been returned at the end if the  first week, though a fortnight was now elapsed, had not even been mentioned;  she began to grow very impatient, but not knowing what course to pursue, and  wanting courage to remind Mr Harrel of his promise, she still waited the  performance of it without speaking. At this time, preparations were making in the family for removing to  Violet-bank to spend the Easter holidays: but Cecilia, who was too much grieved  at such perpetual encrease of unnecessary expences to have any enjoyment in new  prospects of entertainment, had at present some business of her own which gave  her full employment. The poor carpenter, whose family she had taken under her protection, was just  dead, and, as soon as the last duties had been paid him, she sent for his  widow, and after trying to console her for the loss she had suffered, assured  her she was immediately ready to fulfil the engagement into which she had  entered, of assisting her to undertake some better method of procuring a  livelihood; and therefore desired to know in what manner she could serve her,  and what she thought herself able to do. The good woman, pouring forth thanks and praises innumerable, answered that she  had a Cousin, who had offered, for a certain premium, to take her into  partnership in a small haberdasher's shop. "But then, madam," continued she,  "it's quite morally impossible I should raise such a sum, or else, to be sure,  such a shop as that, now I am grown so poorly, would be quite a heaven upon  earth to me: for my strength, madam, is almost all gone away, and when I do any  hard work, it's quite a piteous sight to see me, for I am all in a tremble  after it, just as if I had an ague, and yet all the time my hands, madam, will  be burning like a coal!" "You have indeed been overworked," said Cecilia, "and it is high time your  feeble frame should have some rest. What is the sum your cousin demands?" "O madam, more than I should be able to get together in all my life! for earn  what I will, it goes as fast as it conies, because there's many mouths, and  small pay, and two of the little ones that can't help at all;—and there's no  Billy, madam, to work for us now!" "But tell me, what is the sum?" "Sixty pound, madam." "You shall have it!" cried the generous Cecilia, "if the situation will make  you happy, I will give it you myself." The poor woman wept her thanks, and was long before she could sufficiently  compose herself to answer the further questions of Cecilia, who next enquired  what could be done with the children? Mrs Hill, however, hitherto hopeless of  such a provision for herself, had for them formed no plan. She told her,  therefore, to go to her cousin, and consult upon this subject, as well as to  make preparations for her own removal. The arrangement of this business now became her favourite occupation. She went  herself to the shop, which was a very small one in Fetter-lane, and spoke with  Mrs Roberts, the cousin; who agreed to take the eldest girl, now sixteen years  of age, by way of helper; but said she had room for no other: however, upon  Cecilia's offering to raise the premium, she consented that the two little  children should also live in the house, where they might be under the care of  their mother and sister. There were still two others to be disposed of; but as no immediate method of  providing for them occurred to Cecilia, she determined, for the present, to  place them in some cheap school, where they might be taught plain work, which  could not but prove a useful qualification for whatever sort of business they  might hereafter attempt. Her plan was to bestow upon Mrs Hill and her children L100 by way of putting  them all into a decent way of living; and, then, from time to time, to make  them such small presents as their future exigencies or changes of situation  might require. Now, therefore, payment from Mr Harrel became immediately necessary, for she  had only L50 of the L600 she had taken up in her own possession, and her  customary allowance was already so appropriated that she could make from it no  considerable deduction. There is something in the sight of laborious indigence so affecting and so  respectable, that it renders dissipation peculiarly contemptible, and doubles  the odium of extravagance: every time Cecilia saw this poor family, her  aversion to the conduct and the principles of Mr Harrel encreased, while her  delicacy of shocking or shaming him diminished, and she soon acquired for them  what she had failed to acquire for herself, the spirit and resolution to claim  her debt. One morning, therefore, as he was quitting the breakfast room, she hastily  arose, and following, begged to have a moment's discourse with him. They went  together to the library, and after some apologies, and much hesitation, she  told him she fancied he had forgotten the L200 which she had lent him. "The L200," cried he; "O, ay, true!—I protest it had escaped me. Well, but  you don't want it immediately?" "Indeed I do, if you can conveniently spare it." "O yes, certainly!—without the least doubt!—Though now I think of it—it's  extremely unlucky, but really just at this time—why did not you put me in  mind of it before?" "I hoped you would have remembered it yourself." "I could have paid you two days ago extremely well—however, you shall  certainly have it very soon, that you may depend upon, and a day or two can  make no great difference to you." He then wished her good morning, and left her. Cecilia, very much provoked, regretted that she had ever lent it at all, and  determined for the future strictly to follow the advice of Mr. Monckton in  trusting him no more. Two or three days passed on, but still no notice was taken either of the  payment or of the debt. She then resolved to renew her application, and be more  serious and more urgent with him; but she found, to her utter surprise, this  was not in her power, and that though she lived under the same roof with him,  she had no opportunity to enforce her claim. Mr. Harrel, whenever she desired  to speak with him, protested he was so much hurried he had not a moment to  spare: and even when, tired of his excuses, she pursued him out of the room, he  only quickened his speed, smiling, however, and bowing, and calling out "I am  vastly sorry, but I am so late now I cannot stop an instant; however, as soon  as I come back, I shall be wholly at your command." When he came back, however, Sir Robert Floyer, or some other gentleman, was  sure to be with him, and the difficulties of obtaining an audience were sure to  be encreased. And by this method, which he constantly practised, of avoiding  any private conversation, he frustrated all her schemes of remonstrating upon  his delay, since her resentment, however great, could never urge her to the  indelicacy of dunning him in presence of a third person. She was now much perplext herself how to put into execution her plans for the  Hills: she knew it would be as vain to apply for money to Mr. Briggs, as for  payment to Mr. Harrel. Her word, however, had been given, and her word she held  sacred: she resolved, therefore, for the present, to bestow upon them the 50  pounds she still retained, and, if the rest should be necessary before she  became of age, to spare it, however inconveniently, from her private allowance,  which, by the will of her uncle, was 500 pounds a year, 250 pounds of which Mr  Harrel received for her board and accommodations. Having settled this matter in her own mind, she went to the lodging of Mrs  Hill, in order to conclude the affair. She found her and all her children,  except the youngest, hard at work, and their honest industry so much  strengthened her compassion, that her wishes for serving them grew every  instant more liberal. Mrs Hill readily undertook to make her cousin accept half the premium for the  present, which would suffice to fix her, with three of her children, in the  shop: Cecilia then went with her to Fetter-lane, and there, drawing up herself  an agreement for their entering into partnership, she made each of them sign it  and take a copy, and kept a third in her own possession: after which, she gave  a promissory note to Mrs Roberts for the rest of the money. She presented Mrs Hill, also, with 10 pounds to clothe them all decently, and  enable her to send two of the children to school; and assured her that she  would herself pay for their board and instruction, till she should be  established in her business, and have power to save money for that purpose. She then put herself into a chair to return home, followed by the prayers and  blessings of the whole family.
