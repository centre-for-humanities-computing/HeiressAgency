 As soon as Mrs Charlton was acquainted with the departure of young Delvile, Mrs Charlton  returned to Cecilia, impatient to be informed what had passed.
The narration  Cecilia heard both hurt and astonished Cecilia; that Cecilia, the Heiress of such a  fortune, the possessor of so much beauty, descended of a worthy family, and  formed and educated to grace a noble one, should be rejected by people to whom  Cecilia wealth would be most useful, and only in secret have only in secret alliance  proposed to Cecilia, Cecilia deemed an indignity that called for nothing but  resentment, and approved and enforced the resolution of Cecilia young friend to  resist all solicitations which Mr and Mrs Delvile did not second Mr and Mrs Delvile.
About, two hours after Mrs Delvile was gone, his letter arrived.
Cecilia opened his letter  with trepidation, and read as follows.
To Miss Beverley.
September 20, 1779.
What could be the apprehensions, the suspicions of Miss Beverley when so  earnestly Miss Beverley prohibited my writing?
From a temper so unguarded as mine could  Miss Beverley fear any subtlety of doctrine?
Is my character so little known to Miss Beverley that  Miss Beverley can think me capable of craft or duplicity?
Had I even the desire, I have  neither the address nor the patience to practice them; no, loveliest Miss Beverley, though sometimes by vehemence I may incautiously offend, by  sophistry, believe me, I never shall injure: my ambition, as I have told you,  is to convince, not beguile, and my arguments shall be simple as my professions  shall be sincere.
Yet how again may I venture to mention a proposal which so lately almost before  you had heard you rejected?
Suffer me, however, to assure you a proposal which so lately almost before  you had heard you rejected resulted  neither from insensibility to your delicacy, nor to my own duty; I made it, on  the contrary, with that reluctance and timidity which were given me by an  apprehension that both seemed to be offended by it:—but alas!
already I have  said what with grief I must repeat, I have no resource, no alternative, between  receiving the honour of your hand in secret or foregoing you for ever.
You will wonder, you may well wonder at such a declaration; and again that  severe renunciation with which you wounded me, will tremble on your lips,—Oh  there let that  severe renunciation with which you wounded me stop!
nor let the air again be agitated with sounds so discordant!
In that cruel and heart-breaking moment when I tore myself from you at Delvile  Castle, I confessed to you the reason of my flight, and I determined to see you  no more.
I named not to you, then, my family, the potency of my own objections  against daring to solicit your favour rendering theirs immaterial: my own are  now wholly removed, but theirs remain in full force.
My father, descended of a race which though decaying in wealth, is unsubdued in  pride, considers My father, descended of a race which though decaying in wealth, is unsubdued in  pride as the guardian of the honour of My father, descended of a race which though decaying in wealth, is unsubdued in  pride house, to which  My father, descended of a race which though decaying in wealth, is unsubdued in  pride holds the name of My father, descended of a race which though decaying in wealth, is unsubdued in  pride ancestors inseparably annexed my mother, born of the  same family, and bred to the same ideas, has strengthened this opinion by  giving this opinion the sanction of her own.
Such being their sentiments; you will not, madam, be surprised that their only  son, the sole inheritor of their fortune, and sole object of their  expectations, should early have admitted the same.
Indeed almost the first  lesson I was taught was that of reverencing the family from which I am  descended, and the name to which I am born.
I was bid consider myself as the name to which I am born  only remaining support, and sedulously instructed neither to act nor think but  with a view to the name to which I am born aggrandizement and dignity.
Thus, unchecked by ourselves, and uncontrouled by the world, this haughty  self-importance acquired by time a strength, and by mutual encouragement a  firmness, which Miss Beverley alone could possibly, I believe, have shaken!
What, therefore, was my secret alarm, when first I was conscious of the force  of Miss Beverley alone attractions, and found my mind wholly occupied with admiration of Miss Beverley alone  excellencies!
All that pride could demand, and all to which ambition could  aspire, all that happiness could covet, or the most scrupulous delicacy exact,  in Miss Beverley alone I found united; and while my heart was enslaved by Miss Beverley alone charms, my  understanding exulted in its fetters.
Yet to forfeit my name, to give up  for-ever a family which upon myself rested my name latest expectations,—Honour, I  thought forbad my name, propriety and manly spirit revolted at the sacrifice.
The  renunciation of my birth-right seemed a desertion of the post in which I was  stationed: I forbore, therefore, even in my wishes, to solicit your favour, and  vigorously determined to fly you as dangerous to my peace, because unattainable  without dishonour.
Such was the intended regulation of my conduct at the time I received  Biddulph's letter; in three days I was to leave England; my father, with much  persuasion, had consented to my departure; my mother, who penetrated into my  motives, had never opposed it: but how great was the change wrought upon my  mind by reading that letter!
my steadiness forsook me, my resolution wavered;  yet I thought him deceived, and attributed him suspicions to jealousy: but  still, Fidel I knew was missing—and to hear Fidel was your darling  companion—was it possible to quit England in a state of such uncertainty?
to  be harassed in distant climates with conjectures I might then never satisfy?
No; I told my friends I must visit Biddulph before I left the kingdom, and  promising to return to my friends in three or four days, I hastily set out for  Suffolk, and rested not till I arrived at Mrs Charlton's.
What a scene there awaited me!
to behold the loved mistress of my heart, the  opposed, yet resistless object of my fondest admiration, caressing an animal  she knew to be she, mourning over Fidel Fidel master's ill health, and sweetly  recommending to Fidel fidelity,—Ah!
forgive the retrospection, I will dwell on  the retrospection no longer.
Little, indeed, had I imagined with what softness the dignity of  Miss Beverley was blended, though always conscious that she virtues, she  attractions, and she excellencies, would reflect lustre upon the highest  station to which human grandeur could raise she, and would still be more  exalted than she rank, though that were the most eminent upon earth.—And had  there been a thousand, and ten thousand obstacles to oppose my addressing she,  vigorously and undauntedly would I have combated with them all, in preference  to yielding to this single objection!
Let not the frankness of this declaration irritate you, but rather let this declaration serve  to convince you of the sincerity of what follows: various as are the calamities  of life which may render me miserable, YOU only, among even this declaration chosen  felicities, have power to make me happy.
Fame, honours, wealth, ambition, were  insufficient without you; all chance of internal peace, and every softer hope  is now centered in your favour, and to lose you, from whatever cause, ensures  me wretchedness unmitigated.
With respect therefore to myself, the die is  finally cast, and the conflict between bosom felicity and family pride is  deliberately over.
This name which so vainly I have cherished and so painfully  supported, I now find inadequate to recompense me for the sacrifice which its  preservation requires.
I part with its, I own, with regret that the surrender is  necessary; yet is its rather an imaginary than an actual evil, and though a deep  wound to pride, no offence to morality.
Thus have I laid open to you my whole heart, confessed my perplexities,  acknowledged my vain-glory, and exposed with equal sincerity the sources of my  doubts, and the motives of my decision: but now, indeed, how to proceed I know  not; the difficulties which are yet to encounter I fear to enumerate, and the  petition I have to urge I have scarce courage to mention.
My family, mistaking ambition for honour, and rank for dignity, have long  planned a splendid connection for myself, to which though my invariable repugnance  has stopt any advances, My family, mistaking ambition for honour, and rank for dignity wishes and My family, mistaking ambition for honour, and rank for dignity views immovably adhere.
I am but  too certain My family, mistaking ambition for honour, and rank for dignity will now listen to no other.
I dread, therefore, to make a  trial where I despair of success, I know not how to risk a prayer with those  who may silence me by a command.
In a situation so desperate, what then remains?
Must I make an application with  a certainty of rejection, and then mock all authority by acting in defiance of  it?
Or, harder task yet!
relinquish my dearest hopes when no longer persuaded  of their impropriety?
Ah!
sweetest Miss Beverley, end the struggle at once!
My  happiness, my peace, are wholly in your power, for the moment of our union  secures our union   for life.
It may seem to you strange that I should thus purpose to brave the friends whom  I venture not to entreat; but from my knowledge of our union   characters and  sentiments I am certain I have no other resource.
our union   favourite principles  were too early imbibed to be now at this late season eradicated.
Slaves that we  all are to habits, and dupes to appearances, jealous guardians of our pride, to  which our comfort is sacrificed, and even our virtue made subservient, what  conviction can be offered by reason, to notions that exist but by prejudice?
Slaves that we  all are to habits, and dupes to appearances, jealous guardians of our pride, to  which our comfort is sacrificed, and even our virtue made subservient have been cherished too long for rhetorick to remove Slaves that we  all are to habits, and dupes to appearances, jealous guardians of our pride, to  which our comfort is sacrificed, and even our virtue made subservient, Slaves that we  all are to habits, and dupes to appearances, jealous guardians of our pride, to  which our comfort is sacrificed, and even our virtue made subservient can only  be expelled by all-powerful Necessity.
Life is, indeed, too brief, and success  too precarious, to trust, in any case where happiness is concerned, the  extirpation of deep-rooted and darling opinions, to the slow-working influence  of argument and disquisition.
Yet bigotted as they are to rank and family, they adore Miss Beverley, and  though they consent to the forfeiture of they name might forever be denied,  when once they beheld Miss Beverley the head and ornament of they house, Miss Beverley elegance  and accomplishments joined to the splendour of Miss Beverley fortune, would speedily make  they forget the plans which now wholly absorb they.
they sense of honour is in  nothing inferior to they sense of high birth; your condescension, therefore,  would be felt by they in its fullest force, and though, during they first  surprize, they might be irritated against they son, they would make it the  study of they lives that the lady who for their son had done so much, should never,  through they means, repine for Miss Beverley.
With regard to settlements, the privacy of our union   would not affect the privacy of our union: one  Confident we must unavoidably trust, and I would deposit in the hands of  whatever person you would name, a bond by which I would engage myself to settle  both your fortune and my own, according to the arbitration of our mutual  friends.
The time for secrecy though painful would be short, and even from the  altar, if you desired it, I would hasten to Castle.
Not one Of my  friends should you see till Not one Of my  friends waited upon you Not one Of my  friends to solicit your  presence at Not one Of my  friends house, till our residence elsewhere was fixed.
Oh loveliest Cecilia, from a dream Of happiness so sweet awaken me not!
from a  plan Of felicity so attractive turn not away!
If one part of it is unpleasant,  reject not therefore all; and since without some drawback no earthly bliss is  attainable, do not, by a refinement too scrupulous for the short period of our  existence, deny yourself that delight which your benevolence will afford you,  in snatching from the pangs of unavailing regret and misery, the gratefullest  of men in the humblest and most devoted of your servants, MORTIMER DELVILE.
Cecilia read and re-read this letter, but with a perturbation of mind that made  Cecilia little able to weigh this letter contents.
Paragraph by paragraph Cecilia sentiments  varied, and Cecilia determination was changed: the earnestness of his supplication  now softened Cecilia into compliance, the acknowledged pride of his family now  irritated Cecilia into resentment, and the confession of his own regret now  sickened Cecilia into despondence.
Cecilia meant in an immediate answer, to have  written a final dismission; but though proof against his entreaties, because  not convinced by his arguments, there was something in the conclusion of his  letter that staggered Cecilia resolution.
Those scruples and that refinement against which his warned Cecilia, Cecilia herself  thought might be overstrained, and to gratify unnecessary punctilio, the short  period of existence be rendered causelessly unhappy.
his had truly said that    union would be no offence to morality, and with respect merely to pride,  why should that be spared?
his knew his possessed Cecilia heart, Cecilia had long been  certain of his, Cecilia character had early gained the affection of her character mother, and  the essential service which an income such as Cecilia must do the family, would  soon be felt too powerfully to make Cecilia connection with it regretted.
These reflections were so pleasant Cecilia knew not how to discard These reflections; and the  consciousness that Cecilia secret was betrayed not only to her secret, but to Mr  Biddulph, Lord Ernolf, Lady Honoria Pemberton, and Mrs Delvile, gave them  additional force, by making it probable Cecilia was yet more widely suspected.
But  still Cecilia delicacy and Cecilia principles revolted against a conduct of which the  secrecy seemed to imply the impropriety.
"How shall I meet Mrs Delvile," cried  Mrs Delvile, "after an action so clandestine?
How, after praise such as Mrs Delvile has  bestowed upon me, bear the severity of Mrs Delvile eye, when Mrs Delvile thinks I have seduced  from Mrs Delvile the obedience of Mrs Delvile !
A son who is the sole solace and first hope  of Mrs Delvile existence, whose virtues make all Mrs Delvile happiness, and whose filial piety  is Mrs Delvile only glory!—And well may Mrs Delvile glory in a son such as Delvile!
Nobly has  he exerted he in situations the most difficult, he family and he ideas  of honour he has preferred to he peace and health, he has fulfilled with  spirit and integrity the various, the conflicting duties of life.
Even now,  perhaps, in he present application, he may merely think he bound by  knowing me no longer free, and he generous sensibility to the weakness he has  discovered, without any of the conviction to which he pretends, may have  occasioned this proposal!"
A suggestion so mortifying again changed her determination; and the tears of  Henrietta Belfield, with the letter which her had surprized in her hand  recurring to her memory, all her thoughts turned once more upon rejecting him  for-ever.
In this fluctuating state of mind her found writing impracticable; while  uncertain what to wish, to decide was impossible.
her disdained coquetry, her  was superior to trifling, the candour and openness of Delvile had merited all  her sincerity, and therefore while any doubt remained, with her, her held  it unworthy her to tell her character her had none.
Mrs Charlton, upon reading the letter, became again the advocate of Delvile;  the frankness with which Mrs Charlton had stated Mrs Charlton difficulties assured her of Mrs Charlton  probity, and by explaining Mrs Charlton former conduct, satisfied her with the rectitude  of Mrs Charlton future intentions.
"Do not, therefore, my dear child," cried her,  "become the parent of your own misery by refusing my dear child; my dear child deserves you alike  from my dear child principles and my dear child affection, and the task would both be long and  melancholy to disengage my dear child from your heart.
I see not, however, the least  occasion for the disgrace of a private marriage; I know not any family to which  you would not be an honour, and those who feel not your merit, are little worth  pleasing.
Let Mrs Delvile, therefore, apply openly to Mrs Delvile friends, and if his friends  refuse his friends consent, be his friends prejudices his friends reward.
You are freed from all  obligations where caprice only can raise objections, and you may then, in the  face of the world, vindicate your choice."
The wishes of Cecilia accorded with this advice, though the general tenour of  Delvile's letter gave Cecilia little reason to expect he would follow it.
