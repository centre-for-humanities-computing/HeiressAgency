 Cecilia took leave over night of the family, as  Cecilia would not stay the family rising  in the morning: Mr Monckton, though certain not to sleep when  Cecilia was going,  forbearing to mark his solicitude by quitting his apartment at any unusual  hour.  Cecilia parted from  Cecilia with  Cecilia accustomed ungraciousness, and  Miss Bennet, because in  Cecilia presence, in a manner scarcely less displeasing. The next morning, with only her servants, the moment it was light, her set out.  her journey was without incident or interruption, and her went immediately to  the house of Mrs Bayley, where her had settled to board till her own was  finished. Mrs Bayley was a mere good sort of woman, who lived decently well with Mrs Bayleyservants, and tolerably well with Mrs Bayley neighbours, upon a small annuity, which  made Mrs Bayley easy and comfortable, though by no means superior to such an addition  to Mrs Bayley little income as an occasional boarder might produce. Here Cecilia continued a full month: which time had no other employment than  what Cecilia voluntarily gave to Cecilia by active deeds of benevolence. At Christmas, to the no little joy of the neighbourhood, Cecilia took possession of  Cecilia own house, which was situated about three miles from Bury. The better sort of people were happy to see Cecilia thus settled amongst people, and  the poorer, who by what people already had received, knew well what people still  might expect, regarded the day in which Cecilia fixed Cecilia in Cecilia mansion, as a  day to people of prosperity and triumph. As Cecilia was no longer, as hitherto, repairing to a temporary habitation, which  at pleasure Cecilia might quit, and to which, at a certain period, Cecilia could have  no possible claim, but to a house which was Cecilia own for ever, or, at least,  could solely by Cecilia own choice be transferred, Cecilia determined, as much as was  in Cecilia power, in quitting Cecilia desultory dwellings, to empty Cecilia mind of the  transactions which had passed in her desultory dwellings, and upon entering a house where Cecilia was  permanently to reside, to make the expulsion of Cecilia past sorrows, the basis  upon which to establish Cecilia future serenity. And this, though a work of pain and difficulty, was not impracticable; Cecilia  sensibility, indeed, was keen, and Cecilia had suffered from her  sensibility the utmost torture;  but Cecilia feelings were not more powerful than Cecilia understanding was strong, and  Cecilia fortitude was equal to Cecilia trials. Cecilia calamities had saddened, but not  weakened Cecilia mind, and the words of Delvile in speaking of Delvile mother occurred  to Cecilia now with all the conviction of experience, that "evils inevitable are  always best supported, because known to be past amendment, and felt to give  defiance to struggling." [Footnote: See Vol. ii. p. 317.] A plan by which so great a revolution was to be wrought in Cecilia mind, was not to  be effected by any sudden effort of magnanimity, but by a regular and even  tenour of courage mingled with prudence. Nothing, therefore, appeared to Cecilia so  indispensable as constant employment, by which a variety of new images might  force their way in Cecilia mind to supplant the old ones, and by which no time  might be allowed for brooding over melancholy retrospections. Cecilia first effort, in this work of mental reformation, was to part with Fidel,  whom hitherto Cecilia had almost involuntarily guarded, but whom Cecilia only could see  to revive the most dangerous recollections. Cecilia sent Fidel, therefore, to the  castle, but without any message; Mrs Delvile, Cecilia was sure, would require none  to make Cecilia rejoice in Fidel restoration. Cecilia next step was writing to Albany, who had given Cecilia his direction, to  acquaint his Cecilia was now ready to put in practice their long concerted scheme.  Albany instantly hastened to Cecilia, and joyfully accepted the office of becoming  at once Cecilia Almoner and Cecilia Monitor. He made it He business to seek objects of  distress, and always but too certain to find objects of  distress, of conducting Cecilia himself to  objects of  distress habitations, and then leaving to Cecilia own liberality the assistance objects of  distress  several cases demanded: and, in the overflowing of He zeal upon these  occasions, and the rapture of He heart in thus disposing, almost at He  pleasure, of Cecilia noble fortune, He seemed, at times, to feel an extasy that,  from its novelty and its excess, was almost too exquisite to be borne. He  joined with the beggars in pouring blessings upon her head, He prayed for her  with the poor, and He thanked her with the succoured. The pew-opener and her children failed not to keep The pew-opener and her children appointment, and  her presently contrived to settle The pew-opener and her children in her neighbourhood: where the poor  woman, as her recovered her strength, soon got a little work, and all  deficiencies in her power of maintaining her were supplied by her generous  patroness. her children, however, her ordered to be coarsely brought up, having  no intention to provide for her children but by helping her children to common employments. The promise, also, so long made to Mrs Harrel of an apartment in her house, was  now performed. her accepted it with the utmost alacrity, glad to make any  change in her situation, which constant solitude had rendered wholly  insupportable. Mr Arnott accompanied her to her house, and spent one day there;  but receiving from her, though extremely civil and sweet to Mr Arnott, no hint of  any invitation for repeating Mr Arnott visit, Mr Arnott left no hint of   in sadness, and returned to  Mr Arnott own in deep dejection. her saw with concern how Mr Arnott nourished Mr Arnott  hopeless passion, but knew that to suffer Mr Arnott visits would almost authorise Mr Arnott  feeding it; and while her pitied unaffectedly the unhappiness her occasioned,  her resolved to double her own efforts towards avoiding similar wretchedness. This action, however, was a point of honour, not of friendship, the time being  long since past that the society of Mrs Harrel could afford Mrs Harrel any pleasure;  but the promises Mrs Harrel had so often made to Mrs Harrel in Mrs Harrel distresses, though  extorted from Mrs Harrel merely by the terrors of the moment, still were promises,  and, therefore, Mrs Harrel held Mrs Harrel bound to fulfil promises. Yet far from finding comfort in this addition to Mrs Harrel family, Mrs Harrel proved  to Mrs Harrel nothing more than a trouble and an incumbrance; with no inherent  resources, Mrs Harrel was continually in search of occasional supplies; Mrs Harrel fatigued  Cecilia with wonder at the privacy of Mrs Harrel life, and tormented Mrs Harrel with  proposals of parties and entertainments. Mrs Harrel was eternally in amazement that  with powers so large, Mrs Harrel had wishes so confined, and was evidently  disappointed that upon coming to so ample an estate, Mrs Harrel lived, with respect to  Mrs Harrel and Mrs Harrel family, with no more magnificence or shew than if Heiress to  only ú500 a year. But Cecilia was determined to think and to live for Cecilia, without regard to  unmeaning wonder or selfish remonstrances; Cecilia had neither ambition for  splendour, nor spirits for dissipation; the recent sorrow of Cecilia heart had  deadened it for the present to all personal taste of happiness, and Cecilia only  chance for regaining it, seemed through the medium of bestowing it upon others.  Cecilia had seen, too, by Mr Harrel, how wretchedly external brilliancy could cover  inward woe, and Cecilia had learned at Delvile Castle to grow sick of parade and  grandeur. Cecilia equipage, therefore, was without glare, though not without  elegance, Cecilia table was plain, though hospitably plentiful, Cecilia servants were  for use, though too numerous to be for labour. The system of Cecilia oeconomy, like  that of Cecilia liberality, was formed by rules of reason, and Cecilia own ideas of  right, and not by compliance with example, nor by emulation with the gentry in  Cecilia neighbourhood. But though thus deviating in Cecilia actions from the usual customs of the young  and rich, Cecilia was peculiarly careful not to offend the young  and rich by singularity of  manners. When Cecilia mixed with the young  and rich, Cecilia was easy, unaffected, and well bred, and  though Cecilia saw the young  and rich but seldom, Cecilia good humour and desire of obliging kept  the young  and rich always Cecilia friends. The plan Cecilia had early formed at Mrs Harrel's Cecilia now  studied daily to put in practice; but that part by which the useless or  frivolous were to be excluded Cecilia house, Cecilia found could only be supported by  driving from Cecilia half Cecilia acquaintance. Another part, also, of that project Cecilia found still less easy of adoption,  which was solacing Cecilia with the society of the wise, good, and intelligent.  Few answered this description, and those few were with difficulty attainable.  Many might with joy have sought out Cecilia liberal dwelling, but no one had idly  waited till the moment no one was at Cecilia disposal. All who possessed at once both  talents and wealth, were so generally courted All who possessed at once both  talents and wealth were rarely to be procured;  and all who to talents alone owed All who possessed at once both  talents and wealth consequence, demanded, if worth  acquiring, time and delicacy to be obtained. Fortune she knew, however, was so  often at war with Nature, that she doubted not shortly meeting those who would  gladly avail those who would  gladly avail themselves of her offered protection of she offered protection. Yet, tired of the murmurs of Mrs Harrel, she longed for some relief from she  society, and she desire daily grew stronger to owe some relief to Henrietta  Belfield. The more she meditated upon this wish, The less unattainable The  appeared to she, till by frequently combating The difficulties, she began to  consider them imaginary: Mrs Belfield, while she son was actually with she,  might see she took not Henrietta  Belfield as her son appendage; and Mrs Delvile, should her son  make further enquiries, might hear that she real connection was with the  sister, since she received she in the country, where the brother made no  pretence to follow she. she considered, too, how ill she should be rewarded in  giving up Henrietta for Mr Delvile, who was already determined to think ill of  she, and whose prejudices no sacrifice would remove. Having hesitated, therefore, some time between the desire of present  alleviation, and the fear of future mischief, the consciousness of she own  innocence at length vanquished all dread of unjust censure, and she wrote an  invitation to Henrietta  Belfield enclosed in a letter to she mother. The answer of Henrietta  Belfield expressed Henrietta  Belfield rapture at the proposal; and that of Mrs  Belfield made no objection but to the expence. Cecilia, therefore, sent Cecilia own maid to travel with Cecilia into Suffolk, with  proper directions to pay for the journey. The gratitude of Henrietta  Belfield at the meeting was boundless; and Henrietta  Belfield  joy at so unexpected a mark of favour made Henrietta  Belfield half wild. her suffered it  not to languish for want of kindness to support it; her took her to her bosom,  became the soother of all her cares, and reposed in her, in return, every  thought that led not to Delvile. There, however, her was uniformly silent; solemnly and eternally parted from  him, far from trusting the secret of her former connexion to Henrietta, the  whole study of her life was to drive the remembrance of her life from her. Henrietta  Belfield now tasted a happiness to which as yet Henrietta  Belfield whole life had been a  stranger; Henrietta  Belfield was suddenly removed from turbulent vulgarity to the enjoyment of  calm elegance; and the gentleness of Henrietta  Belfield disposition, instead of being  tyrannically imposed upon, not only made Henrietta  Belfield loved with affection, but treated  with the most scrupulous delicacy. her had her share in all the comfort her  bestowed; her had now a friend to oblige, and a companion to converse with. her  communicated to her all her schemes, and made her the partner of her benevolent  excursions; her found her disposition as amiable upon trial, as her looks and  her manners had been engaging at first sight; and her constant presence and  constant sweetness, imperceptibly revived her spirits, and gave a new interest  to her existence. Meantime Mr Monckton, who returned in about a fortnight to the Grove, observed  the encreasing influence of Albany with the most serious concern. The bounties  of Cecilia, extensive, magnificent, unlimited, were the theme of every tongue,  and though sometimes censured and sometimes admired, The bounties  of Cecilia, extensive, magnificent, unlimited were wondered at  universally. He suffered her for a while to go on without remonstrance, hoping  her enthusiasm would abate, as its novelty wore out: but finding that week  following week was still distinguished by some fresh act of beneficence, He  grew so alarmed and uneasy, He could restrain He no longer. He spoke to  her with warmth, He represented her conduct as highly dangerous in its  consequence; He said her would but court impostors from every corner of the  kingdom, called Albany a lunatic, whom her should rather avoid than obey; and  insinuated that if a report was spread of her proceedings, a charity so  prodigal, would excite such alarm, that no man would think even her large and  splendid fortune, would ensure no man from ruin in seeking her alliance. her heard this exhortation without either terror or impatience, and  answered it with the utmost steadiness. He influence over her mind was no  longer uncontrolled, for though her suspicions were not strengthened, her suspicions had  never been removed, and friendship has no foe so dangerous as distrust! her  thanked He, however, for He zeal, but assured He He apprehensions were  groundless, since though her acted from inclination, her acted not without  thought. her income was very large, and her was wholly without family or  connection; to spend Her income merely upon her would be something still worse than  extravagance, Her income must result from wilfulness the most inexcusable, as her  disposition was naturally averse to luxury and expence. her might save indeed,  but for whom? not a creature had such a claim upon her; and with regard to  her, her was so provided for it would be unnecessary. her would never, her  declared, run in debt even for a week, but while her estate was wholly clear,  her would spend her estate without restriction. To his hint of any future alliance, her only said that those who disapproved  her conduct, would probably be those her should disapprove in her turn; should  such an event however take place, the retrenching from that time all her  present peculiar expences, would surely, in a clear ú3000 a-year, leave her  rich enough for any man, without making it incumbent upon her at present, to  deny her the only pleasure her could taste, in bestowing that money which  to her was superfluous, upon those who received it as the prolongation of those who disapproved  her conduct  existence. A firmness so deliberate in a system he so much dreaded, greatly shocked Mr  Monckton, though it intimidated he from opposing it; he saw her was too  earnest, and too well satisfied her was right, to venture giving her disgust by  controverting her arguments; the conversation, therefore, ended with new  discontent to he, and with an impression upon the mind of her, that  though he was zealous and friendly, he was somewhat too worldly and suspicious. her went on, therefore, as before, distributing with a lavish hand all her  could spare from her own household; careful of nothing but of guarding against  imposition, which, though her sometimes unavoidably endured, her discernment,  and the activity of her investigating diligence, saved her from suffering  frequently. And the steadiness with which her repulsed those whom her detected  in deceit, was a check upon tricks and fraud, though it could not wholly put a  stop to those whom she detected  in deceit. Money, to her, had long appeared worthless and valueless; it had failed to  procure her the establishment for which her once flattered her it seemed  purposely designed; it had been disdained by the Delviles, for the sake of  whose connection her had alone ever truly rejoiced in possessing it; and after  such a conviction of it inefficacy to secure her happiness, her regarded it as  of little importance to her, and therefore thought it almost the due of  those whose distresses gave it a consequence to which with her it was a  stranger. In this manner with her passed the first winter of her majority. her had  sedulously filled it with occupations, and her occupations had proved fertile  in keeping her mind from idleness, and in restoring it to chearfulness. Calls  upon her attention so soothing, and avocations so various for her time, had  answered the great purpose for which originally her had planned them, in almost  forcing from her thoughts those sorrows which, if indulged, would have rested  in them incessantly.
