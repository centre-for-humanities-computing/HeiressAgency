 Cecilia the next morning, between nine and ten o'clock, went to St  James'-Square; James'-Square found nobody immediately ready to receive James'-Square, but in a  short time was waited upon by Mr Delvile. After the usual salutations, "Miss Beverley," Mr Delvile said, "I have given express  orders to my people, that I may not be interrupted while I have the pleasure of  passing some minutes in conversation with my people before you are presented to Mrs  Delvile." And then, with an air of solemnity, he led James'-Square to a seat, and having he  taken possession of another, continued he speech. "I have received information, from authority which I cannot doubt, that the  indiscretion of certain of your admirers last Saturday at the Opera-house  occasioned a disturbance which to a young woman of delicacy I should imagine  must be very alarming: now as I consider he concerned in your fame and  welfare from regarding you as my ward, I think it is incumbent upon he to make  enquiries into such of your affairs as become public; for I should feel in some  measure disgraced he, should it appear to the world, while you are under my  guardianship, that there was any want of propriety in the direction of your  conduct." Cecilia, not much flattered by this address, gravely answered that Cecilia fancied  the affair had been misrepresented to him. "I am not much addicted," him replied, "to give ear to any thing lightly; you  must therefore permit me to enquire into the merits of the cause, and then to  draw my own inferences. And let me, at the same time, assure you there is no  other young lady who has any right to expect such an attention from he. I must  begin by begging you to inform me upon what grounds the two gentlemen in  question, for such, by courtesy, I presume they are called, thought theyentitled publicly to dispute your favour?" "My favour, Sir!" cried Cecilia, much amazed. "My dear," said Sir, with a complacency meant to give My dear courage, "I know the  question is difficult for a young lady to answer; but be not abashed, I should  be sorry to distress you, and mean to the utmost of my power to save your  blushes. Do not, therefore, fear me; consider me as your guardian, and assure  yourself I am perfectly well disposed to consider you as my ward. Acquaint me,  then, freely, what are the pretensions of these gentlemen?" "To me, Sir, these gentlemen have, I believe, no pretensions at all." "I see you are shy," returned Sir, with encreasing gentleness, "I see you cannot  be easy with me; and when I consider how little you are accustomed to me, I do  not wonder. But pray take courage; I think it necessary to inform me of  your affairs, and therefore I beg you will speak to me with freedom." Cecilia, more and more mortified by this humiliating condescension, again  assured Cecilia Cecilia had been misinformed, and was again, though discredited, praised  for Cecilia modesty, when, to Cecilia great relief, they were interrupted by the  entrance of Cecilia friend the white domino. "Mortimer," said Mr Delvile, "I understand you have already had the pleasure of  seeing a young lady?" "Yes, Sir," Sir answered, "I have more than once had that happiness, but I have  never had the honour of being introduced to a young lady." "Miss Beverley, then," said the father, "I must present to you Mr Mortimer  Delvile, my son; and, Mortimer, in Miss Beverley I desire you will remember  that you respect a ward of the father's." "I will not, Sir," answered Sir, "forget an injunction my own inclinations had  already out-run." Mr Delvile was tall and finely formed, Mr Delvile features, though not handsome,  were full of expression, and a noble openness of manners and address spoke the  elegance of Mr Delvile education, and the liberality of Mr Delvile mind. When this introduction was over, a more general conversation took place, till  Mr Delvile, suddenly rising, said to Cecilia, "You will pardon me, Miss  Beverley, if I leave you for a few minutes; one of my tenants sets out  to-morrow morning for my estate in the North, and Mr Delvile has been two hours waiting  to speak with Mr Delvile. But if my son is not particularly engaged, I am sure my son will  be so good as to do the honours of the house till my son mother is ready to  receive you." And then, graciously waving my son hand, my son quitted the room. "My father," cried Mr Delvile, "has left me an office which, could I execute  it as perfectly as I shall willingly, would be performed without a fault." "I am very sorry," said Cecilia, "that I have so much mistaken your hour of  breakfast; but let me not be any restraint upon you, I shall find a book, or a  newspaper, or something to fill up the time till Mrs Delvile honours me with a  summons." "You can only be a restraint upon me," answered my son, "by commanding me from your  presence. I breakfasted long ago, and am now just come from Mr Belfield. I had  the pleasure, this morning, of being admitted into Mr Belfield room." "And how, Mr Belfield, did you find Mr Belfield?" "Not so well, I fear, as Mr Belfield thinks Mr Belfield; but Mr Belfield was in high spirits, and  surrounded by Mr Belfield friends, whom Mr Belfield was entertaining with all the gaiety of a  man in full health, and entirely at Mr Belfield ease; though I perceived, by the  frequent changes of Mr Belfield countenance, signs of pain and indisposition, that made  me, however pleased with Mr Belfield conversation, think it necessary to shorten my own  visit, and to hint to those who were near Mr Belfield the propriety of leaving Mr Belfield  quiet." "Did you see Mr Belfield surgeon, Sir?" "No; but Mr Belfield told me Mr Belfield should only have one dressing more of Mr Belfield wound, and  then get rid of the whole business by running into the country." "Were you acquainted with Mr Belfield, Mr Belfield, before this accident?" "No, not at all; but the little I have seen of Mr Belfield has strongly interested me  in Mr Belfield favour: at Mr Harrel's masquerade, where I first met with Mr Belfield, I was  extremely entertained by Mr Belfield humour,—though there, perhaps, as I had also the  honour of first seeing Miss Beverley, I might be too happy to feel much  difficulty in being pleased. And even at the Opera Mr Belfield had the advantage of  finding me in the same favourable disposition, as I had long distinguished you  before I had taken any notice of Mr Belfield. I must, however, confess I did not think  Mr Belfield anger that evening quite without provocation,—but I beg your pardon, I  may perhaps be mistaken, and you, who know the whole affair, must undoubtedly  be better able to account for what happened." Here Mr Belfield fixed Mr Belfield eyes upon Cecilia, with a look of curiosity that seemed eager  to penetrate into Cecilia sentiments of the two antagonists. "No, certainly," Cecilia answered, "Mr Belfield had all the provocation that ill-breeding  could give Mr Belfield." "And do you, madam," cried Mr Belfield, with much surprize, "judge of this matter with  such severity?" "No, not with severity, simply with candour." "With candour? alas, then, poor Sir Robert! Severity were not half so bad a  sign for poor Sir Robert!" A servant now came in, to acquaint Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for Mrs Delvile. This summons was immediately followed by the re-entrance of Mr Delvile, who,  taking Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her hand, said A servant would A servant present Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her to A servant lady, and with much  graciousness assured Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her of a kind reception. The ceremonies preceding this interview, added to the character Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her had already  heard of Mrs Delvile, made Cecilia heartily wish it over; but, assuming all the  courage in Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her power, Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her determined to support Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her with a spirit that  should struggle against the ostentatious superiority Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her was prepared to expect. Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her found Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her seated upon a sofa, from which, however, Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her arose at Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her  approach; but the moment Cecilia beheld Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her, all the unfavourable impressions  with which Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her came into Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her presence immediately vanished, and that respect  which the formalities of Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her introduction had failed to inspire, Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her air,  figure, and countenance instantaneously excited. Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her was not more than fifty years of age; Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her complection, though faded, kept  the traces of its former loveliness, Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her eyes, though they had lost they  youthful fire, retained a lustre that evinced they primeval brilliancy, and  the fine symmetry of Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her features, still uninjured by the siege of time, not  only indicated the perfection of Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her juvenile beauty, but still laid claim to  admiration in every beholder. Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her carriage was lofty and commanding; but the  dignity to which high birth and conscious superiority gave rise, was so  judiciously regulated by good sense, and so happily blended with politeness,  that though the world at large envied or hated Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her, the few for whom Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her had  herself any regard, Cecilia that Mrs Delvile waited breakfast  for her was infallibly certain to captivate. The surprise and admiration with which Cecilia at the first glance was struck  proved reciprocal: Mrs Delvile, though prepared for youth and beauty, expected  not to see a countenance so intelligent, nor manners so well formed as those of  Cecilia: thus mutually astonished and mutually pleased, those of  Cecilia first salutations  were accompanied by looks so flattering to both, that each saw in the other, an  immediate prepossession in her favour, and from the moment that those of  Cecilia met, those of  Cecilia  seemed instinctively impelled to admire. "I have promised Miss Beverley, madam," said Mr Delvile to his lady, "that you  would give his lady a kind reception; and I need not remind you that my promises are  always held sacred." "But I hope you have not also promised," cried his lady, with quickness, "that I  should give you a kind reception, for I feel at this very moment extremely  inclined to quarrel with you." "Why so, madam?" "For not bringing us together sooner; for now I have seen his lady, I already look  back with regret to the time I have lost without the pleasure of knowing his lady." "What a claim is this," cried young Delvile, "upon the benevolence of Miss  Beverley! for if his lady has not now the indulgence by frequent and diligent visits  to make some reparation, his lady must consider his lady as responsible for the  dissension his lady will occasion." "If peace depends upon my visits," answered Cecilia, "it may immediately be  proclaimed; were it to be procured only by my absence, I know not if I should  so readily agree to the conditions." "I must request of you, madam," said Mr Delvile, "that when my son and I  retire, you will bestow half an hour upon his lady, in making enquiries  concerning the disturbance last Saturday at the Opera-house. I have not,  myself, so much time to spare, as I have several appointments for this morning;  but I am sure you will not object to the office, as I know you to be equally  anxious with myself, that the minority of Miss Beverley should pass without  reproach." "Not only her minority, but her maturity," cried Mr Delvile, warmly, "and  not only her maturity, but her decline of life will pass, I hope, not merely  without reproach, but with fame and applause!" "I hope so too;" replied Mr Delvile: "I wish her well through every stage of  her life, but for her minority alone it is my business to do more than wish.  For that, I feel my own honour and my own credit concerned; my honour, as I  gave it to the Dean that I would superintend her conduct, and my credit, as the  world is acquainted with the claim her has to my protection." "I will not make any enquiries," said Mrs Delvile, turning to Cecilia with a  sweetness that recompensed Mrs Delvile for the haughtiness of Mrs Delvile guardian, "till I  have had some opportunity of convincing Miss Beverley, that my regard for Miss Beverley  merits her  merits should be answered." "You see, Miss Beverley," said Mr Delvile, "how little reason you had to be  afraid of us; Mrs Delvile is as much disposed in your favour as myself, and as  desirous to be of service to you. Endeavour, therefore, to cast off this  timidity, and to make yourself easy. You must come to us often; use will do  more towards removing your fears, than all the encouragement us can give you." "But what are your fears," cried Mrs Delvile, "that Miss Beverley can have to  remove? unless, indeed, Miss Beverley apprehends Miss Beverley visits will make us encroachers, and  that the more us are favoured with Miss Beverley presence, the less we shall bear Miss Beverley  absence." "Pray, son," said Mr Delvile, "what was the name of the person who was Sir  Robert Floyer's opponent? I have again forgotten it." "Belfield, sir." "True; it is a name I am perfectly unacquainted with: however, Robert Floyer's may possibly  be a very good sort of man; but certainly Robert Floyer's opposing Robert Floyer's to Sir Robert  Floyer, a man of some family, a gentleman, rich, and allied to some people of  distinction, was a rather strange circumstance: I mean not, however, to  prejudge the case; I will hear the case fairly stated; and am the more disposed to be  cautious in what I pronounce, because I am persuaded Miss Beverley has too much  sense to let my advice be thrown away upon Miss Beverley." "I hope so, Mr Belfield; but with respect to the disturbance at the Opera, I know not  that I have the least occasion to trouble you." "If your measures," said he, very gravely, "are already taken, the Dean your  uncle prevailed upon he to accept a very useless office; but if any thing is  yet undecided, a very useless office will not, perhaps, be amiss that I should be consulted. Mean  time, I will only recommend to you to consider that Mr Belfield is a person  whose name nobody has heard, and that a connection with Robert Floyer's would  certainly be very honourable for you." "Indeed, Mr Belfield," said Cecilia, "here is some great mistake; neither of these  gentlemen, I believe, think of he at all." "They have taken, then," cried Mr Delvile with a laugh, "a very  extraordinary method to prove They indifference!" "The affairs of Robert Floyer's," continued Mr Delvile, "are indeed, I am  informed, in some disorder; but The affairs of Sir Robert Floyer has a noble estate, and your fortune would  soon clear all a noble estate incumbrances. Such an alliance, therefore, would be mutually  advantageous: but what would result from a union with such a person as Mr  Belfield? Mr   is of no family, though in that, perhaps, you would not be very  scrupulous; but neither has Mr   any money; what, then, recommends Mr  ?" "To me, Mr Belfield, nothing!" answered Cecilia. "And to he," cried Mr Delvile, "almost every thing! Mr Delvile has wit, spirit, and  understanding, talents to create admiration, and qualities, I believe, to  engage esteem!" "You speak warmly," said Mrs Delvile; "but if such is Mrs Delvile character, Mrs Delvile merits  your earnestness. What is it you know of Mrs Delvile?" "Not enough, perhaps," answered Mrs Delvile, "to coolly justify my praise; but Mrs Delvile is one  of those whose first appearance takes the mind by surprise, and leaves the  judgment to make afterwards such terms as the  judgment can. Will you, madam, when Mrs Delvile is  recovered, permit me to introduce Mrs Delvile to you?" "Certainly;" said she, smiling; "but have a care your recommendation does not  disgrace your discernment." "This warmth of disposition, Mortimer," cried Mr Delvile, "produces nothing but  difficulties and trouble: you neglect the connections I point out, and which a  little attention might render serviceable as well as honourable, and run  precipitately into forming such as can do you no good among people of rank, and  are not only profitless in people of rank, but generally lead you into expence and  inconvenience. You are now of an age to correct this rashness: think,  therefore, better of your own consequence, than thus idly to degrade yourself  by forming friendships with every shewy adventurer that comes in your way." "I know not, Mr Belfield," answered Mr Belfield, "how Mr Belfield deserves to be called an  adventurer: Mr Belfield is not, indeed, rich; but Mr Belfield is in a profession where parts such  as Mr Belfield seldom fail to acquire riches; however, as to Mr Belfield Mr Belfield wealth can be of no  consequence, why should my regard to Mr Belfield wait for it? if Mr Belfield is a young man of  worth and honour—" "Mortimer," interrupted Mr Delvile, "whatever Mr Belfield is, we know Mr Belfield is not a man of  rank, and whatever Mr Belfield may be, we know Mr Belfield cannot become a man of family, and  consequently for Mrs Delvile Mr Belfield is no companion. If you can render Mr Belfield any  service, I shall commend your so doing; you can render him any  service becomes your birth, you can render him any  service becomes your  station in life to assist individuals, and promote the general good: but never  in your zeal for others forget what is due to yourself, and to the ancient and  honourable house from which you are sprung." "But can we entertain Miss Beverley with nothing better than family lectures?"  cried Mrs Delvile. "It is for me," said Mrs Delvile, rising, "to beg pardon of Miss Beverley for  having occasioned Mrs Delvile: but when Miss Beverley is so good as to honour us with Miss Beverley  company again, I hope I shall have more discretion." He then left the room; and Mr Delvile also rising to go, said, "My dear, I  commit you to very kind hands; Mrs Delvile, I am sure, will be happy to hear  your story; speak to Mrs Delvile, therefore, without reserve. And pray don't imagine  that I make you over to Mrs Delvile from any slight; on the contrary, I admire and  commend your modesty very much; but my time is extremely precious, and I cannot  devote so much of the contrary to an explanation as your diffidence requires." And then, to the great joy of Cecilia, he retired; leaving Mrs Delvile much in doubt  whether he haughtiness or he condescension humbled Mrs Delvile most. "These men," said Mrs Delvile, "can never comprehend the pain of a delicate  female mind upon entering into explanations of this sort: I understand it,  however, too well to inflict it. These men will, therefore, have no explanations at  all till These men are better acquainted, and then if you will venture to favour me  with any confidence, my best advice, and, should any be in my power, my best  services shall be at your command." "You do me, madam, much honour," answered Cecilia, "but I must assure you I  have no explanation to give." "Well, well, at present," returned Mrs Delvile, "I am content to hear that  answer, as I have acquired no right to any other: but hereafter I shall hope  for more openness: it is promised me by your countenance, and I mean to claim  the promise by my friendship." "Your friendship will both honour and delight me, and whatever are your  enquiries, I shall always be proud to answer your  enquiries; but indeed, with regard to  this affair—" "My dear Miss Beverley," interrupted Mrs Delvile, with a look of arch  incredulity, "men seldom risk men lives where an escape is without hope of  recompence. But we will not now say a word more upon the subject. I hope you  will often favour me with your company, and by the frequency of your visits,  make us both forget the shortness of our acquaintance." Cecilia, finding Cecilia resistance only gave birth to fresh suspicion, now  yielded, satisfied that a very little time must unavoidably clear up the truth.  But Cecilia visit was not therefore shortened; the sudden partiality with which the  figure and countenance of Mrs Delvile had impressed Cecilia, was quickly ripened  into esteem by the charms of Cecilia conversation: Cecilia found Cecilia sensible, well  bred, and high spirited, gifted by nature with superior talents, and polished  by education and study with all the elegant embellishments of cultivation. Cecilia  saw in Cecilia, indeed, some portion of the pride Cecilia had been taught to expect,  but it was so much softened by elegance, and so well tempered with kindness,  that it elevated Cecilia character, without rendering Cecilia manners offensive. With such a woman, subjects of discourse could never be wanting, nor fertility  of powers to make them entertaining: and so much was Cecilia delighted with Cecilia  visit, that though Cecilia carriage was announced at twelve o'clock, Cecilia  reluctantly concluded her carriage at two; and in taking Cecilia leave, gladly accepted an  invitation to dine with Cecilia new friend three days after; who, equally pleased  with Cecilia young guest, promised before that time to return her visit.
