 Cecelia passed the rest of the day in fanciful projects of beneficence; she  determined to wander with her romantic new ally whither-so-ever he would lead  her, and to spare neither fortune, time, nor trouble, in seeking and relieving  the distressed. Not all her attempted philosophy had calmed her mind like this  plan; in merely refusing indulgence to grief, she had only locked it up in her  heart, where eternally struggling for vent, she was almost overpowered by  restraining it; but now her affliction had no longer her whole faculties to  itself; the hope of doing good, the pleasure of easing pain, the intention of  devoting her time to the service of the unhappy, once more delighted her  imagination,—that source of promissory enjoyment, which though often  obstructed, is never, in youth, exhausted. She would not give Mrs Charlton the unnecessary pain of hearing the letter with  which she had been so, much affected, but she told her of the visit of Albany,  and pleased her with the account of their scheme. At night, with less sadness than usual, she retired to rest. In her sleep she  bestowed riches, and poured plenty upon the land; she humbled the oppressor,  she exalted the oppressed; slaves were raised to dignities, captives restored  to liberty; beggars saw smiling abundance, and wretchedness was banished the  world. From a cloud in which she was supported by angels, Cecilia beheld these  wonders, and while enjoying the glorious illusion, she was awakened by her  maid, with news that Mrs Charlton was dying! She started up, and, undressed, was running to her apartment,—when the maid,  calling to stop her, confessed she was already dead! She had made her exit in the night, but the time was not exactly known; her own  maid, who slept in the room with her, going early to her bedside to enquire how  she did, found her cold and motionless, and could only conclude that a  paralytic stroke had taken her off. Happily and in good time had Cecilia been somewhat recruited by one night of  refreshing slumbers and flattering dreams, for the shock she now received  promised her not soon another. She lost in Mrs Charlton a friend, whom nearly from her infancy she had  considered as a mother, and by whom she had been cherished with tenderness  almost unequalled. She was not a woman of bright parts, or much cultivation,  but her heart was excellent, and her disposition was amiable. Cecilia had known  her longer than her memory could look back, though the earliest circumstances  she could trace were kindnesses received from her. Since she had entered into  life, and found the difficulty of the part she had to act, to this worthy old  lady alone had she unbosomed her secret cares. Though little assisted by her  counsel, she was always certain of her sympathy; and while her own superior  judgment directed her conduct, she had the relief of communicating her schemes,  and weighing her perplexities, with a friend to whom nothing that concerned her  was indifferent, and whose greatest wish and chief pleasure was the enjoyment  of her conversation. If left to herself, in the present period of her life, Mrs Charlton had  certainly not been the friend of her choice. The delicacy of her mind, and the  refinement of her ideas, had now rendered her fastidious, and she would have  looked out for elegancies and talents to which Mrs Charlton had no pretensions:  but those who live in the country have little power of selection; confined to a  small circle, they must be content with what it offers; and however they may  idolize extraordinary merit when they meet with it, they must not regard it as  essential to friendship, for in their circumscribed rotation, whatever may be  their discontent, they can make but little change. Such had been the situation to which Mrs Charlton and Mrs Harrel owed the  friendship of Cecilia. Greatly their superior in understanding and  intelligence, had the candidates for her favour been more numerous, the  election had not fallen upon either of them. But she became known to both  before discrimination made her difficult, and when her enlightened mind  discerned their deficiencies, they had already an interest in her affections,  which made her see them with lenity: and though sometimes, perhaps, conscious  she should not have chosen them from many, she adhered to them with sincerity,  and would have changed them for none. Mrs Harrel, however, too weak for similar sentiments, forgot her when out of  sight, and by the time they met again, was insensible to everything but shew  and dissipation. Cecilia, shocked and surprised, first grieved from  disappointed affection, and then lost that affection in angry contempt. But her  fondness for Mrs Charlton had never known abatement, as the kindness which had  excited it had never known allay. She had loved her first from childish  gratitude; but that love, strengthened and confirmed by confidential  intercourse, was now as sincere and affectionate as if it had originated from  sympathetic admiration. Her loss, therefore, was felt with the utmost severity,  and neither seeing nor knowing any means of replacing it, she considered it as  irreparable, and mourned it with bitterness. When the first surprize of this cruel stroke was somewhat lessened, she sent an  express to Mr Monckton with the news, and entreated to see him immediately. He  came without delay, and she begged his counsel what step she ought herself to  take in consequence of this event. Her own house was still unprepared for her;  she had of late neglected to hasten the workmen, and almost forgotten her  intention of entering it. It was necessary, however, to change her abode  immediately; she was no longer in the house of Mrs Charlton, but of her  grand-daughters and co-heiresses, each of whom she disliked, and upon neither  of whom she had any claim. Mr Monckton then, with the quickness of a man who utters a thought at the very  moment of its projection, mentioned a scheme upon which during his whole ride  he had been ruminating; which was that she would instantly remove to his house,  and remain there till settled to her satisfaction. Cecilia objected her little right of surprising Lady Margaret; but, without  waiting to discuss it, lest new objections should arise, he quitted her, to  fetch himself from her ladyship an invitation he meant to insist upon her  sending. Cecilia, though heartily disliking this plan, knew not at present what better  to adopt, and thought anything preferable to going again to Mrs Harrel, since  that only could be done by feeding the anxiety of Mr Arnott. Mr Monckton soon returned with a message of his own fabrication; for his lady,  though obliged to receive whom he pleased, took care to guard inviolate the  independence of speech, sullenly persevering in refusing to say anything, or  perversely saying only what he least wished to hear. Cecilia then took a hasty leave of Miss Charltons, who, little affected by what  they had lost, and eager to examine what they had gained, parted from her  gladly, and, with a heavy heart and weeping eyes, borrowed for the last time  the carriage of her late worthy old friend, and for-ever quitting her  hospitable house, sorrowfully set out for the Grove.
