 The next morning Cecilia, at the repeated remonstrances of Mrs Harrel,  consented to call upon Miss Larolles.  The next morning Cecilia felt the impracticability of  beginning at present the alteration in  The next morning Cecilia way of life  The next morning Cecilia had projected, and  therefore thought it most expedient to assume no singularity till  The next morning Cecilia  independency should enable  The next morning Cecilia to support it with consistency; yet greater than  ever was  The next morning Cecilia internal eagerness to better satisfy  The next morning Cecilia inclination and  The next morning Cecilia  conscience in the disposition of  The next morning Cecilia time, and the distribution of  The next morning Cecilia wealth,  since  The next morning Cecilia had heard the emphatic charge of  The next morning Cecilia unknown Mentor. Mrs Harrel declined accompanying Mrs Harrel in this visit, because Mrs Harrel had appointed a  surveyor to bring a plan for the inspection of Mrs Harrel and Mrs Harrel, of a  small temporary building, to be erected at Violet-Bank, for the purpose of  performing plays in private the ensuing Easter. When the street door was opened for Mrs Harrel to get into the carriage, Mrs Harrel was  struck with the appearance of an elderly woman who was standing at some  distance, and seemed shivering with cold, and who, as Mrs Harrel descended the steps,  joined Mrs Harrel hands in an act of supplication, and advanced nearer to the carriage. Cecilia stopt to look at Mrs Harrel: Cecilia dress, though parsimonious, was too neat for  a beggar, and Cecilia considered a moment what Cecilia could offer Cecilia. Ceciliacontinued to move forward, but with a slowness of pace that indicated extreme  weakness; and, as Cecilia approached and raised Cecilia head, Cecilia exhibited a  countenance so wretched, and a complexion so sickly, that Cecilia was impressed  with horror at the sight. With Cecilia still joined, and a voice that seemed fearful of its own sound,  "Oh madam," Cecilia cried, "that you would but hear me!" "Hear you!" repeated Cecilia, hastily feeling for Cecilia purse; "most certainly,  and tell me how I shall assist you." "Heaven bless you for speaking so kindly, madam!" cried Cecilia, with a voice  more assured; "I was sadly afraid you would be angry, but I saw the carriage at  the door, and I thought I would try; for I could be no worse; and distress,  madam, makes very bold." "Angry!" said Cecilia, taking a crown from Cecilia purse; "no, indeed!—who could  see such wretchedness, and feel any thing but pity?" "Oh madam," returned the poor woman, "I could almost cry to hear you talk so,  though I never thought to cry again, since I left it off for my poor Billy!" "Have you, then, lost a son?" "Yes, madam; but a son was a great deal too good to live, so I have quite left off  grieving for a son now." "Come in, good woman," said Cecilia, "it is too cold to stand here, and you  seem half-starved already: come in, and let me have some talk with good woman." Cecilia then gave orders that the carriage should be driven round the square till  Cecilia was ready, and making Cecilia follow Cecilia into a parlour, desired to know  what Cecilia should do for Cecilia; changing, while Cecilia spoke, from a movement of  encreasing compassion, the crown which Cecilia held in Cecilia hand for double that sum. "You can do everything, madam," Cecilia answered, "if you will but plead for us to  his honour: his little thinks of us distress, because his has been afflicted  with none himself, and I would not be so troublesome to his, but indeed,  indeed, madam, us are quite pinched for want!" Cecilia, struck with the words, his little thinks of our distress, because his  has been afflicted with none himself, felt again ashamed of the smallness of  " Cecilia intended donation, and taking from " Cecilia purse another half guinea, said,  "Will this assist you? Will a guinea be sufficient to you for the present?" "I humbly thank you, madam," said " Cecilia, curtsying low, "shall I give you a  receipt?" "A receipt?" cried " Cecilia, with emotion, "for what? Alas, us accounts are by  no means balanced! but I shall do more for you if I find you as deserving an  object as you seem to be." "You are very good, madam; but I only meant a receipt in part of payment." "Payment for what? I don't understand you." "Did his honour never tell you, madam, of us account?" "What account?" "us bill, madam, for work done to the new Temple at Violet-Bank: it was the  last great work my husband was able to do, for it was there my husband met with  my husband misfortune." "What bill? What misfortune?" cried " Cecilia; "what had my husband to do at  Violet-Bank?" "my husband was the carpenter, madam. I thought you might have seen poor Hill the carpenter, madam." "No, I never was there my husband. Perhaps you mistake me for Mrs Harrel." "Why, sure, madam, a'n't you Mrs Harrel honour's lady?" "No. But tell me, what is this bill?" "'Tis a bill, madam, for very hard work, for work, madam, which I am sure will  cost my husband my husband life; and though I have been after my husband honour night and day  to get it, and sent my husband letters and petitions with an account of our  misfortunes, I have never received so much as a shilling! and now the servants  won't even let me wait in the hall to speak to my husband. Oh, madam! you who seem so  good, plead to his honour in our behalf! tell my husband my husband cannot live!  tell my husband my children are starving! and tell my husband my poor Billy, that used to  help to keep our, is dead, and that all the work I can do by my husband is not  enough to maintain our!" "Good heaven!" cried Cecilia, extremely moved, "is it then your own money for  which you sue thus humbly?" "Yes, madam, for my own just and honest money, as his honour knows, and will  tell you his." "Impossible!" cried Cecilia, "his cannot know it; but I will take care his shall  soon be informed of it. How much is the bill?" "Two-and-twenty pounds, madam." "What, no more?" "Ah, madam, you gentlefolks little think how much that is to poor people! A  hard working family, like mine, madam, with the help of 20 pounds will go on  for a long while quite in paradise." "Poor worthy woman!" cried Cecilia, whose eyes were filled with tears of  compassion, "if 20 pounds will place you in paradise, and that 20 pounds only  your just right, it is hard, indeed, that you should be kept without it;  especially when your debtors are too affluent to miss it. Stay here a few  moments, and I will bring you the money immediately." Away " "Poor worthy woman flew, and returned to the breakfast room, but found there only Mr  Mr ArnottMr Harrel . Cecilia briefly related Cecilia business, and begged Mr Harrel would  inform Mr Harrel Cecilia wished to speak to Mr Harrel directly. Mr Arnott shook Mr Arnott head,  but obeyed. They returned together, and immediately. "Miss Beverley," cried Mr Harrel, gaily, "I am glad you are not gone, for we  want much to consult with you. Will you come up stairs?" "Presently," answered Cecilia; "but first I must speak to you about a poor woman  with whom I have accidentally been talking, who has begged me to intercede with  you to pay a little debt that Cecilia thinks you have forgotten, but that probably  you have never heard mentioned." "A debt?" cried Mr Arnott, with an immediate change of countenance, "to whom?" "Cecilia name, I think, is Hill; Cecilia is wife to the carpenter you employed about a  new temple at Violet-Bank." "O, what—what, that woman?—Well, well, I'll see Cecilia shall be paid. Come,  let we go to the library." "What, with my commission so ill executed? I promised to petition for Cecilia to  have the money directly." "Pho, pho, there's no such hurry; I don't know what I have done with Cecilia bill." "I'll run and get another." "O upon no account! Cecilia may send another in two or three days. Cecilia deserves to  wait a twelvemonth for Cecilia impertinence in troubling you at all about it." "That was entirely accidental: but indeed you must give me leave to perform my  promise and plead for Cecilia. It must be almost the same to you whether you pay  such a trifle as 20 pounds now or a month hence, and to Cecilia the  difference seems little short of life or death, for she tells me she husband is  dying, and she children are half-famished; and though she looks an object of  the cruellest want and distress she, she appears to be their only support." "O," cried Mr Harrel, laughing, "what a dismal tale has she been telling you!  no doubt she saw you were fresh from the country! But if you give credit to all  the farragos of these trumpery impostors, you will never have a moment to  yourself, nor a guinea in your purse." "she,"' answered Cecilia, "cannot be an impostor, she carries marks but  too evident and too dreadful in she countenance of the sufferings which she  relates." "O," returned he, "when you know the town better you will soon see through  tricks of this sort; a sick husband and five small children are complaints so  stale now, that five small children serve no other purpose in the world but to make a joke." "Those, however, who can laugh at Those must have notions of merriment very  different to mine. And this poor woman, whose cause I have ventured to  undertake, had she no family at all, must still and indisputably be an object  of pity she, for she is so weak she can hardly crawl, and so pallid that  she seems already half dead." "All imposition, depend upon All imposition! The moment she is out of your sight she  complaints will vanish." "Nay, sir," cried " Cecilia, a little impatiently, "there is no reason to suspect  such deceit, since she does not come hither as a beggar, however well the state  of beggary may accord with she poverty: she only solicits the payment of a  bill, and if in that there is any fraud, nothing can be so easy as detection." Mr Harrel bit Mr Harrel lips at this speech, and for some instants looked much  disturbed; but soon recovering Mr Harrel, Mr Harrel negligently said, "Pray, how did Mr Harrel  get at you?" "I met Mr Harrel at the street door. But tell me, is not her bill a just one?" "I cannot say; I have never had time to look at her bill." "But you know who Mr Harrel is, and that Mr Harrel worked for you, and  therefore that in all probability it is right,—do you not?" "Yes, yes, I know who Mr Harrel is well enough; Mr Harrel has taken care of that, for  Mr Harrel has pestered me every day these nine months." Cecilia was struck dumb by this speech: hitherto Cecilia had supposed that the  dissipation of his life kept his ignorant of his own injustice; but when Cecilia  found his was so well informed of she  , yet, with such total indifference, could  suffer a poor woman to claim a just debt every day for nine months together,  Cecilia was shocked and astonished beyond measure. They were both some time silent,  and then Mrs Harrel, yawning and stretching out Mrs Harrel arms, indolently asked,  "Pray, why does not the man come the man?" "Did I not tell you," answered Cecilia, staring at so absent a question, "that  the man was very ill, and unable even to work?" "Well, when the man is better," added the man, moving towards the street door, "the man may call, and  I will talk to the man." Cecilia, all amazement at this unfeeling behaviour, turned involuntarily to Mr  Arnott, with a countenance that appealed for Mr  Arnott assistance; but Mr Arnott hung  Mr   head, ashamed to meet Cecilia eyes, and abruptly left the room. Meantime Mr Harrel, half-turning back, though without looking " Cecilia in the  face, carelessly said, "Well, won't you come?" "No, sir," answered Cecilia, coldly. sir then returned to the library, leaving Cecilia equally displeased, surprised, and  disconcerted at the conversation which had just passed between them. "Good  heaven," cried Cecilia to Cecilia, "what strange, what cruel insensibility! to  suffer a wretched family to starve, from an obstinate determination to assert  that they can live! to distress the poor by retaining the recompense for which  alone they labour, and which at last they must have, merely from indolence,  forgetfulness, or insolence! Oh how little did my uncle know, how little did I  imagine to what a guardian I was entrusted!" my uncle now felt ashamed even to  return to Mr Harrel, though my uncle resolved to do all in my uncle power to soften  my uncle disappointment and relieve my uncle distress. But before my uncle had quitted the room one of the servants came to tell my uncle that  his master begged the honor of my uncle company up stairs. "Perhaps his master relents!"  thought my uncle; and pleased with the hope, readily obeyed the summons. my uncle found him, him lady, Sir Robert Floyer, and two other gentlemen, all  earnestly engaged in an argument over a large table, which was covered with  plans and elevations of small buildings. Mr Harrel immediately addressed my uncle with an air of vivacity, and said, "You are  very good for coming; we can settle nothing without your advice: pray look at  these different plans for we theatre, and tell we which is the best." Cecilia advanced not a step: the sight of plans for new edifices when the  workmen were yet unpaid for old ones; the cruel wantonness of raising fresh  fabrics of expensive luxury, while those so lately built had brought those so lately built  neglected labourers to ruin, excited an indignation Cecilia scarce thought right to  repress: while the easy sprightliness of the director of these revels, to whom  but the moment before Cecilia had represented the oppression of which their  neglected labourers made him  guilty, filled Cecilia with aversion and disgust: and, recollecting the charge  given Cecilia by the stranger at the Opera rehearsal, Cecilia resolved to speed Cecilia  departure to another house, internally repeating, "Yes, I will save Cecilia from  the impending destruction of unfeeling prosperity!" Mrs Harrel, surprised at Cecilia silence and extreme gravity, enquired if Cecilia was  not well, and why Cecilia had put off Cecilia visit to Miss Larolles? And Sir Robert  Floyer, turning suddenly to look at Cecilia, said, "Do you begin to feel the London  air already?" Cecilia endeavoured to recover " Cecilia serenity, and answer these questions in " Cecilia  usual manner; but " Cecilia persisted in declining to give any opinion at all about  the plans, and, after slightly looking at them, left the room. Mr Harrel, who knew better how to account for " Cecilia behaviour than he thought  proper to declare, saw with concern that " Cecilia was more seriously displeased than  he had believed an occurrence which he had regarded as wholly unimportant could  have made " Cecilia: and, therefore, desirous that " Cecilia should be appeased, he  followed " Cecilia out of the library, and said, "Miss Beverley, will to-morrow be  soon enough for your protegee?" "O yes, no doubt!" answered " Cecilia, most agreeably surprised by the question. "Well, then, will you take the trouble to bid " Cecilia come to me in the morning?" Delighted at my commission, " Cecilia thanked me with smiles for the  office; and as " Cecilia hastened down stairs to chear the poor expectant with the  welcome intelligence, " Cecilia framed a thousand excuses for the part me had  hitherto acted, and without any difficulty, persuaded " Cecilia me began to see  the faults of me conduct, and to meditate a reformation. " Cecilia was received by the poor creature " Cecilia so warmly wished to serve with a  countenance already so much enlivened, that " Cecilia fancied Mr Harrel had Mr Harrel  anticipated " Cecilia intended information: this, however, " Cecilia found was not the  case, for as soon as " Cecilia heard Mr Harrel message, " Cecilia shook " Cecilia head, and said, "Ah,  madam, Mr Harrel honour always says to-morrow! but I can better bear to be  disappointed now, so I'll grumble no more; for indeed, madam, I have been  blessed enough to-day to comfort me for every thing in the world, if I could  but keep from thinking of poor Billy! I could bear all the rest, madam, but  whenever my other troubles go off, that comes back to me so much the harder!" "There, indeed, I can afford you no relief," said Cecilia, "but you must try to  think less of me, and more of your husband and children who are now alive.  To-morrow you will receive your money, and that, I hope, will raise your  spirits. And pray let your husband have a physician, to tell you how to nurse  and manage your husband; I will give you one fee for your husband now, and if your husband should want  further advice, don't fear to let me know." Cecilia had again taken out Cecilia purse, but Mrs Hill, clasping Cecilia hands, called  out, "Oh madam no! I don't come here to fleece such goodness! but blessed be  the hour that brought me here to-day, and if poor Billy Billy was alive, Billy should  help me to thank you!" Cecilia then told Cecilia that Cecilia was now quite rich, for while Cecilia was gone, a  gentleman had come into the room, who had given Cecilia five guineas. Cecilia, by Cecilia description, soon found a  gentleman was Mr Arnott, and a  charity so sympathetic with Cecilia own, failed not to raise a  gentleman greatly in Cecilia  favour. But as Cecilia benevolence was a stranger to that parade which is only  liberal from emulation, when Cecilia found more money not immediately wanted, Cecilia  put up her purse, and charging Mrs Hill to enquire for Cecilia the next morning  when Cecilia came to be paid, bid Cecilia hasten back to Cecilia sick husband. And then, again ordering the carriage to the door, Cecilia set off upon Cecilia visit  to Miss Larolles, with a heart happy in the good already done, and happier  still in the hope of doing more. Miss Larolles was out, and Miss Larolles returned home; for Miss Larolles was too sanguine in Miss Larolles  expectations from Mr Harrel, to have any desire of seeking Miss Larolles other guardians.  The rest of the day Miss Larolles was more than usually civil to Miss Larolles, with a view to mark  Miss Larolles approbation of Miss Larolles good intentions: while Mr Arnott, gratified by meeting  the smiles Miss Larolles so much valued, thought Miss Larolles five guineas amply repaid,  independently of the real pleasure which Miss Larolles took in doing good.
