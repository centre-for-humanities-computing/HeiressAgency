 Unable to relieve herself from this perplexity, Cecilia, to divert her chagrin,  again visited Miss Belfield. She had then the pleasure to hear that her brother  was much recovered, and had been able, the preceding day, to take an airing,  which he had borne so well that Mr Rupil had charged him to use the same  exercise every morning. "And will he?" said Cecilia. "No, madam, I am sadly afraid not," she answered, "for coach hire is very  expensive, and we are willing, now, to save all we can in order to help fitting  him out for going abroad." Cecilia then earnestly entreated her to accept some assistance; but she assured  her she did not dare without the consent of her mother, which, however, she  undertook to obtain. The next day, when Cecilia called to hear her success, Mrs Belfield, who  hitherto had kept out of sight, made her appearance. She found her, alike in  person, manners and conversation, a coarse and ordinary woman, not more unlike  her son in talents and acquired accomplishments, than dissimilar to her  daughter in softness and natural delicacy. The moment Cecilia was seated, she began, without waiting for any ceremony, or  requiring any solicitation, abruptly to talk of her affairs, and repiningly to  relate her misfortunes. "I find, madam," she said, "you have been so kind as to visit my daughter Henny  a great many times, but as I have no time for company, I have always kept out  of the way, having other things to do than sit still to talk. I have had a sad  time of it here, ma'am, with my poor son's illness, having no conveniencies  about me, and much ado to make him mind me; for he's all for having his own  way, poor dear soul, and I'm sure I don't know who could contradict him, for  it's what I never had the heart to do. But then, ma'am, what is to come of it?  You see how bad things go! for though I have got a very good income, it won't  do for every thing. And if it was as much again, I should want to save it all  now. For here my poor son, you see, is reduced all in a minute, as one may say,  from being one of the first gentlemen in the town, to a mere poor object,  without a farthing in the world!" "He is, however, I hope now much better in his health?" said Cecilia. "Yes, madam, thank heaven, for if he was worse, those might tell of it that  would, for I'm sure I should never live to hear of it. He has been the best son  in the world, madam, and used [to] nothing but the best company, for I spared  neither pains nor cost to bring him up genteely, and I believe there's not a  nobleman in the land that looks more the gentleman. However, there's come no  good of it, for though his acquaintances was all among the first quality, he  never received the value of a penny from the best of them. So I have no great  need to be proud. But I meant for the best, though I have often enough wished I  had not meddled in the matter, but left him to be brought up in the shop, as  his father was before him." "His present plan, however," said Cecilia, "will I hope make you ample amends  both for your sufferings and your tenderness." "What, madam, when he's going to leave me, and settle in foreign parts? If you  was a mother yourself, madam, you would not think that such good amends." "Settle?" said Cecilia. "No, he only goes for a year or two." "That's more than I can say, madam, or any body else; and nobody knows what may  happen in that time. And how I shall keep myself up when he's beyond seas, I am  sure I don't know, for he has always been the pride of my life, and every penny  I saved for him, I thought to have been paid in pounds." "You will still have your daughter, and she seems so amiable, that I am sure  you can want no consolation she will not endeavour to give you." "But what is a daughter, madam, to such a son as mine? a son that I thought to  have seen living like a prince, and sending his own coach for me to dine with  him! And now he's going to be taken away from me, and nobody knows if I shall  live till he comes back. But I may thank myself, for if I had but been content  to see him brought up in the shop—yet all the world would have cried shame  upon it, for when he was quite a child in arms, the people used all to say he  was born to be a gentleman, and would live to make many a fine lady's heart  ache." "If he can but make your heart easy," said Cecilia, smiling, "we will not  grieve that the fine ladies should escape the prophecy." "O, ma'am, I don't mean by that to say he has been over gay among the ladies,  for it's a thing I never heard of him; and I dare say if any lady was to take a  fancy to him, she'd find there was not a modester young man in the world. But  you must needs think what a hardship it is to me to have him turn out so  unlucky, after all I have done for him, when I thought to have seen him at the  top of the tree, as one may say!" "He will yet, I hope," said Cecilia, "make you rejoice in all your kindness to  him: his health is already returning, and his affairs wear again a more  prosperous aspect." "But do you suppose, ma'am, that having him sent two or three hundred miles  away from me; with some young master to take care of, is the way to make up to  me what I have gone through for him? why I used to deny myself every thing in  the world, in order to save money to buy him smart cloaths, and let him go to  the Opera, and Ranelagh, and such sort of places, that he might keep himself in  fortune's way! and now you see the end of it! here he is, in a little shabby  room up two pairs of stairs, with not one of the great folks coming near him,  to see if he's so much as dead or alive." "I do not wonder," said Cecilia, "that you resent their shewing so little  gratitude for the pleasure and entertainment they have formerly received from  him but comfort yourself that it will at least secure you from any similar  disappointment, as Mr Belfield will, in future, be guarded from forming such  precarious expectations." "But what good will that do me, ma'am, for all the money he has been throwing  after them all this while? do you think I would have scraped it up for him, and  gone without every thing in the world, to see it all end in this manner? why he  might as well have been brought up the commonest journeyman, for any comfort I  shall have of him at this rate. And suppose he should be drowned in going  beyond seas? what am I to do then?" "You must not," said Cecilia, "indulge such fears; I doubt not but your son  will return well, and return all that you wish." "Nobody knows that, ma'am; and the only way to be certain is for him not to go  at all; and I'm surprised, ma'am, you can wish him to make such a journey to  nobody knows where, with nothing but a young master that he must as good as  teach his A. B. C. all the way they go!" "Certainly," said Cecilia, amazed at this accusation, "I should not wish him to  go abroad, if any thing more eligible could be, done by his remaining in  England but as no prospect of that sort seems before him, you must endeavour to  reconcile yourself to parting with him." "Yes, but how am I to do that, when I don't know if ever I shall see him again?  Who could have thought of his living so among the great folks, and then coming  to want! I'm sure I thought they'd have provided for him like a son of their  own, for he used to go about to all the public places just as they did  themselves. Day after day I used to be counting for when he would come to tell  me he'd got a place at court, or something of that sort, for I never could tell  what it would be: and then the next news I heard, was that he was shut up in  this poor bit of place, with nobody troubling their heads about him! however,  I'll never be persuaded but he might have done better, if he would but have  spoke a good word for himself, or else have let me done it for him: instead of  which, he never would so much as let me see any of his grand friends, though I  would not have made the least scruple in the world to have asked them for any  thing he had a mind to." Cecilia again endeavoured to give her comfort; but finding her only  satisfaction was to express her discontent, she arose to take leave. But,  turning first to Miss Belfield, contrived to make a private enquiry whether she  might repeat her offer of assistance. A downcast and dejected look answering in  the affirmative, she put into her hand a ten pound bank note, and wishing them  good morning, hurried out of the room. Miss Belfield was running after her, but stopt by her mother, who called out,  "What is it?—How much is it?—Let me look at it!"—And then, following  Cecilia herself, she thanked her aloud all the way down stairs for her  genteelness, assuring her she would not fail making it known to her son. Cecilia at this declaration turned back, and exhorted her by no means to  mention it; after which she got into her chair, and returned home; pitying Miss  Belfield for the unjust partiality shewn to her brother, and excusing the proud  shame he had manifested of his relations, from the vulgarity and selfishness of  her who was at the head of them. Almost a fortnight had now elapsed since her explanation with young Delvile,  yet not once had he been in Portman-square, though in the fortnight which had  preceded, scarce a day had passed which had not afforded him some pretence for  calling there. At length a note arrived from Mrs Delvile. It contained the most flattering  reproaches for her long absence, and a pressing invitation that she would dine  and spend the next day with her. Cecilia, who had merely denied herself the pleasure of this visit from an  apprehension of seeming too desirous of keeping up the connection, now, from  the same sense of propriety, determined upon making it, wishing equally to  avoid all appearance of consciousness, either by seeking or avoiding the  intimacy of the family. Not a little was her anxiety to know in what manner young Delvile would receive  her, whether he would be grave or gay, agitated, as during their last  conversation, or easy, as in the meetings which had preceded it. She found Mrs Delvile, however, alone; and, extremely kind to her, yet much  surprised, and half displeased, that she had so long been absent. Cecilia,  though somewhat distressed what excuses to offer, was happy to find herself so  highly in favour, and not very reluctant to promise more frequent visits in  future. They were then summoned to dinner; but still no young Delvile was visible: they  were joined only by his father, and she found that no one else was expected. Her astonishment now was greater than ever, and she could account by no  possible conjecture for a conduct so extraordinary. Hitherto, whenever she had  visited in St James's-square by appointment, the air with which he had received  her, constantly announced that he had impatiently waited her arrival; he had  given up other engagements to stay with her, he had openly expressed his hopes  that she would never be long absent, and seemed to take a pleasure in her  society to which every other was inferior. And now, how striking the  difference! he forbore all visits at the house where she resided, he even flew  from his own when he knew she was approaching it! Nor was this the only vexation of which this day was productive; Mr Delvile,  when the servants were withdrawn after dinner, expressed some concern that he  had been called from her during their last conversation, and added that he  would take the present opportunity to talk with her upon some matters of  importance. He then began the usual parading prelude, which, upon all occasions, he thought  necessary, in order to enhance the value of his interposition, remind her of  her inferiority, and impress her with a deeper sense of the honour which his  guardianship conferred upon her after which, he proceeded to make a formal  enquiry whether she had positively dismissed Sir Robert Floyer? She assured him she had. "I understood my Lord Ernolf," said he, "that you had totally discouraged the  addresses of his son?" "Yes, Sir," answered Cecilia, "for I never mean to receive them." "Have you, then, any other engagement?" "No, Sir," cried she, colouring between shame and displeasure, "none at all." "This is a very extraordinary circumstance!" replied he: "the son of an earl to  be rejected by a young woman of no family, and yet no reason assigned for it!" This contemptuous speech so cruelly shocked Cecilia, that though he continued  to harangue her for a great part of the afternoon, she only answered him when  compelled by some question, and was so evidently discomposed, that Mrs Delvile,  who perceived her uneasiness with much concern, redoubled her civilities and  caresses, and used every method in her power to oblige and enliven her. Cecilia was not ungrateful for her care, and shewed her sense of it by added  respect and attention; but her mind was disturbed, and she quitted the house as  soon as she was able. Mr Delvile's speech, from her previous knowledge of the extreme haughtiness of  his character, would not have occasioned her the smallest emotion, had it  merely related to him or to herself: but as it concerned Lord Ernolf, she  regarded it as also concerning his son, and she found that, far from trying to  promote the union Mr Monckton had told her he had planned, he did not seem even  to think of it, but, on the contrary, proposed and seconded with all his  interest another alliance. This, added to the behaviour of young Delvile, made her suspect that some  engagement was in agitation on his own part, and that while she thought him so  sedulous only to avoid her, he was simply occupied in seeking another. This  painful suggestion, which every thing seemed to confirm, again overset all her  schemes, and destroyed all her visionary happiness. Yet how to reconcile it  with what had passed at their last meeting she knew not; she had then every  reason to believe that his heart was in her power, and that courage, or an  opportunity more seasonable, was all he wanted to make known his devotion to  her; why, then, shun if he loved her? why, if he loved her not, seem so  perturbed at the explanation of her independence? A very little time, however, she hoped would unravel this mystery; in two days,  the entertainment which Mr Harrel had planned, to deceive the world by an  appearance of affluence to which he had lost all title, was to take place;  young Delvile, in common with every other person who had ever been seen at the  house, had early received an invitation, which he had readily promised to  accept some time before the conversation that seemed the period of their  acquaintance had passed. Should he, after being so long engaged, fail to keep  his appointment, she could no longer have any doubt of the justice of her  conjecture; should he, on the contrary, again appear, from his behaviour and  his looks she might perhaps be able to gather why he had so long been absent.
