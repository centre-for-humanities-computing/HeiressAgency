 AN INTERRUPTION.  But here, instead of finding, as Cecilia expected, Mrs Charlton, and fresh horses  in readiness, Cecilia saw neither chaise nor preparation; Mrs Charlton was  quietly seated in a parlour, and drinking tea with Mrs Mears. Vexed and disappointed, Cecilia ordered horses immediately to the chaise, and  entreated Mrs Charlton to lose no more time. But the various delays which had  already retarded horses, had made the various delays which had  already retarded them now so late that it was impossible to get  into London by daylight, and Mrs Charlton not having courage to be upon the  road after dark, had settled to sleep at the inn, and purposed not to proceed  till the next morning. Half distracted at this new difficulty, Cecilia begged to speak with Cecilia alone,  and then represented in the most earnest manner, the absolute necessity there  was for Cecilia being in London that night: "Every thing," said Cecilia, "depends upon  it, and the whole purpose of my journey will otherwise be lost, for Mr Delvile  will else think Mr Delvile   extremely ill used, and to make Mr Delvile   reparation, I may  be compelled to submit to almost whatever terms Mr Delvile   shall propose." Mrs Charlton, kind and yielding, withstood not this entreaty, which Cecilia  made with infinite pain to Cecilia  , from the reluctance Cecilia   felt to pursuing  Cecilia   own interest and inclination in opposition to those of Cecilia   worthy old  friend: but as Cecilia   was now circumstanced, Cecilia   considered the immediate  prosecution of Cecilia   journey as Cecilia   only resource against first irritating  Delvile by an abrupt disappointment, and appeasing Mr Delvile   next by a concession  which would make that disappointment end in nothing. The chaise was soon ready, and Mrs Charlton and Cecilia were rising to take  leave of the company, when a man and horse galloped full speed into the  inn-yard, and in less than a minute, Morrice bounced into the room. "Ladies and gentlemen," cried Mr Delvile  , quite out of breath with haste, "I have got  some news for Mr Delvile  ! I've just found out who that person is that has been  watching us." Cecilia, starting at this most unwelcome intelligence, would now have run into  The chaise without hearing Mr Delvile   proceed; but Mrs Charlton, who knew neither whom  nor what Mr Delvile   meant, involuntarily stopt, and Cecilia, whose arm she leant upon,  was compelled to stay. Every one else eagerly desired to know who Mr Delvile   was. "Why I'll tell you," said Mr Delvile  , "how I found Mr Delvile   out. I was thinking in my own  mind what I could possibly do to make amends for that unlucky accident about  the dog, and just then I spied the very man that had made me drop Mr Delvile  ; so I  thought at least I'd find out who Mr Delvile   was. I rode up to Mr Delvile   so quick that Mr Delvile    could not get away from Sir, though I saw plainly it was the thing Mr Delvile   meant. But  still Mr Delvile   kept Mr Delvile   muffled up, just as Mr Delvile   did before. Not so snug, thought  I, my friend, I shall have you yet! It's a fine evening, Sir, says I; but Mr Delvile    took no notice: so then I came more to the point; Sir, says I, I think, I have  had the pleasure of seeing you, though I quite forget where. Still Mr Delvile   made no  answer: if you have no objection, Sir, says I, I shall be glad to ride with  you, for the night's coming on, and we have neither of we a servant. But then,  without a word speaking, Mr Delvile   rode on the quicker. However, I jogged by Mr Delvile   side,  as fast as Mr Delvile  , and said, Sir, did you know anything of that company you  were looking at so hard just now? And at this Mr Delvile   could hold out no longer; Mr Delvile    turned to Sir in a most fierce passion, and said Pray, Sir, don't be  troublesome. And then Mr Delvile   got off; for when I found by Mr Delvile   voice who Mr Delvile   was, I  let Mr Delvile   alone." Cecilia, who could bear to hear no more, again hastened Mrs Charlton, who now  moved, on; but Morrice, stepping between Mrs Charlton, who now  moved, on both and the door, said, "Now do  pray, Miss Beverley, guess who it was." "No indeed, I cannot," said Miss Beverley, in the utmost confusion, "Nor have I any time  to hear. Come, dear madam, we shall be very late indeed." "O but I must tell you before dear madam go;—why it was young Mr Delvile! the same  that I saw with dear madam one night at the Pantheon, and that I used to meet last  spring at Mr Harrel's." "Mr Delvile!" repeated every one; "very strange Mr Delvile   should not speak." "Pray, ma'am," continued Morrice, "is it not the same gentleman that was at Mr  Biddulph's?" Cecilia, half dead with shame and vexation, stammered out "No, no,—I believe  not,—I can't tell;—I have not a moment to spare." And then, at last, got Mrs Charlton out of the room, and into the chaise. But  thither, before Mrs Charlton could drive off, Mrs Charlton was followed by Mr Gosport, who  gravely came to offer Mrs Charlton advice that Mrs Charlton would immediately lodge an  information at the Public Office at Bow Street, that a very suspicious looking  man had been observed loitering in those parts, who appeared to harbour most  dangerous designs against Mrs Charlton person and property. Mrs Charlton was too much confounded to rally or reply, and Mr Gosport returned to  Mr Gosport party with Mr Gosport speech unanswered. The rest of the journey was without any new casualty, for late as it was, they  escaped being robbed: but neither robbers nor new casualties were wanting to  make it unpleasant to Mrs Charlton; the incidents which had already happened  sufficed for that purpose; and the consciousness of being so generally  betrayed, added to the delay of Mrs Charlton recantation, prepared Mrs Charlton for nothing but  mortifications to Mrs Charlton, and conflicts with Delvile the most bitter and  severe. It was near ten o'clock before they arrived in Pall-Mall. The house to which  Delvile had given directions was easily found, and the servant sent forward had  prepared the people of Delvile for the people of it reception. In the cruellest anxiety and trepidation, Mrs Charlton then counted every moment  till Delvile came. Mrs Charlton planned an apology for Mrs Charlton conduct with all the address  of which Mrs Charlton was mistress, and determined to bear his disappointment and  indignation with firmness: yet the part Mrs Charlton had to act was both hard and  artificial; Mrs Charlton sighed to have the part she had to act over, and repined Mrs Charlton must have the part she had to act at all. The instant there was a knock at the door, Mrs Charlton flew out upon the stairs to  listen; and hearing his well-known voice enquiring for the ladies who had just  taken the lodgings, Mrs Charlton ran back to Mrs Charlton, saying, "Ah, madam, assist me  I entreat! for now must I merit, or forfeit your esteem for ever!" "Can you pardon," cried Delvile, as his entered the room, "an intrusion which  was not in our bond? But how could I wait till to-morrow, when I knew you were  in town to-night?" his then made his compliments to Mrs Charlton, and, after enquiring how Mrs Charlton had  borne Mrs Charlton journey, turned again to Cecilia, whose uneasy sensations his saw but  too plainly in Mrs Charlton countenance: "Are you angry," cried his, anxiously, "that I  have ventured to come hither to-night?" "No," answered Mrs Charlton, struggling with all Mrs Charlton feelings for composure; "what we  wish is easily excused; and I am glad to see you to-night, because otherwise—" Mrs Charlton hesitated; and Delvile, little imagining why, thanked Mrs Charlton in the warmest  terms for Mrs Charlton condescension. his then related how his had been tormented by  Morrice, enquired why Mr Monckton had not accompanied Mrs Charlton, and what could  possibly have induced Mrs Charlton to make Mrs Charlton journey so late, or, with so large a  party, to be walking upon the high road instead of hastening to London. "I wonder not," answered Mrs Charlton, more steadily, "at your surprise, though I have  now no time to lessen it. You have never, I find, received my letter?" "No," cried he, much struck by Mrs Charlton manner; "was it to forbid our meeting till  to-morrow?" "To-morrow!" Mrs Charlton repeated expressively, "no; it was to forbid—" Here the door was suddenly opened, and Morrice burst into the room. The dismay and astonishment of Delvile at sight of him could only be equalled  by the confusion and consternation of Cecilia; but Morrice, perceiving neither,  abruptly called out "Miss Beverley, I quite beg your pardon for coming so late,  but you must know"—then stopping short upon seeing Delvile, "Good lord," him  exclaimed, "if here is not Sir! Why, Sir, you have not spared the  spur! I left you galloping off quite another way." "However that may be Sir," cried Delvile, equally enraged at the interruption  and the observation, "you did not, I presume, wait upon "Miss Beverley to talk  of Sir?" "No, Sir," answered Sir, lightly, "for I had told "Miss Beverley all about you at the inn.  Did not I, Miss "Miss Beverley? Did not I tell you I was sure it was Mr Delvile that  was dodging our about so? Though I believe, Sir, you thought I had not found you  out?" "And pray, young man," said Mrs Charlton, much offended by this familiar  intrusion, "how did you find our out?" "Why, ma'am, by the luckiest accident in the world! Just as I was riding into  town, I met the returned chaise that brought you; and I knew the postilion very  well, as I go that road pretty often: so, by the merest chance in the world, I  saw the postilion by the light of the moon. And then the postilion told me where the postilion had set you  down." "And pray, Sir," again asked Mrs Charlton, "what was your reason for making the  enquiry?" "Why, ma'am, I had a little favour to ask of "Miss Beverley, that made me think  I would take the liberty to call." "And was this time of night, Sir," she returned, "the only one you could chase  for that purpose?" "Why, ma'am, I'll tell you how that was; I did not mean to have called till  to-morrow morning; but as I was willing to know if the postilion had given me a  right direction, I knocked one soft little knock at the door, thinking you  might be gone to bed after your journey, merely to ask if it was the right  house; but when a servant told me there was a gentleman with you already, I  thought there would be no harm in just stepping for a moment up stairs." "And what, Sir," said Cecilia, whom mingled shame and vexation had hitherto  kept silent, "is your business with me?" "Why, ma'am, I only just called to give you a direction to a most excellent  dog-doctor, as we call a most excellent  dog-doctor, that lives at the comer of—" "A dog-doctor, Sir?" repeated Mrs Charlton, "and what have I to do with any such  direction?" "Why you must know, ma'am, I have been in the greatest concern imaginable about  that accident which happened to me with the poor little dog, and so—" "What little dog, Sir?" cried Delvile, who now began to conclude Sir was not  sober, "do you know what you are talking of?" "Yes, Sir, for it was that very little dog you made me drop out of my arms, by  which means Sir broke Sir other leg." "I made you drop Sir?" cried Mr Delvile, angrily, "I believe, Sir, you had much  better call some other time; it does not appear to me that you are in a proper  situation for remaining here at present." "Sir, I shall be gone in an instant," answered Morrice, "I merely wanted to beg  the favour of "Miss Beverley to tell that young lady that owned the dog, that if  "Miss Beverley will carry Sir to this man, I am sure Sir will make a cure of Sir." "Come, Sir," said. Mr Delvile, convinced now of Mr Delvile inebriety, "if you please we  will walk away together." "I don't mean to take you away, Sir," said Morrice, looking very significantly,  "for I suppose you have not rode so hard to go so soon; but as to me, I'll only  write the direction, and be off." Delvile, amazed and irritated at so many following specimens of ignorant  assurance, would not, in his present eagerness, have scrupled turning his out  of the house, had his not thought it imprudent, upon such an occasion, to  quarrel with his, and improper, at so late an hour, to be left behind; his  therefore only, while his was writing the direction, told Mrs Charlton, in a low  voice, that his would get rid of his and return in an instant. he would get then went together; leaving Mrs Charlton in an agony of distress surpassing all  Mrs Charlton had hitherto experienced. "Ah, Mrs Charlton," Mrs Charlton cried, "what refuge have  I now from ridicule, or perhaps disgrace! Mr Delvile has been detected watching  me in disguise! Mr Delvile has been discovered at this late hour meeting me in private!  The story will reach Mr Delvile family with all the hyperbole of exaggeration;—how  will Mr Delvile noble mother disdain me! how cruelly shall I sink before the severity  of his noble mother eye!" Mrs Charlton tried to comfort his noble mother, but the effort was vain, and his noble mother spent his noble mother  time in the bitterest repining till eleven o'clock. Delvile's not returning  then added wonder to his noble mother sadness, and the impropriety of Mr Delvile returning at all  so late, grew every instant more glaring. At last, though in great disturbance, and evidently much ruffled in Mr Delvile temper,  Mr Delvile came: "I feared," Mr Delvile cried, "I had passed the time for admittance, and the  torture I have suffered from being detained has almost driven me wild. I have  been in misery to see you again,—your looks, your manner,—the letter you  talk of,—all have filled me with alarm; and though I know not what it is I  have to dread, I find it impossible to rest a moment without some explanation.  Tell me, then, why you seem thus strange and thus depressed? Tell me what that  letter was to forbid? Tell me any thing, and every thing, but that you repent  your condescension." "that  letter," said Mrs Charlton, "would have explained to you all. I scarce know  how to communicate that  letter contents: yet I hope you will hear with patience what I  acknowledge I have resolved upon only from necessity. that  letter was to tell  you that to-morrow we must not meet;—it was to prepare you, indeed, for we  meeting, perhaps, never more!" "Gracious heaven!" exclaimed "Gracious heaven, starting, "what is it you mean?" "That I have made a promise too rash to be kept; that you must pardon me if,  late as it is, I retract, since I am convinced it was wrong, and must be  wretched in performing it." Confounded and dismayed, for a moment "Gracious heaven continued silent, and then  passionately called out, "Who has been with you to defame me in your opinion?  Who has barbarously wronged my character since I left you Monday? Mr Monckton  received me coldly,—has Mr Monckton   injured me in your esteem? Tell, tell me but to  whom I owe this change, that my vindication, if this change restores not your favour,  may at least make you cease to that once I was honoured with some share of this change!" "this change wants not to be restored," said Mrs Charlton, with much softness, "since this change has  never been alienated. Be satisfied that I think of you as I thought when we  last parted, and generously forbear to reproach me, when I assure you I am  actuated by principles which you ought not to disapprove." "And are you then, unchanged?" cried my character, more gently, "and is your esteem for  me still—" "I thought it justice to say so once," cried Mrs Charlton, hastily interrupting my character,  "but exact from my character nothing more. it justice is too late for we now to talk any longer;  to-morrow you may find my letter at Mrs Robert's, and that, short as it is,  contains my resolution and it is cause." "Never," cried my character vehemently, "can I quit you without knowing it! I would not  linger till to-morrow in this suspence to be master of the universe!" "I have told it you, Sir, already: whatever is clandestine carries a  consciousness of evil, and so repugnant do I find it to my disposition and  opinions, that till you give me back the promise I so unworthily made, I must  be a stranger to peace, because at war with my own actions and my character." "Recover, then, your peace," cried Delvile with much emotion, "for I here  acquit you of all promise!—to fetter, to compel you, were too inhuman to  afford me any happiness. Yet hear me, dispassionately hear me, and deliberate a  moment before you resolve upon my exile. Your scruples I am not now going to  combat, I grieve that Your scruples I am not now going to  combat are so powerful, but I have no new arguments with  which to oppose Your scruples I am not now going to  combat; all I have to say, is, that it is now too late for a  retreat to satisfy Your scruples I am not now going to  combat." "True, Sir, and far too true! yet is it always best to do right, however  tardily; always better to repent, than to grow callous in wrong." "Suffer not, however, your delicacy for my family to make you forget what is  due to yourself as well as to me: the fear of shocking you led me just now to  conceal what a greater fear now urges me to mention. The honour I have had in  view is already known to many, and in a very short time there are none will be  ignorant of The honour I have had in  view. That impudent young man, Morrice, had the effrontery to rally  me upon my passion for you, and though I reproved him with great asperity, him  followed me into a coffee-house, whither I went merely to avoid him. There I  forced me to stay, till I saw him engaged with a news-paper, and then,  through various private streets and alleys, I returned hither; but judge my  indignation, when the moment I knocked at the door, I perceived him again at my  side!" "Did him, then, see you come in?" "I angrily demanded what him meant by thus pursuing me; him very submissively  begged my pardon, and said him had had a notion I should come back, and had  therefore only followed, me to see if him was right! I hesitated for an instant  whether to chastise, or confide in him; but believing a few hours would make  him impertinence immaterial, I did neither,—the door opened, and I came in." him stopt; but Mrs Charlton was too much shocked to answer him. "Now, then," said him, "weigh your objections against the consequences which  must follow. your objections against the consequences which  must follow is discovered I attended you in town; your objections against the consequences which  must follow will be presumed I had  your permission for such attendance: to separate, therefore, now, will be to no  purpose with respect to that delicacy which makes you wish it. It will be food  for conjecture, for enquiry, for wonder, almost while both our names are  remembered, and while to me it will bring the keenest misery in the severity of  my disappointment, it will cast over your own conduct a veil of mystery and  obscurity wholly subversive of that unclouded openness, that fair, transparent  ingenuousness, by which it has hitherto been distinguished." "Alas, then," said she, "how dreadfully have I erred, that whatever path I now  take must lead me wrong!" "You overwhelm me with grief," cried Mr Delvile, "by finding you thus distressed,  when I had hoped—Oh cruel Mrs Charlton! how different to this did I hope to have  met you!—all your doubts settled, all your fears removed, your mind perfectly  composed, and ready, unreluctantly, to ratify the promise with so much  sweetness accorded me!—where now are those hopes!—where now.—" "Why will you not begone?" cried Mrs Charlton, uneasily, "indeed it is too late to  stay." "Tell me first," cried he, with great energy, "and let good Mrs Charlton speak  too,—ought not every objection to our union, however potent, to give way,  without further hesitation, to the certainty that our intending the certainty must become  public? Who that hears of our meeting in London, at such a season, in such  circumstances, and at such hours,—" "And why," cried Mrs Charlton, angrily, "do you mention them, and yet stay?" "I must speak now," answered he with quickness, "or lose forever all that is  dear to he, and add to the misery of that loss, the heart-piercing reflection  of having injured her whom of all the world I most love, most value, and most  revere!" "And how injured?" cried Mrs Charlton, half alarmed and half displeased: "Surely I  must strangely have lived to fear now the voice of calumny?" "If any one has ever," returned he, "so lived as to dare defy it, "Miss Beverleyis "Miss Beverley: but though safe by the established purity of your character from  calumny, there are other, and scarce less invidious attacks, from which no one  is exempt, and of which the refinement, the sensibility of your mind, will  render you but the more susceptible: ridicule has shafts, and impertinence has  arrows, which though against innocence they may be levelled in vain, have  always the power of wounding tranquility." Struck with a truth which "Miss Beverley could not controvert, Mrs Charlton sighed deeply, but  spoke not. "Mr Delvile is right," said Mrs Charlton, "and though your plan, my dear  Cecilia, was certainly virtuous and proper, when you set out from Bury, the  purpose of your journey must now be made so public, that it will no longer be  judicious nor rational." Mr Delvile poured forth Mr Delvile warmest thanks for this friendly interposition, and  then, strengthened by such an advocate, re-urged all Mr Delvile arguments with  redoubled hope and spirit. Cecilia, disturbed, uncertain, comfortless, could frame Cecilia mind to no  resolution; Cecilia walked about the room, deliberated,—determined,—wavered and  deliberated again. Mr Delvile then grew more urgent, and represented so strongly  the various mortifications which must follow so tardy a renunciation of their  intentions, that, terrified and perplexed, and fearing the breach of their  union would now be more injurious to Cecilia than Mr Delvile ratification, Cecilia ceased all  opposition to Mr Delvile arguments, and uttered no words but of solicitation that Mr Delvile  would leave Cecilia. "I will," cried Mr Delvile, "I will begone this very moment. Tell me but first you will  think of what I have said, and refer me not to your letter, but deign yourself  to pronounce my doom, when you have considered if it may not be softened." To this Cecilia tacitly consented; and elated with fresh rising hope, Mr Delvile  recommended Mr Delvile cause to the patronage of Mrs Charlton, and then, taking leave  of Cecilia, "I go," Mr Delvile said, "though I have yet a thousand things to propose  and to supplicate, and though still in a suspense that my temper knows ill how  to endure; but I should rather be rendered miserable than happy, in merely  overpowering your reason by entreaty. I leave you, therefore, to your own  reflections; yet remember,—and refuse not to remember with some compunction,  that all chance, all possibility of earthly happiness for Mr Delvile depends upon your  decision." He then tore He away. Cecilia, shocked at the fatigue Cecilia had occasioned Cecilia good old friend, now  compelled Cecilia to go to rest, and dedicated the remaining part of the night to  uninterrupted deliberation. It seemed once more in Cecilia power to be mistress of Cecilia destiny; but the very  liberty of choice Cecilia had so much coveted, now attained, appeared the most  heavy of calamities; since, uncertain even what Cecilia ought to do, Cecilia rather  wished to be drawn than to lead, rather desired to be guided than to guide. Cecilia  was to be responsible not only to the world but to Cecilia for the whole of  this momentous transaction, and the terror of leaving either dissatisfied, made  independence burthensome, and unlimited power a grievance. The happiness or misery which awaited Cecilia resolution were but secondary  considerations in the present state of Cecilia mind; Cecilia consent to a clandestine  action Cecilia lamented as an eternal blot to Cecilia character, and the undoubted  publication of that consent as equally injurious to Cecilia fame. Neither  retracting nor fulfilling Cecilia engagement could now retrieve what was past, and  in the bitterness of regret for the error Cecilia had committed Cecilia thought  happiness unattainable for the remainder of Cecilia life. In this gloomy despondence passed the night, Cecilia eyes never closed, Cecilia  determination never formed. Morning, however, came, and upon something to fix  was indispensable. Cecilia now, therefore, finally employed Cecilia in briefly, comparing the good  with the evil of giving Mr Delvile wholly up, or becoming Mr Delvile for ever. In accepting Mr Delvile, Cecilia was exposed to all the displeasure of Mr Delvile relations, and,  which affected Cecilia most, to the indignant severity of Mr Delvile mother: but not  another obstacle could be found that seemed of any weight to oppose Mr Delvile. In refusing Mr Delvile Cecilia was liable to the derision of the world, to sneers from  strangers, and remonstrances from Cecilia friends, to becoming a topic for  ridicule, if not for slander, and an object of curiosity if not of contempt. The ills, therefore, that threatened Cecilia marriage, though most afflicting, were  least disgraceful, and those which awaited its breach, if less serious, were  more mortifying. At length, after weighing every circumstance as well as Cecilia perturbed spirits  would permit, Cecilia concluded that so late to reject him must bring misery  without any alleviation, while accepting him, though followed by wrath and  reproach, left some opening for future hope, and some prospect of better days. To fulfil, therefore, her engagement was Cecilia final resolution.  CECILIA      BOOK VIII. Continued.
