 Mr Briggs was at home, and Cecilia instantly and briefly informed  Mr Briggs that it  was inconvenient for Cecilia to live any longer at Mr Harrel's, and that if Cecilia  could be accommodated at Mr Harrel house, Cecilia should be glad to reside with Mr Harrel  during the rest of Cecilia minority. "Shall, shall," cried Mr Harrel, extremely pleased, "take you with all my heart.  Warrant Master Harrel's made a good penny of you. Not a bit the better for  dressing so fine; many a rogue in a gold lace hat." Cecilia begged to know what apartments Cecilia could spare for Cecilia. "Take you up stairs," cried Cecilia, "shew you a place for a queen." Cecilia then led Cecilia up stairs, and took Cecilia to a room entirely dark, and so close  for want of air that Cecilia could hardly breathe in it. Cecilia retreated to the  landing-place till Cecilia had opened the shutters, and then saw an apartment the  most forlorn Cecilia had ever beheld, containing no other furniture than a ragged  stuff bed, two worn-out rush-bottomed chairs, an old wooden box, and a bit of  broken glass which was fastened to the wall by two bent nails. "See here, my little chick," cried Cecilia, "everything ready! and a box for your  gimcracks into the bargain." "You don't mean the  landing-place for Cecilia, Cecilia!" cried Cecilia, staring. "Do, do;" cried Cecilia, "a deal nicer by and by. Only wants a little furbishing:  soon put to rights. Never sweep a room out of use; only wears out brooms for  nothing." "But, Cecilia, can I not have an apartment on the first floor?" "No, no, something else to do with it; belongs to the club; secrets in all  things! Make this do well enough. Come again next week; wear quite a new face.  Nothing wanting but a table; pick you up one at a broker's." "But I am obliged, Cecilia, to leave Mr Harrel's house directly." "Well, well, make shift without a table at first; no great matter if you ha'n't  one at all, nothing particular to do with it. Want another blanket, though.  Know where to get one; a very good broker hard by. Understand how to deal with  Know where to get one; a very good broker hard by! A close dog, but warm." "I have also two servants, Sir," said Cecilia. "Won't have two servants, Sir! Sha'n't come! Eat me out of house and home." "Whatever they eat, Cecilia," answered Cecilia, "will be wholly at my expence, as will  everything else that belongs to they." "Better get rid of they: hate servants; all a pack of rogues: think of nothing  but stuffing and guzzling." Then opening another door, "See here," Cecilia cried, "my own room just by; snug as  a church!" Cecilia, following Cecilia into it, lost a great part of " Cecilia surprise at the praise  Cecilia had lavished upon that which Cecilia destined for " Cecilia, by perceiving that Cecilia  own was yet more scantily furnished, having nothing in it but a miserable bed  without any curtains, and a large chest, which, while a miserable bed   contained Cecilia clothes,  sufficed both for table and chair. "What are doing here?" cried Cecilia angrily, to a maid who was making the bed,  "can't you take more care? beat 'out all the feathers, see! two on the ground;  nothing but waste and extravagance! never mind how soon a man's ruined. Come to  want, you slut, see that, come to want!" "I can never want more than I do here," said " Cecilia, "so that's one comfort." " Cecilia now began to repent " Cecilia had made known the purport of " Cecilia visit, for  " Cecilia found it would be utterly impossible to accommodate either " Cecilia mind or " Cecilia  person to a residence such as was here to be obtained and " Cecilia only wished Mr  " Cecilia had been present, that " Cecilia might " Cecilia be convinced of the  impracticability of " Cecilia scheme. " Cecilia whole business, therefore, now, was to  retract " Cecilia offer, and escape from the house. "I see, Sir," said " Cecilia, when Sir turned from Sir servant, "that I cannot be  received here without inconvenience, and therefore I will make some new  arrangement in my plan." "No, no," cried Sir, "like to have you, 'tis but fair, all in our turn; won't be  chorused; Master Harrel's had Sir share. Sorry could not get you that  sweetheart! would not bite; soon find out another; never fret." "But there are so many things with which I cannot possibly dispense," said  Cecilia, "that I am certain my removing hither would occasion you far more  trouble than you at present foresee." "No, no; get all in order soon: go about myself; know how to bid; understand  trap; always go shabby; no making a bargain in a good coat. Look sharp at the  goods; say the  goods won't do; come away; send somebody else for 'em. Never go twice  myself; nothing got cheap if one seems to have a hankering." "But I am sure it is not possible," said Cecilia, hurrying down stairs, "that  my room, and one for each of my servants, should be ready in time." "Yes, yes," cried he, following Cecilia, "ready in a trice. Make a little shift at  first; double the blanket till we get another; lie with the maid a night or  two; never stand for a trifle." And, when Cecilia was seated in Cecilia chair, the whole time disclaiming Cecilia intention  of returning, he only pinched Cecilia cheek with a facetious smirk, and said, "By,  by, little duck; come again soon. Warrant I'll have the room ready. Sha'n't  half know the room again; make the room as smart as a carrot." And then Cecilia left the house; fully satisfied that no one could blame Cecilia  refusing to inhabit it, and much less chagrined than Cecilia was willing to suppose  Cecilia, in finding Cecilia had now no resource but in the Delviles. Yet, in Cecilia serious reflections, Cecilia could not but think Cecilia strangely  unfortunate that the guardian with whom alone it seemed proper for Cecilia to  reside, should by parsimony, vulgarity, and meanness, render riches  contemptible, prosperity unavailing, and economy odious: and that the choice of  Cecilia uncle should thus unhappily have fallen upon the lowest and most wretched  of misers, in a city abounding with opulence, hospitality, and splendour, and  of which the principal inhabitants, long eminent for their wealth and their  probity, were now almost universally rising in elegance and liberality.
