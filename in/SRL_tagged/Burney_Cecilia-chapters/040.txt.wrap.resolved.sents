 The next day Cecilia, to drive Delvile a little from Cecilia thoughts, which Cecilia  now no longer wished him to occupy, again made a visit to Miss Belfield, whose  society afforded Cecilia more consolation than any other Cecilia could procure.
Cecilia found Cecilia employed in packing up, and preparing to remove to another  lodging, for Cecilia brother, Cecilia said, was so much better, that her brother did not think  it right to continue in so disgraceful a situation.
Cecilia talked with Cecilia accustomed openness of Cecilia affairs, and the interest which  Cecilia involuntarily took in them, contributed to lessen Cecilia vexation in  thinking of Cecilia own.
"The generous friend of her brother," said Cecilia, "who,  though but a new acquaintance to The generous friend of my brother, has courted The generous friend of my brother in all The generous friend of my brother sorrows, when  every body else forsook The generous friend of my brother, has brought The generous friend of my brother at last into a better way of  thinking.
The generous friend of my brother says there is a gentleman whose son is soon going abroad, who The generous friend of my brother  is almost sure will like her brother vastly, and in another week, The generous friend of my brother is to be  introduced to The generous friend of my brother.
And so, if my mother can but reconcile my mother to parting  with The generous friend of my brother, perhaps we may all do well again."
"my mother," said Cecilia, "when The generous friend of my brother is gone, will better know the value of  the blessing Cecilia has left in Cecilia daughter."
"O no, madam, no; Cecilia is wrapt up in The generous friend of my brother, and cares nothing for all the world  besides.
It was always so, and we have all of we been used to it.
But we have  had a sad scene since you were so kind as to come last; for when Cecilia told him  what you had done, him was almost out of him senses with anger that we had  acquainted you with him distress, and him said it was publishing him misery, and  undoing whatever him friend or him could do, for it was making him ashamed  to appear in the world, even when him affairs might be better.
But I told him  again and again that you had as much sweetness as goodness, and instead of  hurting him reputation, would do him nothing but credit."
"I am sorry," said Cecilia, "Mrs Belfield mentioned the circumstance at all; it  would have been better, for many reasons, that Mrs Belfield should not have heard of it."
"Cecilia hoped it would please Mrs Belfield," answered "Mrs Belfield, "however, Mrs Belfield made us  both promise us would take no such step in future, for Mrs Belfield said us were not  reduced to so much indigence, whatever Mrs Belfield was: and that as to us accepting  money from other people, that us might save up us own for Mrs Belfield, it would be  answering no purpose, for Mrs Belfield should think Mrs Belfield a monster to make use of himself a monster."
"And what said your mother?"
"Why your mother gave Mrs Belfield a great many promises that your mother would never vex Mrs Belfield about it  again; and indeed, much as I know us are obliged to you, madam, and gratefully  as I am sure I would lay down my life to serve you, I am very glad in this case  that my brother has found this case   out.
For though I so much wish my brother to do something  for my brother, and not to be so proud, and live in a manner my brother has no right to  do, I think, for all that, that it is a great disgrace to my' poor father's  honest memory, to have us turn beggars after my brother death, when my brother left us all so  well provided for, if us had but known how to be satisfied."
"There is a natural rectitude in your heart," said Cecilia, "that the ablest  casuists could not mend."
Cecilia then enquired whither they were removing, and Miss Belfield told Cecilia to  Portland Street, Oxford Road, where they were to have two apartments up two  pair of stairs, and the use of a very good parlour, in which Cecilia might  see my brother friends.
"And this," added Cecilia, "is a luxury for which nobody can blame  him, because if him has not the appearance of a decent home, no gentleman will  employ him."
The Padington house, Cecilia said, was already let, and Cecilia mother was determined  not to hire another, but still to live as penuriously as possible, in order,  notwithstanding his remonstrances, to save all Cecilia could of Cecilia income for Cecilia  son.
Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs Belfield, who very  familiarly said Cecilia came to tell Cecilia they were all in the wrong box in  letting her  son know of the £10 bank note, "for," continued Cecilia, "her  son has a  pride that would grace a duke, and her  son thinks nothing of her  son hardships, so long  as nobody knows of they.
So another time we must manage things better, and when  we do her  son any good, not let her  son know a word of the matter.
we'll settle it all  among we, and one day or other her  son'll be glad enough to thank we."
Cecilia, who saw Miss Belfield colour with shame at the freedom of this hint,  now arose to depart: but Miss Belfield begged Miss Belfield not to go so soon, and pressed  Miss Belfield with such urgency to again sit down, that Miss Belfield was obliged to comply.
Miss Belfield then began a warm commendation of Miss Belfield son, lavishly praising all his good  qualities, and exalting even his defects, concluding with saying "But, ma'am,  for all his's such a complete gentleman, and for all his's made so much of, his  was so diffident, I could not get his to call and thank you for the present you  made his, though, when his went his last airing, I almost knelt to his to do his last airing.
But, with all his merit, his wants as much encouragement as a lady, for I can  tell you it is not a little will do for his."
Cecilia, amazed at this extraordinary speech, looked from the mother to the  daughter in order to discover this extraordinary speech meaning, which, however, was soon rendered  plainer by what followed.
"But pray now, ma'am, don't think his the more ungrateful for his shyness, for  young ladies so high in the world as you are, must go pretty good lengths  before a young man will get courage to speak to  young ladies so high in the world as you are.
And though I have told my  son over and over that the ladies never like a man the worse for being a little  bold, my  son's so much down in the mouth that it has no effect upon my  son.
But it all  comes of my  son being brought up at the University, for that makes my  son think my  son  knows better than I can tell my  son.
And so, to be sure, my  son does.
However, for all  that, it is a hard thing upon a mother to find all a mother says goes just for  nothing.
But I hope you'll excuse my  son, ma'am, for it's nothing in the world but  my  son over-modesty."
Cecilia now stared with a look of so much astonishment and displeasure, that  Mrs Belfield, suspecting Cecilia had gone rather too far, added "I beg you won't  take what I've said amiss, ma'am, for we mothers of families are more used to  speak out than maiden ladies.
And I should not have said so much, but only I  was afraid you would misconstrue my son's backwardness, and so that my son might be  flung out of your favour at last, and all for nothing but having too much  respect for you."
"O dear mother!"
cried Miss Belfield, whose face was the colour of scarlet,  "pray!
"— "What's the matter now?"
cried Mrs Belfield; "you are as shy as your brother;  and if we are all to be so, when are we to come to an understanding?"
"Not immediately, I believe indeed," said Cecilia, rising, "but that we may not  plunge deeper in we mistakes, I will for the present take my leave."
"No, ma'am," cried Mrs Belfield, stopping Mrs Belfield, "pray don't go yet, for I've got  a great many things I want to talk to Mrs Belfield about.
In the first place, ma'am,  pray what is your opinion of this scheme for sending my son abroad into foreign  parts?
I don't know what you may think of it, but as to my son, it half drives me  out of my senses to have my son taken away from my son at last in that unnatural  manner.
And I'm sure, ma'am, if you would only put in a word against it, I dare  say my son would give it up without a demur."
"Me?"
cried Cecilia, disengaging Cecilia from Cecilia hold, "No, madam, you must  apply to those friends who better understand my son affairs, and who would have a  deeper interest in detaining my son."
"Lack a day!"
cried Miss Belfield, with scarcely smothered vexation, "how hard  it is to make these grand young ladies come to reason!
As to my son's other  friends, what good will it do for my son to mind what these grand young ladies say?
who can expect my son  to give up my son journey, without knowing what amends my son shall get for it?"
"You must settle this matter with my son at your leisure," said Cecilia, "I cannot  now stay another moment."
Miss Belfield, again finding Miss Belfield had been too precipitate, tried to draw back,  saying "Pray, ma'am, don't let what I have mentioned go against my son in your  good opinion, for my son knows no more of it than the furthest person in the world,  as my daughter can testify for as to shyness, my son's just as shy as a lady  my son; so what good my son ever got at the University, as to the matter of making  my son fortune, it's what I never could discover.
However, I dare say my son knows  best; though when all comes to all, if I was to speak my mind, I think my son's  made but a poor hand of it."
Cecilia, who only through compassion to the blushing Henrietta forbore  repressing this forwardness more seriously, merely answered Miss Belfield by  wishing Miss Belfield good morning: but, while Miss Belfield was taking a kinder leave of Miss Belfield timid  daughter, the mother added "As to the present, ma'am, you was so kind to make  us, Henny can witness for Henny every penny of it shall go to my son."
"I rather meant it," said Cecilia, "for my daughter; but if it is of use to  any body, my purpose is sufficiently answered."
Miss Belfield again pressed Miss Belfield to sit down, but Miss Belfield would not again listen to  Miss Belfield, coldly saying "I am sorry you troubled Miss Belfield with any mention of  what passed between Miss Belfield sister and me, but should you speak of it again, I beg  you will explain to Miss Belfield that Miss Belfield had no concern in that little transaction,  which belonged wholly to ourselves."
Miss Belfield then hastened down stairs, followed, however, by Miss Belfield, making  awkward excuses for what Miss Belfield had said, intermixed with frequent hints that Miss Belfield  knew all the time Miss Belfield was in the right.
This little incident, which convinced Miss Belfield was firmly persuaded  Miss Belfield was in love with my son, gave Miss Belfield much uneasiness; Miss Belfield feared my son might entertain the same notion, and thought the same notion most probable the  daughter also had imbibed the same notion, though but for the forward vulgarity of the  sanguine mother, their opinions might long have remained concealed.
Miss Belfield  benevolence towards their opinions, notwithstanding Her   purity, must now therefore cease  to be exerted: nor could Miss Belfield even visit Miss Belfield, since prudence, and a  regard for Miss Belfield own character, seemed immediately to prohibit all commerce with  the family.
"And thus difficult," cried Miss Belfield, "is the blameless use of riches, though: all  who want all  who want them, think nothing so easy as all  who want them disposal!
the family so  much wished to serve, I may at last only have injured, since the disappointment  of the family higher expectations, may render all smaller benefits contemptible.
And  thus this unfortunate misconstruction of my good offices, robs the family of a useful  assistant, and deprives me at the same time of an amiable companion."
As soon as an amiable companion returned home, an amiable companion had a letter put into an amiable companion hand which came  from Mr Marriot, whose servant had twice called for an answer in the short time  an amiable companion had been absent.
a letter put into her hand which came  from Mr Marriot, whose servant had twice called for an answer in the short time   contained a most passionate avowal of the impression an amiable companion had made  on whose servant heart the preceding evening, and an angry complaint that Mr Harrel had  refused to hear Mr Harrel proposals.
Mr Harrel entreated an amiable companion permission to wait upon an amiable companion for  only five minutes, and concluded with the most fervent professions of respect  and admiration.
The precipitancy of this declaration served merely to confirm the opinion an amiable companion  had already conceived of the weakness of Mr Harrel understanding: but the obstinacy  of Mr Harrel irritated and distressed an amiable companion, though weary of expostulating with  so hopeless a subject, whom neither reason nor gratitude could turn from Mr Harrel  own purposes, an amiable companion was obliged to submit to Mr Harrel management, and was well  content, in the present instance, to affirm Mr Harrel decree.
an amiable companion therefore wrote a  concise answer to an amiable companion new admirer, in the usual form of civil rejection.
