 Mrs Mears, whose character was of that common sort which renders delineation  superfluous, received  Mrs Mears, whose character was of that common sort which renders delineation  superfluous with the customary forms of good breeding. Mrs Harrel soon engaged Mrs Harrel at a card-table; and Cecilia, who declined  playing, was seated next to Miss Leeson, who arose to return the courtesy Mrs Harrelmade in advancing to Mrs Harrel, but that past, did not again even look at Mrs Harrel. Cecilia, though fond of conversation and formed for society, was too diffident  to attempt speaking where so little encouraged; Cecilia, though fond of conversation and formed for society, therefore, continued  silent, till Sir Robert Floyer, Mr Harrel, and Mr Arnott entered the room  together, and all at the same time advanced to Cecilia. "What," cried Mrs Harrel, "don't you chuse to play, Miss Beverley?" "I flatter Mrs Harrel," cried Mr Arnott, "that Miss Beverley never plays at all,  for then, in one thing, I shall have the honour to resemble Miss Beverley." "Very seldom, indeed," answered Cecilia, "and consequently very ill." "O, you must take a few lessons," said Mrs Harrel, "Sir Robert Floyer, I am  sure, will be proud to instruct you." Sir Robert, who had placed himself opposite to Miss Beverley, and was staring full in Miss Beverley  face, made a slight inclination of himself head, and said, "Certainly." "I should be a very unpromising pupil," returned Cecilia, "for I fear I should  not only want diligence to improve, but desire." "Oh, you will learn better things," said Mrs Harrel; "we have had you yet but  three days amongst us,—in three months we shall see the difference." "I hope not," cried Mr Arnott, "I earnestly hope there will be none!" Mrs Harrel now joined another party; and Mr Arnott seeing no seat vacant near  that of Cecilia, moved round to the back of Cecilia chair, where Mrs Harrel patiently stood  for the rest of the evening. But Sir Robert still kept Sir Robert post, and still,  without troubling Sir Robert to speak, kept Sir Robert eyes fixed upon the same object. Cecilia, offended by Sir Robert boldness, looked a thousand ways to avoid Sir Robert; but Cecilia  embarrassment, by giving greater play to Cecilia features, served only to keep  awake an attention which might otherwise have wearied. Cecilia was almost tempted  to move Cecilia chair round and face Mr Arnott seeing no seat vacant near  that of Cecilia, but though Cecilia wished to shew Cecilia  disapprobation of the Baronet, Cecilia had not yet been reconciled by fashion to  turning Cecilia back upon the company at large, for the indulgence of conversing  with some particular person: a fashion which to unaccustomed observers seems  rude and repulsive, but which, when once adopted, carries with it imperceptibly  it own recommendation, in the ease, convenience and freedom it promotes. Thus disagreeably stationed, Cecilia found but little assistance from the  neighbourhood of Mr Arnott seeing no seat vacant near  that of Cecilia, since even Mr Arnott seeing no seat vacant near  that of Cecilia own desire of conversing with Cecilia,  was swallowed up by an anxious and involuntary impulse to watch the looks and  motions of Sir Robert. At length, quite tired of sitting as if merely an object to be gazed at, Cecilia  determined to attempt entering into conversation with Miss Leeson. The difficulty, however, was not inconsiderable how to make the attack; Cecilia was  unacquainted with Cecilia friends and connections, uninformed of Cecilia way of  thinking, or Cecilia way of life, ignorant even of the sound of Cecilia voice, and  chilled by the coldness of Cecilia aspect: yet, having no other alternative, Cecilia  was more willing to encounter the forbidding looks of this lady, than to  continue silently abashed under the scrutinizing eyes of Sir Robert. After much deliberation with what subject to begin, Cecilia remembered that Miss  Larolles had been present the first time they had met, and thought it probable  they might be acquainted with each other; and therefore, bending forward, Cecilia  ventured to enquire if Cecilia had lately seen that this lady? Miss Leeson, in a voice alike inexpressive of satisfaction or displeasure,  quietly answered, "No, ma'am." Cecilia, discouraged by this conciseness, was a few minutes silent; but the  perseverance of Sir Robert in staring at Cecilia, exciting Cecilia own in trying to  avoid Sir Robert eyes, Cecilia exerted Cecilia so far as to add, "Does Mrs Mears expect  Miss Larolles here this evening?" Miss Leeson, without raising Miss Leeson head, gravely replied, "I don't know, ma'am." All was now to be done over again, and a new subject to be started, for Cecilia  could suggest nothing further to ask concerning Miss  Larolles. Cecilia had seen, little of life, but that little Cecilia had well marked, and Cecilia  observation had taught Cecilia, that among fashionable people, public places seemed  a never-failing source of conversation and entertainment: upon this topic,  therefore, Cecilia hoped for better success; and as to those who have spent more  time in the country than in London, no place of amusement is so interesting as  a theatre, Cecilia opened the subject Cecilia had so happily suggested, by an enquiry  whether any new play had lately come out? Miss Leeson, with the same dryness, only answered, "Indeed, I can't tell." Another pause now followed, and the spirits of Cecilia were considerably dampt;  but happening accidentally to recollect the name of Almack, Cecilia presently  revived, and, congratulating Cecilia that Cecilia should now be able to speak of a  place too fashionable for disdain, Cecilia asked Cecilia, in a manner somewhat more  assured, if Cecilia was a subscriber to his assemblies? "Yes, ma'am." "Do you go to them constantly?" "No, ma'am." Again them were both silent. And now, tired of finding the ill-success of each  particular enquiry, Cecilia thought a more general one might obtain an answer less  laconic, and therefore begged Cecilia would inform Cecilia what was the most  fashionable place of diversion for the present season? This question, however, cost Miss Leeson no more trouble than any which had  preceded it, for Cecilia only replied, "Indeed I don't know." Cecilia now began to sicken of Cecilia attempt, and for some minutes to give her attempt up  as hopeless; but afterwards when Cecilia reflected how frivolous were the questions  Cecilia had asked, Cecilia felt more inclined to pardon the answers Cecilia had received,  and in a short time to fancy Cecilia had mistaken contempt for stupidity, and to  grow less angry with Miss Leeson than ashamed of Cecilia. This supposition excited Cecilia to make yet another trial of Cecilia talents for  conversation, and therefore, summoning all the courage in Cecilia power, Cecilia  modestly apologised for the liberty Cecilia was taking, and then begged Cecilia  permission to enquire whether there was anything new in the literary way that  Cecilia thought worth recommending? Miss Leeson now turned Cecilia eyes towards Cecilia, with a look that implied a doubt  whether Cecilia had heard right; and when the attentive attitude of Cecilia  confirmed Cecilia   question, surprise for a few instants took place of  insensibility, and with rather more spirit than Cecilia had yet shown, Cecilia  answered, "Indeed, I know nothing of the matter." Cecilia   was now utterly disconcerted; and half angry with Cecilia  , and wholly  provoked with Cecilia   sullen neighbour, Cecilia   resolved to let nothing in future  provoke Cecilia   to a similar trial with so unpromising a subject. Cecilia   had not, however, much longer to endure the examination of Sir Robert, who  being pretty well satisfied with staring, turned upon his heel, and was  striding out of the room, when his was stopt by Mr Gosport, who for some time  had been watching his. Mr Gosport was a man of good parts, and keen satire: minute in Mr Gosport  observations, and ironical in Mr Gosport expressions. "So you don't play, Sir Robert?" Sir Robert cried. "What, here? No, I am going to Brookes's." "But how do you like Harrel's ward? You have taken a pretty good survey of Harrel's ward." "Why, faith, I don't know; but not much, I think; Harrel's ward's a devilish fine woman,  too; but Harrel's ward has no spirit, no life." "Did you try Harrel's ward? Have you talked to Harrel's ward?" "Not I, truly!" "Nay, then how do you mean to judge of Harrel's ward?" "O, faith, that's all over, now; one never thinks of talking to the women by  way of trying the women." "What other method, then, have you adopted?" "None." "None? Why, then, how do you go on?" "Why, they talk to us. the women take all that trouble upon the women now." "And pray how long may you have commenced fade macaroni? For this is a part of  your character with which I was not acquainted." "Oh, hang it, 'tis not from ton; no, it's merely from laziness. Who the d—-l  will fatigue your character with which I was not acquainted with dancing attendance upon the women, when keeping the women  at a distance makes the women dance attendance upon us?" Then stalking from your character with which I was not acquainted to Mr Harrel, your character with which I was not acquainted took your character with which I was not acquainted by the arm, and they left the  room together. Mr Gosport now advanced to Cecilia, and addressing Cecilia so as not to be heard by  Miss Leeson, said, "I have been wishing to approach you, some time, but the  fear that you are already overpowered by the loquacity of your fair neighbour  makes me cautious of attempting to engage you." "You mean," said Cecilia, "to laugh at the loquacity of your fair neighbour  , and indeed the loquacity of your fair neighbour   ill success  has rendered its ill success   sufficiently ridiculous." "Are you, then, yet to learn," cried your character with which I was not acquainted, "that there are certain young ladies  who make it a rule never to speak but to their own cronies? Of this class is  Miss Leeson, and till you get into Miss Leeson particular coterie, you must never  expect to hear from Miss Leeson a word of two syllables. The TON misses, as they are  called, who now infest the town, are in two divisions, the SUPERCILIOUS, and  the VOLUBLE. The SUPERCILIOUS, like Miss Leeson, are silent, scornful, languid,  and affected, and disdain all converse but with those of all converse own set: the  VOLUBLE, like Miss  Larolles, are flirting, communicative, restless, and  familiar, and attack without the smallest ceremony, every one they think worthy  they notice. But this they have in common, that at home they think of nothing  but dress, abroad, of nothing but admiration, and that every where they hold in  supreme contempt all but they." "Probably, then," said Cecilia, "I have passed tonight, for one of the  VOLUBLES; however, all the advantage has been with the SUPERCILIOUS, for I have  suffered a total repulse." "Are you sure, however, you have not talked too well for Cecilia?" "O, a child of five years old ought to have been whipt for not talking better!" "But it is not capacity alone you are to consult when you talk with misses of  the TON; were their understandings only to be considered, their would indeed be  wonderfully easy of access! in order, therefore, to render their commerce  somewhat difficult, their will only be pleased by an observance of their  humours: which are ever most various and most exuberant where the intellects  are weakest and least cultivated. I have, however, a receipt which I have found  infallible for engaging the attention of young ladies of whatsoever character  or denomination." "O, then," cried Cecilia, "pray favour me with it, for I have here an admirable  opportunity to try it efficacy." "I will give it you," he answered, "with full directions. When you meet with a  young lady who seems resolutely determined not to speak, or who, if compelled  by a direct question to make some answer, drily gives a brief affirmative, or  coldly a laconic negative—-" "A case in point," interrupted Cecilia. "Well, thus circumstanced," he continued, "the remedy I have to propose  consists of three topics of discourse." "Pray what are they?" "Dress, public places, and love." Cecilia, half surprised and half diverted, waited a fuller explanation without  giving any interruption. "These three topics," he continued, "are to answer three purposes, since there  are no less than three causes from which the silence of young ladies may  proceed: sorrow, affectation, and stupidity." "Do you, then," cried Cecilia  , "give nothing at all to modesty?" "I give much to it," he answered, "as an excuse, nay almost as an equivalent  for wit; but for that sullen silence which resists all encouragement, modesty  is a mere pretence, not a cause." "You must, however, be somewhat more explicit, if you mean that I should  benefit from your instructions." "Well, then," he answered, "I will briefly enumerate the three causes, with  directions for the three methods of cure. To begin with sorrow. The taciturnity  which really results from that is attended with an incurable absence of mind,  and a total unconsciousness of the observation which it excites; upon this  occasion, public places may sometimes be tried in vain, and even dress may  fail; but love—" "Are you sure, then," said Cecilia  , with a laugh, "that sorrow has but that one  source?" "By no means," answered he, "for perhaps papa may have been angry, or mama may  have been cross; a milliner may have sent a wrong pompoon, or a chaperon to an  assembly may have been taken ill—" "Bitter subjects of affliction, indeed! And are these all you allow us?" "Nay, I speak but of young ladies of fashion, and what of greater importance  can befall young ladies of fashion? If, therefore, the grief of the fair patient proceeds from  papa, mama, or the chaperon, then the mention of public places, those endless  incentives of displeasure between the old and the young, will draw forth her  complaints, and her complaints will bring her complaints own cure, for those who lament  find speedy consolation: if the milliner has occasioned the calamity, the  discussion of dress will have the same effect; should both her complaintsfail, love, as I said before, will be found infallible, for you will then have  investigated every subject of uneasiness which a youthful female in high life  can experience." "her complaints are greatly obliged to you," cried Cecilia  , bowing, "for granting her complaints  motives of sorrow so honourable, and I thank you in the name of the whole sex." "You, madam," said he, returning her bow, "are I hope an exception in the  happiest way, that of having no sorrow at all. I come, now, to the silence of  affectation, which is presently discernible by the roving of the eye round the  room to see if it is heeded, by the sedulous care to avoid an accidental smile,  and by the variety of disconsolate attitudes exhibited to the beholders. This  species of silence has almost without exception This  species of silence origin in that babyish  vanity which is always gratified by exciting attention, without ever perceiving  that it provokes contempt. In these cases, as nature is wholly out of the  question, and the mind is guarded against the mind own feelings, dress and public  places are almost certain of failing, but here again love is sure to vanquish;  as soon as the mind is named, attention becomes involuntary, and in a short time a  struggling simper discomposes the arrangement of the features, and then the  business is presently over, for the young lady is either supporting some  system, or opposing some proposition, before the young lady is well aware that the young lady has  been cheated out of the young lady sad silence at all." "So much," said Cecilia  , "for sorrow and for affectation. Proceed next to  stupidity; for that, in all probability, I shall most frequently encounter." "That always must be heavy work," returned he, "yet the road is plain, though  the road is all up hill. Love, here, may be talked of without exciting any emotion,  or provoking any reply, and dress may be dilated upon without producing any  other effect than that of attracting a vacant stare; but public places are  indubitably certain of success. Dull and heavy characters, incapable of  animating from wit or from reason, because unable to keep pace with them, and  void of all internal sources of entertainment, require the stimulation of shew,  glare, noise, and bustle, to interest or awaken them. Talk to them of such  subjects, and them adore you; no matter whether you paint to them joy or  horror, let there but be action, and them are content; a battle has charms for  them equal to a coronation, and a funeral amuses them as much as a wedding." "I am much obliged to you," said Cecilia  , smiling, "for these instructions; yet  I must confess I know not how upon the present occasion to make use of you paint to them joy or  horror:  public places I have already tried, but tried in vain; dress I dare not  mention, as I have not yet learned its technical terms—" "Well, but," interrupted he, "be not desperate; you have yet the third topic  unessayed." "O, that," returned she, laughing, "I leave to you." "Pardon me," cried he; "love is a source of loquacity only with yourselves:  when love is started by men, young ladies dwindle into mere listeners. Simpering  listeners, I confess; but Simpering   is only with one another that you will discuss Simpering    merits." At this time they were interrupted by the approach of Miss Larolles, who,  tripping towards Cecilia, exclaimed, "Lord, how glad I am to see you! So you  would not go to the auction! Well, you had a prodigious loss, I assure you. All  the wardrobe was sold, and all Lady Belgrade's trinkets. I never saw such a  collection of sweet things in my life. I was ready to cry that I could not bid  for half a hundred of them. I declare I was kept in an agony the whole morning.  I would not but have been there for the world. Poor Lady Belgrade! you really  can't conceive how I was shocked for Poor Lady Belgrade. All Poor Lady Belgrade beautiful things sold for  almost nothing. I assure you, if you had seen how they went, you would have  lost all patience. It's a thousand pities you were not there." "On the contrary," said Cecilia, "I think I had a very fortunate escape, for  the loss of patience without the acquisition of all Lady Belgrade's trinkets, would have been  rather mortifying." "Yes," said Mr Gosport; "but when you have lived some time longer in this  commercial city, you will find the exchange of patience for mortification the  most common and constant traffic amongst this  commercial city inhabitants." "Pray, have you been here long?" cried Miss  Larolles, "for I have been to  twenty places, wondering I did not meet with you before. But whereabouts is Mrs  Mears? O, I see Mrs  Mears now; I'm sure there's no mistaking Mrs  Mears; I could know Mrs  Mears by  that old red gown half a mile off. Did you ever see such a frightful thing in  your life? And it's never off Mrs  Mears back. I believe Mrs  Mears sleeps in it. I am sure I  have seen Mrs  Mears in nothing else all winter. It quite tires one's eye. Mrs  Mears's a  monstrous shocking dresser. But do you know I have met with the most provoking  thing in the world this evening? I declare it has made me quite sick. I was  never in such a passion in my life. You can conceive nothing like it." "Like what?" cried Cecilia, laughing; "your passion, or your provocation?" "Why, I'll tell you what it was, and then you shall judge if it was not quite  past endurance. You must know I commissioned a particular friend of mine, Miss  Moffat, to buy me a trimming when Miss   went to Paris; well, Miss   sent it me over  about a month ago by Mr Meadows, and it's the sweetest thing you ever saw in  your life; but I would not make it up, because there was not a creature in  town, so I thought to bring it out quite new in about a week's time, for you  know any thing does till after Christmas. Well, to-night at Lady Jane Dranet's,  who should I meet but Miss Moffat! Miss   had been in town some days, but so  monstrously engaged I could never find Miss   at home. Well, I was quite delighted  to see Miss  , for you must know Miss  's a prodigious favourite with me, so I ran up  to Miss   in a great hurry to shake hands, and what do you think was the first  thing that struck my eyes? Why, just such a trimming as my own, upon a nasty,  odious gown, and half dirty! Can you conceive anything so distressing? I could  have cried with pleasure." "Why so?" said Cecilia  . "If Miss   trimming is dirty, yours will look the more  delicate." "O Lord! but it's making it seem quite an old thing! Half the town will get  something like Half the town. And I quite ruined me to buy Half the town. I declare, I don't  think anything was ever half so mortifying. It distressed me so, I could hardly  speak to Miss  . If Miss   had stayed a month or two longer, I should not have minded  It, but It was the cruellest thing in the world to come over just now. I wish  the Custom-house officers had kept all Miss   cloaths till summer." "The wish is tender, indeed," said Cecilia  , "for a particular friend." Mrs Mears now rising from the card-table, Miss Larolles tript away to pay her  compliments to her. "Here, at least," cried Cecilia  , "no receipt seems requisite for the cure of  silence! I would have Miss  Larolles be the constant companion of Miss Leeson:  they could not but agree admirably, since that SUPERCILIOUS young lady seems  determined never to speak, and the VOLUBLE Miss Miss  Larolles never to be silent.  Were each to borrow something of the other, how greatly would both be the  better!" "The composition would still be a sorry one," answered Mr Gosport, "for I  believe they are equally weak, and equally ignorant; the only difference is,  that one, though silly, is quick, the other, though deliberate, is stupid. Upon  a short acquaintance, that heaviness which leaves to others the whole weight of  discourse, and whole search of entertainment, is the most fatiguing, but, upon  a longer intimacy, even that is less irksome and less offensive, than the  flippancy which hears nothing but Upon  ." Mrs Harrel arose now to depart, and Cecilia, not more tired of the beginning of  the evening than entertained with Mrs Harrel conclusion, was handed to the carriage by  Mr Arnott.
