 Mean while Cecilia went through very severe discipline, sometimes strongly  opposing it, at other times scarce sensible what was done to her. The whole of the next day passed in much the same manner, neither did the next  night bring any visible alteration. She had now nurses and attendants even more  than sufficient, for Delvile had no relief but from calling in more help. His  terror of again seeing her encreased with his forbearance; the interview which  had already past had almost torn him asunder, and losing all courage for  attempting to enter her room, he now spent almost all his time upon the stairs  which led to it. Whenever she was still, he seated himself at her chamber door,  where, if he could hear her breathe or move, a sudden hope of her recovery gave  to him a momentary extasy that recompensed all his sufferings. But the instant  she spoke, unable to bear the sound of so loved a voice uttering nothing but  the incoherent ravings of lightheadedness, he hastened down stairs, and flying  out of the house, walked in the neighbouring streets, till he could again  gather courage to enquire or to listen how she went on. The following morning, however, Dr Lyster came, and every hope revived. He flew  to embrace him, told him instantly his marriage with Cecilia, and besought him  by some superior effort of his extraordinary abilities to save him the  distraction of her loss. "My good friend," cried the worthy Doctor, "what is this you ask of me? and how  can this poor young lady herself want advice more than you do? Do you think  these able physicians actually upon the spot, with all the experience of full  practice in London to assist their skill, want a petty Doctor out of the  country to come and teach them what is right?" "I have more reliance upon you," cried Delvile, than upon the whole faculty;  come, therefore, and prescribe for her,—take some new course "— "Impossible, my good Sir, impossible! I must not lose my wits from vanity,  because you have lost yours from affliction. I could not refuse to come to you  when you wrote to me with such urgency, and I will now go and see the young  lady, as a friend, with all my heart. I am sorry for you at my soul, Mr  Mortimer! She is a lovely young creature, and has an understanding, for her  years and sex, unequalled." "Never mention her to me!" cried the impatient Delvile, "I cannot bear it! Go  up to her, dear Doctor, and if you want a consultation, send, if you please,  for every physician in town." Dr Lyster desired only that those who had already attended might be summoned;  and then, giving up to his entreaties the accustomed ceremonial of waiting for  them, he went to Cecilia. Delvile did not dare accompany him; and so well was he acquainted with his  plainness and sincerity, that though he expected his return with eagerness, he  no sooner heard him upon the stairs, than fearing to know his opinion, he  hastily snatched up his hat, and rushed vehemently out of the house to avoid  him. He continued to walk about the streets, till even the dread of ill news was  less horrible to him than this voluntary suspense, and then he returned to the  house. He found Dr Lyster in a small back parlour, which Mrs Wyers, finding she should  now be well paid, had appropriated for Delvile's use. Delvile, putting his hand upon the Doctor's shoulder, said, "Well, my dear Dr  Lyster, you, still, I hope"— "I would I could make you easy!" interrupted the Doctor; "yet, if you are  rational, one comfort, at all events, I can give you; the crisis seems  approaching, and either she will recover, or before to-morrow morning"—- "Don't go on, Sir!" cried Delvile, with mingled rage and horror, "I will not  have her days limited! I sent not for you to give me such an account!" And again he flew out of the house, leaving Dr Lyster unaffectedly concerned  for him, and too kind-hearted and too wise to be offended at the injustice of  immoderate sorrow. In a few minutes, however, from the effect rather of despair than philosophy,  Delvile grew more composed, and waited upon Dr Lyster to apologize for his  behaviour. He received his hearty forgiveness, and prevailed upon him to  continue in town till the whole was decided. About noon, Cecilia, from the wildest rambling and most perpetual agitation,  sunk suddenly into a state of such utter insensibility, that she appeared  unconscious even of her existence; and but that she breathed, she might already  have passed for being dead. When Delvile heard this, he could no longer endure even his post upon the  stairs; he spent his whole time in wandering about the streets, or stopping in  Dr Lyster's parlour to enquire if all was over. That humane physician, not more alarmed at the danger of Cecilia, than grieved  at the situation of Delvile, thought the present fearful crisis at least  offered an opportunity of reconciling him with his father. He waited,  therefore, upon that gentleman in St James's-square, and openly informed him of  the dangerous state of Cecilia, and the misery of his son. Mr Delvile, though he would gladly, to have annulled an alliance he held  disgraceful to his family, have received intelligence that Cecilia was no more,  was yet extremely disconcerted to hear of sufferings to which his own refusal  of an asylum he was conscious had largely contributed; and after a haughty  struggle between tenderness and wrath, he begged the advice of Dr Lyster how  his son might be drawn from such a scene. Dr Lyster, who well knew Delvile was too desperate to be tractable, proposed  surprising him into an interview by their returning together: Mr Delvile,  however apprehensive and relenting, conceded most unwillingly to a measure he  held beneath him, and, when he came to the shop, could scarce be persuaded to  enter it. Mortimer, at that time, was taking a solitary ramble; and Dr Lyster,  to complete the work he had begun of subduing the hard pride of his father,  contrived, under pretence of waiting for him, to conduct him to the room of the  invalide. Mr Delvile, who knew not whither he was going, at first sight of the bed and  the attendants, was hastily retreating; but the changed and livid face of  Cecilia caught his eye, and, struck with sudden consternation, he involuntarily  stopt. "Look at the poor young lady!" cried Dr Lyster; "can you wonder a sight such as  this should make Mr Mortimer forget every thing else?" She was wholly insensible, but perfectly quiet; she seemed to distinguish  nothing, and neither spoke nor moved. Mr Delvile regarded her with the utmost horror: the refuge he so implacably  refused her on the night when her intellects were disordered, he would now  gladly have offered at the expence of almost similar sufferings, to have  relieved himself from those rising pangs which called him author of this scene  of woe. His pride, his pomp, his ancient name, were now sunk in his estimation;  and while he considered himself the destroyer of this unhappy young creature,  he would have sacrificed them all to have called himself her protector. Little  is the boast of insolence when it is analysed by the conscience! bitter is the  agony of self-reproach, where misery follows hardness of heart! yet, when the  first painful astonishment from her situation abated, the remorse she excited  being far stronger than the pity, he gave an angry glance at Dr Lyster for  betraying him into such a sight, and hastily left the room. Delvile, who was now impatiently waiting to see Dr Lyster in the little  parlour, alarmed at the sound of a new step upon the stairs, came out to  enquire who had been admitted. When he saw his father, he shrunk back; but Mr  Delvile, no longer supported by pride, and unable to recover from the shock he  had just received, caught him in his arms, and said "Oh come home to me, my  son! this is a place to destroy you!" "Ah, Sir," cried Delvile, "think not of me now!—you must shew me no kindness;  I am not in a state to bear it!" And, forcibly breaking from him, he hurried  out of the house. Mr Delvile, all the father awakened in his bosom, saw his departure with more  dread than anger; and returned himself to St James's-square, tortured with  parental fears, and stung by personal remorse, lamenting his own inflexibility,  and pursued by the pale image of Cecilia. She was still in this unconscious state, and apparently as free from suffering  as from enjoyment, when a new voice was suddenly heard without, exclaiming, "Oh  where is she? where is she? where is my dear Miss Beverley?" and Henrietta  Belfield ran wildly into the room. The advertisement in the news-papers had at once brought her to town, and  directed her to the house: the mention that the lost lady talked much of a  person by the name of Delvile, struck her instantly to mean Cecilia; the  description corresponded with this idea, and the account of the dress confirmed  it: Mr Arnott, equally terrified with herself, had therefore lent her his  chaise to learn the truth of this conjecture, and she had travelled all night. Flying up to the bedside, "Who is this?" she cried, "this is not Miss  Beverley?" and then screaming with unrestrained horror, "Oh mercy! mercy!" she  called out, "yes, it is indeed! and nobody would know her!—her own mother  would not think her her child!" "You must come away, Miss Belfield," said Mary, "you must indeed,—the doctors  all say my lady must not be disturbed." "Who shall take me away?" cried she, angrily, "nobody Mary! not all the doctors  in the world! Oh sweet Miss Beverley! I will lie down by your side,—I will  never quit you while you live,—and I wish, I wish I could die to save your  precious life!" Then, leaning over her, and wringing her hands, "Oh I shall break my heart,"  she cried, "to see her in this condition! Is this the so happy Miss Beverley,  that I thought every body born to give joy to? the Miss Beverley that seemed  queen of the whole world! yet so good and so gentle, so kind to the meanest  person! excusing every body's faults but her own, and telling them how they  might mend, and trying to make them as good as herself!—Oh who would know  her! who would know her! what have they done to you, my beloved Miss Beverley?  how have they altered and disfigured you in this wicked and barbarous manner?" In the midst of this simple yet pathetic testimony, to the worth and various  excellencies of Cecilia, Dr Lyster came into the room. The women all flocked  around him, except Mary, to vindicate themselves from any share in permitting  this new comer's entrance and behaviour; but Mary only told him who she was,  and said, that if her lady was well enough to know her, there was nobody she  was certain she would have been so glad to see. "Young lady," said the doctor, "I would advise you to walk into another room  till you are a little more composed." "Every body, I find, is for hurrying me away," cried the sobbing Henrietta,  whose honest heart swelled with its own affectionate integrity; "but they might  all save themselves the trouble, for go I will not!" "This is very wrong," said the doctor, "and must not be suffered: do you call  it friendship to come about a sick person in this manner?" "Oh my Miss Beverley!" cried Henrietta, "do you hear how they all upbraid me?  how they all want to force me away from you, and to hinder me even from looking  at you! Speak for me, sweet lady! speak for me yourself! tell them the poor  Henrietta will not do you any harm; tell them she only wishes just to sit by  you, and to see you!—I will hold by this dear hand,—I will cling to it till  the last minute; and you will not, I know you will not, give orders to have it  taken away from me!" Dr Lyster, though his own good nature was much affected by this fond sorrow,  now half angrily represented to her the impropriety of indulging it: but  Henrietta, unused to disguise or repress her feelings, grew only the more  violent, the more she was convinced of Cecilia's danger: "Oh look but at her,"  she exclaimed, "and take me from her if you can! see how her sweet eyes are  fixed! look but what a change in her complexion!—She does not see me, she  does not know me,—she does not hear me! her hand seems quite lifeless  already, her face is all fallen away!—Oh that I had died twenty deaths before  I had lived to see this sight!—poor wretched Henrietta, thou bast now no  friend left in the world! thou mayst go and lie down in some corner, and no one  will come and say to thee a word of comfort!" "This must not be!" said Dr Lyster, "you must take her away." "You shall not!" cried she, desperately, "I will stay with her till she has  breathed her last, and I will stay with her still longer! and if she was to  speak to you this moment, she would tell you that she chose it. She loved the  poor Henrietta, and loved to have her near her; and when she was ill, and in  much distress, she never once bid me leave her room. Is it not true, my sweet  Miss Beverley? do you not know it to be true? Oh look not so dreadfully! turn  to your unhappy Henrietta; sweetest, best of ladies! will you not speak to her  once more? will you not say to her one single word?" Dr Lyster now grew very angry, and telling her such violence might have fatal  consequences, frightened her into more order, and drew her away himself. He had  then the kindness to go with her into another room, where, when her first  vehemence was spent, his remonstrances and reasoning brought her to a sense of  the danger she might occasion, and made her promise not to return to the room  till she had gained strength to behave better. When Dr Lyster went again to Delvile, he found him greatly alarmed by his long  stay; he communicated to him briefly what had passed, and counselled him to  avoid encreasing his own grief by the sight of what was suffered by this  unguarded and ardent girl. Delvile readily assented, for the weight of his own  woe was too heavy to bear any addition. Henrietta now, kept in order by Dr Lyster, contented herself with only sitting  on the bed, without attempting to speak, and with no other employment than  alternately looking at her sick friend, and covering her streaming eyes with  her handkerchief; from time to time quitting the room wholly, for the relief of  sobbing at liberty and aloud in another. But, in the evening, while Delvile and Dr Lyster were taking one of their  melancholy rambles, a new scene was acted in the apartment of the still  senseless Cecilia. Albany suddenly made his entrance into it, accompanied by  three children, two girls and one boy, from the ages of four to six, neatly  dressed, clean, and healthy. "See here!"' cried he, as he came in, "see here what I've brought you! raise,  raise your languid head, and look this way! you think me rigid,—an enemy to  pleasure, austere, harsh, and a forbidder of joy: look at this sight, and see  the contrary! who shall bring you comfort, joy, pleasure, like this? three  innocent children, clothed and fed by your bounty!" Henrietta and Mary, who both knew him well, were but little surprised at  anything he said or did, and the nurses presumed not to interfere but by  whispers. Cecilia, however, observed nothing that passed; and Albany, somewhat  astonished, approached nearer to the bed; "Wilt thou not speak?" he cried. "She can't, Sir," said one of the women; "she has been speechless many hours." The air of triumph with which he had entered the room was now changed into  disappointment and consternation. For some minutes he thoughtfully and  sorrowfully contemplated her, and then, with a deep sigh, said, "How will the  poor rue this day!" Then, turning to the children, who, awed by this scene,  were quiet from terror. "Alas!" he said, "ye helpless babes, ye know not what  you have lost: presumptuously we came; unheeded we must return! I brought you  to be seen by your benefactress, but she is going where she will find many  such." He then led them away; but, suddenly coming back, "I may see her, perhaps, no  more! shall I not, then, pray for her? Great and aweful is the change she is  making; what are human revolutions, how pitiful, how insignificant, compared  with it!—Come, little babies, come; with gifts has she often blessed you,  with wishes bless her! Come, let us kneel round her bed; let us all pray for  her together; lift up your innocent hands, and for all of you I will speak." He then made the children obey his injunctions, and having knelt himself, while  Henrietta and Mary instantly did the same, "Sweet flower!" he cried, "untimely  cropt in years, yet in excellence mature! early decayed in misery, yet fragrant  in innocence! Gentle be thy exit, for unsullied have been thy days; brief be  thy pains, for few have been thy offences! Look at her sweet babes, and bear  her in your remembrance; often will I visit you and revive the solemn scene.  Look at her ye, also, who are nearer to your end—Ah! will you bear it like  her!" He paused; and the nurses and Mrs Wyers, struck by this call, and moved by the  general example, crept to the bed, and dropt on their knees, almost  involuntarily. "She departs," resumed Albany, "the envy of the world! while yet no guilt had  seized her soul, and no remorse had marred her peace. She was the hand-maid of  charity, and pity dwelt in her bosom! her mouth was never open but to give  comfort; her foot-steps were followed by blessings! Oh happy in purity, be  thine the song of triumph!—softly shalt thou sink to temporary  sleep,—sublimely shalt thou rise to life that wakes for ever!" He then got up, took the children by their little hands, and went away.
