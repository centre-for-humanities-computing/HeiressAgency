 Early the next morning Cecilia had a visit from Lady Honoria, who came to tell  her story her own way, and laugh at the anxiety of Mrs Delvile, and the trouble  she had taken; "for, after all," continued she, "what did the whole matter  signify? and how could I possibly help the mistake? when I heard of his paying  for a woman's board, what was so natural as to suppose she must be his  mistress? especially as there was a child in the case. O how I wish you had  been with us! you never saw such a ridiculous sight in your life; away we went  in the chaise full drive to the cottage, frightening all the people almost into  fits; out came the poor woman, away ran the poor man,—both of them thought  the end of the world at hand! The gipsey was best off, for she went to her old  business, and began begging. I assure you, I believe she would be very pretty  if she was not so ill, and so I dare say Mortimer thought too, or I fancy he  would not have taken such care of her." "Fie, fie, Lady Honoria! will nothing bring conviction to you?" "Nay, you know, there's no harm in that, for why should not pretty people live  as well as ugly ones? There's no occasion to leave nothing in the world but  frights. I looked hard at the baby, to see if it was like Mortimer, but I could  not make it out; those young things are like nothing. I tried if it would talk,  for I wanted sadly to make it call Mrs Delvile grandmama; however, the little  urchin could say nothing to be understood. O what a rage would Mrs Delvile have  been in! I suppose this whole castle would hardly have been thought heavy  enough to crush such an insolent brat, though it were to have fallen upon it  all at a blow!" Thus rattled this light-hearted lady till the family was assembled to  breakfast; and then Cecilia, softened towards Delvile by newly-excited  admiration, as well as by the absence which would separate them the following  day, intended, by every little courteous office in her power, to make her peace  with him before his departure: but she observed, with much chagrin, that Mrs  Delvile never ceased to watch her, which, added to an air of pride in the  coldness of Delvile, that he had never before assumed, discouraged her from  making the attempt, and compelled her to seem quiet and unconcerned. As soon as breakfast was over, the gentlemen all rode or walked out; and when  the ladies were by themselves, Lady Honoria suddenly exclaimed, "Mrs Delvile, I  can't imagine for what reason you send Mr Mortimer to Bristol." "For a reason, Lady Honoria, that with all your wildness, I should be very  sorry you should know better by experience." "Why then, ma'am; had we not better make a party, and all go? Miss Beverley,  should you like to join it? I am afraid it would be vastly disagreeable to you." Cecilia, now again was red and white, and white and red a dozen times in a  minute; and Mrs Delvile, rising and taking her hand, expressively said, "Miss  Beverley, you have a thousand times too much sensibility for this mad-cap of a  companion. I believe I shall punish her by taking you away from her all this  morning; will you come and sit with me in the dressing-room?" Cecilia assented without daring to look at her, and followed in trembling, up  stairs. Something of importance, she fancied, would ensue, her secret she saw  was revealed, and therefore she could form no conjecture but that Delvile would  be the subject of their discourse yet whether to explain his behaviour, or  plead his cause, whether to express her separate approbation, or communicate  some intelligence from himself, she had neither time, opportunity nor clue to  unravel. All that was undoubted seemed the affection of Mrs Delvile, all that,  on her own part, could be resolved, was to suppress her partiality till she  knew if it might properly be, avowed. Mrs Delvile, who saw her perturbation, led immediately to subjects of  indifference, and talked upon them so long, and with so much ease, that  Cecilia, recovering her composure, began to think she had been mistaken, and  that nothing was intended but a tranquil conversation. As soon, however, as she had quieted her apprehensions, she sat silent herself,  with a look that Cecilia easily construed into thoughtful perplexity in what  manner she should introduce what she meant to communicate. This pause was succeeded by her speaking of Lady Honoria; "how wild, how  careless, how incorrigible she is! she lost her mother early; and the Duke, who  idolizes her, and who, marrying very late, is already an old man, she rules  entirely; with him, and a supple governess, who has neither courage to oppose  her, nor heart to wish well but to her own interest, she has lived almost  wholly. Lately, indeed, she has come more into the world, but without even a  desire of improvement, and with no view and no thought but to gratify her idle  humour by laughing at whatever goes forward." "She certainly neither wants parts nor discernment," said Cecilia; "and, when  my mind is not occupied by other matters, I find her conversation entertaining  and agreeable." "Yes," said Mrs Delvile, "but that light sort of wit which attacks, with equal  alacrity, what is serious or what is gay, is twenty times offensive, to once  that it is exhilarating; since it shews that while its only aim is  self-diversion, it has the most insolent negligence with respect to any pain it  gives to others. The rank of Lady Honoria, though it has not rendered her  proud, nor even made her conscious she has any dignity to support, has yet  given her a saucy indifference whom she pleases or hurts, that borders upon  what in a woman is of all things the most odious, a daring defiance of the  world and its opinions." Cecilia, never less disposed to enter upon her defence, made but little answer;  and, soon after, Mrs Delvile added, "I heartily wish she were properly  established; and yet, according to the pernicious manners and maxims of the  present age, she is perhaps more secure from misconduct while single, than she  will be when married. Her father, I fear, will leave her too much to herself,  and in that case I scarce know what may become of her; she has neither judgment  nor principle to direct her choice, and therefore, in all probability, the same  whim which one day will guide it, will the next lead her to repent it." Again they were both silent; and then Mrs Delvile, gravely, yet with energy  exclaimed, "How few are there, how very few, who marry at once upon principles  rational, and feelings pleasant! interest and inclination are eternally at  strife, and where either is wholly sacrificed, the other is inadequate to  happiness. Yet how rarely do they divide the attention! the young are rash, and  the aged are mercenary; their deliberations are never in concert, their views  are scarce ever blended; one vanquishes, and the other submits; neither party  temporizes, and commonly each is unhappy." "The time," she continued, "is now arrived when reflections of this sort cannot  too seriously occupy me; the errors I have observed in others, I would fain  avoid committing; yet such is the blindness of self-love, that perhaps, even at  the moment I censure them, I am falling, without consciousness, into the same!  nothing, however, shall through negligence be wrong; for where is the son who  merits care and attention, if Mortimer from his parents deserves not to meet  them?" The expectations of Cecilia were now again awakened, and awakened with fresh  terrors lest Mrs Delvile, from compassion, meant to offer her services;  vigorously, therefore, she determined to exert herself, and rather give up  Mortimer and all thoughts of him for ever, than submit to receive assistance in  persuading him to the union. "Mr Delvile," she continued, "is most earnest and impatient that some alliance  should take place without further delay; and for myself, could I see him with  propriety and with happiness disposed of, what a weight of anxiety would be  removed from my heart!" Cecilia now made an effort to speak, attempting to say "Certainly, it is a  matter of great consequence;" but so low was her voice, and so confused her  manner, that Mrs Delvile, though attentively listening, heard not a word. She  forbore, however, to make her repeat what she said, and went on herself as if  speaking in answer. "Not only his own, but the peace of his whole family will depend upon his  election, since he is the last of his race. This castle and estate, and another  in the north, were entailed upon him by the late Lord Delvile, his grandfather,  who, disobliged by his eldest son, the present lord, left every thing he had  power to dispose of to his second son, Mr Delvile, and at his death, to his  grandson, Mortimer. And even the present lord, though always at variance with  his brother, is fond of his nephew, and has declared him his heir. I, also,  have one sister, who is rich, who has no children, and who has made the same  declaration. Yet though with such high expectations, he must not connect  himself imprudently; for his paternal estate wants repair, and he is well  entitled with a wife to expect what it requires." Most true! thought Cecilia, yet ashamed of her recent failure, she applied  herself to her work, and would not again try to speak. "He is amiable, accomplished, well educated, and well born; far may we look,  and not meet with his equal; no woman need disdain, and few women would refuse  him." Cecilia blushed her concurrence; yet could well at that moment have spared  hearing the eulogy. "Yet how difficult," she continued, "to find a proper alliance! there are many  who have some recommendations, but who is there wholly unexceptionable?" This question seemed unanswerable; nor could Cecilia devise what it meant. "Girls of high family have but seldom large fortunes, since the heads of their  house commonly require their whole wealth for the support of their own dignity;  while on the other hand, girls of large fortune are frequently ignorant,  insolent, or low born; kept up by their friends lest they should fall a prey to  adventurers, they have no acquaintance with the world, and little enlargement  from education; their instructions are limited to a few merely youthful  accomplishments; the first notion they imbibe is of their own importance, the  first lesson they are taught is the value of riches, and even from their  cradles, their little minds are narrowed, and their self-sufficiency is  excited, by cautions to beware of fortune-hunters, and assurances that the  whole world will be at their feet. Among such should we seek a companion for  Mortimer? surely not. Formed for domestic happiness, and delighting in elegant  society, his mind would disdain an alliance in which its affections had no  share." Cecilia colouring and trembling, thought now the moment of her trial was  approaching, and half mortified and half frightened prepared herself to sustain  it with firmness. "I venture, therefore, my dear Miss Beverley, to speak to you upon this subject  as a friend who will have patience to hear my perplexities; you see upon what  they hang,—where the birth is such as Mortimer Delvile may claim, the fortune  generally fails; and where the fortune is adequate to his expectations, the  birth yet more frequently would disgrace us." Cecilia, astonished by this speech, and quite off her guard from momentary  surprize, involuntarily raised her head to look at Mrs Delvile, in whose  countenance she observed the most anxious concern, though her manner of  speaking had seemed placid and composed. "Once," she continued, without appearing to remark the emotion of her auditor,  "Mr Delvile thought of uniting him with his cousin Lady Honoria; but he never  could endure the proposal; and who shall blame his repugnance? her sister,  indeed, Lady Euphrasia, is much preferable, her education has been better, and  her fortune is much more considerable. At present, however, Mortimer seems  greatly averse to her, and who has a right to be difficult, if we deny it to  him?" Wonder, uncertainty, expectation and suspence now all attacked Cecilia, and all  harassed her with redoubled violence; why she was called to this conference she  knew not; the approbation she had thought so certain, she doubted, and the  proposal of assistance she had apprehended, she ceased to think would be  offered some fearful mystery, some cruel obscurity, still clouded all her  prospects, and not merely obstructed her view of the future, but made what was  immediately before her gloomy and indistinct. The state of her mind seemed read by Mrs Delvile, who examined her with eyes of  such penetrating keenness, that they rather made discoveries than enquiries.  She was silent some time, and looked irresolute how to proceed; but at length,  she arose, and taking Cecilia by the hand, who almost drew it back from her  dread of what would follow, she said "I will torment you no more, my sweet  young friend, with perplexities which you cannot relieve: this only I will say,  and then drop the subject for ever; when my solicitude for Mortimer is removed,  and he is established to the satisfaction of us all, no care will remain in the  heart of his mother, half so fervent, so anxious and so sincere as the disposal  of my amiable Cecilia, for whose welfare and happiness my wishes are even  maternal." She then kissed her glowing cheek, and perceiving her almost stupified with  astonishment, spared her any effort to speak, by hastily leaving her in  possession of her room. Undeceived in her expectations and chilled in her hopes, the heart of Cecilia  no longer struggled to sustain its dignity, or conceal its tenderness; the  conflict was at an end, Mrs Delvile had been open, though her son was  mysterious; but, in removing her doubts, she had bereft her of her peace. She  now found her own mistake in building upon her approbation; she saw nothing was  less in her intentions, and that even when most ardent in affectionate regard,  she separated her interest from that of her son as if their union was a matter  of utter impossibility. "Yet why," cried Cecilia, "oh why is it deemed so! that  she loves me, she is ever eager to proclaim, that my fortune would be,  peculiarly useful, she makes not a secret, and that I, at least, should start  no insuperable objections, she has, alas! but too obviously discovered! Has she  doubts of her son?—no, she has too much discernment; the father, then, the  haughty, impracticable father, has destined him for some woman of rank, and  will listen to no other alliance." This notion somewhat soothed her in the disappointment she suffered; yet to  know herself betrayed to Mrs Delvile, and to see no other consequence ensue but  that of exciting a tender compassion, which led her to discourage, from  benevolence, hopes too high to be indulged, was a mortification so severe, that  it caused her a deeper depression of spirits than any occurrence of her life  had yet occasioned. "What Henrietta Belfield is to me," she cried, "I am to Mrs Delvile! but what  in her is amiable and artless, in me is disgraceful and unworthy. And this is  the situation which so long I have desired! This is the change of habitation  which I thought would make me so happy! oh who can chuse, who can judge for  himself? who can point out the road to his own felicity, or decide upon the  spot where his peace will be ensured!" Still, however, she had something to do, some spirit to exert, and some  fortitude to manifest: Mortimer, she was certain, suspected not his own power;  his mother, she knew, was both too good and too wise to reveal it to him, and  she determined, by caution and firmness upon his leave-taking and departure, to  retrieve, if possible, that credit with Mrs Delvile, which she feared her  betrayed susceptibility had weakened. As soon, therefore, as she recovered from her consternation, she quitted Mrs  Delvile's apartment, and seeking Lady Honoria herself, determined not to spend  even a moment alone, till Mortimer was gone; lest the sadness of her  reflections should overpower her resolution, and give a melancholy to her air  and manner which he might attribute, with but too much justice, to concern upon  his own account.
