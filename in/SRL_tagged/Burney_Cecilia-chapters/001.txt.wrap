 "Peace to the spirits of my honoured parents, respected be their remains, and  immortalized their virtues! may time, while it moulders their frail relicks to  dust, commit to tradition the record of their goodness; and Oh, may their  orphan-descendant be influenced through life by the remembrance of their  purity, and be solaced in death, that by her it was unsullied!" Such was the secret prayer with which the only survivor of the Beverley family  quitted the abode of her youth, and residence of her forefathers; while tears  of recollecting sorrow filled her eyes, and obstructed the last view of her  native town which had excited them. Cecilia, this fair traveller, had lately entered into the one-and-twentieth  year of her age. Her ancestors had been rich farmers in the county of Suffolk,  though her father, in whom a spirit of elegance had supplanted the rapacity of  wealth, had spent his time as a private country gentleman, satisfied, without  increasing his store, to live upon what he inherited from the labours of his  predecessors. She had lost him in her early youth, and her mother had not long  survived him. They had bequeathed to her 10,000 pounds, and consigned her to  the care of the Dean of ———, her uncle. With this gentleman, in whom, by  various contingencies, the accumulated possessions of a rising and prosperous  family were centred, she had passed the last four years of her life; and a few  weeks only had yet elapsed since his death, which, by depriving her of her last  relation, made her heiress to an estate of 3000 pounds per annum; with no other  restriction than that of annexing her name, if she married, to the disposal of  her hand and her riches. But though thus largely indebted to fortune, to nature she had yet greater  obligations: her form was elegant, her heart was liberal; her countenance  announced the intelligence of her mind, her complexion varied with every  emotion of her soul, and her eyes, the heralds of her speech, now beamed with  understanding and now glistened with sensibility. For the short period of her minority, the management of her fortune and the  care of her person, had by the Dean been entrusted to three guardians, among  whom her own choice was to settle her residence: but her mind, saddened by the  loss of all her natural friends, coveted to regain its serenity in the  quietness of the country, and in the bosom of an aged and maternal counsellor,  whom she loved as her mother, and to whom she had been known from her childhood. The Deanery, indeed, she was obliged to relinquish, a long repining expectant  being eager, by entering it, to bequeath to another the anxiety and suspense he  had suffered himself; though probably without much impatience to shorten their  duration in favour of the next successor; but the house of Mrs Charlton, her  benevolent friend, was open for her reception, and the alleviating tenderness  of her conversation took from her all wish of changing it. Here she had dwelt since the interment of her uncle; and here, from the  affectionate gratitude of her disposition, she had perhaps been content to  dwell till her own, had not her guardians interfered to remove her. Reluctantly she complied; she quitted her early companions, the friend she most  revered, and the spot which contained the relicks of all she had yet lived to  lament; and, accompanied by one of her guardians, and attended by two servants,  she began her journey from Bury to London. Mr Harrel, this gentleman, though in the prime of his life, though gay,  fashionable and splendid, had been appointed by her uncle to be one of her  trustees; a choice which had for object the peculiar gratification of his  niece, whose most favourite young friend Mr Harrel had married, and in whose  house he therefore knew she would most wish to live. Whatever good-nature could dictate or politeness suggest to dispel her  melancholy, Mr Harrel failed not to urge; and Cecilia, in whose disposition  sweetness was tempered with dignity, and gentleness with fortitude, suffered  not his kind offices to seem ineffectual; she kissed her hand at the last  glimpse a friendly hill afforded of her native town, and made an effort to  forget the regret with which she lost sight of it. She revived her spirits by  plans of future happiness, dwelt upon the delight with which she should meet  her young friend, and, by accepting his consolation, amply rewarded his trouble. Her serenity, however, had yet another, though milder trial to undergo, since  another friend was yet to be met, and another farewell was yet to be taken. At the distance of seven miles from Bury resided Mr Monckton, the richest and  most powerful man in that neighbourhood, at whose house Cecilia and her  guardian were invited to breakfast in their journey. Mr Monckton, who was the younger son of a noble family, was a man of parts,  information and sagacity; to great native strength of mind he added a  penetrating knowledge of the world, and to faculties the most skilful of  investigating the character of every other, a dissimulation the most profound  in concealing his own. In the bloom of his youth, impatient for wealth and  ambitious of power, he had tied himself to a rich dowager of quality, whose  age, though sixty-seven, was but among the smaller species of her evil  properties, her disposition being far more repulsive than her wrinkles. An  inequality of years so considerable, had led him to expect that the fortune he  had thus acquired, would speedily be released from the burthen with which it  was at present incumbered; but his expectations proved as vain as they were  mercenary, and his lady was not more the dupe of his protestations than he was  himself of his own purposes. Ten years he had been married to her, yet her  health was good, and her faculties were unimpaired; eagerly he had watched for  her dissolution, yet his eagerness had injured no health but his own! So  short-sighted is selfish cunning, that in aiming no further than at the  gratification of the present moment, it obscures the evils of the future, while  it impedes the perception of integrity and honour. His ardour, however, to attain the blessed period of returning liberty,  deprived him neither of spirit nor inclination for intermediate enjoyment; he  knew the world too well to incur its censure by ill-treating the woman to whom  he was indebted for the rank he held in it; he saw her, indeed, but seldom, yet  he had the decency, alike in avoiding as in meeting her, to shew no abatement  of civility and good breeding: but, having thus sacrificed to ambition all  possibility of happiness in domestic life, he turned his thoughts to those  other methods of procuring it, which he had so dearly purchased the power of  essaying. The resources of pleasure to the possessors of wealth are only to be cut off by  the satiety of which they are productive: a satiety which the vigorous mind of  Mr Monckton had not yet suffered him to experience; his time, therefore, was  either devoted to the expensive amusements of the metropolis, or spent in the  country among the gayest of its diversions. The little knowledge of fashionable manners and of the characters of the times  of which Cecilia was yet mistress, she had gathered at the house of this  gentleman, with whom the Dean her uncle had been intimately connected: for as  he preserved to the world the same appearance of decency he supported to his  wife, he was everywhere well received, and being but partially known, was  extremely respected: the world, with its wonted facility, repaying his  circumspect attention to its laws, by silencing the voice of censure, guarding  his character from impeachment, and his name from reproach. Cecilia had been known to him half her life; she had been caressed in his house  as a beautiful child, and her presence was now solicited there as an amiable  acquaintance. Her visits, indeed, had by no means been frequent, as the  ill-humour of Lady Margaret Monckton had rendered them painful to her; yet the  opportunities they had afforded her of mixing with people of fashion, had  served to prepare her for the new scenes in which she was soon to be a  performer. Mr Monckton, in return, had always been a welcome guest at the Deanery; his  conversation was to Cecilia a never-failing source of information, as his  knowledge of life and manners enabled him to start those subjects of which she  was most ignorant; and her mind, copious for the admission and intelligent for  the arrangement of knowledge, received all new ideas with avidity. Pleasure given in society, like money lent in usury, returns with interest to  those who dispense it: and the discourse of Mr Monckton conferred not a greater  favour upon Cecilia than her attention to it repaid. And thus, the speaker and  the hearer being mutually gratified, they had always met with complacency, and  commonly parted with regret. This reciprocation of pleasure had, however, produced different effects upon  their minds; the ideas of Cecilia were enlarged, while the reflections of Mr  Monckton were embittered. He here saw an object who to all the advantages of  that wealth he had so highly prized, added youth, beauty, and intelligence;  though much her senior, he was by no means of an age to render his addressing  her an impropriety, and the entertainment she received from his conversation,  persuaded him that her good opinion might with ease be improved into a regard  the most partial. He regretted the venal rapacity with which he had sacrificed  himself to a woman he abhorred, and his wishes for her final decay became daily  more fervent. He knew that the acquaintance of Cecilia was confined to a circle  of which he was himself the principal ornament, that she had rejected all the  proposals of marriage which had hitherto been made to her, and, as he had  sedulously watched her from her earliest years, he had reason to believe that  her heart had escaped any dangerous impression. This being her situation, he  had long looked upon her as his future property; as such he had indulged his  admiration, and as such he had already appropriated her estate, though he had  not more vigilantly inspected into her sentiments, than he had guarded his own  from a similar scrutiny. The death of the Dean her uncle had, indeed, much alarmed him; he grieved at  her leaving Suffolk, where he considered himself the first man, alike in parts  and in consequence, and he dreaded her residing in London, where he foresaw  that numerous rivals, equal to himself in talents and in riches, would speedily  surround her; rivals, too, youthful and sanguine, not shackled by present ties,  but at liberty to solicit her immediate acceptance. Beauty and independence,  rarely found together, would attract a crowd of suitors at once brilliant and  assiduous; and the house of Mr Harrel was eminent for its elegance and gaiety;  but yet, undaunted by danger, and confiding in his own powers, he determined to  pursue the project he had formed, not fearing by address and perseverance to  ensure its success.
