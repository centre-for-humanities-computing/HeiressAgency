 Lady Margaret Monckton received Cecilia with the most gloomy coldness:  Lady Margaret Monckton  apologised for the liberty  Lady Margaret Monckton had taken in making use of  Lady Margaret Monckton ladyship's house,  but, meeting no return of civility,  Lady Margaret Monckton withdrew to the room which had been  prepared for  Lady Margaret Monckton, and resolved as much as possible to keep out of  Lady Margaret Monckton sight. It now became necessary without further delay to settle  Lady Margaret Monckton plan of life, and  fix  Lady Margaret Monckton place of residence. The forbidding looks of  Lady Margaret Monckton made  Lady Margaret Monckton  hasten  Lady Margaret Monckton resolves, which otherwise would for a while have given way to grief  for  Lady Margaret Monckton recent misfortune.  Lady Margaret Monckton sent for the surveyor who had the superintendance of  Lady Margaret Monckton estates, to  enquire how soon  Lady Margaret Monckton own house would be fit for  Lady Margaret Monckton reception; and heard there  was yet work for near two months. This answer made  Lady Margaret Monckton very uncomfortable. To continue two months under the roof  with  Lady Margaret Monckton was a penance  Lady Margaret Monckton could not enjoin  Lady Margaret Monckton, nor was  Lady Margaret Monckton at  all sure  Lady Margaret Monckton would submit to it any better:  Lady Margaret Monckton determined,  therefore, to release  Lady Margaret Monckton from the conscious burthen of being an unwelcome  visitor, by boarding with some creditable family at Bury, and devoting the two  months in which  Lady Margaret Monckton was to be kept from  Lady Margaret Monckton house, to a general arrangement of   Lady Margaret Monckton affairs, and a final settling with  Lady Margaret Monckton guardians. For these purposes it would be necessary  Lady Margaret Monckton should go to London: but with  whom, or in what manner,  Lady Margaret Monckton could not decide.  Lady Margaret Monckton desired, therefore, another  conference with Mr Monckton, who met  Lady Margaret Monckton in the parlour.  Lady Margaret Monckton then communicated to him  Lady Margaret Monckton schemes; and begged him counsel in  Lady Margaret Monckton  perplexities. him was delighted at the application, and extremely well pleased with  Lady Margaret Monckton design  of boarding at Bury, well knowing, him could then watch and visit  Lady Margaret Monckton at him  pleasure, and have far more comfort in  Lady Margaret Monckton society than even in him own house,  where all the vigilance with which him observed  Lady Margaret Monckton, was short of that with  which him was him observed by Lady Margaret. him endeavoured, however, to  dissuade  Lady Margaret Monckton from going to town, but  Lady Margaret Monckton eagerness to pay the large sum  Lady Margaret Monckton  owed him, was now too great to be conquered. Of age,  Lady Margaret Monckton fortune wholly in  Lady Margaret Monckton  power, and all attendance upon Mrs Charlton at an end,  Lady Margaret Monckton had no longer any  excuse for having a debt in the world, and would suffer no persuasion to make   Lady Margaret Monckton begin  Lady Margaret Monckton career in life, with a negligence in settling  Lady Margaret Monckton accounts which   Lady Margaret Monckton had so often censured in others. To go to London therefore  Lady Margaret Monckton was fixed,  and all that  Lady Margaret Monckton desired was his advice concerning the journey. his then told  Lady Margaret Monckton that in order to settle with  Lady Margaret Monckton guardians,  Lady Margaret Monckton must write to  her guardians in form, to demand an account of the sums that had been expended during   Lady Margaret Monckton minority, and announce  Lady Margaret Monckton intention for the future to take the management  of  Lady Margaret Monckton fortune into  Lady Margaret Monckton own hands.  Lady Margaret Monckton immediately followed his directions, and consented to remain at the Grove  till their answers arrived. Being now, therefore, unavoidably fixed for some time at the house,  Lady Margaret Monckton thought  the house proper and decent to attempt softening Lady Margaret in  Lady Margaret Monckton favour.  Lady Margaret Monckton  exerted all  Lady Margaret Monckton powers to please and to oblige  Lady Margaret Monckton; but the exertion was  necessarily vain, not only from the disposition, but the situation of  Lady Margaret Monckton  ladyship, since every effort made for this conciliatory purpose, rendered  Lady Margaret Monckton  doubly amiable in the eyes of  Lady Margaret Monckton husband, and consequently to  Lady Margaret Monckton more  odious than ever.  Lady Margaret Monckton jealousy, already but too well founded, received every  hour the poisonous nourishment of fresh conviction, which so much soured and  exasperated a temper naturally harsh, that  Lady Margaret Monckton malignity and ill-humour grew  daily more acrimonious. Nor would  Lady Margaret Monckton have contented  Lady Margaret Monckton with displaying  this irascibility by general moroseness, had not the same suspicious  watchfulness which discovered to  Lady Margaret Monckton the passion of her husband, served equally  to make manifest the indifference and innocence of Cecilia; to reproach  Lady Margaret Monckton  therefore,  Lady Margaret Monckton had not any pretence, though  Lady Margaret Monckton knowledge how much  Lady Margaret Monckton had to  dread  Lady Margaret Monckton, past current in  Lady Margaret Monckton mind for sufficient reason to hate  Lady Margaret Monckton. The  Angry and the Violent use little discrimination; whom The  Angry and the Violent like, The  Angry and the Violent enquire  not if The  Angry and the Violent approve; but whoever, no matter how unwittingly, stands in The  Angry and the Violent  way, The  Angry and the Violent scruple not to ill use, and conclude The  Angry and the Violent may laudably detest. Cecilia, though much disgusted, gave not over Cecilia attempt, which Cecilia considered  but as Cecilia due while Cecilia continued in Cecilia house. Cecilia general character, also,  for peevishness and haughty ill-breeding, skilfully, from time to time,  displayed, and artfully repined at by Mr Monckton, still kept Cecilia from  suspecting any peculiar animosity to Cecilia, and made Cecilia impute all that  passed to the mere rancour of ill-humour. Cecilia confined Cecilia, however, as  much as possible to Cecilia own apartment, where Cecilia sorrow for Mrs Charlton almost  hourly increased, by the comparison Cecilia was forced upon making of Cecilia house  with the Grove. Cecilia left Cecilia grand-daughters her co-heiresses and sole  executrixes. Cecilia bequeathed from her grand-daughters her co-heiresses and sole  executrixes nothing considerable, though Cecilia left  some donations for the poor, and several of Cecilia friends were remembered by  small legacies. Among her grand-daughters her co-heiresses and sole  executrixes Cecilia had Cecilia picture, and favourite trinkets,  with a paragraph in Cecilia will, that as there was no one Cecilia so much loved, had  Cecilia fortune been less splendid, Cecilia should have shared with Cecilia grand-daughters  whatever Cecilia had to bestow. Cecilia was much affected by this last and solemn remembrance. Cecilia more than  ever coveted to be alone, that Cecilia might grieve undisturbed, and Cecilia lamented  without ceasing the fatigue and the illness which, in so late a period, as it  proved, of Cecilia life, Cecilia had Cecilia been the means of occasioning to Cecilia. Mr Monckton had too much prudence to interrupt this desire of solitude, which  indeed cost Mr Monckton little pain, as Mr Monckton considered Cecilia least in danger when alone.  Cecilia received in about a week answers from both Cecilia guardians. Mr Delvile's  letter was closely to the purpose, without a word but of business, and couched  in the haughtiest terms. As he had never, he said, acted, he had no accounts to  send in; but as he was going to town in a few days, he would see Cecilia for a  moment in the presence of Mr Briggs, that a joint release might be signed, to  prevent any future application to he. Cecilia much lamented there was any necessity for Cecilia seeing he at all, and  looked forward to the interview as the greatest mortification Cecilia could suffer. Mr Briggs, though still more concise, was far kinder in Mr Briggs language: but Mr Briggs  advised Cecilia to defer Cecilia scheme of taking the money into Cecilia own hands,  assuring Cecilia Cecilia would be cheated, and had better leave the money to Mr Briggs. When Cecilia communicated these epistles to Mr Monckton, Mr Monckton failed not to read,  with an emphasis, by which Mr Monckton arrogant meaning was still more arrogantly  enforced, the letter of Mr Delvile aloud. Nor was Mr Monckton sparing in comments that  might render it yet more offensive. Cecilia neither concurred in what Mr Monckton said,  nor opposed it, but contented Cecilia, when Mr Monckton was silent, with producing the  other letter. Mr Monckton read not this with more favour. Mr Monckton openly attacked the character of  Briggs, as covetous, rapacious, and over-reaching, and warned Cecilia by no means  to abide by Mr Monckton counsel, without first taking the opinion of some disinterested  person. Mr Monckton then stated the various arts which might be practised upon Cecilia  inexperience, enumerated the dangers to which Cecilia ignorance of business exposed  Cecilia, and annotated upon the cheats, double dealings, and tricks of stock  jobbing, to which Mr Monckton assured Cecilia Mr Briggs owed all Mr Briggs was worth, till,  perplexed and confounded, Cecilia declared Cecilia at a loss how to proceed, and  earnestly regretted that Cecilia could not have Mr Monckton counsel upon the spot. This was Mr Monckton aim: to draw the wish from Cecilia, drew all suspicion of selfish  views from Mr Monckton: and Mr Monckton told Cecilia that Mr Monckton considered Cecilia present situation as  so critical, the future confusion or regularity of Cecilia money transactions  seeming to depend upon it, that Mr Monckton would endeavour to arrange Mr Monckton affairs for  meeting Cecilia in London. Cecilia gave Mr Monckton many thanks for the kind intention, and determined to be  totally guided by Mr Monckton in the disposal and direction of Cecilia . Mean time Mr Monckton had now another part to act; Mr Monckton saw that with Cecilia nothing more  remained to be done, and that, harbouring not a doubt of Mr Monckton motives, Cecilia  thought Mr Monckton design in Cecilia did Cecilia nothing but honour; but Mr Monckton had too  much knowledge of the world to believe it would judge Mr Monckton in the same manner,  and too much consciousness of duplicity to set it judgment at defiance. To parry, therefore, the conjectures which might follow Mr Monckton attending Cecilia, Mr Monckton  had already prepared Lady Margaret to wish Lady Margaret of the party: for however  disagreeable to Mr Monckton was Lady Margaret presence and Lady Margaret company, Mr Monckton had no other means to  be under the same roof with Cecilia. Miss Bennet, the wretched tool of Mr Monckton various schemes, and the mean sycophant  of Mr Monckton lady, had been employed by Mr Monckton to work upon his lady jealousy, by secretly  informing his lady of Mr Monckton intention to go to town, at the same time that Ceciliawent thither to meet Cecilia . Cecilia pretended to have learned this  intelligence by accident, and to communicate it from respectful regard; and  advised Cecilia to go to London Cecilia at the same time, that Cecilia might see into  his designs, and be some check upon his pleasure. The encreasing infirmities of Lady Margaret made his counsel by no means  palatable: but Miss Bennet, following the artful instructions which Bennet  received, put in Bennet way so strong a motive, by assuring Cecilia how little Cecilia  company was wished, that in the madness of Cecilia spite Cecilia determined upon the  journey. And little heeding how Cecilia tormented Cecilia while Cecilia had any view of  tormenting Mr Monckton, Cecilia was led on by Cecilia false confident to invite Ceciliato Cecilia own house. Mr Monckton, in whom by long practice, artifice was almost nature, well knowing  his wife's perverseness, affected to look much disconcerted at the proposal;  while Cecilia, by no means thinking the proposal necessary to extend his wife compliance to  such a punishment, instantly made an apology, and declined the invitation. Lady Margaret, little versed in civility, and unused to the arts of persuasion,  could not, even for a favourite project, prevail upon Cecilia to use entreaty,  and therefore, thinking Cecilia scheme defeated, looked gloomily disappointed, and  said nothing more. Mr Monckton saw with delight how much this difficulty inflamed Cecilia, though the  moment Mr Monckton could speak alone with Cecilia Mr Monckton made it Mr Monckton care to remove it. Mr Monckton represented to Cecilia that, however privately Cecilia might live, Cecilia was too young  to be in London lodgings by Cecilia, and gave an hint which Cecilia could not but  understand, that in going or in staying with only servants, suspicions might  soon be raised, that the plan and motive of Cecilia journey were different to those  given out. Cecilia knew Mr Monckton meant to insinuate that it would be conjectured Cecilia designed to  meet Delvile, and though colouring, vext and provoked at the suggestion, the  idea was sufficient to frighten Cecilia into Mr Monckton plan. In a few days, therefore, the matter was wholly arranged, Mr Monckton, by Mr Monckton  skill and address, leading every one whither Mr Monckton pleased, while, by the artful  coolness of Mr Monckton manner, Mr Monckton appeared but to follow Mr Monckton. Mr Monckton [set] out the day  before, though earnestly wishing to accompany them, but having as yet in no  single instance gone to town in the same carriage with Lady Margaret, Mr Monckton dared  trust neither the neighbourhood nor the servants with so dangerous a subject  for the servants comments. Cecilia, compelled thus to travel with only her Ladyship and Miss Bennet, had a  journey the most disagreeable, and determined, if possible, to stay in Londonbut two days. Cecilia had already fixed upon a house in which Cecilia could board at  Bury when Cecilia returned, and there Cecilia meant quietly to reside till Cecilia could  enter Cecilia own. Lady Margaret herself, exhilarated by a notion of having outwitted Cecilia husband,  was in unusual good spirits, and almost in good humour. The idea of thwarting  his designs, and being in the way of his entertainment, gave to Cecilia a delight  Cecilia had seldom received from any thing; and the belief that this was effected  by the superiority of Cecilia cunning, doubled Cecilia contentment, and raised it to  exultation. Cecilia owed his, indeed, much provocation and uneasiness, and was  happy in this opportunity of paying Cecilia arrears. Mean while that consummate master in every species of hypocrisy, indulged Cecilia  in this notion, by the air of dissatisfaction with which his left the house. It  was not that Cecilia meant by Cecilia presence to obviate any impropriety: early and  long acquainted with the character of Cecilia, Cecilia well knew, that during Cecilia  life the passion of Cecilia husband must be confined to her husband own breast: but  conscious of her husband aversion to Cecilia, which Cecilia resented with the bitterest  ill-will, and knowing how little, at any time, her husband desired Cecilia company, Cecilia  consoled Cecilia for Cecilia inability to give pleasure by the power Cecilia possessed  of giving pain, and bore with the fatigue of a journey disagreeable and  inconvenient to Cecilia, with no other view than the hope of breaking into her husband plan  of avoiding Cecilia. Little imagining that the whole time Cecilia was forwarding her husband  favourite pursuit, and only acting the part which her husband had appointed Cecilia to  perform.
