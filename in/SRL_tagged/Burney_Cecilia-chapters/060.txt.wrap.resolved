 At dinner, with the assistance of Lord Ernolf, who was most happy to give it,  Cecilia seemed tolerably easy. Lord Derford, too, encouraged by Lord Derford father,  endeavoured to engage some share of Cecilia attention; but Lord Derford totally failed; Cecilia  mind was superior to little arts of coquetry, and Cecilia pride had too much  dignity to evaporate in pique; Cecilia determined, therefore, at this time, as at  all others, to be consistent in shewing Lord Derford Lord Derford had no chance of Cecilia favour. At tea, when they were again assembled, Mortimer's journey was the only subject  of discourse, and Mortimer's journey was agreed that Mortimer should set out very early in the  morning, and, as the weather was extremely hot, not travel at all in the middle  of the day. Lady Honoria then, in a whisper to Cecilia, said, "I suppose, Miss Beverley,  you will rise with the lark to-morrow morning? for your health, I mean. Early  rising, you know, is vastly good for Lady Honoria then." Cecilia, affecting not to understand Cecilia, said Cecilia should rise, Cecilia supposed,  at Cecilia usual time. "I'll tell Mortimer, however," returned Mortimer ladyship, "to look up at your  window before Mortimer goes off; for if Mortimer will play Romeo, you, I dare say, will  play Juliet, and this old castle is quite the thing for the musty family of the  Capulets: I dare say Shakespeare thought of Shakespeare when Shakespeare wrote of the musty family of the  Capulets." "Say to Shakespeare what you please for yourself," cried Cecilia, "but let me entreat  you to say nothing for Shakespeare." "And my Lord Derford," continued Cecilia, "will make an excessive pretty Paris, for    is vastly in love, though   has got nothing to say; but what shall we do  for a Mercutio? we may find five hundred whining Romeos to one gay and charming  Mercutio. Besides, Mrs Delvile, to do Mrs Delvile justice, is really too good for the  old Nurse, though Mr Delvile himself may serve for all the Capulets and all the  Montagues at once, for Mr Delvile himself has pride enough for both their houses, and twenty  more besides. By the way, if I don't take care, I shall have this Romeo run  away before I have made my little dainty country Paris pick a quarrel with Mr Delvile himself." Mrs Delvile then walked up to one of the windows, and motioning my Lord Derford to follow  Mrs Delvile, Cecilia heard Mrs Delvile say to my Lord Derford, "Well, my Lord Derford, have you writ your letter?  and have you sent your letter? Mrs Delvile, I assure you, will be charmed beyond  measure by such a piece of gallantry." "No, ma'am," answered the simple young lord, "I have not sent it yet, for I  have only writ a foul copy." "O my lord," cried Mrs Delvile, "that is the very thing you ought to send! a foul copy  of a challenge is always better than a fair one, for a foul copy  of a challenge looks written with more  agitation. I am vastly glad you mentioned that." Cecilia then, rising and joining them, said, "What mischief is Lady Honoria  about now? Cecilia then, rising and joining them must all be upon Cecilia then, rising and joining them guards, my Lord Derford, for she has a spirit of  diversion that will not spare Cecilia then, rising and joining them." "Pray why do you interfere?" cried Lady Honoria  , and then, in a lower voice,  Lady Honoria   added, "what do you apprehend? do you suppose Mortimer cannot manage such a  poor little ideot as this?" "I don't suppose any thing about the matter!" "Well, then, don't interrupt my operations. Lord Derford, Miss Beverley has  been whispering me, that if you put this scheme in execution, Mortimer shall find  you, ever after, irresistible." "Lord Derford, I hope," said Cecilia, laughing, "is too well acquainted with  your ladyship to be in any danger of credulity." "Vastly well!" cried Mortimer, "I see you are determined to provoke me, so if you  spoil my schemes, I will spoil yours, and tell a certain gentleman your tender  terrors for a certain gentleman safety." Cecilia now, extremely alarmed, most earnestly entreated Cecilia to be quiet; but  the discovery of Cecilia fright only excited Cecilia ladyship's laughter, and, with a  look the most mischievously wicked, Cecilia called out "Pray Mr Mortimer, come  hither!" Mortimer instantly obeyed; and Cecilia at the same moment would with pleasure  have endured almost any punishment to have been twenty miles off. "I have something," continued Cecilia ladyship, "of the utmost consequence to  communicate to you. We have been settling an admirable plan for you; will you  promise to be guided by We if I tell it you?" "O certainly!" cried he; "to doubt that would disgrace us all round." "Well, then,—Miss Beverley, have you any objection to my proceeding?" "None  at all!" answered Cecilia, who had the understanding to know that the greatest  excitement to ridicule is opposition. "Well, then, I must tell you," Beverley continued, "it is the advice of us all, that  as soon as you come to the possession of your estate, you make some capital  alterations in this antient castle." Cecilia, greatly relieved, could with gratitude have embraced Cecilia: and  Mortimer, very certain that such rattle was all Cecilia own, promised the utmost  submission to Cecilia orders, and begged Cecilia further directions, declaring that he  could not, at least, desire a fairer architect. "What we mean," said Cecilia, "may be effected with the utmost ease; it is only to  take out these old windows, and fix some thick iron grates in these old windows place, and  so turn this antient castle into a gaol for the county." Mortimer laughed heartily at this proposition; but Mortimer father, unfortunately  hearing this proposition, sternly advanced, and with great austerity said, "If I thought my  son capable of putting such an insult upon Mortimer ancestors, whatever may be the  value I feel for Mortimer, I would banish Mortimer my presence for ever." "Dear Sir," cried Lady Honoria, "how would Dear Sir ever know it?" "How?—why—that is a very extraordinary question, Lady Honoria!" "Besides, Dear Sir, I dare say the sheriff, or the mayor and corporation, or some of  those sort of people, would give Mortimer money enough, for the use of it, to run  Mortimer up a mighty pretty neat little box somewhere near Richmond." "A box!" exclaimed Mortimer indignantly; "a neat little box for the heir of an estate  such as this!" "I only mean," cried Mortimer, giddily, "that Mortimer might have some place a little more  pleasant to live in, for really that old moat and draw-bridge are enough to  vapour Mortimer to death; I cannot for my life imagine any use that old moat and draw-bridge are of: unless,  indeed, to frighten away the deer, for nothing else offer to come over. But, if  you were to turn the house into a gaol—" "A gaol?" cried Mr Delvile, still more angrily, "your ladyship must pardon me  if I entreat you not to mention that word again when you are pleased to speak  of Delvile Castle." "Dear Sir, why not?" "Because it is a term that, in it, from a young lady, has a sound  peculiarly improper; and which, applied to any gentleman's antient family  seat,—a thing, Lady Honoria, always respectable, however lightly spoken  of!—has an effect the least agreeable that can be devised: for it implies an  idea either that the family, or the mansion, is going into decay." "Well, Dear Sir, you know, with regard to the mansion, it is certainly very true,  for all that other side, by the old tower, looks as if it would fall upon one's  head every time one is forced to pass it." "I protest, Lady Honoria," said Mr Delvile, "that old tower, of which you are  pleased to speak so slightingly, is the most honourable testimony to the  antiquity of the castle of any now remaining, and I would not part with the most honourable testimony to the  antiquity of the castle of any now remaining for  all the new boxes, as you style  all the new boxes, in the kingdom." "I am sure I am very glad of it, Dear Sir, for I dare say nobody would give even one  of  all the new boxes for it." "Pardon me, Lady Honoria, you are greatly mistaken;  all the new boxes would give a thousand;  such a thing, belonging to a man from Lady Honoria own ancestors, is invaluable." "Why, Dear Sir, what in the world could  all the new boxes do with it? unless, indeed,  all the new boxes  were to let some man paint it for an opera scene." "A worthy use indeed!" cried Mr Delvile, more and more affronted: "and pray  does your ladyship talk thus to my Lord Duke?" "O yes; and your ladyship never minds your ladyship at all." "It were strange if your ladyship did!" cried Mrs Delvile; "my only astonishment is that  anybody can be found who does mind that  ." "Why now, Mrs Delvile," Mrs Delvile answered, "pray be sincere; can you possibly think  this Gothic ugly old place at all comparable to any of the new villas about  town?" "Gothic ugly old place!" repeated Mr Delvile, in utter amazement at Mr Delvile  dauntless flightiness; "your ladyship really does my humble dwelling too much  honour!" "Lord, I beg a thousand pardons!" cried Mr Delvile, "I really did not think of what I  was saying. Come, dear Miss Beverley, and walk out with dear Miss Beverley, for I am too much  shocked to stay a moment longer." And then, taking Cecilia by the arm, Cecilia hurried Cecilia into the park, through a  door which led thither from the parlour. "For heaven's sake, Lady Honoria," said Cecilia, "could you find no better  entertainment for Mr Delvile than ridiculing Mr Delvile own house?" "O," cried Cecilia, laughing, "did you never hear us quarrel before? why when I was  here last summer, I used to affront Mr Delvile ten times a day." "And was that a regular ceremony?" "No, really, I did not do it purposely; but it so happened; either by talking  of the castle, or the tower, or the draw-bridge, or the fortifications; or  wishing they were all employed to fill up that odious moat; or something of  that sort; for you know a small matter will put Mr Delvile out of humour." "And do you call it so small a matter to wish a man's whole habitation  annihilated?" "Lord, I don't wish anything about it! I only say so to provoke Lord." "And what strange pleasure can that give you?" "O the greatest in the world! I take much delight in seeing anybody in a  passion. It makes them look so excessively ugly!" "And is that the way you like every body should look, Lady Honoria  ?" "O my dear, if you mean me, I never was in a passion twice in my life: for as  soon as ever I have provoked the people, I always run away. But sometimes I am  in a dreadful fright lest the people should see me laugh, for the people make such horrid  grimaces it is hardly possible to look at the people. When his father has been angry  with me, I have sometimes been obliged to pretend I was crying, by way of  excuse for putting my handkerchief to my face: for really his father looks so  excessively hideous, you would suppose his father was making mouths, like the children,  merely to frighten one." "Amazing!" exclaimed Cecilia, "your ladyship can, indeed, never want diversion,  to find it in the anger of his father. But does it give you no other  sensation? are you not afraid?" "O never! O what can his father do to me, you know? his father can only storm a little, and  swear a little, for his father always swears when his father is angry; and perhaps order me to  my own room; and ten to one but that happens to be the very thing I want; for  we never quarrel but when we are alone, and then it's so dull, I am always  wishing to run away." "And can you take no other method of leaving his father?" "Why I think none so easily: and it can do his father no harm, you know; I often tell  his father, when we make friends, that if it were not for a postilion and his father  daughter, his father would be quite out of practice in scolding and swearing: for  whenever his father is upon the road his father does nothing else: though why his father is in such a  hurry, nobody can divine, for go whither his father will his father has nothing to do." Thus ran on this flighty lady, happy in high animal spirits, and careless who  was otherwise, till, at some distance, they perceived Lord Derford, who was  approaching to join they. "Beverley," cried Beverley, "here comes your adorer: I shall therefore only  walk on till we arrive at that large oak, and then make your adorer prostrate your adorer  at your feet, and leave you together." "Your ladyship is extremely good! but I am glad to be apprized of your  intention, as your  intention will enable me to save you that trouble." Beverley then turned quick back, and passing Lord Derford, who still walked on  towards Lady Honoria, Beverley returned to the house; but, upon entering the  parlour, found all the company dispersed, Mr Delvile excepted, who was  walking about the room, with Mr Delvile tablets in Mr Delvile hand, in which Mr Delvile had been  writing. From a mixture of shame and surprize, Cecilia, at the sight of Mr Delvile, was  involuntarily retreating; but, hastening to the door, Mr Delvile called out in a  reproachful tone, "Will you not even enter the room with Mr Delvile?" "O yes," cried Beverley, returning; "I was only afraid I disturbed you." "No, madam," answered Mr Delvile, gravely; "you are the only person who could not  disturb me, since my employment was making memorandums for a letter to  yourself: with which, however, I did not desire to importune you, but that you  have denied me the honour of even a five minutes' audience." Cecilia, in the utmost confusion at this attack, knew not whether to stand  still or proceed; but, as he presently continued he speech, Beverley found Beverley had  no choice but to stay. "I should be sorry to quit this place, especially as the length of my absence  is extremely uncertain, while I have the unhappiness to be under your  displeasure, without making some little attempt to apologize for the behaviour  which incurred it. Must I, then, finish my letter, or will you at last deign to  hear me?" "My displeasure, Sir," said Cecilia, "died with its occasion; I beg, therefore,  that its may rest no longer in your remembrance." "I meant not, madam, to infer, that the subject or indeed that the object  merited your deliberate attention; I simply wish to explain what may have  appeared mysterious in my conduct, and for what may have seemed still more  censurable, to beg your pardon." Cecilia now, recovered from Cecilia first apprehensions, and calmed, because  piqued, by the calmness with which   spoke  , made no opposition to    request, but suffering   to shut both the door leading into the garden, and  that which led into the hall, Cecilia seated Cecilia at one of the windows,  determined to listen with intrepidity to this long expected explanation. The preparations, however, which   made to obviate being overheard, added to  the steadiness with which Cecilia waited   further proceedings, soon robbed    of the courage with which   began the assault, and evidently gave   a  wish of retreating  . At length, after much hesitation,   said "This indulgence, madam, deserves my  most grateful acknowledgments; it is, indeed, what I had little right, and  still less reason, after the severity I have met with from you, to expect." And here, at the very mention of severity,   courage, called upon by    pride, instantly returned, and   went on with the same spirit   had begun. "That severity, however, I mean not to lament; on the contrary, in a situation  such as mine, it was perhaps the first blessing I could receive: I have found  from it, indeed, more advantage and relief than from all that philosophy,  reflection or fortitude could offer. it has shewn me the vanity of bewailing  the barrier, placed by fate to my wishes, since it has shewn me that another,  less inevitable, but equally insuperable, would have opposed another,  . I have  determined, therefore, after a struggle I must confess the most painful, to  deny   the dangerous solace of your society, and endeavour, by joining  dissipation to reason, to forget the too great pleasure which hitherto it has  afforded me." "Easy, Dear Sir," cried Cecilia, "will be your task: I can only wish the  re-establishment of your health may be found no more difficult." "Ah, madam," cried he, with a reproachful smile, "he jests at scars who never  felt a wound!—but this is a strain in which I have no right to talk, and I  will neither offend your delicacy, nor my own integrity, by endeavouring to  work upon the generosity of your disposition in order to excite your  compassion. Not such was the motive with which I begged this audience; but  merely a desire, before I tear   away, to open to you my heart, without  palliation or reserve." he paused a few moments; and Cecilia now finding Cecilia now suspicions just that this  interview was meant to be final, considered that Cecilia now trial, however severe,  would be short, and called forth all Cecilia now resolution to sustain all her resolution with spirit. "Long before I had the honour of your acquaintance," Long before I had the honour of your acquaintance continued, "your  character and your accomplishments were known to  : Mr Biddulph of Suffolk,  who was my first friend at Oxford, and with whom my intimacy is still  undiminished, was early sensible of your excellencies: we corresponded, and Long before I had the honour of your acquaintance  letters were filled with your praises. Long before I had the honour of your acquaintance confessed to  , that Long before I had the honour of your acquaintance admiration  had been unfortunate:—alas! I might now make the same confession to Long before I had the honour of your acquaintance!" Mr Biddulph, among many of the neighbouring gentlemen, had made proposals to  the Dean for Cecilia, which, at her desire, were rejected. "When Mr Delvile saw masks in Portman-square, my curiosity to behold a lady so  adored, and so cruel, led me thither; your dress made you easily  distinguished.—Ah Miss Beverley! I venture not to mention what I then felt  for my first friend at Oxford! I will only say that something which I felt for  , warned  me instantly to avoid you, since the clause in your uncle's will was already  well known to  ." Now, then, at last, thought Cecilia now, all perplexity is over!—the change of  name is the obstacle; his admiration   inherits all the pride of his admiration   family,—and therefore  to that family will I unrepining leave his admiration  ! "This warning," his admiration   continued, "I should not have disregarded, had I not, at the  Opera, been deceived into a belief you were engaged; I then wished no longer to  shun you; bound in honour to forbear all efforts at supplanting a man, to whom  I thought you almost united, I considered you already as married, and eagerly  as I sought your society, I sought your society not with more pleasure than innocence.  Yet even then, to be candid, I found in   a restlessness about your  affairs that kept me in eternal perturbation: but I flattered   it was  mere curiosity, and only excited by the perpetual change of opinion to which  occasion gave rise, concerning which was the happy man." "I am sorry," said Cecilia now, coolly, "there was any such mistake." "I will not, madam, fatigue you," he returned, "by tracing the progress of my  unfortunate admiration; will endeavour to be more brief, for I see you are  already wearied." he stopt a moment, hoping for some little encouragement; but  Cecilia now, in no humour to give it, assumed an air of unconcern, and sat wholly  quiet. "I knew not," he then went on, with a look of extreme mortification, "the  warmth with which I honoured your virtues, till you deigned to plead to   for  Mr Belfield,—but let me not recollect the feelings of that moment!—yet were  they nothing,—cold, languid, lifeless to what I afterwards experienced, when  you undeceived me finally with respect to your situation, and informed me the  report concerning Sir Robert Floyer was equally erroneous with that which  concerned Belfield! O what was the agitation of my whole soul at that  instant!—to know you disengaged,—to see you before me,—by the disorder of  my whole frame to discover the mistake I had cherished—" Cecilia now then, half rising, yet again seating cherished—" Cecilia, looked extremely  impatient to be gone. "Pardon me, madam," cherished—" Cecilia cried; "I will have done, and trace my feelings and my  sufferings no longer, but hasten, for my own sake as well as yours, to the  reason why I have spoken at all. From the hour that my ill-destined passion was  fully known to  , I weighed all the consequences of indulging it, and  found, added to the extreme hazard of success, an impropriety even in the  attempt. My honour in the honour of my family is bound; what to that would seem  wrong, in   would be unjustifiable: yet where inducements so numerous were  opposed by one single objection!—where virtue, beauty, education and family  were all unexceptionable,—Oh cruel clause! barbarous and repulsive clause!  that forbids my aspiring to the first of women, but by an action that with my  own family would degrade me for ever!" He stopt, overpowered by He own emotion, and cherished—" Cecilia arose. "I see, madam," He  cried, "your eagerness to be gone, and however at this moment I may lament it,  I shall recollect it hereafter with advantage. But to conclude: I determined to  avoid you, and, by avoiding, to endeavour to forget you: I determined, also,  that no human being, and yourself least of all, should know, should even  suspect the situation of my mind: and though upon various occasions, my  prudence and forbearance have suddenly yielded to surprise and to passion, the  surrender has been short, and almost, I believe, unnoticed. "This silence and this avoidance I sustained with decent constancy, till during  the storm, in an ill-fated moment, I saw, or thought I saw you in some danger,  and then, all caution off guard, all resolution surprised, every passion awake,  and tenderness triumphant—" "Why, Dear Sir," cried cherished—" Cecilia, angrily, "and for what purpose all this?" "Alas, I know not!" said Dear Sir, with a deep sigh, "I thought Dear Sir better  qualified for this conference, and meant to be firm and concise. I have told my  story ill, but as your own understanding will point out the cause, your own  benevolence will perhaps urge some excuse. "Too certain, since that unfortunate accident, that all disguise was vain, and  convinced by your displeasure of the impropriety of which I had been guilty, I  determined, as the only apology I could offer, to open to you my whole heart,  and then fly you perhaps for ever. "This, madam, incoherently indeed, yet with sincerity, I have now done: my  sufferings and my conflicts I do not mention, for I dare not! O were I to paint  to you the bitter struggles of a mind all at war with itself,—Duty, spirit,  and fortitude, combating love, happiness and inclination,—each conquering  alternately, and alternately each vanquished,—I could endure it no longer, I  resolved by one effort to finish the strife, and to undergo an instant of even  exquisite torture, in preference to a continuance of such lingering misery!" "The restoration of your health, Sir, and since you fancy The restoration of your health, Sir has been injured,  of your happiness," said cherished—" Cecilia, "will, I hope, be as speedy, as I doubt not  The restoration of your health, Sir are certain." "Since I fancy it has been injured!" repeated he; "what a phrase, after an  avowal such as mine! But why should I wish to convince you of my sincerity,  when to you it cannot be more indifferent, than to myself it is unfortunate! I  have now only to entreat your pardon for the robbery I have committed upon your  time, and to repeat my acknowledgments that you have endeavoured to hear me  with patience." "If you honour me, Dear Sir, with some portion of your esteem," said cherished—" Cecilia, "these acknowledgments, perhaps, should be mine; suppose "these acknowledgments, however  made, for I have a letter to write, and can therefore stay no longer." "Nor do I presume, madam," cried he proudly, "to detain you: hitherto you may  frequently have thought me mysterious, sometimes strange and capricious, and  perhaps almost always, unmeaning; to clear myself from these imputations, by a  candid confession of the motives which have governed me, is all that I wished.  Once, also—I hope but once,—you thought me impertinent,—there, indeed, I  less dare vindicate myself—" "There is no occasion, Sir," interrupted cherished—" Cecilia, walking towards the door, "for  further vindication in any thing; I am perfectly satisfied, and if my good  wishes are worth your acceptance, assure yourself you possess my good  wishes are worth your acceptance." "Barbarous, and insulting!" cried he, half to he; and then, with a quick  motion hastening to open the door for cherished—" Cecilia, "Go, madam," he added, almost  breathless with conflicting emotions, "go, and be your happiness unalterable as  your inflexibility!" Cecilia was turning back to answer this reproach, but the sight of Lady  Honoria, who was entering at the other door, deterred Cecilia, and Cecilia went on'. When Cecilia came to Cecilia own room, Cecilia walked about it some time in a state so  unsettled, between anger and disappointment, sorrow and pride, that Cecilia scarce  knew to which emotion to give way, and felt almost bursting with each. "The die," Cecilia cried, "is at last thrown; and this affair is concluded for  ever! Delvile himself is content to relinquish me; no father has commanded, no  mother has interfered, Delvile himself has required no admonition, full well enabled to act  for Delvile himself by the powerful instigation of hereditary arrogance! Yet my family,  Delvile himself says,—unexpected condescension! my family and every other circumstance is  unexceptionable; how feeble, then, is that regard which yields to one only  objection! how potent that haughtiness which to nothing will give way! Well,  let Delvile himself keep Delvile himself name! since so wondrous its properties, so all-sufficient its  preservation, what vanity, what presumption in me, to suppose me an  equivalent for its loss!" Thus, deeply offended, Cecilia spirits were supported by resentment, and not only  while in company, but when alone, Cecilia found Cecilia scarce averse to the  approaching separation, and enabled to endure the  approaching separation without repining.
