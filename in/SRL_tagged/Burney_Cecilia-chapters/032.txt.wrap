 In this disposition of mind Cecilia the next morning obeyed the summons of Mr  Delvile, and for the first time went to St James'-square in a humour to look  for evil instead of good, and meanness instead of nobleness. She was shewn into an apartment where she found Mr Delvile alone, and was  received by him, as usual, with the most stately solemnity. When she was seated, "I have given you, Miss Beverley," said he, "the trouble  of calling, in order to discuss with you the internal state of your affairs; a  duty which, at this juncture, I hold to be incumbent upon my character. The  delicacy due to your sex would certainly have induced me to wait upon you  myself for this purpose, but for the reasons I have already hinted to you, of  fearing the people with whom you live might think it necessary to return my  visit. Persons of low origin are commonly in those matters the most forward.  Not, however, that I would prejudice you against them; though, for myself, it  is fit I remember that a general and indiscriminate acquaintance, by levelling  all ranks, does injury to the rites of society." Ah! thought Cecilia, how infallible is Mr Monckton! and how inevitably, in a  family of which Mr Delvile is the head, should I be cruelly held down, as the  disgrace of their alliance! "I have applied," continued he, "to Mrs Delvile, to know if the communication  which I had recommended to you, and to which she had promised her attention,  had yet passed; but I am informed you have not spoken to her upon the subject." "I had nothing, Sir, to communicate," answered Cecilia, "and I had hoped, as  Mrs Delvile made no enquiries, she was satisfied she had nothing to hear." "With respect to enquiries," said Mr Delvile, "I fear you are not sufficiently  aware of the distance between a lady of Mrs Delvile's rank, both by birth and  alliance, and such a young woman as Mrs Harrel, whose ancestors, but a short  time since, were mere Suffolk farmers. But I beg your pardon;—I mean not any  reflection upon yours: I have always heard they were very worthy people. And a  farmer is certainly a very respectable person. Your father, I think, no more  than the Dean your uncle, did nothing in that way himself?" "No, Sir," said Cecilia, drily, and much provoked by this contemptuous courtesy. "I have always been told he was a very good sort of man: I knew none of the  family myself, but the Dean. His connections with the Bishop of ———, my  relation, put him often in my way. Though his naming me for one of his  trustees, I must own, was rather extraordinary; but I mean not to hurt you; on  the contrary, I should be much concerned to give you any uneasiness." Again Mr Monckton arose in the mind of Cecilia, and again she acknowledged the  truth of his strictures; and though she much wondered in what an harangue so  pompous was to end, her disgust so far conquered her curiosity, that without  hearing it, she wished herself away. "To return," said he, "to my purpose. The present period of your life is such  as to render advice particularly seasonable; I am sorry, therefore, as I before  said, you have not disclosed your situation to Mrs Delvile. A young lady on the  point of making an establishment, and with many engagements in her power, is  extremely liable to be mistaken in her judgment, and therefore should solicit  instruction from those who are able to acquaint her what connection would be  most to her advantage. One thing, however, I am happy to commend, the young man  who was wounded in the duel—I cannot recollect his name—is, I hear, totally  out of the question." What next? thought Cecilia; though still she gave him no interruption, for the  haughtiness of his manner was repulsive to reply. "My design, therefore, is to speak to you of Sir Robert Floyer. When I had last  the pleasure of addressing you upon this subject, you may probably remember my  voice was in his favour; but I then regarded him merely as the rival of an  inconsiderable young man, to rescue you from whom he appeared an eligible  person. The affair is now altered, that young man is thought of no more, and  another rival comes forward, to whom Sir Robert is as inconsiderable as the  first rival was to Sir Robert." Cecilia started at this information, livelier sensations stimulated her  curiosity, and surmises in which she was most deeply interested quickened her  attention. "This rival," proceeded he, "I should imagine no young lady would a moment  hesitate in electing; he is every way the superior of Sir Robert except in  fortune, and the deficiencies of that the splendour of your own may amply  supply." The deepest crimson now tinged the cheeks of Cecilia; the prophecy of Mr  Monckton seemed immediately fulfilling, and she trembled with a rising conflict  between her approbation of the offer, and her dread of its consequences. "I know not, indeed," continued he, "in what estimation you may have been  accustomed to hold rank and connection, nor whether you are impressed with a  proper sense of their superiority and value; for early prejudices are not  easily rooted out, and those who have lived chiefly with monied people, regard  even birth itself as unimportant when compared with wealth." The colour which first glowed in the cheeks of Cecilia from expectation, now  rose yet higher from resentment: she thought herself already insulted by a  prelude so ostentatious and humiliating to the proposals which were to follow;  and she angrily determined, with whatever pain to her heart, to assert her own  dignity by refusing them at once, too well satisfied by what she now saw of the  present, that Mr Monckton had been just in his prediction of the future. "Your rejection, therefore," continued he, "of this honourable offer, may  perhaps have been merely the consequence of the principles in which you have  been educated.—" "Rejection?" interrupted Cecilia, amazed, "what rejection, Sir?" "Have you not refused the proposals of my Lord Ernolf for his son?" "Lord Ernolf? never! nor have I ever seen either his Lordship or his son but in  public." "That," replied Mr Delvile, "is little to the purpose; where the connexion is a  proper one, a young lady of delicacy has only to accede to it. But though this  rejection came not immediately from yourself, it had doubtless your  concurrence." "It had not, Sir, even my knowledge." "Your alliance then with Sir Robert Floyer is probably nearer a conclusion than  I had imagined, for otherwise Mr Harrel would not, without consulting you, have  given the Earl so determinate an answer." "No, Sir," said Cecilia, impatiently, "my alliance with him was never more  distant, nor do I mean it should ever approach more near." She was now little disposed for further conversation. Her heroic design of  refusing young Delvile by no means reconciled her to the discovery she now made  that he had not meant to address her; and though she was provoked and fretted  at this new proof that Mr Harrel scrupled neither assertions nor actions to  make her engagement with Sir Robert credited, her disappointment in finding  that Mr Delvile, instead of pleading the cause of his son, was exerting his  interest for another person, affected her so much more nearly, that  notwithstanding he still continued his parading harangue, she scarcely knew  even the subject of his discourse, and seized the first opportunity of a  cessation to rise and take her leave. He asked her if she would not call upon Mrs Delvile; but desirous to be alone,  she declined the invitation; he then charged her to proceed no further with Sir  Robert till he had made some enquiries concerning Lord Ernolf, and graciously  promising his protection and counsel, suffered her to depart. Cecilia now perceived she might plan her rejections, or study her dignity at  her leisure, for neither Mr Delvile nor his son seemed in any haste to put her  fortitude to the proof. With regard, therefore, to their plots and intentions,  Mr Monckton she found was wrong, but with respect to their conduct and  sentiments, she had every reason to believe him right: and though her heart  refused to rejoice in escaping a trial of its strength, her judgment was so  well convinced that his painting was from the life, that she determined to  conquer her partiality for young Delvile, since she looked forward to nothing  but mortification in a connexion with his family.
