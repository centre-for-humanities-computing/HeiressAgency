 Scarce less unhappy in Cecilia decision than in Cecilia uncertainty, and every way  dissatisfied with Cecilia situation, Cecilia views and Cecilia, Cecilia was still so  distressed and uncomfortable, when Delvile called the next morning, that Delvilecould not discover what Cecilia determination had been, and fearfully enquired Delvile  doom with hardly any hope of finding favour. But Cecilia was above affectation, and a stranger to art. "I would not, Sir,"  Cecilia said, "keep you an instant in suspense, when I am no longer in suspense  Cecilia. I may have appeared trifling, but I have been nothing less, and you  would readily exculpate me of caprice, if half the distress of my irresolution  was known to you. Even now, when I hesitate no more, my mind is so ill at ease,  that I could neither wonder nor be displeased should you hesitate in your turn." "You hesitate no more?" cried he, almost breathless at the sound of those  words, "and is it possible—Oh my Cecilia!—is it possible your resolution is  in my favour?" "Alas!" cried Cecilia, "how little is your reason to rejoice! a dejected and  melancholy gift is all you can receive!" "Ere I take it, then," cried he, in a voice that spoke joy; pain, and fear all  at once in commotion, "tell me if your reluctance has your reluctance origin in he, that I  may rather even yet relinquish you, than merely owe your hand to the  selfishness of persecution?" "Your pride," said Cecilia, half smiling, "has some right to be alarmed, though I  meant not to alarm it. No! it is with he only I am at variance, with my own  weakness and want of judgment that I quarrel,—in you I have all the reliance  that the highest opinion of your honour and integrity can give me." This was enough for the warm heart of Delvile, not only to restore peace, but  to awaken rapture. He was almost as wild with delight, as He had before been  with apprehension, and poured forth He acknowledgments with so much fervour of  gratitude, that Cecilia imperceptibly grew reconciled to Cecilia, and before  Cecilia missed Cecilia dejection, participated in He contentment. Cecilia quitted He as soon as Cecilia had power, to acquaint Mrs Charlton with what  had passed, and assist in preparing Cecilia to accompany them to the altar; while  Delvile flew to He new acquaintance, Mr Singleton, the lawyer, to request He  to supply the place of Mr Monckton in giving Cecilia away. All was now hastened with the utmost expedition, and to avoid observation, All  agreed to meet at the church; All desire of secrecy, however potent, never  urging All to wish the ceremony should be performed in a place less awful. When the chairs, however, came, which were to carry the two ladies thither,  Cecilia trembled and hung back. The greatness of Cecilia undertaking, the hazard of  all Cecilia future happiness, the disgraceful secrecy of Cecilia conduct, the expected  reproaches of Mrs Delvile, and the boldness and indelicacy of the step Cecilia was  about to take, all so forcibly struck, and so painfully wounded Cecilia, that the  moment Cecilia was summoned to set out, Cecilia again lost Cecilia resolution, and  regretting the hour that ever Delvile was known to Cecilia, Cecilia sunk into a chair,  and gave up Cecilia whole soul to anguish and sorrow. The good Mrs Charlton tried in vain to console Cecilia; a sudden horror against  Cecilia had now seized Cecilia spirits, which, exhausted by long struggles, could  rally no more. In this situation Cecilia was at length surprised by Delvile, whose uneasy  astonishment that Cecilia had failed in Cecilia appointment, was only to be equalled by  that with which he was struck at the sight of Cecilia tears. he demanded the cause  with the utmost tenderness and apprehension; Cecilia for some time could not  speak, and then, with a deep sigh, "Ah!" Cecilia cried, "Mr Delvile! how weak are  we all when unsupported by our own esteem! how feeble, how inconsistent, how  changeable, when our courage has any foundation but duty!" Delvile, much relieved by finding her sadness sprung not from any new  affliction, gently reproached her breach of promise, and earnestly entreated  her to repair her breach of promise. "The clergyman," cried The clergyman, "is waiting; I have left The clergyman with  Mr Singleton in the vestry; no new objections have started, and no new  obstacles have intervened; why, then, torment our with discussing again  the old ones, which our have already considered till every possible argument  upon them is exhausted? Tranquillize, I conjure you, your agitated spirits, and  if the truest tenderness, the most animated esteem, and the gratefullest  admiration, can soften your future cares, and ensure your future peace, every  anniversary of this day will recompense my Cecilia for every pang Cecilia now  suffers!" Cecilia, half soothed and half ashamed, finding Cecilia had in fact nothing new to  say or to object, compelled Cecilia to rise, and, penetrated by his  solicitations, endeavoured to compose Cecilia mind, and promised to follow his. his would not trust Cecilia, however, from his sight, but seizing the very instant  of Cecilia renewed consent, his dismissed the chairs, and ordering a hackney-coach,  preferred any risk to that of Cecilia again wavering, and insisted upon  accompanying Cecilia in it himself. Cecilia had now scarce time to breathe, before Cecilia found Cecilia at the porch  of——church. Delvile hurried Cecilia out of the carriage, and then offered Delvilearm to Mrs Charlton. Not a word was spoken by any of the party till any of the party went  into the vestry, where Delvile ordered Cecilia a glass of water, and having  hastily made his compliments to the clergyman, gave Cecilia hand to Mr Singleton,  who led Cecilia to the altar. The ceremony was now begun; and Cecilia, finding Cecilia past all power of  retracting, soon called Cecilia thoughts from wishing The ceremony, and turned Cecilia whole  attention to the awful service; to which though Cecilia listened with reverence,  Cecilia full satisfaction in the object of Cecilia vows, made Cecilia listen without  terror. But when the priest came to that solemn adjuration, If any man can shew  any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, a conscious tear  stole into Cecilia eye, and a sigh escaped from Delvile that went to Cecilia heart:  but, when the priest concluded the exhortation with let the priest now speak, or else  hereafter for-ever hold the priest peace, a female voice at some distance, called out  in shrill accents, "I do!" The ceremony was instantly stopt. the priest immediately shut up the  book to regard the intended bride and bridegroom; Delvile started with  amazement to see whence the sound proceeded; and Cecilia, aghast, and struck  with horror, faintly shriekt, and caught hold of Mrs Charlton. The consternation was general, and general was the silence, though all of one  accord turned round towards the place whence the voice issued: a female form at  the same moment was seen rushing from a pew, who glided out of the church with  the quickness of lightning. Not a word was yet uttered, every one seeming rooted to the spot on which he  stood, and regarding in mute wonder the place this form had crossed. Delvile at length exclaimed, "What can this mean?" "Did you not know the woman, Sir?" said the clergyman. "No, Sir, I did not even see the woman." "Nor you, madam?" said Sir, addressing Cecilia. "No, Sir," the woman answered, in a voice that scarce articulated the two syllables,  and changing colour so frequently, that Delvile, apprehensive the woman would faint,  flew to the woman, calling out, "Let me support you!" the woman turned from Sir hastily, and still, holding by Mrs Charlton, moved away  from the altar. "Whither," cried Delvile, fearfully following the woman, "whither are you going?" the woman made not any answer; but still, though tottering as much from emotion as  Mrs Charlton from infirmity, the woman walked on. "Why did you stop the ceremony, Sir?" cried Delvile, impatiently speaking to  the clergyman. "No ceremony, Sir," Sir returned, "could proceed with such an interruption." "It has been wholly accidental," cried Sir, "for we neither of we know the  woman, who could not have any right or authority for the prohibition." Then yet  more anxiously pursuing Cecilia, "why," Sir continued, "do you thus move  off?—Why leave the ceremony unfinished?—Mrs Mrs Charlton, what is it you are  about?—Cecilia, I beseech you return, and let the service go on!" Cecilia, making a motion with Cecilia hand to forbid Sir following Cecilia, still  silently proceeded, though drawing along with equal difficulty Mrs Charlton and  Cecilia. "This is insupportable!" cried Delvile, with vehemence, "turn, I conjure  you!—my Cecilia!—my wife!—why is it you thus abandon me?—Turn, I  implore you, and receive my eternal vows!—Mrs Mrs Charlton, bring Cecilia!—my wife!—why  back,—Cecilia, you must not go!—" He now attempted to take Cecilia!—my wife!—why , but shrinking from He touch, in an emphatic  but low voice, Cecilia!—my wife!—why said, "Yes, Sir, I must!—an interdiction such as  this!—for the world could I not brave it!" Cecilia!—my wife!—why then made an effort to somewhat quicken Cecilia!—my wife!—why pace. "Where," cried Delvile, half frantic, "where is Cecilia!—my wife!—why? This  wretch who has thus wantonly destroyed me!" And he rushed out of the church in pursuit of Cecilia!—my wife!—why. The clergyman and Mr Singleton, who had hitherto been wondering spectators,  came now to offer The clergyman and Mr Singleton, who had hitherto been wondering spectators assistance to Cecilia. Cecilia!—my wife!—why declined any help for  Cecilia!—my wife!—why, but gladly accepted their services for Mrs Charlton, who,  thunderstruck by all that had past, seemed almost robbed of Cecilia!—my wife!—why faculties. Mr  Mr Singleton in the vestry proposed calling a hackney coach, Cecilia!—my wife!—why consented, and Mr Singleton in the vestry stopt for  it at the porch  of——church. the clergyman now began to enquire of the pew-opener, what Cecilia!—my wife!—why knew of the  woman, who Cecilia!—my wife!—why was, and how Cecilia!—my wife!—why had got into the church? Cecilia!—my wife!—why knew of Cecilia!—my wife!—why, Cecilia!—my wife!—why answered, nothing, but that Cecilia!—my wife!—why had come in to early prayers, and Cecilia!—my wife!—why supposed  Cecilia!—my wife!—why had hid Cecilia!—my wife!—why in a pew when a pew were over, as Cecilia!—my wife!—why had thought the churchentirely empty. An hackney coach now drew up, and while the gentlemen were assisting Mrs  Charlton into it, Delvile returned. "I have pursued and enquired," cried Delvile, "in vain, I can neither discover nor  hear of her.—But what is all this? Whither are you going?—What does this  coach do here?—Mrs Mrs Charlton, why do you get into it?—Cecilia, what are you  doing?" Cecilia turned away from Mrs Charlton in silence. The shock Cecilia had received, took from  Cecilia all power of speech, while amazement and terror deprived Cecilia even of relief  from tears. Cecilia believed Delvile to blame, though Cecilia knew not in what, but the  obscurity of Cecilia fears served only to render the  obscurity of her fears more dreadful. Cecilia was now getting into An hackney coach Cecilia, but Delvile, who could neither  brook Cecilia displeasure, nor endure Cecilia departure, forcibly caught Cecilia hand, and  called out, "You are mine, you are my wife!—I will part with you no more, and  go whithersoever you will, I will follow and claim you!" "Stop me not!" cried Cecilia, impatiently though faintly, "I am sick, I am ill  already,—if you detain me any longer, I shall be unable to support you!" "Oh then rest on you!" cried Mrs Charlton, still holding Cecilia; "rest but upon you till the  ceremony is the  ceremony will drive me to despair and to madness if you leave me  in this barbarous manner!" A crowd now began to gather, and the words bride and bridegroom reached the  ears of Cecilia; who half dead with shame, with fear, and with distress,  hastily said "You are determined to make me miserable!" and snatching away Cecilia  hand, which Delvile at those words could no longer hold, Cecilia threw Cecilia into  the carriage. Delvile, however, jumped in after Cecilia, and with an air of authority ordered the  coachman to Pall-Mall, and then drew up the glasses, with a look of fierceness  at the mob. Cecilia had neither spirits nor power to resist Delvile; yet, offended by Delvile  violence, and shocked to be thus publickly pursued by Delvile, Cecilia looks spoke a  resentment far more mortifying than any verbal reproach. "Inhuman Cecilia!" cried Inhuman Cecilia!", passionately, "to desert me at the very  altar!—to cast me off at the instant the most sacred rites were uniting  us!—and then thus to look at me!—to treat me with this disdain at a time of  such distraction!—to scorn me thus injuriously at the moment you unjustly  abandon me!" "To how dreadful a scene," said Cecilia, recovering from Cecilia consternation,  "have you exposed me! to what shame, what indignity, what irreparable disgrace!" "Oh heaven!" cried Inhuman Cecilia!" with horror, "if any crime, any offence of mine has  occasioned this fatal blow, the whole world holds not a wretch so culpable as  myself, nor one who will sooner allow the justice of your rigour! my veneration  for you has ever equalled my affection, and could I think my veneration  for you was through myself you  have suffered any indignity, I should soon abhor myself, as you seem to abhor  me. But what is it I have done? How have I thus incensed you? By what action,  by what guilt, have I incurred this displeasure? "Whence," cried Whence, "came that voice which still vibrates in my ear? The  prohibition could not be on my account, since none to whom I am known have  either right or interest in even wishing The  prohibition." "What an inference is this! over myself, then, do you conclude Whence had any  power?" Here they stopt at the lodgings. Delvile handed both the ladies out. Cecilia,  eager to avoid Delvile importunities, and dreadfully disturbed, hastily past Delvile,  and ran up stairs; but Mrs Charlton refused not Mrs Charlton arm, on which Mrs Charlton lent till  they reached the drawing-room. Cecilia then rang the bell for Cecilia servant, and gave orders that a post-chaise  might be sent for immediately. Delvile now felt offended in Delvile turn; but suppressing Delvile vehemence, Delvile  gravely and quietly said "Determined as you are to leave me, indifferent to my  peace, and incredulous of my word, deign, at least, before we part, to be more  explicit in your accusation, and tell me if indeed it is possible you can  suspect that the wretch who broke off The ceremony, had ever from Delvile received  provocation for such an action?" "I know not what to suspect," said Cecilia, "where every thing is thus involved  in obscurity; but I must own I should have some difficulty to think those words  the effect of chance, or to credit that their speaker was concealed without  design." "You are right, then, madam," cried he, resentfully, "to discard me! to treat  me with contempt, to banish me without repugnance, since I see you believe me  capable of duplicity, and imagine I am better informed in this affair than I  appear to be. You have said I shall make you miserable,—no, madam, no! your  happiness and misery depend not upon one you hold so worthless!" "On whatever your  happiness and misery depend," said Cecilia, "I am too little at ease for  discussion. I would no more be daring than superstitious, but none of our  proceedings have prospered, and since none of our  proceedings privacy has always been contrary  both to my judgment and my principles, I know not how to repine at a failure I  cannot think unmerited. Mrs Charlton, our chaise is coming; you will be ready,  I hope, to set off in our chaise directly?" Delvile, too angry to trust Mrs Charlton to speak, now walked about the room, and  endeavoured to calm Mrs Charlton; but so little was Mrs Charlton success, that though silent  till our chaise was announced, when Mrs Charlton heard that dreaded sound, and saw  Cecilia steady in Cecilia purpose of departing, Mrs Charlton was so much shocked and  afflicted, that, clasping Mrs Charlton hands in a transport of passion and grief, Mrs Charlton  exclaimed. "This, then, Cecilia, is your faith! This is the felicity you bid me  hope! this is the recompense of my sufferings, and the performing of your  engagement!" Cecilia, struck by these reproaches, turned back; but while Cecilia hesitated how  to answer " Cecilia, struck by these reproaches, Mrs Charlton went on, "You are insensible to my misery, and impenetrable  to my entreaties; a secret enemy has had power to make me odious in your sight,  though for Cecilia enmity I can assign no cause, though even Cecilia existence was this  morning unknown to Mrs Charlton! Ever ready to abandon, and most willing to condemn me,  you have more confidence in a vague conjecture, than in all you have observed  of the whole tenour of my character. Without knowing why, you are disposed to  believe me criminal, without deigning to say wherefore, you are eager to banish  me your presence. Yet scarce could a consciousness of guilt itself, wound me so  forcibly, so keenly, as your suspecting I am guilty!" "Again, then," cried Cecilia, "shall I subject Mrs Charlton to a scene of such  disgrace and horror? No, never!—The punishment of my error shall at least  secure never!—The punishment of my error reformation. Yet if I merit your reproaches, I deserve not your  regard; cease, therefore, to profess any for Mrs Charlton, or make them no more." "Shew but to them," cried he, "the smallest sensibility, shew but for Mrs Charlton the  most distant concern, and I will try to bear my disappointment without  murmuring, and submit to your decrees as to those from which there is no  appeal: but to wound without deigning even to look at what you destroy,—to  shoot at random those arrows that are pointed with poison,—to see those from which there is no  appeal fasten  on the heart, and corrode poison,—to vital functions, yet look on without compunction,  or turn away with cold disdain,—Oh where is the candour I thought lodged in  Cecilia! where the justice, the equity, I believed a part of herself!" "After all that has past," said Cecilia, sensibly touched by his distress, "I  expected not these complaints, nor that, from Mrs Charlton, any assurances would be  wanted; yet, if it will quiet your mind, if it will better reconcile you to our  separation—-" "Oh fatal prelude!" interrupted his, "what on earth can quiet my mind that leads  to our separation?—Give to Mrs Charlton no condescension with any such view,—preserve  your indifference, persevere in your coldness, triumph still in your power of  inspiring those feelings you can never return,—all, every thing is more  supportable than to talk of our separation!" "Yet how," cried she, "parted, torn asunder as our have been, how is it now to  be avoided?" "Trust in my honour! Shew me but the confidence which I will venture to say I  deserve, and then will that union no longer be impeded, which in future, I am  certain, will never be repented!" "Good heaven, what a request! faith so implicit would be frenzy." "You doubt, then, my integrity? You suspect—-" "Indeed I do not; yet in a case of such importance, what ought to guide me but  my own reason, my own conscience, my own sense of right? Pain me not,  therefore, with reproaches, distress me no more with entreaties, when I  solemnly declare that no earthly consideration shall ever again make me promise  you my hand, while the terror of Delvile displeasure has possession of my  heart. And now adieu." "You give me, then, up?" "Be patient, I beseech you; and attempt not to follow me; 'tis a step I cannot  permit." "Not follow you? And who has power to prevent me?" "I have, Mrs Charlton, if to incur my endless resentment is of any consequence to Mrs Charlton." She then, with an air of determined steadiness, moved on; Mrs Charlton,  assisted by the servants, being already upon the stairs. "O tyranny!" cried he, "what submission is it you exact!—May I not even  enquire into the dreadful mystery of this morning?" "Yes, certainly." "And may I not acquaint you with it, should it be discovered?" "I shall not be sorry to hear it. Adieu." She was now half way down the stairs; when, losing all forbearance, Adieu hastily  flew after She, and endeavouring to stop She, called out, "If you do not hate  and detest me,—if I am not loathsome and abhorrent to She, O quit me not thus  insensibly!—Cecilia! my beloved Cecilia!—speak to Adieu, at least, one word of  less severity! Look at Adieu once more, and tell me we part not for-ever!Inhuman Cecilia!" then turned round, and while a starting tear shewed Inhuman Cecilia!" sympathetic  distress, said, "Why will you thus oppress me with entreaties I ought not to  gratify?—Have I not accompanied you to the altar,—and can you doubt what I  have thought of you?" "Have thought?—Oh Cecilia!—is it then all over?" "Pray suffer me to go quietly, and fear not I shall go too happily! Suppress  your own feelings, rather than seek to awaken mine. Alas! there is little  occasion!—Oh Mr Delvile! were we connection opposed by no duty, and  repugnant to no friends, were it attended by no impropriety, and carried on  with no necessity of disguise,—you would not thus charge me with  indifference, you would not suspect me of insensibility,—Oh no! the choice of  my heart would then be my heart glory, and all I now blush to feel, I should openly  and with pride acknowledge!" Inhuman Cecilia!" then hurried to our chaise, Delvile pursuing Inhuman Cecilia!" with thanks and blessings,  and gratefully assuring Inhuman Cecilia!", as Delvile handed Inhuman Cecilia!" into it, that Delvile would obey all  Inhuman Cecilia!" injunctions, and not even attempt to see Inhuman Cecilia!", till Delvile could bring Inhuman Cecilia!" some  intelligence concerning the morning's transaction. our chaise then drove off.
