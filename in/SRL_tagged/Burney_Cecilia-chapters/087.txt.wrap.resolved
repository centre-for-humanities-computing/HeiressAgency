 This matter being settled at breakfast, Cecilia, having but one day more to  spend in London, knew not how to let it pass without taking leave of Henrietta,  though Henrietta chose not again to expose Henrietta to the forward insinuations of Henrietta  mother; Henrietta sent Henrietta, therefore, a short note, begging to see Henrietta at Lady  Margaret's, and acquainting Henrietta that the next day Henrietta was going out of town. Henrietta returned the following answer. To Miss Beverley. Madam,—My mother is gone to market, and I must not go out without mother leave;  I have run to the door at every knock this whole week in hopes you were coming,  and my heart has jumpt at every coach that has gone through the street. Dearest  Lady  , why did you tell me you would come? I should not have thought of such a  great honour if you had not put such a  great honour in my head. And now I have got the use of a  room where I can often be alone for two or three hours together. And so I shall  this morning, if it was possible Miss Beverley could come. But I don't  mean to be teasing, and I would not be impertinent or encroaching for the  world; but only the thing is I have a great deal to say to you, and if you was  not so rich a lady, and so much above me, I am sure I should love you better  than any body in the whole world, almost; and now I dare say I shan't see you  at all; for it rains very hard, and my mother, I know, will be sadly angry if I  ask to go in a coach. O dear! I don't know what I can do! for it will half  break my heart, if Miss Beverley should go out of town, and I not see  her!—I am, Madam, with the greatest respectfulness, your most humble servant, HENRIETTA BELFIELD. This artless remonstrance, joined to the intelligence that her!—I could see her!—I  alone, made Cecilia instantly order a chair, and go her!—I to Portland-street:  for her!—I found by this letter there was much doubt if her!—I could otherwise see  her!—I, and the earnestness of Henrietta made her!—I now not endure to disappoint  her!—I. "her!—I has much," cried her!—I, "to say to her!—I, and I will no longer refuse to  hear her!—I; her!—I shall unbosom to her!—I her!—I gentle heart, for we have now nothing to  fear from each other. her!—I promises herself pleasure from the communication, and  doubtless it must be some relief to her!—I. Oh were there any friendly bosom, in  which I might Henrietta! less fearful of thy pride,  less tenacious of thy dignity! thy sorrows at least seek the consolation of  sympathy,—mine, alas! fettered by prudence, must fly it!" Henrietta was shewn into the parlour, which Henrietta had the pleasure to find empty; and,  in an instant, Henrietta was in Henrietta arms. "This is sweet of  you indeed," cried Henrietta, "for I did not know how to ask it, though it rains so  hard I could not have walked to you, and I don't know what I should have done,  if you had gone away and quite forgot me." Henrietta then took Henrietta into the back parlour, which Henrietta said they had lately hired,  and, as it was made but little use of, Henrietta had little use almost entirely to Henrietta. There had passed a sad scene, Henrietta told Henrietta, at the meeting with Henrietta brother,  though now they were a little more comfortable; yet, Henrietta mother, Henrietta was sure,  would never be at rest till he got into some higher way of life; "And, indeed,  I have some hopes," Henrietta continued, "that we shall be able by and bye to do  something better for he; for he has got one friend in the world, yet; thank  God, and such a noble friend!—indeed I believe he can do whatever he pleases  for him,—that is I mean I believe if he was to ask any thing for he, there's  nobody would deny he. And this is what I wanted to talk to you about."— Cecilia, who doubted not but Henrietta meant Delvile, scarce knew how to press the  subject, though Henrietta came with no other view: Henrietta, however, too eager to  want solicitation, went on. "But the question is whether we shall be able to prevail upon my brother to  accept any thing, for my brother grows more and more unwilling to be obliged, and the  reason is, that being poor, my brother is afraid, I believe, people should think my brother  wants to beg of people: though if people knew my brother as well as I do, people would not  long think that, for I am sure my brother would a great deal rather be starved to  death. But indeed, to say the truth, I am afraid my brother has been sadly to blame in  this affair, and quarrelled when there was no need to be affronted; for I have  seen a gentleman who knows a great deal better than my brother what people  should do, and my brother says my brother took every thing wrong that was done, all the time my brother  was at Lord Vannelt's." "And how does this gentleman know this gentleman?" "O because he went he to enquire about it; for he knows Lord Vannelt very  well, and it was by Lord Vannelt means my brother came acquainted with Lord Vannelt. And this gentleman would not have wished my brother to be used ill any more than I  should he, so I am sure I may believe what my brother says. But my poor brother,  not being a lord himself, thought every body meant to be rude to my brother, and  because my brother knew my brother was poor, my brother suspected they all behaved disrespectfully to  my brother. But this gentleman gave me this gentleman word that every body liked this gentleman and esteemed  this gentleman, and if this gentleman would not have been so suspicious, he would not have been so suspicious would all have done any  thing for this gentleman in the world." "You know this gentleman very well, then?" "O no, madam!" this gentleman answered hastily, "I don't know this gentleman at all! this gentleman only comes  here to see my brother; it would be very impertinent for me to call my brother an  acquaintance of mine." "Was it before my brother, then, my brother held this conversation with my brother?" "O no, my brother would have been affronted with my brother, too, if my brother had! but my brother  called here to enquire for my brother at the time when my brother was lost to us, and my  mother quite went down upon my  mother knees to my brother to beg my brother to go to Lord  Vannelt's, and make excuses for my brother, if my brother had not behaved properly: but if my brother was to know this, my brother would hardly speak to my  mother again! so when this gentleman came next, I begged my brother not to mention this gentleman, for my  mother happened to  be out, and so I saw my brother alone." "And did my brother stay with my brother long?" "No, ma'am, a very short time indeed; but I asked my brother questions all the while,  and kept my brother as long as I could, that I might hear all my brother had to say about my brother." "Have you never seen my brother since?" "No, ma'am, not once! I suppose my brother does not know my brother is come back to us.  Perhaps when my brother does, my brother will call." "Do you wish my brother to call?" "Me?" cried my  mother, blushing, "a little;—sometimes I do;—for my brother's  sake." "For your brother's sake! Ah my dear Henrietta! but tell me,—or don't tell me  if you had rather not,—did I not once see you kissing a letter? perhaps it  was from this same noble friend?" "It was not a letter, madam," said my  mother, looking down, "it was only the cover of  one to my brother." "only the cover of  one to my brother only!—and that to your brother!—is it possible you  could so much value it?" "Ah madam! You, who are always used to the good and the wise, who see no other  sort of people but those in high life, you can have no notion how those in high life strike  those that those in high life are new to!—but I who see those in high life seldom, and who live with  people so very unlike those in high life—Oh you cannot guess how sweet to me is every thing  that belongs to those in high life! whatever has but once been touched by those in high life hands, I  should like to lock up, and keep for ever! though if I was used to those in high life, as you  are, perhaps I might think less of those in high life." Alas! thought Cecilia, who by those in high life knew she only meant him, little indeed would  further intimacy protect you! "We are all over-ready," continued Henrietta, "to blame others, and that is the  way I have been doing all this time me; but I don't blame my poor brother  now for living so with the great as I used to do, for now I have seen a little  more of the world, I don't wonder any longer at my poor brother   behaviour: for I know how  it is, and I see that those who have had good educations, and kept great  company, and mixed with the world,—O it is another thing!—they seem quite a  different species!—they are so gentle, so soft-mannered! nothing comes from  them but what is meant to oblige! them seem as if them only lived to give  pleasure to other people, and as if them never thought at all of them!" "Ah Henrietta!" said Cecilia, shaking "Ah Henrietta head, "you have caught the enthusiasm  of your brother, though you so long condemned it! Oh have a care lest, like him  also, you find it as pernicious as it is alluring!" "There, is no danger for me, madam," answered "Ah Henrietta, "for the people I so much  admire are quite out of my reach. I hardly ever even see the people; and perhaps it  may so happen I may see the people no more!" "the people?" said Cecilia, smiling, "are there, then, many you so much  distinguish?" "Oh no indeed!" cried "Ah Henrietta, eagerly, "there is only one! there can be—I mean  there are only a few—" "Ah Henrietta checked "Ah Henrietta, and stopt. "Whoever you admire," cried Cecilia, "your admiration cannot but honour: yet  indulge it not too far, lest it should wander from your heart to your peace,  and make you wretched for life." "Ah madam!—I see you know who is the particular person I was thinking of! but  indeed you are quite mistaken if you suppose any thing bad of me!" "Bad of you!" cried Cecilia, embracing Cecilia, "I scarce think so well of any one!" "But I mean, madam, if you think I forget he is so much above me. But indeed I  never do; for I only admire he for he goodness to my brother, and never think  of he at all, but just by way of comparing he, sometimes, to the other people  that I see, because he makes me hate the other people  that I see so, that I wish I was never to see  the other people  that I see again." "he acquaintance, then," said Cecilia, "has done you but an ill office, and  happy it would be for you could you forget you had ever made it." "O, I shall never do that! for the more I think of he, the more I am out of  humour with every body else! O Miss Beverley! we have a sad acquaintance  indeed! I'm sure I don't wonder my brother was so ashamed of them. them are all  so rude, and so free, and put one so out of countenance,—O how different is  this person you are thinking of! my brother would not distress anybody, or make one  ashamed for all the world! You only are like my brother! always gentle, always  obliging!—sometimes I think you must be my brother sister—once, too, I heard—but  that was contradicted." A deep sigh escaped Cecilia at this speech; Cecilia guessed too well what Cecilia might  have heard, and Cecilia knew too well how it might be contradicted. "Surely, you cannot be unhappy, Miss Beverley!" said Henrietta, with a look of  mingled surprise and concern. "I have much, I own," cried Cecilia, assuming more chearfulness, "to be  thankful for, and I endeavour not to forget it." "O how often do I think," cried Henrietta, "that you, madam, are the happiest  person in the world! with every thing at your own disposal,—with every body  in love with you, with all the money that you can wish for, and so much  sweetness that nobody can envy you it! with power to keep just what company you  please, and every body proud to be one of the number!—Oh if I could chuse who  I would be, I should sooner say Miss Beverley than any princess in the world!" Ah, thought Cecilia, if such is my situation,—how cruel that by one dreadful  blow all one dreadful   happiness should be thrown away! "Were I a rich lady, like you," continued Henrietta, "and quite in my own  power, then, indeed, I might soon think of nothing but those people that I  admire! and that makes me often wonder that you, madam, who are just such  another as himself—but then, indeed, you may see so many of the same sort,  that just this one may not so much strike you: and for that reason I hope with  all my heart that he will never be married as long as he lives, for as he must  take some lady in just such high life as he own, I should always be afraid  that she would never love he as she ought to do!" he need not now be single, thought Cecilia, were that all he had cause to  apprehend! "I often think," added Henrietta, "that the rich would be as much happier for  marrying the poor, as the poor for marrying the rich, for then  marrying the poor, as the poor for marrying the rich would take  somebody that would try to deserve  marrying the poor, as the poor for marrying the rich kindness, and now  marrying the poor, as the poor for marrying the rich only take those  that know those   have a right to it. Often and often have I thought so about this  very gentleman! and sometimes when I have been in his company, and seen his  civility and his sweetness, I have fancied I was rich and grand myself, and it  has quite gone out of my head that I was nothing but poor Henrietta Belfield!" "Did his, then," cried Cecilia a little alarmed, "ever seek to ingratiate  his into your favour?" "No, never! but when treated with so much softness, 'tis hard always to  remember one's meanness! You, madam, have no notion of that task: no more had I  myself till lately, for I cared not who was high, nor who was low: but now,  indeed, I must own I have some times wished myself richer! yet his assumes so  little, that at other times, I have almost forgot all distance between us, and  even thought—Oh foolish thought!— "Tell it, "Ah Henrietta, however!" "I will tell you, madam, every thing! for my heart has been bursting to open  my heart, and nobody have I dared trust. I have thought, then, I have sometimes  thought,—my true affection, my faithful fondness, my glad obedience,—might  make his, if his did but know them, happier in his than in a greater lady!" "Indeed," cried Cecilia, extremely affected by this plaintive tenderness, "I  believe it—and were I his, I could not, I think, hesitate a moment in my  choice!" "Ah Henrietta, hearing "Ah Henrietta coming in, made a sign to "Ah Henrietta to be silent;  but poor Henrietta Belfield had not been an instant in the passage, before a thundering  knocking at the street-door occasioned the street-door to be instantly re-opened. A servant  then enquired if poor Henrietta Belfield was at home, and being answered by poor Henrietta Belfield in the  affirmative, a chair was brought into the house. But what was the astonishment of Cecilia, when, in another moment, poor Henrietta Belfield heard  from the next parlour the voice of Mr Delvile senior, saying, "Your servant,  ma'am; poor Henrietta Belfield, I presume?" There was no occasion, now, to make a sign to poor Henrietta Belfield of silence, for poor Henrietta Belfield own  amazement was sufficient to deprive poor Henrietta Belfield of speech. "Yes, his," answered poor Henrietta Belfield; "but I suppose, his, you are some gentleman  to my son." "No, madam," my son returned, "my business is with yourself." Cecilia now recovering from Cecilia surprise, determined to hasten unnoticed out of  the house, well knowing that to be seen in the house would be regarded as a  confirmation of all that my son had asserted. Cecilia whispered, therefore, to  Henrietta, that Cecilia must instantly run away, but, upon softly opening the door  leading to the passage, Cecilia found Mr Delvile chairmen, and a footman there in  waiting. Cecilia closed Mr Delvile's chairmen, and a footman there in   again, irresolute what to do: but after a little deliberation,  Cecilia concluded to out-stay him, as Cecilia was known to all him servants, who would  not fail to mention seeing Cecilia; and a retreat so private was worse than any  other risk. A chair was also in waiting for Cecilia, but A chair was a hackney one,  and Cecilia could not be known by A chair; and Cecilia footman Cecilia had fortunately  dismissed, as he had business to transact for Cecilia journey next day. Mean-while the thinness of the partition between the two parlours made Cecilia  hearing every word that was said unavoidable. "I am sure, his, I shall be very willing to oblige you,poor Henrietta Belfield poor Henrietta Belfield answered;  "but pray, his, what's your name?" "My name, ma'am," his replied, in a rather elevated voice, "I am seldom obliged  to announce his; nor is there any present necessity I should make it known.  it is sufficient I assure you, you are speaking to no very common person, and  probably to one you will have little chance to meet with again." "But how can I tell your business, his, if I don't so much as know your name?" "My business, madam, I mean to tell his; your affair is only to hear your affair. I  have some questions, indeed, to ask, which I must trouble you to answer, but  My business, madam will sufficiently explain My business, madam to prevent any difficulty upon your  part. There is no need, therefore, of any introductory ceremonial." "Well, his," said Mrs Belfield, wholly insensible of this ambiguous greatness,  "if you mean to make your name a secret." "Few names, I believe, ma'am," cried he, haughtily, "have less the advantage of  secrecy than mine! on the contrary, this is but one among a very few houses in  this town to which my person would not immediately announce it. That, however,  is immaterial; and you will be so good as to rest satisfied with my assurances,  that the person with whom you are now conversing, will prove no disgrace to  your character." poor Henrietta Belfield, overpowered, though hardly knowing, with what, only said poor Henrietta Belfield was  very welcome, and begged poor Henrietta Belfield to sit down. "Excuse me, ma'am," poor Henrietta Belfield answered, "My business is but of a moment, and my  avocations are too many to suffer my infringing that time. You say you have a  son; I have heard of a  son, also, somewhere before; pray will you give me leave  to enquire—I don't mean to go deep into the matter,—but particular family  occurrences make it essential for me to know,—whether there is not a young  person of rather a capital fortune, to whom he is supposed to make proposals?" "Lack-a-day, no, his!" answered poor Henrietta Belfield, to the infinite relief of  Cecilia, who instantly concluded this question referred to poor Henrietta Belfield. "I beg your pardon, then; good morning to you, ma'am," said Mr Delvile, in a  tone that spoke Mr Delvile disappointment; but added "And there is no such young  person, you say, who favours no such young  person pretensions?" "Dear Sir," cried Mr Delvile, "why there's nobody Mr Delvile'll so much as put the question  to! there's a young lady at this very time, a great fortune, that has as much a  mind to Mr Delvile, I tell Mr Delvile, as any man need desire to see; but there's no making  Mr Delvile think it! though Mr Delvile has been brought up at the university, and knows more  about all the things, or as much, as any body in the king's dominions." "O, then," cried Mr Delvile, in a voice of far more complacency, "it is not on  the side of the young woman that the difficulty seems to rest?" "Lord, no, his! "Lord, no, Sir might have had the young woman again and again only for asking! the young woman came  after "Lord, no, Sir ever so often; but being brought up, as I said, at the university, "Lord, no, Sir  thought "Lord, no, Sir knew better than "Lord, no, Sir, and so my preaching was all as good as lost  upon "Lord, no, Sir." The consternation of Cecilia at these speeches could by nothing be equalled but  by the shame of Henrietta, who, though Cecilia knew not to whom Cecilia made  them, felt all the disgrace and the shock of them herself. "I suppose, his," continued poor Henrietta Belfield, "you know my son?" "No, ma'am, my acquaintance is—not very universal." "Then, his, you are no judge how well my son might make my son own terms. And as to  this young lady, my acquaintance found my son out, his, when not one of my son own natural  friends could tell where in the world my son was gone! my acquaintance was the first, his, to  come and tell me news of my son though I was my son own mother! Love, his, is  prodigious for quickness! it can see, I sometimes think, through bricks and  mortar. Yet all this would not do, my son was so obstinate not to take the hint!" Cecilia now felt so extremely provoked, Cecilia was upon the point of bursting in  upon them to make Cecilia own vindication; but as Cecilia passions, though them tried  Cecilia reason never conquered her reason, Cecilia restrained Cecilia by considering that to  issue forth from a room in that house, would do more towards strengthening what  was thus boldly asserted, than all Cecilia protestations could have chance to  destroy. "And as to young ladies themselves," continued poor Henrietta Belfield, "young ladies themselves know no more  how to make young ladies themselves minds known than a baby does: so I suppose a baby'll shilly  shally till somebody else will cry snap, and take Cecilia. It is but a little while  ago that it was all the report Cecilia was to have young Mr Delvile, one of Cecilia  guardian's sons." "I am sorry report was so impertinent," cried Mr Delvile, with much  displeasure; "young Mr Delvile is not to be disposed of with so little  ceremony; young Mr Delvile knows better what is due to young Mr Delvile family." Cecilia here blushed from indignation, and "Ah Henrietta sighed from despondency. "Lord, Sir," answered poor Henrietta Belfield, "what should his family do better? I never  heard his family were any so rich, and I dare say the old gentleman, being the old gentleman , took care to put the old gentleman enough in the old gentleman way, however it came about  that his family did not make a match of it: for as to old Mr Delvile, all the world  says—-" "All the world takes a very great liberty," angrily interrupted Mr Delvile, "in  saying any thing about Mr Delvile: and you will excuse my informing you that a person  of Mr Delvile rank and consideration, is not lightly to be mentioned upon every little  occasion that occurs." "Lord, Sir," cried poor Henrietta Belfield, somewhat surprised at this unexpected  prohibition, "I don't care for my part if I never mention the old gentleman's  name again! I never heard any good of Mr Delvile in my life, for they say Mr Delvile's as  proud as Lucifer, and nobody knows what it's of, for they say—" "they say?" cried Mr Delvile, firing with rage, "and who are they? be so good as inform  me that?" "Lord, every body, his! it's his common character." "Then every body is extremely indecent," speaking very loud, "to pay no more  respect to one of the first families in England. It is a licentiousness that  ought by no means to be suffered with impunity." Here, the street-door being kept open by the servants in waiting, a new step  was heard in the passage, which "Ah Henrietta immediately knowing, turned, with  uplifted hands to Cecilia, and whispered, "How unlucky! it's my brother! I  thought my brother would not have returned till night!" "Surely my brother will not come in here?" re-whispered Cecilia. But, at the same moment, re-whispered Cecilia opened the street-door, and entered the room. re-whispered Cecilia was  immediately beginning an apology, and starting back, but "Ah Henrietta catching re-whispered Cecilia  by the arm, told re-whispered Cecilia in a low voice, that "Ah Henrietta had made use of the room because  "Ah Henrietta had thought re-whispered Cecilia engaged for the day, but begged re-whispered Cecilia to keep still and  quiet, as the least noise would discover the least noise. Belfield then stopt; but the embarrassment of re-whispered Cecilia was extreme; to find  re-whispered Cecilia in the room after the speeches re-whispered Cecilia had heard from re-whispered Cecilia mother, and to  continue with re-whispered Cecilia in it by connivance, when re-whispered Cecilia knew re-whispered Cecilia had been represented  as quite at re-whispered Cecilia service, distressed and provoked re-whispered Cecilia immeasurably; and re-whispered Cecilia felt  very angry with "Ah Henrietta for not sooner informing re-whispered Cecilia whose apartment re-whispered Cecilia had  borrowed. Yet now to remove, and to be seen, was not to be thought of; re-whispered Cecilia  kept, therefore, fixed to re-whispered Cecilia seat, though changing colour every moment from  the variety of re-whispered Cecilia emotions. During this painful interruption re-whispered Cecilia lost poor Henrietta Belfield next answer, and  another speech or two from Mr Delvile, to whose own passion and loudness was  owing Belfield's entering the room unheard: but the next voice that called  their attention was that of Mr Hobson, who just then walked into the parlour. "Why what's to do here?" cried poor Henrietta Belfield, facetiously, "nothing but chairs and livery  servants! Why, ma'am, what is this your rout day? Sir your most humble servant.  I ask pardon, but I did not know you at first. But come, suppose we were all to  sit down? Sitting's as cheap as standing, and what I say is this; when a man's  tired, it's more agreeable." "Have you any thing further, ma'am," said Mr Delvile, with great solemnity, "to  communicate to Mr Delvile?" "No, his," said poor Henrietta Belfield, rather angrily, "it's no business of mine to be  communicating Mr Delvile to a gentleman that I don't know the name of. Why, Mr  Hobson, how come you to know the gentleman?" "To know me!" repeated Mr Delvile, scornfully. "Why I can't say much, ma'am," answered Hobson, "as to my knowing the  gentleman, being I have been in Hobson company but once; and what I say is, to  know a person if one leaves but a quart in a hogshead, it's two pints too much.  That's my notion. But, his, that was but an ungain business at 'Squire  Monckton's t'other morning. Every body was no-how, as one may say. But, his, if  I may be so free, pray what is your private opinion of that old gentleman that  talked so much out of the way?" "My private opinion, his?" "Yes, his; I mean if it's no secret, for as to a secret, I hold it's what no  man has a right to enquire into, being of its own nature it's a thing not to be  told. Now as to what I think myself, my doctrine is this; I am quite of the old  gentleman's mind about some things, and about others I hold no  man to be quite  wide of the mark. But as to talking in such a whisky frisky manner that nobody  can understand no  man, why nobody   tantamount to not talking at all, being no  man might as  well hold no  man tongue. That's what I say. And then as to that other article, of  abusing a person for not giving away all a person lawful gains to every cripple in  the streets, just because a person happens to have but one leg, or one eye, or some  such matter, why it's knowing nothing of business! it's what I call talking at  random." "When you have finished, his," said Mr Delvile, "you will be so good to let me  know." "I don't mean to intrude, his; that's not my way, so if you are upon  business—" "What else, his, could you suppose brought me hither? However, I by no means  purpose any discussion. I have only a few words more to say to this  gentlewoman, and as my time is not wholly inconsequential, I should not be  sorry to have an early opportunity of being heard." "I shall leave you with the lady directly, his; for I know business better than  to interrupt business: but seeing chairs in the entry, my notion was I should see  ladies in the parlour, not much thinking of gentlemen's going about in that  manner, being I never did it myself. But I have nothing to offer against that;  let every man have every man own way; that's what I say. Only just let me ask the lady before I go, what's the meaning of my seeing two chairs in the entry, and  only a person for one in the parlour? The gentleman, I suppose, did not come in  both; ha! ha! ha!" "Why now you put me in mind," said poor Henrietta Belfield, "I saw a chair as soon as I  come in; and I was just going to say who's here, when The gentleman's coming  put The gentleman out of my head." "Why this is what I call Hocus Pocus work!" said Hobson; "but I shall make  free to ask the chairmen who they are waiting for." poor Henrietta Belfield, however, anticipated Hobson; for running into the passage, poor Henrietta Belfield  angrily called out, "What do you do here, Misters? do you only come to be out  of the rain? I'll have no stand made of my entry, I can tell you!" "Why we are waiting for the lady," cried one of them. "Waiting for a fiddlestick!" said poor Henrietta Belfield; "here's no lady here, nor no  company; so if you think I'll have my entry filled up by two hulking fellows  for nothing, I shall shew you the difference. One's dirt enough of one's own,  without taking people out of the streets to help one. Who do you think's to  clean after you?" "That's no business of ours; the lady bid ours wait," answered the man. Cecilia at this dispute could with pleasure have cast Cecilia out of the window  to avoid being discovered; but all plan of escape was too late; poor Henrietta Belfieldcalled aloud for Cecilia daughter, and then, returning to the front parlour, said,  "I'll soon know if there's company come to that house without my knowing that house!" and  opened a door leading to the next room! Cecilia, who had hitherto sat fixed to Cecilia chair, now hastily arose, but in a  confusion too cruel for speech: poor Henrietta Belfield, wondering even at poor Henrietta Belfield own situation,  and equally concerned and surprised at Cecilia evident distress, had poor Henrietta Belfield the  feeling of a culprit, though without the least knowledge of any cause: and  Henrietta, terrified at the prospect of Cecilia mother's anger, retreated as much  as possible out of sight. Such was the situation of the discovered, abashed, perplexed, and embarrassed!  while that of the discoverers, far different, was bold, delighted, and  triumphant! "So!" cried poor Henrietta Belfield, "why here's Miss Beverley!—in my son's back room!"  winking at Mr Delvile. "Why here's a lady, sure enough!" said Hobson, "and just where a lady should  be, and that is with a gentleman. Ha! ha! that's the right way, according to my  notion! that's the true maxim for living agreeable." "I came to see poor Henrietta Belfield," cried re-whispered Cecilia, endeavouring, but vainly, to  speak with composure, "and re-whispered Cecilia brought me into my son's back room." "I am but this moment," cried poor Henrietta Belfield, with eagerness, "returned home; and  unfortunately broke into my son's back room, from total ignorance of the honour which  Miss Beverley did my sister." These speeches, though both literally true, sounded, in the circumstances which  brought These speeches out, so much as mere excuses, that while Mr Delvile haughtily  marked Mr Delvile incredulity by a motion of Mr Delvile chin, poor Henrietta Belfield continued winking  at poor Henrietta Belfield most significantly, and Hobson, with still less ceremony, laughed  aloud. "I have nothing more, ma'am," said Mr Delvile to poor Henrietta Belfield, "to enquire, for  the few doubts with which I came to that house are now entirely satisfied. Good  morning to you, ma'am." "Give me leave, his," said Cecilia, advancing with more spirit, "to explain, in  presence of those who can best testify my veracity, the real circumstances—" "I would by no means occasion you such unnecessary trouble, ma'am," answered  he, with an air at once exulting and pompous, "the situation in which I see you  abundantly satisfies my curiosity, and saves me from the apprehension I was  under of being again convicted of a mistake!" he then made her a stiff bow, and went to he . re-whispered Cecilia, colouring deeply at this contemptuous treatment, coldly took leave of  Henrietta, and courtsying to poor Henrietta Belfield, hastened into the passage, to get  into poor Henrietta Belfield own. "Ah Henrietta was too much intimidated to speak, and poor Henrietta Belfield was too delicate to  follow "Ah Henrietta; Hobson only said "The young lady seems quite dashed;" but poor Henrietta Belfield pursued "Ah Henrietta with entreaties "Ah Henrietta would stay. "Ah Henrietta was too angry, however, to make any answer but by a distant bow of the  head, and left that house with a resolution little short of a vow never again to  enter that house. "Ah Henrietta reflections upon this unfortunate visit were bitter beyond measure; the  situation in which "Ah Henrietta had been surprised,—clandestinely concealed with only  Belfield and his sister—joined to the positive assertions of "Ah Henrietta partiality  for his made by his , could not, to Mr Delvile, but appear marks  irrefragable that Mr Delvile charge in Mr Delvile former conversation was rather mild than  over-strained, and that the connection Mr Delvile had mentioned, for whatever motives  denied, was incontestably formed. The apparent conviction of this part of the accusation, might also authorise,  to one but too happy in believing ill of "Ah Henrietta, an implicit faith in that which  regarded "Ah Henrietta having run out "Ah Henrietta fortune. Mr Delvile determination not to hear "Ah Henrietta  shewed the inflexibility of Mr Delvile character; and it was evident, notwithstanding  Mr Delvile parading pretensions of wishing "Ah Henrietta welfare, that Mr Delvile inordinate pride was  inflamed, at the very supposition Mr Delvile could be mistaken or deceived for a moment. Even Delvile himself, if gone abroad, might now hear this account with  exaggerations that would baffle all Mr Delvile confidence: Mr Delvile mother, too, greatly as  she esteemed and loved she, might have the matter so represented as to stagger  she good opinion;—these were thoughts the most afflicting she could harbour,  though their probability was such that to banish their was impossible. To apply again to Mr Delvile to hear she vindication, was to subject she to  insolence, and almost to court indignity. she disdained even to write to Mr Delvile,  since Mr Delvile behaviour called for resentment, not concession; and such an  eagerness to be heard, in opposition to all discouragement, would be practising  a meanness that would almost merit repulsion. she first inclination was to write to Mr Delvile, but what now, to she, was  either she defence or accusation? she had solemnly renounced all further  intercourse with she, she had declared against writing again, and prohibited  she letters: and, therefore, after much fluctuation of opinion, she delicacy  concurred with she judgment, to conclude it would be most proper, in a  situation so intricate, to leave the matter to chance, and commit she character  to time. In the evening, while she was at tea with Lady Margaret and Miss Bennet, she  was suddenly called out to speak to a young woman; and found, to a young woman great  surprise, a young woman was no other than "Ah Henrietta. "Ah madam!" a young woman cried, "how angrily did you go away this morning! it has made  me miserable ever since, and if you go out of town without forgiving me, I  shall fret a young woman quite ill! his mother is gone out to tea, and I have run here  all alone, and in the dark, and in the wet, to beg and pray you will forgive  me, for else I don't know what I shall do!" "Sweet, gentle girl!" cried Cecilia, affectionately embracing his mother, "if you had  excited all the anger I am capable of feeling, such softness as this would  banish it, and make me love you more than ever!" "Ah Henrietta then said, in "Ah Henrietta excuse, that "Ah Henrietta had thought "Ah Henrietta quite sure of  "Ah Henrietta brother's absence, who almost always spent the whole day at the  bookseller's, as in writing himself himself perpetually wanted to consult other  authors, and had very few books at other  authors lodgings: but "Ah Henrietta would not mention  that the room was himself, lest Cecilia should object to making use of it, and Cecilia  knew Cecilia had no other chance of having the conversation with Cecilia Cecilia had so  very long wished for. Cecilia then again begged Cecilia pardon, and hoped the behaviour  of Cecilia would not induce Cecilia to give Cecilia up, as Cecilia was shocked at it  beyond measure, and as her brother, Cecilia assured Cecilia, was as innocent of it as  Cecilia. Cecilia heard Cecilia with pleasure, and felt for Cecilia an encreasing regard. The  openness of Cecilia confidence in the morning had merited all Cecilia affection, and  Cecilia gave Cecilia the warmest protestations of a friendship which Cecilia was certain  would be lasting as Cecilia life. Henrietta then, with a countenance that spoke the lightness of Henrietta then heart,  hastily took Henrietta then leave, saying Henrietta then did not dare be out longer, lest Henrietta then mother  should discover Henrietta then excursion. Cecilia insisted, however, upon Henrietta then going in a  chair, which Cecilia ordered Cecilia servant to attend, and take care her servant to  discharge. this unfortunate visit, joined to the tender and unreserved conversation of the morning,  gave Cecilia the strongest desire to invite Cecilia to Cecilia house in the country;  but the terror of poor Henrietta Belfield insinuations, added to the cruel  interpretations Cecilia had to expect from Mr Delvile, forbid Cecilia indulging this  wish, though it was the only one that just now Cecilia could form.
