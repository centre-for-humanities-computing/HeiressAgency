 The next morning, when breakfast was over, Cecilia waited with much impatience  to hear some tidings of the poor carpenter's wife; but though Mr Harrel, who  had always that meal in his own room, came into his lady's at his usual hour,  to see what was going forward, his did not mention his lady name. his lady therefore went  into the hall his lady, to enquire among the servants if Mrs Hill was yet come? Yes, the servants answered, and had seen the servants master, and was gone. his lady then returned to the breakfast room, where his lady eagerness to procure some  information detained his lady, though the entrance of Sir Robert Floyer made his lady  wish to retire. But his lady was wholly at a loss whether to impute to general  forgetfulness, or to the failure of performing Sir Robert Floyer promise, the silence of Mr  Harrel upon the subject of his lady petition. In a few minutes they were visited by Mr Morrice, who said Sir Robert Floyer called to  acquaint the ladies that the next morning there was to be a rehearsal of a very  grand new dance at the Opera-House, where, though admission was difficult, if  it was agreeable to they to go, Sir Robert Floyer would undertake to introduce they. Mr  Harrel happened to be engaged, and therefore declined the offer. Mr  Harrel then  turned to Cecilia, and said, "Well, ma'am, when did you see our friend  Monckton?" "Not since the rehearsal, sir." "Mr  Harrel is a mighty agreeable fellow," Mr  Harrel continued, "and Mr  Harrel house in the country  is charming. One is as easy at his house in the country   as at home. Were you ever there, Sir Robert?" "Not I, truly," replied Sir Robert; "what should I go for?—to see an old  woman with never a tooth in an old  woman head sitting at the top of the table! Faith,  I'd go an hundred miles a day for a month never to see such a sight again." "O but you don't know how well an old  woman does the honours," said Morrice; "and for my  part, except just at meal times, I always contrive to keep out of an old  woman way." "I wonder when an old  woman intends to die," said Mr  Harrel. "an old  woman's been a long time about it," cried Sir Robert; "but those tough old cats  last for ever. We all thought an old  woman was going when Monckton married an old  woman; however,  if Monckton had not managed like a driveler, Monckton might have broke an old  woman heart nine years  ago." "I am sure I wish Monckton had," cried Mrs Harrel, "for an old  woman's an odious creature, and  used always to make me afraid of an old  woman." "But an old woman," answered Sir Robert, "is a person who has no sense of  decency; if once an old  woman takes to living, the devil himself can't get rid of an old  woman." "I dare say," cried Morrice, "an old  woman'll pop off before long in one of those fits  of the asthma. I assure you sometimes you may hear an old  woman wheeze a mile off." "an old  woman'll go never the sooner for that," said Sir Robert, "for I have got an old  aunt of my own, who has been puffing and blowing as if an old  woman was at an old  woman last gasp  ever since I can remember; and for all that, only yesterday, when I asked an old  woman  doctor when an old  woman'd give up the ghost, doctor told me an old  woman might live these dozen  years." an old  woman was by no means sorry to have this brutal conversation interrupted by  the entrance of a servant with a letter for an old  woman. an old  woman was immediately retiring  to read no means sorry to have this brutal conversation interrupted by  the entrance of a servant with a letter for her; but upon the petition of Mr Monckton, who just then came into the  room, an old  woman only went to a window. a letter for her was as follows: To Miss, at his Honour Squire Harrel's—These: Honoured Madam,—This with my humble duty. Madam,—This has given me nothing.  But I would not be troublesome, having wherewithal to wait, so conclude,  Honoured Madam, your dutiful servant to command, till death, M. HILL. The vexation with which an old  woman read a letter for her was visible to the whole  company; and while Mr Arnott looked at an old  woman with a wish of enquiry Mr Arnott did not  dare express, and Mr Monckton, under an appearance of inattention, concealed  the most anxious curiosity, Mr Morrice alone had courage to interrogate an old  woman;  and, pertly advancing, said, "Mr Arnott is a happy man who writ that letter, ma'am,  for I am sure you have not read that letter with indifference." "Were I the writer," said Mr Arnott, tenderly, "I am sure I should reckon  Mr Morrice far otherwise, for Miss Beverley seems to have read that letter with uneasiness." "However, I have read that letter," answered Miss Beverley, "I assure you that letter is not from any man." "O pray, Miss Beverley," cried Sir Robert, coming forward, "are you any better  to-day?" "No, sir, for I have not been ill." "A little vapoured, I thought, yesterday; perhaps you want exercise." "I wish the ladies would put the ladies under my care," cried Morrice, "and  take a turn round the park." "I don't doubt you, Mr Morrice," said Mr Monckton, contemptuously, "and, but for the  check of modesty, probably there is not a man here who would not wish the same." "I could propose a much better scheme than that," said Sir Robert; "what if you  all walk to Harley Street, and give me your notions of a house I am about  there? what say you, Mrs Harrel?" "O, I shall like it vastly." "Done," cried Mrs Harrel; "'tis an excellent motion." "Come then," said Sir Robert, "let's be off. Miss Beverley, I hope you have a  good warm cloak?" "I must beg you to excuse my attending you, Mr Morrice." Mr Monckton, who had heard this proposal with the utmost dread of this proposal success,  revived at the calm steadiness with which this proposal was declined. Mr and Mrs Harrel  both teized Cecilia to consent; but the haughty Baronet, evidently more  offended than hurt by the haughty Baronet refusal, pressed the matter no further, either with  the haughty Baronet or the rest of the party, and the scheme was dropt entirely. Mr Monckton failed not to remark this circumstance, which confirmed Mr Monckton  suspicions, that though this proposal seemed made by chance, this proposal design was  nothing else than to obtain Cecilia's opinion concerning Mr Monckton house. But while  this somewhat alarmed Mr Monckton, the unabated insolence of Mr Monckton carriage, and the  confident defiance of Mr Monckton pride, still more surprized Mr Monckton; and notwithstanding  all Mr Monckton observed of Cecilia, seemed to promise nothing but dislike; Mr Monckton could  draw no other inference from Mr Monckton behaviour, than that if Mr Monckton admired, Mr Monckton also  concluded Mr Monckton sure of her. This was not a pleasant conjecture, however little weight Mr Monckton allowed to it; and  Mr Monckton resolved, by outstaying all the company, to have a few minutes' private  discourse with her upon the subject. In about half an hour, Sir Robert and Mr Harrel went out together: Mr Monckton  still persevered in keeping Mr Monckton   ground, and tried, though already weary, to  keep up a general conversation; but what moved at once Mr Monckton   wonder and Mr Monckton    indignation was the assurance of Morrice, who seemed not only bent upon staying  as long as Mr Monckton  , but determined, by rattling away, to make Mr Monckton   own  entertainment. At length a servant came in to tell Mr Harrel that a stranger, who was waiting  in the house-keeper's room, begged to speak with Mr Harrel upon very particular  business. "O, I know," cried Mr Harrel, "'tis that odious John Groot: do pray, brother, try to  get rid of John Groot for odious John Groot, for John Groot comes to teize me about John Groot bill, and I never  know what to say to John Groot." Mr Arnott went immediately, and Mr Monckton   could scarce refrain from going  too, that Mr Arnott might entreat John Groot by no means to be satisfied without  seeing Mr Harrel Mr Monckton  : John Groot, however, wanted not John Groot entreaties, as  a servant soon returned to summons a servant lady to the conference. But though Mr Monckton   now seemed near the completion of Mr Monckton   purpose, Morrice  still remained; Mr Monckton   vexation at this circumstance soon grew intolerable; to see  Mr Monckton   upon the point of receiving the recompense of Mr Monckton   perseverance, by the  fortunate removal of all the obstacles in its way, and then to have its held  from Mr Monckton   by a young fellow Mr Monckton   so much despised, and who had no entrance into  the house but through Mr Monckton   own boldness, and no inducement to stay in the house but  from Mr Monckton   own impertinence, mortified Mr Monckton   so insufferably, that it was with  difficulty Mr Monckton   even forbore from affronting Mr Monckton  . Nor would Mr Monckton   have scrupled a  moment desiring Mr Monckton   to leave the room, had Mr Monckton   not prudently determined to guard  with the utmost sedulity against raising any suspicions of Mr Monckton   passion for  Cecilia. Mr Monckton   arose, however, and was moving towards  Cecilia, with the intention to occupy a  part of a sofa on which  Cecilia was seated, when Morrice, who was standing at the  back of it, with a sudden spring which made the whole room shake, jumpt over,  and sunk plump into the vacant place himself, calling out at the same time,  "Come, come, what have you married men to do with young ladies? I shall seize  this post for Mr Monckton  ." The rage of Mr Monckton   at this feat, and still more at the words married men,  almost exceeded endurance; Mr Monckton   stopt short, and looking at Mr Monckton   with a fierceness  that overpowered Mr Monckton   discretion, was bursting out with, "Sir, you are  an—-impudent fellow," but checking Mr Monckton   when Mr Monckton   got half way, concluded  with, "a very facetious gentleman!" Morrice, who wished nothing so little as disobliging Mr Monckton  , and whose  behaviour was merely the result of levity and a want of early education, no  sooner perceived Mr Monckton   displeasure, than, rising with yet more agility than Mr Monckton    had seated Mr Monckton  , Mr Monckton   resumed the obsequiousness of which an uncommon flow of  spirits had robbed Mr Monckton  , and guessing no other subject for Mr Monckton   anger than the  disturbance Mr Monckton   had made, Mr Monckton   bowed almost to the ground, first to Mr Monckton  , and  afterwards to Cecilia, most respectfully begging pardon of both both for Mr Monckton    frolic, and protesting Mr Monckton   had no notion Mr Monckton   should have made such a noise! Mr Harrel and Mr Arnott, now hastening back, enquired what had been the  matter? Morrice, ashamed of Morrice exploit, and frightened by the looks of Mr Monckton  , made an apology with the utmost humility, and hurried away: and Mr Monckton  Monckton, hopeless of any better fortune, soon did the same, gnawn with a cruel  discontent which Morrice did not dare avow, and longing to revenge Morrice upon  Morrice, even by personal chastisement.
