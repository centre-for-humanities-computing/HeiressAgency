 Cecilia now had no time for afterthoughts or anxious repentance, since  notwithstanding the hurry of her spirits, and the confusion of her mind, she  had too much real business, to yield to pensive indulgence. Averse to all falsehood, she invented none upon this occasion; she merely told  her guests she was summoned to London upon an affair of importance; and though  she saw their curiosity, not being at liberty to satisfy it with the truth, she  attempted not to appease it by fiction, but quietly left it to its common fare,  conjecture. She would gladly have made Henrietta the companion of her journey,  but Henrietta was the last to whom that journey could give pleasure. She only,  therefore, took her maid in the chaise, and, attended by one servant on  horseback, at six o'clock the next morning, she quitted her mansion, to enter  into an engagement by which soon she was to resign it for ever. Disinterested as she was, she considered her situation as peculiarly perverse,  that from the time of her coming to a fortune which most others regarded as  enviable, she had been a stranger to peace, a fruitless seeker of happiness, a  dupe to the fraudulent, and a prey to the needy! the little comfort she had  received, had been merely from dispensing it, and now only had she any chance  of being happy herself, when upon the point of relinquishing what all others  built their happiness upon obtaining! These reflections only gave way to others still more disagreeable; she was now  a second time engaged in a transaction she could not approve, and suffering the  whole peace of her future life to hang upon an action dark, private and  imprudent: an action by which the liberal kindness of her late uncle would be  annulled, by which the father of her intended husband would be disobeyed, and  which already, in a similar instance, had brought her to affliction and  disgrace. These melancholy thoughts haunted her during the whole journey, and  though the assurance of Mrs Delvile's approbation was some relief to her  uneasiness, she involuntarily prepared herself for meeting new mortifications,  and was tormented with an apprehension that this second attempt made her merit  them. She drove immediately, by the previous direction of Delvile, to a lodging-house  in Albemarle Street, which he had taken care to have prepared for her  reception. She then sent for a chair, and went to Mrs Delvile's. Her being seen  by the servants of that house was not very important, as their master was soon  to be acquainted with the real motive of her journey. She was shewn into a parlour, while Mrs Delvile was informed of her arrival,  and there flown to by Delvile with the most grateful eagerness. Yet she saw in  his countenance that all was not well, and heard upon enquiry that his mother  was considerably worse. Extremely shocked by this intelligence, she already  began to lament her unfortunate enterprise. Delvile struggled, by exerting his  own spirits, to restore hers, but forced gaiety is never exhilarating; and,  full of care and anxiety, he was ill able to appear sprightly and easy. They were soon summoned upstairs into the apartment of Mrs Delvile, who was  lying upon a couch, pale, weak, and much altered. Delvile led the way, saying,  "Here, madam, comes one whose sight will bring peace and pleasure to you!" "This, indeed," cried Mrs Delvile, half rising and embracing her, "is the form  in which they are most welcome to me! virtuous, noble Cecilia! what honour you  do my son! with what joy, should I ever recover, shall I assist him in paying  the gratitude he owes you!" Cecilia, grieved at her situation, and affected by her kindness, could only  answer with her tears; which, however, were not shed alone; for Delvile's eyes  were full, as he passionately exclaimed, "This, this is the sight my heart has  thus long desired! the wife of my choice taken to the bosom of the parent I  revere! be yet but well, my beloved mother, and I will be thankful for every  calamity that has led to so sweet a conclusion!" "Content yourself, however, my son, with one of us," cried Mrs Delvile,  smiling; "and content yourself, if you can, though your hard lot should make  that one this creature of full bloom, health, and youth! Ah, my love," added  she, more seriously, and addressing the still weeping Cecilia, "should now  Mortimer, in losing me, lose those cares by which alone, for some months past,  my life has been rendered tolerable, how peaceably shall I resign him to one so  able to recompense his filial patience and services!" This was not a speech to stop the tears of Cecilia, though such warmth of  approbation quieted her conscientious scruples. Delvile now earnestly  interfered; he told her that his mother had been ordered not to talk or exert  herself, and entreated her to be composed, and his mother to be silent. "Be it your business, then," said Mrs Delvile, more gaily, "to find us  entertainment. We will promise to be very still if you will take that trouble  upon yourself." "I will not," answered he, "be rallied from my purpose; if I cannot entertain,  it will be something to weary you, for that may incline you to take rest, which  will he answering a better purpose." "Mortimer," returned she, "is this the ingenuity of duty or of love? and which  are you just now thinking of, my health, or a conversation uninterrupted with  Miss Beverley?" "Perhaps a little of both!" said he, chearfully, though colouring. "But you rather meant it should pass," said Mrs Delvile, "you were thinking  only of me? I have always observed, that where one scheme answers two purposes,  the ostensive is never the purpose most at heart." "Why it is but common prudence," answered Delvile, "to feel our way a little  before we mention what we most wish, and so cast the hazard of the refusal upon  something rather less important." "Admirably settled!" cried Mrs Delvile: "so my rest is but to prove Miss  Beverley's disturbance!—Well, it is only anticipating our future way of life,  when her disturbance, in taking the management of you to herself, will of  course prove my rest." She then quietly reposed herself, and Delvile discoursed with Cecilia upon  their future plans, hopes and actions. He meant to set off from the church-door to Delvile Castle, to acquaint his  father with his marriage, and then to return instantly to London: there he  entreated Cecilia to stay with his mother, that, finding them both together, he  might not exhaust her patience, by making his parting visit occasion another  journey to Suffolk. But here Cecilia resolutely opposed him; saying, her only chance to escape  discovery, was going instantly to her own house; and representing so earnestly  her desire that their marriage should be unknown till his return to England,  upon a thousand motives of delicacy, propriety, and fearfulness, that the  obligation he owed already to a compliance which he saw grew more and more  reluctant, restrained him both in gratitude and pity from persecuting her  further. Neither would she consent to seeing him in Suffolk; which could but  delay his mother's journey, and expose her to unnecessary suspicions; she  promised, however, to write to him often, and as, from his mother's weakness,  he must travel very slowly, she took a plan of his route, and engaged that he  should find a letter from her at every great town. The bond which he had already had altered, he insisted upon leaving in her own  custody, averse to applying to Mr Monckton, whose behaviour to him had before  given him disgust, and in whom Cecilia herself no longer wished to confide. He  had again applied to the same lawyer, Mr Singleton, to give her away; for  though to his secrecy he had no tie, he had still less to any entire stranger.  Mrs Delvile was too ill to attend them to church, nor would Delvile have  desired from her such absolute defiance of his father. Cecilia now gave another sigh to her departed friend Mrs Charlton, whose  presence upon this awful occasion would else again have soothed and supported  her. She had no female friend in whom she could rely; but feeling a repugnance  invincible to being accompanied only by men, she accepted the attendance of Mrs  Delvile's own woman, who had lived many years in the family, and was high in  the favour and confidence of her lady. The arrangement of these and other articles, with occasional interruptions from  Mrs Delvile, fully employed the evening. Delvile would not trust again to  meeting her at the church; but begged her to send out her servants between  seven and eight o'clock in the morning, at which time he would himself call for  her with a chair. She went away early, that Mrs Delvile might go to rest, and it was mutually  agreed they should risk no meeting the next day. Delvile conjured them to part  with firmness and chearfulness, and Cecilia, fearing her own emotion, would  have retired without bidding her adieu. But Mrs Delvile, calling after her,  said, "Take with you my blessing!" and tenderly embracing her, added, "My son,  as my chief nurse, claims a prescriptive right to govern me, but I will break  from his control to tell my sweet Cecilia what ease and what delight she has  already given to my mind! my best hope of recovery is founded on the pleasure I  anticipate to witnessing your mutual happiness: but should my illness prove  fatal, and that felicity be denied me, my greatest earthly care is already  removed by the security I feel of Mortimer's future peace. Take with you, then,  my blessing, for you are become one to me! long daughter of my affection, now  wife of my darling son! love her, Mortimer, as she merits, and cherish her with  tenderest gratitude!—banish, sweetest Cecilia, every apprehension that  oppresses you, and receive in Mortimer Delvile a husband that will revere your  virtues, and dignify your choice!" She then embraced her again, and seeing that her heart was too full for speech,  suffered her to go without making any answer. Delvile attended her to her  chair, scarce less moved than herself, and found only opportunity to entreat  her punctuality the next morning. She had, indeed, no inclination to fail in her appointment, or risk the  repetition of scenes so affecting, or situations so alarming. Mrs Delvile's  full approbation somewhat restored to her her own, but nothing could remove the  fearful anxiety, which still privately tormented her with expectations of  another disappointment. The next morning she arose with the light, and calling all her courage to her  aid, determined to consider this day as decisive of her destiny with regard to  Delvile, and, rejoicing that at least all suspense would be over, to support  herself with fortitude, be that destiny what it might. At the appointed time she sent her maid to visit Mrs Hill, and gave some  errands to her man that carried him to a distant part of the town: but she  charged them both to return to the lodgings by nine o'clock, at which hour she  ordered a chaise for returning into the country. Delvile, who was impatiently watching for their quitting the house, only waited  till they were out of sight, to present himself at the door. He was shewn into  a parlour, where she instantly attended him; and being told that the clergyman,  Mr Singleton, and Mrs Delvile's woman, were already in the church, she gave him  her hand in silence, and he led her to the chair. The calmness of stifled hope had now taken place in Cecilia of quick sensations  and alarm. Occupied with a firm belief she should never be the wife of Delvile,  she only waited, with a desperate sort of patience, to see when and by whom she  was next to be parted from him. When they arrived near the church, Delvile stopt the chair. He handed Cecilia  out of it, and discharging the chairmen, conducted her into the church. He was  surprised himself at her composure, but earnestly wishing it to last, took care  not to say to her a word that should make any answer from her necessary. He gave her, as before, to Mr Singleton, secretly praying that not, as before,  she might be given him in vain: Mrs Delvile's woman attended her; the clergyman  was ready, and they all proceeded to the altar. The ceremony was begun; Cecilia, rather mechanically than with consciousness,  appearing to listen to it but at the words, If any man can shew any just cause  why they may not lawfully be joined together, Delvile himself shook with  terror, lest some concealed person should again answer it, and Cecilia, with a  sort of steady dismay in her countenance, cast her eyes round the church, with  no other view than that of seeing from what corner the prohibiter would start. She looked, however, to no purpose; no prohibiter appeared, the ceremony was  performed without any interruption, and she received the thanks of Delvile, and  the congratulations of the little set, before the idea which had so strongly  pre-occupied her imagination, was sufficiently removed from it to satisfy her  she was really married. They then went to the vestry, where their business was not long; and Delvile  again put Cecilia into a chair, which again he accompanied on foot. Her sensibility now soon returned, though still attended with strangeness and a  sensation of incredulity. But the sight of Delvile at her lodgings, contrary to  their agreement, wholly recovered her senses from the stupor which had dulled  them. He came, however, but to acknowledge how highly she had obliged him, to  see her himself restored to the animation natural to her, character, and to  give her a million of charges, resulting from anxiety and tenderness. And then,  fearing the return of her servants, he quitted her, and set out for Delvile  Castle. The amazement of Cecilia was still unconquerable; to be actually united with  Delvile! to be his with the full consent of his mother,—to have him her's,  beyond the power of his father,—she could not reconcile it with possibility;  she fancied it a dream,—but a dream from which she wished not to wake.
