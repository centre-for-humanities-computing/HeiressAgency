 The following morning, therefore, Cecilia went early to St James's-square: and,  after the usual ceremonies of messages and long waiting, Cecilia was shewn into an  apartment where Cecilia found Mr Delvile and Mr Delvile son. Cecilia rejoiced to see them together, and determined to make known to them both  the purport of Cecilia visit: and therefore, after some apologies and a little  hesitation, Cecilia told Mr Delvile, that encouraged by Mr Delvile offers of serving Cecilia,  Cecilia had taken the liberty to call upon Mr Delvile with a view to entreat Mr Delvile  assistance. Mr Delvile, immediately arising, would have quitted the room; but Cecilia,  assuring Mr Delvile Cecilia rather desired what Cecilia had to say should be known than kept  secret, begged that Mr Delvile would not disturb Mr Delvile. Mr Delvile, pleased with this permission to hear Cecilia, and curious to know what  would follow, very readily returned to Mr Delvile seat. "I should by no means," Cecilia continued, "have thought of proclaiming even to the  most intimate of my friends, the partiality which Sir Robert Floyer has been  pleased to shew me, had Sir Robert Floyer left to Cecilia the choice of publishing or concealing  it: but, on the contrary, Sir Robert Floyer own behaviour seems intended not merely to  display it, but to insinuate that it meets with my approbation. Mr Harrel,  also, urged by too much warmth of friendship, has encouraged this belief; nor,  indeed, do I know at present where the mistake stops, nor what the mistake is report has  not scrupled to affirm. But I think I ought no longer to neglect the mistake, and  therefore I have presumed to solicit your advice in what manner I may most  effectually contradict the mistake." The extreme surprise of Mr Delvile at this speech was not more evident than  pleasant to Cecilia, to whom this speech accounted for all that had perplext Cecilia in his  conduct, while this speech animated every expectation Cecilia wished to encourage. "The behaviour of Mr Harrel," answered Mr Delvile, "has by no means been such  as to lead me to forget that Mr Delvile father was the son of a steward of Mr Grant,  who lived in the neighbourhood of my friend and relation the Duke of Derwent:  nor can I sufficiently congratulate myself that I have always declined acting  with Mr Delvile. The late Dean, indeed, never committed so strange an impropriety as  that of nominating Mr Harrel and Mr Briggs coadjutors with Mr Delvile. so strange an impropriety, however, though extremely offensive to myself, has never obliterated  from my mind the esteem I bore The late Dean: nor can I possibly give a greater  proof of the esteem I bore the Dean than the readiness I have always shewn to offer my counsel and  instruction to Dean niece. Mr Harrel, therefore, ought certainly to have desired  Sir Robert Floyer to acquaint me with Sir Robert Floyer proposals before Sir Robert Floyer gave to Sir Robert Floyer any  answer." "Undoubtedly, Sir Robert Floyer," said Cecilia, willing to shorten this parading harangue,  "but as Sir Robert Floyer neglected that intention, will you think me too impertinent should I  entreat the favour of you to speak with Sir Robert you, and explain to Sir Robert  the total inefficacy of Sir Robert pursuit, since my determination against Sir Robert is  unalterable?" Here the conference was interrupted by the entrance of a servant who said  something to Mr Delvile, which occasioned Sir Robert apologizing to Cecilia for  leaving Cecilia for a few moments, and ostentatiously assuring Cecilia that no  business, however important, should prevent Sir Robert thinking of Cecilia affairs, or  detain Sir Robert from returning to Cecilia as soon as possible. The astonishment of young Delvile at the strength of Cecilia last expression kept  Sir Robert silent some time after Sir Robert father left the room; and then, with a  countenance that still marked Sir Robert amazement, Sir Robert said "Is it possible, Miss  Beverley, that I should twice have been thus egregiously deceived? or rather,  that the whole town, and even the most intimate of your friends, should so  unaccountably have persisted in a mistake." "For the town," answered Cecilia, "I know not how it can have had any concern  in so small a matter; but for my intimate friends, I have too few to make it  probable my intimate friends should ever have been so strangely misinformed." "Pardon me," cried Sir Robert, "it was from one who ought to know, that I had myself  the intelligence." "I entreat you, then," said Cecilia, "to acquaint me who it was?" "Mr Harrel himself; who communicated it to a lady in my hearing, and at a  public place." Cecilia cast up Cecilia eyes in wonder and indignation at a proof so  incontrovertible of his falsehood, but made not any answer. "Even yet," continued his, "I can scarcely feel undeceived; your engagement  seemed so positive, your connection so irretrievable,—so,—so fixed, I  mean.—" his hesitated, a little embarrassed; but then suddenly exclaimed, "Yet whence,  if to neither favourable, if indifferent alike to Sir Robert and to Belfield,  whence that animated apprehension for their safety at the Opera-house? whence  that never to be forgotten oh stop Sir Robert! good God! will nobody stop him!—Words  of anxiety so tender! and sounds that still vibrate in my ear!" Cecilia, struck with amazement in " Cecilia turn at the strength of his own  expressions, blushed, and for a few minutes hesitated how to answer his: but  then, to leave nothing that related to so disagreeable a report in any doubt,  " Cecilia resolved to tell his ingenuously the circumstances that had occasioned " Cecilia  alarm: and therefore, though with some pain to " Cecilia modesty, " Cecilia confessed " Cecilia  fears that " Cecilia had " Cecilia provoked the affront, though " Cecilia only view had been  to discountenance Sir Robert, without meaning to shew any distinction to Mr  Belfield. Delvile, who seemed charmed with the candour of this explanation, said, when  " Cecilia had finished this explanation, "You are then at liberty?—-Ah madam!—how many may rue  so dangerous a discovery!" "Could you think," said " Cecilia, endeavouring to speak with " Cecilia usual ease,  "that Sir Robert Floyer would be found so irresistible?" "Oh no!" cried Sir Robert Floyer, "far otherwise; a thousand times I have wondered at Sir Robert Floyer  happiness; a thousand times, when I have looked at you, and listened to you, I  have thought it impossible!—yet my authority seemed indisputable. And how was  I to discredit what was not uttered as a conjecture, but asserted as a fact?  asserted, too, by the guardian with whom you lived? and not hinted as a secret,  but affirmed as a point settled?" "Yet surely," said " Cecilia, "you have heard me make use of expressions that  could not but lead you to suppose there was some mistake, whatever might be the  authority which had won your belief." "No," answered Sir Robert Floyer, "I never supposed any mistake, though sometimes I thought  you repented your engagement. I concluded, indeed, you had been unwarily drawn  in, and I have even, at times, been tempted to acknowledge my suspicions to  you, state your independence, and exhort you—as a friend, exhort you—to use  it with spirit, and, if you were shackled unwillingly, incautiously, or  unworthily, to break the chains by which you were confined, and restore to  yourself that freedom of choice upon the use of which all your happiness must  ultimately depend. But I doubted if this were honourable to the Baronet,—and  what, indeed, was my right to such a liberty? none that every man might not be  proud of, a wish to do honour to myself, under the officious pretence of  serving the most amiable of women." "Mr Harrel," said " Cecilia, "has been so strangely bigoted to his friend, that  in his eagerness to manifest his regard for his, his seems to have forgotten  every other consideration; his would not, else, have spread so widely a report  that could so ill stand enquiry." "If Sir Robert," returned Sir Robert, "is Sir Robert," returned he deceived while Sir Robert," returned he deceives others,  who can forbear to pity Sir Robert," returned he? for my own part, instead of repining that hitherto  I have been mistaken, ought I not rather to bless an error that may have been  my preservative from danger?" Cecilia, distressed in what manner to support Cecilia part in the conversation,  began now to wish the return of Mr Delvile; and, not knowing what else to say,  Cecilia expressed Cecilia surprise at Mr Delvile long absence. "It is not, indeed, well timed," said young Delvile, "just now,—at the moment  when—" he stopt, and presently exclaiming "Oh dangerous interval!" he arose  from he seat in manifest disorder. Cecilia arose too, and hastily ringing the bell, said, "Mr Delvile I am sure is  detained, and therefore I will order my chair, and call another time." "Do I frighten you away?" said "Mr Delvile, assuming an appearance more placid. "No," answered Cecilia, "but I would not hasten Mr Delvile." A servant then came, and said my chair was ready. Cecilia would immediately have followed A servant, but Mr Delvile Mr Delvile again speaking, Cecilia  stopt a moment to hear A servant. "I fear," said A servant, with much hesitation, "I have  strangely exposed A servant—and that you cannot—but the extreme  astonishment—" he stopt again in the utmost confusion, and then adding, "you  will permit me to attend you to my chair," he handed Cecilia down stairs, and in  quitting Cecilia, bowed without saying a word more. Cecilia, who was almost wholly indifferent to every part of the explanation but  that which had actually passed, was now in a state of felicity more delightful  than any Cecilia had ever experienced. Cecilia had not a doubt remaining of Cecilia  influence over the mind of Mr Delvile, and the surprise which had made Mr Delvile  rather betray than express Mr Delvile regard, was infinitely more flattering and  satisfactory to Cecilia than any formal or direct declaration. Cecilia had now  convinced Mr Delvile Cecilia was disengaged, and in return, though without seeming to  intend it, Mr Delvile had convinced Cecilia of the deep interest which Mr Delvile took in the  discovery. Mr Delvile perturbation, the words which escaped Mr Delvile, and Mr Delvile evident  struggle to say no more, were proofs just such as Cecilia wished to receive of Mr Delvile  partial admiration, since while they satisfied Cecilia heart, they also soothed Cecilia  pride, by shewing a diffidence of success which assured Cecilia that Cecilia own secret  was still sacred, and that no weakness or inadvertency on Cecilia part had robbed  Cecilia of the power of mingling dignity with the frankness with which Cecilia meant to  receive Mr Delvile addresses. All, therefore, that now employed Cecilia care, was to keep  off any indissoluble engagement till each should be better known to the other. For this reserve, however, Cecilia had less immediate occasion than Cecilia expected;  Cecilia saw no more of Mr Delvile that day; neither did Mr Delvile appear the next. The  third Cecilia fully expected him,—but still him,—but came not. And while Cecilia wondered  at an absence so uncommon, Cecilia received a note from Lord Ernolf, to beg  permission to wait upon Cecilia for two minutes, at any time Cecilia would appoint. Cecilia readily sent word that Cecilia should be at home for the rest of the day, as  Cecilia wished much for an opportunity of immediately finishing every affair but  one, and setting Cecilia mind at liberty to think only of that which Cecilia desired  should prosper. Lord Ernolf was with Cecilia in half an hour. Cecilia found Lord Ernolf sensible and well bred,  extremely desirous to promote Cecilia alliance with Lord Ernolf son, and apparently as much  pleased with Cecilia as with Cecilia fortune. Lord Ernolf acquainted Cecilia that Lord Ernolf had  addressed Lord Ernolf to Mr Harrel long since, but had been informed that Cecilia was  actually engaged to Sir Robert Floyer: she was  actually engaged to Sir Robert Floyer should, therefore, have forborn  taking up any part of Cecilia time, had Lord Ernolf not, on the preceding day, while on a  visit at Mr Delvile's, been assured that Mr Harrel was mistaken, and that Cecilia  had not yet declared for any body. Lord Ernolf hoped, therefore, that Cecilia would allow  Lord Ernolf son the honour of waiting upon Cecilia, and permit his son the honour of waiting upon her to talk with Mr Briggs,  who his son the honour of waiting upon her understood was Cecilia acting guardian, upon such matters as ought to be  speedily adjusted. Cecilia thanked his son the honour of waiting upon her for the honour his son the honour of waiting upon her intended Cecilia, and confirmed the truth of  the account his son the honour of waiting upon her had heard in St James'-square, but at the same time told his son the honour of waiting upon her Cecilia  must decline receiving any visits from his son the honour of waiting upon her lordship's son, and entreated his son the honour of waiting upon her to  take no measure towards the promotion of an affair which never could succeed. his son the honour of waiting upon her seemed much concerned at Cecilia answer, and endeavoured for some time to soften  Cecilia, but found Cecilia so steady, though civil in Cecilia refusal, that his son the honour of waiting upon her was obliged,  however unwillingly, to give up his son the honour of waiting upon her attempt. " Cecilia, when his son the honour of waiting upon her was gone, reflected with much vexation on the readiness of the  Delviles to encourage his son the honour of waiting upon her visit; Cecilia considered, however, that the intelligence  his son the honour of waiting upon her had heard might possibly be gathered in general conversation; but Cecilia blamed  Cecilia that Cecilia had not led to some enquiry what part of the family his son the honour of waiting upon her had  seen, and who was present when the information was given his son the honour of waiting upon her. Mean while Cecilia found that neither coldness, distance, nor aversion were  sufficient to repress Sir Robert Floyer, who continued to persecute Cecilia with as  much confidence of success as could have arisen from the utmost encouragement.  Cecilia again, though with much difficulty, contrived to speak with Mr Harrel upon  the subject, and openly accused Mr Harrel of spreading a report abroad, as well as  countenancing an expectation at home, that had neither truth nor justice to  support as well as  . Mr Harrel, with Mr Harrel usual levity and carelessness, laughed at the charge, but  denied any belief in Cecilia displeasure, and affected to think Cecilia was merely  playing the coquet, while Sir Robert was not the less Cecilia decided choice. Provoked and wearied, Cecilia resolved no longer to depend upon any body but  Cecilia for the management of Cecilia own affairs, and therefore, to conclude the  business without any possibility of further cavilling, Cecilia wrote the following  note to Sir Robert Cecilia. To Sir Robert Floyer, Bart. Miss BEVERLEY presents Miss BEVERLEY compliments to Sir Robert Floyer, and as Miss BEVERLEY has  some reason to fear Mr Harrel did not explicitly acquaint Mr Harrel with Miss BEVERLEY answer  to the commission with which Mr Harrel was entrusted, Miss BEVERLEY thinks it necessary, in  order to obviate any possible misunderstanding, to take this method of  returning Mr Harrel thanks for the honour of Mr Harrel good opinion, but of begging at the  same time that Mr Harrel would not lose a moment upon Miss BEVERLEY account, as Miss BEVERLEY thanks are  all Miss BEVERLEY can now, or ever, offer in return. Portman-square, May 11th, 1779. To this note Cecilia received no answer: but Cecilia had the pleasure to observe  that Sir Robert forbore Sir Robert usual visit on the day Cecilia sent it, and, though Sir Robert  appeared again the day following, Sir Robert never spoke to Cecilia and seemed sullen and  out of humour. Yet still Mr Delvile Mr Delvile came not, and still, as Cecilia surprise encreased, Cecilia  tranquillity was diminished. Cecilia could form no excuse for Sir Robert delay, nor  conjecture any reason for Sir Robert absence. Every motive seemed to favour Sir Robert  seeking, and not one Sir Robert shunning Cecilia: the explanation which had so lately  passed had informed Sir Robert Sir Robert had no rival to fear, and the manner in which Sir Robert had  heard it assured Cecilia the information was not indifferent to Sir Robert; why, then, so  assiduous in Sir Robert visits when Sir Robert thought Cecilia engaged, and so slack in all  attendance when Sir Robert knew Cecilia was at liberty?
