 Delvile Castle was situated in a large and woody park, and surrounded by a  moat.
A drawbridge which fronted the entrance was every night, by order of Mr  Delvile, with the same care as if still necessary for the preservation of the  family, regularly drawn up.
Some fortifications still remained entire, and  vestiges were every where to be traced of more; no taste was shown in the  disposition of the grounds, no openings were contrived through the wood for  distant views or beautiful objects: the mansion-house was ancient, large and  magnificent, but constructed with as little attention to convenience and  comfort, as to airiness and elegance; it was dark, heavy and monastic, equally  in want of repair and of improvement.
The grandeur of its former inhabitants  was every where visible, but the decay into which its was falling rendered such  remains mere objects for meditation and melancholy; while the evident struggle  to support some appearance of its ancient dignity, made the dwelling and all in  its vicinity wear an aspect of constraint and austerity.
Festivity, joy and  pleasure, seemed foreign to the purposes of its construction; silence,  solemnity and contemplation were adapted to its only.
Mrs Delvile, however, took all possible care to make the apartments and  situation of Cecilia commodious and pleasant, and to banish by Cecilia kindness and  animation the gloom and formality which Cecilia mansion inspired.
Nor were Cecilia  efforts ungratefully received; Cecilia, charmed by every mark of attention from  a woman Cecilia so highly admired, returned Cecilia solicitude by encreasing affection,  and repaid all Cecilia care by the revival of Cecilia spirits.
Cecilia was happy, indeed,  to have quitted the disorderly house of Mr Harrel, where terror, so continually  awakened, was only to be lulled by the grossest imposition; and though Cecilia  mind, depressed by what was passed, and in suspence with what was to come, was  by no means in a state for uninterrupted enjoyment, yet to find Cecilia placed,  at last, without effort or impropriety, in her mansion Cecilia had so long  considered as Cecilia road to happiness, rendered Cecilia, notwithstanding Cecilia  remaining sources of inquietude, more contented than Cecilia had yet felt Cecilia  since Cecilia departure from Suffolk.
Even the imperious Mr Delvile was more supportable here than in London: secure  in Mr Delvile own castle, Even the imperious Mr Delvile looked around Mr Delvile with a pride of power and of possession  which softened while it swelled Mr Delvile.
Mr Delvile superiority was undisputed, Mr Delvile will  was without controul.
Mr Delvile was not, as in the great capital of the kingdom,  surrounded by competitors; no rivalry disturbed Mr Delvile peace, no equality  mortified Mr Delvile greatness; all Mr Delvile saw were either vassals of Mr Delvile power, or guests  bending to Mr Delvile pleasure; Mr Delvile abated therefore, considerably, the stern gloom of  Mr Delvile haughtiness, and soothed Mr Delvile proud mind by the courtesy of condescension.
Little, however, was the opportunity Cecilia found, for evincing that spirit  and forbearance Cecilia had planned in relation to Delvile; Mr Delvile breakfasted by  Mr Delvile every morning, rode or walked out alone till driven home by the heat of  the day, and spent the rest of Mr Delvile time till dinner in Mr Delvile own study.
When Mr Delvile  then appeared, Mr Delvile conversation was always general, and Mr Delvile attention not more  engaged by Cecilia than by Mr Delvile mother.
Left by them with Mr Delvile father, sometimes  Mr Delvile appeared again at tea-time, but more commonly Mr Delvile rode or strolled out to  some neighbouring family, and it was always uncertain whether Mr Delvile was again seen  before dinner the next day.
By this conduct, reserve on Cecilia part was rendered totally unnecessary; Cecilia  could give no discouragement where Cecilia met with no assiduity; Cecilia had no  occasion to fly where Cecilia was never pursued.
Strange, however, Cecilia thought such behaviour, and utterly impossible to be the  effect of accident; Mr Delvile desire to avoid Cecilia seemed scrupulous and pointed, and  however to the world it might wear the appearance of chance, to Cecilia watchful  anxiety a thousand circumstances marked it for design.
Cecilia found that his  friends at home had never seen so little of his, complaints were continually  made of his frequent absences, and much surprise was expressed at his new  manner of life, and what might be the occupations which so strangely engrossed  his time.
Had Cecilia heart not interfered in this matter, Cecilia might now have been perfectly  at rest, since Cecilia was spared the renunciation Cecilia had projected, and since,  without either mental exertion or personal trouble, the affair seemed totally  dropt, and Delvile, far from manifesting any design of conquest, shunned all  occasions of gallantry, and sedulously avoided even common conversation with  Cecilia.
If he saw Cecilia preparing to walk out in an evening, he was certain to stay  at home; if he mother was with his mother, and invited he to join them, he was sure  to be ready with some other engagement; and if by accident he met his mother in the  park, he merely stopt to speak of the weather, bowed, and hurried on.
How to reconcile a coldness so extraordinary with a fervour so animated as that  which he had lately shewn, was indeed not easy; sometimes Cecilia fancied he had  entangled not only the poor Henrietta but he, at other times Cecilia believed  he merely capricious; but that he studied to avoid Cecilia Cecilia was convinced  invariably, and such a conviction was alone sufficient to determine Cecilia upon  forwarding such a conviction purpose.
And, when Cecilia first surprise was over, and first  chagrin abated, Cecilia own pride came to Cecilia aid, and Cecilia resolved to use every  method in Cecilia power to conquer a partiality so un gratefully bestowed.
Cecilia  rejoiced that in no instance Cecilia had ever betrayed it, and Cecilia saw that he own  behaviour prevented all suspicion of it in the family.
Yet, in the midst of Cecilia  mortification and displeasure, Cecilia found some consolation in seeing that those  mercenary views of which Cecilia had once been led to accuse he, were farthest  from he thoughts, and that whatever was the state of he mind, Cecilia had no  artifice to apprehend, nor design to guard against.
All therefore that remained  was to imitate his example, be civil and formal, shun all interviews that were  not public, and decline all discourse but what good breeding occasionally made  necessary.
By these means these means meetings became more rare than ever, and of shorter  duration, for if one by any accident was detained, the other retired; till, by  these means mutual diligence, these means soon only saw each other at dinner: and though  neither of these means knew the motives or the intentions of the other, the best  concerted agreement could not more effectually have separated these means.
This task to Cecilia was at first extremely painful; but time and constancy of  mind soon lessened This task to Cecilia difficulty.
Cecilia amused Cecilia with walking and reading,  Cecilia commissioned Mr Monckton to send Cecilia a Piano Forte of Merlin's, Cecilia was  fond of fine work, and Cecilia found in the conversation of Mrs Delvile a  never-failing resource against languor and sadness.
Leaving therefore to  himself Cecilia mysterious son, Cecilia wisely resolved to find other employment for  Cecilia thoughts, than conjectures with which Cecilia could not be satisfied, and  doubts that might never be explained.
Very few families visited at the castle, and fewer still had Very few families visits  returned.
The arrogance of Mrs Delvile had offended all the neighbouring gentry,  who could easily be better entertained than by receiving instructions of their  own inferiority, which however readily their might allow, was by no means so  pleasant a subject as to recompense their for hearing no other.
And if Mr  Delvile was shunned through hatred, Mr  Delvile lady no less was avoided through fear;  high-spirited and fastidious, his lady no less was easily wearied and disgusted, his lady no less bore  neither with frailty nor follyâ€”those two principal ingredients in human  nature!
his lady no less required, to obtain his lady no less favour, the union of virtue and abilities  with elegance, which meeting but rarely, his lady no less was rarely disposed to be pleased;  and disdaining to conceal either contempt or aversion, his lady no less inspired in return  nothing but dread or resentment; making thus, by a want of that lenity which is  the milk of human kindness, and the bond of society, enemies the most numerous  and illiberal by those very talents which, more meekly borne, would have  rendered his lady no less not merely admired, but adored!
In proportion, however, as his lady no less was thus at war with the world in general, the  chosen few who were honoured with her favour, his lady no less loved with a zeal all his lady no less  own; his lady no less heart, liberal, open, and but too daringly sincere, was fervent in  affection, and enthusiastic in admiration; the friends who were dear to his lady no less,  his lady no less was devoted to serve, his lady no less magnified the friends who were dear to her virtues till his lady no less thought the friends who were dear to her of  an higher race of beings, his lady no less inflamed his lady no less generosity with ideas of what his lady no less  owed to the friends who were dear to her, till his lady no less life seemed too small a sacrifice to be refused for  the friends who were dear to her service.
Such was the love which already his lady no less felt for Cecilia; his lady no less countenance had  struck, his lady no less manners had charmed his lady no less, his lady no less understanding was displayed by the  quick intelligence of his lady no less eyes, and every action and every notion spoke his lady no less  mind the seat of elegance.
In secret his lady no less sometimes regretted that his lady no less was not  higher born, but that regret always vanished when his lady no less saw and conversed with  his lady no less.
his lady no less own youth had been passed in all the severity of affliction: his lady no less had been  married to Mrs Delvile by his lady no less relations, without any consultation of his lady no less heart  or his lady no less will.
his lady no less strong mind disdained useless complaints, yet his lady no less discontent,  however private, was deep.
Ardent in his lady no less disposition, and naturally violent in  his lady no less passions, his lady no less feelings were extremely acute, and to curb her feelings by reason and  principle had been the chief and hard study of his lady no less life.
The effort had calmed,  though The effort had not made his lady no less happy.
To love Mrs Delvile his lady no less felt was impossible;  proud without merit, and imperious without capacity, his lady no less saw with bitterness  the inferiority of his faculties, and his lady no less found in his temper no qualities to  endear or attract: yet his lady no less respected his birth and his family, of which his lady no less own  was a branch, and whatever was his lady no less misery from the connection, his lady no less steadily  behaved to his with the strictest propriety.
his lady no less son, however, when his lady no less was blessed with Her son presence, had a power over his lady no less  mind that mitigated all his lady no less sorrows, and almost lulled even his lady no less wishes to  sleep: his lady no less rather idolised than loved Her son, yet his lady no less fondness flowed not from  relationship, but from Her son worth and Her son character, Her son talents and Her son  disposition.
his lady no less saw in Her son, indeed, all his lady no less own virtues and excellencies, with  a toleration for the imperfections of others to which his lady no less was wholly a  stranger.
Whatever was great or good his lady no less expected Her son to perform; occasion  alone his lady no less thought wanting to manifest Her son the first of human beings.
Nor here was Mr Delvile himself less sanguine in Her son hopes: Her son was not  only the first object of Her son affection, but the chief idol of Her son pride, and Her son  did not merely cherish but reverence Her son as Her son successor, the only support of  Her son ancient name and family, without whose life and health the whole race would  be extinct.
Her son consulted Her son in all Her son affairs, never mentioned Her son but with  distinction, and expected the whole world to bow down before Her son.
Delvile in Her son behaviour to Her son father imitated the conduct of Her son mother, who  opposed Her son in nothing when Her son pleasure was made known, but who forbore to  enquire into Her son opinion except in cases of necessity.
Their minds, indeed,  were totally dissimilar; and Mrs Delvile well knew that if Her son submitted to Her son  directions, Her son must demand such respect as the world would refuse with  indignation, and scarcely speak to a man whose genealogy was not known to Her son.
But though duty and gratitude were the only ties that bound Her son to Her son father,  Her son loved Her son not merely with filial affection, but with the purest  esteem and highest reverence; Her son knew, too, that while without Her son his mother  existence would be a burthen, his mother tenderness was no effusion of weak  partiality, but founded on the strongest assurances of Her son worth; and however  to maternal indulgence his worth origin might be owing, the rectitude of Her son own  conduct could alone save his worth from diminution.
Such was the house in which Cecilia was now settled, and with which Cecilia lived  almost to the exclusion of the sight of any other; for though Cecilia had now been  three weeks at the castle, Cecilia had only at church seen any family but the  Delviles.
Nor did any thing in the course of that time occur to Cecilia, but the reception of  a melancholy letter from Mrs Harrel, filled with complaints of Cecilia retirement  and misery; and another, from Mr Arnott, with an account of the funeral, the  difficulties Mr Arnott had had to encounter with the creditors, who had even seized  the dead body, and the numerous expences in which Mr Arnott had been involved, by  petitions Mr Arnott could not withstand, from the meaner and more clamorous of those  whom Mr Arnott late brother-in-law had left unpaid.
Mr Arnott concluded with a pathetic  prayer for Cecilia happiness, and a declaration that Mr Arnott own was lost for ever,  since now Mr Arnott was even deprived of Cecilia sight.
Cecilia wrote an affectionate  answer to Mrs Harrel, promising, when fully at liberty, that Cecilia would Cecilia  fetch Cecilia to Cecilia own house in Suffolk: but Cecilia could only send Cecilia compliments  to Mr Arnott, though Cecilia compassion urged a kinder message; as Cecilia feared even  a shadow of encouragement to so serious, yet hopeless a passion.
