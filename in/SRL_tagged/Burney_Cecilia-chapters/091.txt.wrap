 Another week past still without any further intelligence. Cecilia was then  summoned to the parlour, and to Delvile himself. He looked hurried and anxious; yet the glow of his face, and the animation of  his eyes, immediately declared he at least came not to take leave of her. "Can you forgive," cried he, "the dismal and unsatisfactory letter I wrote you?  I would not disobey you twice in the same manner, and I could not till now have  written in any other." "The consultation with the physicians, then," said Cecilia, "is over?" "Alas, yes; and the result is most alarming; they all agree my mother is in a  dangerous way, and they rather forbear to oppose, than advise her going abroad:  but upon that she is earnestly bent, and intends to set out without delay. I  shall return to her, therefore, with all speed, and mean not to take any rest  till I have seen her." Cecilia expressed with tenderness her sorrow for Mrs Delvile: nor were her  looks illiberal in including her son in her concern. "I must hasten," he cried, "to the credentials by which I am authorised for  coming, and I must hasten to prove if Miss Beverley has not flattered my mother  in her appeal." He then informed her that Mrs Delvile, apprehensive for herself, and softened  for him by the confession of her danger, which she had extorted from her  physicians, had tenderly resolved upon making one final effort for his  happiness, and ill and impatient as she was, upon deferring her journey to wait  its effect. Generously, therefore, giving up her own resentment, she wrote to Mr Delvile in  terms of peace and kindness, lamenting their late dissention, and ardently  expressing her desire to be reconciled to him before she left England. She told  him the uncertainty of her recovery which had been acknowledged by her  physicians, who had declared a calmer mind was more essential to her than a  purer air. She then added, that such serenity was only to be given her, by the  removal of her anxiety at the comfortless state of her son. She begged him,  therefore, to make known the author of Miss Beverley's defamation, assuring  him, that upon enquiry, he would find her character and her fame as unsullied  as his own; and strongly representing, that after the sacrifice to which she  had consented, their son would be utterly dishonourable in thinking of any  other connexion. She then to this reasoning joined the most earnest  supplication, protesting, in her present disordered state, of health, her life  might pay the forfeiture of her continual uneasiness. "I held out," she concluded, "while his personal dignity, and the honour of his  name and family were endangered; but where interest alone is concerned, and  that interest is combated by the peace of his mind, and the delicacy of his  word, my opposition is at an end. And though our extensive and well founded  views for a splendid alliance are abolished, you will agree with me hereafter,  upon a closer inspection, that the object for whom he relinquishes them, offers  in herself the noblest reparation." Cecilia felt gratified, humbled, animated and depressed at once by this letter,  of which Delvile brought her a copy. "And what," cried she, "was the answer?" "I cannot in decency," he replied, "speak my opinion of it: read it  yourself,—and let me hear yours." To the Honourable Mrs Delvile. Your extraordinary letter, madam, has extremely surprised me. I had been  willing to hope the affair over from the time my disapprobation of it was  formally announced. I am sorry you are so much indisposed, but I cannot  conclude your health would be restored by my acceding to a plan so derogatory  to my house. I disapprove it upon every account, not only of the name and the  fortune, but the lady herself. I have reasons more important than those I  assign, but they are such as I am bound in honour not to mention. After such a  declaration, nobody, I presume, will affront me by asking them. Her defence you  have only from herself, her accusation I have received from authority less  partial. I command, therefore, that my son, upon pain of my eternal  displeasure, may never speak to me on the subject again, and I hope, madam,  from you the same complaisance to my request. I cannot explain myself further,  nor is it necessary; it is no news, I flatter myself, to Mortimer Delvile or  his mother, that I do nothing without reason, and I believe nothing upon slight  grounds. A few cold compliments concerning her journey, and the re-establishment of her  health, concluded the letter. Cecilia, having read, hastily returned it, and indignantly said, "My opinion,  Sir, upon this letter, must surely be yours; that we had done wiser, long  since, to have spared your mother and ourselves, those vain and fruitless  conflicts which we ought better to have foreseen were liable to such a  conclusion. Now, at least, let them be ended, and let us not pursue disgrace  wilfully, after suffering from it with so much rigour involuntarily." "O no," cried Delvile, "rather let us now spurn it for ever! those conflicts  must indeed be ended, but not by a separation still more bitter than all of  them." He then told her, that his mother, highly offended to observe by the extreme  coldness of this letter, the rancour he still nourished for the contest  preceding her leaving him, no longer now refused even her separate consent, for  a measure which she thought her son absolutely engaged to take. "Good heaven!" cried Cecilia, much amazed, "this from Mrs Delvile!—a separate  consent?"— "She has always maintained," he answered, "an independent mind, always judged  for herself, and refused all other arbitration: when so impetuously she parted  us, my father's will happened to be her's, and thence their concurrence: my  father, of a temper immoveable and stern, retains stubbornly the prejudices  which once have taken possession of him; my mother, generous as fiery, and  noble as proud, is open to conviction, and no sooner convinced, than ingenuous  in acknowledging it: and thence their dissention. From my father I may hope  forgiveness, but must never expect concession; from my mother I may hope all  she ought to grant, for pardon but her vehemence,—and she has every great  quality that can dignify human nature!" Cecilia, whose affection and reverence for Mrs Delvile were unfeigned, and who  loved in her son this filial enthusiasm, readily concurred with him in praising  her, and sincerely esteemed her the first among women. "Now, then," cried he, with earnestness, "now is the time when your generous  admiration of her is put to the test; see what she writes to you;—she has  left to me all explanation: but I insisted upon some credential, lest you  should believe I only owed her concurrence to a happy dream." Cecilia in much trepidation took the letter, and hastily run it over. To Miss Beverley. Misery, my sweet young friend, has long been busy with us all; much have we  owed to the clash of different interests, much to that rapacity which to enjoy  any thing, demands every thing, and much to that general perverseness which  labours to place happiness in what is with-held. Thus do we struggle on till we  can struggle no longer; the felicity with which we trifle, at best is but  temporary; and before reason and reflection shew its value, sickness and sorrow  are commonly become stationary. Be it yours, my love, and my son's, to profit by the experience, while you pity  the errors, of the many who illustrate this truth. Your mutual partiality has  been mutually unfortunate, and must always continue so for the interests of  both: but how blind is it to wait, in our own peculiar lots, for that  perfection of enjoyment we can all see wanting in the lot of others! My  expectations for my son had "outstepped the modesty of" probability. I looked  for rank and high birth, with the fortune of Cecilia, and Cecilia's rare  character. Alas! a new constellation in the heavens might as rationally have  been looked for! My extravagance, however, has been all for his felicity, dearer to me than  life,—dearer to me than all things but his own honour! Let us but save that,  and then let wealth, ambition, interest, grandeur and pride, since they cannot  constitute his happiness, be removed from destroying it. I will no longer play  the tyrant that, weighing good and evil by my own feelings and opinions,  insists upon his acting by the notions I have formed, whatever misery they may  bring him by opposing all his own. I leave the kingdom with little reason to expect I shall return to it; I leave  it—Oh blindness of vanity and passion!—from the effect of that violence  with which so lately I opposed what now I am content to advance! But the  extraordinary resignation to which you have agreed, shews your heart so wholly  my son's, and so even more than worthy the whole possession of his, that it  reflects upon him an honour more bright and more alluring, than any the most  illustrious other alliance could now confer. I would fain see you ere I go, lest I should see you no more; fain ratify by  word of mouth the consent that by word of mouth I so absolutely refused! I know  not how to come to Suffolk,—is it not possible you can come to London? I am  told you leave to me the arbitration of your fate, in giving you to my son, I  best shew my sense of such an honour. Hasten then, my love, to town, that I may see you once more! wait no longer a  concurrence thus unjustly with-held, but hasten, that I may bless the daughter  I have so often wished to own! that I may entreat her forgiveness for all the  pain I have occasioned her, and committing to her charge the future happiness  of my son, fold to my maternal heart the two objects most dear to it! AUGUSTA DELVILE. Cecilia wept over this letter with tenderness, grief and alarm; but declared,  had it even summoned her to follow her abroad, she could not, after reading it,  have hesitated in complying. "O now, then," cried Delvile, "let our long suspenses end! hear me with the  candour; my mother has already listened to me—be mine, my Cecilia, at  once,—and force me not, by eternal scruples, to risk another separation." "Good heaven, Sir!" cried Cecilia, starting, "in such a state as Mrs Delvile  thinks herself, would you have her journey delayed?" "No, not a moment! I would but ensure you mine, and go with her all over the  world!" "Wild and impossible!—and what is to be done with Mr Delvile?" "It is on his account wholly I am thus earnestly precipitate. If I do not by an  immediate marriage prevent his further interference, all I have already  suffered may again be repeated, and some fresh contest with my mother may  occasion another relapse." Cecilia, who now understood him, ardently protested she would not listen for a  moment to any clandestine expedient. He besought her to be patient; and then anxiously represented to her their  peculiar situations. All application to his father he was peremptorily forbid  making, all efforts to remove his prejudices their impenetrable mystery  prevented; a public marriage, therefore, with such obstacles, would almost  irritate him to phrenzy, by its daring defiance of his prohibition and  authority. "Alas!" exclaimed Cecilia, "we can never do right but in parting!" "Say it not," cried he, "I conjure you! we shall yet live, I hope, to prove the  contrary." "And can you, then," cried she, reproachfully, "Oh Mr Delvile! can you again  urge me to enter your family in secret?" "I grieve, indeed," he answered, "that your goodness should so severely be  tried; yet did you not condescend to commit the arbitration to my mother?" "True; and I thought her approbation would secure my peace of mind; but how  could I have expected Mrs Delvile's consent to such a scheme!" "She has merely accorded it from a certainty there is no other resource.  Believe me, therefore, my whole hope rests upon your present compliance. My  father, I am certain, by his letter, will now hear neither petition nor  defence; on the contrary, he will only enrage at the temerity of offering to  confute him. But when he knows you are his daughter, his honour will then be  concerned in yours, and it will be as much his desire to have it cleared, as it  is now to have it censured." "Wait at least your return, and let us try what can be done with him." "Oh why," cried Delvile, with much earnestness, "must I linger out month after  month in this wretched uncertainty! If I wait I am undone! my father, by the  orders I must unavoidably leave, will discover the preparations making without  his consent, and he will work upon you in my absence, and compel you to give me  up!" "Are you sure," said she, half smiling, "he would have so much power?" "I am but too sure, that the least intimation, in his present irritable state  of mind, reaching him of my intentions, would make him not scruple, in his  fury, pronouncing some malediction upon my disobedience that neither of us, I  must own, could tranquilly disregard." This was an argument that came home to Cecilia, whose deliberation upon it,  though silent, was evidently not unfavourable. He then told her that with respect to settlements, he would instantly have a  bond drawn up, similar to that prepared for their former intended union, which  should be properly signed and sealed, and by which he would engage himself to  make, upon coming to his estate, the same settlement upon her that was made  upon his mother. "And as, instead of keeping up three houses," he continued, "in the manner my  father does at present, I mean to put my whole estate out to nurse, while we  reside for a while abroad, or in the country, I doubt not but in a very few  years we shall be as rich and as easy as we shall desire." He told her, also, of his well-founded expectations from the Relations already  mentioned; which the concurrence of his mother with his marriage would thence  forward secure to him. He then, with more coherence, stated his plan at large. He purposed, without  losing a moment, to return to London; he conjured her, in the name of his  mother, to set out herself early the next day, that the following evening might  be dedicated wholly to Mrs Delvile: through her intercession he might then hope  Cecilia's compliance, and every thing on the morning after should be prepared  for their union. The long-desired ceremony over, he would instantly ride post  to his father, and pay him, at least, the respect of being the first to  communicate it. He would then attend his mother to the Continent, and leave the  arrangement of everything to his return. "Still, therefore, as a single man,"  he continued, "I mean to make the journey, and I shall take care, by the time I  return, to have all things in readiness for claiming my sweet Bride. Tell me,  then, now, if you can reasonably oppose this plan?" "Indeed," said Cecilia, after some hesitation, "I cannot see the necessity of  such violent precipitancy." "Do you not try me too much," cried Delvile, impatiently, "to talk now of  precipitancy! after such painful waiting, such wearisome expectation! I ask you  not to involve your own affairs in confusion by accompanying me abroad; sweet  to me as would be such an indulgence, I would not make a run-away of you in the  opinion of the world. All I wish is the secret certainty I cannot be robbed of  you, that no cruel machinations may again work our separation, that you are  mine, unalterably mine, beyond the power of caprice or ill fortune." Cecilia made no answer; tortured with irresolution, she knew not upon what to  determine. "We might then, according to the favour or displeasure of my father, settle  wholly abroad for the present, or occasionally visit him in England; my mother  would be always and openly our friend—Oh be firm, then, I conjure you, to the  promise you have given her, and deign to be mine on the conditions she  prescribes. She will be bound to you for ever by so generous a concession, and  even her health may be restored by the cessation of her anxieties. With such a  wife, such a mother, what will be wanting for me! Could I lament not being  richer, I must be rapacious indeed!—Speak, then, my Cecilia! relieve me from  the agony of this eternal uncertainty, and tell me your word is invariable as  your honour, and tell me my mother gives not her sanction in vain!" Cecilia sighed deeply, but, after some hesitation, said, "I little knew what I  had promised, nor know I now what to perform!—there must ever, I find, be  some check to human happiness! yet, since upon these terms, Mrs Delvile herself  is content to wish me of her family—" She stopt; but, urged earnestly by Delvile, added "I must not, I think,  withdraw the powers with which I entrusted her." Delvile, grateful and enchanted, now forgot his haste and his business, and  lost every wish but to re-animate her spirits: she compelled him, however, to  leave her, that his visit might less be wondered at, and sent by him a message  to Mrs. Delvile, that, wholly relying upon her wisdom, she implicitly submitted  to her decree.
