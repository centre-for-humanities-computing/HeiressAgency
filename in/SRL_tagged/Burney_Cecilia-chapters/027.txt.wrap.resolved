 Cecilia returned home so late, that  Cecilia was summoned to the dining parlour the  moment  Cecilia entered the house.  Cecilia morning dress, and  Cecilia long absence, excited  much curiosity in Mrs Harrel, which a quick succession of questions evasively  answered soon made general; and Sir Robert Floyer, turning to  Cecilia with a look  of surprise, said, "If you have such freaks as these, Miss Beverley, I must  begin to enquire a little more into your proceedings." "That, Sir," said Cecilia, very coldly, "would ill repay your trouble." "When we get  Cecilia to Violet Bank," cried Mr Harrel, "we shall be able to keep a  better watch over  Cecilia." "I hope so," answered Sir Robert; "though faith  Cecilia has been so demure, that I  never supposed  Cecilia did any thing but read sermons. However, I find there's no  going upon trust with women, any more than with money." "Ay, Sir Robert," cried Mrs Harrel, "you know I always advised you not to be  quite so easy, and I am sure I really think you deserve a little severity, for  not being more afraid." "Afraid of what, madam?" cried the baronet; "of a young lady's walking out  without me? Do you think I wish to be any restraint upon Miss Beverley's time  in a morning, while I have the happiness of waiting upon  Cecilia every afternoon?" Cecilia was thunderstruck by this speech, which not only expressed an open  avowal of his pretensions, but a confident security of his success. Cecilia was  shocked that a man of such principles should even for a moment presume upon Cecilia  favour, and irritated at the stubbornness of Mr. Harrel in not acquainting Mr. Harrel  with Cecilia refusal. Mr. Harrel intimation of coming to the house for the happiness of waiting upon Cecilia,  made Cecilia determine, without losing a moment, to seek Cecilia an explanation  with Mr. Harrel: while the discovery that Mr. Harrel was included in the Easter party, which  various other concomitant causes had already rendered disagreeable to Cecilia, made  Cecilia look forward to that purposed expedition with nothing but unwillingness and  distaste. But though Cecilia earnestness to conclude this affair made Cecilia now put Cecilia  voluntarily in the way of the baronet, Cecilia found Cecilia plan always counteracted  by Mr. Harrel, who, with an officiousness too obvious to pass for chance,  constantly stopt the progress of any discourse in which he did not he bear  a part. A more passionate admirer might not have been so easily defeated; but  Sir Robert, too proud for solicitation, and too indolent for assiduity, was  very soon checked, because very soon wearied. The whole evening, therefore, to Cecilia infinite mortification, passed away  without affording Cecilia any opportunity of making known to he he mistake. Cecilia next effort was to remonstrate with Mr. Harrel himself; but this scheme was  not more easy of execution than the other, since Mr. Harrel himself, suspecting Cecilia  meant again to dun Mr. Harrel himself for Cecilia money, avoided all separate conversation with  Cecilia so skilfully, that Cecilia could not find a moment to make Mr. Harrel himself hear Cecilia. Cecilia then resolved to apply to Mr. Harrel himself lady; but here Cecilia success was not better:  Mr. Harrel himself, dreading another lecture upon economy, peevishly answered to Cecilia  request of a conference, that Cecilia was not very well, and could not talk gravely. Cecilia, justly offended with them all, had now no resource but in Mr.  Monckton, whose counsel for effectually dismissing the baronet, Cecilia determined  to solicit by the first opportunity. The moment, therefore, that Cecilia next saw him, Cecilia acquainted him with the  speeches of Sir Robert and the behaviour of Mr. Harrel himself. There needed no rhetoric to point out to Mr. Monckton the danger of suffering  such expectations, or the impropriety of Cecilia present situation: Mr. Monckton was struck  with both in a manner the most forcible, and spared not for warmth of  expression to alarm Cecilia delicacy, or add to Cecilia displeasure. But chiefly Mr. Monckton was  exasperated against Mr. Harrel himself, assuring Cecilia there could be no doubt but that  Mr. Harrel himself had some particular interest in so strenuously and artfully supporting the  pretensions of Sir Robert. Cecilia endeavoured to refute this opinion, which  Cecilia regarded as proceeding rather from prejudice than justice; but when Cecilia  mentioned that the baronet was invited to spent the Easter holidays at  Violet-Bank, the baronet represented with such energy the consequent constructions of  the world, as well as the unavoidable encouragement such intimacy would imply,  that the baronet terrified Cecilia into an earnest entreaty to suggest to Cecilia some way of  deliverance. "There is only one;" answered the baronet, "you must peremptorily refuse to go to Violet  Bank yourself. If, after what has passed, you are included in the same party  with Sir Robert, you give a sanction yourself to the reports already circulated  of your engagements with I and the effect of such a sanction will be more  serious than you can easily imagine, since the knowledge that a connection is  believed in the world, frequently, if not generally, leads by imperceptible  degrees to Bank yourself real ratification." Cecilia, with the utmost alacrity, promised implicitly to follow his advice,  whatever might be the opposition of Mr Harrel. Mr Harrel quitted her, therefore, with  unusual satisfaction, happy in Mr Harrel power over her mind, and anticipating with  secret rapture the felicity Mr Harrel had in reserve from visiting her during the  absence of the family. As no private interview was necessary for making known her intention of giving  up the Easter party, which was to take place in two days' time, her mentioned  next morning her design of spending the holidays in town, when Mr Harrel  sauntered into the breakfast room to give some commission to Mr Harrel   lady. At first Mr Harrel   only laughed at her plan, gaily rallying her upon her love of  solitude; but when Mr Harrel   found it was serious, Mr Harrel   very warmly opposed it, and  called upon Mrs Harrel to join in Mr Harrel   expostulations. his lady complied, but  in so faint a manner, that her soon saw his lady did not wish to prevail; and  with a concern, that cost his lady infinite pain, now finally perceived that not  only all his lady former affection was subsided into indifference, but that, since  his lady had endeavoured to abridge his lady amusements, his lady regarded his lady as a spy, and  dreaded his lady as the censor of his lady conduct. Mean while Mr Arnott, who was present, though Mr Harrel   interfered not in the debate,  waited the event with anxiety; naturally hoping his lady objections arose from his lady  dislike of Sir Robert, and secretly resolving to be guided Sir Robert by her  motions. her at length, tired of the importunities of Mr Harrel, gravely  said, that if Sir Robert desired to hear the reasons which obliged his lady to refuse Sir Robert  request, his lady was ready to communicate them. Mr Harrel, after a little hesitation, accompanied his lady into another room. his lady then declared his lady resolution not to live under the same roof with Sir  Robert, and very openly expressed his lady vexation and displeasure, that Sir   so  evidently persisted in giving that gentleman encouragement. "My dear Miss Beverley," answered My dear Miss Beverley, carelessly, "when young ladies will not  know young ladies own minds, it is necessary some friend should tell it young ladies: you were  certainly very favourable to Sir Robert but a short time ago, and so, I dare  say, you will be again, when you have seen more of Sir Robert." "You amaze me, Sir Robert!" cried her: "when was I favourable to Sir Robert? Has Sir Robert not  always and regularly been my aversion?" "I fancy," answered Mr Harrel, laughing, "you will not easily persuade Sir Robert to  think so; your behaviour at the Opera-house was ill calculated to give Sir Robert that  notion." "My behaviour at the Opera-house, Sir Robert, I have already explained to you; and if  Sir Robert has any doubts, either from that circumstance or from any  other, pardon me if I say they can only be attributed to your unwillingness to  remove they. I entreat you, therefore, to trifle with Sir Robert no longer, nor to  subject me again to the freedom of implications extremely disagreeable to me." "O fie, fie, My dear Miss Beverley! after all that has passed, after Sir Robert long  expectations, and Sir Robert constant attendance, you cannot for a moment think  seriously of discarding Sir Robert." Cecilia, equally surprised and provoked by this speech, could not for a moment  tell how to answer this speech; and Mr Harrel, wilfully misinterpreting Cecilia silence,  took Cecilia hand, and said, "Come, I am sure you have too much, honour to make a  fool of such a man as Sir Robert Floyer. There is not a woman in town who will  not envy your choice, and I assure you there is not a man in England I would so  soon recommend to you." a man in England I would so  soon recommend to you would then have hurried Cecilia back to the next room; but, drawing away Cecilia  hand with undisguised resentment, "No, Sir Robert," Cecilia cried, "this must not pass! my  positive rejection of Sir Robert the instant you communicated to me Sir Robert  proposals, you can neither have forgotten nor mistaken: and you must not wonder  if I acknowledge me extremely disobliged by your unaccountable perseverance  in refusing to receive my answer." "Young ladies who have been brought up in the country," returned Mr Harrel,  with Sir Robert usual negligence, "are always so high flown in their notions, it is  difficult to deal with their; but as I am much better acquainted with the world  than you can be, you must give me leave to tell you, that if, after all, you  refuse Sir Robert, it will be using Sir Robert very ill." "Why will you say so, Sir Robert?" cried Cecilia, "when it is utterly impossible you  can have formed so preposterous an opinion. Pray hear me, however, finally, and  pray tell Sir Robert Robert—" "No, no," interrupted Sir Robert, with affected gaiety, "you shall manage it all your  own way; I will have nothing to do with the quarrels of lovers." And then, with a pretended laugh, Sir Robert hastily left Cecilia. Cecilia was so much incensed by this impracticable behaviour, that instead of  returning to the family, Cecilia went directly to the next room. It was easy for Cecilia  to see that Mr Harrel was bent upon using every method Mr Harrel could devise, to  entangle Cecilia into some engagement with Sir Robert, and though Cecilia could not  imagine the meaning of such a scheme, the littleness of Mr Harrel behaviour excited  Cecilia contempt, and the long-continued error of the baronet gave Cecilia the utmost  uneasiness. Cecilia again determined to seek an explanation with the baronet Cecilia, and  immovably to refuse joining the same party  with Sir Robert to Violet Bank. The following day, while the ladies and Mr Arnott were at breakfast, Mr Harrel  came into the next room to enquire if the ladies and Mr Arnott should all be ready to set off for Mr Harrel    villa by ten o'clock the next day. Mr Harrel   and Mr Harrel   brother answered in the  affirmative; but Cecilia was silent, and Mr Harrel   turned to Cecilia and repeated Mr Harrel    question. "Do you think me so capricious, Sir Robert," said Cecilia, "that after telling you but  yesterday I could not be of the same party  with Sir Robert, I shall tell you to-day that I can?" "Why you do not really mean to remain in town by yourself?" replied Mr Harrel  , "you  cannot suppose that will be an eligible plan for a young lady. On the contrary,  it will be so very improper, that I think yourself, as your Guardian, obliged to  oppose Guardian." Amazed at this speech, Cecilia looked at Mr Harrel   with a mixture of  mortification and anger; but knowing it would be vain to resist Mr Harrel   power if Mr Harrel    was resolute to exert his power, Cecilia made not any answer. "Besides," Mr Harrel   continued, "I have a plan for some alterations in the house  during my absence; and I think your room, in particular, will be much improved  by particular: but it will be impossible to employ any workmen, if we do not all quit  the premises." This determined persecution now seriously alarmed Cecilia; Cecilia saw that Mr Harrel  would omit no expedient or stratagem to encourage the addresses of Sir Robert,  and force Cecilia into Mr Harrel   presence; and Cecilia began next to apprehend that Cecilia  connivance in Mr Harrel   conduct might be presumed upon by that gentleman: Cecilia  resolved, therefore, as the last and only effort in Cecilia power for avoiding Mr Harrel  ,  to endeavour to find an accommodation at the house of Mrs Delvile, during the  excursion to Violet Bank: and if, when Cecilia returned to Portman-square, the  baronet still persevered in the  baronet attendance, to entreat Cecilia friend Mr Monckton  would take upon her friend Mr Monckton   the charge of undeceiving her friend Mr Monckton  .
