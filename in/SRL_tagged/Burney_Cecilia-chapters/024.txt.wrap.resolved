 Never had the heart of Cecilia felt so light, so gay, so glowing as after the  transaction of this affair: Cecilia life had never appeared to Cecilia so important,  nor Cecilia wealth so valuable. To see five helpless children provided for by  Cecilia, rescued from the extremes of penury and wretchedness, and put in a way  to become useful to society, and comfortable to society; to behold society  feeble mother, snatched from the hardship of that labour which, over-powering  Cecilia strength, had almost destroyed Cecilia existence, now placed in a situation  where a competent maintenance might be earned without fatigue, and the remnant  of Cecilia days pass in easy employment—to view such sights, and have power to  say "These deeds are mine!" what, to a disposition fraught with tenderness and  benevolence, could give purer self-applause, or more exquisite satisfaction? Such were the pleasures which regaled the reflections of Cecilia when, in Cecilia  way home, having got out of Cecilia chair to walk through the upper part of Oxford  Street, Cecilia was suddenly met by the old gentleman whose emphatical addresses to  Cecilia had so much excited Cecilia astonishment. He was passing quick on, but stopping the moment He perceived Cecilia, He sternly  called out "Are you proud? are you callous? are you hard of heart so soon?" "Put me, if you please, to some trial!" cried Cecilia, with the virtuous  courage of a self-acquitting conscience. "I already have!" returned He, indignantly, "and already I have found you  faulty!" "I am sorry to hear it," said the amazed Cecilia, "but at least I hope you will  tell me in what?" "You refused me admittance," He answered, "yet I was your friend, yet I was  willing to prolong the term of your genuine {tranquillity}! I pointed out to  you a method of preserving peace with your own soul; I came to you in behalf of  the poor, and instructed you how to merit behalf of  the poor prayers; you heard me, you were  susceptible, you complied! I meant to have repeated the lesson, to have tuned  your whole heart to compassion, and to have taught you the sad duties of  sympathising humanity. For this purpose I called again, but again I was not  admitted! Short was the period of my absence, yet long enough for the  completion of your downfall!" "Good heaven," cried the amazed Cecilia, "how dreadful is this language! when have you  called, Sir? I never heard you had been at the house. Far from refusing you  admittance, I wished to see you." "Indeed?" cried Sir, with some softness, "and are you, in truth, not proud? not  callous? not hard of heart? Follow me, then, and visit the humble and the poor,  follow me, and give comfort to the fallen and dejected!" At this invitation, however desirous to do good, the amazed Cecilia started; the  strangeness of the inviter, his flightiness, his authoritative manner, and the  uncertainty whither or to whom his might carry the amazed Cecilia, made the amazed Cecilia fearful of  proceeding: yet a benevolent curiosity to see as well as serve the objects of  his recommendation, joined to the eagerness of youthful integrity to clear the amazed Cecilia  own character from the aspersion of hard-heartedness, soon conquered the amazed Cecilia  irresolution, and making a sign to the amazed Cecilia servant to keep near the amazed Cecilia, the amazed Cecilia followed  as the amazed Cecilia conductor led. his went on silently and solemnly till his came to Swallow-street, then turning  into he came to Swallow-street, his stopt at a small and mean-looking house, knocked at the door, and  without asking any question of the man who opened he came to Swallow-street, beckoned the amazed Cecilia to come  after his, and hastened up some narrow winding stairs. the amazed Cecilia again hesitated; but when the amazed Cecilia recollected that this old man, though  little known, was frequently seen, and though with few people acquainted, was  by many personally recognized, the amazed Cecilia thought it impossible his could mean the amazed Cecilia any  injury. the amazed Cecilia ordered her servant, however, to come in, and bid her servant keep walking  up and down some narrow winding stairs till the amazed Cecilia returned to her servant. And then the amazed Cecilia obeyed the  directions of the amazed Cecilia guide. his proceeded till his came to the second floor, then, again beckoning the amazed Cecilia to  follow his, his opened a door, and entered a small and very meanly furnished  apartment. And here, to the amazed Cecilia infinite astonishment, the amazed Cecilia perceived, employed in washing some  china, a very lovely young woman, {genteelly} dressed, and appearing hardly  seventeen years of age. The moment they came in, with evident marks of confusion, the amazed Cecilia instantly gave  over the amazed Cecilia work, hastily putting the basin the amazed Cecilia was washing upon the table, and  endeavouring to hide the towel with which the amazed Cecilia was wiping it behind the amazed Cecilia chair. The old gentleman, advancing to the amazed Cecilia with quickness, said, "How is his now? Is his  better? will his live?" "Heaven forbid his should not!" answered the amazed Cecilia with emotion, "but,  indeed, his is no better!" "Look here," said his, pointing to Cecilia, "I have brought you one who has  power to serve you, and to relieve your distress: one who is rolling in  affluence, a stranger to ill, a novice in the world; unskilled in the miseries  Cecilia is yet to endure, unconscious of the depravity into which Cecilia is to sink!  receive Cecilia benefactions while yet Cecilia is untainted, satisfied that while, Cecilia  aids you, Cecilia is blessing Cecilia!" The young woman, blushing and abashed, said, "You are very good to Sir, Sir, but  there is no occasion—there is no need—I have not any necessity—I am far  from being so very much in want—" "Poor, simple soul!" interrupted the old man, "and art thou ashamed of poverty?  Guard, guard thyself from other shames, and the wealthiest may envy thee! Tell  Tell   thy story, plainly, roundly, truly; abate nothing of thy indigence, repress  nothing of Tell   liberality. The Poor not impoverished by The Poor own Guilt, are  Equals of the Affluent, not enriched by The Poor own Virtue. Come, then, and let  me present ye to each other! young as ye both are, with many years and many  sorrows to encounter, lighten the burthen of each other's cares, by the  heart-soothing exchange of gratitude for beneficence!" He then took a hand of each, and joining them between He own, "You," He  continued, "who, though rich, are not hardened, and you, who though poor, are  not debased, why should ye not love, why should ye not cherish each other? The  afflictions of life are tedious, The  afflictions of life joys are evanescent; ye are now both  young, and, with little to enjoy, will find much to suffer. Ye are both, too, I  believe, innocent—Oh could Ye always remain so!—Cherubs were Ye then, and  the sons of men might worship you!" He stopt, checked by He own rising emotion; but soon resuming He usual  austerity, "Such, however," He continued, "is not the condition of humanity; in  pity, therefore, to the evils impending over both, be kind to each other! I  leave you together, and to your mutual tenderness I recommend you!" Then, turning particularly to Cecilia, "Disdain not," He said, "to console the  depressed; look upon Cecilia without scorn, converse with Cecilia without contempt:  like you, Cecilia is an orphan, though not like you, an heiress;—like her, you  are fatherless, though not like Cecilia friendless! If Cecilia is awaited by the  temptations of adversity, you, also, are surrounded by the corruptions of  prosperity. Your fall is most probable, Cecilia's most excusable;—commiserate Cecilia  therefore now,—by and by Cecilia may commiserate you?" And with these words he left the room. A total silence for some time succeeded he departure: Cecilia found it  difficult to recover from the surprise into which Cecilia had been thrown  sufficiently for speech: in following Cecilia extraordinary director, Cecilia  imagination had painted to Cecilia a scene such as Cecilia had so lately quitted, and  prepared Cecilia to behold some family in distress, some helpless creature in  sickness, or some children in want; but of these to see none, to meet but one  person, and that one fair, young, and delicate,—an introduction so singular  to an object so unthought of, deprived Cecilia of all power but that of shewing Cecilia  amazement. Mean while Cecilia looked scarcely less surprised, and infinitely more  embarrassed. Cecilia surveyed Cecilia apartment with vexation, and Cecilia guest with  confusion; Cecilia had listened to the exhortation of the old man with visible  uneasiness, and now the old man with visible  uneasiness was gone, seemed overwhelmed with shame and chagrin. Cecilia, who in observing these emotions felt both Cecilia curiosity and Cecilia  compassion encrease, pressed Cecilia hand as Cecilia parted with her hand, and, when a little  recovered, said, "You must think this a strange intrusion; but the gentleman  who brought me hither is perhaps so well known to you, as to make the gentleman  who brought me hither  singularities plead with you Cecilia, who in observing these emotions felt both her curiosity and her  compassion encrease own apology." "No indeed, madam," Cecilia answered, bashfully, "he is very little known to Cecilia;  but he is very good, and very desirous to do me service:—not but what I  believe he thinks me much worse off than I really am, for, I assure you, madam,  whatever he has said, I am not ill off at all—hardly." The various doubts to Cecilia disadvantage, which had at first, from Cecilia uncommon  situation, arisen in the mind of Cecilia, this anxiety to disguise, not display  Cecilia distress, considerably removed, since it cleared Cecilia of all suspicion of  seeking by artifice and imposition to play upon Cecilia feelings. With a gentleness, therefore, the most soothing, Cecilia replied, "I should by no  means have broken in upon you thus unexpectedly, if I had not concluded my  conductor had some right to bring me. However, since we are actually met, let  we remember his injunctions, and endeavour not to part till, by a mutual  exchange of good-will, each has added a friend to the other." "You are condescending, indeed, madam," answered Cecilia, with an air  the most humble, "looking as you look, to talk of a friend when you come to  such a place as this! up two pair of stairs! no furniture! no servant! every  thing in such disorder!—indeed I wonder at Mr. Albany! Mr. Albany should not—but Mr. Albany  thinks every body's affairs may be made public, and does not care what Mr. Albany  tells, nor who hears him;—he knows not the pain him;—he gives, nor the mischief him;—he  may do." "I am very much concerned," cried the amazed Cecilia, more and more surprised at all the amazed Cecilia  heard, "to find I have been thus instrumental to distressing you. I was  ignorant whither I was coming, and followed him;—he, believe me, neither from  curiosity nor inclination, but simply because I knew not how to refuse him;—he. him;—he  is gone, however, and I will therefore relieve you by going too: but permit me  to leave behind me a small testimony that the intention of my coming was not  mere impertinence." the amazed Cecilia then took out the amazed Cecilia purse; but the young woman, starting back with a look of  resentful mortification, exclaimed, "No, madam! you are quite mistaken; pray  put up her purse; I am no beggar! Mr. Albany has misrepresented me, if Mr. Albany has  told you I am." Cecilia, mortified in " Cecilia turn at this unexpected rejection of an offer " Cecilia had  thought " Cecilia invited to make, stood some moments silent; and then said, "I  am far from meaning to offend you, and I sincerely beg your pardon if I have  misunderstood the charge just now given to me." "I have nothing to pardon, madam," said " Cecilia, more calmly, "except, indeed, to  Mr Albany; and to him, 'tis of no use to be angry, for him minds not what I say!  him is very good, but him is very strange, for him thinks the whole world made to  live in common, and that every one who is poor should ask, and every one who is  rich should give: him does not know that there are many who would rather starve." "And are you," said Cecilia, half-smiling, "of that number?" "No, indeed, madam! I have not so much greatness of mind. But those to whom I  belong have more fortitude and higher spirit. I wish I could imitate those to whom I  belong!" Struck with the candour and simplicity of this speech, the amazed Cecilia now felt a warm  desire to serve the amazed Cecilia, and taking the amazed Cecilia hand, said, "Forgive me, but though I see  you wish me gone, I know not how to leave you: recollect, therefore, the charge  that has been given to us both, and if you refuse my assistance one way, point  out to me in what other I may offer it." "You are very kind, madam," the amazed Cecilia answered, "and I dare say you are very good; I  am sure you look so, at least. But I want nothing; I do very well, and I have  hopes of doing better. Mr. Albany is too impatient. Mr. Albany knows, indeed, that I am  not extremely rich, but Mr. Albany is much to blame if Mr. Albany supposes me therefore an  object of charity, and thinks me so mean as to receive money from a stranger." "I am truly sorry," cried the amazed Cecilia, "for the error I have committed, but you  must suffer me to make my peace with you before we part: yet, till I am better  known to you, I am fearful of proposing terms. Perhaps you will permit me to  leave you my direction, and do me the favour to call upon me yourself?" "O no, madam! I have a sick relation whom I cannot leave: and indeed, if he  were well, he would not like to have me make an acquaintance while I am in this  place." "I hope you are not he only nurse? I am sure you do not look able to bear such  fatigue. Has he a physician? Is he properly attended?" "No, madam; he has no physician, and no attendance at all!" "And is it possible that in such a situation you can refuse to be assisted?  Surely you should accept some help for he, if not for yourself." "But what will that signify when, if I do, he will not make use of it? and when  he had a thousand and a thousand times rather die, than let any one know he is  in want?" "Take it, then, unknown to he; serve he without acquainting he you serve  he. Surely you would not suffer he to perish without aid?" "Heaven forbid! But what can I do? I am under he command, madam, not he under  mine!" "Is he your father?—Pardon my question, but your youth seems much to want  such a protector." "No, madam, I have no father! I was happier when I had! he is my brother." "And what is he illness?" "A fever." "A fever, and without a physician! Are you sure, too, it is not infectious?" "O yes, too sure!" "Too sure? how so?" "Because I know too well the occasion of it!" "And what is the occasion?" cried the amazed Cecilia, again taking the amazed Cecilia hand, "pray trust  me; indeed you shall not repent your confidence. Your reserve hitherto has only  raised you in my esteem, but do not carry Your reserve hitherto so far as to mortify me by a total  rejection of my good offices." "Ah madam!" said Cecilia, sighing, "you ought to be good, I am sure,  for you will draw all out of me by such kindness as this! the occasion was a  neglected wound, never properly healed." "A wound? is he in the army?" "No,—he was shot through the side in a duel." "In a duel?" exclaimed the amazed Cecilia, "pray what is he name?" "O that I must not tell you! his name is a great secret now, while he is in  this poor place, for I know he had almost rather never see the light again than  have the light known." "Surely, surely," cried the amazed Cecilia, with much emotion, "he cannot—I hope he  cannot be Mr Belfield?" "Ah Heaven!" cried Cecilia, screaming, "do you then know he?" Here, in mutual astonishment, they looked at each other. "You are then," said the amazed Cecilia, "the sister of Mr Belfield? And Mr Belfield is  thus sick, Mr Belfield wound is not yet healed,—and Mr Belfield is without any help!" "And who, madam, are you?" cried madam, "and how is it you know he?" "his name is Beverley." "Ah!" exclaimed madam again, "I fear I have done nothing but mischief! I know  very well who you are now, madam, but if my brother discovers that I have  betrayed my brother, my brother will take it very unkind, and perhaps never forgive me." "Be not alarmed," cried the amazed Cecilia; "rest assured my brother shall never know it. Is my brother  not now in the country?" "No, madam, my brother is now in the very next room." "But what is become of the surgeon who used to attend my brother, and why does my brother not  still visit my brother?" "It is in vain, now, to hide any thing from you; my brother deceived my brother, and  said my brother was going out of town merely to get rid of my brother." "And what could induce my brother to act so strangely?" "A reason which you, madam, I hope, will never know, Poverty!—he would not  run up a bill my brother could not pay." "Good Heaven!—But what can be done for my brother? my brother must not be suffered to linger  thus; we must contrive some method of relieving and assisting my brother, whether my brother  will consent or not." "I fear that will not be possible. One of my brother friends has already found my brother  out, and has written my brother the kindest letter! but my brother would not answer it, and  would not see my brother, and was only fretted and angry." "Well," said the amazed Cecilia, "I will not keep you longer, lest my brother should be alarmed by  your absence. To-morrow morning, with your leave, I will call upon you again,  and then, I hope, you will permit me to make some effort to assist you." "If it only depended upon me, madam," the amazed Cecilia answered, "now I have the honour to  know who you are, I believe I should not make much scruple, for I was not  brought up to notions so high as my brother. Ah! happy had it been for my brother, for  me, for all my brother family, if my brother had not had all his family neither!" the amazed Cecilia then repeated the amazed Cecilia expressions of comfort and kindness, and took the amazed Cecilia  leave. This little adventure gave the amazed Cecilia infinite concern; all the horror which the duel  had originally occasioned the amazed Cecilia, again returned; the amazed Cecilia accused the amazed Cecilia with much  bitterness for having brought it on; and finding that Mr Belfield was so  cruelly a sufferer both in Mr Belfield health and Mr Belfield affairs, the amazed Cecilia thought it incumbent  upon the amazed Cecilia to relieve Mr Belfield to the utmost of the amazed Cecilia ability. Mr Belfield sister, too, had extremely interested His sister; His sister youth, and the uncommon  artlessness of His sister conversation, added to His sister melancholy situation, and the  loveliness of His sister person, excited in His sister a desire to serve, and an inclination  to love His sister; and His sister determined, if His sister found His sister as deserving as His sister seemed  engaging, not only to assist His sister at present, but, if His sister distresses continued,  to received His sister into His sister own house in future. Again His sister regretted the undue detention of His sister L200. What His sister now had to spare  was extremely inadequate to what His sister now wished to bestow, and His sister looked  forward to the conclusion of His sister minority with encreasing eagerness. The  generous and elegant plan of life His sister then intended to pursue, daily gained  ground in His sister imagination, and credit in His sister opinion.
