 On the fourth day the house wore a better aspect; Delvile's fever was gone, and  Dr Lyster permitted Dr Lyster to leave Dr Lyster room: a cough, however, remained, and Dr Lyster  journey to Bristol was settled to take place in three days. Cecilia, knowing Dr Lyster  was now expected down stairs, hastened out of the parlour the moment she had  finished she breakfast; for affected by Dr Lyster illness, and hurt at the  approaching separation, she dreaded the first meeting, and wished to fortify  she mind for bearing it with propriety. In a very few minutes, Lady Honoria, running after she, entreated that she  would come down; "for Mortimer," she cried, "is in the parlour, and the poor  child is made so much of by its papa and mama, that I wish its papa and mama don't half kill  Dr Lyster by its papa and mama ridiculous fondness. It is amazing to she Dr Lyster is so patient with  its papa and mama, for if its papa and mama teized me half as much, I should be ready to jump up and  shake its papa and mama. But I wish you would come down, for I assure you it's a comical  scene." "Your ladyship is soon diverted! but what is there so comical in the anxiety of  parents for an only son?" "Lord, they don't care a straw for an only son all the time! it's merely that an only son may  live to keep up this old castle, which I hope in my heart an only son will pull down the  moment they are dead! But do pray come; it will really give you spirits to see  they. The father keeps ringing the bell to order half a hundred pair of  boots for The father, and all the greatcoats in the county; and the mother sits and  looks as if a hearse and mourning coach were already coming over the  drawbridge: but the most diverting object among a hearse and mourning coach is my Lord Derford! O, it  is really too entertaining to see The father! there my Lord Derford sits, thinking the whole time  of my Lord Derford challenge! I intend to employ my Lord Derford all this afternoon in practising to  shoot at a mark." And then again the mother pressed the mother to join the group, and Cecilia, fearing the mother  opposition might seem strange, consented. Delvile arose at the mother entrance, and, with tolerable steadiness, Delvilecongratulated my Lord Derford on my Lord Derford recovery: and then, taking the mother usual seat, employed  the mother in embroidering a screen. the mother joined too, occasionally, in the  conversation, and observed, not without surprise, that Delvile seemed much less  dejected than before my Lord Derford confinement. Soon after, my Lord Derford ordered my Lord Derford horse, and, accompanied by my Lord Derford, rode out.  Delvile then took my Lord Derford to shew my Lord Derford some intended improvements in  another part of the castle, and Lady Honoria walked away in search of any  entertainment Lady Honoria could find. Delvile, in better spirits than Delvile had been for many days, sent for Delvile  own work, and sitting by Cecilia, conversed with Delvile again as in former times;  mixing instruction with entertainment, and general satire with particular  kindness, in a manner at once so lively and so flattering, that Cecilia herself  reviving, found but little difficulty in bearing Delvile part in the conversation. And thus, with some gaiety, and tolerable ease, was spent the greatest part of  the morning; but just as they were talking of changing they dress for dinner,  Lady Honoria with an air of the utmost exultation, came flying into the room.  "Well, ma'am," Delvile cried, "I have some news now that I must tell you, because  it will make you believe me another time though I know it will put you in a  passion." "That's sweetly designed, at least!" said Delvile, laughing; "however, I'll  trust you, for my passions will not, just now, be irritated by straws." "Why, ma'am, don't you remember I told you when you were in town that Mr  Mortimer kept a mistress—" "Yes!" cried Mrs Delvile, disdainfully, "and you may remember, Lady Honoria, I  told Lady Honoria" "O, you would not believe a word of it! but it's all true, I assure you! and  now Mortimer has brought Delvile down here; Mortimer sent for Delvile about three weeks ago, and Mortimer  has boarded Delvile at a cottage, about half a mile from the Park-gate." Cecilia, to whom Henrietta Belfield was instantly present, changed colour  repeatedly, and turned so extremely sick, Delvile could with difficulty keep Delvile  seat. Delvile forced Delvile, however, to continue Delvile work, though Delvile knew so  little what Delvile was about, that Delvile put Delvile needle in and out of the same place  without ceasing. Meanwhile Mrs Delvile, with a countenance of the utmost indignation, exclaimed,  "Lady Honoria, if you think a tale of scandal such as this reflects no disgrace  upon such as this relater, you must pardon me for entreating you to find an auditor more  of the same opinion than Nay." "Nay, ma'am, since you are so angry, I'll tell you the whole affair, for this  is but half of this  . He has a child here, too,—I vow I long to see it!—and He  is so fond of it!—and that He spends half He time in nursing it;—and that, I  suppose, is the thing that takes He out so much; and I fancy, too, that's what  has made He grow so grave, for may be He thinks it would not be pretty to be  very frisky, now He's a papa." Not only Cecilia, but Mrs Delvile herself was now overpowered, and Mrs Delvile herself sat for  some time wholly silent and confounded; "Lady Honoria, turning to Cecilia  exclaimed, "Bless me, Miss Beverley, what are you about! why that flower is the  most ridiculous thing I ever saw! you have spoilt your whole work." Cecilia  , in the utmost confusion, though pretending to laugh, then began to  unpick it; and Mrs Delvile, recovering, more calmly, though not less angrily,  said "And has this tale the honour of being invented solely by your ladyship,  or had it any other assistant?" "O no, I assure you, it's no invention of mine; I had it from very good  authority upon my word. But only look at Miss Beverley! would not one think I  had said that Miss Beverley had a child herself? Miss Beverley looks as pale as death. My dear, I  am sure you can't be well?" "I beg your pardon," cried Cecilia  , forcing a smile, though extremely provoked  with Miss Beverley; "I never was better." And then, with the hope of appearing unconcerned, Miss Beverley raised Miss Beverley head; but  meeting the eyes of Mrs Delvile fixed upon Miss Beverley face with a look of penetrating  observation, abashed and guilty, Miss Beverley again dropt it, and resumed Miss Beverley work. "Well, My dear," said Lady Honoria, "I am sure there is no occasion to send for  Dr Lyster to Lady Honoria, for you recover yourself in a moment: you have the finest  colour now I ever saw: has not Miss Beverley, Mrs Delvile? did you ever see anybody blush  so becomingly?" "I wish, Lady Honoria," said Mrs Delvile, with severity, "it were possible to  see you blush!" "O but I never do! not but what it's pretty enough too; but I don't know how it  is, it never happens. Now Euphrasia can blush from morning to night. I can't  think how Euphrasia contrives it. Miss Beverley, too, plays at it vastly well; Miss Beverley's  red and white, and white and red half a dozen times in a minute. Especially,"  looking at Miss Beverley archly, and lowering Miss Beverley voice, "if you talk to Miss Beverley of Mortimer!" "No, indeed! no such thing!" cried Cecilia with some resentment, and again  looking up; but glancing Cecilia eyes towards Mrs Delvile, and again meeting hers,  filled with the strongest expression of enquiring solicitude, unable to sustain  their inquisition, and shocked to find Cecilia thus watchfully observed, Cecilia  returned in hasty confusion to Cecilia employment. "Well, my dear," cried Lady Honoria, again, "but what are you about now? do you  intend to unpick the whole screen?" "How can Cecilia tell what Cecilia is doing," said Mrs Delvile, with quickness, "if you  torment Cecilia thus incessantly? I will take you away from Cecilia, that Cecilia may have  a little peace. You shall do me the honour to attend my toilette, and acquaint  me with some further particulars of this extraordinary discovery." Mrs Delvile then left the room, but Lady Honoria, before Mrs Delvile followed Mrs Delvile, said  in a low voice "Pity me, Miss Beverley, if you have the least good-nature! I am  now going to hear a lecture of two hours long!" Cecilia, left to Cecilia was in a perturbation almost insupportable: Mrs Delvilemysterious conduct seemed the result of some entanglement of vice; Henrietta  Belfield, the artless Henrietta Belfield, Henrietta   feared had been abused, and Henrietta    own ill-fated partiality, which now more than ever Henrietta   wished unknown even to  Henrietta  , was evidently betrayed where most the dignity of Henrietta   mind made Henrietta    desire it to be concealed! In this state of shame, regret and resentment, which made Henrietta   forget to change  Henrietta   dress, or Henrietta   place, Henrietta   was suddenly surprised by Mrs Delvile. Starting and colouring, Henrietta   busied Henrietta   with collecting Henrietta   work, that Henrietta    might hurry out of the room. Delvile, though silent himself, endeavoured to  assist Henrietta  ; but when Henrietta   would have gone, himself attempted to stop Henrietta  , saying  "Miss Beverley, for three minutes only." "No, sir," cried Henrietta  , indignantly, "not for an instant!" and leaving sir  utterly astonished, Henrietta   hastened to Henrietta   own apartment. Henrietta   was then sorry Henrietta   had been so precipitate; nothing had been clearly proved  against sir; no authority was so likely to be fallacious as that of Lady  Lady Honoria; neither was sir under any engagement to Henrietta   that could give Henrietta   any  right to manifest such displeasure. These reflections, however, came too late,  and the quick feelings of Henrietta   agitated mind were too rapid to wait the dictates  of cool reason. At dinner Henrietta   attended wholly to Lord Ernolf, whose assiduous  politeness, profiting by the humour, saved Henrietta   the painful effort of forcing  conversation, or the guilty consciousness of giving way to silence, and enabled  Henrietta   to preserve Henrietta   general tenor between taciturnity and loquaciousness. Mrs  Mrs Delvile Henrietta   did not once dare look at; but Henrietta   son, Henrietta   saw, seemed greatly  hurt; yet it was proudly, not sorrowfully, and therefore Henrietta   saw it with less  uneasiness. During the rest of the day, which was passed in general society, Mrs Delvile,  though much occupied, frequently leaving the room, and sending for Lady  Honoria, was more soft, kind and gentle with Cecilia than ever, looking at Henrietta    with the utmost tenderness, often taking Henrietta   hand, and speaking to Henrietta   with  even unusual sweetness. Cecilia with mingled sadness and pleasure observed this  encreasing regard, which Henrietta   could not but attribute to the discovery made  through Lady Honoria mischievous intelligence, and which, while this   rejoiced  Henrietta   with the belief of Henrietta   approbation, added fresh force to Henrietta   regret in  considering it was fruitless. Delvile, mean-time, evidently offended himself,  conversed only with the gentlemen, and went very early into himself . When they were all retiring, Mrs Delvile, following Cecilia, dismissed Cecilia maid  to talk with Cecilia alone. "I am not, I hope, often," Cecilia cried, "solicitous or importunate to speak about  my son: his character, I believe, wants no vindication; clear and unsullied, no vindication  has always been no vindication own support: yet the aspersion cast upon it   this morning by  Lady Honoria, I think Cecilia bound to explain, not partially as his mother, but  simply as his friend." Cecilia, who knew not whither such an explanation might lead, nor wherefore it  was made, heard this opening with much emotion, but gave neither to that nor to  what followed any interruption. Mrs Delvile then continued: Mrs Delvile had taken the trouble, Mrs Delvile said, to sift the  whole affair, in order to shame Lady Honoria by a pointed conviction of what  Mrs Delvile had invented, and to trace from the foundation the circumstances whence Mrs Delvile  surmises or report had sprung. Mrs Delvile, it seems, about a fortnight before the present time, in one of Mrs Delvile  morning walks, had observed a gipsey sitting by the side of the high road, who  seemed extremely ill, and who had a very beautiful child tied to Mrs Delvile back. Struck with a very beautiful child tied to her back, a very beautiful child tied to her back stopt to enquire to whom a very beautiful child tied to her back belonged; to Mrs Delvile, Mrs Delvile  said, and begged a very beautiful child tied to her back charity with the most pitiable cries of distress; telling  a very beautiful child tied to her back that Mrs Delvile was travelling to join some of Mrs Delvile fraternity, who were in a body  near Bath, but was so ill with an ague and fever that Mrs Delvile feared Mrs Delvile should die  on the road. Mrs Delvile desired Mrs Delvile to go to the next cottage, and promised to pay for Mrs Delvileboard there till Mrs Delvile was better. a very beautiful child tied to her back then spoke to the man and a very beautiful child tied to her back wife who  owned it to take them in, who, glad to oblige a very beautiful child tied to her back Honour, instantly consented,  and a very beautiful child tied to her back had since called twice to see in what manner them went on. "How simple," continued Mrs Delvile, "is a matter of fact in it, and how  complex when embellished! This tale has been told by the cottagers to our  servants; This tale has travelled, probably gaining something from every mouth, to  Lady Honoria's maid, and, having reached  Lady Honoria's maid ladyship, was swelled in a moment  into all we heard! I think, however, that, for some time at least,  Lady Honoria's maid levity  will be rather less daring. I have not, in the  whole affair, at all spared  Lady Honoria's maid; I  made  Lady Honoria's maid hear from Mortimer himself the little story as it happened; I then  carried  Lady Honoria's maid to the cottage, where we had the whole matter confirmed; and I  afterwards insisted upon being told myself by  Lady Honoria's maid maid all  Lady Honoria's maid had related to   Lady Honoria's maid lady, that  Lady Honoria's maid might thus be unanswerably convicted of inventing whatever   Lady Honoria's maid omitted. I have occasioned  Lady Honoria's maid some confusion, and, for the moment, a  little resentment; but  Lady Honoria's maid is so volatile that neither will last; and though,  with regard to my own family, I may perhaps have rendered  Lady Honoria's maid more cautious, I  fear, with regard to the world in general,  Lady Honoria's maid is utterly incorrigible, because  it has neither pleasure nor advantage to offer, that can compensate for the  deprivation of relating one staring story, or ridiculous anecdote." And then, wishing  Lady Honoria's maid good night,  Lady Honoria's maid added, "I make not any apology for this  detail, which you owe, not, believe me, to a mother's folly, but, if I [know]  myself at all, to a love of truth and justice. Mortimer, independent of all  connection with myself, cannot but to every body appear of a character which may be  deemed even exemplary; calumny, therefore, falling upon such a subject, injures  not only himself but society, since it weakens all confidence in virtue, and  strengthens the scepticism of depravity."  Lady Honoria's maid then left  Lady Honoria's maid. "Ah!" thought Cecilia, "to me, at least, this solicitude for his fame needs no  apology! humane and generous Delvile! never, again, will I a moment doubt your  worthiness!" And then, cherishing that darling idea,  Lady Honoria's maid forgot all  Lady Honoria's maid cares  and apprehensions,  Lady Honoria's maid quarrel,  Lady Honoria's maid suspicions, and the approaching separation,  and, recompensed for every thing by this refutation of his guilt,  Lady Honoria's maid hastened  to bed, and composed  Lady Honoria's maid to rest.
