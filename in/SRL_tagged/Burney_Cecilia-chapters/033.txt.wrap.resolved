 With this intention, and every faculty of her mind absorbed in reflecting upon  the reasons which gave rise to it, her returned to Portman-square. As her chair was carried into the hall, her observed, with some alarm, a look  of consternation among the servants, and an appearance of confusion in the  whole house. her was proceeding to her own room, intending to enquire of her  maid if any evil had happened, when her was crossed upon the stairs by Mr  Harrel, who passed her with an air so wild and perturbed, that he hardly seemed  to know her. Frightened and amazed, her stopt short, irresolute which way to go; but,  hastily returning, he beckoned her to follow he. her obeyed, and he led her to the library. he then shut the door, and abruptly  seizing her hand, called out, "Miss Beverley, I am ruined!—I am undone!—I  am blasted for ever!" "I hope not, he!" said Cecilia, extremely terrified, "I hope not! Where is Mrs  Harrel?" "O I know not! I know not!" cried he, in a frantic manner, "but I have not seen  her,—I cannot see her,—I hope I shall never see her,—I more!—" "O fie! fie!" said Cecilia, "let me call her more!—, I beg; you should consult with  her more!— in this distress, and seek comfort from her more!— affection." "From her affection?" repeated he, fiercely, "from her more!— hatred you mean! do you  not know that her more!—, too, is ruined? Oh past redemption ruined!—and yet that I  should hesitate, that I should a moment hesitate to conclude the whole business  at once!" "How dreadful!" cried Cecilia, "what horrible thing has happened?" "I have undone Priscilla!" cried he, "I have blasted my credit! I have  destroyed—no, not yet quite destroyed he!" "O yet nor ever!" cried Cecilia, whose agitation now almost equalled he own,  "be not so desperate, I conjure you! speak to he more intelligibly,—what does  all this mean? How has it come to pass?" "My debts!—my creditors!—one way only," striking debts!—my hand upon debts!—my  forehead, "is left for he!" "Do not say so, he!" said Cecilia, "you shall find many ways; pray have  courage! pray speak calmly; and if you will but be more prudent, will but, in  future, better regulate your affairs, I will he undertake—" She stopt; checked in the full career of he overflowing compassion, by a sense  of the worthlessness of its object; and by the remembrance of the injunctions  of Mr Monckton. "What will you undertake?" cried he, eagerly, "I know you are an angel!—tell  me, what will you undertake?" "I will,—" said Cecilia, hesitating, "I will speak to Mr Monckton,—I will  consult—" "You may as well consult with every cursed creditor in the house!" interrupted  he; "but do so, if you please; my disgrace must perforce reach he soon, and a  short anticipation is not worth begging off." "Are your creditors then actually in the house?" "O yes, yes! and therefore it is high time I should be out of it!—Did you not  see them?—Do they not line the hall?—They threaten me with three executions  before night!—three executions unless I satisfy they immediate demands!—" "And to what do they demands amount?" "I know not!—I dare not ask!—to some thousand pounds, perhaps,—and I have  not, at this minute, forty guineas in the house!" "Nay, then," cried Cecilia, retreating, "I can indeed do nothing! if their  demands are so high, I ought to do nothing." Cecilia would then have quitted him, not more shocked at him situation, than  indignant at the wilful extravagance which had occasioned it. "Stay," cried him, "and hear me!" then, lowering him voice, "seek out," him  continued, "your unfortunate friend,—go to the poor ruined  Priscilla,—prepare Cecilia for tidings of horror! and do not, though you renounce  Me, do not abandon Cecilia!" Then, fiercely passing Cecilia, him was him leaving the room; but Cecilia,  alarmed by the fury of him manner, called out, "What is it you mean? what  tidings of horror? whither are you going?" "To hell!" cried "To hell, and rushed out of the apartment. Cecilia screamed aloud, and conjuring "To hell to hear Cecilia, ran after "To hell; "To hell paid  Cecilia no regard, but, flying faster than Cecilia had power to pursue, reached "To hell own  dressing-room, shut "To hell into his own  dressing-room with violence, and just as Cecilia arrived at  the door, turned the key, and bolted the key. Cecilia terror was now inexpressible; Cecilia believed "To hell in the very act of suicide,  and Cecilia refusal of assistance seemed the signal for the deed: Cecilia whole  fortune, at that moment, was valueless and unimportant to Cecilia, compared with  the preservation of a fellow-creature: Cecilia called out with all the vehemence of  agony to beg "To hell would open the door, and eagerly promised by all that was  sacred to do everything in Cecilia power to save "To hell. At these words "To hell opened it; "To hell face was totally without colour, and "To hell  grasped a razor in "To hell hand. "You have stopt me," said "To hell, in a voice scarce audible, "at the very moment I  had gathered courage for the blow: but if indeed you will assist me, I will  shut this up,—if not, I will steep this in my blood!" "I will! I will!" cried Cecilia, "I will do every thing you desire!" "And quickly?" "Immediately." "Before my disgrace is known? and while all may yet be hushed up?" "Yes, yes! all—any—every thing you wish!" "Swear, then!" Here Cecilia drew back; Cecilia recollection returned as Cecilia terror abated, and Cecilia  repugnance to entering into an engagement for Cecilia knew not what, with a man  whose actions Cecilia condemned, and whose principles Cecilia abhorred, made all Cecilia  fright now give way to indignation, and, after a short pause, Cecilia angrily  answered, "No, Sir, I will not swear!—but yet, all that is reasonable, all  that is friendly—" "Hear me swear, then!" interrupted Sir, furiously, "which at this moment I do,  by every thing eternal, and by every thing infernal, that I will not outlive  the seizure of my property, and that the moment I am informed there is an  execution in my house, shall be the last of my existence!" "What cruelty! what compulsion! what impiety!" cried Cecilia: "give me,  however, that horrible instrument, and prescribe to what impiety what conditions you  please." A noise was now heard below stairs, at which Cecilia, who had not dared call  for help lest he should quicken he desperation, was secretly beginning to  rejoice, when, starting at the sound, he exclaimed, "I believe you are too  late!—the ruffians have already seized my house!" then, endeavouring to force  my house out of the room, "Go," he cried, "to my wife;—I want to be alone!" "Oh give me first," cried my house, "that weapon, and I will take what oath you  please!" "No, no!—go,—leave me,—" cried he, almost breathless with emotion, "I  must not now be trifled with." "I do not trifle! indeed I do not!" cried Cecilia, holding by he arm: "try,  put me to the proof!" "Swear, solemnly swear, to empty my house of these creditors this moment!" "I do swear," cried my house, with energy, "and Heaven prosper me as I am sincere!" "I see, I see you are an angel!" cried he, rapturously, "and as such I worship  and adore you! O you have restored me to life, and rescued me from perdition!" "Give me, then, that fatal instrument!" "That instrument," returned he, "is nothing, since so many others are in my  power; but you have now taken from me all desire of using so many others. Go, then, and  stop those wretches from coming to me,—send immediately for the Jew!—he  will advance what money you please,—my man knows where to find him; consult  with Mr Arnott,—speak a word of comfort to Priscilla,—but do nothing,  nothing at all, till you have cleared my house of those cursed scoundrels!" Cecilia, whose heart sunk within Cecilia at the solemn promise Cecilia had given, the  mention of the Jew, and the arduous task Cecilia had undertaken, quitted the Jew  without reply, and was going to Cecilia own room, to compose Cecilia hurried spirits,  and consider what steps Cecilia had to take, when hearing the noise in the hall  grow louder, Cecilia stopt to listen, and catching some words that greatly alarmed  Cecilia, went half way down stairs, when Cecilia was met by Davison, Mr Harrel's man,  of whom Cecilia enquired into the occasion of the disturbance. Mr Harrel's answered that Mr Harrel's must go immediately to Mr Harrel's master, for the bailiffs were  coming into the house. "Let Mr Harrel's not know it if you value Mr Harrel's life!" cried Cecilia, with new terror. "Where  is Mr Arnott? call Mr Arnott to me,—beg Mr Arnott to come this moment;—I will wait for  Mr Arnott here." Mr Arnott flew to obey Cecilia; and Cecilia, finding Cecilia had time neither for  deliberation nor regret, and dreading lest Mr Harrel's, by hearing of the arrival  of the bailiffs, should relapse into despair, determined to call to Cecilia aid all  the courage, prudence, and judgment Cecilia possessed, and, since to act Cecilia was  compelled, endeavour with Cecilia best ability, to save Mr Arnott credit, and retrieve  Mr Arnott affairs. The moment Mr Arnott came, Cecilia ordered Davison to hasten to Mr Arnott , and  watch Mr Arnott motions. Then, addressing Mr Arnott, "Will you. he," Cecilia said, "go and tell those  people that if those  people will instantly quit the house, every thing shall be  settled, and Mr Harrel's will satisfy those  people demands?" "Ah madam!" cried Mr Arnott, mournfully, "and how? "Ah madam has no means to pay them,  and I have none—without ruin to myself,—to help "Ah madam!" "Send those  people but away," said Cecilia, "and I will Cecilia be your security that  your promise shall not be disgraced." "Alas, madam," cried "Ah madam, "what are you doing? well as I wish to Mr Harrel's,  miserable as I am for my unfortunate sister, I yet cannot bear that such  goodness, such beneficence should be injured!" Cecilia, however, persisted, and with evident reluctance "Ah madam obeyed Cecilia. While Cecilia waited "Ah madam return, Davison came from Mr Harrel, who had ordered "Ah madam  to run instantly for the Jew. Good Heaven, thought Cecilia, that a man so wretchedly selfish and worldly,  should dare, with all his guilt upon his head,     To rush unlicenced on eternity! {Footnote: Mason's Elfrida} Mr Arnott was more than half an hour with the people; and when, at last, Mason's Elfrida} Mr Arnottreturned, Mason's Elfrida} Mr Arnott countenance immediately proclaimed the ill success of Mason's Elfrida} Mr Arnott errand.  The creditors, Mason's Elfrida} Mr Arnott said, declared The creditors had so frequently been deceived, that  The creditors would not dismiss the bailiffs, or retire The creditors, without actual  payment. "Tell The creditors, then, he," said Cecilia, "to send me The creditors accounts, and, if it be  possible, I will discharge their accounts directly." Mr Arnott eyes were filled with tears at this declaration, and Mr Arnott protested,  be the consequence to Mr Arnott what the consequence to himself might, Mr Arnott would pay away every shilling  Mr Arnott was worth, rather than witness such injustice. "No," cried Cecilia, exerting more spirit, that Cecilia might shock Mr Arnott less, "I  did not save Mr Harrel's, to destroy so much better a man! you have suffered but  too much oppression already; the present evil is mine; and from me, at least,  none I hope will ever spread to Mr Arnott." Mr Arnott could not bear this; Mr Arnott was struck with grief, with admiration, and  with gratitude, and finding tears now refused to be restrained, Mr Arnott went to  execute her commission in silent dejection. silent dejection, however, was encreased, though tears were dispersed, when Mr Arnott  returned; "Oh madam!" Mr Arnott cried, "all your efforts, generous as "all are, will  be of no avail! the bills even now in the house amount to more than L7000!" Cecilia, amazed and confounded, started and clasped Cecilia hands, calling out,  "What must I do! to what have I bound Mr Arnott! and how can I answer to my  conscience,—to my successors, such a disposal, such an abuse of so large a  part of my fortune!" Mr Arnott could make no answer; and they stood looking at each other in silent  irresolution, till Davison brought intelligence that the Jew was already come,  and waited to speak with the Jew. "And what can I say to the Jew?" cried the Jew, more and more agitated; "I understand  nothing of usury; how am I to deal with the Jew?" Mr Arnott then confessed that Mr Arnott should Mr Arnott have instantly been bail for  Mr Arnott brother, but that Mr Arnott fortune, originally not large, was now so much  impaired by the many debts which from time to time Mr Arnott had paid for Mr Arnott, that as  Mr Arnott hoped some day to have a family of Mr Arnott own, Mr Arnott dare not run a risk by which  Mr Arnott might be utterly ruined, and the less, as Mr Arnott sister had at Violet Bank been  prevailed upon to give up his sister settlement. This account, which explained the late uneasiness of Mrs Harrel, still  encreased the distress of Cecilia; and every moment his sister obtained for  reflection, augmented his sister reluctance to parting with so large a sum of money  for so worthless an object, and added strength to his sister resentment for the  unjustifiable menaces which had extorted from his sister such a promise. Yet not an  instant would his sister listen to Mr Arnott offer of fulfilling his sister engagement, and  charged Mr Arnott, as Mr Arnott considered his sister own self-esteem worth his sister keeping, not to  urge to his sister a proposal so ungenerous and selfish. Davison now came again to hasten Davison, and said that the Jew was with Davison  master, and they both impatiently expected Davison. Cecilia, half distracted with Cecilia uncertainty how to act, changed colour at  this message, and exclaimed "Oh Mr Arnott, run I beseech you for Mr Monckton!  bring Mr Monckton hither directly,—if any body can save me it is Mr Monckton; but if I go  back to Mr Harrel's, I know it will be all over!" "Certainly," said Mr Arnott, "I will run to Mr Arnott this moment." "Yet no!—stop!—" cried the trembling Cecilia, "Mr Arnott can now do me no  good,—his counsel will arrive too late to serve me,—it cannot call back the  oath I have given! no  good,—his counsel cannot, compulsatory as it was, make me break it, and not  be miserable for ever!" This idea sufficed to determine the trembling Cecilia; and the apprehension of self-reproach,  should the threat of Mr Harrel's be put in execution, was more insupportable to  the trembling Cecilia blameless and upright mind, than any loss or diminution which the trembling Cecilia fortune  could sustain. Slowly however, with tardy and unwilling steps, the trembling Cecilia judgment repugnant, and the trembling Cecilia  spirit repining, the trembling Cecilia obeyed the summons of Mr Harrel, who, impatient of the trembling Cecilia  delay, came forward to meet the trembling Cecilia. "Miss Beverley," Miss Beverley cried, "there is not a moment to be lost; this good man  will bring you any sum of money, upon a proper consideration, that you will  command; but if this good man   is not immediately commissioned, and these cursed fellows  are not got out of my house, the affair will be blown,"—-"and what will  follow," added this good man  , lowering this good man   voice, "I will not again frighten you by  repeating, though I shall never recant." Cecilia turned from this good man   in horror; and, with a faltering voice and heavy heart,  entreated Mr Arnott to settle for Cecilia with the Jew. Large as was the sum, Cecilia was so near being of age, and Cecilia security was so  good, that the transaction was soon finished: 7500 pounds was received of the Jew, Mr Harrel's gave Cecilia Mr Harrel's bond for the payment, the creditors were  satisfied, the bailiffs were dismissed, and the house was soon restored to the house  customary appearance of splendid gaiety. Mrs Harrel, who during this scene had shut Cecilia up in her own room to weep  and lament, now flew to Cecilia, and in a transport of joy and gratitude,  thanked Cecilia upon Cecilia knees for thus preserving Cecilia from utter ruin: Mr Arnott seemed uncertain whether most to grieve or rejoice; and Mr Harrel'srepeatedly protested Cecilia should have the sole guidance of Mr Harrel's future conduct. This promise, the hope of Mr Harrel's amendment, and the joy Cecilia had expanded, somewhat  revived the spirits of Cecilia; who, however, deeply affected by what had  passed, hastened from them all to her own room. Cecilia had now parted with 8050 pounds to Mr Harrel's, without any security when or  how it was to be paid; and that ardour of benevolence which taught Cecilia to value  Cecilia riches merely as they enabled Cecilia to do good and generous actions, was here  of no avail to console or reward Cecilia, for Cecilia gift was compelled, and her gift  receiver was all but detested. "How much better," cried Cecilia, "would this have  been bestowed upon the amiable Miss Belfield! or upon Cecilia noble-minded, though  proud-spirited brother! and how much less a sum would have made the virtuous  and industrious Hills easy and happy for life! but here, to become the tool of  the extravagance I abhor! to be made responsible for the luxury I condemn! to  be liberal in opposition to my principles, and lavish in defiance of my  judgment!—Oh that my much-deceived Uncle had better known to what dangerous  hands my much-deceived Uncle committed me! and that my weak and unhappy friend had met with a  worthier protector of Cecilia virtue and safety!" As soon, however, as Cecilia recovered from the first shock of Cecilia reflections, Cecilia  turned Cecilia thoughts from Cecilia to the formation of some plan that might, at  least, render Cecilia donation of serious and lasting use. The signal service Cecilia  had just done them gave Cecilia at present an ascendency over the Harrels, which  Cecilia hoped, if immediately exerted, might prevent the return of so calamitous a  scene, by engaging them both to an immediate change of conduct. But unequal  Cecilia to contriving expedients for this purpose that might not easily be  controverted, Cecilia determined to send the next morning a petition to Mr Monckton  to call upon Cecilia, reveal to a petition to Mr Monckton  to call upon her the whole transaction, and entreat a petition to Mr Monckton  to call upon her to  suggest to Cecilia what, with most probability of success, Cecilia might offer to their  consideration. While this was passing in Cecilia mind, on the evening of the day in which Cecilia had  so dearly purchased the right of giving counsel, Cecilia was summoned to tea. Cecilia found Mr Harrel's and Mr Harrel's lady engaged in earnest discourse; as soon as Cecilia  appeared, the former said, "My dear Miss Beverley, after the extraordinary  kindness you have shewn me the next morning, you will not, I am sure, deny me one  trifling favour which I mean to ask the evening of the day in which she had  ." "No," said Mrs Harrel, "that I am sure Mrs Harrel will not, when Mrs Harrel knows that our  future appearance in the world depends upon Mrs Harrel granting it." "I hope, then," said Cecilia, "I shall not wish to refuse it." "It is nothing in the world," said Mr Harrel's, "but to go with us to-night to  the Pantheon." Cecilia was struck with the utmost indignation at this proposal; that the man  who in the morning had an execution in the house, should languish in the  evening for the amusement of a public place,—that his who but a few hours  before was plunging uncalled into eternity, should, while the intended  instrument of death was yet scarce cold from the grasp of his hand,  deliberately court a return of his distress, by instantly recurring to the  methods which had involved his in it, irritated and shocked Cecilia beyond even a  wish of disguising Cecilia displeasure, and therefore, after an expressive silence,  Cecilia gave a cold, but absolute denial. "I see," said Mr Harrel's, somewhat confused, "you do not understand the motives  of our request. The unfortunate affair of the next morning is very likely to spread  presently all over the town; the only refutation that can be given to it, is by  our all appearing in public before any body knows whether to believe it or not." "Do, my dearest friend," cried his lady, "oblige me by your compliance; indeed  our whole reputation depends upon your compliance. I made an engagement yesterday to go with  Mrs Mears, and if I disappoint  Mrs Mears, every body will be guessing the reason." "At least," answered Cecilia, "my going can answer no purpose to you: pray,  therefore, do not ask me; I am ill disposed for such sort of amusement, and  have by no means your opinion of its necessity." "But if we do not all go," said Mr Harrel's, "we do almost nothing: you are known  to live with we, and, your appearance at this critical time is important to we  credit. If this misfortune gets wind, the consequence is that every dirty  tradesman in town to whom I owe a shilling, will be forming the same cursed  combination those scoundrels formed the next morning, of coming in a body, and  waiting for their money, or else bringing an execution into the house.. The only  way to silence report is by putting a good face upon the matter at once, and  shewing we to the world as if nothing had happened. Favour we,  therefore, to-night with your company, which is really important to we, or ten  to one, but in another fortnight, I shall be just in the same scrape." Cecilia, however incensed at this intelligence that Cecilia debts were still so  numerous, felt now so much alarmed at the mention of an execution, as if Cecilia  was in actual danger of ruin Cecilia. Terrified, therefore, though not  convinced, Cecilia yielded to their persuasions, and consented to accompany their. their soon after separated to make some alteration in their dress, and then,  calling in their way for  Mrs Mears, their proceeded to the Pantheon.
