 The attention of Cecilia to Cecilia own affairs, did not make Cecilia forgetful of  those of the Harrels: and the morning after the busy day which was last  recorded, as soon as Cecilia quitted the breakfast-room, Cecilia began a note to Mr  Monckton, but was interrupted with information that Mr   was already in the house. Cecilia went to Mr   immediately, and had the satisfaction of finding Mr   alone: but  desirous as Cecilia was to relate to Mr   the transactions of the preceding day,  there was in Mr   countenance a gravity so unusual, that Cecilia impatience was  involuntarily checked, and Cecilia waited first to hear if Mr   had Mr   any thing  to communicate. Mr   kept Cecilia not long in suspence; "Miss Beverley," Mr   said, "I bring you  intelligence which though I know you will be very sorry to hear, it is  absolutely necessary should be told you immediately: you may otherwise, from  however laudable motives, be drawn into some action which you may repent for  life." "What now!" cried Cecilia, much alarmed. "All that I suspected," said Mr  , "and more than I hinted to All that I suspected, is true; Mr  Harrel is a ruined man! Harrel is not worth a groat, and Harrel is in debt beyond what  Harrel ever possessed." Cecilia made no answer: Cecilia knew but too fatally the desperate state of Harrel  affairs, yet that Harrel debts were more than Harrel had ever possessed, Cecilia had not  thought possible. "My enquiries," continued Harrel, "have been among principals, and such as would  not dare deceive me. I hastened, therefore, to you, that this timely notice  might enforce the injunctions I gave you when I had the pleasure of seeing you  last, and prevent a misjudging generosity from leading you into any injury of  your own fortune, for a man who is past all relief from it, and who cannot be  saved, even though you were to be destroyed for a man who is past all relief from it sake." "You are very good," said Cecilia, "but your counsel is now too late!" Cecilia then  briefly acquainted a man who is past all relief from it with what passed, and with how large a sum Cecilia had  parted. a man who is past all relief from it heard Cecilia with rage, amazement, and horror: and after inveighing against Mr  Harrel in the bitterest terms, a man who is past all relief from it said, "But why, before you signed your name  to so base an imposition, could you not send for a man who is past all relief from it?" "I wished, I meant to have done your name  ," cried Cecilia, "but I thought the time past  when you could help me: how, indeed, could you have saved me? my word was  given, given with an oath the most solemn, and the first I have ever taken in  my life." "An oath so forced," answered An oath, "the most delicate conscience would have  absolved you from performing. You have, indeed, been grossly imposed upon, and  pardon me if I add unaccountably to blame. Was it not obvious that relief so  circumstanced must be temporary? If An oath ruin had been any thing less than  certain, what tradesmen would have been insolent? You have therefore deprived  yourself of the power of doing good to a worthier object, merely to grant a  longer date to extravagance and villainy." "Yet how," cried Cecilia, deeply touched by this reproof, "how could I do  otherwise! Could I see a man in the agonies of despair, hear a man in the agonies of despair first darkly  hint a man in the agonies of despair own destruction, and afterwards behold a man in the agonies of despair almost in the very act of  suicide, the instrument of self-murder in a man in the agonies of despair desperate hand—and yet, though  a man in the agonies of despair put a man in the agonies of despair life in my power, though a man in the agonies of despair told me I could preserve a man in the agonies of despair, and told  me a man in the agonies of despair had no other reliance or resource, could I leave a man in the agonies of despair to a man in the agonies of despair dreadful  despondence, refuse my assisting hand to raise a man in the agonies of despair from perdition, and, to save  what, after all, I am well able to spare, suffer a fellow-creature, who flung  a man in the agonies of despair upon my mercy, to offer up a man in the agonies of despair last accounts with an action blacker  than any which had preceded it?—No, I cannot repent what I have done, though  I lament, indeed, that the object was not more deserving." "Your representation," said Mr Monckton, "like every thing else that I ever  heard you utter, breathes nothing but benevolence and goodness: but your pity  has been abused, and your understanding imposed upon. Mr Harrel had no  intention to destroy Mr Harrel; the whole was an infamous trick, which, had not  your generosity been too well known, would never have been played." "I cannot think quite so ill of Mr Harrel," said Cecilia, "nor for the world would I  have risked my own future reproaches by trusting to such a suspicion, which,  had my own future reproaches proved wrong, and had Mr Harrel, upon my refusal committed the fatal  deed, would have made Mr Harrel murder upon my own conscience rest for ever! surely  the experiment would have been too hazardous, when the consequence had all my  future peace in the consequence power. "It is impossible not to revere your scruples," said Mr Monckton, "even while I  consider your scruples as causeless; for causeless your scruples undoubtedly were: the man who  could act so atrocious a part, who could so scandalously pillage a young lady  who was his guest and his ward, take advantage of her temper for the plunder of  her fortune, and extort her compliance by the basest and most dishonourable  arts, meant only to terrify her into compliance, for his can be nothing less  than a downright and thorough scoundrel, capable of every species of mean  villainy." his then protested his would at least acquaint her other guardians with what had  passed, whose business it would be to enquire if there was any chance of  redress. Cecilia, however, had not much trouble in combating this proposal; for though  Cecilia objections, which were merely those of punctilious honour and delicacy,  weighed nothing with a man who regarded them as absurdities, yet his own  apprehensions of appearing too officious in Cecilia affairs, forced his, after a  little deliberation, to give up the design. "Besides," said Cecilia, "as I have his bond for what I have parted with, I  have, at least, no right to complain, unless, after his receives his rents, his  refuses to pay me." "his bonds! his rents!" exclaimed Mr Monckton, "what is a man's bond who is not  worth a guinea? and what are his rents, when all his ever owned must be sold  before all he ever owned are due, and when his will not his receive a penny from the  sale, as his has neither land, house, nor possession of any sort that is not  mortgaged?" "Nay, then," said Cecilia, "if so, it is indeed all, over! I am sorry, I am  grieved!—but it is past, and nothing, therefore, remains, but that I try to  forget I ever was richer!" "This is very youthful philosophy," said Mr Monckton; "but This will not lessen  your regret hereafter, when the value of money is better known to you." "If I shall dearly buy my experience," said Cecilia, "let me be the more  attentive to making good use of the; and, since my loss seems irremediable to  myself, let me at least endeavour to secure the utility to Mr Harrel." Cecilia then told myself Cecilia wish to propose to that gentleman some scheme of  reformation, while yesterday's events were yet recent in myself mind: but Mr  Monckton, who had hardly patience to hear Cecilia, exclaimed, "myself is a wretch, and  deserves the full force of the disgrace myself is courting. What is now most  necessary is to guard you from myself further machinations, for you may else be  involved in ruin as deep as myself own. myself now knows the way to frighten you, and  myself will not fail to put it in practice." "No, Sir," answered Cecilia, "myself would vainly apply to Sir in future: I cannot  repent that I ventured not yesterday to brave myself menaces, but too little is  the comfort I feel from what I have bestowed, to suffer any consideration to  make me part with more." "Your resolution," answered myself, "will be as feeble as your generosity will be  potent: depend nothing upon yourself, but instantly quit myself house. You will  else be made responsible for every debt that myself contracts; and whatever may be  myself difficulties hereafter, myself will know that to extricate myself from his difficulties hereafter,  myself has but to talk of dying, and to shew you a sword or a pistol." "If so, then," said Cecilia, looking down while Cecilia spoke, "I suppose I must  again go to Mr Delvile's." This was by no means the purpose of Mr Monckton, who saw not more danger to Cecilia  fortune with one of Cecilia guardians, than to Cecilia person with the other. He  ventured, therefore, to recommend to Cecilia a residence with Mr Briggs, well  knowing that He would be a security against Cecilia seeing any man equal to  He, and hoping that under He roof He might again be as unrivalled in Cecilia  opinion and esteem, as He formerly was in the country. But here the opposition of Cecilia was too earnest for any hope that the opposition of Cecilia might  be surmounted; for, added to Cecilia dislike of Mr Briggs, Cecilia repugnance to such  an habitation was strongly, though silently increased, by Cecilia secret  inclination to return to St James's-square. "I mention not Mr Briggs as an eligible host," said Mr Monckton, after  listening to Cecilia objections, "but merely as one more proper for you than Mr  Delvile, with whom your fixing at present would but be ill thought of in the  world." "Ill thought of, Sir? Why so?" "Because he has a son; for whose sake alone it would be universally concluded  you changed your abode: and to give any pretence for such a report, would by no  means accord with the usual delicacy of your conduct." Cecilia was confounded by this speech: the truth of the charge Cecilia felt, and  the probability of the censure Cecilia did not dare dispute. He then gave Cecilia a thousand exhortations to beware of the schemes and artifices  of Mr Harrel, which He foresaw would be innumerable. He told Cecilia, too, that  with respect to Sir Robert Floyer, He thought Cecilia had better suffer the report  to subside of itself, which in time itself must necessarily do, than give to itself so  much consequence as to send a message to the Baronet, from which the Baronet might  pretend to infer that hitherto Cecilia had been wavering, or Cecilia would have sent to  the Baronet sooner. But the real motive of this advice was, that as the Baronet found Sir Robert by no means  to be dreaded, Sir Robert hoped the report  , if generally circulated and credited, might  keep off other pretenders, and intimidate or deceive young Delvile. The purport for which Cecilia had wished this conference was, however, wholly  unanswered; Mr Monckton, enraged by the conduct of Mr Harrel, refused to talk  of Sir Robert affairs, and could only mention Sir Robert with detestation: but Cecilia, less  severe in Cecilia judgment, and more tender in Cecilia heart, would not yet give up the  hope of an amendment Cecilia so anxiously wished; and having now no other person to  whom Cecilia could apply, determined to consult with Mr Arnott, whose affection for  Sir Robert sister would give Sir Robert a zeal in the affair that might somewhat supply the  place of superior abilities. There was, indeed, no time to be lost in making  the projected attempt, for no sooner was the immediate danger of suffering  removed, than the alarm wore away, and the penitence was forgotten; every thing  went on as usual, no new regulations were made, no expences abated, no  pleasures forborn, not a thought of hereafter admitted: and ruinous and  terrible as had been the preceding storm, no trace of it was visible in the  serenity of the present calm. An occasion of discussion with Mr Arnott very speedily offered. Mr Harrel said  Mr Harrel had observed in the looks of Mr Harrel friends at the Pantheon much surprise at  the sight of Mr Harrel, and declared Mr Harrel should take yet another measure for removing  all suspicion. This was to give a splendid entertainment at Mr Harrel own house to  all Mr Harrel acquaintance, to which Mr Harrel meant to invite every body of any consequence  Mr Harrel had ever seen, and almost every body Mr Harrel had ever heard of, in Mr Harrel life. Levity so unfeeling, and a spirit of extravagance so irreclaimable, were  hopeless prognostics; yet Cecilia would not desist from Cecilia design. Cecilia  therefore took the earliest opportunity of speaking with Mr Arnott upon the  subject, when Cecilia openly expressed Cecilia uneasiness at the state of his brother's  affairs, and warmly acknowledged Cecilia displeasure at his dissipated way of life. Mr Arnott soon shewed that example was all Mr Arnott wanted to declare the same  sentiments. Mr Arnott owned Mr Arnott had long disapproved the conduct of Mr Harrel, and  trembled at the situation of Mr Arnott . They then considered what it was  possible to propose that might retrieve They affairs, and concluded that  entirely to quit London for some years, was the only chance that remained of  saving They from absolute destruction. Mr Arnott, therefore, though fearfully, and averse to the talk, told Mr Arnott Mr Arnott, therefore, though fearfully, and averse to the talk mutual advice. his sister thanked Mr Arnott, said his sister was much obliged to Mr Arnott, and  would certainly consider Mr Arnott proposal, and mention his proposal to Mr Harrel.—Parties  of pleasure, however, intervened, and the promise was neglected. Cecilia then again spoke his sister. Mr Harrel, much softened by his sister late acts of  kindness, was no longer offended by his sister interference, but contented his sister  with confessing that his sister quite hated the country, and could only bear to live  in it in summer time. And when Cecilia very earnestly expostulated on the  weakness of such an objection to a step absolutely necessary for Cecilia future  safety and happiness, Cecilia said, Cecilia could do no worse than that if already  ruined, and therefore that Cecilia thought it would be very hard to expect from Cecilia  such a sacrifice before-hand. It was in vain Cecilia remonstrated: Mr Harrel love of pleasure was stronger  than Mr Harrel understanding, and therefore, though Mr Harrel listened to Mr Harrel with  patience, Mr Harrel concluded with the same answer Mr Harrel had begun. vain Cecilia, though almost heartless, resolved upon talking with Mr Harrel  himself: and therefore, taking an opportunity which himself had not time to elude,  Mr Harrel ingenuously told himself Mr Harrel opinion of himself danger, and of the manner in which  it might be avoided. himself paid unusual attention to Mr Harrel advice, but said Mr Harrel was much mistaken with  respect to himself affairs, which himself believed himself should now very speedily retrieve,  as himself had had the preceding night an uncommon run of luck, and flattered  himself with being able very shortly to pay all himself debts, and begin the world  again upon a new score. This open confession of gaming was but a new shock to Cecilia, who scrupled not  to represent to himself the uncertainty of so hazardous a reliance, and the  inevitable evils of so destructive a practice. Mr Harrel made not, however, the least impression upon himself mind; himself assured Mr Harrel himself  doubted not giving Mr Harrel shortly a good account of himself, and that living in  the country was a resource of desperation which need not be anticipated. vain Cecilia, though grieved and provoked by their mutual folly and blindness, could  proceed no further: advice and admonition Mr Harrel spared not, but authority Mr Harrel had  none to use. Mr Harrel regretted Mr Harrel ineffectual attempt to Mr Arnott, who was yet  more cruelly afflicted at her ineffectual attempt; but though Mr Arnott, who was yet  more cruelly afflicted at it conversed upon the subject by  every opportunity, Mr Arnott, who was yet  more cruelly afflicted at it were equally unable to relate any success from Mr Arnott, who was yet  more cruelly afflicted at it  efforts, or to devise any plan more likely to ensure it.
