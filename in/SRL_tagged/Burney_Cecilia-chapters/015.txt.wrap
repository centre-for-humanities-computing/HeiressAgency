 The next morning, during breakfast, Cecilia was informed that a gentleman  desired to speak with her. She begged permission of Mrs Harrel to have him  asked upstairs, and was not a little surprized when he proved to be the same  old gentleman whose singular exclamations had so much struck her at Mr  Monckton's, and at the rehearsal of Artaserse. Abruptly and with a stern aspect advancing to her, "You are rich," he cried;  "are you therefore worthless?" "I hope not," answered she, in some consternation; while Mrs Harrel, believing  his intention was to rob them, ran precipitately to the bell, which she rang  without ceasing till two or three servants hastened into the room; by which  time, being less alarmed, she only made signs to them to stay, and stood  quietly herself to wait what would follow. The old man, without attending to her, continued his dialogue with Cecilia. "Know you then," he said, "a blameless use of riches? such a use as not only in  the broad glare of day shall shine resplendent, but in the darkness of  midnight, and stillness of repose, shall give you reflections unembittered, and  slumbers unbroken? tell me, know you this use?" "Not so well, perhaps," answered she, "as I ought; but I am very willing to  learn better." "Begin, then, while yet youth and inexperience, new to the callousness of power  and affluence, leave something good to work upon: yesterday you saw the  extravagance of luxury and folly; to-day look deeper, and see, and learn to  pity, the misery of disease and penury." He then put into her hand a paper which contained a most affecting account of  the misery to which a poor and wretched family had been reduced, by sickness  and various other misfortunes. Cecilia, "open as day to melting charity," having hastily perused it, took out  her purse, and offering to him three guineas, said, "You must direct me, sir,  what to give if this is insufficient." "Hast thou so much heart?" cried he, with emotion, "and has fortune, though it  has cursed thee with the temptation of prosperity, not yet rooted from thy mind  its native benevolence? I return in part thy liberal contribution; this,"  taking one guinea, "doubles my expectations; I will not, by making thy charity  distress thee, accelerate the fatal hour of hardness and degeneracy." He was then going; but Cecilia, following him, said "No, take it all! Who  should assist the poor if I will not? Rich, without connections; powerful,  without wants; upon whom have they any claim if not upon me?" "True," cried he, receiving the rest, "and wise as true. Give, therefore,  whilst yet thou hast the heart to give, and make, in thy days of innocence and  kindness, some interest with Heaven and the poor!" And then he disappeared. "Why, my dear," cried Mrs Harrel, "what could induce you to give the man so  much money? Don't you see he is crazy? I dare say he would have been just as  well contented with sixpence." "I know not what he is," said Cecilia, "but his manners are not more singular  than his sentiments are affecting; and if he is actuated by charity to raise  subscriptions for the indigent, he can surely apply to no one who ought so  readily to contribute as myself." Mr Harrel then came in, and his lady most eagerly told him the transaction. "Scandalous!" he exclaimed; "why, this is no better than being a housebreaker!  Pray give orders never to admit him again. Three guineas! I never heard so  impudent a thing in my life! Indeed, Miss Beverley, you must be more discreet  in future, you will else be ruined before you know where you are." "Thus it is," said Cecilia, half smiling, "that we can all lecture one another!  to-day you recommend economy to me; yesterday I with difficulty forbore  recommending it to you." "Nay," answered he, "that was quite another matter; expence incurred in the  common way of a man's living is quite another thing to an extortion of this  sort." "It is another thing indeed," said she, "but I know not that it is therefore a  better." Mr Harrel made no answer: and Cecilia, privately moralizing upon the different  estimates of expence and economy made by the dissipated and the charitable,  soon retired to her own apartment, determined firmly to adhere to her lately  adopted plan, and hoping, by the assistance of her new and very singular  monitor, to extend her practice of doing good, by enlarging her knowledge of  distress. Objects are, however, never wanting for the exercise of benevolence; report  soon published her liberality, and those who wished to believe it, failed not  to enquire into its truth. She was soon at the head of a little band of  pensioners, and, never satisfied with the generosity of her donations, found in  a very short time that the common allowance of her guardians was scarce  adequate to the calls of her munificence. And thus, in acts of goodness and charity, passed undisturbed another week of  the life of Cecilia: but when the fervour of self-approbation lost its novelty,  the pleasure with which her new plan was begun first subsided into  tranquillity, and then sunk into languor. To a heart formed for friendship and  affection the charms of solitude are very short-lived; and though she had  sickened of the turbulence of perpetual company, she now wearied of passing all  her time by herself, and sighed for the comfort of society and the relief of  communication. But she saw with astonishment the difficulty with which this was  to be obtained: the endless succession of diversions, the continual rotation of  assemblies, the numerousness of splendid engagements, of which, while every one  complained, every one was proud to boast, so effectually impeded private  meetings and friendly intercourse, that, whichever way she turned herself, all  commerce seemed impracticable, but such as either led to dissipation, or  accidentally flowed from it. Yet, finding the error into which her ardour of reformation had hurried her,  and that a rigid seclusion from company was productive of a lassitude as little  favourable to active virtue as dissipation itself, she resolved to soften her  plan, and by mingling amusement with benevolence, to try, at least, to approach  that golden mean, which, like the philosopher's stone, always eludes our grasp,  yet always invites our wishes. For this purpose she desired to attend Mrs Harrel to the next Opera that should  be represented. The following Saturday, therefore, she accompanied that lady and Mrs Mears to  the Haymarket, escorted by Mr Arnott. They were very late; the Opera was begun, and even in the lobby the crowd was  so great that their passage was obstructed. Here they were presently accosted  by Miss Larolles, who, running up to Cecilia and taking her hand, said, "Lord,  you can't conceive how glad I am to see you! why, my dear creature, where have  you hid yourself these twenty ages? You are quite in luck in coming to-night, I  assure you; it's the best Opera we have had this season: there's such a  monstrous crowd there's no stirring. We shan't get in this half hour. The  coffee-room is quite full; only come and see; is it not delightful?" This intimation was sufficient for Mrs Harrel, whose love of the Opera was  merely a love of company, fashion, and shew; and therefore to the coffee-room  she readily led the way. And here Cecilia found rather the appearance of a brilliant assembly of ladies  and gentlemen, collected merely to see and to entertain one another, than of  distinct and casual parties, mixing solely from necessity, and waiting only for  room to enter a theatre. The first person that addressed them was Captain Aresby, who, with his usual  delicate languishment, smiled upon Cecilia, and softly whispering, "How  divinely you look to-night!" proceeded to pay his compliments to some other  ladies. "Do, pray, now," cried Miss Larolles, "observe Mr Meadows! only just see where  he has fixed himself! in the very best place in the room, and keeping the fire  from every body! I do assure you that's always his way, and it's monstrous  provoking, for if one's ever so cold, he lollops so, that one's quite starved.  But you must know there's another thing he does that is quite as bad, for if he  gets a seat, he never offers to move, if he sees one sinking with fatigue. And  besides, if one is waiting for one's carriage two hours together, he makes it a  rule never to stir a step to see for it. Only think how monstrous!" "These are heavy complaints, indeed," said Cecilia, looking at him attentively;  "I should have expected from his appearance a very different account of his  gallantry, for he seems dressed with more studied elegance than anybody here." "O yes," cried Miss Larolles, "he is the sweetest dresser in the world; he has  the most delightful taste you can conceive, nobody has half so good a fancy. I  assure you it's a great thing to be spoke to by him: we are all of us quite  angry when he won't take any notice of us." "Is your anger," said Cecilia, laughing, "in honour of himself or of his coat?" "Why, Lord, don't you know all this time that he is an ennuye? "I know, at least," answered Cecilia, "that he would soon make one of me." "O, but one is never affronted with an ennuye, if he is ever so provoking,  because one always knows what it means." "Is he agreeable?" "Why, to tell you the truth,—but pray now, don't mention it,—I think him  most excessive disagreeable! He yawns in one's face every time one looks at  him. I assure you sometimes I expect to see him fall fast asleep while I am  talking to him, for he is so immensely absent he don't hear one half that one  says; only conceive how horrid!" "But why, then, do you encourage him? why do you take any notice of him?" "O, every body does, I assure you, else I would not for the world; but he is so  courted you have no idea. However, of all things let me advise you never to  dance with him; I did once myself, and I declare I was quite distressed to  death the whole time, for he was taken with such a fit of absence he knew  nothing he was about, sometimes skipping and jumping with all the violence in  the world, just as if he only danced for exercise, and sometimes standing quite  still, or lolling against the wainscoat and gaping, and taking no more notice  of me than if he had never seen me in his life!" The Captain now, again advancing to Cecilia, said, "So you would not do us the  honour to try the masquerade at the Pantheon? however, I hear you had a very  brilliant spectacle at Mr Harrel's. I was quite au desespoir that I could not  get there. I did mon possible, but it was quite beyond me." "We should have been very happy," said Mrs Harrel, "to have seen you; I assure  you we had some excellent masks." "So I have heard partout, and I am reduced to despair that I could not have the  honour of sliding in. But I was accable with affairs all day. Nothing could be  so mortifying." Cecilia now, growing very impatient to hear the Opera, begged to know if they  might not make a trial to get into the pit? "I fear," said the Captain, smiling as they passed him, without offering any  assistance, "you will find it extreme petrifying; for my part, I confess I am  not upon the principle of crowding." The ladies, however, accompanied by Mr Arnott, made the attempt, and soon  found, according to the custom of report, that the difficulty, for the pleasure  of talking of it, had been considerably exaggerated. They were separated,  indeed, but their accommodation was tolerably good. Cecilia was much vexed to find the first act of the Opera almost over; but she  was soon still more dissatisfied when she discovered that she had no chance of  hearing the little which remained: the place she had happened to find vacant  was next to a party of young ladies, who were so earnestly engaged in their own  discourse, that they listened not to a note of the Opera, and so infinitely  diverted with their own witticisms, that their tittering and loquacity allowed  no one in their vicinity to hear better than themselves. Cecilia tried in vain  to confine her attention to the singers; she was distant from the stage, and to  them she was near, and her fruitless attempts all ended in chagrin and  impatience. At length she resolved to make an effort for entertainment in another way, and  since the expectations which brought her to the Opera were destroyed, to try by  listening to her fair neighbours, whether those who occasioned her  disappointment could make her any amends. For this purpose she turned to them wholly; yet was at first in no little  perplexity to understand what was going forward, since so universal was the  eagerness for talking, and so insurmountable the antipathy to listening, that  every one seemed to have her wishes bounded by a continual utterance of words,  without waiting for any answer, or scarce even desiring to be heard. But when, somewhat more used to their dialect and manner, she began better to  comprehend their discourse, wretchedly indeed did it supply to her the loss of  the Opera. She heard nothing but descriptions of trimmings, and complaints of  hair-dressers, hints of conquest that teemed with vanity, and histories of  engagements which were inflated with exultation. At the end of the act, by the crowding forward of the gentlemen to see the  dance, Mrs Harrel had an opportunity of making room for her by herself, and she  had then some reason to expect hearing the rest of the Opera in peace, for the  company before her, consisting entirely of young men, seemed, even during the  dance, fearful of speaking, lest their attention should be drawn for a moment  from the stage. But to her infinite surprize, no sooner was the second act begun, than their  attention ended! they turned from the performers to each other, and entered  into a whispering but gay conversation, which, though not loud enough to  disturb the audience in general, kept in the ears of their neighbours a buzzing  which interrupted all pleasure from the representation. Of this effect of their  gaiety it seemed uncertain whether they were conscious, but very evident that  they were totally careless. The desperate resource which she had tried during the first act, of seeking  entertainment from the very conversation which prevented her enjoying it, was  not now even in her power: for these gentlemen, though as negligent as the  young ladies had been whom they disturbed, were much more cautious whom they  instructed: their language was ambiguous, and their terms, to Cecilia, were  unintelligible: their subjects, indeed, required some discretion, being nothing  less than a ludicrous calculation of the age and duration of jointured widows,  and of the chances and expectations of unmarried young ladies. But what more even than their talking provoked her, was finding that the moment  the act was over, when she cared not if their vociferation had been incessant,  one of them called out, "Come, be quiet, the dance is begun;" and then they  were again all silent attention! In the third act, however, she was more fortunate; the gentlemen again changed  their places, and they were succeeded by others who came to the Opera not to  hear themselves but the performers: and as soon as she was permitted to listen,  the voice of Pacchierotti took from her all desire to hear any thing but itself. During the last dance she was discovered by Sir Robert Floyer, who, sauntering  down fop's alley, stationed himself by her side, and whenever the figurante  relieved the principal dancers, turned his eyes from the stage to her face, as  better worth his notice, and equally destined for his amusement. Mr Monckton, too, who for some time had seen and watched her, now approached;  he had observed with much satisfaction that her whole mind had been intent upon  the performance, yet still the familiarity of Sir Robert Floyer's admiration  disturbed and perplexed him; he determined, therefore, to make an effort to  satisfy his doubts by examining into his intentions: and, taking him apart,  before the dance was quite over, "Well," he said, "who is so handsome here as  Harrel's ward?" "Yes," answered he, calmly, "she is handsome, but I don't like her expression." "No? why, what is the fault of it?" "Proud, cursed proud. It is not the sort of woman I like. If one says a civil  thing to her, she only wishes one at the devil for one's pains." "O, you have tried her, then, have you? why, you are not, in general, much  given to say civil things." "Yes, you know, I said something of that sort to her once about Juliet, at the  rehearsal. Was not you by?" "What, then, was that all? and did you imagine one compliment would do your  business with her?" "O, hang it, who ever dreams of complimenting the women now? that's all at an  end." "You won't find she thinks so, though; for, as you well say, her pride is  insufferable, and I, who have long known her, can assure you it does not  diminish upon intimacy." "Perhaps not,—but there's very pretty picking in 3000 pounds per annum! one  would not think much of a little encumbrance upon such an estate." "Are you quite sure the estate is so considerable? Report is mightily given to  magnify." "O, I have pretty good intelligence: though, after all, I don't know but I may  be off; she'll take a confounded deal of time and trouble." Monckton, too much a man of interest and of the world to cherish that delicacy  which covets universal admiration for the object of its fondness, then artfully  enlarged upon the obstacles he already apprehended, and insinuated such others  as he believed would be most likely to intimidate him. But his subtlety was  lost upon the impenetrable Baronet, who possessed that hard insensibility which  obstinately pursues its own course, deaf to what is said, and indifferent to  what is thought. Meanwhile the ladies were now making way to the coffee-room, though very slowly  on account of the crowd; and just as they got near the lobby, Cecilia perceived  Mr Belfield, who, immediately making himself known to her, was offering his  service to hand her out of the pit, when Sir Robert Floyer, not seeing or not  heeding him, pressed forward, and said, "Will you let me have the honour, Miss  Beverley, of taking care of you?" Cecilia, to whom he grew daily more disagreeable, coldly declined his  assistance, while she readily accepted that which had first been offered her by  Mr Belfield. The haughty Baronet, extremely nettled, forced his way on, and rudely stalking  up to Mr Belfield, motioned with his hand for room to pass him, and said, "Make  way, sir!" "Make way for me, Sir!" cried Belfield, opposing him with one hand, while with  the other he held Cecilia. "You, Sir? and who are you, Sir?" demanded the Baronet, disdainfully. "Of that, Sir, I shall give you an account whenever you please," answered  Belfield, with equal scorn. "What the devil do you mean, Sir?" "Nothing very difficult to be understood," replied Belfield, and attempted to  draw on Cecilia, who, much alarmed, was shrinking back. Sir Robert then, swelling with rage, reproachfully turned to her, and said,  "Will you suffer such an impertinent fellow as that, Miss Beverley, to have the  honour of taking your hand?" Belfield, with great indignation, demanded what he meant by the term  impertinent fellow; and Sir Robert yet more insolently repeated it: Cecilia,  extremely shocked, earnestly besought them both to be quiet; but Belfield, at  the repetition of this insult, hastily let go her hand and put his own upon his  sword, whilst Sir Robert, taking advantage of his situation in being a step  higher than his antagonist, fiercely pushed him back, and descended into the  lobby. Belfield, enraged beyond endurance, instantly drew his sword, and Sir Robert  was preparing to follow his example, when Cecilia, in an agony of fright,  called out, "Good Heaven! will nobody interfere?" And then a young man, forcing  his way through the crowd, exclaimed, "For shame, for shame, gentlemen! is this  a place for such violence?" Belfield, endeavouring to recover himself, put up his sword, and, though in a  voice half choaked with passion, said, "I thank you, Sir! I was off my guard. I  beg pardon of the whole company." Then, walking up to Sir Robert, he put into his hand a card with his name and  direction, saying, "With you, Sir, I shall be happy to settle what apologies  are necessary at your first leisure;" and hurried away. Sir Robert, exclaiming aloud that he should soon teach him to whom he had been  so impertinent, was immediately going to follow him, when the affrighted  Cecilia again called out aloud, "Oh, stop him!—good God! will nobody stop  him!" The rapidity with which this angry scene had passed had filled her with  amazement, and the evident resentment of the Baronet upon her refusing his  assistance, gave her an immediate consciousness that she was herself the real  cause of the quarrel; while the manner in which he was preparing to follow Mr  Belfield convinced her of the desperate scene which was likely to succeed;  fear, therefore, overcoming every other feeling, forced from her this  exclamation before she knew what she said. The moment she had spoken, the young man who had already interposed again  rushed forward, and seizing Sir Robert by the arm, warmly remonstrated against  the violence of his proceedings, and being presently seconded by other  gentlemen, almost compelled him to give up his design. Then, hastening to Cecilia, "Be not alarmed, madam," he cried, "all is over,  and every body is safe." Cecilia, finding herself thus addressed by a gentleman she had never before  seen, felt extremely ashamed of having rendered her interest in the debate so  apparent; she courtsied to him in some confusion, and taking hold of Mrs  Harrel's arm, hurried her back into the pit, in order to quit a crowd, of which  she now found herself the principal object. Curiosity, however, was universally excited, and her retreat served but to  inflame it: some of the ladies, and most of the gentlemen, upon various  pretences, returned into the pit merely to look at her, and in a few minutes  the report was current that the young lady who had been the occasion of the  quarrel, was dying with love for Sir Robert Floyer. Mr Monckton, who had kept by her side during the whole affair, felt  thunderstruck by the emotion she had shewn; Mr Arnott too, who had never  quitted her, wished himself exposed to the same danger as Sir Robert, so that  he might be honoured with the same concern: but they were both too much the  dupes of their own apprehensions and jealousy, to perceive that what they  instantly imputed to fondness, proceeded simply from general humanity,  accidentally united with the consciousness of being accessary to the quarrel. The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants, in a  few moments followed her with a glass of water, which he had brought from the  coffee-room, begging her to drink it and compose herself. Cecilia, though she declined his civility with more vexation than gratitude,  perceived, as she raised her eyes to thank him, that her new friend was a young  man very strikingly elegant in his address and appearance. Miss Larolles next, who, with her party, came back into the pit, ran up to  Cecilia, crying, "O my dear creature, what a monstrous shocking thing! You've  no Idea how I am frightened; do you know I happened to be quite at the further  end of the coffee-room when it began, and I could not get out to see what was  the matter for ten ages; only conceive what a situation!" "Would your fright, then, have been less," said Cecilia, "had you been nearer  the danger?" "O Lord no, for when I came within sight I was fifty times worse! I gave such a  monstrous scream, that it quite made Mr Meadows start. I dare say he'll tell me  of it these hundred years: but really when I saw them draw their swords I  thought I should have died; I was so amazingly surprized you've no notion." Here she was interrupted by the re-appearance of the active stranger, who again  advancing to Cecilia, said, "I am in doubt whether the efforts I make to revive  will please or irritate you, but though you rejected the last cordial I  ventured to present you, perhaps you will look with a more favourable eye  towards that of which I am now the herald." Cecilia then, casting her eyes around, saw that he was followed by Sir Robert  Floyer. Full of displeasure both at this introduction and at his presence, she  turned hastily to Mr Arnott, and entreated him to enquire if the carriage was  not yet ready. Sir Robert, looking at her with all the exultation of new-raised vanity, said,  with more softness than he had ever before addressed her, "Have you been  frightened?" "Every body, I believe was frightened," answered Cecilia, with an air of  dignity intended to check his rising expectations. "There was no sort of cause," answered he; "the fellow did not know whom he  spoke {to}, that was all." "Lord, Sir Robert," cried Miss Larolles, "how could you be so shocking as to  draw your sword? you can't conceive how horrid it looked." "Why I did not draw my sword," cried he, "I only had my hand on the hilt." "Lord, did not you, indeed! well, every body said you did, and I'm sure I  thought I saw five-and-twenty swords all at once. I thought one of you would be  killed every moment. It was horrid disagreeable, I assure you." Sir Robert was now called away by some gentlemen; and Mr Monckton, earnest to  be better informed of Cecilia's real sentiments, said, with affected concern,  "At present this matter is merely ridiculous; I am sorry to think in how short  a time it may become more important." "Surely," cried Cecilia with quickness, "some of their friends will interfere!  surely upon so trifling a subject they will not be so mad, so inexcusable, as  to proceed to more serious resentment!" "Whichever of them," said the stranger, "is most honoured by this anxiety, will  be mad indeed to risk a life so valued!" "Cannot you, Mr Monckton," continued Cecilia, too much alarmed to regard this  insinuation, "speak with Mr Belfield? You are acquainted with him, I know; is  it impossible you can follow him?" "I will with pleasure do whatever you wish; but still if Sir Robert—" "O, as to Sir Robert, Mr Harrel, I am very sure, will undertake him; I will try  to see him to-night myself, and entreat him to exert all his influence." "Ah, madam," cried the stranger, archly, and lowering his voice, "those French  beads and Bristol stones have not, I find, shone in vain!" At these words Cecilia recognised her white domino acquaintance at the  masquerade; she had before recollected his voice, but was too much perturbed to  consider where or when she had heard it. "If Mr Briggs," continued he, "does not speedily come forth with his plum  friend, before the glittering of swords and spears is joined to that of jewels,  the glare will be so resplendent, that he will fear to come within the  influence of its rays. Though, perhaps, he may only think the stronger the  light, the better he shall see to count his guineas: for as    '—-in ten thousand pounds    Ten thousand charms are centred,' in an hundred thousand, the charms may have such magic power, that he may defy  the united efforts of tinsel and knight-errantry to deliver you from the golden  spell." Here the Captain, advancing to Cecilia, said, "I have been looking for you in  vain partout, but the crowd has been so accablant I was almost reduced to  despair. Give me leave to hope you are now recovered from the horreur of this  little fracas?" Mr Arnott then brought intelligence that the carriage was ready. Cecilia, glad  to be gone, instantly hastened to it; and, as she was conducted by Mr Monckton,  most earnestly entreated him to take an active part, in endeavouring to prevent  the fatal consequences with which the quarrel seemed likely to terminate.
