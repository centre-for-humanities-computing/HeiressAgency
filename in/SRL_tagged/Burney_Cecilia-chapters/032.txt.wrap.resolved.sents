 In this disposition of mind Cecilia the next morning obeyed the summons of Mr  Delvile, and for the first time went to St James'-square in a humour to look  for evil instead of good, and meanness instead of nobleness.
mind Cecilia was shewn into an apartment where mind Cecilia found Mr  Delvile alone, and was  received by Mr  Delvile, as usual, with the most stately solemnity.
When mind Cecilia was seated, "I have given you, Miss Beverley," said Mr  Delvile, "the trouble  of calling, in order to discuss with you the internal state of your affairs; a  duty which, at this juncture, I hold to be incumbent upon my character.
The  delicacy due to your sex would certainly have induced me to wait upon you  Mr  Delvile for this purpose, but for the reasons I have already hinted to you, of  fearing the people with whom you live might think it necessary to return my  visit.
Persons of low origin are commonly in those matters the most forward.
Not, however, that I would prejudice you against Persons of low origin; though, for Mr  Delvile, it  is fit I remember that a general and indiscriminate acquaintance, by levelling  all ranks, does injury to the rites of society."
Ah!
thought Cecilia, how infallible is Mr Monckton!
and how inevitably, in a  family of which Mr  Delvile is the head, should I be cruelly held down, as the  disgrace of their alliance!
"I have applied," continued Mr  Delvile, "to Mrs Delvile, to know if the communication  which I had recommended to you, and to which Mrs Delvile had promised Mrs Delvile attention,  had yet passed; but I am informed you have not spoken to Mrs Delvile upon the subject."
"I had nothing, Sir, to communicate," answered Cecilia, "and I had hoped, as  Mrs Delvile made no enquiries, Cecilia was satisfied Cecilia had nothing to hear."
"With respect to enquiries," said Mrs Delvile, "I fear you are not sufficiently  aware of the distance between a lady of Mrs Delvile rank, both by birth and  alliance, and such a young woman as Mrs Harrel, whose ancestors, but a short  time since, were mere Suffolk farmers.
But I beg your pardon;—I mean not any  reflection upon yours: I have always heard they were very worthy people.
And a  farmer is certainly a very respectable person.
Your father, I think, no more  than the Dean your uncle, did nothing in that way Your father?"
"No, Sir," said Cecilia, drily, and much provoked by this contemptuous courtesy.
"I have always been told Your father was a very good sort of man: I knew none of the  family myself, but the Dean your uncle.
the Dean your uncle connections with the Bishop of ———, my  relation, put the Dean your uncle often in my way.
Though the Dean your uncle naming me for one of the Dean your uncle  trustees, I must own, was rather extraordinary; but I mean not to hurt you; on  the contrary, I should be much concerned to give you any uneasiness."
Again Mr Monckton arose in the mind of Cecilia, and again Mr Monckton acknowledged the  truth of Mr Monckton strictures; and though Mr Monckton much wondered in what an harangue so  pompous was to end, Mr Monckton disgust so far conquered Mr Monckton curiosity, that without  hearing it, Mr Monckton wished Mr Monckton away.
"To return," said Mr Monckton, "to my purpose.
The present period of your life is such  as to render advice particularly seasonable; I am sorry, therefore, as I before  said, you have not disclosed your situation to Mrs Delvile.
A young lady on the  point of making an establishment, and with many engagements in A young lady on the  point of making an establishment power, is  extremely liable to be mistaken in A young lady on the  point of making an establishment judgment, and therefore should solicit  instruction from those who are able to acquaint A young lady on the  point of making an establishment what connection would be  most to A young lady on the  point of making an establishment advantage.
One thing, however, I am happy to commend, the young man  who was wounded in the duel—I cannot recollect his name—is, I hear, totally  out of the question."
What next?
thought Cecilia; though still Cecilia gave him no interruption, for the  haughtiness of him manner was repulsive to reply.
"My design, therefore, is to speak to you of Sir Robert Floyer.
When I had last  the pleasure of addressing you upon this subject, you may probably remember my  voice was in Sir Robert Floyer favour; but I then regarded Sir Robert Floyer merely as the rival of an  inconsiderable young man, to rescue you from whom Sir Robert Floyer appeared an eligible  person.
The affair is now altered, Sir Robert Floyer is thought of no more, and  another rival comes forward, to whom Sir Robert is as inconsiderable as the  first rival was to Sir Robert."
Cecilia started at this information, livelier sensations stimulated Cecilia  curiosity, and surmises in which Cecilia was most deeply interested quickened Cecilia  attention.
"the  first rival," proceeded the  first rival, "I should imagine no young lady would a moment  hesitate in electing; the  first rival is every way the superior of Sir Robert except in  fortune, and the deficiencies of that the splendour of your own may amply  supply."
The deepest crimson now tinged the cheeks of Cecilia; the prophecy of Mr  Monckton seemed immediately fulfilling, and Monckton trembled with a rising conflict  between Monckton approbation of the offer, and Monckton dread of the offer consequences.
"I know not, indeed," continued he, "in what estimation you may have been  accustomed to hold rank and connection, nor whether you are impressed with a  proper sense of you are superiority and value; for early prejudices are not  easily rooted out, and those who have lived chiefly with monied people, regard  even birth itself as unimportant when compared with wealth."
The colour which first glowed in the cheeks of Cecilia from expectation, now  rose yet higher from resentment: Cecilia thought Cecilia already insulted by a  prelude so ostentatious and humiliating to the proposals which were to follow;  and Cecilia angrily determined, with whatever pain to Cecilia heart, to assert Cecilia own  dignity by refusing her own  dignity at once, too well satisfied by what Cecilia now saw of the  present, that Monckton had been just in Monckton prediction of the future.
"Your rejection, therefore," continued Monckton, "of this honourable offer, may  perhaps have been merely the consequence of the principles in which you have  been educated.—" "Rejection?"
interrupted Cecilia, amazed, "what rejection, Sir?"
"Have you not refused the proposals of my Lord Ernolf for my Lord Ernolf son?"
"Lord Ernolf?
never!
nor have I ever seen either his Lordship or his but in  public."
"That," replied Mr Delvile, "is little to the purpose; where the connexion is a  proper one, a young lady of delicacy has only to accede to the connexion.
But though Your rejection came not immediately from yourself, Your rejection had doubtless your  concurrence."
"Your rejection had not, Sir, even my knowledge."
"Your alliance then with Sir Robert Floyer is probably nearer a conclusion than  I had imagined, for otherwise Mr Harrel would not, without consulting you, have  given the Earl so determinate an answer."
"No, Sir," said Cecilia, impatiently, "my alliance with Sir was never more  distant, nor do I mean "my alliance with him should ever approach more near."
Cecilia was now little disposed for further conversation.
Cecilia heroic design of  refusing young Delvile by no means reconciled Cecilia to the discovery Cecilia now made  that young Delvile had not meant to address Cecilia; and though Cecilia was provoked and fretted  at this new proof that Mr Harrel scrupled neither assertions nor actions to  make Cecilia engagement with Sir Robert credited, Cecilia disappointment in finding  that Mr Delvile, instead of pleading the cause of his son, was exerting his  interest for another person, affected another person so much more nearly, that  notwithstanding his still continued his parading harangue, another person scarcely knew  even the subject of his discourse, and seized the first opportunity of a  cessation to rise and take another person leave.
his asked another person if another person would not call upon Mrs Delvile; but desirous to be alone,  another person declined the invitation; his then charged another person to proceed no further with Sir  Sir Robert till Sir Robert had made some enquiries concerning Lord Ernolf, and graciously  promising Sir Robert protection and counsel, suffered another person to depart.
Cecilia now perceived Cecilia might plan Cecilia rejections, or study Cecilia dignity at  Cecilia leisure, for neither Mrs Delvile nor Mrs Delvile son seemed in any haste to put Cecilia  fortitude to the proof.
With regard, therefore, to their plots and intentions,  Mr Monckton she found was wrong, but with respect to their conduct and  sentiments, she had every reason to believe his right: and though she heart  refused to rejoice in escaping a trial of her heart   strength, she judgment was so  well convinced that his painting was from the life, that she determined to  conquer she partiality for young Delvile, since she looked forward to nothing  but mortification in a connexion with his family.
