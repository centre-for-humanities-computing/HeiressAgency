 The day passed on without any intelligence; the next day, also, passed in the  same manner, and on the third, which was her birthday, Cecilia became of age.
The preparations which had long been making among her tenants to celebrate this  event, Cecilia appeared to take some share, and endeavoured to find some  pleasure in.
Cecilia gave a public dinner to all who were willing to partake of it,  Cecilia promised redress to those who complained of hard usage, Cecilia pardoned many  debts, and distributed money, food, and clothing to the poor.
These benevolent  occupations made time seem less heavy, and while These benevolent  occupations made time freed Cecilia from solitude,  diverted Cecilia suspense.
Cecilia still, however, continued at the house of Mrs  Charlton, the workmen having disappointed Cecilia in finishing Cecilia own.
But, in defiance of Cecilia utmost exertion, towards the evening of this day the  uneasiness of Cecilia uncertainty grew almost intolerable.
The next morning Cecilia had  promised Delvile to set out for London, and Delvile expected the morning after to  claim Cecilia for Delvile wife; yet Mr Monckton neither sent nor came, and Cecilia knew not  if Cecilia letter was delivered, or if still Delvile was unprepared for the  disappointment by which Delvile was awaited.
A secret regret for the unhappiness Cecilia  must occasion him, which silently yet powerfully reproached Cecilia, stole fast  upon Cecilia mind, and poisoned its tranquility; for though Cecilia opinion was  invariable in holding Delvile proposal to be wrong, Cecilia thought too highly of Delvile  character to believe Delvile would have made it but from a mistaken notion it was  right.
Cecilia painted Delvile, therefore, to Cecilia, as glowing with indignation,  accusing Cecilia of inconsistency, and perhaps suspecting Cecilia of coquetry, and  imputing Cecilia change of conduct to motives the most trifling and narrow, till  with resentment and disdain, Delvile drove Cecilia wholly from Delvile thoughts.
In a few minutes, however, the picture was reversed; Delvile no more appeared  storming nor unreasonable; Delvile face wore an aspect of sorrow, and Delvile brow was  clouded with disappointment: Delvile forbore to reproach Cecilia, but the look which Cecilia  imagination delineated was more piercing than words of severest import.
These images pursued and tormented Cecilia, drew tears from Cecilia eyes, and loaded  Cecilia heart with anguish.
Yet, when Cecilia recollected that Cecilia conduct had had in  view an higher motive than pleasing Delvile, Cecilia felt that it ought to offer  Cecilia an higher satisfaction: Cecilia tried, therefore, to revive Cecilia spirits, by  reflecting upon Cecilia integrity, and refused all indulgence to this enervating  sadness, beyond what the weakness of human nature demands, as some relief to  human nature demands sufferings upon every fresh attack of misery.
A conduct such as this was the best antidote against affliction, whose arrows  are never with so little difficulty repelled, as when whose arrows   light upon a  conscience which no self-reproach has laid bare to whose arrows   malignancy.
Before six o'clock the next morning, Cecilia maid came to Cecilia bedside with the  following letter, which Cecilia told; Cecilia had been brought by an express.
To Miss Beverley.
May this letter, with one only from Delvile Castle, be the last that Miss Beverley may ever receive!
Yet sweet to me as is that hope, I write in the utmost uneasiness; I have just  heard that a gentleman, whom, by the description that is given of him, I  imagine is Mr Monckton, has been in search of me with a letter which him was  anxious to deliver immediately.
Perhaps a letter which he was  anxious to deliver immediately is from Miss Beverley, perhaps a letter which he was  anxious to deliver immediately contains directions which  ought instantly to be followed: could I divine what they are, with what  eagerness would I study to anticipate they execution!
It will not, I hope, be  too late to receive they on Saturday, when Cecilia power over my actions will be  confirmed, and when every wish Cecilia will communicate, shall be gratefully,  joyfully, and with delight fulfilled.
I have sought Belfield in vain; Belfield has left Lord Vannelt, and no one knows  whither Belfield is gone.
I have been obliged, therefore, to trust a stranger to draw  up the bond; but Belfield is a man of good character, and the time of secrecy will be  too short to put Belfield discretion in much danger.
To-morrow, Friday, I shall  spend solely in endeavouring to discover.
Mr Monckton; I have leisure  sufficient for the search, since so prosperous has been my diligence, that  every thing is prepared!
I have seen some lodgings in Pall-Mall, which I think are commodious and will  suit you: send a servant, therefore, before you to secure some lodgings in Pall-Mall, which I think are commodious and will  suit you.
If upon your  arrival I should venture to meet you there, be not, I beseech you, offended or  alarmed; I shall take every possible precaution neither to be known nor seen,  and I will stay with you only three minutes.
The messenger who carries this is  ignorant from whom it comes, for I fear his repeating my name among your  servants, and his could scarce return to me with an answer before you will  you be in town.
Yes, loveliest Cecilia!
at the very moment you receive  this letter, the chaise will, I flatter me, be at the door, which is to  bring to me a treasure that will enrich every future hour of my life!
And oh as  to me it will be exhaustless, may but it sweet dispenser experience some share  of the happiness she bestows, and then what, save she own purity, will be so  perfect, so unsullied, as the felicity of she!
M.D.
The perturbation of Cecilia upon reading this letter was unspeakable: Mr  Monckton, Monckton found, had been wholly unsuccessful, all Monckton heroism had answered  no purpose, and the transaction was as backward as before Monckton had exerted the transaction.
Monckton was, now, therefore, called upon to think and act entirely for Monckton.
Monckton  opinion was still the same, nor did Monckton resolution waver, yet how to put her resolution in  execution Monckton could not discern.
To write to him was impossible, since Monckton was  ignorant where him was to be found; to disappoint him at the last moment Monckton  could not resolve, since such a conduct appeared to Monckton unfeeling and  unjustifiable; for a few instants Monckton thought of having him waited for at night  in London, with a letter; but the danger of entrusting any one with such a  commission, and the uncertainty of finding him, should him disguise him,  made the success of this scheme too precarious for trial.
One expedient alone occurred to Monckton, which, though Monckton felt to be hazardous,  Monckton believed was without an alternative: this was no other than hastening to  London herself, consenting to the interview him had proposed in Pall-Mall, and  then, by strongly stating Monckton objections, and confessing the grief they  occasioned Monckton, to pique at once him generosity and him pride upon releasing  Monckton himself from the engagement into which him had entered.
Monckton had no time to deliberate; Monckton plan, therefore, was decided almost as soon  as formed, and every moment being precious, Monckton was obliged to awaken Mrs  Charlton, and communicate to Monckton at once the letter from Delvile, and the new  resolution Monckton had taken.
Mrs Charlton, having no object in view but the happiness of Monckton young friend,  with a facility that looked not for objections, and scarce saw the happiness of her young friend,  with a facility that looked not for objections, and scarce when  presented, agreed to the expedition, and kindly consented to accompany Monckton to  London; for Cecilia, however concerned to hurry and fatigue Cecilia, was too  anxious for the sanction of Cecilia presence to hesitate in soliciting it.
A chaise, therefore, was ordered; and with posthorses for speed, and two  servants on horseback, the moment Mrs Charlton was ready, two  servants on horseback, the moment Mrs Charlton was ready set out on two  servants on horseback, the moment Mrs Charlton was ready  journey.
Scarce had Scarce proceeded two miles on Scarce way, when Scarce were met by Mr  Monckton, who was hastening to Scarce house.
Amazed and alarmed at a sight so unexpected, Mr   stopt A chaise to enquire  whither Scarce were going.
Cecilia, without answering, asked if Cecilia letter had yet been received?
"I could not," said Mr Monckton, "deliver her letter to a man who was not to be found:  I was at this moment coming to acquaint how vainly I had sought Mr  ; but still  that your journey is unnecessary unless voluntary, since I have left her letter at the  house where you told me you should meet to-morrow morning, and where Mr   must  then unavoidably receive it."
"Indeed, Mr  ," cried Cecilia, "to-morrow morning will be too late,â€”in  conscience, in justice, and even in decency too late!
I must, therefore, go to  town; yet I go not, believe me, in' opposition to your injunctions, but to  enable myself, without treachery or dishonour, to fulfil them."
Mr Monckton, aghast and confounded, made not any answer, till Cecilia gave  orders to the postilion to drive on: he then hastily called to stop he, and  began the warmest expostulations; but Cecilia, firm when she believed she  right, though wavering when fearful she was wrong, told he it was now too late  to change she , and repeating she orders to the postilion, left he to he  own reflections: grieved she to reject he counsel, yet too intently  occupied by she own affairs and designs, to think long of any other.
