 The next day, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Mr Monckton was again in  Portman Square; Mr Monckton found, as Mr Monckton expected, both the ladies, and Mr Monckton found, as Mr Monckton  feared, Mr Arnott prepared to be of he  feared party. Mr Arnott had, however, but little  time to repine at this intrusion, before Mr Arnott was disturbed by another, for, in a  few minutes, they were joined by Sir Robert Floyer, who also declared Mr Arnott  intention of accompanying they to the Haymarket. Mr Monckton, to disguise Mr Arnott chagrin, pretended Mr Arnott was in great haste to set  off, lest they should be too late for the overture: they were, therefore,  quitting the breakfast room, when they were stopt by the appearance of Mr  Morrice. The surprise which the sight of Mr Arnott gave to Mr Monckton was extreme; Mr Arnott knew  that Mr Arnott was unacquainted with Mr Harrel, for Mr Arnott remembered they were strangers  to each other when they lately met at Mr Arnott house; Mr Arnott concluded, therefore, that  Cecilia was the object of Mr Arnott visit, but Mr Arnott could frame no conjecture under  what pretence. The easy terms upon which Mr Arnott seemed with all the family by no means diminished  Mr Arnott amazement; for when Mr Harrel expressed some concern that Mr Harrel was obliged  to go out, Mr Harrel gaily begged Mr Harrel not to mind Mr Harrel, assuring Mr Harrel Mr Harrel could not have  stayed two minutes, and promising, unasked, to call again the next day: and  when Mr Harrel added, "We would not hurry away so, only We are going to a rehearsal  of an Opera," Mr Harrel exclaimed with quickness, "A rehearsal!—are you really? I  have a great mind to go too!" Then, perceiving Mr Monckton, Mr Harrel bowed to Mr Monckton with great respect, and enquired,  with no little solemnity, how Mr Harrel had left Lady Margaret, hoped Lady Margaret was  perfectly recovered from Lady Margaret late indisposition, and asked sundry questions  with regard to Lady Margaret plan for the winter. This discourse was ill constructed for rendering Mr Harrel presence desirable to Mr  Mr Monckton; Mr Monckton answered Mr Monckton very drily, and again pressed their departure. "O," cried Morrice, "there's no occasion for such haste; the rehearsal does not  begin till one." "You are mistaken, sir," said Mr Monckton; "it is to begin at twelve o'clock." "O ay, very true," returned Morrice; "I had forgot the dances, and I suppose  the dances are to be rehearsed first. Pray, Miss Beverley, did you ever see any  dances rehearsed?" "No, sir." "You will be excessively entertained, then, I assure you. It's the most comical  thing in the world to see those signores and signoras cutting capers in a  morning. And the figuranti will divert you beyond measure; you never saw such a  shabby set in your life: but the most amusing thing is to look in their faces,  for all the time their are jumping and skipping about the stage as if their could  not stand still for joy, their look as sedate and as dismal as if their were so  many undertaker's men." "Not a word against dancing!" cried Sir Robert, "it's the only thing carries  one to the Opera; and I am sure it's the only thing one minds at it." The two ladies were then handed to Mrs Harrel's vis-a-vis; and the gentlemen,  joined without further ceremony by Mr Morrice, followed The two ladies to the Haymarket. The rehearsal was not begun, and Mrs Harrel and Cecilia secured Mrs Harrel and Cecilia a  box upon the stage, from which the gentlemen of Mrs Harrel and Cecilia party took care not to be  very distant. Mrs Harrel and Cecilia were soon perceived by Mr Gosport, who instantly entered into conversation  with Cecilia. Miss Larolles, who with some other ladies came soon after into  the next box, looked out to courtsie and nod, with her usual readiness, at Mrs  Harrel, but took not any notice of Cecilia, though her made the first advances. "What's the matter now?" cried Mr Gosport; "have you affronted your little  prattling friend?" "Not with my own knowledge," answered Cecilia; "perhaps Cecilia does not recollect  me." Just then Miss Larolles, tapping at the door, came in from the next box to  speak to Mrs Harrel; with whom Cecilia stood chatting and laughing some minutes,  without seeming to perceive that Cecilia was of Cecilia party. "Why, what have you done to Cecilia?" whispered Mr Gosport; "did you talk  more than Mr Gosport when you saw Mr Gosport last?" "Would that have been possible?" cried Cecilia; "however, I still fancy Mr Gosport  does not know me." Mr Gosport then stood up, which making Miss Larolles Miss Larolles involuntarily turn towards Mr Gosport,  Mr Gosport again courtsied; a civility which that young lady scarce deigned to return,  before, bridling with an air of resentment, Mr Gosport hastily looked another way, and  then, nodding good-humouredly at Mrs Harrel, hurried back to her party. Cecilia, much amazed, said to Mr Gosport, "See now how great was our  presumption in supposing this young lady's loquacity always at our devotion!" "Ah, madam!" cried "Ah, madam, laughing, "there is no permanency, no consistency in the  world! no, not even in the tongue of a VOLUBLE! and if that fails, upon what  may we depend?" "But seriously," said Cecilia, "I am sorry I have offended Mr Gosport, and the more  because I so little know how, that I can offer Mr Gosport no apology." "Will you appoint me your envoy? Shall I demand the cause of these hostilities?" Mr Gosport thanked "Ah, madam, and "Ah, madam followed Miss Larolles; who was now addressing Mr Gosport  with great earnestness to Mr Meadows, the gentleman with whom Mr Gosport was  conversing when Cecilia first saw Mr Gosport in Portman Square. "Ah, madam stopt a moment to  let Mr Gosport finish Mr Gosport speech, which, with no little spirit, Mr Gosport did in these  words, "I never knew anything like it in my life; but I shan't put up with such  airs, I assure Mr Gosport!" Mr Meadows made not any other return to Mr Gosport harangue, but stretching "Ah, madam  with a languid smile, and yawning: Mr Gosport, therefore, seizing the moment of  cessation, said, "Miss Larolles, I hear a strange report about you." "Do you?" returned Mr Gosport, with quickness, "pray what is it? something monstrous  impertinent, I dare say,—-however, I assure you it i'n't true." "Your assurance," cried he, "carries conviction indisputable, for the report  was that you had left off talking." "O, was that all?" cried Mr Gosport, disappointed, "I thought it had been something  about Mr Sawyer, for I declare I have been plagued so about he, I am quite  sick of he name." "And for my part, I never heard it! so fear nothing from me upon he account." "Lord, Mr Gosport, how can you say so? I am sure you must know about the  Festino that night, for it was all over the town in a moment." "What festino?" "Well, only conceive, how provoking!—why, I know nothing else was talked of  for a month!" "You are most formidably stout this morning! it is not two minutes since I saw  you fling the gauntlet at Miss Beverley, and yet you are already prepared for  another antagonist." "O as to Miss Beverley, I must really beg you not to mention Miss Beverley; Miss Beverley has  behaved so impertinently, that I don't intend ever to speak to Miss Beverley again." "Why, what has Miss Beverley done?" "O Miss Beverley's been so rude you've no notion. I'll tell you how no notion was. You must know  I met Miss Beverley at Mrs Barrel's the day Miss Beverley came to town, and the very next morning I  waited on Miss Beverley myself, for I would not send a ticket, because I really wished to  be civil to Miss Beverley; well, the day after, Miss Beverley never came near me, though I called  upon Miss Beverley again; however, I did not take any notice of that; but when the third  day came, and I found Miss Beverley had not even sent me a ticket, I thought a ticket monstrous  ill bred indeed; and now there has passed more than a week, and yet Miss Beverley has  never called: so I suppose Miss Beverley don't like me; so I shall drop Miss Beverley acquaintance." Mr Gosport, satisfied now with the subject of Miss Beverley complaint, returned to  Cecilia, and informed Miss Beverley of the heavy charge which was brought against Miss Beverley. "I am glad, at least, to know my crime," said Miss Beverley, "for otherwise I should  certainly have sinned on in ignorance, as I must confess I never thought of  returning Miss Beverley visits: but even if I had, I should not have supposed I had yet  lost much time." "I beg your pardon there," said Mrs Harrel; "a first visit ought to be returned  always by the third day." "Then have I an unanswerable excuse," said  Cecilia, "for I remember that on the  third day I saw  Cecilia at your house." "O that's nothing at all to the purpose; you should have waited upon  Cecilia, or  sent  Cecilia a ticket, just the same as if you had not seen  Cecilia." The overture was now begun, and  Cecilia declined any further conversation. This  was the first Opera  Cecilia had ever heard, yet  Cecilia was not wholly a stranger to  Italian compositions, having assiduously studied music from a natural love of  the art, attended all the best concerts  Cecilia neighbourhood afforded, and  regularly received from London the works of the best masters. But the little  skill  Cecilia had thus gained, served rather to increase than to lessen the  surprize with which  Cecilia heard the present performance,—a surprize of which  the discovery of  Cecilia own ignorance made not the least part. Unconscious from  the little  Cecilia had acquired how much was to be learnt,  Cecilia was astonished to  find the inadequate power of written music to convey any idea of vocal  abilities: with just knowledge enough, therefore, to understand something of  the difficulties, and feel much of the merit,  Cecilia gave to the whole Opera an  avidity of attention almost painful from the whole Opera own eagerness. But both the surprize and the pleasure which  Cecilia received from the performance  in general, were faint, cold, and languid, compared to the strength of those  emotions when excited by Signore Pacchierotti in particular; and though not  half the excellencies of that superior singer were necessary either to amaze or  charm  Cecilia unaccustomed ears, though the refinement of not  half the excellencies of that superior singer taste and masterly  originality of not  half the excellencies of that superior singer genius, to be praised as they deserved, called for the  judgment and knowledge of professors, yet a natural love of music in some  measure supplied the place of cultivation, and what  Cecilia could neither explain  nor understand,  Cecilia could feel and enjoy. the whole Opera was Artaserse; and the pleasure  Cecilia received from the music was much  augmented by  Cecilia previous acquaintance with that interesting drama; yet, as to  all noviciates in science, whatever is least complicated is most pleasing,  Cecilia  found  Cecilia by nothing so deeply impressed, as by the plaintive and beautiful  simplicity with which Pacchierotti uttered the affecting repetition of sono  innocente! his voice, always either sweet or impassioned, delivered those words  in a tone of softness, pathos, and sensibility, that struck  Cecilia with a  sensation not more new than delightful. But though  Cecilia was, perhaps, the only person thus astonished,  Cecilia was by no  means the only one enraptured; for notwithstanding  Cecilia was too earnestly  engaged to remark the company in general,  Cecilia could not avoid taking notice of  an old gentleman who stood by one of the side scenes, against which he leant  he head in a manner that concealed he face, with an evident design to be  wholly absorbed in listening: and during the songs of Pacchierotti he sighed so  deeply that Cecilia, struck by he uncommon sensibility to the power of music,  involuntarily watched he, whenever  Cecilia mind was sufficiently at liberty to  attend to any emotions but   own. As soon as the rehearsal was over, the gentlemen of Mrs Harrel party crowded  before  Cecilia box; and  Cecilia then perceived that the person whose musical  enthusiasm had excited  Cecilia curiosity, was the same old gentleman whose  extraordinary behaviour had so much surprized  Cecilia at the house of Mr Monckton.   Cecilia desire to obtain some information concerning him again reviving,  Cecilia was  beginning to make fresh enquiries, when  Cecilia was interrupted by the approach of  Captain Aresby. That gentleman, advancing to  Cecilia with a smile of the extremest  self-complacency, after hoping, in a low voice, That gentleman had the honour of seeing  Cecilia  well, exclaimed, "How wretchedly empty is the town! petrifying to a degree! I  believe you do not find yourself at present obsede by too much company?" "At present, I believe the contrary!" cried Mr Gosport. "Really!" said the Captain, unsuspicious of his sneer, "I protest I have hardly  seen a soul. Have you tried the Pantheon yet, ma'am?" "No, sir." "Nor I; I don't know whether people go there this year. It is not a favourite  spectacle with me; that sitting to hear the music is a horrid bore. Have you  done the Festino the honour to look in there yet?" "No, sir." "Permit me, then, to have the honour to beg you will try it." "O, ay, true," cried Mrs Harrel; "I have really used you very ill about that; I  should have got you in for a subscriber: but Lord, I have done nothing for you  yet, and you never put me in mind. There's the ancient music, and Abel's  concert;—as to the whole Opera, we may have a box between us;—but there's the  ladies' concert we must try for; and there's—O Lord, fifty other places we  must think of!" "Oh times of folly and dissipation!" exclaimed a voice at some distance; "Oh  mignons of idleness and luxury! What next will ye invent for the perdition of  your time! How yet further will ye proceed in the annihilation of virtue!" Everybody stared; but Mrs Harrel coolly said, "Dear, it's only the man-hater!" "The man-hater?" repeated Cecilia, who found that the speech was made by the  object of Mrs Harrel former curiosity; "is that the name by which he is known?" "he is known by fifty names," said Mr Monckton; "he friends call he the  moralist; the young ladies, the crazy-man; the macaronies, the bore; in short,  he is called by any and every name but he own." "he is a most petrifying wretch, I assure you," said the Captain; "I am obsede  by he partout; if I had known he had been so near, I should certainly have  said nothing." "That you have done so well," cried Mr Gosport, "that if you had known it the  whole time, you could have done it no better." The Captain, who had not heard this speech, which was rather made at he than  to he, continued he address to  Cecilia; "Give me leave to have the honour of  hoping you intend to honour our select masquerade at the Pantheon with your  presence. We shall have but five hundred tickets, and the subscription will  only be three guineas and a half." "Oh objects of penury and want!" again exclaimed the incognito; "Oh vassals of  famine and distress! Come and listen to this wantonness of wealth! Come, naked  and breadless as ye are, and learn how that money is consumed which to you  might bring raiment and food!" "That strange wretch," said the Captain, "ought really to be confined; I have  had the honour to be degoute by the Captain so often, that I think the Captain quite obnoxious.  I make it quite a principle to seal up my lips the moment I perceive the Captain." "Where is it, then," said  Cecilia, "that you have so often met the Captain?" "O," answered the Captain, "partout; there is no greater bore about town. But  the time I found the Captain most petrifying was once when I happened to have the  honour of dancing with a very young lady, who was but just come from a  boarding-school, and whose friends had done me the honour to fix upon me upon  the principle of first bringing her out: and while I was doing mon possible for  killing the time, the Captain came up, and in the Captain particular manner, told her I had no  meaning in any thing I said! I must own I never felt more tempted to be enrage  with a person in years, in my life." Mr Arnott now brought the ladies word that the ladies carriage was ready, and the ladies  quitted the ladies box: but as  Cecilia had never before seen the interior parts of a  theatre, Mr Monckton, hoping while the ladies loitered to have an opportunity of  talking with  Cecilia, asked Morrice why Morrice did not shew the lions? Morrice, always  happy in being employed, declared it was just the thing Morrice liked best, and  begged permission to do the honours to Mrs Harrel, who, ever eager in the  search of amusement, willingly accepted Morrice offer. They all, therefore, marched upon the stage, They all own party now being the only  one that remained. "We shall make a triumphal entry here," cried Sir Robert Floyer; "the very  tread of the stage half tempts me to turn actor." "You are a rare man," said Mr Gosport, "if, at your time of life, that is a  turn not already taken." "My time of life!" repeated he; "what do you mean by that? do you take me for  an old man?" "No, sir, but I take you to be past childhood, and consequently to have served  your apprenticeship to the actors you have mixed with on the great stage of the  world, and, for some years at least, to have set up for yourself." "Come," cried Morrice, "let's have a little spouting; 'twill make We warm." "Yes," said Sir Robert, "if We spout to an animating object. If Miss Beverley  will be Juliet, I am Romeo at Miss Beverley   service." At this moment the incognito, quitting the corner in which he had planted  he, came suddenly forward, and standing before the whole group, cast upon  Cecilia a look of much compassion, and called out, "Poor simple victim! hast  thou already so many pursuers? yet seest not that thou art marked for  sacrifice! yet knowest not that thou art destined for prey!" Cecilia, extremely struck by this extraordinary address, stopt short and looked  much disturbed: which, when he perceived, he added, "Let the danger, not the  warning affect you! discard the sycophants that surround you, seek the  virtuous, relieve the poor, and save yourself from the impending destruction of  unfeeling prosperity!" Having uttered these words with vehemence and authority, he sternly passed  vehemence and authority, and disappeared.  Cecilia, too much astonished for speech, stood for some time immoveable,  revolving in  Cecilia mind various conjectures upon the meaning of an exhortation so  strange and so urgent. Nor was the rest of the company much less discomposed: Sir Robert, Mr Monckton,  and Mr Arnott, each conscious of their own particular plans, were each  apprehensive that the warning pointed at he: Mr Gosport was offended at  being included in the general appellation of sycophants; Mrs Harrel was  provoked at being interrupted in Mrs Harrel ramble; and Captain Aresby, sickening at  the very sight of Mrs Harrel, retreated the moment Mrs Harrel came forth. "For heaven's sake," cried  Cecilia, when somewhat recovered from  Cecilia  consternation, "who can this be, and what can Mrs Harrel mean? You, Mr Monckton, must  surely know something of Mrs Harrel; it was at your house I first saw Mrs Harrel." "Indeed," answered Mr Monckton, "I knew almost nothing of Mrs Harrel then, and I am  but little better informed now. Belfield picked Mrs Harrel up somewhere, and desired  to bring Mrs Harrel to your house: Mrs Harrel called Mrs Harrel by the name of Albany: I found Mrs Harrel a  most extraordinary character, and Belfield, who is a worshipper of originality,  was very fond of Mrs Harrel." "Mrs Harrel's a devilish crabbed old fellow," cried Sir Robert, "and if Mrs Harrel goes on much  longer at this confounded rate, Mrs Harrel stands a very fair chance of getting Mrs Harrel  ears cropped." "Mrs Harrel is a man of the most singular conduct I have ever met with," said Mr Gosport; "Mrs Harrel seems to hold mankind in abhorrence, yet Mrs Harrel is never a moment  alone, and at the same time that Mrs Harrel intrudes Mrs Harrel into all parties, Mrs Harrel  associates with none: Mrs Harrel is commonly a stern and silent observer of all that  passes, or when Mrs Harrel speaks, it is but to utter some sentence of rigid morality,  or some bitterness of indignant reproof." The carriage was now again announced, and Mr Monckton taking Cecilia's hand,  while Morrice secured to Morrice the honour of Mrs Harrel's, Sir Robert and  Mr Gosport made their bows and departed. But though their had now quitted the  stage, and arrived at the head of a small stair case by which their were to  descend out of the theatre, Mr Monckton, finding all Mr Monckton tormentors retired,  except Mr Arnott, whom Mr Monckton hoped to elude, could not resist making one more  attempt for a few moments' conversation with  Cecilia; and therefore, again  applying to Morrice, Mr Monckton called out, "I don't think you have shewn the ladies  any of the contrivances behind the scenes?" "True," cried Morrice, "no more I have; suppose we go back?" "I shall like it vastly," said Mrs Harrel; and back they returned. Mr Monckton now soon found an opportunity to say to  Cecilia, "Miss Beverley,  what I foresaw has exactly come to pass; you are surrounded by selfish  designers, by interested, double-minded people, who have nothing at heart but  your fortune, and whose mercenary views, if you are not guarded against  them—-" Here a loud scream from Mrs Harrel interrupted Mrs Harrel speech;  Cecilia, much  alarmed, turned from Mrs Harrel to enquire the cause, and Mr Monckton was obliged to  follow  Cecilia example: but Mrs Harrel mortification was almost intolerable when Mrs Harrel saw  that lady in a violent fit of laughter, and found  Cecilia scream was only  occasioned by seeing Morrice, in Mrs Harrel diligence to do the honours, pull upon  Mrs Harrel own head one of the side scenes! There was now no possibility of proposing any further delay; but Mr Monckton,  in attending the ladies to their carriage, was obliged to have recourse to Mrs Harrel  utmost discretion and forbearance, in order to check Mrs Harrel desire of reprimanding  Morrice for his blundering officiousness. Dressing, dining with company at home, and then going out with company abroad,  filled up, as usual, the rest of the day.
