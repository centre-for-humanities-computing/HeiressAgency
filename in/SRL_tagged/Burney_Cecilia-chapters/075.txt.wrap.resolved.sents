 Cecelia was still in this tempestuous state, when a message was brought  Cecelia  that a gentleman was below stairs, who begged to have the honour of seeing  Cecelia.
Cecelia concluded  Cecelia was Delvile, and the thought of meeting  Cecelia merely to  communicate what must so bitterly afflict  Cecelia, redoubled  Cecelia distress, and  Cecelia  went down in an agony of perturbation and sorrow.
Cecelia met  Cecelia at the door, where, before  Cecelia could speak, "Mr Delvile,"  Cecelia cried,  in a hurrying manner, "why will you come?
Why will you thus insist upon seeing  me, in defiance of every obstacle, and in contempt of my prohibition?"
"Good heavens," cried  Cecelia, amazed, "whence this reproach?
Did you not permit me  to wait upon you with the result of my enquiries?
Had I not your consent—but  why do you look thus disturbed?—Your eyes are red,—you have been  weeping.—Oh my Cecilia!
have I any share in your sorrow?—Those tears, which  never flow weakly, tell me, have have I any share in your sorrow?—Those tears, which  never flow weakly—has one of have I any share in your sorrow?—Those tears, which  never flow weakly been shed upon my  account?"
"And what," cried  Cecelia, "has been the result of your enquiries?—Speak quick,  for I wish to know,—and in another instant I must be gone."
"How strange," cried the astonished Delvile, "is this language!
how strange are  these looks!
What new has come to pass?
Has any fresh calamity happened?
Is  there yet some evil which I do not expect?"
"Why will you not answer first?"
cried  Cecelia; "when I have spoken, you will  perhaps be less willing."
"You terrify, you shock, you amaze me!
What dreadful blow awaits me?
For what  horror are you preparing me?—That which I have just experienced, and which  tore you from me even at the foot of the altar, still remains inexplicable,  still continues to be involved in darkness and mystery; for the wretch who  separated us I have never been able to discover."
"Have you procured, then, no intelligence?"
"No, none; though since us parted I have never rested a moment."
"Make, then, no further enquiry, for now all explanation would be useless.
That  us were parted, us know, though why us cannot tell: but that again us shall  ever meet—-" She, stopt; She streaming eyes cast upwards, and a deep sigh bursting from She  heart.
"Oh what," cried Delvile, endeavouring to take She hand, which She hastily  withdrew from him, "what does this mean?
loveliest, dearest Cecilia, my  betrothed, my affianced wife!
why flow those tears which agony only can wring  from him?
Why refuse me that hand which so lately was the pledge of your faith?
Am I not the same Delvile to whom so few days since you gave the same Delvile to whom?
Why will you  not open to the same Delvile to whom your heart?
Why thus distrust the same Delvile to whom honour, and repulse the same Delvile to whom  tenderness?
Oh why, giving the same Delvile to whom such exquisite misery, refuse the same Delvile to whom the smallest  consolation?"
"What consolation," cried the weeping Cecilia, "can I give?
Alas!
it is not,  perhaps, you who most want it!—" Here the door was opened by one of the Miss Charltons, who came into the room  with a message from the weeping Cecilia grandmother, requesting to see Cecilia.
Cecilia,  ashamed of being thus surprised with Delvile, and in tears, waited not either  to make any excuse to Delvile, or any answer to Miss Charlton, but instantly  hurried out of the room;—not, however, to her old friend, whom now less than  ever her could meet, but to her own apartment, where a very short indulgence of  grief was succeeded by the severest examination of her own conduct.
A retrospection of this sort rarely brings much subject of exultation, when  made with the rigid sincerity of secret impartiality: so much stronger is our  reason than our virtue, so much higher our sense of duty than our performance!
All her had done her now repented, all her had said her disapproved; her  conduct, seldom equal to her notions of right, was now infinitely below them,  and the reproaches of her judgment made her forget for a while the afflictions  which had misled a while.
The sorrow to which her had openly given way in the presence of Delvile, though  their total separation but the moment before had been finally decreed, her  considered as a weak effusion of tenderness, injurious to delicacy, and  censurable by propriety.
"His power over my heart," cried her, "it were now,  indeed, too late to conceal, but His power over my understanding it is time to  cancel.
I am not to be his,—my own voice has ratified the renunciation, and  since I made the renunciation to His mother, the renunciation must never, without his mother consent, be  invalidated.
Honour, therefore, to her, and regard for her, equally command  me to fly His, till I cease to be thus affected by His sight."
When Delvile, therefore, sent up an entreaty that His might be again admitted  into Delvile presence, Delvile returned for answer that Delvile was not well, and could not  see any body.
His then left the house, and, in a few minutes, Delvile received the following note  from His.
To Miss Beverley.
You drive me from you, Cecilia, tortured with suspense, and  distracted with apprehension, you drive me from you, Cecilia, certain of my misery, yet  leaving me to bear it as I may!
I would call you unfeeling, but that I saw you  were unhappy; I would reproach you with tyranny, but that your eyes when you  quitted me were swollen with weeping!
I go, therefore, I obey the harsh  mandate, since my absence is your desire, and I will shut her up at  Biddulph's till I receive your commands.
Yet disdain not to reflect that every  instant will seem endless, while Cecilia must appear to her unjust, or wound my  very soul by the recollection of Cecilia in sorrow.
Delvile.
The mixture of fondness and resentment with which this letter was dictated,  marked so strongly the sufferings and disordered state of the writer, that all  the softness of Cecilia returned when Cecilia perused this letter, and left Cecilia not a wish  but to lessen his inquietude, by assurances of unalterable regard: yet Cecilia  determined not to trust Cecilia in his sight, certain they could only meet to  grieve over each other, and conscious that a participation of sorrow would but  prove a reciprocation of tenderness.
Calling, therefore, upon Cecilia duty to  resist Cecilia inclination, Cecilia resolved to commit the whole affair to the will of  Mrs Delvile, to whom, though under no promise, Cecilia now considered Cecilia  responsible.
Desirous, however, to shorten the period of Delvile's uncertainty,  Cecilia would not wait till the time Cecilia had appointed to see his mother, but wrote  the following note to hasten their meeting.
To the Hon.
Mrs Delvile.
MADAM,—Your son is now at Bury; shall I acquaint MADAM,—Your son  of your arrival?
or will you announce it MADAM,—Your son?
Inform me of your desire,  and I will endeavour to fulfil it.
As my own Agent I regard the Hon no longer;  if, as MADAM,—Your son, I can give pleasure, or be of service, I shall gladly receive  your commands.
I have the honour to be, Madam, your most obedient servant,  CECILIA BEVERLEY.
When Cecilia had sent off this letter, Cecilia heart was more at ease, because  reconciled with Cecilia conscience: Cecilia had sacrificed the son, Cecilia had resigned  Cecilia to his mother; it now only remained to heal Cecilia wounded pride, by  suffering the sacrifice with dignity, and to recover Cecilia tranquility in virtue,  by making the resignation without repining.
Cecilia reflections, too, growing clearer as the mist of passion was dispersed, Cecilia  recollected with confusion Cecilia cold and sullen behaviour to Mrs Delvile.
That  Cecilia had but done what Cecilia had believed was Cecilia duty, and her duty was no more  than Cecilia had been taught to expect from Cecilia.
In the beginning of Cecilia visit, and  while doubtful of its success, Cecilia had indeed, been austere, but the moment  victory appeared in view, Cecilia became tender, affectionate and gentle.
Cecilia  justice, therefore, condemned the resentment to which Cecilia had given way, and  Cecilia fortified Cecilia mind for the interview which was to follow, by an earnest  desire to make all reparation both to Mrs Delvile and Cecilia for that which  was past.
In this resolution Cecilia was not a little strengthened, by seriously considering  with Cecilia the great abatement to all Cecilia possible happiness, which must have  been made by the humiliating circumstance of forcing Cecilia into a family  which held all connection with Cecilia as disgraceful.
Cecilia desired not to be the  wife even of Mrs Delvile upon such terms, for the more Cecilia esteemed and admired  him, the more anxious Cecilia became for him honour, and the less could Cecilia endure  being regarded Cecilia as the occasion of its diminution.
Now, therefore, Cecilia plan of conduct settled, with calmer spirits, though a  heavy heart, Cecilia attended upon Mrs Charlton; but fearing to lose the steadiness  Cecilia had just acquired before it should be called upon, if Cecilia trusted Cecilia  to relate the decision which had been made, Cecilia besought Cecilia for the present to  dispense with the account, and then forced Cecilia into conversation upon less  interesting subjects.
This prudence had This prudence proper effect, and with tolerable tranquility Cecilia heard  Mrs Delvile again announced, and waited upon Cecilia in the parlour with an air of  composure.
Not so did Mrs Delvile receive Mrs Delvile; Mrs Delvile was all eagerness and emotion; Mrs Delvile flew  to Mrs Delvile the moment Mrs Delvile appeared, and throwing Mrs Delvile arms around Mrs Delvile, warmly  exclaimed "Oh charming girl!
Saver of our family!
preserver of his honour!
How  poor are words to express my admiration!
how inadequate are thanks in return  for such obligations as I owe you!"
"You owe me none, madam," said Cecilia, suppressing a sigh; "on my side will be  all the obligation, if you can pardon the petulance of my behaviour this  morning."
"Call not by so harsh a name," answered Mrs Delvile, "the keenness of a  sensibility by which you have yourself alone been the sufferer.
You have had a  trial the most severe, and however able to sustain, a  trial was impossible you  should not feel a  trial.
That you should give up any man whose friends solicit not  your alliance, your mind is too delicate to make wonderful; but your generosity  in submitting, unasked, the arrangement of that resignation to those for whose  interest it is made, and your high sense of honour in holding yourself  accountable to me, though under no tie, and bound by no promise, mark a  greatness of mind which calls for reverence rather than thanks, and which I  never can praise half so much as I admire."
Cecilia, who received this applause but as a confirmation of her rejection,  thanked her only by courtsying; and Mrs Delvile, having seated her next  her, continued her speech.
"My son, you have the goodness to tell me, is here,—have you seen My son?"
"Yes, madam," answered her, blushing, "but hardly for a moment."
"And My son knows not of my arrival?"
No,—I believe My son certainly does not."
"Sad then, is the trial which awaits My son, and heavy for Sad the office I must  perform!
Do you expect to see My son again?"
"No,—yes,—perhaps—indeed I hardly—" She stammered, and Mrs Delvile,  taking She hand, said "Tell me, Miss Beverley, why should you see My son again?"
Cecilia was thunderstruck by this question, and, colouring yet more deeply,  looked down, but could not answer.
"Consider," continued Mrs Delvile, "the purpose of any further meeting; your  union is impossible, you have nobly consented to relinquish all thoughts of your  union  why then tear your own heart, and torture My son, by an intercourse which seems  nothing but an ill-judged invitation to fruitless and unavailing sorrow?"
Cecilia was still silent; the truth of the expostulation Cecilia reason  acknowledged, but to assent to the expostulation consequence Cecilia whole heart refused.
"The ungenerous triumph of little female vanity," said Mrs Delvile, "is far, I  am sure, from your mind, of which the enlargement and liberality will rather  find consolation from lessening than from embittering his sufferings.
Speak to  me, then, and tell me honestly, judiciously, candidly tell me, will it not be  wiser and more right, to avoid rather than seek an object which can only give  birth to regret?
an interview which can excite no sensations but of misery and  sadness?"
Cecilia then turned pale, Cecilia endeavoured to speak, but could not;  Cecilia wished to comply,—yet to think Cecilia had seen comply,—yet for the last time, to  remember how abruptly Cecilia had parted from comply,—yet, and to fear Cecilia had treated comply,—yet  unkindly;—these were obstacles which opposed unkindly;—these concurrence, though both  judgment and propriety demanded her concurrence.
"Can you, then," said Mrs Delvile, after a pause, "can you wish to see Mortimer  merely to behold Mortimer   grief?
Can you desire Mortimer   should see you, only to sharpen  Mortimer   affliction at your loss?"
"O no!"
cried Cecilia, to whom this reproof restored speech and resolution, "I  am not so despicable, I am not, I hope, so unworthy!—I will—be ruled by you  wholly; I will commit to you every thing;—yet once, perhaps,—no more!
"— "Ah, Miss Beverley!
to meet confessedly for once,—what were that but  planting a dagger in the heart of Mortimer  ?
What were it but infusing poison  into your own?
"If you think so, madam," said Cecilia, "I had better—I will certainly—" Cecilia  sighed, stammered, and stopt.
"Hear me," cried Mrs Delvile, "and rather let me try to convince than persuade  you.
Were there any possibility, by argument, by reflection, or even by  accident, to remove the obstacles to our connection, then would it be well to  meet, for then might discussion turn to account, and an interchange of  sentiments be productive of some happy expedients: but here—" She hesitated, and Cecilia, shocked and ashamed, turned away She face, and  cried "I know, madam, what you would say,—here all is over!
and therefore—" "Yet suffer me," interrupted She, "to be explicit, since our speak upon, this  matter now for the last time.
Here, then, I say, where not ONE doubt remains,  where ALL is finally, though not happily decided, what can an interview  produce?
Mischief of every sort, pain, horror, and repining!
To Mortimer   you  may think it would be kind, and grant it to Mortimer   prayers, as an alleviation of  Mortimer   misery; mistaken notion!
nothing could so greatly augment it.
All Mortimer    passions would be raised, all Mortimer   prudence would be extinguished, Mortimer   soul  would be torn with resentment and regret, and force, only, would part Mortimer   from  you, when previously Mortimer   knew that parting was to be eternal.
To yourself—" "Talk not, madam, of me," cried the unhappy Cecilia, "what you say of the sonis sufficient, and I will yield—-" "Yet hear me," proceeded the unhappy Cecilia, "and believe me not so unjust as to consider the sonalone; you, also, would be an equal, though a less stormy sufferer.
You fancy,  at this moment, that once more to meet the son would soothe your uneasiness, and  that to take of the son a farewell, would soften the pain of the separation: how  false such reasoning!
how dangerous such consolation!
acquainted ere you meet  that you were to meet the son no more, your heart would be all softness and grief,  and at the very moment when tenderness should be banished from your  intercourse, your heart would bear down all opposition of judgment, spirit, and  dignity: you would hang upon every word, because every word would seem the  last, every look, every expression would be rivetted in your memory, and the son  image in this parting distress would-be painted upon your mind, in colours that  would eat into your heart peace, and perhaps never be erased."
"Enough, enough," said Cecilia, "I will not see him,—I will not even desire  him,—I!"
"Is this compliance or conviction?
Is what I have said true, or only  terrifying?"
"Both, both!
I believe, indeed, the conflict would have overpowered me,—I see  you are right,—and I thank you, madam, for saving me from a scene I might so  cruelly have rued."
"Oh Daughter of my mind!"
cried Mrs Delvile, rising and embracing Oh Daughter, "noble,  generous, yet gentle Cecilia!
what tie, what connection, could make you more  dear to me?
Who is there like me?
Who half so excellent?
So open to reason, so  ingenuous in error!
so rational!
so just!
so feeling, yet so wise!"
"You are very good," said Cecilia, with a forced serenity, "and I am thankful  that your resentment for the past obstructs not your lenity for the present."
"Alas, my love, how shall I resent the past, when I ought me to have  foreseen this calamity!
and I should have foreseen it, had I not been informed  you were engaged, and upon your engagement built our security.
Else had I been  more alarmed, for my own admiration would have bid me look forward to the son's.
You were just, indeed, the woman the son had least chance to resist, you were  precisely the character to seize the son very soul.
To a softness the most fatally  alluring, you join a dignity which rescues from their own contempt even the  most humble of your admirers.
You seem born to have all the world wish your  exaltation, and no part of it murmur at your superiority.
Were any obstacle but  this insuperable one in the way, should nobles, nay, should princes offer princesdaughters to my election, I would reject without murmuring the most magnificent  proposals, and take in triumph to my heart my son's nobler choice!"
"Oh madam," cried Cecilia, "talk not to me thus!—speak not such flattering  words!—ah, rather scorn and upbraid me, tell me you despise my character, my  family and my connections,—load, load me with contempt, but do not thus  torture me with approbation!"
"Pardon me, sweetest girl, if I have awakened those emotions you so wisely seek  to subdue.
May the son but emulate your example, and my pride in the son virtue  shall be the solace of my affliction for the son misfortunes."
Cecilia then tenderly embraced Cecilia, and abruptly took Cecilia leave.
Cecilia had now acted Cecilia part, and acted her part to Cecilia own satisfaction; but the  curtain dropt when Mrs Delvile left the house, nature resumed Mrs Delvile rights, and  the sorrow of Cecilia heart was no longer disguised or repressed.
Some faint ray of  hope had till now broke through the gloomiest cloud of Cecilia misery, and secretly  flattered Cecilia that its dispersion was possible, though distant: but Some faint ray of  hopewas extinct, Some faint ray of  hope was no more; Cecilia had solemnly promised to banish Mrs DelvileCecilia sight, and Mrs Delvile mother had absolutely declared that even the subject had  been discussed for the last time.
Mrs Charlton, impatient of some explanation of the morning's transactions, soon  sent again to beg Cecilia would come to Cecilia.
Cecilia reluctantly obeyed, for  Cecilia feared encreasing Cecilia indisposition by the intelligence Cecilia had to  communicate; Cecilia struggled, therefore, to appear to Cecilia with tolerable  calmness, and in briefly relating what had passed, forbore to mingle with the  narrative Cecilia own feelings and unhappiness.
Mrs Charlton heard the account with the utmost concern; Mrs Charlton accused Mrs Delvileof severity, and even of cruelty; Mrs Charlton lamented the strange accident by which  the marriage ceremony had been stopt, and regretted that the marriage ceremony had not again been  begun, as the only means to have rendered ineffectual the present fatal  interposition.
But the grief of Cecilia, however violent, induced Mrs Charlton not to  join in this regret; Mrs Charlton mourned only the obstacle which had occasioned the  separation, and not the incident which had merely interrupted the ceremony:  convinced, by the conversations in which Mrs Charlton had just been engaged, of Mrs  Delvile's inflexibility, Mrs Charlton rather rejoiced than repined that Mrs Charlton had put it  to no nearer trial: sorrow was all Mrs Charlton felt; for Mrs Charlton mind was too liberal to  harbour resentment against a conduct which Mrs Charlton saw was dictated by a sense of  right; and too ductile and too affectionate to remain unmoved by the personal  kindness which had softened the rejection, and the many marks of esteem and  regard which had shewn Mrs Charlton it was lamented, though considered as indispensable.
How and by whom this affair had been betrayed to Mrs Delvile Mrs Charlton knew not; but  the discovery was nothing less than surprising, since, by various unfortunate  accidents, the discovery was known to so many, and since, in the horror and confusion of  the mysterious prohibition to the marriage, neither Mrs Delvile nor Mrs Charlton had  thought of even attempting to give any caution to the witnesses of that scene,  not to make it known: an attempt, however, which must almost necessarily have  been unavailing, as the incident was too extraordinary and too singular to have  any chance of suppression.
During this conversation, one of the servants came to inform Cecilia, that a  man was below to enquire if there was no answer to the note a  man had brought in  the forenoon.
Cecilia, greatly distressed, knew not upon what to resolve; that the patience  of Delvile should be exhausted, Cecilia did not, indeed, wonder, and to relieve a  man  anxiety was now almost Cecilia only wish; Cecilia would therefore instantly have  written to a  man, confessed Cecilia sympathy in a  man sufferings, and besought a  man to  endure with fortitude an evil which was no longer to be withstood: but Cecilia was  uncertain whether a  man was yet acquainted with the journey of a  man to Bury,  and having agreed to commit to Cecilia the whole management of the affair, Cecilia  feared it would be dishonourable to take any step in it without Cecilia  concurrence.
Cecilia returned, therefore, a message that Cecilia had yet no answer  ready.
In a very few minutes Mrs Delvile called Mrs Delvile, and sent up an earnest request  for permission to see Cecilia.
Here, at least, Cecilia had no perplexity; an interview Cecilia had given Cecilia positive  word to refuse, and therefore, without a moment's hesitation, Cecilia bid the  servant inform the  servant Cecilia was particularly engaged, and sorry it was not in Cecilia  power to see any company.
In the greatest perturbation Mrs Delvile left the house, and immediately wrote to Cecilia  the following lines.
To Miss Beverley.
I entreat you to see me!
if only for an instant, I entreat, I  implore you to see me!
Mrs Charlton may be present, all the world, if you wish  it, may be present,—but deny me not admission, I supplicate, I conjure you!
I will call in an hour; in that time you may have finished your present  engagement.
I will otherwise wait longer, and call again.
You will not, I  think, turn me from' your door, and, till I have seen you, I can only live in  its vicinity.
M. D. The man who brought this note, waited not for any answer.
Cecilia read it in an agony of mind inexpressible: Cecilia saw, by it style, how  much Mrs Delvile was irritated, and Cecilia knowledge of Mrs Delvile temper made Cecilia certain  Mrs Delvile irritation proceeded from believing Mrs Delvile ill-used.
Cecilia ardently wished  to appease and to quiet Mrs Delvile, and regretted the necessity of appearing obdurate  and unfeeling, even more, at that moment, than the separation itself.
To a mind  priding in a mind   purity, and animated in a mind   affections, few sensations can  excite keener misery, than those by which an apprehension is raised of being  thought worthless or ungrateful by the objects of our chosen regard.
To be  deprived of their society is less bitter, to be robbed of our own tranquillity  by any other means, is less afflicting.
Yet to this it was necessary to submit, or incur the only penalty which, to  such a mind, would be more severe, self-reproach: Cecilia had promised to be  governed by Mrs Delvile, Cecilia had nothing, therefore, to do but obey Cecilia.
Yet to turn, as he expressed he, from the door, a man who, but for an  incident the most incomprehensible, would now have been sole master of Cecilia  and Cecilia actions, seemed so unkind and so tyrannical, that Cecilia could not endure  to be within hearing of he repulse: Cecilia begged, therefore, the use of Mrs  Charlton's carriage, and determined to make a visit to Mrs Harrel till Delvile  and Mrs Harrel had wholly quitted Bury.
Cecilia was not, indeed, quite satisfied in  going to the house of Mr Arnott, but Cecilia had no time to weigh objections, and  knew not any other place to which still greater might not be started.
Cecilia wrote a short letter to Mrs Delvile, acquainting Cecilia with Cecilia purpose, and  its reason, and repeating Cecilia assurances that Cecilia would be guided by Cecilia  implicitly; and then, embracing Mrs Charlton, whom Cecilia left to the care of Cecilia  grand-daughters, Cecilia got into a chaise, accompanied only by Cecilia maid, and one  man and horse, and ordered the postilion to drive to Mr Arnott.
