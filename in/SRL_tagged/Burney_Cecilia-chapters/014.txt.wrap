 The first check this tranquillity received was upon the day of the masquerade,  the preparations for which have been already mentioned. The whole house was  then in commotion from various arrangements and improvements which were planned  for almost every apartment that was to be opened for the reception of masks.  Cecilia herself, however little pleased with the attendant circumstance of  wantonly accumulating unnecessary debts, was not the least animated of the  party: she was a stranger to every diversion of this sort, and from the novelty  of the scene, hoped for uncommon satisfaction. At noon Mrs Harrel sent for her to consult upon a new scheme which occurred to  Mr Harrel, of fixing in fantastic forms some coloured lamps in the drawing-room. While they were all discoursing this matter over, one of the servants, who had  two or three times whispered some message to Mr Harrel, and then retired, said,  in a voice not too low to be heard by Cecilia, "Indeed, Sir, I can't get him  away." "He's an insolent scoundrel," answered Mr Harrel; "however, if I must speak to  him, I must;" and went out of the room. Mrs Harrel still continued to exercise her fancy upon this new project, calling  both upon Mr Arnott and Cecilia to admire her taste and contrivance; till they  were all interrupted by the loudness of a voice from below stairs, which  frequently repeated, "Sir, I can wait no longer! I have been put off till I can  be put off no more!" Startled by this, Mrs Harrel ceased her employment, and they all stood still  and silent. They then heard Mr Harrel with much softness answer, "Good Mr  Rawlins, have a little patience; I shall receive a large sum of money  to-morrow, or next day, and you may then depend upon being paid." "Sir," cried the man, "you have so often told me the same, that it goes just  for nothing: I have had a right to it a long time, and I have a bill to make up  that can't be waited for any longer." "Certainly, Mr Rawlins," replied Mr Harrel, with still increasing gentleness,  "and certainly you shall have it: nobody means to dispute your right; I only  beg you to wait a day, or two days at furthest, and you may then depend upon  being paid. And you shall not be the worse for obliging me; I will never employ  any body else, and I shall have occasion for you very soon, as I intend to make  some alterations at Violet-Bank that will be very considerable." "Sir," said the man, still louder, "it is of no use your employing me, if I can  never get my money. All my workmen must be paid whether I am or no; and so, if  I must needs speak to a lawyer, why there's no help for it." "Did you ever hear any thing so impertinent?" exclaimed Mrs Harrel; "I am sure  Mr Harrel will be very much to blame, if ever he lets that man do any thing  more for him." Just then Mr Harrel appeared, and, with an air of affected unconcern, said,  "Here's the most insolent rascal of a mason below stairs I ever met with in my  life; he has come upon me, quite unexpectedly, with a bill of 400 pounds, and  won't leave the house without the money. Brother Arnott, I wish you would do me  the favour to speak to the fellow, for I could not bear to stay with him any  longer." "Do you wish me to give him a draft for the money upon my own banker?" "That would be vastly obliging," answered Mr Harrel, "and I will give you my  note for it directly. And so we shall get rid of this fellow at once: and he  shall do nothing more for me as long as he lives. I will run up a new building  at Violet-Bank next summer, if only to shew him what a job he has lost." "Pay the man at once, there's a good brother," cried Mrs Harrel, "and let's  hear no more of him." The two gentlemen then retired to another room, and Mrs Harrel, after praising  the extreme good-nature of her brother, of whom she was very fond, and  declaring that the mason's impertinence had quite frightened her, again  returned to her plan of new decorations. Cecilia, amazed at this indifference to the state of her husband's affairs,  began to think it was her own duty to talk with her upon the subject: and  therefore, after a silence so marked that Mrs Harrel enquired into its reason,  she said, "Will you pardon me, my dear friend, if I own I am rather surprized  to see you continue these preparations?" "Lord, why?" "Because any fresh unnecessary expences just now, till Mr Harrel actually  receives the money he talks of—" "Why, my dear, the expence of such a thing as this is nothing; in Mr Harrel's  affairs I assure you it will not be at all felt. Besides, he expects money so  soon, that it is just the same as if he had it already." Cecilia, unwilling to be too officious, began then to express her admiration of  the goodness and generosity of Mr Arnott; taking frequent occasion, in the  course of her praise, to insinuate that those only can be properly liberal, who  are just and economical. She had prepared no masquerade habit for this evening, as Mrs Harrel, by whose  direction she was guided, informed her it was not necessary for ladies to be  masked at home, and said she should receive her company herself in a dress  which she might wear upon any other occasion. Mr Harrel, also, and Mr Arnott  made not any alteration in their appearance. At about eight o'clock the business of the evening began; and before nine,  there were so many masks that Cecilia wished she had herself made one of the  number, as she was far more conspicuous in being almost the only female in a  common dress, than any masquerade habit could have made her. The novelty of the  scene, however, joined to the general air of gaiety diffused throughout the  company, shortly lessened her embarrassment; and, after being somewhat  familiarized to the abruptness with which the masks approached her, and the  freedom with which they looked at or addressed her, the first confusion of her  situation subsided, and in her curiosity to watch others, she ceased to observe  how much she was watched herself. Her expectations of entertainment were not only fulfilled but surpassed; the  variety of dresses, the medley of characters, the quick succession of figures,  and the ludicrous mixture of groups, kept her attention unwearied: while the  conceited efforts at wit, the total thoughtlessness of consistency, and the  ridiculous incongruity of the language with the appearance, were incitements to  surprise and diversion without end. Even the local cant of, Do you know me? Who  are you? and I know you; with the sly pointing of the finger, the arch nod of  the head, and the pert squeak of the voice, though wearisome to those who  frequent such assemblies, were, to her unhackneyed observation, additional  subjects of amusement. Soon after nine o'clock, every room was occupied, and the common crowd of  regular masqueraders were dispersed through the various apartments. Dominos of  no character, and fancy dresses of no meaning, made, as is usual at such  meetings, the general herd of the company: for the rest, the men were  Spaniards, chimney-sweepers, Turks, watchmen, conjurers, and old women; and the  ladies, shepherdesses, orange girls, Circassians, gipseys, haymakers, and  sultanas. Cecilia had, as yet, escaped any address beyond the customary enquiry of Do you  know me? and a few passing compliments; but when the rooms filled, and the  general crowd gave general courage, she was attacked in a manner more pointed  and singular. The very first mask who approached her seemed to have nothing less in view than  preventing the approach of every other: yet had he little reason to hope favour  for himself, as the person he represented, of all others least alluring to the  view, was the devil! He was black from head to foot, save that two red horns  seemed to issue from his forehead; his face was so completely covered that the  sight only of his eyes was visible, his feet were cloven, and in his right hand  he held a wand the colour of fire. Waving this wand as he advanced towards Cecilia, he cleared a semi-circular  space before her chair, thrice with the most profound reverence bowed to her,  thrice turned himself around with sundry grimaces, and then fiercely planted  himself at her side. Cecilia was amused by his mummery, but felt no great delight in his  guardianship, and, after a short time, arose, with intention to walk to another  place; but the black gentleman, adroitly moving round her, held out his wand to  obstruct her passage, and therefore, preferring captivity to resistance, she  was again obliged to seat herself. An Hotspur, who just then made his appearance, was now strutting boldly towards  her; but the devil, rushing furiously forwards, placed himself immediately  between them. Hotspur, putting his arms a-kimbo with an air of defiance, gave a  loud stamp with his right foot, and then—marched into another room! The victorious devil ostentatiously waved his wand, and returned to his station. Mr Arnott, who had never moved two yards from Cecilia, knowing her too well to  suppose she received any pleasure from being thus distinguished, modestly  advanced to offer his assistance in releasing her from confinement; but the  devil, again describing a circle with his wand, gave him three such smart raps  on the head that his hair was disordered, and his face covered with powder. A  general laugh succeeded, and Mr Arnott, too diffident to brave raillery, or  withstand shame, retired in confusion. The black gentleman seemed now to have all authority in his own hands, and his  wand was brandished with more ferocity than ever, no one again venturing to  invade the domain he thought fit to appropriate for his own. At length, however, a Don Quixote appeared, and every mask in the room was  eager to point out to him the imprisonment of Cecilia. This Don Quixote was accoutered with tolerable exactness according to the  description of the admirable Cervantes; his armour was rusty, his helmet was a  barber's basin, his shield, a pewter dish, and his lance, an old sword fastened  to a slim cane. His figure, tall and thin, was well adapted to the character he  represented, and his mask, which depictured a lean and haggard face, worn with  care, yet fiery with crazy passions, exhibited, with propriety the most  striking, the knight of the doleful countenance. The complaints against the devil with which immediately and from all quarters  he was assailed, he heard with the most solemn taciturnity: after which, making  a motion for general silence, he stalked majestically towards Cecilia, but  stopping short of the limits prescribed by her guard, he kissed his spear in  token of allegiance, and then, slowly dropping upon one knee, began the  following address: "Most incomparable Princess!—Thus humbly prostrate at the feet of your divine  and ineffable beauty, graciously permit the most pitiful of your servitors, Don  Quixote De la Mancha, from your high and tender grace, to salute the fair  boards which sustain your corporeal machine." Then, bending down his head, he kissed the floor; after which, raising himself  upon his feet, he proceeded in his speech. "Report, O most fair and unmatchable virgin! daringly affirmeth that a certain  discourteous person, who calleth himself the devil, even now, and in thwart of  your fair inclinations, keepeth and detaineth your irradiant frame in hostile  thraldom. Suffer then, magnanimous and undescribable lady! that I, the most  groveling of your unworthy vassals, do sift the fair truth out of this foul  sieve, and obsequiously bending to your divine attractions, conjure your  highness veritably to inform me, if that honourable chair which haply supports  your terrestrial perfections, containeth the inimitable burthen with the free  and legal consent of your celestial spirit?" Here he ceased: and Cecilia, who laughed at this characteristic address, though  she had not courage to answer it, again made an effort to quit her place, but  again by the wand of her black persecutor was prevented. This little incident was answer sufficient for the valorous knight, who  indignantly exclaimed, "Sublime Lady!—I beseech but of your exquisite mercy to refrain mouldering  the clay composition of my unworthy body to impalpable dust, by the refulgence  of those bright stars vulgarly called eyes, till I have lawfully wreaked my  vengeance upon this unobliging caitiff, for his most disloyal obstruction of  your highness's adorable pleasure." Then, bowing low, he turned from her, and thus addressed his intended  antagonist: "Uncourtly Miscreant,—The black garment which envellopeth thy most unpleasant  person, seemeth even of the most ravishing whiteness, in compare of the black  bile which floateth within thy sable interior. Behold, then, my gauntlet! yet  ere I deign to be the instrument of thy extirpation, O thou most mean and  ignoble enemy! that the honour of Don Quixote De la Mancha may not be sullied  by thy extinction, I do here confer upon thee the honour of knighthood, dubbing  thee, by my own sword, Don Devil, knight of the horrible physiognomy." He then attempted to strike his shoulder with his spear, but the black  gentleman, adroitly eluding the blow, defended himself with his wand: a mock  fight ensued, conducted on both sides with admirable dexterity; but Cecilia,  less eager to view it than to become again a free agent, made her escape into  another apartment; while the rest of the ladies, though they almost all  screamed, jumped upon chairs and sofas to peep at the combat. In conclusion, the wand of the knight of the horrible physiognomy was broken  against the shield of the knight of the doleful countenance; upon which Don  Quixote called out victoria! the whole room echoed the sound; the unfortunate  new knight retired abruptly into another apartment, and the conquering Don,  seizing the fragments of the weapon of his vanquished enemy went out in search  of the lady for whose releasement he had fought: and the moment he found her,  prostrating both himself and the trophies at her feet, he again pressed the  floor with his lips, and then, slowly arising, repeated his reverences with  added formality, and, without waiting her acknowledgments, gravely retired. The moment he departed a Minerva, not stately nor austere, not marching in  warlike majesty, but gay and airy,    "Tripping on light fantastic toe," ran up to Cecilia, and squeaked out, "Do you know me?" "Not," answered she, instantly recollecting Miss Larolles, "by your appearance,  I own! but by your voice, I think I can guess you." "I was monstrous sorry," returned the goddess, without understanding this  distinction, "that I was not at home when you called upon me. Pray, how do you  like my dress? I assure you I think it's the prettiest here. But do you know  there's the most shocking thing in the world happened in the next room! I  really believe there's a common chimney-sweeper got in! I assure you it's  enough to frighten one to death, for every time he moves the soot smells so you  can't think; quite real soot, I assure you! only conceive how nasty! I declare  I wish with all my heart it would suffocate him!" Here she was interrupted by the re-appearance of Don Devil; who, looking around  him, and perceiving that his antagonist was gone, again advanced to Cecilia:  not, however, with the authority of his first approach, for with his wand he  had lost much of his power; but to recompense himself for this disgrace, he had  recourse to another method equally effectual for keeping his prey to himself,  for he began a growling, so dismal and disagreeable, that while many of the  ladies, and, among the first, the Goddess of Wisdom and Courage, ran away to  avoid him, the men all stood aloof to watch what next was to follow. Cecilia now became seriously uneasy; for she was made an object of general  attention, yet could neither speak nor be spoken to. She could suggest no  motive for behaviour so whimsical, though she imagined the only person who  could have the assurance to practise it was Sir Robert Floyer. After some time spent thus disagreeably, a white domino, who for a few minutes  had been a very attentive spectator, suddenly came forward, and exclaiming,  "I'll cross him though he blast me!" rushed upon the fiend, and grasping one of  his horns, called out to a Harlequin who stood near him, "Harlequin! do you  fear to fight the devil?" "Not I truly!" answered Harlequin, whose voice immediately betrayed young  Morrice, and who, issuing from the crowd, whirled himself round before the  black gentleman with yet more agility than he had himself done before Cecilia,  giving him, from time to time, many smart blows on his shoulders, head, and  back, with his wooden sword. The rage of Don Devil at this attack seemed somewhat beyond what a masquerade  character rendered necessary; he foamed at the mouth with resentment, and  defended himself with so much vehemence, that he soon drove poor Harlequin into  another room: but, when he would have returned to his prey, the genius of  pantomime, curbed, but not subdued, at the instigation of the white domino,  returned to the charge, and by a perpetual rotation of attack and retreat, kept  him in constant employment, pursuing him from room to room, and teazing him  without cessation or mercy. Mean time Cecilia, delighted at being released, hurried into a corner, where  she hoped to breathe and look on in quiet; and the white domino having exhorted  Harlequin to torment the tormentor, and keep him at bay, followed her with  congratulations upon her recovered freedom. "It is you," answered she, "I ought to thank for it, which indeed I do most  heartily. I was so tired of confinement, that my mind seemed almost as little  at liberty as my person." "Your persecutor, I presume," said the domino, "is known to you." "I hope so," answered she, "because there is one man I suspect, and I should be  sorry to find there was another equally disagreeable." "O, depend upon it," cried he, "there are many who would be happy to confine  you in the same manner; neither have you much cause for complaint; you have,  doubtless, been the aggressor, and played this game yourself without mercy, for  I read in your face the captivity of thousands: have you, then, any right to be  offended at the spirit of retaliation which one, out of such numbers has  courage to exert in return?" "I protest," cried Cecilia, "I took you for my defender! whence is it you are  become my accuser?" "From seeing the danger to which my incautious knight-errantry has exposed me;  I begin, indeed, to take you for a very mischievous sort of person, and I fear  the poor devil from whom I rescued you will be amply revenged for his disgrace,  by finding that the first use you make of your freedom is to doom your  deliverer to bondage." Here they were disturbed by the extreme loquacity of two opposite parties: and  listening attentively, they heard from one side, "My angel! fairest of  creatures! goddess of my heart!" uttered in accents of rapture; while from the  other, the vociferation was so violent they could distinctly hear nothing. The white domino satisfied his curiosity by going to both parties; and then,  returning to Cecilia, said, "Can you conjecture who was making those soft  speeches? a Shylock! his knife all the while in his hand, and his design,  doubtless, to cut as near the heart as possible! while the loud cackling from  the other side is owing to the riotous merriment of a noisy Mentor! when next I  hear a disturbance, I shall expect to see some simpering Pythagoras stunned by  his talkative disciples." "To own the truth," said Cecilia, "the almost universal neglect of the  characters assumed by these masquers has been the chief source of my  entertainment this evening: for at a place of this sort, the next best thing to  a character well supported is a character ridiculously burlesqued." "You cannot, then, have wanted amusement," returned the domino, "for among all  the persons assembled in these apartments, I have seen only three who have  seemed conscious that any change but that of dress was necessary to disguise  them." "And pray who are those?" "A Don Quixote, a schoolmaster, and your friend the devil." "O, call him not my friend," exclaimed Cecilia, "for indeed in or out of that  garb he is particularly my aversion." "My friend, then, I will call him," said the domino, "for so, were he ten  devils, I must think him, since I owe to him the honour of conversing with you.  And, after all, to give him his due, to which, you know, he is even  proverbially entitled, he has shewn such abilities in the performance of his  part, so much skill in the display of malice, and so much perseverance in the  art of tormenting, that I cannot but respect his ingenuity and capacity. And,  indeed, if instead of an evil genius, he had represented a guardian angel, he  could not have shewn a more refined taste in his choice of an object to hover  about." Just then they were approached by a young haymaker, to whom the white domino  called out, "You look as gay and as brisk as if fresh from the hay-field after  only half a day's work. Pray, how is it you pretty lasses find employment for  the winter?" "How?" cried she, pertly, "why, the same as for the summer!" And pleased with  her own readiness at repartee, without feeling the ignorance it betrayed, she  tript lightly on. Immediately after the schoolmaster mentioned by the white domino advanced to  Cecilia. His dress was merely a long wrapping gown of green stuff, a pair of  red slippers, and a woollen night-cap of the same colour; while, as the symbol  of his profession, he held a rod in his hand. "Ah, fair lady," he cried, "how soothing were it to the austerity of my life,  how softening to the rigidity of my manners, might I—without a breaking out  of bounds, which I ought to be the first to discourage, and a "confusion to all  order" for which the school-boy should himself chastise his master—be  permitted to cast at your feet this emblem of my authority! and to forget, in  the softness of your conversation, all the roughness of discipline!" "No, no," cried Cecilia, "I will not be answerable for such corruption of  taste!" "This repulse," answered he, "is just what I feared; for alas! under what  pretence could a poor miserable country pedagogue presume to approach you?  Should I examine you in the dead languages, would not your living accents charm  from me all power of reproof? Could I look at you, and hear a false concord?  Should I doom you to water-gruel as a dunce, would not my subsequent remorse  make me want it myself as a madman? Were your fair hand spread out to me for  correction, should I help applying my lips to it, instead of my rat-tan? If I  ordered you to be called up, should I ever remember to have you sent back? And  if I commanded you to stand in a corner, how should I forbear following you  thither myself?" Cecilia, who had no difficulty in knowing this pretended schoolmaster for Mr  Gosport, was readily beginning to propose conditions for according him her  favour, when their ears were assailed by a forced phthisical cough, which they  found proceeded from an apparent old woman, who was a young man in disguise,  and whose hobbling gait, grunting voice, and most grievous asthmatic  complaints, seemed greatly enjoyed and applauded by the company. "How true is it, yet how inconsistent," cried the white domino, "that while we  all desire to live long, we have all a horror of being old! The figure now  passing is not meant to ridicule any particular person, nor to stigmatize any  particular absurdity; its sole view is to expose to contempt and derision the  general and natural infirmities of age! and the design is not more disgusting  than impolitic; for why, while so carefully we guard from all approaches of  death, should we close the only avenues to happiness in long life, respect and  tenderness?" Cecilia, delighted both by the understanding and humanity of her new  acquaintance, and pleased at being joined by Mr Gosport, was beginning to be  perfectly satisfied with her situation, when, creeping softly towards her, she  again perceived the black gentleman. "Ah!" cried she, with some vexation, "here comes my old tormentor! screen me  from him if possible, or he will again make me his prisoner." "Fear not," cried the white domino, "he is an evil spirit, and we will surely  lay him. If one spell fails, we must try another." Cecilia then perceiving Mr Arnott, begged he would also assist in barricading  her from the fiend who so obstinately pursued her. Mr Arnott most gratefully acceded to the proposal; and the white domino, who  acted as commanding officer, assigned to each his station: he desired Cecilia  would keep quietly to her seat, appointed the schoolmaster to be her guard on  the left, took possession himself of the opposite post, and ordered Mr Arnott  to stand centinel in front. This arrangement being settled, the guards of the right and left wings  instantly secured their places; but while Mr Arnott was considering whether it  were better to face the besieged or the enemy, the arch-foe rushed suddenly  before him, and laid himself down at the feet of Cecilia! Mr Arnott, extremely disconcerted, began a serious expostulation upon the  ill-breeding of this behaviour; but the devil, resting all excuse upon  supporting his character, only answered by growling. The white domino seemed to hesitate for a moment in what manner to conduct  himself, and with a quickness that marked his chagrin, said to Cecilia, "You  told me you knew him,—has he any right to follow you?" "If he thinks he has," answered she, a little alarmed by his question, "this is  no time to dispute it." And then, to avoid any hazard of altercation, she discreetly forbore making  further complaints, preferring any persecution to seriously remonstrating with  a man of so much insolence as the Baronet. The schoolmaster, laughing at the whole transaction, only said, "And pray,  madam, after playing the devil with all mankind, what right have you to  complain that one man plays the devil with you?" "We shall, at least, fortify you," said the white domino, "from any other  assailant: no three-headed Cerberus could protect you more effectually: but you  will not, therefore, fancy yourself in the lower regions, for, if I mistake  not, the torment of three guardians is nothing new to you." "And how," said Cecilia, surprised, "should you know of my three guardians? I  hope I am not quite encompassed with evil spirits!" "No," answered he; "you will find me as inoffensive as the hue of the domino I  wear;——and would I could add as insensible!" "This black gentleman," said the schoolmaster, "who, and very innocently, I was  going to call your black-guard, has as noble and fiend-like a disposition as I  remember to have seen; for without even attempting to take any diversion  himself, he seems gratified to his heart's content in excluding from it the  lady he serves." "He does me an honour I could well dispense with," said Cecilia; "but I hope he  has some secret satisfaction in his situation which pays him for its apparent  inconvenience." Here the black gentleman half-raised himself, and attempted to take her hand.  She started, and with much displeasure drew it back. He then growled, and again  sank prostrate. "This is a fiend," said the schoolmaster, "who to himself sayeth, Budge not!  let his conscience never so often say budge! Well, fair lady, your  fortifications, however, may now be deemed impregnable, since I, with a  flourish of my rod, can keep off the young by recollection of the past, and  since the fiend, with a jut of his foot, may keep off the old from dread of the  future!" Here a Turk, richly habited and resplendent with jewels, stalked towards  Cecilia, and, having regarded her some time, called out, "I have been looking  hard about me the whole evening, and, faith, I have seen nothing handsome  before!" The moment he opened his mouth, his voice, to her utter astonishment, betrayed  Sir Robert Floyer! "Mercy on me," cried she aloud, and pointing to the fiend,  "who, then, can this possibly be?" "Do you not know?" cried the white domino. "I thought I had known with certainty," answered she, "but I now find I was  mistaken." "He is a happy man," said the schoolmaster, sarcastically looking at the Turk,  "who has removed your suspicions only by appearing in another character!" "Why, what the deuce, then," exclaimed the Turk, "have you taken that black dog  there for me?" Before this question could be answered, an offensive smell of soot, making  everybody look around the room, the chimney-sweeper already mentioned by Miss  Larolles was perceived to enter it. Every way he moved a passage was cleared  for him, as the company, with general disgust, retreated wherever he advanced. He was short, and seemed somewhat incommoded by his dress; he held his soot-bag  over one arm, and his shovel under the other. As soon as he espied Cecilia,  whose situation was such as to prevent her eluding him, he hooted aloud, and  came stumping up to her; "Ah ha," he cried, "found at last;" then, throwing  down his shovel, he opened the mouth of his bag, and pointing waggishly to her  head, said, "Come, shall I pop you?—a good place for naughty girls; in, I  say, poke in!—cram you up the chimney." And then he put forth his sooty hands to reach her cap. Cecilia, though she instantly knew the dialect of her guardian Mr Briggs, was  not therefore the more willing to be so handled, and started back to save  herself from his touch; the white domino also came forward, and spread out his  arms as a defence to her, while the devil, who was still before her, again  began to growl. "Ah ha!" cried the chimney-sweeper, laughing, "so did not know me? Poor duck!  won't hurt you; don't be frightened; nothing but old guardian; all a joke!" And  then, patting her cheek with his dirty hand, and nodding at her with much  kindness, "Pretty dove," he added, "be of good heart! shan't be meddled with;  come to see after you. Heard of your tricks; thought I'd catch you!—come o'  purpose.—Poor duck! did not know me! ha! ha!—good joke enough!" "What do you mean, you dirty dog," cried the Turk, "by touching that lady?" "Won't tell!" answered he; "not your business. Got a good right. Who cares for  pearls? Nothing but French beads." Pointing with a sneer to his turban. Then,  again addressing Cecilia, "Fine doings!" he continued, "Here's a place! never  saw the like before! turn a man's noddle!—All goings out; no comings in; wax  candles in every room; servants thick as mushrooms! And where's the cash? Who's  to pay the piper? Come to more than a guinea; warrant Master Harrel thinks that  nothing!" "A guinea?" contemptuously repeated the Turk, "and what do you suppose a guinea  will do?" "What? Why, keep a whole family handsome a week;—never spend so much myself;  no, nor half neither." "Why then, how the devil do you live? Do you beg?" "Beg? Who should I beg of? You?—Got anything to give? Are warm?" "Take the trouble to speak more respectfully, sir!" said the Turk, haughtily;  "I see you are some low fellow, and I shall not put up with your impudence." "Shall, shall! I say!" answered the chimneysweeper, sturdily; "Hark'ee, my  duck," chucking Cecilia under the chin, "don't be cajoled, nick that spark!  never mind gold trappings; none of his own; all a take-in; hired for  eighteenpence; not worth a groat. Never set your heart on a fine outside,  nothing within. Bristol stones won't buy stock: only wants to chouse you." "What do you mean by that, you little old scrub!" cried the imperious Turk;  "would you provoke me to soil my fingers by pulling that beastly snub nose?"  For Mr Briggs had saved himself any actual mask, by merely blacking his face  with soot. "Beastly snub nose!" sputtered out the chimneysweeper in much wrath, "good nose  enough; don't want a better; good as another man's. Where's the harm on't?" "How could this blackguard get in?" cried the Turk, "I believe he's a mere  common chimneysweeper out of the streets, for he's all over dirt and filth. I  never saw such a dress at a masquerade before in my life." "All the better," returned the other; "would not change. What do think it cost?" "Cost? Why, not a crown." "A crown? ha! ha!—a pot o' beer! Little Tom borrowed it; had it of our own  sweep. Said 'twas for himself. I bid him a pint; rascal would not take less." "Did your late uncle," said the white domino in a low voice to Cecilia, "chuse  for two of your guardians Mr Harrel and Mr Briggs, to give you an early lesson  upon the opposite errors of profusion and meanness?" "My uncle?" cried Cecilia, starting, "were you acquainted with my uncle?" "No," said he, "for my happiness I knew him not." "You would have owed no loss of happiness to an acquaintance with him," said  Cecilia, very seriously, "for he was one who dispensed to his friends nothing  but good." "Perhaps so," said the domino; "but I fear I should have found the good he  dispensed through his niece not quite unmixed with evil!" "What's here?" cried the chimney-sweeper, stumbling over the fiend, "what's  this black thing? Don't like it; looks like the devil. You shan't stay with it;  carry you away; take care of you myself." He then offered Cecilia his hand; but the black gentleman, raising himself upon  his knees before her, paid her, in dumb shew, the humblest devoirs, yet  prevented her from removing. "Ah ha!" cried the chimney-sweeper, significantly nodding his head, "smell a  rat! a sweetheart in disguise. No bamboozling! it won't do; a'n't so soon put  upon. If you've got any thing to say, tell me, that's the way. Where's the  cash? Got ever a rental? Are warm? That's the point; are warm?" The fiend, without returning any answer, continued his homage to Cecilia; at  which the enraged chimney-sweeper exclaimed, "Come, come with me! won't be  imposed upon; an old fox,—understand trap!" He then again held out his hand, but Cecilia, pointing to the fiend, answered,  "How can I come, sir?" "Shew you the way," cried he, "shovel him off." And taking his shovel, he very  roughly set about removing him. The fiend then began a yell so horrid, that it disturbed the whole company; but  the chimney-sweeper, only saying, "Aye, aye, blacky, growl away,  blacky,—makes no odds," sturdily continued his work, and, as the fiend had no  chance of resisting so coarse an antagonist without a serious struggle, he was  presently compelled to change his ground. "Warm work!" cried the victorious chimney-sweeper, taking off his wig, and  wiping his head with the sleeves of his dress, "pure warm work this!" Cecilia, once again freed from her persecutor, instantly quitted her place,  almost equally desirous to escape the haughty Turk, who was peculiarly her  aversion, and the facetious chimney-sweeper, whose vicinity, either on account  of his dress or his conversation, was by no means desirable. She was not,  however, displeased that the white domino and the schoolmaster still continued  to attend her. "Pray, look," said the white domino, as they entered another apartment, "at  that figure of Hope; is there any in the room half so expressive of  despondency?" "The reason, however," answered the schoolmaster, "is obvious; that light and  beautiful silver anchor upon which she reclines presents an occasion  irresistible for an attitude of elegant dejection; and the assumed character is  always given up where an opportunity offers to display any beauty, or manifest  any perfection in the dear proper person!" "But why," said Cecilia, "should she assume the character of Hope? Could she  not have been equally dejected and equally elegant as Niobe, or some tragedy  queen?" "But she does not assume the character," answered the schoolmaster, "she does  not even think of it: the dress is her object, and that alone fills up all her  ideas. Enquire of almost any body in the room concerning the persons they seem  to represent, and you will find their ignorance more gross than you can  imagine; they have not once thought upon the subject; accident, or convenience,  or caprice has alone directed their choice." A tall and elegant youth now approached them, whose laurels and harp announced  Apollo. The white domino immediately enquired of him if the noise and  turbulence of the company had any chance of being stilled into silence and  rapture by the divine music of the inspired god? "No," answered he, pointing to the room in which was erected the new gallery,  and whence, as he spoke, issued the sound of a hautboy, "there is a flute  playing there already." "O for a Midas," cried the white domino, "to return to this leather-eared god  the disgrace he received from him!" They now proceeded to the apartment which had been lately fitted up for  refreshments, and which was so full of company that they entered it with  difficulty. And here they were again joined by Minerva, who, taking Cecilia's  hand, said, "Lord, how glad I am you've got away from that frightful black  mask! I can't conceive who he is; nobody can find out; it's monstrous odd, but  he has not spoke a word all night, and he makes such a shocking noise when  people touch him, that I assure you it's enough to put one in a fright." "And pray," cried the schoolmaster, disguising his voice, "how camest thou to  take the helmet of Minerva for a fool's cap?" "Lord, I have not," cried she, innocently, "why, the whole dress is Minerva's;  don't you see?" "My dear child," answered he, "thou couldst as well with that little figure  pass for a Goliath, as with that little wit for a Pallas." Their attention was now drawn from the goddess of wisdom to a mad Edgar, who so  vehemently ran about the room calling out "Poor Tom's a cold!" that, in a short  time, he was obliged to take off his mask, from an effect, not very delicate,  of the heat! Soon after, a gentleman desiring some lemonade whose toga spoke the consular  dignity, though his broken English betrayed a native of France, the  schoolmaster followed him, and, with reverence the most profound, began to  address him in Latin; but, turning quick towards him, he gaily said, "Monsieur,  j'ai l'honneur de representer Ciceron, le grand Ciceron, pere de sa patrie!  mais quoique j'ai cet honneur-la, je ne suit pas pedant!—mon dieu, Monsieur,  je ne parle que le Francois dans la bonne compagnie!" And, politely bowing, he  went on. Just then Cecilia, while looking about the room for Mrs Harrel, found herself  suddenly pinched by the cheek, and hastily turning round, perceived again her  friend the chimney-sweeper, who, laughing, cried, "Only me! don't be  frightened. Have something to tell you;—had no luck!—got never a husband  yet! can't find one! looked all over, too; sharp as a needle. Not one to be  had! all catched up!" "I am glad to hear it, sir," said Cecilia, somewhat vexed by observing the  white domino attentively listening; "and I hope, therefore, you will give  yourself no farther trouble." "Pretty duck!" cried he, chucking her under the chin; "never mind, don't be  cast down; get one at last. Leave it to me. Nothing under a plum; won't take up  with less. Good-by, ducky, good-by! must go home now,—begin to be nodding." And then, repeating his kind caresses, he walked away. "Do you think, then," said the white domino, "more highly of Mr Briggs for  discernment and taste than of any body?" "I hope not!" answered she, "for low indeed should I then think of the rest of  the world!" "The commission with which he is charged," returned the domino, "has then  misled me; I imagined discernment and taste might be necessary ingredients for  making such a choice as your approbation would sanctify: but perhaps his skill  in guarding against any fraud or deduction in the stipulation he mentioned, may  be all that is requisite for the execution of his trust." "I understand very well," said Cecilia, a little hurt, "the severity of your  meaning; and if Mr Briggs had any commission but of his own suggestion, it  would fill me with shame and confusion; but as that is not the case, those at  least are sensations which it cannot give me." "My meaning," cried the domino, with some earnestness, "should I express it  seriously, would but prove to you the respect and admiration with which you  have inspired me, and if indeed, as Mr Briggs hinted, such a prize is to be  purchased by riches, I know not, from what I have seen of its merit, any sum I  should think adequate to its value." "You are determined, I see," said Cecilia, smiling, "to make most liberal  amends for your asperity." A loud clack of tongues now interrupted their discourse; and the domino, at the  desire of Cecilia, for whom he had procured a seat, went forward to enquire  what was the matter. But scarce had he given up his place a moment, before, to  her great mortification, it was occupied by the fiend. Again, but with the same determined silence he had hitherto preserved, he made  signs of obedience and homage, and her perplexity to conjecture who he could  be, or what were his motives for this persecution, became the more urgent as  they seemed the less likely to be satisfied. But the fiend, who was no other  than Mr Monckton, had every instant less and less encouragement to make himself  known: his plan had in nothing succeeded, and his provocation at its failure  had caused him the bitterest disappointment; he had intended, in the character  of a tormentor, not only to pursue and hover around her himself, but he had  also hoped, in the same character, to have kept at a distance all other  admirers: but the violence with which he had over-acted his part, by raising  her disgust and the indignation of the company, rendered his views wholly  abortive while the consciousness of an extravagance for which, if discovered,  he could assign no reason not liable to excite suspicions of his secret  motives, reduced him to guarding a painful and most irksome silence the whole  evening. And Cecilia, to whose unsuspicious mind the idea of Mr Monckton had  never occurred, added continually to the cruelty of his situation, by an  undisguised abhorrence of his assiduity, as well as by a manifest preference to  the attendance of the white domino. All, therefore, that his disappointed  scheme now left in his power, was to watch her motions, listen to her  discourse, and inflict occasionally upon others some part of the chagrin with  which he was tormented himself. While they were in this situation, Harlequin, in consequence of being ridiculed  by the Turk for want of agility, offered to jump over the new desert table, and  desired to have a little space cleared to give room for his motions. It was in  vain the people who distributed the refreshments, and who were placed at the  other side of the table, expostulated upon the danger of the experiment;  Morrice had a rage of enterprise untameable, and, therefore, first taking a  run, he attempted the leap. The consequence was such as might naturally be expected; he could not  accomplish his purpose, but, finding himself falling, imprudently caught hold  of the lately erected Awning, and pulled it entirely upon his own head, and  with it the new contrived lights, which, in various forms, were fixed to it,  and which all came down together. The mischief and confusion occasioned by this exploit were very alarming, and  almost dangerous; those who were near the table suffered most by the crush, but  splinters of the glass flew yet further; and as the room, which was small, had  been only lighted up by lamps hanging from the Awning, it was now in total  darkness, except close to the door, which was still illuminated from the  adjoining apartments. The clamour of Harlequin, who was covered with glass, papier-machee, lamps and  oil, the screams of the ladies, the universal buz of tongues, and the struggle  between the frighted crowd which was enclosed to get out, and the curious crowd  from the other apartments to get in, occasioned a disturbance and tumult  equally noisy and confused. But the most serious sufferer was the unfortunate  fiend, who, being nearer the table than Cecilia, was so pressed upon by the  numbers which poured from it, that he found a separation unavoidable, and was  unable, from the darkness and the throng, to discover whether she was still in  the same place, or had made her escape into another. She had, however, encountered the white domino, and, under his protection, was  safely conveyed to a further part of the room. Her intention and desire were to  quit it immediately, but at the remonstrance of her conductor, she consented to  remain some time longer. "The conflict at the door," said he, "will quite  overpower you. Stay here but a few minutes, and both parties will have  struggled themselves tired, and you may then go without difficulty. Meantime,  can you not, by this faint light, suppose me one of your guardians, Mr Briggs,  for example, or, if he is too old for me, Mr Harrel, and entrust yourself to my  care?" "You seem wonderfully well acquainted with my guardians," said Cecilia; "I  cannot imagine how you have had your intelligence." "Nor can I," answered the domino, "imagine how Mr Briggs became so particularly  your favourite as to be entrusted with powers to dispose of you." "You are mistaken indeed; he is entrusted with no powers but such as his own  fancy has suggested." "But how has Mr Delvile offended you, that with him only you seem to have no  commerce or communication?" "Mr Delvile!" repeated Cecilia, still more surprised, "are you also acquainted  with Mr Delvile?" "He is certainly a man of fashion," continued the domino, "and he is also a man  of honour; surely, then, he would be more pleasant for confidence and  consultation than one whose only notion of happiness is money, whose only idea  of excellence is avarice, and whose only conception of sense is distrust!" Here  a violent outcry again interrupted their conversation; but not till Cecilia had  satisfied her doubts concerning the white domino, by conjecturing he was Mr  Belfield, who might easily, at the house of Mr Monckton, have gathered the  little circumstances of her situation to which he alluded, and whose size and  figure exactly resembled those of her new acquaintance. The author of the former disturbance was now the occasion of the present: the  fiend, having vainly traversed the room in search of Cecilia, stumbled  accidentally upon Harlequin, before he was freed from the relicks of his own  mischief; and unable to resist the temptation of opportunity and the impulse of  revenge, he gave vent to the wrath so often excited by the blunders,  forwardness, and tricks of Morrice, and inflicted upon him, with his own wooden  sword, which he seized for that purpose, a chastisement the most serious and  severe. Poor Harlequin, unable to imagine any reason for this violent attack, and  already cut with the glass, and bruised with the fall, spared not his lungs in  making known his disapprobation of such treatment: but the fiend, regardless  either of his complaints or his resistance, forbore not to belabour him till  compelled by the entrance of people with lights. And then, after artfully  playing sundry antics under pretence of still supporting his character, with a  motion too sudden for prevention, and too rapid for pursuit, he escaped out of  the room, and hurrying down stairs, threw himself into an hackney chair, which  conveyed him to a place where he privately changed his dress before he returned  home, bitterly repenting the experiment he had made, and conscious too late  that, had he appeared in a character he might have avowed, he could, without  impropriety, have attended Cecilia the whole evening. But such is deservedly  the frequent fate of cunning, which, while it plots surprise and detection of  others, commonly overshoots its mark, and ends in its own disgrace. The introduction of the lights now making manifest the confusion which the  frolic of Harlequin had occasioned, he was seized with such a dread of the  resentment of Mr Harrel, that, forgetting blows, bruises, and wounds, not one  of which were so frightful to him as reproof, he made the last exhibition of  his agility by an abrupt and hasty retreat. He had, however, no reason for apprehension, since, in every thing that  regarded expence, Mr Harrel had no feeling, and his lady had no thought. The rooms now began to empty very fast, but among the few masks yet remaining,  Cecilia again perceived Don Quixote; and while, in conjunction with the white  domino, she was allowing him the praise of having supported his character with  more uniform propriety than any other person in the assembly, she observed him  taking off his mask for the convenience of drinking some lemonade, and, looking  in his face, found he was no other than Mr Belfield! Much astonished, and more  than ever perplexed, she again turned to the white domino, who, seeing in her  countenance a surprise of which he knew not the reason, said, half-laughing,  "You think, perhaps, I shall never be gone? And indeed I am almost of the same  opinion; but what can I do? Instead of growing weary by the length of my stay,  my reluctance to shorten it increases with its duration; and all the methods I  take, whether by speaking to you or looking at you, with a view to be satiated,  only double my eagerness for looking and listening again! I must go, however;  and if I am happy, I may perhaps meet with you again,—though, if I am wise, I  shall never seek you more!" And then, with the last stragglers that reluctantly disappeared, he made his  exit, leaving Cecilia greatly pleased with his conversation and his manners,  but extremely perplexed to account for his knowledge of her affairs and  situation. The schoolmaster had already been gone some time. She was now earnestly pressed by the Harrels and Sir Robert, who still  remained, to send to a warehouse for a dress, and accompany them to the  Pantheon; but though she was not without some inclination to comply, in the  hope of further prolonging the entertainment of an evening from which she had  received much pleasure, she disliked the attendance of the Baronet, and felt  averse to grant any request that he could make, and therefore she begged they  would excuse her; and having waited to see their dresses, which were very  superb, she retired to her own apartment. A great variety of conjecture upon all that had passed, now, and till the  moment that she sunk to rest, occupied her mind; the extraordinary persecution  of the fiend excited at once her curiosity and amazement, while the knowledge  of her affairs shown by the white domino surprised her not less, and interested  her more.
