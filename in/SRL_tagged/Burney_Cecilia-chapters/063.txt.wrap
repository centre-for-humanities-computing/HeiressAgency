 Cecilia was accompanied by her maid in the chaise, and her own servant and one  of Mrs Delvile's attended her on horseback. The quietness of her dejection was soon interrupted by a loud cry among the men  of "home! home! home!" She then looked out of one of the windows, and perceived  Fidel, running after the carriage, and barking at the servants, who were all  endeavouring to send him back. Touched by this proof of the animal's gratitude for her attention to him, and  conscious she had herself occasioned his master's leaving him, the scheme of  Lady Honoria occurred to her, and she almost wished to put it in execution, but  this was the thought of a moment, and motioning him with her hand to go back,  she desired Mrs Delvile's man to return with him immediately, and commit him to  the care of somebody in the castle. This little incident, however trifling, was the most important of her journey,  for she arrived at the house of Mrs Charlton without meeting any other. The sight of that lady gave her a sensation of pleasure to which she had long  been a stranger, pleasure pure, unmixed, unaffected and unrestrained: it  revived all her early affection, and with it, something resembling at least her  early tranquility: again she was in the house where it had once been  undisturbed, again she enjoyed the society which was once all she had wished,  and again saw the same scene, the same faces, and same prospects she had beheld  while her heart was all devoted to her friends. Mrs Charlton, though old and infirm, preserved an understanding, which,  whenever unbiassed by her affections, was sure to direct her unerringly; but  the extreme softness of her temper frequently misled her judgment, by making  it, at the pleasure either of misfortune or of artifice, always yield to  compassion, and pliant to entreaty. Where her counsel and opinion were  demanded, they were certain to reflect honour on her capacity and discernment;  but where her assistance or her pity were supplicated, her purse and her tears  were immediately bestowed, and in her zeal to alleviate distress she forgot if  the object were deserving her solicitude, and stopt not to consider propriety  or discretion, if happiness, however momentary, were in her power to grant. This generous foible was, however, kept somewhat in subjection by the  watchfulness of two grand-daughters, who, fearing the injury they might  themselves receive from it, failed not to point out both its inconvenience and  its danger. These ladies were daughters of a deceased and only son of Mrs Charlton; they  were single, and lived with their grand-mother, whose fortune, which was  considerable, they expected to share between them, and they waited with  eagerness for the moment of appropriation; narrow-minded and rapacious, they  wished to monopolize whatever she possessed, and thought themselves aggrieved  by her smallest donations. Their chief employment was to keep from her all  objects of distress, and in this though they could not succeed, they at least  confined her liberality to such as resembled themselves; since neither the  spirited could brook, nor the delicate support the checks and rebuffs from the  granddaughters, which followed the gifts of Mrs Charlton. Cecilia, of all her  acquaintance, was the only one whose intimacy they encouraged, for they knew  her fortune made her superior to any mercenary views, and they received from  her themselves more civilities than they paid. Mrs Charlton loved Cecilia with an excess of fondness, that not only took place  of the love she bore her other friends, but to which even her regard for the  Miss Charltons was inferior and feeble. Cecilia when a child had reverenced her  as a mother, and, grateful for her tenderness and care, had afterwards  cherished her as a friend. The revival of this early connection delighted them  both, it was balm to the wounded mind of Cecilia, it was renovation to the  existence of Mrs Charlton. Early the next morning she wrote a card to Mr Monckton and Lady Margaret,  acquainting them with her return into Suffolk, and desiring to know when she  might pay her respects to her Ladyship. She received from the old lady a verbal  answer, when she pleased, but Mr Monckton came instantly himself to Mrs  Charlton's. His astonishment, his rapture at this unexpected incident were almost  boundless; he thought it a sudden turn of fortune in his own favour, and  concluded, now she had escaped the danger of Delvile Castle, the road was short  and certain that led to his own security. Her satisfaction in the meeting was as sincere, though not so animated as his  own: but this similarity in their feelings was of short duration, for when he  enquired into what had passed at the castle, with the reasons of her quitting  it, the pain she felt in giving even a cursory and evasive account, was opposed  on his part by the warmest delight in hearing it: he could not obtain from her  the particulars of what had happened, but the reluctance with which she spoke,  the air of mortification with which she heard his questions, and the evident  displeasure which was mingled in her chagrin, when he forced her to mention  Delvile, were all proofs the most indisputable and satisfactory, that they had  either parted without any explanation, or with one by which Cecilia had been  hurt and offended. He now readily concluded that since the fiery trial he had most apprehended was  over; and she had quitted in anger the asylum she had sought in extacy, Delvile  himself did not covet the alliance, which, since they were separated, was never  likely to take place. He had therefore little difficulty in promising all  success to himself. She was once more upon the spot where she had regarded him as the first of men,  he knew that during her absence no one had settled in the neighbourhood who had  any pretensions to dispute with him that pre-eminence, he should again have  access to her, at pleasure, and so sanguine grew his hopes, that he almost  began to rejoice even in the partiality to Delvile that had hitherto been his  terror, from believing it would give her for a time, that sullen distaste of  all other connections, to which those who at once are delicate and fervent are  commonly led by early disappointment. His whole solicitude therefore now was to  preserve her esteem, to seek her confidence, and to regain whatever by absence  might be lost of the [ascendancy] over her mind which her respect for his  knowledge and capacity had for many years given him. Fortune at this time  seemed to prosper all his views, and, by a stroke the most sudden and  unexpected, to render more rational his hopes and his plans than he had himself  been able to effect by the utmost craft of worldly wisdom. The day following Cecilia, in Mrs Charlton's chaise, waited upon Lady Margaret.  She was received by Miss Bennet, her companion, with the most fawning courtesy;  but when conducted to the lady of the house, she saw herself so evidently  unwelcome, that she even regretted the civility which had prompted her visit. She found with her nobody but Mr Morrice, who was the only young man that could  persuade himself to endure her company in the absence of her husband, but who,  in common with most young men who are assiduous in their attendance upon old  ladies, doubted not but he ensured himself a handsome legacy for his trouble. Almost the first speech which her ladyship made, was "So you are not married  yet, I find; if Mr Monckton had been a real friend, he would have taken care to  have seen for some establishment for you." "I was by no means," cried Cecilia, with spirit, "either in so much haste or  distress as to require from Mr Monckton any such exertion of his friendship." "Ma'am," cried Morrice, "what a terrible night we had of it at Vauxhall! poor  Harrel! I was really excessively sorry for him. I had not courage to see you or  Mrs Harrel after it. But as soon as I heard you were in St James's-square, I  tried to wait upon you; for really going to Mr Harrel's again would have been  quite too dismal. I would rather have run a mile by the side of a race-horse." "There is no occasion for any apology," said Cecilia, "for I was very little  disposed either to see or think of visitors." "So I thought, ma'am;" answered he, with quickness, "and really that made me  the less alert in finding you out. However, ma'am, next winter I shall be  excessively happy to make up for the deficiency; besides, I shall be much  obliged to you to introduce me to Mr Delvile, for I have a great desire to be  acquainted with him." Mr Delvile, thought Cecilia, would be but too proud to hear it! However, she  merely answered that she had no present prospect of spending any time at Mr.  Delvile's next winter. "True, ma'am, true," cried he, "now I recollect, you become your own mistress  between this and then; and so I suppose you will naturally chuse a house of  your own, which will be much more eligible." "I don't think that," said Lady Margaret, "I never saw anything eligible come  of young women's having houses of their own; she will do a much better thing to  marry, and have some proper person to take care of her." "Nothing more right, ma'am!" returned he; "a young lady in a house by herself  must be subject to a thousand dangers. What sort of place, ma'am, has Mr  Delvile got in the country? I hear he has a good deal of ground there, and a  large house." "It is an old castle, Sir, and situated in a park." "That must be terribly forlorn: I dare say, ma'am, you were very happy to  return into Suffolk." "I did not find it forlorn; I was very well satisfied with it." "Why, indeed, upon second thoughts, I don't much wonder; an old castle in a  large park must make a very romantic appearance; something noble in it, I dare  say." "Aye," cried Lady Margaret, "they said you were to become mistress of it, and  marry Mr Delvile's son and I cannot, for my own part, see any objection to it." "I am told of so many strange reports," said Cecilia, "and all, to myself so  unaccountable, that I begin now to hear of them without much wonder." "That's a charming young man, I believe," said Morrice; "I had the pleasure  once or twice of meeting him at poor Harrel's, and he seemed mighty agreeable.  Is not he so, ma'am?" "Yes,—I believe so." "Nay, I don't mean to speak of him as any thing very extraordinary," cried  Morrice, imagining her hesitation proceeded from dislike, "I merely meant as  the world goes,—in a common sort of a way." Here they were joined by Mr Monckton and some gentlemen who were on a visit at  his house; for his anxiety was not of a sort to lead him to solitude, nor his  disposition to make him deny himself any kind of enjoyment which he had power  to attain. A general conversation ensued, which lasted till Cecilia ended her  visit; Mr Monckton then took her hand to lead her to the chaise, but told her,  in their way out, of some alterations in his grounds, which he desired to shew  her: his view of detaining her was to gather what she thought of her reception,  and whether she had yet any suspicions of the jealousy of Lady Margaret; well  knowing, from the delicacy of her character, that if once she became acquainted  with it, she would scrupulously avoid all intercourse with him, from the fear  of encreasing her uneasiness. He began, therefore, with talking of the pleasure which Lady Margaret took in  the plantations, and of his hope that Cecilia would often favour her by  visiting them, without waiting to have her visits returned, as she was entitled  by her infirmities to particular indulgencies. He was continuing in this  strain, receiving from Cecilia hardly any answer, when suddenly from behind a  thick laurel bush, jumpt up Mr Morrice; who had run out of the house by a  shorter cut, and planted himself there to surprise them. "So ho!" cried he with a loud laugh, "I have caught you! This will be a fine  anecdote for Lady Margaret; I vow I'll tell her." Mr Monckton, never off his guard, readily answered "Aye, prithee do, Morrice;  but don't omit to relate also what we said of yourself." "Of me?" cried he, with some eagerness; "why you never mentioned me." "O that won't pass, I assure you; we shall tell another tale at table by and  by; and bring the old proverb of the ill luck of listeners upon you in its full  force." "Well, I'll be hanged if I know what you mean!" "Why you won't pretend you did not hear Miss Beverley say you were the truest  Ouran Outang, or man-monkey, she ever knew?" "No, indeed, that I did not! "No?—Nor how much she admired your dexterity in escaping being horse-whipt  three times a day for your incurable impudence?" "Not a word on't! Horse-whipt!—Miss Beverley, pray did you say any such  thing?" "Ay," cried Monckton, again, "and not only horse-whipt, but horse-ponded, for  she thought when, one had heated, the other might cool you; and then you might  be fitted again for your native woods, for she insists upon it you was brought  from Africa, and are not yet half tamed." "O Lord!" cried Morrice, amazed, "I should not have suspected Miss Beverley  would have talked so!" "And do you suspect she did now?" cried Cecilia. "Pho, pho," cried Monckton, coolly, "why he heard it himself the whole time!  and so shall all our party by and bye, if I can but remember to mention it." Cecilia then returned to the chaise, leaving Mr Monckton to settle the matter  with his credulous guest as he pleased; for supposing he was merely gratifying  a love of sport, or taking this method of checking the general forwardness of  the young man, she forbore any interference that might mar his intention. But  Mr Monckton loved not to be rallied concerning Cecilia, though he was  indifferent to all that could be said to him of any other woman; he meant,  therefore, to intimidate Morrice from renewing the subject; and he succeeded to  his wish; poor Morrice, whose watching and whose speech were the mere blunders  of chance, made without the slightest suspicion of Mr Monckton's designs, now  apprehended some scheme to render himself ridiculous, and though he did not  believe Cecilia had made use of such expressions, he fancied Mr Monckton meant  to turn the laugh against him, and determined, therefore, to say nothing that  might remind him of what had passed. Mr Monckton had at this time admitted him to his house merely from an  expectation of finding more amusement in his blundering and giddiness, than he  was capable, during his anxiety concerning Cecilia, of receiving from  conversation of an higher sort. The character of Morrice was, indeed,  particularly adapted for the entertainment of a large house in the country;  eager for sport, and always ready for enterprize; willing to oblige, yet  tormented with no delicacy about offending; the first to promote mischief for  any other, and the last to be offended when exposed to it himself; gay,  thoughtless, and volatile,-a happy composition of levity and good-humour. Cecilia, however, to quitting the house, determined not to visit it again very  speedily; for she was extremely disgusted with Lady Margaret, though she  suspected no particular motives of enmity, against which she was guarded alike  by her own unsuspicious innocence, and by an high esteem of Mr Monckton, which  she firmly believed he returned with equal honesty of undesigning friendship. Her next excursion was to visit Mrs Harrel; she found that unhappy lady a prey  to all the misery of unoccupied solitude: torn from whatever had, to her, made  existence seem valuable, her mind was as listless as her person was inactive,  and she was at a loss how to employ even a moment of the day: she had now  neither a party to form, nor an entertainment to plan, company to arrange, nor  dress to consider; and these, with visits and public places, had filled all her  time since her marriage, which, as it had 'happened very early in her life, had  merely taken place of girlish amusements, masters and governesses. This helplessness of insipidity, however, though naturally the effect of a mind  devoid of all genuine resources, was dignified by herself with the appellation  of sorrow: nor was this merely a screen to the world; unused to investigate her  feelings or examine her heart, the general compassion she met for the loss of  her husband, persuaded her that indeed she lamented his destiny; though had no  change in her life been caused by his suicide, she would scarcely, when the  first shock was over, have thought of it again. She received Cecilia with great pleasure; and with still greater, heard the  renewal of her promises to fit up a room for her in her house, as soon as she  came of age; a period which now was hardly a month distant. Far greater,  however, as well as infinitely purer, was 'the joy which her presence bestowed  upon Mr Arnott; she saw it herself with a sensation of regret, not only at the  constant passion which occasioned it, but even at her own inability to  participate in or reward it for with him an alliance would meet with no  opposition; his character was amiable, his situation in life unexceptionable:  he loved her with the tenderest affection, and no pride, she well knew, would  interfere to overpower it; yet, in return, to grant him her love, she felt as  utterly impossible as to refuse him her esteem: and the superior attractions of  Delvile, of which neither displeasure nor mortification could rob him, shut up  her heart, for the present, more firmly than ever, as Mr Monckton had well  imagined, to all other assailants. Yet she by no means weakly gave way to  repining or regret: her suspence was at an end, her hopes and her fears were  subsided into certainty; Delvile, in quitting her, had acquainted her that he  had left her for ever, and even, though not, indeed, with much steadiness, had  prayed for her happiness in union with some other; she held it therefore as  essential to her character as to her peace, to manifest equal fortitude in  subduing her partiality; she forbore to hint to Mrs Charlton what had passed,  that the subject might never be started; allowed herself no time for dangerous  recollection; strolled in her old walks, and renewed her old acquaintance, and  by a vigorous exertion of active wisdom, doubted not compleating, before long,  the subjection of her unfortunate tenderness. Nor was her task so difficult as  she had feared; resolution, in such cases, may act the office of time, and  anticipate by reason and self-denial, what that, much leas nobly, effects  through forgetfulness and inconstancy.
