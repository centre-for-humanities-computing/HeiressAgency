 The evening was already far advanced, and before she arrived at the end of she  little journey it was quite dark. When they came within a mile of Mr Arnott's  house, the postilion, in turning too suddenly from the turnpike to the  cross-road, overset the carriage. The accident, however, occasioned no other  mischief than delaying their proceeding, and Cecilia and Cecilia maid were helped  out of the chaise unhurt. The servants, assisted by a man who was walking upon  the road, began lifting it up; and Cecilia, too busy within to be attentive to  what passed without, disregarded what went forward, till Cecilia heard Cecilia footman  call for help. Cecilia then hastily advanced to enquire what was the matter, and  found that the passenger who had lent her footman   aid, had, by working in the dark,  unfortunately slipped her footman   foot under one of the wheels, and so much hurt it,  that without great pain her footman   could not put it to the ground. Cecilia immediately desired that the sufferer might be carried to the sufferer own home  in the chaise, while Cecilia and her maid walked on to Mr Arnott's, attended by Cecilia  servant on horseback. This little incident proved of singular service to Cecilia upon first entering the  house; Mrs Harrel was at supper with Mrs Harrel brother, and hearing the voice of  Cecilia in the hall, hastened with the extremest surprise to enquire what had  occasioned so late a visit; followed by Mr Arnott, whose amazement was  accompanied with a thousand other sensations too powerful for speech. Cecilia,  unprepared with any excuse, instantly related the adventure Cecilia had met with on  the road, which quieted their curiosity, by turning their attention to Cecilia  personal safety. their ordered a room to be prepared for Cecilia, entreated Cecilia to  go to rest with all speed, and postpone any further account till the next day.  With this request Cecilia most gladly complied, happy to be spared the  embarrassment of enquiry, and rejoiced to be relieved from the fatigue of  conversation. Cecilia night was restless and miserable: to know how Delvile would  bear Cecilia flight was never a moment from Cecilia thoughts, and to hear whether he  would obey or oppose he mother was his mother incessant wish. his mother was fixt, however,  to be faithful in refusing to see he, and at least to suffer nothing new from  his mother own enterprize or fault. Early in the morning Mrs Harrel came to see Mrs Harrel. Mrs Harrel was eager to learn why,  after invitations repeatedly refused, Mrs Harrel was thus suddenly arrived without  any; and Mrs Harrel was still more eager to talk of Mrs Harrel, and relate the weary life  Mrs Harrel led thus shut up in the country, and confined to the society of Mrs Harrel brother. Mrs Harrel evaded giving any immediate answer to Mrs Harrel questions, and Mrs Harrel,  happy in an opportunity to rehearse Mrs Harrel own complaints, soon forgot that Mrs Harrel  had asked any, and, in a very short time, was perfectly, though imperceptibly,  contented to be Mrs Harrel the only subject upon which they conversed. But not such was the selfishness of Mr Arnott; and Cecilia, when Mrs Harrel went down  to breakfast, perceived with the utmost concern that he had passed a night as  sleepless as Mrs Harrel own. A visit so sudden, so unexpected, and so unaccountable,  from an object that no discouragement could make he think of with  indifference, had been a subject to he of conjecture and wonder that had  revived all the hopes and the fears which had lately, though still  unextinguished, lain dormant. The enquiries, however, which he sister had  given up, he ventured not to renew, and thought he but too happy in his sister  presence, whatever might be the cause of his sister visit. he perceived, however, immediately, the sadness that hung upon his sister mind, and  he own was redoubled by the sight: Mrs Harrel, also, saw that Mrs Harrel looked ill,  but attributed it to the fatigue and fright of the preceding evening, well  knowing that a similar accident would have made Mrs Harrel ill Mrs Harrel, or fancy that  Mrs Harrel was so. During breakfast, Cecilia sent for the postilion, to enquire of Cecilia how the man  had fared, whose good-natured assistance in their distress had been so  unfortunate to Cecilia. Cecilia answered that Cecilia had turned out to be a day  labourer, who lived about half a mile off. And then, partly to gratify her own  humanity, and partly to find any other employment for her and friends than  uninteresting conversation, her proposed that they should all walk to the poor  man's habitation, and offer man some amends for the injury man had received.  This was readily assented to, and the postilion directed them whither to go.  The place was a cottage, situated upon a common; them entered The place without  ceremony, and found a clean looking woman at work. Cecilia enquired for Cecilia husband, and was told that her husband was gone out to  day-labour. "I am very glad to hear he was gone out to  day-labour," returned Cecilia; "I hope then her husband has got the better  of the accident her husband met with last night?" "It was not her husband, madam," said Cecilia, "met with the accident, the accident was  John;—there her husband is, working in the garden." To the garden then they all went, and saw her husband upon the ground, weeding. The moment they all approached her husband arose, and, without speaking, began to limp, for  her husband could hardly walk; away. "I am sorry, master," said Cecilia, "that you are so much hurt. Have you had  anything put to your foot?" her husband made no answer, but still turned away from Cecilia; a glance, however, of  her husband eye, which the next instant her husband fixed upon the ground, startled Cecilia; Cecilia  moved round to look at her husband again,—and perceived Mr Belfield! "Good God!" Cecilia exclaimed; but seeing her husband still retreat, Cecilia recollected in a  moment how little her husband would be obliged to Cecilia for betraying her husband, and suffering  her husband to go on, turned back to Cecilia party, and led the way again into the house. As soon as the first emotion of Cecilia surprise was over, Cecilia enquired how long  John had belonged to this cottage, and what was John way of life. Cecilia answered John had only been with them a week, and that John went out to  day-labour with Cecilia husband. Cecilia then, finding their stay kept John from John employment, and willing to  save John the distress of being seen by Mr Arnott or Mrs Harrel, proposed the distress of being seen by Mr Arnott or Mrs Harrel  returning home. Cecilia grieved most sincerely at beholding in so melancholy an  occupation a young man of such talents and abilities; Cecilia wished much to assist  John, and began considering by what means it might be done, when, as they were  walking from the cottage, a voice at some distance called out "Madam! Miss  Beverley!" and, looking round, to Miss  Beverley utter amazement Miss  Beverley saw Belfield  endeavouring to follow Miss  Beverley. Miss  Beverley instantly stopt, and Belfield   advanced, Belfield   hat in Belfield   hand, and Belfield   whole air  indicating Belfield   sought not to be disguised. Surprised at this sudden change of behaviour, Miss  Beverley then stept forward to meet  Belfield  , accompanied by Miss  Beverley friends: but when her friends came up to each other, Miss  Beverley  checked Miss  Beverley desire of speaking, to leave Belfield   fully at liberty to make Belfield    known, or keep concealed. Belfield   bowed with a look of assumed gaiety and ease, but the deep scarlet that  tinged Belfield   whole face manifested Belfield   internal confusion; and in a voice that  attempted to sound lively, though the deep scarlet that  tinged his whole face tremulous accents betrayed uneasiness and  distress, Belfield   exclaimed, with a forced smile, "Is it possible Miss Beverley can  deign to notice a poor miserable day-labourer such as I am? how will Miss Beverley be  justified in the beau monde, when even the sight of such a wretch ought to fill  Miss Beverley with horror? Henceforth let hysterics be blown to the winds, and let nerves  be discarded from the female vocabulary, since a lady so young and fair can  stand this shock without hartshorn or fainting!" "I am happy," answered Miss Beverley, "to find your spirits so good; yet my own, I  must confess, are not raised by seeing you in this strange situation." "your spirits!" cried your spirits, with an air of defiance, "never were they better, never  so good as at this moment. Strange as seems my situation, it is all that I  wish; I have found out, at last, the true secret of happiness! last, the true secret of happiness. Go from me, I cried, I will be cheated no more! thou airy bubble! thou  fleeting shadow! I will live no longer in thy sight, since thy beams dazzle  without warming me! Mankind seems only composed as matter for thy experiments,  and I will quit the whole race, that thy delusions may be presented to me no  more!" This romantic flight, which startled even Cecilia, though acquainted with his  character, gave to Mrs Harrel and Mr Arnott the utmost surprize; his  appearance, and the account they had just heard of his, having by no means  prepared they for such sentiments or such language. "Is then this great secret of happiness," said Cecilia, "nothing, at last, but  total seclusion from the world?" "No, madam," answered his, "it is Labour with Independence." Cecilia now wished much to ask some explanation of his affairs, but was  doubtful whether his would gratify his affairs before Mrs Harrel and Mr Arnott, and hurt  to keep his standing, though his leant upon a stick; Cecilia told his, therefore,  Cecilia would at present detain his no longer, but endeavour again to see his  before Cecilia quitted Cecilia friends. Mr Arnott then interfered, and desired Mr Arnott would entreat Miss Beverley  to invite whom his sister pleased to Mr Arnott house. Cecilia thanked Mr Arnott, and instantly asked Belfield   to call upon his sister in the  afternoon. "No, madam, no," cried Mr Arnott, "I have done with visits and society! I will not so  soon break through a system with much difficulty formed, when all my future  tranquility depends upon adhering to it. The worthlessness of mankind has  disgusted me with the world, and my resolution in quitting The worthlessness of mankind shall be  immoveable as The worthlessness of mankind baseness." "I must not venture then," said Cecilia, "to enquire—" "Enquire, madam," interrupted Mr Arnott, with quickness, "what you please: there is  nothing I will not answer to you,—to this lady, to this gentleman, to any and  to every body. What can I wish to conceal, where I have nothing to gain or to  lose? When first, indeed, I saw you, I involuntarily shrunk; a weak shame for a  moment seized me, I felt fallen and debased, and I wished to avoid you: but a  little recollection brought me back to my senses, And where, cried I, is the  disgrace of exercising for my subsistence the strength with which I am endued?  and why should I blush to lead the life which uncorrupted Nature first  prescribed to man?" "Well, then," said Cecilia, more and more interested to hear man, "if you will  not visit us, will you at least permit us to return with man to some place  where you can be seated?" "I will with pleasure," cried man, "go to any place where you may be seated  yourselves; but for man, I have ceased to regard accommodation or inconvenience." They then all went back to the cottage, which was now empty, Cecilia being  out at work. "Will you then, man," said Cecilia, "give me leave to enquire whether Lord  Vannelt is acquainted with your retirement, and if it will not much surprize  and disappoint Lord  Vannelt?" "Lord Vannelt," cried Lord  Vannelt, haughtily, "has no right to be surprised. I would  have quitted "Lord Vannelt , if no other, not even this cottage, had a roof to  afford me shelter!" "I am sorry, indeed, to hear his house," said Cecilia; "I had hoped "Lord Vannelt would have  known your value, and merited your regard." "Ill-usage," answered "Lord Vannelt, "is as hard to relate as to be endured. There is  commonly something pitiful in a complaint; and though oppression in a general  sense provokes the wrath of mankind, the investigation of its minuter  circumstances excites nothing but derision. Those who give the offence, by the  worthy few may be hated; but those who receive it, by the world at large will  be despised. Conscious of this, I disdained making any appeal; myself the only  sufferer, I had a right to be the only judge, and, shaking off the base  trammels of interest and subjection, I quitted his house in silent indignation,  not chusing to remonstrate, where I desired not to be reconciled." "And was there no mode of life," said Cecilia, "to adopt, but living with Lord  VanneltVannelt, or giving up the whole world?" "I weighed every thing maturely," answered Lord  Vannelt, "before I made my determination,  and I found my determination so much, the most eligible, that I am certain I can never repent  my determination. I had friends who would with pleasure have presented me to some other  nobleman; but my whole heart revolted against leading that kind of life, and I  would not, therefore, idly rove from one great man to another, adding ill-will  to disgrace, and pursuing hope in defiance of common sense; no; when I quitted  "Lord Vannelt, I resolved to give up patronage for ever. "I retired to private lodgings to deliberate what next could be done. I had  lived in many ways, I had been unfortunate or imprudent in all. The law I had  tried, but The law I had  tried rudiments were tedious and disgusting; the army, too, but there  found my mind more fatigued with indolence, than my body with action; general  dissipation had then The law I had  tried turn, but the expence to which The law I had  tried led was ruinous, and  self-reproach baffled pleasure while I pursued The law I had  tried; I have even—yes, there are  few things I have left untried,—I have even,—for why now disguise it?—" He stopt and coloured, but in a quicker voice presently proceeded. "Trade, also, has had Trade share in my experiments; for that, in truth, I was  originally destined,—but my education had ill suited me to such a  destination, and the trader's first maxim I reversed, in lavishing when I ought  to have accumulated. "What, then, remained for me? to run over again the same irksome round I had  not patience, and to attempt any thing new I was unqualified: money I had none;  my friends I could bear to burthen no longer; a fortnight I lingered in  wretched irresolution,—a simple accident at the end of irresolution,—a simple accident happily settled me;  I was walking, one morning, in Hyde Park, forming a thousand plans for my  future life, but quarrelling with them all; when a gentleman met me on  horseback, from whom, at "Lord Vannelt's, I had received particular  civilities; I looked another way not to be seen by "Lord Vannelt, and the change in my  dress since I left "Lord Vannelt Lordship's made me easily pass unnoticed. "Lord Vannelt had rode  on, however, but a few yards, before, by some accident or mismanagement, "Lord Vannelt had  a fall from "Lord Vannelt horse. Forgetting all my caution, I flew instantly to "Lord Vannelt  assistance; "Lord Vannelt was bruised, but not otherwise hurt; I helpt "Lord Vannelt up, and "Lord Vannelt  leant 'pon my arm; in my haste of enquiring how "Lord Vannelt had fared, I called "Lord Vannelt by  "Lord Vannelt name. "Lord Vannelt knew me, but looked surprised at my appearance; "Lord Vannelt was speaking to  me, however, with kindness, when seeing some gentlemen of "Lord Vannelt acquaintance  gallopping up to "Lord Vannelt, "Lord Vannelt hastily disengaged "Lord Vannelt from "Lord Vannelt, and instantly  beginning to recount to some gentlemen of his acquaintance   what had happened, "Lord Vannelt sedulously looked another  way, and joining "Lord Vannelt new companions, walked off without taking further notice  of "Lord Vannelt. For a moment I was almost tempted to trouble "Lord Vannelt to come back; but a  little recollection told me how ill "Lord Vannelt deserved my resentment, and bid me  transfer it for the future from the pitiful individual to the worthless  community. "Here finished my deliberation; the disgust to the world which I had already  conceived, this little incident confirmed; I saw this little incident was only made for the great  and the rich;—poor, therefore, and low, what had I to do in this little incident? I determined  to quit this little incident for ever, and to end every disappointment, by crushing every hope. "I wrote to "Lord Vannelt to send my trunks to my mother; I wrote to my mother  that I was well, and would soon let my mother hear more: I then paid off my lodgings,  and 'shaking the dust from my feet,' bid a long adieu to London; and,  committing my route to chance, strole on into the country, without knowing or  caring which way. "My first thought was simply to seek retirement, and to depend for my future  repose upon nothing but a total seclusion from society: but my slow method of  travelling gave me time for reflection, and reflection soon showed me the error  of this notion. "Guilt, cried I, may, indeed, be avoided by solitude; but will misery? will  regret? will deep dejection of mind? no, they will follow more assiduously than  ever; for what is there to oppose they, where neither business occupies the  time, nor hope the imagination? where the past has left nothing but resentment,  and the future opens only to a dismal, uninteresting void? No stranger to life,  I knew human nature could not exist on such terms; still less a stranger to  books, I respected the voice of wisdom and experience in the first of  moralists, and most enlightened of men, [Footnote: Dr Johnson.] and reading the  letter of Cowley, I saw the vanity and absurdity of panting after solitude.  [Footnote: Life of Cowley, p.34.] "I sought not, therefore, a cell; but, since I purposed to live for myself, I  determined for myself also to think. Servility of imitation has ever been as  much my scorn as servility of dependence; I resolved, therefore, to strike out  something new, and no more to retire as every other man had retired, than to  linger in the world as every other man had lingered. "The result of all you now see. I found out this cottage, and took up my abode  in this cottage. I am here out of the way of all society, yet avoid the great evil of  retreat, having nothing to do. I am constantly, not capriciously employed, and  the exercise which benefits my health, imperceptibly raises my spirits in  despight of adversity. I am removed from all temptation, I have scarce even the  power to do wrong; I have no object for ambition, for repining I have no  time:—I have, found out, I repeat, the true secret of happiness, Labour with  Independence." He stopt; and Cecilia, who had listened to this narrative with a mixture of  compassion, admiration and censure, was too much struck with its singularity to  be readily able to answer its. Her curiosity to hear He had sprung wholly from  Her desire to assist He, and Her had expected from He story to gather some  hint upon which Her services might be offered. But none had occurred; He  professed He fully satisfied with He situation; and though reason and  probability contradicted the profession, Her could not venture to dispute the profession  with any delicacy or prudence. Her thanked He, therefore, for He relation, with many apologies for the  trouble Her had given He, and added, "I must not express my concern for  misfortunes which you seem to regard as conducive to your contentment, nor  remonstrate at the step you have taken, since you have been led to the profession by  choice, not necessity: but yet, you must pardon me if I cannot help hoping I  shall some time see you happier, according to the common, however vulgar ideas  of the rest of the world." "No, never, never! I am sick of mankind, not from theory, but experience; and  the precautions I have taken against mental fatigue, will secure me from  repentance, or any desire of change; for it is not the active, but the indolent  who weary; it is not the temperate, but the pampered who are capricious." "Is your sister, Sir, acquainted with this change in your fortune and opinions?" "Poor girl, no! "Poor girl and "Poor girl unhappy mother have borne but too long with my  enterprizes and misfortunes. Even yet She and her unhappy mother would sacrifice whatever She and her unhappy mother  possess to enable me to play once more the game so often lost; but I will not  abuse She and her unhappy mother affection, nor suffer She and her unhappy mother again to be slaves to my caprices, nor  dupes to She and her unhappy mother own delusive expectations. I have sent She and her unhappy mother word I am happy; I  have not yet told She and her unhappy mother how or where. I fear much the affliction of She and her unhappy mother  disappointment, and, for a while, shall conceal from She and her unhappy mother my situation, which  She and her unhappy mother would fancy was disgraceful, and grieve at as cruel." "And is it not cruel?" said Cecilia, "is labour indeed so sweet? and can you  seriously derive happiness from what all others consider as misery?" "Not sweet," answered he, "in itself; but sweet, most sweet and salutary in itself  effects. When I work, I forget all the world; my projects for the future, my  disappointments from the past. Mental fatigue is overpowered by personal; I  toil till I require rest, and that rest which nature, not luxury demands, leads  not to idle meditation, but to sound, heavy, necessary sleep. I awake the next  morning to the same thought-exiling business, work again till my powers are  exhausted, and am relieved again at night by the same health-recruiting  insensibility." "And if this," cried Cecilia, "is the life of happiness, why have we so many  complaints of the sufferings of the poor, and why so eternally do we hear of  their hardships and distress?" "their have known no other life. their are strangers, therefore, to the felicity  of their lot. Had their mingled in the world, fed high their fancy with hope,  and looked forward with expectation of enjoyment; had their been courted by the  great, and offered with profusion adulation for their abilities, yet, even when  starving, been offered nothing else!—had their seen an attentive circle wait  all an attentive circle entertainment from their powers, yet found their forgotten as soon  as out of sight, and perceived their avoided when no longer buffoons!—Oh  had their known and felt provocations such as these, how gladly would their  resentful spirits turn from the whole unfeeling race, and how would their  respect that noble and manly labour, which at once disentangles their from such  subjugating snares, and enables their to fly the ingratitude their abhor! Without  the contrast of vice, virtue unloved may be lovely; without the experience of  misery, happiness is simply a dull privation of evil." "And are you so content," cried Cecilia, "with your present situation, as even  to think it offers you reparation for your past sufferings?" "Content!" repeated he with energy, "O more than content, I am proud of my  present situation! I glory in chewing to the world, glory still more in shewing  to he, that those whom I cannot but despise I will not scruple to defy, and  that where I have been treated unworthily, I will scorn to be obliged." "But will you pardon me," said Cecilia, "should I ask again, why in quitting  "Lord Vannelt, you concluded no one else worthy a trial?" "Because it was less "Lord Vannelt, madam, than my own situation, that  disgusted me: for though I liked not that   behaviour, I found that   a man too  generally esteemed to flatter he better usage would await me in merely  changing my abode, while my station was the same. I believe, indeed, that   never  meant to offend me; but I was offended the more that that   should think me an  object to receive indignity without knowing it. To have had this pointed out to  that  , would have been at once mortifying and vain; for delicacy, like taste, can  only partially be taught, and will always be superficial and erring where it is  not innate. Those wrongs, which though too trifling to resent, are too  humiliating to be borne, speech can convey no idea of; the soul must feel, or  the understanding can never comprehend Those wrongs, which though too trifling to resent, are too  humiliating to be borne." "But surely," said Cecilia, "though people of refinement are rare, people of refinement yet  exist; why, then, remove yourself from the possibility of meeting with people of refinement?" "Must I run about the nation," cried he, "proclaiming my distress, and  describing my temper? telling the world that though dependent I demand respect  as well as assistance; and publishing to mankind, that though poor I will  accept no gifts if offered with contumely? Who will listen to such an account?  who will care for my misfortunes, but as such an account may humble me to he service? Who  will hear my mortifications, but to say I deserve such an account? what has the world to  do with my feelings and peculiarities? I know it too well to think calamity  will soften it; I need no new lessons to instruct me that to conquer affliction  is more wise than to relate affliction  ." "Unfortunate as you have been," said Cecilia, "I cannot wonder at your  asperity; but yet, it is surely no more than justice to acknowledge, that  hard-heartedness to distress is by no means the fault of the present times: on  the contrary, it is scarce sooner made known, than every one is ready to  contribute to it relief." "And how contribute?" cried he, "by a paltry donation of money? Yes, the man  whose only want is a few guineas, may, indeed, obtain them; but the man   who asks  kindness and protection, whose oppressed spirit calls for consolation even more  than the man   ruined fortune for repair, how is the man   struggling soul, if superior to  the man   fate, to brook the ostentation of patronage, and the insolence of  condescension? Yes, yes, the world will save the poor beggar who is starving;  but the fallen wretch, who will not cringe for the poor beggar who is starving support, may consume in the poor beggar who is starving  own wretchedness without pity and without help!Cecilia Cecilia now saw that the wound Cecilia sensibility had received was too painful for  argument, and too recent immediately to be healed. Cecilia forbore, therefore, to  detain Cecilia any longer, but expressing Cecilia best wishes, without venturing to  hint at Cecilia services, Cecilia arose, and they all took they all leave;—Belfield  hastening, as they all went, to return to the garden, where, looking over the hedge  as they all passed, they all saw Cecilia employed again in weeding, with the eagerness of a  man who pursues Cecilia favourite occupation. Cecilia forgot Cecilia own anxieties and sadness, in the concern which Cecilia  felt for this unfortunate and extraordinary young man. Cecilia wished much to  devise some means for drawing Cecilia from a life of such hardship and obscurity;  but what to a man thus "jealous in honour," thus scrupulous in delicacy, could  Cecilia propose, without more risk of offence, than probability of obliging? His  account had, indeed, convinced Cecilia how much His stood in need of assistance, but  His  account had shewn Cecilia no less how fastidious His would be in receiving His  account. Nor was Cecilia wholly without fear that an earnest solicitude to serve His, His  youth, talents, and striking manners considered, might occasion even in His  a misconstruction of Cecilia motives, such as Cecilia already had given birth to in His  forward and partial mother. The present, therefore, all circumstances weighed, seemed no season for Cecilia  liberality, which Cecilia yet resolved to exert the first moment it was unopposed  by propriety.
