 It was necessary, however, not to moralize, but to act; Cecilia had undertaken  to give her answer in a week, and the artful attorney had drawn from her an  acknowledgment of her situation, by which he might claim it yet sooner. The law-suit with which she was threatened for the arrears of eight months,  alarmed her not, though it shocked her, as she was certain she could prove her  marriage so much later. It was easy to perceive that this man had been sent with a view of working from  her a confession, and terrifying from her some money; the confession, indeed,  in conscience and honesty she could not wholly elude, but she had suffered too  often by a facility in parting with money to be there easily duped. Nothing, however, was more true, than that she now lived upon an estate of  which she no longer was the owner, and that all she either spent or received  was to be accounted for and returned, since by the will of her uncle, unless  her husband took her name, her estate on the very day of her marriage was to be  forfeited, and entered upon by the Egglestons. Delvile's plan and hope of  secresy had made them little weigh this matter, though this premature discovery  so unexpectedly exposed her to their power. The first thought that occurred to her, was to send an express to Delvile, and  desire his instructions how to proceed; but she dreaded his impetuosity of  temper, and was almost certain that the instant he should hear she was in any  uneasiness or perplexity, he would return to her, at all hazards, even though  Mr Monckton were dead, and his mother herself dying. This step, therefore, she  did not dare risk, preferring any personal hardship, to endangering the already  precarious life of Mrs Delvile, or to hastening her son home while Mr Monckton  was in so desperate a situation. But though what to avoid was easy to settle, what to seek was difficult to  devise. She bad now no Mrs Charlton to receive her, not a creature in whom she  could confide. To continue her present way of living was deeply involving  Delvile in debt, a circumstance she had never considered, in the confusion and  hurry attending all their plans and conversations, and a circumstance which,  though to him it might have occurred, he could not in common delicacy mention. Yet to have quitted her house, and retrenched her expences, would have raised  suspicions that must have anticipated the discovery she so much wished to have  delayed. That wish, by the present danger of its failure, was but more ardent;  to have her affairs and situation become publicly known at the present period,  she felt would half distract her.â€”Privately married, parted from her husband  at the very moment of their union, a husband by whose hand the apparent friend  of her earliest youth was all but killed, whose father had execrated the match,  whose mother was now falling a sacrifice to the vehemence with which she had  opposed it, and who himself, little short of an exile, knew not yet if, with  personal safety, he might return to his native land! To circumstances so  dreadful, she had now the additional shock of being uncertain whether her own  house might not be seized, before any other could be prepared for her reception! Yet still whither to go, what to do, or what to resolve, she was wholly unable  to determine; and after meditating almost to madness in the search of some plan  or expedient, she was obliged to give over the attempt, and be satisfied with  remaining quietly where she was, till she had better news from Delvile of his  mother, or better news to send him of Mr Monckton; carefully, mean time, in all  her letters avoiding to alarm him by any hint of her distress. Yet was she not idle, either from despair or helplessness: she found her  difficulties encreased, and she called forth more resolution to combat them:  she animated herself by the promise she had made Delvile, and recovering from  the sadness to which she had at first given way, she now exerted herself with  vigour to perform it as she ought. She began by making an immediate inspection into her affairs, and endeavouring,  where expence seemed unnecessary, to lessen it. She gave Henrietta to  understand she feared they must soon part; and so afflicted was the unhappy  girl at the news, that she found it the most cruel office she had to execute.  The same intimation she gave to Mrs Harrel, who repined at it more openly, but  with a selfishness so evident that it blunted the edge of pity. She then  announced to Albany her inability to pursue, at present, their extensive  schemes of benevolence; and though he instantly left her, to carry on his  laborious plan elsewhere, the reverence she had now excited in him of her  character, made him leave her with no sensation but of regret, and readily  promise to return when her affairs were settled, or her mind more composed. These little preparations, which were all she could make, with enquiries after  Mr Monckton, and writing to Delvile, sufficiently filled up her time, though  her thoughts were by no means confined to them. Day after day passed, and Mr  Monckton continued to linger rather than live; the letters of Delvile, still  only dated from Ostend, contained the most melancholy complaints of the illness  of his mother; and the time advanced when her answer would be claimed by the  attorney. The thought of such another visit was almost intolerable; and within two days  of the time that she expected it, she resolved to endeavour herself to prevail  with Mr Eggleston to wait longer. Mr Eggleston was a gentleman whom she knew little more than by sight; he was no  relation to her family, nor had any connection with the Dean, but by being a  cousin to a lady he had married, and who had left him no children. The dean had  no particular regard for him, and had rather mentioned him in his will as the  successor of Cecilia, in case she died unmarried or changed her name, as a mark  that he approved of her doing neither, than as a matter he thought probable, if  even possible, to turn out in his favour. He was a man of a large family, the sons of which, who were extravagant and  dissipated, had much impaired his fortune by prevailing with him to pay their  debts, and much distressed him in his affairs by successfully teasing him for  money. Cecilia, acquainted with these circumstances, knew but too well with what  avidity her estate would be seized by them, and how little the sons would  endure delay, even if the father consented to it. Yet since the sacrifice to  which she had agreed must soon make it indisputably their own, she determined  to deal with them openly; and acknowledged, therefore, in her letter, her  marriage without disguise, but begged their patience and secresy, and promised,  in a short time, the most honourable retribution and satisfaction. She sent this letter by a man and horse, Mr Eggleston's habitation being within  fifteen miles of her own. The answer was from his eldest son, who acquainted her that his father was very  ill, and had put all his affairs into the hands of Mr Carn, his attorney, who  was a man of great credit, and would see justice done on all sides. If this answer, which she broke open the instant she took it into her hand, was  in itself a cruel disappointment to her, how was that disappointment embittered  by shame and terror, when, upon again folding it up, she saw it was directed to  Mrs Mortimer Delvile! This was a decisive stroke; what they wrote to her, she was sure they would  mention to all others; she saw they were too impatient for her estate to be  moved by any representations to a delay, and that their eagerness to publish  their right, took from them all consideration of what they might make her  suffer. Mr Eggleston, she found, permitted himself to be wholly governed by his  son; his son was a needy and profligate spendthrift, and by throwing the  management of the affair into the hands of an attorney, craftily meant to  shield himself from the future resentment of Delvile, to whom, hereafter, he  might affect, at his convenience, to disapprove Mr Carn's behaviour, while Mr  Carn was always secure, by averring he only exerted himself for the interest of  his client. The discerning Cecilia, though but little experienced in business, and wholly  unsuspicious by nature, yet saw into this management, and doubted not these  excuses were already arranged. She had only, therefore, to save herself an  actual ejectment, by quitting a house in which she was exposed to such a  disgrace. But still whither to go she knew not! One only attempt seemed in her power for  an honourable asylum, and that was more irksomely painful to her than seeking  shelter in the meanest retreat: it was applying to Mr Delvile senior. The action of leaving her house, whether quietly or forcibly, could not but  instantly authenticate the reports spread by the Egglestons of her marriage: to  hope therefore for secresy any longer would be folly, and Mr Delvile's rage at  such intelligence might be still greater to hear it by chance than from  herself. She now lamented that Delvile had not at once told the tale, but,  little foreseeing such a discovery as the present, they had mutually concluded  to defer the communication till his return. Her own anger at the contemptuous ill treatment she had repeatedly met from  him, she was now content not merely to suppress but to dismiss, since, as the  wife of his son without his consent, she considered herself no longer as wholly  innocent of incurring it. Yet, such was her dread of his austerity and the  arrogance of his reproaches, that, by choice, she would have preferred an  habitation with her own pensioner, the pew-opener, to the grandest apartment in  Delvile Castle while he continued its lord. In her present situation, however, her choice was little to be consulted: the  honour of Delvile was concerned in her escaping even temporary disgrace, and  nothing, she knew, would so much gratify him, as any attention from her to his  father. She wrote to him, therefore, the following letter, which she sent by an  express. To the Hon. Compton Delvile. April 29th, 1780. SIR,â€”I should not, even by letter, presume thus to force myself upon your  remembrance, did I not think it a duty I now owe your son, both to risk and to  bear the displeasure it may unhappily occasion. After such an acknowledgment,  all other confession would be superfluous; and uncertain as I am if you will  ever deign to own me, more words than are necessary would be merely impertinent. It was the intention of your son, Sir, when he left the kingdom, to submit  wholly to your arbitration, at his return, which should be resigned, his own  name or my fortune: but his request for your decision, and his supplication for  your forgiveness, are both, most unfortunately, prevented, by a premature and  unforeseen discovery of our situation, which renders an immediate determination  absolutely unavoidable. At this distance from him, I cannot, in time, receive his directions upon the  measures I have to take; pardon me then, Sir, if well knowing my reference to  him will not be more implicit than his own to you, I venture, in the present  important crisis of my affairs, to entreat those commands instantly, by which I  am certain of being guided ultimately. I would commend myself to your favour but that I dread exciting your  resentment. I will detain you, therefore, only to add, that the father of Mr  Mortimer Delvile, will ever meet the most profound respect from her who,  without his permission, dare sign no name to the honour she now has in  declaring herself his most humble, and most obedient servant.     Her mind was somewhat easier when this letter was written, because she thought  it a duty, yet felt reluctance in performing it. She wished to have represented  to him strongly the danger of Delvile's hearing her distress, but she knew so  well his inordinate self-sufficiency, she feared a hint of that sort might be  construed into an insult, and concluded her only chance that he would do any  thing, was by leaving wholly to his own suggestions the weighing and settling  what. But though nothing was more uncertain than whether she should be received at  Delvile Castle, nothing was more fixed than that she must quit her own house,  since the pride of Mr Delvile left not even a chance that his interest would  conquer it. She deferred not, therefore, any longer making preparations for her  removal, though wholly unsettled whither. Her first, which was also her most painful task, was to acquaint Henrietta with  her situation: she sent, therefore, to desire to speak with her, but the  countenance of Henrietta shewed her communication would not surprise her. "What is the matter with my dear Henrietta?" cried Cecilia; "who is it has  already afflicted that kind heart which I am now compelled to afflict for  myself?" Henrietta, in whom anger appeared to be struggling with sorrow, answered, "No,  madam, not afflicted for you! it would be strange if I were, thinking as I  think!" "I am glad," said Cecilia, calmly, "if you are not, for I would give to you,  were it possible, nothing but pleasure and joy." "Ah madam!" cried Henrietta, bursting into tears, "why will you say so when you  don't care what becomes of me! when you are going to cast me off!â€”and when  you will soon be too happy ever to think of me more!" "If I am never happy till then," said Cecilia, "sad, indeed, will be my life!  no, my gentlest friend, you will always have your share in my heart; and  always, to me, would have been the welcomest guest in my house, but for those  unhappy circumstances which make our separating inevitable." "Yet you suffered me, madam, to hear from any body that you was married and  going away; and all the common servants in the house knew it before me." "I am amazed!" said Cecilia; "how and which way can they have heard it?" "The man that went to Mr Eggleston brought the first news of it, for he said  all the servants there talked of nothing else, and that their master was to  come and take possession here next Thursday." Cecilia started at this most unwelcome intelligence; "Yet you envy me," she  cried, "Henrietta, though I am forced from my house! though in quitting it, I  am unprovided with any other, and though him for whom I relinquish it, is far  off, without means of protecting, or power of returning to me!" "But you are married to him, madam!" cried she, expressively. "True, my love; but, also, I am parted from him!" "Oh how differently," exclaimed Henrietta, "do the great think from the little!  were I married,â€”and so married, I should want neither house, nor fine  cloaths, nor riches, nor any thing;â€”I should not care where I lived,â€”every  place would be paradise! I would walk to him barefoot if he were a thousand  miles off, and I should mind nobody else in the world while I had him to take  care of me!" Ah Delvile! thought Cecilia, what powers of fascination are yours! should I be  tempted to repine at what I have to bear, I will think of this heroick girl and  blush! Mrs Harrel now broke in upon them, eager to be informed of the truth or  falsehood of the reports which were buzzed throughout the house. Cecilia  briefly related to them both the state of her affairs, earnestly expressing her  concern at the abrupt separation which must take place, and for which she had  been unable to prepare them, as the circumstances which led to it had been  wholly unforeseen by herself. Mrs Harrel listened to the account with much curiosity and surprize; but  Henrietta wept incessantly in hearing it: the object of a passion ardent as it  was romantic, lost to her past recovery; torn herself, probably for ever, from  the best friend she had in the world; and obliged to return thus suddenly to an  home she detested,â€”Henrietta possessed not the fortitude to hear evils such  as these, which, to her inexperienced heart, appeared the severest that could  be inflicted. This conversation over, Cecilia sent for her Steward, and desired him, with the  utmost expedition, to call in all her bills, and instantly to go round to her  tenants within twenty miles, and gather in, from those who were able to pay,  the arrears now due to her; charging him, however, upon no account, to be  urgent with such as seemed distressed. The bills she had to pay were collected without difficulty; she never owed  much, and creditors are seldom hard of access; but the money she hoped to  receive fell very short of her expectations, for the indulgence she had shewn  to her tenants had ill prepared them for so sudden a demand.
