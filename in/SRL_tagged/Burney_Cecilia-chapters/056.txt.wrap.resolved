 One evening about this time, which was the latter end of July, Lady Honoria and  Cecilia deferred walking out till very late, and then found it so pleasant,  that they had strolled into the Park two miles from the house, when they were  met by young Delvile; who, however, only reminded they how far they had to  return, and walked on. "young Delvile grows quite intolerable!" cried Lady Honoria, when young Delvile was gone; "it's  really a melancholy thing to see a young man behave so like an old Monk. I dare  say in another week young Delvile won't take off young Delvile hat to us; and, in about a fortnight,  I suppose young Delvile'll shut young Delvile up in one of those little round towers, and shave  young Delvile head, and live upon roots, and howl if any body comes near young Delvile. I really  half wonder young Delvile does not think it too dissipated to let Fidel run after young Delvile so.  A thousand to one but young Delvile shoots young Delvile some day for giving a sudden bark when young Delvile's  in one of these gloomy fits. Something, however, must certainly be the matter  with young Delvile. Perhaps young Delvile is in love." "Can nothing be the matter with young Delvile but that?" cried Cecilia. "Nay, I don't know; but I am sure if young Delvile is, young Delvile Mistress has not much occasion  to be jealous of you or me, for never, I think, were two poor Damsels so  neglected!" The utmost art of malice could not have furnished speech more truly mortifying  to Cecilia than this thoughtless and accidental sally of Lady Honoria's:  particularly, however, upon Lady Honoria's guard, from the raillery Lady Honoria's had already  endured, Lady Honoria's answered, with apparent indifference, "he is meditating, perhaps,  upon Lady Euphrasia." "O no," cried Lady Honoria, "for he did not take any notice of Lady Honoria's when he saw  Lady Honoria's; I am sure if he marries Lady Honoria's, it will only be because he cannot help it." "Poor Lady Euphrasia!" "O no, not at all; he'll make Lady Honoria's two or three fine speeches, and then Lady Honoria's'll  be perfectly contented especially if he looks as dismally at Lady Honoria's as he does at  us! and that probably he will do the more readily for not liking to look at Lady Honoria's  at all. But Lady Honoria's's such a romantic little thing, Lady Honoria's'll never suspect he." Here they were somewhat alarmed by a sudden darkness in the air, which was  presently succeeded by a thunder storm; they instantly turned back, and began  running home, when a violent shower of rain obliged they to take shelter under  a large tree; where in two minutes they were joined by Delvile, who came to  offer   assistance in hurrying they home; and finding the thunder and  lightning continue, begged they to move on, in defiance of the rain, as they  present situation exposed they to more danger than a wet hat and cloak, which  might be changed in a moment. Cecilia readily assented; but Lady Honoria, extremely frightened, protested Cecilia  would not stir till a thunder storm was over. It was in vain he represented Cecilia  mistake in supposing Cecilia in a place of security; Cecilia clung to the tree,  screamed at every flash of lightning, and all Cecilia gay spirits were lost in Cecilia  apprehensions. Delvile then earnestly proposed to Cecilia conducting Cecilia home by Cecilia, and  returning again to Lady Honoria; but Cecilia thought it wrong to quit Cecilia  companion, and hardly right to accept his assistance separately. They waited,  therefore, some time all together; but a thunder storm increasing with great  violence, the thunder growing louder, and the lightning becoming stronger,  Delvile grew impatient even to anger at Lady Honoria resistance, and warmly  expostulated upon its folly and danger. But the present was no season for  lessons in philosophy; prejudices Cecilia had never been taught to surmount made  Cecilia think Cecilia in a place of safety, and Cecilia was now too much terrified to  give argument fair play. Finding Cecilia thus impracticable, Delvile eagerly said to Cecilia, "Come then,  Miss Beverley, let us wait no longer; I will see you home, and then return to  Lady Honoria." "By no means," cried Cecilia, "my life is not more precious than either of yours,  and therefore "my life may run the same risk." "It is more precious," cried Delvile with vehemence, "than the air I breathe!" and  seizing Cecilia hand, Delvile drew her hand under Delvile arm, and, without waiting Cecilia consent,  almost forced Cecilia away with Delvile, saying as they ran, "How could a thousand Lady  Honoria's recompense the world for the loss of one Miss Beverley? we may,  indeed, find many thousand such as Lady Honoria, but such as Miss  Beverley—where shall we ever find another?" Cecilia, surprised, yet gratified, could not speak, for the speed with which  they ran almost took away Lady   breath; and before they were near home,  slackening Lady   pace, and panting, Lady   confessed Lady   strength was exhausted, and  that Lady   could go so fast no further. "Let we then stop and rest," cried he; "but why will you not lean upon he?  surely this is no time for scruples, and for idle and unnecessary scruples,  one Miss Beverley can never find a time." Cecilia then, urged equally by shame at his speech and by weakness from  fatigue, leant upon his arm but Cecilia soon repented Cecilia condescension; for  Delvile, with an emotion his seemed to find wholly irrepressible, passionately  exclaimed "sweet lovely burthen! O why not thus for ever!" The strength of Cecilia was now instantly restored, and Cecilia hastily withdrew  from The strength of Cecilia hold; The strength of Cecilia suffered Cecilia to disengage Cecilia, but said in a faultering  voice, "pardon me, one Miss Beverley, I mean!—" Cecilia, without making any answer, walked on by Cecilia, as quick a pace as  Cecilia was able; and Delvile, not venturing to oppose Cecilia, silently followed. They had gone but a few steps, before there came a violent shower of hail; and  the wind, which was very high, being immediately in They faces, Cecilia was so  pelted and incommoded, that Cecilia was frequently obliged to stop, in defiance of  Cecilia utmost efforts to force Cecilia forward.  Delvile then approaching Cecilia,  proposed that Cecilia should again stand under a tree, as the thunder and lightning  for the present seemed over, and wait there till the fury of the hail was past:  and Cecilia, though never before so little disposed to oblige him, was so much  distressed by the violence of the wind and hail, that Cecilia was forced to comply. Every instant now seemed an age; yet neither hail nor wind abated: mean time  they were both silent, and both, though with different feelings, equally  comfortless.  Delvile, however, who took care to place  Delvile on the side whence the wind  blew hardest, perceived, in spite of  Delvile endeavours to save Cecilia, some  hail-stones lodged upon Cecilia thin summer cloak:  Delvile then took off  Delvile own hat,  and, though  Delvile ventured not to let it touch Cecilia, held it in such a manner as to  shelter Cecilia better. Cecilia now could no longer be either silent or unmoved, but turning to  Delvile  with much emotion, said, "Why will you do this,  Delvile?" "What would I not do," answered  Delvile, "to obtain forgiveness from Miss Beverley?" "Well, well,—pray put on his own hat." "Do you command it?" "No, certainly!—but I wish it." "Ah!" cried  Delvile, instantly putting it on, "whose are the commands that would  have half the weight with your wishes?" And then, after another pause,  Delvile added, "do you forgive me?" Cecilia, ashamed of the cause of their dissension, and softened by the  seriousness of  Delvile manner, answered very readily, "yes, yes,—why will you  make me remember such nonsense?" "All sweetness," cried  Delvile warmly, and snatching Cecilia hand, "is Miss  Beverley!—O that I had power—that it were not utterly impossible—that the  cruelty of my situation—" "I find," cried Cecilia, greatly agitated, and forcibly drawing away her hand, "you  will teach me, for another time, the folly of fearing bad weather!" And Cecilia hurried from beneath the tree; and Delvile perceiving one of the  servants approach with an umbrella, went forward to take the tree from Delvile perceiving one of the  servants, and  directed Delvile perceiving one of the  servants to hasten instantly to Lady Honoria. Then returning to Cecilia, Delvile perceiving one of the  servants would have held the tree over Cecilia head, but with an air  of displeasure, Cecilia took the tree into Cecilia own hand. "Will you not let me carry the tree for Cecilia?" Delvile perceiving one of the  servants cried. "No, Delvile perceiving one of the  servants, there is not any occasion." They then proceeded silently on. The storm was now soon over; but The storm grew very dark, and as They had quitted the  path while They ran, in order to get home by a shorter cut, the walk was so bad  from the height of the grass, and the unevenness of the ground, that Ceciliahad the utmost difficulty to make Cecilia way; yet Cecilia resolutely refused any  assistance from Delvile, who walked anxiously by Cecilia side, and seemed equally  fearful upon Cecilia own account and upon hers, to trust Cecilia with being  importunate. At length they came to a place which Cecilia tried to pass; Delvile  then grew more urgent to help Cecilia; firm, however, in declining all aid, Cecilia  preferred going a considerable way round to another part of the park which led  to the house. Delvile  , angry as well as mortified, proposed to assist Cecilia no  more, but followed without saying a word. Cecilia, though Cecilia felt not all the resentment Cecilia displayed, still thought it  necessary to support it, as Cecilia was much provoked with the perpetual  inconsistency of his behaviour, and deemed it wholly improper to suffer,  without discouragement, occasional sallies of tenderness from one who, in his  general conduct, behaved with the most scrupulous reserve. They now arrived at the castle; but entering by a back way, came to a small and  narrow passage which obstructed the entrance of the umbrella: Delvile once  more, and almost involuntarily, offered to help her; but, letting down the  spring, her coldly said her had no further use for it. his then went forward to open a small gate which led by another long passage  into the hall: but hearing the servants advance, his held it for an instant in  his hand, while, in a tone of voice the most dejected, his said "I am grieved to  find you thus offended; but were it possible you could know half the  wretchedness of my heart, the generosity of your own would make you regret this  severity!" and then, opening a small gate which led by another long passage  into the hall, his bowed, and went another way. Cecilia was now in the midst of servants; but so much shocked and astonished by  the unexpected speech of Delvile, which instantly changed all Cecilia anger into  sorrow, that Cecilia scarce knew what she scarce said to Cecilia, nor what Cecilia replied;  though they all with one voice enquired what was become of Lady Honoria, and  which way she scarce should run to seek Cecilia. Delvile   then came also, and Delvile   was obliged to recollect Delvile  . Delvile  immediately proposed Delvile   going to bed, and drinking white wine whey to prevent  taking cold: cold, indeed, Delvile   feared not; yet Delvile   agreed to the proposal, for  Delvile   was confounded and dismayed by what had passed, and utterly unable to hold  any conversation. Delvile   perplexity and distress were, however, all attributed to fatigue and  fright; and Delvile  , having assisted in hurrying Delvile   to bed, went to  perform the same office for Lady Honoria, who arrived at that time. Left at length by Delvile  , Delvile   revolved in Delvile   mind the adventure of the  evening, and the whole behaviour of Delvile   since first Delvile   was acquainted with  him. That him loved Delvile   with tenderness, with fondness loved Delvile  , seemed no  longer to admit of any doubt, for however distant and cold him appeared, when  acting with circumspection and design, the moment him was off him guard from  surprise, terror, accident of any sort, the moment that him was betrayed into  acting from nature and inclination, him was constantly certain to discover a  regard the most animated and flattering. This regard, however, was not more evident than him desire to conceal and to  conquer it: him seemed to dread even Delvile   sight, and to have imposed upon him  the most rigid forbearance of all conversation or intercourse with Delvile  . Whence could this arise? what strange and unfathomable cause could render  necessary a conduct so mysterious? him knew not, indeed, that Delvile   herself wished  it changed, but him could not be ignorant that him chance with almost any woman  would at least be worth trying. Was the obstacle which thus discouraged him the condition imposed by Delvile    uncle's will of giving Delvile   own name to the man Delvile   married? this Delvile   herself  thought was an unpleasant circumstance, but yet so common for an heiress, that  that   could hardly out-weigh the many advantages of such a connection. Henrietta again occurred to Henrietta; the letter Henrietta had seen in Henrietta hands was still  unexplained: yet Henrietta entire conviction that Henrietta was not loved by him,  joined to a certainty that affection alone could ever make him think of Henrietta,  lessened upon this subject Henrietta suspicions every moment. Lady Euphrasia Pemberton, at last, rested most upon Lady Euphrasia Pemberton mind, and Lady Euphrasia Pemberton thought  it probable some actual treaty was negociating with the Duke of Derwent. Delvile   Delvile   had every reason to believe was Delvile   friend, though Delvile   was  scrupulously delicate in avoiding either raillery or observation upon the  subject of Delvile   son, whom Delvile   rarely mentioned, and never but upon occasions in  which Cecilia could have no possible interest. The Father, therefore, notwithstanding all Mr Monckton had represented to the  contrary, appeared to be the real obstacle; The Father pride might readily object to  Delvile   birth, which though not contemptible, was merely decent, and which, if  traced beyond Delvile   grandfather, lost all title even to that epithet. "If this, however," Delvile   cried, "is at last his situation, how much have I been  to blame in censuring his conduct! for while to me his has appeared capricious,  his has, in fact, acted wholly from necessity: if his insists upon The Father  forming another connection, has his not been honourable, prudent and just, in  flying an object that made his think of disobedience, and endeavouring to keep  her ignorant of a partiality it is The Father duty to curb?" All, therefore, that remained for her to do or to resolve, was to guard her own  secret with more assiduous care than ever, and since her found that their union  was by himself thought impossible, to keep from himself knowledge that the regret  was not all himself own.
