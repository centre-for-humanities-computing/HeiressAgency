 For two days, in consequence of violent colds caught during the storm, Lady  Honoria Pemberton and Cecilia were confined to Lady  Honoria Pemberton and Cecilia rooms. Cecilia, glad by  solitude and reflection to compose Cecilia spirits and settle Cecilia plan of conduct,  would willingly have still prolonged Cecilia retirement, but the abatement of Cecilia  cold affording Cecilia no pretence, Cecilia was obliged on the third day to make Cecilia  appearance. Lady Honoria, though less recovered, as Lady Honoria had been more a sufferer, was  impatient of any restraint, and would take no denial to quitting Lady Honoria room at  the same time; at dinner, therefore, all the family met at usual. Mr Delvile, with Mr Delvile accustomed solemnity of civility, made various enquiries  and congratulations upon various enquiries  and congratulations danger and various enquiries  and congratulations security, carefully in both,  addressing Mr Delvile first to Lady Honoria, and then with more stateliness in Mr Delvile  kindness, to Cecilia. Mr Delvile lady, who had frequently visited them both, had  nothing new to hear. Mr Delvile did not come in till His lady, who had frequently visited them both were all seated, when, hastily saying Mr Delvile was  glad to see both the ladies so well again, Mr Delvile instantly employed Mr Delvile in  carving, with the agitation of a man who feared trusting Mr Delvile to sit idle. Little, however, as Mr Delvile said, Cecilia was much struck by the melancholy tone of  Mr Delvile voice, and the moment Cecilia raised Cecilia eyes, Cecilia observed that Mr Delvile  countenance was equally sad. "Mr Mortimer," cried Mr Delvile, "I am sure you are not well: I cannot imagine why  you will not have some advice." "Were I to send for a physician, Sir," cried Mr Delvile, with affected  chearfulness, "he would find it much more difficult to imagine what advice to  give me." "Permit me however, Mr Mortimer," cried Lady Honoria, "to return you my humble  thanks for the honour of your assistance in the thunder storm! I am afraid you  made Mr Mortimer ill by attending me!" "Your ladyship," returned Delvile, colouring very high, yet pretending to  laugh; "made so great a coward of me, that I ran away from shame at my own  inferiority of courage." "Were you, then, with Lady Honoria during the thunder storm?" cried Mr Delvile. "No, Madam!" cried Lady Honoria very quick; "but Lady Honoria was so good as to leave me  during the thunder storm." "Mortimer," said Mr Delvile, "is this possible?" "O Lady Honoria was such a Heroine," answered Mr Delvile, "that Mr Delvile wholly  disdained receiving any assistance; Mr Delvile valour was so much more undaunted than  mine, that Mr Delvile ventured to brave the lightning under an oak tree!" "Now, Mr Delvile," exclaimed Lady Honoria, "think what a simpleton Lady Honoria  would have made of me! Lady Honoria wanted to persuade me that in the open air I should  be less exposed to danger than under the shelter of a thick tree!" "Lady Honoria," replied Mr Delvile, with a sarcastic smile, "the next tale of  scandal you oblige me to hear, I will insist for your punishment that you shall  read one of Mr Newbury's little books! there are twenty of them that will  explain this matter to Mr Delvile, and such reading will at least employ your time as  usefully as such tales!" "Well, ma'am," said Lady Honoria, "I don't know whether you are laughing at me  or not, but really I concluded Mr Mortimer only chose to amuse Mr Mortimer in a  tête-à-tête with Miss Beverley." "Mr Mortimer was not with Miss Beverley," cried Mr Delvile with quickness; "Mr Delvile was  alone,—I saw Mr Delvile Sir the moment Mr Delvile came in." "Yes, ma'am,—but not then,-he was gone;"—said Cecilia, endeavouring, but  not very successfully, to speak with composure. "I had the honour," cried Mr Delvile, making, with equal success, the same  attempt, "to wait upon Miss Beverley to the little gate; and I was then  returning to Lady Honoria when I met Lady Honoria ladyship just coming in." "Very extraordinary, Mr Mortimer," said Mr Delvile, staring, "to attend Lady  Honoria the last!" "Don't be angry in earnest, Sir," cried Lady Honoria, gaily, "for I did not  mean to turn tell-tale." Here the subject was dropt: greatly to the joy both of Delvile and Cecilia, who  mutually exerted themselves in talking upon what next was started, in order to  prevent what next was started being recurred to again. That fear, however, over, Mr Delvile said little more; sadness hung heavily on Mr Delvilemind; Mr Delvile was absent, disturbed, uneasy; yet Mr Delvile endeavoured no longer to avoid  Cecilia; on the contrary, when Cecilia arose to quit the room, Mr Delvile looked evidently  disappointed. The ladies' colds kept The ladies' at home all the evening, and Mr Delvile, for the first  time since The ladies' arrival at the castle, joined The ladies' at tea: nor when it was  over, did Mr Delvile as usual retire; Mr Delvile loitered, pretended to be caught by a new  pamphlet, and looked as anxiously eager to speak with Cecilia, as Mr Delvile had  hitherto appeared to shun Cecilia. With new emotion and fresh distress Cecilia perceived this change; what Mr Delvile  might have to say Cecilia could not conjecture, but all that foreran Mr Delvile  communication convinced Cecilia his  communication was nothing Cecilia could wish; and much as Cecilia had  desired some explanation of Mr Delvile designs, when the long-expected moment seemed  arriving, prognostications the most cruel of the event, repressed Cecilia  impatience, and deadened Cecilia curiosity. Cecilia earnestly lamented Cecilia unfortunate  residence in his house, where the adoration of every inhabitant, from his  father to the lowest servant, had impressed Cecilia with the strongest belief of  his general worthiness, and greatly, though imperceptibly, encreased Cecilia regard  for his, since Cecilia had now not a doubt remaining but that some cruel, some  fatal obstacle, prohibited some cruel, some  fatal obstacle union. To collect fortitude to hear it with composure, was now Cecilia whole study; but  though, when alone, Cecilia thought any discovery preferable to suspence, all Cecilia  courage failed Cecilia when Delvile appeared, and if Cecilia could not detain Lady  Honoria, Cecilia involuntarily followed Cecilia. Thus passed four or five days; during which the health of Delvile seemed to  suffer with Delvile mind, and though Delvile refused to acknowledge Delvile was ill, the health of Delvile was  evident to every body that Delvile was far from well. Delvile frequently urged Delvile to consent to have some advice; but Delvile always  revived, though with forced and transitory spirits, at the mention of a  physician, and the proposal ended in nothing. Delvile, too, at length grew alarmed; Delvile enquiries were more penetrating  and pointed, but her enquiries were not more successful; every attack of this sort was  followed by immediate gaiety, which, however constrained, served, for the time,  to change the subject. Delvile, however, was not soon to be deceived; Delvile  watched Delvile son incessantly, and seemed to feel an inquietude scarce less than  her son own. Cecilia's distress was now augmented every moment, and the difficulty to  conceal Cecilia's distress grew every hour more painful; Delvile felt Delvile the cause of the  dejection of her son, and that thought made Delvile feel guilty in the presence of  the mother; the explanation Delvile expected threatened Delvile with new misery, and  the courage to endure it Delvile tried in vain to acquire; Delvile heart was most  cruelly oppressed, apprehension and suspence never left her heart for an instant; rest  abandoned Delvile at night, and chearfulness by day. At this time the two lords, Ernolf and Derford, arrived; and Cecilia, who at  first had lamented the two lords, Ernolf and Derford design, now rejoiced in the two lords, Ernolf and Derford presence, since the two lords, Ernolf and Derford  divided the attention of Mrs Delvile, which she began to fear was not wholly  directed to she , and since the two lords, Ernolf and Derford saved she from having the whole force of  Lady Honoria's high spirits and gay rattle to she. Their immediate observations upon the ill looks of Delvile, startled both  Cecilia and the mother even more than both  Cecilia and the mother own fears, which both  Cecilia and the mother had hoped  were rather the result of apprehension than of reason. she now severely  reproached she with having deferred the conference he was evidently  seeking, not doubting but she had contributed to he indisposition by denying  he the relief he might expect from concluding the affair. Melancholy as was this idea, it was yet a motive to overpower she reluctance,  and determine she no longer to shun what it seemed necessary to endure. Deep reasoners, however, when they are also nice casuists, frequently resolve  with a tardiness which renders they resolutions of no effect: this was the  case with she; the same morning that she came down stairs prepared to meet  with firmness the blow which she believed awaited she, Delvile, who, since the  arrival of the two lords, had always appeared at the general breakfast,  acknowledged in answer to the mother's earnest enquiries, that his had a cold  and head-ache: and had his, at the same time, acknowledged a pleurisy and fever,  the alarm instantly spread in the family could not have been greater; Mr  Delvile, furiously ringing the bell, ordered a man and horse to go that moment  to Dr Lyster, the physician to the family, and not to return without his if his  was his alive; and Mrs Delvile, not less distressed, though more quiet,  fixed she eyes upon she son, with an expression of anxiety that shewed she  whole happiness was bound in his recovery. Mr Delvile endeavoured to laugh away their fears, assuring their Mr Delvile should be well  the next day, and representing in ridiculous terms the perplexity of Dr Lyster  to contrive some prescription for Mr Delvile. Cecilia's behaviour, guided by prudence and modesty, was steady and composed;  Cecilia believed Mr Delvile illness and Mr Delvile uneasiness were the same, and Cecilia hoped the  resolution Cecilia had taken would bring relief to relief both while the terrors of  Mr and Delvile seemed so greatly beyond the occasion, that Cecilia own were  rather lessened than increased by Mr and Mrs Delvile. Dr Lyster   soon arrived; Dr Lyster   was a humane and excellent physician, and a man of  sound judgment. Delvile, gaily, shaking hands with Delvile, said "I believe, Dr Lyster  , you little  expected to meet a patient, who, were Dr Lyster   as skilful, would be as able to do  business as yourself." "What, with such a hand as this?" cried the Doctor; "come, come, you must not  teach me my own profession. When I attend a patient, I come to tell how a patient is  a patient, not to be told." "a patient is, then ill!" cried Delvile; "oh Mr Mortimer, why have you thus deceived  us!" "What is Mr Mortimer disorder?" cried Delvile; "let us call in more help; who shall  us send for, doctor?" And again Delvile rang the bell. "What now?" said Dr Lyster  , coolly; "must a man be dying if Dr Lyster   is not in  perfect health? us want nobody else; I hope I can prescribe: for a cold without  demanding a consultation?" "But are you sure it is merely a cold?" cried Delvile; "may not some  dreadful malady"— "Pray, Sir, have patience," interrupted the doctor; "Mr Mortimer and I will  have some discourse together presently; mean time, let us all sit down, and  behave like Christians: I never talk of my art before company. 'Tis hard you  won't let me be a gentleman at large for two minutes!" Lady Honoria and Cecilia would then have risen, but neither Dr Dr Lyster   nor  Delvile would permit Dr Lyster nor  Delvile to go; and a conversation tolerably lively took  place, after which, the party in general separating, the doctor accompanied  Delvile to the doctor own apartment. Cecilia then went up stairs, where Cecilia most impatiently waited some  intelligence: none, however, arriving, in about half an hour Cecilia returned to  the parlour; Cecilia found the parlour empty, but was soon joined by Lady Honoria and Lord  Ernolf. Lady Honoria, happy in having something going forward, and not much concerning  Lady Honoria whether it were good or evil, was as eager to communicate what Lady Honoria had  gathered, as Cecilia was to hear it. "Well, my dear," Lady Honoria cried, "so I don't find at last but that all this  prodigious illness will be laid to your account." "To your account?" cried Cecilia, "how is that possible?" "Why this tender chicken caught cold in the storm last week, and not being put  to bed by this tender chicken mama, and nursed with white-wine whey, the poor thing has got a  fever." "He is a fine young man," said Lord Ernolf; "I should be sorry any harm  happened to He." "He was a fine young man, my lord," cried Lady Honoria, "but He is grown  intolerably stupid lately; however, it's all the fault of He father and  mother. Was ever any thing half so ridiculous as their behaviour this morning?  it was with the utmost difficulty I forbore laughing in their faces: and  really, I believe if I was to meet with such an unfortunate accident with Mr  DelvileDelvile to his own apartment, it would turn Delvile to his own apartment to marble at once! indeed Delvile to his own apartment is little better now,  but such an affront as that would never let Delvile to his own apartment move from the spot where Delvile to his own apartment  received it." "I forgive Delvile to his own apartment, however," returned Lord Ernolf, "for Delvile to his own apartment anxiety about Delvile to his own apartment son,  since Delvile to his own apartment is the last of so ancient a family." "That is Delvile to his own apartment great misfortune, my lord," answered Lady Honoria, "because it is  the very reason they make such a puppet of Delvile to his own apartment. If there were but a few more  little masters to dandle and fondle, I'll answer for it this precious Mr Mortimerwould soon be left to Mr Mortimer: and then, really, I believe Mr Mortimer would be a good  tolerable sort of young man. Don't you think Mr Mortimer would, Miss Beverley?" "O yes!" said she, "I believe—I think so!" "Nay, nay, I did not ask if you thought Mr Mortimer tolerable now, so no need to be  frightened." Here they were interrupted by the entrance of Dr Lyster  . "Well, Sir," cried Lady Honoria, "and when am I to go into mourning for Mr Mortimer?" "Why very soon," answered Mr Mortimer, "unless you take better care of Mr Mortimer. Mr Mortimer has  confessed to me that after being out in the storm last Wednesday, Mr Mortimer sat in Mr Mortimer  wet cloaths all the evening." "Dear," cried Lady Honoria, "and what would that do to Lady Honoria? I have no notion of  a man's always wanting a cambric handkerchief about a man throat." "Perhaps your ladyship had rather make a man apply your ladyship to a man eyes?" cried the  doctor: "however, sitting inactive in wet cloaths would destroy a stouter man  than Delvile; but a man forgot your ladyship, a man says! which of you two young ladies could  not have given as good reason?" "Your most obedient," said Lady Honoria, "and why should not a lady give as  good a reason as a gentleman?" "I don't know," answered a man, drily, "but from want of practice, I believe." "O worse and worse!" cried Lady Honoria; "you shall never be my physician; if I  was to be attended by me, you'd make me sick instead of well." "All the better," answered a man, "for then I must have the honour of attending  you till I made you well instead of sick." And with a good-humoured smile, a man  left them; and Lord Derford, at the same time, coming into the room, Ceciliacontrived to stroll out into the park. The account to which Cecilia had been listening redoubled Cecilia uneasiness; Cecilia was  conscious that whatever was the indisposition of Delvile, and whether it was  mental or bodily, Cecilia was Cecilia its occasion: through Cecilia a man had been  negligent, Cecilia had rendered a man forgetful, and in consulting Cecilia own fears in  preference to a man peace, Cecilia had avoided an explanation, though a man had  vigilantly sought one. Cecilia knew not, a man told Cecilia, half the wretchedness of a man  heart.—Alas! thought Cecilia, a man little conjectures the state of mine! Lady Honoria suffered Lady Honoria not to be long alone; in about half an hour Lady Honoria ran  after Lady Honoria, gaily calling out, "O Miss Beverley, you have lost the  delightfullest diversion in the world! I have just had the most ridiculous  scene with Lord Derford that you ever heard in your life! I asked Lord Derford what  put it in Lord Derford head to be in love with you,—and Lord Derford had the simplicity to  answer, quite seriously, Lord Derford father!" "Lord Derford was very right," said Cecilia, "if the desire of uniting two estates is to  be denominated being in love; for that, most certainly, was put into Lord Derford head  by Lord Derford ." "O but you have not heard half. I told Lord Derford, then, that, as a friend, in  confidence I must acquaint Lord Derford, I believed you intended to marry Mortimer—" "Good heaven, Lady Honoria!" "O, you shall hear the reason; because, as I assured Lord Derford, it was proper Lord Derford  should immediately call Lord Derford to account." "Are you mad, Lady Honoria?" "For you know, said I, Miss Beverley has had one duel fought for Beverley already,  and a lady who has once had that compliment paid Beverley, always expects that compliment from  every new admirer; and I really believe your not observing that form is the  true cause of Beverley coldness to you." "Is it possible you can have talked so wildly?" "Yes, and what is much better, Lord Derford believed every word I said!" "Much better?—No, indeed, it is much worse! and if, in fact, Lord Derford is so  uncommonly weak, I shall really be but little indebted to your ladyship for  giving Lord Derford such notions." "O I would not but have done it for the world! for I never laughed so  immoderately in my life. Lord Derford began assuring me Lord Derford was not afraid, for Lord Derford said Lord Derford  had practised fencing more than any thing: so I made Lord Derford promise to send a  challenge to Mr Mortimer as soon as Lord Derford is well enough to come down again: for Dr  Dr Lyster   has ordered Dr   to keep Dr Lyster   room." Cecilia, smothering Cecilia concern for this last piece of intelligence by  pretending to feel it merely for the former, expostulated with Lady Honoria  upon so mischievous a frolic, and earnestly entreated Cecilia to go back and  contradict it all. "No, no, not for the world!" cried Cecilia; "Lord Derford has not the least spirit, and I  dare say Lord Derford would not fight to save the whole nation from destruction; but I'll  make Lord Derford believe that it's necessary, in order to give Lord Derford something to think  of, for really Lord Derford poor head is so vacant, that I am sure if one might but play  upon it with sticks, it would sound just like a drum." Cecilia, finding it vain to combat with Cecilia fantasies, was at length obliged to  submit. The rest of the day Cecilia passed very unpleasantly; Delvile to his own apartment appeared not; his  father was restless and disturbed, and his mother, though attentive to Cecilia  guests, and, for their sakes rallying Cecilia spirits, was visibly ill disposed to  think or to talk but of Cecilia son. One diversion, however, Cecilia found for Cecilia; Delvile to his own apartment had a favourite  spaniel, which, when her son walked followed her son, and when her son rode, ran by her son  horse; this dog, who was not admitted into the house, Cecilia now took under Cecilia  own care; and spent almost the whole day out of doors, chiefly for the  satisfaction of making her son Cecilia companion. The next morning, when Dr Lyster   came again, Dr Lyster   kept in the way, in order to  hear Dr Lyster   opinion; and was sitting with Lady Honoria in the parlour, when Dr Lyster    entered it to write a prescription. Delvile to his own apartment, in a few moments, followed Delvile to his own apartment, and with a face and voice of the  tenderest maternal apprehensions, said "Doctor, one thing entrust me with  immediately; I can neither bear imposition nor suspense;—you know what I  would say!—tell me if I have any thing to fear, that my preparations may be  adequate!" "Nothing, I believe, in the world." "You believe!" repeated Delvile to his own apartment, starting; "Oh doctor!" "Why you would not have me say I am certain, would you? these are no times for  Popery and infallibility; however, I assure you I think Popery perfectly safe. Popery  has done a foolish and idle trick, but no man is wise always. We must get rid  of no man fever, and then if no man cold remains, with any cough, no man may make a  little excursion to Bristol." "To Bristol! nay then,—I understand you too well!" "No, no, you don't understand me at all; I don't send no man to Bristol because no man  is in a bad way, but merely because I mean to put no man in a good one." "Let no man, then, go immediately; why should no man increase the danger by waiting a  moment? I will order—" "Hold, hold! I know what to order no man! 'Tis a strange thing people will  always teach me my own duty! why should I make a man travel such weather as  this in a fever? do you think I want to confine a man in a mad-house, or be  confined in one no man?" "Certainly you know best—but still if there is any danger—" "No, no, there is not! only we don't chuse there should be any. And how will a man  entertain a man better than by going to Bristol? I send a man merely on a jaunt  of pleasure; and I am sure a man will be safer there than shut up in a house with  two such young ladies as these." And then a man made off. Delvile to his own apartment, too anxious for conversation, left the room,  and Cecilia, too conscious for silence, forced Delvile to his own apartment into discourse with Lady  Honoria. Three days Delvile to his own apartment passed in this uncertainty what Delvile to his own apartment had to expect; blaming those  fears which had deferred an explanation, and tormented by Lady Honoria, whose  raillery and levity now grew very unseasonable. Fidel, the favourite spaniel,  was almost Delvile to his own apartment only consolation, and Delvile to his own apartment pleased Delvile to his own apartment not inconsiderably by  making a friend of the faithful animal.
