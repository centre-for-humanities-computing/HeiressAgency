 Cecilia, upon her return home, heard with some surprise that Mr and Mrs Harrel  were by themselves in the drawing-room; and, while she was upon the stairs, Mrs  Harrel ran out, calling eagerly, "Is that my brother?" Before she could make an answer, Mr Harrel, in the same impatient tone,  exclaimed, "Is it Mr Arnott?" "No;" said Cecilia, "did you expect him so late?" "Expect him? Yes," answered Mr Harrel, "I have expected him the whole evening,  and cannot conceive what he has done with himself." "'Tis abominably provoking," said Mrs Harrel, "that he should be out of the way  just now when he is wanted. However, I dare say to-morrow will do as well." "I don't know that," cried Mr Harrel. "Reeves is such a wretch that I am sure  he will give me all the trouble in his power." Here Mr Arnott entered; and Mrs Harrel called out "O brother, we have been  distressed for you cruelly; we have had a man here who has plagued Mr Harrel to  death, and we wanted you sadly to speak to him." "I should have been very glad," said Mr Arnott, "to have been of any use, and  perhaps it is not yet too late; who is the man?" "O," cried Mr Harrel, carelessly, "only a fellow from that rascally taylor who  has been so troublesome to me lately. He has had the impudence, because I did  not pay him the moment he was pleased to want his money, to put the bill into  the hands of one Reeves, a griping attorney, who has been here this evening,  and thought proper to talk to me pretty freely. I can tell the gentleman I  shall not easily forget his impertinence! however, I really wish mean time I  could get rid of him." "How much is the bill, Sir?" said Mr Arnott. "Why it's rather a round sum; but I don't know how it is, one's bills mount up  before one is aware: those fellows charge such confounded sums for tape and  buckram; I hardly know what I have had of him, and yet he has run me up a bill  of between three and four hundred pound." Here there was a general silence; till Mrs Harrel said "Brother, can't you be  so good as to lend us the money? Mr Harrel says he can pay it again very soon." "O yes, very soon," said Mr Harrel, "for I shall receive a great deal of money  in a little time; I only want to stop this fellow's mouth for the present." "Suppose I go and talk with him?" said Mr Arnott. "O, he's a brute, a stock!" cried Mr Harrel, "nothing but the money will  satisfy him: he will hear no reason; one might as well talk to a stone." Mr Arnott now looked extremely distressed; but upon his sister's warmly  pressing him not to lose any time, he gently said, "If this person will but  wait a week or two, I should be extremely glad, for really just now I cannot  take up so much money, without such particular loss and inconvenience, that I  hardly know how to do it:—but yet, if he will not be appeased, he must  certainly have it." "Appeased?" cried Mr Harrel, "you might as well appease the sea in a storm! he  is hard as iron." Mr Arnott then, forcing a smile, though evidently in much uneasiness, said he  would not fail to raise the money the next morning, and was taking his leave,  when Cecilia, shocked that such tenderness and good-nature should be thus  grossly imposed upon, hastily begged to speak with Mrs Harrel, and taking her  into another room, said, "I beseech you, my dear friend, let not your worthy  brother suffer by his generosity; permit me in the present exigence to assist  Mr Harrel: my having such a sum advanced can be of no consequence; but I should  grieve indeed that your brother, who so nobly understands the use of money,  should take it up at any particular disadvantage." "You are vastly kind," said Mrs Harrel, "and I will run and speak to them about  it: but which ever of you lends the money, Mr Harrel has assured me he shall  pay it very soon." She then returned with the proposition. Mr Arnott strongly opposed it, but Mr  Harrel seemed rather to prefer it, yet spoke so confidently of his speedy  payment, that he appeared to think it a matter of little importance from which  he accepted it. A generous contest ensued between Mr Arnott and Cecilia, but as  she was very earnest, she at length prevailed, and settled to go herself the  next morning into the city, in order to have the money advanced by Mr Briggs,  who had the management of her fortune entirely to himself, her other guardians  never interfering in the executive part of her affairs. This arranged, they all retired. And then, with encreasing astonishment, Cecilia reflected upon the ruinous  levity of Mr Harrel, and the blind security of his wife; she saw in their  situation danger the most alarming, and in the behaviour of Mr Harrel  selfishness the most inexcusable; such glaring injustice to his creditors, such  utter insensibility to his friends, took from her all wish of assisting him,  though the indignant compassion with which she saw the easy generosity of Mr  Arnott so frequently abused, had now, for his sake merely, induced her to  relieve him. She resolved, however, as soon as the present difficulty was surmounted, to  make another attempt to open the eyes of Mrs Harrel to the evils which so  apparently threatened her, and press her to exert all her influence with her  husband, by means both of example and advice, to retrench his expences before  it should be absolutely too late to save him from ruin. She determined also at the same time dial she applied for the money requisite  for this debt, to take up enough for discharging her own bill at the  bookseller's, and putting in execution her plan of assisting the Hills. The next morning she arose early, and attended by her servant, set out for the  house of Mr Briggs, purposing, as the weather was clear and frosty, to walk  through Oxford Road, and then put herself into a chair; and hoping to return to  Mr Harrel's by the usual hour of breakfast. She had not proceeded far, before she saw a mob gathering, and the windows of  almost all the houses filling with spectators. She desired her servant to  enquire what this meant, and was informed that the people were assembling to  see some malefactors pass by in their way to Tyburn. Alarmed at this intelligence from the fear of meeting the unhappy criminals,  she hastily turned down die next street, but found that also filling with  people who were running to the scene she was trying to avoid: encircled thus  every way, she applied to a maidservant who was standing at the door of a large  house, and begged leave to step in till the mob was gone by. The maid  immediately consented, and she waited here while she sent her man for a chair. He soon arrived with one; but just as she returned to the street door, a  gentleman, who was hastily entering the house, standing back to let her pass,  suddenly exclaimed, "Miss Beverley!" and looking at him, she perceived young  Delvile. "I cannot stop an instant," cried she, running down the steps, "lest the crowd  should prevent the chair from going on." "Will you not first," said he, handing her in, "tell me what news you have  heard?" "News?" repeated she. "No, I have heard none!" "You will only, then, laugh at me for those officious offers you did so well to  reject?" "I know not what offers you mean!" "They were indeed superfluous, and therefore I wonder not you have forgotten  them. Shall I tell the chairmen whither to go?" "To Mr Briggs. But I cannot imagine what you mean." "To Mr Briggs!" repeated he, "O live for ever French beads and Bristol stones!  fresh offers may perhaps be made there, impertinent, officious, and useless as  mine!" He then told her servant the direction, and, making his bow, went into the  house she had just quitted. Cecilia, extremely amazed by this short, but unintelligible conversation, would  again have called upon him to explain his meaning, but found the crowd  encreasing so fast that she could not venture to detain the chair, which with  difficulty made its way to the adjoining streets: but her surprize at what had  passed so entirely occupied her, that when she stopt at the house of Mr Briggs,  she had almost forgotten what had brought her thither. The foot-boy, who came to the door, told her that his master was at home, but  not well. She desired he might be acquainted that she wished to speak to him upon  business, and would wait upon him again at any hour when he thought he should  be able to see her. The boy returned with an answer that she might call again the next week. Cecilia, knowing that so long a delay would destroy all the kindness of her  intention, determined to write to him for the money, and therefore went into  the parlour, and desired to have pen and ink. The boy, after making her wait some time in a room without any fire, brought  her a pen and a little ink in a broken tea-cup, saying "Master begs you won't  spirt it about, for he's got no more; and all our blacking's as good as gone." "Blacking?" repeated Cecilia. "Yes, Miss; when Master's shoes are blacked, we commonly gets a little drap of  fresh ink." Cecilia promised to be careful, but desired him to fetch her a sheet of paper. "Law, Miss," cried the boy, with a grin, "I dare say master'd as soon give you  a bit of his nose! howsever, I'll go ax." In a few minutes he again returned, and brought in his hand a slate and a black  lead pencil; "Miss," cried he, "Master says how you may write upon this, for he  supposes you've no great matters to say." Cecilia, much astonished at this extreme parsimony, was obliged to consent, but  as the point of the pencil was very blunt, desired the boy to get her a knife  that she might cut it. He obeyed, but said "Pray Miss, take care it ben't  known, for master don't do such a thing once in a year, and if he know'd I'd  got you the knife, he'd go nigh to give me a good polt of the head." Cecilia then wrote upon the slate her desire to be informed in what manner she  should send him her receipt for 600 pounds, which she begged to have instantly  advanced. The boy came back grinning, and holding up his hands, and said, "Miss, there's  a fine piece of work upstairs! Master's in a peck of troubles; but he says how  he'll come down, if you'll stay till he's got his things on." "Does he keep his bed, then? I hope I have not made him rise?" "No, Miss, he don't keep his bed, only he must get ready, for he wears no great  matters of cloaths when he's alone. You are to know, Miss," lowering his voice,  "that that day as he went abroad with our sweep's cloaths on, he comed home in  sich a pickle you never see! I believe somebody'd knocked him in the kennel; so  does Moll; but don't you say as I told you! He's been special bad ever since.  Moll and I was as glad as could be, because he's so plaguy sharp; for, to let  you know, Miss, he's so near, it's partly a wonder how he lives at all: and yet  he's worth a power of money, too." "Well, well," said Cecilia, not very desirous to encourage his forwardness, "if  I want any thing, I'll call for you." The boy, however, glad to tell his tale, went on. "Our Moll won't stay with him above a week longer, Miss, because she says how  she can get nothing to eat, but just some old stinking salt meat, that's stayed  in the butcher's shop so long, it would make a horse sick to look at it. But  Moll's pretty nice; howsever, Miss, to let you know, we don't get a good meal  so often as once a quarter! why this last week we ha'n't had nothing at all but  some dry musty red herrings; so you may think, Miss, we're kept pretty sharp!" He was now interrupted by hearing Mr Briggs coming down the stairs, upon which,  abruptly breaking off his complaints, he held up his finger to his nose in  token of secrecy, and ran hastily into the kitchen. The appearance of Mr Briggs was by no means rendered more attractive by illness  and negligence of dress. He had on a flannel gown and night cap; his black  beard, of many days' growth, was long and grim, and upon his nose and one of  his cheeks was a large patch of brown paper, which, as he entered the room, he  held on with both his hands. Cecilia made many apologies for having disturbed him, and some civil enquiries  concerning his health. "Ay, ay," cried he, pettishly, "bad enough: all along of that trumpery  masquerade; wish I had not gone! Fool for my pains." "When were you taken ill, Sir?" "Met with an accident; got a fall, broke my head, like to have lost my wig.  Wish the masquerade at old Nick! thought it would cost nothing, or would not  have gone. Warrant sha'n't get me so soon to another!" "Did you fall in going home, Sir?" "Ay, ay, plump in the kennel; could hardly get out of it; felt myself a going,  was afraid to tear my cloaths, knew the rascal would make me pay for them, so  by holding up the old sack, come bolt on my face! off pops my wig; could not  tell what to do; all as dark as pitch!" "Did not you call for help?" "Nobody by but scrubs, knew they would not help for nothing. Scrawled out as I  could, groped about for my wig, found it at last, all soused in the mud; stuck  to my head like Turner's cerate." "I hope, then, you got into a hackney coach?" "What for? to make things worse? was not bad enough, hay?—must pay two  shillings beside?" "But how did you find yourself when you got home, Sir?" "How? why wet as muck; my head all bumps, my cheek all cut, my nose big as two!  forced to wear a plaister; half ruined in vinegar. Got a great cold; put me in  a fever; never been well since." "But have you had no advice, Sir? Should not you send for a physician?" "What to do, hay? fill me with jallop? can get it myself, can't I? Had one  once; was taken very bad, thought should have popt off; began to flinch, sent  for the doctor, proved nothing but a cheat! cost me a guinea, gave it at fourth  visit, and he never came again!—-warrant won't have no more!" Then perceiving upon the table some dust from the black lead pencil, "What's  here?" cried he, angrily, "who's been cutting the pencil? wish they were  hanged; suppose it's the boy; deserves to be horsewhipped: give him a good  banging." Cecilia immediately cleared him, by acknowledging she had herself been the  culprit. "Ay, ay," cried he, "thought as much all the time! guessed how it was; nothing  but ruin and waste; sending for money, nobody knows why; wanting 600  pounds—what to do? throw it in the dirt? Never heard the like! Sha'n't have  it, promise you that," nodding his head, "shan't have no such thing!" "Sha'n't have it?" cried Cecilia, much surprised, "why not, Sir?" "Keep it for your husband; get you one soon: won't have no juggling. Don't be  in a hurry; one in my eye." Cecilia then began a very earnest expostulation, assuring him she really wanted  the money, for an occasion which would not admit of delay. Her remonstrances,  however, he wholly disregarded, telling her that girls knew nothing of the  value of money, and ought not to be trusted with it; that he would not hear of  such extravagance, and was resolved not to advance her a penny. Cecilia was  both provoked and confounded by a refusal so unexpected, and as she thought  herself bound in honour to Mr Harrel not to make known the motive of her  urgency, she was for some time totally silenced: till recollecting her account  with the bookseller, she determined to rest her plea upon that, persuaded that  he could not, at least, deny her money to pay her own bills. He heard her,  however, with the utmost contempt; "Books?" he cried, "what do you want with  books? do no good; all lost time; words get no cash." She informed him his  admonitions were now too late, as she had already received them, and must  therefore necessarily pay for them. "No, no," cried he, "send 'em back, that's  best; keep no such rubbish, won't turn to account; do better without 'em."  "That, Sir, will be impossible, for I have had them some time, and cannot  expect the bookseller to take them again." "Must, must," cried he, "can't help  himself; glad to have 'em too. Are but a minor, can't be made pay a farthing."  Cecilia with much indignation heard such fraud recommended, and told him she  could by no means consent to follow his advice. But she soon found, to her  utter amazement, that he steadily refused to give her any other, or to bestow  the slightest attention upon her expostulations, sturdily saying that her uncle  had left her a noble estate, and he would take care to see it put in proper  hands, by getting her a good and careful husband. "I have no intention, no wish, Sir," cried she, "to break into the income or  estate left me by my uncle; on the contrary, I hold them sacred, and think  myself bound in conscience never to live beyond them: but the L10,000  bequeathed me by my Father, I regard as more peculiarly my own property, and  therefore think myself at liberty to dispose of it as I please." "What," cried he, in a rage, "make it over to a scrubby bookseller! give it up  for an old pot-hook? no, no, won't suffer it; sha'n't be, sha'n't be, I say! if  you want some books, go to Moorfields, pick up enough at an old stall; get 'em  at two pence a-piece; dear enough, too." Cecilia for some time hoped he was merely indulging his strange and sordid  humour by an opposition that was only intended to teize her; but she soon found  herself extremely mistaken: he was immoveable in obstinacy, as he was  incorrigible in avarice; he neither troubled himself with enquiries nor  reasoning, but was contented with refusing her as a child might be refused, by  peremptorily telling her she did not know what she wanted, and therefore should  not have what she asked. And with this answer, after all that she could urge, she was compelled to leave  the house, as he complained that his brown paper plaister wanted fresh dipping  in vinegar, and he could stay talking no longer. The disgust with which this behaviour filled her, was doubled by the shame and  concern of returning to the Harrels with her promise unperformed; she  deliberated upon every method that occurred to her of still endeavouring to  serve them, but could suggest nothing, except trying to prevail upon Mr Delvile  to interfere in her favour. She liked not, indeed, the office of solicitation  to so haughty a man, but, having no other expedient, her repugnance gave way to  her generosity, and she ordered the chairmen to carry her to St James's Square.
