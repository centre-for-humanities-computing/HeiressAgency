 Lady Margaret's town house was in Soho Square; and scarcely had Cecilia entered  it, before her desire to speed her departure, made her send a note to each of  her guardians, acquainting them of her arrival, and begging, if possible, to  see them the next day. She had soon the two following answers: To Miss Cecilia Beverley,——These November 8, 1779. Miss,—Received yours  of the same date; can't come tomorrow. Will, Wednesday the 10th.—Am, &c.,  Jno. Briggs. Miss Cecilia Beverley To Miss Beverley. Mr Delvile has too many affairs of importance upon his hands, to make any  appointment till he has deliberated how to arrange them. Mr Delvile will  acquaint Miss Beverley when it shall be in his power to see her. St James's-square, Nov 8. These characteristic letters, which at another time might have diverted  Cecilia, now merely served to torment her. She was eager to quit town, she was  more eager to have her meeting with Mr Delvile over, who, oppressive to her  even when he meant to be kind, she foresaw, now he was in wrath, would be  imperious even to rudeness. Desirous, however, to make one interview suffice  for both, and to settle whatever business might remain unfinished by letters,  she again wrote to Mr Briggs, whom she had not spirits to encounter without  absolute necessity, and informing him of Mr Delvile's delay, begged he would  not trouble himself to call till he heard from her again. Two days passed without any message from them; they were spent chiefly alone,  and very uncomfortably, Mr Monckton being content to see little of her, while  he knew she saw nothing of any body else. On the third morning, weary of her  own thoughts, weary of Lady Margaret's ill-humoured looks, and still more weary  of Miss Bennet's parasitical conversation, she determined, for a little relief  to the heaviness of her mind, to go to her bookseller, and look over and order  into the country such new publications as seemed to promise her any pleasure. She sent therefore, for a chair, and glad to have devised for herself any  amusement, set out in it immediately. Upon entering the shop, she saw the Bookseller engaged in close conference with  a man meanly dressed, and much muffled up, who seemed talking to him with  uncommon earnestness, and just as she was approaching, said, "To terms I am  indifferent, for writing is no labour to me; on the contrary, it is the first  delight of my life, and therefore, and not for dirty pelf, I wish to make it my  profession." The speech struck Cecilia, but the voice struck her more, it was Belfield's!  and her amazement was so great, that she stopt short to look at him, without  heeding a man who attended her, and desired to know her commands. The bookseller now perceiving her, came forward, and Belfield, turning to see  who interrupted them, started as if a spectre had crossed his eyes, slapped his  hat over his face, and hastily went out of the shop. Cecilia checking her inclination to speak to him, from observing his eagerness  to escape her, soon recollected her own errand, and employed herself in looking  over new books. Her surprize, however, at a change so sudden in the condition of this young  man, and at a declaration of a passion for writing, so opposite to all the  sentiments which he had professed at their late meeting in the cottage,  awakened in her a strong curiosity to be informed of his situation; and after  putting aside some books which she desired to have packed up for her, she asked  if the gentleman who had just left the shop, and who, she found by what he had  said, was an Author, had written anything that was published with his name? "No, ma'am," answered the Bookseller, "nothing of any consequence; he is known,  however, to have written several things that have appeared as anonymous; and I  fancy, now, soon, we shall see something considerable from him." "He is about some great work, then?" "Why no, not exactly that, perhaps, at present; we must feel our way, with some  little smart jeu d'esprit before we undertake a great work. But he is a very  great genius, and I doubt not will produce something extraordinary." "Whatever he produces," said Cecilia, "as I have now chanced to see him, I  shall be glad you will, at any time, send to me." "Certainly, ma'am; but it must be among other things, for he does not chuse,  just now to be known; and it is a rule in our business never to tell people's  names when they desire to be secret. He is a little out of cash, just now, as  you may suppose by his appearance, so instead of buying books, he comes to sell  them. However, he has taken a very good road to bring himself home again, for  we pay very handsomely for things of any merit, especially if they deal smartly  in a few touches of the times." Cecilia chose not to risk any further questions, lest her knowledge of him  should be suspected, but got into her chair, and returned to Lady Margaret's. The sight of Belfield reminded her not only of himself; the gentle Henrietta  again took her place in her memory, whence her various distresses and suspences  had of late driven from it everybody but Delvile, and those whom Delvile  brought into it. But her regard for that amiable girl, though sunk in the busy  scenes of her calamitous uncertainties, was only sunk in her own bosom, and  ready, upon their removal, to revive with fresh vigour. She was now indeed more  unhappy than even in the period of her forgetfulness, yet her mind, was no  longer filled with the restless turbulence of hope, which still more than  despondency unfitted it for thinking of others. This remembrance thus awakened, awakened also a desire of renewing the  connection so long neglected. All scruples concerning Delvile had now lost  their foundation, since the doubts from which they arose were both explained  and removed: she was certain alike of his indifference to Henrietta, and his  separation from herself; she knew that nothing was to be feared from painful or  offensive rivalry, and she resolved, therefore, to lose no time in seeking the  first pleasure to which since her disappointment she had voluntarily looked  forward. Early in the evening, she told Lady Margaret she was going out for an hour or  two, and sending again for a chair, was carried to Portland-street. She enquired for Miss Belfield, and was shewn into a parlour, where she found  her drinking tea with her mother, and Mr Hobson, their landlord. Henrietta almost screamed at her sight, from a sudden impulse of joy and  surprize, and, running up to her, flung her arms round her neck, and embraced  her with the most rapturous emotion: but then, drawing back with a look of  timidity and shame, she bashfully apologized for her freedom, saying, "Indeed,  dearest Miss Beverley, it is no want of respect, but I am so very glad to see  you it makes me quite forget myself!" Cecilia, charmed at a reception so ingenuously affectionate, soon satisfied her  doubting diffidence by the warmest thanks that she had preserved so much regard  for her, and by doubling the kindness with which she returned her caresses. "Mercy on me, madam," cried Mrs Belfield, who during this time had been busily  employed in sweeping the hearth, wiping some slops upon the table, and  smoothing her handkerchief and apron, "why the girl's enough to smother you.  Henny, how can you be so troublesome? I never saw you behave in this way  before." "Miss Beverley, madam," said Henrietta, again retreating, "is so kind as to  pardon me, and I was so much surprised at seeing her, that I hardly knew what I  was about." "The young ladies, ma'am," said Mr Hobson, "have a mighty way of saluting one  another till such time as they get husbands: and then I'll warrant you they can  meet without any salutation at all. That's my remark, at least, and what I've  seen of the world has set me upon making it." This speech led Cecilia to check, however artless, the tenderness of her  fervent young friend, whom she was much teized by meeting in such company, but  who seemed not to dare understand the frequent looks which she gave her  expressive of a wish to be alone with her. "Come, ladies," continued the facetious Mr Hobson, "what if we were all to sit  down, and have a good dish of tea? and suppose, Mrs Belfield, you was to order  us a fresh round of toast and butter? do you think the young ladies here would  have any objection? and what if we were to have a little more water in the  tea-kettle? not forgetting a little more tea in the teapot. What I say is this,  let us all be comfortable; that's my notion of things." "And a very good notion too," said Mrs Belfield, "for you who have nothing to  vex you. Ah, ma'am, you have heard, I suppose, about my son? gone off! nobody  knows where! left that lord's house, where he might have lived like a king, and  gone out into the wide world nobody knows for what!" "Indeed?" said Cecilia, who, from seeing him in London concluded he was again  with his family, "and has he not acquainted you where he is?" "No, ma'am, no," cried Mrs Belfield, "he's never once told me where he is gone,  nor let me know the least about the matter, for if I did I would not taste a  dish of tea again for a twelvemonth till I saw him get back again to that  lord's! and I believe in my heart there's never such another in the three  kingdoms, for he has sent here after him I dare say a score of times. And no  wonder, for I will take upon me to say he won't find his fellow in a hurry,  Lord as he is." "As to his being a Lord," said Mr Hobson, "I am one of them that lay no great  stress upon that, unless he has got a good long purse of his own, and then, to  be sure, a Lord's no bad thing. But as to the matter of saying Lord such a one,  how d'ye do? and Lord such a one, what do you want? and such sort of  compliments, why in my mind, it's a mere nothing, in comparison of a good  income. As to your son, ma'am, he did not go the right way to work. He should  have begun with business, and gone into pleasure afterwards and if he had but  done that, I'll be bold to say we might have had him at this very minute  drinking tea with us over this fireside." "My son, Sir," said Mrs Belfield, rather angrily, "was another sort of a person  than a person of business: he always despised it from a child, and come of it  what may, I am sure he was born to be a gentleman." "As to his despising business," said Mr Hobson, very contemptuously, "why so  much the worse, for business is no such despiseable thing. And if he had been  brought up behind a counter, instead of dangling after these same Lords, why he  might have had a house of his own over his head, and been as good a man as  myself." "A house over his head?" said Mrs Belfield, "why he might have had what he  would, and have done what he would, if he had but followed my advice, and put  himself a little forward. I have told him a hundred times to ask some of those  great people he lived amongst for a place at court, for I know they've so many  they hardly know what to do with them, and it was always my design from the  beginning that he should be something of a great man; but I never could  persuade him, though, for anything I know, as I have often told him, if he had  but had a little courage he might have been an Ambassador by this time. And  now, all of a sudden, to be gone nobody knows where!"— "I am sorry, indeed," said Cecilia, who knew not whether most to pity or wonder  at her blind folly; "but I doubt not you will hear of him soon." "As to being an Ambassador, ma'am," said Mr Hobson, "it's talking quite out of  character. Those sort of great people keep things of that kind for their own  poor relations and cousins. What I say is this; a man's best way is to take  care of himself. The more those great people see you want them, the less they  like your company. Let every man be brought up to business, and then when he's  made his fortune, he may walk with his hat on. Why now there was your friend,  ma'am," turning to Cecilia, "that shot out his brains without paying any body a  souse; pray how was that being more genteel than standing behind a counter, and  not owing a shilling?" "Do you think a young lady," cried Mrs Belfield warmly, "can bear to hear of  such a thing as standing behind a counter? I am sure if my son had ever done  it, I should not expect any lady would so much as look at him, And yet, though  I say it, she might look a good while, and not see many such persons, let her  look where she pleased. And then he has such a winning manner into the bargain,  that I believe in my heart there's never a lady in the land could say no to  him. And yet he has such a prodigious shyness, I never could make him own he  had so much as asked the question. And what lady can begin first?" "Why no," said Mr Hobson, "that would be out of character another way. Now my  notion is this; let every man be agreeable! and then he may ask what lady he  pleases. And when he's a mind of a lady, he should look upon a frown or two as  nothing; for the ladies frown in courtship as a thing of course; it's just like  a man swearing at a coachman; why he's not a bit more in a passion, only he  thinks he sha'n't be minded without it." "Well, for my part," said Mrs Belfield, "I am sure if I was a young lady, and  most especially if I was a young lady of fortune, and all that, I should like a  modest young gentleman, such as my son, for example, better by half than a bold  swearing young fellow, that would make a point to have me whether I would or  no." "Ha! Ha! Ha!" cried Mr Hobson; "but the young ladies are not of that way of  thinking; they are all for a little life and spirit. Don't I say right, young  ladies?" Cecilia, who could not but perceive that these speeches was levelled at  herself, felt offended and tired; and finding she had no chance of any private  conversation with Henrietta, arose to take leave: but while she stopped in the  passage to enquire when she could see her alone, a footman knocked at the door,  who, having asked if Mr Belfield lodged there, and been answered in the  affirmative; begged to know whether Miss Beverley was then in the house? Cecilia, much surprised, went forward, and told him who she was. "I have been, madam," said he, "with a message to you at Mr Monckton's, in  Soho-Square: but nobody knew where you was; and Mr Monckton came out and spoke  to me himself, and said that all he could suppose was that you might be at this  house. So he directed me to come here." "And from whom, Sir, is your message?" "From the honourable Mr Delvile, madam, in St James's-Square. He desires to  know if you shall be at home on Saturday morning, the day after to-morrow, and  whether you can appoint Mr Briggs to meet him by twelve o'clock exactly, as he  sha'n't be able to stay above three minutes." Cecilia gave an answer as cold as the message; that she would be in Soho-Square  at the time he mentioned, and acquaint Mr Briggs of his intention. The footman then went away; and Henrietta told her, that if she could call some  morning she might perhaps contrive to be alone with her, and added, "indeed I  wish much to see you, if you could possibly do me so great an honour; for I am  very miserable, and have nobody to tell so! Ah, Miss Beverley! you that have so  many friends, and that deserve as many again, you little know what a hard thing  it is to have none!—but my brother's strange disappearing has half broke our  hearts!" Cecilia was beginning a consolatory speech, in which she meant to give her  private assurances of his health and safety, when she was interrupted by Mr  Albany, who came suddenly into the passage. Henrietta received him with a look of pleasure, and enquired why he had so long  been absent; but, surprised by the sight of Cecilia, he exclaimed, without  answering her, "why didst thou fail me? why appoint me to a place thou wert  quitting thyself?—thou thing of fair professions! thou inveigler of esteem!  thou vain, delusive promiser of pleasure!" "You condemn me too hastily," said Cecilia; "if I failed in my promise, it was  not owing to caprice or insincerity, but to a real and bitter misfortune which  incapacitated me from keeping it. I shall soon, however,—nay, I am already at  your disposal, if you have any commands for me." "I have always," answered he, "commands for the rich, for I have always  compassion for the poor." "Come to me, then, at Mr Monckton's in Soho-Square," cried she, and hastened  into her chair, impatient to end a conference which she saw excited the wonder  of the servants, and which also now drew out from the parlour Mr Hobson and Mrs  Belfield. She then kissed her hand to Henrietta, and ordered the chairmen to  carry her home. It had not been without difficulty that she had restrained herself from  mentioning what she knew of Belfield, when she found his mother and sister in a  state of such painful uncertainty concerning him. But her utter ignorance of  his plans, joined to her undoubted knowledge of his wish of concealment, made  her fear doing mischief by officiousness, and think it wiser not to betray what  she had seen of him, till better informed of his own views and intentions. Yet,  willing to shorten a suspence so uneasy to them, she determined to entreat Mr  Monckton would endeavour to find him out, and acquaint him with their anxiety. That gentleman, when she returned to his house, was in a state of mind by no  means enviable. Missing her at tea, he had asked Miss Bennet where she was, and  hearing she had not left word, he could scarce conceal his chagrin. Knowing,  however, how few were her acquaintances in town, he soon concluded she was with  Miss Belfield, but, not satisfied with sending Mr Delvile's messenger after  her, he privately employed one in whom he trusted for himself, to make  enquiries at the house without saying whence he came. But though this man was returned, and he knew her safety, he still felt  alarmed; he had flattered himself, from the length of time in which she had now  done nothing without consulting him, she would scarce even think of any action  without his previous concurrence. And he had hoped, by a little longer use, to  make his counsel become necessary, which he knew to be a very short step from  rendering it absolute. Nor was he well pleased to perceive, by this voluntary excursion, a struggle to  cast off her sadness, and a wish to procure herself entertainment: it was not  that he desired her misery, but he was earnest that all relief from it should  spring from himself: and though far from displeased that Delvile should lose  his sovereignty over her thoughts, he was yet of opinion that, till his own  liberty was restored, he had less to apprehend from grief indulged, than grief  allayed; one could but lead her to repining retirement, the other might guide  her to a consolatory rival. He well knew, however, it was as essential to his cause to disguise his  disappointments as his expectations, and, certain that by pleasing alone he had  any chance of acquiring power, he cleared up when Cecilia returned, who as  unconscious of feeling, as of owing any subjection to him, preserved  uncontrolled the right of acting for herself, however desirous and glad of  occasional instruction. She told him where she had been, and related her meeting Belfield, and the  unhappiness of his friends, and hinted her wish that he could be informed what  they suffered. Mr Monckton, eager to oblige her, went instantly in search of  him, and returning to supper, told her he had traced him through the  Bookseller, who had not the dexterity to parry his artful enquiries, and had  actually appointed him to breakfast in Soho-Square the next morning. He had found him, he said, writing, but in high spirits and good humour. He had  resisted, for a while, his invitation on account of his dress, all his clothes  but the very coat which he had on being packed up and at his mother's: but,  when laughed at by Mr Monckton for still retaining some foppery, he gaily  protested what remained of it should be extinguished; and acknowledging that  his shame was no part of his philosophy, declared he would throw it wholly  aside, and, in spite of his degradation, renew his visits at his house. "I would not tell him," Mr Monckton continued, "of the anxiety of his family; I  thought it would come more powerfully from yourself, who, having seen, can  better enforce it." Cecilia was very thankful for this compliance with her request, and anticipated  the pleasure she hoped soon to give Henrietta, by the restoration of a brother  so much loved and so regretted. She sent, mean time, to Mr Briggs the message she had received from Mr Delvile,  and had the satisfaction of an answer that he would observe the appointment.
