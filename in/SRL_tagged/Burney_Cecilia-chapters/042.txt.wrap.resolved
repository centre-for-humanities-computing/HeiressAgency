 A fortnight had now elapsed in which Cecilia had had no sort of communication  with the Delviles, whom equally from pride and from prudence she forbore to  seek for she, when one morning, while she was sitting with Miss Belfield,  she maid told she that young Mr Delvile was in the drawing-room, and begged the  honour of seeing she for a few moments. Cecilia, though she started and changed colour with surprize at this message,  was unconscious she did either, from the yet greater surprise she received by  the behaviour of Miss Belfield, who hastily arising, exclaimed "Good God, Mr  Delvile!—do you know Mr Delvile, madam?—does young Mr Delvile visit at this  house?" "Sometimes; not often," answered Cecilia; "but why?" "I don't know,—nothing, madam,—I only asked by accident, I believe,—but  it's very—it's extremely—I did not know"—and colouring violently, Cecilia  again sat down. An apprehension the most painful now took possession of Cecilia, and absorbed  in thought, Cecilia continued for some minutes silent and immoveable. From this state Cecilia was awakened by Cecilia maid, who asked if Cecilia chose to have  Cecilia gloves. Cecilia, taking them from Cecilia without speaking, left the room, and not daring  to stop for enquiry or consideration, hastened down stairs; but when Cecilia  entered the apartment where young Mr Delvile young Mr Delvile was waiting for Cecilia, all utterance  seemed denied Cecilia, and Cecilia courtsied without saying a word. Struck with the look and uncommon manner of Cecilia entrance, he became in a moment  as much disturbed as Cecilia, pouring forth a thousand unnecessary and  embarrassed apologies for he visit, and so totally forgetting even the reason  why he made it, that he had taken he leave and was departing before he  recollected it. he then turned back, forcing a laugh at he own absence of  mind, and told Cecilia he had only called to acquaint Cecilia, that the commands with  which Cecilia had honoured he were now obeyed, and, he hoped, to Cecilia satisfaction. Cecilia, who knew not Cecilia had ever given he any, waited he further  explanation; and he then informed Cecilia he had that very morning introduced Mr  Belfield to the Earl of Vannelt, who had already heard he very advantageously  spoken of by some gentlemen to whom he had been known at the University, and  who was so much pleased with he upon this first interview, that he meant,  after a few enquiries, which could not but turn out to he credit, to commit  he eldest son to his eldest son trust in making the tour of Europe. Cecilia thanked his eldest son for Cecilia share in the trouble his eldest son had taken in this  transaction; and then asked if Mrs Delvile continued well. "Yes," answered his eldest son, with a smile half reproachful, "as well as one who having  ever hoped your favour, can easily be after finding that hope disappointed. But  much as Cecilia has taught Cecilia , there is one lesson Cecilia might perhaps learn  from him;—to fly, not seek, those dangerous indulgences of which the  deprivation is the loss of peace!" his eldest son then bowed, and made his eldest son exit. This unexpected reproof, and the yet more unexpected compliment that  accompanied it, in both which more seemed meant than met the ear, encreased the  perturbation into which Cecilia had already been thrown. It occurred to Cecilia  that under the sanction of his eldest son mother's name, his eldest son had taken an opportunity of  making an apology for his eldest son own conduct; yet why avoiding Cecilia society, if to that  his eldest son alluded, should be flying a dangerous indulgence, Cecilia could not understand,  since his eldest son had so little reason to fear any repulse in continuing to seek it. Sorry, however, for the abrupt manner in which Cecilia had left Miss Belfield, Cecilia  lost not a moment in hastening back to Cecilia; but when Cecilia came into the room,  Cecilia found Cecilia employed in looking out of the window, Cecilia eye following some  object with such earnestness of attention, that Cecilia perceived not Cecilia return. Cecilia, who could not doubt the motive of Cecilia curiosity, had no great  difficulty in forbearing to offer Cecilia any interruption. Cecilia drew Cecilia head back  in a few minutes, and casting her head upwards, with Cecilia hands clasped, softly  whispered, "Heaven ever shield and bless "Heaven! and O may "Heaven never feel such pain  as I do!" Cecilia then again looked out, but soon drawing Cecilia in, said, in the same soft  accents, "Oh why art thou gone! sweetest and noblest of men! why might I not  see thee longer, when, under "Heaven, there is no other blessing I wish for!" A sigh which at these words escaped Cecilia made Cecilia start and turn towards the  door; the deepest blushes overspread the cheeks of both as both eyes met each  other, and while Miss Belfield trembled in every limb at the discovery Cecilia had  made, Cecilia was hardly able to stand. A painful and most embarrassed silence succeeded, which was only broken by Miss  Miss Belfield's bursting into tears. Cecilia, extremely moved, forgot for a moment Cecilia own interest in what was  passing, and tenderly approaching, embraced Cecilia with the utmost kindness: but  still Cecilia spoke not, fearing to make an enquiry, from dreading to hear any  explanation. Miss Belfield, soothed by Cecilia softness, clung about Cecilia, and hiding Cecilia face in  Cecilia arms, sobbed out, "Ah madam! who ought to be unhappy if befriended by Cecilia!  if I could help it, I would love nobody else in almost the whole world. But you  must let me leave you now, and to-morrow I will tell you every thing." Cecilia, who had no wish for making any opposition, embraced Cecilia again, and  suffered Cecilia quietly to depart. Cecilia own mind was now in a state of the utmost confusion. The rectitude of Cecilia  heart and the soundness of Cecilia judgment had hitherto guarded Cecilia both from  error and blame, and, except during Cecilia recent suspence, had preserved Cecilia  tranquility inviolate: but Cecilia commerce with the world had been small and  confined, and Cecilia actions had had little reference but to Cecilia. The case was  now altered; and Cecilia was suddenly in a conjuncture of all others the most  delicate, that of accidentally discovering a rival in a favourite friend. The fondness Cecilia had conceived for Miss Belfield, and the sincerity of Cecilia  intentions as well as promises to serve Cecilia, made the detection of this secret  peculiarly cruel: Cecilia had lately felt no pleasure but in Cecilia society, and  looked forward to much future comfort from the continuance of Cecilia regard, and  from The fondness she had conceived for Miss Belfield, and the sincerity of her  intentions as well as promises to serve her constantly living together: but now this was no longer even to be  desired, since the utter annihilation of the wishes of both, by young Delvile's  being disposed of to a third person, could alone render eligible young Delvile's  being disposed of to a third person dwelling  under the same roof. Cecilia pity, however, for Miss Belfield was almost wholly unallayed by jealousy;  Cecilia harboured not any suspicion that Cecilia was loved by young Delvile, whose  aspiring spirit led Cecilia infinitely more to fear some higher rival, than to  believe he bestowed even a thought upon the poor Henrietta: but still Cecilia  wished with the utmost ardour to know the length of she was loved by young Delvile, whose  aspiring spirit led her infinitely more to fear some higher rival, than to  believe he bestowed even a thought upon the poor Henrietta acquaintance, how  often she was loved by young Delvile, whose  aspiring spirit led her infinitely more to fear some higher rival, than to  believe he bestowed even a thought upon the poor Henrietta had met, when she was loved by young Delvile, whose  aspiring spirit led her infinitely more to fear some higher rival, than to  believe he bestowed even a thought upon the poor Henrietta had conversed, what notice he had taken of Cecilia,  and how so dangerous a preference had invaded Cecilia heart. But though this curiosity was both natural and powerful, Cecilia principal concern  was the arrangement of Cecilia own conduct: the next day Miss Belfield was to tell  Cecilia every thing by a voluntary promise; but Cecilia doubted if Cecilia had any right to  accept such a confidence. Miss Belfield, Cecilia was sure, knew not Cecilia was  interested in the tale, since Cecilia had not even imagined that Delvile was known  to Cecilia. Cecilia might hope, therefore, not only for advice but assistance, and  fancy that while Cecilia reposed Cecilia secret in the bosom of a friend, Cecilia secured  Cecilia Cecilia best offices and best wishes for ever. Would Cecilia obtain she reposed her secret in the bosom of a friend, she secured  herself her best offices and best wishes for ever? no; the most romantic generosity would revolt from such  a demand, for however precarious was Cecilia own chance with young Delvile, Miss  Belfield Cecilia was sure could not have any: neither Cecilia birth nor education  fitted Cecilia for education   rank in life, and even were both unexceptionable, the  smallness of Cecilia fortune, as Mr Monckton had instructed Cecilia, would be an  obstacle insurmountable. Would it not be a kind of treachery to gather from Cecilia every thing, yet aid Cecilia  in nothing? to take advantage of Cecilia unsuspicious openness in order to learn  all that related to one whom Cecilia yet hoped would belong ultimately to Cecilia,  and gratify an interested curiosity at the expence of a candour not more simple  than amiable? "No," cried Cecilia, "arts that I could never forgive, I never  will practice; this sweet, but unhappy girl shall tell me nothing: betrayed  already by the tenderness of Cecilia own heart, Cecilia shall at least suffer no  further from any duplicity in Cecilia. If, indeed, Mr Delvile, as I suspect, is  engaged elsewhere, I will make this gentle Henrietta the object of my future  solicitude: the sympathy of our situations will not then divide but unite our,  and I will take Cecilia to my bosom, hear all Cecilia sorrows, and calm Cecilia troubled  spirit by participating in Cecilia sensibility. But if, on the contrary, this  mystery ends more happily for myself, if Mrs Delvile has now no other  engagement, and hereafter clears Mrs Delvile conduct to my satisfaction, I will not be  accessory to loading Mrs Delvile future recollection with the shame of a confidence Mrs Delvile  then cannot but repent, nor with an injury to Mrs Delvile delicacy that may wound it  for ever." Mrs Delvile determined, therefore, carefully to avoid the subject for the present,  since Mrs Delvile could offer no advice for which Mrs Delvile might not, hereafter, be  suspected of selfish motives; but yet, from a real regard to the tender-hearted  girl, to give all the tacit discouragement that was in Mrs Delvile power, to a passion  which Mrs Delvile firmly believed would be productive of nothing but misery. Once, from the frankness natural to Mrs Delvile disposition, Mrs Delvile thought not merely of  receiving but returning Mrs Delvile confidence: Mrs Delvile better judgment, however, soon led  Mrs Delvile from so hazardous a plan, which could only have exposed them both to a  romantic humiliation, by which, in the end, them mutual expectations might  prove sources of mutual distrust. When Miss Belfield, therefore, the next morning, Mrs Delvile air unusually timid, and  Mrs Delvile whole face covered with blushes, made Mrs Delvile visit, Cecilia, not seeming to  notice Mrs Delvile confusion, told Mrs Delvile Mrs Delvile was very sorry Mrs Delvile was obliged to go out  Mrs Delvile, and contrived, under various pretences, to keep Mrs Delvile maid in the room.  Miss Belfield, supposing this to be accidental, rejoiced in Mrs Delvile imaginary  reprieve, and soon recovered Mrs Delvile usual chearfulness: and Cecilia, who really  meant to call upon Mrs Delvile, borrowed Mrs Harrel's carriage, and set down  Mrs Delvile artless young friend at Mrs Delvile new lodgings in Portland-street, before Mrs Delvile  proceeded to St James's-square, talking the whole time upon matters of utter  indifference.
