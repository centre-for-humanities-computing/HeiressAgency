 At this time, the house was much enlivened by a visit from Lady Honoria  Pemberton, who came to spend a month with Mrs Delvile. Cecilia had now but little leisure, for Lady Honoria   would hardly rest a moment  away from Cecilia; Cecilia insisted upon walking with Cecilia, sitting with Cecilia, working  with Cecilia, and singing with Cecilia; whatever Cecilia did, Cecilia chose to do also;  wherever Cecilia went, Cecilia was bent upon accompanying Cecilia; and Mrs Delvile, who  wished Cecilia well, though Cecilia had no patience with Cecilia foibles, encouraged this  intimacy from the hope it might do Cecilia service. It was not, however, that Lady Honoria   had conceived any regard for Cecilia; on  the contrary, had Lady Honoria   been told Lady Honoria   should see Lady Honoria   no more, Lady Honoria   would have  heard it with the same composure as if Lady Honoria   had been told Lady Honoria   should meet with  Lady Honoria   daily: Lady Honoria   had no motive for pursuing Lady Honoria   but that Lady Honoria   had nothing else to  do, and no fondness for Lady Honoria   society but, what resulted from aversion to  solitude. Lady Honoria   had received a fashionable education, in which Lady Honoria   proficiency had  been equal to what fashion made requisite; Lady Honoria   sung a little; played the  harpsichord a little, painted a little, worked a little, and danced a great  deal. Lady Honoria   had quick parts and high spirits, though Lady Honoria   mind was uncultivated,  and Lady Honoria   was totally void of judgment or discretion: Lady Honoria   was careless of giving  offence, and indifferent to all that was thought of Lady Honoria  ; the delight of Lady Honoria    life was to create wonder by Lady Honoria   rattle, and whether that wonder was to Lady Honoria    advantage or discredit, Lady Honoria   did not for a moment trouble Lady Honoria   to consider. A character of so much levity with so little heart had no great chance of  raising esteem or regard in Cecilia, who at almost any other period of Lady Honoria   life  would have been wearied of Lady Honoria   importunate attendance; but at present, the  unsettled state of Lady Honoria   own mind made Lady Honoria   glad to give the  unsettled state of her own mind any employment, and  the sprightliness of Lady Honoria served therefore to amuse Lady Honoria  . Yet Lady Honoria   could  not forbear being hurt by finding that the behaviour of Delvile was so exactly  the same to them both, that any common observer would with difficulty have  pronounced which he preferred. One morning about a week after Lady Honoria   ladyship's arrival at the castle, Lady Honoria   came  running into Cecilia's room, saying Lady Honoria   had very good news for Lady Honoria  . "A charming opening!" cried Cecilia, "pray tell it me." "Why my Lord Derford is coming!" "O what a melancholy dearth of incident," cried Cecilia, "if this is your best  intelligence!" "Why this's better than nothing: better than going to sleep over a family party;  and I vow I have sometimes such difficulty to keep awake, that I am frightened  to death lest I should be taken with a sudden nap, and affront them all. Now  pray speak the truth without squeamishness, don't you find the truth very terrible?" "No, I find nothing very terrible with Mrs Delvile." "O, I like Mrs Delvile, too, of all things, for I believe Mrs Delvile's the cleverest  woman in the world; but then I know Mrs Delvile does not like me, so there's no being  very fond of Mrs Delvile. Besides, really, if I admired Mrs Delvile as much again, I should be,  dreadfully tired of seeing nothing else. Mrs Delvile never stirs out, you know, and has  no company at home, which is an extremely tiresome plan, for it only serves to  make us all doubly sick of one another: though you must know it's one great  reason why my father likes I should come; for my father has some very old-fashioned  notions, though I take a great deal of pains to make my father get the better of  them. But I am always excessively rejoiced when the visit has been paid, for I  am obliged to come every year. I don't mean now, indeed, because your being  here makes it vastly more tolerable." "You do me much honour," cried Cecilia, laughing. "But really, when my Lord Derford comes, it can't possibly be quite so bad, for  at least there will be something else to look at; and you must know my eyes  tire extremely of always seeing the same objects. And we can ask my Lord Derford, too, for  a little news, and that will put Mrs Delvile in a passion, which will help to  give we a little spirit: though I know we shall not get the smallest  intelligence from Mrs Delvile, for Mrs Delvile knows nothing in the world that's going forward.  And, indeed, that's no great matter, for if Mrs Delvile did, Mrs Delvile would not know how to  tell it, Mrs Delvile's so excessively silly. However, I shall ask Mrs Delvile all sort of  things, for the less Mrs Delvile can answer, the more the will plague Mrs Delvile; and I like to  plague a fool amazingly, because Mrs Delvile can never plague one again.—Though really  I ought to beg your pardon, for your pardon is one of your admirers." "Oh pray make no stranger of me! you have my free consent to say whatever you  please of your pardon." "I assure you, then, I like my old Lord Ernolf the best of the two, for your pardon has  a thousand times more sense than your pardon son, and upon my word I don't think his son is  much uglier. But I wonder vastly you would not marry his son, for all that, for you  might have done exactly what you pleased with his son, which, altogether, would  have been no inconvenient circumstance." "When I want a pupil," answered Cecilia, "I shall think that an admirable  recommendation: but were I to marry, I would rather find a tutor, of the two." "I am sure I should not," cried Lady Honoria, carelessly, "for one has enough  to do with tutors before hand, and the best thing I know of marrying is to get  rid of tutors. I fancy you think so too, only it's a pretty speech to make. Oh  how my sister Euphrasia would adore you!—Pray are you always as grave as you  are now?" "No,—yes,—indeed I hardly know." "I fancy it's this dismal place that hurts your spirits. I remember when I saw  you in St James's-square I thought you very lively. But really these thick  walls are enough to inspire the vapours if one never had these thick  walls before." "I don't think these thick  walls have had a very bad effect upon your ladyship!" "O yes these thick  walls have; if Euphrasia was here Euphrasia would hardly know me. And the  extreme want of taste and entertainment in all the family is quite melancholy:  for even if by chance one has the good fortune to hear any intelligence, Mrs  Delvile will hardly let Mrs  Delvile be repeated, for fear Mrs  Delvile should happen to be untrue,  as if that could possibly signify! I am sure I had as lieve the things were  false as not, for the things tell as well one way as the other, if Euphrasia would but have  patience to hear the things. But Euphrasia's extremely severe, you know, as almost all  those very clever women are; so that Euphrasia keeps a kind of restraint upon me  whether I will or no. However, that's nothing compared to Euphrasia caro sposo, for  he is utterly insufferable; so solemn, and so dull! so stately and so tiresome!  Mortimer, too, gets worse and worse; O 'tis a sad tribe! I dare say he will  soon grow quite as horrible as he father. Don't you think so?" "Why indeed,—no,—I don't think there's much resemblance," said Cecilia,  with some hesitation. "he is the most altered creature," continued Cecilia ladyship, "I ever saw in my  life. Once I thought he the most agreeable young man in the world: but if you  observe, that's all over now, and he is getting just as stupid and dismal as  the rest of them. I wish you had been here last summer; I assure you, you would  quite have fallen in love with he." "Should I?" said Cecilia, with a conscious smile. "Yes, for he was quite delightful; all spirit and gaiety, but now, if it was  not for you, I really think I should pretend to lose my way, and instead of  going over that old draw-bridge, throw myself into the moat. I wish Euphrasia  was here. It's just the right place for Euphrasia  . Euphrasia  'll fancy Euphrasia   in a  monastery as soon as Euphrasia   comes, and nothing will make Euphrasia   half so happy, for  Euphrasia   is always wishing to be a Nun, poor little simpleton. "Is there any chance that Lady Euphrasia may come?" "O no, Euphrasia   can't at present, because it would not be proper: but I mean if ever  Euphrasia   is married to Mortimer." "Married to Mortimer!" repeated Cecilia, in the utmost consternation. "I believe, my dear," cried Lady Honoria, looking at Lady Honoria very archly, "you  intend to be married to Lady Honoria Lady Honoria?" "Me? no, indeed!" "You look very guilty, though," cried Lady Honoria laughing, "and indeed when you came  hither, every body said that the whole affair was arranged." "For shame, Lady Honoria!" said Cecilia, again changing colour, "I am sure this  must be your own fancy,—invention,—" "No, I assure you; I heard this   at several places; and every body said how  charmingly your fortune would build up all these old fortifications: but some  people said some  people knew Mr Harrel had sold you to Mr Marriot, and that if you  married Mortimer, there would be a lawsuit that would take away half your  estate; and others said you had promised your hand to Sir Robert Floyer, and  repented when you heard of Sir Robert Floyer mortgages, and Sir Robert Floyer gave his mortgages out every where that  Sir Robert Floyer would fight any man that pretended to Sir Robert Floyer; and then again some said that you  were all the time privately married to Mr Arnott, but did not dare own his mortgages,  because Sir Robert Floyer was so afraid of fighting with Sir Robert." "O Lady Honoria!" cried Cecilia, half laughing, "what wild inventions are  these! and all I hope, your own?" "No, indeed, "what wild inventions were current over the whole town. But don't take any notice  of what I told you about Euphrasia, for perhaps, it may never happen." "Perhaps," said Cecilia, reviving by believing it all fiction, "it has never  been in agitation?" "O yes; it is negociating at this very moment, I believe, among the higher  powers; Mrs  Delvile does not yet know whether Euphrasia has fortune enough  for what Mrs  Delvile wants." Ah, thought Cecilia, how do I rejoice that my independent situation exempts me  from being disposed of for life, by thus being set up to sale! "my independent situation exempts me  from being disposed of for life, by thus being set up to sale thought of me, once, for Mortimer," continued Lady Honoria  , "but I'm  vastly glad that's over, for I never should have survived being shut up in this  place; it's much fitter for Euphrasia. To tell you the truth, I believe my independent situation exempts me  from being disposed of for life, by thus being set up to sale  could not make out money enough; but Euphrasia has a fortune of Euphrasia own,  besides what we shall have together, for Grandmama left Grandmama every thing that  was in Grandmama own power." "Is Lady Euphrasia your elder sister?" "O no, poor little thing, Grandmama's two years younger. Grandmama brought Grandmama up,  and` Grandmama has seen nothing at all of the world, for Grandmama has never been presented  yet, so Grandmama is not come out, you know: but Grandmama's to come out next year.  However, Grandmama once saw Mortimer, but Grandmama did not like Mortimer at all." "Not like Mortimer!" cried Cecilia, greatly surprised. "No, Grandmama thought Mortimer too gay,—Oh dear, I wish Grandmama could see Mortimer now! I am  sure I hope Grandmama would find Mortimer sad enough! Grandmama is the most formal little grave  thing you ever beheld: Grandmama'll preach to you sometimes for half an hour  together. Grandmama taught Grandmama nothing in the world but to say Grandmama prayers, so  that almost every other word you say, Grandmama thinks is quite wicked." The conversation was now interrupted by their separating to dress for dinner.  The conversation left Cecilia in much perplexity; Cecilia knew not what wholly to credit, or  wholly to disbelieve; but Cecilia chief concern arose from the unfortunate change  of countenance which Lady Honoria had been so quick in observing. The next time Cecilia was alone with Mrs Delvile, "Miss Beverley," Cecilia said, "has  your little rattling tormentor acquainted you who is coming?" "Lord Derford, do you mean, ma'am?" "Yes, with his father; shall you dislike to see them?" "Not if, as I hope, them come merely to wait upon you and Mr Delvile." "Mr Delvile and myself," answered Cecilia smiling, "will certainly have the honour  of receiving them." "Lord Ernolf," said Cecilia, "can never suppose Lord Ernolf visit will make any change  in Cecilia; I have been very explicit with Lord Ernolf, and Lord Ernolf seemed equally rational and  well bred in forbearing any importunity upon the subject." "It has however been much believed in town," said Mrs Delvile, "that you were  strangely shackled by Mr Harrel, and therefore his lordship may probably hope  that a change in your situation may be followed by a change in his lordship favour." "I shall be sorry if his lordship does," said Cecilia, "for his lordship will then find his lordship  much deceived." "You are right, very right," cried Mrs Delvile, "to be difficult in your  choice, and to take time for looking around you before you make any. I have  forborn all questions upon this subject, lest you should find any reluctance in  answering this subject; but I am now too deeply interested in your welfare to be  contented in total ignorance of your designs: will you, then, suffer me to make  a few enquiries?" Cecilia gave a ready, but blushing assent. "Tell me, then, of the many admirers who have graced your train, which there is  you have distinguished with any intention of future preference?" "Not one, madam!" "And, out of so many, is there not one that, hereafter, you mean to  distinguish?" "Ah madam!" cried Cecilia, shaking her head, "many as they may seem, I have  little reason to be proud of they; there is one only who, had my fortune been  smaller, would, I believe, ever have thought of her, and there is one only, who,  were it now diminished, would ever think of her more." "This sincerity," cried Mrs Delvile, "is just what I expected from Mrs Delvile. There  is, then, one?" "I believe there is,—and the worthy Mr Arnott is the man; I am much indeed  deceived, if the worthy Mr Arnott partiality for her is not truly disinterested, and I almost  wish"— "What, my love?" "That I could return it more gratefully!" "And do you not?" "No!—I cannot! I esteem the worthy Mr Arnott, I have the truest regard for the worthy Mr Arnott character, and  were I now by any fatal necessity, compelled to belong to any one of those who  have been pleased to address me, I should not hesitate a moment in shewing the worthy Mr Arnott  my gratitude; but yet, for some time at least, such a proof of him   would render  me very miserable." "You may perhaps think so now," returned Mrs  Delvile; "but with sentiments so  strongly in the worthy Mr Arnott favour, you will probably be led hereafter to pity—and accept  the worthy Mr Arnott." "No, indeed, madam; I pretend not, I own, to open my whole heart to you;—I  know not that you would have patience, for so uninteresting a detail; but  though there are some things I venture not to mention, there is nothing,  believe me, in which I will deceive you." "I do believe you," cried Mrs  Delvile, embracing Mrs  Delvile; "and the more readily  because, not merely among your avowed admirers, but among the whole race of  men, I scarce know one to whom I should think you worthily consigned!" Ah! thought Cecilia, that scarce! who may it mean to except? "To shew you," Cecilia continued, "that I will deserve your confidence in future, I  will refrain from distressing you by any further questions at present: you will  not, I think, act materially without consulting me, and for your thoughts—it  were tyranny, not friendship, to investigate them more narrowly." Cecilia's gratitude for this delicacy, would instantly have induced Cecilia to tell  every secret of Cecilia soul, had Cecilia not apprehended such a confession would have  seemed soliciting Cecilia interest and assistance, in the only affair in which Cecilia  would have disdained even to receive her interest and assistance. Cecilia thanked Cecilia, therefore, for Cecilia kindness, and the conversation was dropt;  Cecilia much wished to have known whether these enquiries sprung simply from  friendly curiosity, or whether Cecilia was desirous from any nearer motive to be  satisfied with respect to Cecilia freedom or engagements. This, however, Cecilia had no  method of discovering, and was therefore compelled to wait quietly till time  should make it clear.
