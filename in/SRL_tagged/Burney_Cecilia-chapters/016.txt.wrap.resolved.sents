 As soon as they returned home, Cecilia begged Mrs Harrel not to lose a moment  before Cecilia tried to acquaint Mr Harrel with the state of the affair.
But that  lady was too helpless to know in what manner to set about that  ; lady could not  tell where Mrs Harrel was, lady could not conjecture where Mrs Harrel might be.
Cecilia then rang for Mrs Harrel own man, and upon enquiry, heard that Mrs Harrel was, in all  probability, at Brookes's in St James's-Street.
Cecilia then begged Mrs Harrel would write to Mrs Harrel.
Mrs Harrel knew not what to say.
Cecilia therefore, equally quick in forming and executing Cecilia designs, wrote to  Mrs Harrel Mrs Harrel, and entreated that without losing an instant Mrs Harrel would find out Mrs Harrel  friend Sir Robert Floyer, and endeavour to effect an accommodation between Mrs Harrel  and Mr Belfield, with whom Mrs Harrel had had a dispute at the Opera-house.
Mrs Harrel soon returned with an answer that Mrs Harrel would not fail to obey Mrs Harrel  commands.
Mrs Harrel determined to sit up till Mrs Harrel came home in order to learn the event of the  negociation.
Mrs Harrel considered Mrs Harrel as the efficient cause of the quarrel, yet  scarce knew how or in what to blame Mrs Harrel; the behaviour of Sir Robert had  always been offensive to Mrs Harrel; Mrs Harrel disliked Sir Robert manners, and detested Sir Robert  boldness; and Mrs Harrel had already shewn Mrs Harrel intention to accept the assistance of  Mr Belfield before Sir Robert had followed Mrs Harrel with an offer of Sir Robert own.
Mrs Harrel was  uncertain, indeed, whether Sir Robert had remarked what had passed, but Mrs Harrel had reason  to think that, so circumstanced, to have changed Mrs Harrel purpose, would have been  construed into an encouragement that might have authorised Sir Robert future  presumption of Mrs Harrel favour.
All Mrs Harrel could find to regret with regard to Mrs Harrel,  was wanting the presence of mind to have refused the civilities of both.
Mrs Harrel, though really sorry at the state of the affair, regarded Mrs Harrel as  so entirely unconcerned in it, that, easily wearied when out of company, Mrs Harrel  soon grew sleepy, and retired to Mrs Harrel own room.
The anxious Cecilia, hoping every instant the return of Mrs Harrel, sat up by  Mrs Harrel: but it was not till near four o'clock in the morning that he made he  appearance.
"Well, sir," cried Mrs Harrel, the moment Mrs Harrel saw he, "I fear by your coming home so  late you have had much trouble, but I hope it has been successful?"
Great, however, was Mrs Harrel mortification when he answered that he had not even  seen the Baronet, having been engaged he in so particular a manner, that  he could not possibly break from he party till past three o'clock, at which  time he drove to the house of Sir Robert, but heard that he was not yet come  home.
Cecilia, though much disgusted by such a specimen of insensibility towards a  man whom he pretended to call he friend, would not leave he till he had  promised to arise as soon as it was light, and make an effort to recover the  time lost.
Cecilia was now no longer surprised either at the debts of Mr Harrel, or at he  particular occasions for money.
Cecilia was convinced he spent half the night in  gaming, and the consequences, however dreadful, were but natural.
That Sir  Robert Floyer also did the same was a matter of much less importance to Cecilia,  but that the life of any man should through Cecilia means be endangered, disturbed  Cecilia inexpressibly.
Cecilia went, however, to bed, but arose again at six o'clock, and dressed Cecilia  by candle light.
In an hour's time Cecilia sent to enquire if Mr Harrel was  stirring, and hearing Mr Harrel was asleep, gave orders to have Mr Harrel called.
Yet Mr Harrel did  not rise till eight o'clock, nor could all Cecilia messages or expostulations drive  Mr Harrel out of the house till nine.
Mr Harrel was scarcely gone before Mr Monckton arrived, who now for the first time had  the satisfaction of finding Cecilia alone.
"You are very good for coming so early," cried Cecilia; "have you seen Mr Belfield?
Have you had any conversation with Mr Harrel?"
Alarmed at Cecilia eagerness, and still more at seeing by Cecilia looks the sleepless  night Cecilia had passed, Mr Harrel made at first no reply; and when, with increasing  impatience, Cecilia repeated Cecilia question, Mr Harrel only said, "Has Mr Belfield ever visited  you since Mr Harrel had the honour of meeting you at the house?"
"No, never."
"Have you seen Mr Harrel often in public?"
"No, I have never seen Mr Harrel at all but the evening Mr Harrel received masks,  and last night at the Opera."
"Is it, then, for the safety of Sir Robert you are so extremely anxious?"
"It is for the safety of both; the cause of the safety of both quarrel was so trifling, that  I cannot bear to think that   consequence should be serious."
"But do you not wish better to one of the safety of both than to the other?"
"As a matter of justice I do, but not from any partiality: Sir Robert was  undoubtedly the aggressor, and Mr Belfield, though at first too fiery, was  certainly ill-used."
The candour of this speech recovered Mr Monckton from Mr Monckton apprehensions; and,  carefully observing Mr Monckton looks while Mr Monckton spoke, Mr Monckton gave Mr Monckton the following account.
That Mr Monckton had hastened to Belfield's lodgings the moment Mr Monckton left the Opera-house,  and, after repeated denials, absolutely forced Mr Monckton into Mr Monckton room, where Mr Monckton  was quite alone, and in much agitation: Mr Monckton conversed with Mr Monckton for more than an  hour upon the subject of the quarrel, but found Mr Monckton so warmly resented the  personal insult given Mr Monckton by Sir Robert, that no remonstrance had any effect in  making Mr Monckton alter Mr Monckton resolution of demanding satisfaction.
"And could you bring Mr Monckton to consent to no compromise before you left Mr Monckton?"
cried Cecilia.
"No; for before I got to Mr Monckton—the challenge had been sent."
"The challenge!
good heaven!—and do you know the event?"
"I called again this morning at Mr Monckton lodgings, but Mr Monckton was not returned home."
"And was it impossible to follow Mr Monckton?
Were there no means to discover whither  Mr Monckton was gone?"
"None; to elude all pursuit, Mr Monckton went out before any body in the house was  stirring, and took Mr Monckton servant with Mr Monckton."
"Have you, then, been to Sir Robert?"
"I have been to Cavendish-Square, but there, it seems, Sir Robert has not appeared all  night; I traced Sir Robert, through Sir Robert servants, from the Opera to a gaminghouse,  where I found Sir Robert had amused Sir Robert till this morning."
The uneasiness of Cecilia now encreased every moment; and Mr Monckton, seeing  Sir Robert had no other chance of satisfying Mr Monckton, offered Sir Robert service to go again in  search of both the gentlemen, and endeavour to bring Mr Monckton better information.
Mr Monckton accepted the proposal with gratitude, and Sir Robert departed.
Soon after Mr Monckton was joined by Mr Arnott, who, though seized with all the horrors  of jealousy at sight of Mr Monckton apprehensions, was so desirous to relieve Soon after she was joined by Mr Arnott, who, though seized with all the horrors  of jealousy at sight of her apprehensions,  that without even making any merit of obliging Mr Monckton, Sir Robert almost instantly set out  upon the same errand that employed Mr Monckton, and determined not to mention  Sir Robert design till Sir Robert found whether his design would enable Sir Robert to bring Mr Monckton good tidings.
Sir Robert was scarce gone when Mr Monckton was told that Mr Delvile begged to have the honour  of speaking to Mr Monckton.
Surprised at this condescension, Mr Monckton desired Sir Robert might  immediately be admitted; but much was Mr Monckton surprise augmented, when, instead of  seeing Mr Monckton ostentatious guardian, Mr Monckton again beheld Mr Monckton masquerade friend, the  white domino.
Sir Robert entreated Mr Monckton pardon for an intrusion neither authorised by acquaintance nor  by business, though somewhat, Sir Robert hoped, palliated, by Sir Robert near connection with  one who was privileged to take an interest in Mr Monckton affairs: and then, hastening  to the motives which had occasioned Sir Robert visit, "when I had the honour," Sir Robert  said, "of seeing you last night at the Opera-house, the dispute which had just  happened between two gentlemen, seemed to give you an uneasiness which could  not but be painful to all who observed it, and as among that number I was not  the least moved, you will forgive, I hope, my eagerness to be the first to  bring you intelligence that nothing fatal has happened, or is likely to happen."
"You do me, sir," said Cecilia, "much honour; and indeed you relieve me from a  suspense extremely disagreeable.
The accommodation, I suppose, was brought  about this morning?"
"I find," answered Sir Robert, smiling, "you now expect too much; but hope is never so  elastic as when it springs from the ruins of terror."
"What then is the matter?
Are they at last, not safe?"
"Yes, perfectly safe; but I cannot tell you they have never been in danger."
"Well, if it is now over I am contented: but you will very much oblige me, sir,  if you will inform me what has passed."
"You oblige me, madam, by the honour of your commands.
I saw but too much  reason to apprehend that measures the most violent would follow the affray of  last night; yet as I found that the quarrel had been accidental, and the  offence unpremeditated, I thought it not absolutely impossible that an  expeditious mediation might effect a compromise: at least an  expeditious mediation might effect a compromise was worth trying;  for though wrath slowly kindled or long nourished is sullen and intractable,  the sudden anger that has not had time to impress the mind with a deep sense of  injury, will, when gently managed, be sometimes appeased with the same  quickness it is excited: I hoped, therefore, that some trifling concession from  Sir Robert, as the aggressor,—" "Ah sir!"
cried Cecilia, "that, I fear, was not to be obtained!"
"Not by me, I must own," " "Ah sir answered; "but I was not willing to think of the  difficulty, and therefore ventured to make the proposal: nor did I leave the  Opera-house till I had used every possible argument to persuade Sir Robert an  apology would neither stain Sir Robert courage nor Sir Robert reputation.
But Sir Robert spirit  brooked not the humiliation."
"Spirit!"
cried Cecilia, "how mild a word!
What, then, could poor Mr Belfield  resolve upon?"
"That, I believe, took Mr Belfield   very little time to decide.
I discovered, by means  of a gentleman at the Opera who was acquainted with Mr Belfield  , where Mr Belfield   lived, and I  waited upon Mr Belfield   with an intention to offer my services towards settling the  affair by arbitration: for since you call Mr Belfield   poor Mr Belfield, I think you  will permit me, without offence to Mr Belfield   antagonist, to own that Mr Belfield   gallantry,  though too impetuous for commendation, engaged me in Mr Belfield   interest."
"I hope you don't think," cried Cecilia, "that an offence to Mr Belfield   antagonist  must necessarily be an offence to me?"
"Whatever I may have thought," answered Mr Belfield  , looking at Cecilia with evident  surprise, "I certainly did not wish that a sympathy offensive and defensive had  been concluded between you.
I could not, however, gain access to Mr Belfield  last night, but the affair dwelt upon my mind, and this morning I called at Mr Belfield    lodging as soon as it was light."
"How good you have been!"
cried Cecilia; "your kind offices have not, I hope,  all proved ineffectual!"
"So valorous a Don Quixote," returned Mr Belfield  , laughing, "certainly merited a  faithful Esquire!
Mr Belfield   was, however, gone out, and nobody knew whither.
About  half an hour ago I called upon Mr Belfield   again; Mr Belfield   was then just returned home."
"Well, sir?"
"I saw Mr Belfield  ; the affair was over; and in a short time Mr Belfield   will be able, if you  will allow Mr Belfield   so much honour, to thank you for these enquiries."
"Mr Belfield   is then wounded?"
"Mr Belfield   is a little hurt, but Sir Robert is perfectly safe.
Mr Belfield   fired first,  and missed; the Baronet was not so successless."
"I am grieved to hear it, indeed!
And where is the wound?"
"The ball entered the Baronet right side, and the moment the Baronet felt it, the Baronet fired the Baronet  second pistol in the air.
This I heard from the Baronet .
the Baronet was brought home  carefully and slowly; no surgeon had been upon the spot, but one was called to  the Baronet immediately.
I stayed to enquire the Baronet opinion after the wound had been  dressed: the Baronet told me the Baronet had extracted The ball, and assured me Mr Belfield   was  not in any danger.
Your alarm, madam, last night, which had always been present  to me, then encouraged me to take the liberty of waiting upon you; for I  concluded you could yet have had no certain intelligence, and thought it best  to let the plain and simple fact out-run the probable exaggeration of rumour."
Cecilia thanked the Baronet for the Baronet attention, and Mr Harrel then making Mr Harrel  appearance, Mr Harrel arose and said, "Had my father known the honour I have had this  morning of waiting upon Miss Beverley, I am sure I should have been charged  with Mr Harrel compliments, and such a commission would somewhat have lessened the  presumption of this visit; but I feared lest while I should be making interest  for my credentials, the pretence of my embassy might be lost, and other  couriers, less scrupulous, might obtain previous audiences, and anticipate my  dispatches."
Mr Harrel then took Mr Harrel leave.
"This white domino, at last then," said Cecilia, "is the son of Mr Delvile!
and  thence the knowledge of my situation which gave me so much surprise:—a son  how infinitely unlike the son of Mr Delvile father!"
"Yes," said Mr Harrel, "and as unlike Mr Harrel mother too, for I assure you Mr Harrel is  more proud and haughty even than the old gentleman.
I hate the very sight of  Mr Harrel, for Mr Harrel keeps every body in such awe that there's nothing but restraint in  Mr Harrel presence.
But the son of Mr Delvile is a very pretty young man, and much admired; though  I have only seen the son of Mr Delvile in public, for none of the family visit here."
Mr Monckton, who now soon returned, was not a little surprised to find that all  the intelligence the son of Mr Delvile meant to communicate was already known: and not the more  pleased to hear that the white domino, to whom before the son of Mr Delvile owed no good-will, had  thus officiously preceded the son of Mr Delvile.
Mr Arnott, who also came just after the son of Mr Delvile, had been so little satisfied with the  result of the son of Mr Delvile enquiries, that from the fear of encreasing Cecilia's uneasiness,  the son of Mr Delvile determined not to make known whither the son of Mr Delvile had been; but the son of Mr Delvile soon found the son of Mr Delvile  forbearance was of no avail, as she was already acquainted with the duel and  the duel consequences.
Yet the son of Mr Delvile unremitting desire to oblige she urged the son of Mr Delvile twice in  the course of the same day to again call at Mr Belfield   lodgings, in order to  bring she thence fresh and unsolicited intelligence.
Before breakfast was quite over, Miss Larolles, out of breath with eagerness,  came to tell the news of the duel, in she way to church, as it was Sunday  morning!
and soon after Mrs Mears, who also was followed by other ladies,  brought the same account, which by all was addressed to Cecilia, with  expressions of concern that convinced she, to she infinite vexation, she was  generally regarded as the person chiefly interested in the accident.
Mr Harrel did not return till late, but then seemed in very high spirits: "Miss  Beverley," Mr Harrel cried, "I bring you news that will repay all your fright; Sir Robert is not only safe, but is come off conqueror."
"I am very sorry, Sir  ," answered Cecilia, extremely provoked to be thus  congratulated, "that any body conquered, or any body was vanquished."
"There is no need for sorrow," cried Mr Harrel, "or for any thing but joy, for  Sir Robert has not killed Sir Robert man; the victory, therefore, will neither cost his man a  flight nor a trial.
To-day Sir Robert means to wait upon you, and lay Sir Robert laurels at  your feet."
"Sir Robert means, then, to take very fruitless trouble," said Cecilia, "for I have not  any ambition to be so honoured."
"Ah, Miss Beverley," returned Sir Robert, laughing, "this won't do now!
it might have  passed a little while ago, but it won't do now, I promise you!"
Cecilia, though much displeased by this accusation, found that disclaiming it  only excited further raillery, and therefore prevailed upon Cecilia to give him  a quiet hearing, and scarce any reply.
At dinner, when Sir Robert arrived, the dislike Cecilia had originally taken to  Sir Robert, encreased already into disgust by Sir Robert behaviour the preceding evening, was  now fixed into the strongest aversion by the horror Cecilia conceived of Sir Robert  fierceness, and the indignation Cecilia felt excited by Sir Robert arrogance.
Sir Robert seemed,  from the success of this duel, to think Sir Robert raised to the highest pinnacle  of human glory; triumph sat exulting on Sir Robert brow; Sir Robert looked down on whoever Sir Robert  deigned to look at all, and shewed that Sir Robert thought Sir Robert notice an honour,  however imperious the manner in which his notice was accorded.
Upon Cecilia, however, Sir Robert cast an eye of more complacency; Sir Robert now believed Upon Cecilia  subdued, and Sir Robert vanity revelled in the belief: Upon Cecilia anxiety had so thoroughly  satisfied Sir Robert of Upon Cecilia love, that Upon Cecilia had hardly the power left to undeceive Sir Robert;  Upon Cecilia silence Sir Robert only attributed to admiration, Upon Cecilia coldness to fear, and Upon Cecilia  reserve to shame.
Sickened by insolence so undisguised and unauthorised, and incensed at the  triumph of Sir Robert successful brutality, Cecilia with pain kept Cecilia with pain seat, and with  vexation reflected upon the necessity Upon Cecilia was under of passing so large a  portion of Upon Cecilia time in company to which Upon Cecilia was so extremely averse.
After dinner, when Mr Harrel was talking of Upon Cecilia party for the evening, of  which Cecilia declined making one, Sir Robert, with a sort of proud humility,  that half feared rejection, and half proclaimed an indifference to meeting it,  said, "I don't much care for going further Mr Harrel, if "Miss  Beverley will give  me the honour of taking my tea with "Miss  Beverley."
Cecilia with pain, regarding Mr Harrel with much surprise, answered that Cecilia with pain had letters to  write into the country, which would confine Cecilia with pain to Cecilia with pain own room for the rest of  the evening.
the Baronet, looking at the Baronet watch, instantly cried, "Faith, that  is very fortunate, for I have just recollected an engagement at the other end  of the town which had slipt my memory."
Soon after they were all gone, Cecilia received a note from Mrs Delvile,  begging the favour of Cecilia company the next morning to breakfast.
Cecilia readily  accepted the invitation, though Cecilia was by no means prepared, by the character  Cecilia had heard of Cecilia, to expect much pleasure from an acquaintance with that  lady.
