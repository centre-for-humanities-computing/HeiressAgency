 Cecilia took leave over night of the family, as she would not stay their rising  in the morning: Mr Monckton, though certain not to sleep when she was going,  forbearing to mark his solicitude by quitting his apartment at any unusual  hour. Lady Margaret parted from her with her accustomed ungraciousness, and  Miss Bennet, because in her presence, in a manner scarcely less displeasing. The next morning, with only her servants, the moment it was light, she set out.  Her journey was without incident or interruption, and she went immediately to  the house of Mrs Bayley, where she had settled to board till her own was  finished. Mrs Bayley was a mere good sort of woman, who lived decently well with her  servants, and tolerably well with her neighbours, upon a small annuity, which  made her easy and comfortable, though by no means superior to such an addition  to her little income as an occasional boarder might produce. Here Cecilia continued a full month: which time had no other employment than  what she voluntarily gave to herself by active deeds of benevolence. At Christmas, to the no little joy of the neighbourhood, she took possession of  her own house, which was situated about three miles from Bury. The better sort of people were happy to see her thus settled amongst them, and  the poorer, who by what they already had received, knew well what they still  might expect, regarded the day in which she fixed herself in her mansion, as a  day to themselves of prosperity and triumph. As she was no longer, as hitherto, repairing to a temporary habitation, which  at pleasure she might quit, and to which, at a certain period, she could have  no possible claim, but to a house which was her own for ever, or, at least,  could solely by her own choice be transferred, she determined, as much as was  in her power, in quitting her desultory dwellings, to empty her mind of the  transactions which had passed in them, and upon entering a house where she was  permanently to reside, to make the expulsion of her past sorrows, the basis  upon which to establish her future serenity. And this, though a work of pain and difficulty, was not impracticable; her  sensibility, indeed, was keen, and she had suffered from it the utmost torture;  but her feelings were not more powerful than her understanding was strong, and  her fortitude was equal to her trials. Her calamities had saddened, but not  weakened her mind, and the words of Delvile in speaking of his mother occurred  to her now with all the conviction of experience, that "evils inevitable are  always best supported, because known to be past amendment, and felt to give  defiance to struggling." [Footnote: See Vol. ii. p. 317.] A plan by which so great a revolution was to be wrought in her mind, was not to  be effected by any sudden effort of magnanimity, but by a regular and even  tenour of courage mingled with prudence. Nothing, therefore, appeared to her so  indispensable as constant employment, by which a variety of new images might  force their way in her mind to supplant the old ones, and by which no time  might be allowed for brooding over melancholy retrospections. Her first effort, in this work of mental reformation, was to part with Fidel,  whom hitherto she had almost involuntarily guarded, but whom she only could see  to revive the most dangerous recollections. She sent him, therefore, to the  castle, but without any message; Mrs Delvile, she was sure, would require none  to make her rejoice in his restoration. Her next step was writing to Albany, who had given her his direction, to  acquaint him she was now ready to put in practice their long concerted scheme.  Albany instantly hastened to her, and joyfully accepted the office of becoming  at once her Almoner and her Monitor. He made it his business to seek objects of  distress, and always but too certain to find them, of conducting her himself to  their habitations, and then leaving to her own liberality the assistance their  several cases demanded: and, in the overflowing of his zeal upon these  occasions, and the rapture of his heart in thus disposing, almost at his  pleasure, of her noble fortune, he seemed, at times, to feel an extasy that,  from its novelty and its excess, was almost too exquisite to be borne. He  joined with the beggars in pouring blessings upon her head, he prayed for her  with the poor, and he thanked her with the succoured. The pew-opener and her children failed not to keep their appointment, and  Cecilia presently contrived to settle them in her neighbourhood: where the poor  woman, as she recovered her strength, soon got a little work, and all  deficiencies in her power of maintaining herself were supplied by her generous  patroness. The children, however, she ordered to be coarsely brought up, having  no intention to provide for them but by helping them to common employments. The promise, also, so long made to Mrs Harrel of an apartment in her house, was  now performed. That lady accepted it with the utmost alacrity, glad to make any  change in her situation, which constant solitude had rendered wholly  insupportable. Mr Arnott accompanied her to the house, and spent one day there;  but receiving from Cecilia, though extremely civil and sweet to him, no hint of  any invitation for repeating his visit, he left it in sadness, and returned to  his own in deep dejection. Cecilia saw with concern how he nourished his  hopeless passion, but knew that to suffer his visits would almost authorise his  feeding it; and while she pitied unaffectedly the unhappiness she occasioned,  she resolved to double her own efforts towards avoiding similar wretchedness. This action, however, was a point of honour, not of friendship, the time being  long since past that the society of Mrs Harrel could afford her any pleasure;  but the promises she had so often made to Mr Harrel in his distresses, though  extorted from her merely by the terrors of the moment, still were promises,  and, therefore, she held herself bound to fulfil them. Yet far from finding comfort in this addition to her family, Mrs Harrel proved  to her nothing more than a trouble and an incumbrance; with no inherent  resources, she was continually in search of occasional supplies; she fatigued  Cecilia with wonder at the privacy of her life, and tormented her with  proposals of parties and entertainments. She was eternally in amazement that  with powers so large, she had wishes so confined, and was evidently  disappointed that upon coming to so ample an estate, she lived, with respect to  herself and her family, with no more magnificence or shew than if Heiress to  only ú500 a year. But Cecilia was determined to think and to live for herself, without regard to  unmeaning wonder or selfish remonstrances; she had neither ambition for  splendour, nor spirits for dissipation; the recent sorrow of her heart had  deadened it for the present to all personal taste of happiness, and her only  chance for regaining it, seemed through the medium of bestowing it upon others.  She had seen, too, by Mr Harrel, how wretchedly external brilliancy could cover  inward woe, and she had learned at Delvile Castle to grow sick of parade and  grandeur. Her equipage, therefore, was without glare, though not without  elegance, her table was plain, though hospitably plentiful, her servants were  for use, though too numerous to be for labour. The system of her oeconomy, like  that of her liberality, was formed by rules of reason, and her own ideas of  right, and not by compliance with example, nor by emulation with the gentry in  her neighbourhood. But though thus deviating in her actions from the usual customs of the young  and rich, she was peculiarly careful not to offend them by singularity of  manners. When she mixed with them, she was easy, unaffected, and well bred, and  though she saw them but seldom, her good humour and desire of obliging kept  them always her friends. The plan she had early formed at Mrs Harrel's she now  studied daily to put in practice; but that part by which the useless or  frivolous were to be excluded her house, she found could only be supported by  driving from her half her acquaintance. Another part, also, of that project she found still less easy of adoption,  which was solacing herself with the society of the wise, good, and intelligent.  Few answered this description, and those few were with difficulty attainable.  Many might with joy have sought out her liberal dwelling, but no one had idly  waited till the moment it was at her disposal. All who possessed at once both  talents and wealth, were so generally courted they were rarely to be procured;  and all who to talents alone owed their consequence, demanded, if worth  acquiring, time and delicacy to be obtained. Fortune she knew, however, was so  often at war with Nature, that she doubted not shortly meeting those who would  gladly avail themselves of her offered protection. Yet, tired of the murmurs of Mrs Harrel, she longed for some relief from her  society, and her desire daily grew stronger to owe that relief to Henrietta  Belfield. The more she meditated upon this wish, the less unattainable it  appeared to her, till by frequently combating its difficulties, she began to  consider them imaginary: Mrs Belfield, while her son was actually with herself,  might see she took not Henrietta as his appendage; and Mr Delvile, should he  make further enquiries, might hear that her real connection was with the  sister, since she received her in the country, where the brother made no  pretence to follow her. She considered, too, how ill she should be rewarded in  giving up Henrietta for Mr Delvile, who was already determined to think ill of  her, and whose prejudices no sacrifice would remove. Having hesitated, therefore, some time between the desire of present  alleviation, and the fear of future mischief, the consciousness of her own  innocence at length vanquished all dread of unjust censure, and she wrote an  invitation to Henrietta enclosed in a letter to her mother. The answer of Henrietta expressed her rapture at the proposal; and that of Mrs  Belfield made no objection but to the expence. Cecilia, therefore, sent her own maid to travel with her into Suffolk, with  proper directions to pay for the journey. The gratitude of the delighted Henrietta at the meeting was boundless; and her  joy at so unexpected a mark of favour made her half wild. Cecilia suffered it  not to languish for want of kindness to support it; she took her to her bosom,  became the soother of all her cares, and reposed in her, in return, every  thought that led not to Delvile. There, however, she was uniformly silent; solemnly and eternally parted from  him, far from trusting the secret of her former connexion to Henrietta, the  whole study of her life was to drive the remembrance of it from herself. Henrietta now tasted a happiness to which as yet her whole life had been a  stranger; she was suddenly removed from turbulent vulgarity to the enjoyment of  calm elegance; and the gentleness of her disposition, instead of being  tyrannically imposed upon, not only made her loved with affection, but treated  with the most scrupulous delicacy. Cecilia had her share in all the comfort she  bestowed; she had now a friend to oblige, and a companion to converse with. She  communicated to her all her schemes, and made her the partner of her benevolent  excursions; she found her disposition as amiable upon trial, as her looks and  her manners had been engaging at first sight; and her constant presence and  constant sweetness, imperceptibly revived her spirits, and gave a new interest  to her existence. Meantime Mr Monckton, who returned in about a fortnight to the Grove, observed  the encreasing influence of Albany with the most serious concern. The bounties  of Cecilia, extensive, magnificent, unlimited, were the theme of every tongue,  and though sometimes censured and sometimes admired, they were wondered at  universally. He suffered her for a while to go on without remonstrance, hoping  her enthusiasm would abate, as its novelty wore out: but finding that week  following week was still distinguished by some fresh act of beneficence, he  grew so alarmed and uneasy, he could restrain himself no longer. He spoke to  her with warmth, he represented her conduct as highly dangerous in its  consequence; he said she would but court impostors from every corner of the  kingdom, called Albany a lunatic, whom she should rather avoid than obey; and  insinuated that if a report was spread of her proceedings, a charity so  prodigal, would excite such alarm, that no man would think even her large and  splendid fortune, would ensure him from ruin in seeking her alliance. Cecilia heard this exhortation without either terror or impatience, and  answered it with the utmost steadiness. His influence over her mind was no  longer uncontrolled, for though her suspicions were not strengthened, they had  never been removed, and friendship has no foe so dangerous as distrust! She  thanked him, however, for his zeal, but assured him his apprehensions were  groundless, since though she acted from inclination, she acted not without  thought. Her income was very large, and she was wholly without family or  connection; to spend it merely upon herself would be something still worse than  extravagance, it must result from wilfulness the most inexcusable, as her  disposition was naturally averse to luxury and expence. She might save indeed,  but for whom? not a creature had such a claim upon her; and with regard to  herself, she was so provided for it would be unnecessary. She would never, she  declared, run in debt even for a week, but while her estate was wholly clear,  she would spend it without restriction. To his hint of any future alliance, she only said that those who disapproved  her conduct, would probably be those she should disapprove in her turn; should  such an event however take place, the retrenching from that time all her  present peculiar expences, would surely, in a clear ú3000 a-year, leave her  rich enough for any man, without making it incumbent upon her at present, to  deny herself the only pleasure she could taste, in bestowing that money which  to her was superfluous, upon those who received it as the prolongation of their  existence. A firmness so deliberate in a system he so much dreaded, greatly shocked Mr  Monckton, though it intimidated him from opposing it; he saw she was too  earnest, and too well satisfied she was right, to venture giving her disgust by  controverting her arguments; the conversation, therefore, ended with new  discontent to himself, and with an impression upon the mind of Cecilia, that  though he was zealous and friendly, he was somewhat too worldly and suspicious. She went on, therefore, as before, distributing with a lavish hand all she  could spare from her own household; careful of nothing but of guarding against  imposition, which, though she sometimes unavoidably endured, her discernment,  and the activity of her investigating diligence, saved her from suffering  frequently. And the steadiness with which she repulsed those whom she detected  in deceit, was a check upon tricks and fraud, though it could not wholly put a  stop to them. Money, to her, had long appeared worthless and valueless; it had failed to  procure her the establishment for which she once flattered herself it seemed  purposely designed; it had been disdained by the Delviles, for the sake of  whose connection she had alone ever truly rejoiced in possessing it; and after  such a conviction of its inefficacy to secure her happiness, she regarded it as  of little importance to herself, and therefore thought it almost the due of  those whose distresses gave it a consequence to which with her it was a  stranger. In this manner with Cecilia passed the first winter of her majority. She had  sedulously filled it with occupations, and her occupations had proved fertile  in keeping her mind from idleness, and in restoring it to chearfulness. Calls  upon her attention so soothing, and avocations so various for her time, had  answered the great purpose for which originally she had planned them, in almost  forcing from her thoughts those sorrows which, if indulged, would have rested  in them incessantly.
