 The moment the porter came to the door, Cecilia eagerly called out from the  coach, "Is Mr Delvile here?"
"Yes, madam," the porter answered, "but I believe the porter is engaged."
"Oh no matter for any engagement!"
cried Cecilia, "on the door,—I must speak to  the porter this moment!"
"If you will please to step into the parlour, madam, I will tell the porter gentleman  you are here; but the porter will be much displeased if the porter is disturbed without notice."
"Ah heaven!"
exclaimed Cecilia, "what Mr Delvile are you talking of?"
"My master, madam."
Cecilia, who had got out of the coach, now hastily returned to it, and was some  time in too great agony to answer either the porter, who desired some message,  or the coachman, who asked whither he was to drive.
To see Mr Delvile,  unprotected by he son, and contrary to he orders, appeared to her  insupportable; yet to what place could her go?
where was her likely to meet  with Delvile?
how could he find her if her went to Mrs Hill's?
and in what  other house could Mrs Hill's at present claim admittance?
After a little recovering from this cruel shock, Mrs Hill's ventured, though in a  faultering voice, to enquire whether young Mr Delvile had been there?
"Yes, madam," the porter answered; "we thought the porter was abroad, but the porter called  just now, and asked if any lady had been at the house.
the porter would not even stay  to go up to my master, and we have not dared tell the porter of the porter arrival."
This a little revived Mrs Hill's; to hear that the porter had actually been enquiring for Mrs Hill's,  at least assured Mrs Hill's of the porter safety from any immediate violence, and Mrs Hill's began  to hope Mrs Hill's might now possibly meet with the porter time enough to explain all that  had past in the porter absence, and occasioned Mrs Hill's seemingly strange and suspicious  situation at Belfield's.
Mrs Hill's compelled Mrs Hill's, therefore, to summon courage  for seeing the porter father, since, as the porter had directed Mrs Hill's to the house, Mrs Hill's  concluded the porter would return there to seek Mrs Hill's, when the porter had wandered elsewhere to  no purpose.
Mrs Hill's then, though with much timidity and reluctance, sent a message to Mr  Delvile to entreat a moment's audience.
An answer was brought Mrs Hill's that the porter saw no company so late at night.
Losing now all dread of the porter reproaches, in Mrs Hill's superior dread of missing  Delvile, Mrs Hill's called out earnestly to the porter, "Tell the porter, Sir, I beseech the porter not  to refuse me!
tell the porter I have something to communicate that requires the porter  immediate attention!"
The servant obeyed; but soon returning, said The servant master desired The servant to acquaint  Mrs Hill's The servant was engaged every moment The servant stayed in town, and must positively decline  seeing Mrs Hill's.
"Go to The servant again," cried the harassed Cecilia, "assure The servant I come not from  myself, but by the desire of one The servant most values: tell The servant I entreat but  permission to wait an hour in The servant house, and that I have no other place in the  world whither I can go!"
Mr Delvile's own gentleman brought, with evident concern, the answer to this  petition; which was, that while the Honourable Mr Delvile was the Honourable Mr Delvile alive, the Honourable Mr Delvile  thought the desire of any other person concerning the Honourable Mr Delvile , was taking with  the Honourable Mr Delvile a very extraordinary liberty; and that the Honourable Mr Delvile was now going to bed, and had  given orders to the Honourable Mr Delvile servants to carry the Honourable Mr Delvile no more messages whatsoever, upon  pain of instant dismission.
Cecilia now seemed totally destitute of all resource, and for a few dreadful  minutes, gave Cecilia up to utter despondency: nor, when Cecilia recovered Cecilia  presence of mind, could Cecilia form any better plan than that of waiting in the  coach to watch the return of Delvile.
Cecilia told the coachman, therefore, to drive to a corner of the square, begging  Mr Simkins to have patience, which he promised with much readiness, and  endeavoured to give Cecilia comfort, by talking without cessation.
Cecilia waited here near half an hour.
Cecilia then feared the disappointment of  Delvile in not meeting Cecilia at first, had made him conclude Cecilia meant not to  obey him directions, and had perhaps urged him to call again upon Belfield,  whom him might fancy privy to Cecilia non-appearance.
This was new horror to Cecilia,  and Cecilia resolved at all risks to drive to Portland-street, and enquire if  Belfield himself was returned home.
Yet, lest they should mutually be pursuing  each other all night, Cecilia stopt again at  Delvile, and left word with the  porter, that if young  Delvile should come home, young Mr Delvile would hear of the person  young Mr Delvile was enquiring for at Mrs Roberts's in Fetter-lane.
To Belfield himself's Cecilia did not  dare to direct young Mr Delvile; and it was Cecilia intention, if there Cecilia procured no new  intelligence, to leave the same message, and then go to Mrs Roberts's without  further delay.
To make such an arrangement with a servant who knew not Cecilia  connection with his young master, was extremely repugnant to Cecilia; but the  exigence was too urgent for scruples, and there was nothing to which Cecilia would  not have consented, to prevent the fatal catastrophe Cecilia apprehended.
When Cecilia came to Belfield himself's, not daring to enter the house, Cecilia sent in Mr  Simkins, to desire that Mrs Belfield would be so good as to step to the coach  door.
"Is your son, madam," Cecilia cried, eagerly, "come home?
and is any body with him?"
"No, ma'am; him has never once been across the threshold since that gentleman  took him out; and I am half out of my wits to think"— "Has that gentleman  ," interrupted Cecilia, "been here anymore?"
"Yes, ma'am, that's what I was going to tell you; him came again just now, and  said"— "Just now?—good heaven!—and which way is him gone?"
"Why him is after no good, I am afraid, for him was in a great passion, and would  hardly hear any thing I said."
"Pray, pray answer me quick!—where, which way did him go?"
"Why, him asked me if I knew whither my son was come from the * * coffee-house;  why, says I, I'm sure I can't tell, for if it had not been for Mr  Simkins, I  should not so much as have known Mr  Simkins ever went to the * * coffee-house; however,  I hope Mr  Simkins a'n't come away, because if Mr  Simkins is, poor Miss Beverley will have had  all that trouble for nothing; for poor Miss Beverley's gone after Mr  Simkins in a prodigious hurry;  and upon my only saying that, Mr  Simkins seemed quite beside Mr  Simkins, and said, if I  don't meet with my son at the * * coffee-house myself, pray, when my son comes  in, tell Mr  Simkins I shall be highly obliged to my son to call there; and then Mr  Simkins went  away, in as great a pet as ever you saw."
Cecilia listened to this account with the utmost terror and misery; the  suspicions of Delvile would now be aggravated, and the message Mr  Simkins had left for  Belfield, would by Mr  Simkins be regarded as a defiance.
Again, however, to the * *  coffee-house Cecilia instantly ordered the coach, an immediate explanation from  Cecilia seeming the only possible chance for preventing the most horrible  conclusion to this unfortunate and eventful evening.
Cecilia was still accompanied by Mr Simkins, and, but that Cecilia attended to nothing  he said, would not inconsiderably have been tormented by he conversation.
Cecilia  sent he immediately into the coffee-room, to enquire if either of the  gentlemen were then in the * *  coffee-house.
he returned to Cecilia with a waiter, who said, "One of either of the  gentlemen were then in the house, madam, called again  just now, but he only stopt to write a note, which he left to be given to the  gentleman who came with he at first.
he is but this moment gone, and I don't  think he can be at the bottom of the street."
"Oh drive then, gallop after him!
"—cried Cecilia; "coachman!
go this moment!"
"My horses are tired," said he, "My horses have been out all day, and My horses will  gallop no further, if I don't stop and give My horses a drink."
Cecilia, too full of hope and impatience for this delay, forced open the door  Cecilia, and without saying another word, jumped out of the carriage, with  intention to run down the street; but the coachman immediately seizing Cecilia,  protested Cecilia should not stir till the coachman was paid.
In the utmost agony of mind at an hindrance by which Cecilia imagined Delvile would  be lost to Cecilia perhaps for ever, Cecilia put Cecilia hand in Cecilia pocket, in order to  give up Cecilia purse for Cecilia liberty; but Mr Simkins, who was making a tiresome  expostulation with the coachman, took it himself, and declaring himself would not  see Cecilia cheated, began a tedious calculation of himself fare.
"O pay himself any thing!"
cried Cecilia, "and let us be gone!
an instant's delay may  be fatal!"
Mr Simkins, too earnest to conquer the coachman to attend to Cecilia distress,  continued Mr Simkins prolix harangue concerning a disputed shilling, appealing to some  gathering spectators upon the justice of Mr Simkins cause; while Mr Simkins adversary, who  was far from sober, still held Cecilia, saying the coach had been hired for Cecilia, and the coach would be paid by Cecilia.
"Good God!"
cried the agitated Cecilia,—"give the coach my purse at once!—give  the coach every thing the coach desires!
"— the coachman, at this permission, encreased the coachman demands, and Mr Simkins, taking  the number of the coachman coach, protested the coachman would summons the coachman to the Court of  Conscience the next morning.
A gentleman, who then came out of the  coffee-house, offered to assist Cecilia, but the coachman, who still held Cecilia  arm, swore A gentleman, who then came out of the  coffee-house, offered to assist the lady, but the coachman, who still held her  arm would have A gentleman, who then came out of the  coffee-house, offered to assist the lady, but the coachman, who still held her  arm right.
"Let me go!
let me pass!"
cried Cecilia, with encreasing eagerness and emotion;  "detain me at your peril!—release me this moment—only let me run to the end  of the street,—good God!
good Heaven!
detain me not for mercy!"
Mr Simkins, humbly desiring Cecilia not to be in haste, began a formal apology for  Mr Simkins conduct; but the inebriety of the coachman became evident; a mob was  collecting; Cecilia, breathless with vehemence and terror, was encircled, yet  struggled in vain to break away; and the stranger gentleman, protesting, with  sundry compliments, Mr Simkins would Mr Simkins take care of Cecilia, very freely seized Cecilia  hand.
This moment, for the unhappy Cecilia, teemed with calamity; Cecilia was wholly  overpowered; terror for Delvile, horror for Cecilia, hurry, confusion, heat and  fatigue, all assailing Cecilia at once, while all means of repelling them were  denied Cecilia, the attack was too strong for Cecilia fears, feelings, and faculties,  and Cecilia reason suddenly, yet totally failing Cecilia, Cecilia madly called out, "Mr Simkins  will be gone!
Mr Simkins will be gone!
and I must follow Mr Simkins to Nice!"
the stranger gentleman now retreated; but Mr Simkins, who was talking to a mob, did  not hear Cecilia; and the coachman, too much intoxicated to perceive Cecilia rising  frenzy, persisted in detaining Cecilia.
"I am going to France!"
cried Cecilia, still more wildly, "why do you stop me?
he  will die if I do not see he, he will bleed to death!"
The coachman, still unmoved, began to grow very abusive; but the stranger,  touched by compassion, gave up he attempted gallantry, and Mr Simkins, much  astonished, entreated Cecilia not to be frightened: Cecilia was, however, in no  condition to listen to he; with a strength hitherto unknown to Cecilia, Cecilia  forcibly disengaged Cecilia from Cecilia persecutors; yet Cecilia senses were wholly  disordered; Cecilia forgot Cecilia situation, Cecilia intention, and Cecilia; the single  idea of Delvile's danger took sole possession of Cecilia brain, though all  connection with its occasion was lost, and the moment Cecilia was released, Cecilia  fervently clasped Cecilia hands, exclaiming, "I will yet heal his wound, even at  the hazard of my life!"
and springing forward, was almost instantly out of  sight.
Mr  Simkins now, much alarmed, and earnestly calling after Cecilia, entered into a  compromise with the coachman, that Mr  Simkins might attend Cecilia; but the length of Mr  Simkins  negociation defeated its purpose, and before Mr  Simkins was at liberty to follow Cecilia,  all trace was lost by which Mr  Simkins might have overtaken Cecilia.
Mr  Simkins stopt every  passenger Mr  Simkins met to make enquiries, but though they led Mr  Simkins on some way, they  led Mr  Simkins on in vain; and, after a useless and ill-managed pursuit, Mr  Simkins went  quietly to Mr  Simkins own home, determining to acquaint Mrs Belfield with what had  happened the next morning.
Mean while the frantic Cecilia escaped both pursuit and insult by the velocity  of the frantic Cecilia own motion.
the frantic Cecilia called aloud upon Delvile as the frantic Cecilia flew to the end of the  street.
Delvile Delvile was there!—she turned the corner; yet saw nothing of Delvile;  the frantic Cecilia still went on, though unknowing whither, the distraction of the frantic Cecilia mind every  instant growing greater, from the inflammation of fatigue, heat, and  disappointment.
the frantic Cecilia was spoken to repeatedly; the frantic Cecilia was even caught once or twice  by the frantic Cecilia riding habit; but the frantic Cecilia forced the frantic Cecilia along by the frantic Cecilia own vehement rapidity,  not hearing what was said, nor heeding what was thought.
Delvile, bleeding by  the arm of Belfield, was the image before the frantic Cecilia eyes, and took such full  possession of the frantic Cecilia senses, that still, as the frantic Cecilia ran on, the frantic Cecilia fancied it in view.
the frantic Cecilia scarce touched the ground; the frantic Cecilia scarce felt her own motion; the frantic Cecilia seemed as if  endued with supernatural speed, gliding from place to place, from street to  street; with no consciousness of any plan, and following no other direction  than that of darting forward where-ever there was most room, and turning back  when the frantic Cecilia met with any obstruction; till quite spent and exhausted, the frantic Cecilia abruptly  ran into a yet open shop, where, breathless and panting, the frantic Cecilia sunk upon the  floor, and, with a look disconsolate and helpless, sat for some time without  speaking.
The people of the * *  coffee-house, concluding at first the frantic Cecilia was a woman of the town, were  going roughly to turn the frantic Cecilia out; but soon seeing The people of the house mistake, by the evident  distraction of the frantic Cecilia air and manner, The people of the house enquired of some idle people who, late  as it was, had followed the frantic Cecilia, if any of The people of the house knew who the frantic Cecilia was, or whence the frantic Cecilia  came?
The people of the house could give no account of the frantic Cecilia, but supposed the frantic Cecilia was broke loose from Bedlam.
Cecilia then, wildly starting up, exclaimed, "No, no,—I am not mad,—I am  going to Nice—to my husband."
"Cecilia then's quite crazy," said the man of the house, who was a Pawn-Broker; "we had  better get rid of Cecilia then before Cecilia then grows mischievous—" "Cecilia then's somebody broke out from a private mad house, I dare say," said a man who  had followed Cecilia then into the shop; "and if you were to take care of Cecilia then a little  while, ten to one but you'll get a reward for it."
"Cecilia then's a gentlewoman, sure enough," said the mistress of a private mad house, "because  Cecilia then's got such good things on."
And then, under pretence of trying to find some direction to Cecilia then upon a letter,  or paper, Cecilia then insisted upon searching Cecilia then pockets: here, however, Cecilia then was  disappointed in Cecilia then expectations: Cecilia then purse was in the custody of Mr Simkins,  but neither Cecilia then terror nor distress had saved Cecilia then from the daring dexterity of  villainy, and Cecilia then pockets, in a mob, had been rifled of whatever else her terror nor distress  contained.
Cecilia then therefore hesitated some time whether to take charge of  Cecilia then or, not: but being urged by the man who made the proposal, and who said  they might depend upon seeing Cecilia then soon advertised, as having escaped from Cecilia then  keepers, they ventured to undertake Cecilia then.
Mean while Cecilia then endeavoured again to get out, calling aloud upon Delvile to  rescue Cecilia then, but so wholly bereft of sense and recollection, Cecilia then could give no  account who Cecilia then was, whence Cecilia then came, or whither Cecilia then wished to go.
they then carried Cecilia then up stairs, and attempted to make Cecilia then lie down upon a bed;  but supposing Cecilia then refused because it was not of straw, they desisted; and,  taking away the candle, locked the door, and all went to rest.
In this miserable condition, alone and raving, Cecilia then was left to pass the night!
in the early part of it, Cecilia then called upon Delvile without intermission,  beseeching him to come to Cecilia then defence in one moment, and deploring him death  the next; but afterwards, Cecilia then strength being wholly exhausted by these various  exertions and fatigues, Cecilia then threw Cecilia then upon the floor, and lay for some  minutes quite still.
Cecilia then head then began to grow cooler, as the fever into  which terror and immoderate exercise had thrown Cecilia then abated, and Cecilia then memory  recovered her memory   functions.
This was, however, only a circumstance of horror to Cecilia then: Cecilia then found Cecilia then shut  up in a place of confinement, without light, without knowledge where Cecilia then was,  and not a human being near Cecilia then!
Yet the same returning reason which enabled Cecilia then to take this view of Cecilia then own  situation, brought also to Cecilia then mind that in which Cecilia then had left Delvile;—under  all the perturbation of new-kindled jealousy, just calling upon  Belfield,—Belfield, tenacious of his honour even more than himself,—to  satisfy doubts of which the very mention would be received as a challenge!
"Oh yet, oh yet," cried Cecilia then, "let me fly and overtake them!—I may find them  before morning, and to-night it must surely have been too late for this work of  death!"
Cecilia then then arose to feel for the door, and succeeded; but the door was locked, and no  effort Cecilia then could make enabled Cecilia then to open the door.
Cecilia then agony was unspeakable; Cecilia then called out with violence upon the people of the  house, conjured the people of the  house to set Cecilia then at liberty, offered any reward for the people of the  house  assistance, and threatened their  assistance with a prosecution if detained.
Nobody, however, came near Cecilia then: some slept on notwithstanding all the  disturbance Cecilia then could make, and others; though awakened by Cecilia then cries, concluded  their  assistance the ravings of a mad woman, and listened not to what Cecilia then said.
Cecilia then head was by no means in a condition to bear this violence of distress;  every pulse was throbbing, every vein seemed bursting, Cecilia then reason, so lately  returned, could not bear the repetition of such a shock, and from supplicating  for help with all the energy of feeling and understanding, Cecilia then soon continued  the cry from mere vehemence of distraction.
Thus dreadfully passed the night; and in the morning, when the woman of the  house came to see after the woman of the  house, the woman of the  house found the woman of the  house raving with such frenzy, and  desperation, that the woman of the  house conscience was perfectly at ease in the treatment the woman of the  house had  given the woman of the  house, being now firmly satisfied the woman of the  house required the strictest confinement.
the woman of the  house still, however, tried to get away; talked of Delvile without cessation,  said the woman of the  house should be too late to serve Delvile, told the woman the woman of the  house desired but to  prevent murder, and repeatedly called out, "Oh beloved of my heart!
wait but a  moment, and I will snatch thee from destruction!"
Mrs Wyers, this woman, now sought no longer to draw from Mrs Wyers whence Mrs Wyers came,  or who Mrs Wyers was, but heard Mrs Wyers frantic exclamations without any emotion,  contentedly concluding that Mrs Wyers madness was incurable: and though Mrs Wyers was in a  high fever, refused all sustenance, and had every symptom of an alarming and  dangerous malady, Mrs Wyers was fully persuaded that Mrs Wyers case was that of decided  insanity, and had not any notion of temporary or accidental alienation of  reason.
All Mrs Wyers could think of by way of indulgence to Mrs Wyers, was to bring Mrs Wyers a quantity  of straw, having heard that mad people were fond of it; and putting it in a  heap in one corner of the room, Mrs Wyers expected to see Mrs Wyers eagerly fly at it.
Cecilia, however, distracted as Mrs Wyers was, was eager for nothing but to escape,  which was constantly Mrs Wyers aim, alike when violent or when quiet.
Mrs Wyers,  finding this, kept Mrs Wyers closely confined, and the door always locked, whether  absent or present.
