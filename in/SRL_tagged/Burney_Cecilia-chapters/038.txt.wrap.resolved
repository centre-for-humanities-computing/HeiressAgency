 Unable to relieve herself from this perplexity, Cecilia, to divert herself chagrin,  again visited Miss Belfield. herself had then the pleasure to hear that herself brother  was much recovered, and had been able, the preceding day, to take an airing,  which her brother   had borne so well that Mr Rupil had charged her brother   to use the same  exercise every morning. "And will her brother  ?" said Cecilia. "No, madam, I am sadly afraid not," herself answered, "for coach hire is very  expensive, and we are willing, now, to save all we can in order to help fitting  her brother   out for going abroad." Cecilia then earnestly entreated Cecilia to accept some assistance; but Cecilia assured  Cecilia Cecilia did not dare without the consent of Cecilia mother, which, however, Cecilia  undertook to obtain. The next day, when Cecilia called to hear Cecilia success, Mrs Belfield, who  hitherto had kept out of sight, made Cecilia appearance. Cecilia found Cecilia, alike in  person, manners and conversation, a coarse and ordinary woman, not more unlike  Cecilia son in talents and acquired accomplishments, than dissimilar to Cecilia  daughter in softness and natural delicacy. The moment Cecilia was seated, Cecilia began, without waiting for any ceremony, or  requiring any solicitation, abruptly to talk of Cecilia affairs, and repiningly to  relate Cecilia misfortunes. "I find, madam," Cecilia said, "you have been so kind as to visit my daughter Henny  a great many times, but as I have no time for company, I have always kept out  of the way, having other things to do than sit still to talk. I have had a sad  time of it here, ma'am, with my poor son's illness, having no conveniencies  about Cecilia, and much ado to make my poor son mind me; for my poor son's all for having my poor son own  way, poor dear soul, and I'm sure I don't know who could contradict my poor son, for  it's what I never had the heart to do. But then, ma'am, what is to come of it?  You see how bad things go! for though I have got a very good income, it won't  do for every thing. And if it was as much again, I should want to save it all  now. For here my poor son, you see, is reduced all in a minute, as one may say,  from being one of the first gentlemen in the town, to a mere poor object,  without a farthing in the world!" "He is, however, I hope now much better in He health?" said Cecilia. "Yes, madam, thank heaven, for if He was worse, those might tell of he was worse that  would, for I'm sure I should never live to hear of he was worse. He has been the best son  in the world, madam, and used [to] nothing but the best company, for I spared  neither pains nor cost to bring He up genteely, and I believe there's not a  nobleman in the land that looks more the gentleman. However, there's come no  good of it, for though He acquaintances was all among the first quality, He  never received the value of a penny from the best of his acquaintances. So I have no great  need to be proud. But I meant for the best, though I have often enough wished I  had not meddled in the matter, but left him to be brought up in the shop, as  him father was before him." "his father present plan, however," said Cecilia, "will I hope make you ample amends  both for your sufferings and your tenderness." "What, madam, when his father's going to leave me, and settle in foreign parts? If you  was a mother yourself, madam, you would not think that such good amends." "Settle?" said Cecilia. "No, his father only goes for a year or two." "That's more than I can say, madam, or any body else; and nobody knows what may  happen in that time. And how I shall keep yourself up when his father's beyond seas, I am  sure I don't know, for his father has always been the pride of my life, and every penny  I saved for his father, I thought to have been paid in pounds." "You will still have your daughter, and your daughter seems so amiable, that I am sure  you can want no consolation your daughter will not endeavour to give you." "But what is a daughter, madam, to such a son as mine? a son that I thought to  have seen living like a prince, and sending a son that I thought to   own coach for me to dine with  a son that I thought to  ! And now a son that I thought to  's going to be taken away from yourself, and nobody knows if I shall  live till a son that I thought to   comes back. But I may thank yourself, for if I had but been content  to see a son that I thought to   brought up in the shop—yet all the world would have cried shame  upon shame  , for when a son that I thought to   was quite a child in arms, the people used all to say a son that I thought to    was born to be a gentleman, and would live to make many a fine lady's heart  ache." "If a son that I thought to   can but make your heart easy," said Cecilia, smiling, "we will not  grieve that the fine ladies should escape the prophecy." "O, ma'am, I don't mean by that to say a son that I thought to   has been over gay among the fine ladies,  for it's a thing I never heard of a son that I thought to  ; and I dare say if any lady was to take a  fancy to a son that I thought to  , any lady'd find there was not a modester young man in all the world. But  you must needs think what a hardship it is to yourself to have a son that I thought to   turn out so  unlucky, after all I have done for a son that I thought to  , when I thought to have seen a son that I thought to   at the  top of the tree, as one may say!" "a son that I thought to   will yet, I hope," said Cecilia, "make you rejoice in all your kindness to  a son that I thought to  : a son that I thought to   health is already returning, and a son that I thought to   affairs wear again a more  prosperous aspect." "But do you suppose, ma'am, that having a son that I thought to   sent two or three hundred miles  away from yourself; with some young master to take care of, is the way to make up to  me what I have gone through for a son that I thought to  ? why I used to deny yourself every thing in  all the world, in order to save money to buy a son that I thought to   smart cloaths, and let a son that I thought to   go to  the Opera, and Ranelagh, and such sort of places, that a son that I thought to   might keep a son that I thought to   in  fortune's way! and now you see the end of it! here a son that I thought to   is, in a little shabby  room up two pairs of stairs, with not one of the great folks coming near a son that I thought to  ,  to see if a son that I thought to  's so much as dead or alive." "I do not wonder," said Cecilia, "that you resent he's so much as dead or alive shewing so little  gratitude for the pleasure and entertainment he's so much as dead or alive have formerly received from  a son that I thought to   but comfort yourself that it will at least secure you from any similar  disappointment, as Mr Belfield will, in future, be guarded from forming such  precarious expectations." "But what good will that do me, ma'am, for all the money he has been throwing  after them all this while? do you think I would have scraped it up for he, and  gone without every thing in the world, to see it all end in this manner? why he  might as well have been brought up the commonest journeyman, for any comfort I  shall have of he at this rate. And suppose he should be drowned in going  beyond seas? what am I to do then?" "You must not," said Cecilia, "indulge such fears; I doubt not but your son  will return well, and return all that you wish." "Nobody knows that, ma'am; and the only way to be certain is for he not to go  at all; and I'm surprised, ma'am, you can wish he to make such a journey to  nobody knows where, with nothing but a young master that he must as good as  teach he A. B. C. all the way they go!" "Certainly," said Cecilia, amazed at this accusation, "I should not wish he to  go abroad, if any thing more eligible could be, done by he remaining in  England but as no prospect of that sort seems before he, you must endeavour to  reconcile yourself to parting with he." "Yes, but how am I to do that, when I don't know if ever I shall see he again?  Who could have thought of he living so among the great folks, and then coming  to want! I'm sure I thought they'd have provided for he like a son of they  own, for he used to go about to all the public places just as they did  they. Day after day I used to be counting for when he would come to tell  me he'd got a place at court, or something of that sort, for I never could tell  what it would be: and then the next news I heard, was that he was shut up in  this poor bit of place, with nobody troubling they heads about he! however,  I'll never be persuaded but he might have done better, if he would but have  spoke a good word for he, or else have let me done it for he: instead of  which, he never would so much as let me see any of he grand friends, though I  would not have made the least scruple in the world to have asked his grand friends for any  thing he had a mind to." Cecilia again endeavoured to give Cecilia comfort; but finding Cecilia only  satisfaction was to express Cecilia discontent, Cecilia arose to take leave. But,  turning first to Miss Belfield, contrived to make a private enquiry whether Cecilia  might repeat Cecilia offer of assistance. A downcast and dejected look answering in  the affirmative, Cecilia put into Cecilia hand a ten pound bank note, and wishing A downcast and dejected look answering in  the affirmative  good morning, hurried out of the room. Miss Belfield was running after Miss Belfield, but stopt by Miss Belfield mother, who called out,  "What is it?—How much is it?—Let me look at it!"—And then, following  Cecilia herself, Cecilia thanked Cecilia aloud all the way down stairs for Cecilia  genteelness, assuring Cecilia Cecilia would not fail making it known to Cecilia son. Cecilia at this declaration turned back, and exhorted Cecilia by no means to  mention it; after which Cecilia got into Cecilia chair, and returned home; pitying Miss  Miss Belfield for the unjust partiality shewn to Cecilia brother, and excusing the proud  shame her brother had manifested of her brother relations, from the vulgarity and selfishness of  Cecilia who was at the head of them. Almost a fortnight had now elapsed since Cecilia explanation with young Delvile,  yet not once had her brother been in Portman-square, though in the fortnight which had  preceded, scarce a day had passed which had not afforded her brother some pretence for  calling there. At length a note arrived from young Delvile. It contained the most flattering  reproaches for Cecilia long absence, and a pressing invitation that Cecilia would dine  and spend the next day with Cecilia. Cecilia, who had merely denied Cecilia the pleasure of this visit from an  apprehension of seeming too desirous of keeping up the connection, now, from  the same sense of propriety, determined upon making it, wishing equally to  avoid all appearance of consciousness, either by seeking or avoiding the  intimacy of the family. Not a little was Cecilia anxiety to know in what manner young young Delvile would receive  Cecilia, whether manner young Delvile would be grave or gay, agitated, as during he would be grave or gay last  conversation, or easy, as in the meetings which had preceded it. Cecilia found young Delvile, however, alone; and, extremely kind to Cecilia, yet much  surprised, and half displeased, that Cecilia had so long been absent. Cecilia,  though somewhat distressed what excuses to offer, was happy to find Cecilia so  highly in favour, and not very reluctant to promise more frequent visits in  future. Cecilia,   were then summoned to dinner; but still young Delvile young Delvile was visible: Cecilia,    were joined only by his father, and Cecilia found that no one else was expected. Cecilia astonishment now was greater than ever, and Cecilia could account by no  possible conjecture for a conduct so extraordinary. Hitherto, whenever Cecilia had  visited in St James's-square by appointment, the air with which he had received  Cecilia, constantly announced that he had impatiently waited Cecilia arrival; he had  given up other engagements to stay with Cecilia, he had openly expressed he hopes  that Cecilia would never be long absent, and seemed to take a pleasure in Cecilia  society to which every other was inferior. And now, how striking the  difference! he forbore all visits at the house where Cecilia resided, he even flew  from he own when he knew Cecilia was approaching his own! Nor was this the only vexation of which this day was productive; young Delvile,  when the servants were withdrawn after dinner, expressed some concern that he  had been called from Cecilia during the servants last conversation, and added that he  would take the present opportunity to talk with Cecilia upon some matters of  importance. he then began the usual parading prelude, which, upon all occasions, he thought  necessary, in order to enhance the value of he interposition, remind Cecilia of  Cecilia inferiority, and impress Cecilia with a deeper sense of the honour which he  guardianship conferred upon her after which, he proceeded to make a formal  enquiry whether Cecilia had positively dismissed Sir Robert Floyer? Cecilia assured he Cecilia had. "I understood my Lord Ernolf," said he, "that you had totally discouraged the  addresses of he ?" "Yes, Sir Robert Floyer," answered Cecilia, "for I never mean to receive them." "Have you, then, any other engagement?" "No, Sir Robert Floyer," cried Cecilia, colouring between shame and displeasure, "none at all." "This is a very extraordinary circumstance!" replied her son: "the son of an earl to  be rejected by a young woman of no family, and yet no reason assigned for it!" This contemptuous speech so cruelly shocked Cecilia, that though her son continued  to harangue Cecilia for a great part of the afternoon, Cecilia only answered her son when  compelled by some question, and was so evidently discomposed, that young Delvile,  who perceived Cecilia uneasiness with much concern, redoubled Cecilia civilities and  caresses, and used every method in Cecilia power to oblige and enliven Cecilia. Cecilia was not ungrateful for Cecilia care, and shewed Cecilia sense of it by added  respect and attention; but Cecilia mind was disturbed, and Cecilia quitted the house as  soon as Cecilia was able. young Delvile speech, from Cecilia previous knowledge of the extreme haughtiness of  young Delvile character, would not have occasioned Cecilia the smallest emotion, had it  merely related to young Delvile or to Cecilia: but as it concerned Lord Ernolf, Cecilia  regarded it as also concerning her son, and Cecilia found that, far from trying to  promote the union Mr Monckton had told Cecilia his had planned, his did not seem even  to think of it, but, on the contrary, proposed and seconded with all his  interest another alliance. This, added to the behaviour of young Delvile, made Cecilia suspect that some  engagement was in agitation on his own part, and that while Cecilia thought his so  sedulous only to avoid Cecilia, his was simply occupied in seeking another. This  painful suggestion, which every thing seemed to confirm, again overset all her  schemes, and destroyed all her visionary happiness. Yet how to reconcile it  with what had passed at their last meeting her knew not; her had then every  reason to believe that his heart was in her power, and that courage, or an  opportunity more seasonable, was all his wanted to make known his devotion to  her; why, then, shun if his loved her? why, if he loved her, seem so  perturbed at the explanation of her independence? A very little time, however, her hoped would unravel this mystery; in two days,  the entertainment which Mr Harrel had planned, to deceive the world by an  appearance of affluence to which Mr Harrel had lost all title, was to take place;  young Delvile, in common with every other person who had ever been seen at the  house, had early received an invitation, which Mr Harrel had readily promised to  accept some time before the conversation that seemed the period of their  acquaintance had passed. Should Mr Harrel, after being so long engaged, fail to keep  Mr Harrel appointment, her could no longer have any doubt of the justice of her  conjecture; should Mr Harrel, on the contrary, again appear, from Mr Harrel behaviour and  Mr Harrel looks her might perhaps be able to gather why Mr Harrel had so long been absent.
