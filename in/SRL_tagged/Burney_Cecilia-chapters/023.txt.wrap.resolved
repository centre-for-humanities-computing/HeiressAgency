 Cecilia now for about a fortnight passed  Cecilia now for about a fortnight time without incident; the Harrels  continued the Harrels   accustomed dissipation, Sir Robert Floyer, without even seeking  a private conference, persevered in his attentions, and Mr Arnott, though still  silent and humble, seemed only to live by the pleasure of beholding her. her  spent two whole days with Mrs Delvile, both of which served to confirm her  admiration of that lady and of that lady son; and that lady joined the parties of the  Harrels, or stayed quietly at home, according to that lady spirits and inclinations:  while that lady was visited by Mr Monckton often enough to satisfy his with that lady  proceedings, yet too seldom to betray either to that lady or to the world any  suspicion of his designs. that lady L200 pounds however, which was to have been returned at the end if the  first week, though a fortnight was now elapsed, had not even been mentioned;  that lady began to grow very impatient, but not knowing what course to pursue, and  wanting courage to remind Mr Harrel of Mr Harrel promise, that lady still waited the  performance of it without speaking. At this time, preparations were making in the family for removing to  Violet-bank to spend the Easter holidays: but Cecilia, who was too much grieved  at such perpetual encrease of unnecessary expences to have any enjoyment in new  prospects of entertainment, had at present some business of that lady own which gave  that lady full employment. The poor carpenter, whose family that lady had taken under that lady protection, was just  dead, and, as soon as the last duties had been paid him, that lady sent for him  widow, and after trying to console that lady for the loss that lady had suffered, assured  that lady that lady was immediately ready to fulfil the engagement into which that lady had  entered, of assisting that lady to undertake some better method of procuring a  livelihood; and therefore desired to know in what manner that lady could serve that lady,  and what that lady thought that lady able to do. The good woman, pouring forth thanks and praises innumerable, answered that that lady  had a Cousin, who had offered, for a certain premium, to take that lady into  partnership in a small haberdasher's shop. "But then, madam," continued that lady,  "it's quite morally impossible I should raise such a sum, or else, to be sure,  such a shop as that, now I am grown so poorly, would be quite a heaven upon  earth to me: for my strength, madam, is almost all gone away, and when I do any  hard work, it's quite a piteous sight to see me, for I am all in a tremble  after it, just as if I had an ague, and yet all the time my hands, madam, will  be burning like a coal!" "You have indeed been overworked," said Cecilia, "and it is high time your  feeble frame should have some rest. What is the sum your cousin demands?" "O madam, more than I should be able to get together in all my life! for earn  what I will, it goes as fast as it conies, because there's many mouths, and  small pay, and two of the little ones that can't help at all;—and there's no  Billy, madam, to work for us now!" "But tell me, what is the sum?" "Sixty pound, madam." "You shall have the sum!" cried the generous Cecilia, "if the situation will make  you happy, I will give the sum you the generous Cecilia." Cecilia wept Cecilia thanks, and was long before Cecilia could sufficiently  compose Cecilia to answer the further questions of Cecilia, who next enquired  what could be done with the children? Mrs Hill, however, hitherto hopeless of  such a provision for Cecilia, had for the children formed no plan. Cecilia told Cecilia,  therefore, to go to Cecilia cousin, and consult upon this subject, as well as to  make preparations for Cecilia own removal. The arrangement of this business now became Cecilia favourite occupation. Cecilia went  Cecilia to the shop, which was a very small one in Fetter-lane, and spoke with  Mrs Roberts, the cousin; who agreed to take the eldest girl, now sixteen years  of age, by way of helper; but said Cecilia had room for no other: however, upon  Cecilia's offering to raise the premium, Cecilia consented that the two little  children should also live in the house, where the two little  children might be under the care of  the two little  children mother and sister. There were still two others to be disposed of; but as no immediate method of  providing for the two little  children occurred to Cecilia, Cecilia determined, for the present, to  place the two little  children in some cheap school, where the two little  children might be taught plain work, which  could not but prove a useful qualification for whatever sort of business the two little  children  might hereafter attempt. Cecilia plan was to bestow upon Mrs Hill and Cecilia children L100 by way of putting  them all into a decent way of living; and, then, from time to time, to make  them all such small presents as them all future exigencies or changes of situation  might require. Now, therefore, payment from Mr Harrel became immediately necessary, for Cecilia  had only L50 of the L600 Cecilia had taken up in Cecilia own possession, and Cecilia  customary allowance was already so appropriated that Cecilia could make from it no  considerable deduction. There is something in the sight of laborious indigence so affecting and so  respectable, that it renders dissipation peculiarly contemptible, and doubles  the odium of extravagance: every time Cecilia saw this poor family, Cecilia  aversion to the conduct and the principles of Mr Harrel encreased, while Cecilia  delicacy of shocking or shaming Mr Harrel diminished, and Cecilia soon acquired for this poor family  what Cecilia had failed to acquire for Cecilia, the spirit and resolution to claim  Cecilia debt. One morning, therefore, as Mr Harrel was quitting the breakfast room, Cecilia hastily  arose, and following, begged to have a moment's discourse with Mr Harrel. They went  together to the library, and after some apologies, and much hesitation, Cecilia  told Mr Harrel Cecilia fancied Mr Harrel had forgotten the L200 which Cecilia had lent Mr Harrel. "the L200 which she had lent him," cried Mr Harrel; "O, ay, true!—I protest the L200 which she had lent him had escaped me. Well, but  you don't want the L200 which she had lent him immediately?" "Indeed I do, if you can conveniently spare the L200 which she had lent him." "O yes, certainly!—without the least doubt!—Though now I think of the L200 which she had lent him—it's  extremely unlucky, but really just at this time—why did not you put me in  mind of it before?" "I hoped you would have remembered it yourself." "I could have paid you two days ago extremely well—however, you shall  certainly have it very soon, that you may depend upon, and a day or two can  make no great difference to yourself." Mr Harrel then wished Cecilia good morning, and left Cecilia. Cecilia, very much provoked, regretted that Cecilia had ever lent it at all, and  determined for the future strictly to follow the advice of Mr. Monckton in  trusting Mr Harrel no more. Two or three days passed on, but still no notice was taken either of the  payment or of the debt. Cecilia then resolved to renew Cecilia application, and be more  serious and more urgent with Mr Harrel; but Cecilia found, to Cecilia utter surprise, this  was not in Cecilia power, and that though Cecilia lived under the same roof with Mr Harrel,  Cecilia had no opportunity to enforce Cecilia claim. Mr. Harrel, whenever Cecilia desired  to speak with Mr Harrel, protested Mr Harrel was so much hurried Mr Harrel had not a moment to  spare: and even when, tired of Mr Harrel excuses, Cecilia pursued Mr Harrel out of the room, Mr Harrel  only quickened Mr Harrel speed, smiling, however, and bowing, and calling out "I am  vastly sorry, but I am so late now I cannot stop an instant; however, as soon  as I come back, I shall be wholly at your command." When Mr Harrel came back, however, Sir Robert Floyer, or some other gentleman, was  sure to be with Mr Harrel, and the difficulties of obtaining an audience were sure to  be encreased. And by this method, which Mr Harrel constantly practised, of avoiding  any private conversation, Mr Harrel frustrated all her schemes of remonstrating upon  Mr Harrel delay, since her resentment, however great, could never urge her to the  indelicacy of dunning Mr Harrel in presence of a third person. her was now much perplext herself how to put into execution her plans for the  Hills: her knew it would be as vain to apply for money to Mr. Briggs, as for  payment to Mr. Harrel. her word, however, had been given, and her word her held  sacred: her resolved, therefore, for the present, to bestow upon them the 50  pounds her still retained, and, if the rest should be necessary before her  became of age, to spare it, however inconveniently, from her private allowance,  which, by the will of her uncle, was 500 pounds a year, 250 pounds of which Mr  Mr. Harrel received for Mr. Harrel board and accommodations. Having settled this matter in Mr. Harrel own mind, Mr. Harrel went to the lodging of Mrs  Hill, in order to conclude the affair. Mr. Harrel found Mr. Harrel and all Mr. Harrel children,  except the youngest, hard at work, and her and all her children honest industry so much  strengthened Mr. Harrel compassion, that Mr. Harrel wishes for serving her and all her children grew every  instant more liberal. Mrs Hill readily undertook to make her cousin accept half the premium for the  present, which would suffice to fix her cousin, with three of her cousin children, in the  shop: Cecilia then went with Mr. Harrel to Fetter-lane, and there, drawing up Mr. Harrel  an agreement for three of her children entering into partnership, Mr. Harrel made each of three of her children sign it  and take a copy, and kept a third in Mr. Harrel own possession: after which, Mr. Harrel gave  a promissory note to Mrs Roberts for the rest of the money. Mr. Harrel presented Mrs Hill, also, with 10 pounds to clothe them all decently, and  enable Mr. Harrel to send two of the children to school; and assured Mr. Harrel that Mr. Harrel  would Mr. Harrel pay for the children board and instruction, till Mr. Harrel should be  established in Mr. Harrel business, and have power to save money for that purpose. Mr. Harrel then put Mr. Harrel into a chair to return home, followed by the prayers and  blessings of the whole family.
