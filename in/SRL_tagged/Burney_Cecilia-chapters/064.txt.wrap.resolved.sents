 One week only, however, had yet tried the perseverance of Cecilia, when, while  Cecilia was working with Mrs Charlton in Cecilia dressing-room, Cecilia maid hastily  entered it, and with a smile that seemed announcing welcome news, said, "Lord,  ma'am, here's Fidel!"
and, at the same moment, Cecilia was followed by the dog, who  jumpt upon Cecilia in a transport of delight.
"Good heaven," cried Cecilia, all amazement, "who has brought him?
whence does him  come?"
"A country man brought him, ma'am; but A country man only put him in, and would not stay a  minute."
"But whom did him enquire for?—who saw him?—what did him?—what say?"
"him?—what saw Ralph, ma'am."
Ralph, then, was instantly called: and these questions being repeated, Ralph said,  "Ma'am, it was a man I never saw before; but a man I never saw before only bid me take care to  deliver the dog into your own hands, and said you would have a letter about a man I never saw before  soon, and then went away: I wanted a man I never saw before to stay till I came up stairs, but a man I never saw before  was off at once."
Cecilia, quite confounded by this account, could make neither comment nor  answer; but, as soon as the servants had left the room, Mrs Charlton entreated  to know to whom the dog had belonged, convinced by Mrs Charlton extreme agitation, that  something interesting and uncommon must relate to Mrs Charlton.
This was no time for disguise; astonishment and confusion bereft Cecilia of all  power to attempt all  ; and, after a very few evasions, Mrs Charlton briefly communicated  Mrs Charlton situation with respect to Delvile, Mrs Charlton leaving Mrs Charlton, Mrs Charlton motives, and Mrs Charlton  mother's evident concurrence: for these were all so connected with Mrs Charlton  knowledge of Fidel, that Mrs Charlton led to these unavoidably in telling what Mrs Charlton knew  of Mrs Charlton.
Very little penetration was requisite, to gather from Mrs Charlton manner all that was  united in Mrs Charlton narrative of Mrs Charlton own feelings and disappointment in the course of  this affair: and Mrs Charlton, who had hitherto believed the whole world at Mrs Charlton  disposal, and that Mrs Charlton continued single from no reason but Mrs Charlton own difficulty  of choice, was utterly amazed to find that any man existed who could withstand  the united allurements of so much beauty, sweetness, and fortune.
Mrs Charlton felt  Mrs Charlton sometimes inclined to hate, and at other times to pity him; yet  concluded that Mrs Charlton own extreme coldness was the real cause of him flight, and  warmly blamed a reserve which had thus ruined Mrs Charlton happiness.
Mrs Charlton was in the extremest perplexity and distress to conjecture the meaning  of so unaccountable a present, and so strange a message.
Delvile, Mrs Charlton knew, had  desired the dog might follow Delvile to Bristol; Delvile mother, always pleased to  oblige Delvile, would now less than ever neglect any opportunity; Mrs Charlton could not,  therefore, doubt that Mrs Charlton had sent or taken Delvile thither, and thence, according  to all appearances, Delvile must now come.
But was it likely Delvile would take such  a liberty?
Was it probable, when so lately Delvile had almost exhorted Mrs Charlton to forget  Delvile, Delvile would even wish to present Mrs Charlton with such a remembrance of Delvile?
And  what was the letter Mrs Charlton was bid to expect?
Whence and from what was it to come?
All was inexplicable!
the only thing Mrs Charlton could surmise, with any semblance of  probability, was that the whole was some frolic of Lady Honoria Pemberton, who  had persuaded Delvile to send Mrs Charlton the dog, and perhaps assured Delvile Mrs Charlton had  Mrs Charlton requested to have Delvile.
Provoked by this suggestion, Mrs Charlton first thought was instantly having Delvile  conveyed to the Castle; but uncertain what the whole affair meant, and hoping  some explanation in the letter Mrs Charlton was promised, Mrs Charlton determined to wait till it  came, or at least till Mrs Charlton heard from Mrs Delvile, before Mrs Charlton took any measures  Mrs Charlton in the business.
Mutual accounts of their safe arrivals at Bristol and  in Suffolk, had already passed between Mutual accounts of their safe arrivals at Bristol and  in Suffolk, and Mrs Charlton expected very soon to have  further intelligence: though Mrs Charlton was now, by the whole behaviour of Mrs  Delvile, convinced Mrs Charlton wished not again to have Mrs Charlton an inmate of Mrs Charlton house, and  that the rest of Mrs Charlton minority might pass, without opposition; in the house of  Mrs Charlton.
Day after day, however, passed, and yet Mrs Charlton heard nothing more; a week, a  fortnight elapsed, and still no letter came.
Mrs Charlton now concluded the promise was  a deception, and repented that Mrs Charlton had waited a moment with any such  expectation.
Mrs Charlton peace, during this time, was greatly disturbed; this present  made Mrs Charlton fear Mrs Charlton was thought meanly of by Mrs  Delvile; the silence of Mrs  Delvile  mother gave Mrs Charlton apprehensions for Mrs  Delvile health, and Mrs Charlton own irresolution how to  act, kept Mrs Charlton in perpetual inquietude.
Mrs Charlton tried in vain to behave as if this  incident had not happened; Mrs Charlton mind was uneasy, and the same actions produced  not the same effects; when Mrs Charlton now worked or read, the sight of Fidel by Mrs Charlton  side distracted Mrs Charlton attention; when Mrs Charlton walked, it was the same, for Fidelalways followed Mrs Charlton; and though, in visiting Mrs Charlton old acquaintance, Mrs Charlton forbore  to let Fidel accompany Mrs Charlton, Mrs Charlton was secretly planning the whole time the contents  of some letter, which Mrs Charlton expected to meet with, on returning to Mrs Charlton's.
Those gentlemen in the country who, during the life-time of the Dean, had paid  Those gentlemen in the country who, during the life-time of the Dean, had paid  their addresses to Cecilia addresses to Cecilia, again waited upon Mrs Charlton at Mrs Charlton's, and  renewed Those gentlemen in the country who, during the life-time of the Dean, had paid  their addresses to Cecilia proposals.
Those gentlemen in the country who, during the life-time of the Dean, had paid  their addresses to Cecilia had now, however, still less chance of success,  and Those gentlemen in the country who, during the life-time of the Dean, had paid  their addresses to Cecilia dismission was brief and decisive.
Among Those gentlemen in the country who, during the life-time of the Dean, had paid  their addresses to Cecilia came Mr Biddulph; and to Mr Biddulph Cecilia was involuntarily most civil,  because Cecilia knew Mr Biddulph to be the friend of Delvile.
Yet Mr Biddulph conversation  encreased the uneasiness of Cecilia suspence; for after speaking of the family in  general which Cecilia had left, Mr Biddulph enquired more particularly concerning Delvile,  and then added, "I am, indeed, greatly grieved to find, by all the accounts I  receive of Mr Biddulph, that Mr Biddulph is now in a very bad state of health."
This speech gave Cecilia fresh subject for apprehension; and in proportion as the  silence of Delvile grew more alarming, Cecilia regard for Cecilia favourite Fidel  became more partial.
The affectionate animal seemed to mourn the loss of The affectionate animal  master, and while sometimes Cecilia indulged Cecilia in fancifully telling The affectionate animal Cecilia  fears, Cecilia imagined Cecilia read in The affectionate animal countenance the faithfullest sympathy.
One week of Cecilia minority was now all that remained, and Cecilia was soon wholly  occupied in preparations for coming of age.
Cecilia purposed taking possession of a  large house that had belonged to Cecilia uncle, which was situated only three miles  from that of Mrs Charlton; and Cecilia employed Cecilia in giving orders for  fitting it up, and in hearing complaints, and promising indulgencies, to  various of Cecilia tenants.
At this time, while Cecilia was at breakfast one morning, a letter arrived from Mrs  Delvile.
Cecilia apologised for not writing sooner, but added that various family  occurrences, which had robbed Cecilia of all leisure, might easily be imagined,  when Cecilia acquainted Cecilia that Mortimer had determined upon again going  abroad.... various family  occurrences, which had robbed her of all leisure, might easily be imagined,  when she acquainted her that Mortimer had determined upon again going  abroad were all, Cecilia said, returned to Delvile Castle, but mentioned  nothing either of the health of Cecilia son, or of Cecilia own regret, and filled up  the rest of Cecilia letter, with general news and expressions of kindness: though,  in a postscript, was inserted, "We have lost We poor Fidel."
Cecilia was still meditating upon this letter, by which Cecilia perplexity how to  act was rather encreased than diminished, when, to Cecilia great surprise, Lady  Honoria Pemberton was announced.
Honoria Pemberton hastily begged one of the Miss Charltons  to convey Fidel out of sight, from a dread of Honoria Pemberton raillery, should Honoria Pemberton, at  last, be unconcerned in the transaction, and then went to receive Honoria Pemberton.
Lady Honoria, who was with Honoria Pemberton governess, gave a brief history of Honoria Pemberton quitting  Delvile Castle, and said Honoria Pemberton was now going with Honoria Pemberton father to visit a noble  family in Norfolk: but Honoria Pemberton had obtained her father permission to leave her father at the inn  where Lady Honoria, who was with her governess had slept, in order to make a short excursion to Bury, for the  pleasure of seeing Miss Beverley.
"And therefore," Honoria Pemberton continued, "I can stay but half an hour; so you must give  me some account of yourself as fast as possible."
"What account does your ladyship require?"
"Why, who you live with here, and who are your companions, and what you do with  yourself."
"Why, I live with Mrs Charlton; and for companions, I have at least a score;  here are Mrs Charlton two grand-daughters, and Mrs and Miss—."
"Pho, pho," interrupted Lady Honoria, "but I don't mean such hum-drum  companions as those; you'll tell me next, I suppose, of the parson and his wife  and three daughters, with all the parson and his wife  and three daughters cousins and aunts: I hate those sort of  people.
What I desire to hear of is, who are your particular favourites; and  whether you take long walks here, as you used to do at the Castle, and who you  have to accompany you?"
And then, looking at her very archly, her added, "A  pretty little dog, now, I should think, would be vastly agreeable in such a  place as this.—Ah, Miss Beverley!
you have not left off that trick of  colouring, I see!"
"If I colour now," said Cecilia, fully convinced of the justness of her  suspicions, "I think it must be for your ladyship, not myself; for, if I am not  much mistaken, either in person, or by proxy, a blush from Lady Honoria  Honoria Pemberton would not, just now, be wholly out of season."
"Lord," cried Honoria Pemberton, "how like that is to a speech of Delvile!
Honoria Pemberton has  taught you exactly Honoria Pemberton manner of talking.
But do you know I am informed you  have got Fidel with Delvile here?
O fie, Miss Beverley!
What will papa and mamma  say, when they find you have taken away poor little master's plaything?"
"And O fie, Lady Honoria!
what shall I say, when I find you guilty of this  mischievous frolic!
I must beg, however, since you have gone thus far, that you  will proceed a little farther, and send back the dog to the person from whom  you received the dog."
"No, not I!
manage the dog all your own way: if you chuse to accept dogs from  gentlemen, you know, it is your affair, and not mine."
"If you really will not return the dog Delvile, you must at least pardon me should  you hear that I do in your ladyship's name."
Lady Honoria for some time only laughed and rallied, without coming to any  explanation; but when Lady Honoria had exhausted all the sport Lady Honoria could make, Lady Honoriafrankly owned that Lady Honoria had Lady Honoria ordered the dog to be privately stolen, and  then sent a man with a man to Mrs Charlton's.
"But you know," Lady Honoria continued, "I really owed you a spite for being so  ill-natured as to run away after sending me to call Mortimer to comfort and  take leave of you."
"Do you dream, Lady Honoria?
when did I send you?"
"Why you know you looked as if you wished it, and that was the same thing.
But  really it made me appear excessively silly, when I had forced him to come back  with me, and told him you were waiting for him,—to see nothing of you at all,  and not be able to find or trace you.
him took it all for my own invention."
"And was it not your own invention?"
"Why that's nothing to the purpose; I wanted him to believe you sent me, for I  knew else him would not come."
"Your ladyship was a great deal too good!"
"Why now suppose I had brought you together, what possible harm could have  happened from Your ladyship?
Your ladyship would merely have given each of you some notion of a fever  and ague; for first you would both have been hot, and then you would both have  been cold, and then you would both have turned red, and then you would bothhave turned white, and then you would both have pretended to simper at the  trick; and then there would have been an end of it."
"This is a very easy way of settling it all," cried Cecilia laughing; "however,  you must be content to abide by your own theft, for you cannot in conscience  expect I should take conscience   upon me."
"You are terribly ungrateful, I see," said Your ladyship, "for all the trouble  and contrivance and expence I have been at merely to oblige you, while the  whole time, poor Mortimer, I dare say, has had Mortimer sweet Pet advertised in all  the newspapers, and cried in every market-town in the kingdom.
By the way, if  you do send Mortimer back, I would advise you to let your man demand the reward that  has been offered for Mortimer, which may serve in part of payment for Mortimer travelling  expenses."
Cecilia could only shake Cecilia head, and recollect Mrs Delvile's expression, that  Cecilia levity was incorrigible.
"O if you had seen," Cecilia continued, "how sheepish Mortimer looked when I told  Mortimer you were dying to see Mortimer before Mortimer set off!
Mortimer coloured so!—just as you  do now!—but I think you're vastly alike."
"I fear, then," cried Cecilia, not very angry at This speech, "there is but  little chance Your ladyship should like either of us."
"O yes, I do!
I like odd people of all things."
"Odd people?
and in what are we so very odd?"
"O, in a thousand things.
You're so good, you know, and so grave, and so  squeamish."
"Squeamish?
how?"
"Why, you know, you never laugh at the old folks, and never fly at your  servants, nor smoke people before people faces, and are so civil to the old  fograms, you would make one imagine you liked nobody so well.
By the way, I  could do no good with my little Lord Derford; my little Lord Derford pretended to find out I was  only laughing at my little Lord Derford, and so my little Lord Derford minded nothing I told my little Lord Derford.
I dare say, however,  my little Lord Derford made the detection, for I am sure my little Lord Derford had not wit enough to discover  it my little Lord Derford."
Cecilia then, very seriously began to entreat that Cecilia would return the dog  Cecilia, and confess Cecilia frolic, remonstrating in strong terms upon the  mischievous tendency and consequences of such inconsiderate flights.
"Well," cried Cecilia, rising, "this is all vastly true; but I have no time to hear  any more of it just now; besides, it's only forestalling my next lecture from  Delvile, for you talk so much alike, that it is really very perplexing to  me to remember which is which."
Cecilia then hurried away, protesting Cecilia had already outstayed Cecilia father's  patience, and declaring the delay of another minute would occasion half a dozen  expresses to know whether Cecilia was gone towards Scotland or Flanders.
This visit, however, was both pleasant and consolatory to Cecilia; who was now  relieved from Cecilia suspence, and revived in Cecilia spirits by the intelligence that  Delvile had no share in sending Cecilia a present, which, from him, would have been  humiliating and impertinent.
Cecilia regretted, indeed, that Cecilia had not instantly  returned it to the castle, which Cecilia was now convinced was the measure Cecilia  ought to have pursued; but to make all possible reparation, Cecilia determined that  Cecilia own servant should set out with her own servant the next morning to Bristol, and take a  letter to Delvile to explain what had happened, since to conceal a  letter from  any delicacy to Lady Honoria, would be to expose Cecilia to suspicions the most  mortifying, for which that gay and careless young lady would never thank Cecilia.
Cecilia gave orders, therefore, to her own servant to get ready for the journey.
When Cecilia communicated these little transactions to Mrs Charlton, that  kind-hearted old lady, who knew Cecilia fondness for Fidel, advised Cecilia not yet to  part with Mrs Charlton, but merely to acquaint Delvile where Mrs Charlton was, and what Lady  Honoria had done, and, by leaving to Lady  Honoria the care of settling Lady  Honoria  restoration, to give Cecilia, at least, an opportunity of offering Lady  Honoria to Cecilia  acceptance.
Cecilia, however, would listen to no such proposal; Cecilia saw the firmness of Delvile in Delvile resolution to avoid Cecilia, and knew that policy, as well as  propriety, made that policy necessary Cecilia should part with what Cecilia could only retain to  remind Cecilia of one whom Cecilia now most wished to forget.
