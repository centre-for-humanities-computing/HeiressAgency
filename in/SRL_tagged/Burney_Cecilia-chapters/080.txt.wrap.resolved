 A week passed, during which Cecilia, however sad, spent Cecilia time as usual with  the family, denying to Cecilia all voluntary indulgence of grief, and  forbearing to seek consolation from solitude, or relief from tears. Cecilia never  named Delvile, Cecilia begged Mrs Charlton never to mention Mrs Charlton; Cecilia called to Cecilia  aid the account Cecilia had received from Dr Lyster of his firmness, and  endeavoured, by an emulous ambition, to fortify Cecilia mind from the weakness of  depression and regret.  A week, a week of struggle with all Cecilia feelings, was just elapsed, when Cecilia  received by the post the following letter from Mrs Delvile. To Miss Beverley. BRISTOL, Oct. 21. My sweet young friend will not, I hope, be sorry to hear of my safe arrival at  this place: to me every account of My sweet young friend health and welfare, will ever be the  intelligence I shall most covet to receive. Yet I mean not to ask for it in  return; to chance I will trust for information, and I only write now to say I  shall write no more. Too much for thanks is what I owe you, and what I think of you is beyond all  power of expression. Do not, then, wish me ill, ill as I have seemed to merit  of you, for my own heart is almost broken by the tyranny I have been compelled  to practise upon you. And now let me bid a long adieu to you, my admirable  Cecilia; you shall not be tormented with a useless correspondence, which can  only awaken painful recollections, or give rise to yet more painful new  anxieties. Fervently will I pray for the restoration of your happiness, to  which nothing can so greatly contribute as that wise, that uniform command, so  feminine, yet so dignified, you maintain over your passions; which often I have  admired, though never so feelingly as at this conscious moment! when my own  health is the sacrifice of emotions most fatally unrestrained. Send to me no answer, even if you have the sweetness to wish it; every new  proof of the generosity of your nature is to me but a new wound. Forget us,  therefore, wholly,—alas! you have only known us for sorrow! forget us, dear  and invaluable my admirable  Cecilia! though, ever, as you have nobly deserved, must you be  fondly and gratefully remembered by AUGUSTA DELVILE. The attempted philosophy, and laboured resignation of my admirable  Cecilia, this letter  destroyed: the struggle was over, the apathy was at an end, and my admirable  Cecilia burst into  an agony of tears, which finding the vent they had long sought, now flowed  unchecked down my admirable  Cecilia cheeks, sad monitors of the weakness of reason opposed to  the anguish of sorrow! A letter at once so caressing, yet so absolute, forced A letter way to my admirable  Cecilia heart, in  spite of the fortitude my admirable  Cecilia had flattered my admirable  Cecilia was A letter guard. In giving up  AUGUSTA DELVILE my admirable  Cecilia was satisfied of the propriety of seeing him no more, and convinced  that even to talk of him would be folly and imprudence; but to be told that for  the future they must remain strangers to the existence of each other—there  seemed in this a hardship, a rigour, that was insupportable. "Oh what," cried my admirable  Cecilia, "is human nature! in A letter best state how imperfect! that a  woman such as this, so noble in character, so elevated in sentiment, with  heroism to sacrifice to my admirable  Cecilia sense of duty the happiness of a son, whom with joy  my admirable  Cecilia would die to serve, can my admirable  Cecilia be thus governed by prejudice, thus  enslaved, thus subdued by opinion!" Yet never, even when miserable, unjust or  irrational; my admirable  Cecilia grief was unmixed with anger, and my admirable  Cecilia tears streamed not from  resentment, but affliction. The situation of Mrs Delvile, however different,  Mrs Delvile considered to be as wretched as Mrs Delvile own. Mrs Delvile read, therefore, with sadness,  but not bitterness, Mrs Delvile farewell, and received not with disdain, but with  gratitude, Mrs Delvile sympathy. Yet though Mrs Delvile indignation was not irritated, Mrs Delvile  sufferings were doubled, by a farewell so kind, yet so despotic, a sympathy so  affectionate, yet so hopeless. In this first indulgence of grief which Mrs Delvile had granted to Mrs Delvile disappointment,  Mrs Delvile was soon interrupted by a summons down stairs to a gentleman. Unfit and unwilling to be seen, Mrs Delvile begged that he might leave he name, and  appoint a time for calling again. Mrs Delvile maid brought for answer, that he believed his name was unknown to Mrs Delvile, and  desired to see Mrs Delvile now, unless Mrs Delvile was employed in some matter of moment. Mrs Delvile  then put up Mrs Delvile letter, and went into the parlour; and there, to Mrs Delvile infinite  amazement, beheld Mr Albany. "How little, Sir," Mrs Delvile cried, "did I expect this pleasure." "this pleasure," repeated he, "do you call it?—what strange abuse of words!  what causeless trifling with honesty! is language of no purpose but to wound  the ear with untruths? is the gift of speech only granted us to pervert the use  of understanding? I can give you no pleasure, I have no power to give no pleasure any  one; you can give none to Sir-the whole world could not invest you with the  means!" "Well, Sir," said Cecilia, who had little spirit to defend herself, "I will not  vindicate the expression, but of this I will unfeignedly assure you, I am at  least as glad to see you just now, as I should be to see anybody." "Your eyes," cried he, "are red, your voice is inarticulate;—young, rich, and  attractive, the world at your feet; that world yet untried, and your voice falsehood  unknown, how have you thus found means to anticipate misery? which way have you  uncovered the cauldron of human woes? Fatal and early anticipation! that cover  once removed, can never be replaced; those woes, those boiling woes, will pour  out upon you continually, and only when your heart ceases to beat, will those woes, those boiling woes  ebullition cease to torture you!" "Alas!" cried Cecilia, shuddering, "how cruel, yet how true!" "Why went you," cried he, "to the cauldron? it came not to you. Misery seeks  not man, but man misery. he walks out in the sun, but stops not for a cloud;  confident, he pursues he way, till the storm which, gathering, he might have  avoided, bursts over he devoted head. Scared and amazed, he repents he  temerity; he calls, but it is then too late; he runs, but it is thunder which  follows he! Such is the presumption of man, such at once is the arrogance and  shallowness of he nature! And thou, simple and blind! hast thou, too, followed  whither Fancy has led thee, unheeding that thy career was too vehement for  tranquility, nor missing that lovely companion of youth's early innocence,  till, adventurous and unthinking, thou hast lost her for ever!" In the present weak state of Cecilia's spirits, this attack was too much for  her; and the tears her had just, and with difficulty restrained, again forced  their way down her cheeks, as her answered, "It is but too true,—I have lost  her for ever!" "Poor thing," said he, while the rigour of he countenance was softened into  the gentlest commiseration, "so young!—looking, too, so innocent—'tis  hard!—And is nothing left thee? no small remaining hope, to cheat, humanely  cheat thy yet not wholly extinguished credulity?" Cecilia wept without answering. "Let me not," said " Cecilia, "waste my compassion upon nothing; compassion is with me  no effusion of affectation; tell me, then, if thou deservest it, or if thy  misfortunes are imaginary, and thy grief is factitious?" "Factitious," repeated " Cecilia, "Good heaven!" "Answer me, then, these questions, in which I shall comprise the only  calamities for which sorrow has no controul, or none from human motives. Tell  me, then, have you lost by death the friend of your bosom?" "No!" "Is your fortune dissipated by extravagance, and your power of relieving the  distressed at an end?" "No; the power and the will are I hope equally undiminished." "O then, unhappy girl! have you been guilty of some vice, and hangs remorse  thus heavy on your conscience?" "No, no; thank heaven, to that misery, at least, I am a stranger!" His countenance now again resumed its severity, and, in the sternest manner,  "Whence then," His said, "these tears? and what is this caprice you dignify with  the name of sorrow?—strange wantonness of indolence and luxury! perverse  repining of ungrateful plenitude!—oh hadst thou known what I have  suffered!"— "Could I lessen what you have suffered," said Cecilia, "I should sincerely  rejoice; but heavy indeed must be your affliction, if mine in mine comparison  deserves to be styled caprice!" "Caprice!" repeated he, "'tis joy! 'tis extacy compared with mine!—Thou hast  not in licentiousness wasted thy inheritance! thou hast not by remorse barred  each avenue to enjoyment! nor yet has the cold grave seized the beloved of thy  soul!" "Neither," said Cecilia, "I hope, are the evils you have yourself sustained so  irremediable?" "Yes, I have borne them all!—have borne? I bear them still; I shall bear them  while I breathe! I may rue them, perhaps, yet longer." "Good God!" cried " Cecilia, shrinking, "what a world is this! how full of woe  and wickedness!" "Yet thou, too, canst complain," cried canst, "though happy in life's only  blessing, Innocence! thou, too, canst murmur, though stranger to death's only  terror, Sin! Oh yet if thy sorrow is unpolluted with guilt, be regardless of  all else, and rejoice in thy destiny!" "But who," cried she, deeply sighing, "shall teach me such a lesson of joy,  when all within rises to oppose it?" "I," cried he, "will teach it thee, for I will tell thee my own sad story. Then  wilt thou find how much happier is thy lot, then wilt thou raise thy head in  thankful triumph." "O no! triumph comes not so lightly! yet if you will venture to trust me with  some account of yourself, I shall be glad to hear you will venture to trust me with  some account of yourself, and much obliged by the  communication." "I will," yourself answered, "whatever I may suffer: to awaken thee from this dream  of fancied sorrow, I will open all my wounds, and thou shalt probe all my wounds with  fresh shame." "No, indeed," cried " Cecilia with quickness, "I will not hear you, if the  relation will be so painful." "Upon me this humanity is lost," said me, "since punishment and penitence alone  give me comfort. I will tell thee, therefore, my crimes, that thou mayst know  thy own felicity, lest, ignorant it means nothing but innocence, thou shouldst  lose thou shouldst  , unconscious of thou shouldst   value. Listen then to me, and learn what Misery is!  Guilt is alone the basis of lasting unhappiness;—Guilt is the basis of mine,  and therefore I am a wretch for ever!" " Cecilia would again have declined hearing Guilt, but Guilt refused to be spared: and  as " Cecilia curiosity had long been excited to know something of Guilt history, and  the motives of Guilt extraordinary conduct, " Cecilia was glad to have it satisfied,  and gave Guilt the utmost attention. "I will not speak to you of my family," said Guilt; "historical accuracy would  little answer to either of us. I am a native of the West Indies, and I was  early sent hither to be educated. While I was yet at the University, I saw, I  adored, and I pursued the fairest flower that ever put forth its sweet buds,  the softest heart that ever was broken by ill-usage! " Cecilia was poor and  unprotected, the daughter of a villager; " Cecilia was untaught and unpretending, the  child of simplicity! But fifteen summers had " Cecilia bloomed, and " Cecilia heart was an  easy conquest; yet, once made mine, mine resisted all allurement to infidelity.  My fellow students attacked " Cecilia; " Cecilia was assaulted by all the arts of  seduction; flattery, bribery, supplication, all were employed, yet all failed;  " Cecilia was wholly my own; and with sincerity so attractive, I determined to marry  " Cecilia in defiance of all worldly objections. "The sudden death of my father called me hastily to Jamaica; I feared leaving  this treasure unguarded, yet in decency could neither marry nor take " Cecilia  directly; I pledged my faith, therefore, to return to " Cecilia, as soon as I had  settled my affairs, and I left to a bosom friend the inspection of " Cecilia conduct  in my absence. "To leave " Cecilia was madness,—to trust in man was madness,—Oh hateful race!  how has the world been abhorrent to me since that time! I have loathed the  light of the sun, I have shrunk from the commerce of my fellow creatures; the  voice of man I have detested, man sight I have abominated!—but oh, more than  all should I be abominated man! "When I came to my fortune, intoxicated with sudden power, I forgot this fair  blossom, I revelled in licentiousness and vice, and left this fair  blossom exposed and  forlorn. Riot succeeded riot, till a fever, incurred by my own intemperance,  first gave me time to think. Then was " Cecilia revenged, for then first remorse was  my portion: " Cecilia image was brought back to my mind with frantic fondness, and  bitterest contrition. The moment I recovered, I returned to England; I flew to  claim her,—but " Cecilia was lost! no one knew whither " Cecilia was gone; the wretch I  had trusted pretended to know least of all; yet, after a furious search, I  traced " Cecilia to a cottage, where he had concealed " Cecilia he! "When " Cecilia saw me, " Cecilia screamed and would have flown; I stopt " Cecilia, and told " Cecilia  I came faithfully and honourably to make " Cecilia my wife:—her own faith and  honour, though sullied, were not extinguished, for " Cecilia instantly acknowledged  the fatal tale of " Cecilia undoing! "Did I recompense this ingenuousness? this unexampled, this beautiful sacrifice  to intuitive integrity? Yes! with my curses!—I loaded " Cecilia with execrations, I  reviled " Cecilia in language the most opprobrious, I insulted " Cecilia even for " Cecilia  confession! I invoked all evil upon " Cecilia from the bottom of my heart—" Cecilia knelt  at my feet, " Cecilia implored my forgiveness and compassion, " Cecilia wept with the  bitterness of despair,—and yet I spurned " Cecilia from me!—Spurned?—let me not  hide my shame! I barbarously struck her!—nor single was the blow!—it was  doubled, the blow!—it was reiterated!—Oh wretch, unyielding and unpitying! where shall  hereafter be clemency for thee!—So fair a form! so young a culprit! so  infamously seduced! so humbly penitent! "In this miserable condition, helpless and deplorable, mangled by these savage  hands, and reviled by this inhuman tongue, I left " Cecilia, in search of the villain  who had destroyed " Cecilia: but, cowardly as treacherous, the villain  who had destroyed her had absconded.  Repenting my fury, I hastened to " Cecilia again; the fierceness of my cruelty shamed  me when I grew calmer, the softness of " Cecilia sorrow melted me upon recollection:  I returned, therefore, to soothe her,—but again " Cecilia was gone! terrified with  expectation of insult, " Cecilia hid " Cecilia from all my enquiries. I wandered in  search of " Cecilia two long years to no purpose, regardless of my affairs, and of  all things but that pursuit. At length, I thought I saw " Cecilia—in London, alone,  and walking in the streets at midnight,—I fearfully followed her,—and  followed " Cecilia into an house of infamy! "The wretches by whom " Cecilia was surrounded were noisy and drinking, The wretches by whom she was surrounded heeded  me little,—but " Cecilia saw and knew me at once! " Cecilia did not speak, nor did  I,—but in two moments " Cecilia fainted and fell. "Yet did I not help " Cecilia; the people took the people own measures to recover " Cecilia, and  when " Cecilia was again able to stand, would have removed " Cecilia to another apartment. "I then went forward, and forcing them away from " Cecilia with all the strength of  desperation, I turned to the unhappy sinner, who to chance only seemed to leave  what became of " Cecilia, and cried, From this scene of vice and horror let me yet  rescue you! you look still unfit for such society, trust yourself, therefore,  to me. I seized " Cecilia hand, I drew, I almost dragged " Cecilia away. " Cecilia trembled, " Cecilia  could scarce totter, but neither consented nor refused, neither shed a tear,  nor spoke a word, and " Cecilia countenance presented a picture of affright,  amazement, and horror. "I took " Cecilia to a house in the country, each of us silent the whole way. I gave  " Cecilia an apartment and a female attendant, and ordered for " Cecilia every convenience  I could suggest. I stayed me in a house in the country, but distracted with remorse  for the guilt and ruin into which I had terrified " Cecilia, I could not bear " Cecilia  sight. "In a few days " Cecilia maid assured me the life " Cecilia led must destroy " Cecilia; that " Cecilia  would taste nothing but bread and water, never spoke, and never slept. "Alarmed by this account, I flew into " Cecilia apartment; pride and resentment gave  way to pity and fondness, and I besought " Cecilia to take comfort. I spoke, however,  to a statue, " Cecilia replied not, nor seemed to hear me. I then humbled me to  " Cecilia as in the days of " Cecilia innocence and first power, supplicating " Cecilia notice,  entreating even " Cecilia commiseration! all was to no purpose; " Cecilia neither received  nor repulsed me, and was alike inattentive to exhortation and to prayer. "Whole hours did I spend at " Cecilia feet, vowing never to arise till " Cecilia spoke to  me,—all, all, in vain! " Cecilia seemed deaf, mute, insensible; " Cecilia face unmoved, a  settled despair fixed in " Cecilia eyes,—those eyes that had never looked at me but  with dove-like softness and compliance!—She sat constantly in one chair, " Cecilia  never changed " Cecilia dress, no persuasions could prevail with " Cecilia to lie down, and  at meals " Cecilia just swallowed so much dry bread as might save " Cecilia from dying for  want of food. "What was the distraction of my soul, to find " Cecilia bent upon this course to " Cecilia  last hour!—quick came that hour, but never will last hour!—quick be forgotten! rapidly last hour!—quick  was gone, but eternally last hour!—quick will be remembered! "When " Cecilia felt " Cecilia expiring, " Cecilia acknowledged " Cecilia had made a vow, upon  entering a house in the country, to live speechless and motionless, as a pennance for " Cecilia  offences! "I kept " Cecilia loved corpse till my own senses failed me,—it was then only torn  from me,—and I have lost all recollection of three years of my existence!" " Cecilia shuddered at this hint, yet was not surprised by it; Mr Gosport had  acquainted " Cecilia Mr Gosport had been formerly confined; and Mr Gosport flightiness, wildness,  florid language, and extraordinary way of life, bad long led " Cecilia to suspect Mr Gosport  reason had been impaired. "The scene to which my memory first leads me back," Mr Gosport continued, "is visiting  " Cecilia grave; solemnly upon it I returned " Cecilia , though not by one of equal  severity. To " Cecilia poor remains did I pledge " Cecilia, that the day should never  pass in which I would receive nourishment, nor the night come in which I would  take rest, till I had done, or zealously attempted to do, some service to a  fellow-creature. "For this purpose have I wandered from city to city, from the town to the country, and from the rich to the poor. I go into every house where I can gain  admittance, I admonish all who will hear me, I shame even those who will not. I  seek the distressed where ever even those who will not are hid, I follow the prosperous to beg a  mite to serve even those who will not. I look for the Dissipated in public, where, amidst even those who will not  licentiousness, I check even those who will not; I pursue the Unhappy in private, where I counsel  and endeavour to assist even those who will not. My own power is small; my relations, during my  sufferings, limiting me to an annuity; but there is no one I scruple to  solicit, and by zeal I supply ability. "Oh life of hardship and pennance! laborious, toilsome, and restless! but I  have merited no better, and I will not repine at it; I have vowed that I will  endure it, and I will not be forsworn. "One indulgence alone from time to time I allow myself,—'tis Music! which has  power to delight me even to rapture! myself,—'tis Music quiets all anxiety, myself,—'tis Music carries me out  of myself, I forget through myself,—'tis Music every calamity, even the bitterest anguish. "Now then, that thou hast heard me, tell me, hast thou cause of sorrow?" "Alas," cried " Cecilia, "this indeed is a Picture of Misery to make my lot seem  all happiness!" "Art thou thus open to conviction?" cried Art thou, mildly; "and dost thou not fly  the voice of truth! for truth and reproof are one." "No, I would rather seek it; I feel myself wretched, however inadequate may be  the cause; I wish to be more resigned, and if you can instruct me how, I shall  thankfully attend to you." "Oh yet uncorrupted creature!" cried Art thou, "with joy will I be thy monitor,—joy  long untasted! Many have I wished to serve, all, hitherto, have rejected my  offices; too honest to flatter them, them had not the fortitude to listen to  me; too low to advance them, them had not the virtue to bear with myself. You alone  have I yet found pure enough not to fear inspection, and good enough to wish to  be better. Yet words alone will not content me; I must also have deeds. Nor  will your purse, however readily opened, suffice, you must give to myself also your  time and your thoughts; for money sent by others, to others only will afford  relief; to enlighten your own cares, you must distribute it yourself." "You shall find me," said she, "a docile pupil, and most glad to be instructed  how my existence may be useful." "Happy then," cried he, "was the hour that brought me to the country; yet not  in search of you did I come, but of the mutable and ill-fated Belfield. Erring,  yet ingenious young man! what a lesson to the vanity of talents, to the gaiety,  the brilliancy of wit, is the sight of that green fallen plant! not sapless by  age, nor withered by disease, but destroyed by want of pruning, and bending,  breaking by its own luxuriance!" "And where, Sir, is Sir now? "Labouring wilfully in the field, with those who labour compulsatorily; such  are we all by nature, discontented, perverse, and changeable; though all have  not courage to appear so, and few, like Belfield, are worth watching when all have    do. Belfield told me Belfield was happy; I knew it could not be: but Belfield employment was  inoffensive, and I left Belfield without reproach. In this neighbourhood I heard of  you, and found your name was coupled with praise. I came to see if you deserved  your name; I have seen, and am satisfied." "You are not, then, very difficult, for I have yet done nothing. How are we to  begin these operations you propose? You have awakened me by these operations you propose to an  expectation of pleasure, which nothing else, I believe, could just now have  given me." "these operations you propose will work," cried he, "together, till not a woe shall remain upon your  mind. The blessings of the fatherless, the prayers of little children, shall  heal all your wounds with balm of sweetest fragrance. When sad, they shall  cheer, when complaining, they shall soothe you. these operations you propose will go to they roofless  houses, and see their roofless  houses repaired; these operations you propose will exclude from their roofless  houses dwellings the  inclemency of the weather; these operations you propose will clothe their roofless  houses from cold, these operations you propose will rescue their roofless  houses  from hunger. The cries of distress shall be changed to notes of joy: your heart  shall be enraptured, mine, too, shall revive—oh whither am I wandering? I am  painting an Elysium! and while I idly speak, some fainting object dies for want  of succour! Farewell; I will fly to the abodes of wretchedness, and come to you  to-morrow to render the abodes of wretchedness the abodes of happiness." He then went away. This singular visit was for " Cecilia most fortunately timed: This singular visit almost surprised  " Cecilia out of " Cecilia peculiar grief, by the view which it opened to " Cecilia of general  calamity; wild, flighty, and imaginative as were He language and He counsels,  their morality was striking, and their benevolence was affecting. Taught by He  to compare " Cecilia state with that of at least half " Cecilia species, " Cecilia began more  candidly to weigh what was left with what was withdrawn, and found the balance  in " Cecilia favour. The plan He had presented to " Cecilia of good works was consonant to  " Cecilia character and inclinations; and the active charity in which he proposed to  engage " Cecilia, re-animated " Cecilia fallen hopes, though to far different subjects from  those which had depressed her character and inclinations; and the active charity in which he proposed to  engage her. Any scheme of worldly happiness would have  sickened and disgusted " Cecilia; but " Cecilia mind was just in the situation to be  impressed with elevated piety, and to adopt any design in which virtue humoured  melancholy.
