 As Cecilia now found Cecilia cleared, at least, of all suspicions of harbouring  too tender a regard for Mr Belfield, Cecilia objections to visiting Mr Belfield sister were  removed, and the morning after Cecilia return to Mr Harrel's, Cecilia went in a chair  to Swallow-street.
Cecilia sent Cecilia servant up stairs to enquire if Cecilia might be admitted, and was  immediately taken into the room where Cecilia had twice before been received.
In a few minutes Miss Belfield, softly opening and shutting the door of the  next apartment, made Cecilia appearance.
Cecilia looked thin and pale, but much  gratified by the sight of Cecilia.
"Ah madam!"
Cecilia cried, "you are good indeed  not to forget a chair  !
and you can little think how it cheers and consoles me, that  such a lady as you can condescend to be kind to me.
It is quite the only  pleasure that I have now in the whole world."
"I grieve that you have no greater;" cried Cecilia, "you seem much fatigued and  harassed.
How is your brother?
I fear you neglect your own health, by too much  attention to your brother."
"No, indeed, madam; my mother does everything for your brother my mother, and hardly  suffers anybody else to go near your brother."
"What, then, makes you so melancholy?"
said Cecilia, taking my mother hand; "you do  not look well; your anxiety, I am sure, is too much for your strength."
"How should I look well, madam," answered my mother, "living as I live?
However, I  will not talk of my mother, but of my brother,—O my brother,—O is so ill!
Indeed I am  sadly, sadly afraid my brother,—O will never be well again!"
"What does my brother,—O surgeon say?
You are too tender, and too much frightened to be  any judge."
"It is not that I think my mother my brother,—O will die of my brother,—O wound, for Mr Rupil says the  wound is almost nothing; but my brother,—O is in a constant fever, and so thin, and so  weak, that indeed it is almost impossible my brother,—O should recover!"
"You are too apprehensive," said Cecilia, "you know not what effect the country  air may have upon my brother,—O; there are many, many expedients that with so young a man  may yet be successful."
"O no, the country air can do nothing for my brother,—O!
for I will not deceive you,  madam, for that would be doubly a fault when I am so ready in blaming other  people for wearing false appearances: besides, you are so good and so gentle,  that it quite composes me to talk with you.
So I will honestly speak the truth,  and the whole truth at once; my poor brother is lost—O I fear for ever  lost!—all by his own unhappy pride!
his forgets his father was a tradesman, his  is ashamed of all his family, and his whole desire is to live among the  grandest people, as if his belonged to no other.
And now that his can no longer  do that, his takes the disappointment so to heart that his cannot get the better  of it; and his told me this morning that his wished his was dead, for his did not  know why his should live only to see his own ruin!
But when his saw how I cried  at his saying so, his was very sorry indeed, for his has always been the kindest  brother in the world, when his has been away from the great folks who have  spoilt his: 'But why,' said his, 'Henrietta, why would you have me live, when  instead of raising you and my poor mother into an higher station, I am sunk so  low, that I only help to consume your own poor pittances to support me in my  disgrace!'"
"I am sorry indeed," said Cecilia, "to find his has so deep a sense of the  failure of his expectations: but how happens it that you are so much wiser?
Young and inexperienced as you are, and early as you must have been accustomed,  from your mother as well as from Mr Belfield, to far other doctrine, the  clearness of your judgment, and the justness of your remarks, astonish as much  as they charm me."
"Ah madam!
Brought up as I have been brought up, there is little wonder I  should see the danger of an high education, let me be ever so ignorant of  everything else; for I, and all my sisters, have been the sufferers the whole  time: and while we were kept backward, that he might be brought forward, while  we were denied comforts, that he might have luxuries, how could we help seeing  the evil of so much vanity, and wishing we had all been brought up according to  we proper station?
instead of living in continual inconvenience, and having  one part of a family struggling with distress, only to let another part of  our proper station  appear in a way he had no right to!"
"How rationally," said Cecilia, "have you considered this subject!
and how much  do I honour you for the affection you retain for your brother, notwithstanding  the wrongs you have suffered to promote your brother elevation!"
"Indeed your brother deserves it; take but from your brother that one fault, pride, and I believe  your brother has not another: and humoured and darling child as from your brother infancy your brother has  always been, who at that can wonder, or be angry?"
"And your brother has still no plan, no scheme for your brother future destination?"
"No, madam, none at all; and that it is makes your brother so miserable, and being so  miserable makes your brother so ill, for Mr Rupil says that with such uneasiness upon  Mr Rupil mind, Mr Rupil can never, in Mr Rupil present low state, get well.
O it is melancholy  to see how Mr Rupil is altered!
and how Mr Rupil has lost all Mr Rupil fine spirits!
Mr Rupil that  used to be the life of us all!—And now all!—And hardly ever speaks a word, or if all!—And  does, all!—And says something so sorrowful that it cuts us to the soul!
But  yesterday, when my mother and I thought all!—And was asleep, all!—And lifted up all!—And head,  and looked at us both with the tears in all!—And eyes, which almost broke us hearts  to see, and then, in a low voice, all!—And said 'What a lingering illness is this!
Ah, my dear mother, you and poor Henrietta ought to wish it quicker over!
for  should I recover, my life, hereafter, will but linger like a lingering illness.'
And  afterwards all!—And called out, 'what on earth is to become of all!—And?
I shall never have  health for the army, nor interest, nor means; what am I to do?
subsist in the  very prime of my life upon the bounty of a widowed mother!
or, with such an  education, such connections as mine, enter at last into some mean and sordid  business?'"
"It seems, then," said Cecilia, "he now less wants a physician than a friend."
"he has a friend, madam, a noble friend, would he but accept he services; but  he never sees he without suffering fresh vexation, and he fever encreases  after every visit he pays he."
"Well," said Cecilia, rising, "I find we shall not have an easy task to manage  he; but keep up your spirits, and assure yourself he shall not be lost, if it  be possible to save he."
Cecilia then, though with much fearfulness of offending, once more made an offer of  Cecilia purse.
Miss Belfield no longer started at the proposal; yet, gratefully  thanking Miss Belfield, said Miss Belfield was not in any immediate distress, and did not dare risk  the displeasure of Miss Belfield brother, unless driven to Miss Belfield by severer necessity.
Cecilia, however, drew from Miss Belfield a promise that Miss Belfield would apply to Miss Belfield in any  sudden difficulty, and charged Miss Belfield never to think Miss Belfield without a banker  while Miss Belfield direction was known to Miss Belfield.
Miss Belfield then bid Miss Belfield adieu, and returned home; meditating the whole way upon some  plan of employment and advantage for Mr Belfield, which by clearing his  prospects, might revive his spirits, and facilitate his recovery: for since his  mind was so evidently the seat of his disease, Miss Belfield saw that unless Miss Belfield could do  more for his, Miss Belfield had yet done nothing.
Miss Belfield meditation, however, turned to no account; Miss Belfield could suggest nothing, for  Miss Belfield was ignorant what was eligible to suggest.
The stations and employments of  men Miss Belfield only knew by occasionally hearing that such were men professions, and  such men situations in life; but with the means and gradations by which men  arose to men Miss Belfield was wholly unacquainted.
Mr Monckton, Miss Belfield constant resource in all cases of difficulty, immediately  occurred to Miss Belfield as Miss Belfield most able counsellor, and Miss Belfield determined by the first  opportunity to consult with her most able counsellor upon the subject, certain of advice the most  judicious from her most able counsellor experience, and knowledge of the world.
But though Miss Belfield rested upon her most able counsellor Miss Belfield serious expectations of assistance, another  idea entered Miss Belfield mind not less pleasant, though less promising of utility: this  was to mention Miss Belfield views to young Delvile.
her most able counsellor was already, Miss Belfield knew, well  informed of the distress of Mr Belfield, and Miss Belfield hoped, by openly asking her most able counsellor  opinion, to confirm to her most able counsellor Miss Belfield freedom from any engagement with that gentleman,  and convince her most able counsellor, at the same time, by Miss Belfield application to her most able counsellor, that Miss Belfield was  equally clear of any tie with the Baronet.
