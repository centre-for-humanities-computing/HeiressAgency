 Cecilia's next progress, therefore, was to St James's-square, whither  Cecilia went  in the utmost anxiety, from  Cecilia uncertainty of the reception with which  Cecilia  proposal would meet. The servants informed  Cecilia that Mr and Mrs Delvile were at breakfast, and that  the Duke of Derwent and Mr two daughters were with the Duke of Derwent and his two daughters. Before such witnesses to relate the reasons of  Cecilia leaving the Harmless was  impossible; and from such a party to send for Mrs Delvile, would, by  Cecilia  stately guardian, be deemed an indecorum unpardonable.  Cecilia was obliged,  therefore, to return to Portman-square, in order to open  Cecilia cause in a letter  to Mrs Delvile. Mr Arnott, flying instantly to meet  Cecilia, called out, "O madam, what alarm has  your absence occasioned! My sister believed My sister should see you no more, MrHarrel feared a premature discovery of Harrel purposed retreat, and we have all  been under the cruellest apprehensions lest you meant not to come back." "I am sorry I spoke not with you before I went out," said Cecilia, accompanying  Harrel to the library, "but I thought you were all too much occupied to miss me. I  have been, indeed, preparing for a removal, but I meant not to leave your  sister without bidding your  sister adieu, nor, indeed, to quit any part of the family  with so little ceremony. Is Harrel still firm to Harrel last plan?" "I fear so! I have tried what is possible to dissuade Harrel, and your  sisterhas wept without ceasing. Indeed, if your  sister will take no consolation, I believe I  shall do what your  sister pleases, for I cannot bear the sight of your  sister in such distress." "You are too generous, and too good!" said Cecilia, "and I know not how, while  flying from danger myself, to forbear counselling you to avoid   also." "Ah madam!" cried Harrel, "the greatest danger for myself is what I have now no power  to run from!" Cecilia, though Cecilia could not but understand Harrel, felt not the less Harrel friend  for knowing Harrel the humblest of Cecilia admirers; and as Cecilia saw the threatening  ruin to which Harrel too great tenderness exposed Harrel, Cecilia kindly said "Mr Arnott,  I will speak, to Harrel without reserve. It is not difficult to see that the  destruction which awaits Mr Harrel, is ready also to ensnare Mr Harrel  brother-in-law: but let not that blindness to the future which we have so often  lamented for Mr Harrel, hereafter be lamented for Harrel. Till Mr Harrel present  connections are broken, and Mr Harrel way of living is changed, nothing can be done  for Mr Harrel, and whatever you were to advance, would merely be sunk at the gaming  table. Reserve, therefore, your liberality till it may indeed be of service to  Mr Harrel, for believe me, at present, Mr Harrel mind is as much injured as Mr Harrel fortune." "And is it possible, madam," said Mr Arnott, in an accent of surprize and  delight, "that you can deign to be interested in what may become of Mr Arnott! and  that my sharing or escaping the ruin of this house is not wholly indifferent to  you?" "Certainly not," answered Cecilia; "as the brother of my earliest friend, I can  never be insensible to your welfare." "Ah madam!" cried "Ah madam, "as Cecilia brother!—Oh that there were any other tie!—" "Think a little," said Cecilia, preparing to quit the room, "of what I have  mentioned, and, for your sister's sake, be firm now, if you would be kind  hereafter." "I will be any and every thing," cried "Ah madam, "that Miss Beverley will command." Cecilia, fearful of any misinterpretation, then came back, and gravely said,  "No, Sir, be ruled only by your own judgment: or, should my advice have any  weight with you, remember my advice is given from the most disinterested motives, and  with no other view than that of securing your power to be of service to your  sister." "For your  sister's sake, then, have the goodness to hear my situation, and  honour me with further directions." "You will make me fear to speak," said Cecilia, "if you give so much  consequence to my opinion. I have seen, however, nothing in your conduct I have  ever wished changed, except too little attention to your own interest and  affairs." "Ah!" cried he, "with what rapture should I hear those words, could I but  imagine—" "Come, come," said Cecilia, smiling, "no digression! You called me back to talk  of your sister; if you change your subject, perhaps you may lose your auditor." "I would not, madam, for the world encroach upon your goodness; the favour I  have found has indeed always exceeded my expectations, as the favour I  have found has always  surpassed my desert: yet has the favour I  have found never blinded me to my own unworthiness. Do  not, then, fear to indulge me with your conversation; I shall draw from the favour I  have found no  inference but of pity, and though pity from Miss Beverley is the sweetest balm  to my heart, it shall never seduce me to the encouragement of higher hopes." Cecilia had long had reason to expect such a declaration, yet Cecilia heard such a declaration with  unaffected concern, and looking at he with the utmost gentleness, said "Mr  Arnott, your regard does me honour, and, were it somewhat more rational, would  give me pleasure; take, then, from it what is more than I wish or merit, and,  while you preserve the rest, be assured the rest will be faithfully returned." "Your rejection is so mild," cried he, "that I, who had no hope of acceptance,  find relief in having at last told my sufferings. Could I but continue to see  you every day, and to be blest with your conversation, I think I should be  happy, and I am sure I should be grateful." "You are already," answered Cecilia, shaking Cecilia head, and moving towards the door,  "infringing the conditions upon which our friendship is to be founded." "Do not go, madam," he cried, "till I have done what you have just promised to  permit, acquainted you with my situation, and been honoured with your advice. I  must own to you, then, that £5000, which I had in the stocks, as well as a  considerable sum in a banker's hands, I have parted with, as I now find for  ever but I have no heart for refusal, nor would my sister at this moment be  thus distressed, but that I have nothing more to give without I cut down my  trees, or sell some farm, since all I was worth, except my landed property, is  already gone. What, therefore, I can now do to save Mr Harrel from this  desperate expedition I know not." "I am sorry," said Cecilia, "to speak with severity of one so nearly connected  with you, yet, suffer me to ask, why should Mr Harrel be saved from it at all? and  what is there Mr Harrel can at present do better? Has not Mr Harrel long been threatened with  every evil that is now arrived? have our not both warned Mr Harrel, and have not the  clamours of Mr Harrel creditors assailed Mr Harrel? yet what has been the consequence? Mr Harrel  has not submitted to the smallest change in Mr Harrel way of life, Mr Harrel has not denied  Mr Harrel a single indulgence, nor spared any expence, nor thought of any  reformation. Luxury has followed luxury, and Mr Harrel has only grown fonder of  extravagance, as extravagance has become more dangerous. Till the present  storm, therefore, blows over, leave Mr Harrel to Mr Harrel fate, and when a calm succeeds,  I will Mr Harrel, for the sake of Priscilla, aid you to save what is possible of  the wreck." "All you say, madam, is as wise as it is good, and now I am acquainted with  your opinion, I will wholly new model Mr Harrel upon it, and grow as steady  against all attacks as hitherto I have been yielding." Cecilia was then retiring; but again detaining Cecilia, Cecilia Said "You spoke, madam,  of a removal, and indeed it is high time you should quit this scene: yet I hope  you intend not to go till to-morrow, as Mr Harrel has declared your leaving Mr Harrel  sooner will be Mr Harrel destruction." "Heaven forbid," said Cecilia, "for I mean to be gone with all the speed in my  power." "Mr Harrel," answered Cecilia, "did not explain Cecilia; but I believe Cecilia apprehends  your deserting Cecilia house at this critical time, will raise a suspicion of Cecilia  own design of going abroad, and make Cecilia creditors interfere to prevent Cecilia." "To what a wretched state," cried Cecilia, "has Cecilia reduced Cecilia! I will not,  however, be the voluntary instrument of Cecilia disgrace; and if you think my stay  is so material to Cecilia security, I will continue here till to-morrow morning." Mr Arnott almost wept Mr Arnott thanks for this concession, and Cecilia, happy in  making this concession to Mr Arnott instead of Mr Harrel, then went to Mr Harrel own room, and wrote the  following letter to Mrs Delvile. To the Hon. Mrs Delvile, St James's-square. PORTMAN SQUARE, June 12. DEAR MADAM,—I am willing to hope you have been rather surprised that I have  not sooner availed the Hon of the permission with which you yesterday honoured  me of spending this whole day with you, but, unfortunately for the Hon, I am  prevented waiting upon you even for any part of it. Do not, however, think me  now ungrateful if I stay away, nor to-morrow impertinent, if I venture to  enquire whether that apartment which you had once the goodness to appropriate  to my use, may then again be spared for the Hon! The accidents which have prompted  this strange request will, I trust, be sufficient apology for the liberty I  take in making it, when I have the honour to see you, and acquaint you what  they are.—I am, with the utmost respect, Dear Madam, your most obedient  humble servant, CECILIA BEVERLEY. Dear Madam would not have been thus concise, had not the caution of Mr Arnott made Dear Madam  fear, in the present perilous situation of affairs, to trust the secret of MrHarrel to paper. The following answer was returned Dear Madam from Mrs Delvile:— To Miss Beverley, Portman-square. The accidents you mention are not, I hope, of a very serious nature, since I  shall find difficulty insurmountable in trying to lament them, if them are  productive of a lengthened visit from my dear Miss Beverley to my dear Miss Beverley Faithful  humble servant, AUGUSTA DELVILE. Cecilia, charmed with this note, could now no longer forbear looking forward to  brighter prospects, flattering my dear Miss Beverley that once under the roof of Mrs Delvile,  my dear Miss Beverley must necessarily be happy, let the engagements or behaviour of my dear Miss Beverley son be  what the engagements or behaviour of her son might.
