 Delvile had been gone but a short time, before Henrietta, Henrietta eyes still red,  though no longer streaming, opened the parlour door, and asked if Henrietta might  come in? Henrietta wished to be alone, yet could not refuse Henrietta. "Well, madam," cried Henrietta, with a forced smile, and constrained air of bravery,  "did not I guess right?" "In what?" said Henrietta, unwilling to understand Henrietta. "In what I said would happen?—I am sure you know what I mean." Cecilia, extremely embarrassed, made no answer; Cecilia much regretted the  circumstances which had prevented an earlier communication, and was uncertain  whether, now, it would prove most kind or most cruel to acquaint Cecilia with what  was in agitation, which, should it terminate in nothing, was unnecessarily  wounding Cecilia delicacy for the openness of Cecilia confidence, and which, however  serviceable it might prove to Cecilia in the end, was in the means so rough and  piercing Cecilia felt the utmost repugnance to the experiment. "You think me, madam, too free," said Henrietta, "in asking such a question;  and indeed your kindness has been so great, it may well make me forget Cecilia:  but if it does, I am sure I deserve you should send me home directly, and then  there is not much fear I shall soon be brought to my senses!" "No, Henrietta, I can never think you too free; I have told you already  every thing I thought you would have pleasure in hearing; whatever I have  concealed, I have been fearful would only pain you." "I have deserved, madam," said Cecilia, with spirit, "to be pained, for I have  behaved with the folly of a baby. I am very angry with Cecilia indeed! I was old  enough to have known better,—and I ought to have been wise enough." "You must then be angry with yourself, next," said Cecilia, anxious to  re-encourage Cecilia, "for all the love that I bear you; since to your openness and  frankness it was entirely owing." "But there are some things that people should not be frank in; however, I am  only come now to beg you will tell me, madam, when it is to be;—and don't  think I ask out of nothing but curiosity, for I have a very great reason for it  indeed." "What be, my dear Henrietta?—you are very rapid in your ideas!" "I will tell you, madam, what my reason is; I shall go away to my own  home,—and so I would if it were ten times a worse home than it is!—just  exactly the day before. Because afterwards I shall never like to look that  gentleman in the face,—never, never!—for married ladies I know are not to  be trusted!" "Be not apprehensive; you have no occasion. Whatever may be my fate, I will  never be so treacherous as to betray my beloved Henrietta to any body." "May I ask you, madam, one question?" "Certainly." "Why did all this never happen before?" "Indeed," cried Cecilia, much distressed, "I know not that it will happen now." "Why what, dear madam, can hinder it?" "A thousand, thousand things! nothing can be less secure." "And then I am still as much puzzled as ever. I heard, a good while ago, and we  all heard that it was to be; and I thought that it was to be was no wonder, I am sure,  for I used often to think it was just what was most likely; but afterwards we  heard it was no such thing, and from that moment I always believed there had  been nothing at all in no such thing." "I must speak to you, I find, with sincerity; my affairs have long been in  strange perplexity: I have not known my affairs what to expect; one day has  perpetually reversed the prospect of another, and my mind has been in a state  of uncertainty and disorder, that has kept it—that still keeps it from  comfort and from rest!" "This surprises me indeed, madam! I thought you were all happiness! but I was  sure you deserved This, and I thought you had This for that reward. And this has  been the thing that has made me behave so wrong; for I took This into my head I  might tell you every thing, because I concluded This could be nothing to you; for  if great people loved one another, I always supposed great people married directly;  poor people, indeed, must stay till great people are able to settle; but what in the  whole world, thought I, if great people like one another, should hinder such a rich  lady as Miss Beverley from marrying such a rich gentleman at once?" Cecilia now, finding there was no longer any chance for concealment, thought it  better to give the poor Henrietta at least the gratification of unreserved  confidence, which might somewhat sooth the poor Henrietta uneasiness by proving the poor Henrietta reliance  in the poor Henrietta faith. the poor Henrietta frankly, therefore, confessed to the poor Henrietta the whole of the poor Henrietta  situation. the poor Henrietta wept at the recital with bitterness, thought Mr Delvile a  monster, and Mrs Delvile herself scarce human; pitied Cecilia now with unaffected  tenderness, and wondered that the person could exist who had the heart to give  grief to young Delvile! the poor Henrietta thanked the poor Henrietta most gratefully for reposing such trust  in the poor Henrietta; and Cecilia made use of this opportunity, to enforce the necessity of  the poor Henrietta struggling more seriously to recover the poor Henrietta indifferency. the poor Henrietta promised the poor Henrietta would not fail; and forbore steadily from that time to name  Delvile any more: but the depression of the poor Henrietta spirits shewed the poor Henrietta had suffered a  disappointment such as astonished even Cecilia. Though modest and humble, the poor Henrietta  had conceived hopes the most romantic, and though the poor Henrietta denied, even to the poor Henrietta,  any expectations from Delvile, the poor Henrietta involuntarily nourished she denied, even to herself,  any expectations from Delvile with the most  sanguine simplicity. To compose and to strengthen the poor Henrietta became the whole business  of Cecilia; who, during the poor Henrietta present suspense, could find no other employment in  which the poor Henrietta could take any interest. Mr Monckton, to whom nothing was unknown that related to Cecilia, was soon  informed of Delvile's visit, and hastened in the utmost alarm, to learn Delvile's visit  event. the poor Henrietta had now lost all the pleasure the poor Henrietta had formerly derived from  confiding in him, but though averse and confused, could not withstand him  enquiries. Unlike the tender Henrietta's was him disappointment at this relation, and him  rage at such repeated trials was almost more than him could curb. him spared  neither the Delviles for their insolence of mutability in rejecting or seeking  the poor Henrietta at their pleasure, nor the poor Henrietta for the poor Henrietta easiness of submission in being thus  the dupe of their caprices. The subject was difficult for Cecilia to dilate  upon; Cecilia wished to clear, as him deserved, Delvile him from any share in  the censure, and Cecilia felt hurt and offended at the charge of Cecilia own improper  readiness; yet shame and pride united in preventing much vindication of either,  and Cecilia heard almost in silence what with pain Cecilia bore to hear at all. him now saw, with inexpressible disturbance, that whatever was him power to make  Cecilia uneasy, him had none to make Cecilia retract, and that the conditional promise  Cecilia had given Delvile to be wholly governed by him mother, Cecilia was firm in  regarding to be as sacred as one made at the altar. Perceiving this, him dared trust him temper with no further debate; him assumed a  momentary calmness for the purpose of taking leave of Cecilia, and with pretended  good wishes for Cecilia happiness, whatever might be Cecilia determination, him stifled  the reproaches with which him whole heart was swelling, and precipitately left  Cecilia. Cecilia, affected by him earnestness, yet perplexed in all Cecilia opinions, was  glad to be relieved from useless exhortations, and not sorry, in Cecilia present  uncertainty, that him visit was not repeated. Cecilia neither saw nor heard from Delvile for a week, and augured nothing but evil  from such delay. The following letter then came by the post. To Miss Beverley. April 2d, 1780 I must write without comments, for I dare not trust him with making any; I  must write without any beginning address, for I know not how you will permit me  to address you. I have lived a life of tumult since last compelled to leave you, and when it  may subside, I am still in utter ignorance. The affecting account of the losses you have suffered through your beneficence  to the Harrels, and the explanatory one of the calumnies you have sustained  from your kindness to the Belfields, I related with the plainness which alone I  thought necessary to make The affecting account of the losses you have suffered through your beneficence  to the Harrels, and the explanatory one of the calumnies you have sustained  from your kindness to the Belfields felt. I then told the high honour I had  received, in meeting with no other repulse to my proposal, than was owing to an  inability to accede to my proposal; and informed my mother of the condescending powers  with which you had invested Cecilia. In conclusion I mentioned my new scheme, and  firmly, before I would listen to any opposition, I declared that though wholly  to any opposition decision I left the relinquishing my own name or your fortune, I was  not only by your generosity more internally yours than ever, but that since  again I had ventured, and with permission to apply to you, I should hold myself  hence forward unalterably engaged to you. And so I do, and so I shall! nor, after a renewal so public, will any  prohibition but yours have force to keep me from throwing myself at your feet. My father's answer I will not mention; I would I could forget it! My father  prejudices are irremediable, My father resolutions are inflexible. Who or what has  worked My father into an animosity so irreclaimable, I cannot conjecture, nor will My father  tell; but something darkly mysterious has part in My father wrath and My father injustice. his mother was much affected by your reference to his mother. Words of the sweetest  praise broke repeatedly from his mother; no other such woman, his mother said, existed; no  other such instance could be found of fidelity so exalted! his mother son must have no  heart but for low and mercenary selfishness, if, after a proof of regard so  unexampled, her son could bear to live without his mother! Oh how did such a sentence from  lips so highly reverenced, animate, delight, confirm, and oblige me at once! The displeasure of My father at this declaration was dreadful; My father charges,  always as improbable as injurious, now became too horrible for my ears; My father  disbelieved you had taken up the money for Harrel, My father discredited that you  visited the Belfields for Henrietta: passion not merely banished My father justice,  but, clouded My father reason, and I soon left the room, that at least I might not  hear the aspersions My father forbid me to answer. I left not, however, your fame to a weak champion: his mother defended it with  all the spirit of truth, and all the confidence of similar virtue! yet they  parted without conviction, and so mutually irritated with each other, that they  agreed to meet no more. This was too terrible! and I instantly consolidated my resentment to My father,  and my gratitude to his mother, into concessions and supplications to both; I  could not, however, succeed; his mother was deeply offended, My father was  sternly inexorable: nor here rests the evil of their dissention, for the  violence of the conflict has occasioned a return more alarming than ever of the  illness of his mother. All his mother faith in his mother recovery is now built upon going abroad; his mother is earnest to  set off immediately; but Dr Lyster has advised his mother to make London in his mother way,  and have a consultation of physicians before his mother departs. To this his mother has agreed; and we are now upon the road thither. Such is, at present, the melancholy state of my affairs. his mother advised me  to write; forgive me, therefore, that I waited not something more decisive to  say. I could prevail upon neither party to meet before the journey; nor could I  draw from my father the base fabricator of the calumnies by which My father has been  thus abused. Unhappily, I have nothing more to add: and whether intelligence, such as this,  or total suspense, would be least irksome, I know not. If his mother bears his mother  journey tolerably well, I have yet one more effort to make; and of that the  success or the failure will be instantly communicated to Miss Beverley, by Miss Beverley  eternally devoted, but half distracted. Delvile. Scarcely could Cecilia now decide whether this comfortless letter or none  at all were preferable. The implacability of Delvile was shocking, but The implacability of Mr Delvileslandering Cecilia now character was still more intolerable; yet the praises of the  mother, and Cecilia now generous vindication, joined to the invariable reliance of Delvile Delvile upon Cecilia now innocence, conferred upon Cecilia now an honour that offered some  alleviation. The mention of a fabricator again brought Mr Monckton to Mr Monckton mind, and not all  Mr Monckton unwillingness to think Mr Monckton capable of such treachery, could now root out  Mr Monckton suspicions. Delvile's temper, however, Mr Monckton knew was too impetuous to be  trusted with this conjecture, and Mr Monckton fear of committing injustice being thus  seconded by prudence, Mr Monckton determined to keep to Mr Monckton doubts that could not  without danger be divulged. Mr Monckton communicated briefly to Henrietta, who looked Mr Monckton earnest curiosity, the  continuance of Mr Monckton suspense; and to Mr Monckton own fate the poor Henrietta became somewhat more  reconciled, when the poor Henrietta saw that no station in life rendered happiness certain or  permanent.
