 Cecilia continued in this private spot, happy at least to be alone, till she  was summoned by the dinner bell to return home. As soon as she entered the parlour, where every body was assembled before her,  she observed, by the countenance of Mrs Delvile, that she had passed the  morning as sadly as herself. "Miss Beverley," cried Lady Honoria, before she was seated, "I insist upon your  taking my place to-day." "Why so, madam?" "Because I cannot suffer you to sit by a window with such a terrible cold." "Your ladyship is very good, but indeed I have not any cold at all." "O my dear, I must beg your pardon there; your eyes are quite bloodshot; Mrs  Delvile, Lord Ernolf, are not her eyes quite red?—Lord, and so I protest are  her cheeks! now do pray look in the glass, I assure you you will hardly know  yourself." Mrs Delvile, who regarded her with the utmost kindness, affected to understand  Lady Honoria's speech literally, both to lessen her apparent confusion, and the  suspicious surmises of Lord Ernolf; she therefore said, "you have indeed a bad  cold, my love; but shade your eyes with your hat, and after dinner you shall  bathe them in rose water, which will soon take off the inflammation." Cecilia, perceiving her intention, for which she felt the utmost gratitude, no  longer denied her cold, nor refused the offer of Lady Honoria: who, delighting  in mischief, whencesoever it proceeded, presently added, "This cold is a  judgment upon you for leaving me alone all this morning; but I suppose you  chose a tête-à-tête with your favourite, without the intrusion of any third  person." Here every body stared, and Cecilia very seriously declared she had been quite  alone. "Is it possible you can so forget yourself?" cried Lady Honoria; "had you not  your dearly beloved with you?" Cecilia, who now comprehended that she meant Fidel, coloured more deeply than  ever, but attempted to laugh, and began eating her dinner. "Here seems some matter of much intricacy," cried Lord Ernolf, "but, to me,  wholly unintelligible." "And to me also," cried Mrs Delvile, "but I am content to let it remain so; for  the mysteries of Lady Honoria are so frequent, that they deaden curiosity." "Dear madam, that is very unnatural," cried Lady Honoria, "for I am sure you  must long to know who I mean." "I do, at least," said Lord Ernolf. "Why then, my lord, you must know, Miss Beverley has two companions, and I am  one, and Fidel is the other; but Fidel was with her all this morning, and she  would not admit me to the conference. I suppose she had something private to  say to him of his master's journey." "What rattle is this?" cried Mrs Delvile; "Fidel is gone with my son, is he  not?" turning to the servants. "No, madam, Mr Mortimer did not enquire for him." "That's very strange," said she, "I never knew him quit home without him  before." "Dear ma'am, if he had taken him," cried Lady Honoria, "what could poor Miss  Beverley have done? for she has no friend here but him and me, and really he's  so much the greater favourite, that it is well if I do not poison him some day  for very spite." Cecilia had no resource but in forcing a laugh, and Mrs Delvile, who evidently  felt for her, contrived soon to change the subject: yet not before Lord Ernolf,  with infinite chagrin, was certain by all that passed of the hopeless state of  affairs for his son. The rest of the day, and every hour of the two days following, Cecilia passed  in the most comfortless constraint, fearful of being a moment alone, lest the  heaviness of her heart should seek relief in tears, which consolation,  melancholy as it was, she found too dangerous for indulgence: yet the gaiety of  Lady Honoria lost all power of entertainment, and even the kindness of Mrs  Delvile, now she imputed it to compassion, gave her more mortification than  pleasure. On the third day, letters arrived from Bristol: but they brought with them  nothing of comfort, for though Mortimer wrote gaily, his father sent word that  his fever seemed threatening to return. Mrs Delvile was now in the extremest anxiety; and the task of Cecilia in  appearing chearful and unconcerned, became more and more difficult to perform.  Lord Ernolf's efforts to oblige her grew as hopeless to himself, as they were  irksome to her; and Lady Honoria alone, of the whole house, could either find  or make the smallest diversion. But while Lord Derford remained, she had still  an object for ridicule, and while Cecilia could colour and be confused, she had  still a subject for mischief. Thus passed a week, during which the news from Bristol being every day less and  less pleasant, Mrs Delvile skewed an earnest desire to make a journey thither  herself, and proposed, half laughing and half seriously, that the whole party  should accompany her. Lady Honoria's time, however, was already expired, and her father intended to  send for her in a few days. Mrs Delvile, who knew that such a charge would occupy all her time, willingly  deferred setting out till her ladyship should be gone, but wrote word to  Bristol that she should shortly be there, attended by the two lords, who  insisted upon escorting her. Cecilia now was in a state of the utmost distress; her stay at the castle she  knew kept Delvile at a distance; to accompany his mother to Bristol, was  forcing herself into his sight, which equally from prudence and pride she  wished to avoid; and even Mrs Delvile evidently desired her absence, since  whenever the journey was talked of, she preferably addressed herself to any one  else who was present. All she could devise to relieve herself from a situation so painful, was  begging permission to make a visit without delay to her old friend Mrs Charlton  in Suffolk. This resolution taken, she put it into immediate execution, and seeking Mrs  Delvile, enquired if she might venture to make a petition to her? "Undoubtedly," answered she; "but let it not be very disagreeable, since I feel  already that I can refuse you nothing." "I have an old friend, ma'am," she then cried, speaking fast, and in much haste  to have done, "who I have not for many months seen, and, as my health does not  require a Bristol journey,—if you would honour me with mentioning my request  to Mr Delvile, I think I might take the present opportunity of making Mrs  Charlton a visit." Mrs Delvile looked at her some time without speaking, and then, fervently  embracing her, "sweet Cecilia!" she cried, "yes, you are all that I thought  you! good, wise, discreet, tender, and noble at once!—how to part with you,  indeed, I know not,—but you shall do as you please, for that I am sure will  be right, and therefore I will make no opposition." Cecilia blushed and thanked her, yet saw but too plainly that all the motives  of her scheme were clearly comprehended. She hastened, therefore, to write to  Mrs Charlton, and prepare for her reception. Mr Delvile, though with his usual formality, sent his permission: and Mortimer  at the same time, begged his mother would bring with her Fidel, whom he had  unluckily forgotten. Lady Honoria, who was present when Mrs Delvile mentioned this commission, said  in a whisper to Cecilia, "Miss Beverley, don't let him go." "Why not?" "O, you had a great deal better take him slyly into Suffolk." "I would as soon," answered Cecilia, "take with me the side-board of plate, for  I should scarcely think it more a robbery." "Oh, I beg your pardon, I am sure they might all take such a theft for an  honour; and if I was going to Bristol, I would bid Mortimer send him to you  immediately. However, if you wish it, I will write to him. He's my cousin, you  know, so there will be no great impropriety in it." Cecilia thanked her for so courteous an offer, but entreated that she might by  no means draw her into such a condescension. She then made immediate preparations for her journey into Suffolk, which she  saw gave equal surprize and chagrin to Lord Ernolf, upon whose affairs Mrs  Delvile herself now desired to speak with her. "Tell me, Miss Beverley," she cried, "briefly and positively your opinion of  Lord Derford?" "I think of him so little, madam," she answered, "that I cannot say of him  much; he appears, however, to be inoffensive; but, indeed, were I never to see  him again, he is one of those I should forget I had ever seen at all." "That is so exactly the case with myself also," cried Mrs Delvile, "that to  plead for him, I find utterly impossible, though my Lord Ernolf has strongly  requested me: but to press such an alliance, I should think an indignity to  your understanding." Cecilia was much gratified by this speech; but she soon after added, "There is  one reason, indeed, which would render such a connection desirable, though that  is only one." "What is it, madam?" "His title." "And why so? I am sure I have no ambition of that sort." "No, my love," said Mrs Delvile, smiling, "I mean not by way of gratification  to your pride, but to his; since a title, by taking place of a family name,  would obviate the only objection that any man could form to an alliance with  Miss Beverley." Cecilia, who too well understood her, suppressed a sigh, and changed the  subject of conversation. One day was sufficient for all the preparations she required, and, as she meant  to set out very early the next morning, she took leave of Lady Honoria, and the  Lords Ernolf and Derford, when they separated for the night; but Mrs Delvile  followed her to her room. She expressed her concern at losing her in the warmest and most flattering  terms, yet said nothing of her coming back, nor of the length of her stay; she  desired, however, to hear from her frequently, and assured her that out of her  own immediate family, there was nobody in the world she so tenderly valued. She continued with her till it grew so late that they were almost necessarily  parted: and then rising to be gone, "See," she cried, "with what reluctance I  quit you! no interest but so dear a one as that which calls me away, should  induce me, with my own consent, to bear your absence scarcely an hour: but the  world is full of mortifications, and to endure, or to sink under them, makes  all the distinction between the noble or the weak-minded. To you this may be  said with safety; to most young women it would pass for a reflection." "You are very good," said Cecilia, smothering the emotions to which this speech  gave rise, "and if indeed you honour me with an opinion so flattering, I will  endeavour, if it is possibly in my power, not to forfeit it." "Ah, my love!" cried Mrs Delvile warmly, "if upon my opinion of you alone  depended our residence with each other, when should we ever part, and how live  a moment asunder? But what title have I to monopolize two such blessings? the  mother of Mortimer Delvile should at nothing repine; the mother of Cecilia  Beverley had alone equal reason to be proud." "You are determined, madam," said Cecilia, forcing a smile, "that I shall be  worthy, by giving me the sweetest of motives, that of deserving such praise."  And then, in a faint voice, she desired her respects to Mr Delvile, and added,  "you will find, I hope, every body at Bristol better than you expect." "I hope so," returned she; "and that you too, will find your Mrs Charlton well,  happy, and good as you left her: but suffer her not to drive me from your  remembrance, and never fancy that because she has known you longer, she loves  you more; my acquaintance with you, though short, has been critical, and she  must hear from you a world of anecdotes, before she can have reason to love you  as much." "Ah, madam," cried Cecilia, tears starting into her eyes, "let us part  now!—where will be that strength of mind you expect from me, if I listen to  you any longer!" "You are right, my love," answered Mrs Delvile, "since all tenderness enfeebles  fortitude." Then affectionately embracing her, "Adieu," she cried, "sweetest  Cecilia, amiable and most excellent creature, adieu!—you, carry with you my  highest approbation, my love, my esteem, my fondest wishes!—and shall  I—yes, generous girl! I will add my warmest gratitude!" This last word she spoke almost in a whisper, again kissed her, and hastened  out of the room. Cecilia, surprised and affected, gratified and depressed, remained almost  motionless, and could not, for a great length of time, either ring for her  maid, or persuade herself to go to rest. She saw throughout the whole behaviour  of Mrs Delvile, a warmth of regard which, though strongly opposed by family  pride, made her almost miserable to promote the very union she thought  necessary to discountenance; she saw, too, that it was with the utmost  difficulty she preserved the steadiness of her opposition, and that she had a  conflict perpetual with herself, to forbear openly acknowledging the  contrariety of her wishes, and the perplexity of her distress; but chiefly she  was struck with her expressive use of the word gratitude. "Wherefore should she  be grateful," thought Cecilia, "what have I done, or had power to do?  infinitely, indeed, is she deceived, if she supposes that her son has acted by  my directions; my influence with him is nothing, and he could not be more his  own master, were he utterly indifferent to me. To conceal my own disappointment  has, been all I have attempted; and perhaps she may think of me thus highly,  from supposing that the firmness of her son is owing to my caution and reserve:  ah, she knows him not!—were my heart at this moment laid open to him,—were  all its weakness, its partiality, its ill-fated admiration displayed, he would  but double his vigilance to avoid and forget me, and find the task all the  easier by his abatement of esteem. Oh strange infatuation of unconquerable  prejudice! his very life will he sacrifice in preference to his name, and while  the conflict of his mind threatens to level him with the dust, he disdains to  unite himself where one wish is unsatisfied!" These reflections, and the uncertainty if she should ever in Delvile Castle  sleep again, disturbed her the whole night, and made all calling in the morning  unnecessary: she arose at five o'clock, dressed herself with the utmost  heaviness of heart, and in going through a long gallery which led to the  staircase, as she passed the door of Mortimer's chamber, the thought of his ill  health, his intended long journey, and the probability that she might never see  him more, so deeply impressed and saddened her, that scarcely could she force  herself to proceed, without stopping to weep and to pray for him; she was  surrounded, however, by servants, and compelled therefore to hasten to the  chaise; she flung herself in, and, leaning back, drew her hat over her eyes,  and thought, as the carriage drove off, her last hope of earthly happiness  extinguished.
