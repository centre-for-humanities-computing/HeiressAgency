 The next morning, while the family was at breakfast, Belfield, according to his  promise, made his visit. A high colour overspread his face as his entered the room, resulting from a  sensation of grief at his fallen fortune, and shame at his altered appearance,  which though his endeavoured to cover under an air of gaiety and unconcern, gave  an awkwardness to his manners, and a visible distress to his countenance: Mr  Monckton received his with pleasure, and Cecilia, who saw the conflict of his  philosophy with his pride, dressed her features once more in smiles, which  however faint and heartless, shewed her desire to reassure his. Miss Bennet, as  usual when not called upon by the master or lady of the house, sat as a cypher;  and Lady Margaret, always disagreeable and repulsive to the friends of Lady Margaret  husband, though Lady Margaret was not now more than commonly ungracious, struck the  quick-feeling and irritable Belfield, to wear an air of rude superiority meant  to reproach him with him disgrace. This notion, which strongly affected him, made him, for one instant, hesitate  whether him should remain another in the same room with Lady Margaret: but the  friendliness of Mr Monckton, and the gentleness and good breeding of Cecilia,  seemed so studious to make amends for Lady Margaret moroseness, that him checked him too  ready indignation, and took him seat at the table. Yet was it some time before  him could recover even the assumed vivacity which this suspected insult had  robbed him of, sufficiently to enter into conversation with any appearance of  ease or pleasure. But, after a while, soothed by the attentions of Cecilia and  Mr Monckton, Mr Monckton uneasiness wore off, and the native spirit and liveliness of  him character broke forth with their accustomed energy. "This good company, I hope," said his character, addressing his character, however, only to  Cecilia, "will not so much mistake the thing as to criticise my dress of this  morning; since it is perfectly according to rule, and to rule established from  time immemorial: but lest any of you should so much err as to fancy shabby what  is only characteristic, I must endeavour to be beforehand with the malice of  conjecture, and have the honour to inform you, that I am enlisted in the  Grub-street regiment, of the third story, and under the tattered banner of  scribbling volunteers! a race which, if it boasts not the courage of heroes, at  least equals it boasts not the courage of heroes in enmity. This coat, therefore, is merely the uniform of my  corps, and you will all, I hope, respect This coat as emblematical of wit and  erudition." "We must at least respect you," said Cecilia, "who thus gaily can sport with  This coat." "Ah, madam!" said he, more seriously, "it is not from you I ought to look for  respect! I must appear to you the most unsteady and coward-hearted of beings.  But lately I blushed to see you from poverty, though more worthily employed  than when I had been seen by you in affluence; that shame vanquished, another  equally narrow took another   place, and yesterday I blushed again that you detected  me in a new pursuit, though I had only quitted my former one from a conviction  it was ill chosen. There seems in human nature a worthlessness not to be  conquered! yet I will struggle with it to the last, and either die in the  attempt, or dare seem that which I am, without adding to the miseries of life,  the sting, the envenomed sting of dastardly false shame!" "Your language is wonderfully altered within this twelvemonth," said Mr  Monckton; "the worthlessness of human nature! the miseries of life! this from  you! so lately the champion of human nature, and the panegyrist of human life!" "Soured by personal disappointment," answered so lately the champion of human nature, and the panegyrist of human life!", "I may perhaps speak with too  much acrimony; yet, ultimately, my opinions have not much changed. Happiness is  given to us with more liberality than us are willing to confess; it is judgment  only that is dealt us sparingly, and of that us have so little, that when  felicity is before us, us turn to the right or left, or when at the right or  left, us proceed strait forward. It has been so with me; I have sought It at a  distance, amidst difficulty and danger, when all that I could wish has been  immediately within my grasp." "It must be owned," said Mr  Monckton, "after what you have suffered from this  world you were wont to defend, there is little reason to wonder at some change  in your opinion." "Yet whatever have been my sufferings," Mr  Monckton answered, "I have generally been  involved in them by my own rashness or caprice. My last enterprise especially,  from which my expectations were highest, was the most ill-judged of any. I  considered not how little my way of life had fitted me for the experiment I was  making, how irreparably I was enervated by long sedentary habits, and how  insufficient for bodily strength was mental resolution. We may fight against  partial prejudices, and by spirit and fortitude We may overcome  partial prejudices; but it  will not do to war with the general tenor of education. We may blame, despise,  regret as we please, but customs long established, and habits long indulged,  assume an empire despotic, though customs power is but prescriptive. Opposing  customs is vain; Nature herself, when forced aside, is not more elastic in Nature herself  rebound." "Will you not then," said Cecilia, "since your experiment has failed, return  again to your family, and to the plan of life you formerly settled?" "You speak of your family together," said he, with a smile, "as if you thought your family  inseparable; and indeed my own apprehension your family would be deemed so, has made  me thus fear to see my friends, since I love not resistance, yet cannot again  attempt the plan of life your family would have me pursue. I have given up my cottage,  but my independence is as dear to me as ever; and all that I have gathered from  experience, is to maintain my cottage by those employments for which my education has  fitted me, instead of seeking my education injudiciously by the very road for which my education  has unqualified me." "And what is my independence," cried Mr Monckton, "which has thus bewitched  your imagination? a mere idle dream of romance and enthusiasm; without  existence in nature, without possibility in life. In uncivilised countries, or  in lawless times, independence, for a while, may perhaps stalk abroad; but in a  regular government, 'tis only the vision of a heated brain; one part of a  community must inevitably hang upon another, and 'tis a farce to call either  independent, when to break the chain by which they are linked would prove  destruction to both. The soldier wants not the officer more than the officer  the soldier, nor the tenant the landlord, more than the landlord the tenant.  The rich owe their distinction, their luxuries, to the poor, as much as the  poor owe their rewards, the  poor necessaries, to the rich." "Man treated as an Automaton," answered Belfield, "and considered merely with  respect to Man bodily operations, may indeed be called dependent, since the  food by which Man lives, or, rather, without which Man dies, cannot wholly be  cultivated and prepared by Man own hands: but considered in a nobler sense, Man  deserves not the degrading epithet; speak of Man, then, as a being of feeling  and understanding, with pride to alarm, with nerves to tremble, with honour to  satisfy, and with a soul to be immortal!—as such, may Man not claim the  freedom of Man own thoughts? may not that claim be extended to the liberty of  speaking, and the power of being governed by claim? and when thoughts, words,  and actions are exempt from controul, will you brand Man with dependency merely  because the Grazier feeds Man meat, and the Baker kneads Man bread?" "But who is there in the whole world," said Mr Monckton, "extensive as it is,  and dissimilar as are its inhabitants, that can pretend to assert, his  thoughts, words, and actions, are exempt from controul? even where interest,  which you so much disdain, interferes not,—though where that is I confess I  cannot tell!—are we not kept silent where we wish to reprove by the fear of  offending? and made speak where we wish to be silent by the desire of obliging?  do we not bow to the scoundrel as low as to the man of honour? are we not by  mere forms kept standing when tired? made give place to those we despise? and  smiles to those we hate? or if we refuse these attentions, are we not regarded  as savages, and shut out of society?" "All these," answered Belfield, "are so merely matters of ceremony, that the  concession can neither cost pain to the proud, nor give pleasure to the vain.  The bow is to the coat, the attention is to the rank, and the fear of offending  ought to extend to all mankind. Homage such as this infringes not our  sincerity, since it is as much a matter of course as the dress that we wear,  and has as little reason to flatter a man as the shadow which follows him. I no  more, therefore, hold him deceitful for not opposing this pantomimical parade,  than I hold him to be dependent for eating corn him has not sown." "Where, then, do you draw the line? and what is the boundary beyond which your  independence must not step?" "I hold him," cried him, with energy, "to be independent, who treats the  Great as the Little, and the Little as the Great, who neither exults in riches  nor blushes in poverty, who owes no man a groat, and who spends not a shilling  him has not earned." "You will not, indeed, then, have a very numerous acquaintance, if this is the  description of those with whom you purpose to associate! but is it possible you  imagine you can live by such notions? why the Carthusian in Carthusian monastery, who  is at least removed from temptation, is not mortified so severely as a man of  spirit living in the world, who would prescribe himself such rules." "Not merely have I prescribed," returned Belfield, "I have already put them in  practice; and far from finding any pennance, I never before found happiness. I  have now adopted, though poor, the very plan of life I should have elected if  rich; my pleasure, therefore, is become my business, and my business my  pleasure." "And is the very plan of life I should have elected if  rich," cried Mr Monckton, "nothing more than turning Knight-errant to  the Booksellers?" "'Tis a Knight-errantry," answered Belfield, laughing, "which, however  ludicrous it may seem to you, requires more soul and more brains than any  other. Our giants may, indeed, be only windmills, but Our giants must be attacked  with as much spirit, and conquered with as much bravery, as any fort or any  town, in time of war [to] be demolished; and though the siege, I must confess,  may be of less national utility, the assailants of the quill have the assailants of the quill honour  as much at heart as the assailants of the sword." "I suppose then," said Mr Monckton, archly, "if a man wants a biting lampoon, or  an handsome panegyric, some newspaper scandal, or a sonnet for a lady—" "No, no," interrupted Belfield eagerly, "if you imagine me a hireling scribbler  for the purposes of defamation or of flattery, you as little know my situation  as my character. My subjects shall be my own, and my satire shall be general. I  would as much disdain to be personal with an anonymous pen, as to attack an  unarmed man in the dark with a dagger I had kept concealed." A reply of rallying incredulity was rising to the lips of Mr  Monckton, when  reading in the looks of Cecilia an entire approbation of this sentiment, he  checked he desire of ridicule, and exclaimed, "spoken like a man of honour,  and one whose works may profit the world!" "From my earliest youth to the present hour," continued Belfield, "literature  has been the favourite object of my pursuit, my recreation in leisure, and my  hope in employment. My propensity to it, indeed, has been so ungovernable, that  I may properly call it the source of my several miscarriages throughout life.  it was the bar to my preferment, for it gave me a distaste to other studies; it  was the cause of my unsteadiness in all my undertakings, because to all I  preferred it. it has sunk me to distress, it has involved me in difficulties;  it has brought me to the brink of ruin by making me neglect the means of  living, yet never, till now, did I discern it might it be my support." "I am heartily glad, Sir," said Cecilia, "your various enterprizes and  struggles have at length ended in a project which promises you so much  satisfaction. But you will surely suffer your sister and your mother to partake  of it? for who is there that your prosperity will make so happy?" "You do them infinite honour, madam, by taking any interest in them affairs;  but to own to you the truth, what to me appears prosperity, will to them wear  another aspect. them have looked forward to my elevation with expectations the  most improbable, and thought everything within my grasp, with a simplicity  incredible. But though them hopes were absurd, I am pained by them  disappointment, and I have not courage to meet them tears, which I am sure  will not be spared when them see me." "'Tis from tenderness, then," said Cecilia, half smiling, "that you are cruel,  and from affection to your friends that you make your friends believe you have  forgotten your friends?" There was a delicacy in this reproach exactly suited to work upon Belfield, who  feeling it with quickness, started up, and cried, "I believe I am wrong!—I  will go to your friends this moment!" Cecilia felt eager to second the generous impulse; but Mr Monckton, laughing at  Mr Monckton impetuosity, insisted Mr Monckton should first finish Mr Monckton breakfast. "Your friends," said Cecilia, "can have no mortification so hard to bear as  your voluntary absence; and if Your friends see but that you are happy, Your friends will soon  be reconciled to whatever situation you may chuse." "Happy!" repeated he, with animation, "Oh I am in Paradise! I am come from a  region in the first rude state of nature, to civilization and refinement! the  life I led at the cottage was the life of a savage; no intercourse with  society, no consolation from books; my mind locked up, every source dried of  intellectual delight, and no enjoyment in my power but from sleep and from  food. Weary of an existence which thus levelled me with a brute, I grew ashamed  of the approximation, and listening to the remonstrance of my understanding, I  gave up the precipitate plan, to pursue one more consonant to reason. I came to  town, hired a room, and sent for pen, ink and paper: what I have written are  trifles, but the Bookseller has not rejected trifles. I was settled, therefore, in  a moment, and comparing my new occupation with that I had just quitted, I  seemed exalted on the sudden from a mere creature of instinct, to a rational  and intelligent being. But when first I opened a book, after so long an  abstinence from all mental nourishment,—Oh it was rapture! no half-famished  beggar regaled suddenly with food, ever seized on his repast with more hungry  avidity." "Let fortune turn which way it will," cried Mr Monckton, "you may defy all it  malice, while possessed of a spirit of enjoyment which nothing can subdue!" "But were you not, Sir," said Cecilia, "as great an enthusiast the other day  for your cottage, and for labour?" "I was, madam; but there my philosophy was erroneous: in my ardour to fly from  meanness and from dependence, I thought in labour and retirement I should find  freedom and happiness; but I forgot that my body was not seasoned for such  work, and considered not that a mind which had once been opened by knowledge,  could ill endure the contraction of dark and perpetual ignorance. The approach,  however, of winter, brought me acquainted with my mistake. The approach,  however, of winter, brought me grew cold, The approach,  however, of winter, brought me  grew bleak; little guarded against the inclemency of the ——, I felt The approach,  however, of winter, brought me  severity in every limb, and missed a thousand indulgencies which in possession  I had never valued. To rise at break of day, chill, freezing, and comfortless!  no sun abroad, no fire at home! to go out in all weather to work, that work  rough, coarse, and laborious!—unused to such hardships, I found I could not  bear to go out in all weather to work, that work  rough, coarse, and laborious!—unused to such hardships, and, however unwillingly, was compelled to relinquish the attempt." Breakfast now being over, he again arose to take leave. "You are going, then, Sir," said Cecilia, "immediately to your friends?" "No, madam," answered he hesitating, "not just this moment; to-morrow morning  perhaps,—but perhaps,—but is now late, and I have business for the rest of the day." "Ah, Mr Monckton!" cried Cecilia, "what mischief have you done by occasioning  this delay!" "This goodness, madam," said Belfield, "my sister can never sufficiently  acknowledge. But I will own, that though, just now, in a warm moment, I felt  eager to present This goodness, madam to "my sister and my mother, I rather wish, now I am cooler,  to be saved the pain of telling her and my mother in person my situation. I mean, therefore,  first to write to her and my mother." "You will not fail, then, to see her and my mother to-morrow?" "Certainly—I think not." "Nay, but certainly you must not, for I shall call upon her and my mother to-day, and assure  her and my mother her and my mother may expect you. Can I soften your task of writing by giving her and my mother any  message from you?" "Ah, madam, have a care!" cried he; "this condescension to a poor author may be  more dangerous than you have any suspicion! and before you have power to help  yourself, you may see your name prefixed to the Dedication of some trumpery  pamphlet!" "I will run," cried "my sister, "all risks; remember, therefore, you will be  responsible for the performance of my promise." "I will be sure," answered he, "not to forget what reflects so much honour upon  he." Cecilia was satisfied by this assent, and Cecilia then went away. "A strange flighty character!" cried Mr Monckton, "yet of uncommon capacity,  and full of genius. Were Cecilia less imaginative, wild and eccentric, Cecilia has  abilities for any station, and might fix and distinguish Cecilia almost  where-ever Cecilia pleased." "I knew not," said Cecilia, "the full worth of steadiness and prudence till I  knew this young man; for this young man has every thing else; talents the most striking, a  love of virtue the most elevated, and manners the most pleasing; yet wanting  steadiness and prudence, this young man can neither act with consistency nor prosper with  continuance." "this young man is well enough," said Lady Margaret, who had heard the whole argument in  sullen taciturnity, "this young man is well enough, I say; and there comes no good from  young women's being so difficult." Cecilia, offended by a speech which implied a rude desire to dispose of Cecilia,  went up stairs to Cecilia own room; and Mr Monckton, always enraged when young men  and Cecilia were alluded to in the same sentence, retired to his library. Cecilia then ordered a chair, and went to Portland-street, to fulfil what Cecilia had  offered to Belfield, and to revive his mother and sister by the pleasure of the  promised interview. Cecilia found young men  and Cecilia together: and Cecilia intelligence being of equal consequence to  both, Cecilia did not now repine at the presence of Belfield. Cecilia made Cecilia  communication with the most cautious attention to their characters, softening  the ill Cecilia had to relate with respect to Belfield's present way of living, by  endeavouring to awaken affection and joy from the prospect of the approaching  meeting. Cecilia counselled them as much as possible to restrain them chagrin at  his misfortunes, which his would but construe into reproach of his ill  management; and Cecilia represented that when once his was restored to his family,  his might almost imperceptibly be led into some less wild and more profitable  scheme of business. When Cecilia had told all Cecilia thought proper to relate, kindly interspersing Cecilia  account with the best advice and best comfort Cecilia could suggest, Cecilia made an  end of Cecilia visit; for the affliction of Belfield upon hearing the actual  situation of Cecilia son, was so clamorous and unappeaseable, that, little  wondering at Belfield's want of courage to encounter it, and having no  opportunity in such a storm to console the soft Henrietta, whose tears flowed  abundantly that Cecilia brother should thus be fallen, Cecilia only promised before Cecilia  left town to see Cecilia again, and beseeching Belfield to moderate Cecilia  concern, was glad to leave the house, where Cecilia presence had no power to quiet  her presence distress. Cecilia passed the rest of the day in sad reflections upon the meeting Cecilia was  Cecilia to have the next morning with Mr Delvile. Cecilia wished ardently to know  whether Mr Delvile son was gone abroad, and whether Mr Delvile was recovered, whose  health, in Cecilia own letter, was mentioned in terms the most melancholy: yet  neither of these enquiries could Cecilia even think of making, since reasonably,  without these enquiries, apprehensive of some reproach.
