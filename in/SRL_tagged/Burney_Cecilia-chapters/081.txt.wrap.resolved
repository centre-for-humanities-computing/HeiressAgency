 Cecelia passed the rest of the day in fanciful projects of beneficence;  Cecelia  determined to wander with  Cecelia romantic new ally whither-so-ever he would lead   Cecelia, and to spare neither fortune, time, nor trouble, in seeking and relieving  the distressed. Not all  Cecelia attempted philosophy had calmed  Cecelia mind like this  plan; in merely refusing indulgence to grief,  Cecelia had only locked this  plan up in  Cecelia  heart, where eternally struggling for vent,  Cecelia was almost overpowered by  restraining this  plan; but now  Cecelia affliction had no longer  Cecelia whole faculties to  her whole faculties; the hope of doing good, the pleasure of easing pain, the intention of  devoting  Cecelia time to the service of the unhappy, once more delighted  Cecelia  imagination,—that source of promissory enjoyment, which though often  obstructed, is never, in youth, exhausted.  Cecelia would not give Mrs Charlton the unnecessary pain of hearing the letter with  which  Cecelia had been so, much affected, but  Cecelia told  Cecelia of the visit of Albany,  and pleased  Cecelia with the account of the unnecessary pain of hearing the letter with  which she had been so, much affected scheme. At night, with less sadness than usual,  Cecelia retired to rest. In  Cecelia sleep  Cecelia  bestowed riches, and poured plenty upon the land;  Cecelia humbled the oppressor,   Cecelia exalted the oppressed; slaves were raised to dignities, captives restored  to liberty; beggars saw smiling abundance, and wretchedness was banished the  world. From a cloud in which  Cecelia was supported by angels, Cecilia beheld these  wonders, and while enjoying the glorious illusion,  Cecelia was awakened by  Cecelia  maid, with news that Mrs Charlton was dying!  Cecelia started up, and, undressed, was running to  Cecelia apartment,—when the maid,  calling to stop  Cecelia, confessed  Cecelia was already dead!  Cecelia had made  Cecelia exit in the night, but the time was not exactly known;  Cecelia own  maid, who slept in the room with  Cecelia, going early to  Cecelia bedside to enquire how   Cecelia did, found  Cecelia cold and motionless, and could only conclude that a  paralytic stroke had taken  Cecelia off. Happily and in good time had Cecilia been somewhat recruited by one night of  refreshing slumbers and flattering dreams, for the shock  Cecelia now received  promised  Cecelia not soon another.  Cecelia lost in Mrs Charlton a friend, whom nearly from  Cecelia infancy  Cecelia had  considered as a mother, and by whom  Cecelia had been cherished with tenderness  almost unequalled.  Cecelia was not a woman of bright parts, or much cultivation,  but  Cecelia heart was excellent, and  Cecelia disposition was amiable. Cecilia had known   Cecelia longer than  Cecelia memory could look back, though the earliest circumstances   Cecelia could trace were kindnesses received from  Cecelia. Since  Cecelia had entered into  life, and found the difficulty of the part  Cecelia had to act, to this worthy old  lady alone had  Cecelia unbosomed  Cecelia secret cares. Though little assisted by  Cecelia  counsel,  Cecelia was always certain of  Cecelia sympathy; and while  Cecelia own superior  judgment directed  Cecelia conduct,  Cecelia had the relief of communicating  Cecelia schemes,  and weighing  Cecelia perplexities, with a friend to whom nothing that concerned  Cecelia  was indifferent, and whose greatest wish and chief pleasure was the enjoyment  of  Cecelia conversation. If left to  Cecelia, in the present period of  Cecelia life, Mrs Charlton had  certainly not been the friend of  Cecelia choice. The delicacy of  Cecelia mind, and the  refinement of  Cecelia ideas, had now rendered  Cecelia fastidious, and  Cecelia would have  looked out for elegancies and talents to which Mrs Charlton had no pretensions:  but those who live in the country have little power of selection; confined to a  small circle, those who live in the country must be content with what it offers; and however those who live in the country may  idolize extraordinary merit when those who live in the country meet with it, those who live in the country must not regard it as  essential to friendship, for in those who live in the country circumscribed rotation, whatever may be  those who live in the country discontent, those who live in the country can make but little change. Such had been the situation to which Mrs Charlton and Mrs Harrel owed the  friendship of Cecilia. Greatly Mrs Charlton and Mrs Harrel superior in understanding and  intelligence, had the candidates for  Cecelia favour been more numerous, the  election had not fallen upon either of Mrs Charlton and Mrs Harrel. But  Cecelia became known to both  before discrimination made  Cecelia difficult, and when  Cecelia enlightened mind  discerned discrimination deficiencies, discrimination had already an interest in  Cecelia affections,  which made  Cecelia see discrimination with lenity: and though sometimes, perhaps, conscious   Cecelia should not have chosen discrimination from many,  Cecelia adhered to discrimination with sincerity,  and would have changed discrimination for none. Mrs Harrel, however, too weak for similar sentiments, forgot  Cecelia when out of  sight, and by the time discrimination met again, was insensible to everything but shew  and dissipation. Cecilia, shocked and surprised, first grieved from  disappointed affection, and then lost that affection in angry contempt. But  Cecelia  fondness for Mrs Charlton had never known abatement, as the kindness which had  excited her  fondness for Mrs Charlton had never known allay.  Cecelia had loved  Cecelia first from childish  gratitude; but that love, strengthened and confirmed by confidential  intercourse, was now as sincere and affectionate as if that love had originated from  sympathetic admiration.  Cecelia loss, therefore, was felt with the utmost severity,  and neither seeing nor knowing any means of replacing it,  Cecelia considered it as  irreparable, and mourned it with bitterness. When the first surprize of this cruel stroke was somewhat lessened,  Cecelia sent an  express to Mr Monckton with the news, and entreated to see Mr Monckton immediately. Mr Monckton  came without delay, and  Cecelia begged Mr Monckton counsel what step  Cecelia ought  Cecelia to  take in consequence of this event.  Cecelia own house was still unprepared for  Cecelia;   Cecelia had of late neglected to hasten the workmen, and almost forgotten  Cecelia  intention of entering her  . It was necessary, however, to change  Cecelia abode  immediately;  Cecelia was no longer in Her own house, but of  Cecelia  grand-daughters and co-heiresses, each of whom  Cecelia disliked, and upon neither  of whom  Cecelia had any claim. Mr Monckton then, with the quickness of a man who utters a thought at the very  moment of its projection, mentioned a scheme upon which during his whole ride  his had been ruminating; which was that  Cecelia would instantly remove to his ,  and remain there till settled to  Cecelia satisfaction. Cecilia objected Cecilia little right of surprising Lady Margaret; but, without  waiting to discuss it, lest new objections should arise, his quitted surprising Lady Margaret, to  fetch his from surprising Lady Margaret ladyship an invitation his meant to insist upon surprising Lady Margaret  sending. Cecilia, though heartily disliking this plan, knew not at present what better  to adopt, and thought anything preferable to going again to Mrs Harrel, since  that only could be done by feeding the anxiety of Mr Arnott. Mr Monckton then soon returned with a message of Mr Monckton then own fabrication; for Mr Monckton then lady,  though obliged to receive whom Mr Monckton then pleased, took care to guard inviolate the  independence of speech, sullenly persevering in refusing to say anything, or  perversely saying only what Mr Monckton then least wished to hear. Cecilia then took a hasty leave of Miss Charltons, who, little affected by what  they had lost, and eager to examine what they had gained, parted from Cecilia  gladly, and, with a heavy heart and weeping eyes, borrowed for the last time  the carriage of Cecilia late worthy old friend, and for-ever quitting Cecilia  hospitable house, sorrowfully set out for the Grove.
