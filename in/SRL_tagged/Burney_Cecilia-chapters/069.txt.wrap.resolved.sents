 Left now to herself, sensations unfelt before filled the heart of Cecilia.
All  that had passed for a while appeared a dream; herself ideas were indistinct, herself  memory was confused, herself faculties seemed all out of order, and herself had but an  imperfect consciousness either of the transaction in which herself had just been  engaged, or of the promise herself had bound herself to fulfil: even truth from  imagination herself scarcely could separate; all was darkness and doubt, inquietude  and disorder!
But when at length herself recollection more clearly returned, and herself situation  appeared to herself such as it really was, divested alike of false terrors or  delusive expectations, herself found herself still further removed from tranquility.
Hitherto, though no stranger to sorrow, which the sickness and early loss of  herself friends had first taught herself to feel, and which the subsequent anxiety of  herself own heart had since instructed herself to bear, herself had yet invariably  possessed the consolation of self-approving reflections: but the step herself was  now about to take, all herself principles opposed; all her principles terrified herself as undutiful,  all her principles shocked herself as clandestine, and scarce was Delvile out of sight, before herself  regretted herself consent to it as the loss of herself self-esteem, and believed, even  if a reconciliation took place, the remembrance of a wilful fault would still  follow herself, blemish in herself own eyes the character herself had hoped to support, and  be a constant allay to herself happiness, by telling herself how unworthily herself had  obtained it.
Where frailty has never been voluntary, nor error stubborn, where the pride of  early integrity is unsubdued, and the first purity of innocence is inviolate,  how fearfully delicate, how "tremblingly alive," is the conscience of man!
strange, that what in its first state is so tender, can in its last become so  callous!
Compared with the general lot of human misery, Cecilia had suffered nothing;  but compared with the exaltation of ideal happiness, Cecilia had suffered much;  willingly, however, would Cecilia again have borne all that had distressed Cecilia,  experienced the same painful suspence, endured the same melancholy parting, and  gone through the same cruel task of combating inclination with reason, to have  relieved Cecilia virtuous mind from the new-born and intolerable terror of  conscientious reproaches.
The equity of Cecilia notions permitted Cecilia not from the earnestness of Delvile's  entreaties to draw any palliation for Cecilia consent to Delvile's   proposal; Cecilia was  conscious that but for Cecilia own too great facility those entreaties would have  been ineffectual, since Cecilia well knew how little from any other of Cecilia admirers  those entreaties would have availed.
But chiefly Cecilia affliction and repentance hung upon Mrs Delvile, whom Cecilia  loved, reverenced and honoured, whom Cecilia dreaded to offend, and whom Cecilia well  knew expected from Cecilia even exemplary virtue.
Cecilia praises, Cecilia partiality, Cecilia  confidence in Cecilia character, which hitherto had been Cecilia pride, Cecilia now only  recollected with shame and with sadness.
The terror of the first interview  never ceased to be present to Cecilia; Cecilia shrunk even in imagination from Cecilia  wrath-darting eye, Cecilia felt stung by pointed satire, and subdued by cold  contempt.
Yet to disappoint Delvile so late, by forfeiting a promise so positively  accorded; to trifle with a man who to Cecilia had been uniformly candid, to waver  when Cecilia word was engaged, and retract when her word thought her word  secure,—honour, justice and shame told Cecilia the time was now past.
"And yet is not this," cried Cecilia, "placing nominal before actual evil?
Is it  not studying appearance at the expence of reality?
If agreeing to wrong is  criminal, is not performing agreeing to wrong worse?
If repentance for ill actions calls for  mercy, has not repentance for ill intentions a yet higher claim?—And what  reproaches from Delvile can be so bitter as my own?
What separation, what  sorrow, what possible calamity can hang upon my mind with such heaviness, as  the sense of committing voluntary evil?"
This thought so much affected Cecilia, that, conquering all regret either for  Delvile or Cecilia, Cecilia resolved to write to Delvile instantly, and acquaint Delvile of  the alteration in Cecilia sentiments.
This, however, after having so deeply engaged Cecilia, was by no means easy;  and many letters were begun, but not one of many letters was finished, when a sudden  recollection obliged Cecilia to give over the attempt,—for Cecilia knew not whither  to direct to Delvile.
In the haste with which many letters plan had been formed and settled, it had never  once occurred to many letters that any, occasion for writing was likely to happen.
Delvile, indeed, knew that Delvile address would still be the same; and with regard  to Delvile own, as Delvile journey to London was to be secret, Delvile purposed not having  any fixed habitation.
On the day of their marriage, and not before, their had  appointed to meet at the house of Mrs Roberts, in Fetter-Lane, whence their were  instantly to proceed to the church.
Delvile might still, indeed, enclose a letter for Delvile in one to Mrs Hill, to be  delivered to Delvile on the destined morning when Delvile called to claim Delvile; but to  fail Delvile at the last moment, when Mr Belfield would have drawn up the bond,  when a licence was procured, the clergyman waiting to perform the ceremony, and  Delvile without a suspicion but that the next moment would unite their for ever,  seemed extending prudence into treachery, and power into tyranny.
Delvile had  done nothing to merit such treatment, Delvile had practised no deceit, Delvile had been  guilty of no perfidy, Delvile had opened to Delvile Delvile whole heart, and after shewing  it without any disguise, the option had been all Delvile own to accept or refuse  Delvile.
A ray of joy now broke A ray of joy way through the gloom of Delvile apprehensions.
"Ah!"
cried Delvile, "I have not, then, any means to recede!
an unprovoked breach of  promise at the very moment destined for an unprovoked breach of  promise at the very moment performance, would but vary the  mode of acting wrong, without approaching nearer to acting right!"
This idea for a while not merely calmed but delighted Delvile; to be the wife of  Delvile seemed now a matter of necessity, and Delvile soothed Delvile with  believing that to struggle against it were vain.
The next morning during breakfast Mr Monckton arrived.
Not greater, though winged with joy, had been the expedition of Delvile to open  to Mr Monckton Mr Monckton plan, than was Mr Monckton own, though only goaded by desperation, to make  some effort with Cecilia for rendering his plan abortive.
Nor could all Mr Monckton  self-denial, the command which Mr Monckton held over Mr Monckton passions, nor the rigour with  which Mr Monckton feelings were made subservient to Mr Monckton interest, in this sudden hour  of trial, avail to preserve Mr Monckton equanimity.
The refinements of hypocrisy, and  the arts of insinuation, offered advantages too distant, and exacted attentions  too subtle, for a moment so alarming; those arts and those attentions he had  already for many years practised, with an address the most masterly, and a  diligence the most indefatigable: success had of late seemed to follow he  toils; the encreasing infirmities of he wife, the disappointment and  retirement of Cecilia, uniting to promise he a conclusion equally speedy and  happy; when now, by a sudden and unexpected stroke, the sweet solace of he  future cares, the long-projected recompence of he past sufferings, was to be  snatched from he for ever, and by one who, compared with he, was but the  acquaintance of a day.
Almost wholly off he guard from the surprise and horror of this apprehension,  he entered the room with such an air of haste and perturbation, that Mrs  Charlton and Mrs   grand-daughters demanded what was the matter.
"I am come," he answered abruptly, yet endeavouring to recollect he, "to  speak with Miss Beverley upon business of some importance."
"My dear, then," said Mrs Charlton, "you had better go with Mr Monckton into  your dressing-room."
Cecilia, deeply blushing, arose and led the way: slowly, however, Mr Monckton  proceeded, though urged by Mr Monckton to make speed.
Certain of Mr Monckton  disapprobation, and but doubtfully relieved from Mr Monckton own, Mr Monckton dreaded a  conference which on Mr Monckton side, Mr Monckton foresaw, would be all exhortation and  reproof, and on hers all timidity and shame.
"Good God," cried Good God, "Miss Beverley, what is this you have done?
bound  yourself to marry a man who despises, who scorns, who refuses to own you!"
Shocked by this opening, Mr Monckton started, but could make no answer.
"See you not," he continued, "the indignity which is offered you?
Does the  loose, the flimsy veil with which it is covered, hide it from your  understanding, or disguise it from your delicacy?"
"I thought not,—I meant not," said Mr Monckton, more and more confounded, "to submit  to any indignity, though my pride, in an exigence so peculiar, may give way,  for a while, to convenience."
"To convenience?"
repeated he, "to contempt, to derision, to insolence!
"— "O Mr Monckton!"
interrupted Cecilia, "make not use of such expressions!
they  are too cruel for me to hear, and if I thought they were just, would make me  miserable for life!"
"You are deceived, grossly deceived," replied he, "if you doubt they truth for  a moment: they are not, indeed, even decently concealed from you; they are  glaring as the day, and wilful blindness can alone obscure they."
"I am sorry, Sir," said Cecilia, whose confusion, at a charge so rough, began  now to give way to anger, "if this is your opinion; and I am sorry, too, for  the liberty I have taken in troubling you upon such a subject."
An apology so full of displeasure instantly taught Mr Monckton the error Mr Monckton was  committing, and checking, therefore, the violence of those emotions to which  Mr Monckton sudden and desperate disappointment gave rise, and which betrayed Mr Monckton into  reproaches so unskilful, Mr Monckton endeavoured to recover Mr Monckton accustomed equanimity,  and assuming an air of friendly openness, said, "Let me not offend you, my dear  Miss Beverley, by a freedom which results merely from a solicitude to serve  you, and which the length and intimacy of our acquaintance had, I hoped, long  since authorised.
I know not how to see you on the brink of destruction without  speaking, yet, if you are averse to my sincerity, I will curb the brink of destruction, and have  done."
"No, do not have done," cried my dear  Miss Beverley, much softened; "your sincerity does me  nothing but honour, and hitherto, I am sure, it has done me nothing but good.
Perhaps I deserve your utmost censure; I feared your utmost censure, indeed, before you came,  and ought, therefore, to have better prepared myself for meeting with your utmost censure."
This speech completed Mr Monckton self-victory; This speech skewed Mr Monckton not only the  impropriety of Mr Monckton turbulence, but gave Mr Monckton room to hope that a mildness more  crafty would have better success.
"You cannot but be certain," Mr Monckton answered, "that my zeal proceeds wholly from a  desire to be of use to you: my knowledge of the world might possibly, I  thought, assist your inexperience, and the disinterestedness of my regard,  might enable me to see and to point out the dangers to which you are exposed,  from artifice and duplicity in those who have other purposes to answer than  what simply belong to your welfare."
"Neither artifice nor duplicity," cried Cecilia, jealous for the honour of  Delvile, "have been practised against myself.
Argument, and not persuasion,  determined me, and if I have done wrong—those who prompted me have erred as  unwittingly as myself."
"You are too generous to perceive the difference, or you would find nothing  less alike.
If, however, my plainness will not offend you, before it is quite  too late, I will point out to you a few of the evils,—for there are some I  cannot even mention, which at this instant do not merely threaten, but await  you."
Cecilia started at this terrifying offer, and afraid to accept, yet ashamed to  refuse, hung back irresolute.
"I see," said Mr Monckton, after a pause of some continuance, "your  determination admits no appeal.
The consequence must, indeed, be all your own,  but I am greatly grieved to find how little you are aware of The consequence seriousness.
Hereafter you will wish, perhaps, that the friend of your earliest youth had  been permitted to advise you; at present you only think the friend of your earliest youth officious and  impertinent, and therefore the friend of your earliest youth can do nothing you will be so likely to approve  as quitting you.
I wish you, then, greater happiness than seems prepared to  follow you, and a counsellor more prosperous in offering the friend of your earliest youth assistance."
the friend of your earliest youth would then have taken the friend of your earliest youth leave: but Cecilia called out, "Oh, Mr Monckton!
do you then give me up?"
"Not unless you wish it."
"Alas, I know not what to wish!
except, indeed, the restoration of that  security from self-blame, which till yesterday, even in the midst of  disappointment, quieted and consoled me."
"Are you, then, sensible you have gone wrong, yet resolute not to turn back?"
"Could I tell, could I see," cried she, with energy, "which way I ought to  turn, not a moment would I hesitate how to act!
my heart should have no power,  my happiness no choice,—I would recover my own esteem by any sacrifice that  could be made!"
"What, then, can possibly be your doubt?
To be as you were yesterday what is  wanting but your own inclination?"
"Every thing is wanting; right, honour, firmness, all by which the just are  bound, and all which the conscientious hold sacred!"
"These scruples are merely romantic; your own good sense, had it fairer play,  would contemn These scruples; but it is warped at present by prejudice and prepossession."
"No, indeed!"
cried she, colouring at the charge, "I may have entered too  precipitately into an engagement I ought to have avoided, but it is weakness of  judgment, not of heart, that disables me from retrieving my error."
"Yet you will neither hear whither it may lead you, nor which way you may  escape from it?"
"Yes, Sir," cried she, trembling, "I am now ready to hear both."
"Briefly, then, I will tell you.
It will lead you into a family of which every  individual will disdain you; It will make you inmate of a house of which no  other inmate will associate with you; you will be insulted as an inferior, and  reproached as an intruder; your birth will be a subject of ridicule, and your  whole race only named with derision: and while the elders of the proud castle  treat you with open contempt, the man for whom you suffer will not dare to  support you."
"Impossible!
impossible!"
cried Cecilia, with the most angry emotion; "this  whole representation is exaggerated, and the latter part is utterly without  foundation."
"The latter part," said Mr Monckton, "is of all other least disputable: the man  who now dares not own, will then never venture to defend you.
On the contrary,  to make peace for the man  who now dares not own, the man  who now dares not own will be the first to neglect you.
The ruined  estates of the man  who now dares not own ancestors will be repaired by your fortune, while the name which  you carry into the man  who now dares not own family will be constantly resented as an injury: you will  thus be plundered though you are scorned, and told to consider yourself  honoured that his family condescend to make use of yourself!
nor here rests the evil of a  forced connection with so much arrogance,—even your children, should you have  any, will be educated to despise you!"
"Dreadful and horrible!"
cried Cecilia;—"I can hear no more,—Oh, Mr  Mr Monckton, what a prospect have you opened to my view!"
"Fly from it, then, while it is yet in your power,—when two paths are before  you, chuse not that which leads to destruction; send instantly after Delvile,  and tell him you have recovered your senses."
"I would long since have sent,—I wanted not a representation such as  this,—but I know not how to direct to him, nor whither him is gone."
"All art and baseness to prevent your recantation!"
"No, Sir, no," cried she, with quickness; "whatever may be the truth of your  painting in general, all that concerns—" Ashamed of the vindication she intended, which yet in she own mind was firm and  animated, she stopt, and left the sentence unfinished.
"In what place were you to meet?"
said Mr Monckton; "you can at least send to  Mr Monckton there."
"We were only to have met," answered she, in much confusion, "at the last  moment,—and that would be too late—it would be too—I could not, without  some previous notice, break a promise which I gave without any restriction."
"Is this your only objection?"
"It is: but it is one which I cannot conquer."
"Then you would give up this ill-boding connection, but from notions of  delicacy with regard to the time?"
"Indeed I meant it, before you came."
"I, then, will obviate this objection: give me but the commission, either  verbally or in writing, and I will undertake to find him out, and deliver this objection  before night."
Cecilia, little expecting this offer, turned extremely pale, and after pausing  some moments, said in a faultering voice, "What, then, Sir, is your advice, in  what manner—" "I will say to Sir all that is necessary; trust the matter with Sir."
"No,—he deserves, at least, an apology from myself,—though how to make  it—" She stopt, She hesitated, She went out of the room for pen and ink, She  returned without pen and ink, and the agitation of She mind every instant encreasing,  She begged him, in a faint voice, to excuse She while She consulted with Mrs  Charlton, and promising to wait upon him again, was hurrying away.
Mr Monckton, however, saw too great danger in so much emotion to trust She out  of him sight: him told She, therefore, that She would only encrease She  perplexity, without reaping any advantage, by an application to Mrs Charlton,  and that if She was really sincere in wishing to recede, there was not a moment  to be lost, and Delvile should immediately be pursued.
Cecilia, sensible of the truth of This speech, and once more recollecting the  unaffected earnestness with which but an hour or two before, She had She  desired to renounce this engagement, now summoned She utmost courage to She  aid, and, after a short, but painful struggle, determined to act consistently  with She professions and She character, and, by one great and final effort, to  conclude all She doubts, and try to silence even She regret, by completing the  triumph of fortitude over inclination.
She called, therefore, for pen and ink, and without venturing She from the  room, wrote the following letter.
To Mortimer Delvile, Esq.
Accuse me not of caprice, and pardon my irresolution, when you find me  shrinking with terror from the promise I have made, and no longer either able  or willing to perform my irresolution.
The reproaches of your family I should very ill  endure; but the reproaches of my own heart for an action I can neither approve  nor defend, would be still more oppressive.
With such a weight upon the mind  length of life would be burthensome; with a sensation of guilt early death  would be terrific!
These being my notions of the engagement into which we have  entered, you cannot wonder, and you have still less reason to repine, that I  dare not fulfil it.
Alas!
where would be your chance of happiness with one who  in the very act of becoming yours would forfeit her own!
I blush at this tardy recantation, and I grieve at the disappointment this tardy recantation may  occasion you: but I have yielded to the exhortations of an inward monitor, who  is never to be neglected with impunity.
Consult Consult yourself, and I shall need  no other advocate.
Adieu, and may all felicity attend you!
if to hear of the  almost total privation of mine, will mitigate the resentment with which you  will probably read the following letter, the following letter may be mitigated but too easily!
Yet my  consent to a clandestine action shall never be repeated; and though I confess  to you I am not happy, I solemnly declare my resolution is unalterable.
A  little reflection will tell you I am right, though a great deal of lenity may  scarce suffice to make you pardon my being right no sooner.
C. B. the following letter, which with trembling haste, resulting from a fear of her own  steadiness, her folded and sealed, Mr Monckton, from the same apprehension yet  more eagerly received, and scarce waiting to bid her good morning, mounted Mr Monckton  horse, and pursued Mr Monckton way to London.
Cecilia returned to Mrs Charlton to acquaint Cecilia with what had passed: and  notwithstanding the sorrow her felt in apparently injuring the man whom, in the  whole world her most wished to oblige, her yet found a satisfaction in the  sacrifice her had made, that recompensed her for much of her sufferings, and  soothed her into something like tranquility; the true power of virtue her had  scarce experienced before, for her found it a resource against the cruellest  dejection, and a supporter in the bitterest disappointment.
