 Lady Margaret Monckton received Cecilia with the most gloomy coldness: she  apologised for the liberty she had taken in making use of her ladyship's house,  but, meeting no return of civility, she withdrew to the room which had been  prepared for her, and resolved as much as possible to keep out of her sight. It now became necessary without further delay to settle her plan of life, and  fix her place of residence. The forbidding looks of Lady Margaret made her  hasten her resolves, which otherwise would for a while have given way to grief  for her recent misfortune. She sent for the surveyor who had the superintendance of her estates, to  enquire how soon her own house would be fit for her reception; and heard there  was yet work for near two months. This answer made her very uncomfortable. To continue two months under the roof  with Lady Margaret was a penance she could not enjoin herself, nor was she at  all sure Lady Margaret would submit to it any better: she determined,  therefore, to release herself from the conscious burthen of being an unwelcome  visitor, by boarding with some creditable family at Bury, and devoting the two  months in which she was to be kept from her house, to a general arrangement of  her affairs, and a final settling with her guardians. For these purposes it would be necessary she should go to London: but with  whom, or in what manner, she could not decide. She desired, therefore, another  conference with Mr Monckton, who met her in the parlour. She then communicated to him her schemes; and begged his counsel in her  perplexities. He was delighted at the application, and extremely well pleased with her design  of boarding at Bury, well knowing, he could then watch and visit her at his  pleasure, and have far more comfort in her society than even in his own house,  where all the vigilance with which he observed her, was short of that with  which he was himself observed by Lady Margaret. He endeavoured, however, to  dissuade her from going to town, but her eagerness to pay the large sum she  owed him, was now too great to be conquered. Of age, her fortune wholly in her  power, and all attendance upon Mrs Charlton at an end, she had no longer any  excuse for having a debt in the world, and would suffer no persuasion to make  her begin her career in life, with a negligence in settling her accounts which  she had so often censured in others. To go to London therefore she was fixed,  and all that she desired was his advice concerning the journey. He then told her that in order to settle with her guardians, she must write to  them in form, to demand an account of the sums that had been expended during  her minority, and announce her intention for the future to take the management  of her fortune into her own hands. She immediately followed his directions, and consented to remain at the Grove  till their answers arrived. Being now, therefore, unavoidably fixed for some time at the house, she thought  it proper and decent to attempt softening Lady Margaret in her favour. She  exerted all her powers to please and to oblige her; but the exertion was  necessarily vain, not only from the disposition, but the situation of her  ladyship, since every effort made for this conciliatory purpose, rendered her  doubly amiable in the eyes of her husband, and consequently to herself more  odious than ever. Her jealousy, already but too well founded, received every  hour the poisonous nourishment of fresh conviction, which so much soured and  exasperated a temper naturally harsh, that her malignity and ill-humour grew  daily more acrimonious. Nor would she have contented herself with displaying  this irascibility by general moroseness, had not the same suspicious  watchfulness which discovered to her the passion of her husband, served equally  to make manifest the indifference and innocence of Cecilia; to reproach her  therefore, she had not any pretence, though her knowledge how much she had to  dread her, past current in her mind for sufficient reason to hate her. The  Angry and the Violent use little discrimination; whom they like, they enquire  not if they approve; but whoever, no matter how unwittingly, stands in their  way, they scruple not to ill use, and conclude they may laudably detest. Cecilia, though much disgusted, gave not over her attempt, which she considered  but as her due while she continued in her house. Her general character, also,  for peevishness and haughty ill-breeding, skilfully, from time to time,  displayed, and artfully repined at by Mr Monckton, still kept her from  suspecting any peculiar animosity to herself, and made her impute all that  passed to the mere rancour of ill-humour. She confined herself, however, as  much as possible to her own apartment, where her sorrow for Mrs Charlton almost  hourly increased, by the comparison she was forced upon making of her house  with the Grove. That worthy old lady left her grand-daughters her co-heiresses and sole  executrixes. She bequeathed from them nothing considerable, though she left  some donations for the poor, and several of her friends were remembered by  small legacies. Among them Cecilia had her picture, and favourite trinkets,  with a paragraph in her will, that as there was no one she so much loved, had  her fortune been less splendid, she should have shared with her grand-daughters  whatever she had to bestow. Cecilia was much affected by this last and solemn remembrance. She more than  ever coveted to be alone, that she might grieve undisturbed, and she lamented  without ceasing the fatigue and the illness which, in so late a period, as it  proved, of her life, she had herself been the means of occasioning to her. Mr Monckton had too much prudence to interrupt this desire of solitude, which  indeed cost him little pain, as he considered her least in danger when alone.  She received in about a week answers from both her guardians. Mr Delvile's  letter was closely to the purpose, without a word but of business, and couched  in the haughtiest terms. As he had never, he said, acted, he had no accounts to  send in; but as he was going to town in a few days, he would see her for a  moment in the presence of Mr Briggs, that a joint release might be signed, to  prevent any future application to him. Cecilia much lamented there was any necessity for her seeing him at all, and  looked forward to the interview as the greatest mortification she could suffer. Mr Briggs, though still more concise, was far kinder in his language: but he  advised her to defer her scheme of taking the money into her own hands,  assuring her she would be cheated, and had better leave it to him. When she communicated these epistles to Mr Monckton, he failed not to read,  with an emphasis, by which his arrogant meaning was still more arrogantly  enforced, the letter of Mr Delvile aloud. Nor was he sparing in comments that  might render it yet more offensive. Cecilia neither concurred in what he said,  nor opposed it, but contented herself, when he was silent, with producing the  other letter. Mr Monckton read not this with more favour. He openly attacked the character of  Briggs, as covetous, rapacious, and over-reaching, and warned her by no means  to abide by his counsel, without first taking the opinion of some disinterested  person. He then stated the various arts which might be practised upon her  inexperience, enumerated the dangers to which her ignorance of business exposed  her, and annotated upon the cheats, double dealings, and tricks of stock  jobbing, to which he assured her Mr Briggs owed all he was worth, till,  perplexed and confounded, she declared herself at a loss how to proceed, and  earnestly regretted that she could not have his counsel upon the spot. This was his aim: to draw the wish from her, drew all suspicion of selfish  views from himself: and he told her that he considered her present situation as  so critical, the future confusion or regularity of her money transactions  seeming to depend upon it, that he would endeavour to arrange his affairs for  meeting her in London. Cecilia gave him many thanks for the kind intention, and determined to be  totally guided by him in the disposal and direction of her fortune. Mean time he had now another part to act; he saw that with Cecilia nothing more  remained to be done, and that, harbouring not a doubt of his motives, she  thought his design in her favour did her nothing but honour; but he had too  much knowledge of the world to believe it would judge him in the same manner,  and too much consciousness of duplicity to set its judgment at defiance. To parry, therefore, the conjectures which might follow his attending her, he  had already prepared Lady Margaret to wish herself of the party: for however  disagreeable to him was her presence and her company, he had no other means to  be under the same roof with Cecilia. Miss Bennet, the wretched tool of his various schemes, and the mean sycophant  of his lady, had been employed by him to work upon her jealousy, by secretly  informing her of his intention to go to town, at the same time that Cecilia  went thither to meet her guardians. She pretended to have learned this  intelligence by accident, and to communicate it from respectful regard; and  advised her to go to London herself at the same time, that she might see into  his designs, and be some check upon his pleasure. The encreasing infirmities of Lady Margaret made this counsel by no means  palatable: but Miss Bennet, following the artful instructions which she  received, put in her way so strong a motive, by assuring her how little her  company was wished, that in the madness of her spite she determined upon the  journey. And little heeding how she tormented herself while she had any view of  tormenting Mr Monckton, she was led on by her false confident to invite Cecilia  to her own house. Mr Monckton, in whom by long practice, artifice was almost nature, well knowing  his wife's perverseness, affected to look much disconcerted at the proposal;  while Cecilia, by no means thinking it necessary to extend her compliance to  such a punishment, instantly made an apology, and declined the invitation. Lady Margaret, little versed in civility, and unused to the arts of persuasion,  could not, even for a favourite project, prevail upon herself to use entreaty,  and therefore, thinking her scheme defeated, looked gloomily disappointed, and  said nothing more. Mr Monckton saw with delight how much this difficulty inflamed her, though the  moment he could speak alone with Cecilia he made it his care to remove it. He represented to her that, however privately she might live, she was too young  to be in London lodgings by herself, and gave an hint which she could not but  understand, that in going or in staying with only servants, suspicions might  soon be raised, that the plan and motive of her journey were different to those  given out. She knew he meant to insinuate that it would be conjectured she designed to  meet Delvile, and though colouring, vext and provoked at the suggestion, the  idea was sufficient to frighten her into his plan. In a few days, therefore, the matter was wholly arranged, Mr Monckton, by his  skill and address, leading every one whither he pleased, while, by the artful  coolness of his manner, he appeared but to follow himself. He [set] out the day  before, though earnestly wishing to accompany them, but having as yet in no  single instance gone to town in the same carriage with Lady Margaret, he dared  trust neither the neighbourhood nor the servants with so dangerous a subject  for their comments. Cecilia, compelled thus to travel with only her Ladyship and Miss Bennet, had a  journey the most disagreeable, and determined, if possible, to stay in London  but two days. She had already fixed upon a house in which she could board at  Bury when she returned, and there she meant quietly to reside till she could  enter her own. Lady Margaret herself, exhilarated by a notion of having outwitted her husband,  was in unusual good spirits, and almost in good humour. The idea of thwarting  his designs, and being in the way of his entertainment, gave to her a delight  she had seldom received from any thing; and the belief that this was effected  by the superiority of her cunning, doubled her contentment, and raised it to  exultation. She owed him, indeed, much provocation and uneasiness, and was  happy in this opportunity of paying her arrears. Mean while that consummate master in every species of hypocrisy, indulged her  in this notion, by the air of dissatisfaction with which he left the house. It  was not that she meant by her presence to obviate any impropriety: early and  long acquainted with the character of Cecilia, she well knew, that during her  life the passion of her husband must be confined to his own breast: but  conscious of his aversion to herself, which she resented with the bitterest  ill-will, and knowing how little, at any time, he desired her company, she  consoled herself for her inability to give pleasure by the power she possessed  of giving pain, and bore with the fatigue of a journey disagreeable and  inconvenient to her, with no other view than the hope of breaking into his plan  of avoiding her. Little imagining that the whole time she was forwarding his  favourite pursuit, and only acting the part which he had appointed her to  perform.
