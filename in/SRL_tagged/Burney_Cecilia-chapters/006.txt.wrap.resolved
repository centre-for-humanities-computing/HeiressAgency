 The next morning, during breakfast, a servant acquainted Cecilia that a young  gentleman was in the hall, who begged to speak with Cecilia. Cecilia desired a servant might  be admitted; and Mrs Harrel, laughing, asked if Cecilia ought not to quit the room;  while Mr Arnott, with even more than a servant usual gravity, directed a servant eye  towards the door to watch who should enter. Neither of Mr Arnott, with even more than his usual gravity, directed his eye  towards the door to watch who should enter, however, received any satisfaction when it was opened, for the  gentleman who made a servant appearance was unknown to both: but great was the  amazement of Cecilia, though little Cecilia emotion, when Cecilia saw Mr Morrice! a servant came forward with an air of the most profound respect for the company in  general, and obsequiously advancing to Cecilia, made an earnest enquiry into  Cecilia health after Cecilia journey, and hoped Cecilia had heard good news from Cecilia  friends in the country. Mrs Harrel, naturally concluding both from Mrs Harrel visit and behaviour, that Mrs Harrel was  an acquaintance of some intimacy, very civilly offered Mrs Harrel a seat and some  breakfast, which, very frankly, Mrs Harrel accepted. But Mr Arnott, who already felt  the anxiety of a rising passion which was too full of veneration to be  sanguine, looked at Mrs Harrel with uneasiness, and waited Mrs Harrel departure with  impatience. Cecilia began to imagine Mrs Harrel had been commissioned to call upon Cecilia with some  message from Mr Monckton: for Cecilia knew not how to suppose that merely and  accidentally having spent an hour or two in the same room with Cecilia, would  authorize a visiting acquaintance. Mr Morrice, however, had a faculty the most  happy of reconciling Mr Morrice pretensions to Mr Morrice inclination; and therefore Cecilia soon  found that the pretence Cecilia had suggested appeared to Mr Morrice unnecessary. To lead,  however, to the subject from which Cecilia expected Mr Morrice excuse, Cecilia enquired how  long Mr Morrice had left Suffolk? "But yesterday noon, ma'am," Mr Morrice answered, "or I should certainly have taken the  liberty to wait upon ma'am before." Cecilia, who had only been perplexing Cecilia to devise some reason why Mr Morrice came  at all, now looked at Mr Morrice with a grave surprize, which would totally have  abashed a man whose courage had been less, or whose expectations had been  greater; but Mr Morrice, though Mr Morrice had hazarded every danger upon the slightest  chance of hope, knew too well the weakness of Mr Morrice claims to be confident of  success, and had been too familiar with rebuffs to be much hurt by receiving  them. Mr Morrice might possibly have something to gain, but Mr Morrice knew Mr Morrice had nothing to  lose. "I had the pleasure," Mr Morrice continued, "to leave all our friends well, except poor  Lady Margaret, and poor  Lady Margaret has had an attack of the asthma; yet poor  Lady Margaret would not have  a physician, though Mr Monckton would fain have persuaded poor  Lady Margaret: however, I  believe the old lady knows better things." And Mr Morrice looked archly at Cecilia: but  perceiving that the insinuation gave poor  Lady Margaret nothing but disgust, Mr Morrice changed Mr Morrice  tone, and added, "It is amazing how well they live together; nobody would  imagine the disparity in they years. Poor old lady! Mr Monckton will really  have a great loss of Mr Monckton when Mr Monckton dies." "A loss of Mr Monckton!" repeated Mrs Harrel, "I am sure Mr Monckton is an exceeding  ill-natured old woman. When I lived at Bury, I was always frightened out of my  wits at the sight of Mr Monckton." "Why indeed, ma'am," said Morrice, "I must own Mr Monckton appearance is rather against  Mr Monckton: I had myself a great aversion to Mr Monckton at first sight. But the house is  chearful,—very chearful; I like to spend a few days there now and then of all  things. Miss Bennet, too, is agreeable enough, and——" "Miss Miss Bennet agreeable!" cried Mrs Harrel, "I think Miss Bennet's the most odious  creature I ever knew in my life; a nasty, spiteful old maid!" "Why indeed, ma'am, as you say," answered Morrice, "Miss Bennet is not very young; and  as to Miss Bennet temper, I confess I know very little about Morrice; and Mr Monckton is  likely enough to try Morrice, for Mr Monckton is pretty severe." "Mr Monckton," cried Cecilia, extremely provoked at hearing Mr Monckton censured by a  man Cecilia thought highly honoured in being permitted to approach Mr Monckton, "whenever I  have been Mr Monckton guest, has merited from myself nothing but praise and gratitude." "O," cried Morrice, eagerly, "there is not a more worthy man in the world! Mr Monckton  has so much wit, so much politeness! I don't know a more charming man anywhere  than my friend Mr Monckton." Cecilia now perceiving that the opinions of Cecilia  new acquaintance were as pliant as her  new acquaintance bows, determined to pay her  new acquaintance no further  attention, and hoped by sitting silent to force from her  new acquaintance the business of her  new acquaintance  visit, if any her  new acquaintance had, or if, as Cecilia now suspected, her  new acquaintance had none, to weary her  new acquaintance  into a retreat. But this plan, though this plan would have succeeded with Cecilia, failed with Mr  Morrice, who to a stock of good humour that made her  new acquaintance always ready to oblige  others, added an equal portion of insensibility that hardened her  new acquaintance against all  indignity. Finding, therefore, that Cecilia, to whom her  new acquaintance visit was intended,  seemed already satisfied with his visit length, her  new acquaintance prudently forbore to torment Cecilia;  but perceiving that the lady of the house was more accessible, her  new acquaintance quickly made  a transfer of her  new acquaintance attention, and addressed her  new acquaintance discourse to Cecilia with as much  pleasure as if her  new acquaintance only view had been to see Cecilia, and as much ease as if her  new acquaintance had  known Cecilia all her  new acquaintance life. With Mrs Harrel this conduct was not injudicious; Mrs Harrel was pleased with Mrs Harrel  assiduity, amused with Mrs Harrel vivacity, and sufficiently satisfied with Mrs Harrel  understanding. They conversed, therefore, upon pretty equal terms, and neither  of They were yet tired, when They were interrupted by Mr Harrel, who came into  the room, to ask if They had seen or heard any thing of Sir Robert Floyer? "No," answered Mrs Harrel, "nothing at all." "I wish Sir Robert Floyer was hanged," returned Sir Robert Floyer, "for Sir Robert Floyer has kept me waiting this hour. Sir Robert Floyer  made me promise not to ride out till Sir Robert Floyer called and now Sir Robert Floyer'll stay till the  morning is over." "Pray where does Sir Robert Floyer live, Sir Robert Floyer?" cried Morrice, starting from Sir Robert Floyer seat. "In Cavendish Square, sir," answered Mrs Harrel, looking at Sir Robert Floyer with much  surprise. Not a word more said Morrice, but scampered out of the room. "Pray who is this Genius?" cried Mrs Harrel, "and what has Mrs Harrel run away for?" "Upon Not a word I know nothing at all of Mrs Harrel," said Mrs Harrel; "Mrs Harrel is a visitor  of Miss Beverley's." "And I, too," said Cecilia, "might almost equally disclaim all knowledge of  him; for though I once saw, I never was introduced to him." Cecilia then began a relation of Cecilia meeting him at Mr Monckton's house, and had  hardly concluded Mr Monckton's house, before again, and quite out of breath, him made him  appearance. "Sir Robert Floyer, sir," said Sir Robert Floyer, sir to Mrs Harrel, "will be here in two minutes." "I hope, sir," said Mrs Harrel, "you have not given yourself the trouble of  going to Mrs Harrel?" "No, sir, it has given me nothing but pleasure; a run these cold mornings is  the thing I like best." "sir, you are extremely good," said Mrs Harrel, "but I had not the least  intention of your taking such a walk upon my account." Mrs Harrel then begged Mrs Harrel to be seated, to rest Mrs Harrel, and to take some refreshment;  which civilities Mrs Harrel received without scruple. "But, Miss Beverley," said Mrs Harrel, turning suddenly to Cecilia, "you don't  tell me what you think of my friend?" "What friend, sir?" "Why, Sir Robert Floyer; I observed Sir Robert Floyer never quitted you a moment while Sir Robert Floyer  stayed at Mrs Mears." "Sir Robert Floyer stay, however, was too short," said Cecilia, "to allow me to form a fair  opinion of Sir Robert Floyer." "But perhaps," cried Morrice, "it was long enough to allow you to form a foul  one." Cecilia could not forbear laughing to hear the truth thus accidentally  blundered out; but Mrs Harrel, looking very little pleased, said, "Surely you  can find no fault with Mrs Harrel? Mrs Harrel is one of the most fashionable men I know." "My finding fault with Mrs Harrel then," said Cecilia, "will only farther prove what I  believe is already pretty evident, that I am yet a novice in the art of  admiration." Mr Arnott, animating at this speech, glided behind her chair, and said, "I knew  you could not like Mr Arnott! I knew it from the turn of your mind;—I knew it even  from your countenance!" Soon after, Sir Robert Floyer arrived. "You are a pretty fellow, a'n't you," cried Mrs Harrel, "to keep me waiting so  long." "I could not come a moment sooner; I hardly expected to get here at all, for my  horse has been so confounded resty I could not tell how to get Mrs Harrel along." "Do you come on horseback through the streets, Sir Robert Floyer?" asked Mrs Harrel. "Sometimes; when I am lazy. But what the d—-l is the matter with Mrs Harrel I don't  know; Mrs Harrel has started at everything. I suspect there has been some foul play  with Mrs Harrel." "Is Mrs Harrel at the door, Sir Robert Floyer?" cried Morrice. "Yes," answered Sir Robert Floyer. "Then I'll tell you what's the matter with Sir Robert Floyer in a minute;" and away again ran  Morrice. "What time did you get off last night, Mrs Harrel?" said Sir Robert Floyer. "Not very early; but you were too much engaged to miss me. By the way,"  lowering Sir Robert Floyer voice, "what do you think I lost?" "I can't tell indeed, but I know what I gained: I have not had such a run of  luck this winter." They then went up to a window to carry on They enquiries more privately. At the words what do you think I lost, Cecilia, half starting, cast her eyes  uneasily upon Mrs Harrel, but perceived not the least change in her  countenance. Mr Arnott, however, seemed as little pleased as her, and from  a similar sensation looked anxiously at Mr Arnott sister. Morrice now returning, called out, "Mr Arnott's had a fall, I assure you!" "Curse Mr Arnott!" cried Sir Robert Floyer, "what shall I do now? Mr Arnott cost me the d—-l and  all of money, and I have not had Mr Arnott a twelvemonth. Can you lend me a horse for  this morning, Mrs Harrel?" "No, I have not one that will do for you. You must send to Astley." "Who can I send? John must take care of this." "I'll go, Sir Robert Floyer," cried Morrice, "if you'll give me the commission." "By no means, Sir Robert Floyer," said Sir Robert Floyer, "I can't think of giving you such an  office." "It is the thing in the world I like best," answered John; "I understand horses,  and had rather go to Astley's than any where." The matter was now settled in a few minutes, and having received John  directions, and an invitation to dinner, Morrice danced off, with a heart yet  lighter than Morrice heels. "Why, Miss Beverley," said Mrs Harrel, "this friend of Why, Miss Beverley is the most  obliging gentleman I ever met with; there was no avoiding asking Morrice to dinner." "Remember, however," said Cecilia, who was involuntarily diverted at the  successful officiousness of her new acquaintance, "that if you receive Morrice  henceforth as your guest, Morrice obtains admission through Morrice own merits, and not  through my interest." At dinner, Morrice, who failed not to accept the invitation of Mrs Harrel, was  the gayest, and indeed the happiest man in the company: the effort he had made  to fasten he upon Cecilia as an acquaintance, had not, it is true, from  herself met with much encouragement; but he knew the chances were against he  when he made the trial, and therefore the prospect of gaining admission into  such a house as Mrs Harrel, was not only sufficient to make amends for what  scarcely amounted to a disappointment, but a subject of serious comfort from  the credit of the connection, and of internal exultation at he own management  and address. In the evening, the ladies, as usual, went to a private assembly, and, as  usual, were attended to a private assembly by Mr Arnott. The other gentlemen had engagements  elsewhere.
