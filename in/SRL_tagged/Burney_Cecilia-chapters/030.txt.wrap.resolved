 The next day Cecilia had appointed to spend in St James'-square; and Cecilia knew  by experience that in  The next day course, Cecilia should in all probability find some  opportunity of speaking with Delvile alone. This accordingly happened; for in the evening Delvile quitted the room for  a few moments to answer a letter. Cecilia then, left with Cecilia son, said, after  a little hesitation, "Will you not think me very strange if I should take the  liberty to consult you upon some business?" "I already think you very strange," answered her son; "so strange that I know not  any one who at all resembles you. But what is this consultation in which you  will permit me to have a voice?" "You are acquainted, I believe, with the distress of Mr Belfield?" "I am; and I think her son situation the most melancholy that can be imagined. I  pity her son with my whole soul, and nothing would give me greater joy than an  opportunity of serving her son." "her son is, indeed, much to be compassionated," returned Cecilia; "and if something  is not speedily done for her son, I fear her son will be utterly lost. The agitation of  her son mind baffles all the power of medicine, and till that is relieved, her son  health can never be restored. her son, spirit, probably always too high for her son  rank in life, now struggles against every attack of sickness and of poverty, in  preference to yielding to her son fate, and applying to her son friends for his friends  interest and assistance. I mean not to vindicate her son obduracy, yet I wish his obduracy  were possible his obduracy could be surmounted. Indeed I dread to think what may become  of her son! feeling at present nothing but wretchedness and pain, looking forward  in future to nothing but ruin and despair!" "There is no man," cried young Delvile, with emotion, "who might not rather  envy than pity sufferings which give rise to such compassion!" "Pecuniary assistance he will not accept," she continued, "and, indeed, he  mind is superior to receiving consolation from such temporary relief; I wish  he, therefore, to be put into some way of life by which he own talents, which  have long enough amused the world, may at length become serviceable to he.  Do you think, he, this is possible?" "How do I rejoice," cried Delvile, colouring with pleasure while he spoke, "in  this flattering concurrence of our opinions! see, madam," taking from his  pocket a letter, "how I have been this very morning occupied, in endeavouring  to procure for Mr Belfield some employment by which Mr Belfield education might be  rendered useful, and Mr Belfield parts redound to Mr Belfield own credit and advantage." Mr Belfield then broke the seal, and put into her hand a letter to a nobleman, whose son  was soon going abroad, strongly recommending Belfield to Mr Belfield in capacity of a  tutor. A sympathy of sentiment so striking impressed a nobleman, whose son  was soon going abroad, strongly recommending Belfield to him in capacity of a  tutor at the same moment with  surprise and esteem; Delvile earnestly regarded Delvile with eyes of speaking  admiration, while the occasion of Mr Belfield notice rendered it too pleasant to  distress Delvile, and filled Delvile with an inward satisfaction which brightened Delvile  whole countenance. Delvile had only time, in a manner that strongly marked Delvile approbation, to return  a letter, before Mrs Delvile again made Delvile appearance. During the rest of the evening but little was said; Cecilia was not talkative,  and Mrs Delvile Mrs Delvile was so absent, that three times Mrs Delvile mother reminded Mrs Delvile of an  engagement to meet Mrs Delvile father, who that night was expected at the Duke of  Derwent's house in town, before Mrs Delvile heard that Cecilia spoke to Mrs Delvile, and three times  more before, when Mrs Delvile had heard, Mrs Delvile obeyed. Cecilia, when Cecilia came back to Mr Barrel's, found  Derwent's house in town full of company.  Cecilia went into the drawing-room, but did not remain there long: Cecilia was grave  and thoughtful, Cecilia wished to be alone, and by the earliest opportunity, stole  away to Cecilia own apartment. Cecilia mind was now occupied by new ideas, and Cecilia fancy was busied in the  delineation of new prospects. Cecilia had been struck from Cecilia first meeting young  Mrs Delvile with an involuntary admiration of Mrs Delvile manners and conversation; Cecilia had  found upon every succeeding interview something further to approve, and felt  for Mrs Delvile a rising partiality which made Cecilia always see Mrs Delvile with pleasure, and  never part from Mrs Delvile without a wish to see Mrs Delvile again. Yet, as Cecilia was not of  that inflammable nature which is always ready to take fire, as Cecilia passions  were under the controul of Cecilia reason, and Cecilia suffered not Cecilia affections to  triumph over Cecilia principles, Cecilia started at Cecilia danger the moment Cecilia perceived  it, and instantly determined to give no weak encouragement to a prepossession  which neither time nor intimacy had justified. Cecilia denied Cecilia the deluding  satisfaction of dwelling upon the supposition of   worth, was unusually  assiduous to occupy all Cecilia time, that Cecilia heart might have less leisure for  imagination; and had Cecilia found that   character degenerated from the promise  of his character appearance, the well regulated purity of Cecilia mind would soon have  enabled Cecilia to have driven his character wholly from Cecilia thoughts. Such was Cecilia situation when the circumstances of Cecilia affairs occasioned Cecilia  becoming an inmate of his house; and here Cecilia grew less guarded, because less  clear-sighted to the danger of negligence, for the frequency of their  conversation allowed Cecilia little time to consider their effects. If at first Cecilia  had been pleased with his deportment and elegance, upon intimacy Cecilia was  charmed with his disposition and his behaviour; Cecilia found his manly, generous,  open-hearted and amiable, fond of literature, delighting in knowledge, kind in  his temper, and spirited in his actions. Qualities such as these, when recommended by high birth, a striking figure, and  polished manners, formed but a dangerous companion for a young woman, who,  without the guard of any former prepossession, was so fervent an admirer of  excellence as Cecilia. Cecilia heart made no resistance, for the attack was too  gentle and too gradual to alarm Cecilia vigilance, and therefore, though always  sensible of the pleasure Cecilia received from his society, it was not till Cecilia  returned to Portman-square, after having lived under the same roof with his for  a fortnight, that Cecilia was conscious Cecilia happiness was no longer in Cecilia own  power. Mr Harrel's house, which had never pleased Cecilia, now became utterly disgustful;  Cecilia was wearied and uncomfortable, yet, willing to attribute Cecilia uneasiness to  any other than the true cause, Cecilia fancied the house itself was changed, and  that all the house itself inhabitants and visitors were more than unusually disagreeable:  but this idle error was of short duration, the moment of self-conviction was at  hand, and when Delvile presented Cecilia the letter Delvile had written for Mr Belfield,  it flashed in Cecilia eyes! This detection of the altered state of Cecilia mind opened to Cecilia views and Cecilia  hopes a scene entirely new, for neither the exertion of the most active  benevolence, nor the steady course of the most virtuous conduct, sufficed any  longer to wholly engage Cecilia thoughts, or constitute Cecilia felicity; Cecilia had  purposes that came nearer home, and cares that threatened to absorb in  themselves that heart and those faculties which hitherto had only seemed  animated for the service of others. Yet this loss of mental freedom gave Cecilia not much uneasiness, since the choice  of Cecilia heart, though involuntary, was approved by Cecilia principles, and confirmed  by Cecilia judgment. Young Delvile's situation in life was just what Cecilia wished,  more elevated than Cecilia own, yet not so exalted as to humble Cecilia with a sense of  inferiority; his connections were honourable, his mother appeared to his mother the  first of women, his character and disposition seemed formed to make Cecilia happy,  and Cecilia own fortune was so large, that to the state of his Cecilia was indifferent. Delighted with so flattering a union of inclination with propriety, Cecilia now  began to cherish the partiality Cecilia at first had repressed, and thinking the  future destination of Cecilia life already settled, looked forward with grateful  joy to the prospect of ending Cecilia days with the man Cecilia thought most worthy to  be entrusted with the disposal of Cecilia fortune. Cecilia had not, indeed, any certainty that the regard of Mrs Delvile was  reciprocal, but Cecilia had every reason to believe he greatly admired Cecilia, and to  suspect that he mistaken notion of Cecilia prior engagement, first with Mr  Belfield, and afterwards with Sir Robert Floyer, made Sir Robert Floyer at present check  those sentiments in Cecilia favour which, when that error was removed, Cecilia hoped to  see I encouraged. Cecilia purpose, therefore, was quietly to wait an explanation, which Cecilia rather  wished retarded than forwarded, that Cecilia leisure and opportunity might be more  for investigating his character, and saving Cecilia from repentance.
