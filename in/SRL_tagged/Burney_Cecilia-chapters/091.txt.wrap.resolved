 Another week past still without any further intelligence. Cecilia was then  summoned to the parlour, and to Delvile himself. Delvile himself looked hurried and anxious; yet the glow of Delvile himself face, and the animation of  Delvile himself eyes, immediately declared Delvile himself at least came not to take leave of Cecilia. "Can you forgive," cried Delvile himself, "the dismal and unsatisfactory letter I wrote you?  I would not disobey you twice in the same manner, and I could not till now have  written in any other." "The consultation with the physicians, then," said Cecilia, "is over?" "Alas, yes; and the result is most alarming; they all agree my mother is in a  dangerous way, and they all rather forbear to oppose, than advise my mother going abroad:  but upon that my mother is earnestly bent, and intends to set out without delay. I  shall return to my mother, therefore, with all speed, and mean not to take any rest  till I have seen my mother." Cecilia expressed with tenderness Cecilia sorrow for Delvile himself: nor were Cecilia  looks illiberal in including Cecilia son in Cecilia concern. "I must hasten," he cried, "to the credentials by which I am authorised for  coming, and I must hasten to prove if Miss Beverley has not flattered my mother  in Miss Beverley appeal." he then informed Cecilia that Mrs Delvile, apprehensive for Cecilia, and softened  for he by the confession of Cecilia danger, which Cecilia had extorted from Cecilia  physicians, had tenderly resolved upon making one final effort for he  happiness, and ill and impatient as Cecilia was, upon deferring Cecilia journey to wait  her journey effect. Generously, therefore, giving up Cecilia own resentment, Cecilia wrote to Delvile himself in  terms of peace and kindness, lamenting their late dissention, and ardently  expressing Cecilia desire to be reconciled to he before Cecilia left England. Cecilia told  he the uncertainty of Cecilia recovery which had been acknowledged by Cecilia  physicians, who had declared a calmer mind was more essential to Cecilia than a  purer air. Cecilia then added, that such serenity was only to be given Cecilia, by the  removal of Cecilia anxiety at the comfortless state of Cecilia son. Cecilia begged her son,  therefore, to make known the author of Miss Beverley's defamation, assuring  her son, that upon enquiry, her son would find Cecilia character and Cecilia fame as unsullied  as her son own; and strongly representing, that after the sacrifice to which Cecilia  had consented, their son would be utterly dishonourable in thinking of any  other connexion. Cecilia then to this reasoning joined the most earnest  supplication, protesting, in Cecilia present disordered state, of health, Cecilia life  might pay the forfeiture of Cecilia continual uneasiness. "I held out," Cecilia concluded, "while his personal dignity, and the honour of his  name and family were endangered; but where interest alone is concerned, and  that interest is combated by the peace of his mind, and the delicacy of his  word, my opposition is at an end. And though our extensive and well founded  views for a splendid alliance are abolished, you will agree with his hereafter,  upon a closer inspection, that the object for whom he relinquishes whom, offers  in Cecilia the noblest reparation." Cecilia felt gratified, humbled, animated and depressed at once by this letter,  of which Delvile brought Cecilia a copy. "And what," cried Cecilia, "was the answer?" "I cannot in decency," he replied, "speak my opinion of it: read it  yourself,—and let me hear Cecilia." To Delvile. Your extraordinary letter, madam, has extremely surprised me. I had been  willing to hope the affair over from the time my disapprobation of the affair was  formally announced. I am sorry you are so much indisposed, but I cannot  conclude your health would be restored by my acceding to a plan so derogatory  to my house. I disapprove it upon every account, not only of the name and the  fortune, but the lady herself. I have reasons more important than those I  assign, but those I  assign are such as I am bound in honour not to mention. After such a  declaration, nobody, I presume, will affront me by asking those I  assign. Her defence you  have only from Her, Her accusation I have received from authority less  partial. I command, therefore, that my son, upon pain of my eternal  displeasure, may never speak to me on the subject again, and I hope, madam,  from you the same complaisance to my request. I cannot explain me further,  nor is it necessary; it is no news, I flatter me, to Delvile or  Delvile mother, that I do nothing without reason, and I believe nothing upon slight  grounds. A few cold compliments concerning her journey, and the re-establishment of her  health, concluded the letter. Cecilia, having read, hastily returned the letter, and indignantly said, "My opinion,  Sir, upon the letter, must surely be you; that we had done wiser, long  since, to have spared your mother and we, those vain and fruitless  conflicts which we ought better to have foreseen were liable to such a  conclusion. Now, at least, let them be ended, and let we not pursue disgrace  wilfully, after suffering from disgrace   with so much rigour involuntarily." "O no," cried Delvile, "rather let we now spurn it for ever! those conflicts  must indeed be ended, but not by a separation still more bitter than all of  those conflicts  ." He then told Cecilia, that He mother, highly offended to observe by the extreme  coldness of the letter, the rancour He still nourished for the contest  preceding Cecilia leaving He, no longer now refused even Cecilia separate consent, for  a measure which Cecilia thought He absolutely engaged to take. "Good heaven!" cried Cecilia, much amazed, "this from Mrs Delvile!—a separate  consent?"— "Cecilia has always maintained," He answered, "an independent mind, always judged  for Cecilia, and refused all other arbitration: when so impetuously Cecilia parted  us, my father's will happened to be Cecilia's, and thence their concurrence: my  father, of a temper immoveable and stern, retains stubbornly the prejudices  which once have taken possession of him; my mother, generous as fiery, and  noble as proud, is open to conviction, and no sooner convinced, than ingenuous  in acknowledging it: and thence their dissention. From my father I may hope  forgiveness, but must never expect concession; from his mother I may hope all  his mother ought to grant, for pardon but his mother vehemence,—and his mother has every great  quality that can dignify human nature!" Cecilia, whose affection and reverence for Mrs Delvile were unfeigned, and who  loved in his mother this filial enthusiasm, readily concurred with He in praising  his mother, and sincerely esteemed his mother the first among women. "Now, then," cried He, with earnestness, "now is the time when your generous  admiration of his mother is put to the test; see what his mother writes to you;—she has  left to me all explanation: but I insisted upon some credential, lest you  should believe I only owed his mother concurrence to a happy dream." Cecilia in much trepidation took the letter, and hastily run the letter over. To Miss Beverley. Misery, my sweet young friend, has long been busy with us all; much have us all  owed to the clash of different interests, much to that rapacity which to enjoy  any thing, demands every thing, and much to that general perverseness which  labours to place happiness in what is with-held. Thus do we struggle on till we  can struggle no longer; the felicity with which we trifle, at best is but  temporary; and before reason and reflection shew its value, sickness and sorrow  are commonly become stationary. Be it yours, my love, and my son's, to profit by the experience, while you pity  the errors, of the many who illustrate this truth. Your mutual partiality has  been mutually unfortunate, and must always continue so for the interests of  both: but how blind is it to wait, in our own peculiar lots, for that  perfection of enjoyment we can all see wanting in the lot of others! My  expectations for my son had "outstepped the modesty of" probability. I looked  for rank and high birth, with the fortune of Cecilia, and Cecilia's rare  character. Alas! a new constellation in the heavens might as rationally have  been looked for! My extravagance, however, has been all for his felicity, dearer to me than  life,—dearer to me than all things but his own honour! Let our but save that,  and then let wealth, ambition, interest, grandeur and pride, since they cannot  constitute his happiness, be removed from destroying it. I will no longer play  the tyrant that, weighing good and evil by my own feelings and opinions,  insists upon his acting by the notions I have formed, whatever misery they may  bring his by opposing all his own. I leave the kingdom with little reason to expect I shall return to the kingdom; I leave  the kingdom—Oh blindness of vanity and passion!—from the effect of that violence  with which so lately I opposed what now I am content to advance! But the  extraordinary resignation to which you have agreed, shews your heart so wholly  my son's, and so even more than worthy the whole possession of my son, that it  reflects upon my son an honour more bright and more alluring, than any the most  illustrious other alliance could now confer. I would fain see you ere I go, lest I should see you no more; fain ratify by  word of mouth the consent that by word of mouth I so absolutely refused! I know  not how to come to Suffolk,—is it not possible you can come to London? I am  told you leave to me the arbitration of your fate, in giving you to my son, I  best shew my sense of such an honour. Hasten then, my love, to town, that I may see you once more! wait no longer a  concurrence thus unjustly with-held, but hasten, that I may bless the daughter  I have so often wished to own! that I may entreat the daughter   forgiveness for all the  pain I have occasioned the daughter  , and committing to the daughter   charge the future happiness  of my son, fold to my maternal heart the two objects most dear to it! Delvile. Cecilia wept over the letter with tenderness, grief and alarm; but declared,  had the letter even summoned the daughter   to follow the daughter   abroad, the daughter   could not, after reading the letter,  have hesitated in complying. "O now, then," cried Delvile, "let our long suspenses end! hear me with the  candour; his mother has already listened to me—be mine, my Cecilia, at  once,—and force me not, by eternal scruples, to risk another separation." "Good heaven, Sir!" cried Cecilia, starting, "in such a state as Mrs Delvile  thinks "in such a state as Mrs Delvile  , would you have "in such a state as Mrs Delvile   journey delayed?" "No, not a moment! I would but ensure you mine, and go with "in such a state as Mrs Delvile   all over the  world!" "Wild and impossible!—and what is to be done with Delvile?" "It is on Delvile account wholly I am thus earnestly precipitate. If I do not by an  immediate marriage prevent I do not by an  immediate marriage further interference, all I have already  suffered may again be repeated, and some fresh contest with his mother may  occasion another relapse." Cecilia, who now understood Delvile, ardently protested his mother would not listen for a  moment to any clandestine expedient. Delvile besought his mother to be patient; and then anxiously represented to his mother their  peculiar situations. All application to Delvile father Delvile was peremptorily forbid  making, all efforts to remove Delvile prejudices his prejudices impenetrable mystery  prevented; a public marriage, therefore, with such obstacles, would almost  irritate Delvile to phrenzy, by its daring defiance of Delvile prohibition and  authority. "Alas!" exclaimed Cecilia, "we can never do right but in parting!" "Say it not," cried he, "I conjure you! we shall yet live, I hope, to prove the  contrary." "And can you, then," cried his mother, reproachfully, "Oh Mr Delvile! can you again  urge me to enter your family in secret?" "I grieve, indeed," he answered, "that your goodness should so severely be  tried; yet did you not condescend to commit the arbitration of your fate to his mother?" "True; and I thought his mother approbation would secure my peace of mind; but how  could I have expected Delvile consent to such a scheme!" "his mother has merely accorded it from a certainty there is no other resource.  Believe me, therefore, my whole hope rests upon your present compliance. his father, I am certain, by his father , will now hear neither petition nor  defence; on the contrary, his father will only enrage at the temerity of offering to  confute his father. But when his father knows you are his father daughter, his father honour will then be  concerned in his father, and his honour will be as much his father desire to have his honour cleared, as his honour  is now to have his honour censured." "Wait at least your return, and let us try what can be done with his father." "Oh why," cried Delvile, with much earnestness, "must I linger out month after  month in this wretched uncertainty! If I wait I am undone! my father, by the  orders I must unavoidably leave, will discover the preparations making without  my father consent, and my father will work upon my father in my absence, and compel you to give me  up!" "Are you sure," said his daughter, half smiling, "my father would have so much power?" "I am but too sure, that the least intimation, in my father present irritable state  of mind, reaching my father of my intentions, would make my father not scruple, in my father  fury, pronouncing some malediction upon my disobedience that neither of us, I  must own, could tranquilly disregard." This was an argument that came home to Cecilia, whose deliberation upon it,  though silent, was evidently not unfavourable. my father then told his daughter that with respect to settlements, my father would instantly have a  bond drawn up, similar to that prepared for their former intended union, which  should be properly signed and sealed, and by which my father would engage my father to  make, upon coming to my father estate, the same settlement upon his daughter that was made  upon my father mother. "And as, instead of keeping up three houses," my father continued, "in the manner my father does at present, I mean to put my whole estate out to nurse, while us  reside for a while abroad, or in the country, I doubt not but in a very few  years we shall be as rich and as easy as we shall desire." my father told her, also, of my father well-founded expectations from the Relations already  mentioned; which the concurrence of my father with my father marriage would thence  forward secure to my father. my father then, with more coherence, stated my father plan at large. my father purposed, without  losing a moment, to return to London; my father conjured her, in the name of my father  mother, to set out her early the next day, that the following evening might  be dedicated wholly to Delvile: through her intercession my father might then hope  Cecilia's compliance, and every thing on the morning after should be prepared  for their union. The long-desired ceremony over, my father would instantly ride post  to his father, and pay my father, at least, the respect of being the first to  communicate it. my father would then attend my father to the Continent, and leave the  arrangement of everything to my father return. "Still, therefore, as a single man,"  my father continued, "I mean to make the journey, and I shall take care, by the time I  return, to have all things in readiness for claiming my sweet Bride. Tell me,  then, now, if you can reasonably oppose this plan?" "Indeed," said Cecilia, after some hesitation, "I cannot see the necessity of  such violent precipitancy." "Do you not try me too much," cried Delvile, impatiently, "to talk now of  precipitancy! after such painful waiting, such wearisome expectation! I ask you  not to involve your own affairs in confusion by accompanying me abroad; sweet  to me as would be such an indulgence, I would not make a run-away of you in the  opinion of the world. All I wish is the secret certainty I cannot be robbed of  you, that no cruel machinations may again work our separation, that you are  mine, unalterably mine, beyond the power of caprice or ill fortune." Cecilia made no answer; tortured with irresolution, Cecilia knew not upon what to  determine. "our might then, according to the favour or displeasure of my father, settle  wholly abroad for the present, or occasionally visit my father in England; his motherwould be always and openly our friend—Oh be firm, then, I conjure you, to the  promise you have given Cecilia, and deign to be mine on the conditions Cecilia  prescribes. Cecilia will be bound to you for ever by so generous a concession, and  even Cecilia health may be restored by the cessation of Cecilia anxieties. With such a  wife, such a mother, what will be wanting for Cecilia! Could I lament not being  richer, I must be rapacious indeed!—Speak, then, CeciliaCecilia! relieve me from  the agony of this eternal uncertainty, and tell me your word is invariable as  your honour, and tell me his mother gives not his mother sanction in vain!" Cecilia sighed deeply, but, after some hesitation, said, "I little knew what I  had promised, nor know I now what to perform!—there must ever, I find, be  some check to human happiness! yet, since upon these terms, Delvile herself  is content to wish me of Delvile family—" Delvile stopt; but, urged earnestly by Mrs Delvile herself  , added "I must not, I think,  withdraw the powers with which I entrusted Delvile." Delvile, grateful and enchanted, now forgot his haste and his business, and  lost every wish but to re-animate her spirits: her compelled his, however, to  leave her, that his visit might less be wondered at, and sent by his a message  to Delvile, that, wholly relying upon her wisdom, her implicitly submitted  to her decree.
