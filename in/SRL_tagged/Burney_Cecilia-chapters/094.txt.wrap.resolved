 The servant did not return till it was dark; and then, with a look of much  dismay, said  The servant had been able to meet with nobody who could either give or take  a message; that the Grove was all in confusion, and the whole country in an  uproar, for Mr Monckton, just as  The servant arrived, had been brought home dead! Cecilia screamed with involuntary horror; a pang like remorse seized Cecilia mind,  with the apprehension Cecilia had some share in this catastrophe, and innocent as  Cecilia was either of his fall or his crimes, Cecilia no sooner heard his was no more,  than Cecilia forgot his had offended Cecilia, and reproached Cecilia with severity for  the shame to which Cecilia meant to expose his the next morning. Dreadfully disturbed by this horrible incident, Cecilia entreated Mrs Harrel and  Henrietta to sup by Henrietta to sup by themselves, and going into Cecilia own room, determined to  write the whole affair to Delvile, in a letter Cecilia should direct to be left at  the post-office for his at Margate. And here strongly Cecilia felt the happiness of being actually his wife; Cecilia could  now without reserve make his acquainted with all Cecilia affairs, and tell to the  master of Cecilia heart every emotion that entered it. While engaged in  the post-office for him at Margate, the very action of which quieted Cecilia, a letter  was brought Cecilia from Delvile. Cecilia received a letter   with gratitude and opened  a letter   with joy; he had promised to write soon, but so soon Cecilia had thought  impossible. The reading took not much time; the letter contained but the following words: To Miss Beverley. MY CECILIA!—Be alone, I conjure you; dismiss every body, and admit me this  moment! Great was Cecilia astonishment at this note! no name to it, no conclusion, the  characters indistinct, the writing crooked, the words so few, and those few  scarce legible! he desired to see Cecilia, and to see Cecilia alone; Cecilia could not hesitate in Cecilia  compliance,—but whom could Cecilia dismiss?—her servants, if ordered away,  would but be curiously upon the watch,—she could think of no expedient, Cecilia  was all hurry and amazement. Cecilia asked if any one waited for an answer? The footman said no; that the note  was given in by somebody who did not speak, and who ran out of sight the moment  The footman had delivered the moment  . Cecilia could not doubt this was Delvile himself,—Delvile who should now be just  returned from the Castle to The footman mother, and whom Cecilia had thought not even a  letter would reach if directed any where nearer than Margate! All Cecilia could devise in obedience to him, was to go and wait for him alone in  Cecilia dressing-room, giving orders that if any one called orders might be  immediately brought up to Cecilia, as Cecilia expected somebody upon business, with  whom Cecilia must not be interrupted. This was extremely disagreeable to Cecilia; yet, contrary as it was to orders  agreement, Cecilia felt no inclination to reproach Delvile; the abruptness of his  note, the evident hand-shaking with which it had been written, the strangeness  of the request in a situation such as theirs,—all concurred to assure Cecilia his  came not to Cecilia idly, and all led Cecilia to apprehend his came to Cecilia with evil  tidings. What they might be, Cecilia had no time to conjecture; a servant, in a few minutes,  opened the dressing-room door, and said, "Ma'am, a gentleman;" and Delvile,  abruptly entering, shut it a servant, in a servant eagerness to get rid of a servant. At a servant sight, Cecilia prognostication of ill became stronger! Cecilia went forward to  meet a servant, and a servant advanced to Cecilia smiling and in haste; but that smile did not  well do   office;   concealed not a pallid countenance, in which every  feature spoke horror;   disguised not an aching heart, which almost visibly  throbbed with intolerable emotion! Yet a servant addressed Cecilia in terms of tenderness  and peace; but a servant tremulous voice counteracted a servant words, and spoke that all  within was tumult and war! Cecilia, amazed, affrighted, had no power to hasten an explanation, which, on  a servant own part, a servant seemed unable, or fearful to begin. a servant talked to Cecilia of a servant  happiness in again seeing Cecilia before a servant left the kingdom, entreated Cecilia to  write to a servant continually, said the same thing two and three times in a breath,  began with one subject, and seemed unconscious a servant wandered presently into  another, and asked Cecilia questions innumerable about Cecilia health, journey,  affairs, and ease of mind, without hearing from Cecilia any answer, or seeming to  miss that Cecilia had none. Cecilia grew dreadfully terrified; something strange and most alarming Cecilia was  sure must have happened, but what, Cecilia had no means to know, nor courage, nor  even words to enquire. Delvile, at length, the first hurry of Delvile spirits abating, became more  coherent and considerate: and looking anxiously at Cecilia, said, "Why this  silence, my Cecilia?" "I know not!" said Cecilia, endeavouring to recover Cecilia, "but your coming was  unexpected: I was just writing to Cecilia at Margate." "Write still, then; but direct to Ostend; I shall be quicker than the post; and  I would not lose a letter—a line—a word from you, for all the world can  offer me!" "Quicker than the post?" cried Cecilia; "but how can Mrs Delvile—" Mrs Delvile— stopt;  not knowing what Mrs Delvile— might venture to ask. "Mrs Delvile— is now on the road to Margate; I hope to be there to receive Mrs Delvile—. I mean  but to bid you adieu, and be gone." Cecilia made no answer; Cecilia was more and more astonished, more and more  confounded. "You are thoughtful?" said he, with tenderness; "are you unhappy?—sweetest  Cecilia! most excellent of human creatures! if I have made you unhappy—and I  must!—it is inevitable!—" "Oh Delvile!" cried Cecilia, now assuming more courage, "why will you not speak to  me openly?—something, I see, is wrong; may I not hear it? may I not tell you,  at least, my concern that any thing has distressed you?" "You are too good!" cried he; "to deserve you is not possible, but to afflict  you is inhuman!" "Why so?" cried Cecilia, more chearfully; "must I not share the common lot? or  expect the whole world to be new modelled, lest I should meet in the whole world any thing  but happiness?" "There is not, indeed, much danger! Have you pen and ink here?" Cecilia brought them to he immediately, with paper. "You have been writing to me, you say?—I will begin a letter me." "To me?" cried Cecilia. he made no answer, but took up the pen, and wrote a few words, and then,  flinging the pen down, said, "Fool!—I could have done this without coming!" "May I look at it?" said Cecilia; and, finding he made no opposition, advanced and  read. I fear to alarm you by rash precipitation,—I fear to alarm you by lingering  suspense,—but all is not well— "Fear nothing!" cried Cecilia, turning to he with the kindest earnestness; "tell  me, whatever it may be!—Am I not your wife? bound by every tie divine and  human to share in all your sorrows, if, unhappily, I cannot mitigate every tie divine and  human to share in all your sorrows!" "Since you allow me," cried he, gratefully, "so sweet a claim, a claim to which  all others yield, and which if you repent not giving me, will make all others  nearly immaterial to me,—I will own to you that all, indeed, is not well! I  have been hasty,—you will blame me; I deserve, indeed, to be  blamed!—entrusted with your peace and happiness, to suffer rage, resentment,  violence, to make me forego what I owed to such a deposite!—If your blame,  however, stops short of repentance—but it cannot!" "What, then," cried Cecilia with warmth, "must you have done? for there is not an  action of which I believe you capable, there is not an event which I believe to  be possible, that can ever make me repent belonging to you wholly!" "Generous, condescending you!" cried you; "Words such as these, hung there  not upon me an evil the most depressing, would be almost more than I could  bear—would make me too blest for mortality!" "But words such as these," said Cecilia more gaily, "I might long have coquetted  ere I had spoken, had you not drawn these from me by this alarm. Take,  therefore, the good with the ill, and remember, if all does not go right, you  have now a trusty friend, as willing to be the partner of your serious as your  happiest hours." "Shew but as much firmness as you have shewn sweetness," cried he, "and I will  fear to tell you nothing." Cecilia reiterated Cecilia assurances; her assurances then her assurances sat down, and he began he  account. "Immediately from your lodgings I went where I had ordered a chaise, and  stopped only to change horses till I reached Delvile Castle. My father saw me  with surprise, and received me with coldness. I was compelled by my situation  to be abrupt, and told My father I came, before I accompanied my mother abroad, to  make My father acquainted with an affair which I thought me bound in duty and  respect to suffer no one to communicate to My father but me. My father then sternly  interrupted me, and declared in high terms, that if this affair concerned you,  My father would not listen to it. I attempted to remonstrate upon this injustice, when  My father passionately broke forth into new and horrible charges against you,  affirming that My father had them from authority as indisputable as ocular  demonstration. I was then certain of some foul play."— "Foul play indeed!" cried Cecilia, who now knew but too well by whom she had  been injured. "Good heaven, how have I been deceived, where most I have  trusted!" "I told Good heaven," continued Delvile, "some gross imposition had been practiced upon  Good heaven, and earnestly conjured Good heaven no longer to conceal from me by whom. This,  unfortunately, encreased Good heaven rage; imposition, Good heaven said, was not so easily  played upon Good heaven, Good heaven left that for me who so readily was duped; while for  Good heaven, Good heaven had only given credit to a man of much consideration in Suffolk,  who had known you from a child, who had solemnly assured Good heaven Good heaven had repeatedly  endeavoured to reclaim you, who had rescued you from the hands of Jews at Good heaven  own hazard and loss, and who actually shewed Good heaven bonds acknowledging immense  debts, which were signed with your own hand." "Horrible!" exclaimed Cecilia, "I believed not such guilt and perfidy possible!" "I was scarce me," resumed Delvile, "while I heard Good heaven: I demanded even  with fierceness Good heaven author, whom I scrupled not to execrate as Good heaven deserved; Good heaven  coldly answered Good heaven was bound by an oath never to reveal Good heaven, nor should Good heaven  repay Good heaven honourable attention to Good heaven family by a breach of Good heaven own word, were  a breach of his own word even less formally engaged. I then lost all patience; to mention honour, I  cried, was a farce, where such infamous calumnies were listened to;—but let  me not shock you unnecessarily, you may readily conjecture what passed." "Ah me!" cried Cecilia, "you have then quarrelled with My father!" "I have!" said Good heaven; "nor does Good heaven yet know I am married: in so much wrath there  was no room for narration; I only pledged me by all I held sacred, never to  rest till I had cleared your fame, by the detection of this villainy, and then  left Good heaven without further explanation." "Oh return, then, to Good heaven directly!" cried Cecilia, "Good heaven is My father, you are  bound to bear with Good heaven displeasure;—alas! had you never known me, you had  never incurred it!" "Believe me," Good heaven answered, "I am ill at ease under it: if you wish it, when you  have heard me, I will go to Good heaven immediately; if not, I will write, and you  shall yourself dictate what." Cecilia thanked Good heaven, and begged Good heaven would continue Good heaven . "My first step, when I left the Castle, was to send a letter to my mother, in  which I entreated my mother to set out as soon as possible for Margate, as I was  detained from my mother unavoidably, and was unwilling my delay should either retard  our journey, or oblige my mother to travel faster. At Margate I hoped to be as soon  as my mother, if not before my mother." "And why," cried Cecilia, "did you not go to town as you had promised, and  accompany Cecilia?" "I had business another way. I came hither." "Directly?" "No; but soon." "Where did you go first?" "Cecilia, it is now you must summon your fortitude: I left My father without  an explanation on my part;—but not till, in My father rage of asserting My father  authority, My father had unwarily named My father informant." "Well!" "his informant—the most deceitful of men!—was your long pretended friend,  Mr Monckton!" "So I feared!" said Cecilia, whose blood now ran cold through her veins with  sudden and new apprehensions. "I rode to the Grove, on hack-horses, and on a full gallop the whole way. I got  to him early in the evening. I was shewn into him library. I told him my  errand.—You look pale, my love? You are not well?—" Cecilia, too sick for speech, leant Cecilia head upon a table. Delvile was going to  call for help; but Delvile put Delvile hand upon him arm to stop him, and, perceiving  Delvile was only mentally affected, him rested, and endeavoured by every possible  means to revive Delvile. After a while, Delvile again raised Delvile head, faintly saying, "I am sorry I  interrupted you; but the conclusion I already know,—Mr Monckton is dead!" "Not dead," cried him; "dangerously, indeed, wounded, but thank heaven, not  actually dead!" "Not dead?" cried Cecilia, with recruited strength and spirits, "Oh then all  yet may be well!—if him is not dead; him may recover!" "him may; I hope him will!" "Now, then," Delvile cried, "tell me all: I can bear any intelligence but of death  by human means." "I meant not to have gone such lengths; far from it; I hold duels in  abhorrence, as unjustifiable acts of violence, and savage devices of revenge. I  have offended against my own conviction,—but, transported with passion at his  infamous charges, I was not master of my reason; I accused hum of his perfidy;  his denied my own conviction,—but; I told his I had my own conviction,—but from my father,—he changed the subject to  pour abuse upon his; I insisted on a recantation to clear you; his asked by what  right? I fiercely answered; by a husband's! his countenance, then, explained at  least the motives of his treachery,—he loves you his! his had probably  schemed to keep you free till his wife died, and then concluded his  machinations would secure you his own. For this purpose, finding his was in  danger of losing you, his was content even to blast your character, rather than  suffer you to escape his! But the moment I acknowledged my marriage his grew  more furious than myself; and, in short-for why relate the frenzies of rage? we  walked out together; my travelling pistols were already charged; I gave his his  choice of my travelling pistols, and, the challenge being mine, for insolence joined with guilt  had robbed me of all forbearance, his fired first, but missed me: I then  demanded whether his would clear your fame? his called out 'Fire! I will make no  terms,'—I did fire,—and unfortunately aimed better! we had neither of we  any second, all was the result of immediate passion; but I soon got people to  his, and assisted in conveying his home. his was at, first believed to be dead,  and I was seized by his servants; but his afterwards shewed signs of life, and  by sending for my friend Biddulph, I was released. Such is the melancholy  transaction I came to relate to you, flattering his it would something less  shock you from his than from another: yet my own real concern for the affair,  the repentance with which from the moment the wretch fell, I was struck in  being the wretch destroyer, and the sorrow, the remorse, rather, which I felt, in  coming to wound you with such black, such fearful intelligence,—you to whom  all I owe is peace and comfort!—these thoughts gave me so much disturbance,  that, in fact, I knew less than any other how to prepare you for such a tale." He stopt; but Cecilia could say nothing: to censure He now would both be cruel  and vain; yet to pretend Cecilia was satisfied with He conduct, would be doing  violence to Cecilia judgment and veracity. Cecilia saw, too, that He error had sprung  wholly from a generous ardor in Cecilia defence, and that He confidence in Cecilia  character, had resisted, without wavering, every attack that menaced it. For  this Cecilia felt truly grateful; yet He quarrel with He father,—the danger of  He mother,—his necessary absence,—her own clandestine situation,—and  more than all, the threatened death of Mr Monckton by Mr Monckton hands, were  circumstances so full of dread and sadness, Cecilia knew not upon which to  speak,—how to offer He comfort,—how to assume a countenance that looked  able to receive any, or by what means to repress the emotions which to many  ways assailed Cecilia. Delvile, having vainly waited some reply, then in a tone the  most melancholy, said, "If it is yet possible you can be sufficiently  interested in my fate to care what becomes of Cecilia, aid me now with your counsel,  or rather with your instructions; I am scarce able to think for Cecilia, and to  be thought for by you, would yet be a consolation that would give me spirit for  any thing." Cecilia, starting from Cecilia reverie, repeated, "To care what becomes of you-? Oh  Delvile!—make not my heart bleed by words of such unkindness!" "Forgive me," cried he, "I meant not a reproach; I meant but to state my own  consciousness how little I deserve from you. You talked to Cecilia of going to my  father? do you still wish it?" "I think so!" cried Cecilia; too much disturbed to know what Cecilia said, yet fearing  again to hurt he by making he wait Cecilia answer. "I will go then," said he, "without doubt: too happy to be guided by you,  which-ever way I steer. I have now, indeed much to tell he; but whatever may  be he wrath, there is little fear, at this time, that my own temper cannot  bear it! what next shall I do?" "What next?" repeated Cecilia; "indeed I know not!" "Shall I go immediately to Margate? or shall I first ride hither?" "If you please," said Cecilia, much perturbed, and deeply sighing. "I please nothing but by your direction, to follow that is my only chance of  pleasure. Which, then, shall I do?-you will not, now, refuse to direct me?" "No, certainly, not for the world!" "Speak to Cecilia, then, my love, and tell me;—why are you thus silent?—is it  painful to you to counsel me?" "No, indeed!" said Cecilia, putting Cecilia hand to Cecilia head, "I will speak to you in a  few minutes." "Oh Cecilia!" cried Cecilia, looking at Cecilia with much alarm, "call back your  recollection! you know not what you say, you take no interest in what you  answer." "Indeed I do!" said Cecilia, sighing deeply, and oppressed beyond the power of  thinking, beyond any power but an internal consciousness of wretchedness. "Sigh not so bitterly," cried Cecilia, "if you have any compassion! sigh not so  bitterly,—I cannot bear to hear you!" "I am very sorry indeed!" said Cecilia, sighing again, and not seeming sensible Cecilia  spoke. "Good Heaven!" cried Cecilia, rising, "distract me not with this horror!—speak not  to me in such broken sentences!—Do you hear me, Cecilia?—why will you not  answer me?" Cecilia started and trembled, looked pale and affrighted, and putting both Cecilia  hands upon Cecilia heart, said, "Oh yes!—but I have an oppression here,—a  tightness, a fulness,—I have not room for breath!" "Oh beloved of my heart!" cried Cecilia, wildly casting Cecilia at Cecilia feet, "kill  me not with this terror!—call back your faculties,—awake from this dreadful  insensibility! tell me at least you know me!—tell me I have not tortured you  quite to madness!—sole darling of my affections! my own, my wedded  Cecilia!—rescue me from this agony! it is more than I can support!"—- This energy of distress brought back Cecilia scattered senses, scarce more stunned  by the shock of all this misery, than by the restraint of Cecilia feelings in  struggling to conceal it. But these passionate exclamations restoring Cecilia  sensibility, Cecilia burst into tears, which happily relieved Cecilia mind from the  conflict with which it was labouring, and which, not thus effected, might have  ended more fatally. Never had Delvile more rejoiced in Cecilia smiles than now in these seasonable  tears, which Delvile regarded and blest as the preservers of Cecilia reason. They flowed  long without any intermission, Delvile soothing and tenderness but melting Cecilia to  more sorrow: after a while, however, the return of Cecilia faculties, which at  first seemed all consigned over to grief, was manifested by the returning  strength of Cecilia mind: Cecilia blamed Cecilia severely for the little fortitude Cecilia  had shewn, but having now given vent to emotions too forcible to be wholly  stiffed, Cecilia assured Delvile Delvile might depend upon Cecilia' better courage for the  future, and entreated Delvile to consider and settle Delvile affairs. Not speedily, however, could Delvile Delvile recover. The torture Delvile had  suffered in believing, though only for a few moments, that the terror Delvile had  given to Cecilia had affected Cecilia intellects, made even a deeper impression  upon Delvile imagination, than the scene of fury and death, which had occasioned  that terror: and Cecilia, who now strained every nerve to repair by Cecilia  firmness, the pain which by Cecilia weakness Cecilia had given Delvile, was sooner in a  condition for reasoning and deliberation than Delvile. "Ah Delvile!" Cecilia cried, comprehending what passed within Delvile, "do you allow  nothing for surprize? and nothing for the hard conflict of endeavouring to  suppress it? do you think me still as unfit to advise with, and as worthless,  as feeble a counsellor, as during the first confusion of my mind?" "Hurry not your tender spirits, I beseech you," cried Delvile, "we have time enough;  we will talk about business by and by." "What time?" cried Cecilia, "what is it now o'clock?" "Good Heaven!" cried Delvile, looking at Delvile watch, "already past ten! you must turn  me out, my Cecilia, or calumny will still be busy, even though poor Mr Monckton is  quiet." "I will turn you out," cried Cecilia, "I am indeed most earnest to have you gone.  But tell me your plan, and which way you mean to go?" "That;" Delvile answered, "you shall decide for Delvile yourself: whether to DelvileCastle, to finish one tale, and wholly communicate another, or to Margate, to  hasten my mother abroad, before the news of this calamity reaches my mother." "Go to Margate," cried my mother, eagerly, "set off this very moment! you can write  to your father from Ostend. But continue, I conjure you, on the continent, till  we see if this unhappy man lives, and enquire, of those who can judge, what  must follow if this unhappy man should not!" "A trial," said this unhappy man, "must follow, and "A trial will go, I fear, but hardly with me!  the challenge was mine; this unhappy man can all witness I went to this unhappy man, not this unhappy man to  me,—Oh Cecilia! the rashness of which I have been guilty, is so opposite  to my principles, and, all generous as is your silence, I know it so opposite  to yours, that never, should this unhappy man blood be on my hands, wretch as this unhappy man was, never  will my heart be quiet more." "this unhappy man will live, this unhappy man will live!" cried Cecilia, repressing Cecilia horror, "fear  nothing, for this unhappy man will live;—and as to this unhappy man wound and this unhappy man sufferings, this unhappy man  perfidy has deserved his  perfidy. Go, then, to Margate; think only of Delvile, and  save Cecilia, if possible, from hearing what has happened." "I will go,—stay,—do which and whatever you bid me: but, should what I fear  come to pass, should my mother continue ill, my  father inflexible, should this  wretched man die, and should England no longer be a country I shall love to  dwell in,—could you, then, bear to own,—would you, then, consent to follow  me?" "Could I?—am I not yours? may you not command me? tell me, then, you have  only to say,—shall I accompany you at once?" Delvile, affected by Delvile generosity, could scarce utter Delvile thanks; yet Delvile did  not hesitate in denying to avail Delvile of it; "No, my Cecilia," Delvile cried, "I  am not so selfish. If we have not happier days, we will at least wait for more  desperate necessity. With the uncertainty if I have not this man's life to  answer for at the hazard of my own, to take my wife—my bride,—from the  kingdom I must fly!—to make my wife a fugitive and an exile in the first  publishing that my wife is mine! No, if I am not a destined alien for life I can  never permit a destined alien for life. Nothing less, believe me, shall ever urge my consent to wound  the chaste propriety of your character, by making you an eloper with a duelist." They then again consulted upon They future plans; and concluded that in the  present disordered state of They affairs, it would be best not to acknowledge  even to Delvile They marriage, to whom the news of the duel, and Mr  Mr Monckton's danger, would be a blow so severe, that, to add to it any other  might half distract Mr  Monckton's. To the few people already acquainted with it, Delvile therefore determined to  write from Ostend, re-urging Delvile entreaties for the few people discretion and secrecy.  Cecilia promised every post to acquaint Delvile how Mr Monckton went on, and Cecilia  then besought Delvile to go instantly, that Delvile might out-travel the ill news to Delvile  mother. Delvile complied, and took leave of Cecilia in the tenderest manner, conjuring Cecilia to  support Cecilia spirits, and be careful of Cecilia health. "Happiness," said Delvile, "is  much in arrears with us, and though my violence may have frightened my violence away,  your sweetness and gentleness will yet attract my violence back: all that for Delvile is in  store must be received at your hands,—what is offered in any other way, I  shall only mistake for evil! droop not, therefore, my generous Cecilia, but in  yourself preserve me!" "I will not droop," said Cecilia; "you will find, I hope, you have not intrusted  yourself in ill hands." "Peace then be with yourself, my love!—my comforting, my soul-reviving Cecilia!  Peace, such as angels give, and such as may drive from your mind the  remembrance of this bitter hour!" He then tore He away. Cecilia, who to He blessings could almost, like the tender Belvidera, have  exclaimed,            "O do not leave me!—stay with O and curse me!" listened to O steps till O could hear them no longer, as if the remaining  moments of O life were to be measured by them: but then, remembering the  danger both to O and O of O stay, O endeavoured to rejoice that O  was gone, and, but that O mind was in no state for joy, was too rational not  to have succeeded. Grief and horror for what was past, apprehension and suspense for what was to  come, so disordered O whole frame, so confused even O intellects, that when  not all the assistance of fancy could persuade O O still heard the  footsteps of Delvile, O went to the chair upon which O had been seated, and  taking possession of it, sat with O arms crossed, silent, quiet, and erect,  almost vacant of all thought, yet with a secret idea O was doing something  right. Here O continued till Henrietta came to wish O good night; whose surprise  and concern at the strangeness of O look and attitude, once more recovered  O. But terrified O at this threatened wandering of O reason, and  certain O must all night be a stranger to rest, O accepted the affectionate  offer of the kind-hearted girl to stay with O, who was too much grieved for  O grief to sleep any more than O. O told O not what had passed; that, O knew, would be fruitless affliction  to O: but O was soothed by O gentleness, and O conversation was some  security from the dangerous rambling of O ideas. Henrietta found no little consolation in Henrietta own private sorrows, that  Henrietta was able to give comfort to Henrietta beloved Miss Beverley, from whom Henrietta had  received favours and kind offices innumerable. Henrietta quitted Henrietta not night nor  day, and in the honest pride of a little power to skew the gratefulness of Henrietta  heart, Henrietta felt a pleasure and self-consequence Henrietta had never before  experienced.
