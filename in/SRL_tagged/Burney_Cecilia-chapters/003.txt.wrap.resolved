 As soon as they lost sight of the house, Cecilia expressed Cecilia surprise at the  behaviour of the old gentleman who sat in the corner, whose general silence,  seclusion from the company, and absence of mind, had strongly excited Cecilia  curiosity. Mr Harrel could give Mr Harrel very little satisfaction: Mr Harrel told Mr Harrel that Mr Harrel had  twice or thrice met Mr Harrel in public places, where everybody remarked the  singularity of Mr Harrel manners and appearance, but that Mr Harrel had never discoursed  with anyone to whom Mr Harrel seemed known; and that Mr Harrel was as much surprised as  Mr Harrel in seeing so strange a character at the house of Mr Monckton. The conversation then turned upon the family they had just quitted, and Ceciliawarmly declared the good opinion Cecilia had of Mr Monckton, the obligations Cecilia  owed to Cecilia for the interest which, from Cecilia childhood, Cecilia had always taken in  Cecilia affairs; and Cecilia hopes of reaping much instruction from the friendship of a  man who had so extensive a knowledge of the world. Mr Harrel professed Mr Harrel well satisfied that Mr Harrel should have such a  counsellor; for though but little acquainted with Mr Harrel, Mr Harrel knew Mr Harrel was a man of  fortune and fashion, and well esteemed in the world. They mutually  compassionated Mr Harrel unhappy situation in domestic life, and Cecilia innocently  expressed Cecilia concern at the dislike Lady Margaret seemed to have taken to Lady Margaret;  a dislike which Mr Harrel naturally enough imputed to Lady Margaret youth and beauty, yet  without suspecting any cause more cogent than a general jealousy of attractions  of which Lady Margaret had Lady Margaret so long outlived the possession. As They journey drew near to their journey conclusion, all the uneasy and disagreeable  sensations which in the bosom of Cecilia had accompanied their journey commencement, gave  way to the expectation of quick approaching happiness in again meeting Lady Margaret  favourite young friend. Mr Harrel had in childhood been Mr Harrel playmate, and in youth Mr Harrel school-fellow;  a similarity of disposition with respect to sweetness of temper, had early  rendered them dear to each other, though the resemblance extended no farther,  Mr Harrel having no pretensions to the wit or understanding of Mr Harrel friend; but  Mr Harrel was amiable and obliging, and therefore sufficiently deserving affection,  though neither blazing with attractions which laid claim to admiration, nor  endowed with those superior qualities which mingle respect in the love they  inspire. From the time of Mr Harrel marriage, which was near three years, Mr Harrel had entirely  quitted Suffolk, and had had no intercourse with Cecilia but by letter. Mr Harrel was  now just returned from Violet Bank, the name given by Mr Harrel to a villa  about twelve miles from London, where with a large party of company Mr Harrel had  spent the Christmas holidays. Their meeting was tender and affectionate; the sensibility of Cecilia's heart  flowed from Cecilia eyes, and the gladness of Mr Harrel dimpled Mr Harrel cheeks. As soon as their mutual salutations, expressions of kindness, and general  inquiries had been made, Mr Harrel begged to lead Mr Harrel to the drawing-room,  "where," Mr Harrel added, "you will see some of my friends, who are impatient to be  presented to you." "I could have wished," said Cecilia, "after so long an absence, to have passed  this first evening alone with you." "They are all people who particularly desired to see you," Mr Harrel answered, "and I  had They by way of entertaining you, as I was afraid you would be out of  spirits at leaving Bury." Cecilia, finding the kindness of Mr Harrel intentions, forbore any further  expostulation, and quietly followed Mr Harrel to the drawing-room. But as the door  was opened, Mr Harrel was struck with amazement upon finding that the apartment,  which was spacious, lighted with brilliancy, and decorated with magnificence,  was more than half filled with company, every one of which was dressed with  gaiety and profusion. Cecilia, who from the word friends, expected to have seen a small and private  party, selected for the purpose of social converse, started involuntarily at  the sight before Mr Harrel, and had hardly courage to proceed. Mrs Harrel, however, took Mrs Harrel hand and introduced Mrs Harrel to the whole company, who  were all severally named to Mrs Harrel; a ceremonial which though not merely agreeable  but even necessary to those who live in the gay world, in order to obviate  distressing mistakes, or unfortunate implications in discourse, would by  Mrs Harrel have been willingly dispensed with, since to Mrs Harrel their names were as  new as their persons, and since knowing nothing of their names histories, parties or  connections, Mrs Harrel could to nothing allude: it therefore served but to heighten  Mrs Harrel colour and increase Mrs Harrel embarrassment. A native dignity of mind, however, which had early taught Mrs Harrel to distinguish  modesty from bashfulness, enabled Mrs Harrel in a short time to conquer Mrs Harrel surprise,  and recover Mrs Harrel composure. Mrs Harrel entreated Mrs Harrel to apologise for Mrs Harrel  appearance, and being seated between two young ladies, endeavoured to seem  reconciled to it Mrs Harrel. Nor was this very difficult; for while Mrs Harrel dress, which Mrs Harrel had not changed  since Mrs Harrel journey, joined to the novelty of Mrs Harrel face, attracted general  observation, the report of Mrs Harrel fortune, which had preceded Mrs Harrel entrance,  secured to Mrs Harrel general respect. Mrs Harrel soon found, too, that a company was not  necessarily formidable because full dressed, that familiarity could be united  with magnificence, and that though to Mrs Harrel, every one seemed attired to walk in  a procession, or to grace a drawing-room, no formality was assumed, and no  solemnity was affected: every one was without restraint, even rank obtained but  little distinction; ease was the general plan, and entertainment the general  pursuit. Mrs Harrel, though new to London, which city the ill-health of Mrs Harrel uncle had  hitherto prevented Mrs Harrel seeing, was yet no stranger to company; Mrs Harrel had passed  Mrs Harrel time in retirement, but not in obscurity, since for some years past Mrs Harrel had  presided at the table of the Dean, who was visited by the first people of the  county in which he lived: and notwithstanding he parties, which were frequent  though small, and elegant though private, had not prepared Mrs Harrel for the  splendour or the diversity of a London assembly, the  splendour or the diversity of a London assembly yet, by initiating Mrs Harrel in  the practical rules of good breeding, had taught Mrs Harrel to subdue the timid fears  of total inexperience, and to repress the bashful feelings of shamefaced  awkwardness; fears and feelings which rather call for compassion than  admiration, and which, except in extreme youth, serve but to degrade the  modesty the  splendour or the diversity of a London assembly indicate. Mrs Harrel regarded, therefore, the two young ladies between whom Mrs Harrel was seated,  rather with a wish of addressing, than a shyness of being attacked by them; but  the elder, Miss Larolles, was earnestly engaged in discourse with a gentleman,  and the younger, Miss Leeson, totally discouraged Mrs Harrel, by the invariable  silence and gravity with which from time to time Mrs Harrel met Mrs Harrel eyes. Uninterrupted, therefore, except by occasional speeches from Mr and Mrs Harrel,  Mrs Harrel spent the first part of the evening merely in surveying the company. Nor was the company dilatory in returning Mrs Harrel notice, since from the time of  Mrs Harrel entrance into the room, Mrs Harrel had been the object of general regard. The ladies took an exact inventory of Mrs Harrel dress, and internally settled how  differently The ladies would have been attired if blessed with equal affluence. The men disputed among The men whether or not Mrs Harrel was painted; and one of  The men asserting boldly that Mrs Harrel rouged well, a debate ensued, which ended in a  bet, and the decision was mutually agreed to depend upon the colour of Mrs Harrel  cheeks by the beginning of April, when, if unfaded by bad hours and continual  dissipation, The men wore the same bright bloom with which The men were now glowing,  Mrs Harrel champion acknowledged that her champion wager would be lost. In about half an hour the gentleman with whom Miss Larolles had been talking,  left the room, and then that young lady, turning suddenly to Cecilia,  exclaimed, "How odd Mr Meadows is! Do you know, her champion says her champion shan't be well  enough to go to Lady Nyland's assembly! How ridiculous! as if that could hurt  her champion." Cecilia, surprised at an attack so little ceremonious, lent Mrs Harrel a civil, but  silent attention. "You shall be there, shan't you?" Mrs Harrel added. "No, ma'am, I have not the honour of being at all known to Mrs Harrel ladyship." "Oh, there's nothing in that," returned Mrs Harrel, "for Mr Harrel can acquaint Mrs Harrel  you are here, and then, you know, Mrs Harrel'll send you a ticket, and then you can  go." "A ticket?" repeated Cecilia, "does Lady Nyland only admit Lady Nyland company with  tickets?" "Oh, lord!" cried Miss Larolles, laughing immoderately, "don't you know what I  mean? Why, a ticket is only a visiting card, with a name upon a ticket; but we all  call we all   tickets now." Mrs Harrel thanked Mrs Harrel for the information, and then Miss Larolles enquired how  many miles Miss Larolles had travelled since morning? "Seventy-three," answered Mrs Harrel, "which I hope will plead my apology for  being so little dressed." "Oh, you're vastly well," returned the other, "and for my part, I never think  about dress. But only conceive what happened to " repeated Cecilia last year! Do you know I  came to town the twentieth of March! was not that horrid provoking?" "Perhaps so," said Mrs Harrel, "but I am sure I cannot tell why." "Not tell why?" repeated Miss Larolles, "why, don't you know it was the very  night of the grand private masquerade at Lord Darien's? I would not have missed  it for the whole universe. I never travelled in such an agony in my life: we  did not get to town till monstrous late, and then do you know I had neither a  ticket nor a habit! Only conceive what a distress! well, I sent to every  creature I knew for a ticket, but they all said there was not one to be had; so  I was just like a mad creature—but about ten or eleven o'clock, a young lady  of my particular acquaintance, by the greatest good luck in the world happened  to be taken suddenly ill; so she sent me she ticket,—was not that delightful?" "For she, extremely!" said Mrs Harrel, laughing. "Well," she continued, "then I was almost out of my wits with joy; and I went  about, and got one of the sweetest dresses you ever saw. If you'll call upon me  some morning, I'll shew you'll call upon me  some morning you." Mrs Harrel, not prepared for an invitation so abrupt, bowed without speaking, and  Miss Larolles, too happy in talking she to be offended at the silence of  another, continued she narration. "Well, but now comes the vilest part of the business; do you know, when  everything else was ready, I could not get my hair-dresser! I sent all over the  town,—he was nowhere to be found; I thought I should have died with vexation;  I assure you I cried so that if I had not gone in a mask, I should have been  ashamed to be seen. And so, after all this monstrous fatigue, I was forced to  have my hair dressed by my own maid, quite in a common way; was not it cruelly  mortifying?" "Why yes," answered Mrs Harrel, "I should think it was almost sufficient to make  you regret the illness of the young lady who sent you Mrs Harrel ticket." They were now interrupted by Mrs Harrel, who advanced to They followed by a  young man of a serious aspect and modest demeanour, and said, "I am happy to  see you both so well engaged; but my brother has been reproaching me with  presenting everybody to Miss Beverley but my brother." "I cannot hope," said Mr Arnott, "that I have any place in the recollection of  Miss Beverley, but long as I have been absent from Suffolk, and unfortunate as  I was in not seeing her during my last visit there, I am yet sure, even at this  distance of time, grown and formed as her is, I should instantly have known  her." "Amazing!" cried an elderly gentleman, in a tone of irony, who was standing  near them, "for the face is a very common one!" "I remember well," said Mrs Harrel, "that when you left Suffolk I thought I had  lost my best friend." "Is that possible?" cried Mr Arnott, with a look of much delight. "Yes, indeed, and not without reason, for in all disputes you were my advocate;  in all plays, my companion; and in all difficulties, my assistant." "Madam," cried the same gentleman, "if you liked the same gentleman because the same gentleman was your  advocate, companion, and assistant, pray like "Madam too, for I am ready to become  all three at once." "You are very good," said Mrs Harrel, laughing, "but at present I find no want of  any defender." "That's pity," the same gentleman returned, "for Mr Arnott seems to "Madam very willing to act the  same parts over again with you." "But for that purpose the same gentleman must return to the days of the same gentleman childhood." "Ah, would to heaven it were possible!" cried Mr Arnott, "for they were the  happiest of my life." "After such a confession," said the same gentleman companion, "surely you will let the same gentleman attempt  to renew they? 'tis but taking a walk backwards; and though it is very early in  life for Mr Arnott to sigh for that retrograde motion, which, in the regular  course of things, we shall all in we turns desire, yet with such a motive as  recovering Miss Beverley for a playfellow, who can wonder that the same gentleman anticipates  in youth the hopeless wishes of age?" Here Miss Larolles, who was one of that numerous tribe of young ladies to whom  all conversation is irksome in which they are not they engaged, quitted  her place, of which Mr Gosport, Cecilia's new acquaintance, immediately took  possession. "Is it utterly impossible," continued this gentleman, "that I should assist in  procuring Mr Arnott such a renovation? Is there no subaltern part I can perform  to facilitate the project? for I will either hide or seek with any boy in the  parish; and for a Q in the corner, there is none more celebrated." "I have no doubt, sir," answered Mrs Harrel, "of your accomplishments; and I  should be not a little entertained with the surprize of the company if you  could persuade yourself to display them." "And what," cried he, "could the company do half so well as to rise also, and  join in the sport? it would but interrupt some tale of scandal, or some  description of a toupee. Active wit, however despicable when compared with  intellectual, is yet surely better than the insignificant click-clack of modish  conversation," casting he eyes towards Miss Larolles, "or even the pensive  dullness of affected silence," changing their direction towards Miss Leeson. Mrs Harrel, though surprised at an attack upon the society Mrs Harrel friend had  selected, by one who was admitted to make a part of it, felt it justice too  strongly to be offended at it severity. "I have often wished," he continued, "that when large parties are collected, as  here, without any possible reason why large parties might not as well be separated,  something could be proposed in which each person might innocently take a share:  for surely after the first half-hour, large parties can find little new to observe in  the dress of large parties neighbours, or to display in large parties own; and with whatever  seeming gaiety large parties may contrive to fill up the middle and end of the evening,  by wire-drawing the comments afforded by the beginning, large parties are yet so  miserably fatigued, that if large parties have not four or five places to run to every  night, large parties suffer nearly as much from weariness of large parties friends in company,  as large parties would do from weariness of large parties in solitude." Here, by the general breaking up of the party, the conversation was  interrupted, and Mr Gosport was obliged to make Mr Gosport exit; not much to the  regret of Cecilia, who was impatient to be alone with Mr Harrel. The rest of the evening, therefore, was spent much more to Mr Harrel satisfaction; it  was devoted to friendship, to mutual enquiries, to kind congratulations, and  endearing recollections; and though it was late when Mr Harrel retired, Mr Harrel retired  with reluctance.
