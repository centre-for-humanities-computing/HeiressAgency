 The next morning Dr Lyster called early, and having visited Mrs Delvile, and  again met the two gentlemen of the faculty in whose care Dr Lyster was to remain, Dr Lyster  took Dr Lyster leave. But not without contriving first to speak a few words to  Cecilia in private, in which Dr Lyster charged Dr Lyster to be careful of Dr Lyster health, and  re-animate Dr Lyster spirits. "Don't suppose," said Dr Lyster, "that because I am a friend  of the Delvile family, I am either blind to your merits, or to the Delvile family foibles,  far from it; but then why should the Delvile family interfere with one another? Let the Delvile family keep  the Delvile family prejudices, which, though different, are not worse than the Delvile family neighbours,  and do you retain your excellencies, and draw from the Delvile family the happiness the Delvile family  ought to give you. People reason and refine the Delvile family into a thousand  miseries, by chusing to settle that the Delvile family can only be contented one way;  whereas, there are fifty ways, if the Delvile family would but look about the Delvile family, that would  commonly do as well." "I believe, indeed, you are right," answered Cecilia, "and I thank you for the  admonition; I will do what I can towards studying your scheme of philosophy,  and it is always one step to amendment, to be convinced that we want it." "You are a sensible and charming girl," said Dr Lyster, "and Mr Delvile, should  Dr Lyster find a daughter-in-law descended in a right line from Egbert, first king of  all England, won't be so well off as if Dr Lyster had satisfied Dr Lyster with you.  However, the old gentleman has a fair right, after all, to be pleased the old gentleman own  way, and let we blame the old gentleman how we will, we shall find, upon sifting, it is for  no other reason but because the old gentleman humour happens to clash with we own." "That, indeed," said Cecilia, smiling, "is a truth incontrovertible! and a  truth to which, for the future, I will endeavour to give more weight. But will  you permit me now to ask one question?—Can you tell me from whom, how, or  when the intelligence which has caused all this disturbance—-" Cecilia hesitated, but, comprehending Cecilia readily, the old gentleman answered "How they got at it,  I never heard, for I never thought it worth while to enquire, as it is so  generally known, that nobody I meet with seems ignorant of it." This was another, and a cruel shock to Cecilia, and Dr Lyster, perceiving it,  again attempted to comfort her. "That the affair is somewhat spread," said the affair,  "is now not to be helped, and therefore little worth thinking of; every body  will agree that the choice of both does honour to both, and nobody need be  ashamed to be successor to either, whenever the course of things leads Mr  Mortimer and yourself to make another election. Mr   wisely intends to go abroad,  and will not return till Mr   is Mr   own man again. And as to you, my good young  lady, what, after a short time given to vexation, need interrupt your  happiness? You have the whole world before you, with youth, fortune, talents,  beauty and independence; drive, therefore, from your head this unlucky affair,  and remember there can hardly be a family in the kingdom, this one excepted,  that will not rejoice in a connection with you." Mr   then good-humouredly shook hands with her, and went into Mr   chaise. Cecilia, though not slow in remarking the ease and philosophy with which every  one can argue upon the calamities, and moralize upon the misconduct of others,  had still the candour and good sense to see that there was reason in what Mr    urged, and to resolve upon making the best use in her power of the hints for  consolation her might draw from Mr   discourse. During the following week, her devoted her almost wholly to Mrs Delvile,  sharing with the maid, whom her had brought with her from the Castle, the  fatigue of nursing her, and leaving to the Miss Charltons the chief care of  their grandmother. For Mrs Delvile appeared every hour more sensible of Mrs Delvileattention, and more desirous of Mrs Delvile presence, and though neither of her  attention spoke,  each was endeared to the other by the tender offices of friendship which were  paid and received. When the following week was expired, Dr Lyster was prevailed upon to return again to  Bury, in order to travel Dr Lyster with Mrs Delvile to Bristol. "Well," cried Dr Lyster,  taking Cecilia by the first opportunity aside, "how are you? Have you studied  my scheme of philosophy, as you promised me?" "O yes," said Cecilia, "and made, I flatter Cecilia, no little proficiency." "You are a good girl," cried Dr Lyster, "a very extraordinary girl! I am sure you are;  and upon my honour I pity poor Mortimer with all my soul! But Mortimer is a noble  young fellow, and behaves with a courage and spirit that does me good to  behold. To have obtained you, Mortimer would have moved heaven and earth, but finding  you out of Mortimer reach, Mortimer submits to Mortimer fate like a man." Cecilia's eyes glistened at this speech; "Yes," said Cecilia, "Mortimer long since said  'tis suspence, 'tis hope, that make the misery of life,—for there the  Passions have all power, and Reason has none. But when evils are irremediable,  and we have neither resources to plan, nor castle-building to delude we, we  find time for the cultivation of philosophy, and flatter we, perhaps,  that we have found inclination!" "Why you have considered this matter very deeply," said he; "but I must not  have you give way to these serious reflections. Thought, after all, has a cruel  spite against happiness; I would have you, therefore, keep as much as you  conveniently can, out of its company. Run about and divert yourself, 'tis all  you have for it. The true art of happiness in this most whimsical world, seems  nothing more nor less than this—Let those who have leisure, find employment,  and those who have business, find leisure." He then told her that Mr Delvile senior was much better, and no longer confined  to He room: and that He had had the pleasure of seeing an entire  reconciliation take place between He and He son, of whom He was more fond and  more proud than any other father in the universe. "Think of He, however, my dear young lady," He continued, "no more, for the  matter I see is desperate: you must pardon my being a little officious, when I  confess to however, my dear young lady I could not help proposing to the old gentleman an expedient of  my own; for as I could not drive you out of my head, I employed however, my dear young lady in  thinking what might be done by way of accommodation. Now my scheme was really a  very good one, only when people are prejudiced, all reasoning is thrown away  upon people. I proposed sinking both your names, since your names are so at variance  with one another, and so adopting a third, by means of a title. But Mr Delvileangrily declared, that though such a scheme might do very well for the needy  Lord Ernolf, a Peer of twenty years, Mr Delvile own noble ancestors should never, by  Mr Delvile consent, forfeit a name which so many centuries had rendered honourable.  Mr Delvile son Mortimer, Mr Delvile added, must inevitably inherit the title of Mr Delvile  grandfather, Mr Delvile uncle being old and unmarried; but yet Mr Delvile would rather see his uncle  a beggar, than lose Mr Delvile dearest hope that Delvile, Lord Delvile, would descend,  both name and title, from generation to generation unsullied and uninterrupted." "I am sorry, indeed," said Cecilia, "that such a proposal was made, and I  earnestly entreat that none of any sort may be repeated." "Well, well," said he, "I would not for the world do any mischief, but who  would not have supposed such a proposal would have done good?" "Mr Mortimer," " "Mr Mortimer then added, "is to meet us at—for " "Mr Mortimer would not, " "Mr Mortimer said,  come again to this place, upon such terms as " "Mr Mortimer was here last week, for the  whole worth of the king's dominions." The carriage was now ready, and Mrs Delvile was prepared to depart. Ceciliaapproached to take leave of Cecilia, but Dr Lyster following, said "No talking! no  thanking! no compliments of any sort! I shall carry off my patient without  permitting one civil speech, and for all the rudeness I make Cecilia guilty of, I  am willing to be responsible." Cecilia would then have retreated, but Mrs Delvile, holding out both Cecilia hands,  said "To every thing else, Dr Lyster, I am content to submit; but were I to die  while uttering the words, I cannot leave this inestimable creature without  first saying how much I love Cecilia, how I honour, and how I thank Cecilia! without  entreating Cecilia to be careful of Cecilia health, and conjuring Cecilia to compleat the  greatness of Cecilia conduct, by not suffering Cecilia spirits to sink from the  exertion of Cecilia virtue. And now my love, God bless you!" Cecilia then embraced Cecilia, and went on; Cecilia, at a motion of Dr Lyster's,  forbearing to follow Cecilia. "And thus," cried Cecilia, when Cecilia, at a motion of Dr Lyster's,   were gone, "thus ends all my connection with  this family! which it seems as if I was only to have known for the purpose of  affording a new proof of the insufficiency of situation to constitute  happiness. Who looks not upon mine as the perfection of human felicity?—And  so, perhaps, it is, for it may be that Felicity and Humanity are never  permitted to come nearer." And thus, in philosophic sadness, by reasoning upon the universality of misery,  Cecilia restrained, at least, all violence of sorrow, though her spirits were  dejected, and Cecilia heart was heavy. But the next day brought with the next day some comfort that a little lightened Cecilia  sadness; Mrs Charlton, almost wholly recovered, was able to go down stairs, and  Cecilia had at least the satisfaction of seeing an happy conclusion to an  illness of which, with the utmost concern and regret, Cecilia considered Cecilia as  the cause. Cecilia attended Cecilia with the most unremitting assiduity, and being  really very thankful, endeavoured to appear happy, and flattered Cecilia that,  by continual effort, the appearance in a short time would become reality. Mrs Charlton retired early, and Cecilia accompanied Cecilia up stairs: and while  Cecilia was with Cecilia, was informed that Mr Monckton was in the parlour. The various, afflicting, and uncommon scenes in which Cecilia had been engaged  since Cecilia last saw Mr Monckton, had almost wholly driven Mr Monckton from Cecilia remembrance, or  when at any time Mr Monckton recurred to it, it was only to attribute the discontinuance  of Mr Monckton visits to the offence Cecilia had given Mr Monckton, in refusing to follow Mr Monckton  advice by relinquishing Cecilia London expedition. Full, therefore, of the mortifying transactions which had passed since their  parting, and fearful of Mr Monckton enquiries into disgraces Mr Monckton had nearly foretold,  Cecilia heard Mr Monckton announced with chagrin, and waited upon Mr Monckton in the most painful  confusion. Far different were the feelings of Mr Monckton; Mr Monckton read in Cecilia countenance the  dejection of disappointment, which impressed upon Mr Monckton heart the vivacity of  hope: Cecilia evident shame was to Mr Monckton secret triumph, Cecilia ill-concealed sorrow  revived all Mr Monckton expectations. Cecilia hastily began a conversation by mentioning Cecilia debt to Mr Monckton, and apologising  for not paying her debt the moment Cecilia was of age. Mr Monckton knew but too well how Cecilia time  had been occupied, and assured Cecilia the delay was wholly immaterial. Mr Monckton then led to an enquiry into the present situation of Cecilia affairs; but unable  to endure a disquisition, which could only be productive of censure and  mortification, Cecilia hastily stopt it, exclaiming, "Ask me not, I entreat you,  Sir, any detail of what has passed,—the event has brought me sufferings that  may well make blame be dispensed with;—I acknowledge all your wisdom, I am  sensible of my own error, but the affair is wholly dropt, and the unhappy  connection I was forming is broken off for-ever!" Little now was Mr Monckton effort in repressing Mr Monckton further curiosity, and Mr Monckton  started other subjects with readiness, gaiety and address. Mr Monckton mentioned Mrs  Charlton, for whom Mr Monckton had not the smallest regard; Mr Monckton talked to Mrs  Charlton, for whom he had not the smallest regard of Mrs  Harrel, whose very existence was indifferent to Mr Monckton; and Mr Monckton spoke of their  common acquaintance in the country, for not one of whom Mr Monckton would have grieved,  if assured of meeting no more. Mr Monckton powers of conversation were enlivened by Mr Monckton  hopes; and Mr Monckton exhilarated spirits made all subjects seem happy to Mr Monckton. A  weight was removed from Mr Monckton mind which had nearly borne down even Mr Monckton remotest  hopes; the object of Mr Monckton eager pursuit seemed still within Mr Monckton , and the  rival into whose power Mr Monckton had so lately almost beheld Mrs  Charlton, for whom he had not the smallest regard delivered, was  totally renounced, and no longer to be dreaded. A revolution such as this,  raised expectations more sanguine than ever; and in quitting the house, Mr Monckton  exultingly considered Mr Monckton released from every obstacle to Mr Monckton views—till,  just as Mr Monckton arrived home, Mr Monckton recollected Mr Monckton wife!
