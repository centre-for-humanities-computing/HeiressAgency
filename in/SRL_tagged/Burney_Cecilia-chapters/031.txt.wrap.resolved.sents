 The day following this happy intellectual arrangement, Cecilia was visited by  Mr Monckton.
That gentleman, who had enquired for Cecilia immediately after the  Harrels went to their villa, and who had flattered the  Harrels with reaping much  advantage from their absence, by frequent meetings and confidential discourses,  suffered the severest mortification when the  Harrels found that Cecilia stay in town  rendered Cecilia not the less inaccessible to the  Harrels, since the  Harrels had no personal  acquaintance with the Delviles, and could not venture to present the  Harrels at  their house.
the  Harrels was now received by Cecilia with more than usual pleasure; the time had seemed  long to Cecilia since Cecilia had conversed with the  Harrels, and Cecilia was eager to ask the  Harrels  counsel and assistance in Cecilia affairs.
Cecilia related to the  Harrels the motives which had  induced Cecilia to go to St James'-square, and the incorrigible obstinacy with  which Mr Harrel still continued to encourage the addresses of Sir Robert  Floyer; Cecilia earnestly entreated the  Harrels to become Cecilia agent in a business to which  Cecilia was unequal, by expostulating in Cecilia cause with Mr Harrel, and by calling  upon Sir Robert himself to insist upon Sir Robert himself foregoing Sir Robert himself unauthorised  pretensions.
Mr Monckton listened eagerly to Cecilia account and request, and when Cecilia had  finished, assured Cecilia Mr Monckton would deliberate upon each circumstance of the affair,  and then maturely weigh every method Mr Monckton could devise, to extricate Cecilia from an  embarrassment which now grew far too serious to be safely neglected.
"I will not, however," continued Mr Monckton, "either act or give my opinion without  further enquiry, as I am confident there is a mystery in this business which  lies deeper than we can at present fathom.
Mr Harrel has doubtless purposes of  Mr Harrel own to answer by this pretended zeal for Sir Robert  ; nor is it difficult to  conjecture what zeal may be.
Friendship, in a man of Mr Harrel light cast, is a mere  cover, a mere name, to conceal a connection which has its basis solely in the  licentious convenience of borrowing money, going to the same gaming house, and  mutually communicating and boasting the same gaming house mutual vices and intrigues, while,  all the time, the same gaming house regard for each other is equally hollow with each other regard  for truth and integrity."
Mr Harrel then cautioned Cecilia to be extremely careful with respect to any money  transactions with Mr Harrel, whose splendid extravagance Mr Harrel assured Cecilia was  universally known to exceed Mr Harrel fortune.
The countenance of Cecilia during this exhortation was testimony sufficient to  the penetrating eyes of Mr Monckton that Mr Monckton advice came not too soon: a  suspicion of the real state of the case speedily occurred to Mr Harrel, and Mr Harrel  questioned Cecilia minutely upon the subject.
Cecilia endeavoured to avoid making Mr Harrel  any answer, but Mr Harrel discernment was too keen for Cecilia inartificial evasion, and  Mr Harrel very soon gathered all the particulars of Cecilia transactions with Mr Harrel.
Mr Harrel was less alarmed at the sum Cecilia had lent Mr Harrel, which was rather within Mr Harrel  expectations, than at the method Cecilia had been induced to take to procure it.
Mr Harrel  represented to Cecilia in the strongest manner the danger of imposition, nay of  ruin, from the extortions and the craft of money-lenders; and Mr Harrel charged Cecilia  upon no consideration to be tempted or persuaded again to have recourse to such  perilous expedients.
Cecilia promised the most attentive observance of Mr Harrel advice: and then told Mr Harrel the  acquaintance Cecilia had made with Miss Belfield, and Cecilia sorrow for the situation  of Cecilia brother; though, satisfied for the present with the plan of young  Delvile, Cecilia now gave up Cecilia design of soliciting Mr Harrel counsel.
In the midst of this conversation, a note was delivered to Cecilia from Mr Delvile  senior, acquainting Cecilia with Mr Harrel return to town, and begging the favour of Cecilia  to call in St James's-square the next morning, as Mr Harrel wished to speak to Cecilia  upon some business of importance.
The eager manner in which Cecilia accepted this invitation, and Cecilia repeated  and earnest exclamation of wonder at what Mr Delvile   could have to say, past  not unnoticed by Mr Monckton; Mr Delvile   instantly turned the discourse from the  Belfields, the Harrels, and the Baronet, to enquire how Mr Monckton had spent Mr Monckton time  during Mr Monckton visit in St James's-square, and what was Mr Monckton opinion of the family  after Mr Monckton late opportunities of intimacy?
Cecilia answered that Cecilia had yet seen nothing more of Mr Delvile, who had been  absent the whole time, but with equal readiness and pleasure Cecilia replied to all  Mr Delvile   questions concerning Mr Delvile   lady, expatiating with warmth and fervour upon Cecilia  many rare and estimable qualities.
But when the same interrogatories were transferred to the son, Cecilia spoke no  longer with the same ease, nor with Cecilia usual promptitude of sincerity; Cecilia was  embarrassed, Cecilia answers were short, and Cecilia endeavoured to hasten from the  subject.
Mr Monckton remarked this change with the most apprehensive quickness, but,  forcing a smile, "Have you yet," Mr Monckton said, "observed the family compact in which  those people are bound to besiege you, and draw you into those people snares?"
"No, indeed," cried Cecilia, much hurt by the question, "I am sure no such  compact has been formed; and I am sure, too, that if you knew those people better, you  would yourself be the first to admire and do those people justice."
"My dear Miss Beverley," cried My dear Miss Beverley, "I know those people already; I do not, indeed,  visit those people, but I am perfectly acquainted with those people characters, which have  been drawn to My dear Miss Beverley by those who are most closely connected with those people, and who  have had opportunities of inspection which I hope will never fall to your  share, since I am satisfied the trial would pain, though the proof would  convince you."
"What then have you heard of those people?"
cried Cecilia, with much earnestness: "It  is, at least, not possible any ill can be said of Mrs Delvile."
"I beg your pardon," returned Mrs Delvile.
"Mrs Delvile is not nearer perfection than  the rest of Mrs Delvile family, Mrs Delvile has only more art in disguising Mrs Delvile foibles;  because, tho' Mrs Delvile is the daughter of pride, Mrs Delvile is the slave of interest."
"I see you have been greatly misinformed," said Cecilia warmly; "Mrs Delvile is  the noblest of women!
Cecilia may, indeed, from Cecilia very exaltation, have enemies,  but enemies are the enemies of envy, not of resentment, enemies raised by superior  merit, not excited by injury or provocation!"
"You will know Cecilia better hereafter;" said Mr Monckton calmly, "I only hope  your knowledge will not be purchased by the sacrifice of your happiness."
"And what knowledge of Cecilia, Sir," cried Cecilia, starting, "can have power to  put my happiness in any danger?"
"I will tell you," answered Sir, "with all the openness you have a claim to from  my regard, and then leave to time to shew if I am mistaken.
The Delvile family,  notwithstanding its ostentatious magnificence, I can solemnly assure you, is  poor in every branch, alike lineal and collateral."
"But is it therefore the less estimable?"
"Yes, because the more rapacious.
And while the more rapacious count on each side Dukes,  Earls and Barons in the more rapacious genealogy, the very wealth with which, through your  means, the more rapacious project the support of the more rapacious insolence, and which the more rapacious will grasp  with all the greediness of avarice, the more rapacious will think honoured by being employed  in the more rapacious service, while the instrument, all amiable as she is, by which the more rapacious  attain it, will be constantly held down as the disgrace of the more rapacious alliance."
Cecilia, stung to the soul by this speech, rose from Cecilia chair, unwilling to  answer this speech, yet unable to conceal how much this speech shocked Cecilia.
Mr Monckton,  perceiving Cecilia emotion, followed Cecilia, and taking Cecilia hand, said, "I would not  give this warning to one I thought too weak to profit from this warning; but as I am well  informed of the use that is meant to be made of your fortune, and the abuse  that will follow of yourself, I think it right to prepare you for their  artifices, which merely to point out, may render abortive."
Cecilia, too much disturbed to thank him, drew back her hand, and continued  silent.
Mr Monckton, reading through Cecilia displeasure the state of Cecilia  affections, saw with terror the greatness of the danger which threatened him.
him found, however, that the present was no time for enforcing objections, and  perceiving him had already gone too far, though him was by no means disposed to  recant, him thought it most prudent to retreat, and let Cecilia meditate upon him  exhortation while it impression was yet strong in Cecilia mind.
him would now, therefore, have taken leave; but Cecilia, endeavouring to  recollect Cecilia, and fully persuaded that however him had shocked Cecilia, him had  only Cecilia interest in view, stopt him, saying, "You think me, perhaps,  ungrateful, but believe me I am not; I must, however, acknowledge that your  censure of Mrs Delvile hurts me extremely.
Indeed I cannot doubt Mrs Delvile  worthiness, I must still, therefore, plead for Mrs Delvile, and I hope the time may  come when you will allow I have not pleaded unjustly."
"Justly or unjustly," answered Mr Monckton, "I am at least sure you can never  plead vainly.
I give up, therefore, to your opinion my attack of Mrs Delvile,  and am willing from your commendations to suppose Mrs Delvile the best of the race.
Nay, I will even own that perhaps Mrs Delvile himself, as well as Mrs Delvile lady,  might pass through life and give but little offence, had perhaps Mr Delvile himself, as well as his lady,  might pass through life and give but little offence only themselves  to think of, and no son to stimulate perhaps Mr Delvile himself, as well as his lady,  might pass through life and give but little offence arrogance."
"Is the son, then," said Cecilia faintly, "so much the most culpable?"
"The son, I believe," answered the son, "is at least the chief incentive to  insolence and ostentation in the parents, since it is for the son sake they covet  with such avidity honours and riches, since they plume they upon  regarding the son as the support of they name and, family, and since they pride  in the son even surpasses they pride in they lineage and they."
"Ah!"
thought Cecilia, "and of such a son who could help being proud!"
"they purpose, therefore," the son continued, "is to, secure through the son means your  fortune, which they will no sooner obtain, than, to my certain knowledge, they  mean instantly, and most unmercifully, to employ it in repairing all they  dilapidated estates."
And then he quitted the subject; and, with that guarded warmth which  accompanied all he expressions, told the subject he would carefully watch for the subject  honour and welfare, and, repeating he promise of endeavouring to discover the  tie by which Mr Harrel seemed bound to the Baronet, Mr Harrel left the subject—a prey  Mr Harrel to an anxiety yet more severe than that with which Mr Harrel had filled the subject!
Mr Harrel now saw all Mr Harrel long cherished hopes in danger of final destruction, and  suddenly cast upon the brink of a precipice, where, while Mr Harrel struggled to  protect them from falling, Mr Harrel eyes were dazzled by beholding them totter.
Mean while Cecilia, disturbed from the calm of soft serenity to which Cecilia had  yielded every avenue of the soul, now looked forward with distrust and  uneasiness, even to the completion of the views which but a few minutes before  had comprised all Cecilia notions of felicity.
The alliance which so lately had  seemed wholly unexceptionable, now appeared teeming with objections, and  threatening with difficulties.
The representations of Mr Monckton had cruelly  mortified Cecilia; well acquainted with Mr Monckton knowledge of the world, and wholly  unsuspicious of Mr Monckton selfish motives, Cecilia gave to Mr Monckton assertions involuntary  credit, and even while Cecilia attempted to combat involuntary  credit, involuntary  credit made upon Cecilia mind an  impression scarce ever to be erased.
Full, therefore, of doubt and inquietude, Cecilia passed the night in discomfort  and irresolution, now determining to give way to Cecilia feelings, and now to be  wholly governed by the counsel of Mr Monckton.
