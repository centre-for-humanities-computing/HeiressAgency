may time, while it moulders their frail relicks to  dust, commit to tradition the record of their goodness; and Oh, may their  orphan-descendant be influenced through life by the remembrance of their  purity, and be solaced in death, that by her it was unsullied!"
Such was the secret prayer with which the only survivor of the Beverley family  quitted the abode of the Beverley family   youth, and residence of the Beverley family   forefathers; while tears  of recollecting sorrow filled the Beverley family   eyes, and obstructed the last view of the Beverley family    native town which had excited them.
Cecilia, this fair traveller, had lately entered into the one-and-twentieth  year of Cecilia age.
Cecilia ancestors had been rich farmers in the county of Suffolk,  though Cecilia father, in whom a spirit of elegance had supplanted the rapacity of  wealth, had spent his time as a private country gentleman, satisfied, without  increasing his store, to live upon what his inherited from the labours of his  predecessors.
Cecilia had lost his in Cecilia early youth, and Cecilia mother had not long  survived his.
They had bequeathed to Cecilia 10,000 pounds, and consigned Cecilia to  the care of the Dean of ———, Cecilia uncle.
With this gentleman, in whom, by  various contingencies, the accumulated possessions of a rising and prosperous  family were centred, Cecilia had passed the last four years of Cecilia life; and a few  weeks only had yet elapsed since his death, which, by depriving Cecilia of Cecilia last  relation, made Cecilia heiress to an estate of 3000 pounds per annum; with no other  restriction than that of annexing Cecilia name, if Cecilia married, to the disposal of  Cecilia hand and Cecilia riches.
But though thus largely indebted to fortune, to nature Cecilia had yet greater  obligations: Cecilia form was elegant, Cecilia heart was liberal; Cecilia countenance  announced the intelligence of Cecilia mind, Cecilia complexion varied with every  emotion of Cecilia soul, and Cecilia eyes, the heralds of Cecilia speech, now beamed with  understanding and now glistened with sensibility.
For the short period of Cecilia minority, the management of Cecilia fortune and the  care of Cecilia person, had by the Dean been entrusted to three guardians, among  whom Cecilia own choice was to settle Cecilia residence: but Cecilia mind, saddened by the  loss of all Cecilia natural friends, coveted to regain its serenity in the  quietness of the country, and in the bosom of an aged and maternal counsellor,  whom Cecilia loved as Cecilia mother, and to whom Cecilia had been known from Cecilia childhood.
The Deanery, indeed, Cecilia was obliged to relinquish, a long repining expectant  being eager, by entering it, to bequeath to another the anxiety and suspense he  had suffered he; though probably without much impatience to shorten the anxiety and suspense he  had suffered himself  duration in favour of the next successor; but the house of Mrs Charlton, Cecilia  benevolent friend, was open for Cecilia reception, and the alleviating tenderness  of Cecilia conversation took from Cecilia all wish of changing it.
Here Cecilia had dwelt since the interment of Cecilia uncle; and here, from the  affectionate gratitude of Cecilia disposition, Cecilia had perhaps been content to  dwell till Cecilia own, had not Cecilia guardians interfered to remove Cecilia.
Reluctantly Cecilia complied; Cecilia quitted Cecilia early companions, the friend Cecilia most  revered, and the spot which contained the relicks of all Cecilia had yet lived to  lament; and, accompanied by one of her guardians, and attended by two servants,  Cecilia began Cecilia journey from Bury to London.
Mr Harrel.
Whatever good-nature could dictate or politeness suggest to dispel Cecilia  melancholy, Mr Harrel failed not to urge; and Cecilia, in whose disposition  sweetness was tempered with dignity, and gentleness with fortitude, suffered  not Mr Harrel kind offices to seem ineffectual; Cecilia kissed Cecilia hand at the last  glimpse a friendly hill afforded of Cecilia native town, and made an effort to  forget the regret with which Cecilia lost sight of it.
Cecilia revived Cecilia spirits by  plans of future happiness, dwelt upon the delight with which Cecilia should meet  Cecilia young friend, and, by accepting his consolation, amply rewarded his trouble.
Cecilia serenity, however, had yet another, though milder trial to undergo, since  another friend was yet to be met, and another farewell was yet to be taken.
At the distance of seven miles from Bury resided Mr Monckton, the richest and  most powerful man in that neighbourhood, at whose house Cecilia and Cecilia  guardian were invited to breakfast in Cecilia and her  guardian journey.
Mr Monckton, who was the younger son of a noble family, was a man of parts,  information and sagacity; to great native strength of mind a man of parts,  information and sagacity added a  penetrating knowledge of the world, and to faculties the most skilful of  investigating the character of every other, a dissimulation the most profound  in concealing a man of parts,  information and sagacity own.
In the bloom of a man of parts,  information and sagacity youth, impatient for wealth and  ambitious of power, a man of parts,  information and sagacity had tied a man of parts,  information and sagacity to a rich dowager of quality, whose  age, though sixty-seven, was but among the smaller species of her evil  properties, her disposition being far more repulsive than her wrinkles.
An  inequality of years so considerable, had led a man of parts,  information and sagacity to expect that the fortune a man of parts,  information and sagacity  had thus acquired, would speedily be released from the burthen with which it  was at present incumbered; but a man of parts,  information and sagacity expectations proved as vain as they were  mercenary, and a man of parts,  information and sagacity lady was not more the dupe of a man of parts,  information and sagacity protestations than a man of parts,  information and sagacity was  a man of parts,  information and sagacity of a man of parts,  information and sagacity own purposes.
Ten years a man of parts,  information and sagacity had been married to his lady, yet his lady  health was good, and his lady faculties were unimpaired; eagerly a man of parts,  information and sagacity had watched for  his lady dissolution, yet a man of parts,  information and sagacity eagerness had injured no health but a man of parts,  information and sagacity own!
So  short-sighted is selfish cunning, that in aiming no further than at the  gratification of the present moment, it obscures the evils of the future, while  it impedes the perception of integrity and honour.
a man of parts,  information and sagacity ardour, however, to attain the blessed period of returning liberty,  deprived a man of parts,  information and sagacity neither of spirit nor inclination for intermediate enjoyment; a man of parts,  information and sagacity  knew the world too well to incur he   censure by ill-treating the woman to whom  a man of parts,  information and sagacity was indebted for the rank a man of parts,  information and sagacity held in it; a man of parts,  information and sagacity saw his lady, indeed, but seldom, yet  a man of parts,  information and sagacity had the decency, alike in avoiding as in meeting his lady, to shew no abatement  of civility and good breeding: but, having thus sacrificed to ambition all  possibility of happiness in domestic life, a man of parts,  information and sagacity turned a man of parts,  information and sagacity thoughts to those  other methods of procuring it, which a man of parts,  information and sagacity had so dearly purchased the power of  essaying.
The resources of pleasure to the possessors of wealth are only to be cut off by  the satiety of which The resources of pleasure to the possessors of wealth are productive: a satiety which the vigorous mind of  Mr Monckton had not yet suffered Mr Monckton to experience; Mr Monckton time, therefore, was  either devoted to the expensive amusements of the metropolis, or spent in the country among the gayest of its diversions.
The little knowledge of fashionable manners and of the characters of the times  of which Cecilia was yet mistress, Cecilia had gathered at the house of this  gentleman, with whom the Dean Cecilia uncle had been intimately connected: for as  the Dean her uncle preserved to the world the same appearance of decency the Dean her uncle supported to the Dean her uncle  wife, the Dean her uncle was everywhere well received, and being but partially known, was  extremely respected: the world, with its wonted facility, repaying the Dean her uncle  circumspect attention to its laws, by silencing the voice of censure, guarding  the Dean her uncle character from impeachment, and the Dean her uncle name from reproach.
Cecilia had been known to the Dean her uncle half Cecilia life; Cecilia had been caressed in the Dean her uncle house  as a beautiful child, and Cecilia presence was now solicited there as an amiable  acquaintance.
Cecilia visits, indeed, had by no means been frequent, as the  ill-humour of Mr Monckton had rendered no means painful to Mr Monckton; yet the  opportunities no means had afforded Mr Monckton of mixing with people of fashion, had  served to prepare Mr Monckton for the new scenes in which Mr Monckton was soon to be a  performer.
Mr Monckton, in return, had always been a welcome guest at The Deanery; Mr Monckton  conversation was to Cecilia a never-failing source of information, as Mr Monckton  knowledge of life and manners enabled Mr Monckton to start those subjects of which Cecilia  was most ignorant; and Cecilia mind, copious for the admission and intelligent for  the arrangement of knowledge, received all new ideas with avidity.
Pleasure given in society, like money lent in usury, returns with interest to  those who dispense it: and the discourse of Mr Monckton conferred not a greater  favour upon Cecilia than Mr Monckton attention to it repaid.
And thus, the speaker and  the hearer being mutually gratified, the speaker and  the hearer had always met with complacency, and  commonly parted with regret.
This reciprocation of pleasure had, however, produced different effects upon  the speaker and  the hearer minds; the ideas of Cecilia were enlarged, while the reflections of Mr  Mr Monckton were embittered.
Mr Monckton here saw an object who to all the advantages of  that wealth Mr Monckton had so highly prized, added youth, beauty, and intelligence;  though much her senior, Mr Monckton was by no means of an age to render Mr Monckton addressing  her an impropriety, and the entertainment her received from Mr Monckton conversation,  persuaded Mr Monckton that her good opinion might with ease be improved into a regard  the most partial.
Mr Monckton regretted the venal rapacity with which Mr Monckton had sacrificed  Mr Monckton to a woman Mr Monckton abhorred, and Mr Monckton wishes for her final decay became daily  more fervent.
Mr Monckton knew that the acquaintance of Cecilia was confined to a circle  of which Mr Monckton was Mr Monckton the principal ornament, that Cecilia had rejected all the  proposals of marriage which had hitherto been made to Cecilia, and, as Mr Monckton had  sedulously watched Cecilia from Cecilia earliest years, Mr Monckton had reason to believe that  Cecilia heart had escaped any dangerous impression.
This being Cecilia situation, Mr Monckton  had long looked upon Cecilia as Mr Monckton future property; as such Mr Monckton had indulged Mr Monckton  admiration, and as such Mr Monckton had already appropriated Cecilia estate, though Mr Monckton had  not more vigilantly inspected into Cecilia sentiments, than Mr Monckton had guarded Mr Monckton own  from a similar scrutiny.
The death of the Dean Cecilia had, indeed, much alarmed him; her uncle grieved at  her uncle leaving Suffolk, where her uncle considered her uncle the first man, alike in parts  and in consequence, and her uncle dreaded Cecilia residing in London, where her uncle foresaw  that numerous rivals, equal to her uncle in talents and in riches, would speedily  surround Cecilia; rivals, too, youthful and sanguine, not shackled by present ties,  but at liberty to solicit Cecilia immediate acceptance.
Beauty and independence,  rarely found together, would attract a crowd of suitors at once brilliant and  assiduous; and the house of Mr Harrel was eminent for the house of Mr Harrel elegance and gaiety;  but yet, undaunted by danger, and confiding in Mr Harrel own powers, Mr Harrel determined to  pursue the project Mr Harrel had formed, not fearing by address and perseverance to  ensure   success.
