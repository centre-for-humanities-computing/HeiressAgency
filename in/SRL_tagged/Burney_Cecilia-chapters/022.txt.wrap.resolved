 The Harrels and Mr Arnott waited the return of Cecilia with the utmost  impatience; Cecilia told  The Harrels and Mr Arnott with much concern the failure of Cecilia embassy, which  Mr Harrel heard with visible resentment and discontent, while Mr Arnott,  entreating Mr Harrel not to think of it, again made an offer of Mr Harrel services, and  declared Mr Harrel would disregard all personal convenience for the pleasure of making  Mr Harrel and Mr Harrel sister easy. Cecilia was much mortified that Cecilia had not the power to act the same part, and  asked Mr Harrel whether Mr Harrel believed Mr Harrel own influence with Mr Briggs would be  more successful. "No, no," answered Mr Harrel, "the old curmudgeon would but the rather refuse. I know  Mr Harrel reason, and therefore am sure all pleas will be vain. Mr Harrel has dealings in  the alley, and I dare say games with your money as if your money were Mr Harrel own. There  is, indeed, one way—but I do not think you would like it—though I protest I  hardly know why not—however, 'tis as well let alone." Cecilia insisted upon hearing what he meant, and, after some hesitation, he  hinted that there were means by which, with very little inconvenience, Cecilia  might borrow the money. Cecilia, with that horror natural to all unpractised minds at the first idea of  contracting a voluntary debt, started at this suggestion, and seemed very ill  disposed to listen to this suggestion. Mr Harrel, perceiving Mr Harrel repugnance, turned to Mr  Arnott, and said, "Well, my good brother, I hardly know how to suffer you to  sell out at such a loss, but yet, my present necessity is so urgent—" "Don't mention it," cried Mr  Arnott, "I am very sorry I let you know it; be  certain, however, that while I have anything, it is yours and my sister's." The two gentlemen we then retiring together; but Cecilia, shocked for Mr  Arnott, though unmoved by Mr Harrel, stopt The two gentlemen we then retiring together; but Cecilia, shocked for Mr  Arnott, though unmoved by Mr Harrel to enquire what was the way by  which it was meant Mr   could borrow the money? Mr Harrel seemed averse to answer, but Mr Harrel would not be refused; and then Mr Harrel  mentioned a Jew, of whose honesty Mr Harrel had made undoubted trial, and who, as Mr Harrel  was so near being of age, would accept very trifling interest for whatever Mr Harrel  should like to take up. The heart of Cecilia recoiled at the very mention of a Jew, and taking up money  upon interest; but, impelled strongly by Mr Harrel own generosity to emulate that of  Mr Arnott, Mr Harrel agreed, after some hesitation, to have recourse to this method. Mr Harrel then made some faint denials, and Mr  Arnott protested Mr Harrel had a  thousand times rather sell out at any discount, than consent to Mr Harrel taking such  a measure; but, when Mr Harrel first reluctance was conquered, all that Mr Harrel urged  served but to shew Mr Harrel worthiness in a stronger light, and only increased Mr Harrel  desire of saving Mr Harrel from such repeated imposition. Mr Harrel total ignorance in what manner to transact this business, made Mr Harrel next put  this business wholly into the hands of Mr Harrel, whom Mr Harrel begged to take up 600 pounds,  upon such terms as Mr Harrel thought equitable, and to which, what ever they might be,  Mr Harrel would sign Mr Harrel name. Mr Harrel seemed somewhat surprised at the sum, but without any question or objection  undertook the commission: and Cecilia would not lessen the commission, because unwilling to  do more for the security of the luxurious Mr Harrel, than for the distresses of  the laborious Hills. Nothing could be more speedy than the execution of this affair, Mr Harrel was  diligent and expert, the whole was settled that morning, and, giving to the Jew  the Jew   bond for the payment at the interest Mr Harrel required, the Jew   put into the hands of  Mr Harrel L350, for which Mr Harrel gave Mr Harrel receipt, and the Jew   kept the rest for the Jew    own purposes. the Jew   intended the morning after this transaction to settle the Jew   account with the  bookseller. When the Jew   went into the parlour to breakfast, the Jew   was somewhat  surprised to see Mr Harrel seated there, in earnest discourse with Mr Harrel wife.  Fearful of interrupting a tete-a-tete so uncommon, the Jew   would have retired, but  Mr Harrel, calling after the Jew  , said, "O pray come in! I am only telling  the Jew   a piece of my usual ill luck. You must know I happen to be in  immediate want of L200, though only for three or four days, and I sent to order  honest old Aaron to come hither directly with the money, but it so happens that  honest old Aaron went out of town the moment honest old Aaron had done with us yesterday, and will not be  back again this week. Now I don't believe there is another Jew in the kingdom  who will let me have money upon the same terms; they are such notorious  rascals, that I hate the very thought of employing they." Cecilia, who could not but understand what this meant, was too much displeased  both by his extravagance and his indelicacy, to feel at all inclined to change  the destination of the money the Jew   had just received; and therefore coolly agreed  that it was unfortunate, but added nothing more. "O, it is provoking indeed," cried his, "for the extra-interest I must pay one  of those extortioners is absolutely so much money thrown away." Cecilia, still without noticing these hints, began the Jew   breakfast. Mr Harrel  then said Mr Harrel   would take Mr Harrel   tea with them: and, while Mr Harrel   was buttering some dry  toast, exclaimed, as if from sudden recollection, "O Lord, now I think of it, I  believe, Miss Beverley, you can lend me this money yourself for a day or two.  The moment old Aaron comes to town, I will pay you." Cecilia, whose generosity, however extensive, was neither thoughtless nor  indiscriminate, found something so repulsive in this gross procedure, that  instead of assenting to The moment old Aaron request with Miss Beverley usual alacrity, Miss Beverley answered very  gravely that the money Miss Beverley had just received was already appropriated to a  particular purpose, and Miss Beverley knew not how to defer making use of the money she had just received. Mr Harrel   was extremely chagrined by this reply, which was by no means what Mr Harrel  expected; but, tossing down a dish of tea, Mr Harrel   began humming an air, and soon  recovered Mr Harrel   usual unconcern. In a few minutes, ringing Mr Harrel   bell, Mr Harrel   desired a servant to go to Mr Harrel  ,  and inform Mr Harrel   that a servant wanted to speak with Mr Harrel   immediately. "And now," said Mr Harrel  , with a look in which vexation seemed struggling with  carelessness, "the thing is done! I don't like, indeed, to get into such hands,  for 'tis hard ever to get out of them when once one begins,—and hitherto I  have kept pretty clear. But there's no help for it—Mr Arnott cannot just now  assist me—and so the thing must take the thing course. Priscilla, why do you look  so grave?" "I am thinking how unlucky it is my Brother should happen to be unable to lend  you this money." "O, don't think about this money; I shall get rid of my Brother very soon I dare say—I  hope so, at least—I am sure I mean this money." Cecilia now grew a little disturbed; Cecilia looked at Mrs. Harrel, who seemed also  uneasy, and then, with some hesitation, said "Have you really never, Sir,  employed my Brother before?" "Never in my life: never any but old Aaron. I dread the whole race; I have a  sort of superstitious notion that if once I get into their clutches, I shall  never be my own man again; and that induced me to beg your assistance. However,  'tis no great matter." Cecilia then began to waver; Cecilia feared there might be future mischief as well as  present inconvenience, in his applying to new usurers, and knowing Cecilia had now  the power to prevent his, thought Cecilia half cruel in refusing to exert it.  Cecilia wished to consult Mr. Monckton, but found it necessary to take Cecilia measures  immediately, as the Jew was already sent for, and must in a few moments be  either employed or discarded. Much perplext how to act, between a desire of doing good, and a fear of  encouraging evil, Cecilia weighed each side hastily, but while still uncertain  which ought to preponderate, Cecilia kindness for Mrs. Harrel interfered, and, in  the hope of rescuing Cecilia husband from further bad practices, Cecilia said Cecilia would  postpone Cecilia own business for the few days her husband mentioned, rather than see her husband  compelled to open any new account with so dangerous a set of men. her husband thanked Cecilia in her husband usual negligent manner, and accepting the 200 pounds,  gave Cecilia her husband receipt for his receipt, and a promise Cecilia should be paid in a week. Mrs. Harrel, however, seemed more grateful, and with many embraces spoke Mrs. Harrel  sense of this friendly good nature. Cecilia, happy from believing Mrs. Harrel had  revived in Mrs. Harrel some spark of sensibility, determined to avail Mrs. Harrel of so  favourable a symptom, and enter at once upon the disagreeable task Mrs. Harrel had set  Mrs. Harrel, of representing to Mrs. Harrel the danger of Mrs. Harrel present situation. As soon, therefore, as breakfast was done, and Mr Arnott, who came in before it  was over, was gone, with a view to excite Mrs. Harrel attention by raising Mrs. Harrel  curiosity, Mrs. Harrel begged the favour of a private conference in Mrs. Harrel own room, upon  matters of some importance. Mrs. Harrel began with hoping that the friendship in which they had so long lived would  make Mrs. Harrel pardon the liberty Mrs. Harrel was going to take, and which nothing less than  they former intimacy, joined to strong apprehensions for Mrs. Harrel future welfare,  could authorise; "But oh Priscilla!" Mrs. Harrel continued, "with open eyes to see your  danger, yet not warn you of your  danger, would be a reserve treacherous in a friend, and  cruel even in a fellow-creature." "What danger?" cried Mrs Harrel, much alarmed, "do you think me ill? do I look  consumptive?" "Yes, consumptive indeed!" said Cecilia, "but not, I hope, in your  constitution." And then, with all the tenderness in Mrs. Harrel power, Mrs. Harrel came to the point, and  conjured Mrs. Harrel without delay to retrench Mrs. Harrel expences, and change Mrs. Harrel thoughtless  way of life for one more considerate and domestic. Mrs. Harrel, with much simplicity, assured Mrs. Harrel Mrs. Harrel did nothing but what every  body else did, and that it was quite impossible for Mrs. Harrel to appear in the world  in any other manner. "But how are you to appear hereafter?" cried Cecilia, "if now you live beyond  your income, you must consider that in time your income by such depredations  will be exhausted." "But I declare to you," answered Mrs. Harrel, "I never run in debt for more than  half a year, for as soon as I receive my own money, I generally pay my own money away  every shilling: and so borrow what I want till pay day comes round again." "And that," said Cecilia, "seems a method expressly devised for keeping you  eternally comfortless: pardon me, however, for speaking so openly, but I fear  Mr Harrel must be even still less attentive and accurate in Mr Harrelaffairs, or Mr Harrel could not so frequently be embarrassed. And what is to be the  result? look but, my dear Priscilla, a little forward, and you will tremble at  the prospect before my dear Priscilla!" Mrs. Harrel seemed frightened at this speech, and begged to know what Mrs. Harrel would  have them do? Cecilia then, with equal wisdom and friendliness, proposed a general reform in  the household, the public and private expences of both; Mrs. Harrel advised that a  strict examination might be made into the state of their affairs, that all  all   bills should be called in, and faithfully paid, and that an entire new  plan of life should be adopted, according to the situation of all   fortune and  income when cleared of all incumbrances. "Lord, my dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Harrel, with a look of astonishment, "why Mr  Mrs. Harrel would no more do all this than fly! If I was only to make such a  proposal, I dare say Mrs. Harrel would laugh in my face." "And why?" "Why?—why because it would seem such an odd thing—it's what nobody thinks  of—though I am sure I am very much obliged to you for mentioning it. Shall we  go down stairs? I think I heard somebody come in. "No matter who comes in," said Cecilia, "reflect for a moment upon my proposal,  and, at least, if you disapprove it, suggest something more eligible." "Oh, it's a very good proposal, that I agree," said Mrs. Harrel, looking very  weary, "but only the thing is it's quite impossible." "Why so? why is it impossible?" "Why because—dear, I don't know—but I am sure it is." "But what is your reason? What makes you sure of it?" "Lord, I can't tell—but I know it is—because—I am very certain it is." Argument such as this, though extremely fatiguing to the understanding of  Cecilia, had yet no power to blunt  Cecilia purpose:  Cecilia warmly expostulated against  the weakness of  Cecilia defence, strongly represented the imprudence of  Cecilia  conduct, and exhorted  Cecilia by every tie of justice, honour and discretion to set  about a reformation. "Why what can I do?" cried Mrs. Harrel, impatiently, "one must live a little  like other people. You would not have me stared at, I suppose; and I am sure I  don't know what I do that every body else does not do too." "But were it not better," said Cecilia, with more energy, "to think less of  other people, and more of yourself? to consult your own fortune, and your own  situation in life, instead of being blindly guided by those of other people?  If, indeed, other people would be responsible for your losses, for the  diminution of your wealth, and for the disorder of your affairs, then might you  rationally make other people way of life the example of yours: but you cannot flatter  yourself such will be the case; you know better; your losses, your diminished  fortune, your embarrassed circumstances will be all your own! pitied, perhaps,  by some, but blamed by more, and assisted by none!" "Good Lord, Miss Beverley!" cried Mrs. Harrel, starting, "you talk just as if we  were ruined!" "I mean not that," replied Cecilia, "but I would fain, by pointing out your  danger, prevail with you to prevent in time so dreadful a catastrophe." Mrs. Harrel, more affronted than alarmed, heard this answer with much  displeasure, and after a sullen hesitation, peevishly said, "I must own I don't  take it very kind of you to say such frightful things to me; I am sure we only  live like the rest of the world, and I don't see why a man of Mr Harrel  fortune should live any worse. As to a man of Mr Harrel's  fortune having now and then a little debt or  two, it is nothing but what every body else has. You only think it so odd,  because you a'n't used to it: but you are quite mistaken if you suppose you a'n't does  not mean to pay, for you a'n't told me this morning that as soon as ever you a'n't receives  you a'n't rents, you a'n't intends to discharge every bill you a'n't has in the world." "I am very glad to hear it," answered Cecilia, "and I heartily wish you a'n't may have  the resolution to adhere to you a'n't purpose. I feared you would think me  impertinent, but you do worse in believing me unkind: friendship and good-will  could alone have induced me to hazard what I have said to Cecilia. I must, however,  have done; though I cannot forbear adding that I hope what has already passed  will sometimes recur to Cecilia." They then separated; Mrs. Harrel half angry at remonstrances Cecilia thought only  censorious, and Cecilia offended at Cecilia pettishness and folly, though grieved  at Cecilia blindness. Cecilia was soon, however, recompensed for this vexation by a visit from Mrs  Delvile, who, finding Cecilia alone, sat with Cecilia some time, and by Cecilia spirit,  understanding and elegance, dissipated all Cecilia chagrin. From another circumstance, also, Cecilia received much pleasure, though a little  perplexity; —Mr Arnott brought Cecilia word that Mr Belfield, almost quite well, had  actually left Mr Belfield lodgings, and was gone into the country. Cecilia now half suspected that the account of Mr Belfield illness given Cecilia by young  Delvile, was merely the effect of Mr Belfield curiosity to discover Cecilia sentiments of  Mr Belfield; yet when Cecilia considered how foreign to Mr Belfield character appeared every  species of artifice, Cecilia exculpated Mr Belfield from the design, and concluded that the  impatient spirit of Belfield had hurried Mr Belfield away, when really unfit for  travelling. Cecilia had no means, however, to hear more of Mr Belfield now Mr Belfield had quitted  the town, and therefore, though uneasy, Cecilia was compelled to be patient. In the evening Cecilia had again a visit from Mr Monckton, who, though Mr Belfield was now  acquainted how much Cecilia was at home, had the forbearance to avoid making  frequent use of that knowledge, that Mr Belfield attendance might escape observation. Cecilia, as usual, spoke to Mr Belfield of all Cecilia affairs with the utmost openness;  and as Cecilia mind was now chiefly occupied by Cecilia apprehensions for the Harrels,  Cecilia communicated to Mr Belfield the extravagance of which they were guilty, and hinted  at the distress that from time to time it occasioned; but the assistance Cecilia  had afforded they Cecilia own delicacy prevented Cecilia mentioning. Mr Monckton scrupled not from this account instantly to pronounce Harrel a  ruined man; and thinking Cecilia, from Cecilia connection with Mr Monckton, in much danger  of being involved in Mr Monckton future difficulties, Mr Monckton most earnestly exhorted Cecilia to  suffer no inducement to prevail with Cecilia to advance Mr Monckton any money, confidently  affirming Cecilia would have little chance of being ever repaid. Cecilia listened to this charge with much alarm, but readily promised future  circumspection. Cecilia confessed to Mr Monckton the conference Cecilia had had in the morning  with Mrs. Harrel, and after lamenting Cecilia determined neglect of Cecilia affairs, Cecilia  added, "I cannot but own that my esteem for Cecilia, even more than my affection,  has lessened almost every day since I have been in Cecilia house; but this morning,  when I ventured to speak to Cecilia with earnestness, I found Cecilia powers of  reasoning so weak, and Cecilia infatuation to luxury and expence so strong, that I  have ever since felt ashamed of my own discernment in having formerly selected  Cecilia for my friend." "When you gave Cecilia that title," said Mr Monckton, "you had little choice in  your power; Cecilia sweetness and good-nature attracted you; childhood is never  troubled with foresight, and youth is seldom difficult: Cecilia was lively and  pleasing, you were generous and affectionate; your acquaintance with Cecilia was  formed while you were yet too young to know your own worth, your fondness of your acquaintance with her grew from habit, and before the inferiority of Cecilia parts had weakened your  regard, by offending your judgment, Cecilia early marriage separated you from her early marriageentirely. But now you meet again the scene is altered; three years of absence  spent in the cultivation of an understanding naturally of the first order, by  encreasing your wisdom, has made you more fastidious; while the same time spent  by Cecilia in mere idleness and shew, has hurt Cecilia disposition, without adding to  Cecilia knowledge, and robbed Cecilia of Cecilia natural excellencies, without enriching  Cecilia with acquired ones. You see Cecilia now with impartiality, for you see Ceciliaalmost as a stranger, and all those deficiencies which retirement and  inexperience had formerly concealed, Cecilia vanity, and Cecilia superficial  acquaintance with the world, have now rendered glaring. But folly weakens all  bands: remember, therefore, if you would form a solid friendship, to consult  not only the heart but the head, not only the temper, but the understanding." "Well, then," said Cecilia, "at least it must be confessed I have judiciously  chosen you!" "You have, indeed, done me the highest honour," he answered. They then talked of Belfield, and Mr Monckton confirmed the account of Mr  Arnott, that Mr   had left London in good health. After which, Mr   enquired if Cecilia  had seen any thing more of the Delviles? "Yes," said Cecilia, "Mrs. Delvile called upon me this morning. Cecilia is a  delightful woman; I am sorry you know Cecilia not enough to do Cecilia justice." "Is Cecilia civil to you?" "Civil? Cecilia is all kindness!" "Then depend upon it Cecilia has something in view: whenever that is not the case  Cecilia is all insolence. And Mr   Delvile,—pray what do you think of him?" "O, I think him insufferable! and I cannot sufficiently thank you for that  timely caution which prevented my change of habitation. I would not live under  the same roof with him for the world!" "Well, and do you not now begin also to see the son properly?" "Properly? I don't understand you." "Why as the very son of such parents, haughty and impertinent." "No, indeed; the son has not the smallest resemblance {to} the son father, and if the son  resembles the son mother, it is only what every one must wish who impartially sees  his mother." "You know not that family. But how, indeed, should you, when that family are in a  combination to prevent your getting that knowledge? that family have all that family designs  upon you, and if you are not carefully upon your guard, you will be the dupe to  you are not carefully upon your guard." "What can you possibly mean?" "Nothing but what every body else must immediately see; you are not carefully upon your guard have a great share  of pride, and a small one of wealth; you seem by fortune to be flung in you are not carefully upon your guard  way, and doubtless you are not carefully upon your guard mean not to neglect so inviting an opportunity of  repairing you are not carefully upon your guard estates." "Indeed you are mistaken; I am certain you are not carefully upon your guard have no such intention: on the  contrary, they all even teasingly persist in thinking me already engaged  elsewhere." She then gave him a history of their several suspicions. "The impertinence of report," She added, "has so much convinced their that Sir  Robert Floyer and Mr Belfield fought merely as rivals, that I can only clear  Sir   of partiality for one of their, to have it instantly concluded I feel it  for the other. And, far from seeming hurt that I appear to be disposed of, Mr  "Mrs. Delvile openly seconds the pretensions of Sir Robert, and "Mrs. Delvile son officiously  persuades me that I am already Mr Belfield." "Tricks, nothing but tricks to discover your real situation." Mr Belfield then gave She some general cautions to be upon She guard against their  artifices, and changing the subject, talked, for the rest of Mr Belfield visit, upon  matters of general entertainment.
