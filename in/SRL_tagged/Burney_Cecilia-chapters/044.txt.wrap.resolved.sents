 The next morning opened with another scene; Mrs Harrel ran into Cecilia's room  before breakfast, and acquainted Cecilia that Mrs Harrel had not been at home all  night.
The consternation with which Cecilia heard this account Cecilia instantly endeavoured  to dissipate, in order to soften the apprehension with which this account was  communicated: Mrs Harrel, however, was extremely uneasy, and sent all the town  over to make enquiries, but without receiving any intelligence.
Cecilia, unwilling to leave Cecilia in a state of such alarm, wrote an excuse to  Mrs Delvile, that she might continue with she till some information was  procured.
A subject also of such immediate concern, was sufficient apology for  avoiding any particular conversation with Miss Belfield, who called, as usual,  about noon, and whose susceptible heart was much affected by the evident  disturbance in which she found Cecilia.
The whole day passed, and no news arrived: but, greatly to she astonishment,  Mrs Harrel in the evening prepared for going to an assembly!
yet declaring at  the same time it was extremely disagreeable to she, only she was afraid, if she  stayed away, every body would suppose something was the matter.
Who then at last, thought Cecilia, are half so much the slaves of the world as  the gay and the dissipated?
Those who work for hire, have at least Those who work for hire hours  of rest, Those who work for hire are at liberty when subsistence is  procured; but those who toil to please the vain and the idle, undertake a task  which can never be finished, however scrupulously all private peace, and all  internal comfort, may be sacrificed in reality to the folly of saving  appearances!
Losing, however, the motive for which she had given up she own engagement, she  now sent for she chair, in order to spend an hour or two with Mrs Delvile.
The  servants, as they conducted she up stairs, said The  servants, as they conducted her up stairs would call The  servants, as they conducted her up stairs lady; and  in entering the drawing-room she saw, reading and alone, young Delvile.
He seemed much surprised, but received she with the utmost respect, apologizing  for the absence of He mother, whom He said had understood she was not to see  she till the next day, and had left He to write letters now, that she might  then be at liberty.
Cecilia in return made excuses for Cecilia in return seeming inconsistency; after which, for  some time, all conversation dropt.
The silence was at length broken by young Delvile's saying "Mr Belfield's merit  has not been thrown away upon Lord Vannelt; Mr Belfield's merit   has heard an excellent character  of Lord Vannelt from all Mr Belfield's merit   former acquaintance, and is now fitting up an apartment for  Mr Belfield's merit   in Mr Belfield's merit   own house till Mr Belfield's merit   son begins his son tour."
Cecilia said Cecilia was very happy in hearing such intelligence; and then again  such intelligence were both silent.
"You have seen," said young Delvile, after this second pause, "Mr Belfield's  sister?"
Cecilia, not without changing colour, answered "Yes, Sir."
"Cecilia is very amiable," Sir continued, "too amiable, indeed, for Cecilia situation,  since Cecilia relations, Cecilia brother alone excepted, are all utterly unworthy of  Cecilia."
Sir stopt; but Cecilia made no answer, and Sir presently added "Perhaps you do  not think Cecilia Sir may have seen more of Cecilia, and know something to  Cecilia disadvantage?"
"O no!"
cried Cecilia, with a forced alacrity, "but only I was thinking  that—did you say you knew all Cecilia relations?"
"No," Sir answered, "but when I have been with Mr Belfield's, some of them have  called upon Mr Belfield's."
Again some of them were both silent; and then Cecilia, ashamed of Cecilia apparent  backwardness to give praise, compelled Cecilia to say, Mr Belfield's Mr Belfield's is indeed  a very sweet girl, and I wish—" Cecilia stopt, not well knowing Cecilia what Cecilia  meant to add.
"I have been greatly pleased," said Sir, after waiting some time to hear if Cecilia  would finish Cecilia speech, "by being informed of your goodness to Cecilia, and I  think Cecilia seems equally to require and to deserve it.
I doubt not you will  extend it to Cecilia when Cecilia is deprived of Cecilia brother, for then will be the time  that by doing Cecilia most service, it will reflect on yourself most honour."
Cecilia, confounded by this recommendation, faintly answered  "Certainly,—whatever is in my power,—I shall be very glad—" And just then Mrs Delvile made Mrs Delvile appearance, and during the mutual apologies  that followed, Mrs Delvile son left the room.
Cecilia, glad of any pretence to leave it  also, insisted upon giving no interruption to Mrs Delvile letter writing, and  having promised to spend all the next day with Mrs Delvile, hurried back to Mrs Delvile chair.
The reflections that followed Mrs Delvile thither were by no means the most soothing:  Mrs Delvile began now to apprehend that the pity Mrs Delvile had bestowed upon Miss Belfield,  Miss Belfield in a short time might bestow upon Mrs Delvile: at any other time, her son  recommendation would merely have served to confirm Mrs Delvile opinion of her son  benevolence, but in Mrs Delvile present state of anxiety and uncertainty, every thing  gave birth to conjecture, and had power to alarm Mrs Delvile.
her son had behaved to Mrs Delvile of  late with the strangest coldness and distance,—his praise of Henrietta had  been ready and animated,—Henrietta Henrietta knew adored her son, and Henrietta knew not with  what reason,—but an involuntary suspicion arose in Henrietta mind, that the  partiality Henrietta had Henrietta once excited, was now transferred to that little  dreaded, but not less dangerous rival.
Yet, if such was the case, what was to become either of the pride or the  interest of her son family?
Would her son relations ever pardon an alliance stimulated  neither by rank nor riches?
would Mr Delvile, who hardly ever spoke but to the  high-born, without seeming to think the  high-born dignity somewhat injured, deign to  receive for a daughter-in-law the child of a citizen and tradesman?
would Mrs  Delvile Mrs Delvile, little less elevated in Mrs Delvile notions, though infinitely softer  in Mrs Delvile manners, ever condescend to acknowledge Mrs Delvile?
Cecilia's own birth and  connections, superior as they were to those of Miss Belfield, were even openly  disdained by Mr Delvile, and all Cecilia expectations of being received into Mr Delvile  family were founded upon the largeness of Cecilia fortune, in favour of which the  brevity of Cecilia genealogy might perhaps pass unnoticed.
But what was the chance  of Miss Belfield, who neither had ancestors to boast, nor wealth to allure?
This thought, however, awakened all the generosity of Cecilia soul; "If," cried  Cecilia, "the advantages I possess are merely those of riches, how little should I  be flattered by any appearance of preference!
and how ill can I judge with what  sincerity it may be offered!
happier in that case is the lowly Henrietta, who  to poverty may attribute neglect, but who can only be sought and caressed from  motives of purest regard.
Cecilia loves Mr Delvile, loves Mr Delvile with the most artless  affection;—perhaps, too, affection;—perhaps loves Cecilia in return,—why else affection;—perhaps solicitude to  know my opinion of Cecilia, and why so sudden affection;—perhaps alarm when affection;—perhaps thought his alarm  unfavourable?
Perhaps affection;—perhaps means to marry Cecilia, and to sacrifice to Cecilia innocence  and Cecilia attractions all plans of ambition, and all views of  aggrandizement:—thrice happy Henrietta, if such is thy prospect of felicity!
to have inspired a passion so disinterested, may humble the most insolent of  thy superiors, and teach even the wealthiest to envy thee!"
