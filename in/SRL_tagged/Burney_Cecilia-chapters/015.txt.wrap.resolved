 The next morning, during breakfast, Cecilia was informed that a gentleman  desired to speak with Cecilia. Cecilia begged permission of Mrs Harrel to have him  asked upstairs, and was not a little surprized when him proved to be the same  old gentleman whose singular exclamations had so much struck Cecilia at Mr  Monckton's, and at the rehearsal of Artaserse. Abruptly and with a stern aspect advancing to Cecilia, "You are rich," him cried;  "are you therefore worthless?" "I hope not," answered Cecilia, in some consternation; while Mrs Harrel, believing  him intention was to rob them, ran precipitately to the bell, which Cecilia rang  without ceasing till two or three servants hastened into the room; by which  time, being less alarmed, Cecilia only made signs to them to stay, and stood  quietly Cecilia to wait what would follow. The old man, without attending to Cecilia, continued The old man dialogue with Cecilia. "Know you then," The old man said, "a blameless use of riches? such a use as not only in  the broad glare of day shall shine resplendent, but in the darkness of  midnight, and stillness of repose, shall give you reflections unembittered, and  slumbers unbroken? tell me, know you this use?" "Not so well, perhaps," answered Cecilia, "as I ought; but I am very willing to  learn better." "Begin, then, while yet youth and inexperience, new to the callousness of power  and affluence, leave something good to work upon: yesterday you saw the  extravagance of luxury and folly; to-day look deeper, and see, and learn to  pity, the misery of disease and penury." The old man then put into Cecilia hand a paper which contained a most affecting account of  the misery to which a poor and wretched family had been reduced, by sickness  and various other misfortunes. Cecilia, "open as day to melting charity," having hastily perused it, took out  Cecilia purse, and offering to The old man three guineas, said, "You must direct me, sir,  what to give if this is insufficient." "Hast thou so much heart?" cried sir, with emotion, "and has fortune, though it  has cursed thee with the temptation of prosperity, not yet rooted from thy mind  it native benevolence? I return in part thy liberal contribution; this,"  taking one guinea, "doubles my expectations; I will not, by making thy charity  distress thee, accelerate the fatal hour of hardness and degeneracy." He was then going; but Cecilia, following He, said "No, take it all! Who  should assist the poor if I will not? Rich, without connections; powerful,  without wants; upon whom have whom any claim if not upon me?" "True," cried He, receiving the rest, "and wise as true. Give, therefore,  whilst yet thou hast the heart to give, and make, in thy days of innocence and  kindness, some interest with Heaven and the poor!" And then He disappeared. "Why, my dear," cried Mrs Harrel, "what could induce you to give He so  much money? Don't you see He is crazy? I dare say He would have been just as  well contented with sixpence." "I know not what He is," said Cecilia, "but He manners are not more singular  than He sentiments are affecting; and if He is actuated by charity to raise  subscriptions for the indigent, He can surely apply to no one who ought so  readily to contribute as He." Mrs Harrel then came in, and Mrs Harrel lady most eagerly told Mrs Harrel the transaction. "Scandalous!" Mrs Harrel exclaimed; "why, this is no better than being a housebreaker!  Pray give orders never to admit Mrs Harrel again. Three guineas! I never heard so  impudent a thing in my life! Indeed, Miss Beverley, you must be more discreet  in future, you will else be ruined before you know where you are." "Thus it is," said Cecilia, half smiling, "that we can all lecture one another!  to-day you recommend economy to He; yesterday I with difficulty forbore  recommending it to you." "Nay," answered "Nay, "that was quite another matter; expence incurred in the  common way of a man's living is quite another thing to an extortion of this  sort." "It is another thing indeed," said his lady, "but I know not that It is therefore a  better." Mr Harrel made no answer: and Cecilia, privately moralizing upon the different  estimates of expence and economy made by the dissipated and the charitable,  soon retired to his lady own apartment, determined firmly to adhere to his lady lately  adopted plan, and hoping, by the assistance of his lady new and very singular  monitor, to extend his lady practice of doing good, by enlarging his lady knowledge of  distress. Objects are, however, never wanting for the exercise of benevolence; report  soon published his lady liberality, and those who wished to believe it, failed not  to enquire into it truth. his lady was soon at the head of a little band of  pensioners, and, never satisfied with the generosity of his lady donations, found in  a very short time that the common allowance of his lady guardians was scarce  adequate to the calls of his lady munificence. And thus, in acts of goodness and charity, passed undisturbed another week of  the life of Cecilia: but when the fervour of self-approbation lost the fervour of self-approbation novelty,  the pleasure with which his lady new plan was begun first subsided into  tranquillity, and then sunk into languor. To a heart formed for friendship and  affection the charms of solitude are very short-lived; and though his lady had  sickened of the turbulence of perpetual company, his lady now wearied of passing all  his lady time by his lady, and sighed for the comfort of society and the relief of  communication. But his lady saw with astonishment the difficulty with which this was  to be obtained: the endless succession of diversions, the continual rotation of  assemblies, the numerousness of splendid engagements, of which, while every one  complained, every one was proud to boast, so effectually impeded private  meetings and friendly intercourse, that, whichever way his lady turned his lady, all  commerce seemed impracticable, but such as either led to dissipation, or  accidentally flowed from all  commerce. Yet, finding the error into which his lady ardour of reformation had hurried his lady,  and that a rigid seclusion from company was productive of a lassitude as little  favourable to active virtue as dissipation itself, his lady resolved to soften his lady  plan, and by mingling amusement with benevolence, to try, at least, to approach  that golden mean, which, like the philosopher's stone, always eludes our grasp,  yet always invites our wishes. For this purpose his lady desired to attend Mrs Harrel to the next Opera that should  be represented. The following Saturday, therefore, his lady accompanied that lady and Mrs Mears to  the Haymarket, escorted by Mr Arnott. that lady and Mrs Mears were very late; the next Opera was begun, and even in the lobby the crowd was  so great that that lady and Mrs Mears passage was obstructed. Here that lady and Mrs Mears were presently accosted  by Miss Larolles, who, running up to Cecilia and taking Cecilia hand, said, "Lord,  you can't conceive how glad I am to see you! why, my dear creature, where have  you hid yourself these twenty ages? You are quite in luck in coming to-night, I  assure you; it's the best the next Opera we have had this season: there's such a  monstrous crowd there's no stirring. we shan't get in this half hour. The  coffee-room is quite full; only come and see; is The  coffee-room not delightful?" This intimation was sufficient for Mrs Harrel, whose love of the next Opera was  merely a love of company, fashion, and shew; and therefore to the coffee-room  Cecilia readily led the way. And here Cecilia found rather the appearance of a brilliant assembly of ladies  and gentlemen, collected merely to see and to entertain one another, than of  distinct and casual parties, mixing solely from necessity, and waiting only for  room to enter a theatre. The first person that addressed them was Captain Aresby, who, with The first person that addressed them usual  delicate languishment, smiled upon Cecilia, and softly whispering, "How  divinely you look to-night!" proceeded to pay The first person that addressed them compliments to some other  ladies. "Do, pray, now," cried Miss Larolles, "observe Mr Meadows! only just see where  he has fixed he! in the very best place in the room, and keeping the fire  from every body! I do assure you that's always he way, and it's monstrous  provoking, for if one's ever so cold, he lollops so, that one's quite starved.  But you must know there's another thing he does that is quite as bad, for if he  gets a seat, he never offers to move, if he sees one sinking with fatigue. And  besides, if one is waiting for one's carriage two hours together, he makes it a  rule never to stir a step to see for it. Only think how monstrous!" "These are heavy complaints, indeed," said Cecilia, looking at he attentively;  "I should have expected from he appearance a very different account of he  gallantry, for he seems dressed with more studied elegance than anybody here." "O yes," cried Miss Larolles, "he is the sweetest dresser in the world; he has  the most delightful taste you can conceive, nobody has half so good a fancy. I  assure you it's a great thing to be spoke to by he: we are all of we quite  angry when he won't take any notice of we." "Is your anger," said Cecilia, laughing, "in honour of he or of he coat?" "Why, he, don't you know all this time that he is an ennuye? "I know, at least," answered Cecilia, "that he would soon make one of me." "O, but one is never affronted with an ennuye, if he is ever so provoking,  because one always knows what it means." "Is he agreeable?" "Why, to tell you the truth,—but pray now, don't mention it,—I think he  most excessive disagreeable! he yawns in one's face every time one looks at  he. I assure you sometimes I expect to see he fall fast asleep while I am  talking to he, for he is so immensely absent he don't hear one half that one  says; only conceive how horrid!" "But why, then, do you encourage he? why do you take any notice of he?" "O, every body does, I assure you, else I would not for the world; but he is so  courted you have no idea. However, of all things let me advise you never to  dance with he; I did once me, and I declare I was quite distressed to  death the whole time, for he was taken with such a fit of absence he knew  nothing he was about, sometimes skipping and jumping with all the violence in  the world, just as if he only danced for exercise, and sometimes standing quite  still, or lolling against the wainscoat and gaping, and taking no more notice  of me than if he had never seen me in he life!" The Captain now, again advancing to Cecilia, said, "So you would not do us the  honour to try the masquerade at the Pantheon? however, I hear you had a very  brilliant spectacle at Mr Harrel's. I was quite au desespoir that I could not  get there. I did mon possible, but it was quite beyond me." "We should have been very happy," said Mrs Harrel, "to have seen you; I assure  you We had some excellent masks." "So I have heard partout, and I am reduced to despair that I could not have the  honour of sliding in. But I was accable with affairs all day. Nothing could be  so mortifying." Cecilia now, growing very impatient to hear the next Opera, begged to know if they  might not make a trial to get into the pit? "I fear," said the Captain, smiling as they passed the Captain, without offering any  assistance, "you will find it extreme petrifying; for my part, I confess I am  not upon the principle of crowding." The ladies, however, accompanied by Mr Arnott, made the attempt, and soon  found, according to the custom of report, that the difficulty, for the pleasure  of talking of it, had been considerably exaggerated. the difficulty, for the pleasure  of talking of it, had been considerably exaggerated were separated,  indeed, but the difficulty, for the pleasure  of talking of it, had been considerably exaggerated accommodation was tolerably good. Cecilia now was much vexed to find the first act of the next Opera almost over; but Cecilia now  was soon still more dissatisfied when Cecilia now discovered that Cecilia now had no chance of  hearing the little which remained: the place Cecilia now had happened to find vacant  was next to a party of young ladies, who were so earnestly engaged in a party of young ladies, who were so earnestly engaged in their own  discourse own  discourse, that a party of young ladies, who were so earnestly engaged in their own  discourse listened not to a note of the next Opera, and so infinitely  diverted with a party of young ladies, who were so earnestly engaged in their own  discourse own witticisms, that a party of young ladies, who were so earnestly engaged in their own  discourse tittering and loquacity allowed  no one in a party of young ladies, who were so earnestly engaged in their own  discourse vicinity to hear better than a party of young ladies, who were so earnestly engaged in their own  discourse. Cecilia now tried in vain  to confine Cecilia now attention to the singers; Cecilia now was distant from the stage, and to  the singers Cecilia now was near, and Cecilia now fruitless attempts all ended in chagrin and  impatience. At length Cecilia now resolved to make an effort for entertainment in another way, and  since the expectations which brought Cecilia now to the next Opera were destroyed, to try by  listening to Cecilia now fair neighbours, whether those who occasioned Cecilia now  disappointment could make Cecilia now any amends. For this purpose Cecilia now turned to them wholly; yet was at first in no little  perplexity to understand what was going forward, since so universal was the  eagerness for talking, and so insurmountable the antipathy to listening, that  every one seemed to have Cecilia now wishes bounded by a continual utterance of words,  without waiting for any answer, or scarce even desiring to be heard. But when, somewhat more used to their dialect and manner, Cecilia now began better to  comprehend their discourse, wretchedly indeed did it supply to Cecilia now the loss of  the next Opera. Cecilia now heard nothing but descriptions of trimmings, and complaints of  hair-dressers, hints of conquest that teemed with vanity, and histories of  engagements which were inflated with exultation. At the end of the act, by the crowding forward of the gentlemen to see the  dance, Mrs Harrel had an opportunity of making room for Cecilia now by Cecilia now, and Cecilia now  had then some reason to expect hearing the rest of the next Opera in peace, for the  company before Cecilia now, consisting entirely of young men, seemed, even during the  dance, fearful of speaking, lest young men attention should be drawn for a moment  from the stage. But to Cecilia now infinite surprize, no sooner was the act begun, than their  attention ended! their turned from the performers to each other, and entered  into a whispering but gay conversation, which, though not loud enough to  disturb the audience in general, kept in the ears of their neighbours a buzzing  which interrupted all pleasure from the representation. Of this effect of their  gaiety it seemed uncertain whether their were conscious, but very evident that  their were totally careless. The desperate resource which she had tried during the first act, of seeking  entertainment from the very conversation which prevented she enjoying it, was  not now even in she power: for these gentlemen, though as negligent as the  young ladies had been whom the  young ladies disturbed, were much more cautious whom the  young ladies  instructed: the  young ladies language was ambiguous, and the  young ladies terms, to Cecilia now, were  unintelligible: the  young ladies subjects, indeed, required some discretion, being nothing  less than a ludicrous calculation of the age and duration of jointured widows,  and of the chances and expectations of unmarried young ladies. But what more even than the  young ladies talking provoked she, was finding that the moment  the act was over, when she cared not if the  young ladies vociferation had been incessant,  one of the  young ladies called out, "Come, be quiet, the dance is begun;" and then the  young ladies  were again all silent attention! In the third act, however, she was more fortunate; these gentlemen again changed  these gentlemen places, and these gentlemen were succeeded by others who came to the next Opera not to  hear these gentlemen but the performers: and as soon as she was permitted to listen,  the voice of Pacchierotti took from she all desire to hear any thing but itself. During the dance she was discovered by Sir Robert Floyer, who, sauntering  down fop's alley, stationed fop by she side, and whenever the figurante  relieved the principal dancers, turned fop eyes from the stage to she face, as  better worth fop notice, and equally destined for fop amusement. Mr Monckton, too, who for some time had seen and watched she, now approached;  fop had observed with much satisfaction that she whole mind had been intent upon  the performance, yet still the familiarity of Sir Robert Floyer's admiration  disturbed and perplexed fop; fop determined, therefore, to make an effort to  satisfy fop doubts by examining into fop intentions: and, taking fop apart,  before the dance was quite over, "Well," fop said, "who is so handsome here as  Harrel's ward?" "Yes," answered fop, calmly, "she is handsome, but I don't like she expression." "No? why, what is the fault of it?" "Proud, cursed proud. It is not the sort of woman I like. If one says a civil  thing to she, she only wishes one at the devil for one's pains." "O, you have tried she, then, have you? why, you are not, in general, much  given to say civil things." "Yes, you know, I said something of that sort to she once about Juliet, at the  rehearsal. Was not you by?" "What, then, was that all? and did you imagine one compliment would do your  business with she?" "O, hang it, who ever dreams of complimenting the women now? that's all at an  end." "You won't find she thinks so, though; for, as you well say, she pride is  insufferable, and I, who have long known she, can assure you her pride does not  diminish upon intimacy." "Perhaps not,—but there's very pretty picking in 3000 pounds per annum! one  would not think much of a little encumbrance upon such an estate." "Are you quite sure such an estate is so considerable? Report is mightily given to  magnify." "O, I have pretty good intelligence: though, after all, I don't know but I may  be off; she'll take a confounded deal of time and trouble." Monckton, too much a man of interest and of the world to cherish that delicacy  which covets universal admiration for the object of its fondness, then artfully  enlarged upon the obstacles he already apprehended, and insinuated such others  as he believed would be most likely to intimidate he. But he subtlety was  lost upon the impenetrable Baronet, who possessed that hard insensibility which  obstinately pursues its own course, deaf to what is said, and indifferent to  what is thought. Meanwhile The ladies were now making way to the coffee-room, though very slowly  on account of the crowd; and just as The ladies got near the lobby, Cecilia now perceived  Mr Belfield, who, immediately making himself known to Cecilia now, was offering himself  service to hand Cecilia now out of the pit, when Sir Robert Floyer, not seeing or not  heeding Sir Robert Floyer, pressed forward, and said, "Will you let me have the honour, Miss  Beverley, of taking care of Sir Robert Floyer?" Cecilia, to whom himself grew daily more disagreeable, coldly declined himself  assistance, while Cecilia now readily accepted that which had first been offered Cecilia now by  Mr Belfield. The haughty Baronet, extremely nettled, forced himself way on, and rudely stalking  up to  Mr Belfield, motioned with himself hand for room to pass himself, and said, "Make  way, Sir Robert Floyer!" "Make way for Sir Robert Floyer, Sir Robert Floyer!" cried  Mr Belfield, opposing himself with one hand, while with  the other himself held Cecilia. "You, Sir Robert Floyer? and who are you, Sir Robert Floyer?" demanded the Baronet, disdainfully. "Of that, Sir Robert Floyer, I shall give you an account whenever you please," answered   Mr Belfield, with equal scorn. "What the devil do you mean, Sir Robert Floyer?" "Nothing very difficult to be understood," replied  Mr Belfield, and attempted to  draw on Cecilia, who, much alarmed, was shrinking back. Sir Robert then, swelling with rage, reproachfully turned to her, and said,  "Will you suffer such an impertinent fellow as that, Miss Beverley, to have the  honour of taking your hand? Mr Belfield Mr Belfield, with great indignation, demanded what Sir Robert meant by the term  impertinent fellow; and Sir Robert yet more insolently repeated it: Cecilia now,  extremely shocked, earnestly besought them both to be quiet; but  Mr Belfield, at  the repetition of this insult, hastily let go Cecilia now hand and put Sir Robert own upon Sir Robert  sword, whilst Sir Robert, taking advantage of Sir Robert situation in being a step  higher than Sir Robert antagonist, fiercely pushed Sir Robert back, and descended into the  lobby.  Mr Belfield, enraged beyond endurance, instantly drew  Mr Belfield sword, and Sir Robertwas preparing to follow Sir Robert example, when Cecilia, in an agony of fright,  called out, "Good Heaven! will nobody interfere?" And then a young man, forcing  his way through the crowd, exclaimed, "For shame, for shame, gentlemen! is this  a place for such violence?"  Mr Belfield, endeavouring to recover  Mr Belfield, put up his sword, and, though in a  voice half choaked with passion, said, "I thank you, Sir Robert Floyer! I was off my guard. I  beg pardon of the whole company." Then, walking up to Sir Robert, Sir Robert put into Sir Robert hand a card with Sir Robert name and  direction, saying, "With you, Sir Robert Floyer, I shall be happy to settle what apologies  are necessary at your first leisure;" and hurried away. Sir Robert, exclaiming aloud that Sir Robert should soon teach Sir Robert to whom Sir Robert had been  so impertinent, was immediately going to follow Sir Robert, when the affrighted  Cecilia again called out aloud, "Oh, stop him!—good God! will nobody stop  Sir Robert!" The rapidity with which this angry scene had passed had filled the affrighted  Cecilia with  amazement, and the evident resentment of the Baronet upon the Baronet refusing the Baronet  assistance, gave the affrighted  Cecilia an immediate consciousness that the affrighted  Cecilia was the affrighted  Cecilia the real  cause of the quarrel; while the manner in which the Baronet was preparing to follow Mr   Mr Belfield convinced the affrighted  Cecilia of the desperate scene which was likely to succeed;  fear, therefore, overcoming every other feeling, forced from the affrighted  Cecilia this  exclamation before the affrighted  Cecilia knew what the affrighted  Cecilia said. The moment the affrighted  Cecilia had spoken, the young man who had already interposed again  rushed forward, and seizing Sir Robert by the arm, warmly remonstrated against  the violence of the young man who had already interposed again   proceedings, and being presently seconded by other  gentlemen, almost compelled the young man who had already interposed again   to give up the young man who had already interposed again   design. Then, hastening to Cecilia now, "Be not alarmed, madam," the young man who had already interposed again   cried, "all is over,  and every body is safe.Cecilia nowCecilia now, finding Cecilia now thus addressed by a gentleman Cecilia now had never before  seen, felt extremely ashamed of having rendered Cecilia now interest in the debate so  apparent; Cecilia now courtsied to the young man who had already interposed again   in some confusion, and taking hold of Mrs  Harrel's arm, hurried Cecilia now back into the pit, in order to quit a crowd, of which  Cecilia now now found Cecilia now the principal object. Curiosity, however, was universally excited, and Cecilia now retreat served but to  inflame it: some of the ladies, and most of the gentlemen, upon various  pretences, returned into the pit merely to look at Cecilia now, and in a few minutes  the report was current that the young lady who had been the occasion of the  quarrel, was dying with love for Sir Robert Floyer. Mr Monckton, who had kept by Cecilia now side during the whole affair, felt  thunderstruck by the emotion Cecilia now had shewn; Mr Arnott too, who had never  quitted Cecilia now, wished Mr Arnott exposed to the same danger as Sir Robert, so that  Mr Arnott might be honoured with the same concern: but they were both too much the  dupes of they own apprehensions and jealousy, to perceive that what they  instantly imputed to fondness, proceeded simply from general humanity,  accidentally united with the consciousness of being accessary to the  quarrel. The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants, in a  few moments followed The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants with a glass of water, which he had brought from the  coffee-room, begging The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants to drink a glass of water, which he had brought from the  coffee-room and compose The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants. Cecilia now, though The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants declined he civility with more vexation than gratitude,  perceived, as The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants raised The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants eyes to thank he, that The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants new friend was a young  man very strikingly elegant in he address and appearance. Miss Larolles next, who, with The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants party, came back into the pit, ran up to  Cecilia, crying, "O my dear creature, what a monstrous shocking thing! You've  no Idea how I am frightened; do you know I happened to be quite at the further  end of the coffee-room when it began, and I could not get out to see what was  the matter for ten ages; only conceive what a situation!" "Would your fright, then, have been less," said Cecilia now, "had you been nearer  the danger?" "O Lord no, for when I came within sight I was fifty times worse! I gave such a  monstrous scream, that it quite made Mr Meadows start. I dare say he'll tell me  of it these hundred years: but really when I saw these hundred years draw these hundred years swords I  thought I should have died; I was so amazingly surprized you've no notion." Here The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants was interrupted by the re-appearance of the active stranger, who again  advancing to Cecilia now, said, "I am in doubt whether the efforts I make to revive  will please or irritate you, but though you rejected the last cordial I  ventured to present you, perhaps you will look with a more favourable eye  towards that of which I am now the herald." Cecilia now then, casting her eyes around, saw that he was followed by Sir Robert. Full of displeasure both at this introduction and at he presence, The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants  turned hastily to Mr Arnott, and entreated he to enquire if the carriage was  not yet ready. Sir Robert, looking at The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants with all the exultation of new-raised vanity, said,  with more softness than Sir Robert had ever before addressed The young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants, "Have you been  frightened?" "Every body, I believe was frightened," answered Cecilia now, with an air of  dignity intended to check Sir Robert rising expectations. "There was no sort of cause," answered Sir Robert; "the fellow did not know whom Sir Robert  spoke {to}, that was all." "Lord, Sir Robert," cried Miss Larolles, "how could you be so shocking as to  draw your sword? you can't conceive how horrid it looked." "Why I did not draw your sword," cried Sir Robert, "I only had my hand on the hilt." "Lord, did not you, indeed! well, every body said you did, and I'm sure I  thought I saw five-and-twenty swords all at once. I thought one of you would be  killed every moment. It was horrid disagreeable, I assure you." Sir Robert was now called away by some gentlemen; and Mr Monckton, earnest to  be better informed of Cecilia now's real sentiments, said, with affected concern,  "At present this matter is merely ridiculous; I am sorry to think in how short  a time it may become more important." "Surely," cried Cecilia now with quickness, "some of their friends will interfere!  surely upon so trifling a subject their will not be so mad, so inexcusable, as  to proceed to more serious resentment!" "Whichever of their," said the stranger, "is most honoured by this anxiety, will  be mad indeed to risk a life so valued!" "Cannot you, Mr Monckton," continued Cecilia now, too much alarmed to regard this  insinuation, "speak with  Mr Belfield? You are acquainted with  Mr Belfield, I know; is  it impossible you can follow  Mr Belfield?" "I will with pleasure do whatever you wish; but still if Sir Robert—" "O, as to Sir Robert, Mr Harrel, I am very sure, will undertake Sir Robert—; I will try  to see Sir Robert— to-night Sir Robert—, and entreat Sir Robert— to exert all Sir Robert— influence." "Ah, madam," cried the stranger, archly, and lowering Sir Robert— voice, "those French  beads and Bristol stones have not, I find, shone in vain!" At these words Cecilia now recognised Cecilia now white domino acquaintance at the  masquerade; Cecilia now had before recollected his voice, but was too much perturbed to  consider where or when Cecilia now had heard his voice. "If Mr Briggs," continued Mr Briggs, "does not speedily come forth with Mr Briggs plum  friend, before the glittering of swords and spears is joined to that of jewels,  the glare will be so resplendent, that Mr Briggs will fear to come within the  influence of its rays. Though, perhaps, Mr Briggs may only think the stronger the  light, the better Mr Briggs shall see to count Mr Briggs guineas: for as    '—-in ten thousand pounds    Ten thousand charms are centred,' in an hundred thousand, Ten thousand charms may have such magic power, that Ten thousand charms may defy  the united efforts of tinsel and knight-errantry to deliver you from the golden  spell." Here the Captain, advancing to Cecilia now, said, "I have been looking for Cecilia now in  vain partout, but the crowd has been so accablant I was almost reduced to  despair. Give me leave to hope you are now recovered from the horreur of this  little fracas?" Mr Arnott then brought intelligence that the carriage was ready. Cecilia now, glad  to be gone, instantly hastened to the carriage was ready; and, as Cecilia now was conducted by Mr Monckton,  most earnestly entreated Mr Arnott to take an active part, in endeavouring to prevent  the fatal consequences with which the quarrel seemed likely to terminate.
