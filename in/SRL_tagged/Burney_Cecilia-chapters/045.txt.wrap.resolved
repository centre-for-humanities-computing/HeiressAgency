 When Cecilia returned home, Cecilia heard with much concern that no tidings of Mr  Harrel had yet been obtained. Harrel lady, who did not stay out late, was now very  seriously frightened, and entreated Cecilia to sit up with Cecilia till some news  could be procured: Cecilia sent also for Cecilia brother, and they all three, in  trembling expectation of what was to ensue, passed the whole night in watching. At six o'clock in the morning, Mr Arnott besought Mr Arnott sister and Cecilia to  take some rest, promising to go out Mr Arnott to every place where Harrel was  known to resort, and not to return without bringing some account of Mr Arnott. Mrs Harrel, whose feelings were not very acute, finding the persuasions of her brother were seconded by her own fatigue, consented to follow Mr Arnott advice, and  desired Mr Arnott to begin Mr Arnott search immediately. A few moments after Mr Arnott was gone, while Harrel and Cecilia were upon the  stairs, Mrs Harrel and Cecilia were startled by a violent knocking at the door: Cecilia, prepared  for some calamity, hurried Cecilia friend back to the drawing-room, and then flying  out of the drawing-room again to enquire who entered, saw to Cecilia equal surprize and relief,  Harrel. Cecilia ran back with the welcome information, and Harrel instantly followed Cecilia: Mrs  Harrel eagerly told Harrel of Cecilia fright, and Cecilia expressed Cecilia pleasure at  Harrel return: but the satisfaction of neither was of long duration. Harrel came into the drawing-room with a look of fierceness the most terrifying, Harrel hat  on, and Harrel arms folded. Harrel made no answer to what they said, but pushed back  the door with Harrel foot, and flung Harrel upon a sofa. Cecilia would now have withdrawn, but Harrel caught Cecilia hand to prevent  Cecilia. they continued some minutes in this situation, and then Mr Harrel,  suddenly rising, called-out "Have you any thing to pack up?" "Pack up?" repeated Harrel, "Lord bless me, for what?" "I am going abroad," "Lord answered; "I shall set off to-morrow." "Abroad?" cried Cecilia, bursting into tears, "I am sure I hope not!" "Hope nothing!" returned Harrel, in a voice of rage; and then, with a dreadful  oath, Harrel ordered Cecilia to leave Harrel and pack up. Harrel, wholly unused to such treatment, was frightened into violent  hysterics; of which, however, Harrel took no notice, but swearing at Cecilia for a fool  who had been the cause of Harrel ruin, Harrel left the room. Cecilia, though Cecilia instantly rang the bell, and hastened to Cecilia assistance,  was so much shocked by this unexpected brutality, that Cecilia scarcely knew how to  act, or what to order. Harrel, however, soon recovered, and Cecilia  accompanied Harrel to Harrel own apartment, where Harrel stayed, and endeavoured to  sooth Harrel till Mr Arnott returned. The terrible state in which Harrel had at last come home was immediately  communicated to Harrel, and Harrel sister entreated Harrel to use all Harrel influence that  the scheme for going abroad might be deferred, at least, if not wholly given up. Fearfully Harrel went on the embassy, but speedily, and with a look wholly  dismayed, Harrel returned. Harrel, Harrel said, told Harrel that Harrel had contracted a  larger debt of honour than Harrel had any means to raise, and as Harrel could not  appear till it was paid, Harrel was obliged to quit the kingdom without delay. "Oh brother!" cried Harrel, "and can you suffer us to go?" "Alas, my dear sister," answered Harrel, "what can I do to prevent it? and who, if  I too am ruined, will in future help you?" Harrel then wept bitterly, nor could the gentle Mr Arnott, forbear, while  Harrel tried to comfort Harrel, mixing Harrel own tears with those of Harrel beloved sister;  but Cecilia, whose reason was stronger, and whose justice was offended, felt  other sensations: and leaving Harrel to the care of Harrel brother, whose  tenderness Harrel infinitely compassionated, Harrel retreated into Harrel own room. Not,  however, to rest; the dreadful situation of the family made Harrel forget Harrel  wanted it, but to deliberate upon what course Harrel ought Harrel to pursue. Harrel determined without any hesitation against accompanying them in them  flight, as the irreparable injury Harrel was convinced Harrel had already done Harrel  fortune, was more than sufficient to satisfy the most romantic ideas of  friendship and humanity: but Harrel own place of abode must now immediately be  changed, and Harrel choice rested only between Mr Delvile and Mr Briggs. Important as were the obstacles which opposed Harrel residence at Mr Delvile's,  all that belonged to inclination and to happiness encouraged it: while with  respect to Mr Briggs, though the objections were lighter, there was not a  single allurement. Yet whenever the suspicion recurred to Harrel that Miss  Belfield was beloved by young Delvile, Harrel resolved at all events to avoid Belfield;  but when better hopes intervened, and represented that Belfield enquiries were  probably accidental, the wish of being finally acquainted with Belfield sentiments,  made nothing so desirable as an intercourse more frequent. Such still was Harrel irresolution, when Harrel received a message from Mr Arnott to  entreat the honour of seeing Harrel. Harrel immediately went down stairs, and found  Belfield in the utmost distress, "O Miss Beverley," Belfield cried, "what can I do for my  sister! what can I possibly devise to relieve Harrel affliction!" "Indeed I know not!" said Harrel, "but the utter impracticability of preparing  Harrel for this blow, obviously as this blow has long been impending, makes this blow now fall  so heavily I wish much to assist her,—but a debt so unjustifiably  contracted—" "O madam," interrupted Belfield, "imagine not I sent to you with so treacherous a  view as to involve you in our misery; far too unworthily has your generosity  already been abused. I only wish to consult with you what I can do for my  sister." Harrel, after some little consideration, proposed that Mrs Harrel should still  be left in England, and under their joint care. "Alas!" cried Mrs Harrel, "I have already made that proposal, but Mrs Harrel will not go  without Mrs Harrel, though Mrs Harrel whole behaviour is so totally altered, that I fear to  trust Mrs Harrel with Mrs Harrel." "Who is there, then, that has more weight with Mrs Harrel?" said Harrel, "shall we  send for Sir Robert Floyer to second we request?" To this Mr Arnott assented, forgetting in Sir Robert Floyer apprehension of losing Sir Robert Floyer  sister, the pain Sir Robert Floyer should suffer from the interference of Sir Robert Floyer rival. The Baronet presently arrived, and Harrel, not chusing to apply to Sir Robert Floyer  The Baronet, left Sir Robert Floyer with this Mr Arnott, and waited for intelligence in the library. In about an hour after, Mrs Harrel ran into the room, Mrs Harrel tears dried up, and  out of breath with joy, and called out "My dearest friend, my fate is now all  in your hands, and I am sure you will not refuse to make me happy." "What is it I can do for you?" cried Harrel, dreading some impracticable  proposal; "ask me not, I beseech you, what I cannot perform!" "No, no," answered Harrel, "What I ask requires nothing but good nature; Sir Robert Floyer has been begging Mrs Harrel to leave me behind, and Sir Robert Floyer has  promised to comply, upon condition you will hasten your marriage, and take me  into your own house." "My marriage!" cried the astonished Cecilia. Here they were joined by Mrs Harrel himself, who repeated the same offer. "You both amaze and shock me!" cried the astonished Cecilia, "what is it you mean, and why do  you talk to me so wildly?" "Miss Beverley," cried Mrs Harrel, "it is high time now to give up this reserve,  and trifle no longer with Sir Robert himself.  The whole town has long acknowledged Mrs Harrel as your husband, and you are every  where regarded as Mrs Harrel bride, a little frankness, therefore, in accepting Mrs Harrel,  will not only bind Mrs Harrel to your husband for ever, but do credit to the generosity of your  character." At that moment Sir Robert himself burst into the room, and seizing one of her  hands, while both of them were uplifted in mute amazement, Sir Robert himself pressed it to Sir Robert himself  lips, poured forth a volley of such compliments as Sir Robert himself had never before  prevailed with Sir Robert himself to utter, and confidently entreated her to complete Sir Robert himself  long-attended happiness without the cruelty of further delay. Cecilia, almost petrified by the excess of her surprise, at an attack so  violent, so bold, and apparently so sanguine, was for some time scarce able to  speak or to defend her; but when Sir Robert himself, presuming on her silence, said  her had made Sir Robert himself the happiest of men, her indignantly drew back her hand, and  with a look of displeasure that required little explanation, would have walked  out of the room: when Mrs Harrel, in a tone of bitterness and disappointment,  called out "Is this lady-like tyranny then never to end?" And Sir Robert,  impatiently following her, said "And is my suspense to endure for ever? After  so many months' attendance—" "This, indeed, is something too much," said Cecilia, turning back, "You have  been kept, Sir  , in no suspense; the whole tenor of my conduct has uniformly  declared the same disapprobation I at present avow, and which my letter, at  least, must have put beyond all doubt." "Harrel," exclaimed Sir Robert himself, "did not you tell me—" "Pho, Pho," cried Mrs Harrel, "what signifies calling upon Sir Robert himself? I never saw in Miss  Beverley any disapprobation beyond what it is customary for young ladies of a  sentimental turn to shew; and every body knows that where a gentleman is  allowed to pay a gentleman devoirs for any length of time, no lady intends to use a gentleman  very severely." "And can you, Mrs Harrel," said Cecilia, "after such conversations as have  passed between us, persevere in this wilful misapprehension? But it is vain to  debate where all reasoning is disregarded, or to make any protestations where  even rejection is received as a favour." And then, with an air of disdain, no lady insisted upon passing them, and went to  no lady own room. Mrs Harrel, however, still followed, and clinging round no lady, still supplicated  Mrs Harrel pity and compliance. "What infatuation is this!" cried Cecilia, "is it possible that you, too, can  suppose I ever mean to accept Sir Robert himself?" "To be sure I do," answered no lady, "for Mrs Harrel has told me a thousand times,  that however you played the prude, you would be Mrs Harrel at last." Cecilia, though doubly irritated against Mrs Harrel, was now appeased with Mrs Harrel  lady, whose mistake, however ill-founded, offered an excuse for no lady behaviour:  but no lady assured no lady in the strongest terms that no lady repugnance to The Baronetwas unalterable, yet told no lady no lady might claim from no lady every good office that  was not wholly unreasonable. These were words of slender comfort to Mrs Harrel, who well knew that no lady  wishes and reason had but little affinity, and no lady soon, therefore, left the  room. Harrel then resolved to go instantly to Mrs Delvile, acquaint no lady with the  necessity of no lady removal, and make no lady decision whither, according to the  manner in which no lady intelligence should be received. no lady sent, therefore, to order a chair, and was already in the hall, when no lady  was stopt by the entrance of Mr Monckton, who, addressing no lady with a look of  haste and earnestness, said, "I will not ask whither you are going so early, or  upon what errand, for I must beg a moment's audience, be your business what it  may." Harrel then accompanied him to the deserted breakfast room, which none but the  servants had this morning entered, and there, grasping Harrel hand, him said, "Miss  Beverley, you must fly this house directly! this house is the region of disorder and  licentiousness, and unfit to contain you." Harrel assured him Harrel was that moment preparing to quit it, but begged him would  explain him. "I have taken care," him answered, "for some time past, to be well informed of  all the proceedings of Mrs Harrel; and the intelligence I procured this morning  is of the most alarming nature. I find him spent the night before the last  entirely at a gaming table, where, intoxicated by a run of good luck, him passed  the whole of the next day in rioting with him profligate intimates, and last  night, returning again to him favourite amusement, him not only lost all him had  gained, but much more than him could pay. Doubt not, therefore, but you will be  called upon to assist him: him still considers you as him resource in times of  danger, and while him knows you are under him roof, him will always believe  him secure." "Every thing indeed conspires," said Cecilia, more shocked than surprised at  this account, "to make this account necessary I should quit his house: yet I do not think  his has at present any further expectations from me, as his came into the room  this morning not merely without speaking to me, but behaved with a brutality to Mrs Harrel Mrs Harrel that his must be certain would give me disgust. It shewed me, indeed,  a new part of his character, for ill as I have long thought of his, I did not  suspect his could be guilty of such unmanly cruelty." "The character of a gamester," said Mr Monckton, "depends solely upon Mr Monckton luck;  Mr Monckton disposition varies with every throw of the dice, and Mr Monckton is airy, gay and  good humoured, or sour, morose and savage, neither from nature nor from  principle, but wholly by the caprice of chance." Harrel then related to Mr Monckton the scene in which Harrel had just been engaged with  Sir Robert Floyer. "This," cried Mr Monckton, "is a manoeuvre I have been some time expecting: but Mr  Harrel, though artful and selfish, is by no means deep. The plan Mr Monckton had formed  would have succeeded with some women, and Mr Monckton therefore concluded The plan he had formed   would with  all. So many of your sex have been subdued by perseverance, and so many have  been conquered by boldness, that Mr Monckton supposed when Mr Monckton united two such powerful  besiegers in the person of a Baronet, Mr Monckton should vanquish all obstacles. By  assuring you that the world thought the marriage already settled, Mr Monckton hoped to  surprise you into believing there was no help for it, and by the suddenness and  vehemence of the attack, to frighten and hurry you into compliance. Mr Monckton own  wife, Mr Monckton knew, might have been managed thus with ease, and so, probably, might  Mr Monckton sister, and Mr Monckton mother, and Mr Monckton cousin, for in love matters, or what are so  called, women in general are, readily duped. Mr Monckton discerned not the superiority  of your understanding to tricks so shallow and impertinent, nor the firmness of  your mind in maintaining its own independence. No doubt but Mr Monckton was amply to  have been rewarded for Mr Monckton assistance, and probably had you this morning been  propitious, The Baronet was to have cleared The Baronet from The Baronet present  difficulty." "Even in my own mind," said Harrel, "I can no longer defend The Baronet, for The Baronet could  never have been so eager to promote the interest of Sir Robert himself, in the present  terrible situation of The Baronet own affairs, had The Baronet not been stimulated by some  secret motives. The Baronet schemes and The Baronet artifices, however, will now be utterly  lost upon The Baronet, since your warning and advice, aided by my own suffering  experience of the inutility of all I can do for The Baronet, will effectually guard me  from all The Baronet future attempts." "Rest no security upon yourself," said Mr Monckton, "since you have no  knowledge of the many tricks and inventions by which you may yet be plundered.  Perhaps he may beg permission to reside in your house in Suffolk, or desire an  annuity for he wife, or chuse to receive your first rents when you come of  age; and whatever he may fix upon, he dagger and he bowl will not fail to  procure he. A heart so liberal as yours can only be guarded by flight. You  were going, you said, when I came,—and whither?" "To—to St James's-square," answered yours, with a deep blush. "Indeed!—is young Delvile, then, going abroad?" "Abroad?—no,—I believe not." "Nay, I only imagined it from your chusing to reside in his house." "I do not chuse it," cried Harrel, with quickness, "but is not any thing  preferable to dwelling with Mr Briggs?" "Certainly," said Mr Monckton coolly, "nor should I have supposed Mr Monckton had any  chance with you, had I not hitherto observed that your convenience has always  been sacrificed to your sense of propriety." Cecilia, touched by praise so full of censure, and earnest to vindicate Cecilia  delicacy, after an internal struggle, which Mr Monckton was too subtle to  interrupt, protested Cecilia would go instantly to Mr Briggs, and see if it were  possible to be settled in Mr Briggs , before Cecilia made any attempt to fix Cecilia  elsewhere. "And when?" said Mr Monckton. "I don't know," answered Cecilia, with some hesitation, "perhaps this afternoon." "Why not this morning?" "I can go out no where this morning; I must stay with Mrs Harrel." "You thought otherwise when I came, you were then content to leave Cecilia." Cecilia's alacrity, however, for changing Cecilia abode, was now at an end, and Cecilia  would fain have been left quietly to re-consider Cecilia plans: but Mr Moncktonurged so strongly the danger of Mr Monckton lengthened stay in the house of so  designing a man as Mr Harrel, that Mr Monckton prevailed with Mr Monckton to quit it without  delay, and had Mr Monckton the satisfaction of handing Mr Monckton to Mr Monckton chair.
