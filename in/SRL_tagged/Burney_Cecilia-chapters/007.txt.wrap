 Several days passed on nearly in the same manner; the mornings were all spent  in gossipping, shopping and dressing, and the evenings were regularly  appropriated to public places, or large parties of company. Meanwhile Mr Arnott lived almost entirely in Portman Square; he slept, indeed,  at his own lodgings, but he boarded wholly with Mr Harrel, whose house he never  for a moment quitted till night, except to attend Cecilia and his sister in  their visitings and rambles. Mr Arnott was a young man of unexceptionable character, and of a disposition  mild, serious and benignant: his principles and blameless conduct obtained the  universal esteem of the world, but his manners, which were rather too precise,  joined to an uncommon gravity of countenance and demeanour, made his society  rather permitted as a duty, than sought as a pleasure. The charms of Cecilia had forcibly, suddenly and deeply penetrated his heart;  he only lived in her presence, away from her he hardly existed: the emotions  she excited were rather those of adoration than of love, for he gazed upon her  beauty till he thought her more than human, and hung upon her accents till all  speech seemed impertinent to him but her own. Yet so small were his  expectations of success, that not even to his sister did he hint at the  situation of his heart: happy in an easy access to her, he contented himself  with seeing, hearing and watching her, beyond which bounds he formed not any  plan, and scarce indulged any hope. Sir Robert Floyer, too, was a frequent visitor in Portman Square, where he  dined almost daily. Cecilia was chagrined at seeing so much of him, and  provoked to find herself almost constantly the object of his unrestrained  examination; she was, however, far more seriously concerned for Mrs Harrel,  when she discovered that this favourite friend of her husband was an  unprincipled spendthrift, and an extravagant gamester, for as he was the  inseparable companion of Mr Harrel, she dreaded the consequence both of his  influence and his example. She saw, too, with an amazement that daily increased, the fatigue, yet  fascination of a life of pleasure: Mr Harrel seemed to consider his own house  merely as an hotel, where at any hour of the night he might disturb the family  to claim admittance, where letters and messages might be left for him, where he  dined when no other dinner was offered him, and where, when he made an  appointment, he was to be met with. His lady, too, though more at home, was not  therefore more solitary; her acquaintance were numerous, expensive and idle,  and every moment not actually spent in company, was scrupulously devoted to  making arrangements for that purpose. In a short time Cecilia, who every day had hoped that the next would afford her  greater satisfaction, but who every day found the present no better than the  former, began to grow weary of eternally running the same round, and to sicken  at the irksome repetition of unremitting yet uninteresting dissipation. She saw  nobody she wished to see, as she had met with nobody for whom she could care;  for though sometimes those with whom she mixed appeared to be amiable, she knew  that their manners, like their persons, were in their best array, and therefore  she had too much understanding to judge decisively of their characters. But  what chiefly damped her hopes of forming a friendship with any of the new  acquaintance to whom she was introduced, was the observation she herself made  how ill the coldness of their hearts accorded with the warmth of their  professions; upon every first meeting, the civilities which were shewn her,  flattered her into believing she had excited a partiality that a very little  time would ripen into affection; the next meeting commonly confirmed the  expectation; but the third, and every future one, regularly destroyed it. She  found that time added nothing to their fondness, nor intimacy to their  sincerity; that the interest in her welfare which appeared to be taken at first  sight, seldom, with whatever reason, increased, and often without any, abated;  that the distinction she at first met with, was no effusion of kindness, but of  curiosity, which is scarcely sooner gratified than satiated; and that those who  lived always the life into which she had only lately been initiated, were as  much harassed with it as herself, though less spirited to relinquish, and more  helpless to better it, and that they coveted nothing but what was new, because  they had experienced the insufficiency of whatever was familiar. She began now to regret the loss she sustained in quitting the neighbourhood,  and being deprived of the conversation of Mr Monckton, and yet more earnestly  to miss the affection and sigh for the society of Mrs Charlton, the lady with  whom she had long and happily resided at Bury; for she was very soon compelled  to give up all expectation of renewing the felicity of her earlier years, by  being restored to the friendship of Mrs Harrel, in whom she had mistaken the  kindness of childish intimacy for the sincerity of chosen affection; and though  she saw her credulous error with mortification and displeasure, she regretted  it with tenderness and sorrow. "What, at last," cried she, "is human felicity,  who has tasted, and where is it to be found? If I, who, to others, seem marked  out for even a partial possession of it,—distinguished by fortune, caressed  by the world, brought into the circle of high life, and surrounded with  splendour, seek without finding it, yet losing, scarce know how I miss it!" Ashamed upon reflection to believe she was considered as an object of envy by  others, while repining and discontented herself, she determined no longer to be  the only one insensible to the blessings within her reach, but by projecting  and adopting some plan of conduct better suited to her taste and feelings than  the frivolous insipidity of her present life, to make at once a more spirited  and more worthy use of the affluence, freedom, and power which she possessed. A scheme of happiness at once rational and refined soon presented itself to her  imagination. She purposed, for the basis of her plan, to become mistress of her  own time, and with this view, to drop all idle and uninteresting acquaintance,  who, while they contribute neither to use nor pleasure, make so large a part of  the community, that they may properly be called the underminers of existence;  she could then shew some taste and discernment in her choice of friends, and  she resolved to select such only as by their piety could elevate her mind, by  their knowledge improve her understanding, or by their accomplishments and  manners delight her affections. This regulation, if strictly adhered to, would  soon relieve her from the fatigue of receiving many visitors, and therefore she  might have all the leisure she could desire for the pursuit of her favourite  studies, music and reading. Having thus, from her own estimation of human perfection, culled whatever was  noblest for her society, and from her own ideas of sedentary enjoyments  arranged the occupations of her hours of solitude, she felt fully satisfied  with the portion of happiness which her scheme promised to herself, and began  next to consider what was due from her to the world. And not without trembling did she then look forward to the claims which the  splendid income she was soon to possess would call upon her to discharge. A  strong sense of DUTY, a fervent desire to ACT RIGHT, were the ruling  characteristics of her mind: her affluence she therefore considered as a debt  contracted with the poor, and her independence as a tie upon her liberality to  pay it with interest. Many and various, then, soothing to her spirit and grateful to her sensibility,  were the scenes which her fancy delineated; now she supported an orphan, now  softened the sorrows of a widow, now snatched from iniquity the feeble trembler  at poverty, and now rescued from shame the proud struggler with disgrace. The  prospect at once exalted her hopes, and enraptured her imagination; she  regarded herself as an agent of Charity, and already in idea anticipated the  rewards of a good and faithful delegate; so animating are the designs of  disinterested benevolence! so pure is the bliss of intellectual philanthropy! Not immediately, however, could this plan be put in execution; the society she  meant to form could not be selected in the house of another, where, though to  some she might shew a preference, there were none she could reject: nor had she  yet the power to indulge, according to the munificence of her wishes, the  extensive generosity she projected: these purposes demanded a house of her own,  and the unlimited disposal of her fortune, neither of which she could claim  till she became of age. That period, however, was only eight months distant,  and she pleased herself with the intention of meliorating her plan in the  meantime, and preparing to put it in practice. But though, in common with all the race of still-expecting man, she looked for  that happiness in the time to come which the present failed to afford, she had  yet the spirit and good sense to determine upon making every effort in her  power to render her immediate way of life more useful and contented. Her first wish, therefore, now, was to quit the house of Mr Harrel, where she  neither met with entertainment nor instruction, but was perpetually mortified  by seeing the total indifference of the friend in whose society she had hoped  for nothing but affection. The will of her uncle, though it obliged her while under age to live with one  of her guardians, left her at liberty to chuse and to change amongst them  according to her wishes or convenience: she determined, therefore, to make a  visit herself to each of them, to observe their manners and way of life, and  then, to the best of her judgment, decide with which she could be most  contented: resolving, however, not to hint at her intention till it was ripe  for execution, and then honestly to confess the reasons of her retreat. She had acquainted them both of her journey to town the morning after her  arrival. She was almost an entire stranger to each of them, as she had not seen  Mr Briggs since she was nine years old, nor Mr Delvile within the time she  could remember. The very morning that she had settled her proceedings for the arrangement of  this new plan, she intended to request the use of Mrs Harrel's carriage, and to  make, without delay, the visits preparatory to her removal; but when she  entered the parlour upon a summons to breakfast, her eagerness to quit the  house gave way, for the present, to the pleasure she felt at the sight of Mr  Monckton, who was just arrived from Suffolk. She expressed her satisfaction in the most lively terms, and scrupled not to  tell him she had not once been so much pleased since her journey to town,  except at her first meeting with Mrs Harrel. Mr Monckton, whose delight was infinitely superior to her own, and whose joy in  seeing her was redoubled by the affectionate frankness of her reception,  stifled the emotions to which her sight gave rise, and denying himself the  solace of expressing his feelings, seemed much less charmed than herself at the  meeting, and suffered no word nor look to escape him beyond what could be  authorised by friendly civility. He then renewed with Mrs Harrel an acquaintance which had been formed before  her marriage, but which {he} had dropt when her distance from Cecilia, upon  whose account alone he had thought it worth cultivation, made it no longer of  use to him. She afterwards introduced her brother to him; and a conversation  very interesting to both the ladies took place, concerning several families  with which they had been formerly connected, as well as the neighbourhood at  large in which they had lately dwelt. Very little was the share taken by Mr Arnott in these accounts and enquiries;  the unaffected joy with which Cecilia had received Mr Monckton, had struck him  with a sensation of envy as involuntary as it was painful; he did not, indeed,  suspect that gentleman's secret views; no reason for suspicion was obvious, and  his penetration sunk not deeper than appearances; he knew, too, that he was  married, and therefore no jealousy occurred to him; but still she had smiled  upon him!—and he felt that to purchase for himself a smile of so much  sweetness, he would have sacrificed almost all else that was valuable to him  upon earth. With an attention infinitely more accurate, Mr Monckton had returned his  observations. The uneasiness of his mind was apparent, and the anxious  watchfulness of his eyes plainly manifested whence it arose. From a situation,  indeed, which permitted an intercourse the most constant and unrestrained with  such an object as Cecilia, nothing less could be expected, and therefore he  considered his admiration as inevitable; all that remained to be discovered,  was the reception it had met from his fair enslaver. Nor was he here long in  doubt; he soon saw that she was not merely free from all passion herself, but  had so little watched Mr Arnott as to be unconscious she had inspired any. Yet was his own serenity, though apparently unmoved, little less disturbed in  secret than that of his rival; he did not think him a formidable candidate, but  he dreaded the effects of intimacy, fearing she might first grow accustomed to  his attentions, and then become pleased with them. He apprehended, also, the  influence of his sister and of Mr Harrel in his favour; and though he had no  difficulty to persuade himself that any offer he might now make would be  rejected without hesitation, he knew too well the insidious properties of  perseverance, to see him, without inquietude, situated so advantageously. The morning was far advanced before he took leave, yet he found no opportunity  of discoursing with Cecilia, though he impatiently desired to examine into the  state of her mind, and to discover whether her London journey had added any  fresh difficulties to the success of his long-concerted scheme. But as Mrs  Harrel invited him to dinner, he hoped the afternoon would be more propitious  to his wishes. Cecilia, too, was eager to communicate to him her favourite project, and to  receive his advice with respect to its execution. She had long been used to his  counsel, and she was now more than ever solicitous to obtain it, because she  considered him as the only person in London who was interested in her welfare. He saw, however, no promise of better success when he made his appearance at  dinner time, for not only Mr Arnott was already arrived, but Sir Robert Floyer,  and he found Cecilia so much the object of their mutual attention, that he had  still less chance than in the morning of speaking to her unheard. Yet was he not idle; the sight of Sir Robert gave abundant employment to his  penetration, which was immediately at work, to discover the motive of his  visit: but this, with all his sagacity, was not easily decided; for though the  constant direction of his eyes towards Cecilia, proved, at least, that he was  not insensible of her beauty, his carelessness whether or not she was hurt by  his examination, the little pains he took to converse with her, and the  invariable assurance and negligence of his manners, seemed strongly to  demonstrate an indifference to the sentiments he inspired, totally incompatible  with the solicitude of affection. In Cecilia he had nothing to observe but what his knowledge of her character  prepared him to expect, a shame no less indignant than modest at the freedom  with which she saw herself surveyed. Very little, therefore, was the satisfaction which this visit procured him, for  soon after dinner the ladies retired; and as they had an early engagement for  the evening, the gentlemen received no summons to their tea-table. But he  contrived, before they quitted the room, to make an appointment for attending  them the next morning to a rehearsal of a new serious Opera. He stayed not after their departure longer than decency required, for too much  in earnest was his present pursuit, to fit him for such conversation as the  house in Cecilia's absence could afford him.
