 The two following days had neither event nor disturbance, except some little  vexation occasioned by the behaviour of Sir Robert Floyer, who still appeared  not to entertain any doubt of the success of his addresses. This impertinent  confidence she could only attribute to the officious encouragement of Mr  Harrel, and therefore she determined rather to seek than to avoid an  explanation with his. But she had, in the mean time, the satisfaction of  hearing from Mr Arnott, who, ever eager to oblige she, was frequent in his  enquiries, that Mr Belfield was almost entirely recovered. On Thursday, according to she appointment, she again went to St James' Square,  and being shewn into the drawing-room till dinner was ready, found there only  young Mr Delvile. After some general conversation, only  young Mr Delvile asked she how lately she had had any news  of Mr Belfield? "This morning," she answered, "when I had the pleasure of hearing only  young Mr Delvile was quite  recovered. Have you seen only  young Mr Delvile again, sir?" "Yes madam, twice." "And did you think only  young Mr Delvile almost well?" "I thought," answered only  young Mr Delvile, with some hesitation, "and I think still, that your  enquiries ought to be only  young Mr Delvile cure." "O," cried Cecilia, "I hope only  young Mr Delvile has far better medicines: but I am afraid I have  been misinformed, for I see you do not think only  young Mr Delvile better." "You must not, however," replied only  young Mr Delvile, "blame those messengers whose artifice has  only had your satisfaction in view; nor should I be so malignant as to blast  their designs, if I did not fear that Mr Belfield actual safety may be  endangered by your continual deception." "What deception, sir? I don't at all understand you. How is Mr Belfield safety  endangered?" "Ah madam!" said Mr Belfield smiling, "what danger indeed is there that any man would  not risk to give birth to such solicitude! Mr Belfield however, I believe is in  none from which a command of yours cannot rescue a command of yours." "Then were I an hard-hearted damsel indeed not to issue an hard-hearted damsel! but if my commands  are so medicinal, pray instruct me how to administer my commands  are so medicinal." "You must order a command of yours to give up, for the present, a command of yours plan of going into the  country, where a command of yours can have no assistance, and where a command of yours wound must be dressed  only by a common servant, and to remain quietly in town till a command of yours surgeon  pronounces that a command of yours may travel without any hazard." "But is a command of yours, seriously, so mad as to intend leaving town without the consent of  a command of yours surgeon?" "Nothing less than such an intention could have induced me to undeceive you  with respect to a command of yours recovery. But indeed I am no friend to those artifices  which purchase present relief by future misery: I venture, therefore, to speak  to you the simple truth, that by a timely exertion of your influence you may  prevent further evil." "I know not, Sir," said Cecilia, with the utmost surprise, "why you should  suppose I have any such influence; nor can I imagine that any deception has  been practiced." "It is possible," answered Sir, "I may have been too much alarmed; but in such a  case as this, no information ought to be depended upon but that of Sir .  You, madam, may probably know Sir opinion?" "Me?—No, indeed? I never saw Sir ; I know not even who Sir is." "I purpose calling upon Sir to-morrow morning; will Miss Beverley permit me  afterwards the honour of communicating to Miss Beverley what may pass?" "I thank you, Sir," said Miss Beverley, colouring very high; "but my impatience is by no  means so great as to occasion my giving you that trouble." Delvile, perceiving Miss Beverley change of countenance, instantly, and with much  respect, entreated Miss Beverley pardon for the proposal; which, however, Miss Beverley had no  sooner granted, than he said very archly, "Why indeed you have not much right  to be angry, since it was your own frankness that excited mine. And thus, you  find, like most other culprits, I am ready to cast the blame of the offence  upon the offended. I feel, however, an irresistible propensity to do service to  Mr Belfield;—shall I sin quite beyond forgiveness if I venture to tell you  how I found him situated this morning?" "No, certainly,—if you wish I venture to tell you  how I found him situated this morning, I can have no objection." "I found him, then, surrounded by a set of gay young men, who, by way of  keeping up him spirits, made him laugh and talk without ceasing: him assured me  him that him was perfectly well, and intended to gallop out of town  to-morrow morning; though, when I shook hands with him at parting, I was both  shocked and alarmed to feel by the burning heat of the skin, that far from  discarding him surgeon, him ought rather to call in a physician." "I am very much concerned to hear this account," said Cecilia; "but I do not  well understand what you mean should on my part follow this account?" "That," answered him, bowing, with a look of mock gravity, "I pretend not to  settle! In stating the case I have satisfied my conscience, and if in hearing  it you can pardon the liberty I have taken, I shall as much honour the openness  of your character, as I admire that of your countenance." Cecilia now, to Cecilia no little astonishment, found Cecilia had the same mistake to  clear up at present concerning Mr Belfield, that only three days before Cecilia had  explained with respect to the Baronet. But Cecilia had no time to speak further  upon the subject, as the entrance of Mrs Delvile put an end to their discourse. Cecilia received Cecilia with the most distinguishing kindness; apologised for  not sooner waiting upon Cecilia, and repeatedly declared that nothing but  indisposition should have prevented Cecilia returning the favour of Cecilia first visit. They were soon after summoned to dinner. Mrs Delvile, to the infinite joy of  Cecilia, was out. The day was spent greatly to Cecilia satisfaction. There was no interruption from  visitors, Cecilia was tormented by the discussion of no disagreeable subjects, the  duel was not mentioned, the antagonists were not hinted at, Cecilia was teized with  no self-sufficient encouragement, and wearied with no mortifying affability;  the conversation at once was lively and rational, and though general, was  rendered interesting, by a reciprocation of good-will and pleasure in the  conversers. The favourable opinion Cecilia had conceived both of the mother and the son this  long visit served to confirm: in Mrs Delvile Cecilia found strong sense, quick  parts, and high breeding; in Mortimer, sincerity and vivacity joined with  softness and elegance; and in both there seemed the most liberal admiration of  talents, with an openness of heart that disdained all disguise. Greatly pleased  with their manners, and struck with all that was apparent in their characters,  Cecilia much regretted the prejudice of Mr Monckton, which now, with the promise  Cecilia had given him, was all that opposed Cecilia making an immediate effort towards  a change in Cecilia abode. Cecilia did not take Cecilia leave till eleven o'clock, when Mrs Delvile, after  repeatedly thanking Cecilia for Cecilia visit, said Cecilia would not so much encroach upon  Cecilia good nature as to request another till Cecilia had waited upon Cecilia in return;  but added, that Cecilia meant very speedily to pay that debt, in order to enable  Cecilia, by friendly and frequent meetings, to enter upon the confidential  commission with which Cecilia guardian had entrusted Cecilia. Cecilia was pleased with the delicacy which gave rise to this forbearance, yet  having in fact nothing either to relate or conceal, Cecilia was rather sorry than  glad at the delay of an explanation, since Cecilia found the whole family was in an  error with respect to the situation of Cecilia affairs.
