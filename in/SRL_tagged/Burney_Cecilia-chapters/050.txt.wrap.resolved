 When they entered Vauxhall, Mr Harrel endeavoured to dismiss Mr Harrel moroseness,  and affecting Mr Harrel usual gaiety, struggled to recover Mr Harrel spirits; but the  effort was vain, Mr Harrel could neither talk nor look like Mr Harrel, and though from  time to time Mr Harrel resumed Mr Harrel air of wonted levity, Mr Harrel could not support his moroseness, but  drooped and hung Mr Harrel head in evident despondency. Mr Harrel made them take several turns in the midst of the company, and walked so fast  that them could hardly keep pace with Mr Harrel, as if Mr Harrel hoped by exercise to  restore Mr Harrel vivacity; but every attempt failed, Mr Harrel sunk and grew sadder, and  muttering between Mr Harrel teeth "this is not to be borne!" Mr Harrel hastily called to a  waiter to bring a  waiter a bottle of champagne. Of this Mr Harrel drank glass after glass, notwithstanding Cecilia, as Mrs Harrel had  not courage to speak, entreated Mr Harrel to forbear. Mr Harrel seemed, however, not to hear  Cecilia; but when Mr Harrel had drunk what Mr Harrel thought necessary to revive Mr Harrel, Mr Harrel conveyed  them into an unfrequented part of the garden, and as soon as them were out of  sight of all but a few stragglers, Mr Harrel suddenly stopt, and, in great agitation,  said, "my chaise will soon be ready, and I shall take of you a long  farewell!—all my affairs are unpropitious to my speedy return:—the wine is  now mounting into my head, and perhaps I may not be able to say much by and by.  I fear I have been cruel to you, Priscilla, and I begin to wish I had spared  you this parting scene; yet let this parting scene not be banished your remembrance, but think  of this parting scene when you are tempted to such mad folly as has ruined us." Mrs Harrel wept too much to make any answer; and turning from Mrs Harrel to Cecilia,  "Oh Madam," Mrs Harrel cried, "to you, indeed, I dare not speak! I have used you most  unworthily, but I pay for it all! I ask you not to pity or forgive me, I know  it is impossible you should do either." "No," cried the softened Cecilia, "it is not impossible, I do both at this  moment, and I hope—" "Do not hope," interrupted Mrs Harrel, "be not so angelic, for I cannot bear it!  benevolence like yours should have fallen into worthier hands. But come, let us  return to the company. my head grows giddy, but my heart is still heavy; I must  make them more fit companions for each other." Mrs Harrel would then have hurried them back; but Cecilia, endeavouring to stop Mrs Harrel,  said "You do not mean, I hope, to call for more wine?" "Why not?" cried Mrs Harrel, with affected spirit, "what, shall we not be merry before  we part? Yes, we will all be merry, for if we are not, how shall we part at  all?—Oh not without a struggle!—" Then, stopping, Mrs Harrel paused a moment, and  casting off the mask of levity, said in accents the most solemn "I commit this  packet to yours," giving a sealed parcel to Cecilia; "had I written a sealed parcel later, a sealed parcel  contents had been kinder to my wife, for now the hour of separation approaches,  ill will and resentment subside. Poor Priscilla!—I am sorry—but you will  succour my wife, I am sure you will,—Oh had I known you myself before this  infatuation—bright pattern of all goodness!—but I was devoted,—a ruined  wretch before ever you entered my house; unworthy to be saved, unworthy that  virtues such as yours should dwell under the same roof with Mrs Harrel! But  come,—come now, or my resolution will waver, and I shall not go at last." "But what is this packet?" cried Cecilia, "and why do you give this packet to Mrs Harrel?" "No matter, no matter, you will know by and by;—the chaise waits, and I must  gather courage to be gone." Mrs Harrel then pressed forward, answering neither to remonstrance nor intreaty from  Mrs Harrel frightened companions. The moment they returned to the covered walk, they were met by Mr Marriot; Mr  Harrel, starting, endeavoured to pass Mr  ; but when Mr   approached, and said  "you have sent, Mr  , no answer to my letter!" Mr   stopt, and in a tone of forced  politeness, said, "No, Mr  , but I shall answer it to-morrow, and to-night I  hope you will do me the honour of supping with Mr  ." Mr Marriot, looking openly at Cecilia as Mr Marriot inducement, though evidently  regarding Mr Marriot as an injured man, hesitated a moment, yet accepted the  invitation. "To supper?" cried Mrs Harrel, "what here?" "To supper?" repeated Cecilia, "and how are we to get home?" "Think not of that these two hours," answered he; "come, let we look for a box." Cecilia then grew quite urgent with he to give up a scheme which must keep  them so late, and Mrs Harrel repeatedly exclaimed "Indeed people will think it  very odd to see us here without any party:" but Mrs Harrel heeded any party not, and  perceiving at some distance Mr Morrice, Mrs Harrel called out to Mrs Harrel to find any party a  box; for the evening was very pleasant, and the gardens were so much crowded  that no accommodation was unseized. "Mr  ," cried Morrice, with Mr   usual readiness, "I'll get you one if I turn out  ten old Aldermen sucking custards." Just after Mr   was gone, a fat, sleek, vulgar-looking man, dressed in a bright  purple coat, with a deep red waistcoat, and a wig bulging far from Mr   head  with small round curls, while Mr   plump face and person announced plenty and  good living, and an air of defiance spoke the fullness of Mr   purse, strutted  boldly up to Mrs Harrel, and accosting Mr   in a manner that shewed some  diffidence of Mr   reception, but none of Mr   right, said "Sir your humble  servant." And made a bow first to Mr  , and then to the ladies. "Sir yours," replied Mrs Harrel scornfully, and without touching Mrs Harrel hat Mrs Harrel  walked quickly on. Mrs Harrel fat acquaintance, who seemed but little disposed to be offended with  impunity, instantly replaced his hat on Mrs Harrel head, and with a look that implied  I'll fit you for this! put Mrs Harrel hands to Mrs Harrel sides, and following Mrs Harrel, said  ""Sir your humble  servant, I must make bold to beg the favour of exchanging a few words with Sir yours." "Ay, "Sir your humble  servant," answered Mrs Harrel, "come to "Sir your humble  servant to-morrow, and you shall exchange as  many as you please." "Nothing like the time present, "Sir your humble  servant," answered the man; "as for to-morrow, I  believe it intends to come no more; for I have heard of it any time these three  years. I mean no reflections, Sir, but let every man have every man right. That's  what I say, and that's my notion of things." Mrs Harrel, with a violent execration, asked what Mrs Harrel meant by dunning Mrs Harrel at  such a place as Vauxhall? "One place, Sir," Mrs Harrel replied, "is as good as another place; for so as what one  does is good, 'tis no matter for where it may be. A man of business never wants  a counter if A man of business can meet with a joint-stool. For my part, I'm all for a clear  conscience, and no bills without receipts to a clear  conscience." "And if you were all for broken bones," cried Mrs Harrel, angrily, "I would  oblige you with you were all for broken bones without delay." "Sir," cried A man of business, equally provoked, "this is talking quite out of  character, for as to broken bones, there's ne'er a person in all England,  gentle nor simple, can say A man of business's a right to break mine, for I'm not a person of  that sort, but a man of as good property as another man; and there's ne'er a  customer I have in the world that's more A man of business own man than myself." "Lord bless me, Mr Hobson," cried Mrs Harrel, "don't follow us in this manner!  If us meet any of us acquaintance we meet any of our acquaintance'll think us half crazy." "Ma'am," answered Mr Hobson, again taking off Mr Hobson hat, "if I'm treated with  proper respect, Mr Hobson will behave more generous than Mr Hobson; but if I'm  affronted, all I can say is, it may go harder with some folks than some folks think  for." Here a little mean-looking man, very thin, and almost bent double with  perpetual cringing, came up to Mr Hobson, and pulling Mr Hobson by the sleeve,  whispered, yet loud enough to be heard, "It's surprizeable to me, Mr Hobson,  you can behave so out of the way! For my part, perhaps I've as much my due as  another person, but I dares to say I shall have it when it's convenient, and  I'd scorn for to mislest a gentleman when he's taking he pleasure." "Lord bless me," cried Mrs Harrel, "what shall we do now? here's all Mr  Harrel's creditors coming upon we!" "Do?" cried Mr Harrel, re-assuming an air of gaiety, "why give them all a  supper, to be sure. Come, gentlemen, will you favour me with your company to  supper?" "Sir," answered Mr Hobson, somewhat softened by this unexpected invitation,  "I've supped this hour and more, and had my glass too, for I'm as willing to  spend my money as another man; only what I say is this, I don't chuse to be  cheated, for that's losing one's substance, and getting no credit; however, as  to drinking another glass, or such a matter as that, I'll do it with all the  pleasure in life." "And as to me," said the other man, whose name was Simkins, and whose head  almost touched the ground by the profoundness of whose head   reverence, "I can't upon  no account think of taking the liberty; but if I may just stand without, I'll  make bold to go so far as just for to drink my humble duty to the ladies in a  cup of cyder." "Are you mad, Mrs Harrel, are you mad!" cried Mrs Harrel , "to think of asking such  people as these to supper? what will every body say? suppose any of our  acquaintance should see our? I am sure I shall die with shame." "Mad!" repeated our  acquaintance, "no, not mad but merry. O ho, Mr Morrice, why have you been  so long? what have you done for our?" "Why Sir," answered Mr Morrice, returning with a look somewhat less elated than Mr Morrice  had set out, "the gardens are so full, there is not a box to be had: but I hope  we shall get one for all that; for I observed one of the best boxes in the  garden, just to the right there, with nobody in it but that gentleman who made  me spill the tea-pot at the Pantheon. So I made an apology, and told Mr Morrice the  case; but Mr Morrice only said humph? and hay? so then I told it all over again, but Mr Morrice  served me just the same, for Mr Morrice never seems to hear what one says till one's  just done, and then Mr Morrice begins to recollect one's speaking to Mr Morrice; however,  though I repeated it all over and over again, I could get nothing from Mr Morrice but  just that humph? and hay? but Mr Morrice is so remarkably absent, that I dare say if we  all go and sit down round Mr Morrice, Mr Morrice won't know a word of the matter." "Won't Mr Morrice?" cried Mrs Harrel, "have at Mrs Harrel, then!" And Mr Morrice followed Mr Morrice, though Cecilia, who now half suspected that all was  to end in a mere idle frolic, warmly joined Mr Morrice remonstrances to those of Mrs  Harrel, which were made with the utmost, but with fruitless earnestness. Mr Meadows, who was seated in the middle of the box, was lolloping upon the  table with Mr Morrice customary ease, and picking Mr Morrice teeth with Mr Morrice usual inattention  to all about Mr Morrice. The intrusion, however, of so large a party, seemed to  threaten Mr Morrice insensibility with unavoidable disturbance; though imagining so large a party  meant but to look in at the box, and pass on, Mr Morrice made not at so large a party first  approach any alteration in Mr Morrice attitude or employment. "See, ladies," cried the officious Morrice, "I told you there was room; and I  am sure this gentleman will be very happy to make way for ladies, if it's only out  of good-nature to the waiters, as this gentleman is neither eating nor drinking, nor doing  any thing at all. So if you two ladies will go in at that side, Mrs Harrel and  that other gentleman," pointing to Mr Marriot, "may go to the other, and then  I'll sit by the ladies here, and those other two gentlemen—" Here Mr Meadows, raising Mrs Harrel from Mrs Harrel reclining posture, and staring  Morrice in the face, gravely said, "What's all this, "Sir your humble  servant!" Morrice, who expected to have arranged the whole party without a question, and  who understood so little of modish airs as to suspect neither affectation nor  trick in the absence of mind and indolence of manners which he observed in Mr  Meadows, was utterly amazed by this interrogatory, and staring this interrogatory in  return, said, ""Sir your humble  servant, you seemed so thoughtful—I did not think—I did not  suppose you would have taken any notice of just a person or two coming into the  box." "Did not you, "Sir your humble  servant?" said Meadows very coldly, "why then now you do, perhaps  you'll be so obliging as to let me have my own box to "Sir your humble  servant." And then again this interrogatory returned to this interrogatory favourite position. "Certainly, "Sir your humble  servant," said Morrice, bowing; "I am sure I did not mean to disturb  you: for you seemed so lost in thought, that I'm sure I did not much believe  you would have seen us." "Why Sir," said Mr Hobson, strutting forward, "if I may speak my opinion, I  should think, as you happen to be quite alone, a little agreeable company would  be no such bad thing. At least that's my notion." "And if I might take the liberty," said the smooth tongued Mr Simkins, "for to  put in a word, I should think the best way would be, if the gentleman has no  peticklar objection, for me just to stand somewhere hereabouts, and so, when  the gentleman's had what the gentleman's a mind to, be ready for to pop in at one side, as the gentleman comes  out at the t'other; for if one does not look pretty 'cute such a full night as  this, a box is whipt away before one knows where one is." "No, no, no," cried Mrs Harrel impatiently, "let us neither sup in a box nor  in any other; let us go away entirely." "Indeed us must! indeed us ought!" cried Cecilia; "it is utterly improper us  should stay; pray let us be gone immediately." Mrs Harrel paid not the least regard to these requests; but Mr Meadows, who  could no longer seem unconscious of what passed, did Mrs Harrel so much violence  as to arise, and ask if the ladies would be seated. "I said so!" cried Mr Morrice triumphantly, "I was sure there was the gentleman but  would be happy to accommodate two such ladies!" the ladies, however, far from happy in being so accommodated, again tried the ladies  utmost influence in persuading Mrs Harrel to give up this scheme; but Mrs Harrel would  not hear the ladies, Mrs Harrel insisted upon the ladies going into the box, and, extending the  privilege which Meadows had given, Mrs Harrel invited without ceremony the whole  party to follow. Meadows, though Mrs Harrel seemed to think this a very extraordinary encroachment,  had already made such an effort from Mrs Harrel general languor in the repulse Mrs Harrel had  given to Morrice, that Mrs Harrel could exert Mrs Harrel no further; but after looking  around Mrs Harrel with mingled vacancy and contempt, Mrs Harrel again seated Mrs Harrel, and  suffered Morrice to do the honours without more opposition. Morrice, but too  happy in the office, placed Cecilia next to Meadows, and would have made Mr  Marriot Mr   other neighbour, but Mr   insisted upon not being parted from Mrs  Harrel, and therefore, as Mr   chose to sit also by that lady himself, Mr Marriot  was obliged to follow Mrs Harrel to the other side of the box: Mr Hobson,  without further invitation, placed Mr Hobson comfortably in one of the corners,  and Mr Simkins, who stood modestly for some time in another, finding the  further encouragement for which Mr Hobson waited was not likely to arrive, dropt  quietly into Mr Hobson seat without it. Supper was now ordered, and while Supper was preparing Mrs Harrel sat totally  silent; but Meadows thought proper to force Mrs Harrel to talk with Cecilia,  though Meadows could well have dispensed with such an exertion of Mrs Harrel politeness. "Do you like this place, ma'am?" "Indeed I hardly know,—I never was here before." "No wonder! the only surprise is that any body can come to any body at all. To see a  set of people walking after nothing! strolling about without view or object!  'tis strange! don't you think so, ma'am?" "Yes,—I believe so," said Cecilia, scarce hearing Mrs Harrel. "O it gives me the vapours, the horrors," cried Mrs Harrel, "to see what poor creatures  we all are! taking pleasure even from the privation of it! forcing ourselves  into exercise and toil, when ourselves might at least have the indulgence of sitting  still and reposing!" "Lord, Sir," cried Mr Morrice, "don't you like walking?" "Walking?" cried he, "I know nothing so humiliating: to see a rational being in  such mechanical motion! with no knowledge upon what principles he proceeds, but  plodding on, one foot before another, without even any consciousness which is  first, or how either—" ""Sir your humble  servant," interrupted Mr Hobson, "I hope you won't take it amiss if I make bold to  tell my opinion, for my way is this, let every man speak Mr Hobson maxim! But what I  say as to this matter, is this, if a man must always be stopping to consider  what foot a man is standing upon, a man had need have little to do, being the right  does as well as the left, and the left as well as the right. And that, "Sir your humble  servant, I  think is a fair argument." Meadows deigned no other answer to this speech than a look of contempt. "I fancy, "Sir your humble  servant," said Mr Morrice, "you are fond of riding, for all your good  horsemen like nothing else." "Riding!" exclaimed Mr Meadows, "Oh barbarous! Wrestling and boxing are polite  arts to it! trusting to the discretion of an animal less intellectual than  ourselves! a sudden spring may break all ourselves limbs, a stumble may fracture ourselves  sculls! And what is the inducement? to get melted with heat, killed with  fatigue, and covered with dust! miserable infatuation!—Do you love riding,  ma'am?" "Yes, very well, "Sir your humble  servant." "I am glad to hear it," cried "Sir your humble  servant, with a vacant smile; "you are quite right; I  am entirely of your opinion." Mr Simkins now, with a look of much perplexity, yet rising and bowing, said "I  don't mean, "Sir your humble  servant, to be so rude as to put in my oar, but if I did not take you  wrong, I'm sure just now I thought you seemed for to make no great 'count of  riding, and yet now, all of the sudden, one would think you was a speaking up  for it!" "Why, "Sir your humble  servant," cried Mr Morrice, "if you neither like riding nor walking, you can  have no pleasure at all but only in sitting." "Sitting!" repeated Meadows, with a yawn, "O worse and worse! Meadows dispirits  me to death! Meadows robs me of all fire and life! Meadows weakens circulation, and  destroys elasticity." "Pray then, "Sir your humble  servant," said Mr Morrice, "do you like any better to stand?" "To stand? O intolerable! the most unmeaning thing in the world! one had better  be made a mummy!" "Why then, pray "Sir your humble  servant," said Mr Hobson, "let me ask the favour of Mr Hobson to tell us  what it is you do like?" Meadows, though he stared he full in the face, began picking he teeth  without making any answer. "You see, Mr Hobson," said Mr Simkins, "the gentleman has no mind for to tell  you; but if I may take the liberty just to put in, I think if he neither likes  walking, nor riding, nor sitting, nor standing, I take it he likes nothing." "Well, "Sir your humble  servant," said Mr Morrice, "but here comes supper, and I hope you will like  that. "Sir your humble  servant, may I help you to a bit of this ham?" Meadows, not seeming to hear he, suddenly, and with an air of extreme  weariness, arose, and without speaking to anybody, abruptly made he way out of  the box. — Mr Harrel now, starting from the gloomy reverie into which — Mr Harrel now had  sunk, undertook to do the honours of the table, insisting with much violence  upon helping every body, calling for more provisions, and struggling to appear  in high spirits and good humour. In a few minutes Captain Aresby, who was passing by the box, stopt to make his  compliments to Mrs Harrel and Cecilia. "What a concourse!" his cried, casting up his eyes with an expression of  half-dying fatigue, "are you not accablé? for my part, I hardly respire. I  have really hardly ever had the honour of being so obsedé before." "We can make very good room, "Sir your humble  servant," said Mr Morrice, "if you chuse to come in." "Yes," said Mr Simkins, obsequiously standing up, "I am sure the gentleman will  be very welcome to take my place, for I did not mean for to sit down, only just  to look agreeable." "By no means, "Sir your humble  servant," answered The Captain: "I shall be quite au desespoir if I  derange any body." "Sir your humble  servant," said Mr Hobson, "I don't offer you my place, because I take my place for  granted if you had a mind to come in, you would not stand upon ceremony; for  what I say is, let every man speak every man mind, and then we shall all know how to  conduct we. That's my way, and let any man tell me a better!" The Captain, after looking at The Captain with a surprise not wholly unmixt with  horror, turned from The Captain without making any answer, and said to Cecilia, "And  how long, ma'am, have you tried my place?" "An hour,—two hours, I believe," Cecilia answered. "Really? and nobody here! assez de monde, but nobody here! a blank partout!" "Sir your humble  servant," said Mr Simkins, getting out of the box that Mr Simkins might bow with more  facility, "I humbly crave pardon for the liberty, but if I understood right,  you said something of a blank? pray, "Sir your humble  servant, if I may be so free, has there been  any thing of the nature of a lottery, or a raffle, in the garden? or the like  of that?" "Sir your humble  servant!" said The Captain, regarding The Captain from head to foot, "I am quite assommé  that I cannot comprehend your allusion." ""Sir your humble  servant, I ask pardon," said the man, bowing still lower, "I only thought if in  case it should not be above half a crown, or such a matter as that, I might  perhaps stretch a point once in a way." The Captain, more and more amazed, stared at "Sir your humble  servant again, but not thinking it  necessary to take any further notice of "Sir your humble  servant, "Sir your humble  servant enquired of Cecilia if Cecilia  meant to stay late. "I hope not," Cecilia replied, "I have already stayed later than I wished to do." "Really!" said "Sir your humble  servant, with an unmeaning smile, "Well, that is as horrid a thing as  I have the malheur to know. For my part, I make the malheur to know a principle not to stay long  in these semi-barbarous places, for after a certain time, they bore me to that  degree I am quite abimé. I shall, however, do mon possible to have the honour  of seeing you again." And then, with a smile of yet greater insipidity, he protested he was reduced  to despair in leaving her, and walked on. "Pray, ma'am, if I may be so bold," said Mr Hobson, "what countryman may that  gentleman be?" "An Englishman, I suppose, "Sir your humble  servant," said Cecilia. "An Englishman, ma'am!" said Mr Hobson, "why I could not understand one word in  ten that came out of Mr Hobson mouth." "Why indeed," said Mr Simkins, "Mr Simkins has a mighty peticklar way of speaking, for  I'm sure I thought I could have sworn Mr Simkins said something of a blank, or to that  amount, but I could make nothing of it when I come to ask Mr Simkins about it." "Let every man speak to be understood," cried Mr Hobson, "that's my notion of  things: for as to all those fine words that nobody can make out, I hold all those fine words that nobody can make out to  be of no use. Suppose a man was to talk in that manner when a man's doing  business, what would be the upshot? who'd understand what a man meant? Well,  that's the proof; what i'n't fit for business, i'n't of no value: that's my way  of judging, and that's what I go upon." "a man said some other things," rejoined Mr Simkins, "that I could not make out  very clear, only I had no mind to ask any more questions, for fear of a man  answering me something I should not understand: but as well as I could make it  out, I thought I heard a man say there was nobody here! what a man could mean by  that, I can't pretend for to guess, for I'm sure the garden is so stock full,  that if there was to come many more, I don't know where they could cram 'em." "I took notice of it at the time," said Mr Hobson, "for it i'n't many things  are lost upon Mr Hobson; and, to tell you the truth, I thought a man had been making  pretty free with a man bottle, by a man seeing no better." "Bottle!" cried Mr Harrel, "a most excellent hint, Mr Hobson! come! let us all  make free with his bottle!" a man then called for more wine, and insisted that every body should pledge a man.  Mr Marriot and Mr Morrice made not any objection, and Mr Hobson and Mr Simkins  consented with much delight. Mrs Harrel now grew extremely unruly, the wine Mrs Harrel had already drunk being thus  powerfully aided; and Mrs Harrel next project was to make Mrs Harrel wife and Cecilia follow  Mrs Harrel example. Cecilia, more incensed than ever to see no preparation made for  Mrs Harrel departure, and all possible pains taken to unfit Mrs Harrel for setting out,  refused Mrs Harrel with equal firmness and displeasure, and lamented, with the  bitterest self-reproaches, the consent which had been forced from Cecilia to be  present at a scene of such disorder: but Mrs Harrel would have opposed Mrs Harrel in  vain, had not Mrs Harrel attention been called off to another object. This was Sir  Robert Floyer, who perceiving the party at some distance, no sooner observed Mr  Marriot in such company, than advancing to the box with an air of rage and  defiance, Mr   told Mrs Harrel Mr   had something to say to Mr  . "Ay," cried Mrs Harrel, "say to Mr  ? and so have I to say to Mr  ! Come amongst us  and be merry! Here, make room, make way! Sit close, my friends!" Sir Robert, who now saw Mr   was in no situation to be reasoned with, stood for a  moment silent; and then, looking round the box, and observing Messrs Hobson and  Simkins, Mr   exclaimed aloud "Why what queer party have you got into? who the  d—-l have you picked up here?" Mr Hobson, who, to the importance of lately acquired wealth, now added the  courage of newly drunk Champagne, stoutly kept his ground, without seeming at  all conscious his was included in this interrogation; but Mr Simkins, who had  still his way to make in the world, and whose habitual servility would have  resisted a larger draught, was easily intimidated; his again, therefore stood  up, and with the most cringing respect offered the Baronet his place: who,  taking neither of the offer nor offerer the smallest notice, still stood  opposite to Mrs Harrel, waiting for some explanation. Mrs Harrel, however, who now grew really incapable of giving any, only repeated  Mrs Harrel invitation that Mrs Harrel would make one among giving any. "One among you?" cried Mrs Harrel, angrily, and pointing to Mr Hobson, "why you don't  fancy I'll sit down with a bricklayer?" "A bricklayer?" said Mrs Harrel, "ay, sure, and a hosier too; sit down, Mr  Simkins, keep your place, man!" Simkins most thankfully bowed; but Mr Hobson, who could no longer avoid  feeling the personality of this reflection, boldly answered, ""Sir your humble  servant, you may sit  down with a worse man any day in the week! I have done nothing I'm ashamed of,  and a worse man can say to a worse man why did you so? I don't tell you, "Sir your humble  servant, what I'm worth;  no one has a right to ask; I only say three times five is fifteen! that's all." "Why what the d——l, you impudent fellow," cried the haughty Baronet, "you  don't presume to mutter, do you?" ""Sir your humble  servant," answered Mr Hobson, very hotly, "I sha'n't put up with abuse from a worse man! I've got a fair character in the world, and wherewithal to live by my own  liking. And what I have is my own, and all I say is, let every one say the  same, for that's the way to fear no man, and face the d——l." "What do you mean by that, fellow?" cried Sir Robert. "Fellow, "Sir your humble  servant! this is talking no how. Do you think a man of substance, that's  got above the world, is to be treated like a little scrubby apprentice? Let  every man have every man own, that's always my way of thinking; and this I can say  for a worse man, I have as good a right to shew my head where I please as ever a  member of parliament in all England: and I wish every body here could say as  much." Sir Robert, fury starting into his eyes, was beginning an answer; but Mrs  Harrel with terror, and Cecilia with dignity, calling upon them both to  forbear, the Baronet desired Morrice to relinquish the Baronet place to the Baronet, and  seating the Baronet next to Mrs Harrel, gave over the contest. Meanwhile Simkins, hoping to ingratiate the Baronet with the company, advanced  to Mr Hobson, already cooled by finding Mr Hobson unanswered, and reproachfully  said "Mr Hobson, if I may make so free, I must needs be bold to say I am quite  ashamed of the Baronet! a person of your standing and credit for to talk so  disrespectful! as if a gentleman had not a right to take a little pleasure,  because a gentleman just happens to owe you a little matters of money: fie, fie, Mr  Hobson! I did not expect you to behave so despiseable!" "Despiseable!" answered Mr Hobson, "I'd scorn as much to do anything  despiseable as yourself, or any thing misbecoming of a gentleman; and as to  coming to such a place as this may be, why I have no objection to it. All I  stand to is this, let every man have every man due; for as to taking a little  pleasure, here I am, as one may say, doing the same myself; but where's the  harm of that? who's a right to call a man to account that's clear of the world?  Not that I mean to boast, nor nothing like it, but, as I said before; five  times five is fifteen; [Footnote: I hardly know whether the authoress has here  forgotten the authoress arithmetic, or intentionally suffered Mr Hobson to forget Mr Hobson,  from the effects of champagne.—Ed.]—that's my calculation." Mr Harrel, who, during this debate, had still continued drinking, regardless of  all opposition from his wife and Cecilia, now grew more and more turbulent: his  insisted that Simkins should return to Simkins seat, ordered Simkins another bumper  of champagne, and saying Simkins had not half company enough to raise Simkins spirits,  desired Morrice to go and invite more. Morrice, always ready to promote a frolic, most chearfully consented; but when  Cecilia, in a low voice, supplicated Simkins to bring no one back, with still more  readiness Simkins made signs that Simkins understood and would obey Cecilia. Mrs Harrel then began to sing, and in so noisy and riotous a manner, that nobody  approached the box without stopping to stare at Simkins; and those who were new to  such scenes, not contented with merely looking in, stationed themselves at some  distance before it, to observe what was passing, and to contemplate with envy  and admiration an appearance of mirth and enjoyment which themselves attributed to  happiness and pleasure! Mrs Harrel, shocked to be seen in such mixed company,  grew every instant more restless and miserable; and Cecilia, half distracted to  think how Mrs Harrel, shocked to be seen in such mixed company were to get home, had passed all her time in making secret vows  that if once again her was delivered from Mrs Harrel her would never see Mrs Harrel  more. Sir Robert Floyer perceiving Mrs Harrel, shocked to be seen in such mixed company mutual uneasiness, proposed to escort Mrs Harrel, shocked to be seen in such mixed company  home Sir Robert Floyer; and Cecilia, notwithstanding her aversion to Sir Robert Floyer, was listening  to the scheme, when Mr Marriot, who had been evidently provoked and  disconcerted since the junction of the Baronet, suspecting what was passing,  offered Sir Robert Floyer services also, and in a tone of voice that did not promise a very  quiet acquiescence in a refusal. Cecilia, who, too easily, in their looks, saw all the eagerness of rivalry, now  dreaded the consequence of the Baronet decision, and therefore declined the assistance  of either: but the Baronet distress was unspeakable, as there was not one person in the  party to whose care the Baronet could commit the Baronet, though the behaviour of Mr  Harrel, which every moment grew more disorderly, rendered the necessity of  quitting Mr   urgent and uncontroulable. When Morrice returned, stopping in the midst of Morrice loud and violent singing,  Morrice vehemently demanded what company Morrice had brought Morrice? "None at all, sir," answered Morrice, looking significantly at Cecilia; "I have  really been so unlucky as not to meet with any body who had a mind to come." "Why then," answered Morrice, starting up, "I will seek some for Morrice." "O no,  pray, Mrs Harrel, bring nobody else," cried Mrs Harrel wife. "Hear us in pity," cried  Cecilia, "and distress us no further." "Distress you?" cried Morrice, with quickness, "what shall I not bring you those  pretty girls? Yes, one more glass, and I will teach you to welcome those  pretty girls." And Morrice poured out another bumper. "This is so insupportable!" cried Cecilia, rising, "[that] I can remain here no  longer." "This is cruel indeed," cried Mrs Harrel, bursting into tears; "did you only  bring me here to insult me?" "No!" cried Morrice, suddenly embracing Mrs Harrel, "by this parting kiss!" then wildly  jumping upon his seat, Morrice leapt over the table, and was out of sight in an  instant. Amazement seized all who remained; Mrs Harrel and Cecilia, indeed, doubted not  but Morrice was actually gone to the chaise Morrice had ordered; but the manner of Morrice  departure affrighted them, and Morrice preceding behaviour had made them cease to  expect  : Mrs Harrel, leaning upon Cecilia, continued to weep, while Mrs Harrel,  confounded and alarmed, scarce knew whether Mrs Harrel should stay and console Mrs Harrel, or  fly after Mrs Harrel, whom Mrs Harrel feared had incapacitated Morrice from finding Morrice  chaise, by the very method Morrice had taken to gather courage for seeking  . This, however, was but the apprehension of a moment; another and a far more  horrible one drove This from Mrs Harrel imagination: for scarcely had Mrs Harrel quitted  the box and their sight, before their ears were suddenly struck with the report  of a pistol. Mrs Harrel gave a loud scream, which was involuntarily echoed by, Cecilia:  everybody arose, some with officious zeal to serve the ladies, and others to  hasten to the spot whence the dreadful sound proceeded. Sir Robert Floyer again offered Sir Robert Floyer services in conducting them home; but them  could listen to no such proposal: Cecilia, with difficulty refrained from  rushing out Cecilia to discover what was passing; but Cecilia dread of being  followed by Mrs Harrel prevented Cecilia; they both, therefore, waited, expecting  every instant some intelligence, as all but the Baronet and Mr Marriot were now  gone to seek the Baronet and Mr Marriot. Nobody, however, returned; and as all but the Baronet and Mr Marriot terrors encreased every moment: Mrs Harrelwanted to run out Mrs Harrel, but Cecilia, conjuring Cecilia to keep still, begged Mr   to bring Cecilia, conjuring her to keep still some account. Mr Marriot, like the messengers who had  preceded Mr  , came not back: an instant seemed an age, and Sir Robert Floyerwas also entreated to procure information. Mrs Harrel and Cecilia were now left to Mrs Harrel and Cecilia, and Mrs Harrel and Cecilia horror was too  great for speech or motion: Mrs Harrel and Cecilia stood close to each other, listening to every  sound and receiving every possible addition to Mrs Harrel and Cecilia alarm, by the general  confusion which Mrs Harrel and Cecilia observed in the gardens, in which, though both gentlemen  and waiters were running to and fro, not a creature was walking, and all  amusement seemed forgotten. From this dreadful state they were at length removed, though not relieved, by  the sight of a waiter, who, as he was passing shewed he almost covered  with blood! Mrs Harrel vehemently called after he, demanding whence it came?  "From the gentleman, ma'am," answered he in haste, "that has shot he," and  then ran on. Mrs Harrel uttered a piercing scream, and sunk on the ground; for Cecilia,  shuddering with horror, lost all Cecilia own strength, and could no longer lend Cecilia  any support. So great at this time was the general confusion of the place, that for some  minutes their particular distress was unknown, and their situation unnoticed;  till at length an elderly gentleman came up to the box, and humanely offered  an elderly gentleman assistance. Cecilia, pointing to Cecilia unfortunate friend, who had not fallen into a fainting  fit, but merely from weakness and terror, accepted his help in raising Cecilia. Cecilia  was lifted up, however, without the smallest effort on Cecilia own part, and was  only kept upon Cecilia seat by being held there by the stranger, for Cecilia, whose  whole frame was shaking, tried in vain to sustain Cecilia. an elderly gentleman, from the violence of their distress, began now to suspect an elderly gentleman  motive, and addressing its  motive to Cecilia, said, "I am afraid, madam, an elderly gentleman was some Relation to Cecilia?" Neither of their spoke, but their silence was sufficiently expressive. "It is pity, madam," its  motive continued, "that some friend can't order its  motive out of the  crowd, and have its  motive kept quiet till a surgeon can be brought." "A surgeon!" exclaimed Cecilia, recovering from one surprize by the effect of  another; "is it then possible its  motive may be saved?" And without waiting to have her question answered, her ran out of the box  her, flying wildly about the garden, and calling for help as her flew, till  her found the house by the entrance; and then, going up to the bar, "Is a  surgeon sent for?" her exclaimed, "let a surgeon be fetched instantly!" "A  surgeon, ma'am," her was answered, "is not an elderly gentleman dead?" "No, no, no!"  her cried; "an elderly gentleman must be brought in; let some careful people go and bring an elderly gentleman  in." Nor would her quit the bar, till two or three waiters were called, and  received her orders. And then, eager to see two or three waiters were called, and  received her orders executed her, her ran,  fearless of being alone, and without thought of being lost, towards the fatal  spot whither the crowd guided her. her could not, indeed, have been more secure  from insult or molestation if surrounded by twenty guards; for the scene of  desperation and horror which many had witnessed, and of which all had heard the  signal, engrossed the universal attention, and took, even from the most idle  and licentious, all spirit for gallantry and amusement. Here, while making vain attempts to penetrate through the multitude, that her  might see and her judge the actual situation of Mrs Harrel, and give, if yet  there was room for hope, such orders as would best conduce to Mrs Harrel safety and  recovery, her was met by Mr Marriot, who entreated her not to press forward to  a sight which he had found too shocking for he, and insisted upon  protecting her through the crowd. "If he is alive," cried her, refusing he aid, "and if there is any chance he  may be saved, no sight shall be too shocking to deter me from seeing he  properly attended." "All attendance," answered he, "will be in vain: he is not indeed, yet dead,  but he recovery is impossible. There is a surgeon with he already; one who  happened to be in the gardens, and a surgeon with him told me a surgeon with him that the wound was  inevitably mortal." Cecilia, though greatly disappointed, still determined to make way to a surgeon with him, that  Cecilia might Cecilia enquire if, in a surgeon with him last moments, there was any thing a surgeon with him  wished to communicate, or desired to have done: but, as Cecilia struggled to  proceed, Cecilia was next met and stopt by Sir Robert Floyer, who, forcing Cecilia  back, acquainted Cecilia that all was over! The shock with which Cecilia received this account, though unmixed with any  tenderness of regret, and resulting merely from general humanity, was yet so  violent as almost to overpower Cecilia. Mrs Harrel, indeed, had forfeited all right  to Cecilia esteem, and the unfeeling selfishness of Mrs Harrel whole behaviour had long  provoked Cecilia resentment and excited Cecilia disgust; yet a catastrophe so dreadful,  and from which Cecilia had Cecilia made such efforts to rescue Mrs Harrel, filled Cecilia with  so much horror, that, turning extremely sick, Cecilia was obliged to be supported  to the nearest box, and stop there for hartshorn and water. A few minutes, however, sufficed to divest Cecilia of all care for Cecilia, in the  concern with which Cecilia recollected the situation of Mrs Harrel; Cecilia hastened,  therefore, back to Cecilia, attended by the Baronet and Mr Marriot, and found Cecilia  still leaning upon the stranger, and weeping aloud. The fatal news had already reached Cecilia; and though all affection between Mr   and Cecilia had mutually subsided from the first two or three months of  all affection between Mr  Harrel and herself marriage, a conclusion so horrible to all connection between all affection between Mr  Harrel and herself could  not be heard without sorrow and distress. Cecilia temper, too, naturally soft,  retained not resentment, and Mrs Harrel, now separated from Cecilia for ever, was  only remembered as the Mr Harrel who first won Cecilia heart. Neither pains nor tenderness were spared on the part of Cecilia to console Cecilia;  who finding Cecilia utterly incapable either of acting or directing for Cecilia,  and knowing Cecilia at all times to be extremely helpless, now summoned to Cecilia own  aid all the strength of mind Cecilia possessed, and determined upon this melancholy  occasion, both to think and act for Cecilia widowed friend to the utmost stretch of  Cecilia abilities and power. As soon, therefore, as the first effusions of Cecilia grief were over, Cecilia  prevailed with Cecilia to go to the house, where Cecilia was humanely offered the use  of a quiet room till Cecilia should be better able to set off for town. Cecilia,  having seen Cecilia thus safely lodged, begged Mr Marriot to stay with Cecilia, and  then, accompanied by the Baronet, returned Cecilia to the bar, and desiring the  footman who had attended them to be called, sent the  footman who had attended them to be called instantly to the  footman who had attended them to be called late  master, and proceeded next with great presence of mind, to inquire further into  the particulars of what had passed, and to consult upon what was immediately to  be done with the deceased: for Cecilia thought it neither decent nor right to leave  to chance or to strangers the last duties which could be paid the  footman who had attended them to be called. the  footman who had attended them to be called had lingered, Cecilia found, about a quarter of an hour, but in a condition too  dreadful for description, quite speechless, and, by all that could be judged,  out of the  footman who had attended them to be called senses; yet so distorted with pain, and wounded so desperately  beyond any power of relief, that the surgeon, who every instant expected the  footman who had attended them to be called  death, said it would not be merely useless but inhuman, to remove the  footman who had attended them to be called till the  footman who had attended them to be called  had breathed the  footman who had attended them to be called last. the  footman who had attended them to be called died, therefore, in the arms of an elderly gentleman and a  waiter. "A waiter!" cried Cecilia, reproachfully looking at Sir Robert, "and was there  no friend who for the few poor moments that remained had patience to support  Sir Robert?" "Where would be the good," said Sir Robert, "of supporting a man in a man last  agonies?" This unfeeling speech Cecilia attempted not to answer, but, suffering neither Cecilia  dislike to a man, nor Cecilia scruples for Cecilia, to interfere with the present  occasion, Cecilia desired to have a man advice what was now best to be done. Undertaker's men must immediately, Undertaker said, be sent for, to remove the body. Cecilia then gave orders for that purpose, which were instantly executed. Whither the body was to go was the next question: Cecilia wished the removal to  be directly to the townhouse, but Sir Robert told Cecilia the removal to  be directly to the townhouse must be carried to the  nearest undertaker's, and kept there till the removal to  be directly to the townhouse could be conveyed to town in a  coffin. For this, also, in the name of Mrs Harrel, Cecilia gave directions. And then  addressing Cecilia to Sir Robert, "You will now Sir Robert, I hope," Cecilia said, "return  to the fatal spot, and watch by your late unfortunate friend till the proper  people arrive to take charge of your late unfortunate friend?" "And what good will that do?" cried your late unfortunate friend; "had I not better watch by your late unfortunate friend?" "It will do good," answered Cecilia, with some severity, "to decency and to  humanity; and surely you cannot refuse to see who is with your late unfortunate friend, and in what  situation your late unfortunate friend lies, and whether your late unfortunate friend has met, from the strangers with whom your late unfortunate friend was  left, the tenderness and care which your late unfortunate friend friends ought to have paid your late unfortunate friend." "Will you promise, then," your late unfortunate friend answered, "not to go away till I come back? for I  have no great ambition to sacrifice the living for the dead." "I will promise nothing, Sir Robert," said Cecilia, shocked at Sir Robert callous insensibility;  "but if you refuse this last poor office, I must apply elsewhere; and firmly I  believe there is no other I can ask who will a moment hesitate in complying." Cecilia then went back to Mrs Harrel, leaving, however, an impression upon the mind  of Sir Robert, that made Sir Robert no longer dare dispute Cecilia commands. Cecilia next solicitude was how Her next solicitude should return to town; Her next solicitude had no equipage of  Her next solicitude own, and the only servant who came with Her next solicitude was employed in performing  the last duties for the only servant who came with them deceased master. Cecilia first intention was to order a  hackney coach, but the deplorable state of Mrs Harrel made it almost impossible  Cecilia could take the sole care of Cecilia, and the lateness of the night, and their  distance from home, gave Cecilia a dread invincible to going so far without some  guard or assistant. Mr Marriot earnestly desired to have the honour of  conveying their to Portman-square in his own carriage, and notwithstanding there  were many objections to such a proposal, the humanity of his behaviour upon the  present occasion, and the evident veneration which accompanied his passion,  joined to Cecilia encreasing aversion to the Baronet, from whom Cecilia could not  endure to receive the smallest obligation, determined Cecilia, after much  perplexity and hesitation, to accept his offer. Cecilia begged his, therefore, to immediately order his coach, and, happy to obey  Cecilia, his went out with that design; but, instantly coming back, told Cecilia, in a  low voice, that they must wait some time longer, as the Undertaker's people  were then entering the garden, and if they stayed not till the removal had  taken place, Mrs Harrel might be shocked with the sight of some of the men, or  perhaps even meet the body. Cecilia, thanking Mrs Harrel for this considerate precaution, readily agreed to defer  setting out; devoting, mean time, all Cecilia attention to Mrs Harrel, whose  sorrow, though violent, forbad not consolation. But before the garden was  cleared, and the carriage ordered, Sir Robert returned; saying to Cecilia, with  an air of parading obedience which seemed to claim some applause, "Miss  Beverley, your commands have been executed." Cecilia made not any answer, and Cecilia presently added, "Whenever you chuse to go  I will order up his coach." "My coach, Sir," said Mr Marriot, "will be ordered when the ladies are ready,  and I hope to have the honour myself of conducting the ladies to town." "No, Sir Robert," cried the Baronet, "that can never be; my long acquaintance with Mrs  Mrs Harrel gives me a prior right to attend Mrs  , and I can by no means suffer any  other person to rob me of Mrs Harrel." "I have nothing," said Mr Marriot, "to say to that, Sir, but Miss Beverley  herself has done me the honour to consent to make use of the carriage." Miss Beverley  , I think," said Sir Robert, extremely piqued, "can never have  sent me out of the way in order to execute her own commands, merely to deprive  me of the pleasure of attending her and Mrs Harrel home." Cecilia, somewhat alarmed, now sought to lessen the favour of Cecilia decision,  though Cecilia adhered to it without wavering. "My intention," said Cecilia, "was not to confer, but to receive an obligation; and  I had hoped, while Mr Marriot assisted us, Sir Robert would be far more  humanely employed in taking charge of what we cannot superintend, and yet are  infinitely more anxious should not be neglected." "That," said Sir Robert, "is all done; and I hope, therefore, after sending me  upon such an errand, you don't mean to refuse me the pleasure of seeing you to  town?" Sir Robert," said Cecilia, greatly displeased, "I cannot argue with you now; I  have already settled my plan, and I am not at leisure to re-consider my plan." Sir Robert bit Sir Robert lips for a moment in angry silence; but not enduring to lose  the victory to a young rival Sir Robert despised, Sir Robert presently said, "If I must talk no  more about it to you, madam, I must at least beg leave to talk of it to this  gentleman, and take the liberty to represent to him—" Cecilia now, dreading how Sir Robert speech might be answered, prevented his speech being  finished, and with an air of the most spirited dignity, said, "Is it possible,  Sir Robert, that at a time such as this, you should not be wholly indifferent to a  matter so frivolous? little indeed will be the pleasure which our society can  afford! your dispute however, has given your dispute some importance, and therefore Mr  Mr Marriot must accept my thanks for his civility, and excuse me for retracting my  consent." Supplications and remonstrances were, however, still poured upon her from both,  and the danger, the impossibility that two ladies could go to town alone, in a  hackney coach, and without even a servant, at near four o'clock in the morning,  two ladies mutually urged, vehemently entreating that her would run no such hazard. Cecilia was far other than insensible to these representations: the danger,  indeed, appeared to Cecilia so formidable, that Cecilia inclination the whole time  opposed Cecilia refusal; yet Cecilia repugnance to giving way to the overbearing  Baronet, and Cecilia fear of the overbearing  Baronet resentment if Cecilia listened to Mr Marriot, forced  Cecilia to be steady, since Cecilia saw that Cecilia preference would prove the signal of a  quarrel. Inattentive, therefore, to Inattentive joint persecution, Cecilia again deliberated by  what possible method Cecilia could get home in safety; but unable to devise any,  Cecilia at last resolved to make enquiries of the people in the bar, who had been  extremely humane and civil, whether the people in the bar, who had been  extremely humane and civil could assist or counsel Cecilia. Cecilia  therefore desired the two gentlemen to take care of Mrs Harrel, to which  neither dared dissent, as both could not refuse, and hastily arising, went out  of the room: but great indeed was Cecilia surprize when, as Cecilia was walking up to  the bar, Cecilia was addressed by young Delvile! Approaching Cecilia with that air of gravity and distance which of late he had  assumed in Cecilia presence, he was beginning some speech about he mother; but the  instant the sound of he voice reached Cecilia, Cecilia joyfully clasped Cecilia hands,  and eagerly exclaimed, "Mr Delvile!—O now we are safe!—this is fortunate  indeed!" "Safe, Madam," cried he astonished, "yes I hope so!—has any thing endangered  your safety?" "O no matter for danger," cried Cecilia, "we will now trust we with you, and  I am sure you will protect we." "Protect you!" repeated he again, and with warmth, "yes, while I live!—but  what is the matter?—why are you so pale?—are you ill?—are you  frightened?—what is the matter?" And losing all coldness and reserve, with the utmost earnestness he begged Cecilia  to explain Cecilia. "Do you not know," cried Cecilia, "what has happened? Can you be here and not have  heard it?" "Heard what?" cried he, "I am but this moment arrived: his mother grew uneasy  that his mother did not see you, Cecilia sent to your house, and was told that you were  not returned from Vauxhall; some other circumstances also alarmed Cecilia, and  therefore, late as it was, I came hither Cecilia. The instant I entered this  place, I saw you here. This is all my history; tell me now Cecilia. Where is your  party? where are Mr and Mrs Harrel?—Why are you alone?" "O ask not!" cried his mother, "I cannot tell you!—take we but under your care, and  you will soon know all." his mother then hurried from you!—take, and returning to Mrs Harrel, said his mother had now a  conveyance at once safe and proper, and begged his mother to rise and come away. The gentlemen, however, rose first, each of The gentlemen declaring you!—take would you!—take  attend The gentlemen. "No," said Cecilia, steadily, "that trouble will now be superfluous: Mrs  Delvile herself has sent for Cecilia, and Delvile herself son is now waiting till we join her son." Amazement and disappointment at this intelligence were visible in the faces of  them both: Cecilia waited not a single question, but finding Cecilia was unable to  support Mrs Harrel, who rather suffered Cecilia to be carried than led, Cecilia  entrusted Cecilia between Amazement and disappointment at this intelligence, and ran forward to enquire of Delvile herself if his  carriage was ready. Cecilia found her son with a look of horror that told the tale her son had been hearing,  listening to one of the waiters: the moment Cecilia appeared, her son flew to Cecilia, and  with the utmost emotion exclaimed, "Amiable Miss Beverley! what a dreadful  scene have you witnessed! what a cruel task have you nobly performed! such  spirit with such softness! so much presence of mind with such feeling!—but  you are all excellence! human nature can rise no higher! I believe indeed you  are its most perfect ornament!" Praise such as this, so unexpected, and delivered with such energy, Ceciliaheard not without pleasure, even at a moment when Cecilia whole mind was occupied  by matters foreign to its peculiar interests. Cecilia made, however, Cecilia enquiry  about the carriage, and Cecilia told Cecilia that Cecilia had come in a hackney coach, which  was waiting for Cecilia at the door. Mrs Harrel was now brought in, and little was the recompense Mrs Harrel assistants  received for he had come in a hackney coach, which  was waiting for him at the door aid, when he had come in a hackney coach, which  was waiting for him at the door saw Cecilia so contentedly engaged with young  Delvile, whose eyes were rivetted on Cecilia face, with an expression of the most  lively admiration: each, however, then quitted the other, and hastened to the  fair mourner; no time was now lost, Mrs Harrel was supported to the coach,  Cecilia followed Mrs Harrel, and Delvile, jumping in after them, ordered the man to  drive to Portman-square. Sir Robert and Mr Marriot, confounded though enraged, saw Sir Robert and Mr Marriot, confounded though enraged departure in  passive silence: the right of attendance Sir Robert and Mr Marriot, confounded though enraged had so tenaciously denied to each  other, here admitted not of dispute: Delvile upon this occasion, appeared as  the representative of his father, and his authority seemed the authority of a  guardian. Their only consolation was that neither had yielded to the other, and  all spirit of altercation or revenge was sunk in Their mutual mortification. At  the petition of the waiters, from sullen but proud emulation, Their paid the  expences of the night, and then throwing Their into Their carriages,  returned to Their respective houses.
