 Eager to renew a conversation which had afforded her so much pleasure, Cecilia,  neither sensible of fatigue from her change of hours nor her journey, arose  with the light, and as soon as her was dressed, hastened to the breakfast  apartment.
her had not, however, been more impatient to enter than her soon became to quit  it; for though not much surprized to find her there before her friend, her  ardour for waiting her arrival was somewhat chilled, upon finding the fire but  just lighted, the room cold, and the servants still employed in putting the fire in  order.
At 10 o'clock her made another attempt: the room was then better prepared for  her reception, but still the room was empty.
Again her was retiring, when the  appearance of Mr Arnott stopped her.
Mr Arnott expressed Mr Arnott surprize at her early rising, in a manner that marked the  pleasure it gave to Mr Arnott; and then, returning to the conversation of the  preceding evening, Mr Arnott expatiated with warmth and feeling upon the happiness of  Mr Arnott boyish days, remembered every circumstance belonging to the plays in which  they had formerly been companions, and dwelt upon every incident with a  minuteness of delight that shewed Mr Arnott unwillingness ever to have done with the  subject.
This discourse detained her till they were joined by Mrs Harrel, and then  another, more gay and more general succeeded to it.
During they breakfast, Miss Larolles was announced as a visitor to Cecilia, to  whom her immediately advanced with the intimacy of an old acquaintance, taking  her hand, and assuring her her could no longer defer the honour of waiting upon  her.
Cecilia, much amazed at this warmth of civility from one to whom her was almost  a stranger, received her compliment rather coldly; but Miss Larolles, without  consulting her looks, or attending to her manner, proceeded to express the  earnest desire her had long had to be known to her; to hope they should meet  very often; to declare nothing could make her so happy; and to beg leave to  recommend to her notice her own milliner.
"I assure you," her continued, "her has all Paris in her disposal; the sweetest  caps!
the most beautiful trimmings!
and her ribbons are quite divine!
It is the  most dangerous thing you can conceive to go near her; I never trust her in  her room but I am sure to be ruined.
If you please, I'll take you to her this  morning."
"If her acquaintance is so ruinous," said her, "I think I had better avoid  it."
"Oh, impossible!
there's no such thing as living without her.
To be sure her's  shockingly dear, that I must own; but then who can wonder?
her makes such sweet  things, 'tis impossible to pay her too much for To be sure she's  shockingly dear, that I must own; but then who can wonder."
Mrs Harrel now joining in the recommendation, the party was agreed upon, and  accompanied by Mr Arnott, the ladies proceeded to the house of the milliner.
Here the raptures of Miss Larolles were again excited: her viewed the finery  displayed with delight inexpressible, enquired who were the intended  possessors, heard the finery   names with envy, and sighed with all the bitterness of  mortification that her was unable to order home almost everything her looked at.
Having finished their business here, their proceeded to various other dress  manufacturers, in whose praises Miss Larolles was almost equally eloquent, and  to appropriate whose goods her was almost equally earnest: and then, after  attending this loquacious young lady to her father's house, Mrs Harrel and  Cecilia returned to her father's house, Mrs Harrel and  Cecilia own.
Cecilia rejoiced at the separation, and congratulated her that the rest of  the day might be spent alone with her friend.
"Why, no," said Mrs Harrel, "not absolutely alone, for I expect some company at  night."
"Company again to-night?"
"Nay, don't be frightened, for it will be a very small party; not more than  fifteen or twenty in all."
"Is that so small a party?"
said Cecilia, smiling; "and how short a time since  would you, as well as I, have reckoned as well a large one!"
"Oh, you mean when I lived in the country," returned Mrs Harrel; "but what in  the world could I know of parties or company then?"
"Not much, indeed," said Cecilia, "as my present ignorance shews."
They then parted to dress for dinner.
The company of this evening were again all strangers to Cecilia, except Miss  Leeson, who was seated next to Miss  , and whose frigid looks again compelled Miss    to observe the same silence Miss   so resolutely practised Miss  .
Yet not the  less was Miss   internal surprise that a lady who seemed determined neither to  give nor receive any entertainment, should repeatedly chuse to show Miss   in  a company with no part of which Miss   associated.
Mr Arnott, who contrived to occupy the seat on Miss   other side, suffered not the  silence with which Miss   fair neighbour had infected Miss   to spread any further:  he talked, indeed, upon no new subject; and upon the old one, of their former  sports and amusements, he had already exhausted all that was worth being  mentioned; but not yet had he exhausted the pleasure he received from the  theme; it seemed always fresh and always enchanting to he; it employed he  thoughts, regaled he imagination, and enlivened he discourse.
Cecilia in vain  tried to change it for another; Cecilia in vain   quitted it only by compulsion, and returned  to it with redoubled eagerness.
When it was retired, and Mr Arnott only remained with the ladies,  Cecilia, with no little surprise, inquired for Mr Harrel, observing that Cecilia in vain    had not seen Mr Arnott the whole day.
"O!"
cried Mr Arnott lady, "don't think of wondering at that, for it happens  continually.
Mr Arnott dines at home, indeed, in general, but otherwise I should see  nothing of Mr Arnott at all."
"Indeed?
why, how does Mr Arnott fill up Mr Arnott time?"
"That I am sure I cannot tell, for Mr Arnott never consults me about it; but I suppose  much in the same way that other people do."
"Ah, Priscilla!"
cried Cecilia, with some earnestness, "how little did I ever  expect to see you so much a fine lady!"
"A fine lady?"
repeated Mrs Harrel; "why, what is it I do?
Don't I live exactly  like every body else that mixes at all with the world?"
"You, Miss Beverley," said Mr Arnott in a low voice, "will I hope give to the world an example, not take one from the world."
Soon after, they separated for the night.
The next morning, Cecilia took care to fill up Cecilia time more advantageously,  than in wandering about the house in search of a companion Cecilia now expected not  to find: Cecilia got together Cecilia books, arranged they to Cecilia fancy, and secured to  Cecilia for the future occupation of Cecilia leisure hours, the exhaustless fund of  entertainment which reading, that richest, highest, and noblest source of  intellectual enjoyment, perpetually affords.

"I  am come," cried Cecilia, eagerly, "to run away with you both to my Lord Belgrade's  sale.
All the world will be there; and we shall go in with tickets, and you  have no notion how it will be crowded."
"What is to be sold there?"
said Cecilia.
"Oh, every thing you can conceive; house, stables, china, laces, horses, caps,  everything in All the world."
"And do you intend to buy any thing?"
"Lord, no; but one likes to see the people's things."
Cecilia then begged they would excuse Cecilia attendance.
"O, by no means!"
cried Miss Larolles; "you must go, I assure you; there'll be  such a monstrous crowd as you never saw in your life.
I dare say we shall be  half squeezed to death."
"That," said Cecilia, "is an inducement which you must not expect will have  much weight with a poor rustic just out of the country: it must require all the  polish of a long residence in the metropolis to make it attractive."
"O but do go, for I assure you it will be the best sale we shall have this  season.
I can't imagine, Mrs Harrel, what poor Lady Belgrade will do with  Lady Belgrade; I hear the creditors have seized every thing; I really believe  creditors are the cruelest set of people in All the world!
creditors have taken those  beautiful buckles out of Lady Belgrade shoes!
Poor soul!
I declare it will make my heart  ache to see creditors put up.
It's quite shocking, upon my word.
I wonder who'll buy  creditors.
I assure you creditors were the prettiest fancied I ever saw.
But come, if we  don't go directly, there will be no getting in."
Cecilia again desired to be excused accompanying creditors, adding that Cecilia wished  to spend the day at home.
"At home, my dear?"
cried Mrs Harrel; "why we have been engaged to Mrs Mears  this month, and Mrs Harrel begged me to prevail with Mrs Mears   to be of the party.
I expect  Mrs Harrel'll call, or send you a ticket, every moment."
"How unlucky for Mrs Mears  ," said Cecilia, "that you should happen to have so many  engagements just at this time!
I hope, at least, there will not be any for  to-morrow."
"O yes; to-morrow we go to Mrs Elton's."
"Again to-morrow?
and how long is this to last?"
"O, heaven knows; I'll shew you my catalogue."
Mrs Harrel then produced a book which contained a list of engagements for more than  three weeks.
"And as these," Mrs Harrel said, "are struck off, new ones are made; and  so it is we go on till after the birth-day."
When a list of engagements had been examined and commented upon by Miss Larolles, and  viewed and wondered at by Cecilia, a list of engagements was restored to a list of engagements place, the two ladies  went together to the auction, permitting Cecilia, at Cecilia repeated request, to  return to Cecilia own apartment.
Cecilia returned, however, neither satisfied with the behaviour of Cecilia , nor  pleased with Cecilia own situation: the sobriety of Cecilia education, as it had early  instilled into Cecilia mind the pure dictates of religion, and strict principles of  honour, had also taught Cecilia to regard continual dissipation as an introduction  to vice, and unbounded extravagance as the harbinger of injustice.
Long  accustomed to see Mrs Harrel in the same retirement in which Mrs Harrel had hitherto  lived Mrs Harrel, when books were books first amusement, and the society of each  other was books chief happiness, the change Mrs Harrel now perceived in Mrs Harrel mind and  manners equally concerned and surprised Mrs Harrel.
Mrs Harrel found Mrs Harrel insensible to  friendship, indifferent to Mrs Harrel husband, and negligent of all social felicity.
Dress, company, parties of pleasure, and public places, seemed not merely to  occupy all Mrs Harrel time; but to gratify all Mrs Harrel wishes.
Cecilia, in whose heart  glowed the warmest affections and most generous virtue, was cruelly depressed  and mortified by this disappointment; yet Mrs Harrel had the good sense to determine  against upbraiding Mrs Harrel, well aware that if reproach has any power over  indifference, it is only that of changing it into aversion.
Mrs Harrel, in truth, was innocent of heart, though dissipated in life; married  very young, Mrs Harrel had made an immediate transition from living in a private  family and a country town, to becoming mistress of one of the most elegant  houses in Portman-square, at the head of a splendid fortune, and wife to a man  whose own pursuits soon showed Mrs Harrel the little value a man   set upon  domestic happiness.
Immersed in the fashionable round of company and  diversions, Mrs Harrel understanding, naturally weak, was easily dazzled by the  brilliancy of Mrs Harrel situation; greedily, therefore, sucking in air impregnated  with luxury and extravagance, Mrs Harrel had soon no pleasure but to vie with some  rival in elegance, and no ambition but to exceed some superior in expence.
The Dean of——in naming Mr Harrel for one of the guardians of Mr Harrel niece, had  no other view than that of indulging Mrs Harrel wishes by allowing Mrs Harrel to reside in  the house of her friend: Mr Harrel had little personal knowledge of Mr Harrel, but was  satisfied with the nomination, because acquainted with Mr Harrel family, fortune, and  connections, all which persuaded Mr Harrel to believe without further enquiry, that  it was more peculiarly proper for his niece than any other Mr Harrel could make.
In Mr Harrel choice of the other two trustees Mr Harrel had been more prudent; the first of  these, the honourable Mr Delvile, was a man of high birth and character; the  second, Mr Briggs, had spent Mr Harrel whole life in business, in which Mr Harrel had  already amassed an immense fortune, and had still no greater pleasure than that  of encreasing it.
From the high honour, therefore, of Mr Delvile, Mr Harrel expected  the most scrupulous watchfulness that his niece should in nothing be injured,  and from the experience of Mr Briggs in money matters, and Mr Harrel diligence in  transacting business, Mr Harrel hoped for the most vigilant observance that his niece  fortune, while under Mr Harrel care, should be turned to the best account.
And thus,  as far as Mr Harrel was able, Mr Harrel had equally consulted his niece pleasure, his niece security, and  his niece pecuniary advantage.
Mrs Harrel returned home only in time to dress for the rest of the day.
When Cecilia was summoned to dinner, Cecilia found, besides Cecilia host and hostess  and Mr Arnott, a gentleman Cecilia had not before seen, but who as soon as Cecilia  entered the parlour, Mrs Harrel presented to Cecilia, saying at the same time Mrs Harrel was  one of the most intimate of Mrs Harrel friends.
This gentleman, Sir Robert Floyer, was about thirty years of age; Mrs Harrel face was  neither remarkable for his face beauty nor his face ugliness, but sufficiently  distinguished by his face expression of invincible assurance; Mrs Harrel person, too,  though neither striking for his face grace nor his face deformity, attracted notice from  the insolence of Mrs Harrel deportment.
Mrs Harrel manners, haughty and supercilious, marked  the high opinion Mrs Harrel cherished of Mrs Harrel own importance; and Mrs Harrel air and address,  at once bold and negligent, announced Mrs Harrel happy perfection in the character at  which Mrs Harrel aimed, that of an accomplished man of the town.
The moment Cecilia appeared, Cecilia became the object of Mrs Harrel attention, though  neither with the look of admiration due to Cecilia beauty, nor yet with that of  curiosity excited by Cecilia novelty, but with the scrutinizing observation of a  man on the point of making a bargain, who views with fault-seeking eyes the  property he means to cheapen.
Cecilia, wholly unused to an examination so little ceremonious, shrunk abashed  from he regards: but he conversation was not less displeasing to Cecilia than he  looks; he principal subjects, which were horse-racing, losses at play, and  disputes at gaming-tables, could afford Cecilia but little amusement, because Cecilia  could not understand his principal subjects, which were horse-racing, losses at play, and  disputes at gaming-tables; and the episodes with which his principal subjects, which were horse-racing, losses at play, and  disputes at gaming-tables were occasionally  interspersed, consisting chiefly of comparative strictures upon celebrated  beauties, hints of impending bankruptcies, and witticisms upon recent divorces,  were yet more disagreeable to Cecilia, because more intelligible.
Wearied,  therefore, with uninteresting anecdotes, and offended with injudicious subjects  of pleasantry, Cecilia waited with impatience for the moment of retiring; but Mrs  Harrel, less eager, because better entertained, was in no haste to remove, and  therefore Cecilia was compelled to remain quiet, till Mrs  Harrel, less eager were both obliged to  arise, in order to fulfil Mrs  Harrel, less eager engagement with Mrs Mears  .
As Mrs  Harrel, less eager went together to the house of that lady, in Mrs Harrel vis-a-vis,  Cecilia, not doubting but Mrs  Harrel, less eager opinions concerning the Baronet would accord,  instantly and openly declared the Baronet disapprobation of every thing he had uttered;  but Mrs Harrel, far from confirming Cecilia expectations, only said, "I am sorry  you don't like he, for he is almost always with us?"
"Do you like he, then, yourself?"
"Extremely; he is very entertaining and clever, and knows All the world."
"How judiciously do you praise he!"
cried Cecilia; "and how long might you  deliberate before you could add another word to he panegyric!"
Mrs Harrel, satisfied to commend, without even attempting to vindicate Mrs Harrel, was  soon content to change the subject; and Cecilia, though much concerned that the  husband of Cecilia had made so disgraceful an election of a favourite, yet  hoped that the lenity of Mrs Harrel resulted from Mrs Harrel desire to excuse the  husband of her friend  choice, not from Cecilia own approbation.
