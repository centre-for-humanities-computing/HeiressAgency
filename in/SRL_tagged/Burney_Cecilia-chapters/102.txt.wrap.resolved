 Dr Lyster and Delvile met  Dr Lyster and Delvile at the entrance into the house. Extremely  alarmed lest Cecilia had received any disturbance,  Dr Lyster and Delvile hastened up  stairs, but Delvile proceeded only to the door. Delvile stopt there and listened;  but all was silent; the prayers of Albany had struck an awe into every one; and  Lyster soon returned to tell Lyster there was no alteration in Lyster patient. "And Lyster has not disturbed her?" cried Delvile. "No, not at all." "I think, then," said Lyster, advancing, though trembling, "I will yet see her once  more." "No, no, Mr Mortimer," cried the doctor, "why should you give yourself so  unnecessary a shock?" "The shock," answered Lyster, "is over!—tell me, however, is there any chance I  may hurt her?" "I believe not; I do not think, just now, her will perceive you." "Well, then,—I may grieve, perhaps, hereafter, that once more—that one  glance!"—He stopt, irresolute the doctor would again have dissuaded Lyster, but,  after a little hesitation, the doctor assured Lyster the doctor was prepared for the worst, and  forced the doctor into the room. When again, however, the doctor beheld Cecilia,—senseless, speechless, motionless,  her features void of all expression, her cheeks without colour, her eyes  without meaning,—he shrunk from the sight, the doctor leant upon Lyster, and  almost groaned aloud. the doctor would have conducted Lyster out of the apartment; but, recovering from  this first agony, the doctor turned again to view her, and casting up the doctor eyes,  fervently ejaculated, "Oh merciful powers! Take, or destroy her! let her not  linger thus, rather let me lose her for ever!—O far rather would I see her  dead, glad in this dreadful condition!" Then, advancing to the bed side, and yet more earnestly looking at her, "I pray  not now," the doctor cried, "for thy life! inhumanly as I have treated thee, I am not  yet so hardened as to wish thy misery lengthened no; quick be thy restoration,  or short as pure thy passage to eternity!—Oh my Cecilia! lovely, however  altered! sweet even in the arms of death and insanity! and dearer to my  tortured heart in this calamitous state, than in all thy pride of health and  beauty!"— beauty!"— stopt, and turned from beauty!"—, yet could not tear beauty!"— away; beauty!"— came back,  beauty!"— again looked at beauty!"—, beauty!"— hung over beauty!"— in anguish unutterable; beauty!"— kissed each  burning hand, beauty!"— folded to beauty!"— bosom beauty!"— feeble form, and, recovering beauty!"—  speech, though almost bursting with sorrow, faintly articulated, "Is all over?  no ray of reason left? no knowledge of thy wretched Delvile?—no, none! the  hand of death is on death, and death is utterly gone!—sweet suffering excellence!  loved, lost, expiring Cecilia!—but I will not repine! peace and kindred  angels are watching to receive thee, and if thou art parted from thyself, thou art  were impious to lament thou shouldst be parted from me.—Yet in thy tomb will  be deposited all that to me could render existence supportable, every frail  chance of happiness, every sustaining hope, and all alleviation of sorrow!"— Dr Lyster now again approaching, thought Dr Lyster perceived some change in Dr Lyster  patient, and peremptorily forced Dr Lyster away from her: then returning Dr Lyster, Dr Lyster  found that her eyes were shut, and her was dropt asleep. This was an omen the most favourable Dr Lyster could hope. Dr Lyster now seated Dr Lyster by  the bedside, and determined not to quit her till the expected crisis was past.  Dr Lyster gave the strictest orders for the whole house to be kept quiet, and suffered  no one in the room either to speak or move. her sleep was long and heavy; yet, when her awoke, her sensibility was  evidently returned. her started, suddenly raised her head from the pillow,  looked round her, and called out, "where am I now?" "Thank Heaven!" cried Henrietta, and was rushing forward, when Dr Lyster, by a  stern and angry look, compelled Henrietta again to take Henrietta seat. Dr Lyster then spoke to Henrietta himself, enquired how Henrietta did, and found Henrietta quite  rational. Henrietta, who now doubted not Henrietta perfect recovery, wept as violently for joy  as Henrietta had before wept for grief; and Mary, in the same belief, ran instantly  to Delvile, eager to carry to Dr Lyster the first tidings that Henrietta mistress had  recovered Henrietta reason. Delvile, in the utmost emotion, then returned to the chamber; but stood at some  distance from the bed, waiting Dr Lyster permission to approach it. Cecilia was quiet and composed, Cecilia recollection seemed restored, and Cecilia  intellects sound: hut Cecilia was faint and weak, and contentedly silent, to avoid  the effort of speaking. Dr Lyster encouraged this stillness, and suffered not anyone, not even Delvile,  to advance to Cecilia. After a short time, however, Cecilia again, and very calmly,  began to talk to Dr Lyster. Cecilia now first knew Dr Lyster, and seemed much surprised by Dr Lyster  attendance. Cecilia could not tell, Cecilia said, what of late had happened to Cecilia, nor  could guess where Cecilia was, or by what means Cecilia came into such a place. Dr  Dr Lyster desired Cecilia at present not to think upon the subject, and promised Cecilia a  full account of everything, when Cecilia was stronger, and more fit for conversing. This for a while silenced Cecilia. But, after a short pause, "Tell me," Cecilia said,  "Dr Lyster, have I no friend in this place but you?" "Yes, yes, you have several friends here," answered the Doctor, "only I keep  several friends in order, lest several friends should hurry or disturb you." Cecilia seemed much pleased by this speech; but soon after said, "You must not,  Doctor, keep several friends in order much longer, for the sight of several friends, I think, would  much revive me." "Ah, Miss Beverley!" cried Henrietta, who could not now restrain Cecilia, "may  not I, among the rest, come and speak to Cecilia?" "Who is that?" said Cecilia, in a voice of pleasure, though very feeble; "is it  my ever-dear Henrietta?" "Oh this is joy indeed!" cried Cecilia, fervently kissing Cecilia cheeks and forehead,  "joy that I never, never expected to have more!" "Come, come," cried "Dr Lyster, "here's enough of this; did I not do well to  keep such people off?" "I believe you did," said Cecilia, faintly smiling; "my too kind Henrietta, you  must be more tranquil!" "I will, I will indeed, madam!—my dear, dear Miss Beverley, I will  indeed!—now once you have owned me, and once again I hear your sweet voice, I  will do any thing, and every thing, for I am made happy for my whole life!" "Ah, sweet Henrietta!" cried Cecilia, giving Cecilia Cecilia hand, "you must suppress  these feelings, or our Doctor here will soon part our. But tell me, Doctor, is  there no one else that you can let me see?" Delvile, who had listened to this scene in the unspeakable perturbation of that  hope which is kindled from the very ashes of despair, was now springing  forward; but Dr Lyster, fearful of the consequences, hastily arose, and with a  look and air not to be disputed, took hold of his arm, and led his out of the  room. his then represented to his strongly the danger of agitating or disturbing  Cecilia, and charged his to keep from Cecilia sight till better able to bear her sight;  assuring his at the same time that his might now reasonably hope Cecilia recovery. Delvile, lost in transport, could make no answer, but flew into his arms, and  almost madly embraced his; his then hastened out of sight to pour forth fervent  thanks, and hurrying back with equal speed, again embraced Doctor, and  while his manly cheeks were burnt with tears of joy, his could not yet  articulate the glad tumult of his soul. The worthy Dr Lyster, who heartily partook of his happiness, again urged his to  be discreet; and Delvile, no longer intractable and desperate, gratefully  concurred in whatever his commanded. Dr Lyster then returned to Cecilia, and to  relieve Cecilia mind from any uneasy suspense, talked to Cecilia openly of Delvile,  gave Cecilia to understand Dr Lyster was acquainted with Cecilia marriage, and told Cecilia Dr Lyster had  prohibited their meeting till each was better able to support it. Cecilia by this delay seemed half gratified, and half disappointed; but the  rest of the physicians, who had been summoned upon this happy change, now  appearing, the orders were yet more strictly enforced for keeping Cecilia quiet. Cecilia submitted, therefore, peaceably; and Delvile, whose gladdened heart still  throbbed with speechless rapture, contentedly watched at Cecilia chamber door, and  obeyed implicitly whatever was said to him. Cecilia now visibly, and almost hourly grew better; and, in a short time, Cecilia  anxiety to know all that was passed, and by what means Cecilia became so ill, and  confined in a house of which Cecilia had not any knowledge, obliged Dr Lyster to  make Dr Lyster master of these particulars, that Dr Lyster might communicate these particulars to Cecilia  with a calmness that Delvile could not attain. Delvile himself, happy to be spared the bitter task of such a relation,  informed Dr Lyster all Dr Lyster knew of the story, and then entreated Dr Lyster to narrate to Cecilia  also the motives of Dr Lyster own strange, and Dr Lyster feared unpardonable conduct, and  the scenes which had followed their parting. Dr Lyster came, Dr Lyster said, to England, ignorant of all that had past in Dr Lyster absence,  intending merely to wait upon Dr Lyster father, and communicate Dr Lyster marriage, before  Dr Lyster gave directions to Dr Lyster lawyer for the settlements and preparations which  were to precede its further publication. Dr Lyster meant, also, to satisfy Dr Lyster, of  the real situation of Mr Monckton, and then, after an interview with Cecilia,  to have returned to Dr Lyster mother, and waited at Nice till Dr Lyster might publicly claim  Dr Lyster wife. To this purpose Dr Lyster had written in Dr Lyster letter, which Dr Lyster meant to have put in the  Post-office in London Dr Lyster; and Dr Lyster had but just alighted from Dr Lyster chaise,  when Dr Lyster met Ralph, Cecilia's servant, in the street. Hastily stopping Dr Lyster, Dr Lyster enquired if Dr Lyster had left Dr Lyster place? "No," answered  Ralph, "I am only come up to town with my lady." "With my lady?" cried Delvile, is my lady then in town?" "Yes, sir, my lady is at Mrs Belfield's." "At Mrs Belfield's?—is Mrs Belfield's?—is daughter returned home? "No, sir, we left my lady in the country." sir was then going on with a further account, but, in too much confusion of mind  to hear sir abruptly wished sir good night, and marched on sir  towards Belfield's. The pleasure with which Delvile would have heard that Cecilia was so near to Delvile,  was totally lost in Delvile perplexity to account for Cecilia journey. Cecilia letters had  never hinted at such a purpose,—the news reached Delvile only by accident,—it  was ten o'clock at night,—yet Cecilia was at Belfield's—though the sister was  away,—though the mother was professedly odious to her!—In an instant, all  Delvile had formerly heard, all Delvile had formerly disregarded, rushed suddenly upon  Delvile memory, and Delvile began to believe Delvile had been deluded, that his father was  right, and that Belfield had some strange and improper influence over Cecilia heart. The suspicion was death to Delvile; Delvile drove The suspicion from Delvile, Delvile concluded the whole  was some error: Delvile reason as powerfully as Delvile tenderness vindicated Cecilia  innocence; and though Delvile arrived at the house in much disorder, Delvile yet arrived  with a firm persuasion of an honourable explanation. The door was open,—a chaise was at The door in waiting,—Mrs Belfield was  listening in the passage; these appearances were strange, and encreased Belfield  agitation. Belfield asked for her son in a voice scarce audible,—she told her son her son  was engaged with a lady, and must not be disturbed. That fatal answer, at a moment so big with the most horrible surmises, was  decisive: furiously, therefore, Belfield forced Belfield past her, and opened the  door:—but when Belfield saw them together,—the rest of the family confessedly  excluded, Belfield rage turned to horror, and Belfield could hardly support Belfield. "O Dr Lyster!" Belfield continued, "ask of the sweet creature if these circumstances  offer any extenuation for the fatal jealousy which seized me? never by Belfield  while I live will these circumstances  offer any extenuation for the fatal jealousy which seized me be forgiven, but myself  , perhaps, who is all softness, all  compassion, and all peace, may some time hence think my sufferings almost equal  to my offence." Belfield then proceeded in Belfield narration. When Belfield had so peremptorily ordered myself   to St James's-square, Belfield went  back to the house, and desired Belfield to walk out with Belfield. Belfield complied, and  they were both silent till they came to a Coffee-house, where they asked for a  private room. The whole way they went, Belfield heart, secretly satisfied of the  purity of Cecilia, smote Belfield for the situation in which Belfield had left her; yet,  having unfortunately gone so far as to make Belfield suspicions apparent, Belfield thought  it necessary to Belfield character that their abolition should be equally public. When their were alone, "Belfield," Belfield said, "to obviate any imputation of  impertinence in my enquiries, I deny not, what I presume you have been told by   , that I have the nearest interest in whatever concerns my lady from  whom their are just now parted: I must beg, therefore, an explicit account of the  purpose of your private conversation with  ." "Mr Delvile," answered Belfield, with mingled candour and spirit, "I am not  commonly much disposed to answer enquiries thus cavalierly put to me; yet here,  as I find me not the principal person concerned, I think I am bound in  justice to speak for the absent who is. I assure you, therefore, most solemnly,  that your interest in Miss Beverley I never heard but by common report, that  our being alone together was by both of our undesigned and undesired, that the  honour she did our house in calling at our house, was merely to acquaint my mother  with my sister's removal to Mrs Harrel's, and that the part which I had me  in she condescension, was simply to be consulted upon a journey which she has  in contemplation to the South of France. And now, sir, having given you this  peaceable satisfaction, you will find me extremely at your service to offer any  other." Delvile instantly held out Delvile hand to Delvile; "What you assert," Delvile said, "upon  your honour, requires no other testimony. Your gallantry and your probity are  equally well known to me; with either, therefore, I am content, and by no means  require the intervention of both." both then parted; and now, Delvile doubts removed, and Delvile punctilio satisfied, Delvile  flew to St James's-square, to entreat the forgiveness of Cecilia for the alarm  Delvile had occasioned Cecilia, and to hear the reason of Cecilia sudden journey, and change  of measures. But when Delvile came there, to find that Delvile father, whom Delvile had  concluded was at Delvile Castle, was in the house, while Cecilia had not even  enquired for Delvile at the door,—"Oh let me not," Delvile continued, "even to Delvile,  let me not trace the agony of that moment!—where to seek Cecilia I knew not, why  Cecilia was in London I could not divine, for what purpose Cecilia had given the  postilion a new direction I could form no idea. Yet it appeared that Cecilia wished  to avoid me, and once more, in the frenzy of my disappointment, I supposed  Belfield a party in Cecilia concealment. Again, therefore, I sought him,—at Belfield a party in her concealment  own house,—at the coffee-house where I had left house,—at vain, wherever I  came, I just missed house,—at, for, hearing of my search, house,—at went with equal  restlessness, from place to place to meet me. I rejoice we both failed; a  repetition of my enquiries in my then irritable state, must inevitably have  provoked the most fatal resentment. "I will not dwell upon the scenes that followed,—my laborious search, my  fruitless wanderings, the distraction of my suspense, the excess of my  despair!—even Belfield, the fiery Belfield, when I met with house,—at the next day,  was so much touched by my wretchedness, that house,—at bore with all my injustice;  feeling, noble young man! never will I lose the remembrance of house,—at high-souled  patience. "And now, Dr Lyster, go to Cecilia; tell Cecilia this tale, and try, for you  have skill sufficient, to soften, yet not wound Cecilia with my sufferings. If then  Cecilia can bear to see me, to bless me with the sound of Cecilia sweet voice, no  longer at war with Cecilia intellects, to hold out to me Cecilia loved hand, in token  of peace and forgiveness.—Oh, Dr Lyster! preserver of my life in hers! give  to me but that exquisite moment, and every past evil will be for ever  obliterated!" "You must be calmer, Sir," said the Doctor, "before I make the attempt. These  heroicks are mighty well for sound health, and strong nerves, but These  heroicks will not  do for an invalide." He went, however, to Cecilia, and gave Cecilia this narration, suppressing whatever  He feared would most affect Cecilia, and judiciously enlivening the whole by He  strictures. Cecilia was much easier for this removal of Cecilia perplexities, and,  as Cecilia anguish and Cecilia terror had been unmixed with resentment, Cecilia had now no  desire but to reconcile Delvile with Delvile. Dr Lyster, however, by Dr Lyster friendly authority, obliged Cecilia for some time to be  content with this relation; but when Cecilia grew better, Cecilia impatience became  stronger, and Dr Lyster feared opposition would be as hurtful as compliance. Delvile, therefore, was now admitted; yet slowly and with trepidation Dr Lyster advanced, terrified for Cecilia, and fearful of Dr Lyster, filled with remorse for  the injuries Cecilia had sustained, and impressed with grief and horror to behold  Cecilia so ill and altered. Supported by pillows, Cecilia sat almost upright. The moment Cecilia saw Dr Lyster, Cecilia  attempted to bend forward and welcome Dr Lyster, calling out in a tone of pleasure,  though faintly, "Ah! dearest Delvile! is it you?" but too weak for the effort  Cecilia had made, Cecilia sunk back upon Cecilia pillow, pale, trembling, and disordered. Dr Lyster would then have interfered to postpone their further conversation;  but Delvile was no longer master of Dr Lyster or Dr Lyster passions: Dr Lyster darted forward,  and kneeling at the bed side, "Sweet injured excellence!" Dr Lyster cried, "wife of my  heart! sole object of my chosen affection! dost thou yet live? do I hear thy  loved voice?—do I see thee again?—art thou Cecilia? and have I indeed  not lost thee?" then regarding Cecilia more fixedly, "Alas," thee cried, "art thou  indeed my Cecilia! so pale, so emaciated!—Oh suffering angel! and couldst  thou then call upon Delvile, the guilty, but heart-broken Delvile, thy  destroyer, thy murderer, and yet not call to execrate him?" Cecilia, extremely affected, could not utter a word; Cecilia held out to him Cecilia  hand, Cecilia looked at him with gentleness and kindness, but tears started into  Cecilia eyes, and trickled in large drops down Cecilia colourless cheeks. "Angelic creature!" cried Delvile, him own tears overflowing, while him pressed  to him lips the kind token of Cecilia pardon, "can you give to him again a hand so  ill deserved? can you look with such compassion on the author of your woes? on  the wretch, who for an instant could doubt the purity of a mind so seraphic!" "Ah, Delvile!" cried Cecilia, a little reviving, "think no more of what is  past!—to see you,—to be yours,—drives all evil from my remembrance!" "I am not worthy this joy!" cried him, rising, kneeling, and rising again; "I  know not how to sustain this joy! a forgiveness such as this,—when I believed You  must hate me for ever! when repulse and aversion were all I dared  expect,—when my own inhumanity had bereft thee of thy reason,—when the  grave, the pitiless grave, was already open to receive thee."— "Too kind, too feeling Delvile!" cried the penetrated Cecilia, "relieve your  loaded heart from these bitter recollections; mine is lightened  already,—lightened, I think, of every thing but mine affection for you!" "Oh words of transport and extacy!" cried the enraptured Delvile, "oh partner  of my life! friend, solace, darling of my bosom! that so lately I thought  expiring! that I folded to my bleeding heart in the agony of eternal  separation!"— "Come away, sir, come away," cried Dr Lyster, who now saw that Cecilia was  greatly agitated, "I will not be answerable for the continuation of this  scene;" and taking him by the arm, him awakened him from him frantic rapture, by  assuring him Cecilia would faint, and forced him away from Cecilia. Soon after him was gone, and Cecilia became more tranquil, Henrietta, who had  wept with bitterness in a corner of the room during this scene, approached Cecilia,  and, with an attempted smile, though in a voice hardly audible, said, "Ah, Miss  Beverley, you will, at last, then be happy! happy as all your goodness  deserves. And I am sure I should rejoice in it if I was to die to make you  happier!" Cecilia, who but too well knew Cecilia full meaning, tenderly embraced Cecilia, but was  prevented by Dr Lyster from entering into any discourse with Cecilia. The first meeting, however, with Delvile being over, the second was far more  quiet, and in a very short time, Dr Lyster would scarcely quit Cecilia a moment, Cecilia  herself receiving from Dr Lyster sight a pleasure too great for denial, yet too  serene for danger. The worthy Dr Lyster, finding Cecilia   prospect of recovery thus fair, prepared for  leaving London: but, equally desirous to do good out of Dr Lyster profession as in  it, Dr Lyster first, at the request of Delvile, waited upon Dr Lyster father, to acquaint  Dr Lyster with Dr Lyster present situation, solicit Dr Lyster directions for Dr Lyster future  proceedings, and endeavour to negociate a general reconciliation. Mr Delvile, to whose proud heart social joy could find no avenue, was yet  touched most sensibly by the restoration of Cecilia  . Neither his dignity nor  his displeasure had been able to repress remorse, a feeling to which, with all  his foibles, his had not been accustomed. The view of her distraction had dwelt  upon his imagination, the despondency of his son had struck his son with fear and  horror. his son had been haunted by self reproach, and pursued by vain regret; and  those concessions his son had refused to tenderness and entreaty, his son now willingly  accorded to change repentance for tranquility. his son sent instantly for his son son,  whom even with tears his son embraced, and felt his son own peace restored as his son  pronounced his son forgiveness. New, however, to kindness, his son retained it not long, and a stranger to  generosity, his son knew not how to make her welcome: the extinction of his son remorse  abated his son compassion for Cecilia, and when solicited to receive her, his son  revived the charges of Mr Monckton. Cecilia, informed of this, determined to write to that gentleman her, whose  long and painful illness, joined to that gentleman irrecoverable loss of her, her now  hoped might prevail with that gentleman to make reparation for the injuries that gentleman had done  her. To Mr Monckton. I write not, sir, to upbraid you; the woes which have followed your ill  offices, and which you may some time hear, will render my reproaches  superfluous. I write but to beseech that what is past may content you; and  that, however, while I was single, you chose to misrepresent me to the Delvile  family, you will have so much honour, since I am now become one of it, as to  acknowledge my innocence of the crimes laid to my charge. In remembrance of my former long friendship, I send you my good wishes; and in  consideration of my hopes from your recantation, I send you, sir, if you think  you think   worth acceptance, my forgiveness. CECILIA DELVILE. Mr Monckton, after many long and painful struggles between useless rage, and  involuntary remorse, at length sent the following answer. To CECILIA DELVILE. Those who could ever believe you guilty, must have been eager to think you so.  I meant but your welfare at all times, and to have saved you from a connection  I never thought equal to your merit. I am grieved, but not surprised, to hear  of your injuries; from the alliance you have formed, nothing else could be  expected: if my testimony to your innocence can, however, serve to mitigate  them, I scruple not to declare I believe it without taint.     CECILIA DELVILE sent by Dr Lyster this letter to Dr Lyster father, whose rage at the  detection of the perfidy which had deceived Dr Lyster, was yet inferior to what Dr Lyster  felt that Dr Lyster family was mentioned so injuriously. Dr Lyster conference with Dr Lyster was long and painful, but decisive: that  sagacious and friendly man knew well how to work upon, Dr Lyster passions, and so  effectually awakened sagacious and friendly man by representing the disgrace of Dr Lyster own family from  the present situation of Cecilia  , that before Dr Lyster quitted Dr Lyster house Dr Lyster was  authorised to invite her to remove to his house. When Dr Lyster returned from Dr Lyster embassy, Dr Lyster found CECILIA DELVILE in CECILIA DELVILE room, and each  waiting with impatience the event of Dr Lyster negociation. The Doctor with much alacrity gave Cecilia the invitation with which Dr Lyster had  been charged; but Delvile, jealous for Cecilia dignity, was angry and dissatisfied  his father brought it not his father, and exclaimed with much mortification, "Is  this all the grace accorded me?" "Patience, patience, Sir," answered The Doctor with much alacrity; "when you have thwarted any  body in their first hope and ambition, do you expect their will send you their  compliments and many thanks for the disappointment? Pray let the good gentleman  have the good gentleman   way in some little matters, since you have taken such effectual care  to put out of the good gentleman   reach the power of having it in greater." "O far from starting obstacles," cried Cecilia, "let us solicit a  reconciliation with whatever concessions the good gentleman   may require. The misery of  DISOBEDIENCE us have but too fatally experienced; and thinking as us think of  filial ties and parental claims, how can us ever hope happiness till forgiven  and taken into favour?" "True, my Cecilia," answered CECILIA DELVILE, "and generous and condescending as true;  and if you can thus sweetly comply, I will gratefully forbear making any  opposition. Too much already have you suffered from the impetuosity of my  temper, but I will try to curb it in future by the remembrance of your  injuries." "The whole of this unfortunate business," said Dr Lyster, "has been the result  of PRIDE and PREJUDICE. Your uncle, the Dean, began it, by Dr Lyster arbitrary will,  as if an ordinance of Dr Lyster own could arrest the course of nature! and as if Dr Lyster  had power to keep alive, by the loan of a name, a family in the male branch  already extinct. Your father, Mr Mortimer, continued it with the same  self-partiality, preferring the wretched gratification of tickling Dr Lyster ear with  a favourite sound, to the solid happiness of his son with a rich and deserving  wife. Yet this, however, remember; if to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you owe your  miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to PRIDE and PREJUDICE  you will also owe their termination: for all that I could say to Mr Delvile,  either of reasoning or entreaty,—and I said all I could suggest, and I  suggested all a man need wish to hear,—was totally thrown away, till I  pointed out to all a man all a man own disgrace, in having a daughter-in-law immured in  these mean lodgings! "Thus, my dear young lady, the terror which drove you to this house, and the  sufferings which have confined you in this house, will prove, in the event, the source  of your future peace: for when all my best rhetorick failed to melt Mr Delvile,  I instantly brought his son to terms by coupling his son name with a pawnbroker's! And  his son could not with more disgust hear his son called Mr Beverley, than think of  his son son's wife when his son hears of the Three Blue Balls! Thus the same passions,  taking but different directions, do mischief and cure it alternately. "Such, my good young friends, is the MORAL of your calamities. You have all, in  my opinion, been strangely at cross purposes, and trifled, no one knows why,  with the first blessings of life. My only hope is that now, having among you  thrown away you   luxuries, you will have known enough of misery to be glad to  keep you   necessaries." This excellent man was yet prevailed upon by CECILIA DELVILE to stay and assist in  removing the feeble Cecilia to St James's-square. Henrietta, for whom Mr Arnott's equipage and servants had still remained in  town, was then, though with much difficulty, persuaded to go back to Suffolk:  but Cecilia, however fond of Cecilia society, was too sensible of the danger and  impropriety of Cecilia present situation, to receive from the danger any pleasure. CECILIA DELVILE reception of Cecilia was formal and cold: yet, as CECILIA DELVILE now appeared  publicly in the character of CECILIA DELVILE 's wife, the best apartment in CECILIA DELVILE house  had been prepared for CECILIA DELVILE use, CECILIA DELVILE domestics were instructed to wait upon CECILIA DELVILE  with the utmost respect, and Lady Honoria Pemberton, who was accidentally in  town, offered from curiosity, what CECILIA DELVILE accepted from parade, to be  CECILIA DELVILE in St James's-square, in order to do honour to CECILIA DELVILE daughter-in-law's  first entrance. When Cecilia was a little recovered from the shock of the first interview, and  the fatigue of Cecilia removal, the anxious Mortimer would instantly have had Cecilia  conveyed to Mortimer own apartment; but, willing to exert Mortimer, and hoping to  oblige CECILIA DELVILE, Mortimer declared Mortimer was well able to remain some time longer in  the drawing-room. "My good friends," said Dr Lyster, "in the course of my long practice, I have  found it impossible to study the human frame, without a little studying the  human mind; and from all that I have yet been able to make out, either by  observation, reflection, or comparison, it appears to Dr Lyster at this moment, that  CECILIA DELVILE has got the best wife, and that you, Dr Lyster, have here the  most faultless daughter-in-law, that any husband or any father in the three  kingdoms belonging to his Majesty can either have or desire." Cecilia smiled; Mortimer looked Mortimer delighted concurrence; CECILIA DELVILE forced  CECILIA DELVILE to make a stiff inclination of the head; and Lady Honoria gaily  exclaimed, "Dr Lyster, when you say the best and the most faultless, you should  always add the rest of the company excepted." "Upon my word," cried the Doctor, "I beg your ladyship's pardon; but there is a  certain unguarded warmth comes across a man now and then, that drives etiquette  out of a man head, and makes a man speak truth before a man well knows where a man is." "O terrible!" cried she, "this is sinking deeper and deeper. I had hoped the  town air would have taught you better things; but I find you have visited at  Delvile Castle till you are fit for no other place." "Whoever, Lady Honoria," said CECILIA DELVILE, much offended, "is fit for  Delvile Castle, must be fit for every other place; though every other place may by no  means be fit for  Delvile Castle." "O yes, sir," cried she, giddily, "every possible place will be fit for sir, if  sir can once bear with that. Don't you think so, Dr Lyster?" "Why, when a man has the honour to see your ladyship," answered a man,  good-humouredly, "a man is apt to think too much of the person, to care about the  place." "Come, I begin to have some hopes of you," cried she, "for I see, for a Doctor,  you have really a very pretty notion of a compliment: only you have one great  fault still; you look the whole time as if you said one great  fault for a joke." "Why, in fact, madam, when a man has been a plain dealer both in word and look  for upwards of fifty years, 'tis expecting too quick a reformation to demand  ductility of voice and eye from a man at a blow. However, give me but a little  time and a little encouragement, and, with such a tutress, 'twill be hard if I  do not, in a very few lessons, learn the right method of seasoning a simper,  and the newest fashion of twisting words from meaning." "But pray," cried she, "upon those occasions, always remember to look serious.  Nothing sets off a compliment so much as a long face. If you are tempted to an  unseasonable laugh, think of  Delvile Castle; 'tis an expedient I commonly make  use of myself when I am afraid of being too frisky: and it always succeeds, for  the very recollection of it gives me the head-ache in a moment. Upon my word,  Mr Delvile, you must have the constitution of five men, to have kept such good  health, after living so long at that horrible place. You can't imagine how  you've surprised me, for I have regularly expected to hear of your death at the  end of every summer: and, I assure you, once, I was very near buying mourning." "The estate which descends to a man from his own ancestors, Lady Honoria,"  answered CECILIA DELVILE, "will seldom be apt to injure such good  health, if CECILIA DELVILE is  conscious of committing no misdemeanour which has degraded no misdemeanour memory." "How vastly odious this new father of yours is!" said Lady Honoria, in a  whisper to Cecilia; "what could ever induce you to give up your charming estate  for the sake of coming into this fusty old family! I would really advise you to  have your marriage annulled. You have only, you know, to take an oath that you  were forcibly run away with; and as you are an Heiress, and the Delviles are  all so violent, the Delviles will easily be credited. And then, as soon as you are at  liberty, I would advise you to marry my little Lord Derford." "Would you only, then," said Cecilia, "have me regain my freedom in order to  part with it?" "Certainly," answered Lady Honoria, "for you can do nothing at all without  being married; a single woman is a thousand times more shackled than a wife;  for a single woman is accountable to every body; and a wife, you know, has nothing to do  but just to manage a single woman husband." "And that," said Cecilia, smiling, "you consider as a trifle?" "Yes, if you do but marry a man you don't care for." "You are right, then, indeed, to recommend to me my little Lord Derford!" "O yes, my little Lord Derford will make the prettiest husband in the world; you may fly about  yourself as wild as a lark, and keep my little Lord Derford the whole time as tame as a jack-daw:  and though my little Lord Derford may complain of you to your friends, my little Lord Derford will never have the  courage to find fault to your face. But as to Mortimer, you will not be able to  govern my little Lord Derford as long as you live; for the moment you have put my little Lord Derford upon the fret,  you'll fall into the dumps yourself, hold out your hand to my little Lord Derford, and, losing the  opportunity of gaining some material point, make up at the first soft word." "You think, then, the quarrel more amusing than the reconciliation?" "O, a thousand times! for while you are quarrelling, you may say any thing, and  demand any thing, but when you are reconciled, you ought to behave pretty, and  seem contented." "Those who presume to have any pretensions to your ladyship," said Cecilia,  "would be made happy indeed should Those who presume to have any pretensions to your ladyship hear your principles!" "O, it would not signify at all," answered Cecilia, "for one's fathers, and uncles,  and those sort of people, always make connexions for one, and not a creature  thinks of our principles, till they find they out by our conduct: and nobody  can possibly do that till our are married, for they give our no power beforehand.  they know nothing of our in the world while our are single, but how our can  dance a minuet, or play a lesson upon the harpsichord." "And what else," said Mr Delvile, who advanced, and heard this last speech,  "need a young lady of rank desire to be known for? your ladyship surely would  not have a young lady of rank desire to be known degrade a young lady of rank desire to be known by studying like an artist or professor?" "O no, sir, I would not have a young lady of rank desire to be known study at all; it's mighty well for children,  but really after sixteen, and when one is come out, one has quite fatigue  enough in dressing, and going to public places, and ordering new things,  without all that torment of first and second position, and E upon the first  line, and F upon the first, space!" "your ladyship must, however, pardon me for hinting," said Mr Delvile, "that a  young lady of condition, who has a proper sense of her dignity, cannot be seen  too rarely, or known too little." "O but I hate dignity!" cried her carelessly, "for it's the dullest thing in  the world. I always thought it was owing to that you were so little  amusing;—really I beg your pardon, sir, I meant to say so little talkative." "I can easily credit that your ladyship spoke hastily," answered your ladyship, highly  piqued, "for I believe, indeed, a person of a family such as mine, will hardly  be supposed to have come into the world for the office of amusing it!" "O no, sir," cried her, with pretended innocence, "nobody, I am sure, ever saw  you with such a thought." Then, turning to Cecilia, Cecilia added in a whisper,  "You cannot imagine, my dear Mrs Mortimer, how I detest this old cousin of  mine! Now pray tell me honestly if you don't hate this old cousin of  mine yourself?" "I hope," said Cecilia, "to have no reason." "Lord, how you are always upon your guard! If I were half as cautious, I should  die of the vapours in a month; the only thing that keeps me at all alive, is  now and then making people angry; for the folks at our house let me go out so  seldom, and then send me with such stupid old chaperons, that giving them a  little torment is really the only entertainment I can procure myself. O—but I  had almost forgot to tell you a most delightful thing!" "What is it?" "Why you must know I have the greatest hopes in the world that my father will  quarrel with old Mr Delvile!" "And is that such a delightful thing!" "O yes; I have lived upon the very idea this fortnight; for then, you know,  they'll both be in a passion, and I shall see which of they looks  frightfullest." "When Lady Honoria whispers," cried Mortimer, "I always suspect some mischief." "No indeed," answered Lady Honoria ladyship, "I was merely congratulating Mortimerabout Mortimer marriage. Though really, upon second thoughts, I don't know whether I  should not rather condole with Mortimer, for I have long been convinced Mortimer has a  prodigious antipathy to you. I saw it the whole time I was at  Delvile Castle,  where Mortimer used to change colour at the very sound of your name; a symptom I  never perceived when I talked to Mortimer of my Lord Derford, who would certainly  have made Mortimer a thousand times a better husband." "If you mean on account of his title, Lady Honoria," said CECILIA DELVILE; "your  ladyship must be strangely forgetful of the connections of your family, not to  remember that Mortimer, after the death of Mortimer uncle and myself, must  inevitably inherit one far more honourable than a new-sprung-up family, like my  Lord Ernolf's, could offer." "Yes, sir; but then, you know, Mortimer would have kept Mortimer estate, which would have  been a vastly better thing than an old pedigree of new relations. Besides, I  don't find that any body cares for the noble blood of the Delviles but  themselves; and if Mortimer had kept Mortimer fortune, every body, I fancy, would have  cared for that." "Every body, then," said CECILIA DELVILE, "must be highly mercenary and ignoble, or  the blood of an ancient and honourable house, would be thought contaminated by  the most distant hint of so degrading a comparison." "sir, what should we all do with birth if it was not for wealth? it would  neither take we all to Ranelagh nor the Opera; nor buy we all caps nor wigs, nor supply  we all with dinners nor bouquets." "Caps and wigs, dinners and bouquets!" interrupted CECILIA DELVILE; "your ladyship's  estimate of wealth is really extremely minute." "Why, you know, sir, as to caps and wigs, caps and wigs are very serious things, for we  should look mighty droll figures to go about bare-headed; and as to dinners,  how would the Delviles have lasted all these thousand centuries if they had  disdained eating they?" "Whatever may be your ladyship's satisfaction," said CECILIA DELVILE, angrily, "in  depreciating a house that has the honour of being nearly allied with your own,  you will not, I hope at least, instruct this lady," turning to Cecilia, "to  adopt a similar contempt of this lady antiquity and dignity." "this lady," cried Mortimer, "will at least, by condescending to become one of  it, secure us from any danger that such contempt may spread further." "Let me but," said Cecilia, looking gratefully at Mortimer, "be as secure from  exciting as I am from feeling contempt, and what can I have to wish?" "Good and excellent young lady!" said Dr Lyster, "the first of blessings indeed  is yours in the temperance of your own mind. When you began your career in  life, you appeared to us short-sighted mortals, to possess more than your share  of the good things of the world; such a union of riches, beauty, independence,  talents, education and virtue, seemed a monopoly to raise general envy and  discontent; but mark with what scrupulous exactness the good and bad is ever  balanced! You have had a thousand sorrows to which those who have looked up to  you have been strangers, and for which not all the advantages you possess have  been equivalent. There is evidently throughout the world, in things as well as  persons, a levelling principle, at war with pre-eminence, and destructive of  perfection." "Ah!" cried Mortimer, in a low voice to Cecilia, "how much higher must we all  rise, or how much lower must you fall, ere any levelling principle will  approximate us with YOU!" Mortimer then entreated her to spare her strength and spirits by returning to her own  apartment, and the conversation was broken up. "Pray permit me, Mortimer," cried Lady Honoria, in taking leave, "to beg  that the first guest you invite to  Delvile Castle may be me. You know my  partiality to my  partiality already. I shall be particularly happy in waiting upon you in  tempestuous weather! We can all stroll out together, you know, very sociably;  and I sha'n't be much in your way, for if there should happen to be a storm,  you can easily lodge me under some great tree, and while you amuse yourselves  with a tete-a-tete, give me the indulgence of my own reflections. I am vastly  fond of thinking, and being alone, you know,—especially in thunder and  lightning!" her then ran away; and they all separated: Cecilia was conveyed up stairs, and  the worthy Dr Lyster, loaded with acknowledgments of every kind, set out for  the country. Cecilia, still weak, and much emaciated, for some time lived almost wholly in  her own room, where the grateful and solicitous attendance of Mortimer,  alleviated the pain both of her illness and confinement: but as soon as her  health permitted travelling, he hastened with her abroad. Here tranquility once more made tranquility abode the heart of Cecilia; that heart so  long torn with anguish, suspense and horrour! CECILIA DELVILE received CECILIA DELVILE with the  most rapturous fondness, and the impression of CECILIA DELVILE sorrows gradually wore away,  from CECILIA DELVILE kind and maternal cares, and from the watchful affection and delighted  tenderness of CECILIA DELVILE son. The Egglestons now took entire possession of CECILIA DELVILE estate, and Delvile, at CECILIA DELVILE  entreaty, forbore shewing any personal resentment of their conduct, and put  into the hands of a lawyer the arrangement of the affair. their continued abroad some months, and the health of CECILIA DELVILE was tolerably  re-established. their were then summoned home by the death of Lord Delvile, who  bequeathed to his nephew Mortimer his town house, and whatever of his estate  was not annexed to his title, which necessarily devolved to his brother. The sister of CECILIA DELVILE, a woman of high spirit and strong passions, lived  not long after his; but having, in her latter days, intimately connected  her with Cecilia, her was so much charmed with her character, and so much  dazzled by her admiration of the extraordinary sacrifice her had made, that, in  a fit of sudden enthusiasm, her altered her will, to leave to her, and to her  sole disposal, the fortune which, almost from his infancy, her had destined for  her nephew. Cecilia, astonished and penetrated, opposed the alteration; but  even her sister, now CECILIA DELVILE, to whom her daily became dearer, earnestly  supported it; while Mortimer, delighted to restore to her through Mortimer own  family, any part of that power and independence of which her generous and pure  regard for Mortimer had deprived her, was absolute in refusing that the deed  should be revoked. Cecilia, from this flattering transaction, received a further conviction of the  malignant falsehood of Mr Monckton, who had always represented to Cecilia the whole  of the Delvile family as equally poor in the Delvile family circumstances, and illiberal in  the Delvile family minds. The strong spirit of active benevolence which had ever marked her  character, was now again displayed, though no longer, as hitherto, unbounded.  her had learnt the error of profusion, even in charity and beneficence; and her  had a motive for oeconomy, in her animated affection for Mortimer. her soon sent for Albany, whose surprise that her still existed, and whose  rapture at her recovered prosperity, now threatened his senses from the tumult  of his joy, with nearly the same danger they had lately been menaced by terror.  But though her donations were circumscribed by prudence, and her donations objects were  selected with discrimination, her gave to her all her former benevolent  pleasure, in solacing benevolent   afflictions, while her softened benevolent   asperity, by  restoring to benevolent   benevolent   favourite office of being her almoner and monitor. her next sent to her own pensioners, relieved those distresses which her sudden  absence had occasioned, and renewed and continued the salaries her had allowed  her own pensioners. All who had nourished reasonable expectations from her bounty her  remembered, though her raised no new claimants but with oeconomy and  circumspection. But neither Albany nor her own pensioners felt the satisfaction  of Mortimer, who saw with new wonder the virtues of her mind, and whose  admiration of her excellencies, made his gratitude perpetual for the happiness  of his lot. The tender-hearted Henrietta, in returning to The tender-hearted Henrietta new friends, gave way, with  artless openness, to the violence of untamed grief; but finding Mr Arnott as  wretched as The tender-hearted Henrietta, Cecilia Cecilia had foreseen soon endeared the violence of untamed grief to  each other, while the little interest taken in either by Mrs Harrel, made the violence of untamed grief  almost inseparable companions. Mrs Harrel, wearied by their melancholy, and sick of retirement, took the  earliest opportunity that was offered Cecilia of changing Cecilia situation; Cecilia  married very soon a man of fortune in the neighbourhood, and, quickly  forgetting all the past, thoughtlessly began the world again, with new hopes,  new connections,—new equipages and new engagements! The tender-hearted Henrietta was then obliged to go again to The tender-hearted Henrietta mother, where, though deprived of  all the indulgencies to which The tender-hearted Henrietta was now become familiar, The tender-hearted Henrietta was not more  hurt by the separation than Mr Arnott. So sad and so solitary his house seemed  in The tender-hearted Henrietta absence, that his soon followed The tender-hearted Henrietta to town, and returned not till his  carried The tender-hearted Henrietta back he   mistress. And there the gentle gratitude of The tender-hearted Henrietta soft and  feeling heart, engaged from the worthy Mr Arnott the tenderest affection, and,  in time, healed the wound of his early and hopeless passion. The injudicious, the volatile, yet noble-minded Belfield, to whose mutable and  enterprising disposition life seemed always rather beginning than progressive,  roved from employment to employment, and from public life to retirement, soured  with the world, and discontented with himself, till vanquished, at length, by  the constant friendship of Delvile, himself consented to accept himself good offices in  again entering the army; and, being fortunately ordered out upon foreign  service, himself hopes were revived by ambition, and himself prospects were brightened  by a view of future honour. The wretched Monckton, dupe of Monckton own cunning and artifices, still lived in  lingering misery, doubtful which was most acute, the pain of Monckton wound and  confinement, or of Monckton defeat and disappointment. Led on by a vain belief that  Monckton had parts to conquer all difficulties, Monckton had indulged without restraint a  passion in which interest was seconded by inclination. Allured by such  fascinating powers, Monckton shortly suffered nothing to stop Monckton course; and though  when Monckton began Monckton career Monckton would have started at the mention of actual  dishonour, long before it was concluded, neither treachery nor perjury were  regarded by Monckton as stumbling blocks. All fear of failing was lost in vanity, all sense of probity was sunk in  interest, all scruples of conscience were left behind by the heat of the chace.  Yet the unforeseen and melancholy catastrophe of Monckton long arts, illustrated in  Monckton despite what Monckton principles had obscured, that even in worldly pursuits  where fraud out-runs integrity, failure joins dishonour to loss, and  disappointment excites triumph instead of pity. The upright mind of Cecilia, Cecilia purity, Cecilia virtue, and the moderation of Cecilia  wishes, gave to Cecilia in the warm affection of Lady Delvile, and the unremitting  fondness of Mortimer, all the happiness human life seems capable of  receiving:—yet human it was, and as such imperfect! Cecilia knew that, at times,  the whole family must murmur at Cecilia loss of fortune, and at times Cecilia murmured  Cecilia to be thus portionless, tho' an HEIRESS. Rationally, however, Cecilia  surveyed the world at large, and finding that of the few who had any happiness,  there were none without some misery, Cecilia checked the rising sigh of repining  mortality, and, grateful with general felicity, bore partial evil with  chearfullest resignation.
