 Mean time young Delvile failed not to honour Cecilia's introduction of young Delvile to  Mr Harrel, by waiting upon that gentleman as soon as the ill effects of young Delvile  accident at the Pantheon permitted young Delvile to leave young Delvile own house.
Mr Harrel,  though just going out when young Delvile called, was desirous of being upon good terms  with young Delvile family, and therefore took young Delvile up stairs to present young Delvile to young Delvile lady,  and invited young Delvile to tea and cards the next evening.
Cecilia, who was with Mrs Harrel, did not see young Delvile without emotion; which was  not much lessened by the task of thanking young Delvile for young Delvile assistance at the  Pantheon, and enquiring how young Delvile had young Delvile fared.
No sign, however, of emotion  appeared in return, either when young Delvile first addressed, or afterwards answered her:  the look of solicitude with which her had been so much struck when Cecilia, who was with Mrs Harrel last  parted was no longer discernible, and the voice of sensibility which had  removed all her doubts, was no longer to be heard.
young Delvile general ease, and  natural gaiety were again unruffled, and though young Delvile had never seemed really  indifferent to her, there was not the least appearance of any added partiality.
her felt an involuntary mortification as her observed this change: yet,  upon reflection, her still attributed young Delvile whole behaviour to young Delvile mistake with  respect to her situation, and therefore was but the more gratified by the  preference young Delvile occasionally betrayed.
The invitation for the next evening was accepted, and her, for once, felt  no repugnance to joining the company.
Young Delvile again was in excellent  spirits; but though Young Delvile chief pleasure was evidently derived from conversing  with her, her had the vexation to observe that Young Delvile seemed to think her the  undoubted property of the Baronet, always retreating when Young Delvile approached, and as  careful, when next her, to yield Young Delvile place if Young Delvile advanced, as, when Young Delvile was  distant, to guard he advanced from all others.
But when Sir Robert was employed at cards, all scruples ceasing, Sir Robert neglected  not to engross her almost wholly.
Sir Robert was eager to speak to her of the affairs  of Mr Belfield, which Sir Robert told her wore now a better aspect.
The letter, indeed,  of recommendation which Sir Robert had shewn to her, had failed, as the nobleman to  whom it was written had already entered into an engagement for the nobleman to  whom it was written son; but the nobleman to  whom it was written  had made application elsewhere which the nobleman to  whom it was written believed would be successful, and the nobleman to  whom it was written  had communicated the nobleman to  whom it was written proceedings to Mr Belfield, whose spirits the nobleman to  whom it was written hoped would  recover by this prospect of employment and advantage.
"It is, however, but too  true," the nobleman to  whom it was written added, "that I have rather obtained the nobleman to  whom it was written consent to the steps I am  taking, than the nobleman to  whom it was written approbation of them: nor do I believe, had I previously  consulted the nobleman to  whom it was written, I should have had even that.
Disappointed in the nobleman to  whom it was written higher views,  the nobleman to  whom it was written spirit is broken, and the nobleman to  whom it was written is heartless and hopeless, scarce condescending to  accept relief, from the bitter remembrance that the nobleman to  whom it was written expected preferment.
Time,  however, will blunt this acute sensibility, and reflection will make the nobleman to  whom it was written blush  at this unreasonable delicacy.
But we must patiently soothe the nobleman to  whom it was written till the nobleman to  whom it was written is more  the nobleman to  whom it was written, or while we mean to serve, we shall only torment the nobleman to  whom it was written.
Sickness,  sorrow, and poverty have all fallen heavily upon the nobleman to  whom it was written, and Sickness,  sorrow, and poverty have all fallen  at once: we must not, therefore, wonder to find the nobleman to  whom it was written intractable, when the nobleman to  whom it was written mind  is as much depressed, as the nobleman to  whom it was written body is enervated."
Cecilia, to whom the nobleman to  whom it was written candour and generosity always gave fresh delight,  strengthened the nobleman to  whom it was written opinions by her concurrence, and confirmed the nobleman to  whom it was written designs by the  interest which her took in them.
From this time, the nobleman to  whom it was written found almost daily some occasion for calling in  Portman-square.
The application of Cecilia in favour of Mr Belfield gave the nobleman to  whom it was written a  right to communicate to Cecilia all the nobleman to  whom it was written proceedings concerning the nobleman to  whom it was written; and the nobleman to  whom it was written had some  letter to shew, some new scheme to propose, some refusal to lament, or some  hope to rejoice over, almost perpetually: or even when these failed, Ceciliahad a cold, which Cecilia came to enquire after, or Mrs Harrel gave Cecilia an  invitation, which rendered any excuse unnecessary.
But though Cecilia intimacy with  Cecilia was encreased, though Cecilia admiration of Cecilia was conspicuous, and Cecilia  fondness for Cecilia society seemed to grow with the enjoyment of her society, Cecilia yet never  manifested any doubt of Cecilia engagement with the Baronet, nor betrayed either  intention or desire to supplant Cecilia.
Cecilia, however, repined not much at the  mistake, since Cecilia thought it might be instrumental to procuring Cecilia a more  impartial acquaintance with his character, than Cecilia could rationally expect,  if, as Cecilia hoped, the explanation of his error should make his seek Cecilia good  opinion with more study and design.
To satisfy Cecilia not only concerning the brother but the sister, Cecilia again  visited Miss Belfield, and had the pleasure of finding Cecilia in better spirits,  and hearing that the noble friend of Cecilia brother, whom Cecilia had already  mentioned, and whom Cecilia had before suspected to be young Delvile, had now  pointed out to his a method of conduct by which his affairs might be decently  retrieved, and his creditably employed.
Miss Belfield spoke of the plan  with the highest satisfaction; yet Miss Belfield acknowledged that Miss Belfield mother was  extremely discontented with the plan  , and that Miss Belfield brother himself was rather led by  shame than inclination to the plan   adoption.
Yet his was evidently easier in his  mind, though far from happy, and already so much better, that Mr Rupil said Mr Rupil  would very soon be able to leave Mr Rupil room.
Such was the quiet and contented situation of Cecilia, when one evening, which  was destined for company at home, while Cecilia was alone in the drawing-room,  which Mrs Harrel had just left to answer a note, Sir Robert Floyer accidentally  came up stairs before the other gentlemen.
"Ha!"
cried Sir Robert Floyer, the moment Sir Robert Floyer saw Cecilia, "at last have I the good fortune to meet  with you alone!
this, indeed, is a favour I thought I was always to be denied."
Sir Robert Floyer was then approaching Cecilia; but Cecilia, who shrunk involuntarily at the sight  of Sir Robert Floyer, was retreating hastily to quit his room, when suddenly recollecting  that no better opportunity might ever offer for a final explanation with Sir Robert Floyer,  Cecilia irresolutely stopt; and Sir Robert, immediately following, took Cecilia hand,  and pressing her hand to Sir Robert Floyer lips as Cecilia endeavoured to withdraw her hand, exclaimed, "You  are a most charming creature!"
when the door was opened, and young Delvile at  the same moment was announced and appeared.
Cecilia, colouring violently, and extremely chagrined, hastily disengaged  Cecilia from Sir Robert Floyer hold.
young Delvile seemed uncertain whether young Delvile ought not to retire,  which Sir Robert perceiving, bowed to young Delvile with an air of mingled triumph and  vexation, and said, "Sir your most obedient!"
The doubt, however, in which every one appeared of what was next to be done,  was immediately removed by the return of Mrs Harrel, and the arrival at almost  the same moment of more company.
The rest of the evening was spent, on the part of Cecilia, most painfully: the  explanation Cecilia had planned had ended in worse than nothing, for by suffering  the Baronet to detain Cecilia, Cecilia had rather shewn a disposition to oblige, than  any intention to discard the Baronet; and the situation in which Cecilia had been surprised  by young Delvile, was the last to clear the suspicions Cecilia so little wished him  to harbour: while, on him , the accident seemed to occasion no other  alteration than that of rendering him more than usually assiduous to give way  to Sir Robert whenever Sir Robert approached Cecilia.
Nor was Sir Sir Robert slack in taking advantage of this attention: Sir Robert was highly  in spirits, talked to Cecilia with more than common freedom, and wore the whole  evening an air of exulting satisfaction.
Cecilia, provoked by this presumption, hurt by the behaviour of young Delvile,  and mortified by the whole affair, determined to leave this mistake no longer  in the power of accident, but to apply immediately to Mr Delvile senior, and  desire Mr Delvile senior, as Cecilia guardian, to wait upon Sir Robert, and acquaint Sir Robert  that Sir Robert perseverance in pursuing Cecilia was both useless and offensive: and by  this method Cecilia hoped at once to disentangle Cecilia for ever from the Baronet,  and to discover more fully the sentiments of Young Delvile: for the provocation  Cecilia had just endured, robbed Cecilia of all patience for waiting the advice of Mr  Monckton.
