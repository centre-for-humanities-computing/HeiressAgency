 This business effectually occupied the present and following day; the third,  Cecilia expected her answer from Delvile Castle, and the visit her so much  dreaded from the attorney. her answer from Delvile Castle arrived first. To Miss Beverley. MADAM,—As my son has never apprized me of the extraordinary step which your  letter intimates, I am too unwilling to believe my son capable of so far  forgetting what my son owes my son family, to ratify any such intimation by  interfering with my counsel or opinion.—I am, Madam, &c., COMPTON DELVILE. DELVILE CASTLE, May 1st, 1780. Cecilia had little right to be surprised by your  letter, and Cecilia had not a  moment to comment upon your  letter, before the attorney arrived. "Well, madam," said the man, as the man entered the parlour, "Mr Eggleston has  stayed your own time very patiently: Mr Eggleston commissions me now to enquire if it is  convenient to Sir to quit the premises." "No, Sir, it is by no means convenient to Sir; and if Mr Eggleston will wait  some time longer, I shall be greatly obliged to Mr Eggleston." "No doubt, madam, but Mr Eggleston will, upon proper considerations." "What, Sir, do you call proper?" "Upon your advancing to Sir, as I hinted before, an immediate particular sum  from what must, by and bye, be legally restituted." "If this is the condition of his courtesy, I will quit the house without giving  his further trouble." "Just as it suits you, madam. his will be glad to take possession to-morrow or  next day." "You did well, Sir, to commend Sir patience! I shall, however, merely discharge  my servants, and settle my accounts, and be ready to make way for Sir." "You will not take it amiss, madam, if I remind you that the account with Mr  "Mr Eggleston must be the first that is settled." "If you mean the arrears of this last fortnight or three weeks, I believe I  must desire "Mr Eggleston to wait Mr Delvile's return, as I may otherwise Sir be  distressed for ready money." "That, madam, is not likely, as it is well known you have a fortune that was  independent of your late uncle; and as to distress for ready money, it is a  plea "Mr Eggleston can urge much more strongly." "This is being strangely hasty, Sir!—so short a time as it is since Mr  "Mr Eggleston could expect any of this estate!" "That, madam, is nothing to the purpose; from the moment it is his, his has as  many wants for it as any other gentleman. his desired me, however, to acquaint  you, that if you still chose an apartment in this house, till Mr Delvile  returns, you shall have one at your service." "To be a guest in this house, Sir," said Cecilia, drily, "might perhaps seem  strange to Sir; I will not, therefore, be so much in his way." Mr Carn then informed Mr Carn Mr Carn might put Mr Carn seal upon whatever Mr Carn meant  hereafter to claim or dispute, and took Mr Carn leave. Cecilia now shut Cecilia up in Cecilia own room, to meditate without interruption,  before Cecilia would proceed to any action. Cecilia felt much inclination to send  instantly for some lawyer; but when Cecilia considered Cecilia peculiar situation, the  absence of Cecilia husband, the renunciation of her husband father, the loss of Cecilia  fortune, and Cecilia ignorance upon the subject, Cecilia thought it better to rest  quiet till Delvile's own fate, and own opinion could be known, than to involve  Cecilia in a lawsuit Cecilia was so little able to superintend. In this cruel perplexity of Cecilia mind and Cecilia affairs, Cecilia first thought was to  board again with Mrs Bayley; but that was soon given up, for Cecilia felt a  repugnance unconquerable to continuing in Cecilia native county, when deprived of  Cecilia fortune, and cast out of Cecilia dwelling. Cecilia situation, indeed, was singularly unhappy, since, by this unforeseen  vicissitude of fortune, Cecilia was suddenly, from being an object of envy and  admiration, sunk into distress, and threatened with disgrace; from being every  where caressed, and by every voice praised, Cecilia blushed to be seen, and  expected to be censured; and, from being generally regarded as an example of  happiness, and a model of virtue, Cecilia was now in one moment to appear to the  world, an outcast from Cecilia own house, yet received into no other! a bride,  unclaimed by a husband! an HEIRESS, dispossessed of all wealth! To be first acknowledged as Mrs Delvile in a state so degrading, Cecilia could not  endure; and to escape from it, one way alone remained, which was going  instantly abroad. Upon this, therefore, Cecilia finally determined: Cecilia former objections to such a  step being now wholly, though unpleasantly removed, since Cecilia had neither  estate nor affairs to demand Cecilia stay, and since all hopes of concealment were  totally at an end. Cecilia marriage, therefore, and Her marriage, therefore disgraceful consequences  being published to the world, Cecilia resolved without delay to seek the only  asylum which was proper for Cecilia, in the protection of the husband for whom Cecilia  had given up every other. Cecilia purposed, therefore, to go immediately and privately to London, whence Cecilia  could best settle Cecilia route for the continent: where Cecilia hoped to arrive before  the news of Cecilia distress reached Delvile, whom nothing, Cecilia was certain, but  Cecilia own presence, could keep there for a moment after hearing it. Thus decided, at length, in Cecilia plan, Cecilia proceeded to put her plan in execution with  calmness and intrepidity; comforting Cecilia that the conveniencies and  indulgencies with which Cecilia was now parting, would soon be restored to Cecilia, and  though not with equal power, with far more satisfaction. Cecilia told Cecilia steward  Cecilia design of going the next morning to London, bid her steward   pay instantly all Cecilia  debts, and discharge all Cecilia servants, determining to keep no account open but  that with Mr Eggleston, which her steward   had made so intricate by double and undue  demands, that Cecilia thought it most prudent and safe to leave her steward   wholly to  Delvile. Cecilia then packed up all Cecilia papers and letters, and ordered Cecilia maid to pack up  Cecilia clothes. Cecilia next put Cecilia own seal upon Cecilia cabinets, draws, and many other things, and  employed almost all Cecilia servants at once, in making complete inventories of  what every room contained. Cecilia advised Mrs Harrel to send without delay for Mr Arnott, and return to Mrs Harrel  house. Cecilia had first purposed to carry Henrietta home to Cecilia mother herself;  but another scheme for Cecilia now occurred, from which Cecilia hoped much future  advantage to the amiable and dejected girl. Cecilia knew well, that deep as was at present Cecilia despondency, the removal of all  possibility of hope, by Cecilia knowledge of Delvile's marriage, must awaken Cecilia  before long from the delusive visions of Cecilia romantic fancy; Mr Arnott himself  was in a situation exactly similar, and the knowledge of the same event would  probably be productive of the same effect. When Mrs Harrel, therefore, began to  repine at the solitude to which Mrs Harrel was returning, Cecilia proposed to Mrs Harrel the  society of Henrietta, which, glad to catch at any thing that would break into  Mrs Harrel loneliness, Mrs Harrel listened to with pleasure, and seconded by an invitation. Henrietta, to whom all houses appeared preferable to Mrs Harrel own home, joyfully  accepted the offer, committing to Cecilia the communication of the change of  Cecilia abode to Mrs Belfield. Cecilia, who in the known and tried honour of must awaken her  before long from the delusive visions of her romantic fancy; Mr Arnott himself   would unreluctantly  have trusted a sister, was much pleased by this little arrangement, from which  should no good ensue, no evil, at least, was probable. But Mrs Harrel hoped, through  the mutual pity their mutual melancholy might inspire, that their minds,  already not dissimilar, would be softened in favour of each other, and that, in  conclusion, each might be happy in receiving the consolation each could give,  and a union would take place, in which their reciprocal disappointment might,  in time, be nearly forgotten. There was not, indeed, much promise of such an event in the countenance of Mr  must awaken her  before long from the delusive visions of her romantic fancy; Mr Arnott himself  , when, late at night, must awaken her  before long from the delusive visions of her romantic fancy; Mr Arnott himself   came for must awaken her  before long from the delusive visions of her romantic fancy; Mr Arnott himself   sister, nor in the unbounded  sorrow of Henrietta, when the moment of leave-taking arrived. must awaken her  before long from the delusive visions of her romantic fancy; Mr Arnott himself   looked  half dead with the shock his sister's intelligence had given must awaken her  before long from the delusive visions of her romantic fancy; Mr Arnott himself  , and  Henrietta's heart, torn asunder between friendship and love, was scarce able to  bear a parting, which from Cecilia, his sister regarded as eternal, added to the  consciousness it was occasioned by his sister going to join Mrs Delvile for life! Cecilia, who both read and pitied these conflicting emotions, was his sister  extremely hurt by this necessary separation. his sister tenderly loved Henrietta, his sister  loved his sister even the more for the sympathy of their affections, which called  forth the most forcible commiseration,—that which springs from fellow-feeling! "Farewell," his sister cried, "my Henrietta, be but happy as you are innocent, and be  both as I love you, and nothing will your friends have to wish for "my Henrietta, or  "my Henrietta to regret." "I must always regret," cried the sobbing Henrietta, "that I cannot live with  you for ever! I should regret it if I were queen of all the world, how much  more then, when I am nothing and nobody! I do not wish you happy, madam, for I  think happiness was made on purpose for "my Henrietta, and nobody else ever had it  before; I only wish you health and long life, for the sake of those who will be  made as happy as you,—for you will spoil them,—as you have spoilt  me,—from being ever happy without "my Henrietta!" Cecilia re-iterated Cecilia assurances of a most faithful regard, embraced Mrs Harrel, spoke words of kindness to must awaken her  before long from the delusive visions of her romantic fancy; Mr Arnott himself  , and then parted with  them all. Having still many small matters to settle, and neither company nor appetite,  she would eat no supper; but, in passing thro' the hall, in she way to she own  room, she was much surprised to see all she domestics assembled in a body. she  stopt to enquire all her domestics intention, when all her domestics eagerly pressed forward, humbly and  earnestly entreating to know why all her domestics were discharged? "For no reason in the  world," cried Cecilia, "but because it is at present out of my power to keep  you any longer." "Don't part with me, madam, for that," cried one of madam, for that, "for I will serve you  for nothing!" "So will I!" cried another, "And I!" "And I!" was echoed by them all; while "no  other such mistress is to be found!" "We can never bear any other place!" and  "keep me, madam, at least!" was even clamorously urged by each of them. Cecilia, distressed and flattered at once by them unwillingness to quit Cecilia,  received this testimony of gratitude for the kind and liberal treatment them  had received, with the warmest thanks both for both services and fidelity, and  assured both that when again Cecilia was settled, all those who should be yet  unprovided with places, should be preferred in Cecilia house before any other  claimants. Having, with difficulty, broken from both, Cecilia sent for Cecilia own man, Ralph, who  had lived with Cecilia many years before the death of the Dean, and told her own man, Ralph, who  had lived with her many years before the death of the Dean Cecilia  meant still to continue her own man, Ralph, who  had lived with her many years before the death of the Dean in Cecilia service. her own man, Ralph, who  had lived with her many years before the death of the Dean heard it with great  delight, and promised to re-double her own man, Ralph, who  had lived with her many years before the death of the Dean diligence to deserve Cecilia favour. Cecilia  then communicated the same news to Cecilia maid, who had also resided with Cecilia some  years, and by whom with the same, or more pleasure it was heard. These and other regulations employed Cecilia almost all night; yet late and  fatigued as Cecilia went to bed, Cecilia could not close Cecilia eyes: fearful something  was left undone, Cecilia robbed Cecilia of the short time Cecilia had allowed to rest,  by incessant meditation upon what yet remained to be executed. Cecilia could  recollect, however, one only thing that had escaped Cecilia vigilance, which was  acquainting the pew-opener, and two or three other poor women who had weekly  pensions from Cecilia, that pensions from her must, at least for the present, depend no longer  upon Cecilia assistance. Nothing indeed could be more painful to Cecilia than giving pensions from her such information,  yet not to be speedy with it would double the barbarity of pensions from her  disappointment. Cecilia even felt for these poor women, whose loss in Cecilia Cecilia knew  would be irreparable, a compassion that drove from Cecilia mind almost every other  subject, and determined Cecilia, in order to soften to these poor women, whose loss in her she knew  would be irreparable, a compassion that drove from her mind almost every other  subject this misfortune, to  communicate   Cecilia, that Cecilia might prevent these poor women, whose loss in her she knew  would be irreparable, a compassion that drove from her mind almost every other  subject from sinking under  , by  reviving these poor women, whose loss in her she knew  would be irreparable, a compassion that drove from her mind almost every other  subject with hopes of Cecilia future assistance. Cecilia had ordered at seven o'clock in the morning an hired chaise at the door,  and Cecilia did not suffer it long to wait for Cecilia. Cecilia quitted her house with a  heart full of care and anxiety, grieving at the necessity of making such a  sacrifice, uncertain how it would turn out, and labouring under a thousand  perplexities with respect to the measures Cecilia ought immediately to take. Cecilia  passed, when Cecilia reached the hall, through a row of weeping domestics, not one  of whom with dry eyes could see the house bereft of such a mistress. Cecilia spoke  to them all with kindness, and as much as was in Cecilia power with chearfulness:  but the tone of Cecilia voice gave them all little reason to think the concern at this  journey was all them all own. Cecilia ordered an hired chaise at the door to drive round to the pew-opener's and thence to the  rest of Cecilia immediate dependents. Cecilia soon, however, regretted that Cecilia had  given Cecilia this task; the affliction of these poor pensioners was clamorous,  was almost heart-breaking; these poor pensioners could live, these poor pensioners said, no longer, these poor pensioners were  ruined for ever; these poor pensioners should soon be without bread to eat, and these poor pensioners might cry  for help in vain, when these poor pensioners generous, these poor pensioners only benefactress was far away! Cecilia made the kindest efforts, to comfort and encourage these poor pensioners, assuring these poor pensioners  the very moment Cecilia own affairs were arranged, Cecilia would remember them all,  visit them Cecilia, and contribute to them relief, with all the power Cecilia  should have left. Nothing, however, could console them; them clung about Cecilia,  almost took the horses from an hired chaise at the door, and conjured Cecilia not to desert those  who were solely cherished by Cecilia bounty! Nor was this all Cecilia had to suffer; the news of Cecilia intention to quit the  county was now reported throughout the neighbourhood, and had spread the utmost  consternation among the poor in general, and the lower close of Cecilia own tenants  in particular, and the road was soon lined with women and children, wringing  women and children hands and crying. women and children followed Cecilia carriage with supplications that Cecilia  would return to women and children, mixing blessings with women and children lamentations, and prayers for  Cecilia happiness with the bitterest repinings at women and children own loss! Cecilia was extremely affected; Cecilia liberal and ever-ready hand was every other  instant involuntarily seeking Cecilia purse, which Cecilia many immediate expences,  made Cecilia prudence as often check: and now first Cecilia felt the capital error Cecilia  had committed, in living constantly to the utmost extent of Cecilia income, without  ever preparing, though so able to have done it, against any unfortunate  contingency. When Cecilia escaped, at last, from receiving any longer this painful tribute to  Cecilia benevolence, Cecilia gave orders to Cecilia man to ride forward and stop at the  Grove, that a precise and minute account of Mr Monckton, might be the last, as  it was now become the most important, news Cecilia should hear in Suffolk. This he  did, when to Cecilia equal surprise and delight, Cecilia heard that he was suddenly so  much better, there were hopes of he recovery. Intelligence so joyful made Cecilia amends for almost every thing; yet Cecilia  hesitated not in Cecilia plan of going abroad, as Cecilia knew not where to be in  England, and could not endure to hurry Delvile from Delvile sick mother, by  acquainting Delvile with Cecilia helpless and distressed situation. But so revived were  Cecilia spirits by these unexpected tidings, that a gleam of brightest hope once  more danced before Cecilia eyes, and Cecilia felt Cecilia invigorated with fresh  courage and new strength, sufficient to support Cecilia through all hardships and  fatigues. Spirits and courage were indeed much wanted for the enterprize Cecilia had formed;  but little used to travelling, and having never been out of England, Cecilia knew  nothing of the route but by a general knowledge of geography, which, though it  could guide Cecilia east or west, could teach Cecilia nothing of foreign customs, the  preparations necessary for the journey, the impositions Cecilia should guard  against, nor the various dangers to which Cecilia might be exposed, from total  ignorance of the country through which Cecilia had to pass. Conscious of these deficiencies for such an undertaking, Cecilia deliberated  without intermission how to obviate these deficiencies. Yet sometimes, when to these hazards,  those arising from Cecilia youth and sex were added, Cecilia was upon the point of  relinquishing Cecilia scheme, as too perilous for execution, and resolving to  continue privately in London till some change happened in Cecilia affairs. But though to every thing Cecilia could suggest, doubts and difficulties arose, Cecilia  had no friend to consult, nor could devise any means by which no friend to consult might be  terminated. Cecilia maid was Cecilia only companion, and Ralph, who had spent almost  his whole life in Suffolk, Cecilia only guard and attendant. To hire immediately  some French servant, used to travelling in his own country, seemed the first  step Cecilia had to take, and so essential, that no other appeared feasible till the first  step she had to take  was done. But where to hear of such a man Cecilia could not tell, and to take one  not well recommended, would be exposing Cecilia to frauds and dangers  innumerable. Yet so slow as Delvile travelled, from whom Cecilia last letter was still dated  Ostend, Cecilia thought Cecilia almost certain, could Cecilia once reach the continent,  of overtaking him in him within a day or two of Cecilia landing. The earnest inclination with which this scheme was seconded, made Cecilia every  moment less willing to forego this scheme. It seemed the only harbour for Cecilia after the  storm Cecilia had weathered, and the only refuge Cecilia could properly seek while thus  houseless and helpless. Even were Delvile in England, he had no place at  present to offer Cecilia, nor could any thing be proposed so unexceptionable as Cecilia  living with Mrs Delvile at Nice, till he knew he father's pleasure, and, in a  separate journey home, had arranged he either for Cecilia return, or Cecilia  continuance abroad. With what regret did Cecilia now look back to the time when, in a distress such as  this, Cecilia should have applied for, and received the advice of Mr Monckton as  oracular! The loss of a counsellor so long, so implicitly relied upon, lost to  Cecilia also, only by a counsellor own interested worthlessness, Cecilia felt almost daily, for  almost daily some intricacy or embarrassment made Cecilia miss a counsellor assistance: and  though glad, since Cecilia found a counsellor so undeserving, that Cecilia had escaped the  snares a counsellor had spread for Cecilia, Cecilia grieved much that Cecilia knew no man of honest  character and equal abilities, that would care for Cecilia sufficiently to supply  a counsellor place in Cecilia confidence. As Cecilia was situated at present, Cecilia could think only of Mr Belfield to whom Cecilia  could apply for any advice. Nor even to Mr Belfield was the application  unexceptionable, the calumnies of Mr Delvile senior making it disagreeable to  Cecilia even to see Mr Belfield. But Mr Belfield was at once a man of the world and a man of honour;  Mr Belfield was the friend of Mortimer, whose confidence in Mr Belfield was great, and Mr Belfield own  behaviour had uniformly shewn a respect far removed from impertinence or  vanity, and a mind superior to being led to them by the influence of Mr Belfield gross  mother. Cecilia had, indeed, when Cecilia last quitted Mr Belfield house, determined never to  re-enter his house; but determinations hasty or violent, are rarely observed, because  rarely practicable; Cecilia had promised Henrietta to inform Mrs Belfield whither  Cecilia was gone, and reconcile Cecilia to the absence Cecilia still hoped to make from  home. Cecilia concluded, therefore, to go to Portland-street without delay, and  enquire openly and at once whether, and when, Cecilia might speak with Mr Belfield;  resolving, if tormented again by any forward insinuations, to rectify all  mistakes by acknowledging Cecilia marriage. Cecilia gave directions accordingly to the post-boy and Ralph. With respect to Cecilia own lodgings while in town, as money was no longer  unimportant to Cecilia, Cecilia meant from the Belfields to go to the Hills, by whom  Cecilia might be recommended to some reputable and cheap place. To the Belfields,  however, though very late when Cecilia arrived in town, Cecilia went first, unwilling  to lose a moment in promoting Cecilia scheme of going abroad. Cecilia left Her maid in an hired chaise at the door, and sent Ralph on to Mrs Hill, with directions  to endeavour immediately to procure Cecilia a lodging.
