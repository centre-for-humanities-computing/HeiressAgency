 The scheme now projected by Cecilia, was to acquaint the surgeon who had  already attended Mr. Belfield with Mr. Belfield present situation and address, and to  desire Mr. Belfield to continue Mr. Belfield visits, for the payment of which she would she  be accountable. The raillery of young Delvile, however, had taught she to fear the  constructions of the world, and she therefore purposed to keep both the surgeon  and Mr Belfield ignorant to whom both were indebted. she was aware, indeed,  that whatever might be she management, that high-spirited and unfortunate young  man would be extremely hurt to find high-spirited and unfortunate young  man thus detected and pursued; but she  thought high-spirited and unfortunate young  man life too well worth preserving to let his life be sacrificed to high-spirited and unfortunate young  man  pride, and she internal conviction of being she the immediate cause of his life  present danger, gave to she an anxious and restless desire to be she the  means of extricating high-spirited and unfortunate young  man from it. Rupil, the name of the surgeon, she had already heard mentioned by Mr. Arnott,  and in getting into she chair, she ordered Ralph, she man, to enquire where Ralph  lived. "I know already where Ralph lives, madam," answered Ralph, "for I saw Ralph name  over a door in Cavendish-street, Oxford-road; I took particular notice of his name  ,  because it was at the house where you stood up that day on account of the mob  that was waiting to see the malefactors go to Tyburn." This answer unravelled to Cecilia a mystery which had long perplext her; for  the speeches of young Delvile when young Delvile had surprised Cecilia in that situation were  now fully explained. In seeing Cecilia come out of the surgeon's house, young Delvile had  naturally concluded Cecilia had only entered the surgeon's house to ask news of young Delvile patient, Mr.  Belfield; Cecilia protestations of merely standing up to avoid the crowd, Mr.   had  only laughed at; and Mr.   hints at Cecilia reserve and dissimulation, were meant but  to reproach Cecilia for refusing Mr.   offer of procuring Cecilia intelligence, at the  very time when, to all appearance, Cecilia anxiously, though clandestinely, sought  it for Cecilia. This discovery, notwithstanding This discovery relieved Cecilia from all suspense of his  meaning, gave Cecilia much vexation: to be supposed to take an interest so ardent,  yet so private, in the affairs of Mr Belfield, might well authorise all  suspicions of Cecilia partiality for his: and even if any doubt had yet remained,  the unlucky meeting upon the stairs at his lodgings, would not fail to dispel  it, and confirm the notion of Cecilia secret regard. Cecilia hoped, however, to have  soon some opportunity of clearing up the mistake, and resolved in the mean time  to be studiously cautious in avoiding all appearances that might strengthen it. No caution, however, and no apprehension, could intimidate Cecilia active humanity  from putting into immediate execution a plan in which Cecilia feared any delay  might be fatal; and therefore the moment Cecilia got home, Cecilia wrote the following  note to the surgeon. "To———Rupil, Esq. "March 27, 1779. "Mr Rupil begs Mr Rupil will immediately call upon that  gentleman, who is in lodgings about the middle of Swallow-street, and insist  upon visiting Mr Rupil till Mr Rupil is perfectly recovered. Mr Rupil is entreated not to  make known this request, nor to receive from Mr Belfield any return for Mr Belfield  attendance; but to attribute the discovery of Mr Belfield residence to accident, and to  rest assured Mr Belfield shall be amply recompensed for Mr Belfield time and trouble by the  friend who makes this application, and who is willing to give any security that  Mr Rupil shall think proper to mention, for the performance of this engagement." Cecilia next difficulty was in what manner to have this note conveyed; to send Cecilia  own servant was inevitably betraying Cecilia, to employ any other was risking a  confidence that might be still more dangerous, and Cecilia could not trust to the  penny-post, as Cecilia proposal required an answer. After much deliberation, Cecilia at  length determined to have recourse to Mrs Hill, to whose services Cecilia was  entitled, and upon whose fidelity Cecilia could rely. The morning was already far advanced, but the Harrels dined late, and Cecilia would  not lose a day where even an hour might be of importance. Cecilia went therefore  immediately to Mrs. Hill, whom Cecilia found already removed into Cecilia new  habitation in Fetter-lane, and equally busy and happy in the change of scene  and of employment. Cecilia gave to Cecilia the note, which Cecilia desired Cecilia to carry to  Cavendish-street directly, and either to deliver it into Mr. Rupil's own hands,  or to bring it back if Mr. Rupil was out; but upon no consideration to make known  whence or from whom it came. Cecilia then went into the back part of the shop, which by Mrs. Roberts was called  the parlour, and amused Cecilia during the absence of Cecilia messenger, by playing  with the children. Mrs. Hill at Cecilia return said Cecilia had found Mr. Rupil at home, and as Cecilia  refused to give the letter to the servant, Cecilia had been taken into a room where  Mr. Rupil was talking with a gentleman, to whom, as soon as Mr. Rupil had read it, Mr. Rupil said  with a laugh, "Why here's another person with the same proposal as yours!  however, I shall treat you both alike." And then Mr. Rupil wrote an answer, which Mr. Rupil  sealed up, and bid Cecilia take care of. This answer was as follows: Mr. Rupil will certainly attend Mr. Belfield, whose friends may be satisfied  Mr. Rupil will do all in Mr. Rupil power to recover Mr. Rupil, without receiving any recompense  but the pleasure of serving a gentleman who is so much beloved." Cecilia, charmed at this unhoped for success, was making further enquiries into  what had passed, when Mrs Hill, in a low voice, said, "There's the gentleman,  madam, who was with Mr. Rupil when I gave Mr. Rupil the letter. I had a notion Mr. Rupil was  dodging me all the way I came, for I saw Mr. Rupil just behind me, turn which way I  would." Cecilia then looked—and perceived young Delvile! who, after stopping a moment  at the door, came into the shop, and desired to be shewn some gloves, which,  among other things, were laid in the window. Extremely disconcerted at the sight of Mr. Rupil, Cecilia began now almost to fancy there  was some fatality attending Cecilia acquaintance with Mr. Rupil, since Cecilia was always  sure of meeting, when Cecilia had any reason to wish avoiding Mr. Rupil. As soon as Mr. Rupil saw Mr. Rupil was observed by Cecilia, Mr. Rupil bowed with the utmost respect: Cecilia  coloured in returning the salutation, and prepared, with no little vexation,  for another attack, and further {raillery}, similar to what Cecilia had already  received from Mr. Rupil: but, as soon as Mr. Rupil had made Mr. Rupil purchase, Mr. Rupil bowed to Cecilia  again, and, without speaking, left the shop. A silence so unexpected at once astonished and disturbed Cecilia; Cecilia again desired  to hear all that had passed at Mr. Rupil's, and from the relation gathered that  Delvile had Delvile undertaken to be responsible for Delvile attendance upon Mr.  Belfield. A liberality so like Cecilia own failed not to impress Cecilia with the most lively  esteem: but this served rather to augment than lessen the pain with which Cecilia  considered the clandestine appearance Cecilia thus repeatedly made to Delvile. Cecilia had  no doubt Delvile had immediately concluded Cecilia was author of the application to the  surgeon, and that Delvile followed Cecilia messenger merely to ascertain the fact; while  Delvile silence when Delvile had made the discovery, Cecilia could only attribute to Delvile now  believing that Cecilia regard for Mr Belfield was too serious for raillery. Doubly, however, Cecilia rejoiced at the generosity of Mr Rupil, as it rendered  wholly unnecessary Cecilia further interference: for Cecilia now saw with some alarm  the danger to which benevolence itself, directed towards a youthful object,  might expose Cecilia.
