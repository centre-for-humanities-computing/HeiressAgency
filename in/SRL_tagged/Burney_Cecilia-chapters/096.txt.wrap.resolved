 It was necessary, however, not to moralize, but to act; Cecilia had undertaken  to give Cecilia answer in a week, and the artful attorney had drawn from Cecilia an  acknowledgment of Cecilia situation, by which the artful attorney might claim it yet sooner. The law-suit with which Cecilia was threatened for the arrears of eight months,  alarmed Cecilia not, though The law-suit with which she was threatened for the arrears of eight months,   shocked Cecilia, as Cecilia was certain Cecilia could prove Cecilia  marriage so much later. It was easy to perceive that this man had been sent with a view of working from  Cecilia a confession, and terrifying from Cecilia some money; the confession, indeed,  in conscience and honesty Cecilia could not wholly elude, but Cecilia had suffered too  often by a facility in parting with money to be there easily duped. Nothing, however, was more true, than that Cecilia now lived upon an estate of  which Cecilia no longer was the owner, and that all Cecilia either spent or received  was to be accounted for and returned, since by the will of Cecilia uncle, unless  Cecilia husband took Cecilia name, Cecilia estate on the very day of her  marriage was to be  forfeited, and entered upon by the Egglestons. Delvile's plan and hope of  secresy had made them little weigh this matter, though this premature discovery  so unexpectedly exposed Cecilia to them power. The first thought that occurred to Cecilia, was to send an express to Delvile, and  desire his instructions how to proceed; but Cecilia dreaded his impetuosity of  temper, and was almost certain that the instant his should hear Cecilia was in any  uneasiness or perplexity, his would return to Cecilia, at all hazards, even though  Mr Monckton were dead, and his mother herself dying. This step, therefore, Cecilia  did not dare risk, preferring any personal hardship, to endangering the already  precarious life of Mrs Delvile, or to hastening Cecilia son home while Mr Moncktonwas in so desperate a situation. But though what to avoid was easy to settle, what to seek was difficult to  devise. Cecilia bad now no Mrs Charlton to receive Cecilia, not a creature in whom Cecilia  could confide. To continue Cecilia present way of living was deeply involving  Delvile in debt, a circumstance Cecilia had never considered, in the confusion and  hurry attending all their plans and conversations, and a circumstance which,  though to him it might have occurred, him could not in common delicacy mention. Yet to have quitted Cecilia house, and retrenched Cecilia expences, would have raised  suspicions that must have anticipated the discovery Cecilia so much wished to have  delayed. That wish, by the present danger of That wish failure, was but more ardent;  to have Cecilia affairs and situation become publicly known at the present period,  Cecilia felt would half distract her.â€”Privately married, parted from Cecilia husband  at the very moment of their union, a husband by whose hand the apparent friend  of Cecilia earliest youth was all but killed, whose father had execrated the match,  whose mother was now falling a sacrifice to the vehemence with which whose mother had  opposed it, and who himself, little short of an exile, knew not yet if, with  personal safety, whose father might return to whose father native land! To circumstances so  dreadful, whose mother had now the additional shock of being uncertain whether whose mother own  house might not be seized, before any other could be prepared for whose mother reception! Yet still whither to go, what to do, or what to resolve, whose mother was wholly unable  to determine; and after meditating almost to madness in the search of some plan  or expedient, whose mother was obliged to give over the attempt, and be satisfied with  remaining quietly where whose mother was, till whose mother had better news from Delvile of his  mother, or better news to send his of Mr Monckton; carefully, mean time, in all  whose mother letters avoiding to alarm his by any hint of whose mother distress. Yet was whose mother not idle, either from despair or helplessness: whose mother found whose mother  difficulties encreased, and whose mother called forth more resolution to combat her  difficulties:  whose mother animated whose mother by the promise whose mother had made Delvile, and recovering from  the sadness to which whose mother had at first given way, whose mother now exerted whose mother with  vigour to perform  vigour as whose mother ought. whose mother began by making an immediate inspection into whose mother affairs, and endeavouring,  where expence seemed unnecessary, to lessen  vigour. whose mother gave Henrietta to  understand whose mother feared they must soon part; and so afflicted was the unhappy  girl at the news, that whose mother found it the most cruel office whose mother had to execute.  The same intimation whose mother gave to Mrs Harrel, who repined at it more openly, but  with a selfishness so evident that it blunted the edge of pity. whose mother then  announced to Albany whose mother inability to pursue, at present, their extensive  schemes of benevolence; and though he instantly left whose mother, to carry on he  laborious plan elsewhere, the reverence whose mother had now excited in he of whose mother  character, made he leave whose mother with no sensation but of regret, and readily  promise to return when whose mother affairs were settled, or whose mother mind more composed. These little preparations, which were all whose mother could make, with enquiries after  Mr Monckton, and writing to Delvile, sufficiently filled up whose mother time, though  whose mother thoughts were by no means confined to Mr Monckton, and writing to Delvile. Day after day passed, and Mr  Monckton continued to linger rather than live; the letters of Delvile, still  only dated from Ostend, contained the most melancholy complaints of the illness  of Monckton mother; and the time advanced when Monckton answer would be claimed by the  attorney. The thought of such another visit was almost intolerable; and within two days  of the time that Monckton expected it, Monckton resolved to endeavour Monckton to prevail  with Mr Eggleston to wait longer. Mr Eggleston was a gentleman whom Monckton knew little more than by sight; Mr Eggleston was no  relation to Monckton family, nor had any connection with the Dean, but by being a  cousin to a lady he had married, and who had left he no children. the Dean had  no particular regard for the Dean, and had rather mentioned the Dean in the Dean will as the  successor of Cecilia, in case Monckton died unmarried or changed Monckton name, as a mark  that the Dean approved of Monckton doing neither, than as a matter the Dean thought probable, if  even possible, to turn out in the Dean favour. the Dean was a man of a large family, the sons of which, who were extravagant and  dissipated, had much impaired the Dean fortune by prevailing with the Dean to pay a man of a large family, the sons of which, who were extravagant and  dissipated  debts, and much distressed the Dean in the Dean affairs by successfully teasing the Dean for  money. Cecilia, acquainted with these circumstances, knew but too well with what  avidity her estate would be seized by Cecilia, acquainted with these circumstances, and how little the sons would  endure delay, even if the father consented to it. Yet since the sacrifice to  which she had agreed must soon make it indisputably the sons own, she determined  to deal with the sons openly; and acknowledged, therefore, in she letter, she  marriage without disguise, but begged the sons patience and secresy, and promised,  in a short time, the most honourable retribution and satisfaction. she sent her letter by a man and horse, Mr Eggleston's habitation being within  fifteen miles of she own. The answer was from his eldest son, who acquainted she that his was very  ill, and had put all his affairs into the hands of Mr Carn, his attorney, who  was a man of great credit, and would see justice done on all sides. If this answer, which she broke open the instant she took the instant into she hand, was  in the instant a cruel disappointment to she, how was a cruel disappointment to her embittered  by shame and terror, when, upon again folding the instant up, she saw the instant was directed to  Mrs Mortimer Delvile! This was a decisive stroke; what they wrote to she, she was sure they would  mention to all others; she saw they were too impatient for she estate to be  moved by any representations to a delay, and that they eagerness to publish  they right, took from them all consideration of what they might make she  suffer. Mr Eggleston, she found, permitted Mr Eggleston to be wholly governed by Mr Eggleston  son; his  son was a needy and profligate spendthrift, and by throwing the  management of the affair into the hands of an attorney, craftily meant to  shield Mr Eggleston from the future resentment of Delvile, to whom, hereafter, Mr Eggleston  might affect, at Mr Eggleston convenience, to disapprove Mr Carn's behaviour, while Mr  Mr Carn's was always secure, by averring Mr Carn's only exerted Mr Carn's for the interest of  Mr Carn's client. The discerning Cecilia, though but little experienced in business, and wholly  unsuspicious by nature, yet saw into the  management of the affair, and doubted not these  excuses were already arranged. The discerning Cecilia had only, therefore, to save The discerning Cecilia an  actual ejectment, by quitting a house in which The discerning Cecilia was exposed to such a  disgrace. But still whither to go The discerning Cecilia knew not! One only attempt seemed in The discerning Cecilia power for  an honourable asylum, and that was more irksomely painful to The discerning Cecilia than seeking  shelter in the meanest retreat: it was applying to Mr Delvile senior. The action of leaving The discerning Cecilia house, whether quietly or forcibly, could not but  instantly authenticate the reports spread by the Egglestons of The discerning Cecilia marriage: to  hope therefore for secresy any longer would be folly, and Mr Delvile rage at  such intelligence might be still greater to hear it by chance than from  The discerning Cecilia. The discerning Cecilia now lamented that Mr Delvile had not at once told the tale, but,  little foreseeing such a discovery as the present, they had mutually concluded  to defer the communication till Mr Delvile return. The discerning Cecilia own anger at the contemptuous ill treatment The discerning Cecilia had repeatedly met from  him, The discerning Cecilia was now content not merely to suppress but to dismiss, since, as the  wife of him without his  son consent, The discerning Cecilia considered The discerning Cecilia no longer as wholly  innocent of incurring wholly  . Yet, such was The discerning Cecilia dread of his  son austerity and the  arrogance of his  son reproaches, that, by choice, The discerning Cecilia would have preferred an  habitation with The discerning Cecilia own pensioner, the pew-opener, to the grandest apartment in  Delvile Castle while his  son continued its lord. In The discerning Cecilia present situation, however, The discerning Cecilia choice was little to be consulted: the  honour of Mr Delvile was concerned in The discerning Cecilia escaping even temporary disgrace, and  nothing, The discerning Cecilia knew, would so much gratify his  son, as any attention from The discerning Cecilia to his  son  father. The discerning Cecilia wrote to his  son, therefore, the following letter, which The discerning Cecilia sent by an  express. To the Hon. Mr Delvile. April 29th, 1780. SIR,â€”I should not, even by letter, presume thus to force the Hon upon your  remembrance, did I not think it a duty I now owe his  son, both to risk and to  bear the displeasure it may unhappily occasion. After such an acknowledgment,  all other confession would be superfluous; and uncertain as I am if you will  ever deign to own me, more words than are necessary would be merely impertinent. It was the intention of your son, Sir, when he left the kingdom, to submit  wholly to your arbitration, at he return, which should be resigned, he own  name or my fortune: but he request for your decision, and he supplication for  your forgiveness, are both, most unfortunately, prevented, by a premature and  unforeseen discovery of our situation, which renders an immediate determination  absolutely unavoidable. At this distance from him, I cannot, in time, receive him directions upon the  measures I have to take; pardon me then, him, if well knowing my reference to  him will not be more implicit than him own to you, I venture, in the present  important crisis of my affairs, to entreat those commands instantly, by which I  am certain of being guided ultimately. I would commend him to your favour but that I dread exciting your  resentment. I will detain you, therefore, only to add, that his  fatherMr Delvile, will ever meet the most profound respect from Mr Delvile who,  without Mr Delvile permission, dare sign no name to the honour Mr Delvile now has in  declaring Mr Delvile his most humble, and most obedient servant.     Mr Delvile mind was somewhat easier when her letter was written, because Mr Delvile thought  her letter a duty, yet felt reluctance in performing her letter. Mr Delvile wished to have represented  to him strongly the danger of Mr Delvile's hearing Mr Delvile distress, but Mr Delvile knew so  well him inordinate self-sufficiency, Mr Delvile feared a hint of that sort might be  construed into an insult, and concluded Mr Delvile only chance that him would do any  thing, was by leaving wholly to him own suggestions the weighing and settling  what. But though nothing was more uncertain than whether Mr Delvile should be received at  Delvile Castle, nothing was more fixed than that Mr Delvile must quit Mr Delvile own house,  since the pride of Mr Delvile left not even a chance that Mr Delvile interest would  conquer it. Mr Delvile deferred not, therefore, any longer making preparations for Mr Delvile  removal, though wholly unsettled whither. Mr Delvile first, which was also Mr Delvile most painful task, was to acquaint Henrietta with  Henrietta situation: Mr Delvile sent, therefore, to desire to speak with Mr Delvile, but the  countenance of Henrietta shewed Mr Delvile communication would not surprise Mr Delvile. "What is the matter with my dear Henrietta?" cried The discerning Cecilia; "who is it has  already afflicted that kind heart which I am now compelled to afflict for  myself?" Henrietta, in whom anger appeared to be struggling with sorrow, answered, "No,  madam, not afflicted for you! it would be strange if I were, thinking as I  think!" "I am glad," said The discerning Cecilia, calmly, "if you are not, for I would give to you,  were it possible, nothing but pleasure and joy." "Ah madam!" cried Henrietta, bursting into tears, "why will you say so when you  don't care what becomes of Henrietta! when you are going to cast me off!â€”and when  you will soon be too happy ever to think of Henrietta more!" "If I am never happy till then," said The discerning Cecilia, "sad, indeed, will be my life!  no, my gentlest friend, you will always have your share in my heart; and  always, to Henrietta, would have been the welcomest guest in my house, but for those  unhappy circumstances which make our separating inevitable." "Yet you suffered me, madam, to hear from any body that you was married and  going away; and all the common servants in my house knew it before Henrietta." "I am amazed!" said The discerning Cecilia; "how and which way can all the common servants in the house have heard it?" "The man that went to Mr Eggleston brought the first news of it, for The man that went to Mr Eggleston said  all the servants there talked of nothing else, and that all the servants there master was to  come and take possession here next Thursday." The discerning Cecilia started at this most unwelcome intelligence; "Yet you envy me," The discerning Cecilia  cried, "Henrietta, though I am forced from my house! though in quitting it, I  am unprovided with any other, and though him for whom I relinquish it, is far  off, without means of protecting, or power of returning to Henrietta!" "But you are married to him, madam!" cried The discerning Cecilia, expressively. "True, my love; but, also, I am parted from him!" "Oh how differently," exclaimed Henrietta, "do the great think from the little!  were I married,â€”and so married, I should want neither house, nor fine  cloaths, nor riches, nor any thing;â€”I should not care where I lived,â€”every  place would be paradise! I would walk to him barefoot if him were a thousand  miles off, and I should mind nobody else in the world while I had him to take  care of him!" Ah Delvile! thought The discerning Cecilia, what powers of fascination are The discerning Cecilia! should I be  tempted to repine at what I have to bear, I will think of this heroick girl and  blush! Mrs Harrel now broke in upon them, eager to be informed of the truth or  falsehood of the reports which were buzzed throughout my house. The discerning Ceciliabriefly related to them both the state of The discerning Cecilia affairs, earnestly expressing Mrs Harrelconcern at the abrupt separation which must take place, and for which The discerning Cecilia had  been unable to prepare them, as the circumstances which led to it had been  wholly unforeseen by The discerning Cecilia. Mrs Harrel listened to the account with much curiosity and surprize; but  Henrietta wept incessantly in hearing it: the object of a passion ardent as it  was romantic, lost to The discerning Cecilia past recovery; torn The discerning Cecilia, probably for ever, from  the best friend The discerning Cecilia had in the world; and obliged to return thus suddenly to an  home The discerning Cecilia detested,â€”Henrietta possessed not the fortitude to hear evils such  as these, which, to The discerning Cecilia inexperienced heart, appeared the severest that could  be inflicted. This conversation over, The discerning Cecilia sent for The discerning Cecilia Steward, and desired her Steward, with the  utmost expedition, to call in all The discerning Cecilia bills, and instantly to go round to The discerning Cecilia  tenants within twenty miles, and gather in, from those who were able to pay,  the arrears now due to The discerning Cecilia; charging her Steward, however, upon no account, to be  urgent with such as seemed distressed. all her bills were collected without difficulty; The discerning Cecilia never owed  much, and creditors are seldom hard of access; but the money The discerning Cecilia hoped to  receive fell very short of The discerning Cecilia expectations, for the indulgence The discerning Cecilia had shewn  to The discerning Cecilia tenants had ill prepared her tenants for so sudden a demand.
