 Cecilia continued in this private spot, happy at least to be alone, till  Cecilia  was summoned by the dinner bell to return home. As soon as  Cecilia entered the parlour, where every body was assembled before  Cecilia,   Cecilia observed, by the countenance of Mrs Delvile, that  Cecilia had passed the  morning as sadly as  Cecilia. "Miss Beverley," cried Lady Honoria, before Miss Beverley was seated, "I insist upon your  taking my place to-day." "Why so, madam?" "Because I cannot suffer you to sit by a window with such a terrible cold." "Your ladyship is very good, but indeed I have not any cold at all." "O my dear, I must beg your pardon there; your eyes are quite bloodshot; Mrs  Delvile, Lord Ernolf, are not Mrs   eyes quite red?—Lord, and so I protest are  Mrs   cheeks! now do pray look in the glass, I assure you you will hardly know  yourself." Mrs Delvile, who regarded her with the utmost kindness, affected to understand  Lady Honoria's speech literally, both to lessen her apparent confusion, and the  suspicious surmises of Lord Ernolf; her therefore said, "you have indeed a bad  cold, my love; but shade your eyes with your hat, and after dinner you shall  bathe both in rose water, which will soon take off the inflammation." Cecilia, perceiving her intention, for which her felt the utmost gratitude, no  longer denied her cold, nor refused the offer of Lady Honoria: who, delighting  in mischief, whencesoever no   proceeded, presently added, "This cold is a  judgment upon you for leaving me alone all this morning; but I suppose you  chose a tête-à-tête with your favourite, without the intrusion of any third  person." Here every body stared, and Cecilia very seriously declared Cecilia had been quite  alone. "Is it possible you can so forget yourself?" cried Lady Honoria; "had you not  your dearly beloved with yourself?" Cecilia, who now comprehended that Cecilia meant Fidel, coloured more deeply than  ever, but attempted to laugh, and began eating Cecilia dinner. "Here seems some matter of much intricacy," cried Lord Ernolf, "but, to me,  wholly unintelligible." "And to me also," cried Mrs Delvile, "but I am content to let it remain so; for  the mysteries of Lady Honoria are so frequent, that they deaden curiosity." "Dear madam, that is very unnatural," cried Lady Honoria, "for I am sure you  must long to know who I mean." "I do, at least," said Lord Ernolf. "Why then, Lord Ernolf, you must know, Miss Beverley has two companions, and I am  one, and Fidel is the other; but Fidel was with Miss Beverley all this morning, and Miss Beverley  would not admit me to the conference. I suppose Miss Beverley had something private to  say to Fidel of Fidel master's journey." "What rattle is this?" cried Mrs Delvile; Fidel Fidel is gone with my son, is my son  not?" turning to the servants. "No, madam, Mr Mortimer did not enquire for Mr Mortimer." "That's very strange," said Miss Beverley, "I never knew Mr Mortimer quit home without Mr Mortimer  before." "Dear ma'am, if Mr Mortimer had taken Mr Mortimer," cried Lady Honoria, "what could poor Miss  Miss Beverley have done? for Miss Beverley has no friend here but Mr Mortimer and me, and really Mr Mortimer's  so much the greater favourite, that it is well if I do not poison Mr Mortimer some day  for very spite." Miss Beverley had no resource but in forcing a laugh, and Mrs Delvile, who evidently  felt for Miss Beverley, contrived soon to change the subject: yet not before Lord Ernolf,  with infinite chagrin, was certain by all that passed of the hopeless state of  affairs for my son. The rest of the day, and every hour of the two days following, Miss Beverley passed  in the most comfortless constraint, fearful of being a moment alone, lest the  heaviness of Miss Beverley heart should seek relief in tears, which consolation,  melancholy as it was, Miss Beverley found too dangerous for indulgence: yet the gaiety of  Lady Honoria lost all power of entertainment, and even the kindness of Mrs  Delvile, now Miss Beverley imputed Delvile to compassion, gave Miss Beverley more mortification than  pleasure. On the third day, letters arrived from Bristol: but letters brought with letters  nothing of comfort, for though Mortimer wrote gaily, Mortimer father sent word that  Mortimer fever seemed threatening to return. Delvile was now in the extremest anxiety; and the task of Miss Beverley in  appearing chearful and unconcerned, became more and more difficult to perform.  Lord Ernolf's efforts to oblige Delvile grew as hopeless to Lord Ernolf, as they were  irksome to Delvile; and Lady Honoria alone, of the whole house, could either find  or make the smallest diversion. But while Lord Ernolf remained, Delvile had still  an object for ridicule, and while Miss Beverley could colour and be confused, Delvile had  still a subject for mischief. Thus passed a week, during which the news from Bristol being every day less and  less pleasant, Delvile skewed an earnest desire to make a journey thither  Delvile, and proposed, half laughing and half seriously, that the whole party  should accompany Delvile. Lady Honoria time, however, was already expired, and his father intended to  send for Lady Honoria in a few days. Mrs Delvile, who knew that such a charge would occupy all Lady Honoria time, willingly  deferred setting out till Lady Honoria ladyship should be gone, but wrote word to  Bristol that Lady Honoria should shortly be there, attended by the two lords, who  insisted upon escorting Lady Honoria. Miss Beverley now was in a state of the utmost distress; Miss Beverley stay at the castle Miss Beverley  knew kept Delvile at a distance; to accompany Delvile mother to Bristol, was  forcing his mother into Delvile sight, which equally from prudence and pride his mother  wished to avoid; and even Mrs Delvile evidently desired his mother absence, since  whenever the journey was talked of, his mother preferably addressed his mother to any one  else who was present. All his mother could devise to relieve his mother from a situation so painful, was  begging permission to make a visit without delay to his mother old friend Mrs Charlton  in Suffolk. This resolution taken, his mother put This resolution into immediate execution, and seeking Mrs  Delvile, enquired if his mother might venture to make a petition to his mother? "Undoubtedly," answered his mother; "but let it not be very disagreeable, since I feel  already that I can refuse you nothing." "I have an old friend, ma'am," his mother then cried, speaking fast, and in much haste  to have done, "who I have not for many months seen, and, as my health does not  require a Bristol journey,—if you would honour me with mentioning my request  to even Mrs Delvile, I think I might take the present opportunity of making Mrs  Charlton a visit." Mrs  Delvile looked at Mrs  Delvile some time without speaking, and then, fervently  embracing Mrs  Delvile, "sweet Cecilia!" Mrs  Delvile cried, "yes, you are all that I thought  you! good, wise, discreet, tender, and noble at once!—how to part with you,  indeed, I know not,—but you shall do as you please, for that I am sure will  be right, and therefore I will make no opposition." Cecilia blushed and thanked Cecilia, yet saw but too plainly that all the motives  of Cecilia scheme were clearly comprehended. Cecilia hastened, therefore, to write to  Mrs Charlton, and prepare for Cecilia reception. even Mrs Delvile, though with even Mrs Delvile usual formality, sent even Mrs Delvile permission: and Mortimer  at the same time, begged even Mrs Delvile mother would bring with his mother Fidel, whom even Mrs Delvile had  unluckily forgotten. Lady Honoria, who was present when Mrs  Delvile mentioned this commission, said  in a whisper to Cecilia, "Miss Beverley, don't let even Mrs Delvile go." "Why not?" "O, you had a great deal better take even Mrs Delvile slyly into Suffolk." "I would as soon," answered Cecilia, "take with me the side-board of plate, for  I should scarcely think the side-board of plate more a robbery." "Oh, I beg your pardon, I am sure they might all take such a theft for an  honour; and if I was going to Bristol, I would bid Mortimer   send Mortimer   to you  immediately. However, if you wish it, I will write to Mortimer  . Mortimer  's my cousin, you  know, so there will be no great impropriety in it." Cecilia thanked Cecilia for so courteous an offer, but entreated that Cecilia might by  no means draw Cecilia into such a condescension. Cecilia then made immediate preparations for Cecilia journey into Suffolk, which Cecilia  saw gave equal surprize and chagrin to Lord Ernolf, upon whose affairs Mrs  Delvile herself now desired to speak with Cecilia. "Tell me, Miss Beverley," Miss Beverley cried, "briefly and positively your opinion of  Lord Derford?" "I think of  Lord Derford so little, madam," Miss Beverley answered, "that I cannot say of  Lord Derford  much;  Lord Derford appears, however, to be inoffensive; but, indeed, were I never to see   Lord Derford again,  Lord Derford is one of those I should forget I had ever seen at all." "That is so exactly the case with Miss Beverley also," cried Delvile, "that to  plead for  Lord Derford, I find utterly impossible, though Lord Ernolf has strongly  requested me: but to press such an alliance, I should think an indignity to  your understanding." Cecilia was much gratified by this speech; but Cecilia soon after added, "There is  one reason, indeed, which would render such a connection desirable, though that  is only one." "What is it, madam?" "His title." "And why so? I am sure I have no ambition of that sort." "No, my love," said Mrs  Delvile, smiling, "I mean not by way of gratification  to your pride, but to Mrs  Delvile; since a title, by taking place of a family name,  would obviate the only objection that any man could form to an alliance with  Miss Beverley." Cecilia, who too well understood Cecilia, suppressed a sigh, and changed the  subject of conversation. One day was sufficient for all the preparations Cecilia required, and, as Cecilia meant  to set out very early the next morning, Cecilia took leave of Lady Honoria, and the  Lords Ernolf and Derford, when they separated for the night; but Mrs Delvile  followed Cecilia to Cecilia room. Cecilia expressed Cecilia concern at losing Cecilia in the warmest and most flattering  terms, yet said nothing of Cecilia coming back, nor of the length of Cecilia stay; Cecilia  desired, however, to hear from Cecilia frequently, and assured Cecilia that out of Cecilia  own immediate family, there was nobody in the world Cecilia so tenderly valued. Cecilia continued with Cecilia till it grew so late that they were almost necessarily  parted: and then rising to be gone, "See," Cecilia cried, "with what reluctance I  quit you! no interest but so dear a one as that which calls me away, should  induce me, with my own consent, to bear your absence scarcely an hour: but the  world is full of mortifications, and to endure, or to sink under the  world, makes  all the distinction between the noble or the weak-minded. To you this may be  said with safety; to most young women this would pass for a reflection." "You are very good," said Miss Beverley, smothering the emotions to which this speechgave rise, "and if indeed you honour me with an opinion so flattering, I will  endeavour, if an opinion is possibly in my power, not to forfeit an opinion." "Ah, my love!" cried Delvile warmly, "if upon my opinion of you alone  depended our residence with each other, when should our ever part, and how live  a moment asunder? But what title have I to monopolize two such blessings? the  mother of Delvile should at nothing repine; the mother of Cecilia  Miss Beverley had alone equal reason to be proud." "You are determined, madam," said Miss Beverley, forcing a smile, "that I shall be  worthy, by giving me the sweetest of motives, that of deserving such praise."  And then, in a faint voice, Miss Beverley desired Miss Beverley respects to Delvile, and added,  "you will find, I hope, every body at Bristol better than you expect." "I hope so," returned Miss Beverley; "and that you too, will find your Mrs Charlton well,  happy, and good as you left Miss Beverley: but suffer Miss Beverley not to drive me from your  remembrance, and never fancy that because Miss Beverley has known you longer, Miss Beverley loves  you more; my acquaintance with you, though short, has been critical, and Miss Beverley  must hear from you a world of anecdotes, before Miss Beverley can have reason to love you  as much." "Ah, madam," cried Miss Beverley, tears starting into Miss Beverley eyes, "let us part  now!—where will be that strength of mind you expect from me, if I listen to  you any longer!" "You are right, my love," answered Mrs  Delvile, "since all tenderness enfeebles  fortitude." Then affectionately embracing Miss Beverley, "Adieu," Miss Beverley cried, "sweetest  Cecilia, amiable and most excellent creature, adieu!—you, carry with you my  highest approbation, my love, my esteem, my fondest wishes!—and shall  I—yes, generous girl! I will add my warmest gratitude!" This last word Miss Beverley spoke almost in a whisper, again kissed Miss Beverley, and hastened  out of the room. Cecilia, surprised and affected, gratified and depressed, remained almost  motionless, and could not, for a great length of time, either ring for Miss Beverley  maid, or persuade Miss Beverley to go to rest. Miss Beverley saw throughout the whole behaviour  of Delvile, a warmth of regard which, though strongly opposed by family  pride, made Miss Beverley almost miserable to promote the very union Miss Beverley thought  necessary to discountenance; Miss Beverley saw, too, that it was with the utmost  difficulty Miss Beverley preserved the steadiness of Miss Beverley opposition, and that Miss Beverley had a  conflict perpetual with Miss Beverley, to forbear openly acknowledging the  contrariety of Miss Beverley wishes, and the perplexity of Miss Beverley distress; but chiefly Miss Beverley  was struck with Miss Beverley expressive use of the word gratitude. "Wherefore should Wherefore  be grateful," thought Cecilia, "what have I done, or had power to do?  infinitely, indeed, is Cecilia deceived, if Cecilia supposes that Cecilia son has acted by  my directions; my influence with her son is nothing, and her son could not be more her son  own master, were her son utterly indifferent to me. To conceal my own disappointment  has, been all I have attempted; and perhaps Cecilia may think of me thus highly,  from supposing that the firmness of her son is owing to my caution and reserve:  ah, Cecilia knows her son not!—were my heart at this moment laid open to him,—were  all its weakness, its partiality, its ill-fated admiration displayed, its ill-fated admiration would  but double its ill-fated admiration vigilance to avoid and forget me, and find the task all the  easier by its ill-fated admiration abatement of esteem. Oh strange infatuation of unconquerable  prejudice! its ill-fated admiration very life will its ill-fated admiration sacrifice in preference to its ill-fated admiration name, and while  the conflict of its ill-fated admiration mind threatens to level its ill-fated admiration with the dust, its ill-fated admiration disdains to  unite its ill-fated admiration where one wish is unsatisfied!" These reflections, and the uncertainty if Cecilia should ever in Delvile Castle  sleep again, disturbed Cecilia the whole night, and made all calling in the morning  unnecessary: Cecilia arose at five o'clock, dressed Cecilia with the utmost  heaviness of heart, and in going through a long gallery which led to the  staircase, as Cecilia passed the door of Mortimer   chamber, the thought of Mortimer   ill  health, Mortimer   intended long journey, and the probability that Cecilia might never see  Mortimer   more, so deeply impressed and saddened Cecilia, that scarcely could Cecilia force  Cecilia to proceed, without stopping to weep and to pray for Mortimer  ; Cecilia was  surrounded, however, by servants, and compelled therefore to hasten to the  chaise; Cecilia flung Cecilia in, and, leaning back, drew Cecilia hat over Cecilia eyes,  and thought, as the carriage drove off, Cecilia last hope of earthly happiness  extinguished.
