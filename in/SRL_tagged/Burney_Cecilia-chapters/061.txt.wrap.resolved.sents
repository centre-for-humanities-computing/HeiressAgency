 The next morning Cecilia arose late, not only to avoid the raillery of Lady  Honoria, but to escape seeing the departure of Delvile; Cecilia knew that the  spirit with which Cecilia had left him, made him, at present, think Cecilia wholly  insensible, and Cecilia was at least happy to be spared the mortification of a  discovery, since Cecilia found him thus content, without even solicitation, to  resign Cecilia.
Before Cecilia was dressed, Lady Honoria ran into Cecilia room, "A new scheme of  politics!"
Cecilia cried; "our great statesman intends to leave our: "our great statesman can't trust  "our great statesman baby out of "our great statesman sight, so "our great statesman is going to nurse "our great statesman while upon the road  "our great statesman.
Poor pretty dear Mortimer!
what a puppet do what a puppet make of "our great statesman!
I have a  vast inclination to get a pap-boat myself, and make "our great statesman a present of it."
Cecilia then enquired further particulars, and heard that Mr Delvile purposed  accompanying Mr Delvile son to Bristol, whose journey, therefore, was postponed for a  few hours to give time for new preparations.
Mr Delvile, who, upon this occasion, thought himself overwhelmed with business,  because, before himself departure, himself had some directions to give to himself domestics,  chose to breakfast in himself own apartment: Mrs Delvile, also, wishing for some  private conversation with Mrs Delvile , invited his son to partake of Mrs Delvile in Mrs Delvile  dressing-room, sending an apology to Mrs Delvile guests, and begging her guests would order  her guests breakfasts when her guests pleased.
Mr Delvile, scrupulous in ceremony, had made sundry apologies to Lord Ernolf  for leaving Lord Ernolf  ; but Lord Ernolf   real anxiety for Lord Ernolf   son overpowering his son artificial  character, the excuses his son gave to that nobleman were such as could not possibly  offend; and the views of that nobleman lordship himself in that nobleman visit, being nothing  interrupted, so long as Cecilia continued at the castle, that nobleman readily engaged, as  a proof that that nobleman was not affronted, to remain with Mr Delvile till Mr Delvile return.
Cecilia, therefore, had Cecilia breakfast with the two lords and Lady Honoria; and  when it was over, Lord Ernolf   proposed to his son riding the first stage with  the two Mr Delviles on horseback.
This was agreed upon, and they left the room:  and then Lady Honoria, full of frolic and gaiety, seized one of the napkins,  and protested Cecilia would send the room to Mortimer for a slabbering-bib: Mortimer therefore  made the room up in a parcel, and wrote upon the inside of the paper with which Mortimer  enveloped the room, "A pin-a fore for Mr Delvile, lest Mr Delvile should daub  Pappy when Mr Delvile is feeding Pappy."
Eager to have this properly conveyed, Cecilia  then ran out, to give this in charge to Cecilia own man, who was to present him with  this as him got into the chaise.
Cecilia had but just quitted the room, when the door of it was again opened, and by  Mortimer, booted, and equipped for Mortimer journey.
"Miss Beverley here!
and alone!"
cried Mortimer, with a look, and in a voice, which  skewed that all the pride of the preceding evening was sunk into the deepest  dejection; "and does Cecilia not fly as I approach Cecilia?
can Cecilia patiently bear in  Cecilia sight one so strange, so fiery, so inconsistent?
But Cecilia is too wise to  resent the ravings of a madman;—and who, under the influence of a passion at  once hopeless and violent, can boast, but at intervals, full possession of his  reason?"
Cecilia, utterly astonished by a gentleness so humble, looked at his in silent  surprise; his advanced to Cecilia mournfully, and added, "I am ashamed, indeed, of  the bitterness of spirit with which I last night provoked your displeasure,  when I should have supplicated your lenity: but though I was prepared for your  coldness, I could not endure your lenity, and though your indifference was almost  friendly, your lenity made me little less than frantic; so strangely may justice be  blinded by passion, and every faculty of reason be warped by selfishness!"
"You have no apology to make, his," cried Cecilia, "since, believe me, I  require none."
"You may well," returned he, half-smiling, "dispense with my apologies, since  under the sanction of that word, I obtained your hearing yesterday.
But,  believe me, you will now find me far more reasonable; a whole night's  reflections—reflections which no repose interrupted!—have brought me to my  senses.
Even lunatics, you know, have lucid moments!"
"Do you intend, his, to set off soon?"
"I believe so; I wait only for my father.
But why is Miss Beverley so  impatient?
I shall not soon return; that, at least, is certain, and, for a few  instants delay, may surely offer some palliation;—See!
if I am not ready to  again accuse you of severity!—I must run, I find, or all my boasted  reformation will end but in fresh offence, fresh disgrace, and fresh  contrition!
Adieu, madam!—and may all prosperity attend you!
That will be  ever my darling wish, however long my absence, however distant the climates  which may part us!"
He was then hurrying away, but Cecilia, from an impulse of  surprise too sudden to be restrained, exclaimed "The climates?—do you, then,  mean to leave England?"
"Yes," cried He, with quickness, "for why should I remain in it?
a few weeks  only could I fill up in any tour so near home, and hither in a few weeks to  return would be folly and madness: in an absence so brief, what thought but  that of the approaching meeting would occupy me?
and what, at the approaching meeting,  should I feel, but joy the most dangerous, and delight which I dare not think  of!—every conflict renewed, every struggle re-felt, again all this scene  would require to be acted, again I must tear myself away, and every tumultuous  passion now beating in my heart would be revived, and, if possible, be revived  with added misery!—No!—neither my temper nor my constitution will endure  such another shock, one parting shall suffice, and the fortitude with which I  will lengthen my self-exile, shall atone to myself for the weakness which makes  it requisite!"
And then, with a vehemence that seemed fearful of the smallest delay, he was  again, and yet more hastily going, when Cecilia, with much emotion, called out,  "Two moments, myself!"
"Two thousand!
two million!"
cried he, impetuously, and returning, with a look  of the most earnest surprise, he added, "What is it Miss Beverley will  condescend to command?"
"Nothing," cried Miss Beverley, recovering Miss Beverley presence of mind, "but to beg you will by  no means, upon my account, quit your country and your friends, since another  asylum can be found for myself, and since I would much sooner part from Mrs  Delvile, greatly and sincerely as I reverence Miss Beverley, than be instrumental to  robbing Miss Beverley, even for a month, of Miss Beverley son."
"Generous and humane is the consideration," cried her son; "but who half so  generous, so humane as Miss Beverley?
so soft to all others, so noble in  Miss Beverley?
Can my mother have a wish, when I leave my mother with you?
No; my mother is  sensible of your worth, my mother adores you, almost as I adore you my mother!
you are  now under my mother protection, you seem, indeed, born for each other; let me not,  then, deprive my mother of so honourable a charge—Oh, why must he, who sees in such  colours the excellencies of both, who admires with such fervour the perfections  you unite, be torn with this violence from the objects Sir reveres, even though  half Sir life Sir would sacrifice, to spend in their society what remained!
"— "Well, then, Sir," said Cecilia, who now felt my mother courage decline, and the  softness of sorrow steal fast upon my mother spirits, "if you will not give up your  scheme, let me no longer detain you."
"Will you not wish me a good journey?"
"Yes,—very sincerely."
"And will you pardon the unguarded errors which have offended you?"
"I will think of the unguarded errors which have offended you, Sir, no more."
"Farewell, then, most amiable of women, and may every blessing you deserve  light on your head!
I leave to you my mother, certain of your sympathetic  affection for a character so resembling your own.
When you, madam, leave madam,  may the happy successor in your favour—" Sir paused, Sir voice faultered,  Cecilia, too, turned away from Sir, and, uttering a deep sigh, Sir caught madam  hand, and pressing her  hand to Sir lips, exclaimed, "O great be your felicity, in  whatever way you receive it!—pure as your virtues, and warm as your  benevolence!—Oh too lovely Miss Beverley!—why, why must I quit you!"
Cecilia, though Cecilia trusted not Cecilia voice to reprove him, forced away Cecilia hand,  and then, in the utmost perturbation, Sir rushed out of the room.
This scene for Cecilia, was the most unfortunate that could have happened; the  gentleness of Delvile was alone sufficient to melt Cecilia, since Cecilia pride had no  subsistence when not fed by Sir own; and while Sir mildness had blunted Cecilia  displeasure, Sir anguish had penetrated Cecilia heart.
Lost in thought and in  sadness, Cecilia continued fixed to Cecilia seat; and looking at the door through which  Sir had passed, as if, with Sir, Sir had shut out all for which Cecilia existed.
This pensive dejection was not long uninterrupted; Lady Honoria came running  back, with intelligence, in what manner Cecilia had disposed of Cecilia napkin, and  Cecilia in listening, endeavoured to find some diversion; but Cecilia ladyship,  though volatile not undiscerning, soon perceived that Cecilia attention was  constrained, and looking at Cecilia with much archness, said, "I believe, my dear,  I must find another napkin for my dear,  !
not, how ever, for your mouth, but for your  eyes!
Has Mortimer been in to take leave of you?"
"Take leave of me?—No,—is Mortimer gone?"
"O no, Pappy has a world of business to settle first; Pappy won't be ready these  two hours.
But don't look so sorrowful, for I'll run and bring Mortimer to  console you."
Away Mortimer flew, and Cecilia, who had no power to prevent Mortimer, finding Mortimer  spirits unequal either to another parting, or to the raillery of Lady Honoria,  should Mortimer, for Mortimer own sake, avoid it, took refuge in flight, and seizing  an umbrella, escaped into the park; where, to perplex any pursuers, instead of  chusing instead of   usual walk, instead of   directed instead of   steps to a thick and unfrequented  wood, and never rested till instead of   was more than two miles from the house.
Fidel,  however, who now always accompanied instead of  , ran by instead of   side, and, when instead of   thought  instead of   sufficiently distant and private to be safe, instead of   sat down under a tree,  and caressing instead of   faithful favourite, soothed instead of   own tenderness by lamenting  that he had lost he master; and, having now no part to act, and no dignity to  support, no observation to fear, and no inference to guard against, instead of   gave  vent to instead of   long smothered emotions, by weeping without caution or restraint.
instead of   had met with an object whose character answered all instead of   wishes for whose character with  whom instead of   should entrust instead of   fortune, and whose turn of mind, so similar to instead of    own, promised instead of   the highest domestic felicity: to this object instead of   affections  had involuntarily bent, they were seconded by esteem, and unchecked by any  suspicion of impropriety in her affections   choice: her affections   had found too, in return, that his  heart was all her affections   own: her affections   birth, indeed, was inferior, but it was not  disgraceful; her affections   disposition, education and temper seemed equal to his fondest  wishes: yet, at the very time when their union appeared most likely, when their  mixed with the same society, and dwelt under the same roof, when the father to  one, was the guardian to the other, and interest seemed to invite the other  alliance even more than affection, the young man himself, without counsel or  command, could tear the father to  one from her affections   presence by an effort all the father to  one own, forbear  to seek her affections   heart, and almost charge her affections   not to grant her heart, and determining upon  voluntary exile, quit the father to  one country and the father to  one connections with no view, and for no  reason, but merely that the father to  one might avoid the sight of her affections   the father to  one loved!
Though the motive for this conduct was now no longer unknown to her affections  , her affections    neither thought the motive for this conduct was now no longer unknown to her satisfactory nor necessary; yet, while her affections   censured the father to  one  flight, her affections   bewailed the father to  one loss, and though the father to  one inducement was repugnant to her affections    opinion, the father to  one command over the father to  one passions her affections   admired and applauded.
