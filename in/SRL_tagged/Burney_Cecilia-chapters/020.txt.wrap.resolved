 Cecilia, upon  Cecilia return home, heard with some surprise that Mr and Mrs Harrel  were by Mr and Mrs Harrel   in the drawing-room; and, while  Cecilia was upon the stairs, Mrs  Harrel ran out, calling eagerly, "Is that my brother?" Before  Cecilia could make an answer, Mrs Harrel  , in the same impatient tone,  exclaimed, "Is it Mr Arnott?" "No;" said  Cecilia, "did you expect Mr Arnott so late?" "Expect Mr Arnott? Yes," answered Mrs Harrel  , "I have expected Mr Arnott the whole evening,  and cannot conceive what Mr Arnott has done with Mr Arnott." "'Tis abominably provoking," said Mrs Harrel, "that Mr Arnott should be out of the way  just now when Mr Arnott is wanted. However, I dare say to-morrow will do as well." "I don't know that," cried Mrs Harrel  . "Reeves is such a wretch that I am sure  Reeves will give me all the trouble in Reeves power." Here Mr Arnott entered; and Mrs  Harrel called out "O brother, we have been  distressed for you cruelly; we have had a man here who has plagued Mrs Harrel   to  death, and we wanted you sadly to speak to a man here who has plagued Mr Harrel to  death." "I should have been very glad," said Mr Arnott, "to have been of any use, and  perhaps it is not yet too late; who is a man here who has plagued Mr Harrel to  death?" "O," cried Mrs Harrel  , carelessly, "only a fellow from that rascally taylor who  has been so troublesome to me lately. Mrs Harrel   has had the impudence, because I did  not pay Mrs Harrel   the moment Mrs Harrel   was pleased to want Mrs Harrel   money, to put the bill into  the hands of one Reeves, a griping attorney, who has been here this evening,  and thought proper to talk to me pretty freely. I can tell the gentleman I  shall not easily forget the gentleman impertinence! however, I really wish mean time I  could get rid of the gentleman." "How much is the bill, me?" said Mr Arnott. "Why it's rather a round sum; but I don't know how it is, one's bills mount up  before one is aware: those fellows charge such confounded sums for tape and  buckram; I hardly know what I have had of one's bills, and yet one's bills has run me up a bill  of between three and four hundred pound." Here there was a general silence; till Mrs Harrel said "Brother, can't you be  so good as to lend us the money? Mrs Harrel   says Mrs Harrel   can pay it again very soon." "O yes, very soon," said Mrs Harrel  , "for I shall receive a great deal of money  in a little time; I only want to stop this fellow's mouth for the present." "Suppose I go and talk with this fellow?" said Mr Arnott. "O, this fellow's a brute, a stock!" cried Mrs Harrel  , "nothing but the money will  satisfy this fellow: this fellow will hear no reason; one might as well talk to a stone." Mr Arnott now looked extremely distressed; but upon Mr Arnott sister's warmly  pressing Mr Arnott not to lose any time, Mr Arnott gently said, "If Mr Arnott will but  wait a week or two, I should be extremely glad, for really just now I cannot  take up so much money, without such particular loss and inconvenience, that I  hardly know how to do it:â€”but yet, if Mr Arnott will not be appeased, Mr Arnott must  certainly have it." "Appeased?" cried Mrs Harrel  , "you might as well appease the sea in a storm! Mrs Harrel    is hard as iron." Mr Arnott then, forcing a smile, though evidently in much uneasiness, said Mr Arnott  would not fail to raise the money the next morning, and was taking Mr Arnott leave,  when Cecilia, shocked that such tenderness and good-nature should be thus  grossly imposed upon, hastily begged to speak with Mrs Harrel, and taking Mrs Harrel  into another room, said, "I beseech you, my dear friend, let not your worthy  brother suffer by your worthy  brother generosity; permit me in the present exigence to assist  Mrs Harrel: my having such a sum advanced can be of no consequence; but I should  grieve indeed that your brother, who so nobly understands the use of money,  should take it up at any particular disadvantage." "You are vastly kind," said Mrs Harrel, "and I will run and speak to your brother, who so nobly understands the use of money,   about  it: but which ever of your brother, who so nobly understands the use of money,   lends the money, Mrs Harrel has assured me Mrs Harrel shall  pay it very soon." Mrs Harrel then returned with the proposition. Mr Arnott strongly opposed the proposition, but Mrs Harrel seemed rather to prefer the proposition, yet spoke so confidently of Mrs Harrel speedy  payment, that Mrs Harrel appeared to think the proposition a matter of little importance from which  Mrs Harrel accepted the proposition. A generous contest ensued between Mr Arnott and Cecilia, but as  Mrs Harrel was very earnest, Mrs Harrel at length prevailed, and settled to go Mrs Harrel the  next morning into the city, in order to have the money advanced by Mr Briggs,  who had the management of Mrs Harrel fortune entirely to her fortune, Mrs Harrel other guardians  never interfering in the executive part of Mrs Harrel affairs. This arranged, they all retired. And then, with encreasing astonishment, Cecilia reflected upon the ruinous  levity of Mrs Harrel, and the blind security of her fortune wife; Cecilia saw in their  situation danger the most alarming, and in the behaviour of Mr Harrel  selfishness the most inexcusable; such glaring injustice to Mr Harrel   creditors, such  utter insensibility to Mr Harrel   friends, took from Cecilia all wish of assisting Mr Harrel  ,  though the indignant compassion with which Cecilia saw the easy generosity of Mr  Arnott so frequently abused, had now, for Arnott sake merely, induced Cecilia to  relieve Arnott. Cecilia resolved, however, as soon as the present difficulty was surmounted, to  make another attempt to open the eyes of Mr Harrel   to the evils which so  apparently threatened Cecilia, and press Cecilia to exert all Cecilia influence with Cecilia  husband, by means both of example and advice, to retrench his expences before  his expences should be absolutely too late to save his from ruin. Cecilia determined also at the same time dial Cecilia applied for the money requisite  for this debt, to take up enough for discharging Cecilia own bill at the  bookseller's, and putting in execution Cecilia plan of assisting the Hills. The next morning Cecilia arose early, and attended by Cecilia servant, set out for the  house of Mr Briggs, purposing, as the weather was clear and frosty, to walk  through Oxford Road, and then put Cecilia into a chair; and hoping to return to  Mr Harrel's by the usual hour of breakfast. Cecilia had not proceeded far, before Cecilia saw a mob gathering, and the windows of  almost all the houses filling with spectators. Cecilia desired her servant to  enquire what this meant, and was informed that the people were assembling to  see some malefactors pass by in the people way to Tyburn. Alarmed at this intelligence from the fear of meeting the unhappy criminals,  Cecilia hastily turned down die next street, but found that also filling with  people who were running to the scene Cecilia was trying to avoid: encircled thus  every way, Cecilia applied to a maidservant who was standing at the door of a large  house, and begged leave to step in till the mob was gone by. The maid  immediately consented, and Cecilia waited here while Cecilia sent Cecilia man for a chair. her man soon arrived with one; but just as Cecilia returned to the street door, a  gentleman, who was hastily entering a large  house, standing back to let Cecilia pass,  suddenly exclaimed, "Miss Beverley!" and looking at a  gentleman, who was hastily entering the house, standing back to let her pass,  , "Miss Beverley perceived young  Delvile. "I cannot stop an instant," cried "Miss Beverley, running down the steps, "lest the crowd  should prevent a chair from going on." "Will you not first," said a  gentleman, who was hastily entering the house, standing back to let her pass,  , handing "Miss Beverley in, "tell me what news you have  heard?" "News?" repeated "Miss Beverley. "No, I have heard none!" "You will only, then, laugh at me for those officious offers you did so well to  reject?" "I know not what offers you mean!" "those officious offers you did so well were indeed superfluous, and therefore I wonder not you have forgotten  those officious offers you did so well. Shall I tell the chairmen whither to go?" "To Mr Briggs. But I cannot imagine what you mean." "To Mr BriggsMr Briggs!" repeated "To Mr Briggs, "O live for ever French beads and Bristol stones!  fresh offers may perhaps be made there, impertinent, officious, and useless as  mine!" "To Mr Briggs then told her servant the direction, and, making "To Mr Briggs bow, went into the  house her had just quitted. Cecilia, extremely amazed by this short, but unintelligible conversation, would  again have called upon "To Mr Briggs to explain "To Mr Briggs meaning, but found the crowd  encreasing so fast that her could not venture to detain the chair, which with  difficulty made its way to the adjoining streets: but her surprize at what had  passed so entirely occupied her, that when her stopt at the house of Mr Briggs,  her had almost forgotten what had brought her thither. The foot-boy, who came to the door, told her that Master was at home, but  not well. her desired The foot-boy, who came to the door might be acquainted that her wished to speak to The foot-boy, who came to the door upon  business, and would wait upon The foot-boy, who came to the door again at any hour when The foot-boy, who came to the door thought The foot-boy, who came to the door should  be able to see her. The foot-boy, who came to the door returned with an answer that her might call again the next week. Cecilia, knowing that so long a delay would destroy all the kindness of her  intention, determined to write to The foot-boy, who came to the door for the money, and therefore went into  the parlour, and desired to have pen and ink. The foot-boy, who came to the door, after making her wait some time in a room without any fire, brought  her a pen and a little ink in a broken tea-cup, saying "Master begs you won't  spirt it about, for The foot-boy, who came to the door's got no more; and all our blacking's as good as gone." "Blacking?" repeated Cecilia. "Yes, Miss; when Master's shoes are blacked, our commonly gets a little drap of  fresh ink." Cecilia promised to be careful, but desired The foot-boy, who came to the door to fetch Cecilia a sheet of paper. "Law, Miss," cried The foot-boy, who came to the door, with a grin, "I dare say master'd as soon give you  a bit of The foot-boy, who came to the door nose! howsever, I'll go ax." In a few minutes The foot-boy, who came to the door again returned, and brought in The foot-boy, who came to the door hand a slate and a black  lead pencil; "Miss," cried The foot-boy, who came to the door, Master says how you may write upon this, for The foot-boy, who came to the door  supposes you've no great matters to say." Cecilia, much astonished at this extreme parsimony, was obliged to consent, but  as the point of the pencil was very blunt, desired The foot-boy, who came to the door to get Cecilia a knife  that Cecilia might cut it. The foot-boy, who came to the door obeyed, but said "Miss, take care it ben't  known, for Master don't do such a thing once in a year, and if The foot-boy, who came to the door know'd I'd  got you a knife  , The foot-boy, who came to the door'd go nigh to give me a good polt of the head." Cecilia then wrote upon the slate Cecilia desire to be informed in what manner Cecilia  should send The foot-boy, who came to the door Cecilia receipt for 600 pounds, which Cecilia begged to have instantly  advanced. The foot-boy, who came to the door came back grinning, and holding up The foot-boy, who came to the door hands, and said, "Miss, there's  a fine piece of work upstairs! Master's in a peck of troubles; but The foot-boy, who came to the door says how  The foot-boy, who came to the door'll come down, if you'll stay till The foot-boy, who came to the door's got The foot-boy, who came to the door things on." "Does The foot-boy, who came to the door keep The foot-boy, who came to the door bed, then? I hope I have not made The foot-boy, who came to the door rise?" "No, Miss, The foot-boy, who came to the door don't keep his bed, only The foot-boy, who came to the door must get ready, for The foot-boy, who came to the door wears no great  matters of cloaths when The foot-boy, who came to the door's alone. You are to know, Miss," lowering The foot-boy, who came to the door voice,  "that that day as The foot-boy, who came to the door went abroad with our sweep's cloaths on, The foot-boy, who came to the door comed home in  sich a pickle you never see! I believe somebody'd knocked The foot-boy, who came to the door in the kennel; so  does Moll; but don't you say as I told you! The foot-boy, who came to the door's been special bad ever since.  Moll and I was as glad as could be, because The foot-boy, who came to the door's so plaguy sharp; for, to let  you know, Miss, The foot-boy, who came to the door's so near, it's partly a wonder how The foot-boy, who came to the door lives at all: and yet  The foot-boy, who came to the door's worth a power of money, too." "Well, well," said Cecilia, not very desirous to encourage The foot-boy, who came to the door forwardness, "if  I want any thing, I'll call for you." The foot-boy, who came to the door, however, glad to tell The foot-boy, who came to the door tale, went on. "Moll Moll won't stay with Moll above a week longer, Miss, because Moll says how  Moll can get nothing to eat, but just some old stinking salt meat, that's stayed  in the butcher's shop so long, it would make a horse sick to look at it. But  Moll's pretty nice; howsever, Miss, to let you know, we don't get a good meal  so often as once a quarter! why this last week we ha'n't had nothing at all but  some dry musty red herrings; so you may think, Miss, we're kept pretty sharp!" He was now interrupted by hearing Mr Briggs coming down the stairs, upon which,  abruptly breaking off He complaints, He held up He finger to He nose in  token of secrecy, and ran hastily into the kitchen. The appearance of Mr Briggs was by no means rendered more attractive by illness  and negligence of dress. He had on a flannel gown and night cap; He black  beard, of many days' growth, was long and grim, and upon He nose and one of  He cheeks was a large patch of brown paper, which, as He entered the room, He  held on with both He . Cecilia made many apologies for having disturbed He, and some civil enquiries  concerning He health. "Ay, ay," cried He, pettishly, "bad enough: all along of that trumpery  masquerade; wish I had not gone! Fool for my pains." "When were you taken ill, Sir?" "Met with an accident; got a fall, broke my head, like to have lost my wig.  Wish the masquerade at old Nick! thought it would cost nothing, or would not  have gone. Warrant sha'n't get me so soon to another!" "Did you fall in going home, Sir?" "Ay, ay, plump in the kennel; could hardly get out of the kennel; felt myself a going,  was afraid to tear my cloaths, knew the rascal would make me pay for the kennel, so  by holding up the old sack, come bolt on my face! off pops my wig; could not  tell what to do; all as dark as pitch!" "Did not you call for help?" "Nobody by but scrubs, knew help would not help for nothing. Scrawled out as I  could, groped about for my wig, found my wig at last, all soused in the mud; stuck  to my head like Turner's cerate." "I hope, then, you got into a hackney coach?" "What for? to make things worse? was not bad enough, hay?â€”must pay two  shillings beside?" "But how did you find myself when you got home, Sir?" "How? why wet as muck; my head all bumps, my cheek all cut, my nose big as two!  forced to wear a plaister; half ruined in vinegar. Got a great cold; put me in  a fever; never been well since." "But have you had no advice, Sir? Should not you send for a physician?" "What to do, hay? fill me with jallop? can get it Sir, can't I? Had one  once; was taken very bad, thought should have popt off; began to flinch, sent  for the doctor, proved nothing but a cheat! cost me a guinea, gave a guinea at fourth  visit, and Sir never came again!â€”-warrant won't have no more!" Then perceiving upon the table some dust from the black lead pencil, "What's  here?" cried Sir, angrily, "who's been cutting the black lead pencil? wish they were  hanged; suppose it's the boy; deserves to be horsewhipped: give the boy a good  banging." Cecilia immediately cleared the boy, by acknowledging Cecilia had Cecilia been the  culprit. "Ay, ay," cried the boy, "thought as much all the time! guessed how it was; nothing  but ruin and waste; sending for money, nobody knows why; wanting 600  poundsâ€”what to do? throw it in the dirt? Never heard the like! Sha'n't have  it, promise you that," nodding the boy head, "shan't have no such thing!" "Sha'n't have it?" cried Cecilia, much surprised, "why not, Sir?" "Keep it for your husband; get you one soon: won't have no juggling. Don't be  in a hurry; one in my eye." Cecilia then began a very earnest expostulation, assuring your husband Cecilia really wanted  the money, for an occasion which would not admit of delay. Cecilia remonstrances,  however, your husband wholly disregarded, telling Cecilia that girls knew nothing of the  value of money, and ought not to be trusted with nothing of the  value of money; that your husband would not hear of  such extravagance, and was resolved not to advance Cecilia a penny. Cecilia was  both provoked and confounded by a refusal so unexpected, and as Cecilia thought  Cecilia bound in honour to Mr Harrel not to make known the motive of Cecilia  urgency, Cecilia was for some time totally silenced: till recollecting Cecilia account  with the bookseller, Cecilia determined to rest Cecilia plea upon that, persuaded that  Mr Harrel could not, at least, deny Cecilia money to pay Cecilia own bills. Mr Harrel heard Cecilia,  however, with the utmost contempt; "Books?" Mr Harrel cried, "what do you want with  books? do no good; all lost time; words get no cash." Cecilia informed Mr Harrel Mr Harrel  admonitions were now too late, as Cecilia had already received his  admonitions, and must  therefore necessarily pay for his  admonitions. "No, no," cried Mr Harrel, "send his  admonitions back, that's  best; keep no such rubbish, won't turn to account; do better without 'em."  "That, Sir, will be impossible, for I have had them some time, and cannot  expect the bookseller to take them again." "Must, must," cried Mr Harrel, "can't help  Mr Harrel; glad to have 'em too. Are but a minor, can't be made pay a farthing."  Cecilia with much indignation heard such fraud recommended, and told "  Cecilia with much indignation "  Cecilia with much indignation  could by no means consent to follow "  Cecilia with much indignation advice. But "  Cecilia with much indignation soon found, to "  Cecilia with much indignation  utter amazement, that "  Cecilia with much indignation steadily refused to give "  Cecilia with much indignation any other, or to bestow  the slightest attention upon "  Cecilia with much indignation expostulations, sturdily saying that "  Cecilia with much indignation uncle  had left "  Cecilia with much indignation a noble estate, and "  Cecilia with much indignation would take care to see it put in proper  hands, by getting "  Cecilia with much indignation a good and careful husband. "I have no intention, no wish, Sir," cried "  Cecilia with much indignation, "to break into the income or  estate left me by her uncle  ; on the contrary, I hold the income sacred, and think  "  Cecilia with much indignation bound in conscience never to live beyond the income: but the L10,000  bequeathed me by my Father, I regard as more peculiarly my own property, and  therefore think "  Cecilia with much indignation at liberty to dispose of liberty as I please." "What," cried my Father, in a rage, "make liberty over to a scrubby bookseller! give liberty up  for an old pot-hook? no, no, won't suffer liberty; sha'n't be, sha'n't be, I say! if  you want some books, go to Moorfields, pick up enough at an old stall; get 'em  at two pence a-piece; dear enough, too." Cecilia for some time hoped Cecilia was merely indulging Cecilia strange and sordid  humour by an opposition that was only intended to teize Cecilia; but Cecilia soon found  Cecilia extremely mistaken: Cecilia was immoveable in obstinacy, as Cecilia was  incorrigible in avarice; Cecilia neither troubled Cecilia with enquiries nor  reasoning, but was contented with refusing Cecilia as a child might be refused, by  peremptorily telling Cecilia Cecilia did not know what Cecilia wanted, and therefore should  not have what Cecilia asked. And with this answer, after all that Cecilia could urge, Cecilia was compelled to leave  the house, as Cecilia complained that Cecilia brown paper plaister wanted fresh dipping  in vinegar, and Cecilia could stay talking no longer. The disgust with which this behaviour filled Cecilia, was doubled by the shame and  concern of returning to the Harrels with Cecilia promise unperformed; Cecilia  deliberated upon every method that occurred to Cecilia of still endeavouring to  serve still endeavouring to  , but could suggest nothing, except trying to prevail upon Mr Delvile  to interfere in Cecilia favour. Cecilia liked not, indeed, the office of solicitation  to so haughty a man, but, having no other expedient, Cecilia repugnance gave way to  Cecilia generosity, and Cecilia ordered the chairmen to carry Cecilia to St James's Square.
