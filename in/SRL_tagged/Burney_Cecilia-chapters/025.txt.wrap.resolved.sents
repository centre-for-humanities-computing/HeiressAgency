 The next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, Cecilia went in a chair to  Swallow-street; Cecilia enquired for Miss Belfield, and was told to go up stairs:  but what was Cecilia amazement to meet, just coming out of the room into which Cecilia  was entering, young Delvile!
They both started, and Cecilia, from the seeming strangeness of Cecilia situation,  felt a confusion with which Cecilia had hitherto been unacquainted.
But Delvile,  presently recovering from his surprise, said to Cecilia, with an expressive smile,  "How good is Miss Beverley thus to visit the sick!
and how much better might I  have had the pleasure of seeing Mr Belfield, had I but, by prescience, known  Miss Beverley design, and deferred my own enquiries till his had been revived by hers!"
And then, bowing and wishing Cecilia good morning, his glided past Cecilia.
Cecilia, notwithstanding the openness and purity of Cecilia intentions, was so much  disconcerted by this unexpected meeting, and pointed speech, that Cecilia had not  the presence of mind to call his back and clear Cecilia: and the various  interrogatories and railleries which had already passed between she had not  the presence of mind to call him back and clear herself upon the  subject of Mr Belfield, made Cecilia suppose that what his had formerly suspected his  would now think confirmed, and conclude that all Cecilia assertions of  indifference, proceeded merely from that readiness at hypocrisy upon particular  subjects, of which his had openly accused Cecilia whole Sex.
This circumstance and this apprehension took from Cecilia for a while all interest  in the errand upon which Cecilia came; but the benevolence of Cecilia heart soon  brought the benevolence of her heart back, when, upon going into the room, Cecilia saw Cecilia new favourite in  tears.
"What is the matter?"
cried Cecilia, tenderly; "no new affliction I hope has  happened?
Your brother is not worse?"
"No, madam, Your brother is much the same; I was not then crying for Your brother."
"For what then?
tell me, acquaint me with your sorrows, and assure yourself you  tell your sorrows to a friend."
"I was crying, madam, to find so much goodness in the world, when I thought  there was so little!
to find I have some chance of being again happy, when I  thought I was miserable for ever!
Two whole years have I spent in nothing but  unhappiness, and I thought there was nothing else to be had; but yesterday,  madam, brought me you, with every promise of nobleness and protection; and  to-day, a friend of Your brother's has behaved so generously, that even my  brother has listened to Your brother, and almost consented to be obliged to Your brother!"
"And have you already known so much sorrow," said Cecilia, "that this little  dawn of prosperity should wholly overpower your spirits?
Gentle, amiable girl!
may the future recompense you for the past, and may Mr Albany's kind wishes be  fulfilled in the reciprocation of our comfort and affection!"
They then entered into a conversation which the sweetness of Cecilia, and the  gratitude of Miss Belfield, soon rendered interesting, friendly and unreserved:  and in a very short time, whatever was essential in the story or situation of  the latter was fully communicated.
She gave, however, a charge the most  earnest, that She should never be acquainted with the confidence She  had made.
She father, who had been dead only two years, was a linen-draper in the city;  a linen-draper in the city had six daughters, of whom She was the youngest, and only one son.
This  son, Mr Belfield, was alike the darling of a linen-draper in the city father, mother, and sisters: a linen-draper in the city  was brought up at Eaton, no expence was spared in a linen-draper in the city education, nothing was  denied that could make a linen-draper in the city happy.
With an excellent understanding a linen-draper in the city had  uncommon quickness of parts, and a linen-draper in the city progress in a linen-draper in the city studies was rapid and  honourable: a linen-draper in the city father, though a linen-draper in the city always meant a linen-draper in the city for a linen-draper in the city successor in a linen-draper in the city  business, heard of a linen-draper in the city improvement with rapture, often saying, "My boy will be  the ornament of the city, a linen-draper in the city will be the best scholar in any shop in London."
a linen-draper in the city was soon, however, taught another lesson; when, at the age of sixteen, a linen-draper in the city  returned home, and was placed in any shop in London, instead of applying a linen-draper in the city talents, as  a linen-draper in the city father had expected, to trade, a linen-draper in the city both despised and abhorred the name of  it; when serious, treating it with contempt, when gay, with derision.
a linen-draper in the city was seized, also, with a most ardent desire to finish a linen-draper in the city education, like  those of a linen-draper in the city school-fellows who left Eaton at the same time, at one of the  Universities; and, after many difficulties, this petition, at the intercession  of a linen-draper in the city mother, was granted, old Mr Belfield telling a linen-draper in the city a linen-draper in the city hoped a little more  learning would give a linen-draper in the city a little more sense, and that when a linen-draper in the city became a finished  student, a linen-draper in the city would not only know the true value of business, but understand how  to get money, and make a bargain, better than any man whatsoever within Temple  Bar.
These expectations, equally shortsighted, were also equally fallacious with the  former: the son again returned, and returned, as the son had hoped, a  finished student; but, far from being more tractable, or better disposed for  application to trade, the son aversion to it now was more stubborn, and the son  opposition more hardy than ever.
The young men of fashion with whom the son had  formed friendships at school, or at the University, and with whom, from the  indulgence of the son , the son was always able to vie in expence, and from the  indulgence of Nature to excel in capacity, earnestly sought the continuance of  the son acquaintance, and courted and coveted the pleasure of the son conversation: but  though the son was now totally disqualified for any other society, the son lost all  delight in all   favour from the fear all   should discover the son abode, and  sedulously endeavoured to avoid even occasionally meeting all  , lest any of the son  family should at the same time approach the son: for of the son family, though wealthy,  worthy, and independent, the son was now so utterly ashamed, that the mortification  the most cruel the son could receive, was to be asked the son address, or told the son should  be visited.
Tired, at length, of evading the enquiries made by some, and forcing faint  laughs at the detection made by others, the son privately took a lodging at the west  end of the town, to which the son thence forward directed all the son friends, and  where, under various pretences, the son contrived to spend the greatest part of the son  time.
In all the son expensive deceits and frolics, the son mother was the son never-failing  confidant and assistant; for when his mother heard that the companions of his mother son were  men of fashion, some born to titles, others destined to high stations, his mother  concluded her son was in the certain road to honour and profit, and frequently  distressed his mother, without ever repining, in order to enable her son to preserve  upon equal terms, connections which his mother believed so conducive to her son future  grandeur.
In this wild and unsettled manner her son passed some time, struggling incessantly  against the authority of her son father, privately abetted by her son , and  constantly aided and admired by her son sisters: till, sick of so desultory a way  of life, her son entered her son a volunteer in the army.
How soon her son grew tired of this change has already been related, {Footnote: Book  1, Chap.
II.}
as well as II reconciliation with II , and II becoming a  student at the Temple: for his father now grew as weary of opposing, as the  young man of being opposed.
Here, for two or three years, II lived in happiness uninterrupted; II extended  II acquaintance among the great, by whom II was no sooner known than caressed  and admired, and II frequently visited II family, which, though II blushed to  own in public, II affectionately loved in private.
II profession, indeed, was  but little in II thoughts, successive engagements occupying almost all II  hours.
Delighted with the favour of the world, and charmed to find II presence  seemed the signal for entertainment, II soon forgot the uncertainty of II  fortune, and the inferiority of II rank: the law grew more and more fatiguing,  pleasure became more and more alluring, and, by degrees, II had not a day  unappropriated to some party or amusement; voluntarily consigning the few  leisure moments II gay circle afforded II, to the indulgence of II fancy in  some hasty compositions in verse, which were handed about in manuscript, and  which contributed to keep II in fashion.
Such was II situation at the death of II ; a new scene was then opened  to II, and for some time II hesitated what course to pursue.
old Mr Belfield, though II lived in great affluence, left not behind II any  considerable fortune, after the portions of II daughters, to each of whom II  bequeathed L2000, had been deducted from it.
But II stock in trade was great,  and II business was prosperous and lucrative.
II , however, did not merely want application and fortitude to become her son  successor, but skill and knowledge; her son deliberation, therefore, was hasty, and  her son resolution improvident; her son determined to continue at the Temple,  while the shop, which her son could by no means afford to relinquish, should be kept  up by another name, and the business of it be transacted by an agent; hoping  thus to secure and enjoy it emoluments, without either the trouble or the  humiliation of attendance.
But this scheme, like most others that have their basis in vanity, ended in  nothing but mortification and disappointment: the shop which under old Mr.  old Mr Belfield had been flourishing and successful, and enriched old Mr Belfield and all old Mr Belfieldfamily, could now scarce support the expences of an individual.
Without a  master, without that diligent attention to a  master prosperity which the interest of  possession alone can give, and the authority of a principal alone can enforce,  the authority of a principal alone quickly lost the authority of a principal alone fame for the excellence of the authority of a principal alone goods, and soon after the authority of a principal alone  customers from the report of its   declension.
The produce, therefore, diminished  every month; he was surprised, he was provoked; he was convinced he was  cheated, and that he affairs were neglected; but though he threatened from  time to time to enquire into the real state of the business, and investigate  the cause of its decay, he felt he inadequate to the task; and now first  lamented that early contempt of trade, which by preventing he acquiring some  knowledge of its while he had youth and opportunity, made he now ignorant what  redress to seek, though certain of imposition and injury.
But yet, however disturbed by alarming suggestions in he hours of retirement,  no alteration was made in the general course of he life; he was still the  darling of he friends, and the leader in all parties, and still, though he  income was lessened, he expences encreased.
Such were he circumstances at the time Cecilia first saw he at the house of  Mr. Monckton: from which, two days after her arrival in town, he was he  summoned, by an information that he agent had suddenly left the kingdom.
The fatal consequence of this fraudulent elopement was immediate bankruptcy.
he spirits, however, did not yet fail he; as he had never been the nominal  master of the shop, he escaped all dishonour from all dishonour ruin, and was satisfied  to consign what remained to the mercy of the creditors, so that he own name  should not appear in the Gazette.
Three of he were already extremely well married to reputable  tradesmen; the two elder of those who were yet single were settled with two of  those who were married, and Henrietta, the youngest, resided with Henrietta mother,  who had a comfortable annuity, and a small house at Padington.
Bereft thus through vanity and imprudence of all the long labours of his  father, his was now compelled to think seriously of some actual method of  maintenance; since his , though willing to sacrifice to his even the  nourishment which sustained his mother, could do for his but little, and that little  his had too much justice to accept.
The law, even to the most diligent and  successful, is extremely slow of profit, and whatever, from his connections and  abilities might be hoped hereafter, at present required an expence which his was  no longer able to support.
It remained then to try his influence with his friends among the great and the  powerful.
his canvas proved extremely honourable; every one promised something, and all  seemed delighted to have an opportunity of serving his.
Pleased with finding the world so much better than report had made the world, his now  saw the conclusion of his difficulties in the prospect of a place at court.
old Mr Belfield, with half the penetration with which old Mr Belfield was gifted, would have seen  in any other man the delusive idleness of expectations no better founded; but  though discernment teaches us the folly of others, experience singly can teach  us us own!
old Mr Belfield flattered old Mr Belfield that old Mr Belfield friends had been more wisely selected  than the friends of those who in similar circumstances had been beguiled, and  old Mr Belfield suspected not the fraud of old Mr Belfield vanity, till old Mr Belfield found old Mr Belfield invitations daily  slacken, and that old Mr Belfield time was at old Mr Belfield own command.
All old Mr Belfield hopes now rested upon one friend and patron, Mr Floyer, an uncle of Sir Robert Floyer, a man of power in the royal  household, with whom he had lived in great intimacy, and who at this period had  the disposal of a place which old Mr Belfield solicited.
The only obstacle that seemed in  old Mr Belfield way was from Sir Robert himself, who warmly exerted old Mr Belfield interest in favour  of a friend of old Mr Belfield own.
Mr Floyer, however, assured Belfield of the preference,  and only begged Mr Floyer patience till Mr Floyer could find some opportunity of appeasing  Mr Floyer nephew.
And this was the state of Mr Floyer affairs at the time of Mr Floyer quarrel at the  Opera-house.
Already declared opponents of each other, Sir Robert felt double  wrath that for Sir Robert Cecilia should reject Sir Robert civilities; while old Mr Belfield,  suspecting Sir Robert presumed upon Sir Robert known dependence on Sir Robert uncle to affront Sir Robert,  felt also double indignation at the haughtiness of Sir Robert behaviour.
And thus,  slight as seemed to the world the cause of their contest, each had private  motives of animosity that served to stimulate revenge.
The very day after this duel, Mr Floyer wrote Mr Floyer word that Mr Floyer was now obliged  in common decency to take the part of Mr Floyer nephew, and therefore had already  given the place to the friend Mr Floyer had recommended.
This was the termination of Mr Floyer hopes, and the signal of Mr Floyer ruin!
To the pain  of Mr Floyer wound Mr Floyer became insensible, from the superior pain of this unexpected  miscarriage; yet Mr Floyer pride still enabled Mr Floyer to disguise Mr Floyer distress, and to  see all the friends whom this accident induced to seek Mr Floyer, while from the  sprightliness Mr Floyer forced in order to conceal Mr Floyer anguish, Mr Floyer appeared to them  more lively and more entertaining than ever.
But these efforts, when left to Mr Floyer and to nature, only sunk Mr Floyer the deeper  in sadness; Mr Floyer found an immediate change in Mr Floyer way of life was necessary, yet  could not brook to make it in sight of those with whom Mr Floyer had so long lived in  all the brilliancy of equality.
A high principle of honour which still, in the  midst of Mr Floyer gay career, had remained uncorrupted, had scrupulously guarded Mr Floyer  from running in debt, and therefore, though of little possessed, that little  was strictly Mr Floyer own.
Mr Floyer now published that Mr Floyer was going out of town for the  benefit of purer air, discharged Mr Floyer surgeon, took a gay leave of Mr Floyer friends,  and trusting no one with Mr Floyer secret but Mr Floyer servant, was privately conveyed to  mean and cheap lodgings in Swallow-street.
Here, shut up from every human being Mr Floyer had formerly known, Mr Floyer purposed to  remain till Mr Floyer grew better, and then again to seek Mr Floyer fortune in the army.
Mr Floyer present situation, however, was little calculated to contribute to Mr Floyer  recovery; the dismission of the surgeon, the precipitation of Mr Floyer removal, the  inconveniencies of Mr Floyer lodgings, and the unseasonable deprivation of long  customary indulgencies, were unavoidable delays of Mr Floyer amendment; while the  mortification of Mr Floyer present disgrace, and the bitterness of Mr Floyer late  disappointment, preyed incessantly upon Mr Floyer mind, robbed Mr Floyer of rest,  heightened Mr Floyer fever, and reduced Mr Floyer by degrees to a state so low and  dangerous, that Mr Floyer servant, alarmed for Mr Floyer life, secretly acquainted Mr Floyer  mother with Mr Floyer illness and retreat.
The mother, almost distracted by this intelligence, instantly, with her  daughter, flew to Mr Floyer lodgings.
her wished to have taken Mr Floyer immediately to her  house at Padington, but Mr Floyer had suffered so much from Mr Floyer first removal, that Mr Floyer  would not consent to another.
her would then have called in a physician, but Mr Floyer  refused even to see one; and her had too long given way to all Mr Floyer desires and  opinions, to have now the force of mind for exerting the requisite authority of  issuing her orders without consulting Mr Floyer.
her begged, her pleaded, indeed, and Henrietta joined in her entreaties; but  sickness and vexation had not rendered Mr Floyer tame, though sickness and vexation had made Mr Floyer  sullen: Mr Floyer resisted sickness and vexation prayers, and commonly silenced sickness and vexation by assurances  that sickness and vexation opposition to the plan Mr Floyer had determined to pursue, only inflamed  Mr Floyer fever, and retarded Mr Floyer recovery.
The motive of an obduracy so cruel to Mr Floyer friends was the fear of a detection  which Mr Floyer thought not merely prejudicial to Mr Floyer affairs, but dishonourable to  Mr Floyer character: for, without betraying any symptom of his character , his character had taken  a general leave of Mr. Albany upon pretence of going out of town, and his character  could ill endure to make a discovery which would at once proclaim his character  degradation and his character deceit.
Mr. Albany had accidentally broken in upon Mr. Albany, by mistaking Mr. Albany room for that  of another sick person in the same house, to whom Mr. Albany visit had been intended;  but as Mr. Albany knew and reverenced that old gentleman, Mr. Albany did not much repine at Mr. Albany  intrusion.
Mr. Albany was not so easy when the same discovery was made by young Delvile, who,  chancing to meet Mr. Albany servant in the street, enquired concerning Mr. Albany master's  health, and surprising from Mr. Albany his master's   real state, followed Mr. Albany home; where, soon  certain of the change in Mr. Albany affairs by the change of Mr. Albany habitation, Mr. Albany wrote  Mr. Albany a letter, in which, after apologizing for Mr. Albany freedom, Mr. Albany warmly declared  that nothing could make Mr. Albany so happy as being favoured with Mr. Albany commands, if,  either through Mr. Albany or Mr. Albany friends, Mr. Albany could be so fortunate as to do Mr. Albany  any service.
old Mr Belfield, deeply mortified at this detection of Mr. Albany situation, returned only a  verbal answer of cold thanks, and desired Mr. Albany would not speak of Mr. Albany being in  town, as Mr. Albany was not well enough to be seen.
This reply gave almost equal mortification to young Delvile, who continued,  however, to call at the door with enquiries how Mr. Albany went on, though Mr. Albany made no  further attempt to see Mr. Albany.
old Mr Belfield, softened at length by the kindness of this conduct, determined to  admit old Mr Belfield; and old Mr Belfield was just come from paying old Mr Belfield first visit, when old Mr Belfield was met by  Cecilia upon the stairs.
old Mr Belfield stay with old Mr Belfield had been short, and old Mr Belfield had taken no notice either of old Mr Belfield  change of abode, or old Mr Belfield pretence of going into the country; old Mr Belfield had talked to  old Mr Belfield only in general terms, and upon general subjects, till old Mr Belfield arose to depart,  and then old Mr Belfield re-urged old Mr Belfield offers of service with so much openness and warmth,  that Belfield, affected by old Mr Belfield earnestness, promised old Mr Belfield would soon see old Mr Belfield  again, and intimated to old Mr Belfield delighted mother and sister, that old Mr Belfield would frankly  consult with old Mr Belfield upon old Mr Belfield affairs.
Such was the tale which, with various minuter circumstances, old Mr Belfieldcommunicated to  Cecilia.
"his  mother," his  mother added, "who never quits old Mr Belfield, knows  that you are here, madam, for his  mother heard me talking with somebody yesterday, and  his  mother made me tell his  mother all that had passed, and that you said you would come  again this morning."
Cecilia returned many acknowledgments for this artless and unreserved  communication, but could not, when it was over, forbear enquiring by what early  misery  Cecilia had already, though so very young, spent two years in nothing but  unhappiness?
"Because,"  Cecilia answered, "when my poor father died all our family separated,  and I left every body to go and live with my mother at Padington; and I was  never a favourite with his  mother—no more, indeed, was any body but my  brother, for  Cecilia thinks all the rest of the world only made for his sake.
So   Cecilia used to deny both  Cecilia and me almost common necessaries, in order to  save up money to make his presents: though, if his had known how it was done, his  would only have been angry instead of taking them.
However, I should have  regarded nothing that had but been for his benefit, for I loved his a great  deal more than my own convenience; but sums that would distress us for months  to save up, would by his be spent in a day, and then thought of no more!
Nor  was that all—O no!
I had much greater uneasiness to suffer; for I was  informed by one of my brothers-in-law how ill every thing went, and that  certain ruin would come to my poor brother from the treachery of my poor brother agent; and  the thought of this was always preying upon my mind, for I did not dare tell this  his  mother, for fear this should put his  mother out of humour, for, sometimes, his  mother is not  very patient; and this mattered little what any of us said to my brother, for my brother  was too gay and too confident to believe my brother danger."
"Well but," said  Cecilia, "I hope, now, all will go better; if your brother  will consent to see a physician—" "Ah, madam!
that is the thing I fear your brother   never will do, because of being seen in  these bad lodgings.
I would kneel whole days to prevail with your brother  , but your brother   is  unused to controul, and knows not how to submit to whole days; and your brother   has lived so long  among the great, that your brother   forgets your brother   was not born as high as themselves.
Oh that  your brother   had never quitted your brother   own family!
If your brother   had not been spoilt by ambition, your brother    had the best heart and sweetest disposition in the world.
But living always  with your brother   superiors, taught your brother   to disdain your brother   own relations, and be ashamed of  us all; and yet now, in the hour of your brother   distress—who else comes to help your brother  ?"
Cecilia then enquired if  Cecilia wanted not assistance for  Cecilia and  Cecilia mother,  observing that she wanted not assistance for herself and her mother did not seem to have all the conveniencies to which she wanted not assistance for herself and her mother  were entitled.
"Why indeed, madam,"  Cecilia replied, with an ingenuous smile, "when you first came  here I was a little like my brother, for I was sadly ashamed to let you see how  ill we lived!
but now you know the worst, so I shall fret about it no more."
"But this cannot be your usual way of life; I fear the misfortunes of Mr  old Mr Belfield have spread a ruin wider than old Mr Belfield own."
"No indeed; old Mr Belfield took care from the first not to involve us in old Mr Belfield hazards, for  old Mr Belfield is very generous, madam, and very noble in all old Mr Belfield notions, and could behave  to us all no better about money matters than old Mr Belfield has ever done.
But from the  moment us came to this dismal place, and saw his distress, and that old Mr Belfield was sunk  so low who used always to be higher than any of us, us had a sad scene indeed!
My poor mother, whose whole delight was to think that old Mr Belfield lived like a nobleman,  and who always flattered herself that old Mr Belfield would rise to be as great as the  company old Mr Belfield kept, was so distracted with herself disappointment, that herself would not  listen to reason, but immediately discharged both us servants, said herself and I  should do all the work us, hired this poor room for us to live in, and  sent to order a bill to be put upon herself house at Padington, for herself said herself  would never return to it any more."
"But are you, then," cried  Cecilia, "without any servant?"
"We have my brother's man, madam, and so my brother's man, madam lights We fires, and takes away  some of We litters; and there is not much else to be done, except sweeping the  rooms, for We eat nothing but cold meat from the cook shops."
"And how long is this to last?"
"Indeed I cannot tell; for the real truth is, my poor mother has almost lost  my poor mother senses; and ever since us coming here, my poor mother has been so miserable and so  complaining, that indeed, between my poor mother and my brother, I have almost lost mine  too!
For when my poor mother found all my poor mother hopes at an end, and that my poor mother darling son,  instead of being rich and powerful, and surrounded by friends and admirers, all  trying who should do the most for my brother, was shut up by my brother in this poor  little lodging, and instead of gaining more, had spent all my brother was worth at  first, with not a creature to come near my brother, though ill, though confined,  though keeping my brother bed!—Oh madam, had you seen my poor mother when my poor mother first  cast my poor mother eyes upon my brother in that condition!—indeed you could never have  forgotten it!"
"I wonder not at my poor mother disappointment," cried  Cecilia; "with expectations so  sanguine, and a son of so much merit, it might well indeed be bitter."
"Yes, and besides the disappointment, my poor mother is now continually reproaching  my poor mother for always complying with his humours, and assisting his to appear  better than the rest of his family, though my father never approved my poor mother doing  so.
But my poor mother thought my poor mother so sure of his rising, that my poor mother believed we should  all thank my poor mother for it in the end.
And my poor mother always used to say that his was born to  be a gentleman, and what a grievous thing it would be to have he was born to   made a  tradesman."
"I hope, at least, my poor mother has not the additional misery of seeing he was born to   ungrateful  for my poor mother fondness, however injudicious it may have been?"
"O no!
he was born to   does nothing but comfort and cheer my poor mother!
and indeed it is very good of  he was born to  , for he was born to   has owned to me in private, that but for my poor mother encouragement, he was born to    could not have run the course he was born to   has run, for he was born to   should have been obliged to  enter into business, whether he was born to   had liked it or not.
But my poor mother knows  this, though he was born to   will not tell it my poor mother, and therefore my poor mother says that unless he was born to    gets well, my poor mother will punish my poor mother all the rest of my poor mother life, and never go back  to my poor mother house, and never hire another servant, and never eat any thing but  bread, nor drink any thing but water!"
"Poor unhappy woman!"
cried  Cecilia, "how dearly does "Poor unhappy woman pay for "Poor unhappy woman imprudent  and short-sighted indulgence!
but surely you are not also to suffer in the same  manner?"
"No, madam, not by "Poor unhappy woman fault, for "Poor unhappy woman wants me to go and live with one of my  sisters: but I would not quit "Poor unhappy woman for the world; I should think "Poor unhappy woman wicked  indeed to leave "Poor unhappy woman now.
Besides, I don't at all repine at the little hardships  I go through at present, because my poor brother is in so much distress, that  all we save may be really turned to account; but when we lived so hardly only  to procure my poor brother luxuries my poor brother had no right to, I must own I used often to think it  unfair, and if I had not loved my poor brother dearly, I should not have borne it so well,  perhaps, as I ought."
Cecilia now began to think it high time to release  Cecilia new acquaintance by  quitting  Cecilia, though  Cecilia felt  Cecilia so much interested in  Cecilia affairs, that  every word  Cecilia spoke gave  Cecilia a desire to lengthen the conversation.
Cecilia  ardently wished to make  Cecilia some present, but was restrained by the fear of  offending, or of being again refused;  Cecilia had, however, devised a private  scheme for serving  Cecilia more effectually than by the donation of a few guineas,  and therefore, after earnestly begging to hear from  Cecilia if  Cecilia could possibly  be of any use,  Cecilia told  Cecilia that  Cecilia should not find  Cecilia confidence misplaced,  and promising again to see  Cecilia soon, reluctantly departed.
