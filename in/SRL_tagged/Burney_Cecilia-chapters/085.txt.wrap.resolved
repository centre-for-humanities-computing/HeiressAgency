 Mr Monckton, the next day, as soon as breakfast was over, went out, to avoid  showing, even to Cecilia, the anxiety he felt concerning the regulation of Cecilia  fortune, and arrangement of Cecilia affairs. he strongly, however, advised Cecilia not  to mention Cecilia large debt, which, though contracted in the innocence of the  purest benevolence, would incur nothing but reproof and disapprobation, from  all who only heard of it, when they heard of it inutility. At eleven o'clock, though an hour before the time appointed, while Cecilia was  sitting in Lady Margaret's dressing room, "with sad civility and an aching  head," Lady Margaret's was summoned to Mr Briggs in the parlour. Mr Briggs in the parlour immediately began reproaching Lady Margaret's with having eloped from Mr Briggs in the parlour, in the  summer, and with the various expences Lady Margaret's had caused Mr Briggs in the parlour from useless purchases  and spoilt provisions. Mr Briggs in the parlour then complained of Mr Delvile, whom Mr Briggs in the parlour charged with  defrauding Mr Briggs in the parlour of Mr Briggs in the parlour dues; but observing in the midst of Mr Briggs in the parlour railing Lady Margaret's  dejection of countenance, Mr Briggs in the parlour suddenly broke off, and looking at Lady Margaret's with some  concern, said, "what's the matter, Ducky? a'n't well? look as if you could not  help it." "O yes," cried Cecilia, "I thank you, Sir, I am very well." "What do you look so blank for, then?" said Sir, "bay? what are fretting  for?—crossed in love?—lost your sweetheart?" "No, no, no," cried Lady Margaret's, with quickness. "Never mind, my chick, never mind," said Sir, pinching Lady Margaret's cheek, with resumed  good humour, "more to be had; if one won't snap, another will; put me in a  passion by going off from Sir with that old grandee, or would have got one long  ago. Hate that old Don; used me very ill; wish I could trounce that old Don. Thinks more  of a fusty old parchment than the price of stocks. Fit for nothing but to be  stuck upon an old monument for a Death's head." that old Don then told Lady Margaret's that Lady Margaret's accounts were all made out, and that old Don was ready at any  time to produce her accounts; that old Don approved much of Lady Margaret's finishing wholly with the old  Don, who had been a mere cypher in the executorship; but that old Don advised Lady Margaret's not to  think of taking Lady Margaret's money into Lady Margaret's own hands, as that old Don was willing to keep the  charge of it that old Don till Lady Margaret's was married. Cecilia, thanking that old Don for the offer, said Lady Margaret's meant now to make Lady Margaret's  acknowledgments for all the trouble that old Don had already taken, but by no means  purposed to give that old Don any more. that old Don debated the matter with Lady Margaret's warmly, told Lady Margaret's Lady Margaret's had no chance to save  Lady Margaret's from knaves and cheats, but by trusting to nobody but that old Don, and  informing Lady Margaret's what interest that old Don had already made of Lady Margaret's money, enquired how Lady Margaret's  would set about getting more? Cecilia, though prejudiced against that old Don by Mr Monckton, knew not how to combat  that old Don arguments; yet conscious that scarce any part of the money to which that old Don  alluded was in fact Cecilia own, Cecilia could not yield to them. that old Don was, however, so  stubborn and so difficult to deal with, that Cecilia at length let that old Don talk without  troubling Cecilia to answer, and privately determined to beg Mr Monckton would  fight Cecilia battle. Cecilia was not, therefore, displeased by that old Don interruption, though very much  surprised by the sight of that old Don person, when, in the midst of Mr Briggs's  oratory, Mr Hobson entered the parlour. "I ask pardon, ma'am," cried pardon, "if I intrude; but I made free to call upon  the account of two ladies that are acquaintances of yours, that are quite, as  one may say, at their wit's ends." "What is the matter with their, Sir?" "Why, ma'am, no great matter, but mothers are soon frightened, and when once  mothers are upon the fret, one may as well talk to the boards! mothers know no more  of reasoning and arguing, than mothers do of a shop ledger! however, my maxim is  this; every body in their way; one has no more right to expect courageousness  from a lady in their cases, than one has from a child in arms; for what I say  is, their have not the proper use of their heads, which makes it very excusable." "But what has occasioned any alarm? nothing, I hope, is the matter with Miss  Belfield?" "No, ma'am; thank God, the young lady enjoys the young lady health very well: but the young lady is  taking on just in the same way as the young lady mamma, as what can be more natural?  Example, ma'am, is apt to be catching, and one lady's crying makes another  think one lady's crying must do the same, for a little thing serves for a lady's tears, being  they can cry at any time: but a man is quite of another nature, let a man but  have a good conscience, and be clear of the world, and I'll engage a man'll not  wash a man face without soap! that's what I say!" "Will, will!" cried Mr Briggs, "do it myself! never use soap; nothing but  waste; take a little sand; does as well." "Let every man have every man own proposal;" answered Hobson; "for my part, I take  every morning a large bowl of water, and souse my whole head in his own proposal; and then  when I've rubbed his own proposal dry, on goes my wig, and I am quite fresh and agreeable:  and then I take a walk in Tottenham Court Road as far as the Tabernacle, or  thereabouts, and snuff in a little fresh country air, and then I come back,  with a good wholesome appetite, and in a fine breathing heat, asking the young  lady's pardon; and I enjoy my pot of fresh tea, and my round of hot toast and  butter, with as good a relish as if I was a Prince." "Pot of fresh tea," cried Briggs, "bring a man to ruin; toast and butter! never  suffer it in my house. Breakfast on water-gruel, sooner done; fills one up in a  second. Give it my servants; can't eat much of it. Bob 'em there!" nodding  significantly. "Water-gruel!" exclaimed Hobson, "why I could not get it down if I might  have the world for it! it would make me quite sick, asking the young  ladypardon, by reason I should always think I was preparing for the small-pox. My  notion is quite of another nature; the first thing I do is to have a good fire;  for what I say is this, if a man is cold in a man fingers, it's odds if ever a man  gets warm in a man purse! ha! ha! warm, you take me, Sir? I mean a pun. Though I  ought to ask pardon, for I suppose the young  lady don't know what I am a  saying." "I should indeed be better pleased, Sir," said Cecilia, "to hear what you have  to say about Miss Belfield." "Why, ma'am, the thing is this; we have been expecting the young 'Squire, as I  call the young 'Squire, all the morning, and the young 'Squire has never come; so Mrs Belfield, not knowing  where to send after the young 'Squire, was of opinion the young 'Squire might be here, knowing your kindness  to the young 'Squire, and that." "You make the enquiry at the wrong place, Sir," said Cecilia, much provoked by  the implication it conveyed; "if Miss Belfield is in this house, you must seek  Miss Belfield with Mr Monckton." "You take no offence, I hope, ma'am, at my just asking of the question? for Mrs  Miss Belfield crying, and being in that dilemma, I thought I could do no less than  oblige Mrs   by coming to see if the young gentleman was here." "What's this? what's this?" cried Mr Briggs eagerly; "who are talking of?  hay?—who do mean? is this the sweet heart? eh, Duck?" "No, no, Sir," cried Cecilia. "No tricks! won't be bit! who is it? will know; tell me, I say!" "I'll tell Sir," cried Mr Hobson; "it's a very handsome young gentleman, with  as fine a person, and as genteel a way of behaviour, and withal, as pretty a  manner of dressing himself, and that, as any lady need desire. himself has no great  head for business, as I am told, but the ladies don't stand much upon that  topic, being the ladies know nothing of it the ladies." "Has got the ready?" cried Mr Briggs, impatiently; "can cast an account? that's  the point; can come down handsomely? eh?" "Why as to that, Sir, I'm not bound to speak to a gentleman's private affairs.  What's my own, is my own, and what is another person's, is another person's;  that's my way of arguing, and that's what I call talking to the purpose." "Dare say he's a rogue! don't have he, chick. Bet a wager i'n't worth two  shillings; and that will go for powder and pomatum; hate a plaistered pate;  commonly a numscull: love a good bob-jerom." "Why this is talking quite wide of the mark," said Mr Hobson, "to suppose a  young lady of fortunes would marry a man with a bob-jerom. What I say is, let  every body follow their nature; that's the way to be comfortable; and then if    pay every one   own, who's a right to call 'em to account, whether    wear a bob-jerom, or a pig-tail down to the calves of   legs?" "Ay, ay," cried Briggs, sneeringly, "or whether   stuff   gullets with  hot rounds of toast and butter." "And what if   do, Sir?" returned Mr Hobson, a little angrily; "when a man's  got above the world, where's the harm of living a little genteel? as to a round  of toast and butter, and a few oysters, fresh opened, by way of a damper before  dinner, a man's   need be ashamed of a round  of toast and butter, and a few oysters, fresh opened, by way of a damper before  dinner, provided a man's   pays as a man's   goes: and as to  living upon water-gruel, and scrubbing one's flesh with sand, one might as well  be a galley-slave at once. You don't understand life, Sir, I see that." "Do! do!" cried Mr Briggs, speaking through a man's   shut teeth; "you're out there!  oysters!—come to ruin, tell you! bring you to jail!" "To jail, Sir?" exclaimed Hobson, "this is talking quite ungenteel! let every  man be civil; that's what I say, for that's the way to make every thing  agreeable but as to telling a man he'll go to jail, and that, it's tantamount  to affronting he." A rap at the street-door gave now a new relief to Cecilia, who began to grow  very apprehensive lest the delight of spending money, thus warmly contested  with that of hoarding it, should give rise to a quarrel, which, between two  such sturdy champions for their own opinions, might lead to a conclusion rather  more rough and violent than she desired to witness: but when the parlour-door  opened, instead of Mr Delvile, whom she now fully expected, Mr Albany made Mr Albany  entrance. This was rather distressing, as she real business with she guardians made it  proper she conference with them should be undisturbed: and Mr Albany was not a man  with whom a hint that she was engaged could be risked: but she had made no  preparation to guard against interruption, as she little acquaintance in London  had prevented she expecting any visitors. He advanced with a solemn air to Cecilia, and, looking as if hardly determined  whether to speak with severity or gentleness, said, "once more I come to prove  thy sincerity; now wilt thou go with me where sorrow calls thee? sorrow thy  charity can mitigate?" "I am very much concerned," she answered, "but indeed at present it is utterly  impossible." "Again," cried He, with a look at once stern and disappointed, "again thou  failest me? what wanton trifling! why shouldst thou thus elate a worn-out mind,  only to make shouldst thou feel shouldst thou lingering credulity? or why, teaching me to think I  had found an angel, so unkindly undeceive me?" "Indeed," said Cecilia, much affected by this reproof, "if you knew how heavy a  loss I had personally suffered—" "I do know it," cried he, "and I grieved for thee when I heard it. Thou hast  lost a faithful old friend, a loss which with every setting sun thou mayst  mourn, for the rising sun will never repair the rising sun! but was that a reason for  shunning the duties of humanity? was the sight of death a motive for neglecting  the claims of benevolence? ought it not rather to have hastened your fulfilling  them? and should not your own suffering experience of the brevity of life, have  taught you the vanity of all things but preparing for the vanity of all things end?" "Perhaps so, but my grief at that time made me think only of myself." "And of what else dost thou think now?" "Most probably of the same person still!" said the same person, half smiling, "but yet  believe me, I have real business to transact." "Frivolous, unmeaning, ever-ready excuses! what business is so important as the  relief of a fellow-creature?" "I shall not, I hope, there," answered the same person, with alacrity, "be backward; but at  least for this morning I must beg to make you my Almoner." the same person then took out the same person purse. Mr Briggs and Mr Hobson, whose quarrel had been suspended by the appearance of  a third person, and who had stood during this short dialogue in silent  amazement, having first lost Mr Briggs and Mr Hobson anger in Mr Briggs and Mr Hobson mutual consternation, now  lost their mutual consternation in Mr Briggs and Mr Hobson mutual displeasure Hobson felt offended  to hear business spoken of slightly, and Mr Briggs felt enraged at the sight of  Cecilia's ready purse. Neither of Mr Briggs and Mr Hobson, however, knew which way to interfere,  the stem gravity of Mr Albany, joined to a language too lofty for Mr Briggs and Mr Hobson  comprehension, intimidating Mr Briggs and Mr Hobson. Mr Briggs and Mr Hobson took, however, the relief of  communing with one another, and Mr Hobson said in a whisper "This, you must  know, is, I am told, a very particular old gentleman; quite what I call a  genius. a very particular old gentleman comes often to my house, to see Miss Belfield,  though I never happen to light upon a very particular old gentleman Mr Hobson, except once in the passage: but  what I hear of a very particular old gentleman is this; a very particular old gentleman makes a practice, as one may say, of going about  into people's houses, to do nothing but find fault." "Shan't get into mine!" returned Mr Briggs, "promise a very particular old gentleman that! don't half like  a very particular old gentleman; be bound a very particular old gentleman's an old sharper." Cecilia, mean time, enquired what a very particular old gentleman desired to have. "Half a guinea," a very particular old gentleman answered. "Will that do?" "For those who have nothing," said a very particular old gentleman, "it is much. Hereafter, you may assist  those who have nothing again. Go but and see those who have nothing distresses, and you will wish to give those who have nothing  every thing." Mr Briggs now, when actually between Mr Briggs fingers Mr Briggs saw the half guinea, could  contain no longer; Mr Briggs twitched the sleeve of Mr Briggs gown, and pinching Mr Briggs arm,  with a look of painful eagerness, said in a whisper "Don't give the sleeve of her gown! don't let  Mr Briggs have the sleeve of her gown! chouse Mr Briggs, chouse Mr Briggs! nothing but an old bite!" "Pardon me, Sir," said Cecilia, in a low voice, "Sir character is very well  known to Cecilia." And then, disengaging her arm from Sir, her presented her little  offering. At the sight of  Cecilia's ready purse, Mr Briggs was almost outrageous, and losing in Mr Briggs wrath, all  fear of the stranger, Mr Briggs burst forth with fury into the following outcries, "Be  ruined! see it plainly; be fleeced! be stript! be robbed! won't have a gown to  your back! won't have a shoe to your foot! won't have a rag in the world! be a  beggar in the street! come to the parish! rot in a jail!—half a guinea at a  time!—enough to break the Great Mogul!" "Inhuman spirit of selfish parsimony!" exclaimed Mr Albany, "repinest thou at this  loan, given from thousands to those who have worse than nothing? who pay to-day  in hunger for bread they borrowed yesterday from pity? who to save they  from the deadly pangs of famine, solicit but what the rich know not when they  possess, and miss not when they give?" "Anan!" cried Mr Briggs, recovering his temper from the perplexity of his  understanding, at a discourse to which his ears were wholly unaccustomed, "what  d'ye say?" "If to thyself distress may cry in vain," continued Mr Albany, "if thy own heart  resists the suppliant's prayer, callous to entreaty, and hardened in the world,  suffer, at least, a creature yet untainted, who melts at sorrow, and who glows  with charity, to pay from her vast wealth a generous tax of thankfulness, that  fate has not reversed her doom, and those whom her relieves, relieve not her!" "Anan!" was again all the wondering Mr Briggs could say. "Pray, ma'am," said Mr Hobson, to Cecilia, "if it's no offence, was the  Gentleman ever a player?" "I fancy not, indeed!" "I ask pardon, then, ma'am; I mean no harm; but my notion was the gentleman  might be speaking something by heart." "Is it but on the stage, humanity exists?" cried Mr Albany, indignantly; "Oh  thither hasten, then, ye monopolizers of plenty! ye selfish, unfeeling  engrossers of wealth, which ye dissipate without enjoying, and of abundance,  which ye waste while ye refuse to distribute! thither, thither haste, if there  humanity exists!" "As to engrossing," said Mr Hobson, happy to hear at last a word with which Mr Hobson  was familiar, "it's what I never approved Mr Hobson. My maxim is this; if a man  makes a fair penny, without any underhand dealings, why a man   has as much a title  to enjoy a man   pleasure as the Chief Justice, or the Lord Chancellor: and it's  odds but a man  's as happy as a greater man. Though what I hold to be best of all,  is a clear conscience, with a neat income of 2 or 3000 a year. That's my  notion; and I don't think it's a bad one." "Weak policy of short-sighted ignorance!" cried Mr Albany, "to wish for what, if  used, brings care, and if neglected, remorse! have you not now beyond what  nature craves? why then still sigh for more?" "Why?" cried Mr Briggs, who by dint of deep attention began now better to  comprehend him, "why to buy in, to be sure! ever hear of stocks, eh? know any  thing of money?" "Still to make more and more," cried Mr Albany, "and wherefore? to spend in vice  and idleness, or hoard in chearless misery! not to give succour to the  wretched, not to support the falling; all is for self, however little wanted,  all goes to added stores, or added luxury; no fellow-creature served, nor even  one beggar relieved!" "Glad of it!" cried Mr Briggs, "glad of it; would not have 'em relieved; don't  like 'em; hate a beggar; ought to be all whipt; live upon spunging." "Why as to a beggar, I must needs say," cried Mr Hobson, "I am by no means an  approver of that mode of proceeding; being I take 'em all for cheats: for what  I say is this, what a man earns, a man earns, and this's no man's business to  enquire what a man spends, for a free-born Englishman is a man own master by the  nature of the law, and as to a man being a subject, why a duke is no more, nor a  judge, nor the Lord High Chancellor, and the like of those; which makes it  tantamount to nothing, being a man is answerable to nobody by the right of Magna  Charta: except in cases of treason, felony, and that. But as to a beggar, it's  quite another thing; a beggar comes and asks me for money; but what has a beggar to shew  for it? what does a beggar bring me in exchange? why a long story that a beggar i'n't worth  a penny! what's that to me? nothing at all. Let every man have every man own; that's  my way of arguing." "Ungentle mortals!" cried Mr Albany, "in wealth exulting; even in inhumanity!  think you these wretched outcasts have less sensibility than yourselves? think  you, in cold and hunger, they lose those feelings which even in voluptuous  prosperity from time to time disturb you? you say they are all cheats? 'tis but  the niggard cant of avarice, to lure away remorse from obduracy. Think you the  naked wanderer begs from choice? give a beggar your wealth and try." "Give a beggar a whip!" cried Mr Briggs, "sha'n't have a souse! send a beggar to Bridewell!  nothing but a pauper; hate 'em; hate 'em all! full of tricks; break their own  legs, put out their arms, cut off their fingers, snap their own ancles,—all  for what? to get at the chink! to chouse us of cash! ought to be well flogged;  have 'em all sent to the Thames; worse than the Convicts." "Poor subterfuge of callous cruelty! you cheat yourselves, to shun the fraud of  others! and yet, how better do you use the wealth so guarded? what nobler  purpose can it answer to you, than even a chance to snatch some wretch from  sinking? think less how much ye save, and more for what; and then consider how  thy full coffers may hereafter make reparation, for the empty catalogue of thy  virtues." "Anan!" said Mr Briggs, again lost in perplexity and wonder. "Oh yet," continued Mr Albany, turning towards Cecilia, "preach not here the  hardness which ye practice; rather amend yourselves than corrupt Cecilia; and give  with liberality what ye ought to receive with gratitude!" "This is not my doctrine," cried Mr Hobson; "I am not a near man, neither, but as  to giving at that rate, it's quite out of his character. I have as good a right to  my own savings, as to my own gettings; and what I say is this, who'll give to  me? let me see that, and it's quite another thing: and begin who will, I'll be  bound to go on with Mr Hobson, pound for pound, or pence for pence. But as to giving  to them beggars, it's what I don't approve; I pay the poor's rate, and that's  what I call charity enough for any man. But for the matter of living well, and  spending one's money handsomely, and having one's comforts about one, why it's  a thing of another nature, and I can say this for myself, and that is, I never  grudged myself any thing in my life. I always made myself agreeable, and lived  on the best. That's my way." "Bad way too," cried Mr Briggs, "never get on with it, never see beyond your nose;  won't be worth a plum while your head wags!" then, taking Cecilia apart,  "hark'ee, my duck," "hark'ee added, pointing to Mr Albany, "who is that Mr Bounce, eh?  what is "hark'ee?" "I have known "hark'ee but a short time, Sir; but I think of "hark'ee very highly." "Is "hark'ee a good man? that's the point, is "hark'ee a good man?" "Indeed "hark'ee appears to myself uncommonly benevolent and charitable." "But that i'n't the thing; is "hark'ee warm? that's the point, is "hark'ee warm?" "If you mean passionate," said Cecilia, "I believe the energy of "hark'ee manner is  merely to enforce what "hark'ee says." "Don't take me, don't take me," cried "hark'ee, impatiently; "can come down with the  ready, that's the matter; can chink the little gold boys? eh?" "Why I rather fear not by "hark'ee appearance; but I know nothing of "hark'ee affairs." "What does come for? eh? come a courting?" "Mercy on myself, no!" "What for then? only a spunging?" "No, indeed. He seems to have no wish but to assist and plead for others." "All fudge! think He i'n't touched? ay, ay; nothing but a trick! only to get at  the chink: see He's as poor as a rat, talks of nothing but giving money; a bad  sign! if He'd got any, would not do it. Wanted to make us come down; warrant  thought to bam us all! out there! a'n't so soon gulled." A knock at the street door gave now a new interruption, and Mr Delvile at  length appeared. Cecilia, whom He sight could not fail to disconcert, felt doubly distressed by  the unnecessary presence of Mr Albany and Mr Hobson; Cecilia regretted the absence of Mr  Monckton, who could easily have taken them away; for though without scruple Cecilia  could Cecilia have acquainted Mr Hobson Cecilia had business, Cecilia dreaded offending  Albany, whose esteem Cecilia was ambitious of obtaining. Mr Delvile entered the room with an air stately and erect; Mr Delvile took off Mr Delvile hat,  but deigned not to make the smallest inclination of Mr Delvile head, nor offered any  excuse to Mr Briggs for being past the hour of Mr Delvile appointment: but having  advanced a few paces, without looking either to the right or left, said, "as I  have never acted, my coming may not, perhaps, be essential; but as my name is  in the Dean's Will, and I have once or twice met the other executors mentioned  in it, I think it a duty I owe to my own heirs to prevent any possible future  enquiry or trouble to my own heirs." This speech was directly addressed to no one, though meant to be attended to by  every one, and seemed proudly uttered as a mere apology to himself for not  having declined the meeting. Cecilia, though Cecilia recovered from Cecilia confusion by the help of Cecilia aversion to  this self-sufficiency, made not any answer. Mr Albany retired to a corner of the  room; Mr Hobson began to believe it was time for Mr Hobson to depart; and Mr Briggs  thinking only of the quarrel in which Mr Hobson had separated with Mr Delvile in the  summer, stood swelling with venom, which Mr Hobson longed for an opportunity to spit  out. Mr Delvile, who regarded this silence as the effect of Mr Hobson awe-inspiring  presence, became rather more complacent; but casting Mr Hobson eyes round the room,  and perceiving the two strangers, Mr Hobson was visibly surprised, and looking at  Cecilia for some explanation, seemed to stand suspended from the purpose of Mr Hobson  visit till Mr Hobson heard one. Cecilia, earnest to have the business concluded, turned to Mr Briggs, and said,  "Sir, here is pen and ink: are you to write, or am I? or what is to be done?" "No, no," said Sir, with a sneer, "give it t'other; all in our turn; don't come  before Sir Grace the Right Honourable Mr Vampus." "Before whom, Sir?" said Mr Delvile, reddening. "Before my Lord Don Pedigree," answered Mr Briggs, with a spiteful grin, "know  my Lord Don Pedigree? eh? ever hear of such a person?" Mr Delvile coloured still deeper, but turning contemptuously from my Lord Don Pedigree,  disdained making any reply. Mr Briggs, who now regarded my Lord Don Pedigree as a defeated man, said exultingly to Mr  Mr Hobson, "what do stand here for?—hay?—fall o' your marrowbones; don't see  'Squire High and Mighty?" "As to falling on my marrowbones," answered Mr Hobson, "it's what I shall do to  no man, except Mr Hobson was the King himself, or the like of that, and going to make  me Chancellor of the Exchequer, or Commissioner of Excise. Not that I mean the  gentleman any offence; but a man's a man, and for one man to worship another is  quite out of law." "Must, must!" cried Mr Briggs, "tell all his old grand-dads else: keeps 'em in a  roll; locks 'em in a closet; says " cried Briggs, "tell all his old grand-dads else: keeps 'em in a  roll; locks 'em in a closet" cried Briggs, "tell all his old grand-dads else: keeps 'em in a  roll; locks 'em in a closet; can't live without " cried Briggs, "tell all his old grand-dads else: keeps 'em in a  roll; locks 'em in a closet:  likes " cried Briggs, "tell all his old grand-dads else: keeps 'em in a  roll; locks 'em in a closet better than cash!—wish had 'em here! pop 'em all in the sink!" "If your intention, Sir," cried Mr Delvile, fiercely, "is only to insult me, I  am prepared for what measures I shall take. I declined seeing you in my own  house, that I might not be under the same restraint as when it was my  unfortunate lot to meet you last." "Who cares?" cried Mr Briggs, with an air of defiance, "what can do, eh? poke me  into a family vault? bind me o' top of an old monument? tie me to a stinking  carcase? make a corpse of me, and call a stinking  carcase one of your famous cousins?—" "For heaven's sake, Mr Briggs," interrupted Cecilia, who saw that Mr Delvile,  trembling with passion, scarce refrained lifting up " "For heaven's sake, Mr Briggs," interrupted Cecilia, who saw that Mr Delvile,   stick, "be appeased,  and let us finish us business!" Mr Albany now, hearing in Cecilia's voice the alarm with which Cecilia was seized,  came forward and exclaimed, "Whence this unmeaning dissension? to what purpose  this irritating abuse? Oh vain and foolish! live ye so happily, last ye so  long, that time and peace may thus be trifled with?" "There, there!" cried Mr Briggs, holding up Mr Briggs finger at Mr Delvile, "have it  now! got old Mr Bounce upon Mr Delvile! give you enough of it; promise you that!" "Restrain," continued Mr Albany, "this idle wrath; and if ye have ardent passions,  employ "Restrain," continued Albany, "this idle wrath; and if ye have ardent passions to nobler uses; let "Restrain," continued Albany, "this idle wrath; and if ye have ardent passions stimulate acts of virtue, let "Restrain," continued Albany, "this idle wrath; and if ye have ardent passions animate  deeds of beneficence! Oh waste not spirits that may urge you to good, lead you  to honour, warm you to charity, in poor and angry words, in unfriendly, unmanly  debate!" Mr Delvile, who from the approach of Mr Albany, had given him him whole attention,  was struck with astonishment at this address, and almost petrified with wonder  at him language and exhortations. "Why I must own," said Mr Hobson, "as to this matter I am much of the same mind  Mr Hobson; for quarreling's a thing I don't uphold; being it advances one no way;  for what I say is this, if a man gets the better, a man's only where a man was  before, and if a man gets worsted, why it's odds but the laugh's against a man: so,  if I may make bold to give my verdict, I would have one of these gentlemen take  the other by the hand, and so put an end to bad words. That's my maxim, and  that's what I call being agreeable." Mr Delvile, at the words one of these gentlemen take the other by the hand,  looked scornfully upon Mr Hobson, with a frown that expressed Mr Hobson highest  indignation, at being thus familiarly coupled with Mr Briggs. And then, turning  from Mr Hobson to Cecilia, haughtily said, "Are these two persons," pointing towards  Albany and Hobson, "waiting here to be witnesses to any transaction?" "No, Sir, no," cried Mr Hobson, "I don't mean to intrude, I am going directly. So  you can give me no insight, ma'am," addressing Cecilia, "as to where I might  light upon Mr Belfield?" "Me? no!" cried Cecilia, much provoked by observing that Mr Delvile suddenly looked  at Cecilia. "Well, ma'am, well, I mean no harm: only I hold it that the right way to hear  of a young gentleman, is to ask for a young gentleman of a young lady: that's my maxim. Come,  Sir," to Mr Briggs, "you and I had like to have fallen out, but what I say is  this; let no man bear malice; that's my way: so I hope we part without ill  blood?" "Ay, ay;" said Mr Briggs, giving Mr Briggs a nod. "Well, then," added Mr Hobson, "I hope the good-will may go round, and that not  only you and I, but these two good old gentlemen will also lend a hand." Mr Delvile now was at a loss which way to turn for very rage; but after looking  at every one with a face flaming with ire, Mr Delvile said to Cecilia, "If you have  collected together these persons for the purpose of affronting me, I must beg  you to remember I am not one to be affronted with impunity!" Cecilia, half frightened, was beginning an answer that disclaimed any such  intention, when Mr Albany, with the most indignant energy, called out, "Oh pride  of heart, with littleness of soul! check this vile arrogance, too vain for man,  and spare to others some part of that lenity thou nourishest for thyself, or  justly bestow on thyself that contempt thou nourishest for others!" And with these words Mr Delvile sternly left my own  house. Mr Delvile Mr Delvile began now to fancy that all the demons of torment  were designedly let loose upon Mr Delvile, and Mr Delvile surprise and resentment operated so  powerfully that it was only in broken sentences Mr Delvile could express either. "Very  extraordinary!—a new method of conduct!—liberties to which I am not much  used!—impertinences I shall not hastily forget,—treatment that would scarce  be pardonable to a person wholly unknown!—" "Why indeed, Sir," said Mr Hobson, "I can't but say it was rather a cut up; but  the old gentleman is what one may call a genius, which makes it a little  excusable; for Mr Hobson does things all Mr Hobson own way, and I am told it's the same  thing who Mr Hobson speaks to, so Mr Hobson can but find fault, and that." "Sir," interrupted the still more highly offended Mr Delvile, "what you may be  told is extremely immaterial to Sir; and I must take the liberty to hint to you,  a conversation of this easy kind is not what I am much in practice in hearing." "Sir, I ask pardon," said Mr Hobson, "I meant nothing but what was agreeable;  however, I have done, and I wish you good day. Your humble servant, ma'am, and  I hope, Sir," to Mr Briggs, "you won't begin bad words again?" "No, no," said Mr Briggs, "ready to make up; all at end; only don't much like  Spain, that's all!" winking significantly, "nor a'n't over fond of a skeleton!" Mr Hobson now retired; and Mr Delvile and Mr Briggs, being both wearied and  both in haste to have done, settled in about five minutes all for which they  met, after passing more than an hour in agreeing what that was. Mr Briggs then, saying Mr Briggs had an engagement upon business, declined settling  Mr Briggs own accounts till another time, but promised to see Cecilia again soon, and  added, "be sure take care of that old Mr Bounce! cracked in the noddle; see  that with half an eye! better not trust Mr Briggs! break out some day: do you a  mischief!" Mr Briggs then went away: but while the parlour-door was still open, to the no little  surprise of Cecilia, the servant announced Mr Belfield. Mr Briggs hardly entered the  room, and Mr Briggs countenance spoke haste and eagerness. "I have this moment,  madam," Mr Briggs said, "been informed a complaint has been lodged against Mr Briggs here,  and I could not rest till I had the honour of assuring you, that though I have  been rather dilatory, I have not neglected my appointment, nor has the  condescension of your interference been thrown away." Mr Briggs then bowed, shut the parlour-door, and ran off Cecilia, though happy to understand  by This speech that Mr Briggs was actually restored to Mr Briggs family, was sorry at these  repeated intrusions in the presence of Mr Delvile, who was now the only one  that remained. Cecilia expected every instant that Mr Briggs would ring for Mr Briggs chair, which Mr Briggs kept in  waiting; but, after a pause of some continuance, to Cecilia equal surprise and  disturbance, Mr Briggs made This speech. "As it is probable I am now for the  last time alone with you, ma'am, and as it is certain we shall meet no more  upon business, I cannot, in justice to my own character, and to the respect I  retain for the memory of the Dean, your uncle, take a final leave of the office  with which he was pleased to invest me, without first fulfilling my own ideas  of the duty it requires from me, by giving you some counsel relating to your  future establishment." This was not a preface much to enliven Cecilia; a preface prepared Cecilia for such  speeches as Cecilia was least willing to hear, and gave to Cecilia the mixt and painful  sensation of spirits depressed, with ride alarmed. "My numerous engagements," he continued, "and the appropriation of my time,  already settled, to My numerous engagements," he continued, "and the appropriation of my time various claims, must make me brief in what I have to  represent, and somewhat, perhaps, abrupt in coming to the purpose. But that you  will excuse." Cecilia disdained to humour this arrogance by any compliments or concessions:  Cecilia was silent, therefore; and when they were both seated, he went on. "You are now at a time of life when it is natural for young women to wish for  some connection: and the largeness of your fortune will remove from you such  difficulties as prove bars to the pretensions, in this expensive age, of those  who possess not such advantages. It would have been some pleasure to me, while  I yet considered you as my Ward, to have seen you properly disposed of: but as  that time is past, I can only give you some general advice, which you may  follow or neglect as you think fit. By giving it, I shall satisfy me; for  the rest, I am not responsible." me paused; but Cecilia felt less and less inclination to make use of the  opportunity by speaking in Cecilia turn. "Yet though, as I just now hinted, young women of large fortunes may have  little trouble in finding young women of large fortunes establishments, young women of large fortunes ought not, therefore,  to trifle when proper ones are in young women of large fortunes power, nor to suppose young women of large fortunes equal  to any young women of large fortunes may chance to desire." Cecilia coloured high at this pointed reprehension; but feeling Cecilia disgust  every moment encrease, determined to sustain Cecilia with dignity, and at least  not suffer her disgust   to perceive the triumph of her disgust   ostentation and rudeness. "The proposals," her disgust   continued, "of the Earl of Ernolf had always my  approbation; it was certainly an ill-judged thing to neglect such an  opportunity of being honourably settled. The clause of the name was, to her disgust  ,  immaterial; since her disgust   own name half a century ago was unheard of, and since her disgust    is her disgust   only known by her disgust   title. her disgust   is still, however, I have authority to  acquaint you, perfectly well disposed to renew her disgust   application to you." "I am sorry, Sir," said Cecilia coldly, "to hear it." "You have, perhaps, some other better offer in view?" "No, Sir," cried Cecilia, with spirit, "nor even in desire." "Am I, then, to infer that some inferior offer has more chance of your  approbation?" "There is no reason, Sir, to infer any thing; I am content with my actual  situation, and have, at present, neither prospect nor intention of changing it." "I perceive, but without surprise, your unwillingness to discuss the subject;  nor do I mean to press the subject: I shall merely offer to your consideration one  caution, and then relieve you from my presence. Young women of ample fortunes,  who are early independent, are sometimes apt to presume Young women of ample fortunes,  who are early independent may do every thing  with impunity; but Young women of ample fortunes,  who are early independent are mistaken; Young women of ample fortunes,  who are early independent are as liable to censure as those  who are wholly unprovided for." "I hope, Sir," said Cecilia, staring, "this at least is a caution rather drawn  from my situation than my behaviour?" "I mean not, ma'am, narrowly to go into, or investigate the subject; what I  have said you may make your own use of; I have only to observe further, that  when young women, at your time of life, are at all negligent of so nice a thing  as reputation, young women commonly live to repent that  ." He then arose to go, but Cecilia, not more offended than amazed, said, "I must  beg, Sir, you will explain Sir!" "Certainly this matter," He answered, "must be immaterial to He: yet, as I have  once been your guardian by the nomination of the Dean your uncle, I cannot  forbear making an effort towards preventing any indiscretion: and frequent  visits to a young man—" "Good God! Sir," interrupted Cecilia, "what is it you mean?" "It can certainly, as I said before, be nothing to He, though I should be glad  to see you in better hands: but I cannot suppose you have been led to take such  steps without some serious plan; and I would advise you, without loss of time,  to think better of what you are about." "Should I think, Sir, to eternity," cried Cecilia, "I could never conjecture  what you mean!" "You may not chuse," said he, proudly, "to understand me; but I have done. If    had been in my power to have interfered in your service with my Lord  Derford, notwithstanding my reluctance to being involved in any fresh  employment, I should have made a point of not refusing  : but this young man  is nobody,—a very imprudent connection—" "What young man, Sir?" "Nay, I know nothing of this young man  ! it is by no means likely I should: but as I had  already been informed of your attention to this young man  , the corroborating incidents of  my servant's following you to my servant house, my servant friend's seeking my servant at yours, and  my servant own waiting upon you this morning; were not well calculated to make me  withdraw my credence to this morning." "Is this morning, then, Mr Belfield, Sir, concerning whom you draw these inferences, from  circumstances the most accidental and unmeaning?" "It is by no means my practice," cried he, haughtily, and with evident marks of  high displeasure at This speech, "to believe any thing lightly, or without even  unquestionable authority; what once, therefore, I have credited, I do not often  find erroneous. Mistake not, however, what I have said into supposing I have  any objection to your marrying; on the contrary, it had been for the honour of  my family had you been married a year ago I should not then have suffered the  degradation of seeing a son of the first expectations in the kingdom upon the  point of renouncing a son of the first expectations in the kingdom birth, nor a woman of the first distinction ruined in  her health, and broken for ever in her constitution." The emotions of Cecilia at This speech were too powerful for concealment; her  colour varied, now reddening with indignation, now turning pale with  apprehension; her arose, her trembled and sat down, her arose again, but not  knowing what to say or what to do, again sat down. Mr Delvile then, making a stiff bow, wished her good morning. "Go not so, Sir!" cried her, in faltering accents; "let me at least convince  you of the mistake with regard to Mr Belfield—" "My mistakes, ma'am," said Mr Belfield—, with a contemptuous smile, "are perhaps not  easily convicted: and I may possibly labour under others that would give you no  less trouble: it may therefore be better to avoid any further disquisition." "No, not better," answered her, again recovering her courage from this fresh  provocation; "I fear no disquisition; on the contrary, it is my interest to  solicit one." "This intrepidity in a young woman," said This intrepidity in a young woman, ironically, "is certainly very  commendable; and doubtless, as you are your own mistress, your having run out  great part of your fortune, is nothing beyond what you have a right to do." "Me!" cried Cecilia, astonished, "run out great part of my fortune!" "Perhaps that is another mistake! I have not often been so unfortunate; and you  are not, then, in debt?" "In debt, Sir?" "Nay, I have no intention to inquire into your affairs. Good morning to you,  ma'am." "I beg, I entreat, Sir, that you will stop!—make me, at least, understand  what you mean, whether you deign to hear my justification or not." "O, I am mistaken, it seems! misinformed, deceived; and you have neither spent  more than you have received, nor taken up money of Jews? your minority has been  clear of debts? and your fortune, now you are of age, will be free from  incumbrances?" Cecilia, who now began to understand him, eagerly answered, "do you mean, Sir,  the money which I took up last spring?" "O no; by no means, I conceive the whole to be a mistake!" And him went to the parlour-door. "Hear me but a moment, Sir!" cried Cecilia hastily, following him; "since you know  of that transaction, do not refuse to listen to " occasion; I took up the  money for Mr Harrel; it was all, and solely for Mr Harrel." "For Mr Harrel, was it?" said Mr Harrel, with an air of supercilious incredulity;  "that was rather an unlucky step. Your servant, ma'am." And Mr Harrel opened the parlour-door. "You will not hear me, then? you will not credit me?" cried Cecilia in the  cruellest agitation. "Some other time, ma'am; at present my avocations are too numerous to permit  me." And again, stiffly bowing, Mr Harrel called to Mr Harrel servants, who were waiting in the  hall, and put Mr Harrel into Mr Harrel chair.
