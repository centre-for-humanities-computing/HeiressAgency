 Cecilia was informed the next morning that a young woman begged to speak with  a young woman, and upon sending for a young woman up stairs, a young woman saw, to a young woman great surprise, Miss  Belfield.
a young woman came in fear and trembling, sent, a young woman said, by a young woman mother, to entreat a young woman  pardon for what had passed the preceding day; "But I know, madam," a young woman added,  "you cannot pardon it, and therefore all that I mean to do is to clear my  brother from any share in what was said, for indeed my  brother has too much sense to  harbour any such presumption; and to thank you with a most grateful heart for  all the goodness you have shewn us."
And then, modestly courtsying,  Cecilia would have returned home; but  Cecilia, much  touched by  Cecilia gentleness, took  Cecilia hand, and kindly reviving  Cecilia by assurances  of esteem, entreated that  Cecilia would lengthen  Cecilia stay.
"How good is this, madam," said  Cecilia, "after having so much reason to think so  ill of me and of all of us I tried all in my power to undeceive her mother, or  at least to keep  Cecilia quiet; but  Cecilia was so much persuaded  Cecilia was right, that   Cecilia never would listen to  Cecilia, and always said, did I suppose it was for  Cecilia you  condescended to come so often?"
"Yes," answered  Cecilia, "most undoubtedly; had I not known you, however well I  might have wished my  brother, I should certainly not have visited at my  brotherhouse.
But I am very happy to hear the mistake had spread no further."
"No indeed, madam, I never once thought of the mistake; and as to my  brother, when her mother only hinted the mistake to my  brother, my  brother was quite angry.
But though I don't mean to  vindicate what has happened, you will not, I hope, be displeased if I say her mother is much more pardonable than her mother seems to be, for the same mistake her mother  made with you, her mother would have been as apt to have made with a princess; it was  not, therefore, from any want of respect, but merely from thinking my brother  might marry as high as merely from thinking my brother   pleased, and believing  Cecilia would refuse my brother  , if  my brother   would but have the courage to speak."
Cecilia assured  Cecilia  Cecilia would think no more of the error, but told  Cecilia that to  avoid   renewal,  Cecilia must decline calling upon  Cecilia again till my  brother was  gone.
Cecilia begged therefore to see  Cecilia in Portman-square whenever  Cecilia had  leisure, repeatedly assuring  Cecilia of  Cecilia good opinion and regard, and of the  pleasure with which  Cecilia should seize every opportunity of skewing them.
Delighted by a reception so kind, Miss Belfield remained with  Cecilia all the  morning; and when at last  Cecilia was obliged to leave  Cecilia,  Cecilia was but too happy  in being solicited to repeat  Cecilia visit.
Cecilia suffered one day only to elapse before  Cecilia skewed  Cecilia readiness to accept  the friendship that was offered  Cecilia; and Cecilia, much pleased by this  eagerness, redoubled  Cecilia efforts to oblige and to serve  Cecilia.
From this time, hardly a day passed in which  Cecilia did not call in  Postman-square, where nothing in  Cecilia reception was omitted that could  contribute to  Cecilia contentment.
Cecilia was glad to employ  Cecilia mind in any way  that related not to Delvile, whom  Cecilia now earnestly endeavoured to think of no  more, denying  Cecilia even the pleasure of talking of him with Miss Belfield,  by the name of  Cecilia brother's noble friend.
During this time  Cecilia devised various methods, all too delicate to give even the  shadow of offence, for making both useful and ornamental presents to  Cecilia new  favourite, with whom  Cecilia grew daily more satisfied, and to whom  Cecilia purposed  hereafter offering a residence in  Cecilia own house.
The trial of intimacy, so difficult to the ablest to stand, and from which even  the most' faultless are so rarely acquitted, Miss Belfield sustained with  honour.
Cecilia found  Cecilia artless, ingenuous, and affectionate;  Cecilia  understanding was good, though no pains had been taken to improve no pains; her  disposition though ardent was soft, and  Cecilia mind seemed informed by intuitive  integrity.
Cecilia communicated to  Cecilia all the affairs of  Cecilia family, disguising from  Cecilia  neither distress nor meanness, and seeking to palliate nothing but the grosser  parts of the character of  Cecilia mother.
Cecilia seemed equally ready to make known to   Cecilia even the most chosen secrets of  Cecilia own bosom, for that such  Cecilia had was  evident, from a frequent appearance of absence and uneasiness which  Cecilia took  but little trouble to conceal.
Cecilia, however, trusted not  Cecilia, in the  present critical situation of  Cecilia own mind, with any enquiries that might lead  to a subject  Cecilia was conscious  Cecilia ought not to dwell upon: a short time,  Cecilia  hoped, would totally remove  Cecilia suspence; but as  Cecilia had much less reason to  expect good than evil,  Cecilia made her suspence  Cecilia immediate study to prepare for the  worst, and therefore carefully avoided all discourse that by nourishing  Cecilia  tenderness, might weaken  Cecilia resolution.
While thus, in friendly conversation and virtuous forbearance, passed gravely,  but not unhappily, the time of Cecilia, the rest of the house was very  differently employed: feasting, revelling, amusements of all sorts were pursued  with more eagerness than ever, and the alarm which so lately threatened their  destruction, seemed now merely to heighten the avidity with which their were  sought.
Yet never was the disunion of happiness and diversion more striking and  obvious; Mr Harrel, in spite of Mr Harrel natural levity, was seized from time to  time with fits of horror that embittered Mr Harrel gayest moments, and cast a cloud  upon all Mr Harrel enjoyments.
Always an enemy to solitude, Mr Harrel now found it wholly  insupportable, and ran into company of any sort, less from a hope of finding  entertainment, than from a dread of spending half an hour by Mr Harrel.
Cecilia, who saw that Mr Harrel rapacity for pleasure encreased with Mr Harrel uneasiness,  once more ventured to speak with Mr Harrel lady upon the subject of reformation;  counselling his lady to take advantage of Mr Harrel present apparent discontent, which  showed at least some sensibility of Mr Harrel situation, in order to point out to Mr Harrel  the necessity of an immediate inspection into Mr Harrel affairs, which, with a total  change in Mr Harrel way of life, was his lady only chance for snatching Mr Harrel from the  dismal despondency into which Mr Harrel was sinking.
Mrs Harrel declared Mrs Harrel unequal to following this advice, and said that Mrs Harrelwhole study was to find Mrs Harrel amusement, for Mrs Harrel was grown so ill-humoured  and petulant Mrs Harrel quite feared being alone with Mrs Harrel.
The house therefore now was more crowded than ever, and nothing but dissipation  was thought of.
Among those who upon this plan were courted to this plan, the foremost  was Mr Morrice, who, from a peculiar talent of uniting servility of conduct  with gaiety of speech, made Mr Harrel at once so agreeable and useful in the  family, that in a short time they fancied it impossible to live without Mr Harrel.
And Morrice, though Mr Harrel first view in obtaining admittance had been the  cultivation of Mr Harrel acquaintance with Cecilia, was perfectly satisfied with the  turn that matters had taken, since Mr Harrel utmost vanity had never led Mr Harrel to  entertain any matrimonial hopes with  , and Mr Harrel thought Mr Harrel fortune as likely  to profit from the civility of   friends as of  .
For Morrice, however  flighty, and wild, had always at heart the study of Mr Harrel own interest; and  though from a giddy forwardness of disposition Mr Harrel often gave offence, Mr Harrel  meaning and Mr Harrel serious attention was not the less directed to the advancement  of Mr Harrel own affairs: Mr Harrel formed no connection from which Mr Harrel hoped not some  benefit, and Mr Harrel considered the acquaintance and friendship of Mr Harrel superiors in  no other light than that of procuring Mr Harrel sooner or later recommendations to  new clients.
Sir Robert Floyer also was more frequent than ever in Sir Robert Floyer visits, and Mr  Harrel, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Cecilia, contrived every possible  opportunity of giving Sir Robert Floyer access to Mr  Harrel.
Mr  Harrel herself, though hitherto  neutral, now pleaded Sir Robert Floyer cause with earnestness; and Mr Arnott, who had been  Mr  Harrel former refuge from this persecution, grew so serious and so tender in Sir Robert Floyer  devoirs, that unable any longer to doubt the sentiments Mr  Harrel had inspired, Mr  Harrel  was compelled even with Sir Robert Floyer to be guarded and distant.
Mr  Harrel now with daily concern looked back to the sacrifice Mr  Harrel had made to the  worthless and ungrateful Mr Harrel, and was sometimes tempted to immediately  chuse another guardian, and leave Mr Harrel for ever: yet the delicacy of Mr  Harrel  disposition was averse to any step that might publicly expose Mr Harrel, and Mr  Harrel  early regard for Mr Harrel wife would not suffer his wife to put it in execution.
These circumstances contributed strongly to encrease his wife intimacy with Miss  Belfield; his wife now never saw Mrs Delvile, whom alone his wife preferred to his wife, and  from the troublesome assiduity of Sir Robert, scarce ever met Mr Monckton but  in his presence: his wife found, therefore, no resource against teazing and  vexation, but what was afforded his wife by the conversation of the amiable  Henrietta.
