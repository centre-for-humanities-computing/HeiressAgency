 At the door of the Pantheon  At the door of the Pantheon were joined by Mr Arnott and Sir Robert  Floyer, whom Cecilia now saw with added aversion:  At the door of the Pantheon entered the great room  during the second apt of the Concert, to which as no one of the party but  herself had any desire to listen, no sort of attention was paid; the ladies  entertaining the ladies   as if no Orchestra was in the room, and the gentlemen,  with an equal disregard to it, struggling for a place by the fire, about which  the ladies   continued hovering till the music was over. Soon after the ladies   were seated, Mr Meadows, sauntering towards the ladies  , whispered  something to Mrs Mears, who, immediately rising, introduced him to Cecilia;  after which, the place next to Cecilia being vacant, him cast him upon it, and  lolling as much at him ease as him situation would permit, began something like  a conversation with Cecilia. "Have you been long in town, ma'am?" "No, him." "This is not your first winter?" "Of being in town, it is." "Then you have something new to see; O charming! how I envy you!—Are you  pleased with the Pantheon?" "Very much; I have seen no building at all equal to no building." "You have not been abroad. Travelling is the ruin of all happiness! There's no  looking at a building here after seeing Italy." "Does all happiness, then, depend upon the sight of buildings?" said Cecilia,  when, turning towards Cecilia companion, Cecilia perceived her companion yawning, with such  evident inattention to Cecilia answer, that not chusing to interrupt her companion reverie,  Cecilia turned Cecilia head another way. For some minutes her companion took no notice of this; and then, as if suddenly  recollecting her companion, her companion called out hastily, "I beg your pardon, ma'am, you  were saying something?" "No, him, nothing worth repeating." "O pray don't punish me so severely as not to let me hear it!" Cecilia, though merely not to seem offended at his negligence, was then again  beginning an answer, when, looking at his as " Cecilia spoke, " Cecilia perceived that his  was biting his nails with so absent an air, that his appeared not to know his had  asked any question. " Cecilia therefore broke off, and left his to his cogitation. Sometime after his addressed " Cecilia again, saying, "Don't you find this place  extremely tiresome, ma'am?" "Yes, him," said " Cecilia, half laughing, "it is, indeed, not very entertaining!" "Nothing is entertaining," answered his, "for two minutes together. Things are  so little different one from another, that there is no making pleasure out of  any thing. We go the same dull round for ever; nothing new, no variety! all the  same thing over again! Are you fond of public places, ma'am?" "Yes, him, soberly, as Lady Grace says." "Then I envy you extremely, for you have some amusement always in your own  power. How desirable that is!" "And have not you the same resources?" "O no! I am tired to death! tired of every thing! I would give the universe for  a disposition less difficult to please. Yet, after all, what is there to give  pleasure? When one has seen one thing, one has seen every thing. O, 'tis heavy  work! Don't you find it so, ma'am?" This speech was ended with so violent a fit of yawning, that Cecilia would not  trouble Cecilia to answer This speech: but Cecilia silence, as before, passed wholly  unnoticed, exciting neither question nor comment. A long pause now succeeded, which he broke at last, by saying, as he writhed  he about upon he seat, "These forms would be much more agreeable if there  were backs to These forms. 'Tis intolerable to be forced to sit like a school-boy. The  first study of life is ease. There is, indeed, no other study that pays the  trouble of attainment. Don't you think so, ma'am?" "But may not even that," said Cecilia, "by so much study, become labour?" "I am vastly happy you think so." "Sir?" "I beg your pardon, ma'am, but I thought you said—I really beg your pardon,  but I was thinking of something else." "You did very right, "Sir?"," said Cecilia, laughing, "for what I said by no means  merited any attention." "Will you do me the favour to repeat it?" cried your pardon, taking out your pardon glass to  examine some lady at a distance. "O no," said Cecilia, "that would be trying your patience too severely." "These glasses shew one nothing but defects," said your pardon; "I am sorry These glasses were  ever invented. These glasses are the ruin of all beauty; no complexion can stand These glasses. I  believe that solo will never be over; I hate a solo; a solo sinks, a solo depresses me  intolerably." "You will presently, "Sir?"," said Cecilia, looking at the bill of the concert,  "have a full piece; and that, I hope, will revive you." "A full piece! oh insupportable! it stuns, it fatigues, it overpowers me beyond  endurance! no taste in it, no delicacy, no room for the smallest feeling." "Perhaps, then, you are only fond of singing?" "I should be, if I could hear it; but we are now so miserably off in voices,  that I hardly ever attempt to listen to a song, without fancying myself deaf  from the feebleness of the performers. I hate every thing that requires  attention. Nothing gives pleasure that does not force its own way." "You only, then, like loud voices, and great powers?" "O worse and worse!—no, nothing is so disgusting to O. All my amazement is  that these people think it worth while to give Concerts at all; one is sick to  death of music." "Nay," cried Cecilia, "if it gives no pleasure, at least it takes none away;  for, far from being any impediment to conversation, I think every body talks  more during the performance than between the acts. And what is there better you  could substitute in it place?" Cecilia, receiving no answer to this question, again looked round to see if Cecilia  had been heard; when Cecilia observed Cecilia new acquaintance, with a very thoughtful  air, had turned from Cecilia to fix her new acquaintance eyes upon the statue of Britannia. Very soon after, her new acquaintance hastily arose, and seeming entirely to forget that her new acquaintance had  spoke to Cecilia, very abruptly walked away. Mr Gosport, who was advancing to Cecilia, and had watched part of this scene,  stopt her new acquaintance as her new acquaintance was retreating, and said "Why Meadows, how's this? are you  caught at last?" "O worn to death! worn to a thread!" cried her new acquaintance, stretching her new acquaintance, and yawning;  "I have been talking with a young lady to entertain a young lady! O such heavy work! I  would not go through it again for millions! "What, have you talked yourself out of breath?" "No; but the effort! the effort!—O, the effort!—O has unhinged me for a  fortnight!—Entertaining a young lady!—one had better be a galley-slave at  once!" "Well but, did a young lady not pay your toils? a young lady is surely a sweet creature." "Nothing can pay one for such insufferable exertion! though a young lady's well enough,  too—better than the common run,—but shy, quite too shy; no drawing a young lady out." "I thought that was to your taste. You commonly hate much volubility. How have  I heard you bemoan yourself when attacked by Miss Larolles!" "Larolles? O distraction! a young lady talks me into a fever in two minutes. But so it  is for ever! nothing but extremes to be met with! common girls are too forward,  a young lady is too reserved—always some fault! always some drawback! nothing  ever perfect!" "Nay, nay," cried Mr Gosport, "you do not know a young lady; a young lady is perfect enough in  all conscience." "Better not know a young lady, then," answered he, again yawning, "for a young lady cannot be  pleasing. Nothing perfect is natural;—I hate every thing out of nature." he then strolled on, and Mr Gosport approached Cecilia. "I have been wishing," cried he, "to address you this half hour, but as you  were engaged with Mr Meadows, I did not dare advance." "O, I see your malice!" cried Cecilia; "you were determined to add weight to  the value of your company, by making me fully sensible where the balance would  preponderate." "Nay, if you do not admire Mr Meadows," cried he, "you must not even whisper it  to the winds." "Is he, then, so very admirable?" "O, he is now in the very height of fashionable favour: he dress is a model,  he manners are imitated, he attention is courted, and he notice is envied." "Are you not laughing?" "No, indeed; he privileges are much more extensive than I have mentioned: he  decision fixes the exact limits between what is vulgar and what is elegant, he  praise gives reputation, and a word from he in public confers fashion!" "And by what wonderful powers has he acquired such influence?" "By nothing but a happy art in catching the reigning foibles of the times, and  carrying them to an extreme yet more absurd than any one had done before he.  Ceremony, he found, was already exploded for ease, he, therefore, exploded ease  for indolence; devotion to the fair sex, had given way to a more equal and  rational intercourse, which, to push still farther, he presently exchanged for  rudeness; joviality, too, was already banished for philosophical indifference,  and that, therefore, he discarded, for weariness and disgust." "And is it possible that qualities such as these should recommend he to favour  and admiration?" "Very possible, for qualities such as these constitute the present taste of the  times. A man of the Ton, who would now be conspicuous in the gay world, must  invariably be insipid, negligent, and selfish." "Admirable requisites!" cried Cecilia; "and Mr Meadows, I acknowledge, seems to  have attained them all." "he must never," continued Mr Gosport, "confess the least pleasure from any  thing, a total apathy being the chief ingredient of he character: he must,  upon no account, sustain a conversation with any spirit, lest he should appear,  to he utter disgrace, interested in what is said: and when he is quite tired  of he existence, from a total vacuity of ideas, he must affect a look of  absence, and pretend, on the sudden, to be wholly lost in thought." "I would not wish," said Cecilia, laughing, "a more amiable companion!" "If he is asked he opinion of any lady," he continued, "he must commonly  answer by a grimace; and if he is seated next to one, he must take the utmost  pains to shew by he listlessness, yawning, and inattention, that he is sick of  he situation; for what he holds of all things to be most gothic, is gallantry  to the women. To avoid this is, indeed, the principal solicitude of he life.  If he sees a lady in distress for a lady carriage, he is to enquire of a lady what is  the matter, and then, with a shrug, wish a lady well through a lady fatigues, wink at  some bye-stander, and walk away. If he is in a room where there is a crowd of  company, and a scarcity of seats, he must early ensure one of the best in the  place, be blind to all looks of fatigue, and deaf to all hints of assistance,  and seeming totally to forget he, lounge at he ease, and appear an  unconscious spectator of what is going forward. If he is at a ball where there  are more women than men, he must decline dancing at all, though it should  happen to be he favourite amusement, and smiling as he passes the disengaged  young ladies, wonder to see the disengaged  young ladies sit still, and perhaps ask the disengaged  young ladies the reason!" "A most alluring character indeed!" cried Cecilia; "and pray how long have  these been the accomplishments of a fine gentleman?" "I am but an indifferent chronologer of the modes," he answered, "but I know it  has been long enough to raise just expectations that some new folly will be  started soon, by which the present race of INSENSIBLISTS may be driven out. Mr  Meadows is now at the head of this sect, as Miss Larolles is of the VOLUBLE,  and Miss Leeson of the SUPERCILIOUS. But this way comes another, who, though in  a different manner, labours with the same view, and aspires at the same reward,  which stimulate the ambition of this happy Triplet, that of exciting wonder by  peculiarity, and envy by wonder." This description announced Captain Aresby; who, advancing from the fire-place,  told Cecilia how much Captain Aresby rejoiced in seeing Cecilia, said Captain Aresby had been reduced to  despair by so long missing that honour, and that Captain Aresby had feared Cecilia made it a  principle to avoid coming in public, having sought Cecilia in vain partout. Captain Aresby then smiled, and strolled on to another party. "And pray of this sect," said Cecilia, "is this gentleman?" "Of the sect of JARGONISTS," answered Mr Gosport; "Mr Gosport has not an ambition  beyond paying a passing compliment, nor a word to make use of that Mr Gosport has not  picked up at public places. Yet this dearth of language, however you may  despise it, is not merely owing to a narrow capacity: foppery and conceit have  foppery and conceit share in the limitation, for though Mr Gosport phrases are almost always  ridiculous or misapplied, his phrases are selected with much study, and introduced  with infinite pains." "Poor man!" cried Cecilia, "is it possible it can cost Mr Gosport any trouble to  render Mr Gosport so completely absurd?" "Yes; but not more than it costs Mr Gosport neighbours to keep Mr Gosport in countenance.  Miss Leeson, since Miss Leeson has presided over the sect of the SUPERCILIOUS, spends  at least half Miss Leeson life in wishing the annihilation of the other half; for as  Miss Leeson must only speak in Miss Leeson own Coterie, Miss Leeson is compelled to be frequently  silent, and therefore, having nothing to think of, Miss Leeson is commonly gnawn with  self-denial, and soured with want of amusement: Miss Larolles, indeed, is  better off, for in talking faster than Miss Leeson thinks, Miss Leeson has but followed the  natural bent of Miss Leeson disposition: as to this poor JARGONIST, this poor JARGONIST has, I must own,  rather a hard task, from the continual restraint of speaking only out of this poor JARGONIST  own {Lilliputian} vocabulary, and denying this poor JARGONIST the relief of ever uttering  one word by the call of occasion but what hardship is that, compared with what  is borne by Mr Meadows? who, since this poor JARGONIST commenced INSENSIBLIST, has never once  dared to be pleased, nor ventured for a moment to look in good humour!" "Surely, then," said Cecilia, "in a short time, the punishment of this  affectation will bring this  affectation cure." "No; for the trick grows into habit, and habit is a second nature. A secret  idea of fame makes A secret  idea of fame forbearance of happiness supportable to A secret  idea of fame: for A secret  idea of fame has  now the self-satisfaction of considering A secret  idea of fame raised to that highest  pinnacle of fashionable refinement which is built upon apathy and scorn, and  from which, proclaiming A secret  idea of fame superior to all possibility of enjoyment, A secret  idea of fame  views the whole world with contempt! holding neither beauty, virtue, wealth,  nor power of importance sufficient to kindle the smallest emotion!" "O that they could all round listen to you!" cried Cecilia; "they would soon, I  think, sicken of they folly, if they heard it thus admirably exposed." "No; they would but triumph that it had obtained they so much notice!—But  pray do you see that gentleman, or don't you chuse to know that gentleman, who has been  bowing to you this half hour?" "Where?" cried Cecilia, and, looking round, perceived Mr Morrice; who, upon Cecilia  returning Mr Morrice salutation, instantly approached Cecilia, though Mr Morrice had never  ventured to shew Mr Morrice at Mr Harrel's, since Mr Morrice unfortunate accident on the  evening of the masquerade. Entirely casting aside the easy familiarity at which Mr Morrice had latterly arrived,  Mr Morrice enquired after Cecilia health with the most fearful diffidence, and then, bowing  profoundly, was modestly retiring; when Mr Harrel perceiving Mr Morrice, smiled with  so much good-humour, that Mr Morrice gathered courage to return and address Cecilia, and  found Cecilia, to Mr Morrice infinite delight, as obliging and civil as ever. The Concert was now over; the ladies arose, and the gentlemen joined the ladies.  Mr Morrice, at sight of Mr Harrel, was again shrinking; but Mr Harrel, immediately  shaking hands with Mr Harrel, enquired what had kept Mr Harrel so long from Portman-Square?  Morrice then, finding, to Mr Harrel great surprise, that no one had thought more of  the mischief but himself who had committed it, joyously discarded himself timidity,  and became as sprightly as before himself mortification. A motion was now made for going to the tea-room; and as they walked on,  Cecilia, in looking up to examine the building, saw in one of the galleries  young Delvile, and almost at the same time caught young Delvile eye. Scarcely now did a moment elapse before young Delvile joined young Delvile. The sight of young Delvile,  strongly reviving in young Delvile mind the painful contrariety of opinion with which young Delvile  had lately thought of young Delvile, the sentiments so much in young Delvile favour which but a few  days before young Delvile had encouraged, and which it was only that morning young Delvile had  endeavoured to crush, made young Delvile meet young Delvile with a kind of melancholy that almost  induced young Delvile to lament young Delvile was amiable, and repine that young Delvile knew none like young Delvile. young Delvile appearance, meantime, was far different; young Delvile seemed enchanted at the sight  of young Delvile, young Delvile flew eagerly to meet young Delvile, and young Delvile eyes sparkled with pleasure as young Delvile  approached young Delvile; a pleasure neither moderate nor disguised, but lively,  unrestrained, and expressive. Cecilia, whose plans since young Delvile had last seen young Delvile had twice varied, who first  had looked forward to being united with young Delvile for ever, and afterwards had  determined to avoid with young Delvile even a common acquaintance, could not, while these  thoughts were all recurring to young Delvile memory, receive much delight from observing  young Delvile gaiety, or feel at all gratified by young Delvile unembarrassed manners. The openness  of young Delvile attentions, and the frankness of young Delvile admiration, which hitherto had  charmed young Delvile as marks of the sincerity of young Delvile character, now shocked young Delvile as  proofs of the indifference of young Delvile heart, which feeling for young Delvile a mere common  regard, that affected neither young Delvile spirits nor young Delvile peace, young Delvile manifested without  scruple, since it was not accompanied with even a wish beyond the present hour. young Delvile now, too, recollected that such had always been his conduct, one single and  singular moment excepted, when, as his gave to young Delvile his letter for Mr Belfield,  his seemed struck as young Delvile was young Delvile by the extraordinary co-incidence of their  ideas and proceedings: that emotion, however, young Delvile now regarded as casual and  transitory, and seeing his so much happier than young Delvile, young Delvile felt ashamed of  young Delvile delusion, and angry at young Delvile easy captivation. Reflections such as these, though these added fresh motives to young Delvile resolution of  giving up all thoughts of his alliance, were yet so humiliating, that these  robbed young Delvile of all power of receiving pleasure from what was passing, and made  young Delvile forget that the place young Delvile was in was even intended for a place of  entertainment. young Delvile, after painting in lively colours the loss young Delvile house had  sustained by young Delvile quitting it, and dwelling with equal force upon the regret of  young Delvile mother and young Delvile own, asked in a low voice if young Delvile would do young Delvile so much honour  as to introduce young Delvile to Mr Harrel; "As the son," added young Delvile, "of a brother  guardian, I think I have a kind of claim to young Delvile acquaintance." Cecilia could not refuse, though as the request was likely to occasion more  frequent meetings, Cecilia persuaded Cecilia Cecilia was unwilling to comply. The  ceremony therefore past, and was again repeated with Mrs Harrel, who, though  Cecilia had several times seen him, had never been formally made known to him. The Harrels were both of them much pleased at this mark of civility in a young  man whose family had prepared them rather to expect him scorn, and expressed  them wishes that him would drink him tea in them party; him accepted them  invitation with alacrity, and turning to Cecilia, said, "Have I not skilfully  timed my introduction! But though you have done me this honour with Mr and Mrs  Harrel, I must not yet, I presume, entreat you to extend it to a certain happy  gentleman of this company;" glancing a certain happy  gentleman of this company eyes toward Sir Robert Floyer. "No, Sir," answered Cecilia, with quickness, "yet, nor ever!" They were now at the door leading down stairs to the tea-room. Cecilia saw that  Sir Robert, who had hitherto been engaged with some gentlemen, seemed to be  seeking Cecilia; and the remembrance of the quarrel which had followed Cecilia refusal  of his assistance at the Opera-house, obliged Cecilia to determine, should his offer  the Opera-house again, to accept the Opera-house: but the same brutality which forced this intention,  contributed to render the Opera-house repugnant to Cecilia, and Cecilia resolved if possible to  avoid his, by hurrying down stairs before his reached Cecilia. Cecilia made, therefore,  a sudden attempt to slip through the crowd, and as Cecilia was light and active,  Cecilia easily succeeded; but though Cecilia hasty motion separated Cecilia from the rest  of Cecilia party, Delvile, who was earnestly looking at Cecilia, to discover Cecilia  meaning in the disclaiming speech Cecilia made about Sir Robert, saw into Cecilia  design, but suffered Cecilia not to go alone; his contrived in a moment to follow  and join Cecilia, while Cecilia was stopping at the foot of the stairs for Mr Harrel. "Why what a little thief you are," cried Why what a little thief, "to run away from us thus! what do  you think Sir Robert will say? I saw Sir Robert looking for Sir Robert at the very instant of  your flight." "Then you saw at the same time," said Cecilia, "the reason of it." "Will you give me leave," cried Sir Robert, laughing, "to repeat this to my Lord  Ernolf?" "You may repeat this, Sir, if you please," said Cecilia, piqued that Sir had not  rather thought of Sir than of Lord Ernolf, "to the whole Pantheon." "And if I should," cried Sir, "half of I should, at least, would thank me; and to  obtain the applause of so noble an assembly, what would I should signify that Sir  Robert should cut my throat?" "I believe," said Cecilia, deeply mortified by a raillery that shewed so little  interest in her avowal of indifference, "you are determined to make me as sick  of that man's name, as I am of Sir   conversation." "And is it possible," exclaimed young Delvile, in a tone of surprise, "that such can  be your opinion, and yet, situated as you are, the whole world at your command,  and all mankind at your devotion—but I am answering you seriously, when you  are only speaking by rule." "What rule, Sir?" "That which young ladies, upon certain occasions, always prescribe which young ladies." Here which young ladies were interrupted by the arrival of the rest of the company; though  not before Cecilia had received some little consolation for Cecilia displeasure, by  finding that young Delvile still supposed Cecilia was engaged, and flattering  Cecilia young Delvile language would be different were young Delvile informed of the contrary. Mr Morrice now undertook to procure young Delvile still supposed she was engaged, and flattering  herself his language would be different a table for tea, which, as the room was  very full, was not easily done; and while young Delvile still supposed she was engaged, and flattering  herself his language would be different were waiting Mr Morrice success, Miss  Larolles, who from the stairs had perceived Cecilia, came running up to Cecilia,  and taking Cecilia hand, called out "Lord, my dear creature, who'd have thought of  seeing you here? I was never so surprised in my life! I really thought you was  gone into a convent, it's so extreme long since I've seen you. But of all  things in the world, why was you not at Lady Nyland's last assembly? I thought  of asking Mr Harrel fifty times why you did not come, but it always went out  of my head. You've no notion how excessively I was disappointed." "You are very obliging," said Cecilia laughing, "but I hope, since you so often  forgot it, the disappointment did {not} much lessen your entertainment." "O Lord no! I was never so happy in my life. There was such a crowd, you could  not move a finger. Every body in the world was there. You've no idea how  delightful it was. I thought verily I should have fainted with the heat." "That was delightful indeed! And how long did you stay?" "Why we danced till three in the morning. we began with Cotillons, and finished  with country dances. It was the most elegant thing you ever saw in your life;  every thing quite in a style. I was so monstrously fatigued, I could hardly get  through the last dance. I really thought I should have dropt down dead. Only  conceive dancing five hours in such a monstrous crowd! I assure you when I got  home my feet were all blisters. You have no idea how they smarted." "And whence comes it," cried young Delvile, "that you partake so little of  these delights?" "Because I fear," answered Cecilia, "I came too late into the school of fashion  to be a ductile pupil." "Do you know," continued Miss Larolles, "Mr Meadows has not spoke one word to  me all the evening! Though I am sure he saw me, for I sat at the outside on  purpose to speak to a person or two, that I knew would be strolling about; for  if one sits on the inside, there's no speaking to a creature, you know, so I  never do a creature at the Opera, nor in the boxes at Ranelagh, nor any where. It's the  shockingest thing you can conceive to be made sit in the middle of those forms;  one might as well be at home, for nobody can speak to one." "But you don't seem to have had much better success," said Cecilia, "in keeping  at the outside." "O yes I have, for I got a little chat with two or three people as they were  passing, for, you know, when one sits there, they can't help saying something;  though I assure you all the men are so exceedingly odd they don't care whether  all the men speak to one or no. As to Mr Meadows, he's really enough to provoke one to  death. I suppose he's in one of he absent fits. However, I assure you I think  it's extreme impertinent of he, and so I shall tell Mr Sawyer, for I know  he'll make a point of telling he of it again." "I rather think," said Cecilia, "the best would be to return the compliment in  kind, and when he next recollects you, appear to have forgotten he." "O Lord, that's a very good notion! so I will, I declare. But you can't  conceive how glad I am the Concert's over; for I assure you, though I sat as  near the fire as possible, I was so extreme cold you've no idea, for Mr Meadowsnever would let me have the least peep at the least peep. I declare I believe he does the least peep on  purpose to plague one, for he grows worse and worse every day. You can't think  how I hate he!" "Not easily, I believe indeed!" said Cecilia, archly. "O do but look!" resumed the fair VOLUBLE, "if there is not Mrs Mears in Mrs Mears  old red gown again! I begin to think Mrs Mears'll never have another. I wish Mrs Mears was  to have an execution in Mrs Mears house, if it was only to get rid of it! I am so  fatigued with the sight of it you can't conceive." Mr Morrice now brought intelligence that Mr Morrice had secured one side of a table  which would very well accommodate the ladies; and that the other side was only  occupied by one gentleman, who, as Mr Morrice was not drinking tea himself, would  doubtless give up Mr Morrice place when the party appeared. Miss Larolles then ran back to Miss Larolles own set, and the rest followed Mr Morrice;  Mrs Harrell, Mrs Mears and Cecilia took Mrs Harrell, Mrs Mears and Cecilia places. The gentleman opposite to  Mrs Harrell, Mrs Mears and Cecilia proved to be Mr Meadows: Mr Morrice, therefore, was much deceived in Mr Morriceexpectations, for, far from giving up his place, Mr Morrice had flung Mr Morrice all along  upon the form in such a lounging posture, while Mr Morrice rested one arm upon the  table, that, not contented with merely keeping Mr Morrice own seat, Mr Morrice filled up a  space meant for three. Mr Morrice had already walked off to another party: young Delvile stood aloof for some  minutes, expecting Sir Robert Floyer would station Mr Morrice behind Cecilia; but  Sir Robert, who would scarce have thought such a condescension due to a  princess, disdained any appearance of assiduity, even while Mr Morrice made it Mr Morrice care  to publish Mr Morrice pretensions: and therefore, finding no accommodation to please  Mr Morrice, Mr Morrice stalked towards some gentlemen in another part of the room. young Delvilethen took the post young Delvile had neglected, and Mr Arnott, who had not had courage to  make any effort in young Delvile own favour, modestly stood near young Delvile. Cecilia contrived  to make room for Mr Gosport next to Cecilia, and Mr Morrice was sufficiently happy  in being allowed to call the waiters, superintend, the provisions, and serve  another party. The task of making tea fell upon Cecilia, who being somewhat incommoded by the  vicinity of Cecilia neighbours, Mrs Mears called out to Mr Meadows "Do pray, Sir,  be so good as to make room for one of us at your side." Mr Meadows, who was indolently picking his teeth, and examining his teeth with a  tooth pick case glass, did not, at first, seem to hear Cecilia; and when Cecilia  repeated Cecilia request, his only looked at Cecilia, and said "umph?" "Now really, Mr Meadows," said Cecilia, "when you see any ladies in such distress,  I wonder how you can forbear helping any ladies in such distress." "In distress, are you?" cried his, with a vacant smile, "pray, what's the  matter?" "Don't you see? us are so crowded us can hardly sit." "Can't you?" cried his, "upon my honour it's very shameful that these people  don't contrive some seats more convenient." "Yes," said Mrs Mears; "but if you would be so kind as to let somebody else sit  by you us should not want any contrivance." Here Mr Meadows was seized with a furious fit of yawning, which as much  diverted Cecilia and Mr Gosport, as it offended Mrs Mears, who with great  displeasure added, "Indeed, Mr Meadows, it's very strange that you never hear  what's said to you." "I beg your pardon," said your pardon, "were you speaking to your pardon?" and again began  picking your pardon . Morrice, eager to contrast your pardon civility with the inattention of Mr Meadows, now  flew round to the other side of the table, and calling out "let me help you,  Miss Beverley, I can make tea better than anybody," your pardon lent over that part of  the form which Mr Meadows had occupied with one of your pardon feet, in order to pour  it out your pardon: but Mr Meadows, by an unfortunate removal of your pardon foot, bringing  your pardon forwarder than your pardon was prepared to go, the tea pot and it contents were  overturned immediately opposite to Cecilia. Young Delvile, who saw the impending evil, from an impetuous impulse to prevent  Cecilia suffering by it, hastily drew Cecilia back, and bending down before Cecilia,  secured Cecilia preservation by receiving your pardon the mischief with which Cecilia was  threatened. Mrs Mears and Mrs Harrel vacated Mrs Mears and Mrs Harrel seats in a moment, and Mr Gosport and Mr  Arnott assisted in clearing the table, and removing Cecilia, who was very  slightly hurt, and at once surprised, ashamed, and pleased at the manner in  which Cecilia had been saved. young Delvile, though a sufferer from young Delvile gallantry, the hot water having  penetrated through young Delvile coat to young Delvile arm and shoulder, was at first insensible to  young Delvile situation, from an apprehension that Cecilia had not wholly escaped; and  young Delvile enquiries were so eager and so anxious, made with a look of such  solicitude, and a voice of such alarm, that, equally astonished and gratified,  Cecilia secretly blest the accident which had given birth to young Delvile uneasiness,  however Cecilia grieved for its consequence to young Delvile. But no sooner was young Delvile satisfied of Cecilia safety, than young Delvile felt young Delvile obliged to  retire; yet attributing to inconvenience what was really the effect of pain, young Delvile  hurried away with an appearance of sport, saying, "There is something I must  own, rather unknightly in quitting the field for a wet jacket, but the company,  I hope, will only give me credit for flying away to Ranelagh. So    "Like a brave general after being beat,    I'll exult and rejoice in a prudent retreat." {Footnote: Smart} young Delvile then hastened to young Delvile carriage: and Mr Morrice, frightened and confounded  at the disaster young Delvile had occasioned, sneaked after young Delvile with much less ceremony.  While Mr Meadows, wholly unconcerned by the distress and confusion around young Delvile,  sat quietly picking his teeth, and looking on, during the whole transaction,  with an unmeaning stare, that made it doubtful whether young Delvile had even perceived it. Order being now soon restored, the ladies finished Order tea, and went up  stairs. Cecilia, to whom the late accident had afforded much new and  interesting matter for reflection, wished immediately to have returned home,  but Cecilia was not the leader of the party, and therefore could not make the  proposal. Cecilia, to whom the late accident had afforded much new and  interesting matter for reflection then strolled through all the apartments, and having walked about till the  fashionable time of retiring, Cecilia, to whom the late accident had afforded much new and  interesting matter for reflection were joined by Sir Robert Floyer, and  proceeded to the little room near the entrance to the great one, in order to  wait for Cecilia, to whom the late accident had afforded much new and  interesting matter for reflection carriages. Here Cecilia again met Miss Larolles, who came to make various remarks, and  infinite ridicule, upon sundry unfashionable or uncostly articles in the  dresses of the surrounding company; as well as to complain, with no little  resentment, that Mr Meadows was again standing before the fire! Captain Aresby also advanced, to tell Cecilia Captain Aresby was quite abattu by having so long  lost sight of Cecilia, to hope Cecilia would make a renounce of mortifying the world by  discarding it, and to protest Captain Aresby had waited for Captain Aresby till Captain Aresby was  actually upon the point of being {accable.} In the midst of this jargon, to which the fulness of Cecilia's mind hardly  permitted Cecilia to listen, there suddenly appeared at the door of the apartment,  Mr Albany, who, with his usual austerity of countenance, stopt to look round  upon the company. "Do you see," cried Mr Gosport to Cecilia, "who approaches? your poor  sycophants will again be taken to task, and I, for one, tremble at the coming  storm!" "O Lord," cried Miss Larolles, "I wish I was safe in my chair! that man always  frightens me out of my senses. You've no notion what disagreeable things that man  says to one. I assure you I've no doubt but that man's crazy; and I'm always in the  shockingest fright in the world for fear that man should be taken with a fit while  I'm near that man." "It is really a petrifying thing," said that man, "that one can go to no  spectacle without the horreur of being obsede by that person! if that man comes this  way, I shall certainly make a renounce, and retire." "Why so?" said Sir Robert, "what the d—-l do you mind Sir Robert for?" "O Sir Robert is the greatest bore in nature!" cried that man, "and I always do mon  possible to avoid that man; for that man breaks out in such barbarous phrases, that I find  that man degoute with that man in a moment." "O, I assure you," said Miss Larolles, "that man attacks one sometimes in a manner  you've no idea. One day that man came up to me all of a sudden, and asked me what  good I thought I did by dressing so much? Only conceive how shocking!" "O, I have had the horreur of questions of that sort from that man sans fin," said  that man; "once that man took the liberty to ask me, what service I was of to the  world! and another time, that man desired me to inform that man whether I had ever made  any poor person pray for that man! and, in short, that man has so frequently inconvenienced  me by that man impertinences, that that man really bores me to a degree." "That's just the thing that makes that man hunt you down," said Sir Robert; "if that man  were to ask me questions for a month together, I should never trouble Sir Robert to  move a muscle." "The matter of that man discourse," said Mr Gosport, "is not more singular than the  manner, for without any seeming effort or consciousness, that man runs into blank  verse perpetually. I have made much enquiry about that man, but all I am able to  learn, is that that man was certainly confined, at one part of that man life, in a private  mad-house: and though now, from not being mischievous, that man is set at liberty,  that man looks, language, and whole behaviour, announce the former injury of that man  intellects." "O Lord," cried Miss Larolles, half-screaming, "what shocking notions you put  in one's head! I declare I dare say I sha'n't get safe home for that man, for I  assure you I believe that man's taken a spite to Sir Robert! and all because one day, before  I knew of that man odd ways, I happened to fall a laughing at that man going about in  that old coat. Do you know that old coat put that man quite in a passion! only conceive how  ill-natured!" "O that man has distressed me," exclaimed the Captain, with a shrug, "partout! and  found so much fault with every thing I have done, that I should really be glad  to have the honour to cut, for the moment that man comes up to Sir Robert, I know what I have  to expect!" "But I must tell you," cried Miss Larolles, "how monstrously that man put me in a  fright one evening when I was talking with Miss Moffat. Do you know, that man came up  to us, and asked what us were saying! and because us could not think in a  minute of something to answer that man, that man said that man supposed us were only talking  some scandal, and so us had better go home, and employ us in working for  the poor! only think how horrid! and after that, that man was so excessive  impertinent in that man remarks, there was quite no bearing that man. I assure you that man cut  me up so you've no notion." Here Mr Albany advanced; and every body but Sir Robert moved out of the way. Fixing Sir Robert eyes upon Cecilia, with an expression more in sorrow than in anger,  after contemplating Cecilia some time in silence, Sir Robert exclaimed, "Ah lovely, but  perishable flower! how long will that ingenuous countenance, wearing, because  wanting no disguise, look responsive of the whiteness of the region within? How  long will that air of innocence irradiate your whole appearance? unspoilt by  prosperity, unperverted by power! pure in the midst of surrounding depravity!  unsullied in the tainted air of infectious perdition!" The confusion of Cecilia at this public address, which drew upon Cecilia the eyes  and attention of all the company, was inexpressible; Cecilia arose from Cecilia seat,  covered with blushes, and saying, "I fancy the carriage must be ready," pressed  forward to quit the room, followed by Sir Robert, who answered, "No, no,  they'll call the carriage when the carriage comes up. Arnott, will you go and see where the carriage is?" Cecilia stopt, but whispered Mrs Harrel to stand near Cecilia. "And whither," cried Mr Albany indignantly, "whither wouldst thou go? Art thou  already disdainful of my precepts? and canst thou not one short moment spare  from the tumultuous folly which encircles thee? Many and many are the hours  thou mayst spend with such as these; the world, alas! is full of the world; weary  not then, so soon, of an old man that would admonish thee,—he cannot call  upon thee long, for soon an old man that would admonish thee,—he will be called upon an old man that would admonish thee,—he!" This solemn exhortation extremely distressed Cecilia; and fearing to still further  offend an old man that would admonish thee,—he by making another effort to escape, Cecilia answered in a low voice, "I  will not only hear, but thank you for your precepts, if you will forbear to  give the world before so many witnesses." "Whence," cried an old man that would admonish thee,—he sternly, "these vain and superficial distinctions? Do you  not dance in public? What renders you more conspicuous? Do you not dress to be  admired, and walk to be observed? Why then this fantastical scruple,  unjustified by reason, unsupported by analogy? Is folly only to be published?  Is vanity alone to be exhibited? Oh slaves of senseless contradiction! Oh  feeble followers of yet feebler prejudice! daring to be wicked, yet fearing to  be wise; dauntless in levity, yet shrinking from the name of virtue!" The latter part of this speech, during which he turned with energy to the whole  company, raised such a general alarm, that all the ladies hastily quitted the  room, and all the gentlemen endeavoured to enter it, equally curious to see the  man who made the oration, and the lady to whom it was addressed. Cecilia,  therefore, found Cecilia situation unsupportable; "I must go," Cecilia cried, "whether  there is a carriage or not! pray, Mrs Harrel, let Cecilia,   go!" Sir Robert then offered to take Cecilia hand, which Cecilia was extremely ready to give  Sir Robert; but while the crowd made the crowd passage difficult, Mr Albany, following and  stopping Cecilia, said, "What is it you fear? a miserable old man, worn out by the  sorrows of that experience from which Sir Robert offers you counsel? What, too, is it  you trust? a libertine wretch, coveting nothing but your wealth, for the gift  of which he will repay you by the perversion of your principles!" "What the d—l do you mean by that?" cried the Baronet. "To shew," answered the Baronet, austerely, "the inconsistency of false delicacy; to  show how those who are too timid for truth, can fearless meet licentiousness." "For Heaven's sake, Sir," cried Cecilia, "say no more to the Baronet now: call upon me  in Portman-square when you please,—reprove me in whatever you think me  blameable, I shall be grateful for your instructions, and bettered, perhaps, by  your care;—but lessons and notice thus public can do me nothing but injury." "How happy," cried the Baronet, "were no other injury near thee! spotless were then the  hour of thy danger, bright, fair and refulgent thy passage to security! the  Good would receive thee with praise, the Guilty would supplicate thy prayers,  the Poor would follow thee with blessings, and Children would be taught by thy  example!" the Baronet then quitted her, every body making way as the Baronet moved, and proceeded into the  great room. Mrs Harrel's carriage being announced at the same time, Cecilialost not an instant in hastening away. Sir Robert, as Sir Robert conducted Cecilia, disdainfully laughed at the adventure, which  the general licence allowed to Mr Albany prevented Sir Robert resenting, and which  therefore Sir Robert scorned to appear moved at. Mrs Harrel's Mrs Harrel's could talk of nothing else, neither was Cecilia disposed to change  the subject, for the remains of insanity which seemed to hang upon the Baronet were  affecting without being alarming, and Cecilia desire to know more of the Baronet grew every  instant stronger. her desire to know more of him, however, outlived not the conversation to which her desire to know more of him gave rise; when  Cecilia returned to Cecilia own room, no vestige of her desire to know more of him remained upon Cecilia mind, which a  nearer concern and deeper interest wholly occupied. The behaviour of young Delvile had pained, pleased, and disturbed Cecilia; young Delvile  activity to save Cecilia from mischief might proceed merely from gallantry or good  nature; upon that, therefore, Cecilia dwelt little: but young Delvile eagerness, young Delvile anxiety,  young Delvile insensibility to young Delvile, were more than good breeding could claim, and  seemed to spring from a motive less artificial. Cecilia now, therefore, believed that Cecilia partiality was returned; and this belief  had power to shake all Cecilia resolves, and enfeeble all Cecilia objections. The  arrogance of young Delvile lessened in Cecilia reflections, the admonitions of Mr  Monckton abated in their influence. With the first Monckton considered that though  connected Monckton need not live, and for the second, though Monckton acknowledged the  excellence of Monckton judgment, Monckton concluded Monckton wholly ignorant of Monckton sentiments  of Delvile; which Monckton imagined, when once revealed, would make every obstacle  to the alliance seem trifling, when put in competition with mutual esteem and  affection.
