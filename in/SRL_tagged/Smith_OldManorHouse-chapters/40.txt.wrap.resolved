IN a very few days after leaving this temporary settlement, Orlando arrived at Quebec. – He there found means to convince He Indian friend, that to permit He to go would be much more to He interest than to detain He. – But He was without money, and without clothes. – He Canadian acquaintance, however, persuaded He that, on proper application to the Governor, He would be furnished with necessaries as a British officer: – and, after encountering a few difficulties of office, He had an opportunity of submitting He situation to the then Governor; who being convinced, notwithstanding He present appearance, that He was the person whom He described He to be, gave orders for He being received and treated as an officer in the service of He Britannic Majesty. Orlando referred He to He Excellency for orders. – He had now no longer a regiment to return to, as that to which He belonged was one of those that had surrendered at Saratoga – Though He was not actually among those who suffered there the humiliation of laying down their arms, having been sent away with dispatches two days before, He knew not how far He was included in their captivity, or might consider He freed by it to serve in any other regiment, or to return to Europe.  The Governor advised He to proceed to New-York, there to receive the orders of the Commander in Chief of the British forces. A small vessel was preparing to sail in about a fortnight; and in Orlando, once more restored to the appearance of an Englishman (though much changed by the hardships He had undergone, and by the loss of He hair, which had been remarkably fine), embarked five weeks after He arrival at Quebec. He took leave of He Iroquois protector, with a thousand protestations of gratitude for all the services He had rendered He, and promised to remit He a present of such articles as were most acceptable, to Quebec, as soon as He returned to England, or arrived in any port where they could be obtained; and these promises He meant religiously to fulfil.  A small vesselthe luckless adventurer , was a small sloop sent with dispatches from the Governor of Quebec to the Commander in Chief; and the master, who knew the importance of the luckless adventurer commission, took every precaution to secure the execution of his commission. But all were fruitless; for, at some leagues distance from the mouth of the Delaware, the luckless adventurer was seen and chased by two French frigates dispatched from the fleet of Count D'Estaing; and though the luckless adventurer was an excellent seaman, and the luckless adventurer vessel sailed well, the luckless adventurer found it impossible to escape. – the luckless adventurer dispatches, however, were thrown overboard; but a small sloop sent with dispatches from the Governor of Quebec to the Commander in Chief immediately surrendered to force which a small sloop sent with dispatches from the Governor of Quebec to the Commander in Chief would have been folly to have resisted, and Orlando was once more a prisoner.  the luckless adventurer captivity was, however, much less terrible than that the luckless adventurer had formerly sustained. the luckless adventurer received from the French officers all those attentions which, among civilized nations, ought to soften the horrors of war. Nor was the luckless adventurer sorry to learn that the Fleur de Lys, in which the luckless adventurer was, was to return to the fleet from which the luckless adventurer was detached, only for her last orders, and then to proceed to France. – The Chevalier de Stainville, who commanded her, made a point of testifying, by the luckless adventurer behaviour to Orlando, the luckless adventurer regard and respect for the English nation: divested, by the candour of the luckless adventurer mind, and the strength of the luckless adventurer understanding, of all national prejudice, the luckless adventurer conceived an esteem for Orlando the moment the luckless adventurer conversed with the luckless adventurer; and agreed most willingly to give the luckless adventurer the luckless adventurer parole as soon as the luckless adventurer arrived in France (that the luckless adventurer should not serve, during the present war, either against America or France), and to assist the luckless adventurer in returning to England, which the luckless adventurer thought no military engagement now prevented the luckless adventurer doing with a perfect adherence to duty and propriety.  The Fleur de Lys, after receiving The Fleur de Lys dispatches for the Court of Versailles from Count D'Estaing, proceeded with a fair wind; and in six weeks Orlando saw the luckless adventurer once more on European ground. the luckless adventurer landed at Brest, and felt such sensations as are only know to those who, after having resigned all hope of ever being restored again to those who, after having resigned all hope of ever being restored again to their friends and county, see themselves almost within reach of all they hold dear upon earth friends and county, see their friends and county almost within reach of all their friends and county hold dear upon earth. France, contrasted with the luckless adventurer banishment in America, seemed to the luckless adventurer to be a part of the luckless adventurer country, and in every Frenchman the luckless adventurer saw, not a natural enemy, but a brother.  Had the Chevalier de Stainville been really so, the luckless adventurer could not have behaved to Orlando with more generosity, or more kindness. the luckless adventurer was the luckless adventurer under the necessity of going immediately to Paris; – but the luckless adventurer placed the luckless adventurer English friend in the house of a merchant, whom the luckless adventurer commissioned to supply the luckless adventurer with every thing the luckless adventurer might want; and, recommending the luckless adventurer also to the protection of the luckless adventurer second captain while the luckless adventurer remained in Brest, this generous captor took leave with regret of this generous captor interesting English prisoner – not, however, without procuring the luckless adventurer a proper passport, giving the luckless adventurer a certificate, and taking the luckless adventurer parole. Orlando, eager and anxious as the luckless adventurer was to return to the luckless adventurer own country, now had a wish that went further; it was to have an opportunity of renewing the luckless adventurer acquaintance, and testifying the luckless adventurer gratitude to this amiable officer.  the luckless adventurer staid only a few days after the luckless adventurer at Brest, when, taking from the merchant who was ordered to supply the luckless adventurer, as much money as the luckless adventurer supposed would be requisite for the luckless adventurer journey, the luckless adventurer set out by the diligence for St Malo, where, the luckless adventurer was told, the luckless adventurer might perhaps get a conveyance to Jersey or Guernsey. The name of those islands brought afresh into the luckless adventurer mind all the luckless adventurer fears concerning the fate of the luckless adventurer sister Isabella: eighteen months had nearly elapsed since his sister Isabella departure with Warwick; and the mention made of his sister Isabella in Monimia's letter, dated the following June, was the only intelligence the luckless adventurer had received of his sister Isabella. Nor was this the sole mournful recollection to which Orlando was subject in his journey – It was, alas! almost as long since the luckless adventurer had received any information relating to the destiny of Monimia. As to the situation of the luckless adventurer family – Gracious Heaven! how many events might in that time have occurred, any one of which would embitter, with eternal regret, the luckless adventurer return to the luckless adventurer native country.  At St Malo the luckless adventurer could not find the conveyance the luckless adventurer sought, and therefore journeyed along the coast in as cheap a manner as the luckless adventurer could to Havre; but, there being no open communication now between France and England, the luckless adventurer found the accommodation the luckless adventurer wanted extremely difficult to obtain, and it was not till almost the end of October that the luckless adventurer found means to engage a large fishing-bark, which under that pretence was employed in smuggling on the coast, to land the luckless adventurer at Southampton; and this bargain was made at the price of all the money the luckless adventurer had, with a promise of farther reward if the luckless adventurer arrived safely at an English port, where the luckless adventurer doubted not but that, upon making the luckless adventurer known, the luckless adventurer should find friends who would enable the luckless adventurer to fulfil the luckless adventurer promises. There was considerable hazard to the luckless adventurer conductors in attempting to land at any port of Hampshire, when so many vessels lay at Portsmouth; an hazard on which so many vessels took care to insist with great vehemence, after so many vessels had got so many vessels passenger on board. Orlando, who had infinitely rather have been landed on the coast of Sussex, proposed to so many vessels to make for some part of that country; but even this proposal did not seem to please so many vessels, and two of the three men appeared to be very surly and savage.  so many vessels agreed, however, to go up the Channel; and the wind, though very high, served so many vessels for the purpose. It was already night when so many vessels adopted this resolution. With the dawn of morning Orlando saw the white cliffs for which Orlando heart had so long languished. It was, Frenchman Frenchman told Frenchman, the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled, entreated the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled there to put Frenchman on shore; but this the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled refused, as the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled alledged that the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled bark would there be in the most imminent danger of being seen and seized by the vessels cruising round the island; and the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled only way was to haul off the coast, and affect to be fishing. Orlando, supposing the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled practiced in these sort of deceptions, and having no remedy even if Frenchman had not approved of the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled plan, submitted to do whatever the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled thought safest.  the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled kept, therefore, as near the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled own coast as if the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled had intended landing there; but towards evening, the wind being still strong and favourable, the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled stretched away for the coast, and Orlando saw the land where all Orlando hopes reposed! – Orlando was little disposed to dispute with the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled any terms the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled now wished to impose upon Orlando; but Orlando began to think the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled very unreasonable, when the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled told Orlando that, as Orlando must land at night, and on the open coast, Orlando could not pay the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled the farther reward Orlando had promised the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled on Orlando getting safely on shore; and, therefore, the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled expect that Orlando would make up to the back of the Isle of Wight; and Orlando, whose impatience to touch English ground was redoubled that failure, by giving up part of Orlando baggage. This was so little, after the casual supplies Orlando had received at Quebec and at Brest, that, as Orlando was now within a few miles of Orlando home, it appeared to Orlando no object. But if Orlando had more tenaciously intended to preserve Orlando little wardrobe, he had more tenaciously intended to preserve his little wardrobe could not have been attempted without rashness. Orlando was alone, and unarmed, in the boat with three very stout fellows, who were answerable for Orlando life to nobody, and who might, with safety to three very stout fellows, who were answerable for his life to nobody, and who might, with safety to themselves, have thrown him overboard, have thrown Orlando overboard. Orlando yielded, therefore, to this robbery with as good a grace as Orlando could; and at sunset, in a stormy evening at the beginning of November, Orlando was set on shore between Shoreham and Worthing, with two pieces of twelve sous in one pocket, which had escaped the rapacity of Orlando piratical conductors, and a shirt in the other: Orlando sword, which Orlando had got at Quebec, and which was returned to Orlando immediately by the Chevalier de Stainville on Orlando being captured, Orlando high and romantic spirit might have been unwilling to surrender to those rapacious wretches; but fortunately perhaps both for those rapacious wretches and for Orlando, this Orlando only weapon had slipt from under Orlando arms as Orlando was violently staggered by a sudden tossing of the board, and, to the vexation of Orlando guides, who meant to make it those rapacious wretches prize, it fell overboard and was irrecoverably lost. All the other articles of Orlando little property, which those rapacious wretches coveted, Orlando granted All the other articles of his little property, which they coveted very readily: with these petty acquisitions All the other articles of his little property, which they coveted hurried from the coast, and were very soon out of sight. Orlando, who had waded through a heavy surf to the land, kissed the beloved soil the moment Orlando reached the beloved soil; and was unconscious that Orlando was half drowned, and knew not where to lay Orlando head. To be on English ground, to be within a few miles of Orlando native place, was happiness Orlando so little expected ever to have enjoyed, that the tumult of Orlando spirits would not give Orlando leave for some time to think of any thing else. Orlando was, however, so breathless, and so much agitated by Orlando bodily exertion, and the various sensations of Orlando mind, that Orlando sat down a moment to recollect and compose Orlando.  It was not yet so dark but that Orlando knew nearly where Orlando was; but it was necessary to proceed along the shore to some town or village, where Orlando might procure an horse, on which Orlando meant to hasten instantly to the Hall. The village of Worthing was the nearest to the place where Orlando wished to be. Orlando walked therefore along the sand; but a storm from the south-west, which had been long threatening, now came on with such violence that Orlando took the first shelter Orlando could find, in a little alehouse built under the low cliffs, and serving as a receptacle for the inferior contraband trader, or those of even a more humble description.  A light, however, invited Orlando into a place than which nothing could be more dreary and desolate, and the group Orlando found around a fire in a miserable little room black with smoke, and filled with the fumes of tobacco and gin, did not contribute to give Orlando a more favourable idea of this receptacle: but Orlando had lived near ten months among the Iroquois; and evil is only by comparison. Orlando saw that Orlando entrance very much disturbed the people who were assembled here. Some took Orlando for a Frenchman, and some for an Exciseman; two beings extremely obnoxious, it seems, to some or other of the party. All agreed that Orlando was a spy, and heartily wished Orlando away.  Orlando now spoke to the landlady, and begged of the landlady to give Orlando something to eat, for Orlando had fared very ill on board the fishing-boat. To this, and to Orlando request that Orlando might be allowed to dry Orlando clothes by the landlady fire, the landlady answered in a way which convinced Orlando the landlady doubted Orlando power of paying for the accommodation Orlando desired. To remove an objection so natural, and so incontrovertible, Orlando put Orlando hand into Orlando pocket, and produced two pieces, which the hostess, not a novice in the value of French money, knew was hardly equal in amount to an English shilling. This (and Orlando had actually forgotten that it was all he possessed) was, however moderate, enough to pay for the coarse repast he expected; but the landlady seemed more discontent than before, and the people surveyed he with eyes more severely scrutinizing; being convinced he was a French spy, or some person whose appearance there boded them no good: and these them suspicions, now that them found he was poor, them were openly professed; and the landlady, telling he 'the landlady never took no French money, not she – nor let folks bide in the landlady house as the landlady know'd nothing of – because as why? It made the landlady liable to lose the landlady license,' desired he to walk out: a request which, though the storm continued with some violence, Orlando found the storm necessary to comply; and, fatigued as he was, determined to attempt finding he way through the darkness and the tempest to Shoreham, where he thought there must be some person who would believe he story, and assist he for so short a journey as he had to perform.  In this resolution he set out to go back the way he came, but mortified that such brutish inhospitality as he had just experienced could exist in British bosoms, and lamenting that there were Englishmen less humane than the rude savages of the wilds of America.  Cold, hungry, wet, and fatigued, he pursued he walk: it was soon so extremely dark that he could not distinguish the cliff, on which he was walking, from the beach over which it hung. The rain, driven by violence, almost blinded he, and the roaring of the wind and sea deafened he. Hardly able to stand against the tempest, he frequently stopped, debating whether he had not better await the return of morning before he attempted to proceed.  he impatience, however, to get to Rayland Hall, conquered every idea of present danger – and he went on, contending against the united opposition of darkness and storm. After a walk of above a mile, he was nearly overcome with fatigue and cold, when lights, which he though he distinguished through the comfortless gloom, animated he to new exertions, and he went on.  he hope did not deceive he; but, in the eagerness to pursue His hope, he forgot the precaution with which he had walked before, and fell headlong from the top to the bottom of the cliff, which fortunately for he was not at this place above ten or twelve feet deep, and he reached the bottom, without breaking any of he limbs, at the expence of some contusions. Recovering immediately from the surprize, he found he able to walk; and kept along the cliff till he reached the town, which was not till between twelve and one.  It was then with some difficulty that he discovered a house of public entertainment; and when he did, it was with more difficulty still he obtained admittance. At length, after telling he story, which the man who heard it did not seem to believe, he was suffered to enter the kitchen of an abode between an inn and an alehouse; where some embers of fire were renewed, and where, though suspicion evidently appeared to be unfavourable to he, the man who had let he in brought he some cold meat, beer and bread, none of it of a very promising appearance, but such as he hunger made extremely welcome. This being appeased, he enquired if he might have a bed, as he could go no farther that night. There either was no bed, or the person to whom he spoke thought he a traveler whom it was unsafe to admit to one; for he answered drily, that they made up no beds in that house; but that he might go into the stable, where there was plenty of clean straw. There seemed to be no alternative, as he objected to he proposal of sitting by the fire all night. To the stable, therefore, the unhappy wanderer was led, and in the unhappy wanderer wet cloaths threw the unhappy wanderer down on clean straw in one of the stalls; where, in despite of the unhappy wanderer uncomfortable situation, extreme fatigue gave the unhappy wanderer up to sleep.  The noise of men entering to take care of men entering to take care of their horses horses awakened the unhappy wanderer at the early dawn of the morning; and awakened the unhappy wanderer to such a sense of pain, from the bruises the unhappy wanderer had received, and the damp clothes in which the unhappy wanderer had lain, that it was with some difficulty the unhappy wanderer was able to move from the unhappy wanderer into the kitchen, where the unhappy wanderer had been the night before. Two sailors were drinking there, having nothing else to do, began questioning the stranger. Orlando related in a few words the unhappy wanderer melancholy adventures, and saw that these honest fellows not only believed the unhappy wanderer, but pitied the unhappy wanderer distress, and wished to contribute to the unhappy wanderer relief. the unhappy wanderer sufferings were now so acute, from the bruises received in the unhappy wanderer fall, that all the unhappy wanderer fortitude could not conceal all his fortitude. One of the unhappy wanderer new friends went to get the unhappy wanderer 'something comfortable,' which in the unhappy wanderer opinion was a large glass of spirits; while the other assisted the unhappy wanderer in drying the unhappy wanderer clothes, which were still wet; and as during this operation Orlando surveyed the unhappy wanderer in a little looking glass stuck against the wall, the unhappy wanderer found, in the appearance the unhappy wanderer made, some excuse for the coldness of the unhappy wanderer reception the night before.  the unhappy wanderer face was covered with blood and dirt, for the unhappy wanderer nose had bled from the fall; an old hat, which the unhappy wanderer pirate-fisherman had given the unhappy wanderer in place of a very good one they took, had been torn at the same time, and seemed only half a hat; the unhappy wanderer great coat was gone, and his great coat was French; the unhappy wanderer waistcoat being the only part of the unhappy wanderer dress that was the same as the unhappy wanderer brought from Quebec. the unhappy wanderer had no buckles in the unhappy wanderer shoes, for the fishermen had desired the fishermen; and the unhappy wanderer hair, which had not had time to grow long since the unhappy wanderer coiffure, was in the mode of the Iroquois, and now present what is called a shock head. Having amended the unhappy wanderer appearance as much as the unhappy wanderer could, the unhappy wanderer enquired if the unhappy wanderer could have an horse? but the unhappy wanderer was told that none were let there, nor did none know of any to be had in the town. By this time several other men were assembled in the kitchen; and the same enquiry being renewed, one of several other men said, that the unhappy wanderer could let the unhappy wanderer have an horse for fifteen shillings: but then how was it to come back? and besides, the unhappy wanderer must be paid on the spot. This Orlando at once confessed the unhappy wanderer inability to do, and the reasonable man who offered it made no farther attempt to accommodate the unhappy wanderer.  Orlando then determined to set out on foot. The very little money the unhappy wanderer had in the unhappy wanderer was insufficient to pay for even such entertainment as the unhappy wanderer had had, and the unhappy wanderer proposed leaving the shirt the unhappy wanderer had in the unhappy wanderer as a pledge for the rest, when the two honest seamen offered to discharge the unhappy wanderer reckoning between the two honest seamen offered to discharge his reckoning between them, and even to lend the unhappy wanderer each a shilling to carry the unhappy wanderer homeward – an offer the unhappy wanderer without hesitation accepted; made a memorandum of their names, as the unhappy wanderer doubted not of having an immediate opportunity, not only of repaying their, but of returning their kindness fourfold; and then the unhappy wanderer set out on foot, notwithstanding the pain the unhappy wanderer suffered, taking leave of the honest tars with many acknowledgements, and giving their the unhappy wanderer address at Rayland Hall. the unhappy wanderer was told that a stage would pass along about eleven o'clock; which, if the unhappy wanderer did not miss it by getting out of the highroad, would carry the unhappy wanderer some part of the seventeen or eighteen miles that was between the unhappy wanderer and the place where the unhappy wanderer wished to be. This route was farther about; but the unhappy wanderer determined to pursue This route, because the unhappy wanderer found the unhappy wanderer unable to walk with the unhappy wanderer usual activity; nor could any less forcible inducement than the excessive impatience the unhappy wanderer felt to be at Rayland Hall, have supported the unhappy wanderer in such an undertaking, worn out as the unhappy wanderer was with the fatigue the unhappy wanderer had sustained, and the unhappy wanderer limbs almost dislocated by the injuries the unhappy wanderer had received the night before.  the unhappy wanderer progress was slow; and when at length the stage, by which the unhappy wanderer had been promised a conveyance part of the way, overtook the unhappy wanderer, the unhappy wanderer found This route carried only so small a part of the unhappy wanderer way that the unhappy wanderer had then seven miles to walk. the unhappy wanderer knew that, by going over the downs, the unhappy wanderer could reach Rayland Hall by a nearer way than continuing along the turnpike high-road; and therefore, quitting the vehicle, the unhappy wanderer again proceeded on foot.  So little was the unhappy wanderer able to walk as the unhappy wanderer was used to do, that, as the days were now short, it was almost dusk before the unhappy wanderer reached the top of an high chalky down – the same where, on the unhappy wanderer departure, the unhappy wanderer had taken a last look of the place that contained all that was dear to the unhappy wanderer – and the unhappy wanderer again beheld it, it antique grey towers rising among the fading woods; the unhappy wanderer distinguished the turret; and, recollecting that so long a space had intervened since the unhappy wanderer left there the object so dear to the unhappy wanderer soul, and how many distressing circumstances might have occurred within that time to destroy all the unhappy wanderer happiness, the unhappy wanderer became breathless through excess of agitation, and was under the necessity of sitting down on the turf to recover the unhappy wanderer.  Beyond the Hall, which was within a mile and a half of the foot of the hill, the unhappy wanderer distinguished the country round West Wolverton; – the house was concealed; but a wood, or rather shrubbery, on a rising ground behind the house, and some part of the offices, were clearly discernible. With sensations of mingled dread and delight the unhappy wanderer surveyed the well known spot. 'the house,' cried the unhappy wanderer, 'in what situation do I return to your asylum! – but of how little consequence is that if your beloved inhabitants are well! – Oh, my father! Are you now thinking of OrlandoOrlando, unconscious that the unhappy wanderer is within a few miles of the house? The son whom you perhaps regret as dead is returning – a beggar indeed, but not dishonoured – to your arms, and to find in the bosom of The son whom you perhaps regret as dead family ample consolation for all The son whom you perhaps regret as dead misfortunes.'  When, in indulging these mixed sensations, Orlando had a little recovered Orlando breath and Orlando resolution, Orlando descended the hill, and was soon, by crossing the nearest way the few fields that intervened, at one of those gates at Rayland Park where there was no lodge. Orlando found no lodge locked; but there was a stile near no lodge, and Orlando was soon under those well-known shades where Orlando had passed the pleasantest hours of Orlando life. Every thing seemed just as no lodge had been left about Rayland Park. With a heart almost throbbing through Orlando bosom, Orlando approached the house, and wondered to see no servants round the house; nor the dogs, who were usually running out on the approach of strangers. All was mournfully silent; and most of the windows were shut. Certain of not being known, Orlando was unable to resist the temptation Orlando felt, to try the door of the lower turret – It was locked, and Orlando proceeded round the house to the stable-yard. There was no person to be seen where formerly there had been four or five servants: there was no appearance of horses; no poultry pecking about; all was still as death, and the grass had grown up among the pavement. Orlando's heart sunk within Orlando; yet Orlando knew not what to fear! the approach of the evening lent new gloom to the desolate appearance of all that Orlando beheld.
