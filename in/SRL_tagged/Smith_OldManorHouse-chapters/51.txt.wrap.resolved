ON his return home, Orlando related to his wife his extraordinary meeting with Warwick; and though his expressed great delight in knowing that his sister was living and well, his could not but feel concern for the situation in which his found his wife. his knew not whether Warwick did not, notwithstanding his apparent gaiety and carelessness, repent his of his precipitate marriage; and his feared, that, by a man of so volatile a temper, the evils of narrow circumstances would not be softened to Isabella.  his hastened to Isabella the next morning, and Isabella received his with blended emotions of joy and distress particularly affecting. It was not till some time after Warwick left them together, that Isabella had courage to ask the circumstances of Isabella father's death; yet Isabella was consoled by hearing, that Isabella elopement did not appear to have hastened her elopement. Orlando then entreated Isabella to determine on seeing Isabella mother immediately, and Isabella left her elopement to his to manage her elopement as his would. his embraced Isabella two lovely children with affection, and could not behold her two lovely children, without representing to Isabella how necessary it was to think of some means to reconcile Warwick to General Tracy.  Isabella answered, 'that her two lovely children had come to London with that intention; but that Warwick's pride, and his uncle's having certainly made a will in favour of his brother's son, had combined to throw difficulties in the way of a reconciliation; and Isabella now despaired of Warwick's pursuing his hopes of it, or of her two lovely children being crowned with success if his did. – his change of name,' Isabella said, 'had been made partly to avoid his creditors, who now believed his dead, till his could find means of paying them; and partly that General Tracy might not be informed of General Tracy being in London, till General Tracy could know whether there was a likelihood of General Tracy being forgiven.' The vivacity of Isabella seemed subdued, but The vivacity of Isabella was not dejected; and after The vivacity of Isabella had wept over the account of The vivacity of Isabella father's death, The vivacity of Isabella brother's misconduct, and the dispersion of The vivacity of Isabella family, The vivacity of Isabella recovered some degree of cheerfulness, and seemed to prepare The vivacity of Isabella for an interview with The vivacity of Isabella mother, with more resolution than, from all that had happened, Orlando thought it possible for The vivacity of Isabella to assume.  This formidable meeting was fixed for the next day; and when Orlando left his sister, his began to consider if his might not, at the same time, acknowledge his own marriage, and put an end, at once, to the state of uneasiness, and consciousness of violated integrity which his now was in.  When his rapped at his own door, his was told by the maid who opened it, 'that the porter whom his saw in the passage had been waiting for his some time with a letter, which his was directed to deliver into no hands but his own.' his opened it with precipitation, and found these words written in a hand hardly legible:  'DEAR ORLANDO,  'IF my having left you so long ignorant of what is become of his, has not entirely estranged you from his – come to his at the place the bearer will shew you, and perhaps it will be the last trouble you will ever receive from  Yours, P. SOMERIVE.'  Orlando, shocked and surprised, enquired of the man, who stood by, 'where his had left the gentleman who sent his?' – his replied, 'that his had orders not to answer, but to shew his the way: – that the gentleman who sent him was ill in bed, and given over by the doctor.' Still more alarmed by this account, his bade his wait a moment, while his went up to speak to Monimia, in order to account for his being so much longer absent, and then hastened with his conductor to an obscure street leading from the Strand to Covent Garden; where, in an attic room, very dirty and very ill furnished, Orlando found his unhappy brother, in an illness which seemed to be the last stage of a rapid decline, brought on by debauchery and excess.  It might give too tragic a colouring to the conclusion of this narrative, were the scenes of some days to be minutely described – It may therefore suffice to state, that Orlando could not conceal from his mother the situation of his mother eldest son, who, conscious of his approaching end, and conscious too of all his offences towards his mother, implored his mother pity and forgiveness. In his repentance, however late, his mother forgot his errors, and as solicitously tried to save his as if his had never offended his mother. – With difficulty his was removed to his mother own house, where his mother constantly attended his, with Orlando, and where there were, for some days, hopes of his recovery. – It was in this interval that Orlando, who could not bear to be so constantly separated from Monimia, and whose heart continually reproached his with the deception his was guilty of towards his mother, concerted with Selina the means of declaring both his marriage, and the return of Isabella to London. Mrs Somerive, on the point of losing one of Mrs Somerive children, embraced, with transport, the daughter Mrs Somerive had so long believed lost; and though Mrs Somerive trembled for the consequence of Orlando's marriage, when there seemed so little probability of Mrs Somerive finding a support for a family, Mrs Somerive acknowledged that Monimia, of whom Mrs Somerive soon became passionately fond, was an apology for Mrs Somerive indiscretion. With the tenderest assiduity, Monimia shared the fatigue of attending on the dying brother of Mrs Somerive husband; and in despite of the remonstrances and displeasure of Mr Woodford, who did all Mrs Somerive could to irritate Mrs Somerive sister against Orlando, and who mingled the pecuniary favours which his sister was obliged to owe Mrs Somerive, with admonitions and reproaches that destroyed all their value, Mrs Somerive not only forgave Orlando, but seemed to love Mrs Somerive more fondly than ever. That cruel want of money, which too often divides families, and estranges even the child from the parent, served only to unite this family more closely. The pride of Warwick alone kept Mrs Somerive at a greater distance than the rest; and unable, under Mrs Somerive present circumstances, to appear as Mrs Somerive once did, Mrs Somerive could not bear to appear at all before those, who had once seen Mrs Somerive so differently situated. Mrs Somerive avoided, therefore, going to the house, when Mrs Somerive thought there was a probability of Mrs Somerive meeting any of the Woodford family; none of the Woodford family indeed but Woodford himself were very likely to be there; but from Woodford himself Warwick would have flown with more apprehension than from the rest, not only on account of Mrs Somerive coarse jokes, but because of Mrs Somerive connection with General Tracy.  But Isabella, though equally desirous of escaping the unfeeling raillery or cold remonstrances of Isabella uncle, was, without meeting Woodford himself, constantly with Isabella family, and was, with Monimia and Selina, the support of the unhappy Mrs Somerive, when, after lingering about a fortnight after Woodford himself removal, Isabella eldest son expired in the arms of Orlando.  There is a degree of folly, and of vice, which gradually dissolves the tenderest affections, weans the friend from the beloved companion of youth, and renders the ties of blood the most galling and insupportable chains. To this point of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive had long since arrived. irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive had too plainly evinced, that to irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive own selfish gratifications irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive would always sacrifice the welfare, and even the subsistence of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive family; yet, in irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive repentance on the bed of pain and languor, irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive mother forgot and forgave all his mother had suffered from irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive; and when irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive died, his mother wept for irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive as the child of his mother early affection, whose birth and infancy had once formed his mother greatest felicity. – In shedding tears over an object once so beloved by his mother , his mother seemed a second time to have lost irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive; and the first subject to which his mother attended, was to have irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive remains deposited with those of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive father, in the family vault at West Wolverton.  In this Orlando determined that his mother should at all events be gratified, whatever inconvenience might in whatever inconvenience present narrow circumstances arise from the expence: irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive gave therefore directions accordingly; when irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive found that Woodford himself took upon irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive to oppose this wish of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive , in a way so rude and savage, that after very high words had passed between irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive and irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive uncle (in which Woodford himself reproached Orlando with all the pecuniary favours irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive had bestowed upon irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive family, and ridiculed irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive beggarly marriage), Orlando at the last part of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive conversation entirely lost irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive temper, and desired the unfeeling man of consequence to leave the house.  irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive had then the additional difficulty of concealing this disagreement from irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive , and of finding the means to supply that deficiency which this cruelty of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive uncle would create. – The little sum left of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive commission, after paying some late expences of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive brother's, and for irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive own lodgings, was reduced within thirty pounds, in which consisted irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive whole fortune. irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive uncle, who had till now contributed yearly to the support of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive mother and irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive sisters, now protested that irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive would do no more. From irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive eldest sister married in Ireland, who had a family of her own, very trifling assistance only could be expected; and Warwick could not provide for irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive own family. Thus Orlando saw, that on an income of hardly an hundred a year, irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive mother and irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive two unmarried sisters were to live; and that Monimia and Monimia family, whom irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive could not think of suffering to be any additional burden to his mother and his two unmarried sisters, could have not other dependence than on irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive exertions; yet into what way of life to enter, or where to seek the means of providing for his mother and his two unmarried sisters, irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive knew not.  Sad were irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive reflections on the past, on the present, and on the future, when irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive set out with the melancholy procession that was to convey the remains of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive deceased brother to the last abode of the Somerive family; and little was the correspondence between irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive internal feelings and the beauty of the season, which gave peculiar charms to the country through which irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive passed. – The tears of the family irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive had left, of which Monimia was during irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive absence to be a part, seemed to have deprived irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive of the power of shedding a tear; but with eyes that gloomily surveyed the objects around irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive, without knowing what irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive saw, irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive reached at the close of the second day's journey West Wolverton, and at a little alehouse, the only one in the village, the funeral stopped that night, while Orlando went out alone to direct what yet remained of the necessary preparations.  It was a beautiful still evening, towards the end of May; but the senses of Orlando Orlando were shut to all the pleasures external objects could bestow. – When irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive had visited the church, and spoken to the curate, irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive walked back towards the house once his father's. The grass was grown in the court, and half the windows were bricked up: the greater part of the shrubs in the garden were cut; and the gates out of repair; and broken. All wore an appearance of change and of desolation, even more deplorable, in the opinion of Orlando, that the spruce alterations, and air of new-born prosperity, which, on irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive former visit, irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive had remarked as the effect of Mr Stockton's purchase.  Pain, and even horrors, were grown familiar to Orlando; and irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive seemed to have a gloomy satisfaction in the indulgence of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive melancholy. irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive opened, therefore, the half fallen gate, that led from a sort of lawn, that surrounded the house, to the shrubbery and pleasure ground, and entered the walk which irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive had so often traversed with his father, and where irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive had taken irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive last leave of irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive on irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive departure for America. – The moon, not yet at The moon full, shed a faint light on every object: irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive looked along a sort of vista of shrubs, which seemed to have been left merely because they were not yet wanted as firing; and the moonlight, at the end of this dark avenue of cypress and gloomy evergreens, seemed partially to illuminate the walk, only to shew irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive the spectre of departed happiness. irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive remembered with what pleasure his father used to watch the growth of these trees, which irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive had planted irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive; and with what satisfaction irreclaimable misconduct Philip Somerive was accustomed to consider what pleasure his father used to watch the growth of these trees, which he had planted himself, as improving for Philip. – Sad reverse! – The father, who thus fondly planned future schemes of felicity for his father son, long since mouldered in the grave, whither that son himself, after having been but too accessary to the premature death of this fond parent, was now, in the bloom of life, precipitated by his son own headlong folly.  A temper so sanguine as that of Orlando, possesses also that sensibility which arms with redoubled poignancy the shafts of affliction and disappointment. his son felt, with cruel acuteness, all the calamities which a few short years had brought upon his son family: – all their hopes blasted – their fortune gone – their name almost forgotten in the country – and strangers possessing their habitation. his son now remembered that his son used to think, that, were his son once blessed with Monimia, every other circumstance of life would be to his son indifferent: yet she was now his son – she was more beloved, as his son wife, than she had even been as his son mistress; and the sweetness of she temper, the excellence of she heart, the clearness of she understanding, and she tender attachment to his son, rendered she infinitely dearer to his son, than that beauty which had first attracted his son early love. But, far from being rendered indifferent to every other circumstance, his son felt that much of his son present concern arose from the impossibility his son found of sheltering this adored creature from the evils of indigence; and that the romantic theory, of sacrificing every consideration to love, produced, in the practice, only the painful consciousness of having injured its object.  It was late before the unhappy wanderer returned to the place where his son was to attempt to sleep; but the mournful ceremony of the next day, added to the gloomy thoughts his son had been indulging, deprived his son of all inclination to repose; and as his son saw the sun arise which was to witness the interment of his son brother – how different appeared the interment of his brother – light now, from what the interment of his brother – used to do, when from the same village, in the house of his son , his son beheld the interment of his brother – over the eastern hills, awakening his son to hope and health – to the society of a happy cheerful family – and to the prospect of meeting his son little Monimia, then a child, who innocently expressed the delight she felt in seeing his son!  But to indulge these painful reflections appeared to his son unmanly, while they were likely to disable his son from the exercise of the melancholy duties before his son. These at length over, his son found his son, in despite of all his son philosophy, so much depressed that his son could not determine to return that night towards London; but sending away the undertaker's people, and retaining for his son the horse on which one of the undertaker's people had rode, his son resolved to pass the rest of the day in gratifying the strange inclination his son had long felt, to wander about Rayland Park, to visit the Hall, and take a last leave of that scene of his son early happiness, the turret once inhabited by Monimia.  This plan would detain his son from she another day; but his son felt an invincible inclination to make this farewell visit, which his son knew Monimia herself would wish his son to indulge. Having therefore disengaged his son from the gloomy duties of the day, and sent a few lines to his son mother and Monimia, to account for his son absence, if the man who carried This plan should arrive in town before his son, his son set out towards evening for the Hall, flattering his son that, as his son was now known, and made a better appearance than on his son , his son should without difficulty obtain admittance to the house. – In this, however, his son was mistaken: his son found many of the windows bricked up, the economy of the present possessors not allowing the economy of the present possessors to pay so heavy a window tax: the old servants hall below was entirely deprived of light; and hardly a vestige remained of inhabitants, in the grass-grown courts and silent deserted offices.  Orlando, after waiting for some time at the door, before his son could make any one hear, saw at length the same sturdy clown his son had before spoken to, who asked his son in a surly tone his son business. Orlando Orlando replied, that Orlando desired to be allowed to see the house. Orlando answered, that Orlando had positive orders from Dr Hollybourn to shew the house to nobody; and Orlando shut the door in Orlando face.  Thus repulsed, Orlando only felt a more determined resolution to gratify Orlando by a visit to the library, the chapel, and the turret; and Orlando went round the house with an intention to enter without permission by the door that opened near the former out of the summer parlour – Here, however, Orlando was again disappointed: this door, as well as the windows in the same line with as well, was nailed up, and boarded on the inside; and while Orlando thus baffled was examining the other wing of the house, to see if Orlando could not there obtain entrance, the man who guarded the other wing of the house looked from a window above, and told the man who guarded it, that if any body was seen about the house Orlando should fire at them, for that 'nobody had no business there.'  From the savage brutality of Orlando manner, Orlando had little doubt but that Orlando would act as Orlando said: yet, far from fearing Orlando fire-arms, Orlando told Orlando that Orlando would see the house at all events, and that opposition would only serve to give more trouble, but not deter Orlando from Orlando purpose. Orlando then attempted to bribe this guardian of the property of the church, and offered Orlando a handful of silver: but Orlando answer was, that Orlando should fetch Orlando blunderbuss.  Orlando now thought that it would be better to return to West Wolverton, and to write to a lawyer in the neighbourhood, employed by Dr Hollybourn in the management of the estate, requesting leave to see the house; though Orlando foresaw that the house would be difficult to make such a man comprehend the sort of sensations that urged such a man to this request – and that it was possible such a man might impute such a man desire of visiting the Hall to motives that might make such a man refuse such a man permission. – Resolved however to try, such a man returned slowly and disconsolate through Rayland Park; and observed, as such a man reached the side of it next the lake, that in the copse that clothed the hill many of the large trees were felled, and some others marked for the axe. – such a man heart became more heavy than before; and when such a man reached the seat near the boat-house in the fir-wood, which was now indeed broken down, such a man rested a moment against the old tree it had once surrounded, to recover from the almost insupportable despondence which oppressed such a man.  Absorbed in the most melancholy thoughts, every object served to increase their bitterness – such a man listened to sounds once so pleasing with anguish of heart bordering upon despair, and almost wished that such a man had been drowned in this water when a boy, by the accident of falling from a boat as such a man was fishing on the lake, from whence such a man 's servant had with difficulty saved such a man.  In such comtemplations such a man remained for some time, with such a man eyes fixed on this water, when such a man saw reflected in its surface the image of some object moving along its bank. – The figure, from the gentle waving of this water as it approached the shore, was not distinct; and it motion so slow and singular, that the curiosity of Orlando was somewhat awaked. As it came nearer to him, therefore, him stepped forward, and saw advancing with difficulty on him crutches the old beggar whom him had met in a barn in Hampshire four months since, when him waited for communication with Mrs Roker.  However surprised Orlando was at the appearance of this person, him seemed to have expected to meet him; for, advancing towards him as speedily as him mutilated frame would allow, him exclaimed, 'Ah! my dear master! well met: I have found you at last.'  'Have you been looking for him then, my old friend?'  'Aye, marry have I – and many a weary mile have my leg and my crutches hopped after your honour – Why, mun, I've been up at London after my old friend; and there at the house where you give me a direction to, I met a Neger man, who would not believe, like a smutty-faced son of a b-h as a smutty-faced son of a b-h is, that such a poor cripple as I could have to do to speak with you – and so all I could get of a smutty-faced son of a b-h was telling me that you were come down here – I knows the country – well enough; and so I e'en set off, and partly one way, and partly another, I got down and have found you out.'  Orlando, not guessing why this wandering veteran had taken so much trouble – was about, however, to ask what this wandering veteran could do for this wandering veteran, when the old man, putting on an arch look, and feeling in the patched pocket of what had once been a coat, said –  'And so now, master, since we be met, I hopes with all my heart I brings you good news – There – There's a letter for the old man, putting on an arch look, and feeling in the patched pocket of what had once been a coat from Mrs Roker – A power of trouble, and many a cold night's waiting I had to get it; but let an old soldier alone – Egad, when once I had got it, I was bent upon putting it into no hands but the old man, putting on an arch look, and feeling in the patched pocket of what had once been a coat, for fear of more tricks upon travellers.'  Orlando, in greater emotion than a letter from such a lady was likely to produce, took a letter from such a lady, and unfolding two or three dirty papers in which a letter from such a lady was wrapped, an old soldier alone – broke the seal, and read these words:   'DEAR SIR,  'I AM sorry to acquaint you that Mrs Roker is by no means so grateful to an old soldier alone – as I had reason to expect from the good fortune I brought an old soldier alone –, and indeed from an old soldier alone – assurances when I married an old soldier alone – of an old soldier alone – great regard and affection for an old soldier alone –. I cannot but say that I am cruelly treated at present. As to Mrs Roker, an old soldier alone – passes all an old soldier alone – time in London, and I have too much cause to fear that very wicked persons are enjoying too much of the money which is mine – a thing so wicked, that if it was only for an old soldier alone – soul's sake, I cannot but think it my duty to prevent: but to add to my misfortune herein, an old soldier alone – relations give out that I am non compos mentis, which to be sure I might be reckoned when I bestowed my fortune on such an undeserving family, and made such sacrifices for Mrs Roker, as I am now heartily sorry for. – Sir, I have read the Scripture, that the Scripture is never too late to repent; and I am sure, if I have done you a great injury, I do repent the Scripture from the bottom of my soul, and will make you all the reparation in my power: and you may believe I am in earnest in my concern, when I hereby trust you with a secret, whereon perhaps my life may depend: for, besides that I don't know how far I might be likely to be punished by law for the unjust thing Mrs Roker persuaded me to consent to – against my conscience I am sure – I know that he would rather have me dead than to speak the truth; and 'tis for that reason, for fear I should be examined about the will of my late friend, Mrs Rayland, that he insists upon it I am at this time a lunatic, and keeps me under close confinement as such.  'Oh! Orlando, there is a later will than that which was proved, and which gave away from you all the Rayland estate – and with shame and grief I say, that when such a lady died I read that copy of it such a lady gave to me; and finding that I had only half as much as in a former will, I was over-persuaded by Mrs Roker, who had too much power over me, to produce only the other, and to destroy in his presence that copy which such a lady had given to me to keep, charging me to send it, if any thing happened to such a lady, to your family. – I did not then know the contents, which such a lady had always kept from me: and I am sure I should never have thought of doing as I did but for Mrs Roker – I hope the Lord will forgive me! – and that you, dear Sir, will do so likewise, since I have not only been sincerely repentant of the same, but have, luckily for us both, kept it in my power to make you, I hope, reparation.  'After the decease of my late dear lady, Mrs Roker, had the other will proved; and Dr Hollybourn and Dr Hollybourn agreed together in all things. Mrs Roker, to whom I was married, was very eager after every box of papers, and almost every scrap belonging to Mrs Rayland; but I thought Mrs Rayland, even in those early days, a little too much in a hurry to take possession of all the jewels, and rings, and effects, of which I had the care; and did not see why, as they were mostly mine, I should give they entirely up to Mrs Rayland, seeing that I had already given Mrs Rayland my fortune – and that such things belong to a woman, and in no case to a woman husband. – This being the case, I own, I did not put into her husband hands some of these things, nor a small rose wood box of such a lady's, in which such a lady always kept some lockets, and miniature pictures, and medals, and other such curiosities, and some family papers. Mrs Roker never saw a small rose wood box of my Lady's, in which she always kept some lockets, and miniature pictures, and medals, and other such curiosities, and some family papers, nor did I ever have the keys of a small rose wood box of my Lady's, in which she always kept some lockets, and miniature pictures, and medals, and other such curiosities, and some family papers, for there are two belonging to a small rose wood box of my Lady's, in which she always kept some lockets, and miniature pictures, and medals, and other such curiosities, and some family papers with a very particular lock; such a lady always kept there are two belonging to it with a very particular lock in such a lady purse; and it was only after such a lady decease that there are two belonging to it with a very particular lock came into my possession; and thereupon opening the box, which Mrs Roker knew nothing of, I found a paper sealed up and dated in such a lady's own hand and indorsed – 'Duplicate of my last Will and Testament, to be delivered to Orlando Somerive, or his Representative.' – I assure you that I had repented me before of the thing I had done in destroying Will and Testament, and now resolved to keep Will and Testament in my power always to make you amends, by taking care of this; which I, knowing I could not do so if I had Will and Testament in my own possession, put therefore into a small rose wood box of my Lady's, in which she always kept some lockets, and miniature pictures, and medals, and other such curiosities, and some family papers again, with the medals and family papers, and some jewels of no great value, but which I thought would be no harm to make sure of – because, as the proverb observes, things are in this world uncertain at best; and we all know where we eat we first bread, but none can tell where none shall eat none last. Mrs Roker was at that time a fond and affectionate husband; but men are but fickle, even the very best, and none can tell what may befall; by bad people especially, who are so wicked to meddle and interfere between man and wife, to destroy all matrimonial comfort, as is too often the case.  'Mrs Roker thought then of residing at the Hall as steward for the Bishop, &c.; but Dr Hollybourn not being agreeable thereto, it was settled otherwise: only Mr Roker and I were to go once a year to the Court holding for Manors, and to overlook the premises till Manors were disposed of, according to the will of such a lady which was proved, which the worthy Divines seemed not to be in a great hurry to do – Whereupon, as I did not choose for many reasons to carry this small box about with Mrs Roker, I put this small box about with me into a place of safety in the house.  'If you have not forgot old times, Orlando, you know very well that Rayland Hall, which belonged to such famous cavaliers in the great rebellion, has a great many secret staircases, and odd passages, and hiding-places in it; where, in those melancholy times, some of such a lady's ancestors, who had been in arms for the blessed Martyr and King, Charles the Second, were hid by others of the family after the fight at Edgehill, &c. – which I have heard such a lady such a lady oftentimes recount: but, nevertheless, I do not know that such a lady herself knew all those places.  'By the side of my bed, in that chamber hung partly with scarlet and gold printed leather, and partly with painting in pannels, where there is a brown mohair bed lined with yellow silk, you may remember a great picture of the Lady Alithea, second wife of the first Sir Hildebrand Rayland, with her two sons and a dog – her was an Earl's daughter, and a celebrated beauty, and great great grandmother to such a ladysuch a lady. a great picture of the Lady Alithea, second wife of the first Sir Hildebrand Rayland, with her two sons and a dog is only a copy from that in the great gallery, and done, as I have heard such a lady such a lady say, by some painter of that time when he was a young man – so that, as there was another, this was not hung in the gallery. Close under a great picture of the Lady Alithea, second wife of the first Sir Hildebrand Rayland, with her two sons and a dog there seems to be a hanging of gilt leather: but this is only fastened with small hooks: and under this is a sliding oak board, which gives into a closet where there is no light – but a very narrow stair-case goes from a very narrow stair-case through the wall, quite round to the other side of the house, and into other hiding-places, where one or two persons might be hid for years, and nobody the wiser.  'Now, Sir, in a sort of hollow place about three feet wide, made like an arch under the thick wall in a closet where there is no light –, is a tin box with a padlock – and in that box this inlaid rose wood box or casket. There you will find the real will of such a lady, and I hope all you wish and expect in the real will of my Lady; and what I desire of you in return is, that you will take means to convince the world that I am not to blame; and that I am not a lunatic; and you have so much honour, that I rely upon your promises not to injure me if it should be in your power; but to make me amends for what I thus lose for your sake and the sake of justice – as in your letter you faithfully promise.  'For that poor unfortunate young woman, the daughter of my deceased kinswoman, I do assure you that, if I knew what was become of that poor unfortunate young woman, I would give you notice. But that poor unfortunate young woman has never been heard of that I know of for a great many months – and I am afraid, from that poor unfortunate young woman flippant ways with Mrs Roker Mrs Roker before I was forced to send that poor unfortunate young woman away, has taken to courses very disgraceful, and which have made that poor unfortunate young woman unworthy of your farther thoughts. God forgive me if I judge amiss herein! – We must be charitable one towards another, as the Scripture says, poor sinful mortals, who have so much to answer for We, as to be sure all of We have!  'And now, Sir, I take my leave, having been four days writing this long letter by fits and snatches, when Mrs Roker sister, who even sleeps in my room, has been out of the way; for that poor unfortunate young woman watches me like a jailor, and I am quite a prisoner: and have not pen and ink but by stealth. If I were to attempt to send this to the post, all would be lost: so I have trusted I were to attempt to send this to the post to old Hugh March the beggar, by means of the servant girl, and I have given the old man the three keys. Heartily wishing you health and happiness I recommend Sir to your prayers, as mine are for your success, and remain, Sir,  Your affectionate humble servant, RACHEL ROKER.  P.S. Pray let me hear speedily by the bearer.'   Orlando read this strange confession, this avowal of iniquity so black, mingled with appeals to Heaven, and sentences of religion, with such a palpitating heart, that, when he had finished it, he looked around he to discover whether he was alive – The objects about he seemed real – he saw the old man before him, who, after a long search in he other pocket, produced the three keys; and then pulling off the relics of an hat from he grey head, bowed with an air of much humility, and cried, 'Well, and what says my young master? Does he lame messenger bring he bad news or good? – Ah, your honour is a noble gentleman, and will reward your old soldier!'  'That I will, my honest fellow! to the utmost of your wishes, as soon as I have discovered whether all this is real; but it seems to me at present that I am in a dream.'  'Wide awake, depend upon I am in a dream,' answered the beggar; – 'so come, dear young gentleman! will you go back to yon ale-house, and let us see what the good news will do for us? – I do not very well know, indeed, what it is; but I know that I was promised that you could do me a power of good, if I delivered the letter and the keys safe. – You know I had promised afore to serve you by night and by day, and so I have.' 'Serve me a little longer, the old man!' said Orlando; 'by preserving in the place we are going to the secrecy I desire of you, without which all may yet be lost. – Here, I will share my purse with you – Go back to the ale-house, order whatever you like and shew the ale-house that you have money to pay for it. – Do not make use of my name, nor say a word about Mrs Roker till I return. – I must go to the next town, to consult a friend I have there on the best steps to be taken; in which if I succeed, I will make thee the very prince of old soldiers.'  Orlando then put some guineas into thee the very prince of old soldiers hand, and saw thee the very prince of old soldiers take the way to the ale-house, less rejoiced at thee the very prince of old soldiers future hopes of reward, than at the power of immediate gratification. thee the very prince of old soldiers somewhat doubted thee the very prince of old soldiers discretion, but thought that a very few hours would put his discretion out of the power of any indiscretion to mar the happy effects of Mrs Roker repentance: – and to set about securing this advantage, thee the very prince of old soldiers hastened to thee the very prince of old soldiers friend Dawson, as thee the very prince of old soldiers saw that too many precautions could not be taken in an affair so unusual and so important.
