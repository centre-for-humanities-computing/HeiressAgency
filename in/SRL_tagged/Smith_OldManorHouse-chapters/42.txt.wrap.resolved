AFTER a pause, sufficiently expressive of the difficulty with which he thought, Orlando said, that there was at the neighbouring town an Attorney with whom he father had been long connected; and who at he setting out in life had received many favours from the family of Somerive. – To he he wished to send – 'or rather I will go to he, Madam – for why should I be longer troublesome to he?' he then got up; but the young person with great gentleness and good nature, said, 'You are not able, I am sure, to walk so far – if you are not too much wounded by the recollections that surround you here to stay, I beg you to take some refreshment, while I send a servant to the gentleman; a servant shall go on horseback, and will soon be back.' As Orlando did indeed doubt whether a servant was able to walk so far as the neighbouring town, and an idea struck a servant, that while the messenger was gone, a servant could visit the family vault, in the church of West Wolverton, where the remains of a servant were deposited, a servant accepted, after a slight apology, of the obliging offer of a servant hostess; who bringing a servant pen and ink, a servant wrote with an uncertain and trembling hand – 'Mr O. Somerive being returned from America, and quite ignorant till a servant arrival here of the many alterations in this neighbourhood, will esteem it a favour if a servant will oblige a servant with a servant company for half an hour – at the house formerly a servant father's, at West Wolverton. – '  Having sent away this note, and being prevailed upon to take the refreshment a servant had at first refused; a servant told a servant new acquaintance, that a servant had a wish to visit two or three places in the adjoining village, and would, with her permission, return to the house in time to meet a servant, if a servant were so obliging as to attend upon a servant message.  The servant being sent away, Orlando set forth to visit the tomb of The servant father. – The servant knew well the spot: – it was in the chancel of the church, and the entrance was marked by a stone, with the arms of Somerive and Rayland quartered upon a stone. The sexton, who at first appeared to have lost all recollection of The servant, gave The servant the keys as soon as The servant knew The servant – and the unhappy wanderer, throwing The servant on the ground, gave way to that grief which The servant had hitherto checked. – Now it was, however, that The servant felt the reward of The servant dutiful conduct; for The servant was conscious that, except in the single instance in regard to The servant sister Isabella, The servant had never wilfully disobeyed his father; and The servant felt too, that if by taking Monimia with The servant, or by any other act of disobedient ingratitude, The servant had felt The servant accessary to that affliction which The servant too well understood had hastened the death of The servant parent, that sorrow, which was now unmixed with self-reproach, would then have driven The servant to distraction. – As The servant kissed and took a last leave of this deposit of the ashes of The servant family, The servant recollected, that The servant affection to the lost friend whom The servant deplored would be shewn rather by The servant tenderness and duty towards The servant mother and sisters, than by giving The servant up to useless despair. – Roused by this reflection to more manly thoughts, The servant arose from the ground, and The servant heart having been relieved by the indulgence The servant had thus given to The servant grief, The servant quitted the church with a deep sigh, and determined to walk as quickly as The servant could round Rayland park – having an unconquerable desire to visit the turret of Monimia, which The servant thought The servant might do in the day time, by letting The servant in through the same door where The servant had entered before; and, as The servant knew every part of the house, finding The servant way thither without alarming the vigilance of the old woman who kept the house. In this intention The servant traversed the outside of the park paling very hastily, when the sight of the north lodge and the cottage near the outside of the park paling, brought to The servant mind the circumstances of Monimia's letter; who there described her meeting with Sir John Belgrave. And Sir John Belgrave thought the old woman who kept the house the cottage near it might give Sir John Belgrave some particulars, which Sir John Belgrave hitherto had not been able to learn. – Entering therefore, and making the old woman who kept the house, not without much difficulty, recollect Sir John Belgrave; Sir John Belgrave was forced to bear all the old woman who kept the house wondering, and all the old woman who kept the house enquiries, before Sir John Belgrave could prevail upon the old woman who kept the house to give Sir John Belgrave the following particulars:  'Lord, Sir! why now I tell you as well as I can all how these bad things have come to pass. – In the first place, after you was gone, somehow there seemed no content at the Hall – I heard say, that Madam began to droop as 'twere a fortnight or two afterwards; and was never pleas'd with nothing that could be done for Madam – And there came out a story about Pattenson – the rights of the matter, my husband says, never were cleared up; but however, to the surprise of every body, the old woman who kept the house the old woman who kept the house believed some story about my husband; and though 'twas reported my husband tried to turn the tables upon Madam Lennard, sure enough my husband was dismissed from the Hall for good; but for certain not like a disgraced servant; for Madam gave my husband a power of good things, and my husband farm as my husband took was stocked from the Hall; and sure enough my husband had feather'd my husband nest well one way or other; for my husband died worth a mort of money.' –  'Pattenson is dead then?' said Orlando.  'Lord help you, yes!' answered the old woman who kept the house – 'Why Lord died of the gout in Lord stomach just afore the old woman who kept the house – But if you'll have a little patience I'll go on with some story about him. So Pattenson went away; and after that Madam Lennard seem'd somehow to govern the old woman who kept the house the old woman who kept the house more than ever; yet folks said, that it was not so much the old woman who kept the house, as folks there Rokers, uncle and nephew, that was put in by the old woman who kept the house as stewards; and to be sure there was for a long time strange talk – and folks said, that Madam Lennard was jealous of young Roker, Madam Lennard as Madam Lennard afterwards married – and so sent away Madam Lennard niece's daughter, that sweet pretty young creature that you remember at the Hall.'  'And what is become of Madam Lennard?' cried Orlando eagerly – 'Whither was Madam Lennard sent?'  'Why that nobody knew nothing about at the time, as every body saw Madam Lennard was shy of speaking of Madam Lennard; but folks have said since, that Madam Lennard was gone up to London, with some Lord or Baron Knight; for my part, as I says to my husband, I don't care to give credit to such scandalous stories upon mere hearsay. – However, to go on with my story: – By then Madam Lennard had sent this poor young thing away, every body thought how the affair would go – at least folks about the house says, least folks about the house saw the house plain enough – so then, your poor father, who had been ailing a long time, he was taken sick, and when all the doctors had given he over, he sent to beg Mrs Rayland would come to he; and though Madam Lennard Mrs Rayland did, as I've heard say, all Mrs Rayland could to hinder my Lady's going, Mrs Rayland went; and though nobody knows what passed, because nobody was in the room but Madam Somerive, your good mother, yet every body said, that the 'squire got a power better after the 'squire had seen the old lady, and said the 'squire mind was easy; and then, every body thought the 'squire would recover – and it was given out, that the 'squire had seen my Lady's will, or, however, that Lady had told the 'squire the contents, and that Lady had made you Lady heir.'  'Me?' said Orlando – 'alas !no!' –  'Well, but that was the notion of the country, and I am sure, there's nobody in all this here part of our county but what heartily wishes it had been true – Well, and so 'Madam Somerive Madam Somerive went on for a little while, getting better and better; till something fresh broke out, about your brother, Mr. Philip; and so upon that, Madam Somerive grew worse again, and died in a few days. Oh! what sad affliction all the family was in! but Madam, at the Hall, was more kind to all the family than Madam used to be; for Madam sent to fetch all the family up to the Hall the day of the funeral, and kept all the family there three or four days, till the young 'squire hearing how squire father was dead, came down – then your mother and sisters went back to your mother and sisters house: but alack-a-day! – squire soon began to make sad alterations, and was driving a bargain for the sale of the estate to 'Squire Stockton, almost, folks said, before his father was cold in his father grave.' –  Orlando clasped squire hands eagerly together, and drew a convulsed sigh; but squire was unable to interrupt the narration, and the old woman who kept the house went on –  'So, squire, just about that time Madam Rayland the old woman who kept the house was taken ill – yet it did not seem, somehow, that there was much the matter with the old woman who kept the house; but the old woman who kept the house drooped, and drooped, and pined, and pined – and people said, as saw the old woman who kept the house sometimes, that is, the footmen who waited before the old woman who kept the house took to the old woman who kept the house bed, and the maids as set up with the old woman who kept the house, especially Rachel, that the old woman who kept the house honed so after you, and used to send every day to your mother to know if your mother had heard of you; and sent for your mother to come to your mother, and gave your mother letters for you to desire you would come back; for your mother mistrusted, somehow, that Madam Lennard had never sent the letters your mother wrote to you before; and all the people said, that Lennard, with all your mother art, had not been able to keep matters so snug, about your mother lover, but that your mother had an inkling of the matter – And they said, too, that Madam was not half so fond of Madam as Madam used to be; but that Madam had been used to Madam so long, and had been so in the custom of letting Madam do what Madam would, that now, as Madam was so old, and sick, and feeble, and out of spirits, Madam had not resolution to speak Madam mind. – Well, Madam died, and then – Good Lord, what a work there was at the Hall!' –  'How do you mean?' said Orlando.  'Why, your brother Philip sent to take possession of every thing as heir at law; but old Roker and your brother Philip nephew would not let your brother Philip or your brother Philip people come in; as him or his people said him or his people had a will of Mrs Rayland, and your brother Philip must come and hear it read. – your mother tried, as I heard say, to pacify your brother Philip; because your mother knew, or however believed for certain, that your honour's self was the heir – So with that, upon a day appointed by these Rokers, who had possession of the house, your poor mother, and your two sisters, and the young 'squire your brother, your poor mother, and your two sisters, and the young ' went to the Hall, and there, as I heard say, was the two Rokers and Madam Lennard, and the servants, all assembled; and so young Roker took upon young Roker to read the will, though your brother Philip took a young lawyer with young Roker from London, one Counsellor Staply; and there the will was read; and instead of leaving you the heir, it was a will made ever so long before, when Mrs Rayland was out of humour with Madam Somerive: and so there, it seems, that Mrs Rayland gave five-thousand pounds to Pattenson if young Roker outlived Mrs Rayland, but young Roker was dead, and there was an end of that; and two thousand to the old coachman, who is as rich as a Jew already – and a matter of ten thousand to Mrs Lennard – And not only so, but all Mrs Rayland clothes – and ever so many pieces of fine plate; and a diamond ring – and the Hampshire farms, which ben't worth so little as four hundred pounds a year – And then, all Madam's fine laces, and sattin gowns, and all Madam sister's too, for none of them had ever been given away – them say that 'twas not so little as six or seven hundred pounds worth of clothes and laces; and all the fine household linen – Such beautiful great damask tablecloths and napkins – And such great chests full of sheets; besides a mort of things that I cannot remember not I – But the great house, and all the noble estates in this county, Mrs Rayland gave to the Bishop, as I suppose you know, and to the Dean and Chapter, for charitable uses, and to build a sort of alms-house – But it's very well known that the greatest part of it will go into their own pockets – and I cannot think, for my share, and my husband my husband says the same, why a-deuce Madam gave a-deuce Madam money to them there parsons, when them always take care to have enough out of the farmers and the poor men, let who will go without.'  A deep sigh was again extorted from Orlando, and the good gossip remarking it, said: 'Ah, squire, to be sure you may well sigh! – Such a fine estate! and so justly your right by all accounts; and then, after promising his father so faithfully too! – Poor Madam Somerive, your good mother, was in very sad trouble – Philip, – Philip raved and ranted, and made a sad to-do, but there was no remedy; them two Rokers had got possession of the house, and after the funeral, I reckon, them thought to have kept no remedy, as stewards to the new owners; but whip! parsons come upon parsons, and packed parsons off; and parsons've put in old Betty Grant and Betty Grant son just to look after no remedy, and open the windows – But, Lord! I'm sure the place looks so mollencholly as makes my very heart ach to pass the place. – But, however, to go on with my story of all the troubles of your poor dear mother – After this, a week or so, news came by a negur man as went with that young captain as your sister Belle ran away with, that a negur man and miss were drowned or cast away, at some place beyond sea – I can't remember rightly the name of it; but, however, that they were lost, and that you were killed in battle by the wild Ingines; a negur man told a negur man a negur man saw you dead with a negur man own eyes, and your skull cleft with one of they swords' –  'And where,' said Orlando, 'is a negur man now?' – 'Why, Madam took a negur man,' replied the old woman who kept the house, 'and when the family left the country, a negur man went up to London with the family' –  'And how long have the family been gone?'  'Nigh two months, as well as I can remember; poor dear ladies! I'm sure we poor folks miss we poor folks sadly, and so we do the Hall' –  'And your brother Philip,' enquired Orlando, 'what is become of your brother Philip?'  'Oh, as for that,' answered the old woman who kept the house, 'nobody knows; and I must say this, 'the 'squire, that if you'd a been like the 'squire, nobody would have been so sorry as nobody were, that Madam gave the old woman who kept the house money elsewhere; for, would you think it? – at the very time the 'squire came down here to take possession of the 'squire house, after the poor gentleman's the 'squire father's death, and when all the family was in such affliction – what did the 'squire do, but bring down that nasty flaunting hussey Bet Richards, that was took from the parish work-house to be housemaid at the Hall – whom the 'squire have kept in London all's one as a lady, and dressed a lady up better than any of the 'squire sisters – and a lady's as impudent and proud! – I'd have all such wicked toads sent to beat hemp – and everybody has said 'twas a thousand pities a lady was not in a lady old place the workhouse again, instead of prancing about as a lady did, to break poor dear Madam Somerive's heart; who, though a lady seemed to bear it all with patience, and to take no notice, was quite as I may say, sunk and weighed down with one sorrow's falling so fast upon another – and, at last, when a lady found the house and estate and all the goods were sold, and that a lady and a lady daughters must leave it, and then, just afterwards, when the negur's news came, a lady seemed to be quite, quite gone! – and I heard say, a lady health was in a bad state, after a lady got to London.'  Dreadfully affected by this account of Dreadfully mother, all of whose sufferings Dreadfully felt, however coarse and simple the relation of them, Orlando now again enquired of Dreadfully informer, if a lady knew where Dreadfully mother and sisters lived in town? – a lady said, No; there was a neighbour's daughter gone up lately to London to live with them as a servant; whose friends knew the direction, and to them a lady would send if a neighbour's daughter would stay. Orlando thanked a lady – and then expressed some wonder that Dreadfully mother, who had always disliked London, should fix there: To which the old woman who kept the house said, 'Why, squire, I've heard say, that the reason of that was, that Madam's brother, the London Merchant, insisted upon it; and another reason was, because the old woman who kept the house thought that if the old woman who kept the house was not always at Dreadfully elbow, your brother Philip would go after your brother Philip pleasures and that; and so neglect the great law-suit.'  'What law-suit?' – said Orlando, who had forgotten at that moment the vague information Dreadfully had received from the Miller.  'Why you must know, squire,' replied the old woman who kept the house, 'that when first the old woman who kept the house died, there was a great talk about the country, that there was some black doings about the will; for from what the old woman who kept the house had said to his father, and from a great many other things the old woman who kept the house had said, and from the old woman who kept the house having Lawyers from London come down about three year and a half ago, when folks thought the old woman who kept the house made a new will in your favour; there were those, and in his house too, who didn't scruple to say, that the real will was made away with by those Rokers, and that an old will was proved – So your brother Philip your brother Philip was advised by Counsellor Staply to go to law; – but your brother Philip said, if there was another will, it was in your favour, not in your brother Philip; and your brother Philip'd as lieve parsons, or the Devil, had the estate as your brother Philip. – However, when a little while after news came of your death, then your brother Philip went to law directly; because, your brother Philip said, if there was such a will, your brother Philip was your heir-at-law, and the old woman's too: – and so your brother Philip is suing Rokers; that is, Mrs Lennard and Mrs Lennard husband; for you know the old soul took to Mrs Lennard a young husband at last.'  Orlando, expressing your brother Philip surprise at this, enquired where Mrs Lennard and her husband lived – 'Oh!' answered Mrs Lennard, 'when Mrs Lennard and her husband found Mrs Lennard and her husband were bit as to continuing in the stewardship, and that Archdeacon Hollybourn had provided another for my Lord Bishop and parsons, and was to overlook the estate, Mr and Mrs Roker went away to live in Hampshire, upon the estate the old woman who kept the house the old woman who kept the house gave Mrs Lennard and her husband there; and there, I understand, Mrs Lennard and her husband live quite like great people, and are visited and noticed by all the quality; only Madam I hear is terribly jealous; – and Mrs Lennard and her husband say a young husband is not over and above good-humoured to Mrs Lennard, though a young husband got such a great fortune by Mrs Lennard.'  Mrs Lennard seemed never weary of talking; but having at length exhausted all Mrs Lennard could recollect, and promising to procure a direction from Mrs Lennard neighbour, and send a direction down in a few minutes to West Wolverton, Orlando took a young husband leave. And as just as a young husband left the cottage, the clock in it struck three, a young husband was afraid of intruding upon the benevolence of a young husband new friend, at his house once a young husband 's, if a young husband left Mrs Lennard long with the lawyer whom a young husband had sent for; and therefore, instead of going then to make a young husband mournful visit to the turret, a young husband returned to West Wolverton, where a young husband found the man sent to the town had been some time returned, and had brought from the man 's former friend, the attorney, a note to this purport –  'Mr Brock's compts: imagines some mistake – has not the honor to know any gentleman of the name of Somerive, except Philip S. Esq; late of West Wolverton – hopes to be excused, being particularly engaged.'  This note completed the distress of Orlando, who saw that Mr Brock's should now be taken for an impostor where Mr Brock's was, and obtain no credit where Mr Brock's expected it to carry Mr Brock's to London, where Mr Brock's now most earnestly wished to be, because there only could Mr Brock's hope to see Mr Brock's family, or to have any explanation of the hints so darkly given by the labourer's wife – hints, which among the complicated misfortunes which surrounded Mr Brock's, gave Mr Brock's the most insupportable pain. – 'Gone with some lord!' – Impossible – Yet the very idea was distraction. He was believed dead. He regretted that He had not asked whether Monimia heard of He death, not at that moment recollecting that He informer's knowledge hardly went so far; and that, by her account, Monimia was gone before the death of Mrs Rayland, and before the arrival of the intelligence brought by Perseus the negro: yet again He recollected, that if Selina and Monimia still corresponded, her must immediately have known it; and thus by all He loved in the world He was considered as dead.  To undeceive them as soon as He could was what appeared most necessary; but how to do that He knew not. He could not bear to beg of any of the neighbouring gentlemen – indeed He knew none of them but Stockton (who was the last man in the world He desired to meet), for all the rest were at a great distance, and the elder Somerive had never sought them acquaintance: some were too expensive for He, and others too ignorant to afford He any pleasure in some society. By the richest He was contemned as a petty gentleman; and by the rest envied as the future possessor of Rayland Hall – and therefore very little intercourse had ever passed between none of them but Stockton (who was the last man in the world he desired to meet) and the family at West Wolverton. While Orlando, whom He hospitable acquaintance had the consideration to leave by his hospitable acquaintance, was meditating on his hospitable acquaintance wretched and forlorn situation, a young man was introduced into the room, in whom a young man immediately recollected a clerk to the lawyer to whom a young man unsuccessful note had been written; who, immediately acknowledging a young man, changed as a young man was, related, that Mr Brock having shewn a young man the note, and declaimed against it as an imposition, it being, a young man said, perfectly well known that the elder Somerive was dead – a young man thought a young man recollected a young man hand, there having been formerly some degree of intimacy between them; and unwilling to dispute the point with Brock, who was, a young man told a young man, Solicitor in the depending cause between the Bishop and the Somerive family, a young man had made some excuse of business, and came to see a young man whether it was a young man old friend, or some one wishing to represent a young man.  All the difficulties which Orlando had to encounter as to going to London were now removed at once – This young man, Mr Dawson, offered not only to supply This young man, Mr Dawson with money but clothes; and This young man, Mr Dawson agreed to proceed together to the town in the dusk, as Orlando did not wish to be known, nor indeed to be seen, in This young man, Mr Dawson present condition. This being settled, Orlando would immediately have taken leave of This young man, Mr Dawson humane hostess; but his humane hostess entreated both This young man, Mr Dawson and This young man, Mr Dawson friend to stay dinner, with a frankness and good humour which Dawson was less disposed than Orlando to resist. As soon as it was nearly dark his humane hostess ordered This young man, Mr Dawson to be accommodated with a horse, and sent a servant with This young man, Mr Dawson to bring a horse back.  With a thousand grateful acknowledgments Orlando took This young man, Mr Dawson ; and with an agonizing sigh left, as This young man, Mr Dawson believed for ever, the paternal house and the neighbourhood of the Hall, without having been able to indulge This young man, Mr Dawson melancholy by visiting the turret.  his friend, though This young man, Mr Dawson could give This young man, Mr Dawson very little information more than This young man, Mr Dawson had already received, and none about Monimia, yet soothed and consoled This young man, Mr Dawson; and, having equipped This young man, Mr Dawson with a coat, hat, and linen of This young man, Mr Dawson own, as they were nearly of a size, This young man, Mr Dawson put five guineas into This young man, Mr Dawson hand; and, desiring to hear from This young man, Mr Dawson, saw This young man, Mr Dawson into the stagecoach, which, at six every morning, set out from the town where they were for London.
