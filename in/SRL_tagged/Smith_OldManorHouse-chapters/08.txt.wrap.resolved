MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife, and many consultations with MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife wife, at length determined to write to Mrs Rayland: it was indeed necessary to pay Mrs Rayland the compliment of consulting Mrs Rayland on the marriage of MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife daughter; and MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife thought it not an improper opportunity to try what were Mrs Rayland intentions in regard to Orlando, by hinting, that an occasion now offered to establish MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife advantageously in trade.  The arguments of Mr Woodford had not on this point so much influence as to prevent MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife fearing the experiment MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife was about to make; but the conduct of MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife eldest son, which nothing could restrain, made MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife look forward with fear to the future. MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife found MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife own health very much injured by the uneasiness MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife had lately undergone; and MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife knew that, should MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife die, the only dependence of his wife and MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife unmarried daughters must be on Orlando, and on the friendship of Mr Woodford. To put MR SOMERIVE, after many debates with himself, and many consultations with his wife son therefore into business with his son 's brother was certainly a very desirable plan, if Mrs Rayland did not intend better to provide for his son; and it was certainly time to know whether Mrs Rayland had or had not any such intentions in Mrs Rayland favour.  The letter then which Orlando so dreaded, was written, after great precautions in choosing the words. The letter then which Orlando so dreaded, was written, after great precautions in choosing the words requested Mrs Rayland approbation of his eldest daughter's marriage with Mr Fitz-Owen, the only son of an eminent merchant at Corke; and said, that as Orlando was now of an age in which it became necessary to think of his future establishment, thoughts were entertained of putting his into business with his uncle; but that nothing would be concluded upon without the entire approbation of Mrs Rayland, to whose notice and protection his was so much obliged.  A servant was sent with this letter about noon. this letter was received and read in due form, and a verbal message returned, that Mrs Rayland would at Mrs Rayland leisure write an answer, and send one of Mrs Rayland own servants with it.  On this occasion Mrs Rayland talked to Lennard – not to consult Mrs Rayland, for it was an affair in which Mrs Rayland thought Mrs Rayland alone competent to judge – but to give vent to Mrs Rayland spleen, and to express Mrs Rayland dislike of all people in trade, and particularly of poor Mrs Somerive. 'Those vulgar mundungus folks,' said Mrs Rayland, 'will not suffer the family to better by the family chance connection with a gentleman – let the family marry the family girls, if the family will, to dealers and chapmen; I shall never interfere: the family are all like the mother, and may make good tradesmen's wives; though, if poor Mrs Somerive had not, like poor Mrs Somerive foolish father, had a low taste, poor Mrs Somerive daughters might have married men of family, who would have been proud to be allied, though distantly, to ours. As it is, men of family, who would have been proud to be allied, though distantly, to ours must carry men of family, who would have been proud to be allied, though distantly, to ours cherry cheeks to a lower market – I shall never oppose it. But for Orlando, there was something of an air of good blood about him, that almost made me doubt at times him birth by him mother's side. However, if him gets these buying and selling notions in him head, and chooses his mother's low origin should continue to be remembered, I have done. I suppose him's got among them – a fine flashy set of tradesfolks – and enters into them amusements and views; and if so, I shall never disturb him, let him go him own way; only I shall not choose to have a shopkeeper an inmate at Rayland Hall.'  Monimia, who was called down a moment before to assist in cutting out linen, was present during this harangue, for them considered a shopkeeper an inmate a mere cypher. a shopkeeper an inmate found a shopkeeper an inmate terribly affected by the opening of it; but when it proceeded to speak of Orlando, a shopkeeper an inmate measured four times instead of two, notched a piece of Irish cloth in the wrong place, and was beginning to use a shopkeeper an inmate scissars the wrong way, when a severe look from Mrs Lennard, who snatched it out of a shopkeeper an inmate hand, with 'What are you about, mope?' restored a shopkeeper an inmate to a shopkeeper an inmate recollection. a shopkeeper an inmate begged pardon; and another look from a shopkeeper an inmate aunt bade a shopkeeper an inmate beware that a shopkeeper an inmate did not offend a second time – when Mrs Rayland thus went on:  'After a taste for such company, this place must be very dull: drinking and jollity, I suppose, are soon learned. And so Orlando has not been here these two days! Mighty well; Orlando is Orlando own master – Lennard! Orlando has not called this morning, has Orlando?'  Monimia, by a glance of Monimia eye, saw Orlando at that moment pensively and dejectedly crossing the park on foot. Monimia dared not however say so; but finding Monimia quite unequal to the misery of being present at an interview, in which Monimia foresaw that, in consequence of this fatal letter, Orlando would be forbidden the house, and seeing that Monimia determined Monimia should stay, her aunt hung her aunt foot as if by accident in the long roll of linen that was on the ground, and, in pretending to disengage it, fell with some violence against an old heavy gilt leather screen that went across one side of the large room, and ran the sharp-pointed scissars, with which her aunt was cutting the linen, into her aunt arm a little above the wrist.  her aunt, however, did not perceive it, till the blood streamed from her arm, round which, without any complaint, her aunt wrapped her aunt handkerchief. The paleness and faintness, which her aunt could not disguise, were accounted for when Mrs Lennard saw her handkerchief bathed in blood. Monimia, who was actually sinking to the earth, though not from the wound, was then dismissed, while Betty was called to take care of the careless girl, and ordered to put some friar's balsam to the cut; and the careless girl just tottered out of one door as Orlando, after sending up for permission, entered at the other. This was fortunate; for, had he beheld the careless girl in such a situation, and had the careless girl at that moment seen he, their intelligence could hardly have been concealed. The looks Mrs Lennard had cast on the careless girl, when the careless girl first appeared confused, had impressed the careless girl with terror, and, the careless girl fancied, menaced all that was dreadful. With difficulty, and leaning on Betty's arm, the careless girl reached the careless girl turret; where, under pretence that the accident of having hurt Betty's arm had turned the careless girl sick, the careless girl begged a glass of water, and lay down, being otherwise unable to conceal from Betty the agitation of the careless girl spirits, and the terror the careless girl was in for the reception of Orlando.  Mrs Rayland, instead of the kindness the careless girl was used to shew him, now received him with the most cold and repulsive formality. 'Your servant, Mr Orlando – Please to take a chair,' was all the careless girl said; and in the manner of the careless girl saying it, Orlando saw abundant cause to fear that Orlando father's letter had undone Orlando with Mrs Rayland.  'I find we are to lose you, Orlando! – you are going to turn merchant, or shop-keeper!'  'Not, Madam,' replied Orlando, 'if you think my doing so a wrong measure.'  'Oh! Orlando, I never pretend to dictate. Every one knows their own affairs best; and by all means you ought to follow your father's orders and your own inclinations.'  'Alas, dear Madam!' replied Orlando, with a sort of spirited humility that well became him, 'his father's orders would, I believe, in this case be given with reluctance; and though I should obey reluctance, it would be with reluctance indeed!'  'What, Orlando! (relaxing a little of her vinegar aspect) is it not your own desire then that you should be put apprentice or journeyman to this person, this brother of your mother's? I thought, for my part, that finding perhaps, like your brother and other gay young men, that the country was very dull, you chose probably to figure in London; for it is trades-people now that can best afford to shew away, as witness the new comers at poor Lord Carloraine's fine place – those what d'ye callums – they were trades-people – yet nobody can attempt to live as they do. If such things can be done by trade, no wonder young men are eager to begin. The Hall, Mr Orlando, must be a dull place, when once you have got these fine doings in your head.'  'dear Madam,' said Orlando trembling, for he now found that he fate depended on the event of this dialogue – 'Madam, I have always avoided the meanness of adulation, nor will I use the meanness of adulation now; you ought to despise me if I did; and I know you have generosity enough to have bestowed all the favours I have received from you, without expecting me to sacrifice my integrity or my freedom.'  Mrs Rayland did not very clearly comprehend this sentence. this sentence was partly complimentary, and therefore to Mrs Rayland taste; but the words sacrifice and freedom, at the end, on which a strong emphasis was laid, sounded a little like rebellion. Mrs Rayland therefore screwed up Mrs Rayland visage to her visage former asperity, and answered, 'No, indeed, Orlando, I expect no sacrifices from any body; and as to freedom – every body is free to do as they like best in they own affairs, as I told you before.'  'You will not then, dear Madam, suspect me of meanness unworthy equally of my respect for you and what I owe dear Madam, if I declare to you, that I have no wish to enter into trade, for which I am very certain I have no talents; and that, though I must obey his father if his father insists upon it, yet I shall be very unhappy, and had rather, infinitely rather, if you will have the goodness to permit it, remain at home, with the advantage of being allowed sometimes, in paying my respects to you, to have, as I have had for some months, the use of your library; where I hope I am qualifying dear Madam for one of the liberal professions against the time when his father can find an opportunity to place me in one: and in the mean time I call God to witness, that to associate with such people as Mr Stockton, or to emulate God splendour, is so far from being my wish, that to be compelled to do it would be the greatest punishment that could be inflicted upon dear Madam.'  'I believe, OrlandoOrlando, I believe – and I am pleased to see it – you have some understanding; and indeed, young man, I think too well of young man to wish to see you a tradesman.' 'Orlando,' were, Orlando well knew, words that always portended good humour, and were never used but on days of high favour. They now sounded most soothingly in the ears of Orlando. – 'Will you then, dear Madam, be so very good, when you take the trouble to answer his father's letter, to express your sentiments on this matter? and I am sure his father will then press it no farther.'  'I shall tell his father, child,' replied child, 'that I think you may do better; and for the present, as you are not idle, that you may go on with your studies at the Hall.'  Orlando, in raptures at having carried his father point, thanked his father venerable cousin a thousand times. his father never thought his venerable cousin so reasonable before: his venerable cousin never fancied his father so much like his venerable cousin grandfather Sir Orlando; and so many civilities passed between them, that, before them parted, his venerable cousin gave his father a bank-note of ten pounds, and his father was admitted to the honour of kissing his venerable cousin hands. In this excellent humour, which Mrs Lennard did not discourage, Mrs Lennard left his venerable cousin, went into the study to secure Mrs Lennard admittance in the evening, and to recover Mrs Lennard of the extreme perturbation Mrs Lennard was in, before Mrs Lennard returned to the party with whom Mrs Lennard was to dine at home.  Mrs Rayland then, having called for Mrs Rayland writing materials, which seldom saw the sun, and being placed in form at Mrs Rayland rose-wood writing-box, lined with green velvet and mounted in silver, produced, at the end of four hours, the following letter, piquing Mrs Rayland on spelling as Mrs Rayland father spelt, and disdaining those idle novelties by which a few superfluous letters are saved.   Raylande Hall, 12th day of September, A.D. 1776.  'Sir, my kinsman,  'I HAVE received youre letter, and am oblidged by Sir, my kinsmanre taking the troubbel to informe me of Sir, my kinsmanre famely affaires, to the wich I am a sinceer goode wisher. In respecte to youre daughter Philippa must begge to be excused from givving my oppinion, not haveing the pleasure to knowe the gentleman, and being from my retired life no judge of the personnes charractere, who are remote and in bisness, as I understande this personne is; wherefore I can onelye there upon saie, that doubtlesse you, being as you are a goode and carefulle father, will take due care and precaution that youre daughtere shall not, by Philippa marriage, be exposed to the mischances of becoming reduced by bankruptcies and other accidents, whereby peopel in trade are oft times grate sufferers. – But your care herein for your daughter's securitye is not to be questionned. Furthermore, respecting youre youngest sonne, Orlando, he is very certainelye at youre disposal also, and you are, it may be, the most competent judge of that which is fitting to bee done for the most competent judge of that which is fitting to bee future goode and advantage. I wish the most competent judge of that which is fitting to bee very well; the most competent judge of that which is fitting to bee seeming to me to be a sober, promising, and well-conditioned youthe; and such a one as, were I the most competent judge of that which is fitting to bee neerer relation, I shoulde thinke a pitye to put to a trade. I am at present alwaies glad of the most competent judge of that which is fitting to bee companie at the Hall, and willinge to give anye littel encourragement to the most competent judge of that which is fitting to bee desier of learninge in the liberal sciences fitting for a gentleman, the wich the most competent judge of that which is fitting to bee entring on a shoppe or warehouse would distroye and put an ende to. However that maye bee, I saie again, that you, being an ende father, are to be sure the propperest personne to determine for an ende, and an ende is dutiefullie inclined, and willinge to obey you. Yet by the discourse I have had with an ende there-uponne, it doth not appeare that the youthe himself is inclined to become a dealer, as you purpose.  'Heartilie recommending you in my prayers to the Disposer of all goode giftes, and hoping Heartilie will directe you in all thinges for the well-doing of your famely, I remaine,  Sir, my kinsman, youre well-wisher and humbel servant, GRACE RAYLANDE.'   my father's letter was received at Wolverton while Mr Somerive, his two sons, Mr Woodford and Mr Fitz-Owen were yet over Mr Somerive, his two sons, Mr Woodford and Mr Fitz-Owen wine. his father opened my father's letter with a palpitating heart, nor were the younger part of the audience less solicitous to know my father's letter contents. As there were none of them towards whom secrecy was absolutely necessary, though it might have been more prudent, Mr Somerive, at the request of Mr Somerive eldest son, put it across the table to his eldest son – who, with that thoughtless indiscretion which marked his eldest son character, read it aloud, with comments serving to turn into ridicule the writer, and the sentiments the writer contained. The description of Orlando – under that of a sober, promising, and well-conditioned youth – was read with a burst of laughter; while the slighting way in which trade was mentioned, and the contempt thrown on shopkeepers, under which Mrs Rayland seemed to describe wine-merchants and every person in business, raised the indignation of Mr Woodford and Mr Fitz-Owen, who both agreed in declaring that the opinion of such an old crone was not worth consulting; that such an old crone was in a perfect dotage, as well from pride as old age; and that it was a condescension in Mr Somerive to have consulted such an old crone at all. Orlando, however, saw all this with concern mingled with joy. Orlando was pretty sure, from the countenance of Orlando father, which Orlando solicitously watched as Orlando perused my father's letter, that The description of Orlando – under that of a sober, promising, and well-conditioned youth – was read with a burst of laughter; while the slighting way in which trade was mentioned, and the contempt thrown on shopkeepers, under which Mrs Rayland seemed to describe wine-merchants and every person in business, raised the indignation of Mr Woodford and Mr Fitz-Owen, who both agreed in declaring that the opinion of such an old crone was not worth consulting; that she was in a perfect dotage, as well from pride as old age; and that it was a condescension in Mr Somerive to have consulted her at all. The displeasure of Orlando brother at the partiality Mrs Rayland expressed for Orlando was easily accounted for; and Orlando had long accustomed Orlando to bear Orlando rough jokes, and even Orlando sarcastic reproaches, which Orlando vented whenever they met, without much uneasiness.  As soon as Mr Somerive could disengage Orlando from Orlando company, Orlando withdrew to consult with Orlando wife on the purport of Mrs Rayland letter, and made a sign to Orlando to follow Orlando in a few moments. – Orlando did so, and found Orlando father and mother in consultation in the garden. The mother, whose heart was half broken at the idea of parting with his wife daughter so suddenly, was weeping with joy to find that Orlando would not yet leave her daughter: flattering her daughter, from the purport of my father's letter, that the affluent fortune of Mrs Rayland would at last centre with Orlando, and putting the most favourable construction on every expression that related to Orlando, her daughter agreed with Mr Somerive, that nothing would be so imprudent as to think of removing Mr Somerive; and it was even determined, that Mr Somerive should that evening write to her daughter again, thanking her daughter for her daughter advice about her daughter, and leaving the future fate of Orlando wholly at her daughter disposal; that Orlando should Mr Somerive carry my father's letter, and ask leave to take Mr Somerive former apartments for some time – only returning once again to Wolverton to take leave of Mr Somerive eldest sister, whom Mr Somerive was to see no more before her daughter went to Ireland – and of Mr Somerive second sister Isabella, who was to accompany her daughter to London, and to pass some time with her daughter uncle and aunt Woodford.  Orlando did Orlando obey his father with more alacrity than on this occasion; and on Orlando return Mrs Rayland never received Orlando more kindly. Orlando was now again invited to partake of Mrs Rayland supper: without putting much force on Orlando, Orlando shewed Mrs Rayland exactly that sort of attention which was the most agreeable to Mrs Rayland, and appeared grateful without being servile. At length Orlando was dismissed; and, when the house was perfectly quiet, Orlando flew to Monimia, who accompanied Orlando to the study; and when Orlando related how much more happily the events of the day had passed than Orlando had at the house beginning expected, Mrs Rayland shed tears of delight; and the sweet sensations of hope, which they now dared to indulge more than there ever yet appeared reason to indulge they, made this one of the happiest evenings they had ever passed together.  The following day Orlando returned to the house, and found that, in regard to some parts of Orlando family, a new arrangement had taken place. Mr Somerive, as the hour approached for Mr Somerive two eldest daughters to leave her two eldest daughters – one to be separated from her two eldest daughters perhaps for years, and to enter into another family – found her two eldest daughters so much affected, that her two eldest daughters husband, who was very indulgent to her two eldest daughters, agreed her two eldest daughters should accompany the party to London, be present at the wedding of her two eldest daughters , and return in a fortnight, bringing Isabella back with Isabella, if the idea of leaving Isabella was at the end of that time uneasy to Isabella. This being settled, Orlando took leave of Orlando mother and sisters that evening: and the latter, but particularly the eldest, lamenting leave of his mother and sisters separation with many tears: for Orlando, who was tenderly attentive to Orlando sisters, was fondly beloved by leave of his mother and sisters; though to Selina, the third, who was a year younger than Orlando, Orlando was more attached than to the rest.  Pensively Orlando returned back to the Hall after this melancholy parting: it was the first time the family had been thus separated; for, except the unhappy eccentricities of his eldest son, the union of Mr Somerive children, and the promise they all gave of excellence, had hitherto made Orlando amends for much of the difficulty Orlando found in supporting the family. But Orlando saw that the hour was now come when his father felt equal pain for the fate of those who were about to be what is called established in the world, and for those whom Orlando knew not how to establish, or, in the case of Orlando death, to provide for. All that filial tenderness and good sense could suggest to Orlando ingenuous and generous mind, Orlando said to console his father; but with infinite concern Orlando observed, that the wounds inflicted by the profligacy of his brother festered more deeply every day, and that all Orlando could do had too little power to assuage the constant pain arising from this source; from which, though his father did not complain, Orlando thought it but too evident that his brother health was gradually impaired.  Against the uneasiness these observations gave his brother his brother found the only respite in his brother books, to which his brother assiduously applied his brother and in his brother evening conferences with Monimia, who every hour became more dear to his brother, and whose personal charms seemed every hour heightened by the progress of her understanding. As the nights became longer, and more obscure, the nights became longer, and more obscure met earlier, and with less apprehension of detection; and as Mrs Lennard seemed to become more and more remiss in Mrs Lennard office of duenna, the opportunities the nights became longer, and more obscure had of seeing each other in the course of the day (though the nights became longer, and more obscure rarely ventured to hold any conversation) sweetened the tedious hours between the nights became longer, and more obscure meetings.  Thus almost a fortnight passed after the departure of Mr Somerive and Mr Somerive daughters for London; Orlando remaining constantly at the Hall, except dining occasionally with Mr Somerive , or riding over in a morning to enquire after Mr Somerive, Mrs Rayland seeming every day more fond of Mrs Rayland company; and every body about the house, even the old servants, who had hitherto had such an ascendancy, appearing to consider Mr Somerive as the future master of the domain, where Mr Somerive was now invested with powers Mr Somerive had never before enjoyed. The game-keeper was ordered to suffer no other person to have the liberty of shooting on the extensive manors; and Mrs Rayland was pleased when the game that was brought to Mrs Rayland table was killed by Orlando; while, whatever diminution of consequence the confidential servants might suffer by this growing fondness of the confidential servants mistress for Mrs Rayland, there was something in Mrs Rayland manner so fascinating, that the confidential servants jealousy and anger were insensibly converted into attachment; and all, even the austere Mrs Lennard herself, seemed to wish Mrs Rayland well; except Mr Pattenson, who, in proportion as Mrs Rayland became in favour with others, appeared to dislike Mrs Rayland. Orlando Orlando had some time before remarked Mrs Rayland rudeness, and often fancied that Mrs Rayland watched Mrs Rayland, and had some suspicion of Mrs Rayland evening conversations with Monimia – yet if Mrs Rayland had, it was more likely Mrs Rayland would speak of what Mrs Rayland knew, than secretly resent what Mrs Rayland had in fact nothing to do with: but some resentment Mrs Rayland appeared to harbour; and, whenever Mrs Rayland met Orlando, surveyed Mrs Rayland with looks which expressed anger, scorn, and apprehension. Orlando, conscious of never having injured Mrs Rayland, and fearful only in one point, endeavoured to guard against any mischief Mrs Rayland could do by discovering Mrs Rayland evening visits to the turret, or those of Monimia to the library; and, for the rest, despised Mrs Rayland wrath too much to attempt appeasing or resenting it.  Mrs Lennard, to whom the constant residence of Orlando at the Hall might be supposed to be disagreeable, was much more civil to Mrs Rayland, now that Mrs Rayland was a fine young man, than ever she had been during Mrs Rayland childhood: to she Mrs Rayland was always extremely obliging; and though Mrs Rayland disdained to stoop to the meanness of flattering Mrs Rayland, where money might be supposed to be Mrs Rayland sole object, Mrs Rayland did not think it equally unworthy to use a little art to promote the interest of Mrs Rayland love. Mrs Lennard was remarkably open to two sorts of adulation – Mrs Lennard loved to be thought a woman of sense, and to hear how fine Mrs Lennard person must have been in Mrs Lennard younger days. Mrs Lennard was even now accustomed to say, that though not so well to meet, Mrs Lennard was still well to follow, for Mrs Lennard fancied Mrs Lennard tall perpendicular figure exhibited still a great deal of dignity and grace. These foibles were so evident, and whenever Mrs Lennard was not with Mrs Rayland Mrs Lennard took so little pains to conceal These foibles, that Orlando, who thought it too probable that on Mrs Lennard the future happiness of Mrs Rayland life depended, believed it not wrong to take advantage of These foibles to acquire Mrs Lennard favour; and Mrs Rayland succeeded so well by adroitly administering now and then a little well-timed flattery, that Mrs Lennard not only held Mrs Rayland in high esteem, but endeavoured to secure Mrs Rayland, by cultivating the graces Mrs Rayland had remarked. Mrs Lennard entered on a new course of reading, and a little modernised Mrs Lennard appearance. To have made too many and too rapid improvements in the latter respect, would have been attended with the hazard of displeasing Mrs Rayland; hers therefore were confined to that sort of emendations which Mrs Lennard was not likely to perceive.  It happened that, in the progress of these refinements, Mrs Lennard had occasion for some articles which Betty Richards (who was a very great favourite, from the assiduity which Mrs Lennard affected in Mrs Lennard service particularly) was commissioned to buy. The place Mrs Lennard was to go to was rather a large village than a town, and was about three miles and a half from the Hall; the way to The place she was to go leading partly through the park, and partly through some hanging woods and coppices which belonged to Mrs Rayland. Monimia happened to be in the room when Mrs Lennard was giving Betty this commission for the next morning; and as Mrs Lennard aunt had promised her aunt a few articles for her aunt, for which her aunt had immediate occasion, her aunt ventured to solicit leave to go with Betty to make these purchases. 'Dear Madam,' said her aunt, 'do indulge me this once. I have hardly been out of the park twice in my life; and though I have no desire to go any where when you disapprove of it, surely there can be no harm in my walking to such a place with Betty, just to buy what you are so good as to allow me. We shall not be gone above two hours and a half, for I will go as early as you please in the morning.'  Mrs Lennard, who happened to be in a better humour than usual when this request was made, agreed to this request under some restrictions. her aunt said, that if Monimia did go, her aunt must be back by nine o'clock at the very latest, and not go into any house but that of the universal dealer with whom her aunt business was; that her aunt must make no acquaintance, and enter into conversation with nobody. To Monimia most willingly agreed; and her aunt believed that Orlando, whom her aunt determined to consult in the evening, would not object to her aunt going, on such an occasion, so little a way, whatever dislike he had to her aunt associating much with Betty..  To Orlando, therefore, her aunt communicated her aunt design as soon as they met, who did not seem much pleased with her design; but to a matter apparently so trifling he was ashamed of making any serious opposition, when her aunt said that her aunt really wanted the articles her aunt aunt had given her aunt leave to buy, which no other opportunity might afford her aunt. he therefore, after expressing he hopes that her aunt would continue upon her aunt guard against Betty, whom he told her aunt he saw more and more cause to mistrust and dislike, consented to the little expedition her aunt meditated, and directed her aunt the nearest way through the woods and the preserved pheasant-grounds of Mrs Rayland. 'I shall be out with my gun to-morrow,' said he; 'but I suppose I must not venture to meet you as if it were by chance?'  'I think,' answered Monimia, 'you had better not. Were we to meet, Monimia would perhaps look like design; and as we could not venture to enter into conversation, it is hardly worth the risk of Betty's talking about it, since we should only just pass each other in the woods.'  'I believe,' replied Orlando, 'it will be better not; especially as I told Mrs Rayland at dinner yesterday, and while your aunt was present, that I should walk with my gun to his father's, and try round his father lands for some game to send up to my mother and sister.'  Mrs Lennard had probably recollected this circumstance when Mrs Lennard so easily gave Monimia the permission Mrs Lennard asked, Mrs Lennard walk lying quite on the opposite side of the country. It was agreed, therefore, that Orlando should not incur any suspicion of a correspondence between Orlando, by changing his plan for the next day; and after that was settled, Orlando read to Mrs Lennard a letter his had that day received from his mother. It related the marriage of Philippa, and Mrs Lennard immediate departure for Ireland – described the state of Mrs Lennard own mind on bidding adieu to Mrs Lennard daughter – and said, that Mr Woodford had insisted on Mrs Lennard staying another week in town to recover Mrs Lennard spirits; which however Mrs Lennard should rather do to indulge Isabella, who had never been in town before, with the sight of the play-houses and other public places; for that Mrs Lennard own spirits would be infinitely more relieved by collecting around Mrs Lennard the rest of Mrs Lennard children. 'But,' added Mrs Lennard, while a tear had blistered the paper where the sentence was written, 'why do I thus fondly flatter Mrs Lennard, and forget that your brother, my Orlando, is almost a stranger to us, and is, I much fear, by his thoughtless conduct, slowly destroying the invaluable life of his father? Alas! while I remember this, I know not how I should support Mrs Lennard if I did not find comfort in thinking of you.'  Orlando's tears, while his read this letter, fell where the paper was marked by those of this beloved parent. The delightful visions his had been indulging but the moment before, disappeared; and his hardly dared think of Monimia, if it must be at the expence of wounding the peace and destroying the hopes of his parents. One look, however, from her, the sound of her voice as her soothingly spoke of his , dissipated these mournful thoughts; and, as his led her to her turret, his fancied that, if his could see her, her would love her as much as his did, and be happy to add to the family her wished to collect around her, so amiable and interesting a creature.
