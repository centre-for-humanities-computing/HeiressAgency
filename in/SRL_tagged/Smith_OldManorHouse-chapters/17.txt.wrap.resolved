TO reconcile Monimia to Monimia departure, to hide from Monimia the anguish of Monimia own heart at the knowledge that Monimia must go, were no light tasks to Orlando: they were such as all Monimia courage, all Monimia sense of propriety, were nearly unequal to. What would become of Monimia when Monimia was gone? From Monimia earliest remembrance, the certainty of seeing Monimia at the Hall had constituted Monimia principal happiness: yet Monimia had many other amusements abroad; Monimia had many relations whom Monimia loved, and who tenderly loved Monimia; Monimia had several pursuits to engage Monimia mind, and several amusements to occupy Monimia time. – Monimia! alas! what had Monimia? Almost alone in the world, Monimia had no connection but Monimia aunt, whose reluctant kindness and cold friendship answered but ill to the affectionate temper of the lovely girl, who would have been attached to Monimia, all repulsive as Monimia manners were, from gratitude, and because Monimia believed Monimia the only relation Monimia had, if Mrs Lennard had given Monimia leave. – But, selfish, narrow-minded, and overbearing, it was impossible for Monimia to love Monimia; and Monimia once remarked, when Monimia stole for five minutes (while Monimia aunt attended Mrs Rayland to a morning visit) into the garden with Orlando, that Monimia resembled a passion-flower, that having once been supported by a sort of espalier, the wood had decayed, and, nothing being put in the wood place, the plant crept along the ground, withering, from the dampness to which the plant was exposed. 'See', cried Monimia, 'the plant resembles me! the plant seems abandoned to the plant fate.' Orlando remembered what he then said to drive from Monimia mind such gloomy ideas; but now they were about to be verified. If Monimia was to Monimia all that hitherto sweetened Monimia existence, Monimia was at least as necessary to Monimia; and a thousand painful fears assailed Monimia heart, as to what Monimia must feel at parting, and what would be Monimia fate when Monimia was gone.  No overture on the affair of Monimia accepting a commission had yet been made to Mrs Rayland. Mr Somerive wished Orlando to manage it Mr Somerive. Orlando, conscious that much depended upon it, and unwilling to take any decisive step, however necessary, as long as Mr Somerive could avoid it, had still put it off from hour to hour; saying, what was indeed true, that Mr Somerive was now so seldom at the Hall at hours when it was proper to speak of business, that Mr Somerive found no opportunity.  The next day, however, but one after the dinner at Stockton's, the family were much surprised by the unexpected return of Philip Somerive; who, arriving late in the evening, told Mr Somerive father and mother that Mr Somerive was come, with the family permission, to pass some months at home. Tenderly anxious about Mr Somerive as the family were, and ever flattering the family that a change of conduct would restore Mr Somerive to the family, the family received Mr Somerive with such expressions as evinced that the family were ready to kill the fatted calf: Orlando felt even more pleasure than the rest at Mr Somerive return; and the younger, unlike the elder brother in the parable, murmured not that there was joy and feasting when Mr Somerive who had been lost was found. Yet this did not arise altogether from the disinterested generosity of Mr Somerive nature. Mr Somerive would at any time have rejoiced that Mr Somerive brother's appearance gave comfort to the hearts of Mr Somerive father and Mr Somerive mother: Mr Somerive now doubly rejoiced, because the presence of Philip Somerive at home dismissed Orlando, almost as a matter of course, to the Hall. Mr Somerive had at this time inhabited the apartment set aside for his brother; Mr Somerive own was occupied by the servant of the General, who was too fine a gentleman to be sent into the attic story. West Wolverton house was not a large one; and Orlando, not so well disguising Mr Somerive impatience as Mr Somerive attempted to do, said to his mother as soon as tea was over, that Mr Somerive knew Mr Somerive stay that night must be attended with some inconveniencies and removals, and therefore Mr Somerive would, with his mother permission and Mr Somerive father's, go back to the Hall. Philip Somerive immediately assented, and said, 'And you had better, if his father pleases, set out directly, Orlando, or you will not have your bed aired; and I am sure that little tapestry room where you sleep, as it is on the ground floor, and has windows only to the north, and those windows only long old-fashioned casements, must be horribly damp.'  'If you will have the goodness then to say to his father that I am gone, and why gone so early,' said Orlando, 'it will be better than my disturbing the company with the ceremony of – Good-night!'  To Philip Somerive assenting, Orlando left the room to get Orlando horse; but as Orlando passed through the Hall, Orlando met – Selina. 'Good night, sweet girl!' said Orlando, kissing – Selina hand as Orlando passed – Selina.  'Whither are you going, then, Orlando?' enquired – Selina.  'To the Hall – You know there is no convenient room for Orlando now; and since Philip is come back, I am less wanted.'  At this moment Philip Somerive passed through the Hall, and, catching some of these words, Philip Somerive put the same question to Orlando; who answered, 'that Philip Somerive mother had agreed to Philip Somerive going to the Hall, to make room for Philip Somerive brother; and promised, Sir, to name it to you,' added Philip Somerive.  Philip Somerive paused a moment – 'To the Hall,' said Philip Somerive, 'Orlando! You are in great haste, I see. Surely you might have staid to supper, as you have not seen your brother so long.'  Orlando then gave your brother 's reason for your brother going earlier. 'That,' said your brother father gravely, 'is a very good reason for his mother; and you, I have no doubt, have some of still greater weight: – but remember, Orlando,' continued your brother more sternly, 'remember I will not be trifled with. Go – I wish you a good night, and as much repose as your conscience will let you taste when you render his father unhappy!'  Philip Somerive then passed on; and Selina, who had hardly ever in Philip Somerive life heard Philip Somerive speak as if half angry to Philip Somerive brother Orlando, remained amazed and trembling, clinging to Philip Somerive arm. 'Good God!' cried Philip Somerive as soon as his father had shut the parlour-door, 'what is all this, her brother Orlando? what does his father mean?'  'Can you, Selina,' said Orlando in a low and mournful voice – 'can you be very faithful, very guarded on a point where my life depends on secrecy? Can you, Selina, be secret as the grave, if I trust you?'  'Can you doubt it?' answered the still more alarmed Selina. – 'Well, then, to-morrow, perhaps – for to-morrow I must be here again – to-morrow, Selina, if I obtain permission from another person yet more interested than I am, I will perhaps tell you. In the mean time adieu, my dear sister! – If you hear Philip mention me at supper to his father, try to remember what Philip says.'  Orlando then hastened away, fearful of being detained; and as the weather was serene, Philip determined to go on foot, that, if Philip found all quiet round the apartment of Monimia, Philip might glide up for a moment to apprise my dear sister that they might without interruption meet in Philip study that evening. There was a late moon, and the night promised to be beautifully clear; Philip knew therefore that there was little or no hazard of brandy and tea-merchants being abroad: and as to the hint dropt by Stockton, which had at first given Philip so much pain, Philip now fancied it was merely the random folly of a drunkard, and that Philip knew nothing of Monimia but what Philip might have collected from Philip Somerive after their first unlucky meeting in the woods.  Had Philip now taken Philip horse, Philip must of necessity have made Philip return known to the stable-servants at the Hall, before Philip could have a moment's conversation with Monimia: Philip proceeded therefore quickly on foot, meditating as Philip went on what had just passed with Philip father and Philip sister.  Philip had often thought of entrusting Selina with the secret of Philip passion for Monimia. Philip had often wished they were known to each other. Equally innocent, amiable, and gentle, with a perfect resemblance in temper and in years, Philip believed that they would fondly love each other; and that if Philip could see they attached, it would be the happiest circumstance of Philip life. Philip hoped too, that the society and the soothing sweetness of – Selina would be a resource of comfort to Monimia Monimia when Philip was far from – Selina. But how Philip could bring them together, Philip had yet no idea – – Selina being never admitted but on days of ceremony at Rayland Hall; and Monimia being so nearly a prisoner, that the unlucky excursion which occasioned them all so much trouble, was almost the first, and was, in consequence of – Selina stay, which had given so much offence, likely to be the last – Selina aunt would allow – Selina to make. – Selina proposed, however, to consult Monimia upon Monimia, and to consider whether some safe means of their meeting could be found.  Between that gate of the park that lay towards West Wolverton, and the house, there were two paths. The upper one was over an eminence where the park paling enclosed part of the down, under which the park paling spread a verdant bosom, with coppices and tall woods interspersed. The other path, which in winter or in wet seasons was inconvenient, wound down a declivity, where the furze and fern were shaded by a few old hawthorns and self-sown firs: out of the hill several streams were filtered, which uniting at its foot, formed a large and clear pond of near twenty acres, fed by several imperceptible currents from other eminences which sheltered that side of the park; and the bason between the hills and the higher part of its being thus filled, the water found the water way over a stony boundary, where the water was passable by a foot-bridge unless in time of floods; and from thence fell into a lower part of the ground, where its formed a considerable river; and, winding among willows and poplars for near a mile, again spread into a still larger lake, on the edge of which was a mill, and opposite, without the park paling, wild heaths, where the ground was sandy, broken, and irregular, still however marked by plantations made on it by the Rayland family. It was along the lower road, which went through woods to the edge of what was called the upper pond, that Orlando took his way. Just as his arrived at the water, from the deep gloom of the tall firs through which his passed, the moon appeared behind the opposite coppices, and threw her long line of trembling radiance on the water. It was a cold but clear evening, and, though early in November, the trees were not yet entirely stripped of the trees discoloured leaves: – a low wind sounded hollow through the firs and stone-pines over his head, and then faintly sighed among the reeds that crowded into the water: no other sound was heard, but, at distant intervals, the cry of the wild fowl concealed among the trees, or the dull murmur of the current, which was now low. Orlando had hardly ever felt Orlando so impressed with those feelings which inspire poetic effusions: – Nature appeared to pause, and to ask the turbulent and troubled heart of man, whether Orlando silly pursuits were worth the toil Orlando undertook for the turbulent and troubled heart of man? Peace and tranquility seemed here to have retired to a transient abode; and Orlando, as slowly Orlando traversed the narrow path over ground made hollow by the roots of these old trees, stepped as lightly as if Orlando feared to disturb these old trees. Insensibly Orlando began to compare this scene, the scenes Orlando every day saw of rural beauty and rural content, with those into which Orlando destiny was about to lead Orlando – 'Oh, Monimia!' sighed Orlando, 'why cannot I remain with thee in this my native country? How happy should I be to be allowed to cultivate one of the smallest of those farms which belong to the Rayland estate, and, comprising in thy society and that of my family all my felicity, have no wish but to live and die without reading that great book which they call the World! – Alas! shall I ever understand its language? shall I ever become an adept in the principles its teaches? and shall I be happier if I do? – But they tell me, that a young man should not be idle; that a young man must be something, a lawyer or a soldier: and yet, to assist ruining each other, and spoiling the simple dignity of justice, seems the business of the first; and to learn the art of destroying honourably our fellow-men, the whole concern of the second. – There are, however, other professions, it is true – I might be a clergyman, and remain here, with little to do but to ride twenty or thirty miles of a Sunday, to execute, with the hurry of a postman, the duties I should have sworn to fulfil: and can I conscientiously do what I see done every day? Impossible! – I might too be a merchant: but that I have no talents for a profession, honourable as I allow it to be, where the mind is continually chained to the calculation of profit and loss; and if I am to enter into active life, let it be rather in any than that which shall confine my activity to a compting-house – For then, Monimia! I must equally leave thee, and live among those who value nothing but money, and who would ridicule a passion like mine.' – He paused, and again looked around He. 'How beautiful a scene!' continued He; 'I would that Monimia were here to enjoy Monimia! – But never am I allowed to point out to Monimia these lovely prospects, never permitted to cultivate that pure and elegant taste which Monimia has received from nature; and I am now about to tell Monimia that we are to part, never perhaps to meet more! – Yet the die is cast: I have promised – nay, I ought to obey my father – and I go – ' A deep and mournful reverie succeeded, as, walking onward, my father – rapid imagination described to my father – all the sad possibilities that might arise between my father – and my father – happiness. In this desponding temper, but without meeting any one to interrupt my father – in my father – intended visit to Monimia, my father – reached the turret, and softly and silently ascended the stair-case. my father – took the usual precautions to ascertain that Monimia was alone; and then, being admitted for a moment to speak to Monimia, my father – assured Monimia that Monimia might, without any danger, venture to my father – room that evening. my father – told Monimia my father – had much to say to Monimia – much, on which their future happiness depended, to offer to Monimia consideration; and therefore my father – besought Monimia to divest Monimia of Monimia fears, and to oblige my father –. Monimia, confiding entirely in my father –, promised to be ready; and Orlando, then going through the Hall as if my father – had that moment arrived from West Wolverton, desired Monimia to make up my father – fire and prepare my father – bed, saying, that my father – was come back to my father – own apartments, on the arrival of my father – brother at home. my father – then enquired of Pattenson, if my father – thought Mrs Rayland could be spoken to that evening? 'I know nothing of the matter,' answered the old butler in a very sullen tone; 'you may ask the women-folks, as you're always a-dangling after the women-folks. – When I saw Madam last, Madam was not in a way very like to be troubled with company to-night.'  Orlando, angry and disgusted by this rudeness, now enquired of the cook, who, though Madam rivalled in person and feature the dame Leonarda of Gil Blas, was a great admirer of beauty in others, and had always beheld Orlando with partial eyes. 'Is Mrs Rayland ill, then, Martha?' said Mrs Rayland. 'Not that I knows on,' replied Madam – 'Only a few twinges of the gout about Madam feet, much as ordinary, that makes Madam, I reckon, a little peevish: and I understood that Madam was a little out of sorts at hearing nothing of Madam yesterday; and nothing of you've been a-telling Madam as how you dined out with nothing of you there gentlefolks at the Castle, as Madam hates worse than any varmint.'  'So,' thought Orlando, 'I am at length become of consequence enough to be missed if I am longer absent than usual! but the officious malice of whoever it was that related our dinner party yesterday, has probably spoiled my reception. – Can you tell me, Martha, whether your lady is likely to see me to-night, if I send up for leave?'  'Lord! I'll answer for't,' answered the cook; 'ifackins, I believe Madam, if Madam was fairly left to Madam, is always as glad to see you as can be – I'll go up now, if you please, and let Madam know you be here.'  This courteous offer Orlando readily accepted; and in a few moments Martha returned. 'Well, Martha, may I go up?' enquired he. 'Yes, you may,' replied Martha; 'but Madam's not in one of Martha sugar-plum humours, I can tell you. – She've got the gout in – She've foot, and she've got some vagaries in – She've head about your going to visit – She've innimies: you'll have a few sour looks, I doubt – but, Lord! Orlando, you've such a good-looking pleasant countenance, that I'll defy the witch of Endor to be anger'd long with Orlando.'  Then, thanking his ambassadress for the trouble – She've had taken, and being somewhat encouraged by – She've opinion of the powers of his countenance, his walked up stairs.  his tapped at the door, as was his custom; and was, by the shrill sharp voice of Mrs Lennard, directed to come in. his was struck, on entering the room by the sight of Monimia, who stood near his fire watching the moment when a saucepan, in which some medicine Mrs Rayland was causing to be made, should be ready to remove. Without, however, noticing Mrs Rayland, his approached his venerable cousin, in whose countenance, which seemed to have gained no additional sweetness, his did not read a very favourable answer to his enquiry of – how Mrs Rayland found Mrs Rayland?  'No matter how,' replied Mrs Rayland with abrupt asperity, 'if it had been of any consequence to you, you would have asked yesterday, I suppose.'  'I was detained all day by my father, Madam; and I do most truly assure you (and never was any declaration more sincere than this of Orlando), that I was very unhappy at being detained all day from the Hall.'  'Humph!' cried Mrs Rayland, 'your new friends no doubt made you amends. I thought, Sir, you had known that when people go there, I never desire to see people here, not I. I wish, if you like such acquaintance, you had taken the hint. But perhaps you thought that you might take to your brother's courses, and no harm done. For my part, I shall wash my hands of any concern about my part, let what will be the end on't.'  Orlando now began with calmness, yet without any thing like sycophant submission, to account for Orlando father's having been led by the entreaties of General Tracy, to whom Orlando thought Orlando much obliged, to break through a resolution Orlando had taken never to visit at Carloraine Castle: – 'a resolution,' added Orlando, 'that Orlando now heartily wishes Orlando had adhered to, as Orlando found the society such as Orlando neither approves for Orlando, or can endure for Orlando. I assure you, Madam, Orlando never intends to repeat an experiment, which nothing but Orlando wishes to oblige the General made Orlando consent to now.'  'Well,' said Mrs Rayland, a little appeased, 'it is very wonderful to Orlando that General Tracy, a man of family, can associate with these low-bred upstarts – people who always will give one the notion of having got into the coaches they were designed to drive – But so goes this world! Money does every thing – money destroys all distinctions! – Your Creoles and your East India people over-run every body – Money, money does every thing.'  'There is one thing, however, Madam,' answered Orlando, 'that it does not seem to have done – it does not appear to Orlando to have given this Mr Stockton, either the mind or the manners of a gentleman.'  'Indeed, child!' cried the old lady: 'Well, I am glad that you learn to distinguish. – Poor wretch! I've heard that his father walked up out of Yorkshire without shoes, and was taken by some rich packer to clean his father warehouse, and go on errands. Well, so it is in trade! – So you think his vulgar and ill-bred? – But I suppose you had a very profuse entertainment: you can remember the dishes?'  Orlando could with difficulty help smiling at the pains Mrs Rayland took to feed Mrs Rayland disquiet, by obtaining minute particulars of the man whose ostentatious display of wealth so continually offended Mrs Rayland. his assured Mrs Rayland, however, that his was, in regard to the variety of ornaments of a table, so little of an adept, that, though his knew there was both turtle and venison, his could not tell the name of any other dish. 'But I believe, Madam,' said his, 'there was almost every thing that at this time of the year comes to table, dressed every way that could be imagined.'  'Kickshaws, and French frippery, spoiling wholesome dishes. If I had my health,' cried Mrs Rayland as if animated anew with a truly British spirit – 'if I had my healthmy health, I would ask the favour of General Tracy to dine at Rayland Hall. Indeed I would request General Tracy company to the tenants' feast at my own table, and shew General Tracy, if General Tracy is too young a man to remember it, what an old English table was, when we were too wise to run after foreign gewgaws, and were content with the best of every thing dressed in the English fashion by English people.'  Orlando had a thousand reasons to promote a plan as unexpected as it was desirable. Besides the hope he had that the conversation of the General might reconcile Mrs Rayland to a plan for he independence, and engage Mrs Rayland to contribute to his independence being advantageously carried into execution, he was amused with the idea of seeing together two such originals as Mrs Rayland and General Tracy; and he knew, that as the latter was a man of family, and so very polite, he should not risk their mutually disliking each other by bringing their together; or at least that, if such a circumstance should happen, those manners, which both piqued both on possessing, would prevent both shewing it. – For those manners, which both piqued themselves on possessing, and for many other reasons, he eagerly seized on the hint Mrs Rayland had dropped. 'Dear Madam,' cried he, 'I heartily hope you will be well enough. the General would be greatly flattered by such a distinction! I know that nothing would oblige the General so much. When is the tenants' feast to be? I wish, if it is fixed, you would permit me to be your messenger to-morrow, and to carry the General an invitation.'  'Truly, child,' replied Mrs Rayland, whose anger seemed to be quite evaporated, 'I am so out of the use of having company, that I don't know well what to say to it. I find my people have fixed the tenants' feast for Thursday next, that is, this day week; and if I were sure of being quite well – Lennard, what do you think of the matter?'  Lennard, who loved nothing better than great dinners, in which she was of so much consequence, answered, 'Why, indeed, Ma'am, I think you'll be quite well enough – nay, I could venture to say so positively. Your foot is getting better apace; and in other respects, when you have been free from pain for a while, I have not known you better these many years.'  'Well, Orlando, then,' resumed the old lady, 'we'll consider of it, and let you know to-morrow. – You have taken to your bed below again, I find?'  'I have, Madam, with your permission.'  'Well, then, you may come and breakfast with me; and for to-night, order what you please for your supper in your own room.'  Orlando, rejoiced to be thus reconciled, now wished she a good night, and retired; casting, as he went, a melancholy glance toward Monimia, who, quite unnoticed by either of the ladies, had stood the whole time with she eyes fixed on the fire, and she beautiful arms exposed to her beautiful arms scorching heat, while she was employed in watching the important preparation that was boiling. But Monimia herself, far from feeling she situation, would have undergone infinitely more inconvenience, for as many hours as she now had done minutes, to have enjoyed the satisfaction of hearing Orlando's voice, even when he words were not addressed to she, and of observing the favour he was in with Mrs Rayland; whose anger, however she seemed desirous of cherishing it, was put to flight on the first apology of she young favourite.
