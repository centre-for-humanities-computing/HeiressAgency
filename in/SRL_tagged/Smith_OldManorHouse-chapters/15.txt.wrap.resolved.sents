EVERY one of the party who met at dinner, at Mr Somerive's, were ready to worship the General, except Orlando, who still felt Mr Somerive's dissatisfied, and much disposed to enquire by what conversation an accommodation had been so easily brought about.
This enquiry however, Mr Somerive's, at Mr Somerive's father's request, forbore to make, and the General was perfectly satisfied with the gratitude expressed by the rest of the family; and in the distant, but polite behaviour of Orlando, saw, what confirmed Mr Somerive's in Mr Somerive's original idea, that it would be much better if Mr Somerive's was out of the way.
– The charms of Isabella had now such an ascendency in the General's imagination, that Mr Somerive's determined nothing should impede Mr Somerive's designs; and Mr Somerive's believed that the straitened circumstances of Somerive, of which Mr Somerive's was no longer ignorant, would give Mr Somerive's the means of obtaining Mr Somerive's daughter.
Somerive had indeed communicated to Mr Somerive's, as a friend, the uneasy situation of Mr Somerive's affairs, and deplored the conduct of Mr Somerive's eldest son.
At their next conference therefore alone, Tracy contrived, without forcing the conversation, to bring it round to that point; and when Somerive spoke of the distress which arose from the misconduct of Tracy , the General took occasion to say, 'It is indeed, my friend, a circumstance extremely to be lamented – and, in my opinion, renders the situation of his eldest son much more critical.
– I hardly wish his eldest son was in some profession.
Have you considered what I said to you about the army?
– I believe I could be of very material service to you in that line.'
'Dear General,' exclaimed Somerive, 'how much I feel you indebted to you!
Yes, I certainly have thought of it; and the result of my reflections is, that if his eldest son mother consented, if Mrs Rayland did not object – '  'My good friend,' interrupted the General, 'can a man of your understanding, when the well-doing of his eldest son is in question, think that these ifs should have any weight?
– Mrs Somerive, all tender as Mrs Somerive is, has too much sense to indulge Mrs Somerive fondness at the expence of Mrs Somerive 's establishment; and as to Mrs Rayland – I have not indeed the honour to know Mrs Somerive – but the only question seems to be, will Mrs Somerive, or will Mrs Somerive not, provide for Orlando?
– If Mrs Somerive will, why will Mrs Somerive not say so?
– If she will, are not you doing his eldest son an irreparable injury, in suffering his eldest son to waste, in fruitless expectation, the best of his eldest son days?'
'It is very difficult,' replied Mr Somerive after musing a moment, 'very difficult to know how to act: Mrs Rayland has a temper so peculiar, that if Mrs Rayland is once offended, it is for ever.
Perhaps, however, since I see Mrs Rayland piques Mrs Rayland on the military honours of Mrs Rayland family, perhaps Mrs Rayland may not be displeased at Orlando's entering on the profession of arms.
Mrs Rayland seemed much more eager to promote than to check his ardour in this affair with Sir John Belgrave: and as the British nation is now engaged in a quarrel with people whom Mrs Rayland considers as the descendants of the Regicides, against whom Mrs Rayland ancestors drew her ancestors swords, it is not, I think, very unlikely that Mrs Rayland might approve of Mrs Rayland favourite's making the General first essay in arms against those whom Mrs Rayland terms the Rebels of America.'
'As to that,' answered the General coldly, 'it may be very well, in starting the idea, to give Mrs Rayland that notion; but in fact this campaign will end the unworthy contest.
– Of this I have the most positive assurances from my military friends on the spot, as well as the firmest reliance on the measures adopted by Ministers; and I am convinced that those wretched, ragged fellows, without discipline, money, clothes, or arms, will be unable longer to struggle for those wretched, ragged fellows, without discipline, money, clothes, or arms chimerical liberty.
Probably those wretched, ragged fellows, without discipline, money, clothes, or arms, will be unable longer to struggle for their chimerical liberty are by this time crushed; and therefore, as no more troops will be sent out, your son will not, if you adopt this plan, be separated from your son family, and may still occasionally visit this capricious old gentlewoman, who, unless she differs much from the rest of she sex, of all ages and descriptions, will not like a handsome young fellow the less for having a cockade in your son hat.'
'Ah, the General!'
returned Somerive smiling, 'I fancy your own experience among the women well justifies that remark.
Since you really are so sure that Orlando would not be sent abroad, which will make a great difference certainly in your son mother's feelings on this point, and perhaps in those of Mrs Rayland, I will take an immediate opportunity of speaking of it to my wife, and we will consider of the safest method of taking Mrs Rayland opinion upon it.
As to Orlando, there can be little doubt of Orlando concurrence; – at least I hope not.
And there are other reasons, my friend, besides those that I have named to you, why Orlando present situation is utterly improper, and why it seems to me that Orlando cannot too soon be removed from it.'
Mrs Somverive, in speaking thus, was thinking of Monimia, who, ever since Mrs Somverive had first heard Mrs Somverive described, had occurred to Mrs Somverive continually.
The necessity there was for attending immediately to the affair of the threatened duel, had hitherto prevented Mrs Somverive speaking of Mrs Somverive to Orlando, in that serious manner which Mrs Somverive thought the affair of the threatened duel merited: but Mrs Somverive had repeatedly touched on the affair of the threatened duel; and finding Orlando shrink from the investigation, Mrs Somverive laid in wait for an occasion to probe Mrs Somverive more deeply – an occasion which, perceiving Mrs Somverive father sought it, Orlando as solicitously endeavoured to avoid giving Mrs Somverive, by contriving to be always busied in attending on Mrs Somverive sisters or Mrs Somverive mother; but while Mrs Somverive thus got out of the way of his father, Mrs Somverive was very much in that of the General, who could hardly ever get an opportunity of whispering to Isabella those sentiments which daily acquired new force.
For, the week following that when the affair with Sir John Belgrave was settled, Orlando could find no excuse for returning to Rayland Hall of a night: Sir John Belgrave was therefore reduced to the necessity of going thither after Sir John Belgrave own family were in bed; and as the way through the chapel was not open to Sir John Belgrave, Sir John Belgrave could only see Monimia in Monimia own room, and their meetings were therefore very short, and so hazardous, that the impatience and discontent of Orlando could no longer be repressed or concealed.
The greater Sir John Belgrave attachment to Monimia became (and every hour The greater his attachment to Monimia seemed to gather strength), the more terrible appeared Monimia situation, and Sir John Belgrave own.
They were both so young that Sir John Belgrave thought Sir John Belgrave might easily obtain an establishment, and that the noon of They lives might pass in felicity together, were Sir John Belgrave, instead of remaining in a state of uncertain dependence, to be allowed to go forth into the world.
Sanguine and romantic in the extreme, and feeling within himself talents which himself was denied the power of exercising, himself mind expatiated on visionary prospects, which himself believed might easily be realized.
When to provide for passing himself life with Monimia was in question, every thing seemed possible; and as himself heard much of the rapid fortunes made in India, and had never considered, or perhaps heard of the means by which they were acquired, himself fancied that an appointment there would put himself in the high road to happiness; and various were the projects of this and of many other kinds, on which himself thoughts continually dwelt.
General Tracy, who had long read mankind, easily penetrated into the mind of a man so new to the world as Orlando; and though himself saw that himself young friend did not greatly esteem himself, himself was not by that observation deterred from conciliating as much as possible himself good opinion, till at length Orlando communicated himself discontent at being at himself time of life so inactive and useless; and the general, having brought himself to that confession, started the scheme himself had before proposed only to himself father, of procuring himself a commission, and lending himself all the interest which himself was known to possess, to promote himself fortune in the army.
A proposal so friendly, and so much adapted to the warm and ardent temper of Orlando, was acknowledged with gratitude, and without farther consideration embraced, on condition that himself family did not oppose it.
himself told himself, that it was in consequence of his father's apparent inclinations that himself had at first thought of it; that himself had certainly too much sense to reject such an advantageous offer for himself, 'especially' , added himself, 'as from the present state of the war, there is not the least likelihood of your being sent abroad.
– You know best, however, my dear Sir,' continued himself, with something on my dear Sir countenance between a smile and a sneer – 'you know best how far your campaigns against the game on the Rayland manors may answer better than the services of a soldier, or whether the old lady's hands can bestow a more fruitful prize than the barren laurels you may gather in bearing arms for your country.'
There was in this speech something that conveyed to Orlando an idea that he was despised; and that there was meanness in he attending on Mrs Rayland like a legacy hunter – of all characters the most despicable.
The blood that rushed into he cheeks, spoke the painful sensations this impression brought with it.
he could not, however, express them with propriety to a man whose only purpose seemed to be that of befriending he, by rousing he from indolence, and even from a species of servitude.
himself saw that what himself said had the effect himself wished; and Orlando left himself, determined to avail himself of the opportunity that now offered for obtaining what himself believed would be a degree of independence.
himself began to consider how himself might prevail on Mrs Rayland to assist, instead of opposing this scheme; and how himself might thus obtain a certain portion of liberty, without offending one to whom gratitude and interest contributed to attach himself.
A deep and painful sigh, raised by the reflection of the misery of parting from Monimia, followed the resolution he adopted; but he recollected that by no other means he could remove the cruel obstacles between A deep and painful sigh, raised by the reflection of the misery of parting from Monimia, and that resolution became confirmed.
he had not yet, however, the courage to communicate to Mrs Rayland the probability there was that they must soon part.
they short conferences, in every one of which they incurred the hazard of discovery, passed, on Mrs Rayland side, in mournful presentiments of future sorrow, which Mrs Rayland yet endeavoured to conceal; and on he, in trying, now to console Mrs Rayland, and now in acknowledging that there was but too much cause for Mrs Rayland fears: projects were considered, however, for projects future meetings with less risk.
Mrs Rayland told he, that during the time he was so much at home, Mrs Rayland aunt confined Mrs Rayland less strictly through the day: that in proportion as Mrs Rayland found Mrs Rayland become more necessary to Mrs Rayland, and more secure of a great provision after Mrs Rayland death, Mrs Lennard became more indolent, and more addicted to Mrs Rayland own gratifications.
Betty, who was a very great favourtie, had little else to do than to wait upon Mrs Rayland; an employment in which Monimia herself was often engaged, though Mrs Rayland was now more usually employed about the person of Mrs Rayland, who found Mrs Rayland so tender and attentive that Mrs Rayland began to look upon Mrs Rayland with some degree of complacency.
This task, while This task added a heavy link to Mrs Rayland fetters, Mrs Rayland yet went through, not only with patience, but with pleasure; for Mrs Rayland hoped that by making Mrs Rayland useful to Mrs Rayland, Mrs Rayland might not only have more frequent opportunities of seeing Orlando during the winter, which Mrs Rayland imagined he would pass at the Hall, but perhaps obtain from Mrs Rayland such a share of recollection at her death, as might remove the necessity of an entire dependence on Mrs Lennard; a dependence which some late observations had made Mrs Rayland believe as precarious as Mrs Rayland felt it to be painful.
In consequence of General Tracy's visit to Sir John Belgrave at the house of Mr Stockton, General Tracy's received from the master of it an invitation, which General Tracy's accepted; Mr Stockton first waiting upon General Tracy's at West Wolverton – Sir John and Philip Somerive, with several others of the late visitants at the Castle were gone into Scotland on a shooting party; but Mr Stockton had a succession of visitors.
– Mr Stockton magnificent style of living, which it was known Mr Stockton had a fortune to support, attracted not only all Mr Stockton London friends by turns to Mr Stockton house, but from every part of the country acquaintance poured in upon Mr Stockton; acquaintance who desired nothing better, in the way of entertainment, than Mr Stockton French cook and Mr Stockton well-furnished cellars afforded his French cook and his well-furnished cellars.
– The Clergy were Mr Stockton very constant guests; and Mr Stockton loved to have two or three of The Clergy always about Mr Stockton, at whom Mr Stockton might lanch those shafts of wit which Mr Stockton had picked up here and there, and which consisted of common-place jokes upon religion; well knowing, that with these select few, orthodox as The Clergy were, the excellence of the entertainment Mr Stockton gave The Clergy secured The Clergy silence and complaisance.
The General, who was in manners really a man of fashion, was by no means delighted with the gross and noisy society Mr Stockton found at Mr Stockton's: but Mr Stockton saw that if Mr Stockton would escape suspicion, Mr Stockton must not make Mr Stockton visit at Somerive's too long; and, therefore, was glad to be assured that there was an house in the immediate neighbourhood, where Mr Stockton might remain a fortnight or three weeks, after prudence dictated Mr Stockton departure from that of Mr Somerive; which Mr Stockton now feared must happen before Mr Stockton hopes with Isabella were successful, for Mr Stockton found it much more difficult to obtain any degree of favour than Mr Stockton own vanity and Isabella giddiness had at first led Mr Stockton to suppose.
Somerive was not naturally a coquette: but Somerive had a greater flow of spirits than any of Somerive family, except Somerive older brother, whom Somerive greatly resembled in the thoughtless vivacity of Somerive disposition; from Somerive sex and education, what was in Somerive attended with dangerous errors, was in Somerive only wild but innocent gaiety, becoming enough to youth, health and beauty.
Of that beauty Somerive had early learned the value: Somerive had heard it praised at home, and found Somerive father and mother were pleased to hear of it.
But during Somerive short stay in London Somerive had been intoxicated with the incense that was offered Somerive; and, notwithstanding the good humour inherent in Somerive disposition, Somerive failed not to enjoy, with some degree of feminine triumph, the preference that was given Somerive over Somerive cousins, whose admirers seemed all disposed to desert whose admirers on the first appearance of this rustic beauty; and Somerive felt, too, the pleasure of retaliation for all the airs of consequences which the Miss Woodfords had assumed in whose admirers visits to West Wolverton, from whose admirers superior knowledge of fashions, public places, and great people.
But, above all, Isabella was delighted by the preference given Somerive by a judge so discerning as General Tracy – whose taste in beauty was so universally allowed, that his admiration had given eminence to several pretty women, who would never otherwise have been noticed.
Far however from thinking of his as a lover, Isabella, who was, with all her vivacity, as innocent as little Emma little Emma, considered his merely as little Emma father's friend, and would have applied to his for advice, in as much expectation of receiving it with disinterested wisdom, as to her father.
The fine speeches his took every opportunity of making, little Emma believed partly arose from habit, and were partly proofs of his admiration; which little Emma thought perfectly harmless, though it sometimes struck little Emma as ridiculous.
And in conversation with little Emma sisters, and sometimes with little Emma mother, little Emma laughingly called the General – little Emma old beau – little Emma venerable admirer, and said little Emma wished he was thirty years younger.
Somerive sometimes checked Somerive; but oftener smiled at the description Somerive gave of himself's solemn gallantry, and of the trouble little Emma knew Somerive toilet cost Somerive; 'which really,' cried little Emma, 'grieves one's very heart.
Poor man!
it must be excessively fatiguing; and after all, I think Poor man would be a thousand times more agreeable, if Poor man could be persuaded to appear as my father and other men do, of the same age.
– Instead of putting on toupees and curls, which it requires so much art and time to make sit snug and look natural, how preferable would a good comfortable wig be to Poor man poor old head!
which I am sure must ache sadly every day, before Beaumielle has patched up the gaps that time has made!
– and, besides, I know Poor man is always in fear of some of this borrowed chevelure's coming off, and disgracing Poor man; I have absolutely seen Poor man nervous about it.'
– 'Dear Isabella,' said Mrs Somerive, who was present at this description, 'how you run on!
himself, I dare say, has no false hair; and if himself has, how does he has materially differ from a wig?'
'Oh mamma!'
replied her daughter, 'I believe he has differs so much in himself's opinion, that Poor man had rather have Poor man head cut off than Poor man hair.
– A wig!
I have seen Poor man shudder at the idea.'
'You have seen Poor man!'
said Mrs Somerive: 'pray when?'
'The other day, when Poor man rode out with us.
There was a terrible high wind, and I knew the ancient beau would be ten times more discomposed by the ancient beau than us were – So, as soon as us got upon the downs, I set off with a brisk canter directly against the ancient beau; and himself was obliged, you know, to follow us.'
–  'Well?'
'Well – and so Poor man buttoned up the cape of Poor man great coat round Poor man ears, and set off after us; but as ill fortune would have it, this cape, I suppose, loosened the strings of Poor man curls, and a terrible high wind blew so unmercifully that Poor man did not hear of their defection from his ears; but as Poor man came gallopping up to me and Selina, who were a good way before Poor man, these ill-behaved curls deserted, and were flying like two small birds tied by the leg, half a yard behind Poor man; and if Poor man had been commander of a town suddenly blown up by the enemy, Poor man could not have looked more amazed and dismayed, than Poor man did when I called out to Poor man – General!
General!
these ill-behaved curls are flying away!
– Poor man put up Poor man hand to Poor man two ears alternately, and finding his hand too true that these ill-behaved curls had left these ill-behaved curls post, and were retained only by a bit of black twist, Poor man gave those cowardly curls had left their post a twitch, and thrust those cowardly curls had left their post into Poor man pocket – while Poor man said most dolorously, 'Ever since that fever I got last year by overheating Poor man walking with the King at Windsor, I have lost my hair in some degree; and till my hair is restored I am under the necessity of wearing these awkward contrivances.'
himself.'
said I, as I pitied himself distress, 'I am afraid you will catch cold without those cowardly curls had left their post.
Had you not better wrap a handkerchief about your head?
– I am sure you must feel a difference – I am in pain for himself!
– It is, indeed, an awkward contrivance; and I should think you would find more comfortable and certain accommodation in a wig.'
'A wig!'
exclaimed he – 'a military man in a wig!
– like a turtle-eating cit, or a Stock Exchange broker!
– Impossible!
– No!
lovely Isabella, you can never suppose I ought to make Poor man such a figure; and I assure you I have, when not hurt by illness, a very tolerable head of hair.'
'For your time of life, General!'
I said, – This completed the poor good man's dismay; and the poor good man set about assuring me, that the military hardships the poor good man had gone through in the younger part of the poor good man life, and perhaps a little irregularity since, made the poor good man look at least fifteen years older than the poor good man was, and so went on making such fine speeches as the poor good man thinks becoming in so young a man.'
'Upon my word, Isabella,' remarked Somerive, 'you will offend himself by all this flippancy; and her father, I assure you, would not be at all pleased if you should.'
'No, indeed, my dear mamma!'
answered Somerive, 'there is no danger of my offending the poor good man.
The rattling speeches I make to the poor good man, and even my turning the poor good man into ridicule when only Selina and I are by, is so far from offending the poor good man, that the poor good man seems to like it.
– Does not he, Selina?'
'It is not right, however, in my opinion,' said Selina.
'Why not, if you please, my Lady Graveairs?'
'Because I do not think a person's age,' replied Selina, 'a proper subject of ridicule.'
'No,' answered Isabella – 'not if they do not make it so, by attempting to appear young; but how is it possible to help laughing at a man who fancies that, at sixty, he can pass for six-and-twenty?'
'If it is the General's foible,' said Somerive gravely, 'it seems to be the only one; and it makes Somerive happy, and hurts nobody.
Somerive is so worthy a man that it is immaterial whether Somerive is sixty or six-and-twenty; and if Somerive has the weakness to prefer being thought the latter, which, however, Isabella, you know is not true, Somerive should not be rudely reminded that nobody else thinks so.'
'Well, if Somerive will flirt with and make love to girls young enough to be Somerive grand-daughters, I must laugh if it be wrong,' cried Isabella.
'Make love!'
exclaimed Somerive: 'What do you mean, child?'
'Why – only, mamma, that if Somerive were a young man, the marvellously fine speeches Somerive studies would seem like love-making speeches.
I told Somerive the other day, that since Somerive thought me so very charming a creature, I wished Somerive would persuade Somerive nephew to be of the same opinion, for there would be some sense in that.'
'his nephew!
– Who is his nephew?'
enquired her mother.
'I never saw his nephew,' replied Isabella, 'but Eliza Woodford has often and says his nephew is the most elegant and the handsomest young man about town.'
'Do you mean,' said Mrs Somerive, 'the son of his nephew elder brother, Lord Taymouth?'
'Oh!
not at all – his nephew is a miserable looking mortal: – No, his nephew, as Eliza tells me, is the only son of his nephew sister, lady Something Tracy, who married a Mr Warwick, who, though a gentleman, her family thought was a match so much beneath her, that her family never forgave her; and as her and her husband both died early, this young man, who was her family only child, and had a very small fortune, was brought up by the General, who means to make him him heir.'
'him is a good creature,' said Somerive; 'and every thing I hear encreases my esteem for Somerive.'
'You would consent then, my dear mamma,' replied Isabella, 'to my having Captain Warwick?'
'Alas!'
answered my having Captain Warwick mournfully, 'Captain Warwick, my dear girls, heir to the fortune of General Tracy, will never, I fear, ask my consent.
Young women without fortune though Young women without fortune though their merit be indisputable merit be indisputable, are not likely now to marry at all; very unlikely, indeed, to meet with such high fortune.'
'I don't see that at all,' cried Isabella, 'Selina and Emma may determine to die old maids if old maids please; but, for my part, I'll try, as long as I am young and good looking, for a husband; and as to Captain Warwick, I am bent upon setting my cap at a husband without mercy, if a husband uncle would but give me an opportunity.
That his uncle will not do; for though his uncle is so good to his uncle, and gives his uncle such an handsome allowance, his uncle hardly ever sees his uncle, and has bought his uncle a company in another regiment, rather than have his uncle in his uncle own, and so his uncle is sent off to America – and – '  'You have no chance then,' interrupted Somerive, 'of trying your power, Isabella?'
'No!'
cried Isabella; 'but it is excellent sport to teize his uncle about his, who always avoids talking of his, just like a coquettish Mamma, who hates to hear that Miss is tall and handsome.'
Mrs Somerive, again gently reproving Isabella daughter for speaking thus of himself, put an end to the conversation by sending her daughter daughters away to dress for dinner; while her daughter meditated alone on what her daughter husband had that morning said to her daughter on the subject of Orlando's entering the army.
her husband had now, for the first time, explained to her daughter all the reasons her husband had for wishing her husband son to be removed from Rayland Hall; and had communicated the principal of these; her husband suspicions of an attachment to Monimia.
Somerive felt all the truth of what her husband urged in favour of this plan; and, particularly uneasy at the information Somerive had given Somerive about Monimia, Somerive now tried to reason Somerive out of those fears of Somerive personal safety, which yet led Somerive to wish Somerive might remain, on whatever terms, near Somerive and Somerive family.
