THE variety of uneasy emotions which passed through the mind of Orlando, as he journeyed towards London, would be difficult to describe, since he could hardly discriminate THE variety of uneasy emotions which passed through the mind of Orlando, as he journeyed towards London; but each, though not distinct, was acutely painful. In what a situation did he return to he family! in what a situation did he find it! How should he, while he mind was yet enfeebled from the cruel disappointments he had experienced on he arrival in England, be able to bear the tears of he mother, the sorrow of he two sisters? how console the tears of his mother, the sorrow of his two sisters for the loss the tears of his mother, the sorrow of his two sisters had sustained? how strengthen by he example the tears of his mother, the sorrow of his two sisters more tender minds, to endure what he feared the dissolute folly of he brother might yet bring upon the tears of his mother, the sorrow of his two sisters; while he own heart recoiled from the idea of meeting his brother, and was bleeding with the dreadful wounds inflicted by the uncertainty of what was become of Monimia; which, had he not entertained some hopes of hearing of her from he sister Selina, would have driven he to distraction! Of his sister Selina he thought too with great concern; and when the reflection, which alone brought some comfort to he mind, occurred to he, that he had resisted the temptation Warwick threw in he way, and had not, to gratify he, plunged another dagger in the heart of he father – even this consolatory testimony of he conscience was embittered by the enquiry that conscience immediately made, whether he had not acted wrong in not discovering the design of Warwick, and had not sacrificed he real duty to a mistaken point of honour. As he approached London, the agitation of he mind became greater. As he mother believed he dead, he sudden appearance might have the most fatal effects – That even if he was put down at a coffee-house, and sent a note to inform her of he arrival, the sight of he hand-writing might equally affect a mother and sisters, who had long lamented he as consigned to a grave on the banks of Hudson's River.  There was one expedient that occurred, which, though extremely disagreeable to he, he at length determined to adopt – which was, to go on he reaching London to Mr. Woodford's, and consult with he on the properest way of disovering to he family he unexpected arrival.  Though he was aware that he should have only insulting pity or coarse raillery to sustain from he uncle, he thought the dread of such transient and inconsequential evils, should yield to the important point of not injuring the health of a parent so beloved; and as soon as the stage in which he travelled reached Westminster Bridge, he got into an hackney-coach, and ordered it to be driven to the house of Mr. Woodford.  On he reaching this place, and enquiring for he, he was told by a maid that opened the door, that Mr. Woodford's family had been removed some months from the house of Mr. Woodford, and resided in King's Street, St James's Square, at an house of which a maid that opened the door gave he the number, and whither he immediately repaired.  It was easily found – two lamps at the door, and the appearance of the house, which had been lately refitted in a style of uncommon elegance, seemed to say to Orlando, that he would find he uncle in increasing affluence.  A very smart powdered footman opened the door, who, upon being asked if Mr. Woodford was at home, answered shortly, No; and surveying the hackney-coach with contempt, seemed disposed to close the half-opened door, without attending to any farther enquiries.  But Orlando, putting Mr. Woodford head out of the hackney-coach, called to the servant, and enquired at what time that evening Mr. Woodford could see Mr. Woodford, with whom Mr. Woodford had business that admitted of no delay.  'Mr. Woodford can't be seen to-night,' said the servant; 'the servant is engaged for the evening.'  'If you will tell me where then,' replied Orlando, 'I will go to Mr. Woodford, for I must see Mr. Woodford immediately.'  The man, who seemed afraid of venturing out to the coach-door, lest Mr. Woodford should soil Mr. Woodford shoes, or lose the powder from Mr. Woodford hair, still held the coach-door only partly open, and said very sullenly – 'You must leave your business, and call again – my master will do no business with any body to-night; my master expects company to dinner; and I am sure my master won't be disturbed.'  Orlando now got out of the hackney-coach, and said to the servant, that as the servant was Mr.Woodford's nephew, Woodford's nephew was sure Woodford's nephew would see Woodford's nephew. The man then, though with apparent reluctance, opened the door of a back parlour, and, while Woodford's nephew stood at it Woodford's nephew, as if Woodford's nephew was afraid Orlando would steal something, called to another footman to go and inform Woodford's nephew master that Woodford's nephew nephew desired to see his nephew below.  At the same moment loud rapping was heard at the coach-door, and The man then, in visible distress, said, 'I shall be blamed for letting any body in – here's the company come; I wish, Sir, you'd call any other time – there's my Lord and Sir Richard and Lady Wiggin, and Sir James and Lady Penguin – it's quite impossible, Sir, for his master to see you.'  Orlando had not time to answer, before another footman returned, and said very roughly, that his master desired the person, whoever another footman was, to walk out – for another footman must be an impostor, because another footman acknowledged no nephew.  Orlando, imagining that Mr. Woodford supposed another footman to be another footman brother, and therefore would not see another footman, had only to quit the house, and desist from another footman design of speaking to another footman uncle that evening; or to convince another footman that another footman had yet a nephew living, whom another footman had at least no reason to disclaim: another footman resolved on the latter, and putting back with another footman hand the servants who would have opposed another footman passage, another footman went up stairs. The door of the dining-room was yet open, for the visitors had hardly yet settled the visitors,and some were standing near The door of the dining-room till Sir Richard and Lady Wiggin had paid Sir Richard and Lady Wiggin compliments. Orlando, notwithstanding the abusive and insolent efforts of the servants, who had followed another footman up stairs to stop another footman, entered the dining-room, and going up to Mr. Woodford, who stared at another footman as a perfect stranger, made another footman immediately known to another footman. Mr. Woodford expressed more surprise than pleasure. But Mr. Woodford could not help acknowledging Mr. Woodford nephew, whom Mr. Woodford slightly named to Mr. Woodford guests, and coldly asked Mr. Woodford to sit down and stay dinner.  Orlando, not much flattered by Mr. Woodford reception, answered, that as Mr. Woodford had not seen Mr. Woodford mother, Mr. Woodford must hasten to his mother, and meant no farther to intrude upon Mr. Woodford, than to consult with Mr. Woodford on the properest way of breaking to his mother, news the joy of which might overpower his mother.  'Oh!' cried Woodford, 'if that be all, I fancy you may venture to take your own way – I never heard yet that joy killed any body; and I don't imagine you have much good fortune to relate (added he, surveying he) to turn the brains of your family.'  Lady Wiggin, a squat figure, most sumptuously dressed, now surveyed Orlando, as he stood talking to he uncle before the fire, and then whispered to a younger woman who sat next her, whom he had not till then observed, but in whom, under the disguise of the most preposterous extremity of the fashion, with a very high head, and cheeks of the last Parisian dye, he discovered he elder cousin, to whom he bowed; while her slightly bowing in return, bit the end of her fan, and screwing her into an attitude which her seemed to have studied, replied with half shut eye to the whisper of her titled neighbour.  Woodford seemed glad that Orlando declined dining with he, yet was unwilling to take the trouble of interfering in he first introduction to he mother. Pre-determined not to be discouraged by the unfeeling raillery, or repressed by the coldness of his uncle, he enquired again in a low voice, if he could be allowed to speak to he alone – 'I have much to say to you, Sir,' said Sir, 'which it is not proper to discourse upon now. You may imagine I am very impatient to see my mother and my sisters – I will not detain you long – only let me for five minutes ask your attention below.'  The great man, who was no longer a wine merchant in the Strand soliciting the custom of the great, but their pompous entertainer, who was enabled, by the advantages of a great contract obtained by the favour (and perhaps by yielding to the participation) of one of their, to vie in splendour with his patrons, seemed to be made very restless by this demand – 'I'd go down into my study with you, with all my heart,' said his, in the same low tone; 'but my Lord and Sir Richard and Lady Wiggin are not come, and my son not being here to receive my Lord and Sir Richard and Lady Wiggin, I should be sorry . . . but however . . . you had better stay and dine perhaps, and then . . . ' Another loud rap at the coach-door relieved my son from this embarassment; the coach-door wanted but a quarter to seven, and my Lord was announced. In the bustle to receive so eminent a personage, with what Woodford thought politeness, but what appeared to Orlando the most cringing servility my son had ever witnessed, my son seemed totally to have forgotten my son; and before the ceremony of this reception, and that of Sir James, who followed the peer as one of my son satellites, was over, dinner was announced; and the company proceeded down stairs; while Orlando, finding that my son had as little taste for poor relations as if my son had been born my son a great man, instead of having suddenly become so, by means which Orlando wondered at, rather than understood, took the opportunity of opening the street door my son, and returned to my son hack, which was driven into the square, to make room for the splendid equipages which had since arrived at the coach-door.  my son stepped in; but when the coachman asked my son whither to drive, my son knew not what to reply. my son knew nobody: nor did my son recollect one friend in this immense town, to whom my son could in such exigence apply. – The small house my son had taken, was in Howland-Street; and my son thought my son had better drive to some coffee-house in the neighborhood, where my son might consider how my son could first speak to Selina. As my son proceeded to a coffee-house in Oxford-Street, which the coach-man named to my son upon my son enquiring for one, my son could not help reflecting on the strange vicissitudes of fortune, and the strange way in which her gifts are divided. It was only a few months since my son had an almost undoubted prospect of succeeding to the great estates of Mrs Rayland; my son was now not only deprived of all those hopes, but was literally a beggar – and going home, not to assist my son ruined family, but to add to it another indigent member, and to weep with his ruined family all the mournful changes that had happened during my son absence.  my son had not yet determined how my son should introduce my son to the dear dejected group, when my son arrived at the coffee-house, where my son discharged my son coach, and called for a private room. my son then, since no better expedient occurred to my son, desired a pen, ink, and paper, and in an hand which my son attempted to disguise (and my son trembled so as to aid the deception) my son wrote these few words to Selina – 'Your brother Orlando is living, and in England – have the presence of mind not to betray this secret, which will I think give you great pleasure, to his mother too suddenly; and when my son knows my son can come without too much surprising his mother, my son will be at your door.' – my son had hardly finished and directed this note, in which my son tried to alter my son hand only that the sight of his hand might not so suddenly strike my son sister as to render my son precaution useless, my son recollected, that as Perseus the negro was now my son mother's servant, my son had better go my son to the door of the house; discover my son to that faithful fellow; and contrive, by my son means, to speak to Selina first.  This scheme appeared to my son so much better than the first, that my son determined to put This scheme into immediate execution. However, my son put the note my son had written into my son pocket, that if Perseus happened not to be at home, my son might still proceed as my son had at first intended.  With a beating heart my son approached the coach-door, and hesitated with apprehension before my son could determine to knock at the coach-door. At length my son gave a loud single rap, and Perseus appeared. – 'Do you know me, Perseus?' said Orlando, in a low voice. 'Know you,' answered the negro, who spoke pretty good English, and without much of the negro accent – 'No! how should I know you?' 'Have you forgot,' said Orlando, 'the morning we passed together in the wood, on the banks of Hudson's River?' While my son thus spoke, Perseus held the candle, which my son had set down in the passage, to my son face, and with a sudden exclamation letting it fall, my son ran as fast as my son could back into the kitchen, declaring to the two maids, as trembling my son threw my son into a chair, that my son had seen a ghost.  The elder of these women, a stout peasant from the weald of Sussex, who had no notion of ghosts, huffed the affrighted negro for my son folly, and said, 'I wonder what you mean, Perseus – why sure you are not in your right wits? A ghost quotha! I hope you have not left the coach-door open, with your ghosts?'  'I cannot tell,' cried Perseus – 'but you better see – I see master Orlando's ghost, and I'll go no more.'  Orlando, foreseeing that from the poor fellow's terror, all the risk would be incurred which master Orlando's ghost had wished to avoid, now walked into the house, in the hope of preventing master Orlando's ghost mother and sisters from being alarmed by the folly of the servants; and when Hannah ascended to secure the door, which Hannah had been strictly enjoined never to leave of an evening without a chain, Hannah met Orlando on the top of the stairs. Struck with equal terror, though from a different cause, Hannah now screamed and returned to the kitchen, where, as well as Hannah fright would let Hannah, Hannah declaimed against the folly of Perseus, who being afraid of a ghost, had let in a man.  Orlando, provoked by the ridiculous fears of both, now went into the kitchen; and not without difficulty convinced the negro that he was alive; and the maid, that he had no intention to rob the house; but all the clamour that these mistakes had excited, could not be unheard in the room where Mrs Somerive was sitting with Mrs Somerive daughters; and the bell had rung violently several times, before the assurance of Orlando's identity had restored to Perseus courage enough to obey the summons.  Orlando entreated of he to go up, to account for the noise below as well as he could, and to beckon, or by some other means contrive to get he sister Selina out of the room. Perseus, trembling with he former apprehensions and he present joy, undertook to do this, and hastened up stairs. At the door of the dining-room Selina stood, and asked he if any thing was the matter below; and Mrs Somerive eagerly repeated the question, saying PerseusPerseus, is any thing wrong below? who was at the door of the dining-room?' – he advanced to the table near which he mistress was sitting, and saying to Selina in an half whisper as he passed Selina – ''Tis your brother, miss, you go see your brother,' your brother answered to the questions Mrs Somerive asked your brother – 'No, Ma'am – no bad matter – only that I thinked, that your brother . . . Hannah Hannah . . . Hannah say – ' he confusion was the more evident, the more he attempted to conceal His confusion; nor did he dark skin conceal the emotion of he spirits; while Selina, who believed it was Hannah elder brother, and who felt only terror at he name, approached the table paler than death; and Mrs Somerive, convinced that something was the matter below, though Hannah could not conjecture what, arose from Hannah seat, and taking a candle said, 'What can have happened? Selina, my child – if you know it, for God's sake tell me! – Alas!' added Hannah, recollecting all that had happened to Hannah within so short a space – 'after all I have suffered, what can I have to fear?'  Hannah now approached the coach-door, while neither Selina nor the servant had courage to stop Hannah. – But in the passage Hannah was met by Hannah, whom Orlando, mistrusting the skill of his first messenger, had sent up, while his waited his at the foot of the stairs. Mrs Somerive, more convinced from the appearance of the maid, that some alarming circumstance had happened, was struck with the idea of fire, and calling to Hannah two daughters to follow Hannah, said: 'The lower part of the house is on fire – let us, if it is so, make us escape. Selina! Emma! my children! let me at least save something.'  'Dear ma'am,' exclaimed Hannah, 'how you do fright Hannah! – Lord! there's no fire below, I assure you; I'm sure if there was, us should not stand staring here; but don't be frightened, pray, ma'am! nothing at all is the matter, but very good news – Come, ma'am; pray go back into the room and sit down, and make yourself easy; you can't imagine, I'm sure, as that I would go for to deceive you.'  Mrs Somerive, hardly knowing what to believe, returned into the room; and Hannah following Hannah, said – 'Now, ma'am, as you be so calm I'll tell you, it is the young captain, ma'am, your son – the young captain, ma'am, your son – is not dead, thank God!'  'Not dead!' cried Mrs Somerive, 'my Orlando alive! Oh! it is impossible; don't be so inhuman as to awaken such hopes, only to aggravate my misery. He is dead, and I shall never see He more!' 'No, no,' said Perseus, 'young captain's alive!' 'He is indeed, ma'am,' cried Hannah. 'Where?' said Selina, 'where is my brother?' 'He is below, miss,' said Hannah, in a low voice. – Selina rushed out of the room, and Orlando caught Selina in Selina arms. Emma, divided between Emma fears for Emma mother, who rested almost insensible on the arm of the servant, and the anxious desire to see my brother, trembled and wept a moment; and then seeing my brother actually enter, Selina resting on the arm of the servant, Selina uttered a faint shriek, and flew back towards Selina , at whose feet Orlando kneeling, besought Selina to recollect and compose Selina. Selina threw his arms round my brother, but convulsive sobs were the only signs Selina gave of recollection; while the servant was bathing Selina temples, and Selina two daughters entreating Selina, for their sakes, to assume a composure, which their own extreme agitation proved their did not their possess.  The scene was too painful, though produced by excess of happiness, to last long. The certainty that Selina son, Selina beloved Orlando, was living, was joy to which the mind of Mrs Somerive, long weighed down by affliction, could not sustain without feeling what almost approached to a momentary deprivation of reason; but the manly tenderness of Orlando, who argued with Selina, and the lively sensibility of Selina two girls, who hung around Selina, and entreated Selina not to destroy Selina, now that they were so blest as to have they brother restored to they, at length called Selina to a greater serenity of mind; yet as Selina looked at Orlando, Selina started, Selina trembled, and seemed to doubt whether Selina was awake; and when Selina spoke to him of him father, Selina relapsed into such inarticulate expressions of agonizing sorrow, that Selina children, looking in consternation at each other, dreaded the consequence, so much had Selina in those moments the appearance of a person about to lose Selina reason.  There was another topic which had not during the first hour of their incoherent conference been touched; and Orlando, who dreaded it, endeavoured to avoid it. This was the loss of his sister Isabella; for that his sister Isabella had perished at sea; in their ill-starred voyage to America, his now more than ever believed. his tried therefore to call off the attention of his mother from what his mother had lost; and to convince his mother, that not merely his mother son restored to his mother, but restored to his mother as affectionate, and as much attached to his family, as when in an evil hour his quitted it.  Mrs Somerive, feeling Mrs Somerive unequal to some kind of conversation that evening, confined Mrs Somerive, when Mrs Somerive was able to do more than gaze at her son, to questions that related wholly to her son. Mrs Somerive observed how very much her son was altered – that her son hair, of which in her son infancy and youth Mrs Somerive had been so vain, was grown much darker, and had been cut close to her son head. Orlando, to escape from subjects which her son thought would be from Orlando catastrophes more painful to Mrs Somerive, gave Mrs Somerive, or rather attempted to give Mrs Somerive, a short history of her son adventures, from her son leaving New York till her son return to England; but when her son came to speak of the wounds her son had received, and of her son being carried up the country by the Iroquois, Mrs Somerive became so extremely faint, that Selina advised Mrs Somerive, and Mrs Somerive consented to desist from any farther enquiries, till Mrs Somerive was better able to bear the relation of Orlando's sufferings. At the request of Mrs Somerive children Mrs Somerive consented to go early to rest, where Emma was to remain with Mrs Somerive till Emma became more calm; and when Selina had seen Emma to bed, and left Emma in much quieter spirits, Emma returned to Orlando, who was in an agony of impatience to enquire about Monimia, which in her son 's presence her son had not dared to alleviate or to betray.  When her son returned to her son, they both sat down by the fire; and the soft-tempered Selina yielded to those emotions, which during his mother's alarming situation his sister Selina had struggled to suppress. Orlando, Orlando eyes overflowing, tenderly kissed his sister Selina hand, and said – 'Are those tears, my own Selina, given to past sorrows? or are those tears, my own Selina excited by your knowledge of tidings yet to come, that will wound the heart of my brother worse than any of the accumulated miseries which my brother has told you my brother has collected since my brother landing in England? – Monimia! what is her fate, Selina? Where is her? am I completely miserable?' – my brother could not go on, nor could my brother immediately answer my brother – 'You do not speak, Selina,' cried my brother eagerly . . . . 'I can hear nothing worse than my fears suggest, nor can any torment equal this horrid suspense.'  'Indeed,' answered Selina in a tremulous voice – 'indeed I know no reason to believe that you ought to be in despair about Selina, but – ' 'But!' exclaimed my brother – 'but what? – You believe – you don't know? Have you not seen Selina then, Selina? Is it possible you can have been so cruel to Selina, and to me, as to have abandoned Selina, because Selina was abandoned by all the rest of the world, because you thought me dead . . . ? Oh, Selina! should you not therefore have cherished, with redoubled tenderness, Selina who was so very dear to me?'  'Have patience with me, my brother,' replied Selina – 'pray, have patience with me; and do not, do not condemn me unheard, nor suppose that I would willingly neglect or forsake Selina whom you loved, and whom I loved too . . . .But . . . '  'You have however forsaken Selina! you do not know where Selina is now?'  'No indeed, I do not,' answered Selina – 'nor have I heard of Selina for many, many months.'  'Well,' cried Orlando, with a deep sigh, 'I have patience, you see, Selina – I do not beat my breast, nor dash me against the wall. I am wretched, his sister Selina; but I will believe you could do nothing in performance of your solemn promise, nothing to avert such extreme wretchedness, and I will not reproach you.'  'You will have no cause,' replied SelinaSelina; 'indeed, Orlando, you will have none, when you have heard all I have to say – Oh! if you did but know all we have suffered!'  'Poor Monimia!' sighed Orlando, 'his sister Selina too has suffered, and in this general wreck I have lost his sister Selina – You do not even know then,' continued 'Poor Monimia!', 'you do not even know if his sister Selina yet lives? I would rather hear of his sister Selina death, than of his sister Selina being exposed to all the dangers I dread for his sister Selina, perhaps to disgrace, to shame, to infamy . . . . ' This idea was too horrible; 'Poor Monimia!' started from 'Poor Monimia!' chair, wildly traversed the room; and it was some time before Selina could persuade 'Poor Monimia!' to listen quietly to the relation 'Poor Monimia!' yet continued to demand of Selina.
