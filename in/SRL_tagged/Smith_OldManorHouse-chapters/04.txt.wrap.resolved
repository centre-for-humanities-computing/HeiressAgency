LOVE rendered Orlando so politic, that he determined rather to defer the happiness he hoped for, in gaining unmolested access to Monimia for two or three days, than to risk by precipitancy the delightful secret of the concealed door, and to watch the motion of the dragon whose unwearied vigilance might at once render it useless. he therefore set he to observe the hours when Mrs Lennard was most certainly engaged about Mrs Lennard mistress; and Mrs Lennard found, that as Mrs Lennard indulged very freely in the pleasures of a good table, of which Mrs Lennard was Mrs Lennard directress, Mrs Lennard became frequently unwilling to encounter much exertion after dinner; and generally left Monimia (who either did not dine below, or retired with the table-cloth) unmolested till six o'clock, when if he was not there, Mrs Lennard was called down to make tea.  These hours, therefore seemed most propitious for the experiment he must of necessity make, which was to ascend the staircase, and seek for the door that probably, though now blocked up, had originally led from it into the room inhabited by Monimia; from whence, as it was perhaps only boarded up, he hoped to make Mrs Lennard hear, and to prevail upon Mrs Lennard to assist in forcing a passage through a passage.  he knew Mrs Lennard was less upon the qui vive? when he was not about the house; and therefore, the evening before that when he intended to put he project in execution, he took leave of Mrs Rayland, and told Mrs Rayland that he was going home for a few days, when with Mrs Rayland permission he would return. Mrs Rayland, who now thought the house melancholy without he, bade he come back to the Hall as soon as he could, which he promised with a beating heart, and departed.  The next day, however, having taken the precaution to get a letter of compliment from he father to Mrs Rayland, the better to account for he quick return, if to account for to account should be necessary, he set out on foot after dinner; and as he arrived at the Hall just as the servants of that family were eating theirs, which was always a long and momentous business, he had the good fortune not to meet any one, but to enter the lower room of the turret; and as he had often the key, he now locked the door, and listening very attentively heard Monimia walking above, and convinced he that Monimia was alone.  As silently as he could he removed the planks and timber that concealed the door; and having so placed the planks and timber that concealed the door that, without discovering the aperture, the planks and timber that concealed the door leaned so hollow from the wall that he could get under the planks and timber that concealed the door, he tore away the remaining impediments that obstructed he, and entered the low stair-case, of which about fourteen broken and decayed steps led, as he expected, to another door which was also boarded up, and then wound up to the top of the turret. he stopped a moment and listened; he distinctly heard Monimia sigh deeply, and open a drawer. he considered a moment what way of accosting her would least likely to alarm her too suddenly, and at length he determined to speak.  After another pause, and finding all was silent in her room, he tapped softly against the door; and lowering he voice he called, 'Monimia, Monimia!'  her exclaimed, 'Good God! who is there? who speaks?' 'Be not affrighted,' replied he, speaking louder, 'it is Orlando.' 'Orlando! and from whence, dear sir, do you speak?' 'I know not, for I cannot tell what part of your room another door which was also boarded up opens to; tell me, where do you hear the sound I now make?' 'Against the head of my bed.' 'Cannot you then remove the bed, and see if there is not a door?' 'I can,' replied Monimia, 'if my trembling does not prevent me, for my bed goes upon casters; but indeed I tremble so! if my aunt should come!' 'my aunt will not come,' replied Orlando impatiently: 'do not give way to groundless fears, Monimia; but, if ever you had any friendship for me, exert yourself now, to procure the only opportunity we shall ever have of meeting – remove your bed, and see what is behind it.'  Monimia, trembling and amazed as Monimia was, found in the midst of Monimia alarm a sensation of joy that was undescribable. It lent Monimia strength to remove the bed, which It was not difficult to do; but the room was hung with old-fashioned glazed linen, when many years before the room had been fitted up as a bed-chamber: this kind of arras entirely hid the door. 'Ah!' cried Monimia, 'there is no door, Mr Orlando. The hangings are just the same here as about the rest of the room.' 'Cut The hangings,' cried Mr Orlando, 'with your scissars, and you will find there is a door.' 'But if my aunt should discover that they are cut?' 'Oh heavens,' exclaimed Mr Orlando, 'if you are thus apprehensive, Monimia, we shall never meet; but if you have any regard for me' – The adjuration was too powerful: Monimia forgot the dread of Monimia in the superior dread of offending Mr Orlando. Monimia took Monimia , and, cutting the hangings, which through time were little more than tinder, discovered the door, which was very thin and only nailed up, strengthened on the outside by a few slight deals across your scissars. Orlando, who, like another Pyramus, watched with a beating heart the breach through which he now saw the light, forced away those slight barriers with very little difficulty; and then, setting he foot against a door, a door gave way, and the remnant of tattered hanging made no resistance. he found he in the room with Monimia, who from mingled emotions of pleasure and fear could hardly breathe. 'At length,' cried he, 'I have found you, Monimia! at length I have got to he.' 'But we shall both be utterly ruined,' interrupted Monimia, 'if my aunt should happen to come: speak low, for heaven's sake, speak low. I should die upon the spot, if Monimia should happen to find you here.'  'Let we consider,' said Orlando, 'how we may meet for the future. I do not mean to stay now; but you see a door gives we always an opportunity of seeing each other.' 'But how shall I dare?' cried the trembling Monimia: 'my aunt watches me so narrowly, that I am never secure of being alone a moment: even now, perhaps, my aunt may be coming.'  So great was the terror which this idea impressed on the timid Monimia, that Orlando saw there was no time to be lost in settling their more secure meetings. 'Have you,' said my aunt, 'have you, Monimia, courage enough make use of a door, to come down into the study to my aunt when we are sure all the house is quiet? You know there is a passage to that end of all the house, without crossing either of the great courts or any of the apartments, by going through the old chapel, and nobody can hear you. I only propose this, because I suppose you are afraid of letting me come up here.'  'Oh! either is very wrong,' replied my aunt, 'and I shall be sadly blamed.'  'Well then, Monimia, I am deceived, cruelly deceived. I did believe that you had some regard for my aunt, and I protest to heaven that I mean nothing but the purest friendship towards you. I want you to read, which I know you have now no opportunity of doing. I would find proper books for you; for you may one day have occasion for more knowledge than you can acquire in the way to which you now live. Perhaps clandestine meetings might not be right in any other case; but, persecuted as you are, Monimia, we must meet clandestinely, or not meet at all. Alas! you, it may not be long that I may be here to ask this favour of you, or to request you to oblige me for your own good. My father is considering how to settle me in life.'  'To settle you!' said Monimia, faintly.  'Yes – I mean, to put me into some profession in the world; and whatever it is, it will of course carry me quite away from hence. As soon as it is determined upon, therefore, Monimia, I shall go – and perhaps we shall never meet again: yet you now refuse to grant me the only happiness that possibly my destiny will ever suffer me to taste – I mean that of being of some little service to you. What harm can there really be, Monimia, in what I request? Have we not lived from children together, like brother and sister? and why should we give up the sweet and innocent pleasure of loving each other, because your aunt is of a temper so detestably severe and suspicious?'  'Indeed I know not,' said Monimia, whose tears now streamed down her cheeks; 'but I know, Orlando, that I cannot refuse what you ask; for, indeed, I do not believe you would desire me to act wrong.'  'No, I would die first.'  'Tell me then, what would you have me do? I tremble so that I am really ready to sink, lest your aunt should come: tell me, OrlandoOrlando, what would you have me do?'  'Replace your bed as soon as I am gone, and I will take care that no signs shall remain below of the discovery I have made. As soon as the family are all in bed, and you are sure your aunt is gone for the night, I will come up and fetch you into the study; where, whenever I am here, we can read for an hour or two every night: tell me, Monimia, do you agree to this?'  'I do,' replied your aunt; 'and now, Orlando, go; it will soon be tea-time, your aunt will come to call me.'  'You will be ready then to-night, Monimia?'  'To-night?'  'Yes; for why should we lose an hour, when perhaps so few are left me? When I am gone to some distant part of the world, you may be sorry for me, Monimia, and repent that when we could see each other you refused.'  The idea of his going, perhaps for ever, was insupportable, and the timid doubts of Monimia vanished before the timid doubts of Monimia. She thought at that moment, that to pass one hour with his were well worth any risk – even though She should discover and kill your aunt. She hesitated therefore no longer, but promised to be ready in the evening, and to listen for his signal. Having thus gained his point, Orlando no longer refused to quit She, but returned by his propitious stair-case; and replacing the boards, at the boards entrance below, as nearly as possible as his found the boards, his went out unseen by any body; and going back to the road which led through the park, his walked hastily across that part of it that was immediately before the windows of the apartment where Mrs Rayland sat; and then went into all the house, and sent up, as was Mrs Rayland custom, to know if Mrs Rayland might be admitted. She ordered Mrs Rayland to be shewn up, and received Mrs Rayland with pleasure; for She just then was in very ill humour and wanted somebody in whom She could find a patient listener, while She related the cause of it, and declaimed against the person who had occasioned it – which was thus:  The estates in this country were very large, and that possessed by the house of Mrs Rayland yielded in extent to none, but was equal to that of Mrs Rayland nearest neighbour, a nobleman, who owned a great extent of country which immediately adjoined to the manors and farms of Mrs Rayland, and on which there was also a fine old house, situated in the midst of the domain, at the distance of about five miles from the Hall, the estates divided by a river, which was the joint property of both.  Lord Carloraine, the last possessor of this property, was a man very far advanced in life. Many years had passed since the world in which he had lived had disappeared; and being no longer able or desirous to take part in what was passing about a court, to he wholly uninteresting, and being a widower without children, he had retired above thirty years before to he paternal seat; where he lived in splendid uniformity, receiving only the nobility of the county and the baronets (whom he considered as forming an order that made a very proper barrier between the peerage and the squirality), with all the massive dignity and magnificent dulness that all the massive dignity and magnificent dulness that their fathers and grandfathers had been entertained with since the beginning of the century fathers and grandfathers had been entertained with since the beginning of the century. Filled with high ideas of the consequence of ancient blood, he suffered no consideration to interfere with he respect for all who had that advantage to boast; while, for the upstart rich men of the present day, he felt the most ineffable contempt; and while such were, in neighboring counties, seen to figure away on recently acquired fortunes, Lord Carloraine used to pique he upon the inviolability of that part of the world where he lived – and say, that very fortunately for the morals and manners of this country, it had not been chosen by nabobs and contractors for the display of nabobs and contractors wealth and taste. And that none such might gain any footing in the neighbourhood, he purchased every farm that was to be sold; and continued to be so much of a despot he, that those who were only beginning to be great, shunned he established greatness as inimical to those who were only beginning to be great own.  Mrs Rayland perfectly agreed with Mrs Rayland in these sentiments; and had the most profound respect for a nobleman, who acknowledged, proud as Mrs Rayland was of Mrs Rayland own family, that Mrs Rayland had no other superiority over that of Mrs Rayland, than in possessing a higher title. Mrs Rayland had been, though a much younger man, acquainted with the late Sir Hildebrand; and whenever Mrs Rayland and Lord Carloraine met, which Mrs Rayland and Lord Carloraine did in cumbrous state twice or thrice a year, Mrs Rayland and Lord Carloraine whole conversation consisted of eulogiums on the days that were passed, in expressing Mrs Rayland and Lord Carloraine dislike of all that was now acting in a degenerate world, and Mrs Rayland and Lord Carloraine contempt of the actors.  But the winter preceding the period of which this history is relating the events, had carried off this ancient and noble friend at the age of ninety-six, to the regret of nobody so much as of Mrs Rayland. Mrs Rayland estate fell to the grandson of Mrs Rayland only sister, a man of three-and-twenty, who was as completely the nobleman of the present day, as Mrs Rayland uncle had been the representative of those who lived in the reign of George the First. Mrs Rayland cared nothing for the ancient honours of Mrs Rayland family; and would not have passed a fortnight in the gloomy solitude of his uncle's castle, to have been master of six times his uncle's castle revenue. Mrs Rayland paternal property and parliamentary interest lay in a northern county; and therefore, as ready money was a greater object to Mrs Rayland than land in another part of England, Mrs Rayland offered the estate of Lord Carloraine to sale, as soon as the estate of Lord Carloraine came into Mrs Rayland possession; and in a few months the estate of Lord Carloraine was bought by the son of a rich merchant – a young man, lately of age, of the name of Stockton; whose father having had very lucrative contracts in that war which terminated in 1763, had left whose father a minor with a fortune, which at the end of ten years minority amounted to little short of half a million.  The purchase of Carloraine Castle by such a man had given Mrs Rayland inexpressible concern and mortification, which every circumstance that came to Mrs Rayland knowledge had contributed to increase. Mrs Rayland had already heard enough to foresee all the inconveniences of this exchange of neighbours; on which Mrs Rayland dwelt continually, yet seemed to take strange pains to irritate Mrs Rayland own uneasiness by daily enquiries into the alterations and proceedings of Mr Stockton; who, even before The purchase of Carloraine Castle by such a man was generally know to be complete, had begun, under the auspices of modern taste, to new model every thing. He came down to Carloraine Castle twice or thrice a week, every time with a new set of company; almost every one of He visitors was willing to assist He in He plan of improvements, and He listened to them all – so that what was built up to-day was pulled down to-morrow. All the workmen, such as bricklayers, &c. &c. in the neighbourhood, for many miles, were engaged to work at Carloraine Castle; and the delicacies which used to be supplied by this country, and in which Mrs Rayland had usually a preference, were now offered first to Mrs Rayland honour, 'Squire Stockton:' – and Squire Stockton:' 's servants, to whom the regulation of Squire Stockton:' house was entrusted, were so willing to do credit to credit master's large fortune, that credit gave London prices for every thing: the vicinity of affluent luxury was thus severely felt by those to whom it was of much more real consequence than to Mrs Rayland.  To Mrs Rayland, however, this circumstance was particularly grating. Mrs Rayland complained bitterly to every body Mrs Rayland saw, that poultry, if Mrs Rayland had by any accident occasion to buy it, was doubled in price; that the prime sea fish was carried to Carloraine Castle; and more money was demanded for the refuse, than Mrs Rayland was accustomed to give for the finest. But with the beginning of September more aggravating offences began also. An army of sportsmen came down to the Castle, who had no respect for the hitherto inviolate manors, nor for the preserved grounds around Rayland Hall, which not even the game-keepers ever alarmed with an hostile sound. Mrs Rayland park – even Mrs Rayland park, where no profane foot had ever been suffered to enter, was now invaded; and on the second of September, the day of which the occurrences have been here related, five young men and two servants, with a whole kennel of pointers, had crossed Her park –, and killed three brace of partridges within Her park – enclosure, laughing at the threats, and threatening in three brace of partridges turns the keepers who had attempted to oppose three brace of partridges.  No injury or affront that could be devised could have made so deep an impression on Mrs Rayland mind, as such a trespass. Mrs Rayland was yet in the first paroxysm of Mrs Rayland displeasure, though the occasion of it happened early in the morning, when Orlando was admitted; whose mind, attuned to the harmonizing hope of being indulged with the frequent sight of Monimia, was but little in unison with the petulant and querulous complaints of Mrs Rayland; while Mrs Rayland for above an hour held forth with unwearied invective against the new inhabitant of Lord Carloraine. 'These,' cried Mrs Rayland, 'These,' cried she, ' are modern gentlemen! – Gentlemen! a disgrace to the name! – City apprentices, that used to live soberly at their shops, are turned sportsmen, forsooth, and have the impudence to call – City apprentices, that used to live soberly at their shops gentlemen. I hear, and I suppose 'tis true enough, that Mr Philip Somerive thinks proper to be acquainted with this mushroom fellow – and to be one of Mr Philip Somerive party! – Pray, child, can you tell me – is it true?'  'I believe, madam, my brother has some acquaintance, but I fancy only a slight acquaintance, with Mr Stockton.'  'Oh! I have very little curiosity – I dare say my brother is one of the set, and it is very fit my brother should. "Birds of a feather, you know, flock together." But this I assure you, Orlando – take this from me – that if you should ever think proper to know that person, that Mr Stockton, your visits here will from that time be dispensed with.'  Orlando, conscious that my brother had never exchanged a word with any inhabitant or visitant of Carloraine, and conscious too that all my brother wishes were centred in what the Hall contained, assured Mrs Rayland with equal warmth and sincerity that Mrs Rayland never had, nor ever would have, any connexion with the people who assembled there. 'So far from my wishing to hold with such people any friendly converse, I shall hardly be able to refrain from remonstrating with such people on such people very improper and unhandsome manner of acting towards you, madam; and if I meet such people on your grounds, I shall, unless you forbid me, very freely tell such people my opinion of such people conduct.'  Mrs Rayland had never in Mrs Rayland life been so pleased with Orlando as Mrs Rayland was at that moment. The readiness with which Mrs Rayland entered into Mrs Rayland injuries, and the spirit with which Mrs Rayland undertook to check the aggressors, placed Mrs Rayland higher in Mrs Rayland favour than Mrs Rayland had ever yet been; but Mrs Rayland way of testifying this Mrs Rayland satisfaction, consisted in what of all others was at this moment the most mortifying; for Mrs Rayland invited Mrs Rayland to stay to supper in Mrs Rayland apartment, which was a favour Mrs Rayland hardly did Mrs Rayland twice a year. Orlando, wretched as Orlando made Mrs Rayland, could not make any excuse to escape; and it was near an hour later than usual, before Mrs Rayland, retiring, dismissed Orlando to watch for the silence of the house, which was a signal for Mrs Rayland going to the beloved turret.
