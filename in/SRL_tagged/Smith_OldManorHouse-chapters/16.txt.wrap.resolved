THE family of Somerive was almost the only one in the country, or at least within five and twenty miles, who had not waited on Mr Stockton after Mr Stockton purchasing the estates of Lord Carloraine. For Somerive had several reasons. Though Somerive disdained any mean compliances with the caprices of Mrs Rayland, Somerive thought it wrong to connect Somerive with a man who, on Somerive first appearance in the country, had offended her unhandsomely enough; and Somerive knew it would not only be impolitic in regard to her, but to the economy of Somerive own family. Somerive servants, plain and laborious, were at present content with His servants, plain and laborious portion of work and of wages; but were His servants, plain and laborious once introduced into such a servants hall as that of the Castle, where the same profusion reigned as was customary in the parlour, Somerive knew His servants, plain and laborious would immediately become discontented, and of course troublesome and useless. The people whom Somerive found were generally assembled at the Castle, most of The people whom he found young men, celebrated for The people whom he found dissolute manners, were not such as Somerive wished to have introduced to Somerive daughters. And these causes co-operating to make Somerive wish to avoid every acquaintance with Mr Stockton, Somerive had taken some pains to prevail on Somerive eldest son to avoid it also; but Philip Somerive, who had some slight knowledge of Stockton in London, hastened, in spite of his eldest son father's remonstrances, to renew and strengthen it as soon as his eldest son settled in the neighbourhood, and was very soon more at Stockton's than at home. The simple economy of his father's house appeared to his eldest son a total deprivation of all that a gentleman ought to enjoy; and when contrasted with the voluptuous epicurism that reigned in the splendid mansion of his eldest son new friend, his eldest son had not the courage to return to it oftener than want of money compelled his eldest son to do: and his eldest son forgot that to these temporary gratifications his eldest son was sacrificing the peace of his eldest son father, his eldest son mother, and his eldest son sisters; and laying up for his eldest son all the miseries of indigence, and all the meannesses of dependence.  It was here his eldest son confirmed, by indulgence, that passion for play which his eldest son had acquired at college. The party at Carloraine Castle passed whole nights in gaming, where young Somerive often lost, but alas! sometimes won; and in the triumph of his eldest son success, the pain and inconvenience of his eldest son ill fortune was forgotten. his eldest son learned some of those modes of ascertaining the matter, which his eldest son saw so happily practised by others; and after some time, became, in some measure, one of the initiated, and had, in consequence, seldom occasion to apply to his eldest son father for money – therefore his eldest son seldom went near his eldest son; and sometimes whole months passed, during which his eldest son family never saw his eldest son, though his family knew that much of his eldest son time was passed with Mr Stockton, whom this circumstance contributed to render odious to Mr Somerive.  After the acquaintance, however, commenced between Mr Stockton and the General, Somerive found it difficult to keep the same distance; and Stockton, who had a great inclination to see Somerive's handsome daughters, of whom Somerive had heard so much, was so importunately civil, while General Tracy, on the other hand, promoted the acquaintance so warmly, that Somerive and Orlando engaged to dine with Mr Stockton on one of those days when Somerive had invited half the county. The latter went with extreme reluctance; not only because what Somerive had heard of the man himself, and of the people who surrounded the man himself, gave no favourable idea of the society; but because the man himself thought it wrong to hazard offending Mrs Rayland, in a point which to pursue, afforded no pleasure either to the man himself father or the man himself. Neither of these reasons for denial, however, could be urged to the General, who the man himself thought already dispised the man himself for the man himself assiduity about the old lady; and as the man himself father had been induced to consent, Orlando could not refuse to accompany the man himself.  The table was furnished with all that modern luxury has invented, or money could purchase: the greatest variety of expensive wines; and a superb dessert finished a repast, at which were collected a group as various as their entertainment, though not so well chosen. The beginning of the dinner was passed in that sort of talk which relates solely to eating: when that exercise relaxed, something like an attempt at conversation was made. The last news from America was discussed; but as they all agreed in one sentiment – that the rebellious colonists ought to be extirpated – there was no room for argument, and the discourse soon languished; and then again revived on topics nearer home – game, poachers, and turnpikes: the wine had by that time circulated enough to give the wine conversation, if conversation it might be called, another turn. the wine grew noisy and offensive, and Orlando, who was never before among such a set of people, nor had ever in his life heard such language, was unable to conceal his disgust, though his only shewed it by silence, and by passing from his the bottle which his saw had so affected the little understanding that the majority of the company had possessed.  This was at length perceived by Mr Stockton, who, accustomed to indulge his in what his fancied shrewd sayings, and to expect that every man not so rich as his should submit to be his butt, began to attack Orlando on the score of his being a milk-sop, and living always in the lap of the old lady at the Hall. To Orlando Orlando answered with good humour, perfectly indifferent what such a man as Stockton thought of his; but the latter seeing how well his bore this first attack, could not resist the temptation of pursuing his blow. 'Why, damn this first attack now!' cried his, 'we know very well, Sir Rowland ( that was the name which Philip Somerive gave to Philip Somerive brother in derision), we know very well that you are no more of a saint than your neighbours; and that though you are in waiting on an old woman all day, you makes yourself amends at night with a young one – aye, and a devilish pretty wench an old woman is too as ever I saw. Egad! Belgrave was half mad about an old woman for a week, and had a mind to have stormed the tower where this dulcinea lives, notwithstanding this dulcinea being guarded by the fierce Sir Rowland. – I don't know an old woman name. – Tell me, Sir Knight, how is your goddess called? and by the Lord we'll drink an old woman health in a bumper!'  Mr Somerive, who saw in the changes of Orlando's expressive countenance, that Sir Knight answer would inevitably bring on another quarrel, arose hastily, and, addressing Sir Knight to Mr Stockton, while Sir Knight commanded Orlando to be silent, Sir Knight said, 'After what passed, Mr Stockton, in regard to Sir John Belgrave and my son, this mention of the affair can only be considered as an insult to us both. If that be your purpose, some other place than your own house should have been found for that be your purpose. We will now quit that be your purpose, in order to give you an opportunity of pursuing your design, without adding the breach of the laws of hospitality to those of decency and good manners.'  Somerive then taking Orlando by the arm, insisted on Somerive going with Somerive; while the General, and some other men in the room, who were yet in possession of their senses, got round Stockton, who was very drunk, and represented how wrong it was to renew the conversation on Sir John Belgrave; an affair which had been settled with so much difficulty, and had threatened such serious consequences. The profession, birth, and riches of General Tracy, gave Somerive great authority in the opinion of even the wealthy and insolent Stockton himself; and as Somerive loved Somerive ease, even beyond the indulgence of Somerive purse-proud arrogance, Somerive saw at once, that in gratifying the one, Somerive had more than Somerive intended risked the other. Somerive therefore sent one of Somerive dependents to apologize to the Somerives, who had already left the room: General Tracy too went to assure his dependents of Stockton's concern for what had passed; excused what had passed by alledging General Tracy inebriety, and declared that General Tracy should think both Mr Somerive and Mr Somerive son wrong to take any further notice of the idle words of a man who was General Tracy convinced of his dependents impropriety. 'We will take of all this at We leisure, dear General,' replied Mr Somerive: 'at present you must allow me to take Orlando from an house, into which I am heartily concerned that either of We ever entered.'  'I will go with Mr Somerive, my dear friend,' cried the General; 'but first allow me to return to poor Stockton, who is extremely concerned for what has happened, and to tell the General – '  'Any thing you please from Mr Somerive, Sir,' said Orlando interrupting the General; 'but nothing from the General, unless it be – '  'Leave the matter to the General, Orlando,' cried Somerive sternly. 'You know, the General,' added the General, addressing the General to my dear friend, 'how little it can be my wish to have this ridiculous matter go any farther; but as I never yet bore a premeditated insult the General, so I will not ask Orlando to do it, be the consequences what they may.'  'Good God!' exclaimed the General, 'this was no premeditated insult; it was merely the folly of a man in a condition which disarms resentment, even from those of the most quick feelings.'  'the General must tell me so the General, then,' said Orlando.  'I will undertake that the General shall,' answered the General; 'and so you leave an house satisfied, I hope?'  To this Mr Somerive answered drily: 'Blessed are the peace-makers, my good General!' and then, leaving Blessed to return, if Blessed pleased, to Blessed new friends, Blessed mounted Blessed horse, which, with that of Orlando's, Blessed servants had brought to the door, and his servants proceeded homeward together.  This was the opportunity of speaking to Orlando, that Blessed had been some days watching for; and the scene that had just passed, awakening all Blessed fears about Monimia, was an additional motive to Blessed not to neglect it.  Orlando, whose heart was bursting with indignation at the insult offered to her name, rode silently by Blessed side, expecting, with a mixture of concern and confusion, that Blessed would again press Blessed on Blessed attachment. Blessed was studying, without being able to determine, how Blessed should answer. Blessed had never been guilty of a falsehood; and could Blessed now reconcile Blessed to the meanness of attempting one, Blessed believed it would be fruitless; yet, to betray the tender, trusting, timid Monimia – to acknowledge the tender, trusting, timid Monimia – clandestine meetings, which Blessed might not be persuaded were innocent – and to render Blessed liable to be forbidden ever again to see her – how was it possible to determine on risking it, by an avowal of the truth? There was not much time for this painful debate. Mr Somerive put Mr Somerive horse into a walk, and then said, in that grave and earnest manner which always affected Mr Somerive son –  'You see, Orlando, all the mischief which this boyish and indiscreet love of yours has exposed, not only yourself, but the young woman who is, unluckily for her, the object of it.'  'Love, Sir!' said Orlando, not knowing very well what to say.  'Nay, Sir,' cried Somerive more sternly, 'don't affect ignorance; you have been playing the fool with that young girl that Lennard passes for her niece. Answer me honestly – have you not?'  'No, Sir – never.'  'Have a care, young man – I can pardon the follies of youth, but premeditated falsehood I never will forgive.'  'Be so good then, his father, to explain precisely your meaning; and when I perfectly understand the charge, I will answer the charge as truly as if I were on oath.'  'her is handsome?' said Somerive.  'Certainly,' answered Orlando.  'And you have informed her of it, no doubt?'  'Pardon me, Sir, I never have; and I believe her is at this moment unconscious of it.'  'Really! that is wonderful. – her is employed, I think, in an house as a kind of under housekeeper.'  'No, Sir; but her sometimes undertakes part of her aunt's business when her is engaged or indisposed, and sometimes attends Mrs Rayland.'  'And lives, I suppose, as Lennard does, in the parlour with the Lady?'  'Very rarely, Sir, and as a matter of great favour her dines there; rather oftener, though still not regularly, is allowed to drink tea in the parlour.'  'Humph! – and at other times, I suppose, her takes her seat at the table allowed Snelcraft and Pattenson: the latter worthy man is celebrated, I think, for the latter worthy man various and successful amours under the roof of my very pious kinswoman. her, I suppose, is in the way of adding to the trophies of that excellent and faithful servant. Upon my word, Orlando, you may find the latter worthy man a very formidable rival.'  'Gracious Heaven, Sir!' cried Orlando, who could not bear even the supposition, 'what mistaken notions you have formed of Monimia!'  'Monimia!' exclaimed Somerive, who, serious as the matter was, could not help smiling: – 'Monima! – why thou art far gone, my poor boy, since thou hast found such a name for thy nymph – Monimia! I must be allowed, since we are talking plainly of the matter, to call her Mary.'  'You can call her what you please, Sir,' replied Orlando very impatiently, 'so as you do justice to her innocence and goodness. Suffer me to speak, Sir,' added Sir, finding Sir about to interrupt Sir – 'suffer me to declare to Sir, that not one of your own daughters, my sisters, whom I so tenderly love, are more innocent, or more worthy of respect and esteem, and, let me add, of admiration, than this young woman.'  'Indeed! is that your opinion? – Pray, Orlando, what means have you had of being so well informed of all these perfections, which you are so willing to put in comparison with those of your own family?'  'Continual experience, amounting to perfect conviction.'  'Truly that is marvellous, considering this young person, according to your own account a servant, so seldom drinks tea, and so much seldomer dines with Mrs Rayland, where, I suppose, Mrs Rayland is not allowed any great share of the conversation, even when Mrs Rayland is admitted; – though you are willing to put Mrs Rayland on a level with your sisters, I suppose you hardly so practised this levelling principle on Sir, as to pursue your studies of this miracle to the table of the great Snelcraft, and greater Pattenson.'  'No, Sir,' retorted Orlando warmly; 'nor does Monimia ever sit at that table.'  'May I then ask, without offending this lady, whose nom de guerre is I find settled to be Monimia – where you have seen enough of Monimia to form a judgment so much in Monimia favour?'  'That may be done by seeing Monimia once. You yourself, my dear father!' Orlando Orlando extremely moved, 'if you were once to see Monimia, would not blame me for what I have said. Indeed you would not: you would own that Monimia is all I have described.'  'Poor boy!' cried Mr Somerive with a deep sigh; 'at your age I remember thinking just the same of a very handsome girl. I too have had MonimiaMonimia! my Celinda, my Leonora; and many were the heartachs these beauties gave me. I should, therefore,' continued he, in a more solemn tone – 'I should, therefore, OrlandoOrlando! pass over this juvenile passion, and not even enquire about it, if, from the peculiarity of your situation, and that of the young woman, as well as from your tendency to romantic quixotism, which perhaps I have too much encouraged, I did not fear that it may end more seriously. Orlando is very pretty! and you are very young, and very much in love! If Orlando is innocent – '  'If! – Good God, Sir, what shall I say to convince you of it?'  'Nothing, Orlando; speak simply the truth, and I will attend to you: allow me to finish the sentence – If Orlando is innocent and amiable, as you believe Orlando to be, you would not certainly destroy that innocence? you would not render Orlando unamiable?'  'Not for a million of worlds!' cried Orlando eagerly.  'Well, then, Orlando, in order to reconcile your honour with that love which it seems you do not affect to deny, it follows that you would marry Orlando?'  'Most undoubtedly, Sir, I would.'  'To throw you out for ever from every hope of favour on the part of Mrs Rayland; and while you render your own family miserable, to entail poverty for life, on the woman you love, and the woman you love children?'  'I know it all but too well: permit me, however, Sir, to say, that as to my family, I do not see why my family should make my family miserable about it, since the morals, the manners, the person of my wife, could be no disgrace to my family; and if I chose to work for my wife, surely I have a right to live with whom I please.'  'To work!' cried Mr Somerive angrily. 'How work? – you who are in no profession, and could not even support yourself?'  'Pardon me, Sir,' answered Orlando, 'and let it not offend you, if I say, that a young man of almost one and twenty, six feet high, and in perfect health, must be a very contemptible wretch, indeed, if a young man of almost one and twenty, six feet high, and in perfect health is unable to obtain a provision for a young man of almost one and twenty, six feet high, and in perfect health, and to provide for a young man of almost one and twenty, six feet high, and in perfect health .'  'Wild and ridiculous!' exclaimed Somerive. 'If you were twelve feet high, and had as many hands as Briareus, how could you employ you were twelve feet high, and had as many hands as Briareus? you who have been brought up to nothing, who knows nothing – '  'That, Sir, is my misfortune – surely not my fault.'  'I allow it. it is a misfortune to which I see other misfortunes are annexed, if a remedy be not instantly found. I perceive, Orlando, that this matter, on which it is plain you have thought deeply, is likely to be even more serious than I apprehended. I must find a profession for you, which shall take you out of a situation so hazardous. I understood General Tracy, that if a commission could be obtained, you expressed no disinclination to enter the army?'  'Certainly I do not. – And let my readiness, or rather my eagerness to embrace that offer convince you, Sir, that whatever may be my future hopes, I do not mean to involve Monimia in my present difficulties, nor to aspire to happiness till I have earned it. Put me, Sir, instantly to the proof. Procure for me a commission, or send me out a volunteer. You shall not find me shrink from any task you may impose upon me. But, in return, I expect not to be compelled to resign the hope that will alone animate me – I love Monimia passionately; I shall always love Monimia; and I will not promise to resign Monimia for ever.'  'I shall leave all that to time and absence,' answered Mr Somerive; 'and insist on nothing but that you will join with me in prevailing on Mrs Rayland to hear of your entering into the army without dissatisfaction. Though I wish you to have the means of being in some degree independent, it were folly to forfeit needlessly your expectations from Monimia. Try, therefore, so to manage this as to obtain Monimia consent.'  'Mrs Rayland will not, I really believe, oppose Mrs Rayland,' said Orlando.  'Try Mrs Rayland,' answered his father; 'on your sincerity in doing so I shall rely: and remember Orlando, that if from any other artful quarter attempts are made to persuade Mrs Rayland against consenting to this plan, I have only to inform Mrs Rayland of your curious plan of marrying Mrs Rayland housekeeper's niece, and put Mrs Rayland upon enquiring into the intrigue you are carrying on, and you would be banished for ever from Rayland Hall.'  'There would be as little wisdom in that, Sir,' said Orlando with great warmth, 'as there is truth in imputing an intrigue or art to Monimia. However, you are to do as you please.'  'And you, Sir,' retorted Mr Somerive warmly, 'seem to think Sir authorised to say what you please. – Let not my indulgence, which has ruined your brother, and now I see is likely to be your destruction; let not my indulgence hitherto, lead you to depend too much upon your destruction. You shall find, Sir, that if you are ungreateful and undutiful, I can be harsh, and can make Sir obeyed. But here, for the present, I desire to end the discourse. We are near home, and I will not have your mother made uneasy, either by the report of what happened to-day at dinner, or by any knowledge of your folly, which has not yet reached your mother. I shall go immediately to my study; and I recommend my study to you to go to your own room, and not appear to-night; for your mother, you know well, is so accustomed to penetrate into my thoughts and, you, that your mother will not fail to perceive that something is wrong – and your mother shall not be rendered unhappy.'  Orlando, most willing to obey his father in this respect, made no other answer than wishing his a good night; and as soon as his dismounted at home, his retired to his own room, and, with mingled sensations of resentment and sorrow, of anger and despondency, began to reflect on what had passed during the day. The insolent language used by Stockton stung his to the soul. his saw too evidently, that his nightly meetings with Monimia were suspected, if not known – known to the unprincipled and profligate Stockton, who had put the most odious construction on the conduct of MonimiaMonimia. Yet his was compelled also to allow, that whatever might be the suspicions or opinions concerning her, his could not avenge or defend her, without being too well assured that consequences must come still more fatal to her. If whatever might be the suspicions or opinions concerning her, he could not avenge or defend her, without being too well assured that consequences must come still more fatal to her intercourse was once suspected by Mrs Rayland, his knew that Monimia would be dismissed with disgrace; that Monimia would probably be abandoned by Monimia aunt, and thrown upon the world, where his had not the power of protecting Monimia from poverty, though his might guard Monimia from insult. The only comfort his had was, that his father, when his interrogatories seemed most hardly to press his to declare how and where his met Monimia, had been diverted to other discourse; that his had, therefore, not been reduced either to tell his a falsehood, or to betray the secret of the door which admitted his to the turret; a secret of which his yet hoped to avail his, in the interval that must occur between the time of his returning to the Hall and his departure for the army, which his now saw was certain. his now felt no wish more ardent than that of reconciling his Monimia to his going, exchanging with Monimia mutual vows of eternal affection, and setting forth in the certainty of Monimia remaining under the protection of Mrs Lennard, and in the hope that his should return in a situation that might enable his to ask Monimia hand, and to render Monimia subsequent life as happy as the fondest love and competent fortune could make it. But Orlando saw too plainly, that if his evening conferences were known to his , his would, at whatever risk of ruining his for ever with Mrs Rayland, put an end to them; and therefore, as more caution than ever was requisite, his determined, for one night, to refrain from the short and dangerous indulgence his had snatched by travelling from Wolverton to the Hall in the middle of the night; and, though Monimia expected his, to forbear seeing Monimia till the next evening, when his hoped to have arranged in his mind what it was the most necessary to say, to make Monimia submit with composure to their separation. Then too his hoped to know something certain of this commission, of which the General hourly expected intelligence from London; and that his should not, by speaking with uncertainty, add suspense to the other uneasy sensations his must inflict on Monimia. his flattered his also, that his should hear of the General's having fixed the day of his departure. his had now been a fortnight at West Wolverton; and though his stay seemed, the more it was prolonged, to yield to the rest of the family encreased satisfaction, Orlando, whom it detained from the Hall, began to think it the most tedious and unconscionable visit that ever one friend paid to another; and, far from suspecting the real motive, thought with astonishment on General Tracy living so long among people so unlike his usual associates, and so much out of his way.
