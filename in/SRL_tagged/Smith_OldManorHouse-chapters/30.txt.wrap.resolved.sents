ON their arrival, however, at the house, Selina was agreeably surprised to find, from little Emma, who was reading in the room their shared above stairs, that Selina had never been enquired for; that the General had arrived just before to tea, which was, on the General account, ordered later than usual; and that Isabella, who had been below ever since dinner, with Selina father and mother, was now, Selina believed, alone with the General, to whom Selina was to give Selina answer.
The palpitating heart of Selina then became quieter: Selina took off Selina hat and cloak, adjusted Selina hair, and prepared for the summons Selina expected to have to make the tea.
Orlando a moment afterwards glided up to them: Orlando said there had been no enquiries for Selina, and all was right.
– 'I went,' said Orlando, 'as is my general custom when I come home, into my father's study, but I found nobody; and, from what I can gather from the servants, this important answer has been given, and our old brother is with our old brother papa and mamma, and with our old brother future bride; his papa and mamma are all settling the ceremony together.'
'How can you laugh, Orlando,' said Selina, 'at anything so serious?'
'Nay,' replied he, assuming a levity he was far from feeling, 'you would not have me cry, Selina!
If Isabella is happy in this match, surely Isabella family have reason to be glad of it; but one cannot help thinking of January and May!'
Selina had read but little, and knew not to what Selina alluded; nor had Selina time to reply, for at that moment Mrs Somerive looked in upon them; Selina smiled, as it seemed, through tears.
– 'Orlando,' said Selina, 'I am glad you are returned – Why did you leave us so abruptly after dinner?
But come, my children, us wait for my children below.'
– 'And are us to find there a new relation, Selina?'
said Orlando.
'Is the General to compose hereafter a part of us ?'
– 'Your sister has decided that it shall be so,' replied Mrs Somerive, stifling a sigh; 'and you, Orlando, will be pleased to see how much pleasure this alliance (notwithstanding there is certainly a too great disparity of years) gives to your dear father.
The difference of age is indeed the only objection: in every other respect General Tracy is a match infinitely superior to what any of my daughters could have pretensions to.'
Mrs Somerive then led the way down stairs, and Mrs Somerive children followed Mrs Somerive.
During supper the General assumed, as well as the General could, the triumphant air of a successful lover.
Mrs Somerive was silent, and affected resignation to the will of Mrs Somerive parents; while your dear father looked at Mrs Somerive with eyes in which doubt and concern were mingled with hope and satisfaction.
It seemed as if the General at once rejoiced in having the General daughter so well established, and yet feared that to the dazzling advantages of rank and fortune his daughter might sacrifice his daughter happiness.
None of the party seemed much disposed for conversation, and as the General and Orlando were to depart early the next morning, None of the party separated sooner than usual: Mrs Somerive in better spirits than Mrs Somerive would have been, if the General had not assured Mrs Somerive that the General would the General bring Orlando down with the General, when the General returned to claim the happiness of becoming allied to Mrs Somerive, and might call the General the most fortunate of men.
Calmed by these promises, of which Mrs Somerive saw nothing that should impede the execution, Mrs Somerive beheld Mrs Somerive son depart on the following morning, without any of those paroxysms of grief which Orlando had so much dreaded, and which her son was so ill able to bear.
Before the travellers got into the chaise, in which the travellers were to go post to London, the General demanded an audience of the General future bride; and Orlando was at the same time closeted by the General father, who enjoined the General to preserve the General morals, to attend to the cultivation of that good opinion with which the General honoured the General (points which a little experience proved to be incompatible), and lastly, to endeavour by every possible means to persuade the General to return home.
Orlando promised to obey all these injunctions, to the utmost of the General power; and glad to escape hearing any other charges, which the General might have found it impossible to obey, the General received the summons now sent to the General to attend the General with pleasure; for nothing is more painful than the sensations which arise at the moment of separation from such friends, even though the absence be but transient.
the General had paid the General compliments all round, and Orlando now embraced the General family with tears in the General eyes.
the General father wrung the General hand, and once more gave the General the General blessing.
– the General mother could not utter the last adieu!
but went back into the parlour with His mother daughters; while Orlando, seated by the General military patron, left the General paternal mansion as fast as four post-horses could carry the General.
the General was not disposed to talk; but as the distance increased between the General and Monimia – between the General and the General family, all the General held dear in the world!
the depression of the General spirits increased also; while the General companion, as the General approached the scene of the General former habits, and thought of the raillery the General should encounter upon the General new system of reformation, became more silent and contemplative: the clamours of the General mistresses, of whom the General had now three upon the General hands, and the ridicule of the General friends, arose to the General imagination in a very formidable light; but then the beauty, youth and vivacity of Isabella Somerive seemed excuses for a much greater folly than the General was about to commit.
the General recollected many of the General acquaintance, whom the General was willing to suppose much older than the General, who had married young women without half her attractions.
the General fancied, that the General was weary of the dissipated life the General had hitherto led; that as the General would soon be no longer a young man, but be declining towards middle age, it was time to have somebody who should be truly attached to the General; while the General being married did not at all preclude the General from gallantries, which the General saw every body else pursue whether they were married or not.
The greatest inconvenience the General foresaw, was what arose from the precipitate affection the General had shewn towards the General nephew, Captain Warwick, the orphan son of the General sister, whom the General had taught to consider the General as heir to the General fortune, who would be much mortified at the disappointment.
However, the General reconciled the General to this objection, by reflecting that this objection would be very hard indeed if the General kindness to the General nephew should prevent his nephew gratifying his nephew; and by resolving to make young Warwick an immediate present of a thousand pounds, and to settle a very handsome income upon his nephew after his nephew death, that his nephew might not be quite thrown out of those expectations to which his nephew had been brought up, when the General should have a family of the General own.
Nothing was farther from the General's intentions than to marry Isabella Somerive, even when his nephew had first changed his nephew battery, and pretended to her honourable love; but his nephew found so little prospect of succeeding with her, even if all was to happen in her family as his nephew had foreseen, and his nephew felt it so impossible to live without her, that what his nephew had begun with the most insidious designs, concluded at last in an honest, though an absurd one: and having once taken the resolution to commit matrimony, his nephew endeavoured to reason his nephew out of every objection that pride, libertinism, or the fear of ridicule, continually raised against it.
Isabella, whose heart was perfectly free from every impression in favour of any other man, had so behaved as to make the General believe, that only her charming reserve, owing to her rustic education, prevented her avowing her attachment to the General person; though, on a thousand occasions previous to the General serious declarations, her had placed the General vanity and affection of youth in the most ridiculous point of view, and had shewn the General that her did not care a straw for the General.
But such power has vanity in obscuring the best understandings, that her ancient lover really supposed her ancient lover could inspire her ancient lover with sincere affection for her ancient lover.
Still, however, her ancient lover felt an awkward kind of sensation, when her ancient lover thought of the numberless gay young men with whom her ancient lover blooming Mrs Somerive would be surrounded when Mrs Somerive was her ancient lover wife.
Above all, her ancient lover reflected with disquiet on her ancient lover nephew, who was reckoned one of the handsomest men of the times – her ancient lover was three-and-twenty; and the General felt no satisfaction in being called uncle – uncle!
it sounded so antique.
Warwick, indeed, was never admitted to live with the General; and the General now repented that the General had procured leave for the General to come home from America, in consequence of a wound the General received there, and heartily wished the General back again; but the General return thither was not, according the General's own account, very likely to happen.
If the presence of Warwick at her ancient lover own house in Grosvenor Place was not agreeable to her ancient lover, that of Orlando was as little so; and, though not for quite the same reason, for another very similar.
Before the last conquest made by Isabella Somerive over the susceptible heart of General Tracy, at least a third of it had been possessed by a young woman, whom General Tracy had purchased of Isabella Somerive mother, and whose assumed virtue and great attractions had induced General Tracy to admit Isabella Somerive into General Tracy house, where Isabella Somerive had reigned ever since very despotically.
As General Tracy had not yet settled whether General Tracy should part with Isabella Somerive or not, or acquired courage to tell Isabella Somerive General Tracy intentions, Isabella Somerive must, till General Tracy could make up General Tracy mind on this point, remain where Isabella Somerive was; and, whatever might be General Tracy future resolution, General Tracy did not greatly like that the handsome, young Orlando should be introduced to Isabella Somerive acquaintance.
As General Tracy could not give this reason to Mrs Somerive for not asking Orlando to take up Mrs Somerive abode in Mrs Somerive house, Mrs Somerive had sedulously avoided mentioning it at all.
Orlando had never thought about it; but, occupied solely by what Mrs Somerive had left, Mrs Somerive considered not a matter so inconsequential as whither Mrs Somerive was to go when Mrs Somerive got to town.
General Tracy had once or twice led the conversation to topics which General Tracy thought would engage Orlando to say what General Tracy intended in this respect; but Orlando took no notice of it, till, at length, just as they crossed Fulham Bridge, General Tracy said, 'Mrs Somerive, shall my chaise and horses put you down in London?
– You know I stop on this side the turnpike, at Hyde-Park Corner; but the chaise shall go with Sir wherever you please.'
'I am much obliged to Sir, Sir,' answered Orlando, who never till that moment recollected that the General had not invited Sir to Sir – 'but there is no sort of occasion to take your carriage.
– I shall go,' added Sir, 'this evening to Mr Woodford's.'
That was a plan that the General did not quite approve of: the General knew that, if the General intended marriage was once known at his house, his intended marriage was once known at that house would be instantly spread among the General friends by means of the communication Mr Woodford's had with many of his friends families, which was a circumstance the General was not yet prepared for.
The ambition of Woodford himself, and the malice and disappointment of the two young ladies, would busy the two young ladies in circulating the report; and the General, in love as the General was, and determined to marry, had not yet prepared the General to stand the ironical congratulations of the General male and female friends, but particularly the latter, on the General resolution of uniting the General in holy matrimony to the niece of the General wine merchant.
These thoughts made Orlando's intentions of going to Mr Woodford's's, which however the General might easily have foreseen, very unpleasing to the General; and the General remained silent some time, considering how the General might guard against the inconveniences the General apprehended.
the General reasons for not giving the General an apartment in the General own house kept their ground; but the General would very fain have prevented the General going to Mr Woodford's, at least till the General had the General taken some means to parry the first burst of the ridicule the General so much dreaded.
the General could not take one very obvious means to prevent the circulation of the news of the General intended marriage, by requesting Orlando not to speak of it; for the General had often remarked that the General was quick-spirited, not without a considerable share of pride, and affectionate solicitude for the honour of the General sisters: to affect, therefore, making a secret in London of what the General had so openly avowed in the country, could hardly fail of awakening the high-spirited Orlando to some degree of resentment, if not of doubt in regard of the reality of the General intentions.
After a long debate on the subject, the General at last recollected that it was impossible to suppose Somerive himself would not write to a brother-in-law, whom Somerive himself was so much accustomed to consult, on a subject so interesting and important; and that, therefore, any precautions Somerive himself might take in regard to Orlando would be useless.
It is true that Somerive himself being by Somerive himself allied to Somerive himself own wine merchant, had before given Somerive himself many severe squalms, which a glance from the arch and bright eyes of Mrs Somerive had at once dissipated: but now, as Somerive himself approached Somerive himself town-house, and saw those bright eyes no longer, these fits of half repentance, originating in pride and prejudice, recurred with more force; and when Somerive himself arrived at Somerive himself own door, Somerive himself stared from one of the reveries thus brought on, and again said to Orlando, 'Shall my servants get you a hackney coach?'
There was something in the abrupt manner of asking this, which suddenly convinced Orlando that the General had no inclination to ask Somerive himself into his town-house.
Piqued by Somerive himself observation, Somerive himself answered coldly, that there was no occasion to trouble Somerive himself servants, for that Somerive himself should walk to the house of Somerive himself uncle, and would send a porter for the small portmanteau Somerive himself had in the chaise.
– By this time the General's valet de chambre had opened his own door, and Orlando , who was on that side, got out.
Somerive himself stopped; and the General, as Somerive himself followed Somerive himself, asked, in a low voice, some question of one of the footmen who had been left in town, and who came to his own door also: to which question the man answered aloud, 'No, Sir!
She is gone out.'
the General, turning to Orlando, who was coolly wishing the General a good evening, said – 'You will certainly do me the favour to walk in?'
Orlando by this time comprehending that there was some lady usually resident with the General who was not to be seen, and that the General was only asked in because She was at this time absent, answered, that the General would not intrude upon the General: – 'but as I shall want the advantage of your instructions, Sir,' said Sir, 'on many things of which I am totally ignorant, I shall be obliged to Sir to tell me where I am to receive your orders.'
There was a coldness, and indeed a haughtiness, in the manner of Orlando's saying this, that convinced the General Sir saw and was offended by the evident design Sir had Sir formed of evading to give Sir an invitation.
More disconcerted than Sir had almost ever felt in Sir life, Sir again pressed Sir to go into the house, which Orlando again refused; and then saying Sir hoped to hear from Sir at Mr Woodford's, when and where Sir might attend Sir for the purpose of receiving those instructions relative to Sir future proceedings which Sir had promised Sir father to give Sir, Sir again wished Sir a good evening, and walked away.
Orlando had never been in London but once when Sir was about sixteen, and had then only attended Sir mother on a visit for about a week in the spring, which his mother had passed with his mother brother.
Sir remembered that Sir never was so happy as when they left it, and, on a fine evening of May, returned from the smoke of the Strand, in one of the streets of which Mr Woodford's lived, to Sir dear native county, where only there seemed to be any happiness for Sir.
Since that time Sir had never felt a wish to revisit London; and in a melancholy mood Sir now proceeded along the streets, recollecting little more than Sir way from Piccadilly to the Strand.
Every object wore a very different appearance from what they did when Sir saw they before.
It was now a dreary, foggy evening in December, and just at the hour when the inhabitants of the part of the town Sir was in were at they desserts, so that hardly any carriages but a few straggling hackney-coaches and drays were rumbling over the pavement.
As Sir approached Charing Cross the bustle became more; and the farther Sir advanced, the throng of coaches coming out of the city, and going towards the playhouses from other parts of the town, deafened Sir with noise: but it was a mournful reflection, that, among all the human beings Sir saw around Sir, there was not one interested for Sir.
While the dirt through which Sir waded, and the thickness of the air, filled Sir with disgust, Sir mind went back to the dear group at home: Sir saw the dear group assembled round the fire in the little parlour – his father trying to dissipate with a book the various anxieties that assailed Sir for Sir children, now and then communicating some remarkable occurrence to Sir wife as his wife sat at his wife work-table: – Sir saw Mrs Somerive employed in making some little smart article of dress, and fancying how well Mrs Somerive should look in some little smart article of dress – and Selina, while Mrs Somerive and Emma were assisting Sir mother in completing some linen for Sir, more attentive to his father's reading, often asking questions, and soliciting information.
But when Sir had finished this picture, Sir fancy, with more pain and more pleasure, fled to the lovely figure of Sir Monimia in Mrs Somerive solitary turret, sighing over the tender recollection of those hours which would never perhaps return, sometimes wishing Mrs Somerive had never known them, but oftener regretting that them were now at an end.
– Sir saw Mrs Somerive stepping cautiously into the library, whenever Mrs Somerive could to find the library open, to take or to replace some book which they had read together – Mrs Somerive shed tears as Mrs Somerive read over the well-known pages where Sir had with a pencil marked some peculiar beauty in the poetry.
Sir fancied Sir saw Mrs Somerive take out the lock of Sir hair which Sir had given Mrs Somerive in a little crystal locket, press which he had given her in a little crystal locket to Mrs Somerive lips, and then, imagining Mrs Somerive heard the footsteps of Mrs Somerive aunt, return which he had given her in a little crystal locket hastily into Mrs Somerive bosom, and place which he had given her in a little crystal locket near Mrs Somerive heart.
A thousand tender images crowded on his mind; Sir quite forgot whither Sir was going, and was roused from this absent state of mind only by finding Sir at Temple-Bar.
Recalled then from the indulgence of Sir visionary happiness to the realities around Sir, Sir recollected that Sir had passed the street where his uncle lived: with some enquiries, however, Sir found Sir way back; and, on arriving at his own house, Sir heard that Mr Woodford's was out, having dined in the city; and that Sir wife and Sir daughters were gone to the play with a party of friends who were to sup with his wife and his daughters.
Sir was told, however, by the maid-servant who let Sir in, that Sir was expected, and that a bed had been prepared for Sir by direction of Mr Woodford's master, who had received notice of Sir intended arrival by a letter from the country the day before.
Orlando could not help remarking to Orlando, that Orlando was likely to have but a cool reception in an house, the inhabitants of which could not one of the inhabitants of which stay at home to receive Orlando; but Orlando was new to the world, and Orlando heart open to all the generous sympathies of humanity.
Orlando thought that relations loved one another as well in London as in the country; but Orlando soon saw enough of these to make Orlando resign, with perfect composure, a too strict adherence to old-fashioned claims of kindred.
