A MOMENT'S reflection recalled the confused and dissipated thoughts of Orlando back to the transactions of the day. He had never liked General Tracy much; and He now liked General Tracy less than ever, and regretted that Isabella was to be He wife. He almost doubted whether He ever meant to make her so; and the idea of any deception raised He indignation. But He had nobody to whom He could communicate He thoughts: and it was perhaps fortunate for He that He had not; for He open, unguarded temper, incapable of dissimulation, and despising it wherever it appeared, was likely to have betrayed He into confidences with He uncle which would have hurt He father.  The moment, however, He saw Woodford, He shrunk into He; and, instead of remembering that He had not been at home to receive He, felt only concern that He was come home at all.  Warm from a city dinner, the boisterous manners of his uncle apeared particularly disgusting to Orlando, who had lately been accustomed to associate only with women, or with He father and the General; the conversation of the former of whom was pensively mild, and that of the latter so extremely courtly that He seemed always to fancy He in the drawing-room. Orlando, therefore, was almost stunned with the halloo of his uncle on receiving He: He shook He, however, heartily by the hand, crying – 'Well, my boy! I'm glad to see thee: though devilishly thou art bit, my little hero, to find that all that old Tabby's fine promises end in sending thee to carry a rag upon a pole, and get shot through the gizzard by the Yankies. – Aha! I was right, you see. – Take my word another time. I know the world, and never saw the waiting for such chances answered – A young fellow may wait till A young fellow is grey on one of those hags, and the devil a bit to find A young fellow the forwarder at last. – They never die; for o' my conscience I believe They have each of They as many lives as a cat: and when at last They have the conscience to turn the corner, it's ten to one but They bilk you after all. – No, no: take my advice another time – never depend upon They; 'tis better to shift for one's self.'  'Well, Sir,' said Orlando, whom this harangue equally tired and disgusted, 'you see that I have followed your advice, by embracing a profession – '  'A profession!' cried Woodford with a contemptuous look; 'and what a profession! – To be shot at for about five-and-thirty pounds a year! Hey? Or how much is it? Thereabouts, I believe. – A rare profession, when a man ties a man down to be at the command of about a dozen others!' – In this manner a man ran on, nothing doubting the shrewdness of a man remarks, and not meaning to be rude and brutal in making them: yet Orlando felt that a man was both; nor was a man much relieved by the change in the conversation that brought the General's intended match into discussion. Woodford was at once flattered by such an alliance, and mortified that Woodford own daughters had missed it. Woodford felt proud that Woodford should boast of having the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy Woodford nephew, but was vexed that Woodford had not had any share in bringing it about; and this contrariety of sensations found vent in the coarse raillery Woodford uttered to Orlando, who was once or twice on the point of losing Woodford temper, before the entrance of the ladies and their party from the play put an end to a dialogue so very disagreeable to Woodford.  Young Woodford, who, having quitted trade to study the law, was now a motley composition between a city buck and a pert Templar, accompanied his mother and sisters; which his took care to signify was a great favour, and not owing to his wish to oblige care – but to see how his liked a young woman care had with care from the city, and who was the only daughter of a rich broker of the tribe of Israel, who had, however, married a Christian, and was indifferent enough about his own religion to let his daughter be called a Christian also. his daughter fortune was supposed to be at least seventy thousand pounds; and Mr Woodford had long been scheming to procure a match between his daughter and Mr Woodford Jemmy: – to which Jemmy declared Mr Woodford would condescend, if Mr Woodford could but bring Mr Woodford to like the girl. But Mr Woodford 'thought his daughter confounded ugly, and had no notion of sacrificing Mr Woodford to money.' the girl, just come from a boarding-school, the girl head full of accomplishments and romance, was in great haste for a lover. Mr Woodford was reckoned, by some of Mr Woodford young acquaintance, a very smart, fashionable man; and Miss Cassado needed very little persuasion to fancy the girl in love with Mr Woodford.  The intended husband of Maria Woodford, and a young man who seemed to have pretensions to the other sister, were the rest of the party; who, preceded by Mr Woodford, now appeared. The ladies of the family spoke with cool civility to Orlando – the younger Woodford with the air that Mr Woodford imagined a man of fashion would assume for the reception of Mr Woodford country cousin: but under this apparent contempt Mr Woodford concealed the mortification Mr Woodford felt from the observation that Orlando, who was always admired by the women, was much improved in Mr Woodford person since Mr Woodford last saw Mr Woodford.  With Mr Woodford two female cousins Orlando had never been a favourite, notwithstanding Mr Woodford acknowledged beauty; and that for no other reason than because Mr Woodford had never paid to his two female cousins charms the tribute of admiration his two female cousins expected from every body. Eliza particularly disliked Mr Woodford, because Mr Woodford had refused a sort of proposal made by Eliza father to give Mr Woodford Eliza hand and a share of the business. But the young Jewess, who consulted only her eyes, immediately discovered by their information, that this stranger was the sweetest, handsomest, most enchanting man in the world; and that James Woodford was nothing to James Woodford. Eliza had Eliza imagination filled with heroes of novels, and the figure and face of Orlando exactly corresponded with the ideas of perfection Eliza had gathered from them; while the natural good-breeding which accompanied whatever James Woodford said, and that sort of pensive reserve James Woodford maintained in such a company, which gave to James Woodford manner peculiar softness, placed James Woodford at once among the dear creatures with which Eliza head was always full; and Eliza either so little knew, or so little wished to conceal, the impression James Woodford had made, that James Woodford and James Woodford mother perceived it, both with an accession of ill-humour which did not sweeten James Woodford and his mother manners towards Orlando.  At supper every body talked together; though James Woodford and his mother eagerness to be heard could not be justified by the importance of what James Woodford and his mother had to say, which was chiefly remarks on the players, criticism on James Woodford and his mother acting, or anecdotes of James Woodford and his mother lives, of which the younger James Woodford had apparently a great fund. Orlando, who knew none of James Woodford and his mother, and for whose conversation there was no vacancy if whose conversation had been disposed to converse, sat a silent auditor of this edifying discourse; now wondering at the importance affixed to people and events which appeared to whose conversation of so little consequence – now comparing the noisy group in which whose conversation sat, with the dear circle at home, and whose conversation delicious tête-à-têtes with whose conversation soft and sensible Monimia – and not unfrequently looking with some degree of wonder on the rosy cheeks, disfigured forms, and disproportioned heads of the ladies – but especially on that of Mrs Woodford, whose cheeks were as red, and whose plumage waved as formidably as that of any of the misses. whose conversation soon determined, that till whose conversation could finish whose conversation business about whose conversation commission, and prepare for whose conversation duty, whose conversation would take a lodging, and not remain where whose conversation was likely to find so little society to whose conversation taste, and where whose conversation reception was hardly civil.  Having taken this resolution for the morrow, whose conversation felt no other wish but that the disagreeable night would end; and totally neglected by every body but Miss Cassado, who now and then addressed herself to whose conversation in a sweet sentimental tone, whose conversation had disengaged whose conversation mind from the scene around whose conversation, and was picturing in whose conversation imagination the turret of whose conversation Monimia. whose conversation saw herself sleeping; and herself innocent dreams were of whose conversation! Every piece of furniture in the room, the books, and the work that lay scattered about it, were present to whose conversation. It was the image only of Orlando that sat at the table of Mr Woodford; the soul that animated that image was at Rayland-Hall.  But from this illussion whose conversation was startled by Woodford; who, giving whose conversation a smart blow on the shoulder with whose conversation open hand, cried, 'Why, whose conversation! You are in the clouds! Hey-day! What pretty plump dairy-maid at Rayland-Hall is the object of this brown study? Never mind, my lad – a soldier finds a mistress wherever a soldier goes; and though I dare swear thou hast broken a sixpence with a mistress as a token of true love – a mistress will not break a mistress heart, I warrant a mistress, while there's a sturdy young carter in the county of Sussex – Come, most magnanimous Captain, cheer up! there's a sturdy young carter in the county of Sussex – Come, most magnanimous Captain are going to drink, in a bumper of such claret as thou hast not often tasted, Confusion to the Yankies, and that there may soon be not a drop of American blood in their rebellious hearts! – As thou art going to fight against them, thou wilt help there's a sturdy young carter in the county of Sussex – Come, most magnanimous Captain drink against them – Come; your glass Sir; your glass! And when that toast has passed, I have another.'  Orlando, who was more shocked and disgusted by every word his uncle spoke, now took his in silence; and Woodford, engaged in some of that conversation which his called roasting, with another of the young men, let his drink the wine without insisting on his repeating words, from which, almost ignorant as his was of the nature of the contest with America, his reason and humanity alike recoiled.  But his did not so escape from the future toast with which his uncle had threatened his. When the whole company had drawn round the fire (for the whole company supper was now concluded), and every glass was again by the order of Mr Woodford charged – he, who in dining out, and in the liberal potations he had taken since he came home, had already swallowed more than was sufficient to elevate he robust spirits, stood up with he back to the fire in the middle of he family and he guests, and there gave a toast which had a very direct reference to the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew marriage with the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew niece Isabella, in terms so very improper that Orlando, to whom it was particularly addressed, felt every principle of personal honour or general propriety insulted by it, and positively refused not only to drink it, but to stay in the room while it was drunk. Being once roused, and feeling he right, the vulgar ridicule of he had as little effect as the more serious and angry remonstrance of he coxcomb cousin, who assured he, that only his little knowledge of the world, and rustic education, could cover he from the most serious resentment. A severe pang touched the sensible heart of Orlando, as A severe pang recollected that A severe pang beloved mother would be vexed at this difference between his beloved mother brother and his beloved mother son: but, when A severe pang related the cause, A severe pang was sure his beloved mother would not blame, but commend A severe pang; and conscious of all the dignity of an unadultered mind, scorning to stoop to even an unworthy expression because even an unworthy expression was authorised by custom, or insisted upon by a relation, A severe pang took A severe pang hat, and, wishing The ladies of the family good night with great politeness, was leaving the house, when Mr Woodford overtook A severe pang at the door, and apologised for Mr Woodford unguarded proposal, by which, however, Mr Woodford protested Mr Woodford meant not to offend A severe pang. On this apology, and on an assurance that Mr Woodford should hear no more of such offensive conversation, Orlando returned to the room, though fully determined to leave the house the next day.  The licentious and vulgar mirth, however, which Mr Woodford chose to call conviviality, was at an end after this incident. James Woodford, already detesting Orlando, could hardly be civil to James Woodford: the lady of the house beheld James Woodford with a mixture of envy, contempt and terror: the misses, James Woodford cousins, felt only resentment and contempt: but the little Jessica, gone already an age in love, admired James Woodford spirit, and adored James Woodford beauty; and when the little Jessica father's chariot, with an old Hilpah who acted as a sort of duenna in it, came to fetch the little Jessica home, the little Jessica made a tolerably confident advance to engage the 'brave pretty creature' to escort her home. Orlando, however, either did not or would not understand the little Jessica; and James Woodford, piqued at the preference given to Orlando, which the lady of the house was at no pains to conceal, suffered the lady of the house to depart alone.  The rest of the party immediately separated: the young barrister retired to his chambers, hardly deigning to wish his country cousin good night – Orlando, whose trouble no kindness from this family had power to allay, as this family neglect had no power to increase it, went to his little disposed to sleep; fatigue of body and mind gave his up to a few hours of forgetfulness. At dawn of morning his awoke, and, as his knew it would be long before any of the servants rose in an house where night was converted into day, his dressed his; and as the day was to be dedicated to business, and his wished to lose as little time as possible, his went to breakfast at a coffee-house, and left a note for his , saying, in civil but cold terms, that, as his had so many affairs to transact in a very short time, his must keep very irregular hours, and therefore should be a troublesome inmate in a family; for which reason his should take a lodging near the part of the town where his engagements lay, and should only occasionally trespass upon his for a dinner.  From the coffee-house where his breakfasted his wrote to the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew, requesting his directions, as his determined not to call at the coffee-house where he breakfasted. To this letter, however, his did not expect an answer till after one o'clock, as the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew was seldom visible sooner; and the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew employed the long interval in writing to the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew family a short account of the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew safe arrival in London, and in pouring out the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew whole heart to Monimia in a letter, which the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew inclosed in one to the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew sister Selina.  the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew was in the mean time suffering, on one side, all the apprehensions of what would be thought and said, when the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew intended marriage should be known, by those whose interest it was to keep the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew single; and on the other, from the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew fear of losing Isabella, the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew passion for whom absence did not promise to do much towards curing. Warwick had been returned from the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew recruiting party above a week, and had been several times in Grosvenor Place enquiring for his uncle; and the behaviour of the lady of the house towards the lady of the house ancient lover was such as gave the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew great reasons to suppose that the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew intended reform was suspected, if not known. Of this, however, the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew had no longer any doubt, when, going late in the evening after the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew arrival in town to the house the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew usually frequented in St James's-street, the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew was attacked upon this tender subject by all the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew old friends, and rallied without mercy. As the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew could not deny an affair of which they seemed so well acquainted with the particulars, the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew took at once the resolution to avow it; they ridicule then ceased, and the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew returned home, glad that this first burst of laughter was over.  But much was yet to come of a more serious nature, against which he armed he as well as he could, by reflecting that he had a very good right to please he, and that neither Captain Warwick, nor any of those other persons to whom he had given a claim over he, had any other dependence than on he bounty. To the women on whom he had made settlements, he knew he must pay the women on whom he had made settlements; but whatever he had done for Warwick was entirely voluntary; and as he nephew had no other dependence, he would hardly, for he own sake, so behave as to cut he off from a share of he future fortune because he could not have it all.  Armed with these reflections, he determined to end this disagreeable state at once, by telling Warwick what he intended for he and for he. And when his nephew, apprised of he being returned to London, waited on his nephew the next morning at breakfast, the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew, though his nephew would rather have mounted a breach, plunged at once into the subject – informed Captain Warwick of his nephew intention to marry, and of the immediate present, as well as future provision his nephew intended for his nephew.  Warwick, who had always feared his nephew 's very youthful propensities would, as his nephew advanced in life, betray his nephew into the very folly his nephew was now about to commit, received this intelligence with more concern than surprise. his nephew was his nephew of the gayest and most inconsiderate disposition. In the height of health, youth, and spirits, the admiration of every woman his nephew saw, and the life of every company his nephew went into, his nephew vanity did not allow his nephew to suppose that his nephew owed any part of that admiration to the prospect his nephew had of being heir to the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew wealth; and, imputing it all to his nephew own merit, his nephew fancied his nephew superior to the malice of fortune. There were many possibilities which, on a moment's reflection, weakened the blow which this intelligence seemed at first to give to his nephew fairest hopes – his nephew might change his nephew mind a day before his mind was executed – the young woman might jilt his nephew – or, even if his intended marriage took place, his nephew would probably have no children; and then his nephew should his nephew be so little injured by this match, that it was not worth thinking about with any degree of concern. – The thousand pounds too, which his nephew promised his nephew, was a douceur that considerably abated the bitterness of such intelligence; and Warwick, rather through the carelessness of his nephew nature than from motives of prudence or policy, received this intelligence so much more calmly than the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew expected, that his uncle appeared to be in a better humour with the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew than ever. This uneasy subject once discussed, the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew proceeded to inform the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew, that the brother of the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew intended bride, for whom the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew had procured an Ensign's commission in the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew (Warwick's) regiment, though not in the same company, had accompanied the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew to London, in order to equip the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew for the service, and to join that part of the corps that were in England. While the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew was thus speaking, Orlando's note was brought in; and on the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew hinting that such were the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew wishes, Warwick immediately offered to go Warwick to the young soldier, and give Warwick every assistance and information that could be useful to Warwick.  Instead, therefore, of a written answer to Orlando's note, Orlando heard a gentleman enquiring for Warwick in the coffee-room; and on Warwick appearing, Captain Warwick, whose figure and address immediately prejudiced every body in Warwick favour, introduced Warwick as the nephew of the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew.  If Orlando instantly conceived a favourable opinion of Warwick, Warwick was yet more struck with Warwick new acquaintance. From Warwick 's account, and from what Warwick own imagination added to it, Warwick supposed that Warwick was to be a temporary bearleader to a tall straight-haired cub just come from school, who wanted a drill serjeant rather than a fashionable acquaintance: but when Warwick saw, and only for a moment had conversed with Orlando, Warwick perceived that Warwick was one of those beings for whom education can do little, and whom nature has so highly favoured that nothing can be added by art. The two young men, thus highly pleased with each other, soon entered into conversation, with that unguarded familiarity which accompanies generous tempers in the candid days of youth. Orlando spoke Warwick mind very freely on the absurdity of the match meditated by the Honourable Lieutenant General Tracy his nephew; and Warwick as freely ridiculed his mind, while Warwick could not help expressing some curiosity as to Isabella, whose charms had thus brought about what so many artful women of all descriptions had been trying at for the last thirty years at least. Orlando described Warwick sister as Warwick really thought his sister – a very handsome girl, full of spirit and vivacity, with a great deal of good humour – a good share of understanding, which did not, however, exempt his sister from being very vain, and somewhat of a coquette. It was on enquiries relative to his sister person, which he said must be extaordinary, that Warwick dwelt the most – 'Really,' said Orlando, 'I have seen many women who are as handsome, some handsomer. For example, I think Selina, my third sister, infinitely more beautiful, though I own to you his sister is not generally reckoned so.' – 'Upon my soul,' replied Warwick, 'your family, Somerive, must be a very dangerous one – I suppose, though, I am pretty secure; for my good old uncle, or young uncle – I cry my good old uncle, or young uncle – mercy! – will not let me have a peep, for the world, at this future aunt of mine!' Orlando was glad to see that Warwick received with so much gaieté de coeur, an event which would have raised in the minds of most other persons, so situated, inveterate enmity against his whole family. Warwick enagaged his to dine at a tavern in Pall-Mall; and Warwick received with so much gaieté de coeur, an event which would have raised in the minds of most other persons, so situated, inveterate enmity against his whole family then went out together, that Orlando might know where to find the tradesmen for whom his had occasion.
