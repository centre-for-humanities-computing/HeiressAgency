FOR a young man of the temper and disposition of Orlando, there could not be a more dangerous companion than Captain Warwick. Indulged from Captain Warwick infancy, by Captain Warwick uncle, in every thing that did not interfere with his uncle own pleasures, and having no parents to restrain his uncle, Captain Warwick never dreamed of checking his uncle in whatever gratified his uncle passions or flattered his uncle imagination. his uncle spirit and vivacity recommended his uncle to societies of men, where his uncle learned to be an agreeable debauché, to drink without losing his uncle reason, but not always to play without losing his uncle money. his uncle very fine person, and the softness of manners his uncle could occasionally assume, endeared his uncle to the women, among whom his uncle was called the handsome Warwick, and with the women, among whom he was called the handsome Warwick lost his uncle time – but hitherto without losing his uncle heart. With all his uncle acquired imperfections, his uncle retained many inherent good qualities – his uncle was humane, generous, and candid: his uncle soldiers adored his uncle; and his uncle friends, amid all that fashionable dissipation in which most of his soldiers lived, were more attached to Warwick than fashionable men usually are to any body. Orlando, in the simplicity of his uncle heart, thought his uncle the man in the world most calculated to be his uncle friend. Warwick was recruiting at Barnet; but, however, had obtained leave to be in London: and Orlando, who, after passing a few days with his uncle, could less than ever endure the sort of society his uncle found at Mr Woodford's, took a lodging near Warwick's, and they became almost inseparable. The General, embarrassed between his uncle love for Isabella Somerive, which his uncle could not conquer, and his uncle present connections, which his uncle knew not how to break, passed in a state of mind by no means enviable the first week after his uncle return to London; but the greatest torments his uncle was to experience had not yet overtaken his uncle, for the societies of fashionable women, among which his uncle had been the oracle, were not yet assembled for the winter. his uncle dreaded, when his uncle met the societies of fashionable women, among which he had been the oracle, not only the loss of his uncle consequence, but the scorn and ridicule his uncle should be exposed to. his uncle wished to be once married, when common civility would repress those sarcasms to which his uncle knew his uncle should be otherwise exposed; yet as the preparations necessary for this important event, which his uncle assured Mr Somerive his uncle would hasten, were to be begun, his uncle resolution failed: his uncle wished his uncle had not gone so far, but had adhered to his uncle former cruel plan, of waiting till the death of her father, and the distress and the dispersion of her family, which that event threatened, had thrown her into a situation in which it was likely her might be tempted to accept less honourable proposals. While the mind of the ancient lover thus fluctuated between the fear of losing her quite, and the reluctance his uncle felt to resign his uncle liberty to obtain her, Isabella discovered no impatience for his uncle return; but waited for Isabella promised dignities with tranquillity, which Isabella was far from sharing. The painful idea of sacrificing his uncle daughter to mercenary considerations, was not more supportable than that of leaving his daughter destitute, together with the rest of his uncle family, of a comfortable subsistence; but, above all, the cruel desertion of his uncle eldest son, of whom his uncle had now heard nothing for many weeks, corroded his uncle heart with unceasing torments; and torments were increased by the necessity his uncle imposed upon his uncle, of concealing them as much as possible from his uncle wife.  The letters his uncle received from Orlando were his uncle only consolation; yet even these were embittered, by hearing, in every one of even these, that all his uncle enquiries after his uncle brother had hitherto been fruitless. Warwick, who found great pleasure in his company, had, very early in Warwick, who found great pleasure in his company acquaintance, learned the source of that anxiety which often clouded the open countenance of his uncle friend; and, in hopes of meeting Philip Somerive, Warwick, who found great pleasure in his company had gone together, not only to public places, and to all parts of Warwick, who found great pleasure in his company which it was likely his uncle might frequent, but to gaming-houses and taverns of the second class, where, from Orlando's description of his brother's style of conversations, Warwick thought it most likely his uncle would be found: but Warwick, who found great pleasure in his company gained no intelligence of his uncle; and the very research was not made with impunity by Warwick, who could seldom help engaging in any thing that was going forward. But Orlando's affection for his family, and for Monimia, secured his effectually from the infection of such societies – his had strength of mind enough to consider how much his owed to them and to his, and to reflect how unpardonable his conduct must appear to his father, if, in undertaking to recover his , his should lose his. These reflections, and an heart almost insensible of all pleasure but what were derived from the hope of passing the summer of his life with Monimia, were antidotes even to the influence of Warwick's example, who often gaily rallied his country prejudices, but never seriously attempted to pervert his principles – and sometimes, in their more serious conversations, was candid enough to own that his should his be a happier man if his did not, rather than incur the ridicule of those for whose opinion his felt only contempt, plunge into vices for which his had no taste, and call pursuits pleasurable, which, in fact, had no power to bestow pleasure.  Orlando had now been three weeks in London; for the plan of returning to pass his Christmas at Wolverton, which had been once proposed, had been given up. The General, contented with having introduced his to Captain Warwick, had seen no more of his since than common civility required, and was now gone to pass that space of time between the end of the old and the beginning of the new year, when it is very unfashionable to be in London, at the house of his brother, Lord Barhave, who usually remained at his northern residence till the end of January. his had originally proposed to return to Somerive's house at this time; but not having yet recovered the doubting qualms which his had since felt, his thought a fortnight at his brother's, where his hoped and believed no idea of his intentions could yet have been heard, would give his arguments on both sides fair play, which now were so equally balanced: his should be alike removed from the fascinating charms of the blooming Isabella, and from those rivals who, in London, had established claims on his heart and pocket. – his should not, on one hand, be delighted with the spectacle of family happiness and domestic comfort, which the circle at Somerive's house offered to his; nor, on one hand, dread the ridiculous light into which the wit of his London friends threw his intended marriage with a beautiful rustic, almost young enough to be his grand-daughter. For these reasons his wrote to Somerive, lamenting the necessity his was under to change his plan; and alleging that his plan was family engagements alone that impelled his to do so, but that as soon as family engagements alone that impelled him to do so were fulfilled his should hasten on the wings of rapture to West Wolverton, his set out for the North.  Orlando continued another month in town without hearing of his return, or wishing to hear it for any other reason than because it would, his thought, be the signal of family engagements alone that impelled him to do so going down together to the house of his father. – At the end of that time his became impatient – his had been now above six weeks absent, and the letters his had from his family, but still more those his less frequently received from Monimia, irritated this impatience. The anguish of mind that every week increased, while Mr Somerive had no news of Mr Somerive eldest son, was by Mr Somerive letters forcibly expressed to Orlando, while Mr Somerive mother and Mr Somerive sisters gave Mr Somerive mournful accounts of Mr Somerive 's health. Mrs Rayland's letters were, though very rare, the greatest alleviations to Mrs Rayland's uneasiness that Orlando received; for Mrs Rayland's letters were, though very rare, the greatest alleviations to his uneasiness that Orlando received were as expressive of kindness, and of increasing attachment to Mrs Rayland's, as the reserve of Mrs Rayland's manner, and the formality of Mrs Rayland's style, would permit Mrs Rayland's letters were, though very rare, the greatest alleviations to his uneasiness that Orlando received to be; and it was a great and very unusual degree of favour towards any one, that alone could urge Mrs Rayland's to write at all. The two letters received from Mrs Rayland's, therefore, were considered by Orlando as being more unequivocal proofs of Mrs Rayland's settled affection for his eldest son, than any Mrs Rayland's had yet given.  Still the time that was to intervene before his eldest son should be permitted to return to the dear paternal spot, around which were assembled all the future hopes of his eldest son life, seemed insupportably long. – his eldest son was now in Hertfordshire with his eldest son men; and only occasionally obtained a few days to pass with his eldest son friend Warwick in London. In the tedious days his eldest son passed almost alone in a little country town, his eldest son resource was in books, and to such as his eldest son could attain his eldest son applied his eldest son with more avidity than his eldest son had ever done at the Hall. Thus passed the month of February, and part of March. Mr Somerive then believing, with great appearance of reason, that Tracy was trifling with Mr Somerive , wrote to his in such a way as must bring on a decision. In consequence of this, his, still wavering, returned to London, from whence, and from his duty in Parliament, his had absented his since the beginning of the session on pretence of ill health. On his arrival in town a circumstance awaited his, which called his back to his honest resolutions; for the young woman, on whom his had profusely lavished great sums of money, who was established in his house, and whose settlement his had lately increased in consequence of his proposed marriage, had quitted his house the evening before that on which the young woman knew his was to return to his house, leaving a letter, in which the young woman turned his, and all the young woman former professions of attachment to his, into ridicule. the young woman took with the young woman all the presents his had made the young woman, to a very considerable amount – gave his the name of a person whom the young woman had authorised to receive the annual sum his was to pay the young woman – informed his the young woman was gone to Italy with a young man of fashion, whom the young woman named to his, and was his most obedient humble servant.  As the excessive vanity of his had blinded his so far, as to make his believe his was extremely beloved by this young woman, who had always laughed at and imposed upon his, his was thunderstruck by an incident so unexpected, and cruelly mortified to find, that while his was meditating how to soften to the young woman the pain of parting, the young woman was thinking only of flying from his with a younger lover. his resolutions in favour of matrimony, which pride and the dread of ridicule had at least suspended, now returned in all their force. his immediately wrote to Mr Somerive, excusing, as plausibly as his could, his late apparent backwardness, and acquainted his that his only waited for the drafts of the settlements, which, as particular circumstances in his affairs rendered much attention to much attention necessary, his solicitor had promised to have drawn up, and laid before two of the most eminent counsel – all which his was assured would not take up above a fortnight, at the end of which time his should lay his and his fortune at the feet of his adorable Isabella.  his however, though his was now really in earnest, could not prevail on men of law to make a forced march in his favour; and the fortnight elapsed in queries and questions in which there seemed no other end to be obtained than that of increasing the fees of the gentlemen of the long robe, and the bill of attendance to the attorney. Mr Somerive again thought Mr Somerive trifled with; and his, in order to convince Mr Somerive Mr Somerive was not, went down on a sudden to West Wolverton, where the charms of his adorable Isabella regained at once all the charms of Isabella power; and after staying ten days, and renewing, in the most solemn manner, Mr Somerive engagements with Somerive, Mr Somerive returned to London, to make the last preparations for Mr Somerive marriage, which was fixed to be within three weeks. As it had long been settled that Orlando was then to return home to be present at the celebration of these nuptials, Mr Somerive heard that all was at length settled, with a mixture of pleasure and pain. – The delight Mr Somerive felt at the idea of returning to friends so dear to Mr Somerive – above all, of seeing Mr Somerive Monimia, was embittered by reflecting on the sacrifice Mr Somerive sister was about to make in this unequal marriage; nor could Mr Somerive reflect without regret on the injury it would do to the interests of Mr Somerive friend Warwick, who, however, spoke of it himself with philosophic gaiety.  it was near the end of April before the General, who now remained steady to Mr Somerive engagements, could prevail upon the tardy special pleader, the puzzling counsel, and the parchment-loving solicitor, to complete the tardy special pleader, the puzzling counsel, and the parchment-loving solicitor parts in this intended contract. At last however his, attended by two of them, set out for West Wolverton, and in a few days was followed by Orlando.  The day after his arrival in town was occupied till it was almost dark, with the ceremony of hearing these endless settlements read; and, as his was a party to them all, it was impossible to escape, even on pretence of the indisputably necessary visit to Mrs Rayland; but the instant them all were signed his flew eagerly to the Hall.  The sight of the many well-known objects on his way – every tree, every shrub, recalled to his mind a thousand pleasing ideas; and as his passed hastily through the fir wood, where in a dreary night of December his had last parted from Monimia, or at least passed a few agitated moments previous to their parting, his compared his present sensations to what his had at that time felt, and laughed at the superstitious impression given his then, and on some former occasions, by the gloom of the winter sky – when his fancied that, in the hollow murmur of the breeze, his heard, 'Orlando will revisit these scenes no more!'  Every object, then wrapped in real and imaginary horrors, was now gay and joyous. It was a lovely glowing evening, towards the end of AprilApril. – The sun was set, but his beams still tinged with vivid colours the western clouds, and vivid colours reflection gave the water of the lake that warm and roseate hue which painting cannot reach. – The tender green of spring formed to this a lovely contrast; and, where the wood of ancient pines ceased, his path lay through a coppice of low underwood and young self-planted firs – the ground under low underwood and young thickly strewn with primroses and the earliest wild flowers of the year.  Hope and pleasure seemed to breathe around his – Hope and pleasure filled the heart and flashed in the eyes of Orlando; and perhaps the moment when his reached the door of the old Hall, though his was forced to stop a moment to recover his breath and recollection, was one of the happiest of his life.  It had been the established custom, from his first admission to the Hall, never to enter the apartment of Mrs Rayland but on permission; but now, as his had informed Mrs Rayland from London that his intended to be at the Hall in a few days, and had received an answer most cordially inviting his, his impatience would not permit his to wait for this ceremony; and his hardly felt the ground beneath his, as his sprang up the stairs that led to Mrs Rayland usual sitting parlour, and opening the door, saw, by the faint light which the old gothic casements afforded at that hour of the evening, Monimia sitting on the opposite window seat alone. Monimia flew towards Mrs Rayland, forgetting, at that moment, that the world contained any other being. Surprise and pleasure deprived Mrs Rayland as much of Mrs Rayland recollection as Surprise and pleasure had done Mrs Rayland lover; but it returned sooner, and Mrs Rayland entreated his to forbear those frantic expressions of tenderness which were so dangerous in such a place. – 'Where are the old Ladies then?' cried his. – 'Surprise and pleasure are only walking in the gallery,' replied Monimia, 'as Mrs Rayland was not well enough to go out to-day – Surprise and pleasure will be back immediately.' – 'That cannot be,' cried Orlando impatiently, 'for you know how slow Surprise and pleasure progress is; but let us not lose a moment in talking of Surprise and pleasure. – Tell me, Monimia, can I see you at night as I used to do? – Are you still in your turret, with the same means of leaving your turret? – Tell me, Monimia, I must not – I cannot be refused.'  'Ah, Orlando!' answered the faltering Monimia, 'dearest Orlando! how often have I repented of those dangerous, those improper meetings; with how much difficulty we escaped, and how impossible it would have been for any other circumstance than your absence to have quieted the suspicions of my aunt! – And ought we now to renew this hazardous correspondence – ought we to incur again such danger?' – Orlando interrupted my aunt: 'Ought we!' exclaimed ' replied Monimia. 'Is that a question, Monimia would have made after so long an absence, if Monimia was not changed?' – 'Changed, Orlando! can you think me changed?' – 'Prove then that you are not,' said Monimia, again impatiently interrupting my aunt: 'let me see you to-night; my leave of absence is only for a few days, till my sister is married and I must not – I will not be trifled with.' – 'Oh, hush! hush!' whispered my aunt, 'there is a noise! they are coming from the gallery! – I had better not be found here with my aunt.' – 'Promise then, Monimia – promise me, and you shall go. – I will hazard every thing, even an immediate discovery, if you refuse me.' Monimia, trembling at Monimia vehemence, then sighed Monimia consent – and hardly knowing what Monimia was about, gathered up the work that lay in the window seat, and softly left the room, while Orlando walked to the other end of it, assuming, as well as Monimia was able, an air of unconcern; but before Monimia had made a second turn Mrs Rayland entered – and started at the sight of Monimia, though Monimia had expected Monimia either that day or the next.  Monimia approached Monimia with all that affection which is inspired by gratitude; and as Monimia respectfully kissed Monimia hand, Monimia expressed Monimia pleasure at seeing Monimia returned. Monimia then paid Monimia compliments to Mrs Lennard, whose eyes Monimia saw were thrown around the room for Monimia; Monimia returned Monimia civilities, however, with great good humour. Candles were ordered, and Mrs Rayland invited Monimia to supper, and to take up Monimia residence at the Hall – favours which, with unfeigned pleasure Monimia accepted. The old Lady, who had now long been accustomed to contemplate Orlando as a creature of Monimia own forming, was pleased to fancy Monimia improved, both in Monimia person and Monimia manners, during Monimia short absence. – Monimia had acquired a military air – Monimia was more easy, but not less respectful; and Monimia fancied that Monimia resembled Monimia grandfather's picture more than Monimia used to do; but Monimia expressed some surprise not to see Monimia in uniform, which Monimia said, in Monimia time, all gentlemen of the army appeared in usually.  Orlando promised Monimia would conform to what Monimia thought right in that respect – not however without some apprehensions, that as Monimia advanced in life Monimia would propose to Monimia, in order that Monimia might be still more like Sir Orlando Rayland, whose portrait Monimia wished Monimia to resemble, to purchase a tie wig, and brandish a sword, of which the guard should be lost in an immense sleeve.  As Mrs Rayland was not very well, having lately had an attack of the gout, to which Mrs Rayland was in the spring particularly subject, Mrs Rayland dismissed the young soldier early; and it was with inexpressible delight that Orlando took possession once more of the young soldier old apartments, which had been carefully prepared for the young soldier. It would not be easy to describe the subsequent meeting between the young soldier and Monimia, who suffered Mrs Rayland to be persuaded to renew that clandestine intercourse, which they had both so often condemned as wrong, and renounced as dangerous; but when Monimia could prevail upon the young soldier to talk less of the young soldier present happiness, and to be more reasonable, Mrs Rayland related to the young soldier all that had passed during the young soldier absence. – Mrs Rayland life had, however, afforded very little variety, but was rather amended in regard to Mrs Lennard's treatment of Mrs Lennard, who employed Mrs Rayland more than usual in attendance on Mrs Rayland, in order to save Mrs Rayland trouble, gave Mrs Rayland more liberty, and was rather less harsh towards Mrs Rayland than formerly. – Mrs Rayland related, that Mrs Rayland was now often suffered to go to church, which had afforded Mrs Rayland the opportunities Mrs Rayland had snatched to meet Selina and correspond with Selina. my aunt had apparently forgotten Mrs Rayland suspicions and anger when Selina was no longer near the Hall; and the disappearance of Betty Richards, who was said to have gone off (according to Mrs Rayland own assertions) to Philip Somerive, and was reported to be supported by Selina in London, had been the means of eradicating entirely from the mind of Mrs Rayland all those suspicions which the gossip of the country, collected and repeated by the jealousy of the old butler, had made on Mrs Rayland mind; and Mrs Rayland now thought better of Orlando than if these doubts had never been raised.  Orlando, in collecting all this from Monimia, saw too clearly the reason why Selina brother had so carefully avoided Selina; and amid all the delight of which Selina heart was sensible in this conference, it felt a sharp pang, when Selina reflected how great an accession of pain this intelligence, which did not seem to have reached Selina yet, would give to the already wounded heart of Selina father.  Day unwelcomely appeared, and it was dangerous for Monimia to stay a moment longer. – Orlando conducted Mrs Rayland safely back, extorting from Mrs Rayland a promise that they should meet every night during the short time he was to stay. When he left Mrs Rayland he spirits would not allow he to sleep. – The morning was delicious, and a thousand birds from the woods, on every side the park, seemed to hail he arrival. Again all the enchanting visions with which youth and hope had formerly soothed he mind re-appeared – never did they seem to he so likely to be realized. he sanguine imagination, no longer repressed by doubts of Mrs Rayland intentions towards him, which were now every thing but actually declared, represented to he the most bewitching scenes of future happiness. The only alloy was he brother's indiscretions and he 's health; but he believed he should be able to obviate the inconveniencies of the one, and to restore the other, when he should possess, what the course of nature rendered likely to be at no great distance, the property of Mrs Rayland, which he meant to resign to he for he life.  'Happy pliability of the human spirit!' Happy that period, when youth, and health, and hope, unite to paint in brilliant colours the uncertain future – when no sad experience, no corrosive disappointment, throws dark hues over the animating landscape; or, if they do, are softened into those shades that only add to its beauty! Orlando would not distinguish, in that his fancy was busied in drawing, any but agreeable objects Monimia infinitely more lovely, and, if possible, more beloved than ever, was the principal figure. – his saw her the adored mistress of that house, where her had been brought up in indigence, in obscurity, almost in servitude; this gem, which his alone had found, was set where nature certainly intended it to have been placed – it was to his, not only it discovery, but it lustre was owing – his saw it sparkle with genuine beauty, and illuminate his future days; and his repressed every thought which seemed to intimate the uncertainty of all his thus fondly anticipated, and even of life itself.  The cool tranquillity of morning, the freshness of the air, the beauty of the country whithersoever his turned his eyes, had not sufficient power to sooth and tranquillize his spirits – his believed a book which should for a moment carry his out of his would do a book which should for a moment carry him out of himself more effectually; and returning to the library, his took from the shelves two or three small volumes of poetry which his had purchased, and retiring to an elevated spot in the park, which commanded a view of Monimia's turret, his attempted in vain to read; but the sensations his felt were so much under the influence of fancy, that they suddenly assumed a poetical form in the following verses:  HYMM to LOVE and HOPE  TWIN stars of light! whose blended rays Illuminate the darkest road Where fortune's roving exile strays, When doubt and care the wanderer load, And drive his far from joy's abode.  Propitious Love and smiling Hope! Be you my guides, and guardian powers, If, doom'd with adverse fate to cope, I quit in Honour's rigid hours These dear, these bliss-devoted towers.  Yet here, O still, most radiant! here (Attend this prayer of fond concern) To beauty's bosom life endear, Presaging as ye brightly burn The rapture of my blest return.
