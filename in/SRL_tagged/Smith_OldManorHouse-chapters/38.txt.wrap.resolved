THE increasing difficulties to which the British army, under the command of General Burgoyne, were at this period exposed, have been so often described, and so largely insisted upon, that THE increasing difficulties to which the British army, under the command of General Burgoyne, were at this period exposed need not here be repeated. Deserted by the Canadians and other Americans, who were discouraged by THE increasing difficulties to which the British army, under the command of General Burgoyne, were at this period exposed perilous situation – in want of necessary provisions, and seeing THE increasing difficulties to which the British army, under the command of General Burgoyne, were at this period exposed likely to be surrounded – it was determined that, if the assistance THE increasing difficulties to which the British army, under the command of General Burgoyne, were at this period exposed had been taught to expect from New York did not arrive before the expiration of another fortnight, THE increasing difficulties to which the British army, under the command of General Burgoyne, were at this period exposed must give up all hopes of defence. In the mean time, however, a movement was resolved upon by a chosen body of fifteen hundred men, which brought on a general attack from the Americans, who carried part of the British lines, and night only put an end to the combat, in which a great number of brave men fell, as well English as Germans. Among the slain was Orlando's respectable friend Fleming, who, though hardly recovered of his former wound, had hurried without orders to defend the lines, and was shot through the lungs as his was leading on his men to repulse a party of the enemy with the bayonet. – Orlando, who was only a few paces from his, saw his fall; and, amid the impetuosity of the action, his ran towards his, exhorting his men to proceed. – Fleming, as his lifted his up, knew his, and, wringing his hand, said – 'Go, my dear boy – don't waste a moment upon his – I am killed! but I die contented if those scoundrels are driven off. – If you return to England, be a friend to my poor wife – to my poor little ones!' He spoke these last words with extreme difficulty, as the blood choked He. Orlando saw He noble spirit depart, and hastily ordering the black servant (who had belonged to Warwick, and now attended on He) to carry off the body, He plunged with a degree of desperation into the thickest of the battle; which lasted, however, only a few moments longer, because, as it was by that time too dark to distinguish friends from foes, each party found it necessary to retreat. The British passed the rest of the night in the melancholy employment of ascertaining each party loss, which was very considerable in killed and prisoners, particularly in officers, of whom some that had been brought off the field were mortally wounded. Orlando, with concern that superseded every thought for himself, made it himself first care to visit the body of himself gallant friend, in a sort of lingering hope that himself might yet live: but lingering hope was immediately at an end; and Orlando had no other comfort than in recollecting that himself died gloriously, and shared an honourable grave with many other brave officers who ended a career of honour in this fatal field. The interval between this action and the removal of the British camp by night, from a situation no longer tenable, was short, but dreadful. Fatigue and famine, great as those evils were, seemed less terrible to the minds of the English, than the certainty that they must very soon surrender to an enemy whom they at once abhorred and contemned. The officers still endeavoured to encourage The officers men, and keep up the spirits of each other – The officers recollected other occasions in which armies, in a condition equally desperate, had broken through The officers enemies, and conquered those who hoped to have destroyed The officers: but the commander himself knew the fallacy of these hopes, and saw that, unless succours arrived in a very few days, the surrender of the commander himself army was inevitable.  The officers had now, however, a messenger from New York, with information that three thousand men were advancing to three thousand men assistance up Hudson's River; but this expedition had been so delayed, or was, after this expedition was undertaken, so managed, that there appeared not the least probability of three thousand men arriving in time to save from the necessity of a surrender his army. a messenger from New York, however, who had with infinite difficulty made the commander himself way to the English camp from New York, brought a few letters to the British officers – and among the British officers –, Orlando, with a beating heart, and with hands so tremulous that the commander himself could hardly break the seal, opened a packet from the commander himself sister Selina. a packet contained a short letter from his sister Selina, the comfortless purport of which, in regard to his family, was repeated in what follows from Monimia herself, whose letter Selina had inclosed:   Rayland Hall, 28th June 1777.  'Though I know it is yet impossible for me to hear from you, every moment now seems to me an age. – Alas! Orlando, how little satisfactory was the short letter I received from Portsmouth! yet I know you could not write more, hurried as you were. You have now been gone six long – long weeks, and that is only a very small portion of the time you are to be absent, though to me it seems already a thousand years.  'I do not love, Orlando, to say much of me, unless I could tell you any thing that would make you happy, which Heaven knows I cannot! unless it is merely that I am as well as so unhappy a being can be. It would be some comfort to me, if what I cannot tell you of me, I could relate of your dear family: but Selina will tell you, if I do not, that your father's health is still in a very precarious state, and that all your friends have suffered greatly by Isabella's going from all your friends, and by all your friends not knowing what is become of Selina; for though Selina wrote to all your friends from Portsmouth, desiring all your friends forgiveness, and informing all your friends that Selina had gone off to be married to Captain Warwick, and that Selina unconquerable aversion to General Tracy was partly the reason of Selina doing so; yet all your friends have never heard that Selina was really married, nor have any of Captain Warwick friends, of whom your father has made constant enquiries, had any intelligence of your father. It is concluded that your father is gone with your sister to America; but not knowing it certainly, is a continual source of distress both to Mr and Mrs Somerive; sadly aggravated, I fear, by Mr and Mrs Somerive hearing but too much of your brother, who is known to be living in London in great splendour, which it is said your father supports by gaming. Your poor mother went up with Selina about ten days since, in hopes of seeing your father, and persuading your father to return to your father family. Selina described the meeting to Selina, and half broke my heart by the description. Your poor mother could obtain was, a sort of half promise that your father would come down to West Wolverton in August or September, with which Selina had endeavoured to console your father; and I find has kept to Selina the greatest part of what passed, and has no hope of your father changing your father conduct.  'The poor old General has never recovered the shock and mortification of Isabella's defection. your father left West Wolverton as soon afterwards as the gout allowed your father to move; and, it is said, has disinherited Captain Warwick, and given your father whole fortune to your father brother's son, whose title I cannot now recollect – However, your father does not seem to resent Isabella's desertion of your father towards the rest of your family; for I understand that it was by your father means your mother procured an interview with your brother; and that your father was very obliging to your mother and Selina while her and Selina were in London. I have, though with a heavy heart, Heaven knows! rallied Selina upon this; and told Selina, that perhaps the gallant General, who always admired Selina, may have an intention of transferring his affections to Selina; but Selina assures me, and I easily believe it, that were his emperor of the world Selina would not accept emperor of the world.  'And now, Orlando, must I talk to you of your poor Monimia – Ah! it is reluctantly I do it; for I can tell you nothing but what will make you unhappy. Mrs Rayland seems to regret your absence very much; Mrs Rayland speaks of you every day, and appears to Selina to be sorry Mrs Rayland ever suffered you to depart. Judge, dear Orlando! whether I do not execute the little offices about Mrs Rayland, which now Mrs Rayland will suffer no other person to do, with redoubled pleasure, when I hear Mrs Rayland thus speaking of you like a tender mother! I wonder how I ever disliked Mrs Rayland, and thought Mrs Rayland severe. Ah! I wish Mrs Lennard had half as much kindness; yet has Mrs Lennard Mrs Rayland had much to disturb Mrs Rayland lately, and my aunt reason to be in good humour. Mr Harbourne, the gentleman who has so long managed the business of the Rayland estate, is dead; and within these last ten days my aunt has prevailed upon Mrs Rayland to replace my aunt with a Mr Roker, who Mrs Rayland tells me is a relation of hers, and a relation of mine, which may be; but of all the disagreeable men I ever beheld, my aunt is to Selina the most disagreeable – my aunt has, however, got every thing into my aunt hands through the influence of my aunt; and my aunt nephew, a creature as odious as my aunt, is put into the house at North Park End, where Mr Harbourne used to be for a month or two; which is fitting up quite in an elegant style, as to new papering, painting, &c. I hope when it is done my aunt will be less at the house than my aunt is now; for, at present, my aunt passes every day here, and very often the night; though I never could observe that my aunt hateful cringing manners pleased Mrs Rayland, who does not know, I believe, that my aunt has taken possession of your room. – Oh! how different a possessor from what it ought to have! I meant, Orlando, to have said as little of this disagreeable change as I could; but my unconquerable aversion to these two men has betrayed me into saying more about these two men than I intended: yet I find from Selina, that your father is uneasy at these two men introduction to the management of the Rayland estate, and says that Roker is a man of the worst character of any attorney in the country.  'Perhaps you will impatiently exclaim, Why does Monimia talk to Selina about these attorneys when Monimia began with saying Monimia would mention Monimia? It is, Orlando, because these attorneys have had more influence already in injuring my peace than you would suppose likely. This Roker (the nephew), were This Roker (the nephew) not young enough almost to be This Roker (the nephew) grandson, I should really fancy was a lover of my aunt Lennard's. This Roker (the nephew) is a great raw-boned fright of a man, I think, with two eyes that look I know not how, but particularly horrible to Selina – a wide mouth, full of great teeth, that are only the more hideous for being white, because This Roker (the nephew) face is so red that, when This Roker (the nephew) grins, the contrast makes This Roker (the nephew) seem ready to devour one; then This Roker (the nephew) has a red beard, and a great bushy head of carroty hair: but all this my aunt says is handsome; and that this giant-looking monster, who is not, I think, above eight-and-twenty, is a fine manly figure. The man returns, or rather earns, this her good opinion of The man, by flattery so fulsome that really I blush for my aunt when I hear it; which, however, my aunt takes care I shall do as little as possible, for my aunt is almost always out of humour with Selina on some pretence or other when he comes into the room where I am, and generally contrives some excuse to send me away; and before my aunt the disagreeable monster affects not to notice me: but if ever I meet he by accident in the house, which I avoid as much as I can, he speaks to Selina so impertinently that I have often been provoked to tears; indeed I am convinced he would be more insolent if I did not threaten that I would acquaint my aunt.  'I pass almost every moment of the time that Mrs Rayland does not want me, in my own room; and you know how little I should regret never leaving it, if I could there possess quiet, and read the books you left me directions to go through. But even these comforts are denied my aunt! and while my very soul sickens to tell you how, because you will in one respect fancy yourself the cause of it, it is necessary that I adhere to my promise, Orlando, and conceal nothing from yourself.  'You recollect, my dear friend, the pain we both endured, and the risk you incurred (of which I cannot now think without trembling), in consequence of that unlucky meeting with Sir John Belgrave. – This person, you know, left the country soon after, and went into Scotland with your brother; and I remember you telling me afterwards, that This person was gone abroad for This person health – Would to Heaven This person had staid there, that I might never have heard again a name I could never hear without terror!  'It is to-day a week since, Mrs Rayland being extremely well, which Mrs Rayland had not been for some days before, my aunt desired leave to go out to dinner with This Roker (the nephew) family, who were on a visit at West Wolverton, at farmer Stepney's. – Mrs Rayland accordingly had the coach, and set out in great form, leaving me strict orders not to quit Mrs Rayland mistress. After tea the evening was so warm, and Mrs Rayland felt Mrs Rayland so well, that Mrs Rayland had an inclination to get into the park chair; and for Pattenson to lead the old pony in it round the park slowly, that Mrs Rayland might see the alterations and repairs which Mrs Rayland had been persuaded to order for the accommodation of the nephew and deputy of Mrs Rayland new steward at North Park; and after Mrs Rayland was seated by the footman safely in this low carriage, which you know Mrs Rayland has not been in for almost two years, Mrs Rayland said Mrs Rayland found it very pleasant, and was sure Mrs Rayland could bear to go quite up to the lodge; but, lest Mrs Rayland should be faint, Mrs Rayland ordered me to walk by the side of the park chair with Mrs Rayland drops. Pattenson did all Pattenson could to persuade Mrs Rayland that the distance would be too much for Mrs Rayland; but Mrs Rayland spoke to Pattenson more sharply than ever I heard Mrs Rayland do before – saying, that Mrs Rayland was the best judge of that; and we set out, the carriage being drawn only a foot pace, so that I found no difficulty in keeping up with the carriage. As we went along, we saw your horse lying under the chesnut trees in the long walk; for your horse was a very hot evening, and Pattenson had gone there for shade. Mrs Rayland called to me, and pointed Mrs Rayland out to me – 'Poor creature!' said Mrs Rayland, 'Mrs Rayland looks melancholy, as if Mrs Rayland missed Mrs Rayland master; and Mrs Rayland is quite solitary too in the park.' Then speaking to Pattenson, Mrs Rayland asked if Mrs Rayland was well taken care of? – While I, with a sigh, could have answered Mrs Rayland remark, by saying – Ah, Madam! there are other beings who miss Orlando yet more than that beloved animal, and who are more solitary and undone than Mrs Rayland is. – But I affected to be at ease; and hope my countenance did not betray how much my heart was otherwise. – Indeed there was the less danger of this, because Pattenson's answer, which was very surly, and signified that Pattenson had better ask about your horse of Jacob, with whom it was left in charge, if Pattenson had any doubts about it, diverted Mrs Rayland attention from me, and fixed it upon Pattenson, towards whom Pattenson expressed Pattenson displeasure. Indeed Mrs Rayland has seemed to me for some time to be losing ground in Pattenson favour. At length we reached the lodge; and as the workmen were putting up a new door, which you know is next the high road from Carloraine Castle to Wolverton and other villages, and putting on a new coat of stucco on that side, Mrs Rayland ordered Pattenson to lead the chaise round thither, and stopped some moments there, while Mrs Rayland talked to the carpenter and plasterer, who were just going from their work. Mrs Rayland kindly said to Mrs Rayland 'If you are tired, Mary, sit down at my feet and rest Mary.' – I assured Mrs Rayland I was not; but Mrs Rayland bade me get Mrs Rayland a glass of water out of the house, and give Mrs Rayland a few drops, lest Mrs Rayland should find the ride too much before Mrs Rayland got home. There was not a glass in the house; so I ran across the way to James Carter's cottage, which is, you know, about fifty yards beyond the lodge, on the opposite side. James Carter's wife went out with the water, and I followed His wife; when a gentleman, attended by two servants, rode up so very fast, that James Carter's horse almost trampled on me before I could cross the road. James Carter's checked I could cross the road, however, when James Carter's saw me, and exclaiming: with a great oath – 'My lovely little wood-nymph! By all that's sacred His wife shall not now escape me!' James Carter's then alighted from his horse, and (as I conclude, not seeing Mrs Rayland and Mrs Rayland servants, who were concealed partly by the projection of the lodge on that side, and partly by the slight turning in the road) rudely seized me. – I shrieked aloud; and the woman, who was but a few paces before me, began to remonstrate with him – I hardly knew, so great was my terror and confusion, what either of my terror and confusion said; but upon Pattenson's advancing with Robert, who had also accompanied the chaise, him let me go, saying, 'You are still at the Hall then; I shall see you again, for I find your gallant defender has resigned him post.' him said this as him mounted him , and as him, almost senseless, was led by James Carter's's wife towards Mrs Rayland, who, hearing from her how the gentleman had behaved, expressed great indignation; and as the gentleman was by this time past her, her ordered Pattenson to follow the gentleman, and let the gentleman know that her desired to speak to the gentleman. I would have prevented this if I had retained breath or recollection enough to speak; but I sat down on the foot-stool of the chaise, unable to utter a word to prevent Pattenson's waddling away after Sir John, to whom, as there were no hopes of the gentleman overtaking the gentleman, the gentleman hollaed – Sir John stopped Sir John horse, and Pattenson, puffing and blowing with hurry and anger, delivered, and I suppose in no very complaisant terms, Sir John Lady's message – I did not hear his Lady's message –, but I distinguished Sir John's answer, which was –  'Come to his Lady, good fellow? No; his Lady will excuse me – my business is with young ladies; I have too much respect for the old ones to intrude upon the old ones. My service to the ancient gentlewoman of the Hall, good Mr favourite butler, and tell his Lady, if his Lady has any commands for me, his Lady must employ one of his Lady pretty handmaids (that I saw just now, if his Lady pleases); and his Lady will not fail to find for his Lady embassy a more favourable reception than I think it necessary to give your worship.' Sir John then laughing aloud at Sir John own wit, in which Sir John two servants accompanied Sir John, put Sir John horse into a gallop, and was out of sight in an instant; long before Pattenson, whom rage and indignation did not render more active, had reached Mrs Rayland, and repeated this message, not without some additions of Sir John own, to his Ladyhis Lady. I think I never saw Mrs Rayland so much disturbed as at the general brutality of this rude stranger. I however soon recovered of my alarm, when I found that this very disagreeable scene had ended without bringing on any conversation as to what had formerly passed; and I hoped and believed I should hear no more of Sir John Belgrave. Mrs Rayland, from the agitation of spirits this insult had thrown Mrs Rayland into, was quite ill when Mrs Rayland got back to the Hall; but the next day, after Mrs Rayland had given vent to Mrs Rayland displeasure, by talking about it to my aunt Lennard, and every one who approached Mrs Rayland, Mrs Rayland seemed to recover; and the bustle that this ridiculous man had occasioned gradually died away. It happened on Friday, and on the following Sunday I had promised to meet Selina, whom I had never had an opportunity of seeing after Mrs Rayland return from London till now. We were equally eager to meet each other; and as I have now no difficulty in obtaining leave to walk in the park when my aunt is with his Lady, I got my aunt permission to go out on this evening, and passed with We dearest Selina an hour, the most delightful and yet the most melancholy that I have known since your departure. our dearest Selina was afraid of being missed, as our dearest Selina told me our dearest Selina father was never easy when our dearest Selina was out of her father sight; and now only stole out while her father was asleep after dinner. our dearest Selina left me therefore sooner than either of We wished; but after our dearest Selina was gone I sat some time weeping where our dearest Selina had left me. It was the bench, Orlando, in the fir grove, by the boat-house, where we sat all together when you made we promise to meet there, and talk of you when you should be gone. All your sister had told me of what passed in London between your mother and your brother, and of her father's dejected spirits and declining health, had affected me more than I can describe: but after I had indulged my tears some time, I recollected your charge to All your sister to keep up my spirits, and I endeavoured to conquer this depression. The sun was nearly set, and I went over the pond-head by the great cascade, in order to go home the nearest way. I had just passed through the high plantation, and was entering the park, when I saw Sir John Belgrave approaching me. – Had I met Sir John Belgrave in the path of the high plantation, Sir John Belgrave would have been impossible for me to have escaped Sir John Belgrave; but now, as the park was open before All your sister, I ran the instant I observed Sir John Belgrave the opposite way. Sir John Belgrave pursued me for some time, intreating me to stop, and assuring me that Sir John Belgrave meant only to beg my pardon for Sir John Belgrave behaviour two days before, with a great deal of other nonsense; which I did not, however, hear much of, for I was almost in a moment within sight of the house, and I saw Sir John Belgrave turn back. I arrived quite out of breath, and sadly terrified, but I dared not complain. After I recovered All your sister, my greatest concern was to think that I could never meet our dearest Selina without fearing a repetition of this disagreeable adventure; but I had now nobody to listen to my complaints, or to relieve me from my sorrows. I thought the sermon of that evening the most tedious and uninteresting I had ever read and both the old ladies were certainly particularly ill humoured, my aunt more especially, who was snappish and peevish to such a degree that she almost quarrelled with Mrs Rayland: but, as she could not vent all she spleen on she, all her spleen on her fell upon All your sister; and I went to bed in more than usual wretchedness, and for the first time wished that the younger Roker might return to the Hall – for to the Hall – having been two days absent I imputed the irritability of my poor aunt's temper.  'Ah! Orlando, how dreary now seemed my own room, to which when you were here, I used to retire with so much delight from all the discomforts of my lot! It was a lovely moonlight night, and yet early when I went to the turret. From the window I looked into the park, with sensations how different from those I used to feel when I expected to see you cross It! I was restless and wretched, and knew I could not sleep if I went to bed; or, if I did, I feared I should dream of Sir John Belgrave's pursuing me. I wished for some book I never had read, for you have often told me that nothing so soon quieted the mind, and led the troubled spirit away from the troubled spirit own sad reflections, as some amusing or instructive author; but I had none in my own room but those books of your own that you gave me, which I had read over and over again; and since this Mr Roker has occasionally been in possession of your apartment next the study, and I once met him as I was going thither, I have never had the courage to venture down after the books as I used to do. Some of the poems however, Orlando, that you gave me, I am never, never weary of reading, though I can say Some of the poems however, Orlando, that you gave me almost by heart; and therefore, when I was tired of looking at the moon, I took up that little volume of Gray, and read that beautiful ode to Adversity which you have so often bade me admire; and indeed I thought, Orlando that we, though suffering under its 'iron scourge and torturing hour, 'were yet in a situation more really happy than the prosperous worthless Sir John Belgrave, who was able to enjoy every luxury of life, while you were wandering about the world in danger and in sorrow. Alas! these thoughts, however consoling at first, brought on a train of others, and fears, the most terrible fears for your precious life assailed me. My fancy conjured up a thousand horrid visions, and dwelt on a thousand terrible possibilities, till at length I found myself unable to bear the wretchedness I had thus created for myself, and I determined to attempt at least to lose it in sleep and was, from mere fatigue of spirits, beginning to doze, when I was startled by a rap at the door at the back of the bed. I believed it to be a dream, too well recollecting that you were not there. When I listened a moment, and the noise was repeated, never, among all the terrors I have suffered, did I feel any alarm like this – I had not courage to speak, nor to move: my first idea was to run into my own room; but then I must have discovered to my aunt what we have so anxiously concealed; and of which, I believe, my aunt never had the least notion; for whatever might be my aunt suspicions of we meeting, my aunt never seemed to guess how. While I deliberated in the most fearful agitation what it would be best to do, the noise was made a third time, louder than before; and a voice called, in a half whisper, Miss! Miss!  'For God's sake, who is there?' cried I, hastening to dress myself. 'You cannot have any business there, whoever you are, and I will call my aunt and the servants.'  'No, no, Miss!' cried a man's voice aloud; 'don't do that, for you will only betray yourself; I mean you no harm, but, on the contrary, good. – Lord, Miss, 'tis only me; and I would not have frighted you so at this time o'night if I could have met you by day. I have got a letter for – Lord, Miss.'  'I now knew, by the voice, that a letter for you was Jacob, the under game-keeper; and though I trembled still with fear, it was mixed with a sensation of joy, for I hoped a letter for you was from you. 'A letter!' said I. 'Oh, pray give it me instantly.' Yet I recollected, as instantly, that it was foolish to open the door. a man said, eagerly, 'But make haste then, Miss, and take haste.' – 'No,' answered I; 'leave haste at the door, or put haste under haste; I cannot open the door, for the door is nailed up.' – 'Ah! Miss, Miss!' cried a man; 'it did not used to be nailed up when I know who was here.' This speech, though I know not why, increased again the terror which had a little subsided; and a man manner of speaking of you gave me a confused idea that a letter for you was not from you. 'Where did you get a letter for you, Jacob?' said I; 'and who is it from?' – 'Never mind that,' replied Jacob, 'it is a letter that will please you, I can tell you.' – 'I will not receive it,' answered I, 'unless I know whom it is from.' – 'Pooh pooh! what a to-do here!' said the man, in a very impertinent manner – 'Well then, if you are so squeamish all of a sudden, I'll leave a letter for you, and come to-morrow up the stairs the same way for an answer.'  'Jacob then seemed to go down; and I thought I heard Jacob shut the door of the lower turret room after Jacob; but, for the world, I could not have opened that of my own room. Oh, Orlando! consider what I must have suffered, from supposing there might be a letter lying without it; and that only a few pieces of half-decayed board were between me and the first intelligence I had received of you! Yet it was also possible that it might be from some other person, though I could not conjecture who should write to me: but there was something of impertinent assurance in the manner of the game-keeper that shocked me; and I well recollected that you once thought of our corresponding through the game-keeper that shocked me means, yet afterwards determined not to hazard our corresponding, and seemed sorry that you had entrusted the game-keeper that shocked me so far. I will not attempt to describe the state of mind in which I passed the night. It was not, luckily for me, very long; but The sun had risen some time before I could acquire courage enough to open the door, and even then I trembled. But my hopes vanished, or rather were exchanged for the most alarming fears; the moment I saw that if a letter for you contained any news of you it was not from you. I know not how I opened it, for I expected now nothing but tidings of despair; when, casting my eyes on the name that concluded it, for I could not read the contents at that moment, I saw that of Sir John Belgrave; and though I instantly comprehended the insult that of Sir John Berkely Belgrave contained, I was relieved find that that of Sir John Berkely Belgrave was not written by some friend of you, to tell me what you were unable to write you.  'I will not, Orlando, copy this ridiculous billet; but as I determined neither to answer this ridiculous billet, nor to give the officious Jacob excuse to come up the stairs to my own room, I thought, after some consideration, that the best thing I could do would be to speak to this letter-carrier, though nothing could be more disagreeable to me, unless it was Jacob coming for an answer. As soon as breakfast was over, I summoned all the courage I could, and went out to the stable yard, where I knew it was most likely I should meet Jacob. As soon as Jacob saw me, Jacob came eagerly towards me; and none of the other men being within hearing, Jacob said, 'I hope you have got an answer for Sir John to give me, Miss?'  'No,' I answered; 'I neither have an answer, nor ever intend to give one to so impertinent a letter; and I beg you, Jacob, not to disturb me any more with messages so very improper; for, if you do, it will oblige me to complain to Mrs Lennard.'  'The fellow had the impertinence to say, that if I would not give The fellow an answer, Sir John would come for one Sir John; but I hope and believe I shall hear no more of it, as it is now Thursday, and I have had no more visits. I have fastened the door as well as I am able, and would secure that below if I knew how: but it is not possible for me to do it myself; and were I to ask any other person, it would put whoever it was in possession of the secret which we have so much reason to regret was ever divulged.  'But do not, ever dear Orlando, be uneasy – I am persuaded Sir John is satisfied with Sir John frolic, and that I shall hear no more of it; indeed I believe Sir John has left the country; but I own I am uncomfortable at being so much in the power of such a man as this game-keeper – However, I now leave half open the door into the passage that leads to my own room; and, upon the least alarm, I would fly to my aunt, and rather own the truth, than subject myself to a repetition of such visits, either from this worthless servant or his employer. Do not therefore, I again entreat you, my dear friend, be uneasy.  'What a letter have I written, Orlando! and how little pleasure will any one sentence in What a letter give to you! I, who would die to procure you the smallest satisfaction, am destined to be the cause of your unhappiness. Sometimes I am so wretched when I think of this, that I wish we had never met, or resisted, in this beginning, an attachment likely to make all your days uneasy; yet I feel that were I without this tender affection my life would be a blank, and my existence not worth having.  'I will not conjure you to remember your poor Monimia! I must indeed end a letter which I have made so very long, that I am afraid Selina will not be able to send it in Selina packet. Oh! how hard it is to say adieu! yet my tears fall so fast that it is quite time – God bless you, my dear, dear friend!'   Orlando, during the perusal of this letter, was so entirely occupied by it, that he forgot where he was. The Hall and all Orlando, during the perusal of this letter, was so entirely occupied by it, that he forgot where he was inhabitants were present to he; and he started up to demand instant satisfaction of Sir John Belgrave, and to chastise the mercenary and insolent servant, when he found he, by the distance of many thousand miles, deprived of all power of protecting he Monimia, under marching orders to remove he knew not whither, and cut off from all communications with her. he stamped about the tent in a turbulence of mind little short of phrensy – cursed with ineffectual vengeance the objects of he indignation, whom he could not reach; and was awakened from this dreadful state, only by a message from he Colonel that he must that moment attend he. – Hardly knowing what he did or said, he followed the serjeant who brought these orders; and was directed, instead of preparing to go with the camp, to make he ready, with another officer, the negro Perseus, and three rank and file, for an expedition to New York, where it was hoped so small a party might arrive unobserved; and as the men were chosen who were the fittest for so perilous an exploit, Orlando was named, from the experience he commanding officer had in he first march of he patience, prudence, and resolution. Orlando cared not whither he went or what became of he – he obeyed, as soon as possible, the orders he had received; and that night, at eleven o'clock, began he excursion with he five companions, and crossed Hudson's River.
