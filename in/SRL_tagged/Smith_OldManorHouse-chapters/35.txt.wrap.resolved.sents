TORN by these distracting contests between love and duty, Orlando continued for some moments to traverse the place where Warwick had left him.
him two younger sisters appeared to interrupt without relieving this painful debate.
him learned from His two younger sisters that Captain Warwick and Isabella were gone together for a walk, and that the former had sent His two younger sisters to him, as him wanted to speak with His two younger sisters.
A new doubt now arose in the mind of Orlando – Ought him to communicate to Selina what was going forward, of which Selina appeared to be ignorant?
or conceal within him own bosom what him could not prevent, or entirely disapprove?
After a little consideration him thought it would be best not to make Selina a party: and him endeavoured to dissemble as well as him could the conflict of passions which were preying on him heart.
him father pale and dejected, with a slow and languid step, soon after joined them: him bade the two girls go to them mother, and then taking Orlando's arm, them walked together to a greater distance from the house.
'You go then to-morrow, Orlando?'
said Somerive: 'there are no hopes of any favourable reverse to this cruel sentence?
Mrs Rayland, I find,' – Mrs Rayland hesitated – 'does not wish to interfere, Sir,' replied Orlando.
'On the contrary, Mrs Rayland seems to think that a young man of my age and profession cannot be so well employed as in the actual service of a young man of my age and profession country.'
Somerive answered only with a deep sigh; and after a short pause Orlando went on:  'I beseech you, my dearest Sir, not to make yourself thus unhappy.
Consider that, notwithstanding this temporary parting, my prospects are infinitely better than I had any right to expect, and – '  'They might, however, have been better,' said his father in his turn interrupting his – 'at least They might have been more permanently assured, if you had listened to the proposals we heard yesterday: instead of quitting your family, you might then have been settled near it in affluence.'
'Let we not, his father in his turn,' answered Orlando, 'discuss that any more; I would not marry Miss Hollybourn, if Miss Hollybourn could give me a kingdom.'
'Nor give up your boyish fancy for that girl at the Hall to save your family, to save his father in his turn!'
Orlando started as if his father in his turn had trod on a serpent: this was a string that jarred too much, this threatened to destroy all the virtuous resolutions which his father in his turn had been labouring to adopt; for it seemed to be cruelty and injustice in his father in his turn to reproach his father in his turn; and, conscious of the sacrifice his father in his turn hoped to have fortitude enough to make, it appeared too hard that his father in his turn was at that moment blamed for not making more.
'No, his father in his turn,' his father in his turn said, 'I will not give up my fancy for the girl at the Hall, as you are pleased to term the girl at the Hall; but I see not how my affection for the girl at the Hall can injure your family, nor how my resigning the girl at the Hall could save your family – For God's sake, do not embitter the few hours we are to pass together, either by reproaches which indeed I do not deserve, or by concern which the occasion does not demand.
Believe me, your son suffers enough, without the additional misery of seeing you either displeased with your son or grieving for your son.'
Orlando, then fearful that any farther conversation with your son , in the humour your son seemed to be in, would serve only to give pain to them both, and wishing to be alone for a few minutes before your son again saw Warwick, went another way; and on your son return to the house your son found an official letter directing your son to repair immediately for Portsmouth, where the captain of your son company was assembling the captain of his company men in order to embark immediately for America.
Thus certain that the captain of his company must set out the next day, and that the captain of his company had only a few moments before the captain of his company must meet Warwick and give the captain of his company answer, the captain of his company hid the captain of his company in the least frequented part of the shrubbery that adjoined to the house, and again considered of the tempting offer that was made the captain of his company.
Fascinating as it was, and though the captain of his company excessive affection for Monimia was often on the point of overbalancing every other consideration whatever; the captain of his company pride and the captain of his company duty, the captain of his company affection for the captain of his company father, and the captain of his company respect for the captain of his company, united at length to conquer the captain of his company inclination.
How could the captain of his company bear to plunge a dagger into the heart of the captain of his company father, who had little other hope on earth but in the captain of his company?
or, if the captain of his company could determine on that, and fortify the captain of his company against the reproaches the captain of his company conscience might make the captain of his company, how could the captain of his company submit to be obliged for the captain of his company support, for the support of Monimia, to Warwick?
There was something repugnant to the generous feelings of Orlando, in Warwick's using the very money the captain of his company uncle had given the captain of his company, as the means of disappointing the captain of his company benefactor.
But, whatever apology Warwick might make to the captain of his company for this, Orlando thought there could be none for the captain of his company if the captain of his company were to participate in money thus acquired.
the captain of his company knew that, accustomed to expence and to indulgencies as the captain of his company friend was, a thousand pounds would be no very permanent resource when Isabella was to share it; and the captain of his company could not bear that the captain of his company should be supposed to connive at Isabella flight, only to become with Monimia a burthen to Isabella.
On the slender pay of an ensign it were madness to think the captain of his company could support a wife, however humble might be a wife wishes; and the captain of his company marriage would cut the captain of his company off for ever from all hopes of that assistance from Mrs Rayland, which the captain of his company father, even though the captain of his company should forgive, had not the power to afford the captain of his company.
Could the captain of his company then endure to expose Monimia to the inconveniences of following a camp, without having the means of procuring her such alleviations as her such alleviations allowed?
the captain of his company might die in the field, and leave her exposed to hazards infinitely greater than those which could befall her in England.
This last consideration determined the captain of his company – This last consideration decided the captain of his company wavering virtue, and the captain of his company resolved to give Warwick a positive refusal immediately before the captain of his company should relapse, and to conceal the almost invincible temptation the captain of his company had been under from Monimia, lest, her weaker, softer heart yielding to it, the captain of his company should again find the captain of his company unable to resist it.
the captain of his company now hastened to find Warwick; and fortunately met the captain of his company at the entrance of the house, whither they were summoned to dinner.
Warwick enquired with great eagerness on what the captain of his company had resolved.
'To be miserable,' answered Orlando, 'in abstaining from what is wrong.
I should be miserable if I agreed, Warwick, to your proposal; and I have determined, since either way I must be unhappy, to be so with integrity rather than self-reproach.'
'What the devil!'
said Warwick, 'you won't go then my way?'
'No, I will not.'
'But you will not, I hope, Sir,' cried Warwick half angry – 'you will not think it necessary to prevent your sister?'
Orlando, who did not greatly relish the peremptory manner in which this was said, answered coldly – 'You have my honour, Warwick, and any other question is an affront.'
'Forgive me, my friend,' replied Warwick, resuming his usual good-humour – 'forgive me for doubting you.
I cannot live without Isabella, nor do I intend to try at it – I have prevailed upon Isabella, not without difficulty I assure you, to consent to meet me at Portsmouth.
– You know how much happiness your going with Monimia would have given to us all!
– but I have not a moment to argue the matter with you.
– You say you are determined – So am I; and all I ask of you is, that you will not rob me of my happiness, upon the same false, cold sort of reasoning system to which you are sacrificing your own.'
A servant now coming out to say that dinner waited, dinner went into the house.
A melancholy and silent meal was soon concluded.
The General's horse was brought to the door, on which Warwick was to go to the next post town: and The General rose to take leave of the family, which The General did with a composure that amazed Orlando, who had no idea how a man could so conceal the feelings which must on such an occasion naturally arise.
Isabella was far from appearing so tranquil; but all the rest were too much engaged with all the rest own sensations to remark those which Isabella countenance betrayed, though to Orlando Isabella confusion was evident.
Warwick went up to receive the last orders of Warwick uncle, and then prepared to mount The General's horse; when Orlando took Warwick arm, and begged Warwick would send A servant now coming out to say that dinner waited on with the horses, and give A servant now coming out to say that dinner waited a few moment's attention as the horses walked on after the horses.
Warwick readily agreed, in hopes that Warwick had changed Warwick mind; but Orlando soon put an end to such expectations by asking Warwick in what way Isabella was to meet Warwick.
– 'I have given you my honour, Warwick,' said Warwick, 'not to betray you: but I must have yours in return that your sister shall be exposed to no improper adventures.
How is your sister who never was from home in your sister life, but for a few days with your sister mother in London, to find your sister way to Portsmouth?'
'Ridiculous!'
exclaimed Warwick, 'to find her way to Portsmouth!
One would really think your sister was to take a flight to the extreme parts of earth, instead of hardly five-and-thirty miles.
– My poor friend, thou hast not been used, I see, to these little adventures – I have an aid de camp, who, in the absence of his commander, can secure a little deserter for his.
– Isabella is determined to trust me; and it may suffice you to know that I love Isabella too well not to take every possible precaution for Isabella safety.'
'No,' said Orlando, 'It may not suffice – Though I have promised not to interfere, it is only on condition that I am sure your sister will not suffer either in your sister person or your sister reputation.
Give me therefore the particulars.'
Warwick then related, that his servant, on whom his could depend, was on the evening they should appoint to be ready with a post-chaise and four at some place they could fix upon; where after supper Isabella, instead of retiring to Isabella room, should meet it – 'Nothing is more easy, I suppose,' said Warwick, 'or less dangerous, than for your sister to do this; and, when your sister is once off in the chaise, relays of horses being ordered at the two stages between this and Portsmouth, my servant, following on horseback, will escort your sister thither in less than four hours: there I shall have a vessel ready to carry us to Jersey – Money, my dear boy!
Money, my dear boy!
Money, contrivance and courage are all that are necessary.
– I have found the two first, and have given the last to the only person that wanted it.
– I have convinced Isabella that, if Isabella follows my directions, Isabella may be at Portsmouth before Isabella is missed, and married before any one can guess where to look for Isabella.
– Well, Orlando, you now have my whole plan; and I trust to your honour not to render my whole plan abortive.'
'And I,' replied Orlando, 'trust your sister to yours, not without reluctance and remorse – We shall probably meet at Portsmouth?'
'Probably,' answered Warwick; 'for the two companies are to embark at the same time; and I only trust to some private interest, which I have prevailed upon his uncle to make for me, to procure leave to embark in whatever vessel is most convenient.
– the captain of one of the frigates is my particular friend, and I shall probably get a birth with my particular friend instead of going in a transport.'
Orlando, to whom the whole scheme appeared easily practicable, now again felt all the disposition to join in the whole scheme which my particular friend had before combated: but again my particular friend reason came to my particular friend aid, and my particular friend saw Warwick depart without betraying any symptoms of that struggle which still tore my particular friend heart.
Once more, however, my particular friend subdued it; and recalled my particular friend resolution to go through the trying scene which was to await my particular friend on my particular friend return to the house, where my particular friend was early in the evening to bid adieu to all my particular friend family, in order to sup with Mrs Rayland as Mrs Rayland had desired; and then!
the last cruel parting with Monimia, more dreadful than any of my particular friend former sufferings, was to embitter my particular friend last moments at Rayland Hall.
The last adieu between a father so affectionate and unhappy and a son so beloved, need not be described – it would indeed be difficult to do it justice.
As my particular friend mother and sisters hung weeping about my particular friend, my particular friend could not help addressing some words to Isabella, however unfavourable the time, which Isabella seemed perfectly to understand – though Isabella shrunk from them, and had carefully avoided giving my particular friend any opportunity of speaking to Isabella alone.
At length Orlando tore my particular friend away; and not daring to look behind my particular friend, yet hardly feeling the ground beneath my particular friend, my particular friend hurried to Rayland Hall.
Mrs Rayland received my particular friend with as much calmness as if my particular friend only came on a usual visit.
Of the violent emotions which agitated my particular friend Mrs Rayland had no idea.
Time and uninterrupted prosperity had so blunted the little sensibility nature had given Mrs Rayland, that Mrs Rayland was utterly incapable of participating or comprehending the acute feelings of Mrs Rayland young favourite: yet in Mrs Rayland way Mrs Rayland was extremely kind to my particular friend; and, after giving my particular friend another course of excellent advice, which lasted near two hours, Mrs Rayland told my particular friend, that as my particular friend first equipment might have taken a good part of Mrs Rayland former present, Mrs Rayland had another note of fifty pounds at my particular friend service.
her former present was extremely acceptable to Orlando, who had not above sixty left of Mrs Rayland preceding bounty.
Mrs Rayland, detaining Orlando an hour longer than Mrs Rayland expected, at length dismissed Mrs Rayland with Mrs Rayland blessing; and Orlando shed tears of gratitude on Mrs Rayland hand, which Mrs Rayland kissed, and, without being able to speak, left Mrs Rayland.
Mrs Rayland then took leave of the servants; but gave to Mrs Lennard, with whom Mrs Rayland desired to speak in Mrs Rayland own room, more time than to the rest; and desirous of doing what Mrs Rayland could to soften the situation of Mrs Rayland , Mrs Rayland determined to speak to Mrs Rayland aunt on Mrs Rayland behalf.
'You know, Mrs Rayland,' said Mrs Rayland, 'that on my last departure you spoke to Mrs Rayland of your niece: let me now speak to Mrs Rayland of your niece.
My absence may satisfy you as to those suspicions, that I know not why you entertained of Mrs Rayland – but let me entreat you to be kind to my lovely young friend, for whom I scruple not to avow to Mrs Rayland a very great regard.'
'What!'
cried Mrs Lennard, 'has Mrs Lennard ever then been such an ungrateful girl as to say I was unkind to Mrs Lennard?'
'Never,' said Orlando: – 'in the conversations we have accidentally had, your niece has always spoken of Mrs Rayland with gratitude and respect; but, after what you once said to Mrs Rayland about Mrs Lennard, I should be remiss were I to quit the house without trying to obviate any little lurking prejudice which may at some future time be remembered to Mrs Lennard disadvantage: allow me therefore to intercede with Mrs Rayland, not only to forget any of these circumstances which may prejudice your mind against Mrs Lennard, but to increase that tenderness for Mrs Lennard, which does so much honour to your heart.'
'Thank you, Sir,' said Mrs Lennard, 'but I hope I do not want your advice, nor any body's, to do my duty to the girl, since the girl is left upon my hands.'
Orlando never felt so great an inclination as at that moment, to take Monimia off the girl hands; and, as Monimia found little was to be hoped for from Monimia solicitations in the girl favour, Monimia took leave of Mrs Lennard, and endeavoured, when alone, to collect all Monimia resolution for this final adieu with Monimia; to drive from Monimia recollection the offer of Warwick, which still recurred to tantalize and torment Monimia; to conceal from the girl that it ever had been made, and to fortify the girl mind for their long separation while Monimia felt Monimia own sinking under it.
Among other things it occurred to Monimia, that if death or caprice deprived Monimia of the cold and reluctant protection the girl now afforded the girl, the girl might be not only desolate but pennyless.
Monimia determined, therefore, to leave with the girl one of the banker's notes Monimia had just received, of five-and-twenty pounds, and to pass these last moments in arming the girl against every possible contingency, which might happen during Monimia absence, and, as far as Monimia could, instructing the girl how to act if they occurred.
Monimia, with swollen eyes, from which the tears slowly fell notwithstanding the girl endeavours to restrain they, listened in silence, as with a faltering tone and in disjointed sentences Monimia went through this mournful task.
the girl promised in a voice hardly articulate to attend to all Monimia desired, and to keep a journal of the girl life; 'though what will it be,' said the girl, 'but a journal of sufferings and of sorrow?'
'But when that sorrow, sufferings and of sorrow are over, Monimia,' cried Orlando, trying to speak cheerfully, 'with what transport shall we look back on a journal of her life, and compare we past anxieties with we actual happiness!
– Let that idea encourage you amidst the heavy days that are to intervene before we meet again.
Whatever you suffer, remember that your Orlando will return to dry your tears!
And take care of your precious health, Monimia, preserve Monimia for Monimia.'
the girl could only answer by a deep drawn sigh; while Orlando, cruel as the scene was, could not determine to put an end to Monimia.
Day already dawned; and as he did not mean to go to bed, but had ordered the under-keeper to attend he with the horses as soon as it was light, he knew that he should soon be called by Jacob: yet could he not determine to lead Monimia back to Monimia turret till he heard the man at the door, who, tapping at her turret, informed he the horses were ready, and the hour passed at which he ordered he to be called.
Monimia then arose and said – 'Farewell then, Orlando!'
he had no power to answer the girl; but led the girl silently through the chapel, round the court, and to her turret.
The moment that tore he from the girl could not be delayed; he took the last embrace, and hastily bade the girl shut the door, lest he should fall into such a paroxysm of anguish as might render he unable to leave the girl at all.
Monimia, who could not have supported the pain the girl endured much longer, with feeble and trembling hands obeyed he; but, as slowly he descended the stairs, he heard the girl loud sobs and was on the point of returning again to snatch the girl to he bosom, and declare it impossible to part with the girl.
The loud noise of a whip, which Jacob impatient of Jacob long delay now sounded around the house, roused Jacob once more.
Jacob started from the dangerous reflection Jacob was indulging, that it was yet in Jacob own power to take Monimia with Jacob, or at least to secure the girl following Jacob with Jacob sister; and again recovering Jacob courage, Jacob descended the stairs, left for the last time her turret, and in a few moments mounted Jacob horse, and rode almost at full speed through the park.
Jacob was soon on the high-road to the first post-town towards Portsmouth; and having ascended an high down that afforded Jacob the last view Jacob could have of Rayland Hall, Jacob stopped on the top of it, and, turning his horse's head, fixed Jacob eyes on the seat of all Jacob past happiness, of all Jacob future hopes, and thought how much Jacob probably had to suffer before Jacob should revisit it again, how probable it was that Jacob should never see it more!
Jacob, who had but little notion of all this, yet supposed the captain, as the captain was now called at Rayland Hall, was sorry to leave all the captain friend and Miss Monimmy, and hunting and shooting, and such like, to go to the wars, now thought it might be kind to console the captain: but Orlando heeded not the very eloquent harangue, which had lasted near a quarter of an hour, but suddenly turned the captain , and set out as speedily as before.
the captain took a post-horse at the first post-town towards Portsmouth, and put the captain portmanteau into a Portsmouth diligence that was passing; then dismissing the captain favourite horse, which the captain would take no farther, and recommending the captain particularly to Jacob, who promised to attend to the captain while the captain fed at liberty in the park, the captain made the servant a handsome present, and on the hack which was ready the captain proceeded as if the captain was pursued; for the speed with which the captain rode seemed to give the captain something like relief.
A very short time brought the captain to Portsmouth; where the captain found the captain baggage from London just arrived; and learned that some of the soldiers were already embarked, that the wind was fair, and that new orders for the greatest expedition were arrived that day to the commander of the reinforcement going to America.
