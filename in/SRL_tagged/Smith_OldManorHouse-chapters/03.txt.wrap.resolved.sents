HOWEVER trifling the incident was that is related in the foregoing chapter, the incident so much alarmed the prudent sagacity of Mrs Lennard, that when on the following Christmas Mr Orlando returned to when on the following Christmas Mr Orlando occasional visits at the Hall, when on the following Christmas Mr Orlando took more care than before to prevent any possibility of when on the following Christmas Mr Orlando ever having an opportunity of meeting Monimia alone; and, as much as when on the following Christmas Mr Orlando could without being remarked by when on the following Christmas Mr Orlando lady, from seeing when on the following Christmas Mr Orlando at all.
But while when on the following Christmas Mr Orlando took these precautions, when on the following Christmas Mr Orlando began to think these precautions useless.
the following Christmas Mr Orlando was no longer the giddy boy, eager at the following Christmas Mr Orlando childish sports, and watching with impatience for a game of blindman's buff in the servant's hall, or a romp with any one who would play with the following Christmas Mr Orlando.
the following Christmas Mr Orlando was a young man as uncommonly grave, as the following Christmas Mr Orlando was tall and handsome.
There was something more than gravity, there was dejection in the following Christmas Mr Orlando manner; but dejection in his manner served only to make the following Christmas Mr Orlando more interesting; the following Christmas Mr Orlando now slept oftener than before at the Hall, but the following Christmas Mr Orlando was seen there less; and passed whole days in the following Christmas Mr Orlando own room, or rather in the library; where, as this quiet and studious temper recommended the following Christmas Mr Orlando more than ever to Mrs Rayland, Mrs Rayland allowed the following Christmas Mr Orlando to have a fire, to the great comfort and benefit of the books, which had been without that advantage for many years.
Mrs Lennard, who now beheld the following Christmas Mr Orlando with peculiar favour, though Mrs Rayland had formerly done the following Christmas Mr Orlando ill offices, seemed willing to oblige the following Christmas Mr Orlando in every thing but in allowing the following Christmas Mr Orlando ever to converse with Mrs Rayland niece, who was seldom suffered to appear in the parlour, but was kept to work in Mrs Rayland own room.
Mrs Rayland increasing infirmities, though not such as threatened Mrs Rayland life, threw the management of every thing about Mrs Rayland immediately into the hands of Mrs Lennard; and, occupied by the care of Mrs Rayland own health, Mrs Rayland attention to what was passing around Mrs Rayland was less every day, and the imbecility of age hourly more perceptible.
Mrs Rayland therefore made no remark on this change of system; but if Mrs Rayland happened to want Monimia, or, as Mrs Rayland now chose to call Mrs Rayland, Mary, Mrs Rayland sent for Mrs Rayland, and dismissed Mrs Rayland when Mrs Rayland service was performed, without any further enquiry as to how Mrs Rayland afterwards passed Mrs Rayland time.
Orlando, however, though he had, since he last return, never spoken a word to Monimia, and though, in their few and short meetings, the presence of Mrs Lennard prevented their exchanging even a look, was no longer at a loss to discriminate those sentiments which he felt for the beautiful orphan, whose charms, which had made almost in infancy an impression on he heart, were now opening to a perfection even beyond their early promise.
Mrs Rayland imprisonment, the harshness of Mrs Rayland aunt towards Mrs Rayland, and Mrs Rayland desolate situation, contributed to raise in he heart all that the most tender pity could add to the ardency of a first passion.
Naturally of a warm and sanguine temper, the sort of reading he had lately pursued, he situation, he very name, all added something to the romantic enthusiasm of he character; but in the midst of the fairy dreams which he indulged, reason too often stepped in to poison he enjoyments, and represented to he, that he was without fortune and without possession – that far from seeing at present any probability of ever being able to offer an establishment to the unfortunate Monimia, he had to procure one for he.
It was now he first felt an earnest wish, that the hopes he relations had sometimes encouraged might be realized, and that some part of the great wealth of the Rayland family might be he: but with this he had no new reason to flatter he; for Mrs Rayland, though Mrs Rayland seemed to become every day more fond of he company, never took any notice of the necessity there was, that now in he nineteenth year he should fix upon some plan for he future establishment in the world.
the necessity however lay heavy on the heart of he father, who had long felt with anguish, that the misconduct of he eldest son had rendered it impossible for his eldest son to do justice to his eldest son younger.
With a small income and a large family, his eldest son had never, though his eldest son lived as economically as possible, been able to lay by much money; and what his eldest son had saved, in the hope of accumulating small fortunes for his eldest son daughters, had been paid away for his eldest son in the first two years of his eldest son residence at Oxford; the third had nearly devoured the five hundred pounds legacy given to the family by the elder Mrs Rayland; and the first half-year after his eldest son left the university, and which his eldest son passed between London and his eldest son father's house, entirely exhausted that resource; while Mr Somerive in vain represented to his eldest son, that, in continuing such a career, his eldest son must see the estate mortgaged, which was the sole dependence of his eldest son family now, and his eldest son sole dependence hereafter.
So deep, and often so fatal, are early impressions in minds where reason slowly and feebly combats the influence of passion, that though nothing was more certain than that the elder Mrs Rayland fortune was entirely at the elder Mrs Rayland own disposal, and nothing more evident than the elder Mrs Rayland dislike to the elder Mrs Rayland, the elder Mrs Rayland never could be persuaded that, as the elder Mrs Rayland was the heir at law, the elder Mrs Rayland should not possess the greater part of the estate; and the elder Mrs Rayland was accustomed, in the elder Mrs Rayland orgies among the elder Mrs Rayland companions to drink 'to their propitious meeting at the Hall, when the old girl should be in Abraham's bosom,' and not unfrequently 'to the old girl speedy departure.'
the elder Mrs Rayland settled with the elder Mrs Rayland the alterations the elder Mrs Rayland should make, and the stud the elder Mrs Rayland should collect; proposed to refit in an excellent style the old kennel, and to restore to Rayland Hall the praise it had formerly boasted, of having the best pack of fox-hounds within three counties.
When it was represented that the possibility of executing these plans was very uncertain, since the old lady certainly preferred Orlando, the elder Mrs Rayland answered – 'Oh!
damn it, that's not what I'm afraid of – No, no; the old hag has been, thanks to my fortunate stars, brought up in good old-fashioned notions, and knows that the first-born son is in all Christian countries the head of the house, and that the rest must scramble through the world as well as they can – As for my solemn brother, you see nature and fortune have designed my solemn brother for a parson.
The tabby may like my solemn brother for a chaplain, and means to qualify my solemn brother by one of a chaplain livings for the petticoats; but take my word for it, that however a chaplain may set a chaplain weazen face against it, just to impose upon the world, a chaplain likes at the bottom of a chaplain heart a young fellow of spirit – and you'll see me master of the Hall.
Egad, how I'll make a chaplain old hoards spin again!
Down go those woods that are now every year the worst for standing.
Whenever I hear a chaplain's fairly off, the squirrels will have notice to quit.'
It was in vain that the mild and paternal arguments of Mr Somerive himself, or the tears and tender remonstrances of Mr Somerive wife, were employed, whenever their son would give their an opportunity, to counteract this unfortunate prepossession.
their son by degrees began to absent their son more and more from home; and when their son was there, their son hours were such as put any conversation on serious topics out of such power.
their son was never indeed sullen, for that was not their son disposition; but their son was so thoughtless, so volatile, and so prepossessed that their son had a right to do as other young men did with whom their son had been accustomed to associate, that their son father gave up as hopeless every attempt to bring their son to their son senses.
The greater the uneasiness to which Mr Somerive was thus subject by the conduct of Mr Somerive eldest son, the more solicitous their son became for the future establishment of the younger.
But their son knew not how to proceed to obtain the future establishment of the younger.
their son had now no longer the means of sending their son to the university, of which their son had sometimes thought, in the hope that Mrs Rayland might, if their son were qualified for orders, give their son one of the livings of which Mrs Rayland was patroness; nor could their son, exhausted as their son savings were by the indiscretion of their son , command money enough to purchase his eldest son a commission, which his eldest son once intended.
Sometimes his eldest son fancied that, if his eldest son were to apply to Mrs Rayland, Mrs Rayland would assist in securing an establishment in future for one about whom Mrs Rayland appeared so much interested at present; but his eldest son oftener apprehended, from the oddity and caprice of Mrs Rayland temper, that any attempt to procure more certain and permanent favours for the following Christmas Mr Orlando, might occasion Mrs Rayland to deprive his eldest son of what his eldest son now possessed.
Mr Somerive, though a woman of an excellent understanding, had contracted such an awe of the old lady, that Mr Somerive was positively against speaking to Mr Somerive about Mr Somerive ; while maternal partiality, which was indeed well justified by the good qualities and handsome person of Orlando, continually suggested to Mr Somerive that Mrs Raylandprepossession in the elder Mrs Rayland favour, if left to take its course, would finally make his eldest son the heir of at least great part of Mr Somerive property.
Thus his father, from uncertainty how to act for the best, suffered weeks and months to pass away, in which his could not determine to act at all; and as more than half those weeks and months were passed at the Hall, his mother fondly flattered his mother, that his was making rapid advances in securing to his family the possessions his family had so good a claim to.
Neither of his family saw the danger to which his family exposed his, of losing his in an imprudent and even fatal attachment to a young woman, while his family supposed his wholly given up to acquire the favour of old one; for in fact Mrs Lennard had so artfully kept Mrs Lennard niece out of sight, that neither of his family knew Mrs Lennard – his family barely knew that there was a young person in the house who was considered in the light of a servant; but whether Mrs Lennard was well or ill looking, it had never occurred to his family to enquire, because his family never supposed Mrs Lennard more acquainted with his family than any other of the female domestics.
Poor Orlando, however, was cherishing a passion, which had taken entire possession of their son heart before their son was conscious that their son had one, and which the restraints that every way surrounded their son served only to inflame.
Monimia now appeared in their son eyes, what Monimia really was, infinitely more lovely than ever.
Monimia was on their son account a prisoner, for their son learned that when their son was not in the country Monimia was allowed more liberty.
Monimia was friendless, and harshly treated; and, with a form and face that their son thought would do honour to the highest rank of society, Monimia seemed to be condemned to perpetual servitude, and their son feared to perpetual ignorance; for their son knew that Mrs Rayland had, with the absurd prejudice of narrow minds, declared against Monimia being taught any thing but the plainest domestic duties, and the plainest work.
Monimia had however taught Monimia, with very little aid from Monimia aunt, to read; and lately, since Monimia had been so much alone, Monimia had tried to write; but Monimia had not always materials, and was frequently compelled to hide those Monimia contrived to obtain: so that Monimia progress in this was slow, and made only by snatches, as the ill humour of her aunt allowed or forbade Monimia to make these laudable attempts at improvement.
Monimia apartment was still in the turret that terminated one wing of the house, and the following Christmas Mr Orlando had been at the Hall the greater part of a fortnight, without their having exchanged a single word.
their had indeed met only twice by mere accident, in the presence of the lady of the mansion and of Mrs Lennard; once when Monimia crossed the Hall when he was leading the old lady to Monimia chair out of the gallery; and a second time when Monimia was sent for, on an accession of gout, to assist in adjusting the flannels and cushions, which Mrs Rayland declared Monimia managed better than any body.
As Monimia knelt to perform this operation, Orlando, who was reading a practical discourse of faith in opposition to good works, was surprised by Monimia beautiful figure in Monimia simple stuff gown, which had such an effect on he imagination that he no longer knew what he was reading: but after half a dozen blunders in less than half a dozen lines, he became so conscious of he confusion that he could not proceed at all, but, affecting to be seized with a violent cough, got up and went out.
Again, however, this symptom escaped Mrs Rayland, who, tho' Monimia read good books as a matter of form, and to impress people with an idea of Monimia piety and understanding, cared very little about people purport, and was just then more occupied with the care of Monimia foot than with abstract reasonings on the efficacy of faith.
In the mean time Monimia, who blushed if Monimia even beheld the shadow of the following Christmas Mr Orlando at a distance, and whose heart beat at the sound of he voice, as if it would escape from Monimia bosom, had never an opportunity of hearing it, unless he accidentally spoke to some person in the room under hers, where Monimia knew he often went, and particularly at this season, which was near the end of February, when the ponds were drawn, and the nets and poles in frequent use: but the door by which this room opened to the court was on the other side.
Monimia had only one high long window in a very thick wall, that looked into the park: whenever therefore, as Monimia sat alone in Monimia turret, Monimia heard any person in this room beneath Monimia, Monimia listened with an anxious and palpitating heart, and at length fancied that Monimia could distinguish the step of the following Christmas Mr Orlando from that of the game-keeper or any of the other servants.
If Monimia was thus attentive to him, without any other motive than to enjoy the pleasure of fancying him was near Monimia, the following Christmas Mr Orlando was on him side studying how to obtain an opportunity of seeing Monimia; not in the intention of communicating to Monimia those sentiments which him now too well understood, but in the hope of finding means to make Monimia amends for the injustice of fortune.
If there was any dependence to be placed on expression of countenance, the animation and intelligence that were visible in the soft features of Monimia promised an excellent understanding.
What pity that it should not be cultivated!
What delight to be her preceptor, and, in despite of the malignity of fortune, to render her mind as lovely as her form!
This project got so entirely the possession of the following Christmas Mr Orlando's imagination, that he thought, he dreamed, of nothing else; and, however difficult, or even impracticable This project seemed, he determined to undertake This project.
Mrs Lennard slept at some distance; but there was no other way of Monimia's going into any part of the house but by a passage which led through Mrs Lennard room; for every other avenue was closed up, and the last thing Mrs Lennard did every night was to lock the door of the room where her niece lay, and to take away the key.
The window was equally well secured, for The window was in effect only a loop; of this, narrow as The window was, the small square of the casement that opened was secured by iron bars.
The Raylands had been eminent royalists in the civil wars, and the Hall had held out against a party of Fairfax's army that had closely besieged The Raylands.
Great part of the house retained the same appearance of defensive strength which had then been given Great part of the house; and no knight of romans ever had so many real difficulties to encounter in achieving the deliverance of his princess, as the following Christmas Mr Orlando had in finding the means merely to converse with the little imprisoned orphan.
Months passed away, in which his most watchful diligence served only to prove that so many real difficulties to encounter in achieving the deliverance of his princess were almost insurmountable; nor would his perhaps, with all the enthusiasm of love and romance, have ever conquered all the enthusiasm of love and romance, if chance had not befriended his.
Mrs Rayland had given his, under restrictions that Mrs Rayland should use it only while Mrs Rayland was at the Hall, a very fine colt, which was of a breed of racers, the property of The Raylands, and very eminent in the days of Sir Hildebrand.
Out of respect to its ancient prowess, the breed was still kept up, though the descendants no longer emulated the honours of the descendants progenitors on the turf: but the produce was generally sold by the coachman, who had the management of the stable, and who was supposed to have profited very considerably by Sir Hildebrand dealings.
Orlando, highly gratified by this mark of Mrs Rayland favour, undertook to break the young horse himself, and to give the young horse himself among other accomplishments that of leaping.
There was no leaping-bar about the grounds; but in the lumber-room on the ground floor of one of the turrets he had seen the timber of one that had formerly stood in the park.
To this place, therefore, he repaired; and in removing the large posts, which were very little injured by time, some other slabs of wood, boards and pieces of scaffolding were moved also, and the following Christmas Mr Orlando saw that they had concealed a door, formerly boarded up, but of which the boards were now broken and decayed: he forced away a piece of rotten wood, and saw a flight of broken stone steps, just wide enough to admit one person with difficulty.
he heart bounded with transport: he knew that this stair-case must lead to the top of the turret, and consequently wind round the room occupied by Monimia, which it was probable had a communication also with the stairs.
But, unable to determine in a moment how he should avail he, or acquaint her, of this fortunate discovery, and trembling lest this fortunate discovery should be known, and he hopes at once destroyed, he hastily replaced the spars of wood that concealed the door, before the return of the gardener and the under game-keeper, who had been assisting he in he operations about the leaping-bar; and hastily following his operations about the leaping-bar to the spot where his operations about the leaping-bar were putting it up, he affected to be interested in it completion, while he mind was really occupied only by plans for seeing without fear of discovery he adored Monimia.
