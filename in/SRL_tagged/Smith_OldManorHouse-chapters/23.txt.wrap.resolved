ORLANDO found Monimia alarmed and dejected; but hardly giving ORLANDO time to re-assure her, and account for ORLANDO long absence, ORLANDO besought her to hasten to her room – 'I hope,' said ORLANDO, 'and believe the house is quite uninhabited on this side still, for all the servants are in the hall. My brother is missing, and I have promised my father to find My brother and conduct My brother home. What a task! for I know not where to look for My brother: not a moment must be lost, since my family are in such cruel alarms. However, I will wait here, my Monimia, till I think you are safe in your turret, and then set out – I know not whither – on this search.'  Monimia hastened to do as Monimia desired. 'But is Betty,' said Betty, 'in the hall? I have reasons, which I have not now time to explain, for believing they are together.' 'I know not,' answered Orlando, whose fears every moment increased; 'I care not what happens if you are but once in safety.'  Monimia then with light and timid steps passed through the adjoining parlour. Monimia found all that end of the house deserted, and regained the long passage which led from Monimia turret to the apartment of Monimia aunt. All was quiet; and Monimia flattered Monimia that Mrs Lennard, occupied by the attention necessary to be shewn to the guests, had for once omitted the ceremony of locking the doors of that part of the house, and particularly Monimia, at the usual hour. In this hope Monimia tripped along the long passage which led from her turret to the apartment of her aunt, and had just reached the door of Monimia own room, when Mrs Lennard, with a candle in Monimia hand, appeared at all that end of the house deserted. There was no hope of escape – Monimia stood trembling, unable to open the lock, which Monimia held in her hand; while Monimia aunt with a hasty step and an angry countenance advanced towards Monimia – 'Hey-day, Madam!' cried Mrs Lennard, 'pray, what makes you here? so dressed too, I assure you! I thought I had ordered you not to leave your room. Pr'ythee, Miss, where have you been? and how have you dared to disobey my orders?'  'her aunt,' cried the affrighted Monimia, in a voice almost inarticulate through fear – 'her aunt! be not so very angry – Every year till now you were so good as to give me leave to go into the hall-gallery to look at the dancers for a quarter of an hour. I dressed myself in hopes that some time in the evening I should see you to ask leave – it grew very late, you did not come to your room, and so – '  'And so, hussey, you left it without, did you?' – Monimia, unwilling to advance another direct falsehood, remained silent; and Mrs Lennard, fixing Mrs Lennard fierce enquiring eyes upon Mrs Lennard, said sternly, 'Monimia, there is something in your conduct which I do not understand – I suspect that you are a very wicked girl – I have had hints given me more than once, that you are imposing upon myself, and ruining yourself.'  'How can I impose upon yourself, Madam?' said Monimia, who, believing the crisis of Mrs Lennard fate was now approaching, tried to collect a little spirit – 'How can I impose upon you? Do you not always confine me to your room, and have I any means of leaving it without your consent?'  'That is what I am determined to discover,' cried Mrs Lennard – (Monimia became paler than before) – 'You have a false key, or you have some other means of getting out – However, it is not at present a time to enquire into this. Go now, Madam, to your room, and to your bed. Having seen you here is enough to convince me, that the intelligence I have had given me is not without grounds. Come, Miss, as you may perhaps choose to set out again – if you have, as I suspect, the means of opening the door – I shall wait here till you are in bed, and take away the candle.'  Monimia, who dreaded nothing so much as that Orlando might ascend the secret stairs, in order to enquire if she was safe, while she aunt was yet with she, hastened to undress her aunt; and as her aunt feared that, if all were silent in her aunt room, Orlando might speak without the door, which would inevitably discover '  Monimia, who dreaded nothing so much as that Orlando might ascend the secret stairs, in order to enquire if she was safe, while her aunt was yet with her at once, her aunt wished, for the first time in her aunt life, that the copious stream of eloquence with which the pleasure of scolding always supplied Mrs Lennard might now continue in full force – her aunt therefore contrived to say something which her aunt imagined would produce this, and her aunt succeeded. Provoked at Monimia's attempt to excuse or defend her aunt, and impatient at being kept from the party below, in which her aunt considered her aunt, now that her aunt lady and the guests were withdrawn, as the first figure, Mrs Lennard spared not Mrs Lennard lungs, nor was Mrs Lennard very nice in the choice of those epithets which most forcibly expressed Mrs Lennard anger against Mrs Lennard niece. In the midst of this harangue, Orlando, impatient to know whether Monimia was safe, and unable to set out in search of Monimia brother till Monimia had obtained this satisfaction, softly ascended the narrow stairs, and in a moment was convinced that all their escapes, during this perilous evening, had ended in a complete discovery of their intelligence; for to nothing less could Monimia impute the fury in which Mrs Lennard appeared to be. Under this impression, Monimia spirits and temper quite exhausted by the various perverse accidents that had within a few hours befallen Monimia – irritated by frequent disappointment, and indignant at the insults to which Monimia believed Monimia was at the moment exposed, Monimia was on the point of bursting into the room, declaring Monimia affection for her, and meeting at once the invectives of her aunt, the renunciation of all Monimia hopes from Mrs Rayland, and the displeasure of Monimia own family. Monimia blamed Monimia for not having before taken a step which, whatever might be its future consequence, would at least be decisive, and save Monimia from those cruel alarms and distressing conflicts to which Monimia love had so long made Monimia liable. But at the moment that Monimia hand was lifted to execute this rash purpose, the storm within seemed to abate: Monimia heard Mrs Lennard say – 'I assure you, that the very next time I see or hear the least grounds for believing you are carrying on such a correspondence, that day shall be the last of your stay under this roof.' This gave Orlando hope that Orlando might not be absolutely discovered; and at the same moment the idea of Monimia father made more unhappy, and deploring the fate that gave Monimia two sons equally careless of Orlando duty – of Monimia beloved and affectionate mother weeping at the disobedience of Monimia children – arose forcibly to check Monimia precipitate resolution. Monimia hesitated; Monimia listened; Mrs Lennard spoke lower, but still in a tone of remonstrance and reproach. Monimia determined to wait to speak to Monimia after Monimia departure, but Monimia seemed not likely to depart; and as Monimia attentively listened to what Monimia could not now very exactly distinguish, the terms in which Monimia expressed Monimia indignation, Monimia heard several voices calling Monimia in the park. This was a new alarm – To issue from the lower part of the turret at such an hour, when it was impossible Monimia could have any business there, was not to be thought of: yet the door was not closed, and Monimia believed the door was improbable that the people who were Monimia apprehended in search of Monimia brother, might at length seek Monimia there; as Monimia intoxication, when Monimia was missing, might lead the people who were he apprehended in search of his brother, might at length seek him there to imagine that Monimia might have gone into some of the buildings and have fallen asleep. Monimia descended therefore, and waited at the door. several voices calling him in the park were now at a distance; and apparently being near the apartment of Mrs Rayland, the persons who had before called aloud were afraid of disturbing Mrs Rayland. Monimia seized this opportunity of escaping; and, following the sound, which was still heard at intervals, Monimia met at length the groom and the under footman, who told Monimia that Mr Philip Somerive had returned about a quarter of an hour before into the room, where Monimia was now so extremely riotous that Monimia had got into a quarrel with one of the young farmers; that Monimia had stripped to box; and that every interposition of theirs only served to enrage Monimia more. theirs therefore besought Orlando to return into the Hall, that Monimia might appease and prevail upon Monimia brother to go home; for that theirs Lady, already alarmed by the noise, had sent down orders to have the house immediately shut up, and for the people to depart. A thousand times during the course of this evening had poor Orlando execrated his own folly, that had thus brought his into an house, where, while his had been such an unceasing torment to his, his had probably effectually ruined his. But there was now not a moment to give way to these repentant reflections. his hastened therefore into the room, where his , awakened from the stupor of drunkenness into its most extravagant phrensy, had taken some offence at a young man of the company, and was now withheld only by the united strength of three stout farmers from fighting. Orlando for some time argued and implored in vain. The fury of Philip only changed The fury of Philip object, and was directed against Philip. But with Philip opponent, whose blunt English spirit was not, as Philip declared, 'at all disposed to yield tamely to the insults of any 'squire, no not the biggest 'squire in the king's dominions,' the cool reasoning of Orlando had more effect. Philip soothed then this justly offended rustic, and, promising that Philip should hereafter acknowledge the impropriety of Philip behaviour, Philip prevailed on Philip to depart with Pattenson and some other of the men into another room; and then Philip being almost exhausted, and relapsing again into stupidity, Orlando wished to conduct his brother home. This was however, on consideration, found to be impossible; for Philip was equally unable to ride or walk, even with the assistance which Orlando was very ready to lend Philip. In this dilemma nothing remained but to put Philip into Philip own bed; where being at a great distance from Mrs Rayland, there was no probability of Mrs Rayland knowing the state to which Philip intemperance had reduced Philip. This then Philip determined to do. Pattenson and a party of the men who were in habits of drinking had already withdrawn: the women were huddling away to the women respective homes; and Orlando, with the help of the groom, carried off the almost senseless Philip to Philip own bed-chamber, where Philip left Philip on his own bed; and then, harassed and unhappy as Philip was, fatigued with all that had happened, and torn to pieces with anxiety about Monimia, Philip yet had another task to perform, which Philip felt, however painful, to be necessary – and this was, to walk to West Wolverton, that, by Philip account of Philip, Philip might quiet the fears of Philip as to Philip personal safety.  Philip arrived there, quite worn out with uneasiness; and the pale countenance and dishevelled hair with which Philip entered the parlour, seemed to confirm all the fears with which Mr Philip Somerive had been tormented on account of Somerive eldest son. Philip found his eldest son walking backwards and forwards in the parlour, listening to every noise; and Philip had passed the whole interval in this manner, except that Philip had now and then gone up stairs to Philip wife, whom Philip had prevailed upon to go to bed, to persuade her to mitigate those fears under which Philip himself agonized. At this juncture the appearance of Orlando, whose looks seemed to speak only of some sad catastrophe, deprived Philip for a moment of the power of asking what intelligence his father brought; and when Philip could speak, it was only to say! 'Orlando! your brother?' – 'his father is safe, dear Sir,' answered Orlando; 'pray be not thus alarmed.' 'Relate then,' cried Mr Philip Somerive in an eager voice, 'relate where Mr Philip Somerive is – wretched boy!' – 'Indeed, dear Sir,' said Orlando extremely shocked at the look and manner of dear Sir , 'you consider this matter more seriously than it deserves, and are more alarmed than the occasion seems to require.' dear Sir then related what had happened, softening however dear Sir 's folly as much as dear Sir could; and assured dear Sir that dear Sir would take care Philip should return in the morning, and that Mrs Rayland should be kept ignorant of the confusion Mrs Rayland intemperance had occasioned.  'You are a noble and excellent creature, Orlando,' cried Mr Philip Somerive, with a sigh as if Philip heart would break; 'but God knows what will become of his brother. This relapse into debauchery, so degrading, awakens all my fears – fears, which a little subsided on Philip unexpected return home. But it is not an hour, – wretched boy, to detain you with the misery that I see awaits us all. Since you have given up your bed to Philip, I desire you will take one here, while I hasten to quiet the anxiety which has almost overcome your poor mother, who imagined nothing less than that his eldest son was drowned, or that some other horrid calamity had befallen his eldest son.'  Mr Philip Somerive then departed; and Orlando, though somewhat comforted by having the power to relieve the sad solicitude of Mr Philip Somerive parents, was infinitely too uneasy to feel any inclination to sleep, though Mr Philip Somerive was so greatly fatigued. It was by this time day-light; and, after some reflection, Mr Philip Somerive resolved to return back to the Hall, and to await in the library the hour when Mr Philip Somerive should be delivered from the unwelcome inmate whom Mr Philip Somerive had been compelled to admit. Every other anxiety however that assailed Mr Philip Somerive was unfelt, when Mr Philip Somerive thought of the situation in which Mr Philip Somerive had left Monimia. The harsh tones in which the threats of Mrs Lennard were delivered still rung in Mrs Lennard ears; and Mrs Lennard fancy represented the lovely victim of Mrs Lennard ill humour drowned in tears, yielding to despair, and perhaps recollecting with anguish and regret the moments Mrs Lennard had given to Mrs Lennard importunate love. It was broad day by the time Mrs Lennard returned to the Hall, and the workmen and gardeners were dispersed about the house. Mrs Lennard dared not therefore indulge Mrs Lennard with another visit to the turret; but having with some difficulty obtained admittance from the tired and sleepy servants, Mrs Lennard wrapped Mrs Lennard in Mrs Lennard great coat, and sat down in the Study, where Mrs Lennard easily discovered, by the loud snoring from the adjoining room, that Philip was sleeping away the effects of the powerful draughts of the preceding night. Orlando, half tempted to envy the state of forgetfulness into which Mrs Lennard had fallen, occupied Mrs Lennard in reflecting on the strange and perverse accidents of the evening, in which Mrs Lennard and Monimia had trembled so often on the brink of discovery – perhaps were discovered, just at the time when they had flattered they with the hope that they might the more securely meet. Mrs Lennard revolved all that was likely to happen if Mrs Lennard was really acquainted with they correspondence; and hesitated not to resolve, in that case, to go to his father, to declare Mrs Lennard affection for Monimia, and to rescue Mrs Lennard from the tyranny of Mrs Lennard aunt, whatever might ensue. On the other hand, if they acquaintance yet remained doubtful, or only suspected, their acquaintance saw that prudence and duty, their acquaintance tenderness for Monimia, and their acquaintance affection for their acquaintance , equally dictated their present separation; and that, to whichever of these their acquaintance listened, their agreed in pointing out their acquaintance leaving Monimia now, to acquire some establishment which might give their at least a probability, without the breach of any duty, of being happily united hereafter. There was something humiliating to his ingenuous mind, in all the arts and prevarications which their clandestine correspondence compelled his to use his, and to teach the innocent Monimia. A thousand times his wished that his had been born the son of a day-labourer; that his parents, entertaining for his no views of ambition, had left his to pursue his own inclinations. A thousand times his lamented that Monimia was not circumstanced like Miss Hollybourn, that his might openly have addressed her: and the image of the arrogant heiress arose with redoubled disgust to his mind, when his compared the arrogant heiress situation with that of his desolate, orphan'd Monimia. More than three hours passed away while these thoughts were fluctuating in his mind. At the end of that time his was aroused by the entrance of Betty, who pertly demanded if his did not choose any breakfast?  his desired to have it brought. To which the girl replied, 'Perhaps you had rather breakfast with the old women?' – 'Whom do you mean?' enquired Orlando.  'Mean!' answered the girl; 'why, who should I mean, but mistress, and mother Lennard? There's no other old woman in the house as I knows on, nor there had not need. They've been enquiring after you.'  'After you?'  'Yes,' replied Betty. 'And Madam I suppose will tie you on to the girl apron-string soon, for the girl is never easy without you. Upon my word, Orlando, you look a little rakish though, I think, for such a sober young gentleman, and considering too that you did not demean yourself with dancing as you used to do with us servants, after the gentlefolks were gone. I warrant however that you did not pass the time at prayers.'  'You give your tongue strange license,' said Orlando, who endeavoured to conceal his vexation, for his imagined that all alluded to Monimia. 'However, do tell me, if Mrs Rayland wishes me to breakfast with Mrs Rayland?'  'I knows nothing about Mrs Rayland wishes,' replied the girl; 'I only knows that Mrs Lennard have been asking every servant in the house about you, and cross-questioning one so that I suppose the girl thoft I had got you locked up in my cupboard, as they say the girl used for to have the menfolk in the girl younger days in the housekeeper's store-room. The old woman and the oven for that! Set a thief to catch a thief!'  'I do desire,' said Orlando, 'that you would have done with all this, and tell me whether Mrs Lennard expects me at breakfast? However,' added Mrs Lennard, pausing, 'I will alter my dress, and wait upon my dress at all events; and do be so good as to prepare in the mean time some breakfast for his brother.'  Betty then left apparently with pleasure to execute this last commission; and Orlando, after changing Mrs Lennard clothes, went to Mrs Lennard room, to enquire whether Mrs Rayland wished to speak to Mrs Rayland, and at what time Mrs Rayland might wait upon Mrs Rayland. This however was not Mrs Rayland only motive; Mrs Rayland thought Mrs Rayland should immediately discern by Mrs Lennard reception of Mrs Rayland, whether Mrs Rayland fears of a partial or an entire discovery were well founded. Mrs Rayland fortunately found Mrs Lennard in the housekeeper's room; and, accosting Mrs Lennard with Mrs Rayland usual interesting address, Mrs Rayland enquired how Mrs Rayland did after the fatigues of the evening, how Mrs Lennard was Mrs Lennard, and whether Mrs Rayland might at any time that morning make a personal enquiry after Mrs Rayland?  The sage housekeeper received The sage housekeeper civilities with great coldness, and answered, even with some asperity, that Mrs Rayland was much better than ever Mrs Rayland could have expected after so much company. 'As to your enquiry after Mrs Rayland, dear Sir,' added Mrs Rayland, 'I don't know indeed how that may be; perhaps (fixing on dear Sir Mrs Rayland penetrating eyes) there are other people in the house after whom you would rather ask.'  Orlando, whose conscious blood rose into dear Sir cheeks at this speech, felt Orlando, whose conscious blood rose into his cheeks at this speech glow, and the sensation increased dear Sir confusion. 'No,' replied dear Sir, hesitating. 'No, certainly you cannot . . . suppose . . . that there is any body . . . that I . . . that I wish to enquire after more than Mrs Rayland . . . I was much afraid that the fatigue would be too much for Mrs Rayland.'  'There are other people,' replied Mrs Rayland, 'who were fatigued also. I must beg the favour of you, Orlando, not to interfere with my niece. I suppose it was by your desire or contrivance that my niece took the liberty of leaving my niece room last night, contrary to my positive orders.'  Orlando, a little recovered from his consternation, endeavoured to laugh this off, and was proving to Mrs Lennard that it was impossible for his to have occasioned this disobedience, when a summons came for Mrs Lennard to attend Mrs Rayland; and 'I was ordered, dear Sir,' said the footman, 'to desire you would come up also, if you were about the house.'  Mrs Lennard now stalked away with great dignity, and Orlando followed Mrs Lennard, more than ever alarmed for Monimia.
