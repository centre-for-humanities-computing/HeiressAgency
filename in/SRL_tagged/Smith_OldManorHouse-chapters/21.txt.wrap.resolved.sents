AT length Mrs Rayland was seated at the upper end of the hall, near the fire – the General placed Mrs Rayland by Mrs Rayland, and the Doctor strutted round Mrs Rayland – the other ladies were opposite; and the dance began.
Poor Orlando, whose heart beat not responsive to the music, made, however, an effort to conceal his vexation.
his partner, who had learned for many years of the most celebrated master, exerted all her knowledge of the art, and displayed all her graces to attract his; while his, hardly conscious of her existence, proceeded mechanically in the dance; and so little penetration had the spectators, that his absence, or distaste to what his was about, was wholly unperceived, while Mrs Rayland could not help observing to the Doctor how well Orlando performed – 'Is his not, said her, ' a fine young man?'
'Indeed his is, her,' replied the Doctor, who had now the opening his so long wished for; 'a very fine young man, I think;' and his became an inch higher as his spoke.
'I think indeed that this island produces not a finer couple than your kinsman, Madam, and the daughter of your humble servant.'
Mrs Rayland, who loved not female beauty whether real or imaginary, did not so warmly assent to this as the Doctor expected; who, not discouraged, squatted his down in the place the General had that moment vacated (who could not forbear walking after Isabella down the dance), and thus proceeded:  'I assure you, her, I have often spoken most highly in praise of your sagacity and discernment in electing the young Orlando as your favourite and protegé.
his is a fine young man – good, prudent and sensible; and, I am sure, grateful for your bounty.
I dare say that his will do well; for, under your auspices, there are few men even of consideration and fortune, who having daughters, would not be proud of an alliance with his.'
Mrs Rayland answered rather coldly, 'I believe Orlando has no thoughts of marrying.
– Orlando is yet too young.'
'Orlando is young, to be sure, her; but, for my own part, I must observe, that early marriages founded, as no doubt Orlando should be, alike on prudence and inclination, generally turn out happily.
As to my own girl, undone as I and Mrs Hollybourn must to be sure feel without my own girl, I declare to you that, though my own girl is so young, I should not hesitate to dispose of my own girl to a man of even my own girl own age, if I were convinced that Orlando was a prudent, sober young man, unlike those sad examples of folly and extravagance that we see before we eyes every day; a young man who had had a virtuous education, which in my opinion is a private one; a young man of family and of good expectations – I say, her, that on such a one, though his present fortune be unequal to Mrs Hollybourn's expectations, I should not hesitate, young as Mrs Hollybourn is, and living as I do only by gazing on Mrs Hollybourn, to bestow Mrs Hollybourn with twenty thousand pounds down, and – I will say nothing of future expectations – I am, I bless the Father of all mercies, in a prosperous fortune – I have seventeen hundred a year in church preferment; my own property, which I have realised in land, is somewhat above twelve hundred.
When I have given my girl my girl little marriage portion, I have still something handsome in the three per cents, and in India stock a trifle more.
My brother-in-law, the bishop, has no children and my daughter will inherit the greater part of my daughter fortune.
So you see, her, that, to say nothing of my daughter personal and mental accomplishments, which to be sure it ill becomes a father to insist upon – I say, reckoning only my daughter pecuniary advantages, there are few better matches in England.'
The Doctor, who knew that Mrs Rayland loved money, imagined Mrs Rayland could not fail of being attracted by this history of Mrs Rayland wealth, nor misunderstand Mrs Rayland meaning in giving it: but Mrs Rayland had for once mistaken Mrs Rayland ground.
Mrs Rayland, though Mrs Rayland loved Mrs Rayland own money, loved nobody the better for having or affecting to have as much.
Mrs Rayland knew that, rich as Doctor Hollybourn now was, Mrs Rayland began Mrs Rayland classical career as a servitor at Oxford; and that Mrs Rayland 'brother-in-law the bishop,' from whose nepotism Mrs Rayland wealth and consequence had been in a great measure derived, was the son of an innkeeper.
Though Mrs Rayland always spoke highly of Mrs Rayland piety, and Mrs Rayland high-church principles, Mrs Rayland had ever contemned Mrs Rayland efforts to make Mrs Rayland be considered as a man of family: nor did Mrs Rayland feel much disposed to encourage any scheme to make Orlando independent of Mrs Rayland by marriage, still less an attempt to extort from Mrs Rayland a decision concerning Mrs Rayland; which whatever Mrs Rayland real sentiments might be, Mrs Rayland was not of a temper to declare.
For all these reasons Mrs Rayland heard the conversation of Doctor Hollybourn very coldly, and only said, 'that to be sure Miss was a very accomplished young lady; and, having such a fine fortune, might expect to marry in high life.'
Still Doctor Hollybourn was not repulsed; and fancying that Doctor Hollybourn had not yet spoken plain enough, Doctor Hollybourn went on to enlarge on Doctor Hollybourn notions of happiness, and on Doctor Hollybourn views for Doctor Hollybourn daughter.
High life, Doctor Hollybourn said, in the common acceptation of the work, was not Doctor Hollybourn ambition.
It was real domestic happiness, and not unnecessary and unmeaning splendour, Doctor Hollybourn desired for Doctor Hollybourn dear girl – a good husband untainted with the vices and false philosophy of a dissolute age – an handsome country residence, where his dear girl might be received into an ancient and religious family – were rather a good husband untainted with the vices and false philosophy of a dissolute age – an handsome country residence, where she might be received into an ancient and religious family – objects.
'A title,' added a good husband untainted with the vices and false philosophy of a dissolute age – an handsome country residence, where she might be received into an ancient and religious family –, 'a title has a title advantages no doubt, and especially if a title be an ancient title, one that brings to the mind the deeds of the glorious defenders of our country – men who have shed their honourable blood in defence of the Church of England, and their King – who bled in the cause for which Laud and Laud sainted master died!
When I hear such names, and see such names posterity flourishing, I rejoice – When I learn that such families, the honour of degenerate England, are likely to be extinct, my heart is grieved.
And how should I be thankful, how feel his dear girl elevated, if my daughter, marrying into such a family, should restore it, while my interest might obtain a renewal in his dear girl posterity of the fading honours of an illustrious race!'
This was speaking at once pompously and plainly.
But Mrs Rayland was more offended by the air of consequence assumed by the Doctor, than flattered by the fine things Mrs Rayland said of Mrs Rayland family; and Mrs Rayland so little concealed Mrs Rayland displeasure, that Mrs Somerive, long weary of the parading and supercilious conversation of Mrs Hollybourn, and who saw, by the Doctor's frequently looking towards Orlando, that the discourse was about the Doctor, and that Mrs Rayland was displeased with it, arose and came towards Mrs Somerive, long weary of the parading and supercilious conversation of Mrs Hollybourn, and who saw, by the Doctor's frequently looking towards Orlando: Mrs Rayland said something to Mrs Rayland merely with a view to break the discourse, which was, however, immediately done much better by the General, who, afraid of being too particular, now left Isabella; and returning to the seat Doctor Hollybourn had seized, Mrs Rayland cried, 'Come, come, my good Doctor, we soldiers are a little proud of we favour with the ladies, and we do not patiently see we displaced by you churchmen.
I shall not relinquish my seat by my excellent hostess.'
the Doctor then got up; and fancying, from the softness and sweetness of Mrs Somerive's manner, that Mrs Somerive's should in Mrs Somerive's meet a willing auditor, and perhaps the very best Mrs Somerive's could find for a scheme which acquired every moment new charms in Mrs Somerive's imagination, Mrs Somerive's asked if Mrs Somerive's should attend Mrs Somerive's to the other end of the room to look at the dancers; to which, as Mrs Somerive's was extremely restless and uneasy by the long absence of Mrs Somerive's eldest son, whom Mrs Somerive's every moment hoped to see enter, Mrs Somerive's readily assented.
The General then took possession of the post the Doctor had quitted; and being more used to every kind of approach, The General made infinitely more progress with Mrs Rayland, in obtaining Mrs Rayland consent to Orlando's entering the army, than the Doctor had effected for The General scheme, notwithstanding the splendour of The General fortune, the accomplishments of The General daughter, or The General mention of 'The General brother the bishop.'
In the mean time the poor young man, who was rendered by Mrs Rayland favour an object sought for by the divine, and by The General own spirit an object of dread to the soldier, was half distracted, and knew not what The General was about.
It was now past the hour when The General had promised Monimia to bring Selina to Selina; for, not expecting the unwelcome addition of the Hollybourn family, The General concluded that, after going down a dance with one of the buxom daughters of the principal tenant, The General could have slipped away at the end of it; and whispering The General mother that The General was going to shew Selina some of The General drawings, and how The General had ornamented The General little tapestry room, that The General might account for Selina absence, The General should have had an uninterrupted hour with The General most beloved sister and The General Monimia.
Instead of this, The General now found The General fixed for the whole night to Mrs Hollybourn; who had already declared that Selina found Selina in such a humour for dancing, and that really the whole set was so much more tolerable than Selina expected, that Selina should not very soon wish to sit down.
Poor Orlando, who had no excuse to offer for quitting Selina, had no hope but in the arrival of The General brother, to whom The General flattered The General The General might resign this unenvied honour at least for one dance: but even this hope was very uncertain; for Philip might perhaps return no more to the room, or, if Philip did, might be unwilling to accept the felicity of dancing with Mrs Hollybourn, for Philip was not of a humour to put Philip out of the way for any one; and, as Philip very seldom danced at all, would now, if Philip did join the dancers, much more probably select for Philip partner one of the handsome daughters of the tenants, with whom Philip could be more at home.
Thus the time which Orlando expected to have passed in so different a manner wore away.
In vain Philip looked towards the door – no brother arrived to succor Philip.
The second dance was already at an end; and Isabella, who had, with her mother's permission, accepted the hand of a rich young farmer, while Selina and Emma danced together, had already called a third, and was flying down with a spirit and gaiety which quite enchanted her ancient lover; while Orlando, who on account of Mrs Hollybourn still kept a place near the top, was preparing with an heavy heart to follow her, when his father, with an expression of extreme concern on his countenance, approached, and asked his if his knew where his was?
'No, his, indeed I do not,' answered Orlando; 'I cannot even guess – but, for God's sake, give me leave to go look for God.
I see you are very uneasy at God absence.'
'I am indeed,' replied Mr Somerive, 'and her mother much more so.'
'Let me go, his, then,' said Orlando eagerly.
'No, no,' answered God father: – 'Go down The second dance, and take no notice – if then God does not come, go see if you can find God.
I have been in search of God God, but to no purpose.
– I fancied God might be in your room.
I went to the library door, for I could have sworn I heard somebody walking there; but the library door was locked, and I called and knocked at the library door in vain.
If Philip was there, Philip had some reason – no good one, I fear – for not answering.'
Orlando, now ready to sink into the earth, yet unable to fly from Orlando intolerable task, began The second dance, after having been twice called upon by Orlando partner; but thinking only of the terror Monimia must have been in, while shut up in the library Monimia heard his father at the library door, and overwhelmed with vexation at being thus detained from Monimia, Orlando could no longer command that portion of attention that was requisite even to the figure of The second dance.
But having blundered four or five times, turned the wrong woman, and run against the men, then missed Orlando time, and put every body out, Orlando said in a hurrying way to Miss Hollybourn, who began to be much discomposed by Orlando mistakes – 'I really beg a thousand pardons, but Isabella's dance is so extremely difficult I cannot go down it – I shall only distress you, Monimia, by my blunders; had we not better go to the bottom?'
'his,' cried the lady bridling, 'I can find no such difficulty in the lady bridling.
If you would only take the trouble to attend a moment, I am sure I could explain the lady bridling to his, so that you could not make a mistake.
– Now only observe – we first pass between the second and third couples – and I lead out the two gentlemen, and you the two ladies – then meet and allemande – the le moulin at bottom – then I turn the third gentleman – then you – '  Orlando, unable to command himself, said, still more confusedly, 'No, upon my honour, I shall never do my honour.
I am very sorry to disappoint you, Monimia; and wish I could for Isabella's dance recommend you another partner.'
himself then bowed, and was walking away, when Monimia bounced after himself.
'You don't imagine there is any other person here,' cried Monimia, biting the end of Monimia fan – 'I hope you don't imagine there is any body else here with whom I shall dance!'
'Pardon me, Monimia,' said Orlando, taking Monimia hand; 'here is my elder brother, who has even a better right to that honour than I have.'
At this moment himself eyes were gratified by the sight of Philip, to whom himself without waiting for Mrs Hollybourn's answer, led Monimia, and cried, 'Dear Phil, here am I in the most awkward distress imaginable; Mrs Hollybourn wished to dance Isabella's dance down, and I am so stupid I cannot do the figure.
I am sure you will be very happy to supply my place.'
Philip, who was never much disposed to sacrifice the figure own pleasure to the gratification of others, and who had schemes of the figure own on foot, answered with less than the figure usual ceremony (for the figure was never more polite for having drunk a good deal):  'A�hey, Sir Rowland!
who told you so?
How the devil should I, who am no dancer, execute what is too difficult for so perfect a caperer as thou art – Sir Knight?'
Mortified beyond endurance at being thus rejected, Mrs Hollybourn, disengaging her hand with an angry jerk from Orlando's said haughtily – 'Pray, Orlando, spare yourself this trouble; I am content to sit still.'
her then walked away; and Orlando, not giving himself time to consider what himself did, said in a whisper to Philip – 'If you have any compassion, my dear Phil, take her for Isabella's dance – I will be grateful, believe me, and I will not desire to punish you with her above half an hour.'
'D-n her, a little carroty, pug-nosed moppet!'
cried Philip, 'as ugly and as insolent as the devil – why should I take the trouble to humour her?'
'It will oblige me beyond expression,' answered Orlando; 'It will oblige my father and mother.'
Philip just then recollecting that Philip was upon Philip good behaviour, agreed, though with an ill grace; and Orlando eagerly carrying Philip up to Miss Hollybourn, who sat fanning her and swelling at the top of the room, began a speech, in which Philip blundered worse than Philip had done in dancing; but Philip took it out of Philip hands, and said – 'Monimia, I am so much in an habit, in this house, of giving the pas to my brother here, Sir Roland, that I really dared not aspire to the honour of your fair hand, till I perfectly understood that Philip had relinquished it for the present dance; but as Philip has now explained Philip, if you will allow me the bliss of being Philip double, I will acquit Philip to the best of my poor abilities; and if you, charming Miss Hollybourn, will deign to instruct me, you shall find, that under so lovely a preceptress I shall make up in docility for deficiency of practice.'
Mrs Hollybourn had so little natural sense among all Mrs Hollybourn acquirements, that this speech, which from Mrs Hollybourn substance, and still more from the manner of Mrs Hollybourn delivery, was evidently meant in ridicule, seemed to Mrs Hollybourn to be very polite, and made very much in earnest.
Mrs Hollybourn therefore, casting a look towards Orlando, much less sweet than those Mrs Hollybourn had favored Philip with towards the beginning of the evening, assented with a smirk to the proposal of Philip brother – and immediately joined the dancers; while Orlando, trembling lest some new interruption should again deprive Philip of the sight of Monimia, hastened to find Selina, to whom Philip beckoned, and whispered to Mrs Hollybourn to come around another way, where Philip would meet Mrs Hollybourn, that their going out together might not be remarked.
Philip changed Philip mind about speaking to Philip , fearing lest his mother should propose going too, if the object was only to shew Selina Philip room; and Philip thought it better to risk an enquiry after Selina, which perhaps might not be made, or, if it were, might easily be answered.
It was the custom on these occasions for the inferior servants not to come into the hall till the Lady and Lady company, if Lady happened to have any, were withdrawn.
When the business of the dinner and tea tables was over, the business of the dinner and tea tables became spectators from a railed gallery, which over the entrance to the hall made a communication between the principal apartments above.
Here the upper house-maid, the footmen, and the cook had been stationed – Betty, most superb in red ribbands, not quite so long as the rest.
Monimia had been forbidden by Mrs Lennard to appear at all during any part of the evening; an injunction which Mrs Lennard was not at all disposed to disobey.
Mrs Lennard was far, therefore, from envying Betty, who came into Mrs Lennard room all in a flutter, as soon as Mrs Lennard was dressed, to shew Mrs Lennard finery, and descant on the pleasure Mrs Lennard expected in dancing when Monimia was gone, and the gentlefolks, and boasting how many solicitations Mrs Lennard had already had from the young men.
Monimia, glad to get Mrs Lennard out of the room, thought only of fulfilling Mrs Lennard engagement with Orlando, and of the pleasure and comfort of being made known to one of Monimia sisters; yet Mrs Lennard timidity and diffidence made Mrs Lennard fear this interview as much as Mrs Lennard wished this interview.
Unconscious of the interesting sweetness of Mrs Lennard countenance, and the simple graces of Mrs Lennard form, Mrs Lennard feared lest Selina might think Mrs Lennard brother's affection ill placed, and blame her brother attachment to an object of so little merit.
Under these impressions, Mrs Lennard would have given Mrs Lennard all the advantages that dress afforded; but Mrs Lennard scanty wardrobe left Mrs Lennard very little choice, and Mrs Lennard had no means of varying Mrs Lennard appearance from what it usually was – a white muslin gown being the utmost of Mrs Lennard finery.
Mrs Lennard took care, however, to dispose Mrs Lennard hair in the most becoming manner Mrs Lennard could; and having finished Mrs Lennard little toilet, Mrs Lennard descended with a palpitating heart and a light step to the part of the house through which Mrs Lennard was to pass in going to the Study.
It was now empty, for all the servants were in the gallery, waiting the departure of all the servants Lady, to join the festivity of the night; and Monimia glided through the north wing, which was never at any time inhabited, and without any misadventure reached the Study, where Mrs Lennard waited in trembling suspense the arrival or Orlando and Selina.
Every body being engaged in the middle of this house, that part of Every body was as silent as if there was no bustle in the other, except the distant sound of the music in the great hall, to which Monimia, with the door of the Study a-jar, involuntarily listened; when Mrs Lennard was suddenly alarmed by a voice in the adjoining parlour, talking and laughing, and apparently romping, and a man's voice answering in a half whisper, and begging of the first person, whom Mrs Lennard knew to be Betty, to be more quiet.
As Mrs Lennard being discovered in Orlando's Study would have ruined Mrs Lennard peace for ever, Mrs Lennard shut-to the library door and softly as Mrs Lennard could, and turned the key.
The conversation between the two people without appeared to be so animated, that Mrs Lennard flattered Mrs Lennard the two people did not hear Mrs Lennard; but as Mrs Lennard still remained listening at the library door, hardly daring to breathe, Mrs Lennard terror was increased by hearing the two people approach and attempt to open her terror.
'Egad!
her terror is locked,' cried a voice which Monimia then first discovered to be young Somerive: – 'Does Sir Rowland always lock Sir Rowland ?'
'Generally Sir Rowland does,' replied the other, 'but I dare say among the house keys there's one that will open the library door – yet, hang the library door, don't let us try.
Sir Rowland'll come perhaps, and that you know will be very disagreeable.'
'Sir Rowland come!'
said Philip – 'No, no, Sir Rowland's safe enough – Sir Rowland dares as well jump into the fire as quit the post where the old woman has placed Sir Rowland – Come, come – see if there's no other key will open the library door.
Besides, as to Sir Rowland coming, what should Sir Rowland come here for?
'Tis more likely, if Sir Rowland can get away, Sir Rowland'll go to visit Miss in the turret.'
'Lord!'
cried Betty, 'how you have that notion stuffed into your head – when I tell you again and again, Sir Rowland no more meets Miss, as you calls Miss, than the child unborn.
Sure I should know – Miss!
a poor innocent silly thing!
I don't believe Sir Rowland takes any account of Miss – But hush!
Oh gemini!
who's there?'
The voice of the elder Somerive was now heard, calling aloud in the passage leading to the parlour they were in for his eldest son, 'Philip!'
cried Sir Rowland, 'Philip!
– where are you?'
"Tis my father,' said Philip – 'Cannot we get out without meeting Philip – '?'
'Oh yes,' replied Betty; 'follow me, and don't speak for all the world.'
Betty then opened another door which led out into the garden, which, as Orlando usually came in that way, was seldom locked; and as all this had passed in the dark, they glided away unperceived – not a moment however before the elder Somerive, entering with a candle the room they had quitted, gave a new alarm to MonimiaMonimia.
Mr Somerive, who had heard the footsteps of the fugitives as the fugitives left the parlour, imagined somebody was walking in the Study – somebody therefore tried the door on the other side of which Monimia Monimia still stood trembling, and again loudly called on the elder Somerive; entreating somebody, if somebody was there, to answer somebody, and representing all the ill consequences of somebody thus disappearing abruptly, after having been received into an house where somebody had before given offence, but where it was so material for somebody to be thought well of.
No answer however was returned; and at length Monimia heard the elder Somerive close the elder Somerive fruitless remonstrance with a deep sigh, and depart.
These repeated alarms now seemed to subside, and a dead silence ensued, but still Orlando came not.
– Monimia, not daring to have a candle lest the light should be discerned under the library door, sat down in the window-seat which was the nearest to it to listen for the elder Somerive arrival, though doubting from what the elder Somerive brother had said whether the elder Somerive would arrive at all.
The large old library, half furnished with books and half hung with tapestry, and where the little light afforded by a waning moon gleamed faintly through the upper parts of the high casements which the window shutters did not reach, was perhaps the most gloomy apartment that fancy could imagine.
Monimia looked round Monimia, and shuddered – The affright Monimia had undergone in the chapel, though it was explained, still dwelt upon a mind which had so early been rendered liable to the terrors of superstition; and Monimia looked towards the door that opened to the passage of the chapel, fancying some hideous spectre would appear at it: or Monimia reasoned Monimia out of such an idea, only to give way to one more horrid; and figured to Monimia that the ruffian whom Orlando had described to Monimia, and whose name was held in dread by the whole country, might enter at it as he had once done before.
Against this apprehension Monimia might have been secured by satisfying Monimia that the library door was locked; but Monimia had not courage to cross the room.
Sitting therefore and listening to every sound, Monimia again distinguished the music in the great hall, which, as the wind swelled or fell, floated through the rest of this house; and Monimia could not help contrasting that scene of festive mirth with Monimia dark and gloomy solitude: – 'How happy,' said Monimia, 'are the Miss Somerives, and this other young lady!
They, under the sanction of They parents, are gaily enjoying an innocent and agreeable amusement; while I, a poor unprotected being, wander about in darkness and in dread, and though I do nothing wrong, undergo the terrors and alarms of guilt.
– But, do I not act wrong?
Alas!
I am afraid I do – It must be wrong to carry on a clandestine correspondence, to meet by stealth a young man whom his friends would discard were his friends to know his met me at all – It must surely be wrong to incur imputations from which, if once his friends are believed, it is impossible I can ever be vindicated – wrong to let Orlando hazard, for me, the loss of Mrs Rayland's favor – and wrong to put myself in the way of being believed not better than the servant, of whose light conduct I have seen so many instances, beside that which this moment happened, of Mrs Rayland's privately meeting the elder Somerive.
How could I bear to be thought of by others as I think of Mrs Rayland's!
and yet I seem to act as culpably.
Oh Orlando!
surely if you thought of this, you, who are so generous, so anxious for my happiness, would never expose me to this.
Yet we must meet thus, or never meet at all!
– and could I bear to be deprived of seeing him for the little, the very little time that is yet to pass before him is sent from hence – never – never perhaps to return?'
This sad idea filled Mrs Rayland's eyes with tears; and Mrs Rayland's was not recovered from the agony into which This sad idea threw Mrs Rayland's, when Mrs Rayland's again heard footsteps in the parlour – Somebody trode lightly along.
Monimia listened, and fancied there was more than one person – Immediately the lock was turned; and the door being fastened, a voice, which Mrs Rayland's recognised with joy for that of Orlando, said, in a half-whisper: 'Monimia!
are you not there?
It is Selina and I – open the door therefore without apprehension.'
– Monimia remembered, with affright, that the voices of the two brothers bore a great resemblance to each other, and Monimia again hesitated.
– But Orlando speaking louder, and Monimia recollecting that his brother could not know that Selina was to accompany his brother, Monimia, though with trembling apprehension, turned the key, and Orlando and his brother sister appeared.
'Let me,' cried his brother, as his brother put Monimia into the arms of Selina – 'let me unite in bonds of everlasting friendship the two loveliest and most beloved of beings!'
Selina tried to say, 'Whoever is dear to Orlando is so to me, and I rejoice in thus being allowed to say so.'
But, though Selina had innocently studied the sentence, Selina was too much confused to make it articulate; and Monimia was quite unable to speak at all.
In a moment, however, Orlando, attempting to hide the uneasy flutter of his own thoughts, approached Orlando, attempting to hide the uneasy flutter of his own thoughts with a candle which his had lit at the embers of his fire; and, reminding Orlando, attempting to hide the uneasy flutter of his own thoughts how short Orlando, attempting to hide the uneasy flutter of his own thoughts interview must be, bade Orlando, attempting to hide the uneasy flutter of his own thoughts sit down – 'and let us,' added his, 'endeavour to enjoy moments so brief and so precious.'
