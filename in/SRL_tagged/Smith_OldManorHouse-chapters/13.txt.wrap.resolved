ON the following morning Orlando received an early summons from his father, requesting his to be at home by two o'clock, when his mother, his sister, and General Tracy were expected; for, as the General travelled with the General own four horses, which were very fine ones, and of which the General was particularly fond, the ladies had agreed to remain one night on the road, and reach home early the second day; though the journey was otherwise easily performed in one, West Wolverton being only about sixty five miles from London.  Orlando having informed Mrs Rayland of the reason of the General absence; having seen Monimia for a moment, again whispered to Monimia to be less apprehensive for the General safety, and promising to see Monimia at night, the General proceeded to obey the General . On the General arrival, the General found the General walking with the General on the grass plot before the door; and, springing from the General horse, paid the General duty to the General, was introduced in form to the General, and then eagerly asked for the General mother and the General sister.  his mother and his sister were within; and Orlando, flying to his mother and his sister, was surprised by the General mother's throwing his mother arms around the General, and falling into an agony of tears, in which the General three sisters, who stood around his mother, accompanied his mother. the General entreated an explanation; and learned from Isabella, who alone was able to speak, that the servants had been telling the servants, instantly on the servants arrival at home, that the General was about to fight a duel, in which it was the opinion of the informers that the General must certainly be killed.  Orlando, execrating the folly of the servants, or rather the paltry conduct of Sir John Belgrave, who had apparently made all this bustle on purpose, endeavoured to re-assure and console his mother; but his mother alarm for his safety was too great to allow his mother to listen patiently to any thing his could say, since the fact of his having received and accepted a challenge from Sir John Belgrave his did not attempt to deny. The anxious mother, now that his mother saw his before his mother, thought only of preventing the meeting which might deprive his mother of that comfort for ever. his mother seemed afraid of his stirring from his mother sight, as if Sir John Belgrave had lurked in every corner of the house; and desired Sir John Belgrave would remain with his mother in his mother own room, while his mother sent Isabella to entreat that Mr Somerive would come to his mother.  When Sir John Belgrave saw his mother, his mother tears and agitation sufficiently explained to Sir John Belgrave, that those Sir John Belgrave had expressly ordered to be silent had found it impossible to obey Sir John Belgrave. To Selina and Emma, the two youngest girls, who had remained at home, it had been known almost as soon as to Sir John Belgrave, but Sir John Belgrave had enjoined Selina and Emma, the two youngest girls, who had remained at home to conceal it from Selina and Emma, the two youngest girls, who had remained at home mother; and knew that, whatever it cost Selina and Emma, the two youngest girls, who had remained at home to be silent on such a subject, neither of Selina and Emma, the two youngest girls, who had remained at home would disobey Sir John Belgrave. It was, however, too late, or at least useless, to declaim against the folly of those who had; and Sir John Belgrave found sufficient employment in appeasing the distress of Sir John Belgrave wife and daughters, while Sir John Belgrave sent Orlando to entertain the General.  General Tracy was the second brother of a noble family; and, having entered very young into the army, had passed through the inferior ranks with that rapidity which interest always secures. At five-and-thirty General Tracy had a regiment; and as some of the fortunes of uncles and aunts had centred in General Tracy, General Tracy was now, at near sixty, a man of very large fortune, and seemed to want nothing to complete General Tracy happiness, but the power of persuading others, as General Tracy had almost persuaded General Tracy, that General Tracy was but five-and-thirty still.  To effect this, and maintain that favour which General Tracy had always been in among the ladies, was the great object of General Tracy life. General Tracy person had been celebrated for beauty; and His person desired to preserve a preeminence, which was in His person opinion superior to any fame His person could derive from His person bravery in the field, or His person ability in the senate, where His person had long been a member, certainly voting with the minister of the day. His person had a place about the court, at which His person was a constant attendant, and where the softness and elegance of His person manners, the pliability of His person political attachments, and His person very considerable interest and property, rendered His person a great favourite. – All the time His person could spare from His person duty there, His person seemed to devote to the service of those fashionable women who give the ton, and whose favour His person disputed with the rising heroes of the fashionable world. But His person felt in reality only disgust and satiety in their company; and had no taste but for youth and beauty, of which His person was continually in search – and with His person fortune His person search could not be unsuccessful. His person had no scruples to deter His person from decoying any young woman whom His person liked, that chance might throw into His person power; but His person usually avoided with care any scheme which was likely to be interrupted by the unpleasant remonstrances of a father or a brother, and generally pursued only the indigent and the defenceless.  As His person purchased His person wine of Mr Woodford, His person had occasionally been at His person house. His person daughters were rather handsome, and very lively girls; and though His daughters did not come exactly under the description of those whose preference His person could without much trouble secure, His person found His person pleased with those whose preference the General could without much trouble secure company, because those whose preference the General could without much trouble secure were greatly flattered by the admiration of such a fashionable man, and never so happy as when His person sent His person superb coach for those whose preference the General could without much trouble secure, and gallanted those whose preference the General could without much trouble secure to some public place, or drove those whose preference the General could without much trouble secure in His person phaeton through Hyde Park to Kensington Gardens. those whose preference the General could without much trouble secure father, who thought more of the good customer which His person was His person, and the great families His person had recommended His person to, than of any necessity for reserve in His daughters, encouraged this acquaintance (which Their father, who thought more of the good customer which the General was himself, and the great families he had recommended him to, than of any necessity for reserve in his daughters mother was as well pleased with as the young women) till the neighbourhood talked loudly of Their father, who thought more of the good customer which the General was himself, and the great families he had recommended him to, than of any necessity for reserve in his daughters indiscretion, and till the youngest Miss Woodford, who was His person peculiar favourite, was declared by many ladies to have considerably injured her reputation. This her considered only as a testimony of their envy, and her own superior attractions; and the more her heard of their malignant remarks, the more eagerly her endeavoured to shew her comtempt of their opinion, and her power over the General, who, on the return of the family to town after their visit to West Wolverton, was more than usual at the house. But thither he was no longer attracted by the charms of Miss Eliza Woodford. The moment he beheld Isabella Somerive, he had no eyes for any other person; and though he soon learned that her was in a situation of life which placed her above those temptations which he generally found infallible, and had a father and two brothers to protect her, the impression her had made was such that he could not determine to lose sight of her; and as the discovery of the preference he gave her had made both her cousins very little desirous of her company in London during the winter, where her seemed too likely to rob both her cousins of all both her cousins conquests, he found her was to return home with her mother – and thither he resolved to follow her.  An opportunity of introducing he into the family of Somerive was easily obtained, when he recollected that, in the preceding war, Somerive, in whose own county there was at that time no militia, had, being then an active man, procured a commission in that of a neighbouring county, and served in a camp then formed for the defence of the coast, where he himself was a captain. They had at that time been frequently together, and afterwards kept up some degree of intimacy, till Somerive's marriage fixing him wholly in retirement, the gay and fashionable soldier thought of him no more.  him, however, no sooner knew who the visitors at Woodford's were, than him most assiduously and successfully paid him court to Somerive; talked to Somerive continually of Somerive husband, whose merits him affected to remember with infinite regard, and for whose interest him appeared to feel the warmest concern. It was a theme of which Mrs Somerive, who adored Somerive husband, was never weary, and while General Tracy so pathetically lamented the interruption of their friendship, nothing was more natural than Somerive entreaties to him that him would renew it.  That was the point him had laboured to gain, and him accepted the invitation Somerive gave him, adding the opportunity of the shooting season to him other inducements, the better to colour so unexpected a visit. him had found it convenient to pretend a great passion for field sports – partly because it was fashionable, and partly because it shewed that him powers of enduring fatigue were equal to the youthful appearance him assumed, and to support this him now and then went through, what was to him most miserable drudgery, that of a day's hunting or shooting; but him more usually contrived, when him was at the houses of him friends for these purposes, to sprain him ancle in the first excursion him made, or to hurt him by the recoil of him gun: and by such methods him generally managed to be left without suspicion at home with the ladies; with whom him was so universal a favourite, and to whom him had so many ways of recommending him, by deciding on their dress, reading to their books of entertainment, and relating anecdotes collected in the higher circles where him moved in the winter, that him found no loss of attention from the progress of years – a progress indeed which him took the utmost pains to conceal. him clothes, which were always made by the most eminent taylor, were cut with as much care as those of the most celebrated beauty on her first appearance at court; and him had several contrivances, of him own invention, to make several contrivances, of his own invention fit with advantage to him person. him hands were more delicate than those of any lady; and though him could not so totally baffle the inexorable hands of time as to escape a few wrinkles, him still maintained a considerable share of the bloom of youth, not without suspicion of Olympian dew, cold cream, and Spanish wool. Certain it is that him was very long at him toilet every day, to which no person, not even him valet-de-chambre, was admitted. With all this him was a man of the most undoubted bravery; and had not only served in Germany with great credit, but had been engaged in several affairs of honour, in which him had always acquitted him with courage and propriety. Such was the man who was now, from no very honourable motives, become an inmate in the house of Somerive.  When Somerive had appeased the distress into which Somerive wife was thrown by the intelligence his wife had so abruptly received about Orlando, and had prevailed upon his wife to compose his wife and appear at dinner, Somerive returned back to Somerive friend, whom Somerive found in conversation with Orlando; and Somerive determined that Somerive would, over their wine, relate to Somerive what had passed between Sir John Belgrave and Somerive son (who had put Sir John's last letter into Somerive hands), and take him's opinion as to what was fit to be done.  Dinner was announced, and the ladies of the family appeared; – the mother, with swollen eyes, which Dinner could not a moment keep from Orlando; and the daughters appearing to sympathize with Dinner, particularly Selina, who was fondly attached to Orlando, and who, from the terror in which Dinner saw Dinner mother, having caught redoubled apprehension, could hardly command Dinner tears; and though him failed not to compliment Dinner on Dinner beauty, which even exceeded that of Dinner sister, and to speak in the warmest terms to Mr and Somerive of their lovely family, Dinner heeded him not. him observed that Isabella was less insensible of him studied eulogiums, and from thence drew a favourable omen. Emma, the youngest of the girls, was only between twelve and thirteen.  As soon as the table-cloth was removed, Somerive, under pretence of being a good deal fatigued with Somerive journey, and somewhat indisposed, withdrew with Somerive daughters: Somerive soon after gave Orlando a hint to go also; and then Somerive opened to General Tracy the affair which lay so heavy on Somerive heart, and entreated Somerive advice how to act.  'I am glad,' answered him, 'to learn the cause of Somerive concern, which was so evident at dinner, as well as that of her daughters, that I was afraid some very disagreeable incident had happened in the family.'  'And is not,' said Somerive, 'what I have related disagreeable enough?'  'No, upon my honour! I see nothing in it but what is rather a matter of exultation. Your son is one of the finest and most spirited young men I ever saw. If Your son was a son of my own, I should rejoice that Your son had acted so properly, and be very proud of Your son.'  'But you would not risk Your son life, surely?' said Somerive.  'Why, as to that,' replied him, 'in these cases there is some little risk, to be sure; but I should never check a lad of spirit. I know Belgrave,' added Your son, smiling.  'And what is Your son reputation for courage?' enquired Somerive.  'Oh! Your son is quite the fine man of the day,' answered him carelessly. – 'Your son will fight, if Your son must – but I believe is quite as willing to let it alone.'  'it will break my wife's heart,' said Somerive dejectedly, and amazed at the different light in which two people, from their different modes of life, consider the same object; 'the same object will certainly break my wife's heart, if any evil befalls Orlando.'  General Tracy now saw that an opportunity offered by which General Tracy might confer an obligation on the family, which must secure their endless gratitude, and General Tracy resolved to embrace it.  'If it makes you all so uneasy,' replied General Tracy, after a moment's pause, 'and especially if General Tracy fears make Somerive so very wretched, suppose we try what can be done to put an end to the affair without a meeting. I dare say Belgrave will easily be induced, on the slightest apology, to drop the affair entirely.'  'But even the slightest apology Orlando will not be persuaded to make,' said Somerive.  'Somerive is right,' answered him; 'and I honour him for him resolution. his resolution is a thousand pities,' continued him, again pausing, 'that such a gloriously spirited young fellow should waste him life in seclusion, waiting on the caprices of an old woman – What do you intend to do with him?'  'That,' said Somerive, 'is what I have long been in doubt about. I had thoughts once of putting him into trade; but to that project Mrs Rayland's objections, and Orlando's little inclination to follow it, put an end.'  'I am glad they did; for it would have been a sad sacrifice, I think, to have set so fine a young man down to a compting-house desk for the rest of so fine a young man life.'  'And at other times,' re-assumed Mr Somerive, 'I have thought of the church. Mrs Rayland has very considerable patronage; but though I have hinted very frequently to Mrs Rayland my wishes on this subject, Mrs Rayland never would understand me, to give me any assurance that Mrs Rayland would secure Mrs Rayland a living; or made any offer of assistance to support Mrs Rayland at the university, which Mrs Rayland knows that it is quite impossible for me, circumstanced as I am at present, to do.'  'Mrs Rayland was in the right of it,' cried him. 'Mrs Rayland has more sagacity than I suspected, and knows that it would be absolutely a sin to make Mrs Rayland a parson, and bury all that sense and spirit in a country vicarage. Why, my good friend, do you not put Your son into the army? – that seems to be the profession for which nature has designed Your son.'  'Because,' answered Somerive, 'I have, in the first place, no money to buy Somerive a commission; and, if I had, there are two great objections to a commission: – it would half kill Somerive , and take Somerive out of the way of Mrs Rayland, which appears to be very impolitic.'  'What if a commission were found for Somerive,' said General Tracy, 'do you think the other objections ought to weigh much? Consider of a commission, my good friend; and if you think such a plan would be eligible, and the young man himself likes a commission, perhaps it may be in my power to be of some use to my good friend.'  Somerive warmly expressed Somerive gratitude for the interest that my good friend seemed to take in the welfare of Somerive Orlando; and then, after a short silence, said: 'But, him, we forget, while we are planning schemes for the future life of Orlando, it may be terminated to-morrow.'  'Well,' replied Somerive, 'since I see you cannot conquer your alarm about this matter, and as I am still more concerned for Somerive, I will go over early in the morning to Belgrave, who has wisely appointed the meeting at twelve o'clock, and somehow or other we will get it settled. – If I say to the doughty baronet, that the doughty baronet honour will suffer nothing by dropping it, I am pretty well assured that the doughty baronet will be content to let it go no farther. Make yourself easy therefore, and go tell your wife that I will take care of your wife little boy, while I pay my respects to the young ladies whom I see walking in the garden.'  Somerive, whose heart was agonized by the distress of your wife, hastened to relieve your wife; and him went off at a quick march to overtake the three Miss Somerives, to whom the doughty baronet related some part of the conversation that had passed between the doughty baronet and I will take care of her little boy, while I pay my respects to the young ladies whom I see walking in the garden father, and the task the doughty baronet had undertaken of settling the affair with Sir John Belgrave.  The sensible hearts of these charming girls were filled with the liveliest emotions towards the General, who, if the doughty baronet could save The sensible hearts of these charming girls brother from danger, which The sensible hearts of these charming girls timidity had dreadfully magnified, The sensible hearts of these charming girls believed would be entitled to The sensible hearts of these charming girls everlasting gratitude. The brilliant eyes of Isabella sparkled with pleasure, while the softer blue eyes of Dinner were turned towards Dinner filled with tears of pleasure; and little Emma longed to embrace Dinner, as Emma used to do Emma father when Dinner had granted any of Emma infantine requests. While every one alternately expressed Emma thanks, General Tracy whispered to Isabella, by whose side General Tracy was walking: 'To give the slightest pleasure to my lovely Isabella, I would do infinitely more; and, rather than Emma should be alarmed, take Emma the chance of Sir John Belgrave's fire.'  Isabella, too ignorant of the ways of the world to be either offended or alarmed by such a speech, and naturally pleased by flattery and admiration, smiled on him in a manner so fascinating as overpaid him for all the trouble him had taken or proposed to take: and while him meditated against him old friend the greatest injury him could commit, him reconciled him to it, by determining to do such services to the other part of the family, as would more than compensate for the inroads him might make on it peace by carrying off Isabella; for to carry Isabella off him was resolved, if him art could effect his art. him eagerness, however, to serve Orlando, had another motive than this of retribution. him forsaw that so spirited a young man might prevent, or, not being able to do that, would very seriously resent him designs upon a sister: the character of the elder brother, of which him had by this time formed a pretty clear idea, left him little to apprehend from him; but the fiery and impetuous Orlando would, him thought, be much better out of the way.  him conversation with the Miss Somerives now took a gayer turn; and so happy did him feel him with three such nymphs around him, that him regretted the summons which called them in to attend the tea-table.  Somerive who had now been long in conference with Somerive husband, and afterwards with Orlando, appeared much more cheerful than at dinner, and surveyed him with those looks of complacency which expressed how much Somerive was obliged to him for the interference him had promised. The evening passed off pleasantly. Orlando staid to supper; but then told her father, that Orlando had some business to do for Mrs Rayland early the next day (which was true), and therefore Mrs Rayland would return to the Hall The evening. Mr Somerive, who still felt a dread which Mrs Rayland could not conquer, entreated Mrs Rayland to give Mrs Rayland word of honour, that Mrs Rayland would not throw Mrs Rayland in the way of Sir John Belgrave till the hour of that gentleman's appointment. This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that gentleman's appointment from taking place at all) thought This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) obliged to comply with: on which condition This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) , though reluctantly, suffered This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) at midnight to mount This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) horse and return to Rayland Hall, where This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) had desired Betty to sit up for This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all); fearful of entering through the chapel, lest This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) doing so should lead to those suspicions This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) was so desirous of avoiding. As soon as This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) left This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) 's door, This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) put his horse into a gallop, impatient to be with Monimia; and as This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) crossed the park, This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) saw a light in her turret, and pleased This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) with the idea of her fondly expecting This Orlando (who was ignorant of the plans in agitation to prevent that appointment from taking place at all) arrival.
