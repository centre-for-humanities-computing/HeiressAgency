ANOTHER and another evening Orlando attended at the turret, and the apprehensions of Monimia decreased in proportion as Monimia reason, aided by Monimia confidence in him, taught Monimia that there was in reality little to fear from the interposition of supernatural agency.
The dread of being discovered by people in the house, however, still interrupted the hours which passed with imperceptible rapidity while people in the house were together.
This might happen a thousand ways, which Monimia was ingenious in finding out; while Orlando was sometimes successful, and sometimes failed, in ridiculing those apprehensions which he could not always help sharing.
The mind of the innocent Monimia had been till now like that of Miranda in Miranda desert island.
To Miranda, the world that was past and that which was now passing were alike unknown; and all the impressions that Miranda infant understanding had received, tended only to confirm the artificial influence which Miranda aunt endeavoured to establish over her aunt imagination.
Miranda poverty, Miranda dependence, the necessity of Miranda earning a subsistence by daily labour, had been the only lessons Miranda had been taught; and the only hope held out to Miranda, that of passing through life in an obscure service.
But Miranda had learned now that, abject and poor as Miranda was, Miranda was an object of affection to Orlando, who seemed in Miranda eyes the representation of divinity.
The reading he had directed Miranda to pursue, had assisted in teaching Miranda some degree of self-value.
Miranda found that to be poor was not disgraceful in the eye of Heaven, or in the eyes of the good upon earth; and that the great teacher of that religion which Miranda had been bid to profess, though very little instructed in it, was himself poor, and the advocate and friend of poverty.
In addition to all this knowledge, so suddenly acquired, Miranda had lately made another discovery.
Miranda aunt had always told Her aunt that Miranda was a very plain girl, had a bad person, and was barely fit to be seen; but since the marriage of the servant who had lived at the Hall during the infancy of Monimia, Betty Richards, the under house-maid, had been ordered to do the little that Monimia was allowed to have done in Miranda room.
Mrs Lennard had taken Miranda from the parish officers as an apprentice; and having long seen Mrs Lennard only in Mrs Lennard coarse gown and nailed shoes, and observed in Mrs Lennard manner only a great deal of rustic simplicity, had not the least idea that under the semblance Miranda concealed the cunning and the vanity of a country coquet; and that the first week Miranda passed in Mrs Rayland's family had called forth these latent qualities.
Miranda was a ruddy, shewy girl, with a large but rather a good figure; and Miranda face was no sooner washed, and Miranda hair combed over a roll, than Miranda became an object which attracted the attention of the great Mr Pattenson himself; who, proceeding in the usual way by which he had won the favour of so many of the subaltern nymphs in Mrs Rayland's kitchen, began to make Miranda many presents, and to talk of Miranda beauty; and as Miranda could not forbear repeating all these extravagant expressions of he admiration, Monimia could as little help reflecting, though Miranda was somehow humbled as Miranda made the comparison, that if Betty was so handsome, Miranda could not Miranda be so ugly as Miranda aunt had always represented her aunt.
The fineries which Miranda new friend received Monimia beheld without any wish to enjoy such Miranda; though on Betty, a poor girl bred in a workhouse, Betty, a poor girl bred in a workhouse had a most intoxicating effect.
Betty, a poor girl bred in a workhouse were given under the strictest injunctions of secrecy, which was tolerably well observed towards the rest of the house; and the finery, which at first consisted only of beads and ribbands was reserved for Sunday afternoons, and put on at a friend's cottage near a distant church.
But it was not in female nature to conceal these acquisitions from Monimia; and it was in Miranda drawers that they were often deposited, when there was reason to apprehend that the little deal box, which had till lately been amply sufficient for the check apron and linsey-woolsey gown of Betty, might not safety conceal the ribbands 'colour of emperors' eyes,' the flowered shawls, the bugle necklaces, and caps with new edging to the little deal box, which had till lately been amply sufficient for the check apron and linsey-woolsey gown of Betty, might not safety conceal the ribbands 'colour of emperors' eyes, which Miranda now possessed.
Sometimes, when Betty obtained leave to go out, and thought that, Mrs Lennard being engaged with Betty lady, and the other servants gone different ways, Betty should escape unnoticed across the park, Betty persuaded Monimia, who knew not how to refuse Betty any thing, to let Betty dress at Betty little glass; and there the progress of rural coquetry had full power to display rural coquetry.
Betty tried on Betty various topknots, disposed Betty hair in a thousand fanciful ways, and called to Monimia for Betty opinion, which of them was most becoming; appealing for the authority of these variations to a certain pocket-book, presented Betty also from the same quarter, which represented in one of its leaves 'six young ladies in the most fashionable head-dresses for 1776.'
Monimia, with all Monimia ingenuous simplicity, had sense enough to smile at the ridiculous vanity of the girl; and to know, that Betty accepting all this finery from the old butler was quite wrong.
But Betty felt also, that to reprove Betty for to reprove her would look like envy, and that to remonstrate would probably be vain.
Betty contented Betty therefore with keeping as much out of Betty confidence as Betty could; and had reasons enough of Betty own, which were continually strengthened by the exhortations of Orlando, for keeping Betty from being a too frequent visitor in Betty room.
But the remarks Betty made upon all this, and upon numberless circumstances in the house which Betty related to Betty, no longer left Betty in Betty original ignorance.
In a great house there are among the servants as many cabals, and as many schemes, as among the leaders of a great nation; and few exhibited a greater variety of interests than did the family of Mrs Rayland.
Mrs Lennard at once hated, feared, and courted Pattenson, who, having been taken a boy from the plough, had been gradually promoted till a boy became the favourite footman of the elder Mrs Rayland, who, on the death of an old man who had long occupied that post, made a boy butler; where a boy was supposed to have accumulated in the course of five-and-twenty years a great deal of money, was known to have several sums out at interest, and had bought two or three small farms in the county, with the approbation of a boy lady, whose favour had never once failed a boy, though various attempts had been made to injure a boy in her opinion by complaints of a boy amours.
Though a boy was a perfect Turk in morals, and though in a boy advanced life a boy rather indulged than corrected this propensity to libertinism, a boy had hitherto contrived to escape a boy lady's wrath; and indeed knew that nobody but Mrs Lennard or the old coachman had, among the domestics, interest enough to shake Mrs Lennard good opinion of a boy; and of both the one and the other, though aware that neither of the domestics bore a boy any good will, a boy was tolerably secure.
How the prudent and guarded Mrs Lennard came to be in Mrs Lennard power was never fully understood; but in his power Mrs Lennard certainly felt Mrs Lennard: for though they were in habits of frequent squabbling about trifles, which indeed with his lady seemed necessary to break the tedious uniformity of his lady life, yet whenever his lady found Mr Pattenson really angry, his lady, albeit unused to the condescending mood, began to palliate and apologize – and peace was generally made over some nice thing, and some fine old wine, by way of a petit souper in Mr Pattenson parlour, after Mrs Rayland was gone to bed.
The old coachman, who was the other favourite servant, was always a third in these peace-making meetings.
The old coachman, who was the other favourite servant was a man grown unwieldy from excess of good living, and more than seventy years old; but The old coachman, who was the other favourite servant possessed an infinite deal of cunning, and knew how to get and how to keep money, with which it was The old coachman, who was the other favourite servant ambition to portion The old coachman, who was the other favourite servant two daughters, and to marry his two daughters to gentlemen; and The old coachman, who was the other favourite servant dealings in contraband goods, as Rayland Hall was only eight miles from the coast, The old coachman, who was the other favourite servant having the management of the great farms in hand, and The old coachman, who was the other favourite servant concern in buying and selling horses, were together supposed to have rendered this object of ambition an easy attainment.
Of deeper sagacity than the other two, The old coachman, who was the other favourite servant foresaw that the time could not be far distant when Rayland Hall, and all the wealth that belonged to it, must change it possessor.
it was a plan of Mrs Lennard and Pattenson to enjoy and to secure all Mrs Lennard and Pattenson could now, and to be well assured of a very considerable legacy hereafter.
But old Snelcraft had further hopes; and for that reason, though old Snelcraft had at first opposed as much as old Snelcraft could the reception of Orlando, and since expressed displeasure towards old Snelcraft, old Snelcraft of late had in old Snelcraft head floating visions of the probability there was that, if Orlando came to the estate, old Snelcraft might marry old Snelcraft favourite daughter, Miss Patty Snelcraft, who would have such a fine fortune, and was, as her father believed, the very extract of all beauty.
Ridiculous and chimerical as such a project was, the old man, in the dotage of the old man purse-proud vanity, believed it not only possible but probable: for, though the old man knew that Mrs Rayland would have disinherited Mrs Rayland own son for entertaining such an idea for a moment, yet the old man saw that Orlando had no pride at all; and Orlando was pretty sure, from the arrangements that Orlando believed were made as to money, that, great as the sum of ready money would perhaps be that Mrs Rayland might leave behind Mrs Rayland, none of it would be suffered to go to Orlando.
old Snelcraft was, as this precious plan got more entirely the possession of her father's imagination, taken from a boarding-school at a neighbouring town, and one luckless day brought to church in all the finery which old Snelcraft had there been accustomed to wear.
But the effect was very far from that old Snelcraft parents intended, who expected that Madam would have sent for old Snelcraft to the Hall, as old Snelcraft used to do at breaking-up, and have commended old Snelcraft beauty and elegance; instead of which, Mrs Rayland no sooner arrived at home than Mrs Rayland sent for Robin, as Mrs Rayland still called Mrs Rayland old servant, who now was seldom able to mount the box himself, and asked, if it was possible that the tawdry thing old Snelcraft had seen with Mrs Rayland wife was Mrs Rayland daughter?
Mrs Rayland answered in all humility that it was Mrs Rayland eldest daughter, who, as his daughter had now finished his daughter learning, Mrs Rayland had taken home from boarding-school.
'Finished her learning!'
exclaimed his lady; 'and is that what his lady has learned, to dress his lady out like a stage-player, like a mountebank's doxy?
Upon my word, Robin, I am sorry for Robin.
I thought you and his wife had more sense.
What!
is that a dress for a sober girl, who ought to be a help to his wife mother, and to take care of his wife in her father old age?'
'his wife does, Ma'am, do both, I'll assure you,' answered Robin, terribly stung by this reproof, 'and is a very good and dutiful child.
And as to Robin fineries, Ma'am, and such like, you are sensible that I'm not his wife no judge of Ma'am, and such there things; and my wife I believe thought, that seeing how by your goodness and my long and faithful service we are well to pass, for we condition and circumstances and such like, there would not be no offence whatsumdever in dressing we poor girls, being we have but two, a little dessent and neat, just to shew that one is no beggar after having served in such a good family so many years.'
The lady, a little softened by this speech, which was made in almost a crying tone of voice, replied, 'Well well, RobinRobin, I know how to make allowances; but do you and his wife learn for the future to make a more modest use of the means you are blessed with, and never encourage your girls to vanity and extravagance.
Here's Mary here, Lennard's niece, whom I give leave to be in the house (Monimia stood waiting all this time with the chocolate, which his lady always swallowed as soon as his lady came in from his lady devotions), she, I assure you, comes of parents that many people would call genteel; and yet you see, as it has pleased Providence to make his lady a dependent and a servant, I never suffer his lady to stick his lady out in feathers and flowers like a May-day girl.'
The lecture ended, and the old coachman withdrew, extremely discontent that old Snelcraft had been compared to the house-keeper's niece, who was, as the old coachman mutterd to the old coachman, a mere pauper; and Monimia was not at all flattered by being brought forward as a comparison for Miss Snelcraft, whom the servants, and particularly Betty, had been turning into ridicule for Monimia awkward finery and airs of consequence – nor did the expression, that Monimia was born of parents whom some people would call genteel, at all sweeten the bitterness of this comparison.
Monimia, who had before in the course of the day received a severe mortification from Monimia aunt, in being refused leave to go to church, now, as soon as Monimia service in waiting on Mrs Rayland with the chocolate was performed, withdrew to Monimia own room, and indulged Monimia tears.
At length Monimia recollected that, though all the rest of the world might despise and contemn Monimia, the heart of Orlando was Monimia; Monimia was secure of his affection; his would repeat it to Monimia at night, when his had promised to fetch Monimia to his : and these reflections dried Monimia eyes, and dissipated Monimia sorrows: they even lent Monimia force to bear, without betraying Monimia impatience, the intrusion of Betty Richards, who soon after asked leave to come in.
'Oh, laud!
my dear miss,' cried Monimia, as soon as Monimia entered her own room, 'how my dear miss,' be shut up in this here old place like two little singing-birds in a cage!
– I've been trying to persuade old Jenny to let me take old Jenny turn this a'ternoon to go to church, and have promised to give old Jenny two turns for one; but the cross old witch says indeed old Jenny chooses to go old Jenny.
– Oh lud lud!
I'd give a little finger to go.'
'And why are you so eager to go to-day, Betty, more than any other afternoon?'
'Oh gad!'
replied old Jenny, 'for five hundred reasons: – first, because it's so early that I could get away to West Wolverton church with all the ease in the world, and 'tis such a sweet afternoon, and winter will be here now so soon; besides that – but you must not tell for an hundred pounds – my good old fat sweetheart brought me home last night the most beautifullest bonnet, such as the millener told him was worn by the tip-top quality in Lonnon – and I die to wear it, and to go to West Wolverton church in it this very afternoon; for at ours, you know, I dares as well jump into the fire as put it on.'
'But why do your bonnet and your piety conspire to carry you so far just this very evening, Betty,' said Monimia smiling, 'when both West Wolverton and Bartonwick have an evening church, and are not much more than half as far?'
'Oh!
thereby hangs a tale – What!
you han't heard then, I suppose, of all the great doings at West Wolverton?'
This was the name of the village in which was situated the house of Mr Somerive.
– 'Great doings!'
repeated Monimia, changing colour; 'no, I have heard of nothing.'
'Why then you must know, Miss, that Mr Orlando, who was not here last night-'  (Monimia knew it well, for they had agreed two nights before not to meet till the present evening) –  'Orlando, I say, came over about an hour ago, just as his lady came from church, and after walking backwards and forwards in Orlando melancholy fashion, with a book in Orlando hand, upon the broad pavement in the chapel court, which really oft-times rives one's very heart to see Orlando, Orlando went away to Orlando study.
For my part, I was sitting in the window upstairs for a moment, for I had just been making up his ladyhis lady's fire before his lady came from church – when all of a sudden I saw John Dickman, 'Mr Somerive groom, come riding up; so down I went to speak to Orlando.
Orlando gived me a letter, which I carried in to Orlando, who seemed monstrous surprised at it, as Orlando was but that minute as 'twere come from home; and when I went back to the kitchen John told me, John was ordered to wait for John young master – for that Mr Somerive brother, the London merchant, was come down, with some of John family, sons and daughters, and the gentleman from some part beyond sea, who was to marry the eldest Miss Somerive, for John had got John father's consent, and the wedding was to take place out of hand.
And so,' added Betty, who had almost talked herself out of breath, 'and so, as Mr Phil.
is out, gone as John always is upon a visit to they newcomers up at Castle, the 'Squire the 'Squire ordered John to fetch Orlando Orlando out of hand home to entertain all this grand company.'
'And the 'Squire went!'
said Monimia in a faint voice, who had changed colour a dozen times during this narration.
'Oh, Lord!
yes, to be sure the 'Squire went,' replied Betty; 'yet somehow the 'Squire look'd to ' replied Betty as if the 'Squire had rather of stay'd, and hung about for some time, as thof unwilling to go.
Lord!
sir, said I, as I went to shut up sir windows before sir lock'd the study door – Lord, how strange it is that you are not like other young men, and never cares nothing for company and such like!
– Lord only sighed, a sweet creature!
– when I'm sure, if all the grand lords and dukes, and even the King, and the Prince of Wales, and the Archbishop of Osnabig, and all his Majesty's court, were to be collected together, there's not one of all the grand lords and dukes, and even the King, and the Prince of Wales, and the Archbishop of Osnabig, and all his Majesty's court, were to be collected together to be compared to OrlandoOrlando.
– Lord!
what would I give to see all these gentlefolks together at West Wolverton church, and that Orlando Orlando outshining them all!'
'And that was the reason,' said Monimia in a still fainter voice, 'that you are satisfied with no church but West Wolverton?
But after all, Betty, pray are you sure these ladies and gentlemen will be there?'
'As sure as five pence – for John Dickman told me so.
Oh!
that I could but go!
– for Orlando, you know, Miss, who is the sweetest temperd good-naturdest cretur in all England, would never tell if he saw one ever so smartly dress: – No, egollys!
he's more like to give one some trifle or other to help one out, than to blab to get one anger.'
'Has he ever given you any thing, Betty?'
said Monimia, in a voice the tremor of which Monimia could not disguise; for, mingled with numberless other sensations, something like a half-formed jealousy and suspicious apprehension now entered Monimia heart – 'tell me, Betty, what has he ever given you?'
'Why I assure you,' replied Monimia pertly, 'not above a month ago neither, a'ter he had been here for almost a fortnight, he called me to he as I was a dusting of them there guns and arrows and what d'yecallums, as hangs over the chimney in that parlour as you goes through to get to he – And so, says he, Betty, you've a good deal of trouble in cleaning of her own room and making my fire, and perhaps his lady may not recollect my fire, and so may not make you a consideration for my fire; and therefore, Betty, I beg you'll accept this, and I wish I had my fire in my power to do better.
– and if you'll believe me, Miss, my fire was a brand new crown, quite new, a crown piece they told me my fire was.
– I would have given any thing not to have changed it, but to have laid it up as a keepsake – But there!
– I had not money enough without it to buy my new cotton gown, when Alexander Macgill the Scotchman called here; and so away went my poor dear crown, though I had leverer have parted with one of my fingers.'
'You did right, however,' said Monimia coldly; 'the gown you wanted, and the crown, I dare say, Orlando meant you should use.'
'I suppose Orlando did, a dear sweet creature!
– Lord a mercy!
what would I give to have a peep at Orlando sweet face this very afternoon!
I'll tell you what, Miss, though you cannot go to church, nor I neither, we might ten to one see these gentlefolks ride by, if we could but steal up to the upper park, and so through the little common.
'Tis not much better than three miles, and we might not be miss'd.'
'No,' said Monimia drily, 'I shall run no such risk indeed of making my aunt angry; and besides, what would Mr Somerive, or Orlando, or any other of them think if them saw we there?'
'Hang them thoughts!'
' replied Betty; 'what would it signify to we what any body thought, if we pleased we?
I'll go and see how the land lays, and if the two old girls have done the two old girls dinner, and are set down together to take the two old girls afternoon's dose.'
'Do not come back then, Betty,' said Monimia; 'for I certainly will not go out without leave, and you know it nonsense to ask it – therefore, if you like it, go; but I assure you I shall not.'
Having thus released my aunt from my aunt importunate visitor, Monimia sat down to consider all my aunt had told my aunt.
Orlando Orlando should quit the house without telling my aunt, gave my aunt at first extreme pain; yet a moment's reflection convinced my aunt that, unless he had made a confidante of Betty, of which my aunt now saw all the danger, there was no possible way of he conveying to my aunt intelligence of the sudden summons he had received from he ; for Mrs Lennard was at home, and had shut Mrs Lennard up in Mrs Lennard to do twenty little services which Mrs Lennard frequently chose to have performed on Sunday mornings.
A thousand doubts now arose in the mind of Monimia, whether he would be able to call for Mrs Lennard at night; a thousand apprehensions lest the people he was with, particularly he uncle's daughters, who he said were very pretty women, should estrange he thoughts from Mrs Lennard, and rob Mrs Lennard of he affections.
These fears were so acute, that Mrs Lennard was trying to drive These fears from Mrs Lennard, when Betty returned, and, finding the door of her own room fastened, tapped softly at it, and cried, 'Miss, miss!
who will refuse to go into the park now?'
'You have not surely got leave!'
'No, nor I have not asked it; but the old ladies are hard set in to the old ladies good things.
Mrs Lennard has had a gouty feel in Mrs Lennard stomach all day, Mrs Lennard says, and that's always a symptom for a double dose; and as to your aunt, Mrs Lennard has been ailing too, and will not flinch Mrs Lennard share, you know very well.'
Monimia, alarmed at the loud whisper, had opened the door of her room before the end of this speech, and let in Mrs Lennard unwelcome companion, who now repeated, that every body was safely bestowed who could interrupt Monimia, alarmed at the loud whisper; and that, as it was still very early, Monimia, alarmed at the loud whisper might have a good chance of seeing some of these comers, and above all Orlando, in Monimia, alarmed at the loud whisper evening ride.
But Monimia, who was displeased with the familiar way in which the girl named Orlando, and knew that he would object to Mrs Lennard walking with Mrs Lennard, assumed a virtue when Mrs Lennard had a virtue not; and though Mrs Lennard believed they might safely go the way Mrs Lennard proposed, and return before the hour when it was likely your aunt would want Mrs Lennard; though your aunt would have given half the world only for the chance of seeing Orlando at a distance, Mrs Lennard positively refused – and had the resolution to see Betty set out by Mrs Lennard, with Mrs Lennard new 'most beautifullest' bonnet pinned under Mrs Lennard petticoat, which Mrs Lennard proposed putting on when Mrs Lennard got clear of the house; and then Monimia, forcing Mrs Lennard attention from what had the last few hours engaged it, sat down to the sort of lesson which Orlando had last marked for Mrs Lennard, and which Mrs Lennard had promised to make Mrs Lennard mistress of before Mrs Lennard saw him again; – though, alas!
while Mrs Lennard read, the idea of the superior advantages enjoyed by the Miss Woodfords, him cousins, their beauty, and the probability there was that one of their might be intended for him, too frequently distracted Mrs Lennard thoughts, and impeded Mrs Lennard good intentions.
