INSTEAD of the reproaches Orlando expected to hear, Mrs Rayland received Mrs Rayland, if not with so much cordial kindness as usual, at least without any appearance of anger. After the usual compliments on Mrs Rayland part, and some enquiries on hers, whether all those who were immediately hers guests had gone as soon as all those who were immediately her guests left hers, Mrs Lennard withdrew, and Orlando was left alone with the old Lady, and again trembled lest some remonstrances were to be made; for Mrs Rayland mind was so entirely occupied by that subject, that Mrs Rayland forgot it was possible for the attention of others to be differently engaged.  Mrs Rayland apprehensions increased, when Mrs Rayland, after a solemn silence, thus began:  'I believe, Orlando, I have given you abundant proof that I esteem you above the rest of my kinsman's family.'  Orlando bowed, and would have said that Orlando was sensible of and grateful for her kindness; Orlando could make nothing of the sentence – but blushed and faltered while Mrs Rayland went on.  'Your father has once or twice proposed sending you out into the world, and has consulted me upon the occasion. I suppose you are not unacquainted with the plan Your father has lately thought proper to propose for you.'  Orlando, relieved by hearing that her discourse did not tend whither Your father feared her discourse would, said that Your father knew General Tracy had offered Your father to procure Your father a commission; 'an offer, Madam,' continued Your father, 'of which I waited to hear your opinion before I myself ventured to form any wishes upon the subject.'  This was carrying Your father complaisance farther than Your father had ever yet done. But, confused and apprehensive as Your father was, Your father said any thing which might turn the discourse from what Your father most dreaded, without having Your father mind enough at liberty to enquire rigorously into the truth or propriety of what Your father uttered; and even the independent spirit Your father had always prided Your father on supporting, was lost amid Your father fears for Monimia.  Mrs Rayland looked at Your father steadily for a moment –  'You are ready then,' said Mrs Rayland, 'to follow any line of life, Orlando, which your friends approve?'  'I am, Mrs Rayland; and always have been.'  'And you do not dislike the army?'  'Very far from it, Mrs Rayland.'  'I have been accustomed from my youth,' reassumed the old Lady after another pause, 'to consider the profession of arms as one of those which is the least derogatory to the name of a gentleman.'  'It is honourable, Mrs Rayland, to any name.'  'My grandfather,' continued Mrs Rayland, 'after whom you were by the permission of our family called – my grandfather, I say, Sir Orlando Rayland, appeared with distinguished honour in the service of his master in 1685, against the rebel Monmouth, though not of the religion of King James. My father Sir Hildebrand distinguished My father Sir Hildebrand under Marlborough when My father Sir Hildebrand was a younger brother, and saw much service in Flanders. Of remoter ancestors, I could tell you of Raylands who bled in the civil wars; we were always Lancastrians, and lost very great property by we adherence to that unhappy family during the reigns of Edward the Fourth and Richard the Third. My great great grandfather, who was also called Orlando . . . '  Mrs Rayland had soon totally forgotten the young hero who was before Mrs Rayland, while Mrs Rayland ran over the names and exploits of heroes past; and, lost in their loyalty and their prowess, Mrs Rayland forgot that hardly any other record of their remained upon earth than what Mrs Rayland memory and their pictures in the gallery above afforded. Orlando, however, heard Mrs Rayland not only with patience but with pleasure. In recurring thus to their when the question of his professional choice was before Mrs Rayland, it appeared that Mrs Rayland had somehow associated the idea of his future welfare with that of their past consequence; and, besides the satisfaction this discovery afforded his, his began to hope that his fears of any discovery were quite groundless.  Mrs Rayland having at length completed the catalogue of the warriors of Mrs Rayland family, and having no more to say, returned to the subject which had given rise to this discussion. – 'Therefore, young kinsman, I say that, if this worthy General Tracy will favour you with this worthy General Tracy countenance, if your father and your relations approve of your relations, and if you yourself are disposed for the profession of arms, I shall be glad not only to give you some assistance towards setting out, but to aid you from time to time in such means of promotion as the General may point out to me.'  Orlando, who now found the whole affair decided, felt one pang at the certainty which presented itself, that he must quit, soon quit he beloved Monimia; it was severe, but momentary: and with equal warmth and sincerity he thanked Mrs Rayland for Mrs Rayland goodness, and assured Mrs Rayland that he was ready to avail he of Mrs Rayland generous intentions in he favour.  'But are you sure, Mr Orlando,' added Mrs Rayland interrupting Mrs Rayland acknowledgments – 'are you quite sure that no unworthy connection, no improper attachment here, will make the departure for your regiment disagreeable to you?'  The blood that had so often been the treacherous emissary of conscience before, now flew to the cheeks of Mr Orlando; indeed he whole countenance changed so much that Mrs Rayland, though not very clear-sighted perceived it. Mrs Rayland brow took that severe look which Her brow almost always lost in the presence of Mrs Rayland young favourite – 'I see,' cried Mrs Rayland, observing Mr Orlando still hesitate – 'I see that I have not been misinformed.'  Every thing seemed to depend on the presence of mind which he was at this moment able to exert. he recovered he, and said, in a firm and calm tone, 'I know not, Mrs Rayland, what information you have received; but this I know, and do most solemnly assure you, that I have no unworthy connection, no improper attachment – and,' added he, animated by reflecting that he love for the innocent, amiable Monimia was neither – 'and when you discover that I deceive you, I am content to relinquish your favour for ever.'  'Indeed you will lose your favour,' answered Mrs Rayland, a little relaxing of Mrs Rayland severity; – 'and that I may still have the pleasure of supposing you worthy my good opinion, and that well disposed young man which I have always wished to find you, your leaving this place awhile may not be amiss. I know how to make some allowance for the arts of wicked girls; but I shall take care that no such person disgraces my family for the future. In regard to you, cousin, I hope you are above any such unworthy thoughts. It must be my business to give proper directions for the rest, and for the due regulation of my family. You will prepare, cousin, for your commission, which the worthy General tells me the worthy General expects every day: the worthy General assures me it is worth upwards of four hundred pounds. Your father is very happy in having met with a real friend.' – Orlando, thunderstruck by a speech which Your father believed related to Monimia, stood like a statue. It was fortunate for the worthy General that Mrs Rayland, after the words wicked girls, continued to speak; for, had Mrs Rayland not done so, Orlando would infallibly have betrayed the worthy General by entering into a warm defence of Monimia; the worthy General would indeed have confessed, without reserve, their long attachment, and frequent interviews: but the rest of Mrs Rayland speech, and the entrance of Mrs Lennard for whom Mrs Rayland rang just as Mrs Rayland concluded it, gave the worthy General time to recollect the worthy General: yet when Mrs Rayland, in Mrs Rayland usual way, dismissed Mrs Rayland, Mrs Rayland doubted whether Mrs Rayland honour and Mrs Rayland love did not call upon Mrs Rayland to come to an immediate explanation. The consideration and kindness which Mrs Rayland expressed for Mrs Rayland, so unlike the usual prudish asperity of Mrs Rayland disposition, were offensive and hateful to Mrs Rayland, when Mrs Rayland believed Mrs Rayland acquitted Mrs Rayland at the expence of Monimia. Mrs Rayland hastened however to Mrs Rayland own apartment, because it was necessary to see what was become of Mrs Rayland brother. It was some alleviation to Mrs Rayland confusion and distress to find Philip was gone; and Philip sat down, endeavouring to collect Philip thoughts, and to determine on what was to be done.  That Monimia was on Monimia account to be dismissed from the house of Mrs Rayland, and the protection of Monimia only relation, the circumstances of the preceding night, added to what Monimia had just heard, left Monimia but little reason to doubt. What then was to become of Monimia? and how could Monimia make Monimia any reparation for the injury Monimia had done Monimia, but by instantly declaring the truth, and relinquishing all prospect of future prosperity, from which Monimia must be excluded? – Desperate as Monimia felt this step to be, Monimia was in a state of mind that urged Monimia to decide on any thing that might bring their fate to a crisis: and, believing Monimia finally determined, Monimia started up from this short counsel with Monimia, and was going hastily to the apartment of Mrs Rayland, when at the door Monimia was stopped by Betty, who, with Monimia hat on, and a small bundle in Monimia hand, dropped Monimia a curtsey, and said, with an arch smile, 'I'm come to take my leave of you 'Squire, and to wish you well.'  'Whither are you going then, Betty?' said Orlando.  'Lord, Sir,' cried Monimia, 'you're such another hard-hearted gentleman! – What! I warrant you don't know that Mrs Rayland have sent me down my wages, with orders to go out of Mrs Rayland house directly, and all upon your account.'  'Upon his account!' – 'Pattenson it seems have been telling more false lies to Mrs Rayland. – 'Pattenson won't believe, ever since that night that somebody was seen in your room – I don't know who, not I – but that you and I be too great: Mrs Lennard would never hear on't till to-day; but now they've found out, by laying they old noddles together, that I was out of her house last night, and they says 'twas along a you. Knowing my own innocence, I bears it all; for I be clear of the charge, as you know very well: I wish every body could say as much; but I know what I know.'  Orlando now instantly comprehended that it was of Mrs Rayland had spoken, and not of the innocent Monimia, whom it was of Betty Mrs Rayland own rash impatience was again on the point of betraying. Sensible of it was of Betty Mrs Rayland good fortune in having been thus prevented, it was of Betty Mrs Rayland was still confused and agitated. 'Whatever you know, Betty,' said it was of Betty Mrs Rayland, 'of it was of Betty Mrs Rayland, I am at least very sorry you have, by any mistake, relative to it was of Betty Mrs Rayland, lost your place, and Mrs Lennard's favour.'  'As to Mrs Lennard's favour,' answered Monimia pertly, 'I values it no more than that; and Monimia had better keep Monimia tongue within Monimia teeth about it was of Betty Mrs Rayland, I can tell Monimia that; and as for places, there's more in the world. One should have a fine time on't, indeed, to pass all one's life in this here old dungeon, among rats, and ghosts, and old women. However, young 'Squire, I advises you, as a friend, to take more care for the future: some people are very sly; but for my part I scorn to betray 'um – but mayhap the next housemaid mid'nt be so willing as I have been to bear the blame for things Monimia's as innocent of as the child unborn.'  'I cannot tell to what you allude,' replied Orlando in a hurried voice; 'but this I know, that if I have done you any injury, I am very sorry for it, and willing to make you any reparation in my power.' He then took a guinea from He pocket – 'Accept of this,' cried He, 'and be assured I shall on any future occasion be happy to serve you.' – Monimia took a guinea from his pocket – 'Accept of this, but without expressing any gratitude either for that, or He apparent wishes to make Monimia what amends He could for the loss of Monimia place: – Monimia flippantly told He, Monimia hoped, for all Madam's injustice, and the malice of Monimia enemies, Monimia had friends who would not let Monimia be beholden to nobody – Monimia then left her house.  Orlando, thus relieved from the most acute uneasiness Orlando had ever suffered, returned to Orlando room. Orlando most ardently wished to communicate to Monimia the joy Orlando felt in finding that the suspicions excited by so many awkward circumstances, had by some means or other fallen upon this servant; and apparently without doing Monimia any injury, which would have considerably lessened Orlando satisfaction. Far from regretting Monimia dismission, Monimia seemed pleased with having had an opportunity given Monimia to be dismissed; and Orlando, who had long known Monimia to be a very improper associate for Monimia, found many reasons to be glad of Monimia departure. That Monimia knew, or very strongly suspected their meetings, seemed very evident; Monimia was much less dangerous any where than within the house – and as to what Monimia might say without, which might be prejudicial to the character of Monimia, the character of Monimia determined to prevent the ill effects of that where it might be most prejudicial, by confessing, before the character of Monimia left the country, the very extent of the character of Monimia fault to the character of Monimia father, who already suspected so much of the truth.  However earnestly the character of Monimia wished to speak to Monimia, and however uneasy the idea of Monimia suspense and dejection made the character of Monimia, the character of Monimia could find no opportunity of speaking to Monimia during the morning, without hazard, which the character of Monimia had too recently suffered for, so immediately to incur again. Though Mrs Lennard had artfully made Betty the victim, there was still reason to believe Betty was not without suspicions; and to irritate or increase suspicions now, would be to preclude the character of Monimia from the last pleasure the character of Monimia was likely to taste during the rest of the character of Monimia short residence at the Hall – the pleasure of soothing the character of Monimia beloved Monimia, and, at the few interviews which suspicions might yet obtain, reconciling Betty soft heart to the necessity of that separation that was so soon to happen.  the character of Monimia was summoned to dinner with Mrs Rayland, who seemed pleased to find the character of Monimia was still at the Hall. Never did the old Lady appear in such good humour with the character of Monimia, or so relaxed from the starch prudery of the old Lady usual character. – the old Lady gave way to the old Lady love of telling anecdotes and stories of the old Lady own family; and, pleased with the attention Orlando gave to the old Lady narratives, the old Lady hinted to the character of Monimia, though still with great ambiguity, that it would be the character of Monimia own fault if the character of Monimia was not one day or other the representative of a family so illustrious. the old Lady then spoke of the character of Monimia with anger and contempt, which Orlando generously tried to soften; of the character of Monimia mother with the old Lady usual coldness and dislike; and of the character of Monimia sisters as good, pretty-behaved girls – 'that is, I mean, the two youngest. As to Miss Belle – the old Lady's a London lady already: I protest it hurts me to see young women so bold – but the old Lady has been cried up for a beauty.' 'Tis vanity ruins all girls – no good is ever to be expected from all girls when once all girls get conceited notions into all girls heads of being handsome.'  Orlando undertook the defence of Orlando sister with more zeal than prudence; but Mrs Rayland, though not to be convinced that Isabella was not a vain coquet, which indeed Isabella unguarded gaiety gave the old Lady very good reason to believe, was however in a humour to be pleased with all Orlando said. the old Lady attachment to Orlando had been long insensibly increasing; and though, like another Elizabeth, the old Lady could not bear openly to acknowledge the old Lady successor, the old Lady was as little proof as the royal ancient virgin, against the attractions of an amiable and handsome young man, whom the old Lady loved to consider as the child of the old Lady bounty, and the creature of the old Lady smiles. Though determined to keep him dependent during the old Lady life, and even to send him out a soldier of fortune, the old Lady really meant to give him, at the old Lady death, the whole of the old Lady landed property; and the machinations of Pattenson, whose jealousy and avarice alike excited him hatred to Orlando, had hitherto had an effect so different from what him expected, that him found him politics entirely baffled, and that him was more likely to lose, by farther attempts, him the old Lady's regard, than to shake that the old Lady entertained for the young favourite.  A few years before, the very suspicion of an intrigue would have shut for ever the doors of Rayland Hall against the supposed delinquent; but now the attempts to impute such to Orlando had ended in nothing but the dismissing a servant – a circumstance proving at once, that though some credit was given to the accusation, no resentment towards him was entertained.  Mrs Lennard, who had more sense and more art than Pattenson, and who had opportunities more closely to observe the old Lady, had long seen the progress of the old Lady affection for Orlando, and long ceased to counteract it. – the old Lady was not weak enough to imagine, as Pattenson did, that such great property as Mrs Rayland possessed would be divided among the old Lady servants – but the old Lady knew that the old Lady should the old Lady possess a very considerable legacy; and the old Lady thought it better that Orlando should inherit the bulk of the fortune, than either his father, who had always considered the old servants about the old Lady as his enemies, or any public charity – to some of which Mrs Rayland had, in former fits of ill humour, expressed an intention to leave the Rayland estate.  Mrs Rayland had, in common with many old people, a strange aversion to speaking of Mrs Rayland will, or of what was to happen after her death; and, far advanced as Mrs Rayland was in life, Mrs Rayland talked of future years as if Mrs Rayland believed Mrs Rayland immortal. Mrs Lennard had, however, once seen part of a will – with which in respect to Mrs Rayland, Mrs Rayland had great reason to be satisfied. Mrs Rayland knew that Mrs Rayland had lately made another, to which Mrs Rayland was not a witness; – for such was the peculiarity of the old Lady the old Lady in this respect, that Mrs Rayland had sent for a lawyer and witnesses from London, that none of the neighbouring attorneys, or even Mrs Rayland confidential servants, might know Mrs Rayland had lately made another, to which she was not a witness contents. Mrs Lennard did not doubt but that Orlando was in this made the heir of almost all the landed property; but Mrs Lennard had no reason, from Mrs Rayland behaviour to Mrs Lennard, to apprehend that this new will was at all prejudicial to Mrs Lennard.  Still, however, it was not Mrs Lennard interest to encourage the affection which many circumstances gave Mrs Lennard reason to believe Orlando entertained for Mrs Lennard niece. Mrs Lennard knew that, if the rashness of youth and passion should urge the rashness of youth and passion to marry, it would not only ruin Orlando, who would then be a beggar; but that Mrs Lennard should Mrs Lennard be accused of having promoted this fatal indiscretion, and lose Mrs Lennard own advantages without obtaining any for Mrs Lennard niece, whom Mrs Lennard by no means wished to see independent of Mrs Lennard, even if independence could thus have been obtained; and whom Mrs Lennard treated with redoubled rigour, when Mrs Lennard found reason to believe that Orlando felt for Mrs Lennard that attachment which Mrs Lennard had from their childhood foreseen and attempted to prevent.  Orlando Orlando gained on the favour of Mrs Rayland, Mrs Lennard Mrs Lennard became of Mrs Lennard affection for Monimia: Mrs Lennard had however persuaded Mrs Lennard, that, with the precautions Mrs Lennard took, their clandestinely meeting or carrying on any correspondence was impracticable; and, satisfied that Monimia was confined to Mrs Lennard room, Mrs Lennard vigilance had now and then slumbered. But her vigilance awakened by the late reports that obtained in her house and about the country; reports which originated in the gossip of Orlando's nocturnal visitor; of his being missing at unusual hours, and from Betty's hints. When, therefore, Pattenson's jealousy was so far roused as to urge his to speak to his Lady of a supposed intimacy between Orlando and this his faithless favourite, Mrs Lennard let it make it impression; and Betty's pertness who had before agreed with Philip Somerive to take the first opportunity of going off to Philip Somerive, gave Mrs Lennard a pretence immediately to discharge Mrs Lennard. Mrs Rayland, content to part with Mrs Lennard favourite Orlando, because Mrs Lennard thought it for Philip Somerive advantage to see something of the world in an honourable profession – and because Mrs Lennard believed, if youth and idleness had concurred with the art of the girl with whom Philip Somerive was accused, to lead Philip Somerive into any improper connection, this was the best way to break it – determined on Philip Somerive departure with satisfaction, since the General assured Mrs Lennard there was at present no probability of Philip Somerive leaving England.  Mrs Lennard, who thought herself fortunate in having all the suspicions fall on Betty, kept as a profound secret those herself entertained herself relative to Monimia, whom herself resolved narrowly to watch till Orlando was gone. And Pattenson, glad that the young minion was to go, as the young minion termed it, for a soldier, reconciled the young minion by that reflection to the failure of the young minion original plan, which had been totally to ruin the young minion with Mrs Rayland. As to the loss of the young minion fair one, the young minion knew herself would not remove far; and that resentment for the young minion accusations would not make herself long relentless, while the young minion had presents and money to offer herself.  Such were, at this juncture, the politics of Rayland Hall.
