'WHEN you left us, my brother,' said Selina, 'us hardly thought it possible that any sorrow could exceed what your departure and the apparent estrangement of Philip inflicted on us all; yet in a very few days us learned that, heavy as these evils were, these evils were only the beginning of that long train of calamity which was about to overtake us. Isabella disappeared within two days, and left a letter to say that Isabella was gone with Captain Warwick to America.'  'And pray tell me,' said Orlando, interrupting Isabella, 'was my poor father extremely hurt at Isabella elopement?'  'Not so much at her elopement, as at Isabella having deceived my poor father; for I do not believe, Orlando, that my poor father ever thought of Isabella's marrying General Tracy without pain and doubts of Isabella future happiness. But it grieved my poor father severely to reflect that Isabella was capable of deception, which, notwithstanding the rashness of Isabella going away with a man Isabella hardly knew, must have been meditated for some days.'  'Did my poor father believe me to have been a party in this deception?'  'Of that my poor father sometimes doubted: yet after dwelling on those doubts a moment, my poor father would say, 'No – Orlando could never be acquainted with the plan of these two young people; No – Orlando would not have concealed No – Orlando intentions from me No – Orlando never in No – Orlando life deceived me – No – Orlando is all integrity and candour – '  'And in this persuasion my poor father died?'  'Yes; and never spoke of you, Orlando, but as the hope and reliance of us all.'  No – Orlando sighed deeply, reflecting that No – Orlando had not deserved in this single instance the confidence of No – Orlando ; yet No – Orlando rejoiced that, believing No – Orlando ignorant of No – Orlando sister's flight, this opinion of No – Orlando integrity had not been impaired where it could have done no good to have known the truth, and would only have inflicted another wound on No – Orlando 's heart. Selina proceeded.  'We received your letter from Portsmouth, and some days afterwards another from Isabella – I believe it was near a fortnight afterwards – Selina was about to embark for America with Selina husband, who had hired a small vessel for that purpose, having missed his passage. – This, in some degree, quieted the apprehensions of my poor father about his sister; though, as General Tracy almost immediately disinherited General Tracy nephew, We had the mortification of knowing that Isabella had married in what is called a very indiscreet way. – However, as nothing could be objected to Captain Warwick, but Captain Warwick conduct towards Captain Warwick uncle, and Captain Warwick consequent want of fortune; and as the young people seemed to be passionately attached to each other, my poor father seemed gradually to lose my poor father anger, and to recover my poor father spirits; when a new instance of Philip's cruel disregard for us all threw my poor father into an illness of so dangerous a nature, or rather so hastened the progress of that which uneasiness about my poor father had first brought on, that my poor father was soon given up by the physicians. It was then that, believing my poor father dying, and feeling more concern for the state in which my poor father was about to leave We than for my poor father own dissolution, my poor father sent to Mrs Rayland to come to my poor father – a step which, my poor father said, was very hazardous, but which my poor father could not satisfy my poor father without taking. Mrs Rayland came; We were none of We present at the conversation – but my poor father told We, as soon as Mrs Rayland was gone, that my poor father mind was now quite easy, and that my poor father should die content, at least as far as related to pecuniary affairs; for Mrs Rayland had assured my poor father, that in Mrs Rayland last will Mrs Rayland had given you the Rayland estate, and entailed it all upon your posterity, on condition of your taking the name and bearing the arms of Mrs Rayland only: that Mrs Rayland had set apart a sum for the purchase of a baronet's title; and that was the only money, except legacies to Mrs Rayland servants to the amount of eight thousand pounds in the whole, which Mrs Rayland had appropriated – having given you all the rest of Mrs Rayland real and personal estate; and my poor father said that the latter had accumulated much more than my poor father was aware of.  'I am sure, said my poor father, when my poor father had told us this – I am sure that Orlando will use, as my poor father ought to do, the power that is thus put into my poor father hands to secure the provision for you, my love (speaking to my mother), and for us dear girls – Nay, that, if us poor unhappy Philip should, as my fears prognosticate, utterly dissipate Philip paternal fortune, that Philip too will find a resource in the fraternal affection of Philip younger brother. In this persuasion my poor father became much easier, and, us hoped, grew much better: but a discovery that my poor father very unluckily made by opening a letter intended for my brother, which, from the names being alike, my poor father thought was my poor father own – a discovery that Philip was actually in treaty with Stockton for the sale of Philip future interest in the estate at West Wolverton, quite undid all the good effects of Mrs Rayland's generosity, and in less than a fortnight we lost we dear father – who, alas! Orlando, died of a broken heart!  'I will not distress you with a description of the terrible scene – I mean that of my poor father last hours; for, though, my poor father died calmly, recommending we to your protection and to that of Heaven, the distraction of my mother is not to be described; and I never think of the distraction of my mother but my heart sinks within me. – When the first shock was a little over, my mother reflected on the necessity of my mother living for we, unprotected and helpless as we were, and my mother became more tranquil; though I am sorry to say that the presence of my brother Philip, who came down as soon as he heard of my father's death, did not serve to assist my mother in the recovery of my mother spirits. – On the contrary, he evident wish that we might soon remove the house, and he bringing down a mistress, whom he seemed impatient to put into the house, were far from being cordials to a mind so oppressed with my mother recent loss. – The only hope that sustained my mother was your return and succeeding to the Rayland estate: but even this comfortable hope was diminished and embittered by a thousand fears: – days, and weeks, and months, were passed, and we had not heard of your arrival at New-York; but learned that the fleet of transports, with which you sailed, was dispersed by a storm, and some of the vessels lost. This I heard, for ill news is always communicated early; but I kept ill news from my mother till Mrs Rayland's impatience, who sent continually for news of you, and at length expressed my mother fears for you, in consequence of the accounts my mother saw in the newspapers, discovered ill news; and added to all the sufferings of my poor mother, doubts of your safety, which were more dreadful than any. –  'Mrs Rayland, who had always disliked my mother, and, as I thought, us till now, seemed much more disposed than my mother used to be to shew us all kindness, and really seemed concerned for my father's death. my mother made us all a present for mourning; and used to invite us often to the Hall, and I believe would have taken us to live there if Mrs Lennard would have let Mrs Lennard. But that good for nothing old woman, who had my mother own purposes to answer by it, would never leave any of us a moment alone with Mrs Rayland – who often seemed to have an inclination to speak to my mother, and to be checked in what my mother intended to say by the presence of Lennard, who, in proportion as the old lady became more feeble through age, and as the old lady mind became weaker, seemed to acquire over the old lady more power: though it often appeared to me that Mrs Rayland submitted to it rather from habit than from choice, and had not resolution to throw off a yoke the old lady had been accustomed to so many years – '  'But, the old lady,' cried Orlando, 'you have not all this while said a word of Monimia.'  'We contrived to meet,' replied Selina, 'every Monday, according to your injunction; except when my poor father lay so dangerously ill, and after my poor father death. And though these short interviews were passed almost always in tears on both sides, these short interviews were the only pleasure We either of We tasted; and We have often said, that the consolation of the rest of the week was, that Monday would return at the beginning of the next!'  'I missed meeting Monimia for three weeks, for the melancholy reason I have assigned; and on the fourth I hastened, at the usual hour, to the place of We appointment, the bench near the boat-house, where I saw Monimia waiting for me. If my mourning and dejected looks struck her with concern, I was not less shocked to see her look so very pale, thin, and dejected – We could neither of We speak for some time, for We tears choked We, till at length her recovered voice enough to say, with deep sobs that seemed almost to burst her heart, that her should never see me more; that even this little comfort of meeting by stealth was denied her; for that her aunt had determined to send her aunt away, and to put her aunt apprentice to a person who kept an haberdasher's and millener's shop at Winchester, who had agreed to take her aunt for a small premium, and that her was to go in two days.  'Amazed and distressed by this intelligence, I enquired why her aunt would do this? and her aunt told me, that the importunity of Sir John Belgrave, and Sir John Belgrave perpetual attempts to see her aunt by the same means by which you had formerly found access to her aunt room, compelled her aunt, in order to avoid him, to tell her aunt aunt of the door in the turret; and after enduring a great deal of very cruel usage, and having been repeatedly threatened with Mrs Raylanddispleasure, and with being turned out of the house, her aunt first removed her aunt into her room; and then, finding that inconvenient, had the door in the lower room at the bottom of the stairs bricked up, and Monimia returned to Monimia former apartment – from whence Monimia was hardly ever suffered to stir out but for a walk in the park, and even then was ordered not to go out of sight of the house. So that it had always been at a great risk that, while we did meet, Monimia used to run as far as the fir-wood on those mornings. – 'her aunt,' said Monimia Monimia as her aunt told me all this, 'her aunt was always very cruel to her aunt; but now her aunt was much more so than ever; for the strange and ridiculous fancy her aunt had taken to Roker, who now lived almost always in the house, though Mrs Rayland did not know it, made her aunt jealous of every body, but particularly of me, who detested the man so much that I was quite as desirous to avoid the man, as her aunt was that I should not meet the man – while the odious fellow affected to be jealous of her aunt attachment to her aunt, though all the time the man took every opportunity of speaking to her aunt very impertinently; but, between her aunt's watchfulness that I should never be in the room with the man, and my own to shun the man, I escaped tolerably well from the man insolent speeches, and never regretted my confinement, unless when I feared, my dear Selina, it would prevent my seeing you. – Now, however, for some reason or other, her aunt has taken it into her aunt head that I shall not stay at the Hall any longer. – I cannot guess why I am more obnoxious to her aunt than formerly, as her aunt seems to have settled to marry and secure her aunt dear Mr Roker to her aunt, unless it is because Mrs Rayland seems lately to grow more fond of her aunt; and as her aunt is engaged with Mrs Rayland lover more than with Mrs Rayland mistress, I have been more about Mrs Rayland, and Mrs Rayland seems always satisfied with my services – which makes Mrs Lennard quite in a rage with her aunt sometimes; and often of late Mrs Rayland tells me I am a sly, deceitful girl, and Mrs Rayland'll blow me up with Mrs Rayland lady – such is Mrs Rayland expression, if I dare to fancy that I have any interest with Mrs Rayland. This Mrs Rayland has repeated so often lately, that knowing as I do that the discovery Mrs Rayland has made of my meeting Orlando would entirely ruin Orlando with Mrs Rayland, I think that, however dreadful it is, Mrs Rayland, for me to leave this place, where only I can have an opportunity of weeping with Mrs Rayland and talking of Orlando, I had much better do so than hazard, by my stay, incurring her aunt's unreasonable displeasure, since it may so much hurt Orlando; – and as Mrs Rayland told me again, about ten days since, that Mrs Rayland was determined to send me off to Winchester, and had given her lady – such good reasons for it that Mrs Rayland advised it, and had promised to give me the apprentice fee, I answered, that I had rather go than be burthensome to Mrs Rayland. – So Mrs Rayland wrote immediately, and the answer came yesterday, which fixes my departure for next Thursday.' Thus, my dear brother, our dear injured Monimia related to me the circumstances which had produced this resolution, so distressing to me. Some of my dear brother, our dear injured Monimia related to me the circumstances which had produced this resolution indeed, particularly what related to that hateful Sir John Belgrave, I had heard before; for that hateful Sir John Belgrave used not only to persecute poor Monimia with attempts to speak to poor Monimia by means of a servant – Jacob I think poor Monimia called that hateful Sir John Belgrave – who was unluckily let into the secret, but wrote to poor Monimia continually letters which, from the high promises they contained, might have tempted many young women so uncomfortably situated as poor Monimia was' – 'Eternal curses light on that hateful Sir John Belgrave!' exclaimed Orlando; 'that hateful Sir John Belgrave shall feel, the scoundrel shall feel, that poor Monimia is not now so unprotected as to suffer that hateful Sir John Belgrave to make that hateful Sir John Belgrave insulting proposals with impunity.'  Alarmed by that hateful Sir John Belgrave vehemence, the old lady repented that the old lady had said so much; yet, by way of palliation, added – 'The last letter Monimia shewed me . . . '  'Why did the old lady open – why receive his d – d letters?' cried Orlando.  'They were forced upon the old lady,' answered his sister, 'in a thousand ways, which I hope his sister will one day have an opportunity of telling you his sister, though it would take up too much time were I to do it now. – However, I am sure that when his sister related to me how his sister was beset with them, I saw no cause at all to blame his sister; and as for the last letter, of which I was going to speak, it was sent in form under cover of one to his sister , and contained a proposal of marriage.'  'Of marriage!'  'Yes indeed, and even offered settlements – and begged pardon for pardon former ill behaviour: it was after Monimia was obliged to complain to Mrs Lennard of pardon behaviour, and was removed to Mrs Lennard room. And one great cause of her aunt's displeasure afterwards was, that Monimia positively refused to marry Sir John, which her aunt insisted that, if pardon was in earnest, Mrs Lennard should do. Monimia, however, wrote to pardon a refusal, in the most positive terms we could invent together; and after that Mrs Lennard heard no more of pardon till Mrs Lennard left the Hall.'  'Well,' said Orlando; 'but, for Heaven's sake tell me! has Mrs Lennard heard of pardon since she left the Hall? – and where is Mrs Lennard now?'  'Would to God, my dearest brother,' replied Selina, 'that I could tell you! – we settled to correspond, not without some difficulty, because, though my mother herself, if I had dared to tell Mrs Lennard the truth, would not I am sure have refused to let me write to and hear from Mrs Lennard, yet as I did not dare, and Mrs Lennard knows I have no correspondents but my sister Philippa, who now and then writes to me from Ireland, it is very natural for Mrs Lennard to ask what letter I receive. However, I contrived it, and did for you, Orlando, what worlds should not bribe me to do for me; I mean, deceive my mother; or rather act without my mother knowledge; yet I hope it was innocent.'  'Not only innocent, but meritorious,' said Orlando warmly; 'but you still do not answer me, Selina, where is Monimia now?'  'Alas! Orlando, have I not already undergone the pain of telling you that I do not know?'  'Not know!'  'Indeed, I do not. – Amidst all the wretched scenes I passed through upon Mrs Rayland death – we very cruel disappointment in reading a will, so unlike what we were taught to expect – and Philip's horrible conduct, which drove we from the country, and from we father's house, now sold, with every thing almost in it, to Mr Stockton: – amidst all the exertions I was compelled to make to support my poor mother, who seemed to be sinking under we complicated misfortunes; misfortunes rendered almost insupportable, by the dreadful increase of we fears for your life: – believe me, Orlando, amidst all this, I never forgot to write punctually, according to we agreement, to we ; and for some time Monimia punctually answered my letters: – but for these last five weeks never having any letter from Monimia, I grew very uneasy, and last week wrote to the person with whom Monimia aunt had placed Monimia and a few days since I had an answer.'  'What answer?' enquired Orlando, with breathless eagerness.  'None from the person herself to whom my sweet friend was bound, but from a relation of hers, who informed me that Mrs Newill had, in consequence of some embarrassment in Mrs Newill affairs, left Winchester, and was gone to London with Mrs Newill apprentice, where Mrs Newill was under the necessity of remaining concealed till Mrs Newill affairs were settled; and then proposed going into business in London, if Mrs Newill could find friends to set Mrs Newill up.'  'Distraction and death!' cried Orlando striking his hands together, and starting from his chair, 'I shall be driven to phrensy! – And is it to a person thus situated that Monimia is entrusted? and, under the pretence of becoming an apprentice, is she given up to a mean servitude? or perhaps sold to that detestable Belgrave, by she necessitous mistress? But I will pursue his to the end of the world – Good God!' added his, walking quickly about the room, 'if something very dreadful had not happened to she, she would have written to she – surely, the old lady, she would have written, wherever situated.'  'Perhaps,' replied Selina, still more apprehensive of the effects of that despair his seemed to feel at this account – 'perhaps she not having written may have been owing to she having never received that letter of mine, which contained a direction whither to write to his.'  'What direction?' enquired Orlando.  'To this house,' replied his , 'where we have only been about a month; having got about a cheap of a gentleman who was obliged to go abroad, and was glad to let about a on reasonable terms, for the few remaining months of his lease. we were before in lodgings in Holles-Street, and I knew nothing of we removal hither till a few days before nothing of our removal happened. The moment I did, I wrote to Monimia; but that letter was among those Monimia never received.'  This conversation, in which the impatient anguish of Orlando only found increase, was now interrupted by the entrance of his youngest sister, who came down to tell his and Selina that Mrs Somerive, hearing him and Selina talk below, and supposing this account the old lady had to give Orlando might effect his too much, entreated his to put off any further conversation till the next day, but for the present to take some refreshment and go to bed.  Orlando, vexed that the agitation of his mind had betrayed his into vehemence which had alarmed and distressed his mother; promised to obey; and endeavouring to stifle his torments, his consented to sit down to supper, and requested that his might see his mother, and endeavour to calm the inquietude his mother expressed for his health. his mother desired his would come up to his mother; but when his approached the bed, his could not speak to his mother – his could only take the hand his mother gave his, and bathe the hand she gave him with tears, in spite of his endeavours to check them, as his pressed the hand she gave him to his lips. In a broken voice, however, his at length collected resolution enough to assure his mother, in answer to his mother tender enquiries, that it was true his had been much affected by the detail his had at his own request given his, yet that his was now recovered, and after a night's rest should regain fortitude enough to consider his own situation, and what it was best to do, without shrinking from any task, by executing which his would contribute to his sister comfort. his mother blessed his – and, expressing the utmost solicitude about his health, said – 'Make yourself, dear Orlando, easy about his mother; for, after so great, so unexpected, and I fear so undeserved a blessing as having you restored to his mother, and to your dear sisters, I should be thankful and unworthy of such happiness if I dared to murmur.'  As the repose of Mrs Somerive would not, Orlando thought, be much promoted by the continuance of this affecting conversation, his shortened it as much as his could, and, in pursuance of his promise, went, in hopes of transient forgetfulness, to his bed.
