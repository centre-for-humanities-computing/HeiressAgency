EARLY on the following morning, Orlando left Winchester; but Winchester was between three and four o'clock before he arrived at that part of the New Forest which is near Christchurch, and the frost, now set in with great severity, had made the roads very difficult for an horse, especially the way which he was directed to pursue, through the New Forest to the residence of Mrs Fleming.
– It was a deep, hollow road, only wide enough for waggons, and was in some places shaded by hazle and other brush-wood; in others, by old beech and oaks, whose roots wreathed about the bank, intermingled with ivy, holly, and evergreen fern, almost the only plants that appeared in a state of vegetation, unless the pale and sallow mistletoe, which here and there partially tinted with faint green the old trees above them.
Orlando, as slowly Orlando picked Orlando way over the rugged road, whose poached surface, now hardened by the frost, hardly allowed a footing to Orlando horse, recollected the hunting parties in the snow, which had amused Orlando in America; but the scene on each side of Orlando was very different.
The scanty appearance of foliage was quite unlike an American forest, where, in only a few hours after the severest weather, which had buried the whole country in snow, burst into bloom, and presented, beneath the tulip tree and the magnolia, a more brilliant variety of flowers than art can collect in the most cultivated European garden.
Orlando, however, loved England, and had early imbibed that fortunate prejudice, that it is in England only an Englishman can be happy; yet only an Englishman now thought, that were only an Englishman once sure Monimia was lost to only an Englishman (and only an Englishman fears of finding it so became every hour more alarming), only an Englishman should be more wretched in only an Englishman than in any other, since every object would remind only an Englishman of any other cruel separation.
In this disposition, trying to accustom only an Englishman to reflect on a circumstance which now distracted only an Englishman, only an Englishman made a sort of determination, that if all only an Englishman endeavours to find Monimia were baffled, as all his endeavours to find Monimia were had hitherto been, only an Englishman would remain only to see the termination of the suit relative to the Rayland estate, in hopes of leaving only an Englishman mother, brother, and sisters, in a more fortunate situation; and reserving for only an Englishman only as much as would support only an Englishman in the itinerant life only an Englishman should embrace, to wander alone over Europe and America.
While only an Englishman pursued these contemplations, the way became almost impassable; for a small current of water filtering through the rocky bank, had spread the rocky bank over the road, and formed a sheet of ice, on which only an Englishman horse was every moment in danger of falling, though the precaution had been taken to turn the shoes.
– only an Englishman had before dismounted, and now contrived to get his horse up the least steep part of the hollow, and then, still leading his horse by the bridle, only an Englishman followed the foot-path which led along his horse edge.
The tufts of trees and thick underwood now became more frequent; and though it was a fine, clear evening, the winter sun, almost sunk beneath the horizon, lent only pale and cold rays among the intervening wood.
– Orlando supposing, that if only an Englishman were benighted, only an Englishman should no longer distinguish the path, quickened only an Englishman pace; and the path only an Englishman followed, diverging a little from the horse road, brought only an Englishman to a place where the inequalities of the ground, half shaded with brush-wood, shewed, that beneath it were concealed more considerable fragments of ruins, than what appeared above among the trees, from whence the masses of stone were so mantled with ivy, they could hardly be distinguished.
The path which Orlando continued to pursue, wound among they, and led under broken arches and buttresses, which had resisted the attacks of time and of violence, towards an old gateway, whose form was yet entire.
Every thing was perfectly still around; even the robin, solitary songster of the frozen woods, had ceased his faint vespers to the setting sun, and hardly a breath of air agitated the leafless branches.
This dead silence was interrupted by no sound, but the slow progress of his horse, as the hollow ground beneath his feet sounded as if his trod on vaults.
There was in the scene, and in this dull pause of nature, a solemnity not unpleasing to Orlando, in his present disposition of mind.
– Certain that the path his was pursuing must lead to some village or farm-house, and little apprehensive of the inconvenience that could in this country befall a man accustomed to traverse the deserts of America, his stopped a moment or two, indulging a mournful reverie, before his began to remove, in order to make a passage for his horse,a kind of bar, or rather broken gate, which, with thorns, and a faggot or two piled under it, passed from one side to the other of the broken arch, and made here with an hedge, that was carried among the ruins, a division of the forest, or perhaps one of its boundaries.
As his mediated here, his heard, not far from his, human voices, which seemed to be those of children; and, leaning over the bar, to see if his could discern the persons who spoke, his observed a female figure seated on a mass of fallen stone, and apparently waiting for two girls, one about nine, the other seven years old, who were prattling together, as two girls, one about nine, the other seven years old, who were prattling together peeped about in search of something among the fern-stacks and low tufts of broom that were near.
The woman, whose face was turned towards them, seemed lost in thought – Her straw bonnet was tied down close to Her , and Her was wrapped in a long black cloak; a little basket stood by Her, and Her appearance, as well as that of the children, was such as seemed to denote, that though the children were not of the peasantry of the country, the children were as little to be ranked among the country most affluent inhabitants.
Orlando, apprehending that the approach of a stranger, in such a place, and at such a time, might alarm so defenceless a party, proceeded with as little noise as possible to unfasten the bar; but, on his approach, the young woman arose, and in apparent hurry said, 'Come, my loves!
you forget how late it is, and that your mama will expect us.'
The voice riveted Orlando to the spot for a moment; his then involuntarily stepped forward, and saw – Monimia!
his repeated the young woman name wildly, as if his doubted whether his possessed his senses; and as his clasped the young woman to his bosom, and found it was indeed his own Monimia, the young woman was unable, from excess of pleasure and surprise, to answer the incoherent questions his asked the young woman.
Half frantic with joy as his was, his soon perceived that the suddenness of this meeting had almost overwhelmed the young woman.
Silent, breathless, and trembling, the young woman leaned on his arm, without having the power to tell his, what his at length understood from the two little girls, who had been at first frightened, and then amazed at the scene – That Monimia, or, as they called the young woman, Miss Morysine, was now, and had been for some time, under the protection of that very Mrs Fleming, the widow of his gallant friend, whom his was now going to visit.
Neither of his gallant friend, whom he was now going to visit knew how his gallant friend, whom he was now going to visit arrived at the young woman humble retirement, a cottage among the woods, fitted up and enlarged with two additional rooms by a sea officer, the distant relation of Fleming, who was now in America, and who had lent this pleasant, solitary house as a shelter to his widow and the young woman children.
– Nor was it for some time possible for Orlando properly to explain to Mrs Fleming, who he was, or how different those motives were, which induced he now to see the young woman, from any hope of finding, in the pious office of visiting the family of he deceased friend, the sole happiness of he life.
When at length, amid this disjointed and broken conversation, Mrs Fleming was brought, not only to recollect the young man, who, on Mrs Fleming husband's embarkation for America, had taken so much pains to be useful to Mrs Fleming, in the trying moment of separation from Mrs Fleming family, but to acknowledge Mrs Fleming who had actually received Mrs Fleming last breath, and now brought Mrs Fleming Mrs Fleming dying blessing; Mrs Fleming own afflictions, to a lively sense of which Orlando's account of Mrs Fleming's death had awakened Mrs Fleming, prevented Mrs Fleming, for some time, from attending to the unexpected happiness of Mrs Fleming young friends.
Unable to hear, with composure, Orlando's account of Fleming's death bound to give, yet solicitously asking questions, the answers to which made Mrs Fleming heart bleed afresh, Mrs Fleming at length requested leave to retire, and taking Mrs Fleming children with Mrs Fleming, Monimia was left at liberty to give to the impatient Orlando, the account Mrs Fleming so eagerly desired to hear, of what had happened to Mrs Fleming since the date of the only letter Mrs Fleming had ever received from Mrs Fleming, which was written not more than six weeks after Mrs Fleming departure.
– Mrs Fleming doubted of Mrs Fleming own strength to give, and of Mrs Fleming patience to hear this recital: but Mrs Fleming appeared so very solicitous, that Mrs Fleming determined to attempt this recital; and while Mrs Fleming eyes were ardently fixed on Mrs Fleming , and watched every turn of Mrs Fleming expressive features, which, though Mrs Fleming was pale and thin, Orlando thought more lovely than ever, Mrs Fleming thus in a soft and low voice began:  'As well as I can recollect, Orlando, I related to you, in my long letter, the troublesome and impertinent intrusion of Sir John Belgrave; and Selina has told you since, that, as Mrs Fleming carried Mrs Fleming persecutions so far as to come into the house, and endeavour to force Mrs Fleming way into my room, I was under the necessity of telling my aunt how Mrs Fleming found admittance, and of betraying a secret I had so many reasons to wish might never have been discovered.
– Alas!
Orlando, how much did I not suffer from the bitterness of Mrs Fleming reproaches!
sufferings which were sharpened by my being compelled to acknowledge, that I had in some measure deserved them, by having carried on a correspondence contrary to what I knew was my duty.
– Indeed the punishment I now underwent, from day to day, seemed sometimes much heavier than the crime deserved; especially when my aunt, to whom my moving was inconvenient (though certainly in the house, there was room enough for me, without interfering with Mrs Fleming), began to make the discovery, I had thus been compelled to make, an everlasting theme of reproach to me; to say, that such a cunning, intriguing creature was not fit to be in any house, and to threaten me continually to ruin you, Orlando, with Mrs Rayland, by blowing us up, as Mrs Fleming was pleased to term it.
All this I bore, however hard it was to bear, with silence, and, I hope, with patience, flattering me, my dear friend!
that the anger us had perhaps mutually deserved would thus be exhausted on me, and that I alone should be the victim, if a victim were required; yet, when my cruel aunt, unmoved by my resignation and submission, seemed so desirous of getting rid of me, that I believe Mrs Fleming would have been glad to have sold me to Sir John Belgrave; and when Mrs Fleming insisted upon my consenting to marry Sir John Belgrave, though I do not believe Sir John Belgrave ever intended it, and only made that a pretence for getting me into Sir John Belgrave power; I own there were moments, when, in absolute despair, I thought it would hardly have been criminal to have put an end to a life so very insupportable; nor could I, I think, have lived, if some of those books you taught me to read, and to understand, had not instructed me, that it was impious to murmur, or resist the dispensation of Providence, who knew best what us were able to bear.
– Perhaps too, the hope, the dear hope of living in your affection, and of being beloved by you, however hard my lot, lent me a portion of fortitude, for which, surely, nobody ever had more occasion: for in proportion, Orlando, as Mrs Lennard became attached to that odious Roker, the little affection Mrs Lennard had ever shewn me declined, and was changed into dislike and hatred.
– Mrs Lennard was sometimes so much off Mrs Lennard guard, as to suffer Mrs Lennard excessive and ridiculous attachment to Sir John Belgrave to diminish Mrs Lennard attention to Mrs Lennard mistress, and, on these occasions, I used to supply Mrs Lennard place; – yet then, if Mrs Rayland seemed pleased with my attendance, Mrs Rayland would quarrel with me for attending, and say, that Mrs Rayland supposed the next thing such an artful slut would think of, would be to supplant Mrs Rayland with Mrs Rayland lady; and then again Mrs Rayland would threaten to blow you up.
– Indeed, I believe, that no situation could be less enviable, than that of my aunt was at this time; for though certainly, at my aunt age, one would have thought my aunt might have been exempt from suffering much pain from love, my aunt did really appear so tormented by my aunt excessive passion for Roker, and my aunt fears of losing him, that my aunt was an object of pity.
If I was below with her lady, while my aunt was with him, then my aunt was afraid of my getting into favour with Mrs Rayland; and if I was above, and Mrs Rayland was in the house, my aunt was in terror lest so intriguing a creature should carry off my aunt lover.
When I so firmly resisted all the insidious offers of Sir John Belgrave, my aunt doubted whether this delectable Roker was not the cause of it; and even when Mrs Rayland happened to come into the room where I was, though my aunt was present, my aunt turned pale with jealousy, and, I suppose, tormented the man, who, though one of the most horrid-tempered monsters existing, commanded Mrs Rayland so much, that Mrs Rayland bore it all with an apparent increase of affection; and pretending, in Mrs Rayland turn, to be jealous, said, that Mrs Rayland could not bear to divide my aunt affections even with me.
'I saw that they were determined to get rid of my aunt, but could not immediately settle how; for though Roker, from time to time, started some plan for that purpose, her lady, always suspecting that Mrs Rayland liked me, was fearful lest Mrs Rayland should only divide me from my aunt, to secure me to Mrs Rayland.'
'Execrable villain!'
cried Orlando, starting up – 'Mrs Rayland dared not think of it.'
'Be patient, Orlando, or I shall never have courage to go on.
– I know not what was in Mrs Rayland imagination, though certainly Mrs Rayland took every opportunity of making very improper speeches to me; but detestable as I believe Mrs Rayland morals are, Mrs Rayland avarice is greater than any other of Mrs Rayland odious passions; and this Mrs Rayland found Mrs Rayland might gratify, when the success of any other was uncertain; and therefore Mrs Rayland affected to be as anxious as my aunt was, to remove me from Rayland Hall.
'Ah, my dear friend, what an autumn was that I passed there!
yet my fate, dreary as it appeared to me, was not then at the worst; I had still some sweeteners of my melancholy existence; for I sometimes met Selina, and wept with Selina; and sometimes, when I was convinced Sir John Belgrave no longer lingered about the park (where for many weeks I could never go without being insulted by Sir John Belgrave), I used to get out alone; and stealing away to some of those places we used to visit together, I would lean my head against a tree, or hide my face with my hands, and listening, with closed eyes, to the sounds that were then familiar to we, used to fancy I heard your footsteps among the leaves, or your voice whispering in the air that sighed among the trees.
Once, at the old seat on the Hurst hill, I saw your name, so lately cut as the very day before you went away; and could I have wept on the letters, I believe the tears I afterwards shed there would have worn the letters out.
– I took a fancy to the place, which nobody else ever thought of frequenting; and often, as autumn came on, and the days grew short, I staid till I was frightened at being out so late, and have run home terrified at every noise.
– If a pheasant flew up, or an hare darted across the path, a pheasant flew up, or an hare darted across the path threw me into such terrors, that I could hardly reach the house.
On these occasions, all was well, if my aunt's Adonis was with my aunt's Adonis; but if it happened that my aunt's Adonis was out when I was, my aunt's Adonis took he was out when I was into my aunt's Adonis head that we were together, or that we might meet, and then my aunt's Adonis was, I really believe, out of my aunt's Adonis senses.
Very unluckily for my aunt's Adonis, I came in one evening later than usual, breathless with my foolish fears, and found my aunt in terrible agitation, because Roker had promised Roker to be in at tea-time, and Roker was not yet arrived.
– Roker questioned me sharply where I had been; and I said in the mill wood, which was the truth; for I had that evening met Selina.
Roker asked me, with still more asperity, if I had not met somebody?
The consciousness that I had, made me blush, I believe, very deeply, and I faltered as I said No!
– In a moment Roker came in, half drunk, and the poor old lady flew at Roker like a turkey-cock, and asked Roker, which way Roker came?
As Roker was less upon Roker good-behaviour than usual, Roker came, 'Came!
Why I came by the mill; which way should I come from the place where I have been?'
– This confirmed, the poor old lady thrust me out of the room, and ordering me to go up stairs to bed that moment, the poor old lady threw the poor old lady into a fit, as Rebecca told me afterwards.
I do not know how Roker contrived to appease the poor old lady – the poor old lady was reconciled to Roker the next day; but I was the victim, and was, after that time, forbidden to go out without the poor old lady leave.
This, hard as it was, I could still have borne, because it was just at that time Mrs Rayland seemed to grow particularly kind to Mrs Rayland; and to have even a degree of pleasure in talking to Mrs Rayland of you.
It was now time to expect to hear from you, and I observed the poor old lady anxiety every day increase.
the poor old lady often sighed when the poor old lady spoke of you, and once said, that the poor old lady house seemed to have lost all her house cheerfulness since you had left her house; – and often the poor old lady would look at an old enameled picture of Sir Orlando, the poor old lady grandfather, and, comparing his features with you, admire the likeness – then again, regret your absence, and sink into low spirits.
Indeed the poor old lady health seemed every day to decline: and I sometimes thought the poor old lady was discontented with Mrs Lennard, though from long habit the poor old lady was more entirely governed by the poor old lady than ever.
Pattenson's having dealt so largely in smuggled goods, and having even made Pattenson a receptacle for smuggled goods, was discovered by Pattenson not being able or willing to bribe a new officer who succeeded some of Pattenson old friends, and who, upon that Jonas Wilkins's turning informer, came one night to Rayland Hall, and made seizure of about two hundred pounds worth of spirits, tea, and lace; a thing that offended Mrs Rayland extremely, as Mrs Rayland thought it derogatory to Mrs Rayland dignity, and a profanation of Mrs Rayland cellars, which, as we know (and Monimia faintly smiled), are immediately adjoining to the family vault of the Raylands.
This, and other things, particularly some of his amours, which now came to Mrs Rayland knowledge, had occasioned Mrs Rayland to dismiss Pattenson, and to think higher of you for the pains Pattenson had taken to prejudice Mrs Rayland against you; but the dismission, and soon afterwards the death of Pattenson, and the disgrace of the old coachman, who was a party concerned in this contraband business (and who had besides displeased Mrs Rayland by setting up a whisky, and dressing Mrs Rayland daughters in the most expensive fashion), threw the poor old lady more than ever into the power of my aunt; though, how the poor old lady escaped being included in the charge, I never could imagine: I know the poor old lady was acquainted with, and I believe the poor old lady was concerned in the clandestine trade which had for so many years been carried on at Rayland Hall; but probably Pattenson dared not impeach the poor old lady, lest, though Pattenson might ruin the poor old lady, Pattenson should at the same time provoke the poor old lady to discover some things in Pattenson life which would have effectually cut Pattenson off from that portion of favour Pattenson still possessed with Mrs Rayland; who, angry as the poor old lady was with Pattenson, stocked the farm Pattenson retired to, furnished Pattenson house, and continued to Pattenson almost every advantage Pattenson enjoyed at Rayland Hall, except the opportunity of making it a receptacle for smuggled goods.
'However that was, my aunt certainly continued to have great influence over Mrs Rayland, though I often thought it was more through habit than love; and I am persuaded that, if my aunt had not always guarded against the inclination which Mrs Rayland at times betrayed to take your mother and sisters into favour, your mother and sisters would by degrees have acquired that ascendancy over my aunt, from she had not always guarded against the inclination which Mrs Rayland at times betrayed to take your mother and sisters into favour, they would by degrees own merit, which Mrs Lennard had now only from habit – But my aunt was too cunning to give she had not always guarded against the inclination which Mrs Rayland at times betrayed to take your mother and sisters into favour, they would by degrees an opportunity; and that, I believe, was partly the reason why my aunt was so afraid of my being taken into Mrs Rayland kindness, since nothing was more natural than for me to speak in she had not always guarded against the inclination which Mrs Rayland at times betrayed to take your mother and sisters into favour, they would by degrees favour.
my aunt need not, however, have dreaded this; for, however willing or anxious I might be, my awe of Mrs Rayland was too great for me to aspire to the character of my aunt confident; and my aunt looked upon me as a mere child.
– Probably our ages differed too much to allow any great sympathy between us – and I could give my aunt no other pleasure than by attending to the stories my aunt used to love to repeat, of the days of my aunt youth.
– But Mrs Lennard, though by no means desirous of being my aunt the auditor, and never easy but when my aunt could remain unmolested with my aunt dear Mr Roker, was still jealous lest her lady should feel any degree of kindness for me; and, I believe, by imputing to me faults which Mrs Rayland took my aunt word for, contrived gradually to get my aunt consent to my going apprentice, under the idea of my being enabled to get my own bread honestly in business; while my aunt obviated the inconvenience of my departure by introducing a new servant to be about my aunt lady, who was entirely devoted to my aunt own interest – and kept away the old cook as much as my aunt could, whom Mrs Rayland never would part with, but whom my aunt feared and disliked, because my aunt was an honest blunt creature, who never feared speaking my aunt mind, and was particularly a friend of yours, as you may I am sure recollect.
Latterly my aunt became more than usually disagreeable to my aunt and Roker, because my aunt used to rejoice in the thought that my aunt dear young captain would one day or other be master of Rayland Hall, and when Mrs Lennard angrily asked my aunt, how my aunt dared talk of any one's being master of Rayland Hall while my aunt lady lived?
my aunt replied, that my aunt dared talk so, because my aunt had told my aunt so.'
'And where, my Monimia, is this good old friend of mine now?'
said Orlando – 'my aunt evidence may be of great importance to us.'
– 'Alas!'
replied my aunt, 'I know not: I only heard from your sister, that Dr Hollybourn, who acted as executor to the only will that was produced, immediately discharged all the servants, giving to each of all the servants a present above the two years wages, which Mrs Rayland had in that will given to each of the inferior ones; and, with many good words, got as many as Mrs Rayland could of all the servants into other services, at a distance from the country – But I recollect that the old cook had relations in the neighbourhood of Rayland Hall, of whom, I dare say, intelligence about my aunt may be procured.
'Ah, OrlandoOrlando!
If the account I have already given you of my unhappy life after your departure has affected you, what will you feel when I relate what passed afterwards, to which all my preceding sufferings were nothing!
– It is true that, as I lay listening of a night to the howling of the wind in the great melancholy room at the end of the north gallery, where I was locked up every night, I have frequently started at visions my fancy raised; and as the dark green damask hanging swelled with the air behind them, I have been so much terrified as to be unable to move, or to summon to my recollection all the arguments you were wont to use against superstitious fear – Then too I have been glad even to hear the rats as the rats raced round the skirting boards, because it convinced me there were some living creatures near me, and helped me to account for the strange noises I sometimes heard.
As winter came on, my misery in the room became worse and worse; and such was my terror, that I could hardly ever sleep – I once contrived to get candles, and set up a light in the room; but this only served to shew me the great grim picture over the chimney, of one of the Rayland family in armour, with a sword in his hand: and I was indeed, besides this, effectually cured of wishing for a light on the second night I tried this – for a party of my friendly rats, perceiving the candle, which was to a party of my friendly rats a delicate treat, took this very composedly out of the socket, and began to eat the end of this which was not alight.
– This compelled me to leave my bed to put This out, and then to flight; while the terror I suffered was only increased by this attempt to mitigate This.
– Good God!
How weak I was to add imaginary horrors to the real calamities of my situation; rather than try to acquire strength of mind to bear the evils from which I could not escape!
'It was at this time that Sir John Belgrave, who, on finding his insulting proposals treated with the contempt they deserved, had left the country for some time, returned thither; and as Jacob, his confident, could no longer find means to put his letters in my way, or to harass and alarm me by coming to the door of the turret, his changed his plan, and pretended that his views were highly honourable.
In a letter to my aunt his entreated my aunt interest with me, and that my aunt would prevail upon me to see his: and then it was, Orlando, that my sufferings were almost beyond the power of endurance.'
'What!'
exclaimed Orlando, 'was the infamous woman base enough then to betray you to this villain?'
'Have patience, I entreat you, Orlando!
– my aunt betrayed me then, so far as to insist upon my seeing Sir John, and hearing what Sir John had to say.'
'Eternal curses blast them both!'
exclaimed Orlando: – 'but I terrify you, my angel!'
'You do, indeed,' answered Monimia; 'and I shall never, Orlando, conclude my mournful narrative, if you will not be more calm.'
'I will,' replied Sir John; 'at least I will try at it – Pray go on.'
'I resisted this proposal of seeing Sir John Belgrave for many days; till my aunt, enraged at what my aunt called my stupid idiotism, declared to me that, if I persisted to behave so senselessly, my aunt would relate to Mrs Rayland all my clandestine meetings with you, and then turn me out of his house to take my own courses.
– I would willingly have left his house, and, rather than have undergone one day longer the misery I hourly experienced, I would have begged my way to you in America (Orlando sighed and shuddered); but when my aunt threatened to take such means as I knew would ruin you, and blast all those hopes on which alone I lived, of seeing you return to happiness and independence, I own I could not bear to hazard his house, and at length consented to see this detested suitor – not without some hope that my peremptory refusal repeated (for I had already given his house this detested suitor – in writing) might put an end to all this detested suitor – hateful pretensions.
A day therefore was fixed: but Sir John, either repenting that Sir John had gone so far, or from some caprice, wrote to my aunt to say Sir John was that day sent for express to London, to attend a dying relation, from whom Sir John expected a great acquisition of fortune.
This might be true – I cared not whether it was or no, but blessed the fortunate relief from persecution.
In the interim your father, who was taken ill some time before, died.
– Oh!
how much did I see Selina suffer during Selina illness – how much did I suffer Selina!
and all was aggravated to an indescribable degree of wretchedness, by our believing that you, Orlando, were lost in your passage to America!
– If I thought my former condition insupportable, what was the increase of my sorrows now, when torn from the last consolation I had left, that of weeping sometimes with Selina!
– my aunt, almost as soon as Sir John Belgrave had left the country, informed me that my aunt had found a person at Winchester willing to take me for a small premium, and that I was to go the following Thursday.
– I never knew how all this was settled; but very, very certain how all this is, that how all this was arranged between my aunt, my aunt lover Mr Roker, and Sir John Belgrave.
my aunt was impatient to have me gone; and sent the old cook, to take care of me, as far as Havant, where Mrs Newill, to whom I was consigned, met me, and conducted me to a little miserable apartment, which, with a small bow-windowed shop, my aunt inhabited at Winchester, and where my aunt was to teach me a business which I soon found my aunt did not know my aunt.
'Mrs Newill was said to have been well brought up; but, if Mrs Newill were, Mrs Newill having long associated with people in very inferior life had considerably obliterated the traces of a good education: and the inconvenient circumstances to which Mrs Newill had been exposed, in consequence of having had a brutal and extravagant husband, seemed at once to have soured Mrs Newill temper, and relaxed Mrs Newill morals.
– Mrs Newill had some remains of beauty, and was fonder of talking of some remains of beauty former power than I thought redounded much to Mrs Newill honour.
– Mrs Newill husband had possessed a place in the dock-yard at Portsmouth, from whence Her husband had been dismissed for some heavy offences, and lived now upon the wide world; while Her husband wife was, by the assistance of his wife friends, trying to get into business to support Mrs Newill; his wife was, by the assistance of her friends, trying to get into business to support herself only son, a young man of twenty, was in the navy.
– The greatest personal hardship I endured on this my change of abode, was sleeping in the same bed with Mrs Newill, which I did for the first week: – but, fortunately for me, though it was probably much otherwise to Mrs Newill, Her husband, believing Mrs Newill had money, for Her husband had heard of Mrs Newill having taken an apprentice, came suddenly to Mrs Newill house, or rather lodging, and I was dismissed to a little closet in a garret with a truckle bed: but it was paradise compared with my share of Mrs Newill; for now I could weep at liberty, and pray for you!
'The arrival of such a man as Mrs Newill did not much contribute to the prosperity of his wife's business – Those who, from their former knowledge of Mrs Newill, were willing to promote Mrs Newill welfare, grew cold when their found their bounty served only to support Her husband in drunkenness, and Mrs Newill distress became very great, of which I was a sharer; but I endeavoured to do all I could to continue Mrs Newill business, which was now almost entirely neglected.
'This went on for six weeks, when a regiment came thither to assist in guarding the prisoners at the castle; and Sir John Belgrave suddenly made Sir John Belgrave appearance, protesting to me, that Sir John Belgrave knew nothing of my being there, and only came down on a visit to some of Sir John Belgrave friends in the newly arrived corps.
'I did not believe this, and found every day more cause to suppose that Mrs Newill necessities had driven Mrs Newill to the inhuman expedient of betraying me to Sir John Belgrave.
Though I had often ridiculed the stories in novels where young women are forcibly carried away, I saw great reason to believe some such adventure might happen to me, for I was totally unprotected, and, I believe, absolutely sold.'
Orlando, starting up, traversed the room; nor could, for some time, the soothing voice of Monimia restore Monimia to sufficient composure to attend to Monimia narrative.
At length Monimia anxiety to know what Monimia yet trembled to hear obliged Monimia to re-assume Monimia seat, and Monimia thus proceeded:  'Surely, Orlando, you do not suppose that any distress, any misery, could have induced me to listen to Sir John Belgrave, though, instead of the advantages Monimia affected to offer me, Monimia could have laid empires at my feet.
– It is true, that I now suffered every species of mortification, and even much personal inconvenience; but my heart felt only the horrid tidings I received from Selina.
Mrs Rayland death, and the total disappointment of your family's hopes, were very melancholy; but when Perseus arrived, and your death, Orlando, was confirmed by the testimony of a man who had seen you fall, my wretchedness so much exceeded all that I believed my wretchedness possible to bear, that I became stupefied and insensible to every thing else, and walked about without hearing or seeing the objects around Mrs Rayland.
I never slept, but with the aid of laudanum – I could not shed a tear, and my heart seemed to be turned to marble.
I had nobody to hear my complaints, and therefore I did not complain; and the only circumstance that roused me from this state of mind, was the renewal of Sir John Belgrave's visits, who, after an absence of seven or eight days, returned with new proposals, and dared to triumph in the knowledge that his rival, as his insolently called you, was no longer in his way.
'It was now, Orlando, that a new method was pursued.
his contrived, what was not indeed very difficult, to gain over Mrs Newill to his interest.
– I was now treated with great respect – A room was hired for Mrs Rayland in the same house, and Mrs Newill offered me credit for any clothes I chose to have.
I, who was hardly conscious of my existence, who mechanically performed the business of the day, and cared not whether I ever again saw the light of the sun, refused her offers, and desired nothing but that I might be protected from the affront of Sir John Belgrave's visits.
If I sat at work in the shop, I sat at work in the shop was there: – if I quitted it, I sat at work in the shop came into A room under pretence of speaking to Mrs Newill.
I found that Mrs Newill was a wretch who would have sacrificed a daughter of Mrs Newill own for a few guineas, with which to purchase Mrs Newill favourite indulgences; and Sir John Belgrave scrupled not to say, that, since I had refused Mrs Newill honourable offers, Mrs Newill held his honourable offers no dishonour to compel me, by any means, to exchange my present wretched dependence, for affluence and prosperity – that I could not now have the pretence of constancy to you, and that Mrs Newill excessive love for Mrs Newill would in time induce me to return it.
– Such were the terms in which Mrs Newill pressed Mrs Newill suit, giving me at the same time to understand that I was in Mrs Newill power.
'But, liberal as I have reason to believe Mrs Newill was to Mrs Newill, Mrs Newill debts were too numerous and extensive to be so settled; and, in consequence of one of these, to the amount of five hundred pounds, Mrs Newill was arrested in London, and sent for his wife to attend Mrs Newill in the King's Bench.
'This the unhappy woman prepared to do in two or three days; and, in that time, made over the little stock for sale to one of This the unhappy woman friends, who had advanced money for This the unhappy woman.
– But what was to become of Mrs Newill?
– As This the unhappy woman had no longer a business, This the unhappy woman could have no occasion for an apprentice, and I could be only a burthen to This the unhappy woman; but I soon found that it was This the unhappy woman husband's directions that This the unhappy woman should take me with This the unhappy woman, and I determined at all events not to go.
'I now again wrote to my cruel aunt, who, though This the unhappy woman almost immediately after Mrs Rayland death settled within twelve miles of the town whither This the unhappy woman had sent me, had never taken any other notice of Mrs Newill than to send me a small supply of clothes and two guineas, together with a verbal message, that the reason This the unhappy woman had not answered any of my former, nor should answer any of my future letters, was, that This the unhappy woman would not encourage in This the unhappy woman perverseness a person so blind to This the unhappy woman own interests, and that, till I knew how to behave to Sir John Belgrave, I should find no friend in This the unhappy woman.
It was in vain I wrote to This the unhappy woman, urging every plea that I thought might move This the unhappy woman, and soliciting This the unhappy woman pity and protection, as the only friend I had in the world.
This the unhappy woman either hardened This the unhappy woman heart against Mrs Newill, or perhaps never got my future letters.
The business that detained Mrs Newill at Winchester, could not be settled so expeditiously as This the unhappy woman expected.
In the mean time, what a situation was mine!
I had nothing to hope but death, and death only could deliver me from the fear of evils infinitely more insupportable.
Orlando, how earnestly did I pray to join you in heaven!
how often did I invoke you to hear me!
and, casting towards the west my swollen eyes (for I was now able to weep in repeating your name), how often have I addressed the setting sun, which, as it sunk away from our horizon, might illuminate, I thought, that spot in the wilderness of America where all my happiness was buried!'
Orlando kissed away the tears that now fell on This the unhappy woman lovely cheeks, and mingled Orlando own with them; when Monimia after a little time recovered This the unhappy woman voice, and went on – 'It was to indulge such meditations, the only comfort I had, that I stole out whenever I could be secure that my persecutor was with my persecutor military friends; and as I dared not go far, the church-yard on that side of the cathedral where the soldiers did not parade, or sometimes the cathedral itself, were the only places where there was a chance of my not being molested; and there, if I could ever procure quiet for a quarter of an hour, the daws that inhabited the old building, and who were now making their nests (for it was early spring), recalled to my mind, by the similarity of sounds, Rayland-Hall; and when I compared my present condition with even the most comfortless hours I passed there, I reproached myself for my former discontent, and envied all who were at peace beneath the monumental stones around myself.
– Later than usual one evening I returned from this mournful walk, and, making my way with some difficulty through the crowds who were assembled in the streets to celebrate some victory or advantage in America (and at the very name of America my heart sickened within myself), I was overtaken near the door of Mrs Newill lodging, by the person whom I most dreaded to meet – Sir John Belgrave, evidently in a state of intoxication, with three officers in the same situation, who insisted on seeing me home.
I was within a few yards of the door of Mrs Newill's lodging, and hastened on to disengage myself from them; but them followed me on, talking to myself in a style of which I was too much terrified to know more than that it was most insulting and improper.
'In this way, however, while I remonstrated, and trembled, and entreated in vain, I was forced into a little room behind the shop, where Mrs Newill usually sat, where, instead of Mrs Newill, there sat by the side of a small fire (for the weather was yet cold) a young man in the naval uniform, who, starting up on the abrupt entrance of such a party, stood amazed a moment at the language of Sir John Belgrave and his friends, and and then, fiercely demanding what business they had in that house, ordered they to leave that house; and, taking my hand, his said – 'I am ashamed, gentlemen, of your treatment of this young woman – Don't be alarmed, miss – I will protect you.'
'I most willingly put myself into the protection he offered, when Sir John Belgrave, enraged at being thus addressed by a person whom he considered as so much he inferior, uttered a great oath, and said – 'And pray, fellow, who are you?
and what the devil have you to do with this girl?'
– 'Master of my mother's apartment,' replied, the young sailor, who I now understood was Mrs Newill son – 'and an Englishman!
As the first, I shall prevent any ruffian's insulting a woman here; as the second, I shall defend this girl from insult any where.'
– 'You be d – d!'
cried Sir John Belgrave; 'you impudent puppy, do you think that black stock makes you on a footing with a gentleman?'
Belgrave's companions had by this time wisely retired; for, as I was not Belgrave's companions pursuit, Belgrave's companions saw no occasion to incur the danger of a quarrel in it.
The only answer the stranger gave to this additional insolence of Sir John Belgrave was a violent blow, which drove the aggressor against the side of the wainscot, that in so narrow a room prevented his falling; and then young Newill, seizing his by the collar, with a sudden jerk threw his out of the room, and shut the door of Mrs Newill's lodging.
The noise all this made brought Mrs Newill down stairs, who demanded of Mrs Newill son what was the matter?
Mrs Newill answered, that some brutal officers, very drunk, had insulted a young lady who had taken shelter in the room, and whom her son had rescued from their impertinence by turning their out of it.
my mother, in additional consternation, then turned to Mrs Newill, 'What!'
said my mother, 'it was you, miss, was it?
And I suppose the gentleman was Sir John Belgrave – Fine doings!
And so, William, this is the way you affront my friends?'
'I care not whose friends I affront,' replied William: 'if whose friends behave like brutes to a woman, I would affront whose friends if whose friends were emperors.'
William mother, who I am afraid had been solacing my mother above stairs with some of those remedies to which my mother often applied for consolation, now began to cry and lament my mother; and, in my mother pathetic complaints, bemoaned my mother ill luck that had given my mother an apprentice that, so far from being an assistant, was only a trouble to my mother, and did nothing but offend my mother customers.
Mrs Newill then, for the first time, understood that I was this apprentice; and as I sat weeping in a corner, I saw Mrs Newill pitied me – 'Come, come, my mother,' said Mrs Newill to my mother, 'no more of this, if you please – nobody has offended your customers; but on the contrary, your customers, as you call your customers, have offended me; let us look a little after this good friend of my mother, perhaps Mrs Newill may have some farther commands for Mrs Newill – it is unhandsome to sink such a fine fair-weather jack, without lending a hand to heave Mrs Newill up.'
Mrs Newill then, in despite of my mother's entreaties, opened the door of Mrs Newill's lodging; but Sir John Belgrave appeared, and the sailor observed that Mrs Newill had set all Mrs Newill canvas, and scudded off.
'So now, my mother,' said Mrs Newill, 'pr'ythee let's have no more foul weather; but let us sit down to supper, for I'm sure this young woman must be glad of something after this young woman fright – poor little soul, how this young woman trembles still!
– and you should remember that I have rode from Portsmouth since dinner, and a seaman just come from a two months cruise must eat.'
Mrs Newill still however appearing to think more of Sir John Belgrave than her son, Mrs Newill became presently impatient; and going out to a neighbouring inn, Mrs Newill ordered a supper and some kind of wine or punch; which being soon brought, Mrs Newill consented to partake of it, though Mrs Newill still behaved to me with such rude reserve, that I would immediately have retired, if Mrs Newill Mrs Newill had not insisted on my sitting down to supper with them, and I was too much obliged to Mrs Newill to refuse.'
'You were certainly obliged to Mrs Newill,' said Orlando, in a hurried voice; 'but after such a scene I wonder you were able to remain with these people – What sort of a man is Mrs Newill?
Is Mrs Newill a well-looking man?'
'Yes,' replied Monimia, 'rather so; but I hardly knew then how Mrs Newill looked – and in the scene I have described, I rather recollected it afterwards, than attended to it at the time.'
'Pardon me,' interrupted Orlando, with quickness – 'you must have attended to it at the time, or you could not have recollected it afterwards.
Have you often seen Mrs Newill since?
What is become of Mrs Newill now?'
'Mrs Newill is gone to sea,' replied Monimia.
'You have not then seen Mrs Newill since?'
'Yes, certainly I have – I saw Mrs Newill the next day.'
'Where?'
cried Orlando, impatiently.
'I was obliged,' answered Monimia, 'because Mrs Newill was not going immediately to join Mrs Newill imprisoned husband, to be up early to pack up some things in the shop for the person who had bought them; and while I did it, all my sorrows pressing with insupportable weight on my mind, and above all, your loss, Orlando – I wept as I proceeded in my task of typing up band-boxes and parcels, and yet I hardly knew I wept; when Mrs Newill Mrs Newill entered the place where I was, and offered to help me – 'Good God!'
said Mrs Newill, 'you are crying!'
Mrs Newill took my hand, my hand was wet with tears.'
'And Mrs Newill kissed them off,' cried Orlando, again wildly starting from Mrs Newill chair, 'I know Mrs Newill did – yes!
this stranger, infinitely more dangerous than Sir John Belgrave .
.
. '
'Oh!
Orlando,' said Monimia, with a deep and tremulous sigh, 'what is it you suspect me of?
Do not, I beseech you, destroy me as soon as we have met, by suspicion, which indeed, if you will hear me with patience .
.
. '
'Go on, Monimia,' said Mrs Newill, recovering Mrs Newill – 'go on, and I will be as patient as I can – but Mrs Newill' – 'Always,' said Monimia, 'behaved to Mrs Newill like the tenderest brother, and it is to Mrs Newill alone I am indebted for the safety and protection I have found.
Yet it is true, Orlando, and I will not attempt to conceal it from you, that young Newill in this first interview professed Mrs Newill my lover; but when I assured Mrs Newill that all my affections were buried with you, that it was out of my power to make Mrs Newill any other return to the regard Mrs Newill expressed for Mrs Newill, than gratitude; and if Mrs Newill would be so much my friend as to influence my mother, either to prevail upon my aunt to receive me, or to let me remain with any creditable person in the country, instead of taking me to London (where I had too much reason to believe I was to be exposed anew to the persecutions of Sir John Belgrave), I should be eternally indebted to Mrs Newill – this Mrs Newill promised to undertake, and seemed to acquiesce in my refusal of Mrs Newill addresses, which, had I been capable of listening to he would be so much my friend as to influence his mother, either to prevail upon my aunt to receive me, or to let me remain with any creditable person in the country, instead of taking me to London (where I had too much reason to believe I was to be exposed anew to the persecutions of Sir John Belgrave), it would have been very indiscreet on Mrs Newill part to have pursued; for Mrs Newill was possessed of nothing but the pay of a midshipman, and out of that little had often contributed to relieve the distresses of Mrs Newill parents; and now on hearing of Mrs Newill father's confinement, immediately after Mrs Newill return from a cruise, in which the frigate Mrs Newill was on board had taken two small prizes, Mrs Newill hastened to two small prizes assistance; and bearing with sailor-like philosophy all present evils, and never considering those of the future, Mrs Newill was treating for the advance of Mrs Newill pay for the next half year, in order to enable Mrs Newill mother to discharge some debts for which his mother creditors were very clamorous, before his mother left the town.
Yet did Mrs Newill, under such circumstances, think very seriously of a wife – I believe that Mrs Newill supposed the dejection of my spirits was rather owing to my forlorn situation, than to an attachment which Mrs Newill had no notion of as existing after the death of its object, and that I should gradually be induced to listen to Mrs Newill love.'
'Yet,' cried Orlando warmly, 'yet you talk of the brotherly and the disinterested regard of this new friend of yours.'
'It was so in effect, Orlando, and I did not too minutely enquire into the motive of his conduct.
Allow me to go on, and you will own that we are both much obliged to his.
When his fully understood the nature of my situation, in invincible aversion to Sir John Belgrave, and my fears, which, mortifying as they must be to his, I could not help expressing, lest his should prevail on Mrs Newill to betray me entirely into his father power – his father expressed in his father rough sea language so much pity for his father, and so much indignation at the conduct of his father family, that I became persuaded I might trust his father.
But, alas!
I had nothing to entrust his father with – no means of escape from the evils I dreaded to propose to his father – except Mrs Roker, I had no friend or relation in the world – I had written three letters to Selina, but I received no answer – and Selina too had, I feared, by the troubles of Selina own family, been compelled to appear for a while unmindful of Selina unhappy Monimia.
– Mrs Newill desired a few hours to consider what Mrs Newill could do for Mrs Newill; and in that time Mrs Newill talked to Mrs Newill mother of Selina ungenerous and base conduct in regard to Mrs Newill, with so much effect, that, after a struggle between Selina necessities and Selina conscience, Selina promised Selina to receive no more the bribes of Sir John Belgrave, and even to let me quit Selina, if I insisted upon it.
Having obtained thus much, Mrs Newill returned to Mrs Newill, and I was then to determine whither I would go.
Oh!
how gladly would I then have accepted of the lowest service!
But who would take a creature apparently so slight as not to be able to do any kind of household work; and from such a woman as Mrs Newill, who was but little esteemed either for Selina morals or Selina economy?
In this distress I wrote again to Selina, entreating Selina to enquire for a place for Mrs Newill; but no answer came in the usual course of the post, and Newill's leave of absence expiring in three days, it became necessary to determine on something.
Fruitless as every written application had hitherto been to Mrs Roker, I could think of nothing better than to address Mrs Roker in person; and as I dared not go so far alone, being ever in apprehension of meeting Sir John Belgrave, Mrs Newill offered to go with Mrs Newill, and .
.
.'
'How did you go?'
said Orlando, interrupting Mrs Roker.
'In the stage to Alresford,' replied Monimia; 'and from thence we walked to the house, where, however, I was refused admittance by a sister of Mrs Roker's, who told me Mrs Roker poor dear sister-in-law was in a bad state of health; that nobody could be admitted to see Mrs Roker; and advised me by all means not to depend upon any thing Mrs Roker could do for Mrs Newill, since Mrs Roker condition put all attention to business out of the question; and Mrs Roker Mrs Roker was sorry indeed to remind me, that my perverse undutiful behaviour had not a little contributed to derange the faculties of my worthy relation.
I could have answered, that Mrs Roker faculties were certainly deranged when Mrs Roker married Mrs Roker; but I had no opportunity to make this observation if I had had courage enough – for Mrs Roker shut the door in my face, repeating in very rude terms, 'that any visits there would be to no purpose.'
'Thus driven from the habitation of my only relation, I returned more broken-hearted than I set out to Winchester.'
'And your protector, I suppose, renewed your protector solicitations by the way?'
said Orlando.
'No indeed,' answered Monimia, 'Monimia had too much sensibility; and whatever Monimia might intend for the future, Monimia too much respected the grief into which this cruel repulse had plunged me.
The next day but one Monimia was to go back to Monimia duty, with a young shipmate who was visiting Monimia then at Southampton, who was to call upon Monimia, that they might return together.
While I was yet undetermined what to do, time passed away, and this comrade of Mrs Newill arrived.
It was young Fleming, the eldest son of your friend, whom my mother's relation, an old captain of a man of war, had taken from Winchester college at eighteen, and adopted at his father's death upon condition of Mrs Newill becoming a sailor – a condition which Mrs Fleming, who had so recently lost a sailor husband, lamented, but dared not oppose.
War had just deprived a sailor of a sailor first support; yet Mrs Newill on whom a sailor next relied a sailor was compelled to part with for the same dreadful trade, because a sailor pension, as a lieutenant's widow, which was almost a sailor sole dependence, was very insufficient for the support of a sailor four other children; the two little girls you saw with me last night, another yet younger, and a sailor second boy, whom a sailor relation partly supports at an academy, intending Mrs Newill also for the sea – and who would have been so much offended, had a sailor thwarted Mrs Newill in regard to taking the eldest son from college, that Mrs Newill would have renounced the whole family.
'To this young man, who was Mrs Newill most intimate friend, Mrs Newill communicated, but not without first asking my permission, the difficulties I was under; concealing however those circumstances that seemed to reflect so much disgrace on my mother.
They consulted together what I could do.
.
.'
'Excellent and proper counsellors truly!'
exclaimed Orlando impatiently.
'Less improper than you imagine,' replied Monimia.
'Fleming had not, like Mrs Newill, been so long at sea as to acquire that steadiness of mind which enables men of that profession to look on all personal danger with indifference, and on moral evil as a matter of course.
But yet, recollecting not only his classics, but the romances his had delighted in at school, his had that natural and acquired tenderness of mind which made his sensible at once of all the discomforts of my situation.
his saw in me a poor, deserted heroine of a novel, and nothing could be in his opinion so urgent as my relief.
– Accustomed in all emergencies to apply to his mother, to whom his is the most affectionate and dutiful of sons .
.
.'
'What is become of FlemingFleming?'
enquired Orlando, 'is Fleming often at home with Fleming ?'
'No; Fleming went almost immediately after my first becoming acquainted with my mother, to the East Indies – but your impatience, Orlando, will not let me conclude my sad story.
Fleming seeing the affair in the light I have described, settled with Fleming friend Newill that the latter should return alone to the ship – make some excuse for Fleming's being absent two days longer, while Fleming would return to Fleming , and endeavour by Fleming means to find some proper asylum for me.
The readiness with which Mrs Newill consented to this plan, convinced me of Mrs Newill disinterestedness; though I own I had little hope of his disinterestedness success.
I supposed that Fleming would have suspected the zeal of so young a man for a woman of my age, in distress, and would decline interfering for a person of whom Fleming could know nothing.
But the generosity of my young advocate rendered my young advocate eloquent; and Fleming to whom my young advocate pleaded was not only naturally of the most candid and humane disposition, but Fleming own sorrows had so softened Fleming heart, that calamity never pleaded to Fleming in vain, though Fleming circumstances are such as do not always enable Fleming to relieve it, as her heart dictates.
'Fleming reflected, that there must be something remarkable in the situation which had made so great an impression on Fleming ; and that even if I was a young woman whom necessity had reduced to a discreditable mode of life, Fleming kindness might yet save me from deeper destruction.
With this humane persuasion, and remembering always the maxim of doing as Fleming would be done by, Fleming came Fleming to Winchester, to enquire what Fleming could do for me – thinking, as Fleming has since told me, that Fleming ought to do this, if Fleming hoped for the mercy of Heaven towards Fleming own girls, who might, by so likely an event as Fleming death, be as desolate and friendless as I was.
I am too much exhausted, Orlando, to be particular now in relating our first interview.
We shall, I hope have frequent opportunities of admiring the simplicity of character, the goodness of heart, and the attractive manners of my benefactress, who, from your description of my mother, is almost Fleming counterpart.
It is sufficient if I tell you that Fleming not only implicitly believed my melancholy story, but, as nothing immediately occurred to Fleming for my permanent relief, determined to take me home with Fleming, till some eligible situation could be found.
When Fleming had been a little accustomed to me, Fleming would not part with me; I have been so happy as to make me useful to Fleming and Fleming children; and in acquitting me as far as I could of my debt of gratitude, I have found the best and only defence against that regret and anguish which devoured me.
Fleming had sorrows enough of Fleming own; I forbore therefore to oppress Fleming with mine, and I tried to be calm when I could not be cheerful; but when the conversation turned to the loss Fleming had sustained in Fleming , I mingled my tears with hers, and wept for Orlando.'
Orlando, forgetting in this tender confession the little jealousies Orlando had felt, while Orlando considered Fleming liable to the addresses of a rival, now pressed Fleming fondly to Orlando heart; and seeing Fleming quite overcome by the fatigue of relating so long a narrative, and the violence of those emotions Fleming had so lately experienced, consented to leave Fleming, and they parted for the night; though Orlando could not wish Fleming good night without protesting to Fleming that Orlando would never again consent to be separated from Fleming, even for a day; for that if ever Orlando was absent from Fleming again, Sir John Belgrave would incessantly pursue Fleming in imagination, and Sir John Belgrave should believe Fleming exposed again to dangers and insults which it almost drove Orlando to madness to recollect Fleming had already endured.
