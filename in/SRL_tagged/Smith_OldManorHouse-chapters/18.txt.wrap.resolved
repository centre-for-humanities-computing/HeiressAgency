THE meeting of the evening promised to be undisturbed. THE meeting of the evening was long since Orlando had seen his Monimia quietly seated by the fire in the Study; and now that his was once more to enjoy that happiness, his could not determine to embitter it by speaking of the probability there was that his was soon to leave her, and enter on a new mode of life. his could, when they were actually together, the less resolve to speak of this, as Monimia appeared in unusual spirits; and from what she had observed of Mrs Rayland's behaviour to Mrs Rayland's, in the interview at which she had been present, she found reason for forming more sanguine hopes than she had ever yet indulged, that they delicious visions were not chimerical; and that Orlando, if not master of Rayland Hall, would yet be amply provided for by the favour of its present possessor.  Instead, therefore, of destroying these flattering visions, which lent to the lovely features of Monimia the most cheerful animation, Monimia endeavoured to divest Monimia own mind of the painful reflections it had of late entertained; and instead of talking of what was to happen, Monimia wished to fortify the mind of Monimia against whatever might happen, by giving she a taste for reading, and cultivating she excellent understanding. The books Monimia had given she, the extracts she had made from them, and she remarks, afforded them conversation, and gave to Orlando exquisite delight. Monimia had animated the lovely statue, and, like another Prometheus, seemed to have drawn Monimia fire from heaven. The ignorance and the prejudices in which Monimia had been brought up, now gave way to such instruction as she derived from Addison and other celebrated moralists. she understood, and had peculiar pleasure in reading, the poets, which Orlando had selected for she; and when she repeated, in a fascinating voice, some of the passages she particularly admired, Orlando was inspired with the most ardent wish to become a poet himself.  Very different was the way in which his elder brother passed this evening. Tormented with fear and remorse, that unfortunate young man had returned to unfortunate young man long-deserted home, for no other reason than because unfortunate young man had, during unfortunate young man northern expedition, lost to unfortunate young man companions every guinea that unfortunate young man could by any means raise, and had besides contracted with them a very considerable debt of honour. unfortunate young man knew not how to apply to unfortunate young man father, whom unfortunate young man had already impoverished; yet unfortunate young man pride would not let unfortunate young man return to Mr Stockton's, whither some of the party were again gone, till unfortunate young man had the means of satisfying some of the party demands against unfortunate young man. In this emergency unfortunate young man came home, in hopes of finding some pretence to procure the money of unfortunate young man mother, whom unfortunate young man believed unfortunate young man could persuade to borrow it for unfortunate young man of her brother Mr Woodford, as her had done a less considerable sum once before; or at all events to gain a few days, in which unfortunate young man might consider what to do.  It was to the dejection unfortunate young man felt on the awkward circumstances to which unfortunate young man had reduced unfortunate young man, that the gravity and steadiness of manner was owing, which unfortunate young man father took for contrition and reformation. It lasted, however, no longer than till the next evening, when, after tea, Mrs Somerive as usual, in order to amuse the General, proposed cards Mrs Somerive, however, having a person with Mrs Somerive upon business from whom Mrs Somerive could not disengage Mrs Somerive, and Orlando having returned to Rayland Hall immediately after dinner, there was not enough to make a whist table (as none of the young ladies played), and therefore Mrs Somerive proposed to the General to sit down to piquet.  To this proposal piquet of course consented, and, either from chance or design, the General lost every party, and had presently paid to the General antagonist twelve guineas. Animated by this success, especially as it was against a man who was known to be in habits of playing at the first clubs, Mrs Somerive again proposed playing after supper. Fortune continued to be propitious; and when Fortune father, mother and sisters retired, at a later hour than ordinary, Fortune still continued at the table, where Fortune was now a winner of about fifty guineas.  They were no sooner out of Fortune way, than the true spirit of gaming, which They presence had checked, broke out.  'This is poor piddling work, the General!' exclaimed Fortune: 'Do you not think hazard a better thing?'  the General answered coolly, that it certainly was; 'but,' added the General, 'I suppose my good host would think the General house polluted by having the necessary instruments in his house. the General has no other dice, I dare swear, than those in the back-gammon table.'  'Oh! as to that,' answered Mrs Somerive, 'I am always provided with an apparatus in case of emergency – there is no travelling without such a resource – I have the pretty creatures up stairs. What say you, General – shall we waste an hour with the pretty creatures up?'  'With all my heart,' replied Tracy. 'Let we see if you are as much befriended by chance, as you have been by skill.'  Young Somerive now produced from his travelling portmanteau a box and dice: his put a green cloth over the table, that the rattling of them might not be heard in his house; and then telling the servants that none need sit up but the General's servant, them began to play, and continued at it till morning broke, with various success – But on quitting it, Mrs Somerive found Mrs Somerive a very considerable gainer, and retired to Mrs Somerive bed flushed with the hope that the General, all veteran as Mrs Somerive appeared, and calmly as Mrs Somerive played, was a pigeon, from whose wings Mrs Somerive might pluck the feathers which were wanting to repair Mrs Somerive own.  the General, all veteran as he appeared, and calmly as he played, was a pigeon, from whose wings he might pluck the feathers which were wanting to repair his own.  , was now perfectly assured that, by losing money to Mrs Somerive, or by supplying Mrs Somerive with it when Mrs Somerive lost it to others, this young man would become wholly subservient to this young man wishes, however contrary to honour or conscience. this young man did not dislike play, though this young man never regularly pursued it; and had one of those cool heads in such matters, which had prevented this young man ever suffering by it. this young man had generally been a winner, and particularly in betting: – this young man frequented, when this young man was in London, all the houses where high play is carried on; and was so much accustomed to see thousands paid and received at these places as matters of course, that this young man held the trifle this young man had paid to Philip Somerive the evening before as not worth remembering. It was therefore with some surprise that this young man heard Mr Somerive, who had called this young man apart the next morning, express, in very forcible terms, this young man great concern that this young man son had won so large a sum of his son. If this young man felt any concern, it was that Philip should have been unguarded enough to speak of it. Philip soon, however, learned that Philip Somerive alluded solely to the fifty guineas Philip Somerive had won at piquet, and that of the subsequent transactions of the evening Philip Somerive knew nothing. This therefore Philip Somerive carefully concealed, and, assuring Philip Somerive that Philip Somerive had almost forgot they played at all, conjured Philip Somerive not to be uneasy about This.  'I know, my dear General,' said Philip Somerive, 'I know perfectly well that this is a mere trifle to Philip Somerive; but to his son it may, nay it will have the worst consequence. his son is, I see with an aching heart, too much devoted to play – Success only nourishes this ruinous passion – and distressed as I have been, and indeed am, by his son conduct, I should rather have paid an hundred pounds for his son than have seen his son win fifty.'  this young man endeavoured to quiet, on this head, the apprehensions of the unhappy father, by telling his son that his son saw nothing in the young man that was not at his son age, and with his son prospects, very excusable. 'It is surely,' said his son, 'hazardous, my good friend, to check his son too much. If home is rendered utterly unpleasant to his son, his son volatility seeks resource abroad; and there you know how many designing people beset a young man of his son expectations.'  'Good God!' exclaimed Somerive, 'what are his expectations? his son has impressed you, I see, my dear Sir, with the same idea which has in fact undone his son, and will undo us all. What expectations has his son that can in the least be relied upon, unless it be of this small estate, which his son is already dismembering, and which will soon disappear – ah! very soon indeed, in the hands of a gamester.'  'Tie it up, then,' said this young man.  'I cannot,' answered Mrs Somerive, 'for Mrs Somerive is entailed, and, except my wife's jointure of an hundred a year, which with difficulty I contrived to settle upon my wife, his son may dissipate it all, and I have no doubt but his son will.'  'You judge, I think, too hardly of his son. Something is surely to be forgiven his son, who has always been told that his son must be heir to the great property of the Raylands, and possess one of the largest landed estates in the country.'  'O! would to heaven his son never had been told so!' said Mr Somerive with a deep sigh. 'If ever, my dear General, Mr Somerive with a deep sigh should talk to you about it, pray endeavour to wean Mr Somerive with a deep sigh from expectations so ruinous, and, I think, so fallacious. It is true that I am heir at law to all the estates of Sir Orlando Rayland my grandfather, in default of Sir Hildebrand's daughters having issue, but not if the survivor of them disposes of the survivor of them by will, for the whole is hers without any restriction; and there is not the least chance of her dying without a will, for I know her is never without one: and the people who surround her take especial care that her own family shall be excluded from especial care.'  'You do not then suppose,' said this young man, 'you do not believe it possible that these people, by whom I conclude you mean those old servants of whom I have heard you speak, have interest enough with her to secure to these people, by whom I conclude you mean those old servants of whom I have heard you speak so large a property as Mrs Rayland possesses. I should think it more likely that, though her will probably give these people, by whom I conclude you mean those old servants of whom I have heard you speak considerable legacies, her will leave the estate to the next heir; her pride will urge her to this, perhaps, on the condition of his taking the name of Rayland.'  'I fear, not,' answered Philip Somerive. 'her has a very singular temper, and has always been taught that the sister of her disgraced her by marrying his father. her has on a thousand occasions given me to understand, that the small portion of the Rayland blood which I have the honour to boast, is much debased by having mingled with that of a plebeian; and that the blood of my children being still a degree farther removed from the Raylands, her cannot consider my children as belonging to the family, which is in her opinion extinct – her means therefore to perpetuate her opinion remembrance by the only method in which her believes her can do her opinion worthily; and, after giving her servants considerable legacies – perhaps something to Orlando – to have recourse to the common refuge of posthumous pride, and, with her large landed estates, to endow an hospital, which shall be called after her name.'  this young man exclaimed loudly against such a method of settling her property; but, after hearing on what Philip Somerive founded Philip Somerive opinion, Philip Somerive agreed that it seemed but too probable. 'And yet,' added Philip Somerive, 'it appears to be more the interest of these servants, by whom you say her is governed, that the estate should descend to an individual – particularly that of the old housekeeper, who, from what I can make out of the scraps I have picked up here and there about this Monimia, seems to have a plan of drawing in your youngest son to marry her; and of course it must be her wish, that your youngest son should be Mrs Rayland heir.'  'I have not discovered,Philip Somerive, 'in all I have collected from Orlando, that the aunt is at all privy to their attachment. But that indeed may be the aunt art – the aunt possesses more than almost any woman I ever knew; and had the aunt much less, the aunt must know that the bare suspicion of such an intrigue, on the part of Mrs Rayland, would occasion the disgrace of Orlando – the expulsion of the girl from the house – and perhaps the ruin of the aunt, if the least idea occurred of the aunt being of their counsel.'  'Upon the whole, then, my friend,' cried this young man, 'I think that the putting of Orlando into some profession immediately seems the only prudent measure you can take. This will probably ascertain Mrs Rayland intentions, if they are in Mrs Rayland favour; and, if they are not, will remove Mrs Rayland from a situation which appears in my mind a thousand times more likely to ruin Mrs Rayland for life, than even those imprudences of which you complain in Mrs Rayland brother: for be assured, my dear Sir, a young fellow is never so completely ruined as when Mrs Rayland has married foolishly – Every other folly is retrievable; but an engagement of that sort blasts a man's fortune for ever: and the wisest thing a man can do afterwards is to hang a man.'  Though Mr Somerive, who was not a 'man of the world,' and who had experienced many years of happiness with a woman whom he married for love, was by no means of Tracy's opinion as to marriages of affection in general, he saw the variety of evils such a marriage would bring on Orlando, in as strong a light as he friend could represent them. he therefore entirely acquiesced in the necessity of he being removed from Rayland Hall; and waited with impatience for Orlando's account of what had passed in that conference which he had undertaken to hold with the old lady, on the subject of he entering the army.  Just as he parted from General Tracy, who about an hour and a half before dinner retired to he toilet, Orlando appeared on horseback. he met he; and bidding he join he in the garden as soon as his father had put his father horse in the stable, his father walked thither Orlando Orlando in a moment attended he. 'Well,' said Philip Somerive gravely, 'have you had an opportunity of conversing with Mrs Rayland on this matter? I have it every hour more at heart, and am determined that you shall be removed from your present situation, unless, what is not to be expected, Mrs Rayland signifies Mrs Rayland positive resolution to make you very ample amends for your loss of time, and gives me assurances of your loss of time.'  Orlando, in this peremptory determination of Orlando , fancied Orlando saw the machinations of his brother to get Orlando away from Rayland Hall; but, without expressing any part of the pain such a suspicion gave Orlando, Orlando answered, 'You know, my dear Sir, that in our last conference on this subject, I assured you of what I now desire to repeat, that I live only to obey you: but I have had no opportunity of speaking to Mrs Rayland on this subject; for, when I saw Mrs Rayland on the first evening of my return to Rayland Hall, it was with great difficulty I could appease the anger Mrs Rayland felt at our having dined with Stockton.'  'Mrs Rayland knew it then?'  'Oh, yes! – Lennard and Pattenson take care Mrs Rayland shall know every thing. At length, however, I had the good fortune, not only to obtain a remission of my offence, but to engage Mrs Rayland to invite our family and this young man to dine at Mrs Rayland table on Thursday, when the tenants' feast is to be held at Rayland Hall. Mrs Rayland piques Mrs Rayland on shewing the General, whom Mrs Rayland respects as a man of family, a specimen of old English hospitality, in opposition to the modern profusion of the Castle – and Mrs Rayland desire to obtain his suffrage in favour of the ancient mode of living at Rayland Hall, has performed what no other consideration would have effected. This unexpected project entered Mrs Rayland head the moment I had described our visit; and all yesterday was passed in considering about This unexpected project, and debating with Lennard whether Mrs Rayland should be well enough. To-day it is decided that Mrs Rayland shall, and I am sent with the invitation, which certainly you and my mother and sisters will accept; and I suppose General Tracy will oblige our by going also.'  'Of that there can be no doubt,' replied Philip Somerive.  'I thought, therefore,' added Orlando, 'that you and this young man might have an opportunity, during the course of the day, of introducing the conversation relative to my entering the army; and that it would be perhaps better than my abruptly disclosing what may, in some of her humours, appear to Mrs Rayland as a desire on my part to quit Mrs Rayland.'  'You have certainly given my ancient cousin love powder, Orlando,' said Philip Somerive smiling; 'for I never heard that, even in Mrs Rayland younger days, Mrs Rayland shewed for any body as much affection as Mrs Rayland lately has done to you and the General might have an opportunity, during the course of the day, of introducing the conversation relative to my entering the army; and that it would be perhaps better than my abruptly disclosing what may, in some of her humours, appear to Mrs Rayland as a desire on my part to quit her.'  'And yet,' replied Orlando, 'I am almost certain that it goes no farther than a little present kindness, or perhaps a small legacy.'  Philip Somerive, feeling that this was too probable, and was indeed what Philip Somerive had just before been repeating to General Tracy, sighed deeply – and bidding Orlando go with Philip Somerive message of invitation to Philip Somerive mother and sisters, Philip Somerive sent up the card to this young man; and then went on Philip Somerive usual circuit round Philip Somerive farm, desiring Orlando to stay dinner.
