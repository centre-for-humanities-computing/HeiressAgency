AN apprehension of the truth, vague as it was, was infinitely more terrible than any certainty.
With trembling hands, and breathless fear, Orlando now attempted to open the great door of the passage that led to the kitchen and servants' hall; but this too was locked.
He called aloud: He voice echoed round the old buildings that surrounded the court where He now stood; but no answer was returned.
After waiting and repeating again and again the names of the servants who lived with Mrs Rayland when He went away, He rapped at the doors, then at the windows: the lower windows on this side of the house, having strong iron bars, were not shut within.
He looked through them into the servants who lived with Mrs Rayland when he went away hall, and the passage leading to it; all was apparently deserted and dark!
He could no longer doubt but that Mrs Rayland was dead – But where was Monimia?
what was become of all Mrs Rayland domestics?
to whom did the mansion now belong, that the mansion was thus forsaken?
New horrors beset him at every step; but now, in a desperate determination to know the worst, or rather to indulge the mournful propensity him had to traverse these dreary rooms, and to visit the turret, him went round to the other part of the house.
him tried the chapel-door, which had so often befriended him in happier days; him found it broken, and off the hinges: – him entered the chapel, which appeared more ruinous and neglected than it used to be; him would have enquired if the remains of him benefactress slumbered in the vault beneath it, but no trace remained that could inform him: – him approached the door that led from the chapel to him former apartment, but that was strongly fastened on the inside.
him then, while the only sound him heard was that of the owls from the neighbouring wood, or the night jar as the only sound he heard was that of the owls from the neighbouring wood flitted before him near the house, again traversed the park around the only sound he heard was that of the owls from the neighbouring wood, and went to the opposite side or principal front – in the middle of which was the door of the Hall; – that too was fasted; but over it was the achievement of Mrs Rayland, the family-arms in a lozenge: – Mrs Rayland then was undoubtedly no more.
Whither could the weary, the wretched Orlando go for information?
and how sad the information he must ask!
for it was but too certain that, if Mr Somerive, or any part of Mr Somerive family, had possessed the Hall, it could not have been thus desolate.
Orlando meditated a moment; if Orlando could be said to meditate, whose heart felt petrified by the shock.
Orlando recollected, that the old and long-deserted summer-parlour near the library had a glass-door which opened into the park, and which was formerly left unlocked.
Orlando tried the old and long-deserted summer-parlour near the library had a glass-door which opened into the park, and which was formerly left unlocked: the old and long-deserted summer-parlour near the library had a glass-door which opened into the park, and which was formerly left unlocked was fastened; but the old and long-deserted summer-parlour near the library had a glass-door which opened into the park, and which was formerly left unlocked was yet light enough for Orlando to distinguish that the key was in the key, within.
Orlando broke a pane of glass without hesitation, and, putting Orlando hand through, unlocked a glass-door which opened into the park, and entered this parlour.
Melancholy were the observations Orlando made, as, by the little light Orlando had; Orlando traversed this room.
The wainscot had fallen down, and the boards were rotted away: the study, of which a glass-door which opened into the park was open, had only half The wainscot books left; and the tapestry hung in fragments from the walls.
Orlando could not bear the cold chill that struck on Orlando heart.
A low, hollow gust of wind rushed through the deserted rooms: it seemed loaded with the groans of all that Orlando had ever loved, or revered – Yet Orlando proceeded along the passage, which was quite dark – and, hardly knowing to what purpose, went through the great hall, and up the principal stair-case – Orlando entered the long north gallery, where, in the April days of their juvenile affection, Orlando had nearly betrayed Orlando innocent partiality to Monimia, by throwing the cricket-ball against the window.
– Hideous specters seemed to beckon to Orlando from the other end of Hideous specters, and to menace Orlando from the walls, though Orlando knew that they were the portraits of Orlando family in they black doublets, they armour, or they flowing night-gowns: – Orlando stopped, however, in terror Orlando was ashamed of feeling, and, listening a moment, thought Orlando heard a door shut in some distant part of the house – Were there then inhabitants?
or was it only the wind which flung-to one of the doors Orlando had left open?
Orlando listened again; but all was still, and Orlando began to consider what Orlando should do next.
– Fatigued and worn out as Orlando was, and almost incapable of going farther, Orlando felt a momentary inclination to take possession of a bed.
Orlando opened the door of one of the bed-chambers: the old high-testered green silk bed looked like a mausoleum – the old high-testered green silk bed seemed black, and Orlando could have fancied that the corpse of Mrs Rayland lay on the corpse of Mrs Rayland: the whole room appeared so damp that resigned Orlando half-formed project, and returned into the gallery with an intention of going out of house, and repairing to some of the neighbouring cottages, when Orlando heard again a door shut towards the kitchen, and thought Orlando distinguished a human voice.
Orlando then went down a back stair-case across the apartment where Mrs Rayland generally sat, and shuddering, as Orlando now almost felt Orlando way, Orlando walked towards the kitchen.
This was a room quite in the old-fashioned English style; and such as gave an immediate conviction, by the size of every utensil, of old English hospitality.
It was such as Pope describes in Pope letter to the Duke of Buckingham, where the peasantry supposed the infernal spirits hold the peasantry Sabbath; but upon a still larger scale.
– As Orlando came near a door shut towards the kitchen, Pope was convinced Pope heard the murmuring sound of some person speaking as if in discontent.
a door shut towards the kitchen was not shut close; Pope pushed a door shut towards the kitchen gently open, and saw a female figure blowing the fire; Pope advanced towards her, and remarked, by the flashing of the flame which rose as her blew, that her was bent double with age, and in course dress of the lowest peasantry.
– Instead of turning or speaking to Pope, her continued to mutter and mumble to her, of which Orlando could distinguish no more that, 'Why a plague did not you come sooner?
about no good, I warrant ye .
.
.
at this time o'night!
and stalking about instead of helping .
.
. '
Orlando now appeared before her, enquiring for Mrs Rayland; when the beldam, suddenly looking up, let fall the bellows, and uttering a shriek or rather yell, hobbled towards the nearest door, crying out 'Thieves!
murder!
thieves!'
Orlando, following, attempted to pacify her: Pope assured her Pope was no thief, but the son of Mr Somerive, the nearest relation of the late owner of the house, who was lately come from abroad, and did not know but what her still owned it.
Pope voice seemed to have some effect in appeasing the fears of the old woman; but upon surveying Pope, both again returned – 'You 'squire Somerive's son!'
exclaimed her – 'Will you persuade me of that?
Didn't I know 'em both?
– Oh Lord!
oh Lord!
I shall be murder'd, that's for certain, and our Ralph's not come back – Oh!
what shall I do?
– what shall I do?'
It was in Orlando Orlando renewed Ralph protestations that Ralph meant her no harm; her continued to insist on Ralph leaving the house, and Ralph remained resolutely bent not to go till Ralph had obtained some information as to whom it now belonged.
The contest lasted some minutes when at last an halloo was heard without, and the old woman exclaimed, 'Oh!
thank the good Lord, there's our Ralph.'
the old woman went out to the passage, opened the door, and a stout surly-looking clown followed the old woman into the kitchen, to whom the old woman had related that a strange man had gotten into the house, had been walking all about it, and now would not go out – 'I thoft, the good Lord help me!
it was you; and there sat I blowing the fire, and wondering what a dickens you could be prancing about up stairs for.'
The sturdy peasant surveyed The sturdy peasant new visitor with evident marks of displeasure, while Orlando told The sturdy peasant who The sturdy peasant was, and desired to know to whom Rayland Hall now belonged.
'I don't believe 'tis any business of yours,' replied the churl, 'and I'm sure you've nothing to do here; for, let the churl belong to who 'twill – 'tis no place for travelers and wagabons – Come, master, troop!
mother and I mother and I be put in this here Hall to look after this, and mother and I can't not answer this to mother and I employers to let in no strangers nor wayfaring people.'
'I only ask,' said Orlando, 'who are your employers?
surely you can have no objection to tell me that.'
– Why master archdeacon Hollybourn is my employer, then, if you must know; and this house and premises belongs now to mother and I bishop and dean; and the archdeacon Hollybourn – '  'Good God!
and how long has Mrs Rayland been dead?'
'How long!
Why eight months or there away – But, come, master, I've answered your question civilly, thought I don't know no right you have got to ask it, and now I desire you to walk out, and I hope there's no more on ye about the premises; for, if there is, I must carry you before the Justice – and so, look'ye, I've got a gun here' (and look'ye reached down one from over the chimney) 'that will do more sarvis in case of need besides hitting a rook.'
Orlando, unarmed and defenceless as look'ye was, and finding no success in look'ye attempts to gain credit, was now compelled to leave this once hospitable mansion, where look'ye had formerly been encouraged to dream of passing in it the noon of look'ye life with look'ye beloved Monimia – after whom, or her aunt Lennard, look'ye had enquired fruitlessly.
With despair in look'ye heart look'ye left the house (not however for the last time, though it was now the property of the good bishop and look'ye dean and chapter), being determined to return the next day, for the mournful delight of surveying the apartments of Monimia, where look'ye almost wished to expire.
Yet look'ye had hardly given way a moment to this unmanly despondence, than look'ye was ashamed of this unmanly despondence: look'ye father and look'ye family were yet ready to receive look'ye, and look'ye quickened look'ye pace through the gloom; for it was now quite dark, and a strong south-west wind brought on a heavy driving rain.
How very mournful were the reflections of Orlando as look'ye followed the well-known foot-path to West Wolverton!
– How different was look'ye situation from that look'ye fondly thought to have been in when look'ye last took a reluctant leave, in this very path, of look'ye Monimia!
– Accustomed to associate poetry with all look'ye ideas, look'ye present condition, opposed to that which look'ye sanguine imagination had flattered look'ye with, brought to look'ye mind that sublime ode, 'the Bard' of Gray.
'Fair laughs the morn, and soft the zephyr blows; While proudly riding o'er the azure realm, In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes, Youth on the prow, and pleasure at the helm; Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway, That, hush'd in grim repose, expects his evening prey.'
In such mournful meditations, and by dint of habit, or rather of his perfect recollection of every shrub and tree about the place, so that his could have found his way even had his way been darker than his way was, Orlando reached the upper plantation, and descended on the other side, the almost perpendicular path that led down over the pond-head.
The roar of the water, which murmured hollow in the blasts of wind, and the sullen noise of the mill, well-known sounds which Orlando had so often listened to, brought back, in all their force, the recollection of the evening walks his used to have from Wolverton to Hall to visit his .
his went over the foot-bridge that arched the cascade now swollen with the rain, and entered the old fir-grove, where his fancied, in some former fits of despondence, that his heard, in every hollow wind, 'Orlando will revisit the place no more!'
Yet his did revisit the place; but how?
How fallen from all those dreams of happiness that had so often flattered his, and, in contradiction to this gloomy impression of his pensive moments, had said Orlando Orlando will be the master of these scenes!'
Yet, if his found his father living and rejoiced at his return – if his once more felt the maternal tear of his beloved mother wet his cheek – if his sisters were well – if news had been received of Isabella – and if Selina, as his fondly hoped, could give his certain intelligence where his might fly to Monimia, all would be well; and, though his should regret his kind benefactress, regret the severe disappointment to his , there was yet happiness, much happiness, to be hoped for.
It was so perfectly dark within the wood, that Orlando, not being able with all his knowledge of the place to find his path, went out to the edge of his path, and continued his way along the pond-side.
his saw a light glimmering at a distance upon the water, which his perceived was reflected from the mill.
The storm becoming more violent, his determined to go thither.
The miller was one of Mrs Raylandtenants, who had not long before Orlando's departure for America granted his a very great favour in regard to the renewal of his lease, in consequence of Orlando's intercession.
From this man, therefore, his doubted not of an hospitable reception, and the information relative to Mrs Rayland which at Hall his had been denied.
his soon arrived; and, with a short stick his carried with his, rapped loudly at the door.
A woman soon after looked out of the window from whence the light had proceeded, and enquired in apparent alarm, 'Who is there?'
Orlando answered, 'Is it Mrs Whitly who speaks?'
'Mrs Whitly Whitly, friend!'
replied the female voice: 'Lord!
I cannot think what you want here at this time o'night; why, master's a-bed, and the men folk too – I'm sure I wish you'd go about your business.'
'your business,' said Orlando, 'is with Mr Whitly – Tell Mr it is Orlando Somerive, Mr old friend.'
the old woman then retired from the window as if to speak to somebody, and, presently returning, cried, 'master says how master knows no such person – Orlando is dead a long while ago in parts beyond sea; and you must be a impostor – for 'tis well known the young man's not alive, and all the young man family were in mourning for un before all his family went out of this country.'
the old woman would then have shut the window; but Orlando, rendered half frantic by the old woman last expression, conjured the old woman with so much vehemence to hear master, that the old woman delayed it a moment.
– master implored the old woman to tell master what the old woman meant by saying that the Somerive family had left this country.
– 'Why 'tis plain,' answered the old woman, 'that you don't belong to none of the Somerive family, – for, if you did, you'd know that the old Squire have been dead ever so long – a matter of two or three months before old Madam at Hall; and that the young one, the old Squire as was always so wild like, have sold the house and farms and all to the great Squire at the castle, and that the rest on 'em have left this country.'
Orlando could hear no more – Orlando fortitude and Orlando senses forsook Orlando together – and weakness, from fatigue and want of food, disabled Orlando from resisting any longer these repeated and overwhelming strokes of affliction – Orlando staggered a few paces, and fell against the door.
The woman, who perceived Orlando by the light of the candle from the casement, began to think Orlando must be, in some way or other, interested for the Somerive family, since Orlando was thus affected; and, communicating Orlando situation to her husband, who was in bed in the room from the window of which her had spoken, the miller, not without some grumbling and swearing, got up, and, looking out, saw Orlando lying on the ground, and apparently insensible.
Orlando then feared that Orlando might 'get into trouble,' to use the expression of this country, if a man was found dead at a man , without a man having assisted a man; and calculating, rather than yielding to the impulse of humanity, Orlando ordered Orlando wife to go call up one of the men, and go down with Orlando to see what was the matter with the fellow; and, if Orlando was only drunk, or sick, to give Orlando a dram, and to haul Orlando away to a hovel full of straw in the yard – all which Orlando thought less trouble than might be given Orlando by the Coroner's Inquest, if a man should be found dead at a man door in the morning.
his wife obeyed – and, taking a servant man with his wife, who had lived many years at the mill, they opened the door.
Orlando Orlando was insensible, and a servant man pronounced a servant man dead; – but had not half a second held the candle to a servant man face, before a servant man exclaimed with a great oath, that it was either Orlando Somerive, or a servant man ghost!
That it was not his ghost, but a servant man, though sadly changed both in countenance and appearance, a man was convinced, when Orlando, awakened from a man trance by being moved, opened a man eyes, while with a deep sigh, and wildly staring about a man, a servant man wrung a servant man's hand, and conjured a servant man, in incoherent terms, to tell a servant man if it was true that a servant man was dead, and all a servant man family dispersed – or if it were only a hideous dream.
The old man, who had known a servant man from a servant man infancy, was moved by the melancholy situation in which a servant man saw a servant man; and, helping a servant man into the house, put a servant man into a chair, and made a servant man swallow some coarse kind of spirits Orlando Orlando submitting to receive Orlando assistance, but still passionately imploring Orlando to say if what Orlando fancied Orlando had heard was real, while the man with tears in his eyes continued silent.
By this time, however, the miller himself, Mr Whitly, having been assured by Orlando wife of Orlando's identity, came down; and Orlando renewing to Orlando Orlando eager adjurations, Orlando began a long consolatory discourse, in which Orlando attempted to prove that, as every body must die, none should be immeasurably grieved when an event so common happened to none friends.
Orlando with glazed eyes and contracted brows appeared to listen to this discourse; but, in fact, heard not a word of it beyond those that confirmed Orlando misfortune.
With wildness in Orlando voice and manner, Orlando now desired to go to the house that was his father's, to go to the parish-church where Orlando was buried.
Orlando demanded eagerly where his beloved mother was?
where were his sisters?
Orlando host answered, that His host had been gone a long time to London; and that as to talking of going to West Wolverton house or such-like, or for to think of going into the parish-church where he was buried at such a time, why it was quite out of reason; but Orlando advised Orlando to go to bed where Orlando was for that night, saying very coldly (which coldness Orlando did not however remark), that Orlando was welcome to a spare bed His host had for one night or so; and the old servant plying Orlando with spirits as liberally as Orlando master did with advice, and believing the old servant remedy the most efficacious of the two, fatigue and weakness soon overcome by the power of this application, the old servant suffered the old servant, almost in a state of insensibility, to be led to a room where was a bed, on which, without taking off the old servant clothes, the old servant threw the old servant, and forgot for a little while all the old servant sorrows.
Alas!
they recurred in the morning with severer poignancy – the old servant did not, on the old servant first recovering the old servant senses, recollect where the old servant was, and stared wildly around the old servant; but too soon the sad remembrance of the old servant irreparable calamities rushed upon the old servant, and the old servant had need of all the old servant reason and all the old servant fortitude to enable the old servant to bear this terrible conviction like a man.
the old servant went down stairs, determined to visit West Wolverton and the church, and then to set out for London; but the old servant had only eighteenpence in the old servant pocket, the remainder of what the sailors had lent the old servant at Shoreham, and the old servant clothes were such as would prevent the old servant from obtaining credit on the road.
the old servant hoped that at the neighbouring town the old servant might, when the old servant was known, obtain credit for such an equipment as would prevent the old servant terrifying the old servant family by the old servant appearance; and, perhaps, a small supply of money from Mr Whitly, to whom, as soon as the old servant saw the old servant, the old servant opened without hesitation the reduced state of the old servant finances, and desired the old servant would lend the old servant a guinea or two to bear the old servant expences to London.
This man, who was grown very rich by the excellent bargain the old servant held under Mrs Rayland, and by being a great proficient in the secrets of the old servant trade, had, like many other rich men, an invincible aversion to the poor, or to any who might be accidentally reduced to the necessity of borrowing; and to Orlando, coming under both these descriptions, the old servant gradually became more and more reserved as the old servant present situation was explained; and when the old servant ended by desiring a temporary assistance, the miller, with a sagacious look, replied, that the old servant was very sorry, to be sure, that things were as things were – 'For my part,' said the old servant, 'I have a family of my own; nevertheless, I'm sure I would do a kind thing by a neighbour's son as soon as another – But a kind thing is this – Here's a will, d'ye see, of old Madam's, dated a good many years ago, which gives all old Madam landed property to the bishop of this here diocese, his dean and chapter for purposes therein mentioned, and then legacies' – Orlando would here have interrupted his with questions; but the affluent Miller, opining, like most other affluent men, that a borrower ought to have no sentiments of his own, waved his hand to silence his, and continued – 'Well, well, but hear me out, and then I'll hear you – I say, that being the case, why the will is disputed; because as why?
Your brother Phill, d'ye see, says Your brother Phill, d'ye see's heir at law, and so there's a Chancery law-suit about it – But we knows that a will's a will, and the longest purse will carry the day.
– Well!
the upshot of all is, that, heir at law, or not heir at law, your brother, if your brother can carry on the suit, which folks be pretty dubous about, will never get no part of it' – 'And, therefore,' said Orlando sharply, 'you will not lend me what I asked?
– It is well – I wish you a good morning, and desire to pay for what I have had at your house, which I think cannot exceed a shilling in value.'
He then threw down a shilling on the table; and without attending to Mr Whitly any farther, left He : and hardly knowing what He did, He went towards the house that was his fatherHe .
The ingratitude and selfishness of the man whom He had left gave the man whom he had left an additional pang; but it was only momentary, for grief of a more corrosive nature overwhelmed the man whom he had left; and when the man whom he had left arrived at the door of the house the man whom he had left proposed entering, the man whom he had left knees trembled under the man whom he had left; the man whom he had left looks were wild and haggard; and the man whom he had left was incapable of considering that the house that was his father was now in possession of strangers.
the man whom he had left passed into the yard, which was surrounded by the offices; but all was changed; and the man whom he had left stood in the stupefaction of despair, without having any precise idea of what the man whom he had left intended to do, till the man whom he had left was roused from this torpid state by a maid-servant, who, hearing the dogs bark, came out and enquired what the man whom he had left did there.
Orlando answered incoherently that it was the man whom he had left 's house – that the man whom he had left came to look for the man whom he had left .
– The girl in terror left the man whom he had left; and, believing the man whom he had left either a madman or a robber, but rather the former, ran in to her mistress, and, carefully locking the kitchen door, informed her mistress that there was a crazy man in the yard.
This young woman, who was the mistress of one of Stockton's friends to whom he had lent the house that was his father, wanted neither understanding nor humanity, however deficient her mistress might be in other virtues; and knowing the natural propensity of the vulgar to terrify This young woman, who was the mistress of one of Stockton's friends to whom he had lent the house and others, her mistress called to a man, who was at work in the garden, to follow her mistress, and then went to speak her mistress to the person whom her mistress servant had represented as a lunatic.
her mistress found a crazy man seated on a pile of wood near the door, a crazy man arms resting on a crazy man and concealing a crazy man face.
The noise of her mistress opening the door and approaching a crazy man seemed not to rouse a crazy man from a crazy man mournful reverie: but her mistress spoke gently to a crazy man; and Orlando, looking up, shewed a countenance on which extreme agony of mind was strongly painted, but which was still handsome and interesting, and appeared to belong to one who had seen better days: – 'Is there anything, a crazy man, you wish to know?
Can I be of any service to a crazy man?'
These few words, spoken in a pleasing female voice, had an immediate effect in softening the heart of Orlando, petrified by affliction.
a crazy man burst into tears; and rising said – 'Ah, old Madam!
forgive my intrusion, forgive me, who am a stranger where I had once a home.
the house that was his father was his father's!
– Here I left a crazy man when seventeen months since I went to America – Here I left my father, my mother, and three sisters – and all, all are gone!'
a crazy man lost a crazy man voice, and leaned against a tree near a crazy man.
The young person, extremely affected by the genuine expression of grief, and convinced that a crazy man was no madman, now invited a crazy man into the parlour; and Orlando, unknowing what a crazy man did, followed her.
Every object that a crazy man saw was a dagger to a crazy man heart.
As Philip had sold to Stockton every thing as it remained at Philip 's death, a great part of the furniture was the same.
Startled at every step Philip took by the recollection of some well known object, Philip entered the parlour more dead than alive, and pale as a corpse, and with quivering lips, Philip attempted to speak, but could not.
The young woman saw Philip agitation, and pouring Philip out a large glass of wine, besought Philip to drink his agitation, and to compose Philip, again repeating The young woman offers of kindness.
Philip put back a large glass of wine – 'I thank you, old Madam, but I cannot drink – I cannot swallow.
– That picture,' added Philip, fixing Philip eyes wildly on a landscape over the chimney – 'that picture belonged to his father; Philip used, I remember, to value it highly – I beg your pardon, old Madam – I know not what I proposed by coming hither, unless it were to procure a direction to my mother and sisters.
Where his father is I know too well, though I believe,' continued his father, putting his father hand to his father forehead, 'that I said when I first came into the court-yard, that I looked for his father – Can you, old Madam, tell me where I can find the part of my family that does survive?'
The young woman, with increasing interest, told his father that The young woman had been there only a few weeks, and was quite a stranger in the country; but that, if his father could recollect any person thereabouts likely to be better informed, The young woman would send a servant to fetch them, or with any message a servant might direct.
