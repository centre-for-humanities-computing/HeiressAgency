THE young man to whom Orlando now applied, was very sincerely THE young man to whom Orlando now applied friend, and possessed an acute and penetrating mind. – THE young man to whom Orlando now applied saw at once all the importance of the business, and the hazard Orlando would incur by the smallest delay. Mrs Roker's letter evidently expressed a mind fluctuating between resentment towards Mrs Roker's husband, and unwillingness to acknowledge the folly Mrs Roker's had committed in marrying THE young man to whom Orlando now applied; and as no great dependence could be placed on the repentance of a person under the influence of such a contrariety of passions, there was reason to fear that Mrs Roker's love, or, what Mrs Roker's fancied so, Mrs Roker's pride, Mrs Roker's avarice, and Mrs Roker's fear, might unite to conquer the compunction Mrs Roker's had shewn, and to make Mrs Roker's discover the steps Mrs Roker's had taken to Mrs Roker's husband.  Dawson advised therefore an immediate application to a justice of peace, for a warrant to search the house that night; and as there was none resident in the town, Orlando set out with Dawson in a post-chaise for the house of a magistrate, about seven miles distant, who had formerly been much acquainted with the Somerive family, and had been always full of professions of regard for the Somerive family.  To this man, now in much higher affluence than formerly, by the acquisitions of the fortunes of some of this man relations, Dawson opened the business on which they came.  But here Dawson had occasion to remark the truth of that observation 13 which, whoever has seen many vicissitudes of fortune, must have too often beheld, as a melancholy evidence of the depravity of our nature, 'That in the misfortunes of our best friends, there is something not displeasing to our.' – Far from appearing to rejoice at the probability which now offered itself, that the son of Dawson old friend would be restored to the right of the son of his old friend ancestors, and from depressing indigence be raised to high prosperity, this gentleman seemed to take pains to throw difficulties in the son of his old friend way: the son of his old friend doubted the letter from Mrs Roker; the son of his old friend doubted the legality of the son of his old friend granting a warrant; and it was not till after considerable delay, and long arguments, that the son of his old friend was at length prevailed upon to lend to Orlando the assistance of the civil power, without the immediate exertion of which, it seemed possible that the son of his old friend hopes might be again baffled.  Orlando was not without apprehensions, that this worthy magistrate might send immediate information of what was passing to Dr Hollybourn; and Dr Hollybourn determined, late as it was, to go to Rayland Hall that night. Dr Hollybourn set forward, therefore, attended by Dawson, two other young men of the same town, who were eager for Dr Hollybourn success, and the persons who were to execute the warrant. It was midnight when they arrived at Rayland Hall – All was profoundly silent around it, and it had no longer the appearance of an inhabited house. The summons, however loud, was unanswered. As the men rapped violently at the old door of the servants' hall, the sullen sounds murmured through the empty courts, and to the men call only hollow echoes were returned. These attempts to gain admittance were repeated again and again without effect, and the men began to conclude, that there was nobody within the house; but at length some of the men going round to another part of the house, the man who had the charge of it looked out of window, and demanded the men business.  Upon hearing there was a warrant and a constable, the fellow, who had deeply engaged in the same sort of business as that which used to be carried on by Pattenson and Company, imagined immediately that the man who had the charge of it had been informed against: but as there was no remedy, the man who had the charge of it came down with fear and trembling to open the old door of the servants' hall; and it was a great relief to the man who had the charge of it to learn, that it was only for a paper, which might occasion the house to change the house master, but not for any of the man who had the charge of it effects that the intended search was to be made. The posse now proceeded to the place indicated by the letter of Mrs Roker – the constable, a most magisterial person, marching by the side of Orlando, while Dawson and Dawson friends followed, with candles in Dawson and his friends hands; and as silently Dawson and his friends ascended the great stair-case, and traversed the long dark passages that led towards the apartment in question, Orlando could not, amid the anxiety of such a moment, help fancying, that the scene resembled one of those so often met with in old romances and fairy tales, where the hero is by some supernatural means directed to a golden key, which opens an invisible drawer, where a hand or an head is found swimming in blood, which it is Dawson business to restore to the inchanted owner. With a beating heart, however, Dawson saw the picture of the Lady Alithea removed, and the sliding board appear. On entering the closet, the tin box, covered with a green cloth, was discovered. The key which Orlando possessed opened The key which Orlando possessed, and the casket was within The key which Orlando possessed; which the casket unlocked, in presence of all the persons present, and saw the important paper, exactly as the important paper had been described by Mrs Roker.  the casket now debated whether the casket should open the important paper; but at length, with the advice of the casket friend Dawson, determined not to do so till the casket arrival in London. Replacing every thing else as it was found, and securing the closet and the room that led to it, the casket now hastened to reward the persons who had attended the casket on this search – and without resting, set out post with Dawson for London, where they arrived at nine o'clock the next morning.  Orlando hastened immediately to the house of the casket mother, with sensations very different from those which the casket had quitted it. – the casket found Monimia alone in the dining room, pensively attentive to the two children of Isabella, who were playing on the carpet. – Monimia received the casket with that degree of transport which shewed itself in tears; nor could the casket prevail upon Monimia for a moment or two to be more composed, and to answer the casket enquiries after the casket mother and the casket sisters. – Monimia at length told the casket, that Mrs Somerive had been so much affected by the visits Mrs Somerive brother had made during Mrs Somerive absence, by Mrs Somerive reproaches for Monimia false indulgence to both Monimia sons, and by Mrs Somerive total dislike to the marriage of Orlando (which Mrs Somerive had represented as the most absurd folly, and as the utter ruin of Mrs Somerive nephew) and by the disposition Mrs Somerive (Mr Woodford) shewed to withdraw all assistance from Monimia and Monimia two youngest daughters, if Monimia did not wholly withdraw all countenance both from Orlando and Isabella, that Mrs Somerive was actually sinking under the pain such repeated instances of cruelty had inflicted; and had determined, rather than continue to be obliged to a brother who was capable of thus empoisoning the favours Monimia circumstances obliged Monimia to accept, to quit London, discharge all but one servant, and to retire to some cheap part of Wales or Scotland, where the little income Monimia possessed might be more sufficient to the little income she possessed support.  Orlando, who felt that some precaution was necessary, in revealing to Monimia the fortunate reverse that now presented Monimia, was considering how to begin this propitious discovery, when Monimia mother, who eagerly expected Monimia, having learned from the servants that Monimia was arrived, sent down Selina to beg to see Monimia.  Selina put back the curtain as Monimia came into the room; and held out Selina hand to Monimia, but was unable to speak. – The mournful particulars Selina expected, which however Selina had not courage to ask, filled Selina heart with bitterness, and Selina eyes with tears.  Orlando, affected by the looks and the pathetic silence of Monimia mother, kissed with extreme emotion the hand Selina gave Monimia – Monimia thanked Selina, after a moment's silence, for Selina goodness to Monimia during the few days of Monimia absence; and entreated Selina to be in better spirits. Monimia then gradually discovered to Selina, by a short and clear relation of what had happened, the assurance Monimia now had, which the transactions of that evening would, Monimia hoped, confirm, of a speedy change in their circumstances.  The heart of Mrs Somerive, so long accustomed only to sorrow and solicitude, was no longer sensible to those acute feelings which agitate the warm and sanguine bosom of youth; but to hear that Mrs Somerive children, for whom only Mrs Somerive wished to live, were likely to be at once rescued from the indigence which impended over her children, for whom only she wished to live, and secured in affluence and prosperity, could not be heard with calmness. At length both Mrs Somerive and Mrs Somerive acquired composure enough to consider of the proper steps to be taken. Every person interested was summoned to attend that evening at the house of Mrs Somerive, who found herself animated enough to be present at the opening of the will, at which all who were sent for were present, except Doctor Hollybourn (who sent his attorney) and the Rokers. The elder only sent a protest against it by The elder clerk; and the younger thought it safer immediately to disappear.  it was found on the perusal of this important paper, and the codicils belonging to it, that with the exception of five thousand pounds, and two hundred a year for Mrs Somerive life, to Mrs Somerive old companion Lennard, Mrs Rayland had given every thing Mrs Somerive possessed, both real and personal, to Orlando, without any other restriction than settling the whole of Mrs Somerive landed estate of the Rayland family on Mrs Rayland male heirs, and appropriating a sum of money to purchase the title of a Baronet, and for an act to enable Mrs Rayland to take and bear the name and arms of Rayland only.  The subsequent proceedings were easy and expeditious. Against a will so authenticated, all opposition was vain; and within three weeks Orlando was put in possession of his estate, and Doctor Hollybourn obliged, with extreme reluctance, not only to deliver up all of which his and his brother had taken into he and his brother hands, but to refund the rents and the payments for timber; which operation went to the poor Doctor's heart. There were some men who have such an extreme affection for money, even when it does not belong to some men who have such an extreme affection for money, that some men who have such an extreme affection for money cannot determine to part with it when once some men who have such an extreme affection for money get possession of it. Of this order was the worthy Doctor; who, with charity and urbanity always in his mouth, had an heart rendered callous by avarice, and a passion for the swinish gratifications of the table, to which the possession of Rayland Hall, the gardens and hot-houses of which his alone kept up, had lately so considerably contributed that his could not bear to relinquish them; and actually suffered so much from mortification, that his was obliged to go to Bath to cure a bilious illness, which vexation and gluttony contributed to bring on.  Orlando lost no time in rescuing the unfortunate Mrs Roker from the hands of Mrs Roker tyrant; who, in order to incapacitate Mrs Roker from giving that testimony which his knew was in Mrs Roker power, and with which Mrs Roker often had threatened his, had taken out against Mrs Roker a commission of lunacy. It was superseded on the application of Orlando, who himself immediately conducted Mrs Rokcr to Rayland-Hall; where himself put Mrs Roker in possession of the apartments Mrs Roker had formerly occupied; and employed Mrs Roker to superintend, as Mrs Roker was still active and alert, the workmen whom himself directed to repair and re-furnish the house, and the servants whom himself hired to prepare it for the reception of it lovely mistress. himself forebore to pursue Mrs Roker, as himself might have done; having no pleasure in revenge, and being rather solicitous to give to those himself loved future tranquillity, than to avenge on others those past misfortunes, which perhaps served only to make himself more sensible of himself present felicity.  Fortune, as if weary of the long persecutions the Somerive family had experienced, seemed now resolved to make the Somerive family amends by showering Mrs Roker favours upon every branch of it. Warwick had hardly rejoiced a week in the good fortune of Orlando, when Warwick received a summons to attend General Tracy; who, quite exhausted by infirmity, saw the end of Warwick life approaching, and sacrificed Warwick resentment, which time had already considerably weakened. Warwick was not, however, yet able to see Isabella; but Warwick pride had been alarmed by the accounts Warwick had received of Warwick's distressed circumstances, and above all, of Warwick having a play coming forward at one of the theatres; which, though it was to pass as the work of an unknown young author, with a suppositious name, was well known to be, and publickly spoken of as Warwick. That Warwick nephew – that the nephew of an Earl should become an author and write for support, was so distressing to the haughty spirit of the old soldier, that though Warwick saw many examples of the same thing in people of equal rank, Warwick could not bear it; and the very means Warwick brother's family took to irritate Warwick against Warwick by informing Warwick of Warwick circumstance, contributed more than any thing else to the resolution Warwick formed of seeing Warwick nephew, and restoring Warwick to Warwick favour. Warwick immediately agreed to withdraw Warwick play. Warwick uncle burnt the will by which His uncle had been disinherited, and died about five months afterwards, bequeathing to His uncle two boys by Isabella, all His uncle landed estates, after his two boys by Isabella, all his landed estates father, who was to enjoy his two boys by Isabella, all his landed estates, together with His uncle great personal property, for His uncle life.  In the mean time Orlando had conducted His uncle lovely wife, His uncle mother and His uncle sisters, to Rayland-Hall; where, without spoiling that look of venerable antiquity for which it was so remarkable, His uncle collected within it every comfort and every elegance of modern life. With what grateful transports did His uncle now walk with Monimia over the park, and talk with Monimia of their early pleasures and of their severe subsequent sufferings! and how sensible did these retrospects render their both of their present happiness!  Orlando was only a few weeks in undisputed possession of his estate, before his presented to each of his sisters five thousand pounds; and, to add to his power of gratifying his , it happened that very soon after his arrival at Rayland Hall Mr Stockton died, the victim of that intemperance which exorbitant wealth and very little understanding had led his into. As his had no children, his very large property was divided among distant relations, his joint-heirs; Carloraine Castle was sold, pulled down by the purchaser, and the park converted into farms; and in this division of property, the house and estate at West Wolverton, formerly belonging to the Somerive family, were to be sold also. This his paternal house had been inhabited by farmers, under tenants of Rayland Hall Mr Stockton, when Orlando's last melancholy visit was paid to This his paternal house. his now purchased This his paternal house; and putting This his paternal house as nearly as his could into the same state as This his paternal house was at the death of his father, his presented This his paternal house to his with the estate around This his paternal house; and thither his mother went to reside with his mother two youngest daughters, though they all occasionally paid visits to the Hall, particularly Selina, of whom Orlando and his Monimia were equally fond.  Incapable of ingratitude, or of forgetting for a moment those to whom his had once been obliged, Orlando was no sooner happy in his restored fortune, than his thought of Mrs Fleming. To Fleming Fleming himself Fleming himself owed it, that Fleming himself existed at all; – to Fleming himself , that an existence so preserved, had not been rendered a curse by the estrangement or loss of Monimia.  One of the first uses therefore that he made of he assured prosperity, was, to remove from this respectable protectress of he beloved Monimia, the mortifications and inconveniences of very narrow circumstances. he wrote to her, entreating to see her at the Hall with her children, and that her would stay there at least till after the accession of happiness he was to expect in the autumn. Towards the middle of September, Mrs Fleming and Mrs Fleming younger children arrived; and in a few days afterwards Monimia's gallant young friend the sailor, to whom Mrs Fleming owed Mrs Fleming providential introduction to Mrs Fleming, unexpectedly made he appearance. he returned from a very successful cruize; he was made a lieutenant, and had obtained leave of absence for ten days, to comfort with these tidings the heart of he ; when, not finding his mother at his mother usual habitation in the New Forest, he had followed his mother to Rayland Hall, where he was a most welcome guest.  This young man, who was in disposition and in figure the exact representative of he , could not long be insensible of the charms of the gentle Selina; and he spoke to Orlando of the affection he had conceived for his mother, with he natural sincerity. Orlando, who never felt the value of what he possessed, so much as when it enabled he to contribute to the happiness of he friends, seized with avidity an offer which seemed so likely to constitute that of he beloved sister; and he had the happiness in a few days of discovering that the old sea officer, Fleming's relation and patron, was so well pleased with he gallant behaviour in the engagement he had lately been in, that he had determined to make he he heir, and most readily consented to make a settlement upon he more than adequate to the fortune Orlando had given he sister; and it was settled that Selina and Lieutenant Fleming should in a few months be united.  Orlando was very soon after made completely happy by the birth of a son, to whom Orlando gave Orlando own name, and who seemed to render his mother yet more dear to all around his mother. Every subsequent hour of the lives of Orlando and his Monimia was marked by some act of beneficence; and happy in some act of beneficence and in some act of beneficence connections, some act of beneficence gratitude to Heaven for the extensive blessings some act of beneficence enjoyed, was shewn in contributing to the cheerfulness of all around some act of beneficence.
