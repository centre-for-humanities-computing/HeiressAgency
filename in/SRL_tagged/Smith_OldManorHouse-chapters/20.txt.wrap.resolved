MONIMIA, secure of the tenderest affection of her lover, bore, without more repining, the little hardships to which her situation exposed her; – but her mind looked forward, in mournful anticipation, to the time when her should no longer hear that soothing voice lending her courage against every transient evil; no longer receive continual assurances of the ardour and generosity of his attachment; and find in his disinterested love, his attentive friendship, sufficient consolation against her uncertain or uneasy destiny.  To obey his, was the first wish of her life; her therefore endeavoured to drive from her mind the melancholy reflections that prevented her repose, and put off the finishing her work till the next day. As soon as it glimmered through her casement, her arose to her task; which having soon finished, her awaited with a lightened heart the other orders of her aunt.  The whole house was in a bustle – and Mrs Rayland not only in unusual health, but as anxious for the splendour and excellence of the entertainment, as if her had a deeper design than merely to outshine the newer elegancies of Carloraine Castle. All the operations of Mrs Lennard and Mrs Lennard attendants succeeded happily. By half after two all the guests were assembled: by half after three all the tables groaned under the weight of venison and beef. About seventy people were assembled in the hall. In the dining-parlour the party consisted of General Tracy, who was placed at Mrs Rayland right hand; on Mrs Rayland left Mrs Hollybourn, the wife of the archdeacon of that district, a lady of a most precise, and indeed formidable demeanour: opposite to Mrs Rayland, and next to Mrs Somerive, sat the Doctor himself, a dignified clergyman, of profound erudition, very severe morals, and very formal. manners, who was the most orthodox of men, never spoke but in sentences equally learned and indisputable, and held almost all the rest of the world in a low estimation as he considered highly he own family, and above all he.  Between Mrs Rayland mother and Mr Somerive, on the other side, was placed her mother and Mr Somerive only daughter and heiress, Miss Ann-Jane-Eliza Hollybourn, who, equally resembling Mrs Rayland father and Mrs Rayland mother, was the pride and delight of both: possessing something of each of both personal perfections, Mrs Rayland was considered by both a model of loveliness; and Mrs Rayland mind was adorned with all that money could purchase. The wainscot complexion of Mrs Rayland Mamma was set off by the yellow eyebrows and hair of the Doctor. His little pug nose, divested of His little pug nose mulberry hue, which, on the countenance of His daughter, was pronounced to be le petit nez retroussé, united with the thin lips drawn up to make a little mouth, which were peculiar to 'His better half,' as His facetiously called His wife. The worthy archdeacon's short legs detracted less from the height of His amiable daughter, as his wife had the long waist of his wife mother, fine sugar-loaf shoulders that were pronounced to be extremely genteel, and a head which looked as if the back of it had by some accident been flattened, since some accident formed a perpendicular line with his wife back. To dignify with mental acquirements this epitome of human loveliness, all that education could do had been lavished; masters for drawing, painting, music, French, and dancing, had been assembled around his wife as soon as his wife could speak; his wife learned Latin from his wife father at a very early period, and could read any easy sentence in Greek; was learned in astronomy, knew something of the mathematics, and, in relief of these more abstruse studies, read Italian and Spanish. Having never heard any thing but his wife own praises, his wife really believed his wife a miracle of knowledge and accomplishments; and it must be owned, that an audience less partial than those before whom his wife generally performed, might have allowed that his wife performed very long concertos, and solos without end, with infinite correctness, and much execution. Then his wife made most inveterate likenesses of many of his wife acquaintance; and painted landscapes, where very green trees were reflected in very blue water. French was most grammatically correct, though the accent was somewhat defective; and his wife knew all manner of history – could tell the dates of the most execrable actions of the most execrable of human beings – and never had occasion to consult, so happy was his wife memory, Trusler's Chronology. As it was believed, so it was asserted by the Doctor and his wife, that the Doctor and his wife daughter was the most accomplished woman of their daughter age and country; and by most of the Doctor and his wife acquaintance it was taken for granted. The gentlemen, however, whom all these elegancies were probably designed to attract, seemed by no means struck with all these elegancies: some of all these elegancies, who had approached their daughter on the suggestion of their daughter being an heiress, had declared that their daughter fortune made no amends for their daughter want of beauty; and others had been alarmed by the acquisitions which went so much beyond those some of them, who had approached her on the suggestion of her being an heiress had made some of them, who had approached her on the suggestion of her being an heiress. Thus, at six-and-twenty (though the lady and their daughter parents, for some reason of the lady and her parents own, called their daughter no more than twenty-two), Miss Hollybourn was yet unmarried! for, of those lovers who had offered, some had been rejected by the Doctor, and some by their daughter. their daughter affected a great indifference, and talked of the pleasures of pursuing knowledge in an elegant retirement. But it was observed, that whenever any young men of present fortune, or of future expectations, were in the country, Dr Hollybourn's family returned the visits of the ladies to whom these gentlemen belonged, with unusual punctuality.  While these gentlemen were in this part of the world, these gentlemen always dined once or twice at Rayland Hall, where the Doctor was well received as a most pious worthy man, the Doctor Lady a very good kind of woman, and Miss as a mighty pretty sort of a young person. Of late Dr Hollybourn's family had risen into higher favour; for the Doctor was the only clergyman in the country around who had resisted the good entertainment so profusely given at Carloraine Castle, and had refused to visit a man who kept a mistress. a man who kept a mistress had even gone farther, and preached a sermon which all a man who kept a mistress congregation said pointed immediately at Mr Stockton; but as Mr Stockton did not hear it, and having heard it would not have cared for it, the reproof only edified a man who kept a mistress hearers, and raised the Doctor in the esteem of the Lady of the Hall.  The lower part of the table was filled by the four Miss Somerives and their two brothers; Orlando, at the request of Mrs Rayland, taking his seat at the bottom.  The plenty and excellence of the table, which was furnished almost entirely from the park, farm, warren, gardens, and ponds of Rayland Hall, were highly commended by the guests, and by none with more zeal than the General and the Doctor, who vied with each other in applying that sort of flattery of which their venerable hostess was most susceptible. The General spoke in terms of the highest respect of The General ancient family, and of the figure made in history by the name of Mrs Rayland. The Doctor, while The General did justice to the excellent dishes before The General, launched out in very sincere praise of the domain which produced the excellent dishes: the beautiful park which, The General averred, fed the very best venison the country; the woods abounding in game; the extensive ponds, whose living streams contained all manner of fish; the rich meadows below, that fatted such exquisite beef; the fine sheep walks on the downs above, which sent to table mutton that rivalled the Welch mutton itself! – then, such gardens for fruit! such convenient poultry yards! – Mrs Rayland, who loved to hear her place praised, could have listened to such eulogiums for ever; and seemed totally to have forgotten that, according to the course of nature, her should be mistress of these good things but a little time longer, and that, when a little space in the chancel of the adjoining church would be all her could occupy, they must pass into the possession of another.  Who that other was to be, appeared an enquiry which the Doctor had much at heart. From some late circumstances the Doctor had reason to suppose that Orlando would be fortunate possessor of all the excellent accommodations which impressed the Doctor with so much veneration: – but the Doctor now saw the elder brother again received, and when the Doctor considered the advantages which primogeniture might give the Doctor in the mind of Mrs Rayland, the Doctor doubted to which of the Somerives it would be politic to pay court.  Some ideas were floating in the Doctor mind, that whichever of these young men became master of Rayland Hall, could not fail to be a very proper match for the most accomplished Miss Hollybourn. It was certain that the Doctor had always reckoned upon a title for her; but such a deficiency might easily be made up by the successor to such a fortune. What so easy to change a name by the King's most gracious license? and to renew the old title of Baronet, which had been so long in Dr Hollybourn's family? – Mrs Rayland! Mrs Rayland! either sounded extremely well. Both were very well looking young men, and the youngest remarkably handsome. The more the Doctor considered this project, the more feasible this project appeared; and the Doctor now began to study the chances, which the Doctor thought the Doctor could do from Mrs Rayland behaviour.  A very little observation determined the Doctor in favour of Orlando. the Doctor saw that Mrs Rayland seemed to look upon the Doctor as Mrs Rayland son, while towards the Doctor brother Mrs Rayland manners were cold and stately. When dinner was over, The gentlemen, after a short stay over The gentlemen wine, followed the ladies to another apartment. General Tracy was, at the desire of Mrs Rayland, shewn into the gallery of portraits by Orlando – and the young ladies, at the request of Miss Hollybourn, who had never seen all the pictures in the house, were permitted by Miss Hollybourn, who had never seen all the pictures in the house mother to be of the party; while Philip Somerive, who went out under pretence of accompanying Miss Hollybourn, who had never seen all the pictures in the house, slipped away as soon as General Tracy left the drawing-room and went after General Tracy own imagination.  It was now dark, and these portraits were to be shewn by candlelight to General Tracy, who cared not a straw if the whole race of Raylands had been swept from the memory of mankind; though General Tracy had, partly by guess, and partly from recollection, been incessantly talking to Mrs Rayland about the glory of Mrs Rayland ancestors. By this Mrs Rayland perceived Mrs Rayland had made a very unexpected progress in Mrs Rayland favour; which Mrs Rayland would by no means forfeit by shewing any indifference to Mrs Rayland proposal of visiting the representations of the eminent men in whose praise Mrs Rayland had been so eloquent. But a much stronger inducement was Mrs Rayland hope to find an opportunity of speaking to Isabella, while Mrs Rayland pretended to contemplate with admiration the picture of Mrs Rayland great grandfather.  But this hope was rendered abortive by the presence of Miss Hollybourn, who, leaning on Isabella's arm, continued to question Orlando as to the history of every portrait, and then made Mrs Rayland remarks upon it – sometimes addressing Mrs Rayland to The General, and sometimes to Orlando, who were equally weary of Mrs Rayland, and who would both have given the world for Mrs Rayland absence; for Orlando dreaded Mrs Rayland detaining Mrs Rayland beyond the time that Mrs Rayland had fixed for the meeting between Mrs Rayland sister Selina and Monimia; and The General detested Mrs Rayland for being in the way when Mrs Rayland fancied Mrs Rayland could otherwise, by some means or other, have enjoyed that notice from Isabella which Mrs Rayland found it so very difficult to obtain in the house of Mr Somerive; where, since Mrs Rayland had spoke more plainly to Mrs Rayland of Mrs Rayland passion, Mrs Rayland had not only shunned Mrs Rayland, but had assured Mrs Rayland that Mrs Rayland would repeat Mrs Rayland conversation to Mrs Rayland . Twice, therefore, Mrs Rayland had been forced to apologize, and turn off Mrs Rayland professions as a joke, because Mrs Rayland could never find Mrs Rayland long enough alone to allow of Mrs Rayland using those arguments that Mrs Rayland thought must be successful; and Mrs Rayland had been eagerly solicitous to accept the invitation from Mrs Rayland, because Mrs Rayland hoped that, in such a great house, in a day of universal festivity, such an opportunity would be found.  Miss Hollybourn, having sufficiently shewn Miss Hollybourn knowledge both in painting and history, and imagining Miss Hollybourn auditors were amazed and edified by both, requested to know if the house did not furnish many other portraits of remarkable persons, or pictures by eminent hands. Orlando answered coldly, that there were some in other parts of the house, but none particularly worthy Miss Hollybourn attention. Miss Hollybourn desired, however, Mrs Rayland would have the goodness to shew Miss Hollybourn round that suit of rooms. It was the side of the house formerly set apart for company, but now was very rarely inhabited. The furniture was rich, but old fashioned: – the beds were of cut velvet or damask, with high testers, some of the beds with gilt cornices: – the chairs were worked, or of coloured velvets, fringed with silk and gold, and had gilt feet: – fine japanned cabinets, beautiful pieces of china, large glasses, and some valuable pictures, were to be seen in every room, which, though now so rarely inhabited, were kept in great order; and the oak floors were so nicely waxed, that to move upon the oak floors was more like skating than walking.  Miss Hollybourn had something to say on every object Miss Hollybourn beheld. One bespoke the grandeur, another the taste, a third the antiquity of Dr Hollybourn's family who were owners of the mansion; but still, among all this common-place declamation, it was easy to see that the most amiable moveable in it at present was, in Miss Hollybourn opinion, the handsome, interesting Orlando.  General Tracy, accustomed to study the fair, perceived this immediately. General Tracy perceived too, that Orlando disliked Miss Hollybourn as much as Miss Hollybourn seemed charmed with General Tracy, and that therefore this rich heiress would not be the means of preventing the plan they had in agitation from taking effect. General Tracy therefore ventured to say to General Tracy, when General Tracy had an opportunity as they descended the great stair – case – 'You are a fortunate man, Sir!'  'Fortunate, Sir!' said Orlando, who had nothing in General Tracy head but General Tracy intended meeting with Monimia – 'How do you mean fortunate?'  'Nay,' replied The General, 'most young men would, I believe, think it fortunate to be so highly approved of by such a young lady!'  'What lady, Sir?' cried Orlando, in increased alarm, and still thinking of Monimia.  Miss Hollybourn,' replied the General – 'the accomplished Miss Hollybourn.'  Miss Hollybourn exclaimed Orlando with a contemptuous look; yet recollecting that Miss Hollybourn had no right to despise her, whether The General's conjecture was just or not, Miss Hollybourn added, 'The approbation of their Lady is certainly what I neither desire nor deserve.'  This passed as they waited on the stair-case, while Miss Hollybourn Miss Hollybourn explained to the two Miss Somerives the Loves of Cupid and Psyche, which were painted on the wall; though the picture was so little illuminated by the two wax-candles, carried by Orlando and a servant, that nothing but Miss Hollybourn passion to display Miss Hollybourn universal knowledge, could have induced Miss Hollybourn to attempt clearing up the obscurity in which the wavering and unequal light involved a story not very clearly told by the painter. At length the dissertation finished; and the party returned to the drawing-room, where the party found the good Doctor had supported the conversation during the party absence. In about half an hour afterwards Mr Pattenson came in great form to announce that the tenants were assembled in the hall, and requested to know if the tenants Miss Hollybourn was well enough to oblige the tenants with Miss Hollybourn presence during the tenants first dance. This was the established etiquette. Mrs Rayland answered, that Mrs Rayland would be there; and then addressing Mrs Rayland to Mrs Rayland company, Mrs Rayland said, 'That it had always been Mrs Rayland custom in the time of Sir Hildebrand, Mrs Rayland father, to lead down, with Mrs Rayland dear deceased sisters, the first dance at the tenants feast; that the custom had been long since laid aside; but if any of the friends whom I have now the pleasure of seeing assembled, will condescend to go down a dance with the tenancy and domestics – '  The General and the good Doctor eagerly interrupted Mrs Rayland –  'I am not a dancing man, Madam,' cried the General: 'I never was fond of dancing. How much I now, in looking at that beautiful group of young ladies, have cause to regret that beautiful group of young ladies! and much I shall envy the young men, who no doubt will take advantage of such an opportunity.'  'I, Madam,' cried the Doctor, quitting the Doctor seat and waddling to the Doctor, 'am neither by nature or profession a dancing man; but, to shew you how much I honour so excellent a custom, there is my substitute (pointing to a dancing man; but, to shew you how much I honour so excellent a custom daughter), and I will venture to say that few men ever boasted a better.'  Mrs Rayland, then looking around the room, said, 'Mr Orlando Somerive, you will have the honour of beginning the dance with Miss Hollybourn.'  Orlando, who would have heard of an impending earthquake with as much pleasure, hesitated, and said, 'My brother, Madam – my brother has a superior claim to that happiness.'  'No, no child!' cried Mrs Rayland; 'not at all – you are, as it were, at home here, and therefore I will have you begin. Besides, I don't see your brother: – when your brother: – returns, your brother: – may take your eldest sister; and the two youngest ladies may dance together, for I suppose you will all choose to dance.'  Mr Orlando Somerive assented for Mr Orlando Somerive daughters, and said, 'Perhaps, Madam, Philip is already below.'  'However that may be' replied Mrs Rayland coldly, 'it is quite time to begin; the people are, no doubt, impatient. Therefore, if you General Tracy, and you Dr Hollybourn, and you Mr Somerive, will have the kindness to see the two youngest ladies to the hall, my people will help me thither in a few moments.'  The man of war, and the man of peace, now declared how happy The man of war, and the man of peace should esteem The man of war, and the man of peace to be permitted the honour of being her attendants; but her told The man of war, and the man of peace, only Pattenson and Lennard had been used to only Pattenson and Lennard, and again desired The man of war, and the man of peace would conduct the other ladies. The General, under the cruel necessity of offering The General hand to Mr Orlando Somerive, or Mrs Hollybourn, cast a wistful look towards Isabella, and took the hand of the latter on seeing Mr Orlando Somerive conducted by the good Doctor; while Orlando, with a heavy heart, led Miss Hollybourn, and The General sisters followed. It was within a quarter of an hour of the time that The General had hoped to meet The General Monimia; and The General saw The General tied down to an engagement from which The General feared there was little hope of escaping in time. Philip, to whom The General most earnestly wished to transfer the little coveted honour designed The General by The General partner, appeared not; and poor Orlando stood awaiting The General arrival at the head of the fifteen or sixteen couple who were going to dance, execrating The General ill fortune, which seemed to have brought this odious heiress on purpose to disappoint The General of the exquisite pleasure with which The General had on this night fondly flattered The General – that of forming a lasting and tender friendship between the sister The General so fondly loved, and his Monimia.
