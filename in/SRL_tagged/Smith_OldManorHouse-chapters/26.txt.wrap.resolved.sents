ORLANDO could not, though ORLANDO attempted ORLANDO, conceal the anguish of ORLANDO heart during the day: for though ORLANDO had arranged with ORLANDO new confident the means of seeing Monimia, it was far from certain these plans would succeed; or, could ORLANDO be content with the means which ORLANDO had used, however desirable the end.
Monimia, who while she yielded to ORLANDO earnest entreaties had always felt, from the natural rectitude of she understanding, the impropriety of their clandestine correspondence, would, ORLANDO feared, be more than ever sensible of she indiscretion, when she found that a servant was entrusted with it – and on thinking over what had passed between ORLANDO and the under keeper, ORLANDO found more reason to entertain a good opinion of ORLANDO acuteness than of ORLANDO integrity.
– When to these reflections were added the certainty of ORLANDO immediate departure, and the uncertainty of ORLANDO return; the mournful looks of ORLANDO mother, who could not behold ORLANDO without tears; the deep, but more silent sorrow marked on the countenance of ORLANDO father, and the pensive expression of regret on those of ORLANDO sisters; ORLANDO could with difficulty go through the forms of a melancholy dinner, at which the General in vain attempted to call off the attention of ORLANDO hosts to topics of common conversation, and to divert those of his sisters from private misery by those public topics which then interested none of those of his sisters.
The expulsion of the Americans from the province of Canada, which had happened the preceding August; and the victory gained by the British fleet near Crown Point against a small number of their gondolas and galleys, in the course of the following October, successes of which exaggerated official accounts were just received, were matters whereon the General in vain triumphantly descanted, and on which ORLANDO obtained more attention from ORLANDO audience, because ORLANDO asserted very positively that, in consequence of these amazing advantages, the whole continent of America would submit, and the troops of course return as soon as the troops of course had chastised the insolent colonists sufficiently for the troops of course rebellion.
– Orlando then, – Orlando assured – Orlando family, was not at all likely to join – Orlando regiment, which would almost immediately be ordered home; but would be the safe soldier of peace, and perhaps return to his family in a few weeks, no otherwise altered than by – Orlando military air and a cockade.
The only smile that was seen the whole day on the faces of any of his family was visible on that of Mrs Somerive, on the General in vain's description of an American flight, though none had a more tender heart or a more liberal mind: but having heard only one side of the question, and having no time or inclination to investigate political matters, Mrs Somerive now believed that the Americans were a set of rebellious exiles, who refused on false pretences 'the tribute to Caesar,' which Mrs Somerive had been taught by scriptural authority ought to be paid.
Thus considering the Americans were a set of rebellious exiles, who refused on false pretences 'the tribute to Caesar,' which she had been taught by scriptural authority ought to be paid, Mrs Somerive rejoiced in the Americans were a set of rebellious exiles, who refused on false pretences 'the tribute to Caesar,' which she had been taught by scriptural authority ought to be paid new defeat, and was insensible of the Americans were a set of rebellious exiles, who refused on false pretences 'the tribute to Caesar,' which she had been taught by scriptural authority ought to be paid misery; though, had not the new profession of Orlando called forth Mrs Somerive fears for the new profession of Orlando, Mrs Somerive would probably never have thought upon the subject at all – a subject with which, at that time, men not in parliament and their families supposed their had nothing to do.
their saw not the impossibility of enforcing in another country the very imposts to which, unrepresented, their would not their have submitted.
Elate with national pride, their had learned by the success of the preceding war to look with contempt on the inhabitants of every other part of the globe; and even on their colonists, men of their own country – little imagining that from their spirited resistance  'The child would rue that was unborn The taxing of that day.'
At length the hour arrived when Orlando obtained permission to return to the Hall: he told he father, that as he meant to take leave of Mrs Rayland that night, in order to pass the greater part of Sunday with he family, it was necessary for he to pay Mrs Rayland this last compliment.
Mr. Somerive acceded to the necessity Mr. Somerive urged; but at parting from Mr. Somerive, fixed Mr. Somerive eyes on those of Mr. Somerive son, with a look which expressed solicitude, sorrow, and pity.
It questioned Mr. Somerive sincerity, and yet seemed not to reproach Mr. Somerive.
Orlando could not bear It: Orlando hurried away, and rode as speedily as Orlando could to the Hall; where Orlando sent up for leave to wait on Mrs Rayland to tea, and then went in search of Jacob, who easily found a pretence for attending Mrs Rayland in Mrs Rayland Study.
Orlando with a palpitating heart questioned Mrs Rayland: 'Have you,' cried Mrs Rayland, 'discovered any means by which I can obtain access to Monimia, or get Monimia down stairs, without the knowledge of Mrs Lennard?'
'Faith, Sir,' answered Mrs Rayland, ''tis no easy task as your honour have set me, I can tell you – However, I've contrived to speak to Miss – '  'Have you?'
cried Orlando eagerly: 'there's an excellent fellow.
And what does she say?'
'Aye, Sir,' replied Jacob, 'that's the thing.
– she was in a sad twitter when she know'd you had told me, and said it was impossible to do what you desired – for the room where she sleeps is a closet within Madam Lennard's, hardly big enough to hold a bed, by reason that she room doors are locked; and for the window, the window is barred up with a long iron bar; so that if Miss had courage to get down a ladder, Miss could not get out – or if Miss did, Miss could never get back again.
Miss aunt, Miss says, finds Miss being there vastly inconvenient; and, as soon as you are gone, reckons to send Miss back to Miss own room.'
'I shall be driven out of my senses,' exclaimed Orlando, as he traversed her own room: 'if I cannot see Miss before I go, I shall be distracted – How did you obtain admittance to Miss?
Cannot I speak to Miss by the same means?'
– 'Why hardly; for you must know that I was forced to get one of the maids to help me.
The new house-maid that Madam have hired this morning upon trial, is an old acquaintance of mine; I gave Miss an item of the matter, and so Miss contrived to take me up to mend the window-shutter, which Miss had broke on purpose; and bid me I should take a hammer and nails, and make a clatter if Madam Lennard came.
I took care to make my job long enough; and when the old house-keeper ax'd me what I was doing, I had an excuse you know pat, and the old house-keeper passed off very well; and not only so, but Miss said to Miss, says Miss – "When you have done my job, Jacob, I wish you would just look at the wainscot under the window, and under them there drawers of mine; for it's as rotten as touchwood, and the rats are for ever coming in," says Miss; and says Miss, "I never saw the like of this old house – this old house will tumble about our ears, I reckon, one day or norther, and yet my lady is always repairing this old house," says my lady; "but the wainscoting of this here end of the wing," says my lady, "has been up above a hundred years; and we may patch this old house, and patch this old house, and yet be never the nearer: but for my part, I suppose this old house will last my time," says my lady.'
Orlando no sooner heard that another person, the new housemaid, had been incautiously admitted to participate a secret which Orlando had hitherto so anxiously guarded, than Orlando vexation conquered the pleasure Orlando had for a moment indulged, in learning that it was possible for another, and therefore for Orlando, to see Monimia.
To the latter part of the game-keeper's oration Orlando could not attend, occupied with the idea of the new uneasiness this circumstance must give to Monimia; and agitated by innumerable fears and anxieties, Orlando remained a moment silent after Orlando companion had ceased to speak, and then said – 'Monimia told you, I think, that after I was gone Monimia aunt would suffer Monimia to return to Monimia former apartment?'
'Yes, that was what Monimia said.'
'Well, then, I will go.
Indeed I am going by day-break to-morrow.
Nay, I am going from this house to-night; and therefore I shall take leave of Mrs Rayland this evening.'
Orlando paused a moment, and then added, 'I suppose it is possible to convey a letter to Monimia, though I despair of seeing Monimia.'
'O Lord!
yes, Orlando, that you may do for certain; for I told Monimia that if Monimia would let down a letter for you by a string at seven o'clock, I would be there to take it; and you might send Monimia one back the same way.'
'What is it o'clock now?'
cried Orlando.
'Almost six, Orlando.'
'It is time then for me to go to my appointment with Mrs Rayland, whose tea I am afraid is ready.
Do you be punctual to seven o'clock; and, if I can escape, I will be with you at the window.
But I beseech you, Jacob, to remember, that all the obligation I shall owe you on this occasion will be cancelled, if you are not secret.
I wish you had not mentioned this matter to any other person, especially to a woman – You know they are not to be trusted.'
'Aye!
that I know well enough; they'll cackle, I know they will, if life and death depended upon it: but, Lord!
Sire, how a-name of fortune was I to get at Miss, unless I had done so?
and I do believe Nanny is as trusty as most.'
It was equally useless to argue on the necessity of the measure, or the discretion of Nanny.
The die was cast; and to meet Monimia safely after so much hazard had been incurred, was all that The die would now answer any purpose to think of.
Orlando, during his short conference with his own thoughts, had determined to take that night his last leave of Mrs Rayland, and to say to Mrs Rayland before Mrs Lennard, that his was to set out the next morning early, with General Tracy, for London.
his hoped, by thus acting, to persuade the aunt of Monimia that Mrs Rayland might safely send Mrs Rayland back to Mrs Rayland former apartment; and that by making an appointment with Mrs Rayland for Sunday, when his would by the people at the Hall be believed on his way to London, his should enjoy without interruption the melancholy pleasure of bidding Mrs Rayland adieu, and settling the safest method for their future correspondence.
For this purposed his wrote to Mrs Rayland; and sealing the letter, his put the letter into his pocket and repaired to Mrs Rayland; who, understanding his was come to take his last leave of Mrs Rayland, received his with great solemnity, yet not with less kindness than usual.
Mrs Rayland conversation consisted chiefly of good advice.
Mrs Rayland declaimed against the vitiated state of modern manners, and related how much better things were in Mrs Rayland time.
Mrs Rayland warned his to beware of the gamesters and bad women, who, Mrs Rayland said, were the ruin of all young people; and gave his, though obliquely, to understand, that his future favor with Mrs Rayland depended on his behaviour in this his first appearance in life.
With Mrs Rayland the age of chivalry did not seem to be passed; for Mrs Rayland appeared to consider Orlando as a Damoisell, now about to make his first essay in arms.
Indeed, while Mrs Rayland talked much of modern immorality and dissipation, Mrs Rayland knew very little of modern manners, seldom seeing any of those people who are what is called people of the world; and forming Mrs Rayland ideas of what was passing in it, only from newspapers and the Lady's Magazine; or some such publication, which excited only wonder and disgust – while Mrs Rayland recollection came to Mrs Rayland relief, and carried Mrs Rayland back to those days Mrs Rayland herself remembered – and with still greater pleasure to the relations Mrs Rayland had given of what passed in his father.
The freedom of modern life suited so ill with the solemnity of respect that was shown towards Mrs Rayland in Mrs Rayland youth, that Mrs Rayland shrunk from the uneasiness it gave Mrs Rayland, and made around Mrs Rayland a world of Mrs Rayland own: of which when Orlando became an inhabitant, all that regarded his father was assimilated to Mrs Rayland own antediluvian notions.
In answer to Mrs Rayland long and sage lecture, Orlando assured Mrs Rayland, and with great sincerity, that Orlando had no wishes that were not centered in the spot and neighbourhood Orlando was about to leave: that new as Orlando was to the world, Orlando yet believed it would offer Orlando no objects that could a moment detach Orlando affection from Orlando family and Orlando friends.
There was so much earnestness, and something so impressive in the manner of Orlando saying this, as not only enforced belief, but sensibly affected Mrs Rayland.
Mrs Rayland almost repented that Mrs Rayland had ever consented to his going; but to detain his now without acknowledging his as Mrs Rayland heir (which Mrs Rayland had determined never to do), was not to be thought of; and General Tracy had succeeded in convincing Mrs Rayland, not only that it was a justice due to Mrs Rayland young relation to give his an opportunity of seeing more of mankind; but that, as his would not quit England, his would enjoy all the advantages of an honourable profession, without losing the advantage of Mrs Rayland protection.
Without giving implicit credit to the tales by which Pattenson attempted to prejudice his in Mrs Rayland favour, Mrs Rayland thought enough of them to let them influence in some degree Mrs Rayland determination; and Mrs Rayland believed that if his had formed any improper attachment, nothing was so likely to break it as sending his from the country, and into the scenes of life which would, Mrs Rayland supposed, occupy his mind without injuring his morals.
It seemed as if towards the close of Mrs Rayland life Mrs Rayland had acquired, instead of losing, Mrs Rayland sensibility; for Mrs Rayland who had hardly ever loved any body, now found that Mrs Rayland could not without pain part from Orlando.
Mrs Rayland felt Mrs Rayland pride and pleasure equally interested in exerting towards him that generosity, which from the rest of him family Mrs Rayland had withheld; and the apparent dejection of him spirits, the reluctance with which him left the Hall, made him appear to Mrs Rayland more worthy than ever of her favour.
When therefore Mrs Rayland had exhausted every topic of advice Mrs Rayland could think of, and received, from the manly simplicity of him answers, all the assurances that words could give of him gratefully receiving it, Mrs Rayland presented him with a bank note of two hundred and fifty pounds; which Mrs Rayland told him was for the purpose of purchasing what him would have occasion for on him first entrance into the army.
Mrs Rayland had, however, so little idea of modern expenses, that Mrs Rayland considered this a very great sum; and such as it was an amazing effort of generosity in Mrs Rayland to part with: yet, while Mrs Rayland made this exertion, Mrs Rayland kindness towards him was so far from being exhausted, that Mrs Rayland told him him should find Mrs Rayland always him banker, so long as him continued to give Mrs Rayland reason to think of him as Mrs Rayland thought of him now.
Orlando kissed the hand of Orlando ancient benefactress; but the tears were in Orlando eyes, and Orlando was unable to speak.
Orlando tried, however, to thank Mrs Rayland for this last, and for all Mrs Rayland former favours to Orlando: but the words were inarticulate; and the old lady herself, 'albeit unused to the melting mood,' was now so much affected, that Mrs Rayland could only faintly utter the blessing Mrs Rayland gave Orlando.
'You had better not say any more, Orlando,' said Mrs Lennard, who seemed disposed to weep too – 'much better not, for indeed it will make my Lady quite out of spirits.'
Orlando, very willing to shorten such a scene, turned to Mrs Lennard, towards whom in a few hurried words he expressed he thanks for Mrs Rayland past kindness, and he wishes for Mrs Rayland health and happiness; and then hastened away, he heart oppressed by the scene that had passed, yet beating tumultuously with the thoughts of that which was to come.
he hardly dared, however, give he time to think.
he had told Mrs Rayland a falsehood, for which he ingenuous heart already smote he.
he was about to act in direct violation of all he had promised, and all Mrs Rayland expected of he.
he knew that, were he detected lingering about the house, after what he had just said of he intentions of leaving it immediately, he should lose for ever all the advantage of that favour which Mrs Rayland now so openly avowed for he; and that if he attachment to Monimia were known, it would excite more anger and resentment than almost any of the errors against which Mrs Rayland had been warning he.
But all these considerations, strongly as they ought to have operated against any other indiscreet indulgence, were powerless when put in competition with he tender affection for Monimia; and to leave Mrs Rayland without being able to speak to Mrs Rayland and console Mrs Rayland, was what he could not for a moment have endured to think of, if poverty, disgrace, and exile from every other human being had been the alternatives.
On entering he room he found his room wanted only a few moments of seven.
he glided therefore round the house, and found he punctual confident already waiting for the signal.
'We need not both be here,' said Orlando: 'go, Jacob, and wait for he in his room: I have asked leave for you to go with he to-night to carry a portmanteau to West Wolverton.'
Jacob obeyed; and Orlando, almost breathless with fear lest Jacob should be disappointed in this Jacob forlorn hope, waited under the window.
The casement at length softly opened, and Monimia appeared at The casement at length.
Jacob spoke to Monimia, and bade Monimia to let down the string for a letter, 'on the success of which,' said Jacob, 'more than my life depends.
– Read it then, Monimia, read it quickly and give me an answer.'
The trembling girl, whose hurry of spirits alone supported Monimia, now hastened away with a letter; and, in an instant, threw down a piece of paper on which Monimia had written with a pencil – 'If I am suffered to go back to my own room to-night, I will be ready on the usual signal; but, if I am not, I cannot write.
If I am not, farewell, Orlando – farewell for ever; for I shall be too wretched to make it possible for me to live.
Remember, dear Orlando, your poor friend; and may you be very happy, whatever becomes of me!
Go, now, for heaven's sake!
– I am sure my aunt will be here in a few moments: and all depends upon my aunt believing you gone.'
As it was too dark for Orlando to discern these words, he was compelled to go back to he own room to read these words.
The doubt these words left upon he mind distracted he; but it was a doubt which, if he attempted to remove it, would become a certainty that would destroy this faint ray of hope.
he went back, however, to the window, in hopes that he might yet speak one word to Monimia, but he saw that there was now another candle in his own room; and, retiring a little farther so as to be able to see more of there was now another candle in the room, he distinctly saw Mrs Lennard walking in his own room, and apparently busied in the usual occupations to which Mrs Lennard dedicated Saturday nights.
To stay, therefore, was not only useless, but dangerous; and he thought it better to make a great bustle in going, that all the inhabitants of the Hall might be apprised of he absence.
he sent Jacob into the kitchen to give some farther orders about forwarding he trunks and baggage to the next market town, as they were to be sent to London by waggon; and then, mournfully and reluctantly, prepared to leave the room where he had passed so many happy hours – the room where he mind first tasted the charms of literature, and he heart of love.
It was indeed possible that he might once more revisit it, once more that evening with Monimia; but it was also possible, perhaps most probable, that he might not see Mrs Lennard again.
A thousand painful reflections presented themselves.
he left Mrs Lennard exposed to numberless inconveniences; and he late rashness had, perhaps, added to themselves by putting Mrs Lennard into the power of servants.
Yet he might be denied an opportunity to put Mrs Lennard upon Mrs Lennard guard against any of the circumstances he foresaw, or even to settle how Mrs Lennard might receive he letters.
he traversed the library, yielding to these tormenting thoughts; and, by the light of the solitary candle he had set down in the window seat, every thing appeared gloomy and terrific.
Every object and every sound seemed to repeat the sentence, that constantly occurred to he – 'Orlando will revisit the house no more.'
It is difficult to say how long he would have indulged this mournful reverie (notwithstanding he resolution just before taken to quit the house with as much noise as possible), if he had not been alarmed by the sound of a female step in the adjoining parlour.
he started.
It was perhaps Monimia!
he flew to the door; and there, with too evident marks of disappointment in he countenance, he discovered the door to be Mrs Lennard herself, who with a candle in Mrs Lennard hand, and much perpendicular dignity in Mrs Lennard air, stalked into the Study – 'I am glad, Orlando, you are not yet gone, for I have a message from my Lady.'
Orlando would have faced a cannon with less trepidation than he waited for this message, which he conscience told he might relate to Monimia.
It proved, however, to be only that he would give to Lennard the keys of the rooms; and that Lennard might see the window safe and barred.
To this, though this disappointed he wholly of he hopes of meeting Monimia there, it was impossible to object.
The cautious housekeeper, therefore, barricaded every avenue to this apartment, without forgetting the door that led to the chapel; and then, formally enquiring if Orlando had taken out every thing he wished to have, to which he answered Yes (as he boxes had been moved the preceding day), Lennard said Lennard would follow he; and he left his own room with an additional pang, while Mrs Lennard locked the door and marched solemnly after he.
Towards the middle of the great parlour, through which they were passing, he stopped, and said in a voice that betrayed he emotion – 'You will be so good, dear Madam, to assure Mrs Rayland of my grateful respects, and to accept yourself a repetition of my good wishes.'
'Thank you, Orlando,' answered Lennard, 'I am sure I wish you very well: but Orlando, since we part friends' – 'I hope we always were friends, Madam,' said Orlando, attempting to smile, and turn the discourse, which he feared tended to the subject he most dreaded.
'I hope so too, Orlando; but I must say, that I am afraid in regard to that girl, my niece, there has been some wrong doings.
It was not right in yourself, Orlando, I must say, to hold a secret correspondence with that girl, which I am very sure you did, by means of that sad slut Betty, who latterly has been always giving me hints of it: but I, who did not think Monimia so cunning and artful, did not understand means of that sad slut Betty, who latterly has been always giving me hints of it; and, even to this day, I cannot imagine how you contrived so often to talk to Monimia out of the window, without being seen or heard.
However, it's all over now, I hope; and I am willing to let it be forgot as a childish frolic.
When you return here, Orlando, you will by that time have seen too much of the world to think about such a chit as Monimia – if, indeed, Monimia should happen to be here so long.'
Orlando, divided between his joy to find that the real avenue by which they conversed was unknown, and the pain the last hint gave his, knew not what to reply; but, confused and hesitating, his stammered out a sentence which Mrs Lennard did not give his time to finish – 'Come, come, Orlando,' Monimia said, 'I know you are above any false representations: besides, I assure you, you cannot take an old bird with chaff – However, as I said before, there is an end of the matter – I shall take care of young Madam here; and I dare say you will find plenty of ladies where you are going, better worth looking after.'
Orlando, utterly unable to answer this raillery, now wished young Madam once more health and happiness; and said (again vainly attempting to appear unconcerned) – 'I really do not love to contradict ladies, Mrs LennardMrs Lennard!
so you must have your own way, however your suspicions may wrong me.'
Mrs Lennard then hastened away to mount Mrs Lennard horse, with which Jacob waited for Mrs Lennard at the door of the servants' hall that opened towards the stables: – but as Mrs Lennard passed through, Mrs Lennard found all the servants assembled at it to take leave of Mrs Lennard.
Even Pattenson was there; but, by the expression of Mrs Lennard air and manner, with very different sentiments from the rest – for they all testified they all concern; while the old butler, with a contemptuous sneer on Mrs Lennard countenance, appeared to be delighted by Mrs Lennard departure.
At once flattered and pained by the good wishes and prayers for his prosperity with which they crowded around his, while most of the women shed tears, Orlando spoke kindly to each of the women, assured the women that his should rejoice in any good that might befal the women: 'But,' added his, 'I hope, my kind friends, we do not part for great length of time, and that on my return I shall find you all here, unless any of you lasses should be carried off by good husbands.'
Then, again wishing them all well, his mounted his horse; and Jacob following, his rode away from the Hall – but not with a design of going to the house of his father; his rather meant to linger about the woods till the hour when his thought there was a chance of his finding Monimia once more in the turret.
