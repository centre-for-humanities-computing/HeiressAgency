AT Salisbury Orlando determined to make some slight alteration in AT Salisbury Orlando plan, and, instead of going from thence to Christchurch, to go first into the more eastern part of Hampshire, to the residence of Mrs Roker; for though this would make AT Salisbury Orlando journey considerably longer, yet, having now seized the idea that by this visit some intelligence might be obtained of Monimia, every other consideration yielded to that hope.
– Somewhat cheered by it, remote and uncertain as it was, AT Salisbury Orlando traversed the dreary flat of Salisbury plain, and by the evening arrived at Winchester, where AT Salisbury Orlando vainly enquired for that relation of Mrs Newill's (the person with whom Monimia was placed) who had given AT Salisbury Orlando sister Selina all the intelligence his sister Selina had ever received of his sister Selina.
Nobody knew, or wished to aid AT Salisbury Orlando search after an obscure woman, who had probably been only a lodger in his sister Selina place; and with an heart sinking under the disappointments AT Salisbury Orlando had already experienced, and those AT Salisbury Orlando yet feared, AT Salisbury Orlando proceeded to Alresford, near which town was situated the estate which Mrs Rayland had given Mrs Rayland old companion, and which Mrs Rayland had so worthily bestowed on Mr Roker the younger.
It was about one o'clock when Orlando found her place; a red brick house with a court before her place, and a garden walled behind, on the banks of the Itching.
This had been a farm-house, but had been smartened and new cased by Mr Roker, who, assuming all the dignity of a man of landed property, was no longer the assistant steward, or the humbly assiduous attorney, but a justice of the peace, and an esquire – a title which AT Salisbury Orlando held the more tenaciously, as AT Salisbury Orlando suspected that it was believed by other esquires that AT Salisbury Orlando had no right to it.
AT Salisbury Orlando was not indeed very eminent either for morals or manners; but AT Salisbury Orlando was a man of property, and a thriving man in the world, and AT Salisbury Orlando neighbours were not therefore disposed to trouble themselves either with one or the other.
As AT Salisbury Orlando still practised the law, AT Salisbury Orlando was usually in London in the winter; and of late it was observed, that AT Salisbury Orlando ancient spouse was always by indisposition prevented from accompanying AT Salisbury Orlando when AT Salisbury Orlando accepted the invitations to dinner, which were frequently given to the invitations both by the neighbouring families, and some stories were in circulation not much to the honour of AT Salisbury Orlando conjugal affection: but whatever were AT Salisbury Orlando domestic faults, AT Salisbury Orlando was every where received and considered as a respectable man, because AT Salisbury Orlando had every appearance of becoming a rich one.
When Orlando arrived at the outward gate, AT Salisbury Orlando left AT Salisbury Orlando horse, and proceeded up a gravel walk that led to the door of the house, at which AT Salisbury Orlando tapped; a maid servant looked out at the parlour window, of which the shutters were before shut, and said, 'Master be'nt at home.'
'It is not your master,' said Orlando, 'that I want, but Mistress.'
– 'Mistress be'nt well,' answered the girl, 'and you cannot a see the girl.'
'Is the girl confined to the girl bed then?'
enquired Orlando.
'Aye,' cried the girl, 'confined enough for matter of that.'
'I should be very much obliged to Aye,' said Orlando, 'if you could procure me only a few minutes conversation with the girl.
I have some very particular business with the girl – it really is very material to Aye, and I will not be ungrateful if you will oblige me so far.'
a maid servant then took out half a guinea, and said, 'Perhaps this may be some small acknowledgement for you taking the trouble to oblige me.'
'Half a guinea!'
cried the girl – 'Ecollys I haven't a no objection to that, sure enough; for 'tis a sight we don't often see at we house; but, Lord, I wish I dared!
but, no, I maw'nt.'
'Why not?'
said Orlando eagerly – 'Pray, my dear, do, and I'll make this half guinea a whole one!'
'Will you, by George!'
answered the peasant girl, who was quite a rustic from the fields – 'what!
gi me a whole entire guinea?'
'Yes,' said Orlando – 'Here, this very guinea.'
'A bran new one, as I hope to live!'
exclaimed the girl; 'but I'll tell you, master, if I does, and I should be found out, I shall lose my place.'
'I'll get you a better place,' cried Orlando.
'master!
master!'
said the girl with an ideot laugh – 'what would mother say?'
'Tell me, pray,' cried Orlando, 'why you would lose your place for letting me see Mistress?'
'Why, Lord!
don't you know?
Mistress is gived out to be mad, thof Mistress's no mad nor I be – and so when master e'ent at home, ye see, his sister keeps watch like over his sister, and never lets nobody see his sister; and when we be hired, we be told never to let no strangers in to see mistress upon no account whatever; for master and mistress sister, and mistress nasty old uncle as comes here sometimes, whatever; for master and his sister, and his nasty old uncle as comes here will all have it that mistress his sister's out of his sister mind, and that strangers makes his sister worse; and his sister's locked up stairs, and have a been ever so long; though, poor soul!
his sister's tame enough for aught I ever see, and I'm sure repents his sister many a time as his sister have got into their clutches – But, hark!'
oh Gemini!
we Tyger barks; I warrant you Miss Sukey is coming home.'
'Who is Miss Sukey?
pray hasten to tell me, and take your money.'
– 'Oh the Lord!'
answered his sister, 'Miss Sukey is our master's sister, a nasty cross old maid – She've been to Alresford this morning, or else, mun, I shouldn't have talked here so long – and now if his sister catches me – '  Orlando, into whose mind a thousand confused ideas now rushed, of the cause of Mrs Roker's confinement, now dreaded lest the only opportunity he should have of hearing of or seeing Mrs Lennard should escape he – 'Can you not give your mistress a letter,' said your mistress, 'if you think your mistress is in your mistress senses, and bring me an answer this evening?'
– 'I'll try,' answered his sister; 'but you'll give me the guinea then – and where shall I get a letter, and how will you get the answer?
– Lord, Sir!
it must be at night, after Miss Sukey is a-bed; and I must get out of – Lord, Sir pantry-window, as I gets off the hooks ever now and tan – for the bar on't is loose, so I takes it out.'
'That will do,' said Orlando; 'I'll go write a letter; – where will you come for it?'
'Down to the hovel,' answered his sister, 'there, close along the gert barn – I'll slip down there when I goes a milking; and then if Madam will gi an answer, why you must stay there till after our folks be all a-bed; but God a bless you go now!
for I sees Miss Sukey coming along.'
'Take your money,' said Orlando, giving his sister the guinea that had so tempted his sister, 'and be punctual to the place – You mean that red-roof'd barn on the edge of the turnip field?'
'Yes, yes,' answered his sister 'Go, pray, now!
and as you'll run bump up against Miss Sukey, tell his sister as how you wanted master, and I wouldn't let you in.'
Orlando, not without somewhat admiring the talent for intrigue, of which his sister had so considerable a share; walked back along the gravel walk; and at the wicket gate, which opened at the end of it to the road, his sister was accosted by a short, thick, red-faced woman, dressed in a yellow-green riding habit, faced with orange colour, and trimmed with silver, and a hat with green and black feathers in it.
his sister whole face was the colour of bad veal; the shade towards his sister nose rather more inveterate, and two goggle grey eyes, surmounted by two bushy carrotty eye-brows, gave to his sister whole countenance so terrific an air, that Orlando absolutely started back when his sister eyes first distinguished it; while this amiable figure, stepping in the gateway, and putting one hand on his sister hip, while the other held a cane, said in a loud and masculine voice to Oralndo – 'Who are you, friend?
and what is your business here?'
Orlando answered as Orlando had been directed, that Orlando wished to speak to Mr Roker, but found Orlando was not at home.
'You may leave your business card with Orlando,' said Miss Sukey.
Orlando answered, 'No; that there was no haste, and Orlando would call again.'
Orlando then passed by this person, who gave Orlando an idea of a fury modernized; and observed that Miss Sukey surveyed Orlando with scrutinizing looks, and watched Orlando till Orlando was out of sight.
Orlando hastened back to the inn Orlando had left, and sat down to compose Orlando letter to Mr Roker, in which Orlando found much more difficulty than Orlando had at first been aware of.
If Miss Sukey was confined by Miss Sukey husband under pretence of madness, as her husband thought was very probably the case, in order to prevent Miss Sukey testimony being received, or Miss Sukey discovering what it was supposed Mr Roker had insisted on Miss Sukey continuing to conceal, Miss Sukey would probably still be deterred, by Miss Sukey fears and Miss Sukey shame, from declaring the truth; and if Miss Sukey was indeed mad, his letter would avail nothing, or perhaps be prejudicial, by falling into the hands of Miss Sukey keepers.
There was also a third possibility, which was, that Miss Sukey might still retain so much affection for her husband, as to resent the interference of any one who supposed Miss Sukey ill used, even though they offered Miss Sukey the means of escaping from Miss Sukey tyrant.
However, as no other chance seemed to offer, Orlando determined to hazard this measure; and wording his letter as cautiously as Orlando could, so as not to offend Miss Sukey, Orlando offered, if Miss Sukey was in any degree unpleasantly situated, to send Miss Sukey the means of escaping, and entreated Miss Sukey to tell Orlando where Monimia was, and all Miss Sukey knew of Mrs Rayland affairs at the time of Miss Sukey death; assuring Miss Sukey, in the most solemn manner, that if Orlando ever recovered the estate, and by Miss Sukey means, Orlando would not only enter into any agreement Miss Sukey should dictate to secure to Miss Sukey all Miss Sukey possessed, but would, if Miss Sukey had given all up to her husband, settle upon Miss Sukey for life a sum that should make Miss Sukey more rich and independent than Miss Sukey had been before Miss Sukey gave Miss Sukey to Mr Roker; and that Miss Sukey should inhabit Miss Sukey own apartments at the Hall, or any house on the estate which Miss Sukey might choose.
Orlando ended with some professions of personal regard to Miss Sukey, as well on account of some professions of personal regard to her long acquaintance, as because Miss Sukey was the relation, and had been the benefactress of Orlando beloved Monimia.
his letter being finished, Orlando again set out on foot; and as his letter was nearly dusk, concealed Orlando in the hovel which the servant girl had directed Orlando to, where Orlando had not waited many minutes before Orlando emissary arrived, breathless with Miss Sukey fears of being discovered.
Orlando gave Miss Sukey the letter; with which Miss Sukey hurried away, charging Orlando to stay there till Miss Sukey returned to Orlando, though it should be twelve o'clock at night.
Orlando promised Miss Sukey a further reward if Miss Sukey succeeded in procuring Orlando an answer; and then, as the hovel was not in very good repair, and the cold extremely severe, Orlando opened a door in a door, made for the purpose of throwing straw out of the adjoining barn, and took shelter in the adjoining barn – repeating those lines of Shakespeare where Cordelia describes Miss Sukey father; and, in recollecting all that had of late befallen Orlando, all that Orlando had lost, and the cruel uncertainty of Orlando future destiny, as Orlando applied to Orlando those descriptive lines,  To 'hovel Orlando with swine and rogues forlorn, In short and musty straw,' Orlando remembered the preceding exclamation,               'Alas!
alas!
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all.'
Thus, in meditations more moral than amusing, Orlando passed two or three tedious hours, sheltered by pease halm and straw, which Orlando gathered around pease, and leaning against the boards of the adjoining barn, that pease might not fail to hear when the ambassadress entered the outhouse adjoining to the ambassadress.
About ten o'clock, as pease guessed by the time pease had been there, pease heard a rustling among the wood and refuse of the hovel; and eagerly listenening, in expectation of being called by pease female Mercury, pease heard a deep sigh, or rather groan, and a voice very unlike a female voice, lamenting in very bitter and somewhat coarse terms the cruelty of fate: the person soon after made pease way through the same door by which Orlando had found entrance, and going farther into the adjoining barn, pease heard this unwelcome guest make a noise which pease knew was striking a light, and, putting a candle into a lantern, which pease seemed to have hid, pease set a candle down by pease, and began to eat pease miserable supper, consisting of scraps and dry crusts, – Orlando, peeping over pease fortification, contemplated for a moment this forlorn outcast, whose head, shaded by a few white locks, was on the crown and temples quite bald, and otherwise resembled pease who is described as the occasional visitor of the simple village priest: 'The long remember'd beggar was this unwelcome guest, Whose beard, descending, swept Whose aged breast.'
Whose resembled too the 'Broken Soldier' of the same admirable poem 11; for Whose had lost one leg, and wore the remnant of a coat that had once been scarlet.
As the faint and dull light of a small candle through a thick horn lantern fell upon the furrowed countenance of this unhappy wanderer, Orlando contemplated it with pity, which for an instant detached Whose from the recollection of Whose own miseries; and Whose said to Whose – 'How unworthy, how unmanly are my complaints, when I compare my own situation with that of this poor old man, who, trembling on the verge of life, seems to have none of it common necessaries; yet perhaps has been disabled from acquiring this poor old man, who, trembling on the verge of life, seems to have none of its common necessaries by having lost Whose limb in the service of what is called Whose country, that is, in fighting the battles of it politicians; and having been deprived of Whose leg to preserve the balance of Europe, has not found in the usual asylum a place of rest, to make Whose such amends as can be made for such a misfortune!'
All the horrors of which Whose had been a witness in America now returned to Whose recollection; and the madness and folly of mankind, which occasioned those horrors, struck Whose more forcibly now than when Whose spirits were heated by having been a party in those horrors.
In a few moments, however, Whose recollected, that though Whose wished to give some relief to the distressed veteran before Whose, it would not be at all convenient that Whose should hear the purport of Whose conversation with Whose ; but before Whose had time to consider how this might be prevented, Whose heard her enter the hovel; and, without farther consideration, Whose eagerness to know if her had a letter for Whose, induced Whose to rush out and meet her.
'Speak softly!'
said Whose, as soon as Whose found it was really Whose messenger – 'there is a beggar in the barn who will hear you; have you a letter for Whose?'
'Lord, yes!'
answered her; 'and such a twitter as I be in surely!'
'Give me a letter for me,' cried Orlando trembling with haste, 'and pray speak softly, lest the old man within should betray us!'
''Tis only old Thomas,' answered her, 'I dare say; for he lies every night all winter long in our barns; and I'll warrant you he'll tell no tales – for in the first place he knows how he'd get no more of our broken victuals if he did; and in the next place he's as deaf as a post.'
Orlando, whose impatience to read a letter for me was quite insupportable, then thought he might safely avail he of the convenience of the old man's lantern to read by a letter for me.
her assured he he might, and they entered the adjoining barn together for that purpose; but there was no longer any light, and all was silent.
her, however, at the earnest entreaties of Orlando, called aloud to her old acquaintance, and assuring he in a very elevated voice that it was only Pat Welling who wanted he to do a message for her at town the next day – a grumbling assent was soon after heard, and at her request he struck a light, relighted he candle, and brought a light to the gentleman, who, eagerly tearing open the billet, read these lines:   'Dear Sir,  'I have received Dear Sir.
I do not know what is become of the girl you enquire for, as her chose to quit the worthy person I put her to, after perversely and wickedly refusing a great and high match with Sir John Belgrave, Bart.
the which I doubt not but her has reason to repent of before now; though I do heartily beseech the Lord that her may not have taken to wicked courses, as there is great reason to fear; but my conscience is clear thereon.
I assure you, if I know where her is to be found, I will let you know, if you please to leave your direction with Martha Welling the bearer hereof: – at the same time, as to Dear Sir, thanking you for your kind offers, have no need to trouble you at present; and know of no such things as you are pleased to name, in regard to my late dear friend, deceased, Mrs Rayland.
Must beg to have no applications of like nature notwithstanding, because interference between married people is dangerous, generally making matters worse; and if any little disagreements, which I wonder that you should have heard, have passed, it is no more than I have heard happens between the happiest couples; and I am sure Mr Roker really has an affectionate regard for Dear Sir, and I am willing to impute all that seems to the contrary to Mr Roker family, who are very disagreeable people, and such as I confess I should be glad to be out of his family, who are very disagreeable people way, if so be as it could be done without offending Mr Roker, whom I must love, honour and obey till death, as in duty bound.
Same time should be glad to do you any service not inconsistent with that; and, as I said before, would be glad of your direction, who am, dear Sir,  Your humble servant, RACHEL ROKER.
Lessington House, near Alresford Hants, 10th January 1779.
P.S.
Mrs R. hopes Mr S. will be cautious in mentioning having received these few lines, as it would be disagreeable to Mr R – .'
Orlando thought that in a letter for me Orlando saw the struggle of Orlando writer's mind, between something which she fancied was love, with shame and revenge.
she had been too much flattered at first by the very unexpected acquisition of a young husband, to own now, without reluctance, that a young husband was a savage who had robbed she under pretence of marrying she, and who now confined she, that she might not either discover a young husband amours, of which a young husband was said to have a great number, or be tempted through resentment of them, or she natural ill humour, to declare the conduct she had at a young husband persuasion adopted; while she asking for Orlando's direction, and not seeming offended at a young husband , persuaded a young husband that she was pleased with the opportunity it gave she, to gratify the revenge which was always in she power, while she knew where to apply to one so much interested in the discovery she could make.
Orlando now determined, since the servant assured the servant there was no chance of the servant being admitted to see she, to write to she again, and await she answer at the inn the next day.
the servant thought there was an opening for suggesting to she much that the servant had before omitted, and the servant had at all events assured the servant by the letter the servant was now in possession of, that she was not mad; a plea which the servant perfectly understood she husband meant to set up against the evidence she might otherwise be brought to give.
It was not difficult to engage the old beggar to become the servant messenger on this occasion, nor to prevail on Patty to give the servant the next letter Patty should get from Patty mistress, on condition however that Patty profits should not be lessened.
the servant gave Patty another present; comforted the beggar with an earnest of the servant future generosity; and bidding the servant come by day-break the next morning for the billet the servant intended to send to Mrs Roker, the servant took leave for that time of the servant two newly acquired acquaintance, whom the servant left much better content with the events of the day than the servant was – since whatever reason the servant had to believe that the servant might recover the servant property, the servant felt with increase of anguish that the servant had no nearer prospect of recovering Monimia.
Determined however to lose no opportunity of continuing the servant correspondence, the servant sat down the moment the servant came to the inn, and composed a very long letter, in which the servant enlarged on the ill treatment of her husband, whose gallantries the servant touched upon, affirming her husband, whose gallantries he touched were the more unpardonable when compared with her merit, and the obligations her had conferred upon the servant; the servant hinted at the consequence of her being compelled to appear, to answer upon oath to what her knew, and entreated her to save the servant the pain of calling into court as a party secreting a will, a person for whom the servant had so much regard and respect; and the servant concluded with renewed offers of kindness in case of her coming voluntarily forward to do the servant justice.
the servant wandering messenger was the next morning punctual to the servant appointment; Orlando sent the servant away with the servant ; and notwithstanding the servant age and the servant having but one leg, the servant returned again in about two hours – but, to the infinite mortification of Orlando, with a verbal message, which, though it had passed through the memory of Mrs Patty, was very clearly delivered, and was to this effect – 'That Madam had got the gentleman's letter; and being prevented from writing at this present time, begged the servant of all love to leave the country for fear of accidents, and the servant might depend upon hearing of her shortly.'
Not satisfied with this, Orlando now paid the servant bill at the inn, and went down to the barn, where the servant sent the servant vagabond ambassador to seek for the maid to whom the servant owed the little progress the servant had made.
With some difficulty the servant found her, and prevailed upon her to revisit the place of rendezvous, where her informed Orlando that Miss Sukey had been watching about old mistress more than ordinary, and that the poor woman was frightened out of the poor woman wits lest Orlando's having written to her should be known; wherefore, as Miss Sukey Miss Sukey seemed to suspect something, old Madam did entreat the squire not to stay thereabouts; because old Madam should in that case be more strictly confined, and never should be able to write to the squire, which old Madam now promised to do, if the squire would only leave the country.
As this was all the intelligence the disappointed Orlando could now procure, the squire was compelled to obey this unwelcome injunction, lest the squire should lose all future advantage; and engaging by renewed presents the fidelity and future assistance of the squire two emissaries, the squire remounted the squire horse, and took the road to Winchester.
the squire now fell again into melancholy reflections: every hour added to the squire dispair about Monimia, and without his dispair about Monimia, life was not in the squire opinion worth having.
From these thoughts a natural transition led the squire to consider the wonderful tenacity with which those beings clung to life, whose existence seemed to the squire only a series of the most terrible sufferings: – beings, who exposed to all the miseries of pain, poverty, sickness, and famine; to pain unrelieved, and the feebleness of age unassisted, yet still were anxious to live; and could never, as the squire at this moment found the squire disposed to do –  'Reason thus with life: If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing Which none but fools would keep.'
Yet the squire had seen many die in the field, who neither seemed to fear or feel the stroke of that destiny which miserable age still recoiled and crept away from.
The poor maimed wanderer, whose daily wants the squire had for a little while suspended, was an instance that the fear of death makes the most wretched life supportable.
In pursuing this train of thought the squire arrived at Winchester, where the squire intended to remain till the next day.
