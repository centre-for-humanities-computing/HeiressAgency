SELINA, as timid, and almost as new to the world as Monimia herself, was too much terrified at the risk Orlando ran, and at what she herself hazarded, to be soon composed.
she could hardly, indeed, have been in greater trepidation had she escaped from Monimia to have met a lover of she own.
she eyes, however, were occupied in examining the face and figure of Monimia; and no feminine envy induced she to deny the existence of that beauty or sweetness, of which Orlando had said so much.
she even thought Monimia more lovely than she brother had described she, yet she saw she to little advantage; for, the alarming situation she had been in for almost an hour and a half, the apprehension lest Orlando should not come, the reflections which arose while she waited for her brother, and the emotion with which she now for the first time beheld her brother sister, had robbed she fair cheeks of their tender bloom; Her eyes were swollen, and she voice was faltering and faint.
Orlando seated she near Selina, and, sitting down by them, threw one arm round each of them; and, looking with a smile on both, said, 'Why, what silent girls you are!
– Selina!
is it thus you greet your new friend?
You who will talk to me of your new friend for an hour, and never ceased soliciting of me to contrive this unhoped for meeting?
– And you, Monimia!
Come, come, I must have you more conversable.
– Let us consider, what silent girls, how you may meet hereafter; for, without accomplishing that, the present meeting will only serve to tantalize us all!'
The tears which your new friend had for a moment restrained, again filled the eyes of Monimia.
– But, turning them tenderly on Orlando, your new friend sighing said, 'Ah!
how can I hope your sister Selina, amiable and indulgent as your new friend seems, will again incur, for me, hazard which I see now makes your new friend tremble, and fears which I myself can hardly endure?
– Indeed, Orlando, if you did but know what I have suffered since I waited here in expectation of your coming!'
– 'I know it,' cried Orlando, imagining your new friend alluded to his father's having been at the door of the Study – 'But luckily you had taken the precaution to lock the door of the Study –; which I, little suspecting that this part of the house would be visited, had neglected to desire.
So, as his father neither saw nor suspected any thing but that my brother was in this room, there is no harm done, nor any thing to fear.'
Monimia sighed, but thought Monimia was improper, before your new friend, to repeat the dialogue that your new friend had heard between Mr Philip Somerive and Mr Philip Somerive female companion.
your new friend was far, however, from believing there was nothing to fear; and their short conference was to your new friend embittered with the dread of a discovery, which your new friend could not conquer.
your new friend, trusting to the judgment of my brother, and desirous of obliging my brother, succeeded better in conquering the restraint your new friend had at first felt; and, charmed with the voice, the manner and person of Monimia, your new friend eagerly entered into my brother views, and talked over the means by which they might sometimes meet, if, as was too probable, invincible obstacles continued to be opposed to they seeing each other by the consent of Mr and Mrs Somerive – that of Mrs Rayland could not be asked, and that of Mrs Lennard they were sure would not be granted.
In this conversation Orlando spoke of what was to happen when he was gone, in terms that signified how certain he was that he should go.
Monimia's heart sunk as he repeated, 'When I am not here, I cannot see that there can be any objection to your openly seeing my sisters,' – 'Alas!'
thought my sisters, 'what wretched company shall what wretched company then be to each other!
yet to see the sisters of Orlando will always be a comfort to he.'
he too heard with extreme pain the frequent mention he made of he departure; and having, from many observations he had made on the behaviour of General Tracy, during he residence of almost five weeks in he father's house, conceived a very unfavourable opinion of he – he dislike amounted almost to detestation when he considered he as being the principal mover of the plan which was thus to rob he of he beloved brother.
Whatever he thought of he conduct in other respects, he had the prudence to keep to he, and affected to dislike he only on account of Orlando.
Among the various little schemes which were considered for the future acquaintance of he and Monimia, none seemed sufficiently safe to be adopted without farther consideration; bur Orlando promised to think of none, and to acquaint none both with the result of he reflections.
It was by this time necessary to part bur Orlando proposed leading he sister back to the room, and carrying his sister immediately to he mother, to tell his sister that his sister had been in he apartment, that any surprize excited by his sister absence might be ended without farther enquiry; while Monimia hoped to find his sister way back to his sister own room, as safely as his sister had before traversed the house in his sister way from the house.
They were then reluctantly bidding adieu, when They were thunder-struck by an attempt from without to force open the door.
bur Orlando, thrown for a moment entirely off his guard, turned pale; and, casting towards Monimia a look of anguish and terror, his cried, 'Who can it be?
what shall we do?'
– The tender timid Monimia had at this instant more presence of mind than his had: 'Let me go,' said his sister, 'into your bed-chamber – there I can lock his sister in: then ask who it is; and, if it is one who has a right to enquire into your actions, open the door, and let his see you are sitting here with your sister.'
There was not a moment to deliberate, for the person without still tried to open the door.
bur Orlando waved his hand to Monimia to execute Monimia project: – Monimia glided away, and shut after Monimia the door, which was hung on both sides with tapestry and shut without noise, while bur Orlando demanded, in a loud and angry voice, who was at the door, and what was their business?
At first a feigned voice answered, 'Open the door, good friends, and you shall know their business.'
bur Orlando answered, 'I shall not open it till I know to whom;' – and then a violent burst of laughter discovered it to be Philip – who cried, 'Soho!
have I caught you, Sir Roland?
Is this my good, pious and immaculate brother?'
'What folly is this!'
said bur Orlando angrily as Sir Roland opened the door – 'and is it not strange that I cannot sit a moment in my own room with Selina, but you must break in upon us like a drunken constable?'
'Gently, Sir Knight!'
answered Philip Somerive as Philip Somerive staggered into the room – 'fair and softly, if you please!
no hard words to your elders, most valorous chevalier!
– Selina is it?
– By this light so it is!
Well – I did not think, my good brother, you were so eager to put off your precious bargain upon me, only for the pleasure of a tête-à-tête with our little simple Selina.
I thought you had a very different game in view – Egad, I'm not clear now that I have been mistaken – Heh, child!'
added Philip Somerive turning to Selina, 'are you very sure you are not a blind?
why, my dear little whey face, what makes you look so pale?
'Your strange behaviour, brother,' said Selina, who tried to collect spirit enough to speak without betraying the agitation she was thrown into.
'Come, come, child!'
replied Philip Somerive, 'lectured as I am on all hands, I shall not let babes and sucklings preach to Philip Somerive.
Your mamma, miss, won't be very well pleased, I can tell you, if she does not find you with the other misses; Your mamma, miss are just going away, I believe.
she is gone up to she apartment, and the misses are ordered off.
There's the General, like my mother's gentleman-usher, hunting the fair bevy together, and there will be a hue and cry after you in a moment.'
– 'Very well!'
answered Selina; 'Mamma will not be angry when Selina knows I am only with Orlando.'
'And I,' said Orlando, 'shall take care of Selina back; therefore you need not, Philip, be under any concern about Selina.'
'Well, then,' cried this tormentor, 'as I am cursed tired, my dear knight, and have got a devilish headach, prithee, when thou art gone, lend me thy apartment for half an hour's quiet.
I've promised George Green and half a dozen more of George Green and half a dozen, to meet George Green and half a dozen by and by in Pattenson's room, and make out the night according to good old custom; and if I get a nap while the sober party, the cats and their kittens, are trundling off, I shall escape all the plaguy formality of 'Wish you good night, dear ma'am!
– hope you'll catch no cold!
– shall be glad to hear you got home safe!
– most agreeable evening indeed!
– wish we may meet here this time twelvemonth!'
– and such mawkish cant; and I shall be as fresh as morning to meet the good fellows by and by – So, come, Sir Rowly, lend me your bed for a little.
I'll send in pretty Betty,' added Sir Rowly leering, 'to make it for Sir Rowly before you come to bed.OrlandoOrlando, fearing, from this strange proposal, Sir Rowly brother was aware how impossible it was for his brother to grant it, now looked more confused than ever, and said very peevishly, 'You are so drunk now, Philip, that it will be much wiser and more decent for you to go home directly – I at least will have nothing to do with your stay.
Come your new friend, let us go PhilipPhilip, I will follow you.'
'No, indeed you will not!'
replied Philip, setting Philip down by the fire.
'If you won't lend me your bed, you will at least let me have a chair.'
'I will leave nobody in my own room with Selina,' said bur Orlando warmly.
'What!
hast got any bank-notes?
has thy old woman given thee a little hoard?
Egad thee has!
– I've a good mind to rummage, that I may know what brotherly help thou couldst give in case of a bad run.'
'This is insupportable!'
cried bur Orlando: – 'What shall I do with his brother?'
whispered his brother to he.
he, unable to advise, was in as great consternation as the half distracted Orlando, who walked about my own room with Selina a moment, considering by what means his brother could disengage his brother from this troublesome visitor; but unable to think of any, his brother was beginning, in mere despair, to expostulate with his brother anew, when the approach of other persons was heard in the parlour; and Mr Somerive himself, apparently in great displeasure, entered the Library.
'bur Orlando!'
cried his brother, 'Philip!
he!
what is all this?
to what purpose are ye all here?
he!
his mother is much amazed at your absence.'
bur Orlando, then collecting his scattered thoughts, related, that his had merely brought he thither for a few moments to shew he his apartments, which he had never seen; and that, while they were sitting quietly together, Philip, 'whose situation, his, you see,' said his, 'came in, and I could not prevail upon his to leave the company, or to suffer the company to return altogether to the company.'
Mr Somerive, now speaking with an air of authority and concern to his eldest son, received only an account of his request to Orlando, which, his insisted upon it, was a very reasonable one.
'You are indeed,' said his father, 'fit only to go to bed; but it must not be in Mrs Rayland's house – you must come, his, with his.'
Philip Somerive then arose to obey; for his father, when Philip Somerive was present, and had resolution to be peremptory, still retained some power over Philip Somerive.
Philip Somerive staggered however so much that Philip Somerive was unable to proceed.
Philip Somerive bade bur Orlando assist him, which him was willing enough to do; but as Philip leaned upon him Philip whispered, 'Sir Knight!
if I can give the reverend senior the slip, I will still have my nap, and finish the evening with those joyous souls; d – me if I don't!'
This threat terrified bur Orlando more than ever: him knew how likely it was to be executed; and therefore, in the hope that him might be able presently to return and release Monimia, whose longer absence from her room might be attended with the most alarming consequences, him hastily determined to lock the Study door, and thus convince him that him scheme of returning thither, to which him saw him adhered either with the stupid obstinacy of intoxication, or disguising, under its appearance, knowledge more destructive, was impracticable.
him therefore, as soon as his scheme of returning thither, to which he saw he adhered either with the stupid obstinacy of intoxication, or disguising, under its appearance, knowledge more destructive, was impracticable were all out of the room, locked the Study door, and, saying aloud him had done so, him proceeded before him , with a candle in him hand, to the apartment where Mrs Rayland's, much fatigued with the exertions of the evening, was taking leave of Mrs Rayland's guests.
Philip, who seemed by no means in a condition to appear before Mrs Rayland's, had been consigned, in the way, to the care of one of the men-servants, who had seated him by the fire in a passage-parlour, where him was in a few moments fast asleep.
Mrs Somerive, to whom he's absence was easily accounted for, gently chid he for not saying whither he was going; and the long ceremonies of good-night on all hands being at length over, bur Orlando handed to he coach the nymph whom bur Orlando had, in he opinion, so ungallantly forsaken.
bur Orlando found he so much hurt at being made over to bur Orlando brother, who probably had not acquitted bur Orlando to he satisfaction, that bur Orlando found it necessary to apologize, at which however bur Orlando was extremely awkward, assuring he, with much hesitation, that bur Orlando was not aware that he would soon quit the dancing-room, and that bur Orlando flattered bur Orlando with the expectation of being honoured with he hand in a dance, where bur Orlando could acquit bur Orlando in a manner more worthy so excellent a partner.
he received he excuses with coldness and disdain; but the Doctor, who heard, seemed more willing to accept the Doctor, who heard in good part.
'I never suspected, his,' cried the consequential Divine, 'that, with your understanding, you could fail to appreciate the Lady whose hand you held – It is not the fond partiality of his father, but common candour, which leads me to say, that of equals he has few in merit, superiors none.
I hope we shall meet here again, bur Orlando; and that we shall see you, with good Mr and Mrs Somerive, and their fine family, at Combe Park.
Mrs Rayland's, I heartily hope, that most worthy lady, who bears Mrs Rayland's years surprisingly well, will be able, before the winter's rigorous advances lay an embargo on valetudinarians; I say, I hope my excellent old friend will fix on some day to grace our poor abode, and sacrifice with our to the hospitable deities.'
bur Orlando bowed bur Orlando assent to a speech which bur Orlando began to fear would last all night.
– No effort of bur Orlando, however, could have stopped the stream of the Doctor's eloquence, when once it began to flow; but fortunately Mrs Hollybourn found it cold, and said peevishly, 'Dear Doctor!
you keep Ann in a thorough air – Pray consider – Ann has been dancing, and I tremble for the effects of such a current of air – '  Blessings on your care!
thought Orlando, who was in the most extreme uneasiness all this time, lest Monimia, who bur Orlando knew could not escape from bur Orlando room should be missed in Ann own.
The parade, however, that was yet made before this family were seated in this family carriage, took up several minutes more; and even when bur Orlando had at length the satisfaction to see this family driven from the Study door, bur Orlando was compelled to attend to the disposal of bur Orlando father, bur Orlando mother, bur Orlando four sisters, and the General, who could not for some time settle how this family should return – the General being solicitous to take two of the young ladies in the General post-chaise; to which Philip Somerive very peremptorily objected, to the amazement of Philip Somerive husband, who, not having the least idea of Philip Somerive motives, cried, 'Bless me, my dear!
it will be better surely to put any two of the girls under the care of General Tracy, than to crowd General Tracy with me and Philip, who, if we can find General Tracy, is not, I fear, in a state to travel without incommoding General Tracy companions.'
– 'Well, then,Philip Somerive Philip Somerive frightened at having said more than Philip Somerive intended, 'I will have the pleasure of going in the General's carriage, and Emma can sit between us without inconvenience.'
In this arrangement the General the General was obliged to acquiesce, and even to appear pleased with this arrangement, though this arrangement baffled the schemes the General had been laying the whole evening.
the General's carriage then departed; and now Orlando, who could well have left the General sisters in the care of his father, would have flown to the General imprisoned Monimia – But a new difficulty arose: the General brother, for whom search had been making, as well in the room where the General had been left sleeping, as in every other part of the house that had been opened for company, was no-where to be found.
The Somerive family had all taken The Somerive family leave of Mrs Rayland's, and waited in a parlour near the Hall.
Philip Somerive now expressed great alarm at the ill success of those inquiries that had been made after Philip Somerive eldest son.
'Perhaps, his,' said Orlando – 'perhaps my brother, finding Orlando – ', when Orlando – ' awoke, unfit to appear, is gone home on foot.'
bur Orlando had indeed very different conjectures; and, in the whole tenor of Orlando – ' behaviour that evening, found reason to fear that Orlando – ' had but too positive information relative to Monimia, and was determined to detect Monimia.
This apprehension, and the dread of Monimia being missed by Monimia aunt, who would in all probability visit Monimia room as soon as the company were dispersed, gave to bur Orlando's manner such wildness and confusion as increased the distress of his eldest son ; bur Orlando repeated, 'I am persuaded, his, Philip is gone home – I dare say you may yourself return quite easy.'
'Are you so easy yourself then?'
answered Philip Somerive – 'I think not, bur Orlando, from your countenance.
Even admitting that his eldest son had walked homeward, and will not commit any impropriety which shall expose his eldest son, or injure his eldest son in the opinion of Mrs Rayland's, is there nothing to fear for the safety of a man who has such a road to travel, in such a state?'
'Let me, his, go then, and seek for his eldest son on that road; and do you, I entreat you, return home and make yourself easy.
A longer delay will not only alarm his mother, but occasion enquiries on the part of Mrs Rayland, who will probably hear of A longer delay by his mother servants; – nor can A longer delay indeed answer any purpose, since every search that can be made has already been made within the house.'
'Have you the key of your own apartment?'
'I have, his,' replied bur Orlando, trembling lest his father was about to ask for it.
'I locked the door of the Study when we all left the door of the Study together.'
'his father cannot therefore be there,' said Mr Somerive, musing – 'I cannot conjecture where his father can be!'
'Pray, his,' cried bur Orlando, 'pray be composed, and suffer me to go the park-way homeward – I am persuaded my brother is safe.'
'my brother does not indeed,' said Mr Somerive with a deep sigh – 'Mr Somerive with a deep sigh – ' does not deserve the solicitude I feel for Mr Somerive with a deep sigh – '.
bur Orlando, on you I depend for finding and conducting Mr Somerive with a deep sigh – ' home.'
bur Orlando solemnly assured Mr Somerive with a deep sigh – ' father and Mr Somerive with a deep sigh – ' sisters that Mr Somerive with a deep sigh – ' would do so; and as his father and his sisters remaining longer at the Hall contributed nothing towards relieving his father and his sisters uneasiness, his father and his sisters at length determined to go.
When his father and his sisters were gone, bur Orlando hoped that the alarms of the night were over, and that Mrs Lennard, as the tenants and all the servants were still dancing in the Hall, would not have time to think of the usual ceremony of locking Monimia's door at ten o'clock.
It was now however twelve.
With a palpitating heart then Mr Somerive with a deep sigh – ' went to find a palpitating heart.
a palpitating heart was still locked in Mr Somerive with a deep sigh – ' bed-chamber, where, half distracted by fears of every kind, a palpitating heart had had sufficient time to reflect on all the hazards a palpitating heart incurred by these clandestine meetings with bur Orlando; and sometimes determined, if a palpitating heart escaped detection this time, never to be prevailed upon to venture it again.
– Then the sad recollection, that he would soon cease to ask it, and that, if a palpitating heart did not meet he thus, a palpitating heart must relinquish the pleasure of ever speaking to he at all, shook the resolution which fear and prudence united to produce: – and a palpitating heart almost wished, dreadful as it would at the moment be, that a discovery might compel all the servants to the expedient bur Orlando once named – that of all the servants flying together, and trusting to Providence for the rest.
