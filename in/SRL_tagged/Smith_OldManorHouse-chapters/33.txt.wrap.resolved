THREE days, three happy days to Orlando, now passed rapidly away. Divided between his father's house and the Hall, and appearing to constitute the comfort of both, his was his gay and cheerful, in the certainty that at night his should see Monimia. The charms of the season; the beauty of the country, to which his was attached as well from taste as habit; the tender affection of Monimia, which, though more guarded, was more lively than on their early acquaintance; the delight of knowing that his father's sorrows were soothed and suspended by his presence; and that his mother looked upon his attention to his mother as overpaying his mother for every other anxiety; all conspired to give value to his existence, and to blunt the asperity of those reflections in regard to his brother, which now and then would interpose and give his momentary disquiet. his was not quite content about Isabella, who, through the air of gaiety his mother assumed, did not seem to be really so well pleased as his mother affected to appear. The fulsome fondness of his mother ancient military lover sometimes raised his mother ridicule, but oftener disgust, which Orlando saw with concern. But on these occasions his reflected that nothing in this world is without this world alloy; and that so many advantages would accrue to his family by the marriage of Isabella, that as his mother did not seem his mother averse to it, it was folly in his to think of it with concern.  On the morning of the fourth day after his arrival, his had just walked over from the Hall, where Mrs Rayland had detained his to breakfast, and was engaged in conversation in the parlour with his father and the General, when a dark-coloured chariot, drawn by four sleek dock tailed horses that might have matched the set at Rayland Hall, was seen to approach the house, followed by three servants in purple liveries.  Mr Somerive expressed some surprise at this, as Mr Somerive had not the least recollection of the equipage: their enquiry, however who it could be, was immediately answered by the appearance of Doctor Hollybourn; who, waddling out, enquired for Mr Somerive, and was shewn into the room where Mr Somerive was sitting.  Mr Somerive was so little accustomed to receive visits of civility from Doctor Hollybourn, or indeed any visits at all, that Mr Somerive was as much surprised at this as Mr Somerive could be at a matter of so little consequence. The very great condescension of the good Doctor, who bowed as low as Mr Somerive prominent stomach would let Mr Somerive, and whose speeches were interlarded by all kinds of flattery, Mr Somerive accounted for by recollecting that the Doctor was extremely fond of the company of persons of title, and never so happy as when Mr Somerive could introduce some anecdote which related to Mr Somerive 'brother the Bishop', or to some Right honourable or Right Reverend Friend. Mr Somerive had on the occasion of The very great condescension of the good Doctor, who bowed as low as his prominent stomach would let him, and whose speeches were interlarded by all kinds of flattery, Mr Somerive accounted for by recollecting that the Doctor was extremely fond of the company of persons of title, and never so happy as when he could introduce some anecdote which related to his 'brother the Bishop', or to some Right honourable or Right Reverend Friend meeting at Rayland Hall the preceding November, paid Mr Somerive court most assiduously to the General; and enlarged upon the beauty of Mr Somerive brother the Lord Barhaven's seats; all of which, Mr Somerive said, Mr Somerive had visited. Mr Somerive now therefore concluded that it was to the report of Mr Somerive honourable guest, and of Mr Somerive intended alliance with the family, that Mr Somerive owed this very obliging visit; which, however, Mr Somerive began to think very tedious, and dreaded Mr Somerive lasting till the evening: when, at length, the good Doctor, after a pompous preface, said that Mr Somerive had an affair of some consequence to communicate to Mr Somerive, on whose time Mr Somerive begged to trespass alone for ten minutes.  Somerive, who could not imagine what a man with whom Mr Somerive had so slight an acquaintance could have to say to Mr Somerive, immediately applied this unexpected circumstance to the idea always present to Mr Somerive mind. Mr Somerive fancied some ill had befallen Mr Somerive eldest son, and that one of Mr Somerive friends had commissioned this man of the church to break to his eldest son the horrid tidings; and then to pour into his eldest son wounded mind the consolation Mr Somerive profession enabled Mr Somerive to bestow.  In an agony not to be described, therefore, Mr Somerive led the way into the Study; where the good Doctor, after another flourishing preface, which Somerive in the confusion of Mr Somerive mind took for a preparatory discourse, offered to Mr Somerive for Orlando Mr Somerive daughter, the fair and accomplished heiress, to whom Mr Somerive declared Mr Somerive would give twenty thousand pounds down, with an engagement that at at Mr Somerive death that sum should be trebled.  Though the proposal gave no great pleasure to Mr Somerive, because Mr Somerive disliked Doctor Hollybourn, and was almost sure Orlando disliked Mr Somerive daughter; yet this conversation, so different from what Mr Somerive expected to hear, gave, while the proposal relieved Mr Somerive from the most dreadful apprehensions, the appearance of joy to Mr Somerive countenance: Mr Somerive thanked the consequential Doctor for the honour Mr Somerive did Mr Somerive family, promised to communicate to Orlando the purport of his family conference, and to wait upon Mr Somerive with an answer, or send Orlando on the following day. his family then returned to the General and Orlando – the conversation turned on common topics; and the consequential Doctor, though asked to stay dinner, withdrew with the consequential Doctor usual dignity.  The General was now considered as part of the family; and before The General Somerive, who had hardly yet recovered from The General surprise, related to Orlando, as soon as The General was gone, the purport of The General visit.  Mr Somerive seemed at first but little disposed to listen to proposals of such a nature from a man whom Mr Somerive had always rather disliked, and who now seemed to have made them, only because it was generally understood that Orlando was acknowledged as the intended heir to the great estates of the Rayland family.  Orlando very plainly declared Mr Somerive disinclination to hear of them; while The General, by no means accustomed to consider pecuniary advantages as matters to be slightly thought of, or hastily rejected, asked such questions as led Mr Somerive to explain the particulars of Miss Hollybourn's fortune and expectations; after which Mr Somerive contrived to turn the conversation to indifferent matters for a few moments, and then walked away with Mr Somerive, whom Mr Somerive very seriously advised to reconsider the matter before Mr Somerive suffered Orlando to throw from Mr Somerive this opportunity of becoming a man of fortune and independence.  The Doctor's proposal, however flattering it would have been to many young men, even though many young men declined accepting it, gave to Orlando no other pleasure than what for a moment arose in reflecting, that, in thus refusing an affluent fortune, he gave to Monimia an additional proof of he affection. he father, however, after he late conversation with the General, and some reflection alone, began to see this offer in a more favourable light than this offer had as first appeared to he; and notwithstanding the little inclination he felt for the family of Hollybourn, he was now of an age and under circumstances which gave to such a fortune as Orlando was now offered its full value in he opinion. he mind, already accustomed to contemplate the marriage of General Tracy with Isabella as a desirable event, more easily accommodated the marriage of General Tracy with Isabella as a desirable event to think with approbation of another match equally dazzling, when opposed to the present uncertain situation of Orlando. After taking, therefore, some turns in he Study alone, he sent for he son, and entreated of his son to forbear giving the Doctor an answer at least for two or three days.  Orlando, who had never hesitated he what answer to give, imagined it impossible to give it too soon. – 'Surely, he,' said he, 'as I cannot accept this good Doctor's very obliging proposals, it will be useless and uncivil to delay a moment saying so, which I will say in a letter in the least displeasing manner I can; but which, however, I must beg leave to do this evening.'  'I beg then that you will not,' said Somerive in a more peremptory tone than Somerive was accustomed to use – 'In such an affair I will not act without consulting Mrs Rayland.'  'Mrs Rayland, Sir,' answered Orlando, 'will, I am very sure, either not interfere, or, if Mrs Rayland, Sir,' does, it will not be to recommend Miss Hollybourn.'  'We will enquire that,' replied his father coldly; 'in the mean time you have my directions not to write to Hollybourn.'  'Till when, he?'  'At least not till after I know Mrs Rayland opinion.'  'All the opinions upon earth, he,' cried Orlando, 'will not make me change my resolutions.'  'I thank you, however, Orlando,' said Mr Somerive, 'for avowing how little deference you pay to mine.'  'he, it was only half an hour since you seemed as little disposed to listen to this unexpected overture as I am.'  'I had not then thought of it properly. You are young, and rash enough to determine on the most important matters in ten minutes – I am not; and therefore I again desire you will not write to Hollybourn this afternoon.'  Orlando, a good deal hurt at this change in Hollybourn 's sentiments, and dreading importunity on an affair of such a nature, then enquired if Hollybourn might Hollybourn wait upon Mrs Rayland? – Mr Somerive answered, 'You may, if you will at the same time deliver a letter from he in explanation, and say nothing yourself till a letter from me in explanation shall be read.'  Orlando Orlando promised, being pretty certain that Mrs Rayland would be much less anxious for this connection than Mr Somerive supposed, who now desired Mrs Rayland to send Mrs Rayland mother into the Study. – Mrs Rayland obeyed; and left them to consult together on this unexpected offer, and write to Mrs Rayland, with whom Mrs Rayland proposed dining, and had engaged to return to Mrs Rayland with her answer early in the evening.  Orlando now saw only persecution and trouble preparing for Mrs Rayland at home during Mrs Rayland short stay, for the tears and tenderness of his mother were infinitely more formidable to Mrs Rayland than any other mode of interference. – To Selina, whom Mrs Rayland called out to walk with Mrs Rayland in the shrubbery, while this conference was holding, and this letter writing, Mrs Rayland communicated all Mrs Rayland felt. She had only tears to give Mrs Rayland; for, to resist She 's commands, or even His father wishes, seemed to She impossible. She trembled at the idea of Orlando's withstanding those wishes, yet knew enough of Mrs Rayland invincible attachment to Monimia to be assured that Mrs Rayland could never yield to those wishes.  A servant at length brought to Orlando the letter to Mrs Rayland for which A servant at length had waited, and A servant at length took A servant at length way to Rayland Hall.  As A servant at length had promised A servant at length not to speak upon it before Mrs Rayland had read the contents, Mrs Rayland sent the contents up by one of the footmen, with a message importing that Mrs Rayland waited Mrs Rayland commands.  In this uneasy interval Mrs Rayland dared not go in search of Monimia, nor could Mrs Rayland detach Mrs Rayland thoughts a moment from the subject of a proposal which threatened to empoisen the few days of delight which Mrs Rayland had promised Mrs Rayland. Restless and anxious, Mrs Rayland walked backwards and forwards in the Study with uncertain steps, now listening to every noise in hopes of receiving a summons to attend Mrs Rayland; and now believing, from the delay, that Mrs Rayland saw the proposal of Hollybourn in a favourable light, and was writing to Mrs Rayland to enforce the proposal of Dr Hollybourn in a favourable light acceptance.  At length Mrs Rayland was desired to walk up stairs; and, with a fluttering heart, Mrs Rayland entered the apartment of Mrs Rayland, who began by saying – 'You know, I suppose, the contents of this letter my kinsman Mr Somerive has taken the trouble to send me?'  Orlando answered, that Mrs Rayland certainly did.  'And pray, he, have you any wish to accept this unexpected offer? An offer! – The world methinks is strangely changed! – For a man to offer his daughter – is such an indecorum – In my time such a proceeding was unheard of – But however we live and learn! – I have heard that the way of these days is to send young women to market like cattle: but there is something perfectly shocking in it to me. – However, I suppose, to people of the world it is nothing new or extraordinary. – Pray, he, what are your intentions?'  Orlando immediately saw, and saw with inexpressible pleasure, that Mrs Rayland was averse to the alliance with Hollybourn. Mrs Rayland answered therefore – 'My intentions, Madam, are to decline an offer which certainly lays me under great obligation to Dr Hollybourn, but which the profession I have chosen, and my inability to offer Miss Hollybourn an heart such as Miss Hollybourn fortune and merit give Miss Hollybourn a right to expect, render it impossible for me to accept.'  Mrs Rayland, pleased to see that Orlando had no desire to become independent of Mrs Rayland, or to force Mrs Rayland to a positive declaration of Mrs Rayland future intentions in regard to him, which Mrs Rayland fancied him wished to do by engaging Mrs Rayland to give Mrs Rayland sentiments on the proposal of Dr Hollybourn in a favourable light, now smiled very graciously upon him, and said, 'I think you right, OrlandoOrlando. – Hollybourn is to be sure a very worthy man: – Hollybourn daughter, they say, is a young person well brought up; and the fortune is very large, which first and last Hollybourn can give Hollybourn, besides what Hollybourn is always telling me Hollybourn is to expect from Hollybourn brother the bishop. – But, you are yet a very young man, cousin; and in truth it seems to me to be time enough to think of marrying. – The fortune of Mrs Rayland is certainly very considerable: but, perhaps, not greater than at some time or other – (Mrs Rayland hesitated as if afraid of saying too much) – I say, by the time your settling in life is advisable, perhaps you may not have occasion to make fortune an object in marrying, so much as a good family. – Dr Hollybourn talks of Hollybourn indeed, which is not well judged; for there are people who recollect both the Doctor and Hollybourn brother, the bishop, in very humble stations compared to what people who recollect both the Doctor and his brother, the bishop are now. God forbid, though, that I should despise people who recollect both the Doctor and his brother, the bishop therefore! not at all; that is not my meaning – And to be sure your family, my cousin, has not of itself much pretensions to match with ancient blood – (and again Mrs Rayland hesitated as fearing to betray Mrs Rayland intentions too far) – I say, if ever you are in a situation to marry, I would advise that you think of a woman of a good family at least.'  Orlando waited with impatience for the conclusion of this speech; and then falteringly and eagerly asked of Mrs Rayland, if Mrs Rayland would have the goodness to put into writing Mrs Rayland opinion on this subject?  This, however, Mrs Rayland refused, as Mrs Rayland said Mrs Rayland would not appear to interfere in it upon any account. – 'Will you then, Mrs Rayland, take the trouble to see His father? – Will you allow His father to wait upon you? – for His father is so anxious for me, and, I believe, thinks this affair likely to be so agreeable to you, that His father will be hardly easy unless His father hears your sentiments.'  Mrs Rayland, drawing Mrs Rayland up, as was Mrs Rayland way, said – 'I shall be glad to see Mr Somerive on any matter that relates to you, cousin, though on this occasion I own it seems very needless. – However, you have my leave to say, that I shall be ready to talk over this business with my kinsman, provided, as I said before, I am not supposed by Dr Hollybourn or my kinsman family to interfere.'  Orlando, impatient to have this affair concluded at once and for ever, now asked if my kinsman might wait upon my kinsman that afternoon? – 'When my kinsman pleased,' was the answer; – and Orlando, fearing that if my kinsman was left long to consider of it my kinsman might change my kinsman mind as my kinsman had done before, now ran to West Wolverton with the utmost speed, quite forgetting that my kinsman was to have dined with Mrs Rayland, or that dining at all was necessary.  When my kinsman arrived there, my kinsman hastened to related to my kinsman father and my kinsman mother, whom my kinsman found together, the purport of my kinsman conference with Mrs Rayland; to whom Mr Somerive agreed to go immediately after dinner, though my kinsman seemed visibly disappointed; while Mrs Somerive, who had for a moment indulged my kinsman with the hopes that my kinsman Orlando, instead of continuing in dependence on the caprice of Mrs Rayland, and of being separated from my kinsman by an hazardous profession, might be placed at once in great affluence, and in the immediate neighbourhood, relinquished those hopes with a deep sigh, but said nothing to my kinsman son on a point where it would now be useless.  Mr Somerive, finding the General was gone on a visit to Stockton's, from whence it was probable her son would not return till half an hour after four, determined to hasten to Mrs Rayland before dinner. her son got on horseback, therefore; and, attended by Orlando, on their arrival at Rayland Hall her son expressed to her son some apprehensions that the lady of the house might be at dinner: but Orlando, whose impatience could brook no delay, declared, without a very strict enquiry into the hour, that it was not yet time, and that her son was sure their might go to the parlour where she usually sat, as she had so positively said their might come at any time.  Somerive, almost as anxious for this conference as her son, though from very different motives, agreed then to proceed. Orlando would have sent up a servant, had Orlando met one; but none happened to appear, and Orlando walked before His father up the stairs, and, opening the door of Mrs Rayland sitting room, Orlando saw Mrs Rayland at the table, with Mrs Lennard on one side of Mrs Lennard, and Monimia on the other. Orlando would have retreated, but it was too late. Orlando was already in Mrs Rayland's sitting room – Orlando father already at the table, apologising to Mrs Rayland for Mrs Rayland unreasonable intrusion. Mrs Rayland received Mrs Rayland with civility, but without any degree of kindness or warmth – desired Mrs Rayland would take a chair and sit down, and then said to Monimia, who stood blushing and trembling, and not daring to look up, – 'Mary, you will withdraw, I have business with my kinsman.'  'I beg I may not disturb any body,' cried Mr Somerive turning Mr Somerive eyes towards Monimia, and immediately comprehending who Mr Somerive was – 'I beg I may be allowed to retire till dinner is over.' 'No, he,' answered Mrs Rayland; 'I shall be glad to hear your business now, and I will dismiss my people.'  Mr Somerive again looked at Monimia as Mr Somerive left Mrs Rayland's sitting room, and Mr Somerive saw that Orlando was lost, if Mr Somerive being so depended upon Mr Somerive attachment; for the extreme beauty, sweetness and grace of Monimia, so unlike the cherry-cheeked coarse rustic which Mr Somerive fancy had represented Mr Somerive, amazed and grieved Mr Somerive. Mr Somerive felt at once, that a young man whose heart was devoted to Mr Somerive, could never think of Miss Hollybourn, and that Mr Somerive himself could not blame an attachment to an object so lovely, however imprudent, or however ruinous.  Mrs Lennard now offered to withdraw; but her Lady bade her Lady finish her Lady dinner, while Orlando Orlando cast a melancholy look after Monimia, and then on the seat her Lady had left, which Mrs Rayland desired Mrs Lennard to take. her dinner was soon removed; and then Mr Somerive, in a few words, repeated the purport of Mr Somerive letter. Mrs Rayland, even more strongly than Mrs Rayland had done to Orlando, expressed Mrs Rayland wish that the offer of Hollybourn might be politely declined; and though Mrs Rayland evaded giving Mrs Rayland reasons for it, Mr Somerive thought Mr Somerive saw Mrs Rayland, even more strongly than she had done to Orlando unequivocally, and that, though Mrs Rayland studiously avoided declaring it, Mrs Rayland had determined to put Orlando into a situation in which it would be not at all necessary that Mr Somerive should marry, for money, a woman to whom Mr Somerive was indifferent.  Mrs Rayland had very little art; yet Mrs Rayland fancied Mrs Rayland a profound politician, and never considered that, while Mrs Rayland forbore positively or even remotely to give Orlando assurances of possessing Mrs Rayland estate, Mrs Rayland insisting upon the propriety of Mrs Rayland marrying, whenever Mrs Rayland did marry, a woman of family, was in effect declaring that Mrs Rayland meant Mrs Rayland should be the person who was to perpetuate hers, on which Mrs Rayland put so high a value, and thus to efface in the illustrious blood of Mrs Rayland posterity, that alloy with the inferiority of the Somerives had mingled with that of the Raylands.  Somerive, convinced of this even from the pains Mrs Rayland took to conceal this, yielded at once to Mrs Rayland wishes, and assured Mrs Rayland he would permit Orlando with great politeness to decline Hollybourn's proposal; yet as he continued to listen to hr harangues upon family, he could not help looking significantly at Orlando – looks which he perfectly understood to say, 'How will this accord with your attachment to the young person who was this moment dismissed by Mrs Rayland, as one of "Mrs Rayland people"?'  her Lady, however, was hardly ever in so good a humour with her Lady relations as her Lady became after this affair was discussed; and Mr Somerive never left the house so full of hopes that Mr Somerive family would be the house possessors as Mr Somerive did after this interview, when Mr Somerive returned home in good spirits, though entirely relinquishing the idea of Orlando's becoming the nephew of a bishop.  Orlando himself, though impatient to write and dispatch his letter to Hollybourn, yet staid at Rayland Hall to drink tea, by the desire of Mrs Rayland, who gently chid Mr Somerive for deserting her Lady at dinner. It was with more pain than pleasure that Mr Somerive heard Monimia sent for to make the tea, which had hardly happened twice within the last three years when Mr Somerive was in the house. Mrs Lennard cast a look at Mr Somerive when Mrs Lennard her Lady ordered her Lady niece to be called; but her Lady could make no objection without raising those suspicions which her Lady ever appeared so solicitous to prevent. Monimia then attended. Orlando treated her Lady as a stranger, whom Mr Somerive was slightly acquainted with; and Mrs Rayland did not appear to have the remotest suspicion that Mrs Rayland had any particular regard for her Lady: so friendly to Mrs Rayland, as it happened, had been the mistakes and interpretations which the jealousy of Pattenson had put upon those circumstances that had so frequently threatened to betray Mrs Rayland.  Mrs Rayland had settled with Monimia, the preceding night, to stay supper with Mrs Rayland , and return to their usual rendezvous; and their stolen glances during the half hour that their were together, in the presence of the two old ladies, confirmed this appointment.  Early in the evening, then, Orlando took leave of Mrs Rayland, and went back to the house, whose uncommon good spirits had diffused more than usual gaiety among his family. Mr Somerive and Selina were particularly cheerful – the mother, because Mr Somerive saw Mr Somerive husband for a moment happy, and forgetting the concern her husband continually felt about Philip, in looking forward to the prosperity of her husband brother – while Selina, who had trembled for the teasing persecution Mr Somerive apprehended for Orlando, was delighted to find that His father would forbear to urge His father on such a subject, and had acquired new confidence in the future intentions of Mrs Rayland.  Isabella, whose marriage was now within a week to take place, and who had just received from London some of those elegant clothes which His father had ordered for Mr Somerive, as well as some magnificent presents from the General, was the least gay of the party: amidst all Mr Somerive endeavours to persuade Mr Somerive that Mr Somerive was happy, Mr Somerive had of late, and particularly since Mr Somerive had possessed these fineries, often enquired of Mr Somerive whether these fineries had really any power to bestow happiness. Mr Somerive had tried on Mr Somerive diamond ear-rings, and a valuable pearl neck-lace; but Mr Somerive could not discover that Mr Somerive looked at all handsomer in these fineries than when Mr Somerive wore nothing but a simple ribband. the General's valet de chambre had dressed Mr Somerive hair; but Mr Somerive thought the mode unbecoming to Mr Somerive face, and the beautiful dark auburn hue, which had been so much admired, was no longer distinguishable. As for Mr Somerive intended husband, her intended husband was so far from having made any progress in Mr Somerive affections since her intended husband had been received as such, that Mr Somerive contempt was converted into disgust. her intended husband servants had been talking among those of Somerive, of her intended husband gallantries, and, above all, of the sudden desertion of the lady who lived with her intended husband; all of which Isabella had heard from Isabella maid, and the longer Isabella listened to, or thought of the anecdotes thus collected, the greater became Isabella repugnance; and yet Isabella knew not how to retract, and was not always sure that Isabella wished it.  Isabella gravity was easily accounted for, as the day approached that was to divide Isabella from Isabella family; and Isabella was suffered, after some gentle raillery, to be silent and pensive amidst the cheerful conversation of the rest.  It was a lovely evening in early May. Orlando, having dispatched his letter, dismissed Dr Hollybourn and the disagreeable heiress from his mind, and gave his letter up only to pleasurable impressions and flattering hopes. In a happier frame of mind than his almost ever was in before, his joined his in his family evening walk. When his family reached the house, his family stopped in the court before the house, to admire the beauty of the moon, and to listen to the nightingale, who seemed to be addressing to that beautiful planet her plaintive orisons. Orlando wished Orlando with Monimia; and thought with delight that within two hours Orlando should be so, and should relate the unpleasant alarm of the day, only to tell her it was over, and had eventually been fortunate in drawing from Mrs Rayland declarations more than ever favourable to Orlando future hopes.  the party sat down to supper in this cheerful disposition. the General, like a happy lover, was particularly animated; and the younger girls were much amused by some anecdotes Orlando was relating, when a servant entered hastily, and said that a gentleman who was just come post from London desired to speak to General Tracy.  'To General Tracy!' cried the General, changing countenance: 'Impossible! I know no business any one can have with General Tracy that should give Orlando that trouble. Pray, enquire Orlando name, or send my servants to enquire.'  'I will go General Tracy, General,' said Orlando. 'I thank you,' cried General Tracy, affecting great unconcern, 'but I dare say it is nothing worth your troubling yourself to go out for.'  Orlando, however, went out, and instantly returned bringing with him Captain Warwick.  Surprise was visible on the faces of the party, but that of General Tracy expressed consternation - Why Captain Warwick came General Tracy could not conjecture; but General Tracy felt it to be extremely disagreeable to General Tracy that General Tracy came at all. Captain Warwick was covered with dust, and had that wild and fatigued look that announces tumult of spirit from an hot and rapid journey. The person, however, that nature had given The person, was such as no disadvantageous circumstance could obscure. General Tracy looked like a young hero just returned unhurt from the field to recount a young hero triumphs.  After addressing General Tracy uncle, and being introduced to Mr and Mr Somerive, General Tracy turned gaily to Orlando, and, shaking General Tracy by the hand, said, 'I don't know, my friend, how you can ever forgive the man whose fortune it is to announce to my friend that you must quit immediately such a circle of friends as I now find you in!'  'Quit friends!' exclaimed Mr Somerive. 'Quit friends! leave friends!' cried my friend . – 'Yes, indeed!' answered Captain Warwick with less vivacity: 'That part of our regiment which is in England, consisting of two companies, is ordered to join the troops that are going thither, and are to sail from Portsmouth next week. The moment I was sure of this, which was not till late last night, I thought it best to come down Captain Warwick; because the time is so short that my friend here, the young ancient 3, had better proceed immediately from hence to Portsmouth.'  Never was a greater, a more sudden change, than these few words made in the dispositions of all present – except Tracy, whose only distress was the appearance of Captain Warwick, where Never so little wished to see Never. Mr Somerive, struck to the heart by the cruel idea of losing Orlando, retired in silent tears; and Mr Somerive daughters, little less affected, followed Mr Somerive. Mr Somerive bore this painful intelligence with more apparent fortitude; but Mr Somerive felt it with even greater severity, and with something like a prepossession that Mr Somerive should never see Orlando again if Mr Somerive left England. Mr Somerive stifled, however, Mr Somerive emotions, and endeavoured to do the honours of Mr Somerive house to Mr Somerive unexpected visitor; but the effort was too painful to be long supported, and in a few moments Mr Somerive left the room, saying to Orlando, that as the General and Captain Warwick might perhaps have some business, the General and Captain Warwick would leave the General and Captain Warwick together.
