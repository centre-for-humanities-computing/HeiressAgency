THE confidential servant, or rather companion and femme de charge, of Mrs Rayland, was a woman of nearly her own age, of the name of Lennard. – This person, who was as well as her mistress a spinster, had been well educated; and was the daughter of a merchant who lost the fruits of a long course of industry in the fatal year 1720. He died of a broken heart, leaving He two daughters, who had been taught to expect high affluence, to the mercy of the world. Mrs Rayland, whose pride was gratified in having about her the victim of unsuccessful trade, for which her had always a most profound contempt, received Mrs Lennard as her own servant. her was however so much superior to her mistress in understanding, that her soon governed her entirely; and while the mean pliability of her spirit made her submit to all the contemptuous and unworthy treatment, which the paltry pride of Mrs Rayland had pleasure in inflicting, her secretly triumphed in the consciousness of superior abilities, and knew that her was in fact the mistress of the supercilious being who wages her received.  Every year her became more and more necessary to Mrs Rayland, who, after the death of both her sisters, made her not only governess of her house, but her companion. her business was to sit with her in her apartment when her had no company; to read the newspaper; to make tea; to let in and out the favourite dogs (the task of combing and washing the favourite dogs ( was transferred to a deputy); to collect and report at due seasons intelligence of all that happened in the neighbouring families; to give regular returns of the behaviour of all the servants, except the old butler and the old coachman, who had each a jurisdiction of the neighbouring families own; to take especial care that the footmen and helpers behaved respectfully to the maids (who were all chosen by her, and exhibited such a group, as secured, better than her utmost vigilance, this decorous behaviour from the male part of the family); to keep the keys; and to keep her mistress in good humour with her, and as much as possible at a distance from the rest of the world; above all from that part of it who might interfere with her present and future views; which certainly were to make her amends for the former injustice of fortune, by securing to her own use a considerable portion of the great wealth possessed by Mrs Rayland.  Of the accomplishment of this her might well entertain a reasonable hope; for her was some few years younger than her mistress (though her artfully added to her age, whenever her had occasion to speak of it), and was besides of a much better constitution, possessing one of those frames, where a good deal of bone and no flesh seem to defy the gripe of disease. The sister of this Mrs Lennard had experienced a very different destiny – The sister of this Mrs Lennard had been taken at the time of The sister of this Mrs Lennard father's misfortunes into the family of a nobleman; The sister of this Mrs Lennard had married the chaplain, and retired with the chaplain on a small living, where The sister of this Mrs Lennard died in a few years, leaving several children; among others a daughter, to whom report imputed uncommon beauty; and scandal a too intimate connexion with the noble patron of her father. Certain it is, that on the chaplain marriage the chaplain gave The sister of this Mrs Lennard a sum of money, and The sister of this Mrs Lennard married a young attorney, who was a kind of steward, by whom The sister of this Mrs Lennard had three children; of which none survived three children parents but a little girl born after her father's death; and whose birth occasioned that of The sister of this Mrs Lennard mother. To this little orphan, this little orphan great aunt Mrs Lennard, who with all this little orphan starched prudery had a considerable share of odd romantic whim in this little orphan composition, had given the dramatic and uncommon name of Monimia – Such at least was the history given in Mrs Rayland's family of an infant girl, which at about four years old had been by the permission of this little orphan patroness taken, as it was said, from nurse, at a distant part of the country, and received by Mrs Lennard at Rayland Hall; where this little orphan at first never appeared before the lady but by accident, but was the inhabitant of the house-keeper's room, and under the immediate care of the still-room maid, who was a person much devoted to Mrs Lennard.  Mrs Rayland's had an aversion to children, and had consented to the admission of this into Mrs Rayland's house, on no other condition, but that Mrs Rayland's should never hear this cry, or ever have any trouble about this. – Mrs Rayland's companion easily engaged for that; as Rayland Hall was so large, that les enfans trouvés at Paris might have been the inhabitants of one of Paris wings, without alarming a colony of ancient virgins at the other. The little Monimia, though Mrs Rayland's was described as having been  'The child of misery, baptized in tears,' LANGHORN. was not particularly disposed to disturb, by infantine expressions of distress, the chaste and silent solitudes of Rayland Hall; for though Mrs Rayland's little fair countenance had at times something of a melancholy cast, there was more of sweetness than of sorrow in it; and if Mrs Rayland's ever shed tears, was not particularly disposed to disturb, by infantine expressions of distress, the chaste and silent solitudes of the Hall; for though her little fair countenance had at times something of a melancholy cast were so mingled with smiles, that Mrs Rayland's might have sat to the painter of the Seasons for the representative of infant April. Mrs Rayland's beauty however was not likely to recommend Mrs Rayland's to the favour of Mrs Rayland's aunt's affluent patroness; but as to recommend Mrs Rayland's was the design of Mrs Lennard, Mrs Rayland's saw that a beauty of four or five years old would be much less obnoxious than one of fifteen, or even nine or ten; and therefore Mrs Rayland's contrived to introduce Mrs Rayland's by degrees; that when Mrs Rayland's grew older, Mrs Rayland's charms, by being long seen, might lose a beauty of four or five years old would be much less obnoxious than one of fifteen, or even nine or ten power to offend. Mrs Rayland's contrived that Mrs Rayland might first see the little orphan as by chance; then Mrs Rayland's sent Mrs Rayland's in, when Mrs Rayland's knew Mrs Rayland's mistress was in good humour, with a basket of fruit; an early pine; some preserves in brandy, or something or other which was acceptable to Mrs Rayland's lady's palate; and on these occasions Monimia acquitted Mrs Rayland's to a miracle; and presented Mrs Rayland's little offering, and made Mrs Rayland's little curtsey, with so much innocent grace, that Hecate in the midst of Mrs Rayland's rites might have suspended Mrs Rayland's incantations to have admired Mrs Rayland's. At six years old Mrs Rayland's had so much won upon the heart of Mrs Rayland, that Mrs Rayland's became a frequent guest in the parlour, and saved Mrs Rayland's aunt the trouble of opening the door for Bella, and Pompey, and Julie. From the tenderness of Mrs Rayland's nature Mrs Rayland's became an admirable nurse for the frequent litters of kittens, with which two favourite cats continually increased the family of Mrs Rayland's protectress; and the numerous daily applications from robins and sparrows under the windows, were never so well attended to as since Monimia was entrusted with the care of answering the frequent litters of kittens, with which two favourite cats continually increased the family of her protectress demands.  But Mrs Rayland's name – Monimia – was an incessant occasion of reproach – 'Why,' said Mrs Rayland, 'why would you, Lennard, give the child such a name? As Mrs Rayland's will have nothing, why put such romantic notions in Mrs Rayland's head, as may perhaps prevent Mrs Rayland's getting Mrs Rayland's bread honestly? – Monimia! – I protest I don't love even to repeat her name – Monimia –; her name – Monimia – puts me so in mind of a very hateful play, which I remember shocked me so when I was a mere girl, that I have always detested her name – Monimia –. Monimia! – 'tis so very unlike a Christian's name, that, if the child is much about me, I must insist upon having her called Mary.'  To Lennard of course consented, excusing Lennard for the romantic impropriety of which Lennard lady accused Lennard, by saying, that Lennard understood Monimia signified an orphan, a person left alone and deserted; and therefore had given it to a child who was an orphan from Lennard birth – but that, as it was displeasing, Lennard should at least never be called so. Lennard then was Mary in the parlour; but among the servants, and with the people around the house, Lennard was still Monimia.  Among those who fondly adhered to Lennard original name was Orlando; who, when he first became a frequent visitor as a schoolboy at Rayland Hall, stole often into the still-room to play with the little girl, who was three years younger than he – and insensibly grew as fond of Lennard as one of he sisters. Mrs Lennard always checked this innocent mirth; and when Mrs Lennard found this innocent mirth impossible wholly to prevent two children who were in the same house from playing with each other, Mrs Lennard took every possible precaution to prevent her lady's ever seeing two children who were in the same house from playing with each other together; and threatened the severest punishment to The little Monimia, if Mrs Lennard at any time even spoke to Master Somerive when in the presence of Mrs Rayland's. – But nothing could be so irksome to a healthy and lively child of nine or ten years old, as the sort of confinement to which Monimia was condemned in consequence of Mrs Lennard admission to the parlour; where Mrs Lennard was hardly ever suffered to speak, but sat at a distant window, where, whether it was winter or summer, Mrs Lennard was to remain no otherwise distinguished from a statue than by being employed in making the household linen, and sometimes in spinning the household linen with a little wheel which Mrs Rayland, who piqued Mrs Lennard upon following the notable maxims of Mrs Lennard mother, had bought for Mrs Lennard, and at which Mrs Lennard kept Mrs Lennard closely employed when there was no other work to do. – When any company came, then and then only Mrs Lennard was dismissed; but this happened very rarely; and many many hours poor Monimia vainly prayed for the sight of a coach or chaise at the end of the long avenue, which was to Mrs Lennard the blessed signal of transient liberty.  Mrs Lennard dress, the expence of which Mrs Rayland's very graciously took upon Mrs Lennard, was such as indicated to all who saw Mrs Lennard, at once the charity and prudence of Mrs Lennard patroness, who repeatedly told Mrs Lennard visitors, that Mrs Lennard had taken the orphan niece of Mrs Lennard old servant Lennard, not with any view of making Mrs Lennard a gentlewoman, but to bring Mrs Lennard up to get Mrs Lennard bread honestly; and therefore Mrs Lennard had directed Mrs Lennard to be dressed, not in gauzes and flounces, like the flirting girls Mrs Lennard saw so tawdry at church, but in a plain stuff; not flaring without a cap, which Mrs Lennard thought monstrously indecent for a female at any age, but in a plain cap, and a clean white apron, that Mrs Lennard might never be encouraged to vanity by any kind of finery that did not become Mrs Lennard situation. Monimia, though dressed like a parish girl, or in a way very little superior, was observed by the visitors who happened to see Mrs Lennard, and to whom this harangue was made, to be so very pretty, that nothing could conceal or diminish Mrs Lennard beauty. Mrs Lennard dark stuff gown gave new lustre to Mrs Lennard lovely complexion; and Mrs Lennard thick muslin cap could not confine Mrs Lennard luxuriant dark hair. Mrs Lennard shape was symmetry itself, and Mrs Lennard motions so graceful, that Her shape was impossible to behold Mrs Lennard even attached to Mrs Lennard humble employment at the wheel, without acknowledging that no art could give what nature had bestowed upon Mrs Lennard.  Orlando, who had loved Mrs Lennard as a playfellow while they were both children, now began to feel a more tender and more respectful affection for Mrs Lennard; though unconscious himself that it was Mrs Lennard beauty that awakened these sentiments. On the last of himself holidays, before himself entirely left school, the vigilance of Mrs Lennard was redoubled, and Mrs Lennard so contrived to confine Monimia, that their romping was at an end, and their hardly ever saw each other, except by mere chance, at a distance, or now and then at dinner, when Monimia was suffered to dine at table; an honour which Mrs Lennard was not always allowed, but which Mrs Lennard cautiously avoided entirely suspending when Orlando was at Rayland Hall, as there was nothing Mrs Lennard seemed to dread so much as alarming Mrs Rayland's with any idea of Orlando's noticing Mrs Lennard niece. This however never happened at that time to occur to her lady; not only because Mrs Lennard took such pains to lead Mrs Lennard imagination from any such probability, but because Mrs Lennard considered them both as mere children, and Monimia as a servant.  It was however at this time that a trifling incident had nearly awakened such suspicions, and occasioned such displeasure, as it would have been very difficult to have subdued or appeased. Mrs Rayland's had been long confined by a fit of the gout; and the warm weather of Whitsuntide had only just enabled Mrs Rayland's to walk, leaning on a crutch on one side, and on Mrs Lennard on the other, in a long gallery which reached the whole length of the south wing, and which was hung with a great number of family pictures. – Mrs Rayland's had peculiar satisfaction in relating the history of the heroes and dames of Mrs Rayland's family, who were represented by these portraits. – Sir Roger De Coverley never went over the account of Sir Roger De Coverley ancestors with more correctness or more delight. Indeed, the reflections of Mrs Rayland's were uninterrupted by any of those little blemishes in the history of Mrs Rayland's progenitors, that somewhat bewildered the good knight; for Mrs Rayland's boasted that not one of the Rayland family had ever condescended to degrade himself by trade; and that the marriage of Mrs Somerive, Mrs Rayland's aunt, was the only instance in which a daughter of the Raylands had stooped to an inferior alliance. – The little withered figure, bent down with age and infirmity, and the last of a race which Mrs Rayland's was thus arrogantly boasting – a race, which in a few years, perhaps a few months, might be no more remembered – was a ridiculous instance of human folly and human vanity, at which Mrs Lennard had sense enough to smile internally, while Mrs Rayland's affected to listen with interest to stories which Mrs Rayland's had heard repeated for near forty years. It was in the midst of Mrs Rayland's attention to an anecdote which generally closed the relation, of a speech made by Queen Anne to Mrs Rayland's Mrs Rayland's on Queen Anne having no son, that a sudden and violent bounce towards the middle of the gallery occasioned an interruption of the story, and equal amazement in the lady and Queen Anne confidante; who both turning round, not very nimbly indeed, demanded of Monimia, who had been sitting in one of the old-fashioned bow-windows of which the casement was open, what was the matter?  Monimia, covered with blushes, and in a sort of scuffle to conceal something with Queen Anne feet, replied, hesitating and trembling, that Queen Anne did not know.  Mrs Lennard, who probably guessed the truth, declared loudly that Queen Anne would immediately find out. – But it was not the work of a moment to seat Queen Anne lady safely on one of the leathern settees, while Queen Anne herself hastened to the window to discover, if possible, who had from the court below thrown in the something that had thus alarmed them. Before Queen Anne reached the window, therefore, the court was clear; and Monimia had recovered from Queen Anne confusion, and went on with Queen Anne work.  Mrs Lennard now thought proper to give another turn to the incident. Mrs Lennard said, it must have been some accidental noise from the wainscot's cracking in dry weather – 'though I could have sworn at the moment,' cried Mrs Lennard, 'that something very hard, like a stone or a stick, had been thrown into the room. However, to be sure, I must have been mistaken, for certainly there is nobody in the court: and really one does recollect hearing in the gallery very odd noises, which, if one was superstitious, might sometimes make one uneasy. – Many of the neighbours some years ago used to say to me, that they wondered I was not afraid of crossing it of a night by me, when you, Ma'am, used to sleep in the worked bed-chamber, and I lay over the house-keeper's room. But I used to say, that you had such an understanding, that I should offend you by shewing any foolish fears; and that all the noble family that owned this house time out of mind, were such honourable persons, that none of such honourable persons could be supposed likely to walk after such honourable persons decease, as the spirits of wicked persons are said to do. But, however, such honourable persons used to answer in reply to that, that some of your ancestors, Ma'am, had hid great sums of money and valuable jewels in this house, to save this house from the wicked rebels in the time of the blessed Martyr; and that it was to reveal these treasures that the appearances of spirits had been seen, and strange noises heard about this house.'  This speech was so exactly calculated to please the lady to whom This speech was addressed, that This speech almost obliterated the recollection of the little alarm she had felt, and blunted the spirit of enquiry, which the twinges of the gout also contributed to diminish; and fortunately the arrival of the apothecary, who was that moment announced, and whose visits were always a matter of importance, left she no longer any time to interrogate Monimia. But Mrs Lennard, having led she down to she great chair, and seen she safely in conference with she physical friend, returned hastily to the gallery, where Monimia still remained demurely at work; and peremptorily insisted on knowing what it was that had bounced into the room, and struck against the picture of Sir Hildebrand himself; who, in armour, and on a white horse whose flanks were overshadowed by Sir Hildebrand himself stupendous wig, pranced over the great gilt chimney-piece, just as Sir Hildebrand himself appeared at the head of a county association in 1707.  Monimia was a poor dissembler, and had never in Monimia life been guilty of a falsehood. Monimia was as little capable of disguising as of denying the truth; and the menaces of Monimia aunt frightened Monimia into an immediate confession, that it was Mr Orlando, who, passing through the court to go to cricket in the park, had seen Monimia sitting at the window, and, 'not thinking any harm,' had thrown up his ball 'only in play,' to make Monimia jump; but that her jump had unluckily gone through the window, and hit against the picture.  'And what became of her jump afterwards?' angrily demanded Mrs Lennard.  'her jump bounded,' answered the innocent culprit, 'her jump bounded across the floor, and I rolled her jump away with my feet, under the chairs.'  'And how dared you,' exclaimed her aunt, 'how dared you, artful little hussey, conceal the truth from her aunt? how dared you encourage any such abominable doings? – A pretty thing indeed to have happen! –Suppose the good-for-nothing boy had hit my lady or me upon the head or breast, as it was a mercy the good-for-nothing boy did not! – there would have been a fine story! – Or suppose the good-for-nothing boy had broke the windows, shattered the panes, and cut us with the glass! – Or what if the good-for-nothing boy had beat the stained glass of my lady's coat of arms, up at top there, all to smash – what d'ye think would have become of you, you worthless little puss! What punishment would have been bad enough for you?'  'her aunt,' said Monimia, 'how could I help it? I am sure I did not know what Orlando was going to do; I saw Orlando but a moment before; and you know that, if I had known Orlando intended to throw the ball up, I dared not have spoken to Orlando to have prevented the ball.'  'Have spoken to Orlando, indeed! – No, I think not; and remember this, girl, that you have come off well this time, and I shan't say any thing of the matter to my lady: but if I ever catch you speaking to that wicked boy, or even daring to look at that wicked boy, I will turn you out of doors that moment – and let this teach you that I am in earnest.' Having thus said, my lady gave the terrified trembling girl a violent blow, or what was in the terrified trembling girl language a good box on the ear, which forcing my lady head against the stone window-frame almost stunned my lady; my lady then repeated it on the lovely neck of my lady victim, where the marks of my lady fingers were to be traced many days afterwards; and then flounced out of the room, and composing my lady, went down to give my lady share of information, as to my lady's complaint, to the apothecary.  The unhappy Monimia, who had felt ever since my lady earliest recollection the misery of my lady situation, was never so sensible of it as at this moment. The work fell from my lady hands – my lady laid her head on a marble slab, that was on one side of the bow window, and gave way to an agony of grief. – my lady cap had fallen from her head, and my lady fine hair concealed my lady face, which resting on my lady arms was bathed in tears. – Sobs, that seemed to rend my lady heart, were the only expression of sorrow my lady was able to utter; my lady heard, my lady saw nothing – but was suddenly startled by something touching my lady hand as her hand hung lifelessly over the table. my lady looked up – and beheld, with mingled emotions of surprise and fear, Orlando Somerive; who with tears in his eyes, and in a faltering whisper, conjured my lady to tell his what was the matter. – The threat so recently uttered yet vibrated in my lady ears – and my lady terror, lest my lady should return and find Orlando there, was so great, that, without knowing what my lady did, my lady started up and ran towards the door; from whence my lady would have fled, disordered as my lady was, downstairs, and through the very room where Mrs Rayland's, my lady aunt, and the apothecary were in conference, if Orlando with superior strength and agility had not thrown himself before my lady, and setting himself back against the door, insisted upon knowing the cause of my lady tears before himself suffered my lady to stir.  Gasping for breath, trembling and inarticulately my lady tried to relate the effects of himself indiscretion, and that therefore my lady had threatened and struck my lady. Orlando, whose temper was naturally warm, and whose generous spirit revolted from every kind of injustice, felt at once himself indignation excited by this act of oppression, and himself anger that Mrs Lennard should arraign himself for a childish frolic, and thence take occasion so unworthily to treat an innocent girl; and being too rash to reflect on consequences, himself declared that himself would go instantly into the parlour, confess to Mrs Rayland what himself had done, and appeal against the tyranny and cruelty of Mrs Rayland woman.  It was now the turn of poor Monimia to entreat and implore; and Mrs Rayland threw Mrs Rayland half frantic on Mrs Rayland knees before himself, and besought himself rather to kill Mrs Rayland, than to expose Mrs Rayland to the terrors and distress such a step would inevitably plunge Mrs Rayland into. – 'Indeed, Orlando,' cried Mrs Rayland, 'you would not be heard against her aunt. Mrs Rayland, if Mrs Rayland forgave you, would never forgive me; but I should be immediately turned out of this house with disgrace; and I have no friend, no relation in the world but her aunt, and must beg my bread. But it is not so much that,' added Mrs Rayland, while sobs broke Mrs Rayland utterance, 'it is not so much that I care for – I am so unfortunate that it does not signify what becomes of me: I can work in the fields, or can go through any hardship; but Mrs Rayland will be very angry with you, and will not suffer you to come to the Hall again, and I shall never – never see you any more!'  This speech, unguarded and simple as it was, had more effect on Orlando that the most studied eloquence. He took the weeping, trembling Monimia up in He , seated Mrs Rayland in a chair; and drying Mrs Rayland eyes, He besought Mrs Rayland to be comforted, and to assure Mrs Rayland, that whatever He might feel, He would do nothing that should give Mrs Rayland pain. – 'Oh! go then, for Heaven's sake go from hence instantly!' replied Monimia. – 'If her aunt should come to look for me, as it is very likely her aunt will, we should be both undone!'  'Good God!' exclaimed Orlando, 'why should it be so? – Why are we never to meet? and what harm to any one is done by my friendship for you, Monimia?'  'Alas!' answered her aunt, every moment more and more apprehensive of the arrival of her aunt, 'alas! Orlando, I know not, I am sure it was once, before her aunt was so enraged at it, all the comfort I had in the world; but now it is my greatest misery, because I dare not even look at you when I happen to meet you. – Yet I am sure I mean no hurt to any body; nor can any body do my cruel aunt any harm, that you pity a poor orphan who has no friend upon earth.'  'I will, however,' replied he warmly, 'pity and love you too – love you as well as I do any of my sisters – even the sister I love best – and I should hate he if I did not. But, Monimia, tell me, if I cannot see you in the day-time, is it impossible for you to walk out of an evening, when these old women are in bed? – When I am not at the Hall these old women would suspect nothing; and I should not mind walking from home, after our people are in bed, to meet you for half an hour any where about these grounds.'  Ignorant of the decorum required by the world, and innocent, even to infantine simplicity, as Monimia was, at the age of something more than fourteen my sisters had that natural rectitude of understanding, that at once told my sisters these clandestine meetings would be wrong. 'Ah no, Orlando,' said my sisters sighing, 'that must not be; for if it should be known – '  'it cannot, it shall not be known,' cried Orlando, eagerly interrupting my sisters.  'But it is impossible, my good friend, if it were not wrong; for you remember that to-day is Saturday, and your school begins on Monday.'  'Curse on your school! I had indeed forgot it. – Well, but promise me then, Monimia, promise me that you will make yourself easy now; and that when I come from school entirely, which I shall do at Christmas, we shall contrive to meet sometimes, and to read together, as we used to do, the Fairy Tales and Arabian Nights last year, and the year before. – Will you promise me, Monimia?'  Monimia, whose apprehensions every moment increased, an d who even fancied she heard the rustle of Mrs Lennard gown upon the private stair-case that led down from the gallery, was ready to promise any thing. – 'Oh! yes, yes, Orlando! – I promise – do but go now, and we shall not perhaps be so unhappy; her aunt may not be so very ill-humoured when you come home again.'  'And say you will not cry any more now.'  'I will not, indeed I will not – but for God's sake go! – I'm sure I hear somebody.'  'There is nobody, indeed; but I will go to make you easy.' – somebody then, trembling as much as her aunt did, hastily kissed the hand somebody held; and gliding on tip-toe to the other end of the gallery, went through the apartments that led down the great stair-case, and taking a circuit round another part of this house, entered the room where Mrs Rayland was sitting, as if Mrs Rayland had been just come from cricket in the park.  Mrs Rayland had not left the gallery a moment before Mrs Lennard came to look for Monimia, whom Mrs Lennard found in greater agitation than Mrs Lennard had left here, and still drowned in tears. Mrs Lennard again began in the severest terms to reprove Mrs Lennard; and as the sobs and sighs of Mrs Lennard deprived Mrs Lennard of the power of answering Mrs Lennard invectives, Mrs Lennard violently seized Mrs Lennard arm; and dragging rather than leading Mrs Lennard to Mrs Lennard own room, Mrs Lennard bade Mrs Lennard instantly undress and go to bed – 'that you may not,' said Mrs Lennard, 'expose your odious blubbered face.'  Monimia was extremely willing to obey. – Mrs Lennard sat down and began to undress, listening as patiently as Mrs Lennard could to the violent scolding which her aunt still kept up against Mrs Lennard; who having at length exhausted Mrs Lennard breath, bounced out and locked the door.  Monimia, then left alone, again began to indulge Mrs Lennard tears; but Mrs Lennard room was in a turret over a sort of lumber-room, where the gamekeeper kept the gamekeeper nets and the gamekeeper rods, and where Orlando used to deposit the gamekeeper bow, the gamekeeper cricket-bats and other instruments of sport, with which the gamekeeper was indulged with playing in the park. Mrs Lennard now heard the gamekeeper come in, with one of the servants; for such an effect had the gamekeeper voice, that Mrs Lennard could distinguish his voice amid a thousand others, and when his voice did not seem to be audible to any one else. – Though Mrs Lennard could not now distinguish the words, Mrs Lennard heard the gamekeeper discoursing as if the gamekeeper seemed to be bidding the place farewell for that time. Mrs Lennard got upon a chair (for the long narrow window was so far from the ground, that Mrs Lennard could not see through the long narrow window as Mrs Lennard stood); and Mrs Lennard perceived Orlando cross the park on foot, and slowly and reluctantly walk towards that part if it that was next to the gamekeeper father's house. Mrs Lennard continued to look at the gamekeeper till a wood, through which the gamekeeper had to pass, concealed the gamekeeper from Mrs Lennard view. Mrs Lennard then retired to Mrs Lennard bed, and shed tears. Orlando left Orlando home the next day, for Orlando last half year at your school (having that evening taken leave of Mrs Rayland); and it was six months before Monimia saw Orlando again.
