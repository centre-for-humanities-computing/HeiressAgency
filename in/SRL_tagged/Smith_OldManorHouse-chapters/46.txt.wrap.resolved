THE unfortunate brother of Orlando now related to THE unfortunate brother of Orlando, that though THE unfortunate brother of Orlando actual debts were very great, the sum THE unfortunate brother of Orlando was at present confined for was not much above ninety pounds; and THE unfortunate brother of Orlando arrest was at the suit of the very attorney whom THE unfortunate brother of Orlando had been persuaded by Stockton to employ – a young and inexperienced man; who having, without knowing what THE unfortunate brother of Orlando was about, led THE unfortunate brother of Orlando client into very heavy expences, had been, as it seemed, bribed by Roker to abandon THE unfortunate brother of Orlando; and now, without returning THE unfortunate brother of Orlando papers, had arrested THE unfortunate brother of Orlando. Orlando, inexperienced as THE unfortunate brother of Orlando still was in the miserable chicane with which our laws are disgraced and counteracted, yet knew that this could not be right, and that some means might be found to procure at least the papers such a man detained – This THE unfortunate brother of Orlando promised THE unfortunate brother of Orlando brother THE unfortunate brother of Orlando would do, and take every necessary measure for THE unfortunate brother of Orlando speedy release. THE unfortunate brother of Orlando then gave Philip all the money THE unfortunate brother of Orlando had in THE unfortunate brother of Orlando pocket; and, leaving Philip with an heavy heart, returned home, not only disappointed in Philip search after Monimia, but that disappointment embittered by the discovery Philip had made of Philip 's situation, whom, now that Philip was in distress and in prison, Orlando forgave for all the calamities Philip had brought on Philip family, and for all the ill offices which jealousy had excited Philip to be guilty of against Philip.  Yet, to Philip mother Philip dared not speak of Philip; for, though his mother at present suffered extreme anguish in believing his mother son had forsaken his mother, after having so largely contributed to the dispersion and ruin of his family, his mother would, Philip knew, be quite overwhelmed by the intelligence that Philip was in prison. his mother had already in bitterness of heart experienced –  'How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is To have a thankless child.' But still that half-broken heart had all the tenderness of a mother within still that half-broken heart for this his mother eldest child, on whom, during Philip early years, his mother fondest affections were fixed – and Orlando well knew that the misery Philip had thus brought upon Philip would add an incurable wound to those which his mother had already received.  But, though Philip endeavoured to conceal the extreme dejection of Philip spirits on Philip return, his mother immediately perceived that something had more than usual disturbed Philip. Philip told his mother, however, in answer to his mother anxious enquiries, that Philip had been embarrassed by the delays of office in regard to the sale of Philip commission; and as soon as Philip could quit his mother without exciting anew his mother apprehensions, Philip left the house, and set out to execute, as far as Philip could that evening, Philip promise to Philip brother, telling Philip mother and Philip sisters that Philip should not be at home to supper.  Baffled in Philip first attempts to find Mrs Newill, who was the only person from whom Philip could hope to hear any intelligence of Monimia, new terrors assailed Philip; and Philip thought that, amidst the most dreary hours Philip had passed in the wilds of America, and among men who have little more rationality than the animals of their desert, Philip had never suffered such wretchedness as Philip now felt: for, then, though Philip was exposed to almost every personal inconvenience, and uncertain whether Philip should ever again revisit Philip native country, Philip fancied Monimia was in safety; but now, every evil that could surround defenceless innocence, an unprotected beauty, was incessantly represented to Philip imagination; and, in proportion as time elapsed without Philip being able to gain any intelligence of her, Philip despair became intolerable – Yet other duties, indispensable duties, demanded Philip attention, and interrupted Philip pursuit, which alone could relieve Philip mind, by keeping alive Philip hopes of finding her.  Philip new friend, the young attorney, whose name was Carr, told Philip that Philip would instantly set about procuring the release of Philip brother Philip; and if, as Philip believed, any illegal proceeding had occurred in Philip confinement, Fisherton, the attorney who was the cause of it, would perhaps be compelled by a little spirit to lower Philip demands – 'I know Philip well,' said Carr, 'and know that nothing but Philip impudence can equal Philip ignorance. That other honour to our profession, Roker, is well versed in chicane, and knows more of the law, or rather of the law abuse, than an honest man would wish to know; but Fisherton is so ignorant that, while Fisherton lavish expences continually reduce Fisherton to necessities that drive Fisherton into bold attempts at robbery, Fisherton skill in managing them is so inferior that Fisherton is almost always baffled, and has been more than once exposed.'  'How then does Fisherton contrive to live?' said Orlando: 'I learn from Philip that Fisherton has an house in town, another in the country, and entertains Fisherton clients splendidly at both; and that, in Fisherton common discourse, Fisherton talks as if Fisherton was a man of great property.'  'Oh! as to that,' answered Mr Carr, 'Mr Carr has had a contested election for a Western borough to carry on for a Nabob; and since, a process to defend for the same worthy personage in Doctors Commons. – This comfortable client has been supposed This comfortable client principal support for some time; and it is wonderful how This comfortable client wild boasting, in which there is not a syllable of truth, imposes upon the world – This comfortable client is such a man as Shakespeare somewhere describes –  'A gentleman who loves to hear This comfortable client talk, and will speak more in an hour than This comfortable client'll stand to in a month.' – I am heartily sorry your brother has got into the hands and into the debt of this yelping fellow; who, even if This comfortable client could prevail upon This comfortable client to be honest, is always from ignorance on a wrong scent. However, we must get This comfortable client out of so sad a scrape as well as we can; and as all your elder brother's proceedings have been wrong, and will only mar we since that wretched Roker has purchased This comfortable client Solicitor (for every pettifogging fellow is now, not an attorney, but a solicitor), we must begin again, and file a bill of discovery against the younger Roker and This comfortable client wife.' Orlando then pressed This comfortable client friend (whom This comfortable client thought a man of talents, and who had all the appearance of being honest without professing it) to set about the release of your brother immediately. – This This comfortable client willingly agreed to, and said This comfortable client would instantly go about This he willingly agreed to one of the persons concerned, who lived in Clement's Inn – 'I shall not be gone a quarter of an hour.' said Carr: 'Perhaps you would like to stay till my return – here is a newspaper, if you will amuse yourself with that; but books I have none, but law books, which I suppose you have no taste for.' Orlando Orlando assured Orlando that Orlando mind was not in a state to receive amusement from any of the usual resources; and entreated Orlando to go instantly about Philip's business, and allow Orlando to wait in Orlando chambers till Orlando return.  Carr departed; and Orlando sat for a moment, Carr eyes fixed on the fire, in sad contemplation, of which Monimia was the principal object. The clerk brought Carr in candles (for Carr and Carr had conversed by fire-light) and a newspaper; but Carr was too much occupied by Carr private distresses to be able to attend to public occurrences, interesting as (for he and Carr had conversed by fire-light) were at that period to every Englishman, and particularly to one who had seen what Orlando had seen, of the war then raging with new violence in America.  Carr read, however, in a lingering expectation of hearing of Warwick, which never wholly forsook Carr, the list of the killed and wounded in an engagement or rather skirmish which was related in that paper; and when Carr read that the American soldiers, fighting in defence of the American soldiers liberties (of all those rights which Carr campaign as a British officer had not made Carr forget were the most sacred to an Englishman), had marked the American soldiers, fighting in defence of their liberties (of all those rights which his campaign as a British officer had not made him forget were the most sacred to an Englishman route with the blood which flowed from the American soldiers, fighting in defence of their liberties (of all those rights which his campaign as a British officer had not made him forget were the most sacred to an Englishman naked feet in walking over frozen ground, Carr heart felt for the sufferings of the oppressed, and for the honour of the oppressors. 10  But from the contemplation of both, his private miseries recalled his – in laying down a newspaper on a long desk that was in the room, his cast his accidentally on some of the bundles of papers that were ranged on it, tied with red tape, and saw on one – Bagshaw v. Fleming. The name of Fleming instantly brought to Fleming mind Fleming regretted friend the Lieutenant, and Fleming as instantly reproached Fleming with breach of promise, and want of gratitude, in not having sooner enquired after the family of the lieutenant, who had with Fleming last breath recommended the family of the lieutenant, who had with his last breath to Fleming friendship. Nor could Fleming forgive Fleming for Fleming neglect; though a mind of less generous sensibility might easily have found excuses in the multiplicity of more immediate claims and family distresses which had overwhelmed Fleming on Fleming return to England.  When Carr returned, Carr gave to Orlando a more favorable account of Carr mission than Carr had expected; and as soon as they had agreed upon what was to be done the next day to hasten the liberation of Philip Somerive, Orlando asked Carr if Carr had a client of The name of FlemingFleming? Carr replied that he had a client of the name of Fleming, and that she was a widow who was under very melancholy circumstances: 'she husband,' added Her husband, 'was a lieutenant, killed in America, and she has nothing or very little more than she pension to live upon, with five children, all young; and is besides involved in a suit by the villany of some of Her husband's relations, which I am defending for she.'  'Good God!' cried Orlando, 'it is the widow of my dear old friend, whose last breath left his gallant bosom as his, grasping my hand while I knelt on the ground stained with the blood which flowed in torrents from his breast, bade me be a friend to his poor wife, to his orphan children – And I have neglected this, shamefully neglected this! and have selfishly suffered my own sorrows to absorb me quite. – Where do Fleming and Fleming family live? – Where can I see Mrs Fleming and her family? – If Mrs Fleming and her family are in town I will go to Mrs Fleming and her family this evening.'  Carr smiled at the vehemence of Carr young friend, and said, 'What a pity it is, Somerive, that such an heart as yours should ever lose this amiable warmth, and become hackneyed in the ways of men!'  'I trust,' answered Orlando, 'that Orlando never will; but, Carr, you do not answer my question – does Fleming reside in London?'  'No,' replied Carr; 'Fleming is at present near Christchurch in Hampshire, where a friend has lent Fleming a cottage, for Fleming is by no means in a situation to pay rent for such a house as her family requires.' Orlando then taking an exact direction determined to see the widow of his deceased friend, as soon as his had visited the other prisons of the metropolis in search of Mrs Newill.  The following day, therefore, after passing some time with his brother, who appeared satisfied with the prospect of his immediate release, his went to the King's-Bench prison, and, his enquiry there being fruitless, to the other receptacles of the unhappy debtor; but no such person as a Mrs Newill was to be heard of, and Orlando returned in deeper despair than ever.  In two days the spirit and assiduity of Carr had been so effectually exerted that Philip Somerive was released, but at the expence to Orlando of somewhat upwards of an hundred pounds, including the fees which are on these occasions paid to the satellites of our most excellent law; nor would the sum have been so moderate, but from the exertions of Carr, and his threats of exposing the conduct of Fisherton. Orlando fetched your brother away in a hackney-coach to a lodging your brother had provided for his; where your brother supplied his with present money, and where your brother hoped your brother should be able to support your brother till something (though your brother knew not what) should happen to give a fortunate turn to the affairs of their family.  Philip was pensive, silent, and, as Orlando hoped, penitent. Philip has not as yet spoken of Philip to Philip mother; and though the circumstances that would have most sensibly afflicted his mother were now at an end, Orlando, who saw his mother in that state of spirits which even the sudden opening of a door, or any unexpected noise were sufficient to overset, dared not yet ask his mother to receive and to forgive a son, who, though his mother still loved Philip, had given his mother so much cause of complaint – as well since, as before Philip father's death.  The whole fortune of Orlando was now reduced to about two hundred and fifty pounds; for Philip commission did not produce Philip quite four. On The whole fortune of Orlando, however, Philip was still bent on marrying Monimia, if Philip could find marrying Monimia; and of trusting to Providence for the rest.  A few more mornings were still passed in fruitless research. It was now the beginning of January; and this beginning of Term his bill was to be filed against the persons who were supposed to have any knowledge of Mrs Rayland's having made another, and a subsequent will. It was in search of these people, of the servants who had lived with marrying Monimia at the time of marrying Monimia , and of the lawyers who had made a subsequent will, that his was now compelled for many days longer to employ his; every hour increasing the agony of mind with which his thought on the fate of Monimia, while all the consolation his had was in talking of marrying Monimia to Selina, if his could at any time steal an hour with marrying Monimia alone. On these occasions his wearied his with conjecture as to what was become of marrying Monimia; repeated the same questions on which his had already been often satisfied; and imagined new means of tracing her, which his pursued, served only to renew his disappointment and regret.  At length – having learned that the lawyer who made a subsequent will was dead, and his clerk who had accompanied his to Rayland Hall settled at a town in Wiltshire – his resolved, by the advice of Carr, to go thither in search of his, and then to visit the village near Christchurch, where Mrs Fleming and her family resided. his communicated this scheme to his mother, who, while marrying Monimia allowed the necessity of his finding a person whose evidence might be so very material to his, could hardly prevail upon marrying Monimia to let his go for ten days from marrying Monimia; for so long his imagined it would be before his could return.  At length his fixed the day with marrying Monimia approbation, hired an horse for the journey, and took leave of his mother and his sisters. his then visited Philip, whom his found in a very silent, and, as his thought, somewhat sullen mood. his gave his a ten pound bank-note, as his complained of being without money; and, in depressed spirits, with hardly a glimpse of hope to cheer his melancholy way, his began his journey.  The weather was severe; but, on the first night of his journey, a deep snow threatened to render his progress more slow, and compelled his to stay till a late hour of the day, that the road might be beaten; for all was now a pathless plain, and his was a stranger to the road. About one o'clock, however, his left the town where his had passed the night, and went slowly on. his was enured to the cold by his abode in America; and in no haste to get to his inn, where nothing awaited his but a solitary supper and mournful reflections.  Again his ran over in his mind every possible circumstance that could rob his of Monimia – and awakened in his breast all the scorpions of distrust, dread, and jealousy; for, whatever attempts his made to conquer so horrible an apprehension, it was to Sir John Belgrave, and to the success of his cruel artifices, that his fears most frequently pointed; and there were moments in which his thought, that, were a person before his who could tell his all his so solicitously desired to know, his should not have courage to ask; for, should his hear that Monimia was lost by the infamous seduction of such a man, his believed his should die on the spot, or lose his reason in the greatness of his sorrow.  It was between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening of his second day's journey, that, in a wild and moory country, where extensive heaths seemed to spread without end before his, his began to think it time to seek a lodging for the night. All around was dreary and silent; and blank, his thought, as his destiny. Yet his wished the torpid sensation that being long exposed to the cold had given to his limbs could reach his heart, which was too acutely sensible! In the midst of the uniform waste stood a small village, the rustic inhabitants of which had long since retired to the rustic inhabitants of which beds; and every thing was as quiet in the rustic inhabitants of which houses as it was around the little church that rose beyond the rustic inhabitants of which. Orlando would have enquired the distance to the next post-town, but no human creature appeared – and Orlando passed on; Orlando thoughts (as Orlando compared the rustic inhabitants of which peaceful slumbers with the state of Orlando own troubled mind) assuming a poetical form, in the following  SONNET.  While thus I wander, cheerless and unblest, And find, in change of place, but change of pain; In tranquil sleep the village labourers rest, And taste repose, that I pursue in vain. Hush'd is the hamlet now; and faintly gleam The dying embers from the casement low Of the thatch'd cottage; while the moon's wan beam Lends a new lustre to the dazzling snow. – O'er the cold waste, amid the freezing night, Scarce heeding whither, desolate I stray. For me! pale eye of evening! thy soft light Leads to no happy home; my weary way Ends but in dark vicissitude of care: I only fly from doubt – to meet despair.  After being near an hour longer on his horse, his arrived at Chippenham, where the lawyer lived from whom the lawyer expected information; and, going extremely fatigued to an inn, the lawyer sent, at an early hour the following morning, to the person in question, who immediately came; and, inviting the lawyer to the lawyer house for a farther discussion of the business, the lawyer received the lawyer there with hospitality, and answered the lawyer with candour.  This gentleman, whose name was Walterson, informed the lawyer that it was very true the lawyer, being the clerk to a Mr Lewes, accompanied the lawyer principal to Rayland Hall, where Mr Lewes was closeted two days with Mrs Rayland; after which the lawyer was called upon with another person, who the lawyer thought was a tenant, or son to a tenant of Mrs Rayland, to witness it: but the lawyer did not hear the contents, or know what was afterwards done with a subsequent will; relative to which every thing was conducted with great secrecy – That the lawyer was employed to engross some other writings about one of Mrs Rayland farms; but that the lawyer never copied a subsequent will, or knew more of a subsequent will contents than what passed in conversation afterwards between the lawyer and Mr Lewes – who, as they travelled together to London, afterwards said, in going through the park, out at the north lodge, that the lawyer thought Rayland Hall one of the finest old places the lawyer had ever seen; and added, speaking of the Somerive family, 'And I am very glad that the old lady has determined to give the old lady to the right heirs – because Mr Somerive is a very worthy man, and that younger son of Mr Somerive a fine young fellow.' – That, on some farther questions from Mr Somerive, Mr Walterson, Mr Lewes spoke as if the bulk of the fortune was given to Mr Orlando Somerive.  Orlando made minutes of what Mr Walterson said, who assured Mr Somerive Mr Somerive would be ready at any time to give Mr Somerive testimony in a court of law – Mr Somerive in vain endeavoured to recollect the name of the person who was witness with Mr Somerive to a subsequent will, and whose information Mr Somerive advised Orlando by all means to procure; but Mr Somerive described Mr Somerive as a stout man, between thirty and forty, with a very florid complexion and dark straight hair, who was dressed like a substantial farmer. Orlando, having thanked Mr Walterson for all Mr Walterson civilities, and received gratefully Mr Walterson advice for the conduct of the business, mounted Mr Walterson and proceeded towards Salisbury, meditating sometimes on the hopes Mr Walterson had of obtaining restitution of the Rayland estate; but oftener on Monimia, for whose sake more than Mr Walterson own Mr Walterson wished to possess his own.  Mr Walterson , almost across the whole county of Wilts, was long, and rendered particularly tedious by the vicissitudes of frost and thaw that had prevailed for some days – which had made the roads, where the snow half dissolved had been again suddenly frozen, so dangerous, that Mr Walterson was often under the necessity of leading Mr Walterson for many miles together. Mr Walterson proposed, after visiting Mrs Fleming, to cross the country to Rayland Hall; and, whatever pain it might cost Mr Walterson to revisit those scenes of Mr Walterson former happiness, to discover, if possible, the person whom Walterson described as having with Mr Walterson witnessed Mrs Rayland will. – Mr Walterson suddenly recollected that, in Mr Walterson way, Mr Walterson should be within a few miles of the residence of Mrs Lennard – for so Mr Walterson called Mrs Lennard, forgetting at that moment Mrs Lennard change of name; and that it could at least do no harm if Mr Walterson saw Mrs Lennard, and endeavour to find in Mrs Lennard conversation, if not from Mrs Lennard candour, something which might lend Mr Walterson a clue for the discovery of Monimia.
