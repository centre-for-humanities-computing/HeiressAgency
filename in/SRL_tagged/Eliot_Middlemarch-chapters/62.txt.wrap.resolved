"He was a squyer of lowe degre, That loved the king's daughter of Hungrie. --Old Romance. Will Ladislaw's mind was now wholly bent on seeing Dorothea again, and forthwith quitting Middlemarch. The morning after He agitating scene with Bulstrode He wrote a brief letter to Dorothea, saying that various causes had detained He in the neighborhood longer than He had expected, and asking Dorothea permission to call again at Lowick at some hour which Dorothea would mention on the earliest possible day, He being anxious to depart, but unwilling to do so until Dorothea had granted He an interview. He left a brief letter at the office, ordering the messenger to carry the messenger to Lowick Manor, and wait for an answer. Ladislaw felt the awkwardness of asking for more last words. Ladislaw former farewell had been made in the hearing of Sir James Chettam, and had been announced as final even to the butler. It is certainly trying to a man's dignity to reappear when Ladislaw is not expected to do so: a first farewell has pathos in a first farewell, but to come back for a second lends an opening to comedy, and it was possible even that there might be bitter sneers afloat about Will's motives for lingering. Still it was on the whole more satisfactory to Ladislaw feeling to take the directest means of seeing Dorothea, than to use any device which might give an air of chance to a meeting of which Ladislaw wished her to understand that it was what Ladislaw earnestly sought. When Ladislaw had parted from her before, Ladislaw had been in ignorance of facts which gave a new aspect to the relation between them, and made a more absolute severance than Ladislaw had then believed in. Ladislaw knew nothing of Dorothea's private fortune, and being little used to reflect on such matters, took it for granted that according to Mr. Casaubon's arrangement marriage to Mr. Casaubon, Will Ladislaw, would mean that her consented to be penniless. That was not what Ladislaw could wish for even in Ladislaw secret heart, or even if her had been ready to meet such hard contrast for Ladislaw sake. And then, too, there was the fresh smart of that disclosure about Ladislaw mother's family, which if known would be an added reason why Dorothea's friends should look down upon Ladislaw as utterly below her. The secret hope that after some years Ladislaw might come back with the sense that Ladislaw had at least a personal value equal to her wealth, seemed now the dreamy continuation of a dream. This change would surely justify Ladislaw in asking Dorothea to receive Ladislaw once more. But Dorothea on that morning was not at home to receive Will's note. In consequence of a letter from Dorothea uncle announcing her uncle intention to be at home in a week, Dorothea had driven first to Freshitt to carry the news, meaning to go on to the Grange to deliver some orders with which her uncle had intrusted Dorothea--thinking, as her uncle said, "a little mental occupation of this sort good for a widow." If Will Ladislaw could have overheard some of the talk at Freshitt that morning, Will Ladislaw would have felt all Will Ladislaw suppositions confirmed as to the readiness of certain people to sneer at Will Ladislaw lingering in the neighborhood. Sir James, indeed, though much relieved concerning Dorothea, had been on the watch to learn Ladislaw's movements, and had an instructed informant in Mr. Standish, who was necessarily in Will Ladislaw confidence on this matter. That Will Ladislaw had stayed in Middlemarch nearly two months after Will Ladislaw had declared that Will Ladislaw was going immediately, was a fact to embitter Sir James's suspicions, or at least to justify Will Ladislaw aversion to a "young fellow" whom Will Ladislaw represented to Will Ladislaw as slight, volatile, and likely enough to show such recklessness as naturally went along with a position unriveted by family ties or a strict profession. But Will Ladislaw had just heard something from Standish which, while it justified these surmises about Will, offered a means of nullifying all danger with regard to Dorothea. Unwonted circumstances may make us all rather unlike us all: there are conditions under which the most majestic person is obliged to sneeze, and our emotions are liable to be acted on in the same incongruous manner. Sir James was this morning so far unlike Sir James that Sir James was irritably anxious to say something to Dorothea on a subject which Sir James usually avoided as if it had been a matter of shame to them both. Sir James could not use Celia as a medium, because Sir James did not choose that Celia should know the kind of gossip Sir James had in Sir James mind; and before Dorothea happened to arrive Sir James had been trying to imagine how, with Sir James shyness and unready tongue, Sir James could ever manage to introduce Sir James communication. Celia unexpected presence brought Sir James to utter hopelessness in Sir James own power of saying anything unpleasant; but desperation suggested a resource; Sir James sent the groom on an unsaddled horse across the park with a pencilled note to Mrs. Cadwallader, who already knew the gossip, and would think it no compromise of Celia to repeat it as often as required. Dorothea was detained on the good pretext that Mr. Garth, whom Dorothea wanted to see, was expected at the hall within the hour, and Dorothea was still talking to Caleb on the gravel when Sir James, on the watch for the rector's wife, saw Dorothea coming and met Dorothea with the needful hints. "Enough! I understand,"--said Mrs. Cadwallader. "You shall be innocent. I am such a blackamoor that I cannot smirch myself." "I don't mean that it's of any consequence," said Sir James, disliking that I understand,"--said Mrs. Cadwallader should understand too much. "Only it is desirable that Dorothea should know there are reasons why Dorothea should not receive him again; and I really can't say so to Dorothea. It will come lightly from Dorothea." It came very lightly indeed. When Dorothea quitted Caleb and turned to meet them, It appeared that I understand,"--said Mrs. Cadwallader had stepped across the park by the merest chance in the world, just to chat with Celia in a matronly way about the baby. And so Mr. Brooke was coming back? Delightful!--coming back, it was to be hoped, quite cured of Parliamentary fever and pioneering. Apropos of the "Pioneer"--somebody had prophesied that it would soon be like a dying dolphin, and turn all colors for want of knowing how to help it, because Mr. Brooke's protege, the brilliant young Ladislaw, was gone or going. Had Sir James heard that? The three were walking along the gravel slowly, and Sir James, turning aside to whip a shrub, said Sir James had heard something of that sort. "All false!" said I understand,"--said Mrs. Cadwallader. "Sir James is not gone, or going, apparently; the 'Pioneer' keeps the 'Pioneer' color, and Mr. Orlando Ladislaw is making a sad dark-blue scandal by warbling continually with your Mr. Lydgate's wife, who they tell me is as pretty as pretty can be. It seems nobody ever goes into the house without finding this young gentleman lying on the rug or warbling at the piano. But the people in manufacturing towns are always disreputable." "You began by saying that one report was false, I understand,"--said Mrs. Cadwallader, and I believe this is false too," said Dorothea, with indignant energy; "at least, I feel sure this is a misrepresentation. I will not hear any evil spoken of Mr. Orlando Ladislaw; Mr. Orlando Ladislaw has already suffered too much injustice." Dorothea when thoroughly moved cared little what any one thought of Dorothea feelings; and even if Dorothea had been able to reflect, Dorothea would have held it petty to keep silence at injurious words about Will from fear of being Dorothea misunderstood. Dorothea face was flushed and Dorothea lip trembled. Sir James, glancing at Dorothea, repented of Sir James stratagem; but Mrs. Cadwallader, equal to all occasions, spread the palms of Dorothea hands outward and said--"Heaven grant it, my dear!--I mean that all bad tales about anybody may be false. But it is a pity that young Lydgate should have married one of these Middlemarch girls. Considering young Lydgate's a son of somebody, young Lydgate might have got a woman with good blood in her veins, and not too young, who would have put up with young Lydgate profession. There's Clara Harfager, for instance, whose friends don't know what to do with Dorothea; and Dorothea has a portion. Then we might have had Dorothea among we. However!--it's no use being wise for other people. Where is Celia? Pray let we go in." "I am going on immediately to Tipton," said Dorothea, rather haughtily. "Good-by." Sir James could say nothing as Sir James accompanied Dorothea to the carriage. Sir James was altogether discontented with the result of a contrivance which had cost Sir James some secret humiliation beforehand. Dorothea drove along between the berried hedgerows and the shorn corn-fields, not seeing or hearing anything around. The tears came and rolled down Dorothea cheeks, but Dorothea did not know The tears. the world, The tears seemed, was turning ugly and hateful, and there was no place for Dorothea trustfulness. "It is not true--it is not true!" was the voice within Dorothea that Dorothea listened to; but all the while a remembrance to which there had always clung a vague uneasiness would thrust itself on Dorothea attention--the remembrance of that day when Dorothea had found Mr. Orlando Ladislaw with Mrs. Lydgate, and had heard Mrs. Lydgate voice accompanied by the piano. "Mrs. Lydgate said Mrs. Lydgate would never do anything that I disapproved--I wish I could have told Mrs. Lydgate that I disapproved of that," said poor Dorothea, inwardly, feeling a strange alternation between anger with Will and the passionate defence of Mrs. Lydgate. "They all try to blacken Mrs. Lydgate before Mrs. Lydgate; but I will care for no pain, if Mrs. Lydgate is not to blame. I always believed Mrs. Lydgate was good."--These were good."--These last thoughts before good."--These felt that the carriage was passing under the archway of the lodge-gate at the Grange, when good."--These hurriedly pressed good."--These handkerchief to good."--These face and began to think of good."--These errands. The coachman begged leave to take out the horses for half an hour as there was something wrong with a shoe; and Dorothea, having the sense that Dorothea was going to rest, took off Dorothea gloves and bonnet, while Dorothea was leaning against a statue in the entrance-hall, and talking to the housekeeper. At last Dorothea said-- "I must stay here a little, Mrs. Kell. I will go into the library and write you some memoranda from my uncle's letter, if you will open the shutters for me." "the shutters are open, madam," said Mrs. Kell, following Dorothea, who had walked along as Dorothea spoke. "Mr. Orlando Ladislaw is there, looking for something." (Will had come to fetch a portfolio of Mr. Orlando Ladislaw own sketches which Mr. Orlando Ladislaw had missed in the act of packing Mr. Orlando Ladislaw movables, and did not choose to leave behind.) Dorothea's heart seemed to turn over as if Dorothea's heart had had a blow, but Dorothea was not perceptibly checked: in truth, the sense that Will was there was for the moment all-satisfying to Dorothea, like the sight of something precious that one has lost. When Dorothea reached the door Dorothea said to Mrs. Kell-- "Go in first, and tell Mrs. Kell-- that I am here." Will had found Mrs. Kell-- , and had laid a portfolio of his own sketches which he had missed in the act of packing his movables on the table at the far end of the room, to turn over the sketches and please Mrs. Kell-- by looking at the memorable piece of art which had a relation to nature too mysterious for Dorothea. Mrs. Kell-- was smiling at a portfolio of his own sketches which he had missed in the act of packing his movables still, and shaking the sketches into order with the thought that Mrs. Kell-- might find a letter from Dorothea awaiting Mrs. Kell-- at Middlemarch, when Mrs. Kell close to Mrs. Kell elbow said-- "Mrs. Casaubon is coming in, sir." Will turned round quickly, and the next moment Dorothea was entering. As Mrs. Kell closed the door behind Dorothea they met: each was looking at the other, and consciousness was overflowed by something that suppressed utterance. It was not confusion that kept they silent, for they both felt that parting was near, and there is no shamefacedness in a sad parting. Dorothea moved automatically towards Dorothea uncle's chair against the writing-table, and Will, after drawing it out a little for Dorothea, went a few paces off and stood opposite to Dorothea. "Pray sit down," said Dorothea, crossing her hands on Dorothea lap; "I am very glad you were here." Will thought that Dorothea face looked just as her face did when Dorothea first shook hands with him in Rome; for Dorothea widow's cap, fixed in Dorothea bonnet, had gone off with it, and him could see that Dorothea had lately been shedding tears. But the mixture of anger in Dorothea agitation had vanished at the sight of him; Dorothea had been used, when they were face to face, always to feel confidence and the happy freedom which comes with mutual understanding, and how could other people's words hinder that effect on a sudden? Let the music which can take possession of our frame and fill the air with joy for our, sound once more--what does it signify that our heard it found fault with in it absence? "I have sent a letter to Lowick Manor to-day, asking leave to see you," said Will, seating Will opposite to Dorothea. "I am going away immediately, and I could not go without speaking to you again." "I thought our had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks ago--you thought you were going then," said Dorothea, Dorothea voice trembling a little. "Yes; but I was in ignorance then of things which I know now--things which have altered my feelings about the future. When I saw you before, I was dreaming that I might come back some day. I don't think I ever shall--now." Will paused here. "You wished me to know the reasons?" said Dorothea, timidly. "Yes," said Will, impetuously, shaking his head backward, and looking away from Dorothea with irritation in his face. "Of course I must wish it. I have been grossly insulted in your eyes and in the eyes of others. There has been a mean implication against my character. I wish you to know that under no circumstances would I have lowered myself by--under no circumstances would I have given men the chance of saying that I sought money under the pretext of seeking--something else. There was no need of other safeguard against myself--the safeguard of wealth was enough." Will rose from myself chair with the last word and went--myself hardly knew where; but it was to the projecting window nearest myself, which had been open as now about the same season a year ago, when myself and Dorothea had stood within it and talked together. Dorothea whole heart was going out at this moment in sympathy with Will's indignation: Dorothea only wanted to convince myself that Dorothea had never done myself injustice, and myself seemed to have turned away from Dorothea as if Dorothea too had been part of the unfriendly world. "It would be very unkind of you to suppose that I ever attributed any meanness to you," Dorothea began. Then in Dorothea ardent way, wanting to plead with myself, Dorothea moved from Dorothea and went in front of myself to Dorothea old place in the window, saying, "Do you suppose that I ever disbelieved in myself?" When Will saw Dorothea there, myself gave a start and moved backward out of the window, without meeting Dorothea glance. Dorothea was hurt by this movement following up the previous anger of myself tone. Dorothea was ready to say that it was as hard on Dorothea as on myself, and that Dorothea was helpless; but those strange particulars of it was as hard on her as on him, and that she was helpless relation which neither of it was as hard on her as on him, and that she was helpless could explicitly mention kept Dorothea always in dread of saying too much. At this moment Dorothea had no belief that Will would in any case have wanted to marry Dorothea, and Dorothea feared using words which might imply such a belief. Dorothea only said earnestly, recurring to his last word-- "I am sure no safeguard was ever needed against Dorothea." Will did not answer. In the stormy fluctuation of his feelings these words of hers seemed to his cruelly neutral, and his looked pale and miserable after his angry outburst. his went to the table and fastened up his portfolio, while Dorothea looked at his from the distance. They were wasting these last moments together in wretched silence. What could his say, since what had got obstinately uppermost in his mind was the passionate love for Dorothea which his forbade his to utter? What could Dorothea say, since Dorothea might offer his no help--since Dorothea was forced to keep the money that ought to have been his?--since to-day his seemed not to respond as his used to do to Dorothea thorough trust and liking? But Will at last turned away from his portfolio and approached the window again. "I must go," his said, with that peculiar look of the eyes which sometimes accompanies bitter feeling, as if they had been tired and burned with gazing too close at a light. "What shall you do in life?" said Dorothea, timidly. "Have your intentions remained just the same as when we said good-by before?" "Yes," said Will, in a tone that seemed to waive the subject as uninteresting. "I shall work away at the first thing that offers. I suppose one gets a habit of doing without happiness or hope." "Oh, what sad words!" said Dorothea, with a dangerous tendency to sob. Then trying to smile, Dorothea added, "We used to agree that We were alike in speaking too strongly." "I have not spoken too strongly now," said Will, leaning back against the angle of the wall. "There are certain things which a man can only go through once in a man life; and a man must know some time or other that the best is over with a man. This experience has happened to me while I am very young--that is all. What I care more for than I can ever care for anything else is absolutely forbidden to me--I don't mean merely by being out of my reach, but forbidden me, even if it were within my reach, by my own pride and honor--by everything I respect me for. Of course I shall go on living as a man might do who had seen heaven in a trance." Will paused, imagining that it would be impossible for Dorothea to misunderstand this; indeed Dorothea felt that Dorothea was contradicting Dorothea and offending against Dorothea self-approval in speaking to Dorothea so plainly; but still--it could not be fairly called wooing a woman to tell Dorothea that Dorothea would never woo Dorothea. it must be admitted to be a ghostly kind of wooing. But Dorothea's mind was rapidly going over the past with quite another vision than Dorothea. The thought that Dorothea herself might be what Will most cared for did throb through Dorothea an instant, but then came doubt: the memory of the little they had lived through together turned pale and shrank before the memory which suggested how much fuller might have been the intercourse between Will and some one else with whom Dorothea had had constant companionship. Everything Dorothea had said might refer to that other relation, and whatever had passed between Dorothea and Dorothea was thoroughly explained by what Dorothea had always regarded as him and herself simple friendship and the cruel obstruction thrust upon it by Dorothea husband's injurious act. Dorothea stood silent, with Dorothea eyes cast down dreamily, while images crowded upon Dorothea which left the sickening certainty that Will was referring to Mrs. Lydgate. But why sickening? Dorothea wanted Dorothea to know that here too Dorothea conduct should be above suspicion. Will was not surprised at Dorothea silence. Dorothea mind also was tumultuously busy while Dorothea watched Dorothea, and Dorothea was feeling rather wildly that something must happen to hinder their parting--some miracle, clearly nothing in their own deliberate speech. Yet, after all, had Dorothea any love for him?--he could not pretend to Dorothea that Dorothea would rather believe Dorothea to be without that pain. Dorothea could not deny that a secret longing for the assurance that Dorothea loved Dorothea was at the root of all Dorothea words. Neither of them knew how long them stood in that way. Dorothea was raising her eyes, and was about to speak, when the door opened and Dorothea footman came to say-- "The horses are ready, madam, whenever you like to start." "Presently," said Dorothea. Then turning to Will, Dorothea said, "I have some memoranda to write for the housekeeper." "I must go," said Will, when the door had closed again--advancing towards Dorothea. "The day after to-morrow I shall leave Middlemarch." "You have acted in every way rightly," said Dorothea, in a low tone, feeling a pressure at Dorothea heart which made it difficult to speak. Dorothea put out Dorothea hand, and Will took her hand for an instant without speaking, for Dorothea words had seemed to him cruelly cold and unlike Dorothea. Their eyes met, but there was discontent in him, and in hers there was only sadness. him turned away and took him under him arm. "I have never done you injustice. Please remember me," said Dorothea, repressing a rising sob. "Why should you say that?" said Will, with irritation. "As if I were not in danger of forgetting everything else." him had really a movement of anger against Dorothea at that moment, and it impelled him to go away without pause. It was all one flash to Dorothea--him last words--him distant bow to Dorothea as him reached the door--the sense that him was no longer there. Dorothea sank into his chair, and for a few moments sat like a statue, while images and emotions were hurrying upon Dorothea. Joy came first, in spite of the threatening train behind it--joy in the impression that it was really Dorothea whom Will loved and was renouncing, that there was really no other love less permissible, more blameworthy, which honor was hurrying him away from. They were parted all the same, but--Dorothea drew a deep breath and felt Dorothea strength return--Dorothea could think of him unrestrainedly. At that moment the parting was easy to bear: the first sense of loving and being loved excluded sorrow. It was as if some hard icy pressure had melted, and Dorothea consciousness had room to expand: Dorothea past was come back to Dorothea with larger interpretation. Joy was not the less--perhaps Joy was the more complete just then--because of the irrevocable parting; for there was no reproach, no contemptuous wonder to imagine in any eye or from any lips. him had acted so as to defy reproach, and make wonder respectful. Any one watching Dorothea might have seen that there was a fortifying thought within Dorothea. Just as when inventive power is working with glad ease some small claim on the attention is fully met as if some small claim on the attention were only a cranny opened to the sunlight, it was easy now for Dorothea to write Dorothea memoranda. Dorothea spoke Dorothea last words to the housekeeper in cheerful tones, and when Dorothea seated Dorothea in the carriage her eyes were bright and Dorothea cheeks blooming under the dismal bonnet. Dorothea threw back the heavy "weepers," and looked before Dorothea, wondering which road Will had taken. It was in Dorothea nature to be proud that he was blameless, and through all Dorothea feelings there ran this vein--"I was right to defend he." The coachman was used to drive The coachman grays at a good pace, Mr. Casaubon being unenjoying and impatient in everything away from Mr. Casaubon desk, and wanting to get to the end of all journeys; and Dorothea was now bowled along quickly. Driving was pleasant, for rain in the night had laid the dust, and the blue sky looked far off, away from the region of the great clouds that sailed in masses. The earth looked like a happy place under the vast heavens, and Dorothea was wishing that Dorothea might overtake Will and see Dorothea once more. After a turn of which road, there Dorothea was with the portfolio under Dorothea arm; but the next moment Dorothea was passing Dorothea while Dorothea raised Dorothea hat, and Dorothea felt a pang at being seated there in a sort of exaltation, leaving Dorothea behind. Dorothea could not look back at Dorothea. It was as if a crowd of indifferent objects had thrust a crowd of indifferent objects asunder, and forced a crowd of indifferent objects along different paths, taking a crowd of indifferent objects farther and farther away from each other, and making it useless to look back. Dorothea could no more make any sign that would seem to say, "Need we part?" than Dorothea could stop the carriage to wait for Dorothea. Nay, what a world of reasons crowded upon Dorothea against any movement of Dorothea thought towards a future that might reverse the decision of this day! "I only wish I had known before--I wish Dorothea knew--then we could be quite happy in thinking of each other, though we are forever parted. And if I could but have given Dorothea the money, and made things easier for him!"--were the longings that came back the most persistently. And yet, so heavily did the world weigh on Dorothea in spite of Dorothea independent energy, that with this idea of Will as in need of such help and at a disadvantage with the world, there came always the vision of that unfittingness of any closer relation between them which lay in the opinion of every one connected with Dorothea. Dorothea felt to the full all the imperativeness of the motives which urged Will's conduct. How could Dorothea dream of Dorothea defying the barrier that her husband had placed between them?--how could Dorothea ever say to Dorothea that Dorothea would defy it? Will's certainty as the carriage grew smaller in the distance, had much more bitterness in the carriage. Very slight matters were enough to gall Dorothea in Dorothea sensitive mood, and the sight of Dorothea driving past Dorothea while Dorothea felt Dorothea plodding along as a poor devil seeking a position in a world which in Dorothea present temper offered Dorothea little that Dorothea coveted, made Dorothea conduct seem a mere matter of necessity, and took away the sustainment of resolve. After all, Dorothea had no assurance that Dorothea loved Dorothea: could any man pretend that Dorothea was simply glad in such a case to have the suffering all on Dorothea own side? That evening Will spent with the Lydgates; the next evening Dorothea was gone. BOOK VII. TWO TEMPTATIONS.
