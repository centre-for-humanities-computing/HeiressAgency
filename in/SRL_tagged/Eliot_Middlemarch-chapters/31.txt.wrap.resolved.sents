How will you know the pitch of that great bell Too large for you to stir?
Let but a flute Play 'neath the fine-mixed metal listen close Till the right note flows forth, a silvery rill.
Then shall the huge bell tremble--then the mass With myriad waves concurrent shall respond In low soft unison.
Lydgate that evening spoke to Miss Vincy of Mrs. Casaubon, and laid some emphasis on the strong feeling Mrs. Casaubon appeared to have for that formal studious man thirty years older than Mrs. Casaubon.
"Of course Mrs. Casaubon is devoted to Mrs. Casaubon husband," said Rosamond, implying a notion of necessary sequence which the scientific man regarded as the prettiest possible for a woman; but a woman was thinking at the same time that it was not so very melancholy to be mistress of Lowick Manor with a husband likely to die soon.
"Do you think Mrs. Casaubon very handsome?"
"Mrs. Casaubon certainly is handsome, but I have not thought about it," said Lydgate.
"I suppose it would be unprofessional," said Rosamond, dimpling.
"But how your practice is spreading!
You were called in before to the Chettams, I think; and now, the Casaubons."
"Yes," said Lydgate, in a tone of compulsory admission.
"But I don't really like attending such people so well as the poor.
The cases are more monotonous, and one has to go through more fuss and listen more deferentially to nonsense."
"Not more than in Middlemarch," said Rosamond.
"And at least you go through wide corridors and have the scent of rose-leaves everywhere."
"That is true, Mademoiselle de Montmorenci," said Lydgate, just bending Lydgate head to the table and lifting with Lydgate fourth finger Mrs. Casaubon delicate handkerchief which lay at the mouth of Mrs. Casaubon reticule, as if to enjoy her reticule scent, while Lydgate looked at Mrs. Casaubon with a smile.
But this agreeable holiday freedom with which Lydgate hovered about the flower of Middlemarch, could not continue indefinitely.
It was not more possible to find social isolation in that town than elsewhere, and two people persistently flirting could by no means escape from "the various entanglements, weights, blows, clashings, motions, by which things severally go on."
Whatever Miss Vincy did must be remarked, and Miss Vincy was perhaps the more conspicuous to admirers and critics because just now Mrs. Vincy, after some struggle, had gone with Fred to stay a little while at Stone Court, there being no other way of at once gratifying old Featherstone and keeping watch against Mary Garth, who appeared a less tolerable daughter-in-law in proportion as Fred's illness disappeared.
Aunt Bulstrode, for example, came a little oftener into Lowick Gate to see Rosamond, now Rosamond was alone.
For Aunt Bulstrode had a true sisterly feeling for Aunt Bulstrode brother; always thinking that Aunt Bulstrode might have married better, but wishing well to the children.
Now Aunt Bulstrode had a long-standing intimacy with Mrs. Plymdale.
They had nearly the same preferences in silks, patterns for underclothing, china-ware, and clergymen; They confided They little troubles of health and household management to each other, and various little points of superiority on Aunt Bulstrode's side, namely, more decided seriousness, more admiration for mind, and a house outside the town, sometimes served to give color to They conversation without dividing They--well-meaning women both, knowing very little of They own motives.
Aunt Bulstrode, paying a morning visit to Mrs. Plymdale, happened to say that Aunt Bulstrode could not stay longer, because Aunt Bulstrode was going to see poor Rosamond.
"Why do you say 'poor Rosamond'?"
said Mrs. Plymdale, a round-eyed sharp little woman, like a tamed falcon.
"'poor Rosamond is so pretty, and has been brought up in such thoughtlessness.
Mrs. Plymdale, you know, had always that levity about 'poor Rosamond, which makes me anxious for the children."
"Well, Harriet, if I am to speak my mind," said Mrs. Plymdale, with emphasis, "I must say, anybody would suppose you and Aunt Bulstrode would be delighted with what has happened, for you have done everything to put Mr. Lydgate forward."
"'poor Rosamond, what do you mean?"
said Aunt Bulstrode, in genuine surprise.
"Not but what I am truly thankful for Ned's sake," said Mrs. Plymdale.
"Aunt Bulstrode could certainly better afford to keep such a wife than some people can; but I should wish Aunt Bulstrode to look elsewhere.
Still a mother has anxieties, and some young men would take to a bad life in consequence.
Besides, if I was obliged to speak, I should say I was not fond of strangers coming into a town."
"I don't know, 'poor Rosamond," said Aunt Bulstrode, with a little emphasis in 'poor Rosamond turn.
"Aunt Bulstrode was a stranger here at one time.
Abraham and Moses were strangers in the land, and Abraham and Moses are told to entertain strangers.
And especially," 'poor Rosamond added, after a slight pause, "when Abraham and Moses are unexceptionable."
"I was not speaking in a religious sense, Harriet.
I spoke as a mother."
"'poor Rosamond, I am sure you have never heard me say anything against a niece of mine marrying your son."
"Oh, it is pride in Miss Vincy--I am sure it is nothing else," said Mrs. Plymdale, who had never before given all 'poor Rosamond confidence to "Harriet" on this subject.
"No young man in Middlemarch was good enough for 'poor Rosamond: I have heard 'poor Rosamond mother say as much.
That is not a Christian spirit, I think.
But now, from all I hear, 'poor Rosamond has found a man as proud as 'poor Rosamond."
"You don't mean that there is anything between Rosamond and Mr.
Lydgate?"
said Mrs. Bulstrode, rather mortified at finding out 'poor Rosamond own ignorance.
"Is it possible you don't know, Harriet?"
"Oh, I go about so little; and I am not fond of gossip; I really never hear any.
You see so many people that I don't see.
Your circle is rather different from ours."
"Well, but your own niece and Mr. Bulstrode's great favorite--and yours too, I am sure, Harriet!
I thought, at one time, you meant him for Kate, when Kate is a little older."
"I don't believe there can be anything serious at present," said Mrs. Bulstrode.
"My brother would certainly have told me."
"Well, people have different ways, but I understand that nobody can see Miss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate together without taking people to be engaged.
However, it is not my business.
Shall I put up the pattern of mittens?"
After Mrs. Bulstrode drove to Mrs. Bulstrode niece with a mind newly weighted.
her niece was her niece handsomely dressed, but her niece noticed with a little more regret than usual that Rosamond, who was just come in and met her niece in walking-dress, was almost as expensively equipped.
Mrs. Bulstrode was a feminine smaller edition of My brother, and had none of her niece husband's low-toned pallor.
her niece had a good honest glance and used no circumlocution.
"You are alone, I see, my dear," her niece said, as they entered the drawing-room together, looking round gravely.
her niece felt sure that her niece aunt had something particular to say, and they sat down near each other.
Nevertheless, the quilling inside her niece's bonnet was so charming that it was impossible not to desire the same kind of thing for Kate, and Mrs. Bulstrode's eyes, which were rather fine, rolled round that ample quilled circuit, while her niece spoke.
"I have just heard something about you that has surprised me very much, her niece."
"What is that, aunt?"
her niece's eyes also were roaming over her aunt's large embroidered collar.
"I can hardly believe it--that you should be engaged without my knowing it--without your father's telling me."
Here Rosamond's eyes finally rested on her niece's, who blushed deeply, and said-- "I am not engaged, aunt."
"How is it that every one says so, then--that it is the town's talk?"
"the town's talk is of very little consequence, I think," said her niece, inwardly gratified.
"Oh, my dear, be more thoughtful; don't despise your neighbors so.
Remember you are turned twenty-two now, and you will have no fortune: your father, I am sure, will not be able to spare you anything.
Mr. Lydgate is very intellectual and clever; I know there is an attraction in that.
I like talking to such men myself; and your uncle finds your uncle very useful.
But the profession is a poor one here.
To be sure, this life is not everything; but this life is seldom a medical man has true religious views--there is too much pride of intellect.
And you are not fit to marry a poor man.
"Mr. Lydgate is not a poor man, aunt.
Mr. Lydgate has very high connections."
"Mr. Lydgate told me Mr. Lydgate Mr. Lydgate was poor."
"That is because Mr. Lydgate is used to people who have a high style "My dear Rosamond, _you_ must not think of living in high style."
her niece looked down and played with her niece reticule.
her niece was not a fiery young lady and had no sharp answers, but her niece meant to live as her niece pleased.
"Then it is really true?"
said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking very earnestly at Mrs. Bulstrode niece.
"You are thinking of Mr. Lydgate--there is some understanding between you, though your father doesn't know.
Be open, "My dear Rosamond: Mr. Lydgate has really made you an offer?"
"My dear Rosamondfeelings were very unpleasant.
her niece had been quite easy as to Lydgate's feeling and intention, but now when her niece aunt put this question her aunt did not like being unable to say Yes.
her aunt pride was hurt, but her aunt habitual control of manner helped her niece.
"Pray excuse me, her aunt.
I would rather not speak on the subject."
"You would not give your heart to a man without a decided prospect, I trust, my dear.
And think of the two excellent offers I know of that you have refused!--and one still within your reach, if you will not throw it away.
I knew a very great beauty who married badly at last, by doing so.
Mrs. Plymdale is a nice young man--some might think good-looking; and an only son; and a large business of that kind is better than a profession.
Not that marrying is everything.
I would have you seek first the kingdom of God.
But a girl should keep a girl heart within a girl own power."
"I should never give it to Mrs. Plymdale, if it were.
I have already refused Mrs. Plymdale.
If I loved, I should love at once and without change," said her niece, with a great sense of being a romantic heroine, and playing the part prettily.
"I see how it is, my dear," said Mrs. Bulstrode, in a melancholy voice, rising to go.
"You have allowed your affections to be engaged without return."
"No, indeed, aunt," said her niece, with emphasis.
"Then you are quite confident that Mr. Lydgate has a serious attachment to you?"
her niece's cheeks by this time were persistently burning, and her niece felt much mortification.
her niece chose to be silent, and her aunt went away all the more convinced.
Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent was disposed to do what Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent wife bade Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent, and his wife now, without telling his wife reasons, desired Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent on the next opportunity to find out in conversation with Mr. Lydgate whether Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent had any intention of marrying soon.
The result was a decided negative.
Aunt Bulstrode, on being cross-questioned, showed that Mr. Lydgate had spoken as no man would who had any attachment that could issue in matrimony.
Mrs. Bulstrode now felt that Mrs. Bulstrode had a serious duty before Mrs. Bulstrode, and Mrs. Bulstrode soon managed to arrange a tete-a-tete with Mr. Lydgate, in which Mrs. Bulstrode passed from inquiries about Fred Vincy's health, and expressions of Mrs. Bulstrode sincere anxiety for Mrs. Bulstrode brother's large family, to general remarks on the dangers which lay before young people with regard to young people settlement in life.
Young men were often wild and disappointing, making little return for the money spent on Young men, and a girl was exposed to many circumstances which might interfere with a girl prospects.
"Especially when a girl has great attractions, and a girl parents see much company," said Mrs. Bulstrode "Gentlemen pay Mrs. Bulstrode attention, and engross Mrs. Bulstrode all to "Gentlemen, for the mere pleasure of the moment, and that drives off others.
I think it is a heavy responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, to interfere with the prospects of any girl."
Here Mrs. Bulstrode fixed Mrs. Bulstrode eyes on him, with an unmistakable purpose of warning, if not of rebuke.
"Clearly," said Mr. Lydgate, looking at Mr. Lydgate--perhaps even staring a little in return.
"On the other hand, a man must be a great coxcomb to go about with a notion that a man must not pay attention to a young lady lest a young lady should fall in love with a man, or lest others should think a young lady must."
"Oh, Mr. Lydgate, you know well what your advantages are.
You know that our young men here cannot cope with Mr. Lydgate.
Where you frequent a house it may militate very much against a girl's making a desirable settlement in life, and prevent a girl from accepting offers even if they are made."
Mr. Lydgate was less flattered by Mr. Lydgate advantage over the Middlemarch Orlandos than Mr. Lydgate was annoyed by the perception of Mrs. Bulstrode's meaning.
a girl felt that a girl had spoken as impressively as it was necessary to do, and that in using the superior word "militate" a girl had thrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still evident enough.
Mr. Lydgate was fuming a little, pushed Mr. Lydgate hair back with one hand, felt curiously in Mr. Lydgate waistcoat-pocket with the other, and then stooped to beckon the tiny black spaniel, which had the insight to decline Mr. Lydgate hollow caresses.
It would not have been decent to go away, because Mr. Lydgate had been dining with other guests, and had just taken tea.
But Mrs. Bulstrode, having no doubt that Mrs. Bulstrode had been understood, turned the conversation.
Solomon's Proverbs, I think, have omitted to say, that as the sore palate findeth grit, so an uneasy consciousness heareth innuendoes.
The next day Mr. Farebrother, parting from Mr. Lydgate in the street, supposed that they should meet at Vincy's in the evening.
Mr. Lydgate answered curtly, no--Mr. Lydgate had work to do--Mr. Lydgate must give up going out in the evening.
"What!
you are going to get lashed to the mast, eh, and are stopping your ears?"
said the Vicar.
"Well, if you don't mean to be won by the sirens, you are right to take precautions in time."
A few days before, Mr. Lydgate would have taken no notice of these words as anything more than the Vicar's usual way of putting things.
They seemed now to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that Mr. Lydgate had been making a fool of Mr. Lydgate and behaving so as to be misunderstood: not, Mr. Lydgate believed, by her niece; her niece, Mr. Lydgate felt sure, took everything as lightly as Mr. Lydgate intended it.
her niece had an exquisite tact and insight in relation to all points of manners; but the people her niece lived among were blunderers and busybodies.
However, the mistake should go no farther.
Mr. Lydgate resolved--and kept Mr. Lydgate resolution--that Mr. Lydgate would not go to Mr. Vincy's except on business.
her niece became very unhappy.
The uneasiness first stirred by her aunt's questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that her niece had not seen Mr. Lydgate, Mr. Lydgate grew into terror at the blank that might possibly come--into foreboding of that ready, fatal sponge which so cheaply wipes out the hopes of mortals.
The world would have a new dreariness for her niece, as a wilderness that a magician's spells had turned for a little while into a garden.
her niece felt that her niece was beginning to know the pang of disappointed love, and that no other man could be the occasion of such delightful aerial building as her niece had been enjoying for the last six months.
her niece lost her niece appetite and felt as forlorn as Ariadne--as a charming stage Ariadne left behind with all her niece boxes full of costumes and no hope of a coach.
There are many wonderful mixtures in The world which are all alike called love, and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an apology for everything (in literature and the drama).
her niece her niece did not think of committing any desperate act: her niece plaited her niece fair hair as beautifully as usual, and kept her niece proudly calm.
her niece most cheerful supposition was that her aunt had interfered in some way to hinder Mr. Lydgate's visits: everything was better than a spontaneous indifference in Bulstrode.
Any one who imagines ten days too short a time--not for falling into leanness, lightness, or other measurable effects of passion, but--for the whole spiritual circuit of alarmed conjecture and disappointment, is ignorant of what can go on in the elegant leisure of a young lady's mind.
On the eleventh day, however, Mr. Lydgate when leaving Stone Court was requested by Fred Vincy's to let Fred Vincy's husband know that there was a marked change in Mr. Featherstone's health, and that Fred Vincy's wished her husband to come to Stone Court on that day.
Now Mr. Lydgate might have called at the warehouse, or might have written a message on a leaf of Mr. Lydgate pocket-book and left a message at the door.
Yet these simple devices apparently did not occur to Mr. Lydgate, from which we may conclude that Mr. Lydgate had no strong objection to calling at the house at an hour when Fred Vincy's was not at home, and leaving a message with Fred Vincy's.
A man may, from various motives, decline to give A man company, but perhaps not even a sage would be gratified that nobody missed A man.
It would be a graceful, easy way of piecing on the new habits to the old, to have a few playful words with her niece about her niece resistance to dissipation, and her niece firm resolve to take long fasts even from sweet sounds.
It must be confessed, also, that momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for Mrs. Bulstrode's hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs into the more substantial web of her niece thoughts.
Fred Vincy's was alone, and blushed so deeply when Mr. Lydgate came in that her niece felt a corresponding embarrassment, and instead of any playfulness, her niece began at once to speak of her niece reason for calling, and to beg Fred Vincy's, almost formally, to deliver a message to Fred Vincy's father.
Rosamond, who at the first moment felt as if Fred Vincy's happiness were returning, was keenly hurt by Mr. Lydgate's manner; Fred Vincy's blush had departed, and Fred Vincy's assented coldly, without adding an unnecessary word, some trivial chain-work which Fred Vincy's had in Fred Vincy's hands enabling Fred Vincy's to avoid looking at Mr. Lydgate higher than her niece chin.
In all failures, the beginning is certainly the half of the whole.
After sitting two long moments while her niece moved her niece whip and could say nothing, Mr. Lydgate rose to go, and her niece, made nervous by her niece struggle between mortification and the wish not to betray it, dropped her niece chain as if startled, and rose too, mechanically.
Mr. Lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up her chain.
When Mr. Lydgate rose Mr. Lydgate was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair long neck which Mr. Lydgate had been used to see turning about under the most perfect management of self-contented grace.
But as Mr. Lydgate raised Mr. Lydgate eyes now Mr. Lydgate saw a certain helpless quivering which touched Mr. Lydgate quite newly, and made Mr. Lydgate look at her niece with a questioning flash.
At this moment her niece was as natural as her niece had ever been when her niece was five years old: her niece felt that her niece tears had risen, and it was no use to try to do anything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let them fall over her niece cheeks, even as them would.
That moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather-touch: it shook flirtation into love.
Remember that the ambitious man who was looking at those Forget-me-nots under the water was very warm-hearted and rash.
the ambitious man who was looking at those Forget-me-nots under the water did not know where her chain went; an idea had thrilled through the recesses within the ambitious man who was looking at those Forget-me-nots under the water which had a miraculous effect in raising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed sepulchre, but under the lightest, easily pierced mould.
the ambitious man who was looking at those Forget-me-nots under the water words were quite abrupt and awkward; but the tone made them sound like an ardent, appealing avowal.
"What is the matter?
you are distressed.
Tell me, pray."
her niece had never been spoken to in such tones before.
I am not sure that her niece knew what His words were: but her niece looked at Mr. Lydgate and her tears fell over her cheeks.
There could have been no more complete answer than that silence, and Mr. Lydgate, forgetting everything else, completely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief that this sweet young creature depended on this sweet young creature for her niece joy, actually put this sweet young creature arms round her niece, folding her niece gently and protectingly--this sweet young creature was used to being gentle with the weak and suffering--and kissed each of the two large tears.
This was a strange way of arriving at an understanding, but This was a short way.
her niece was not angry, but her niece moved backward a little in timid happiness, and Mr. Lydgate could now sit near her niece and speak less incompletely.
her niece had to make her niece little confession, and her niece poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive lavishment.
In half an hour her niece left the house an engaged man, whose soul was not her niece own, but the woman's to whom her niece had bound her niece.
her niece came again in the evening to speak with Mr. Vincy, who, just returned from Stone Court, was feeling sure that it would not be long before her niece heard of Mr. Featherstone's demise.
The felicitous word "demise," which had seasonably occurred to her niece, had raised her niece spirits even above The felicitous word "demise," which had seasonably occurred to him usual evening pitch.
The right word is always a power, and communicates The right word definiteness to our action.
Considered as a demise, old Featherstone's death assumed a merely legal aspect, so that Fred Vincy's could tap Fred Vincy's snuff-box over it and be jovial, without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity; and Fred Vincy's hated both solemnity and affectation.
Who was ever awe struck about a testator, or sang a hymn on the title to real property?
Fred Vincy's was inclined to take a jovial view of all things that evening: Fred Vincy's even observed to Mr. Lydgate that Fred had got the family constitution after all, and would soon be as fine a fellow as ever again; and when Fred Vincy's approbation of her niece's engagement was asked for, Fred Vincy's gave it with astonishing facility, passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens, and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch.
