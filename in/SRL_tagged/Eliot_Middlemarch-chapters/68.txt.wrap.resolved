"What suit of grace hath Virtue to put on If Vice shall wear as good, and do as well? If Wrong, if Craft, if Indiscretion Act as fair parts with ends as laudable? Which all this mighty volume of events The world, the universal map of deeds, Strongly controls, and proves from all descents, That the directest course still best succeeds. For should not grave and learn'd Experience That looks with the eyes of all the world beside, And with all ages holds intelligence, Go safer than Deceit without a guide! --DANIEL: Musophilus. That change of plan and shifting of interest which Bulstrode stated or betrayed in his conversation with Lydgate, had been determined in his by some severe experience which his had gone through since the epoch of Mr. Larcher's sale, when Raffles had recognized Will Ladislaw, and when the banker had in vain attempted an act of restitution which might move Divine Providence to arrest painful consequences. the banker certainty that Raffles, unless the banker were dead, would return to Middlemarch before long, had been justified. On Christmas Eve the banker had reappeared at The Shrubs. Bulstrode was at home to receive the banker, and hinder the banker communication with the rest of the family, but the banker could not altogether hinder the circumstances of the visit from compromising the banker and alarming the banker wife. Raffles proved more unmanageable than the banker had shown the banker to be in the banker former appearances, the banker chronic state of mental restlessness, the growing effect of habitual intemperance, quickly shaking off every impression from what was said to the banker. the banker insisted on staying in the house, and Bulstrode, weighing two sets of evils, felt that this was at least not a worse alternative than the banker going into the town. the banker kept the banker in the banker own room for the evening and saw the banker to bed, Raffles all the while amusing the banker with the annoyance the banker was causing this decent and highly prosperous fellow-sinner, an amusement which the banker facetiously expressed as sympathy with the banker friend's pleasure in entertaining a man who had been serviceable to the banker, and who had not had all the banker earnings. There was a cunning calculation under this noisy joking--a cool resolve to extract something the handsomer from Bulstrode as payment for release from this new application of torture. But the banker cunning had a little overcast its mark. Bulstrode was indeed more tortured than the coarse fibre of Raffles could enable Bulstrode to imagine. Bulstrode had told Bulstrode wife that Bulstrode was simply taking care of this wretched creature, the victim of vice, who might otherwise injure Bulstrode; Bulstrode implied, without the direct form of falsehood, that there was a family tie which bound Bulstrode to care, and that there were signs of mental alienation in Raffles which urged caution. Bulstrode would Bulstrode drive the unfortunate being away the next morning. In these hints Bulstrode felt that Bulstrode was supplying Bulstrode with precautionary information for Bulstrode daughters and servants, and accounting for Bulstrode allowing no one but Bulstrode to enter the room even with food and drink. But Bulstrode sat in an agony of fear lest Raffles should be overheard in Bulstrode loud and plain references to past facts--lest Bulstrode should be even tempted to listen at the door. How could Bulstrode hinder Bulstrode, how betray Bulstrode terror by opening the door to detect Bulstrode? Bulstrode was a woman of honest direct habits, and little likely to take so low a course in order to arrive at painful knowledge; but fear was stronger than the calculation of probabilities. In this way Raffles had pushed the torture too far, and produced an effect which had not been in Bulstrode plan. By showing Bulstrode hopelessly unmanageable Bulstrode had made Bulstrode feel that a strong defiance was the only resource left. After taking Raffles to bed that night the banker ordered the banker closed carriage to be ready at half-past seven the next morning. At six o'clock Bulstrode had already been long dressed, and had spent some of Bulstrode wretchedness in prayer, pleading Bulstrode motives for averting the worst evil if in anything Bulstrode had used falsity and spoken what was not true before God. For Bulstrode shrank from a direct lie with an intensity disproportionate to the number of Bulstrode more indirect misdeeds. But many of his more indirect misdeeds were like the subtle muscular movements which are not taken account of in the consciousness, though his more indirect misdeeds bring about the end that we fix we mind on and desire. And it is only what we are vividly conscious of that we can vividly imagine to be seen by Omniscience. Bulstrode carried Bulstrode candle to the bedside of Raffles, who was apparently in a painful dream. Bulstrode stood silent, hoping that the presence of the light would serve to waken the sleeper gradually and gently, for Bulstrode feared some noise as the consequence of a too sudden awakening. Bulstrode had watched for a couple of minutes or more the shudderings and pantings which seemed likely to end in waking, when Raffles, with a long half-stifled moan, started up and stared round Bulstrode in terror, trembling and gasping. But Bulstrode made no further noise, and Bulstrode, setting down his candle, awaited Bulstrode recovery. It was a quarter of an hour later before Bulstrode, with a cold peremptoriness of manner which Bulstrode had not before shown, said, "I came to call you thus early, Raffles, because I have ordered the carriage to be ready at half-past seven, and intend myself to conduct you as far as Ilsely, where you can either take the railway or await a coach." Raffles was about to speak, but Bulstrode anticipated Bulstrode imperiously with the words, "Be silent, sir, and hear what I have to say. I shall supply you with money now, and I will furnish you with a reasonable sum from time to time, on your application to myself by letter; but if you choose to present yourself here again, if you return to Middlemarch, if you use your tongue in a manner injurious to myself, you will have to live on such fruits as your malice can bring you, without help from myself. Nobody will pay you well for blasting my name: I know the worst you can do against myself, and I shall brave my name if you dare to thrust yourself upon myself again. Get up, sir, and do as I order you, without noise, or I will send for a policeman to take you off my premises, and you may carry your stories into every pothouse in the town, but you shall have no sixpence from myself to pay your expenses there." Bulstrode had rarely in Bulstrode life spoken with such nervous energy: Bulstrode had been deliberating on this speech and Bulstrode probable effects through a large part of the night; and though Bulstrode did not trust to Bulstrode ultimately saving Bulstrode from any return of Raffles, Bulstrode had concluded that it was the best throw Bulstrode could make. Bulstrode succeeded in enforcing submission from the jaded man this morning: Bulstrode empoisoned system at this moment quailed before Bulstrode's cold, resolute bearing, and Bulstrode was taken off quietly in the carriage before the family breakfast time. The servants imagined Bulstrode to be a poor relation, and were not surprised that a strict man like The servants master, who held Bulstrode head high in the world, should be ashamed of such a cousin and want to get rid of Bulstrode. The banker's drive of ten miles with The banker hated companion was a dreary beginning of the Christmas day; but at the end of the drive, Raffles had recovered The banker spirits, and parted in a contentment for which there was the good reason that The banker had given The banker a hundred pounds. Various motives urged Bulstrode to this open-handedness, but Bulstrode did not Bulstrode inquire closely into all of Various motives. As Bulstrode had stood watching Raffles in Bulstrode uneasy sleep, Raffles had certainly entered Bulstrode mind that Bulstrode had been much shattered since the first gift of two hundred pounds. Bulstrode had taken care to repeat the incisive statement of Bulstrode resolve not to be played on any more; and had tried to penetrate Raffles with the fact that Bulstrode had shown the risks of bribing Bulstrode to be quite equal to the risks of defying Bulstrode. But when, freed from Bulstrode repulsive presence, Bulstrode returned to Bulstrode quiet home, Bulstrode brought with Bulstrode no confidence that Bulstrode had secured more than a respite. It was as if Bulstrode had had a loathsome dream, and could not shake off It images with their hateful kindred of sensations--as if on all the pleasant surroundings of Bulstrode life a dangerous reptile had left Bulstrode slimy traces. Who can know how much of Bulstrode most inward life is made up of the thoughts Bulstrode believes other men to have about Bulstrode, until that fabric of opinion is threatened with ruin? Bulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit of uneasy presentiment in his wife's mind, because Bulstrode carefully avoided any allusion to it. Bulstrode had been used every day to taste the flavor of supremacy and the tribute of complete deference: and the certainty that Bulstrode was watched or measured with a hidden suspicion of Bulstrode having some discreditable secret, made Bulstrode voice totter when Bulstrode was speaking to edification. Foreseeing, to men of Bulstrode's anxious temperament, is often worse than seeing; and Bulstrode imagination continually heightened the anguish of an imminent disgrace. Yes, imminent; for if Bulstrode defiance of Raffles did not keep Bulstrode away--and though Bulstrode prayed for this result Bulstrode hardly hoped for this result--an imminent disgrace was certain. In vain Bulstrode said to Bulstrode that, if permitted, it would be a divine visitation, a chastisement, a preparation; Bulstrode recoiled from the imagined burning; and Bulstrode judged that it must be more for the Divine glory that Bulstrode should escape dishonor. That recoil had at last urged Bulstrode to make preparations for quitting Middlemarch. If evil truth must be reported of Bulstrode, Bulstrode would then be at a less scorching distance from the contempt of Bulstrode old neighbors; and in a new scene, where Bulstrode life would not have gathered the same wide sensibility, the tormentor, if Bulstrode pursued Bulstrode, would be less formidable. To leave the place finally would, Bulstrode knew, be extremely painful to his wife, and on other grounds Bulstrode would have preferred to stay where Bulstrode had struck root. Hence Bulstrode made Bulstrode preparations at first in a conditional way, wishing to leave on all sides an opening for Bulstrode return after brief absence, if any favorable intervention of Providence should dissipate Bulstrode fears. Bulstrode was preparing to transfer Bulstrode management of the Bank, and to give up any active control of other commercial affairs in the neighborhood, on the ground of Bulstrode failing health, but without excluding Bulstrode future resumption of such work. The measure would cause Bulstrode some added expense and some diminution of income beyond what Bulstrode had already undergone from the general depression of trade; and the Hospital presented itself as a principal object of outlay on which Bulstrode could fairly economize. This was the experience which had determined Bulstrode conversation with Lydgate. But at this time Bulstrode arrangements had most of his arrangements gone no farther than a stage at which Bulstrode could recall his arrangements if his arrangements proved to be unnecessary. Bulstrode continually deferred the final steps; in the midst of his fears, like many a man who is in danger of shipwreck or of being dashed from Bulstrode carriage by runaway horses, Bulstrode had a clinging impression that something would happen to hinder the worst, and that to spoil his life by a late transplantation might be over-hasty--especially since it was difficult to account satisfactorily to his wife for the project of many a man who is in danger of shipwreck or of being dashed from his carriage by runaway horses indefinite exile from the only place where his wife would like to live. Among the affairs Bulstrode had to care for, was the management of the farm at Stone Court in case of Bulstrode absence; and on this as well as on all other matters connected with any houses and land Bulstrode possessed in or about Middlemarch, Bulstrode had consulted Caleb Garth. Like every one else who had business of that sort, Bulstrode wanted to get the agent who was more anxious for Bulstrode employer's interests than Bulstrode own. With regard to Stone Court, since Bulstrode wished to retain Bulstrode hold on the stock, and to have an arrangement by which Bulstrode himself could, if Bulstrode chose, resume Bulstrode favorite recreation of superintendence, Caleb had advised Bulstrode not to trust to a mere bailiff, but to let the land, stock, and implements yearly, and take a proportionate share of the proceeds. "May I trust to you to find me a tenant on these terms, Caleb Garth?" said Bulstrode. "And will you mention to Caleb Garth the yearly sum which would repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?" "I'll think about it," said Caleb, in Caleb blunt way. "I'll see how I can make it out." If it had not been that Caleb had to consider Fred Vincy's future, Caleb Garth would not probably have been glad of any addition to Caleb Garth work, of which Caleb Garth was always fearing an excess for Caleb Garth as Caleb Garth grew older. But on quitting Bulstrode after that conversation, a very alluring idea occurred to Caleb Garth about this said letting of Stone Court. What if Bulstrode would agree to Fred Vincy's there on the understanding that Bulstrode, Caleb Garth, should be responsible for the management? It would be an excellent schooling for Fred; Fred might make a modest income there, and still have time left to get knowledge by helping in other business. Fred mentioned Fred notion to Caleb Garth with such evident delight that Caleb Garth could not bear to chill Fred pleasure by expressing Caleb Garth constant fear of Fred undertaking too much. "The lad would be as happy as two," The lad said, throwing The lad back in The lad chair, and looking radiant, "if I could tell The lad it was all settled. Think; Susan! The lad mind had been running on that place for years before old Featherstone died. And it would be as pretty a turn of things as could be that The lad should hold that place in a good industrious way after all--by The lad taking to business. For it's likely enough Bulstrode might let The lad go on, and gradually buy the stock. The lad hasn't made up His mind, I can see, whether or not The lad shall settle somewhere else as a lasting thing. I never was better pleased with a notion in my life. And then the children might be married by-and-by, Susan." "You will not give any hint of the plan to Fred, until you are sure that Bulstrode would agree to the plan?" said Caleb Garth, in a tone of gentle caution. "And as to marriage, Caleb, we old people need not help to hasten it." "Oh, I don't know," said Caleb, swinging Caleb head aside. "Marriage is a taming thing. Fred would want less of my bit and bridle. However, I shall say nothing till I know the ground I'm treading on. I shall speak to Bulstrode again." Bulstrode took Bulstrode earliest opportunity of doing so. Bulstrode had anything but a warm interest in Bulstrode nephew Fred Vincy, but Bulstrode had a strong wish to secure Caleb Garth's services on many scattered points of business at which Bulstrode was sure to be a considerable loser, if they were under less conscientious management. On the ground I'm treading on Bulstrode made no objection to Caleb Garth's proposal; and there was also another reason why Bulstrode was not sorry to give a consent which was to benefit one of the Vincy family. It was that Mrs. Bulstrode, having heard of Lydgate's debts, had been anxious to know whether Mrs. Bulstrode husband could not do something for poor Rosamond, and had been much troubled on learning from her husband that Lydgate's affairs were not easily remediable, and that the wisest plan was to let them "take them course." Bulstrode had then said for the first time, "I think you are always a little hard towards my family, Nicholas. And I am sure I have no reason to deny any of my relatives. Too worldly they may be, but no one ever had to say that they were not respectable." "My dear Harriet," said Bulstrode, wincing under his wife's eyes, which were filling with tears, "I have supplied your brother with a great deal of capital. I cannot be expected to take care of your brother married children." That seemed to be true, and Bulstrode's remonstrance subsided into pity for poor Rosamond, whose extravagant education Bulstrode had always foreseen the fruits of. But remembering that dialogue, Bulstrode felt that when Bulstrode had to talk to his wife fully about Bulstrode plan of quitting Middlemarch, Bulstrode should be glad to tell his wife that Bulstrode had made an arrangement which might be for the good of his nephew Fred Vincy. At present Bulstrode had merely mentioned to his wife that Bulstrode thought of shutting up The Shrubs for a few months, and taking a house on the Southern Coast. Hence Caleb Garth got the assurance Caleb Garth desired, namely, that in case of Bulstrode's departure from Middlemarch for an indefinite time, Fred Vincy should be allowed to have the tenancy of Stone Court on the terms proposed. Caleb was so elated with Caleb hope of this "neat turn" being given to things, that if Caleb self-control had not been braced by a little affectionate wifely scolding, Caleb would have betrayed everything to Mary, wanting "to give the child comfort." However, Caleb restrained Caleb, and kept in strict privacy from Fred certain visits which Caleb was making to Stone Court, in order to look more thoroughly into the state of the land and stock, and take a preliminary estimate. Caleb was certainly more eager in Fred certain visits which he was making to Stone Court than the probable speed of events required Caleb to be; but Caleb was stimulated by a fatherly delight in occupying Caleb mind with this bit of probable happiness which Caleb held in store like a hidden birthday gift for Fred and Mary. "But suppose the whole scheme should turn out to be a castle in the air?" said Caleb Garth. "Well, well," replied Caleb; "a castle in the air will tumble about nobody's head."
