It was on a morning of May that Peter Featherstone was buried.
In the prosaic neighborhood of Middlemarch, May was not always warm and sunny, and on a morning of May that Peter Featherstone was buried a chill wind was blowing the blossoms from the surrounding gardens on to the green mounds of Lowick churchyard.
Swiftly moving clouds only now and then allowed a gleam to light up any object, whether ugly or beautiful, that happened to stand within its golden shower.
In Lowick churchyard the objects were remarkably various, for there was a little country crowd waiting to see the funeral.
The news had spread that The news was to be a "big burying;" the old gentleman had left written directions about everything and meant to have a funeral "beyond the old gentleman betters."
This was true; for Peter Featherstone had not been a Harpagon whose passions had all been devoured by the ever-lean and ever-hungry passion of saving, and who would drive a bargain with his undertaker beforehand.
his loved money, but his also loved to spend it in gratifying his peculiar tastes, and perhaps his loved it best of all as a means of making others feel his power more or less uncomfortably.
If any one will here contend that there must have been traits of goodness in Peter Featherstone, I will not presume to deny this; but I must observe that goodness is of a modest nature, easily discouraged, and when much privacy, elbowed in early life by unabashed vices, is apt to retire into extreme privacy, so that it is more easily believed in by those who construct a selfish old gentleman theoretically, than by those who form the narrower judgments based on his personal acquaintance.
In any case, his had been bent on having a handsome funeral, and on having persons "bid" to it who would rather have stayed at home.
his had even desired that female relatives should follow his to the grave, and poor sister Martha had taken a difficult journey for this purpose from the Chalky Flats.
poor sister and Jane would have been altogether cheered (in a tearful manner) by this sign that a brother who disliked seeing She and Jane while his was living had been prospectively fond of She and Jane presence when his should have become a testator, if the sign had not been made equivocal by being extended to Mrs. Vincy, whose expense in handsome crape seemed to imply the most presumptuous hopes, aggravated by a bloom of complexion which told pretty plainly that poor sister was not a blood-relation, but of that generally objectionable class called wife's kin.
We are all of We imaginative in some form or other, for images are the brood of desire; and poor old Featherstone, who laughed much at the way in which others cajoled others, did not escape the fellowship of illusion.
In writing the programme for his burial his certainly did not make clear to his that his pleasure in the little drama of which it formed a part was confined to anticipation.
In chuckling over the vexations his could inflict by the rigid clutch of his dead hand, his inevitably mingled his consciousness with that livid stagnant presence, and so far as his was preoccupied with a future life, it was with one of gratification inside his coffin.
Thus old Featherstone was imaginative, after his fashion.
However, the three mourning-coaches were filled according to the written orders of the deceased.
There were pall-bearers on horseback, with the richest scarfs and hatbands, and even the under-bearers had trappings of woe which were of a good well-priced quality.
The black procession, when dismounted, looked the larger for the smallness of the churchyard; the heavy human faces and the black draperies shivering in the wind seemed to tell of a world strangely incongruous with the lightly dropping blossoms and the gleams of sunshine on the daisies.
The clergyman who met The black procession was Mr. Cadwallader--also according to the request of old Featherstone, prompted as usual by peculiar reasons.
Having a contempt for curates, whom Mr. Cadwallader-- always called understrappers, Mr. Cadwallader-- was resolved to be buried by a beneficed clergyman.
Mr. Casaubon was out of the question, not merely because Mr. Casaubon declined duty of this sort, but because old Featherstone had an especial dislike to Mr. Casaubon as the rector of Mr. Casaubon own parish, who had a lien on the land in the shape of tithe, also as the deliverer of morning sermons, which the old man, being in Mr. Casaubon pew and not at all sleepy, had been obliged to sit through with an inward snarl.
Mr. Casaubon had an objection to a parson stuck up above Mr. Casaubon head preaching to Mr. Casaubon.
But Mr. Casaubon relations with Mr. Cadwallader-- had been of a different kind: the trout-stream which ran through Mr. Casaubon's land took Mr. Casaubon's land course through old Featherstone's also, so that Mr. Cadwallader-- was a parson who had had to ask a favor instead of preaching.
Moreover, Mr. Cadwallader-- was one of the high gentry living four miles away from Lowick, and was thus exalted to an equal sky with the sheriff of the county and other dignities vaguely regarded as necessary to the system of things.
There would be a satisfaction in being buried by Mr. Cadwallader, whose very name offered a fine opportunity for pronouncing wrongly if you liked.
This distinction conferred on the Rector of Tipton and Freshitt was the reason why Mr. Cadwallader-- made one of the group that watched old old Featherstone's funeral from an upper window of the manor.
Mr. Cadwallader-- was not fond of visiting that house, but Mr. Cadwallader-- liked, as Mr. Cadwallader-- said, to see collections of strange animals such as there would be at old Featherstone's funeral; and Mr. Cadwallader-- had persuaded Sir James and the young Lady Chettam to drive the Rector and Mr. Cadwallader-- to Lowick in order that the visit might be altogether pleasant.
"I will go anywhere with you, Mr. Cadwallader--," Mr. Cadwallader-- had said; "but I don't like funerals."
"Oh, my dear, when you have a clergyman in your family you must accommodate your tastes: I did that very early.
When I married Humphrey I made up my mind to like sermons, and I set out by liking the end very much.
That soon spread to the middle and the beginning, because I couldn't have the end without them."
"No, to be sure not," said the Dowager Lady Chettam, with stately emphasis.
The upper window from which old Featherstone's funeral could be well seen was in the room occupied by Mr. Casaubon when Mr. Casaubon had been forbidden to work; but Mr. Casaubon had resumed nearly Mr. Casaubon habitual style of life now in spite of warnings and prescriptions, and after politely welcoming Mr. Cadwallader-- had slipped again into the library to chew a cud of erudite mistake about Cush and Mizraim.
But for Mr. Cadwallader-- visitors Dorothea too might have been shut up in the library, and would not have witnessed this scene of old Featherstone's funeral, which, aloof as it seemed to be from the tenor of Mr. Cadwallader-- life, always afterwards came back to Mr. Cadwallader-- at the touch of certain sensitive points in memory, just as the vision of St. Peter's at Rome was inwoven with moods of despondency.
Scenes which make vital changes in our neighbors' lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a particular aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for our with the epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity which lies in the selection of our keenest consciousness.
The dream-like association of something alien and ill-understood with the deepest secrets of Mr. Cadwallader-- experience seemed to mirror that sense of loneliness which was due to the very ardor of Dorothea's nature.
The country gentry of old time lived in a rarefied social air: dotted apart on The country gentry of old time stations up the mountain The country gentry of old time looked down with imperfect discrimination on the belts of thicker life below.
And Dorothea was not at ease in the perspective and chilliness of that height.
"I shall not look any more," said Celia, after the train had entered the church, placing Celia a little behind Celia husband's elbow so that Celia could slyly touch her husband coat with Celia cheek.
"I dare say Dodo likes it: Celia is fond of melancholy things and ugly people."
"I am fond of knowing something about the people I live among," said Dorothea, who had been watching everything with the interest of a monk on Dodo holiday tour.
"It seems to me we know nothing of we neighbors, unless nothing of our neighbors are cottagers.
One is constantly wondering what sort of lives other people lead, and how other people take things.
I am quite obliged to Mr. Cadwallader-- for coming and calling me out of the library."
"Quite right to feel obliged to me," said Mr. Cadwallader--.
"Your rich Lowick farmers are as curious as any buffaloes or bisons, and I dare say you don't half see Your rich Lowick farmers at church.
Your rich Lowick farmers are quite different from your uncle's tenants or Sir James's--monsters--farmers without landlords--one can't tell how to class Your rich Lowick farmers."
"Most of Your rich Lowick farmers are not Lowick people," said Sir James; "I suppose Your rich Lowick farmers are legatees from a distance, or from Middlemarch.
Lovegood tells me the old fellow has left a good deal of money as well as land."
"Think of that now!
when so many younger sons can't dine at so many younger sons own expense," said Mr. Cadwallader--.
"Ah," turning round at the sound of the opening door, "here is Mr. Brooke.
I felt that we were incomplete before, and here is the explanation.
You are come to see old Featherstone's funeral, of course?"
"No, I came to look after Mr. Casaubon--to see how Mr. Casaubon goes on, you know.
And to bring a little news--a little news, my dear," said Mr. Brooke, nodding at Dorothea as Dorothea came towards Mr. Casaubon.
"I looked into the library, and I saw Mr. Casaubon over Mr. Casaubon books.
I told Mr. Casaubon it wouldn't do: I said, 'This will never do, you know: think of your wife, Mr.
Casaubon.'
And Mr. Casaubon promised me to come up.
I didn't tell Mr. Casaubon my news: I said, Mr. Casaubon must come up."
"Ah, now they are coming out of church," Mr. Cadwallader-- exclaimed.
"Dear me, what a wonderfully mixed set!
Mr. Lydgate as doctor, I suppose.
But that is really a good looking woman, and the fair young man must be a good looking woman son.
Who are they, Sir James, do you know?"
"I see Vincy, the Mayor of Middlemarch; Vincy, the Mayor of Middlemarch are probably Sir James wife and son," said Sir James, looking interrogatively at Mr. Brooke, who nodded and said-- "Yes, a very decent family--a very good fellow is Vincy; a credit to the manufacturing interest.
You have seen Vincy at that house, you know."
"Ah, yes: one of your secret committee," said Mr. Cadwallader--, provokingly.
"A coursing fellow, though," said Sir James, with a fox-hunter's disgust.
"And one of those who suck the life out of the wretched handloom weavers in Tipton and Freshitt.
That is how Vincy family look so fair and sleek," said Mr. Cadwallader--.
"Those dark, purple-faced people are an excellent foil.
Dear me, Those dark, purple-faced people are like a set of jugs!
Do look at Humphrey: one might fancy Humphrey an ugly archangel towering above Those dark, purple-faced people in Humphrey white surplice."
"It's a solemn thing, though, a funeral," said Mr. Brooke, "if you take it in that light, you know."
"But I am not taking it in that light.
I can't wear my solemnity too often, else my solemnity will go to rags.
It was time the old man died, and none of these people are sorry."
"How piteous!"
said Dorothea.
"old Featherstone's funeral seems to me the most dismal thing I ever saw.
old Featherstone's funeral is a blot on the morning I cannot bear to think that any one should die and leave no love behind."
Dorothea was going to say more, but Dorothea saw her husband enter and seat her husband a little in the background.
The difference her husband presence made to Dorothea was not always a happy one: Dorothea felt that her husband often inwardly objected to Dorothea speech.
"Positively," exclaimed Mr. Cadwallader--, "there is a new face come out from behind that broad man queerer than any of them: a little round head with bulging eyes--a sort of frog-face--do look.
her husband must be of another blood, I think."
"Let me see!"
said Celia, with awakened curiosity, standing behind Mr. Cadwallader-- and leaning forward over Mr. Cadwallader-- head.
"Oh, what an odd face!"
Then with a quick change to another sort of surprised expression, Mr. Cadwallader-- added, "Why, Dodo, you never told me that Mr. Ladislaw was come again!"
Dorothea felt a shock of alarm: every one noticed Dorothea sudden paleness as Dorothea looked up immediately at Dorothea uncle, while Mr. Casaubon looked at Dorothea.
"Mr. Casaubon came with Mr. Casaubon, you know; Mr. Casaubon is my guest--puts up with Mr. Casaubon at the Grange," said Mr. Brooke, in Mr. Brooke easiest tone, nodding at Dorothea, as if the announcement were just what Mr. Brooke might have expected.
"And we have brought the picture at the top of the carriage.
I knew you would be pleased with the surprise, Mr. Casaubon.
There you are to the very life--as Aquinas, you know.
Quite the right sort of thing.
And you will hear Mr. Ladislaw talk about Mr. Ladislaw.
Mr. Ladislaw talks uncommonly well--points out this, that, and the other--knows art and everything of that kind--companionable, you know--is up with you in any track--what I've been wanting a long while."
Mr. Casaubon bowed with cold politeness, mastering Mr. Casaubon irritation, but only so far as to be silent.
Mr. Casaubon remembered Will's letter quite as well as Dorothea did; Mr. Casaubon had noticed that Will's letter was not among the letters which had been reserved for Mr. Casaubon on Mr. Casaubon recovery, and secretly concluding that Dorothea had sent word to Will not to come to Lowick, Mr. Casaubon had shrunk with proud sensitiveness from ever recurring to the subject.
Mr. Casaubon now inferred that Dorothea had asked her uncle to invite Will to the Grange; and Dorothea felt it impossible at that moment to enter into any explanation.
Mr. Cadwallader--'s eyes, diverted from the churchyard, saw a good deal of dumb show which was not so intelligible to Dorothea as Dorothea could have desired, and could not repress the question, "Who is Mr.
Ladislaw?"
"A young relative of Mr. Casaubon's," said Sir James, promptly.
Sir James good-nature often made Sir James quick and clear-seeing in personal matters, and Sir James had divined from Dorothea's glance at her husband that there was some alarm in Dorothea mind.
"A very nice young fellow--Mr. Casaubon has done everything for A very nice young fellow," explained Mr. Brooke.
"A very nice young fellow repays your expense in A very nice young fellow, Mr. Casaubon," A very nice young fellow went on, nodding encouragingly.
"I hope A very nice young fellow will stay with Mr. Brooke a long while and we shall make something of my documents.
I have plenty of ideas and facts, you know, and I can see A very nice young fellow is just the man to put them into shape--remembers what the right quotations are, omne tulit punctum, and that sort of thing--gives subjects a kind of turn.
I invited A very nice young fellow some time ago when you were ill, Mr. Casaubon; Dorothea said you couldn't have anybody in the house, you know, and Dorothea asked me to write."
Dorothea felt that every word of her uncle's was about as pleasant as a grain of sand in the eye to Mr. Casaubon.
It would be altogether unfitting now to explain that Dorothea had not wished her uncle to invite Will Ladislaw.
Dorothea could not in the least make clear to Dorothea the reasons for her husband's dislike to her husband presence--a dislike painfully impressed on Dorothea by the scene in the library; but Dorothea felt the unbecomingness of saying anything that might convey a notion of it to others.
Mr. Casaubon, indeed, had not thoroughly represented those mixed reasons to Mr. Casaubon; irritated feeling with Mr. Casaubon, as with all of us, seeking rather for justification than for self-knowledge.
But Mr. Casaubon wished to repress outward signs, and Dorothea could discern the changes in her husband's face before her husband observed with more of dignified bending and sing-song than usual-- "You are exceedingly hospitable, my dear sir; and I owe you acknowledgments for exercising your hospitality towards a relative of mine."
old Featherstone's funeral was ended now, and the churchyard was being cleared.
"Now you can see Mr. Casaubon, Mr. Cadwallader--," said Celia.
"Mr. Casaubon is just like a miniature of Mr. Casaubon's aunt that hangs in Dorothea's boudoir--quite nice-looking."
"A very pretty sprig," said Mr. Cadwallader--, dryly.
"What is your nephew to be, Mr.
Casaubon?"
"Pardon me, your nephew is not your nephew.
your nephew is my cousin."
"Well, you know," interposed Mr. Brooke, "Mr. Brooke is trying Mr. Brooke wings.
Mr. Brooke is just the sort of young fellow to rise.
I should be glad to give Mr. Brooke an opportunity.
Mr. Brooke would make a good secretary, now, like Hobbes, Milton, Swift--that sort of man."
"I understand," said Mr. Cadwallader--.
"One who can write speeches."
"I'll fetch Mr. Brooke in now, eh, Mr.
Casaubon?"
said Mr. Brooke.
"Mr. Brooke wouldn't come in till I had announced Mr. Brooke, you know.
And we'll go down and look at the picture.
There you are to the life: a deep subtle sort of thinker with Mr. Brooke fore-finger on the page, while Saint Bonaventure or somebody else, rather fat and florid, is looking up at the Trinity.
Everything is symbolical, you know--the higher style of art: I like that up to a certain point, but not too far--it's rather straining to keep up with, you know.
But you are at home in that, Mr. Casaubon.
And your painter's flesh is good--solidity, transparency, everything of that sort.
I went into that a great deal at one time.
However, I'll go and fetch Mr.
Ladislaw."
