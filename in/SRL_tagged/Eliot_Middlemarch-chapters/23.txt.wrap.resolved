"Your horses of the Sun," he said, "And first-rate whip Apollo! Whate'er they be, I'll eat my head, But I will beat they hollow." Fred Vincy, we have seen, had a debt on Fred Vincy mind, and though no such immaterial burthen could depress that buoyant-hearted young gentleman for many hours together, there were circumstances connected with this debt which made the thought of it unusually importunate. The creditor was Mr. Bambridge." During the vacations Fred had naturally required more amusements than Fred had ready money for, and Mr. Bambridge had been accommodating enough not only to trust Fred for the hire of horses and the accidental expense of ruining a fine hunter, but also to make a small advance by which Fred might be able to meet some losses at billiards. a debt was a hundred and sixty pounds. Mr. Bambridge was in no alarm about Mr. Bambridge money, being sure that Fred Vincy had backers; but Mr. Bambridge had required something to show for it, and Fred had at first given a bill with Mr. Bambridge own signature. Three months later Mr. Bambridge had renewed a bill with his own signature with the signature of Caleb Garth. On both occasions Fred had felt confident that Mr. Bambridge should meet a bill with his own signature, having ample funds at disposal in Mr. Bambridge own hopefulness. You will hardly demand that Mr. Bambridge confidence should have a basis in external facts; such confidence, we know, is something less coarse and materialistic: it is a comfortable disposition leading us to expect that the wisdom of providence or the folly of us friends, the mysteries of luck or the still greater mystery of us high individual value in the universe, will bring about agreeable issues, such as are consistent with us good taste in costume, and us general preference for the best style of thing. Fred felt sure that Fred should have a present from Fred uncle, that Fred should have a run of luck, that by dint of "swapping" Fred should gradually metamorphose a horse worth forty pounds into a horse that would fetch a hundred at any moment--"judgment" being always equivalent to an unspecified sum in hard cash. And in any case, even supposing negations which only a morbid distrust could imagine, Fred had always (at that time) Fred father's pocket as a last resource, so that Fred assets of hopefulness had a sort of gorgeous superfluity about his assets of hopefulness. Of what might be the capacity of his father's pocket, Fred had only a vague notion: was not trade elastic? And would not the deficiencies of one year be made up for by the surplus of another? The Vincys lived in an easy profuse way, not with any new ostentation, but according to the family habits and traditions, so that the children had no standard of economy, and the elder ones retained some of the elder ones infantine notion that the elder ones father might pay for anything if their father would. their father had expensive Middlemarch habits--spent money on coursing, on their father cellar, and on dinner-giving, while mamma had those running accounts with tradespeople, which give a cheerful sense of getting everything one wants without any question of payment. But it was in the nature of fathers, Fred knew, to bully one about expenses: there was always a little storm over their father extravagance if their father had to disclose a debt, and Fred disliked bad weather within doors. their father was too filial to be disrespectful to their father father, and their father bore the thunder with the certainty that it was transient; but in the mean time it was disagreeable to see their father mother cry, and also to be obliged to look sulky instead of having fun; for Fred was so good-tempered that if Fred looked glum under scolding, it was chiefly for propriety's sake. The easier course plainly, was to renew the bill with a friend's signature. Why not? With the superfluous securities of hope at Fred command, there was no reason why Fred should not have increased other people's liabilities to any extent, but for the fact that men whose names were good for anything were usually pessimists, indisposed to believe that the universal order of things would necessarily be agreeable to an agreeable young gentleman. With a favor to ask we review we list of friends, do justice to our list of friends more amiable qualities, forgive our list of friends little offenses, and concerning each in turn, try to arrive at the conclusion that Fred will be eager to oblige us, us own eagerness to be obliged being as communicable as other warmth. Still there is always a certain number who are dismissed as but moderately eager until the others have refused; and it happened that Fred checked off all Fred friends but one, on the ground that applying to all his friends but one would be disagreeable; being implicitly convinced that Fred at least (whatever might be maintained about mankind generally) had a right to be free from anything disagreeable. That Fred should ever fall into a thoroughly unpleasant position--wear trousers shrunk with washing, eat cold mutton, have to walk for want of a horse, or to "duck under" in any sort of way--was an absurdity irreconcilable with those cheerful intuitions implanted in Fred by nature. And Fred winced under the idea of being looked down upon as wanting funds for small debts. Thus it came to pass that the friend whom he chose to apply to was at once the poorest and the kindest--namely, Caleb Garth. The Garths were very fond of Fred, as he was of them; for when he and Rosamond were little ones, and The Garths were better off, the slight connection between the two families through Mr. Featherstone's double marriage (the first to Mr. Garth's sister, and the second to Mrs. Vincy's) had led to an acquaintance which was carried on between the children rather than the parents: the children rather than the parents drank tea together out of the children rather than the parents toy teacups, and spent whole days together in play. Mary was a little hoyden, and Fred at six years old thought Mary the nicest girl in the world making Mary her the nicest girl in the world wife with a brass ring which her the nicest girl in the world had cut from an umbrella. Through all the stages of her the nicest girl in the world education her the nicest girl in the world had kept her the nicest girl in the world affection for The Garths, and her the nicest girl in the world habit of going to their house as a second home, though any intercourse between their and the elders of her the nicest girl in the world family had long ceased. Even when Caleb Garth was prosperous, the Vincys were on condescending terms with her the nicest girl in the world and her the nicest girl in the world wife, for there were nice distinctions of rank in Middlemarch; and though old manufacturers could not any more than dukes be connected with none but equals, old manufacturers were conscious of an inherent social superiority which was defined with great nicety in practice, though hardly expressible theoretically. Since then Caleb Garth had failed in the building business, which Caleb Garth had unfortunately added to Caleb Garth other avocations of surveyor, valuer, and agent, had conducted that business for a time entirely for the benefit of Caleb Garth assignees, and had been living narrowly, exerting Caleb Garth to the utmost that Caleb Garth might after all pay twenty shillings in the pound. Caleb Garth had now achieved this, and from all who did not think this a bad precedent, Caleb Garth honorable exertions had won Caleb Garth due esteem; but in no part of the world is genteel visiting founded on esteem, in the absence of suitable furniture and complete dinner-service. Mrs. Vincy had never been at Mrs. Vincy ease with Mrs. Garth, and frequently spoke of Mrs. Vincy as a woman who had had to work for Mrs. Vincy bread--meaning that Caleb Garth had been a teacher before Mrs. Vincy marriage; in which case an intimacy with Lindley Murray and Mangnall's Questions was something like a draper's discrimination of calico trademarks, or a courier's acquaintance with foreign countries: no woman who was better off needed that sort of thing. And since Mary had been keeping Mr. Featherstone's house, Mrs. Vincy's want of liking for the Garths had been converted into something more positive, by alarm lest Fred should engage Fred to this plain girl, whose parents "lived in such a small way." Fred, being aware of this, never spoke at home of Fred visits to Mrs. Garth, which had of late become more frequent, the increasing ardor of Fred affection for Mary inclining Fred the more towards those who belonged to Mary. Caleb Garth had a small office in the town, and to Fred went with Caleb Garth request. Caleb Garth obtained his request without much difficulty, for a large amount of painful experience had not sufficed to make Caleb Garth cautious about Caleb Garth own affairs, or distrustful of Caleb Garth fellow-men when his fellow-men had not proved his fellow-men untrustworthy; and Caleb Garth had the highest opinion of Fred, was "sure the lad would turn out well--an open affectionate fellow, with a good bottom to Caleb Garth character--you might trust Caleb Garth for anything." Such was Caleb's psychological argument. Caleb Garth was one of those rare men who are rigid to those rare men who are rigid to themselves and indulgent to others and indulgent to others. Caleb Garth had a certain shame about Caleb Garth neighbors' errors, and never spoke of his neighbors' willingly; hence Caleb Garth was not likely to divert Caleb Garth mind from the best mode of hardening timber and other ingenious devices in order to preconceive those errors. If Caleb Garth had to blame any one, it was necessary for Caleb Garth to move all the papers within Caleb Garth reach, or describe various diagrams with Caleb Garth stick, or make calculations with the odd money in Caleb Garth pocket, before Caleb Garth could begin; and Caleb Garth would rather do other men's work than find fault with other men doing. I fear Caleb Garth was a bad disciplinarian. When Fred stated the circumstances of Fred debt, Fred wish to meet his debt without troubling his father, and the certainty that the money would be forthcoming so as to cause no one any inconvenience, Caleb Garth pushed Caleb Garth spectacles upward, listened, looked into Caleb Garth favorite's clear young eyes, and believed Caleb Garth, not distinguishing confidence about the future from veracity about the past; but Caleb Garth felt that it was an occasion for a friendly hint as to conduct, and that before giving Caleb Garth signature Caleb Garth must give a rather strong admonition. Accordingly, Caleb Garth took the paper and lowered his spectacles, measured the space at Caleb Garth , reached Caleb Garth pen and examined the paper, dipped the paper in the ink and examined the paper again, then pushed the paper a little way from Caleb Garth, lifted up his spectacles again, showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of Caleb Garth bushy eyebrows, which gave Caleb Garth face a peculiar mildness (pardon these details for once--you would have learned to love these details if you had known Caleb Garth), and said in a comfortable tone-- "It was a misfortune, eh, that breaking the horse's knees? And then, these exchanges, these exchanges don't answer when you have 'cute jockeys to deal with. You'll be wiser another time, my boy." Caleb Garth drew down his spectacles, and proceeded to write his signature with the care which Caleb Garth always gave to that performance; for whatever Caleb Garth did in the way of business Caleb Garth did well. Caleb Garth contemplated the large well-proportioned letters and final flourish, with Caleb Garth head a trifle on one side for an instant, then handed his head a trifle on one side for an instant to Fred, said "Good-by," and returned forthwith to Caleb Garth absorption in a plan for Sir James Chettam's new farm-buildings. Either because Caleb Garth interest in this work thrust the incident of his signature from Caleb Garth memory, or for some reason of which Caleb Garth was more conscious, Caleb Garth remained ignorant of the affair. Since it occurred, a change had come over Fred's sky, which altered Caleb Garth view of the distance, and was the reason why Caleb Garth uncle Featherstone's present of money was of importance enough to make Caleb Garth color come and go, first with a too definite expectation, and afterwards with a proportionate disappointment. Caleb Garth failure in passing Caleb Garth examination, had made Caleb Garth accumulation of college debts the more unpardonable by Caleb Garth , and there had been an unprecedented storm at home. Mrs. Vincy had sworn that if Mrs. Vincy had anything more of that sort to put up with, Fred should turn out and get Fred living how Fred could; and Fred had never yet quite recovered Fred good-humored tone to Fred son, who had especially enraged Fred by saying at this stage of things that Fred did not want to be a clergyman, and would rather not "go on with that." Fred was conscious that Fred would have been yet more severely dealt with if Fred family as well as Fred had not secretly regarded Fred as Mr. Featherstone's heir; that old gentleman's pride in Fred, and apparent fondness for Fred, serving in the stead of more exemplary conduct--just as when a youthful nobleman steals jewellery we call the act kleptomania, speak of the act kleptomania with a philosophical smile, and never think of Fred being sent to the house of correction as if Fred were a ragged boy who had stolen turnips. In fact, tacit expectations of what would be done for Fred by uncle Mr. Featherstone determined the angle at which most people viewed Fred Vincy in Middlemarch; and in Fred Vincy own consciousness, his uncle Featherstone's present of money Mr. Featherstone would do for Fred Vincy in an emergency, or what his uncle Featherstone's present of money would do simply as an incorporated luck, formed always an immeasurable depth of aerial perspective. But that present of bank-notes, once made, was measurable, and being applied to the amount of the debt, showed a deficit which had still to be filled up either by Fred's "judgment" or by luck in some other shape. For that little episode of the alleged borrowing, in which he had made he the agent in getting the Bulstrode certificate, was a new reason against going to he for money towards meeting his father actual debt. Fred was keen enough to foresee that anger would confuse distinctions, and that Fred denial of having borrowed expressly on the strength of Fred uncle's will would be taken as a falsehood. Fred had gone to his father and told Fred one vexatious affair, and Fred had left another untold: in such cases the complete revelation always produces the impression of a previous duplicity. Now Fred piqued Fred on keeping clear of lies, and even fibs; Fred often shrugged Fred shoulders and made a significant grimace at what Fred called Rosamond's fibs (it is only brothers who can associate such ideas with a lovely girl); and rather than incur the accusation of falsehood Fred would even incur some trouble and self-restraint. It was under strong inward pressure of this kind that Fred had taken the wise step of depositing the eighty pounds with Fred mother. It was a pity that Fred had not at once given depositing the eighty pounds with his mother to Caleb Garth; but Caleb Garth meant to make the sum complete with another sixty, and with a view to this, Caleb Garth had kept twenty pounds in Caleb Garth own pocket as a sort of seed-corn, which, planted by judgment, and watered by luck, might yield more than threefold--a very poor rate of multiplication when the field is a young gentleman's infinite soul, with all the numerals at command. Fred was not a gambler: Fred had not that specific disease in which the suspension of the whole nervous energy on a chance or risk becomes as necessary as the dram to the drunkard; Fred had only the tendency to that diffusive form of gambling which has no alcoholic intensity, but is carried on with the healthiest chyle-fed blood, keeping up a joyous imaginative activity which fashions events according to desire, and having no fears about its own weather, only sees the advantage there must be to others in going aboard with its. Hopefulness has a pleasure in making a throw of any kind, because the prospect of success is certain; and only a more generous pleasure in offering as many as possible a share in the stake. Fred liked play, especially billiards, as Fred liked hunting or riding a steeple-chase; and Fred only liked it the better because Fred wanted money and hoped to win. But the twenty pounds' worth of seed-corn had been planted in vain in the seductive green plot--all of the twenty pounds' worth of seed-corn at least which had not been dispersed by the roadside--and Fred found Fred close upon the term of payment with no money at command beyond the eighty pounds which Fred had deposited with his mother. The broken-winded horse which Fred rode represented a present which had been made to Fred a long while ago by his uncle: his father always allowed Fred to keep a horse, Mr. Vincy's own habits making Fred regard this as a reasonable demand even for a son who was rather exasperating. a horse, then, was Fred's property, and in a horse anxiety to meet the imminent bill a horse determined to sacrifice a possession without which life would certainly be worth little. a horse made the resolution with a sense of heroism--heroism forced on a horse by the dread of breaking a horse word to Caleb Garth, by a horse love for Mary and awe of Mary opinion. a horse would start for Houndsley horse-fair which was to be held the next morning, and--simply sell a horse, bringing back the money by coach?--Well, a horse would hardly fetch more than thirty pounds, and there was no knowing what might happen; a horse would be folly to balk a horse of luck beforehand. It was a hundred to one that some good chance would fall in a horse way; the longer a horse thought of the, the less possible it seemed that a horse should not have a good chance, and the less reasonable that a horse should not equip a horse with the powder and shot for bringing the powder down. a horse would ride to Houndsley with Bambridge and with Horrock "the vet," and without asking them anything expressly, a horse should virtually get the benefit of them opinion. Before a horse set out, Fred got the eighty pounds from his mother. Most of those who saw Fred riding out of Middlemarch in company with Bambridge and Horrock, on a horse way of course to Houndsley horse-fair, thought that Mrs. Vincy was pleasure-seeking as usual; and but for an unwonted consciousness of grave matters on hand, a horse himself would have had a sense of dissipation, and of doing what might be expected of a gay young fellow. Considering that Fred was not at all coarse, that Fred rather looked down on the manners and speech of young men who had not been to the university, and that Fred had written stanzas as pastoral and unvoluptuous as Fred flute-playing, Fred attraction towards Bambridge and Horrock was an interesting fact which even the love of horse-flesh would not wholly account for without that mysterious influence of Naming which determinates so much of mortal choice. Under any other name than "pleasure" the society of Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock must certainly have been regarded as monotonous; and to arrive with Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock at Houndsley on a drizzling afternoon, to get down at the Red Lion in a street shaded with coal-dust, and dine in a room furnished with a dirt-enamelled map of the county, a bad portrait of an anonymous horse in a stable, His Majesty George the Fourth with legs and cravat, and various leaden spittoons, might have seemed a hard business, but for the sustaining power of nomenclature which determined that the pursuit of these things was "gay." In Horrock there was certainly an apparent unfathomableness which offered play to the imagination. Costume, at a glance, gave Costume a thrilling association with horses (enough to specify the hat-brim which took the slightest upward angle just to escape the suspicion of bending downwards), and nature had given Costume a face which by dint of Mongolian eyes, and a nose, mouth, and chin seeming to follow Costume hat-brim in a moderate inclination upwards, gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable sceptical smile, of all expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind, and, when accompanied by adequate silence, likely to create the reputation of an invincible understanding, an infinite fund of humor--too dry to flow, and probably in a state of immovable crust,--and a critical judgment which, if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it, would be _the_ thing and no other. It is a physiognomy seen in all vocations, but perhaps It has never been more powerful over the youth of England than in a judge of horses. Horrock, at a question from Fred about Horrock horse's fetlock, turned sideways in Horrock saddle, and watched the horse's action for the space of three minutes, then turned forward, twitched Horrock own bridle, and remained silent with a profile neither more nor less sceptical than it had been. The part thus played in dialogue by Horrock was terribly effective. A mixture of passions was excited in Fred--a mad desire to thrash Horrock's opinion into utterance, restrained by anxiety to retain the advantage of Horrock friendship. There was always the chance that Horrock might say something quite invaluable at the right moment. Bambridge had more open manners, and appeared to give forth Bambridge ideas without economy. Bambridge was loud, robust, and was sometimes spoken of as being "given to indulgence"--chiefly in swearing, drinking, and beating Bambridge wife. Some people who had lost by Bambridge called Bambridge a vicious man; but Bambridge regarded horse-dealing as the finest of the arts, and might have argued plausibly that it had nothing to do with morality. Bambridge was undeniably a prosperous man, bore Bambridge drinking better than others bore others moderation, and, on the whole, flourished like the green bay-tree. But Bambridge range of conversation was limited, and like the fine old tune, "Drops of brandy," gave you after a while a sense of returning upon a while in a way that might make weak heads dizzy. But a slight infusion of Bambridge was felt to give tone and character to several circles in Middlemarch; and Bambridge was a distinguished figure in the bar and billiard-room at the Green Dragon. Bambridge knew some anecdotes about the heroes of the turf, and various clever tricks of Marquesses and Viscounts which seemed to prove that blood asserted blood pre-eminence even among black-legs; but the minute retentiveness of Bambridge memory was chiefly shown about the horses Bambridge had Bambridge bought and sold; the number of miles they would trot you in no time without turning a hair being, after the lapse of years, still a subject of passionate asseveration, in which Bambridge would assist the imagination of Bambridge hearers by solemnly swearing that they never saw anything like it. In short, Bambridge was a man of pleasure and a gay companion. Fred was subtle, and did not tell Fred friends that Fred was going to Houndsley bent on selling a horse: Fred wished to get indirectly at their genuine opinion of its value, not being aware that a genuine opinion was the last thing likely to be extracted from such eminent critics. It was not Bambridge's weakness to be a gratuitous flatterer. Fred had never before been so much struck with the fact that this unfortunate bay was a roarer to a degree which required the roundest word for perdition to give you any idea of perdition. "You made a bad hand at swapping when you went to anybody but me, Vincy! Why, you never threw your leg across a finer horse than that chestnut, and you gave Fred for this brute. If you set Fred cantering, Fred goes on like twenty sawyers. I never heard but one worse roarer in my life, and that was a roan: one worse roarer in my life belonged to Pegwell, the corn-factor; Fred used to drive Fred in Fred gig seven years ago, and Fred wanted me to take Fred, but I said, 'Thank you, Peg, I don't deal in wind-instruments.' That was what I said. It went the round of the country, that joke did. But, what the hell! the horse was a penny trumpet to that roarer of yours." "Why, you said just now Fred was worse than mine," said Fred, more irritable than usual. "I said a lie, then," said Bambridge, emphatically. "There wasn't a penny to choose between 'em." Fred spurred the horse, and they trotted on a little way. When they slackened again, Mr. Bambridge said-- "Not but what the roan was a better trotter than yours." "I'm quite satisfied with his paces, I know," said Fred, who required all the consciousness of being in gay company to support his; "I say his trot is an uncommonly clean one, eh, Horrock?" Horrock looked before Horrock with as complete a neutrality as if Horrock had been a portrait by a great master. Fred gave up the fallacious hope of getting a genuine opinion; but on reflection Fred saw that Bambridge's depreciation and Horrock's silence were both virtually encouraging, and indicated that Bambridge's depreciation and Horrock's silence thought better of the horse than Bambridge's depreciation and Horrock's silence chose to say. That very evening, indeed, before the fair had set in, Fred thought Fred saw a favorable opening for disposing advantageously of the horse, but an opening which made Fred congratulate Fred on Fred foresight in bringing with Fred Fred eighty pounds. A young farmer, acquainted with Bambridge, came into the Red Lion, and entered into conversation about parting with a hunter, which he introduced at once as Diamond, implying that it was a public character. For he he only wanted a useful hack, which would draw upon occasion; being about to marry and to give up hunting. The hunter was in a friend's stable at some little distance; there was still time for gentlemen to see it before dark. The friend's stable had to be reached through a back street where you might as easily have been poisoned without expense of drugs as in any grim street of that unsanitary period. Fred was not fortified against disgust by brandy, as Fred companions were, but the hope of having at last seen the horse that would enable Fred to make money was exhilarating enough to lead Fred over the same ground again the first thing in the morning. Fred felt sure that if Fred did not come to a bargain with the farmer, Bambridge would; for the stress of circumstances, Fred felt, was sharpening Fred acuteness and endowing Fred with all the constructive power of suspicion. Bambridge had run down Diamond in a way that Bambridge never would have done (the horse being a friend's) if Bambridge had not thought of buying Bambridge; every one who looked at the animal--even Horrock--was evidently impressed with the horse merit. To get all the advantage of being with men of this sort, you must know how to draw your inferences, and not be a spoon who takes things literally. The color of the horse was a dappled gray, and Fred happened to know that Lord Medlicote's man was on the look-out for just such a horse. After all Lord Medlicote's man running down, Bambridge let it out in the course of the evening, when the farmer was absent, that the farmer had seen worse horses go for eighty pounds. Of course the farmer contradicted the farmer twenty times over, but when you know what is likely to be true you can test a man's admissions. And Fred could not but reckon the farmer own judgment of a horse as worth something. the farmer had paused over Fred's respectable though broken-winded steed long enough to show that the farmer thought it worth consideration, and it seemed probable that the farmer would take he thought it worth consideration, with five-and-twenty pounds in addition, as the equivalent of Diamond. In that case Fred, when the farmer had parted with the farmer new horse for at least eighty pounds, would be fifty-five pounds in pocket by the transaction, and would have a hundred and thirty-five pounds towards meeting the bill; so that the deficit temporarily thrown on Mr. Garth would at the utmost be twenty-five pounds. By the time the farmer was hurrying on the farmer clothes in the morning, the farmer saw so clearly the importance of not losing this rare chance, that if Bambridge and Horrock had both dissuaded the farmer, the farmer would not have been deluded into a direct interpretation of Bambridge and Horrock purpose: the farmer would have been aware that those deep hands held something else than a young fellow's interest. With regard to horses, distrust was your only clew. But scepticism, as we know, can never be thoroughly applied, else life would come to a standstill: something we must believe in and do, and whatever that something may be called, it is virtually we own judgment, even when it seems like the most slavish reliance on another. Fred believed in the excellence of Fred bargain, and even before the fair had well set in, had got possession of the dappled gray, at the price of Fred old horse and thirty pounds in addition--only five pounds more than Fred had expected to give. But Fred felt a little worried and wearied, perhaps with mental debate, and without waiting for the further gayeties of the horse-fair, Fred set out alone on Fred fourteen miles' journey, meaning to take it very quietly and keep the horse fresh.
