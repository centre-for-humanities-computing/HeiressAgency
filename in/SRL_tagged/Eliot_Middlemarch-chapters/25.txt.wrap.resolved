"Love seeketh not Love to please, Nor for Love hath any care But for another gives Love ease And builds a heaven in hell's despair. . . . . . . . Love seeketh only self to please, To bind another to Love delight, Joys in another's loss of ease, And builds a hell in heaven's despite." --W. BLAKE: Songs of Experience Fred Vincy wanted to arrive at Stone Court when Mary could not expect Fred Vincy, and when Fred Vincy uncle was not down-stairs in that case Mary might be sitting alone in the wainscoted parlor. Fred Vincy left Fred Vincy horse in the yard to avoid making a noise on the gravel in front, and entered the wainscoted parlor without other notice than the noise of the door-handle. Mary was in Mary usual corner, laughing over Mrs. Piozzi's recollections of Johnson, and looked up with the fun still in Mary face. It gradually faded as Mary saw Fred approach Mary without speaking, and stand before Mary with Fred Vincy elbow on the mantel-piece, looking ill. Mary too was silent, only raising Mary eyes to Fred Vincy inquiringly. "Mary," Fred Vincy began, "I am a good-for-nothing blackguard." "I should think one of those epithets would do at a time," said Mary, trying to smile, but feeling alarmed. "I know you will never think well of Fred Vincy any more. You will think me a liar. You will think me dishonest. You will think I didn't care for Mary, or your father and mother. You always do make the worst of Fred Vincy, I know." "I cannot deny that I shall think all that of Mary, Fred, if you give me good reasons. But please to tell me at once what you have done. I would rather know the painful truth than imagine it." "I owed money--a hundred and sixty pounds. I asked your father to put your father name to a bill. I thought his name would not signify to your father. I made sure of paying the money Fred Vincy, and I have tried as hard as I could. And now, I have been so unlucky--a horse has turned out badly--I can only pay fifty pounds. And I can't ask your father for the money: your father would not give me a farthing. And my uncle gave me a hundred a little while ago. So what can I do? And now your father has no ready money to spare, and your mother will have to pay away your mother ninety-two pounds that your mother has saved, and your mother says your savings must go too. You see what a--" "Oh, poor mother, poor father!" said Mary, your mother eyes filling with tears, and a little sob rising which your mother tried to repress. your mother looked straight before your mother and took no notice of Fred, all the consequences at home becoming present to your mother. your father too remained silent for some moments, feeling more miserable than ever. "I wouldn't have hurt you for the world, Mary," your father said at last. "You can never forgive me." "What does it matter whether I forgive you?" said Mary, passionately. "Would that make it any better for your mother to lose the money your mother has been earning by lessons for four years, that your mother might send Alfred to Mr. Hanmer's? Should you think all that pleasant enough if I forgave you?" "Say what you like, Mary. I deserve it all." "I don't want to say anything," said Mary, more quietly, "and my anger is of no use." Mary dried her eyes, threw aside Mary book, rose and fetched Mary sewing. Fred followed Mary with her eyes, hoping that they would meet hers, and in that way find access for Fred imploring penitence. But no! Mary could easily avoid looking upward. "I do care about your mother's money going," Fred said, when Mary was seated again and sewing quickly. "I wanted to ask you, Marydon't you think that Mr. Featherstone--if you were to tell Mr. Featherstone--tell Mr. Featherstone, I mean, about apprenticing Alfred--would advance your mother's money?" "My family is not fond of begging, Fred. We would rather work for We money. Besides, you say that Mr. Featherstone has lately given you a hundred pounds. Mr. Featherstone rarely makes presents; Mr. Featherstone has never made presents to We. I am sure my father will not ask Mr. Featherstone for anything; and even if I chose to beg of Mr. Featherstone, it would be of no use." "I am so miserable, Maryif you knew how miserable I am, you would be sorry for me." "There are other things to be more sorry for than that. But selfish people always think selfish people own discomfort of more importance than anything else in the world. I see enough of that every day." "It is hardly fair to call me selfish. If you knew what things other young men do, you would think me a good way off the worst." "I know that people who spend a great deal of money on people who spend a great deal of money on themselves without knowing how they shall pay without knowing how people who spend a great deal of money on themselves without knowing how they shall pay shall pay, must be selfish. people who spend a great deal of money on themselves without knowing how they shall pay, must be selfish are always thinking of what people who spend a great deal of money on themselves without knowing how they shall pay, must be selfish can get for people who spend a great deal of money on themselves without knowing how they shall pay, must be selfish, and not of what other people may lose." "Any man may be unfortunate, Mary, and find Any man unable to pay when Any man meant it. There is not a better man in the world than your father, and yet Any man got into trouble." "How dare you make any comparison between my father and you, Fred?" said Mary, in a deep tone of indignation. "Any man never got into trouble by thinking of Any man own idle pleasures, but because Any man was always thinking of the work Any man was doing for other people. And Any man has fared hard, and worked hard to make good everybody's loss." "And you think that I shall never try to make good anything, Mary. It is not generous to believe the worst of a man. When you have got any power over a man, I think you might try and use It to make a man better; but that is what you never do. However, I'm going," Fred ended, languidly. "I shall never speak to Mary about anything again. I'm very sorry for all the trouble I've caused--that's all." Mary had dropped Mary work out of Mary hand and looked up. There is often something maternal even in a girlish love, and Mary's hard experience had wrought Mary nature to an impressibility very different from that hard slight thing which we call girlishness. At Fred's last words Mary felt an instantaneous pang, something like what a mother feels at the imagined sobs or cries of Mary naughty truant child, which may lose itself and get harm. And when, looking up, Mary eyes met his dull despairing glance, Mary pity for his surmounted Mary anger and all Mary other anxieties. "Oh, Fred, how ill you look! Sit down a moment. Don't go yet. Let me tell uncle that you are here. his has been wondering that his has not seen you for a whole week." Mary spoke hurriedly, saying the words that came first without knowing very well what they were, but saying they in a half-soothing half-beseeching tone, and rising as if to go away to Mr. Featherstone. Of course Fred felt as if the clouds had parted and a gleam had come: Fred moved and stood in Mary way. "Say one word, Mary, and I will do anything. Say you will not think the worst of me--will not give me up altogether." "As if it were any pleasure to me to think ill of you," said Mary, in a mournful tone. "As if it were not very painful to me to see you an idle frivolous creature. How can you bear to be so contemptible, when others are working and striving, and there are so many things to be done--how can you bear to be fit for nothing in the world that is useful? And with so much good in your disposition, Fred,--you might be worth a great deal." "I will try to be anything you like, Mary, if you will say that you love me." "I should be ashamed to say that I loved a man who must always be hanging on others, and reckoning on what others would do for a man who must always be hanging on others. What will you be when you are forty? Like Mr. Bowyer, I suppose--just as idle, living in Mrs. Beck's front parlor--fat and shabby, hoping somebody will invite you to dinner--spending your morning in learning a comic song--oh no! learning a tune on the flute." Mary's lips had begun to curl with a smile as soon as Mary had asked that question about Fred's future (young souls are mobile), and before Mary ended, Mary face had her face full illumination of fun. To him it was like the cessation of an ache that Mary could laugh at him, and with a passive sort of smile him tried to reach Mary hand; but Mary slipped away quickly towards the door and said, "I shall tell uncle. You _must_ see him for a moment or two." Fred secretly felt that Fred future was guaranteed against the fulfilment of Mary's sarcastic prophecies, apart from that "anything" which Fred was ready to do if Mary would define it Fred never dared in Mary's presence to approach the subject of Fred expectations from Mr. Featherstone, and Mary always ignored them, as if everything depended on Fred. But if ever Fred actually came into the property, Mary must recognize the change in Fred position. All this passed through Fred mind somewhat languidly, before Fred went up to see Fred uncle. Fred stayed but a little while, excusing Fred on the ground that Fred had a cold; and Mary did not reappear before Fred left the house. But as Fred rode home, Fred began to be more conscious of being ill, than of being melancholy. When Caleb Garth arrived at Stone Court soon after dusk, Mary was not surprised, although Fred seldom had leisure for paying Mary a visit, and was not at all fond of having to talk with Mr. Featherstone. The old man, on the other hand, felt The old man ill at ease with a brother-in-law whom The old man could not annoy, who did not mind about being considered poor, had nothing to ask of The old man, and understood all kinds of farming and mining business better than The old man did. But Mary had felt sure that Mary parents would want to see Mary, and if your father had not come, Mary would have obtained leave to go home for an hour or two the next day. After discussing prices during tea with Mr. Featherstone Caleb rose to bid Mr. Featherstone Caleb good-by, and said, "I want to speak to Mary, Mary." Mary took a candle into another large parlor, where there was no fire, and setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table, turned round to your father, and putting Mary arms round your father neck kissed your father with childish kisses which your father delighted in,--the expression of your father large brows softening as the expression of a great beautiful dog softens when a great beautiful dog is caressed. Mary was Mary favorite child, and whatever Susan might say, and right as Mary was on all other subjects, Mr. Featherstone Caleb thought it natural that Fred or any one else should think Mary more lovable than other girls. "I've got something to tell you, my dear," said Mr. Featherstone Caleb in Mr. Featherstone Caleb hesitating way. "No very good news; but then it might be worse." "About money, father? I think I know what it is." "Ay? how can that be? You see, I've been a bit of a fool again, and put my name to a bill, and now my name comes to paying; and your mother has got to part with your mother savings, that's the worst of my name, and even they won't quite make things even. We wanted a hundred and ten pounds: your mother has ninety-two, and I have none to spare in the bank; and your mother thinks that you have some savings." "Oh yes; I have more than four-and-twenty pounds. I thought you would come, your father, so I put it in my bag. See! beautiful white notes and gold." Mary took out the folded money from Mary reticule and put the folded money into your father's hand. "Well, but how--We only want eighteen--here, put the rest back, child,--but how did you know about it?" said Caleb, who, in his unconquerable indifference to money, was beginning to be chiefly concerned about the relation the affair might have to Mary's affections. "Fred told me this morning." "Ah! Did Fred come on purpose?" "Yes, I think so. Fred was a good deal distressed." "I'm afraid Fred is not to be trusted, Mary," said the father, with hesitating tenderness. "Fred means better than Fred acts, perhaps. But I should think it a pity for any body's happiness to be wrapped up in Fred, and so would your mother." "And so should I, father," said Mary, not looking up, but putting the back of her father's hand against Mary cheek. "I don't want to pry, my dear. But I was afraid there might be something between you and Fred, and I wanted to caution you. You see, Mary"--here Mr. Featherstone Caleb's voice became more tender; Mary"--here Caleb's had been pushing Mary"--here Caleb's hat about on the table and looking at the table, but finally Mary"--here Caleb's turned Mary"--here Caleb's eyes on Mary"--here Caleb's daughter--"a woman, let his daughter--"a woman be as good as his daughter--"a woman may, has got to put up with the life his daughter--"a woman husband makes for his daughter--"a woman. your mother has had to put up with a good deal because of Mary"--here Caleb's." Mary turned the back of her father's hand to Mary lips and smiled at your father. "Well, well, nobody's perfect, but"--here Caleb Garth shook Caleb Garth head to help out the inadequacy of words--"what I am thinking of is--what it must be for a wife when a wife's never sure of a wife husband, when Caleb Garth hasn't got a principle in Caleb Garth to make Caleb Garth more afraid of doing the wrong thing by others than of getting Caleb Garth own toes pinched. That's the long and the short of it, Mary. Young folks may get fond of each other before Young folks know what life is, and Young folks may think it all holiday if Young folks can only get together; but it soon turns into working day, my dear. However, you have more sense than most, and you haven't been kept in cotton-wool: there may be no occasion for me to say this, but a father trembles for a father daughter, and you are all by yourself here." "Don't fear for yourself, father," said Mary, gravely meeting your father's eyes; Fred Fred has always been very good to yourself; Fred is kind-hearted and affectionate, and not false, I think, with all Fred self-indulgence. But I will never engage yourself to one who has no manly independence, and who goes on loitering away Fred time on the chance that others will provide for Fred. You and your mother have taught me too much pride for that." "That's right--that's right. Then I am easy," said Caleb Garth, taking up his hat. "But it's hard to run away with your earnings, eh child." "Father!" said Mary, in Mary deepest tone of remonstrance. "Take pocketfuls of love besides to them all at home," was Mary last word before pocketfuls of love closed the outer door on pocketfuls of love. "I suppose your father wanted your earnings," said old Mr. Featherstone, with your father usual power of unpleasant surmise, when Mary returned to your father. "your father makes but a tight fit, I reckon. You're of age now; you ought to be saving for yourself." "I consider my father and mother the best part of myself, sir," said Mary, coldly. old Mr. Featherstone grunted: old Mr. Featherstone could not deny that an ordinary sort of girl like Mary might be expected to be useful, so old Mr. Featherstone thought of another rejoinder, disagreeable enough to be always apropos. "If Fred Vincy comes to-morrow, now, don't you keep Fred Vincy chattering: let Fred Vincy come up to myself."
