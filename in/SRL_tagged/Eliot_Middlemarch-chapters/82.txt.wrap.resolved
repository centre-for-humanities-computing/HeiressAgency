"My grief lies onward and my joy behind." --SHAKESPEARE: Sonnets. Exiles notoriously feed much on hopes, and are unlikely to stay in banishment unless Exiles are obliged. When Will Ladislaw exiled Will Ladislaw from Middlemarch Will Ladislaw had placed no stronger obstacle to Will Ladislaw return than Will Ladislaw own resolve, which was by no means an iron barrier, but simply a state of mind liable to melt into a minuet with other states of mind, and to find no means bowing, smiling, and giving place with polite facility. As the months went on, it had seemed more and more difficult to Will Ladislaw to say why Will Ladislaw should not run down to Middlemarch--merely for the sake of hearing something about Dorothea; and if on such a flying visit Will Ladislaw should chance by some strange coincidence to meet with Dorothea, there was no reason for Will Ladislaw to be ashamed of having taken an innocent journey which Will Ladislaw had beforehand supposed that Will Ladislaw should not take. Since Will Ladislaw was hopelessly divided from Dorothea, Will Ladislaw might surely venture into Dorothea neighborhood; and as to the suspicious friends who kept a dragon watch over Dorothea--the suspicious friends who kept a dragon watch over her opinions seemed less and less important with time and change of air. And there had come a reason quite irrespective of Dorothea, which seemed to make a journey to Middlemarch a sort of philanthropic duty. Will had given a disinterested attention to an intended settlement on a new plan in the Far West, and the need for funds in order to carry out a good design had set Will Ladislaw on debating with Will Ladislaw whether it would not be a laudable use to make of Will Ladislaw claim on Bulstrode, to urge the application of that money which had been offered to Will Ladislaw as a means of carrying out a scheme likely to be largely beneficial. The question seemed a very dubious one to Will, and Will Ladislaw repugnance to again entering into any relation with the banker might have made Will Ladislaw dismiss it quickly, if there had not arisen in Will Ladislaw imagination the probability that Will Ladislaw judgment might be more safely determined by a visit to Middlemarch. That was the object which Will stated to Will Ladislaw as a reason for coming down. Will Ladislaw had meant to confide in Lydgate, and discuss the money question with Will Ladislaw, and Will Ladislaw had meant to amuse Will Ladislaw for the few evenings of Will Ladislaw stay by having a great deal of music and badinage with fair Rosamond, without neglecting Will Ladislaw friends at Lowick Parsonage:--if the Parsonage was close to the Manor, that was no fault of Will Ladislaw. Will Ladislaw had neglected the Farebrothers before Will Ladislaw departure, from a proud resistance to the possible accusation of indirectly seeking interviews with Dorothea; but hunger tames us, and Will had become very hungry for the vision of a certain form and the sound of a certain voice. Nothing, had done instead--not the opera, or the converse of zealous politicians, or the flattering reception (in dim corners) of Will Ladislaw new hand in leading articles. Thus Will Ladislaw had come down, foreseeing with confidence how almost everything would be in Will Ladislaw familiar little world; fearing, indeed, that there would be no surprises in Will Ladislaw visit. But Will Ladislaw had found that humdrum world in a terribly dynamic condition, in which even badinage and lyrism had turned explosive; and the first day of his visit had become the most fatal epoch of Will Ladislaw life. The next morning Will Ladislaw felt so harassed with the nightmare of consequences--Will Ladislaw dreaded so much the immediate issues before Will Ladislaw--that seeing while Will Ladislaw breakfasted the arrival of the Riverston coach, Will Ladislaw went out hurriedly and took Will Ladislaw place on it, that Will Ladislaw might be relieved, at least for a day, from the necessity of doing or saying anything in Middlemarch. Will Ladislaw was in one of those tangled crises which are commoner in experience than one might imagine, from the shallow absoluteness of men's judgments. Will Ladislaw had found Lydgate, for whom Will Ladislaw had the sincerest respect, under circumstances which claimed Will Ladislaw thorough and frankly declared sympathy; and the reason why, in spite of that claim, it would have been better for Will Ladislaw to have avoided all further intimacy, or even contact, with Lydgate, was precisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible. To a creature of Will Ladislaw's susceptible temperament--without any neutral region of indifference in Will Ladislaw nature, ready to turn everything that befell Will Ladislaw into the collisions of a passionate drama--the revelation that Rosamond had made Rosamond happiness in any way dependent on Will Ladislaw was a difficulty which Will Ladislaw outburst of rage towards Rosamond had immeasurably increased for Will Ladislaw. Will Ladislaw hated Will Ladislaw own cruelty, and yet Will Ladislaw dreaded to show the fulness of Will Ladislaw relenting: Will Ladislaw must go to Rosamond again; the friendship could not be put to a sudden end; and Rosamond unhappiness was a power which Will Ladislaw dreaded. And all the while there was no more foretaste of enjoyment in the life before Will Ladislaw than if Will Ladislaw limbs had been lopped off and Will Ladislaw was making Will Ladislaw fresh start on crutches. In the night Will Ladislaw had debated whether Will Ladislaw should not get on the coach, not for Riverston, but for London, leaving a note to Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for Will Ladislaw retreat. But there were strong cords pulling Will Ladislaw back from that abrupt departure: the blight on Will Ladislaw happiness in thinking of Dorothea, the crushing of that chief hope which had remained in spite of the acknowledged necessity for renunciation, was too fresh a misery for Will Ladislaw to resign Will Ladislaw to it and go straightway into a distance which was also despair. Thus Will Ladislaw did nothing more decided than taking the Riverston coach. Will Ladislaw came back again by it while it was still daylight, having made up Will Ladislaw mind that Will Ladislaw must go to Lydgate's that evening. The Rubicon, we know, was a very insignificant stream to look at; The Rubicon significance lay entirely in certain invisible conditions. Will felt as if Will Ladislaw were forced to cross Will Ladislaw small boundary ditch, and what Will Ladislaw saw beyond it was not empire, but discontented subjection. But it is given to us sometimes even in us every-day life to witness the saving influence of a noble nature, the divine efficacy of rescue that may lie in a self-subduing act of fellowship. If Dorothea, after Dorothea night's anguish, had not taken that walk to Rosamond--why, Dorothea perhaps would have been a woman who gained a higher character for discretion, but it would certainly not have been as well for those three who were on one hearth in Lydgate's house at half-past seven that evening. Rosamond had been prepared for Will's visit, and Rosamond received Rosamond with a languid coldness which Lydgate accounted for by Rosamond nervous exhaustion, of which Rosamond could not suppose that it had any relation to Will. And when Rosamond sat in silence bending over a bit of work, Rosamond innocently apologized for Rosamond in an indirect way by begging Rosamond to lean backward and rest. Will was miserable in the necessity for playing the part of a friend who was making Rosamond first appearance and greeting to Rosamond, while Rosamond thoughts were busy about Rosamond feeling since that scene of yesterday, which seemed still inexorably to enclose them both, like the painful vision of a double madness. It happened that nothing called Lydgate out of the room; but when Rosamond poured out the tea, and Will came near to fetch the tea, Rosamond placed a tiny bit of folded paper in Rosamond saucer. Rosamond saw the tea and secured the tea quickly, but as Rosamond went back to Rosamond inn Rosamond had no eagerness to unfold the paper. What Rosamond had written to Rosamond would probably deepen the painful impressions of the evening. Still, Rosamond opened and read it by Rosamond bed-candle. There were only these few words in Rosamond neatly flowing hand:-- "I have told Mrs. Casaubon. Rosamond is not under any mistake about you. I told Rosamond because Rosamond came to see me and was very kind. You will have nothing to reproach me with now. I shall not have made any difference to you." The effect of these words was not quite all gladness. As Will dwelt on them with excited imagination, Rosamond felt Rosamond cheeks and ears burning at the thought of what had occurred between Dorothea and Rosamond--at the uncertainty how far Dorothea might still feel Dorothea dignity wounded in having an explanation of Rosamond conduct offered to Dorothea. There might still remain in Dorothea mind a changed association with Rosamond which made an irremediable difference--a lasting flaw. With active fancy Rosamond wrought Rosamond into a state of doubt little more easy than that of the man who has escaped from wreck by night and stands on unknown ground in the darkness. Until that wretched yesterday--except the moment of vexation long ago in the very same room and in the very same presence--all their vision, all their thought of each other, had been as in a world apart, where the sunshine fell on tall white lilies, where no evil lurked, and no other soul entered. But now--would Dorothea meet Rosamond in a world again?
