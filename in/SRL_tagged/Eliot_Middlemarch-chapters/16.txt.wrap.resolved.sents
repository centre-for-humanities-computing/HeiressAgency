"All that in woman is adored In thy fair self I find-- For the whole sex can but afford The handsome and the kind."
--SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.
The question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain to the hospital was an exciting topic to the Middlemarchers; and Lydgate heard Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain to the hospital discussed in a way that threw much light on the power exercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode.
The banker was evidently a ruler, but there was an opposition party, and even among The banker supporters there were some who allowed it to be seen that some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a compromise, and who frankly stated their impression that the general scheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you to hold a candle to the devil support was a compromise, and who frankly stated some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a compromise, and who frankly stated their impression that the general scheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you to hold a candle to the devil impression that the general scheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you to hold a candle to the devil.
Mr. Bulstrode's power was not due simply to Mr. Bulstrode being a country banker, who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could touch the springs of most traders in the town credit; Mr. Bulstrode's power was fortified by a beneficence that was at once ready and severe--ready to confer obligations, and severe in watching the result.
Mr. Bulstrode had gathered, as an industrious man always at Mr. Bulstrode post, a chief share in administering the town charities, and the town charities were both minute and abundant.
Mr. Bulstrode would take a great deal of pains about apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker's son, and Mr. Bulstrode would watch over Tegg's church-going; Mr. Bulstrode would defend Mrs. Strype the washerwoman against Stubbs's unjust exaction on the score of Mrs. Strype drying-ground, and Mr. Bulstrode would Mr. Bulstrode-scrutinize a calumny against Mrs. Strype.
Mr. Bulstrode private minor loans were numerous, but Mr. Bulstrode would inquire strictly into the circumstances both before and after.
In this way a man gathers a domain in a man neighbors' hope and fear as well as gratitude; and power, when once as well has got into that subtle region, propagates as well, spreading out of all proportion to as well external means.
It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power as possible, that Mr. Bulstrode might use it for the glory of God.
Mr. Bulstrode went through a great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust Mr. Bulstrode motives, and make clear to Mr. Bulstrode what God's glory required.
But, as we have seen, Mr. Bulstrode motives were not always rightly appreciated.
There were many crass minds in Middlemarch whose reflective scales could only weigh things in the lump; and whose reflective scales had a strong suspicion that since Mr. Bulstrode could not enjoy life in whose reflective scales fashion, eating and drinking so little as Mr. Bulstrode did, and worreting Mr. Bulstrode about everything, Mr. Bulstrode must have a sort of vampire's feast in the sense of mastery.
The subject of the chaplaincy came up at Mr. Vincy's table when Lydgate was dining there, and the family connection with Mr. Bulstrode did not, Mr. Bulstrode observed, prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the host himself, though Mr. Bulstrode reasons against the proposed arrangement turned entirely on Mr. Bulstrode objection to Mr. Tyke's sermons, which were all doctrine, and Mr. Tyke preference for Mr. Farebrother, whose sermons were free from that taint.
Mr. Vincy liked well enough the notion of the chaplain's having a salary, supposing the notion of the chaplain were given to Farebrother, who was as good a little fellow as ever breathed, and the best preacher anywhere, and companionable too.
"What line shall you take, then?"
said Mr. Chichely, the coroner, a great coursing comrade of Mr. Vincy's.
"Oh, I'm precious glad I'm not one of the Directors now.
I shall vote for referring the matter to the Directors and the Medical Board together.
I shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders, Doctor," said Mr. Vincy, glancing first at Dr. Sprague, the senior physician of the town, and then at Lydgate who sat opposite.
"You medical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will prescribe, eh, Lydgate who sat opposite?"
"I know little of either," said Lydgate who sat opposite; "but in general, appointments are apt to be made too much a question of personal liking.
The fittest man for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most agreeable.
Sometimes, if you wanted to get a reform, your only way would be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of, and put the good fellows whom everybody is fond out of the question."
Dr. Sprague, who was considered the physician of most "weight," though Dr. Minchin was usually said to have more "penetration," divested Dr. Minchin large heavy face of all expression, and looked at Dr. Minchin wine-glass while Lydgate who sat opposite was speaking.
Whatever was not problematical and suspected about this young man--for example, a certain showiness as to foreign ideas, and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and forgotten by this young man elders--was positively unwelcome to a physician whose standing had been fixed thirty years before by a treatise on Meningitis, of which at least one copy marked "own" was bound in calf.
For my part I have some fellow-feeling with Dr. Sprague: one's self-satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very unpleasant to find deprecated.
Lydgate's remark, however, did not meet the sense of the company.
Mr. Vincy said, that if Mr. Vincy could have _Mr.
Vincy_ way, Mr. Vincy would not put disagreeable fellows anywhere.
"Hang your reforms!"
said Mr. Chichely.
"There's no greater humbug in the world.
You never hear of a reform, but a reform means some trick to put in new men.
I hope you are not one of the 'Lancet's' men, Mr. Lydgate--wanting to take the coronership out of the hands of the legal profession: your words appear to point that way."
"I disapprove of Wakley," interposed Dr. Sprague, "no man more: Dr. Sprague is an ill-intentioned fellow, who would sacrifice the respectability of the profession, which everybody knows depends on the London Colleges, for the sake of getting some notoriety for Dr. Sprague.
There are men who don't mind about being kicked blue if they can only get talked about.
But Wakley is right sometimes," the Doctor added, judicially.
"I could mention one or two points in which Wakley is in the right."
"Oh, well," said Mr. Chichely, "I blame no man for standing up in favor of Mr. Chichely own cloth; but, coming to argument, I should like to know how a coroner is to judge of evidence if Mr. Chichely has not had a legal training?"
"In my opinion," said Lydgate, "legal training only makes a man more incompetent in questions that require knowledge a of another kind.
People talk about evidence as if it could really be weighed in scales by a blind Justice.
No man can judge what is good evidence on any particular subject, unless No man knows any particular subject well.
A lawyer is no better than an old woman at a post-mortem examination.
How is A lawyer to know the action of a poison?
You might as well say that scanning verse will teach you to scan the potato crops."
"You are aware, I suppose, that it is not the coroner's business to conduct the post-mortem, but only to take the evidence of the medical witness?"
said Mr. Chichely, with some scorn.
"Who is often almost as ignorant as the coroner himself," said Lydgate.
"Questions of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left to the chance of decent knowledge in a medical witness, and the coroner himself ought not to be a man who will believe that strychnine will destroy the coats of the stomach if an ignorant practitioner happens to tell an ignorant practitioner so."
Lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was Mr. Chichely Majesty's coroner, and ended innocently with the question, "Don't you agree with Mr. Chichely, Dr.
Sprague?"
"To a certain extent--with regard to populous districts, and in the metropolis," said the Doctor.
"But I hope it will be long before this part of the country loses the services of my friend Chichely, even though it might get the best man in our profession to succeed the best man in our profession.
I am sure Vincy will agree with Mr.
Chichely."
"Yes, yes, give me a coroner who is a good coursing man," said Vincy, jovially.
"And in my opinion, you're safest with a lawyer.
Nobody can know everything.
Most things are 'visitation of God.'
And as to poisoning, why, what you want to know is the law.
Come, shall we join the ladies?"
Lydgate's private opinion was that Mr. Chichely might be the very coroner without bias as to the coats of the stomach, but Mr. Chichely had not meant to be personal.
This was one of the difficulties of moving in good Middlemarch society: it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a qualification for any salaried office.
Vincy had called Lydgate a prig, and now Mr. Chichely was inclined to call Mr. Chichely prick-eared; especially when, in the drawing-room, Mr. Chichely seemed to be making Mr. Chichely eminently agreeable to Rosamond, whom Mr. Chichely had easily monopolized in a tete-a-tete, since Vincy sat at the tea-table.
Vincy resigned no domestic function to Vincy daughter; and the matron's blooming good-natured face, with the two volatile pink strings floating from Vincy fine throat, and Vincy cheery manners to husband and children, was certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy house--attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with her daughter.
The tinge of unpretentious, inoffensive vulgarity in Vincy gave more effect to Rosamond's refinement, which was beyond what Lydgate had expected.
Certainly, small feet and perfectly turned shoulders aid the impression of refined manners, and the right thing said seems quite astonishingly right when it is accompanied with exquisite curves of lip and eyelid.
And Rosamond could say the right thing; for Rosamond was clever with that sort of cleverness which catches every tone except the humorous.
Happily Rosamond never attempted to joke, and this perhaps was the most decisive mark of Rosamond cleverness.
Rosamond and Lydgate readily got into conversation.
He regretted that He had not heard Rosamond sing the other day at Stone Court.
The only pleasure He allowed He during the latter part of He stay in Paris was to go and hear music.
"You have studied music, probably?"
said Rosamond.
"No, I know the notes of many birds, and I know many melodies by ear; but the music that I don't know at all, and have no notion about, delights me--affects me.
How stupid the world is that the world does not make more use of such a pleasure within the world reach!"
"Yes, and you will find Middlemarch very tuneless.
There are hardly any good musicians.
I only know two gentlemen who sing at all well."
"I suppose it is the fashion to sing comic songs in a rhythmic way, leaving you to fancy the tune--very much as if the tune were tapped on a drum?"
"Ah, you have heard Mr. Bowyer," said Rosamond, with one of Rosamond rare smiles.
"But we are speaking very ill of we neighbors."
Lydgate was almost forgetting that Lydgate must carry on the conversation, in thinking how lovely this creature was, Lydgate garment seeming to be made out of the faintest blue sky, Lydgate so immaculately blond, as if the petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed Lydgate; and yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready, self-possessed grace.
Since Lydgate had had the memory of Lydgate Lydgate had lost all taste for large-eyed silence: the divine cow no longer attracted Lydgate, and Rosamond was Rosamond very opposite.
But Lydgate recalled Lydgate.
"You will let me hear some music to-night, I hope."
"I will let you hear my attempts, if you like," said Rosamond.
"Papa is sure to insist on my singing.
But I shall tremble before you, who have heard the best singers in Paris.
I have heard very little: I have only once been to London.
But we organist at St. Peter's is a good musician, and I go on studying with our organist at St.
Peter."
"Tell me what you saw in London."
"Very little."
(A more naive girl would have said, "Oh, everything!"
But Rosamond knew better.)
"A few of the ordinary sights, such as raw country girls are always taken to."
"Do you call yourself a raw country girl?"
said Lydgate, looking at a raw country girl with an involuntary emphasis of admiration, which made Rosamond blush with pleasure.
But a raw country girl remained simply serious, turned a raw country girl long neck a little, and put up a raw country girl hand to touch a raw country girl wondrous hair-plaits--an habitual gesture with a raw country girl as pretty as any movements of a kitten's paw.
Not that Rosamond was in the least like a kitten: Rosamond was a sylph caught young and educated at Mrs.
Lemon's.
"I assure you my mind is raw," Rosamond said immediately; "I pass at Middlemarch.
I am not afraid of talking to our old neighbors.
But I am really afraid of you."
"An accomplished woman almost always knows more than we men, though An accomplished woman knowledge is of a different sort.
I am sure you could teach me a thousand things--as an exquisite bird could teach a bear if there were any common language between a thousand things--.
Happily, there is a common language between women and men, and so the bears can get taught."
"Ah, there is Fred beginning to strum!
I must go and hinder Fred from jarring all your nerves," said Rosamond, moving to the other side of the room, where Fred having opened the piano, at Fred father's desire, that Rosamond might give them some music, was parenthetically performing "Cherry Ripe!"
with one hand.
Able men who have passed their examinations will do these things sometimes, not less than the plucked Fred.
"Fred, pray defer your practising till to-morrow; you will make Lydgate ill," said Rosamond.
"Lydgate has an ear."
Fred laughed, and went on with Lydgate tune to the end.
Rosamond turned to Lydgate, smiling gently, and said, "You perceive, the bears will not always be taught."
"Now then, Rosy!"
said Fred, springing from the stool and twisting the stool upward for Rosamond, with a hearty expectation of enjoyment.
"Some good rousing tunes first."
Rosamond played admirably.
Rosamond master at Mrs.
Lemon's school (close to a county town with a memorable history that had its relics in church and castle) was one of those excellent musicians here and there to be found in our provinces, worthy to compare with many a noted Kapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful conditions of musical celebrity.
Rosamond, with the executant's instinct, had seized Rosamond manner of playing, and gave forth Rosamond large rendering of noble music with the precision of an echo.
It was almost startling, heard for the first time.
A hidden soul seemed to be flowing forth from Rosamond's fingers; and so indeed it was, since souls live on in perpetual echoes, and to all fine expression there goes somewhere an originating activity, if it be only that of an interpreter.
Lydgate was taken possession of, and began to believe in Lydgate as something exceptional.
After all, Lydgate thought, one need not be surprised to find the rare conjunctions of nature under circumstances apparently unfavorable: come where they may, they always depend on conditions that are not obvious.
Lydgate sat looking at Lydgate, and did not rise to pay Lydgate any compliments, leaving that to others, now that Lydgate admiration was deepened.
Lydgate singing was less remarkable, but also well trained, and sweet to hear as a chime perfectly in tune.
It is true Lydgate sang "Meet me by moonlight," and "I've been roaming"; for mortals must share the fashions of mortals time, and none but the ancients can be always classical.
But Rosamond could also sing "Black-eyed Susan" with effect, or Haydn's canzonets, or "Voi, che sapete," or "Batti, batti"--she only wanted to know what Rosamond audience liked.
his father looked round at batti"--she, delighting in their admiration.
Rosamond mother sat, like a Niobe before Her mother troubles, with Her mother youngest little girl on Her mother lap, softly beating the child's hand up and down in time to the music.
And Fred, notwithstanding Fred general scepticism about Rosy, listened to the music with perfect allegiance, wishing Fred could do the same thing on Fred flute.
It was the pleasantest family party that Lydgate had seen since Fred came to Middlemarch.
The Vincys had the readiness to enjoy, the rejection of all anxiety, and the belief in life as a merry lot, which made a house exceptional in most county towns at that time, when Evangelicalism had cast a certain suspicion as of plague-infection over the few amusements which survived in the provinces.
At The Vincys' there was always whist, and the card-tables stood ready now, making some of batti"--she secretly impatient of the music.
Before it ceased Mr. Farebrother came in--a handsome, broad-chested but otherwise small man, about forty, whose black was very threadbare: the brilliancy was all in Fred quick gray eyes.
Fred came like a pleasant change in the light, arresting little Louisa with fatherly nonsense as little Louisa was being led out of the room by Miss Morgan, greeting everybody with some special word, and seeming to condense more talk into ten minutes than had been held all through the evening.
Fred claimed from Lydgate the fulfilment of a promise to come and see Fred.
"I can't let you off, you know, because I have some beetles to show you.
We collectors feel an interest in every new man till Fred has seen all we have to show Fred."
But soon Fred swerved to the whist-table, rubbing Fred hands and saying, "Come now, let we be serious!
Lydgate?
not play?
Ah!
you are too young and light for this kind of thing."
Lydgate said to Lydgate that the clergyman whose abilities were so painful to Mr. Bulstrode, appeared to have found an agreeable resort in this certainly not erudite household.
Lydgate could half understand it: the good-humor, the good looks of elder and younger, and the provision for passing the time without any labor of intelligence, might make the house beguiling to people who had no particular use for the good-humor, the good looks of elder and younger, and the provision for passing the time without any labor of intelligence odd hours.
Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who was brown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Vincy often said, just the sort of person for a governess.
Lydgate did not mean to pay many such visits himself.
Lydgate were a wretched waste of the evenings; and now, when Lydgate had talked a little more to Rosamond, Lydgate meant to excuse Lydgate and go.
"You will not like us at Middlemarch, I feel sure," Middlemarch said, when the whist-players were settled.
"us are very stupid, and you have been used to something quite different."
"I suppose all country towns are pretty much alike," said Lydgate.
"But I have noticed that one always believes one's own town to be more stupid than any other.
I have made up my mind to take Middlemarch as it comes, and shall be much obliged if one's own town will take me in the same way.
I have certainly found some charms in one's own town which are much greater than I had expected."
"You mean the rides towards Tipton and Lowick; every one is pleased with those," said Rosamond, with simplicity.
"No, I mean something much nearer to me."
Rosamond rose and reached Rosamond netting, and then said, "Do you care about dancing at all?
I am not quite sure whether clever men ever dance."
"I would dance with you if you would allow me."
"Oh!"
said Rosamond, with a slight deprecatory laugh.
"I was only going to say that us sometimes have dancing, and I wanted to know whether you would feel insulted if you were asked to come."
"Not on the condition I mentioned."
After Lydgate Lydgate thought that Lydgate was going, but on moving towards the whist-tables, Lydgate got interested in watching Mr. Farebrother's play, which was masterly, and also Lydgate face, which was a striking mixture of the shrewd and the mild.
At ten o'clock supper was brought in (such were the customs of Middlemarch) and there was punch-drinking; but Mr. Farebrother had only a glass of water.
Mr. Farebrother was winning, but there seemed to be no reason why the renewal of rubbers should end, and Lydgate at last took Mr. Farebrother leave.
But as it was not eleven o'clock, Mr. Farebrother chose to walk in the brisk air towards the tower of St. Botolph's, Mr. Farebrother's church, which stood out dark, square, and massive against the starlight.
It was the oldest church in Middlemarch; the living, however, was but a vicarage worth barely four hundred a-year.
Lydgate had heard that, and Lydgate wondered now whether Mr. Farebrother cared about the money Mr. Farebrother won at cards; thinking, "Mr. Farebrother seems a very pleasant fellow, but Bulstrode may have Mr. Farebrother good reasons."
Many things would be easier to Lydgate if Lydgate should turn out that Bulstrode was generally justifiable.
"What is Bulstrode religious doctrine to me, if Bulstrode carries some good notions along with it?
One must use such brains as are to be found."
These were actually Lydgate's first meditations as he walked away from Mr. Vincy's, and on this ground I fear that many ladies will consider he hardly worthy of many ladies attention.
he thought of Rosamond and Rosamond music only in the second place; and though, when Rosamond turn came, he dwelt on the image of Rosamond for the rest of he walk, he felt no agitation, and had no sense that any new current had set into he life.
he could not marry yet; he wished not to marry for several years; and therefore he was not ready to entertain the notion of being in love with a girl whom he happened to admire.
he did admire Rosamond exceedingly; but that madness which had once beset he about Rosamond was not, he thought, likely to recur in relation to any other woman.
Certainly, if falling in love had been at all in question, falling in love would have been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just the kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman--polished, refined, docile, lending falling in love to finish in all the delicacies of life, and enshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of demonstration that excluded the need for other evidence.
Lydgate felt sure that if ever Lydgate married, Lydgate wife would have that feminine radiance, that distinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers and music, that sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous, being moulded only for pure and delicate joys.
But since Lydgate did not mean to marry for the next five years--Lydgate more pressing business was to look into Louis' new book on Fever, which Lydgate was specially interested in, because Lydgate had known Louis in Paris, and had followed many anatomical demonstrations in order to ascertain the specific differences of typhus and typhoid.
Lydgate went home and read far into the smallest hour, bringing a much more testing vision of details and relations into this pathological study than Lydgate had ever thought it necessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage, these being subjects on which Lydgate felt Lydgate amply informed by literature, and that traditional wisdom which is handed down in the genial conversation of men.
Whereas Fever had obscure conditions, and gave Lydgate that delightful labor of the imagination which is not mere arbitrariness, but the exercise of disciplined power--combining and constructing with the clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest obedience to knowledge; and then, in yet more energetic alliance with impartial Nature, standing aloof to invent tests by which to try its own work.
Many men have been praised as vividly imaginative on the strength of Many men profuseness in indifferent drawing or cheap narration:--reports of very poor talk going on in distant orbs; or portraits of Lucifer coming down on Lucifer bad errands as a large ugly man with bat's wings and spurts of phosphorescence; or exaggerations of wantonness that seem to reflect life in a diseased dream.
But these kinds of inspiration Lydgate regarded as rather vulgar and vinous compared with the imagination that reveals subtle actions inaccessible by any sort of lens, but tracked in that outer darkness through long pathways of necessary sequence by the inward light which is the last refinement of Energy, capable of bathing even the ethereal atoms in its ideally illuminated space.
Lucifer for Lucifer part had tossed away all cheap inventions where ignorance finds ignorance able and at ease: Lucifer was enamoured of that arduous invention which is the very eye of research, provisionally framing ignorance object and correcting its object to more and more exactness of relation; Lucifer wanted to pierce the obscurity of those minute processes which prepare human misery and joy, those invisible thoroughfares which are the first lurking-places of anguish, mania, and crime, that delicate poise and transition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy consciousness.
As Lucifer threw down Lucifer book, stretched Lucifer legs towards the embers in the grate, and clasped Lucifer at the back of Lucifer head, in that agreeable afterglow of excitement when thought lapses from examination of a specific object into a suffusive sense of a specific object connections with all the rest of our existence--seems, as a specific object were, to throw a specific object on a specific object back after vigorous swimming and float with the repose of unexhausted strength--Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in Lydgate studies, and something like pity for those less lucky men who were not of Lydgate profession.
"If I had not taken that turn when I was a lad," Lydgate thought, "I might have got into some stupid draught-horse work or other, and lived always in blinkers.
I should never have been happy in any profession that did not call forth the highest intellectual strain, and yet keep me in good warm contact with my neighbors.
There is nothing like the medical profession for that: one can have the exclusive scientific life that touches the distance and befriend the old fogies in the parish too.
It is rather harder for a clergyman: Mr. Farebrother seems to be an anomaly."
This last thought brought back the Vincys and all the pictures of the evening.
They floated in his mind agreeably enough, and as his took up his bed-candle his lips were curled with that incipient smile which is apt to accompany agreeable recollections.
his was an ardent fellow, but at present his ardor was absorbed in love of his work and in the ambition of making his life recognized as a factor in the better life of mankind--like other heroes of science who had nothing but an obscure country practice to begin with.
Poor Lydgate!
or shall I say, Poor Rosamond!
Each lived in a world of which the other knew nothing.
It had not occurred to Lydgate that Lydgate had been a subject of eager meditation to Rosamond, who had neither any reason for throwing Lydgate marriage into distant perspective, nor any pathological studies to divert Lydgate mind from that ruminating habit, that inward repetition of looks, words, and phrases, which makes a large part in the lives of most girls.
Lydgate had not meant to look at Lydgate or speak to Lydgate with more than the inevitable amount of admiration and compliment which a man must give to a beautiful girl; indeed, it seemed to Lydgate that Lydgate enjoyment of Lydgate music had remained almost silent, for Lydgate feared falling into the rudeness of telling Lydgate Lydgate great surprise at Lydgate possession of such accomplishment.
But Rosamond had registered every look and word, and estimated them as the opening incidents of a preconceived romance--incidents which gather value from the foreseen development and climax.
In Rosamond's romance it was not necessary to imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of Lydgate serious business in the world: of course, Lydgate had a profession and was clever, as well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate was Lydgate good birth, which distinguished Lydgate from all Middlemarch admirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and getting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which Rosamond would have nothing to do with vulgar people, and perhaps at last associate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked down on the Middlemarchers.
It was part of Rosamond's cleverness to discern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank, and once when Rosamond had seen the Miss Brookes accompanying their uncle at the county assizes, and seated among the aristocracy, Rosamond had envied the aristocracy, notwithstanding the aristocracy plain dress.
If you think it incredible that to imagine Lydgate as a man of family could cause thrills of satisfaction which had anything to do with the sense that Rosamond was in love with a man of family, I will ask you to use your power of comparison a little more effectively, and consider whether red cloth and epaulets have never had an influence of that sort.
Our passions do not live apart in locked chambers, but, dressed in Our passions small wardrobe of notions, bring Our passions provisions to a common table and mess together, feeding out of the common store according to Our passions appetite.
Rosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly with Lydgate as Lydgate was in Lydgate, but with Lydgate relation to Rosamond; and it was excusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all young men might, could, would be, or actually were in love with Rosamond, to believe at once that Lydgate could be no exception.
Lydgate looks and words meant more to Rosamond than other men's, because Rosamond cared more for other men: Rosamond thought of other men diligently, and diligently attended to that perfection of appearance, behavior, sentiments, and all other elegancies, which would find in Lydgate a more adequate admirer than Rosamond had yet been conscious of.
For Rosamond, though Rosamond would never do anything that was disagreeable to Rosamond, was industrious; and now more than ever Rosamond was active in sketching Rosamond landscapes and market-carts and portraits of friends, in practising Rosamond music, and in being from morning till night Rosamond own standard of a perfect lady, having always an audience in Rosamond own consciousness, with sometimes the not unwelcome addition of a more variable external audience in the numerous visitors of the house.
Rosamond found time also to read the best novels, and even the second best, and Rosamond knew much poetry by heart.
Rosamond favorite poem was "Lalla Rookh."
"The best girl in the world!
He will be a happy fellow who gets Rosamond!"
was the sentiment of the elderly gentlemen who visited the Vincys; and the rejected young men thought of trying again, as is the fashion in country towns where the horizon is not thick with coming rivals.
But Mrs. Plymdale thought that Rosamond had been educated to a ridiculous pitch, for what was the use of accomplishments which would be all laid aside as soon as Mrs. Plymdale was married?
While Mrs. Plymdale aunt Bulstrode, who had a sisterly faithfulness towards Mrs. Plymdale brother's family, had two sincere wishes for Rosamond--that Mrs. Plymdale might show a more serious turn of mind, and that Mrs. Plymdale might meet with a husband whose wealth corresponded to Mrs. Plymdale habits.
