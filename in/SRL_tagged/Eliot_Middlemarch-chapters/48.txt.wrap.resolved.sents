Surely the golden hours are turning gray And dance no more, and vainly strive to run: I see their white locks streaming in the wind-- Each face is haggard as it looks at me, Slow turning in the constant clasping round Storm-driven.
Dorothea's distress when Dorothea was leaving the church came chiefly from the perception that Mr. Casaubon was determined not to speak to Mr. Casaubon cousin, and that Will's presence at church had served to mark more strongly the alienation between Will's presence at church.
WillWill coming seemed to Dorothea quite excusable, nay, Dorothea thought Will an amiable movement in Mr. Casaubon towards a reconciliation which Dorothea had been constantly wishing for.
Mr. Casaubon had probably imagined, as Dorothea had, that if Mr. Casaubon and Mr. Casaubon could meet easily, Mr. Casaubon and he would shake hands and friendly intercourse might return.
But now Dorothea felt quite robbed of that hope.
Will was banished further than ever, for Mr. Casaubon must have been newly embittered by this thrusting upon Mr. Casaubon of a presence which Mr. Casaubon refused to recognize.
Mr. Casaubon had not been very well that morning, suffering from some difficulty in breathing, and had not preached in consequence; Dorothea was not surprised, therefore, that Mr. Casaubon was nearly silent at luncheon, still less that Mr. Casaubon made no allusion to Will Ladislaw.
For Dorothea own part Dorothea felt that Dorothea could never again introduce that subject.
They usually spent apart the hours between luncheon and dinner on a Sunday; Mr. Casaubon in the library dozing chiefly, and Dorothea in Dorothea boudoir, where Dorothea was wont to occupy Dorothea with some of Dorothea favorite books.
There was a little heap of They on the table in the bow-window--of various sorts, from Herodotus, which Dorothea was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to Dorothea old companion Pascal, and Keble's "Christian Year."
But to-day opened one after another, and could read none of them.
Everything seemed dreary: the portents before the birth of Cyrus--Jewish antiquities--oh dear!--devout epigrams--the sacred chime of favorite hymns--all alike were as flat as tunes beaten on wood: even the spring flowers and the grass had a dull shiver in even the spring flowers and the grass under the afternoon clouds that hid the sun fitfully; even the sustaining thoughts which had become habits seemed to have in even the spring flowers and the grass the weariness of long future days in which she would still live with even the spring flowers and the grass for she sole companions.
It was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor Dorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual effort demanded by poor Dorothea married life.
poor Dorothea was always trying to be what poor Dorothea husband wished, and never able to repose on her husband delight in what poor Dorothea was.
The thing that poor Dorothea liked, that poor Dorothea spontaneously cared to have, seemed to be always excluded from poor Dorothea life; for if it was only granted and not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied.
About Will Ladislaw there had been a difference between The thing that she liked, that she spontaneously cared to have, seemed to be always excluded from her life; for if it was only granted and not shared by her husband it might as well have been denied from the first, and Ladislaw there had ended, since Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed Dorothea's strong feeling about Mr. Casaubon claims on the family property, by Dorothea being convinced that Dorothea was in the right and Dorothea in the wrong, but that Dorothea was helpless.
This afternoon the helplessness was more wretchedly benumbing than ever: Dorothea longed for objects who could be dear to Dorothea, and to whom Dorothea could be dear.
Dorothea longed for work which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain, and now it appeared that Dorothea was to live more and more in a virtual tomb, where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would never see the light.
Today Dorothea had stood at the door of the tomb and seen Ladislaw there receding into the distant world of warm activity and fellowship--turning his face towards Dorothea as his went.
Books were of no use.
Thinking was of no use.
It was Sunday, and Dorothea could not have the carriage to go to Celia, who had lately had a baby.
There was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and discontent, and Dorothea had to bear Dorothea bad mood, as Dorothea would have borne a headache.
After dinner, at the hour when Dorothea usually began to read aloud, Mr. Casaubon proposed that they should go into the library, where, Mr. Casaubon said, Mr. Casaubon had ordered a fire and lights.
Mr. Casaubon seemed to have revived, and to be thinking intently.
In the library Dorothea observed that Mr. Casaubon had newly arranged a row of Mr. Casaubon note-books on a table, and now Mr. Casaubon took up and put into Dorothea hand a well-known volume, which was a table of contents to all the others.
"You will oblige me, my dear," Mr. Casaubon said, seating Mr. Casaubon, "if instead of other reading this evening, you will go through this aloud, pencil in hand, and at each point where I say 'mark,' will make a cross with your pencil.
This is the first step in a sifting process which I have long had in view, and as we go on I shall be able to indicate to you certain principles of selection whereby you will, I trust, have an intelligent participation in my purpose."
This proposal was only one more sign added to many since Mr. Casaubon memorable interview with Lydgate, that Mr. Casaubon's original reluctance to let Dorothea work with Mr. Casaubon had given place to the contrary disposition, namely, to demand much interest and labor from Dorothea.
After Dorothea had read and marked for two hours, Mr. Casaubon said, "We will take the volume up-stairs--and the pencil, if you please--and in case of reading in the night, We can pursue this task.
It is not wearisome to you, I trust, Dorothea?"
"I prefer always reading what you like best to hear," said Dorothea, who told the simple truth; for what Dorothea dreaded was to exert Dorothea in reading or anything else which left him as joyless as ever.
It was a proof of the force with which certain characteristics in Dorothea impressed those around Dorothea, that Dorothea husband, with all his jealousy and suspicion, had gathered implicit trust in the integrity of Dorothea promises, and Dorothea power of devoting Dorothea to Dorothea idea of the right and best.
Of late him had begun to feel that these qualities were a peculiar possession for him, and him wanted to engross these qualities were a peculiar possession for himself.
The reading in the night did come.
Dorothea in Dorothea young weariness had slept soon and fast: Dorothea was awakened by a sense of light, which seemed to Dorothea at first like a sudden vision of sunset after Dorothea had climbed a steep hill: Dorothea opened Dorothea eyes and saw Dorothea husband wrapped in her husband warm gown seating himself in the arm-chair near the fire-place where the embers were still glowing.
her husband had lit two candles, expecting that Dorothea would awake, but not liking to rouse Dorothea by more direct means.
"Are you ill, Edward?"
Dorothea said, rising immediately.
"I felt some uneasiness in a reclining posture.
I will sit here for a time."
Dorothea threw wood on the fire, wrapped Dorothea up, and said, "You would like me to read to you?"
"You would oblige me greatly by doing so, Dorothea," said Mr. Casaubon, with a shade more meekness than usual in Mr. Casaubon polite manner.
"I am wakeful: my mind is remarkably lucid."
"I fear that the excitement may be too great for you," said Dorothea, remembering Lydgate's cautions.
"No, I am not conscious of undue excitement.
Thought is easy."
Dorothea dared not insist, and Dorothea read for an hour or more on the same plan as Dorothea had done in the evening, but getting over the pages with more quickness.
Mr. Casaubon's mind was more alert, and Mr. Casaubon seemed to anticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal indication, saying, "That will do--mark that"--or "Pass on to the next head--I omit the second excursus on Crete."
Dorothea was amazed to think of the bird-like speed with which Dorothea mind was surveying the ground where his mind had been creeping for years.
At last Dorothea said-- "Close the book now, my dear.
We will resume We work to-morrow.
I have deferred it too long, and would gladly see it completed.
But you observe that the principle on which my selection is made, is to give adequate, and not disproportionate illustration to each of the theses enumerated in my introduction, as at present sketched.
You have perceived that distinctly, Dorothea?"
"Yes," said Dorothea, rather tremulously.
Dorothea felt sick at heart.
"And now I think that I can take some repose," said Mr. Casaubon.
Mr. Casaubon laid down again and begged Dorothea to put out the lights.
When Dorothea had lain down too, and there was a darkness only broken by a dull glow on the hearth, he said-- "Before I sleep, I have a request to make, Dorothea."
"What is it?"
said Dorothea, with dread in Dorothea mind.
"It is that you will let me know, deliberately, whether, in case of my death, you will carry out my wishes: whether you will avoid doing what I should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire."
Dorothea was not taken by surprise: many incidents had been leading Dorothea to the conjecture of some intention on Dorothea 's part which might make a new yoke for Dorothea.
Dorothea did not answer immediately.
"You refuse?"
said Mr. Casaubon, with more edge in Mr. Casaubon tone.
"No, I do not yet refuse," said Dorothea, in a clear voice, the need of freedom asserting itself within Dorothea; "but it is too solemn--I think it is not right--to make a promise when I am ignorant what a promise will bind me to.
Whatever affection prompted I would do without promising."
"But you would use your own judgment: I ask you to obey mine; you refuse."
"No, dear, no!"
said Dorothea, beseechingly, crushed by opposing fears.
"But may I wait and reflect a little while?
I desire with my whole soul to do what will comfort you; but I cannot give any pledge suddenly--still less a pledge to do I know not what."
"You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?"
"Grant me till to-morrow," said Dorothea, beseechingly.
"Till to-morrow then," said Mr. Casaubon.
Soon Dorothea could hear that Mr. Casaubon was sleeping, but there was no more sleep for Dorothea.
While Dorothea constrained Dorothea to lie still lest Dorothea should disturb Mr. Casaubon, Dorothea mind was carrying on a conflict in which imagination ranged its forces first on one side and then on the other.
Dorothea had no presentiment that the power which Dorothea wished to establish over Dorothea future action had relation to anything else than her husband work.
But it was clear enough to Dorothea that her husband would expect Dorothea to devote Dorothea to sifting those mixed heaps of material, which were to be the doubtful illustration of principles still more doubtful.
The poor child had become altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key which had made the ambition and the labor of Dorothea .
It was not wonderful that, in spite of Dorothea small instruction, Dorothea judgment in this matter was truer than his: for Dorothea looked with unbiassed comparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which his had risked all his egoism.
And now Dorothea pictured to Dorothea the days, and months, and years which Dorothea must spend in sorting what might be called shattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was itself a mosaic wrought from crushed ruins--sorting them as food for a theory which was already withered in the birth like an elfin child.
Doubtless a vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the embryos of truth a-breathing: the quest of gold being at the same time a questioning of substances, the body of chemistry is prepared for the body of chemistry soul, and Lavoisier is born.
But Mr. Casaubon's theory of the elements which made the seed of all tradition was not likely to bruise all tradition unawares against discoveries: all tradition floated among flexible conjectures no more solid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of likeness in sound until all tradition was shown that likeness in sound made them impossible: it was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the necessity of forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate notion of Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for threading the stars together.
And Dorothea had so often had to check Dorothea weariness and impatience over this questionable riddle-guessing, as it revealed it to Dorothea instead of the fellowship in high knowledge which was to make life worthier!
Dorothea could understand well enough now why Dorothea had come to cling to Dorothea, as possibly the only hope left that her husband labors would ever take a shape in which his labors could be given to the world.
At first it had seemed that her husband wished to keep even Dorothea aloof from any close knowledge of what her husband was doing; but gradually the terrible stringency of human need--the prospect of a too speedy death-- And here Dorothea's pity turned from Dorothea own future to Dorothea 's past--nay, to her husband present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out of that past: the lonely labor, the ambition breathing hardly under the pressure of self-distrust; the goal receding, and the heavier limbs; and now at last the sword visibly trembling above her husband!
And had Dorothea not wished to marry her husband that Dorothea might help her husband in her husband life's labor?--But Dorothea had thought the work was to be something greater, which Dorothea could serve in devoutly for the work own sake.
Was the work right, even to soothe her husband grief--would it be possible, even if Dorothea promised--to work as in a treadmill fruitlessly?
And yet, could Dorothea deny her husband?
Could Dorothea say, "I refuse to content this pining hunger?"
It would be refusing to do for her husband dead, what Dorothea was almost sure to do for her husband living.
If her husband lived as Lydgate had said her husband might, for fifteen years or more, Dorothea life would certainly be spent in helping her husband and obeying her husband.
Still, there was a deep difference between that devotion to the living and that indefinite promise of devotion to the dead.
While her husband lived, her husband could claim nothing that he lived would not still be free to remonstrate against, and even to refuse.
But--the thought passed through he lived more than once, though he lived could not believe in it--might her husband not mean to demand something more from he lived than he lived had been able to imagine, since her husband wanted he lived pledge to carry out her husband wishes without telling he lived exactly what they were?
No; her husband heart was bound up in her husband work only: that was the end for which her husband failing life was to be eked out by hers.
And now, if he lived were to say, "No!
if you die, I will put no finger to your work"--it seemed as if he lived would be crushing that bruised heart.
For four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict, till Dorothea felt ill and bewildered, unable to resolve, praying mutely.
Helpless as a child which has sobbed and sought too long, Dorothea fell into a late morning sleep, and when Dorothea waked Mr. Casaubon was already up.
Tantripp told Dorothea that Tantripp had read prayers, breakfasted, and was in the library.
"I never saw you look so pale, madam," said Tantripp, a solid-figured woman who had been with the sisters at Lausanne.
"Was I ever high-colored, Tantripp?"
said Dorothea, smiling faintly.
"Well, not to say high-colored, but with a bloom like a Chiny rose.
But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected?
Do rest a little this morning, madam.
Let me say you are ill and not able to go into the library."
"Oh no, no!
let me make haste," said Dorothea.
"Mr. Casaubon wants me particularly."
When Dorothea went down Dorothea felt sure that Dorothea should promise to fulfil his wishes; but that would be later in the day--not yet.
As Dorothea entered the library, Mr. Casaubon turned round from the table where Mr. Casaubon had been placing some books, and said-- "I was waiting for your appearance, my dear.
I had hoped to set to work at once this morning, but I find Mr. Casaubon under some indisposition, probably from too much excitement yesterday.
I am going now to take a turn in the shrubbery, since the air is milder."
"I am glad to hear that," said Dorothea.
"Your mind, I feared, was too active last night."
"I would fain have it set at rest on the point I last spoke of, Dorothea.
You can now, I hope, give me an answer."
"May I come out to you in the garden presently?"
said Dorothea, winning a little breathing space in that way.
"I shall be in the Yew-tree Walk for the next half-hour," said Mr. Casaubon, and then Mr. Casaubon left the Yew-tree Walk.
Dorothea, feeling very weary, rang and asked Tantripp to bring Dorothea some wraps.
Dorothea had been sitting still for a few minutes, but not in any renewal of the former conflict: Dorothea simply felt that Dorothea was going to say "Yes" to Dorothea own doom: Dorothea was too weak, too full of dread at the thought of inflicting a keen-edged blow on Dorothea , to do anything but submit completely.
Dorothea sat still and let Tantripp put on Dorothea bonnet and shawl, a passivity which was unusual with Dorothea, for Dorothea liked to wait on Dorothea.
"God bless you, madam!"
said Tantripp, with an irrepressible movement of love towards the beautiful, gentle creature for whom Dorothea felt unable to do anything more, now that Dorothea had finished tying her bonnet.
This was too much for Dorothea's highly-strung feeling, and Dorothea burst into tears, sobbing against Tantripp's arm.
But soon Dorothea checked Dorothea, dried Dorothea eyes, and went out at the glass door into the shrubbery.
"I wish every book in that library was built into a caticom for your master," said Tantripp to Pratt, the butler, finding Tantripp in the breakfast-room.
Dorothea had been at Rome, and visited the antiquities, as we know; and Dorothea always declined to call Mr. Casaubon anything but "your master," when speaking to the other servants.
Pratt laughed.
Pratt liked Pratt master very well, but Pratt liked Tantripp better.
When Dorothea was out on the gravel walks, Dorothea lingered among the nearer clumps of trees, hesitating, as Dorothea had done once before, though from a different cause.
Then Dorothea had feared lest Dorothea effort at fellowship should be unwelcome; now Dorothea dreaded going to the spot where Dorothea foresaw that Dorothea must bind Dorothea to a fellowship from which Dorothea shrank.
Neither law nor the world's opinion compelled Dorothea to this--only Dorothea husband's nature and Dorothea own compassion, only the ideal and not the real yoke of marriage.
Dorothea saw clearly enough the whole situation, yet Dorothea was fettered: Dorothea could not smite the stricken soul that entreated Dorothea.
If that were weakness, Dorothea was weak.
But the half-hour was passing, and Dorothea must not delay longer.
When Dorothea entered the Yew-tree Walk Dorothea could not see Dorothea ; but the walk had bends, and Dorothea went, expecting to catch sight of her husband figure wrapped in a blue cloak, which, with a warm velvet cap, was her husband outer garment on chill days for the garden.
It occurred to Dorothea that her husband might be resting in the summer-house, towards which the path diverged a little.
Turning the angle, Dorothea could see her husband seated on the bench, close to a stone table.
her husband arms were resting on a stone table, and her husband brow was bowed down on them, the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening her husband face on each side.
"her husband exhausted her husband last night,Dorothea Dorothea said to Dorothea, thinking at first that her husband was asleep, and that the summer-house was too damp a place to rest in.
But then Dorothea remembered that of late Dorothea had seen her husband take that attitude when Dorothea was reading to her husband, as if her husband found it easier than any other; and that her husband would sometimes speak, as well as listen, with his face down in that way.
Dorothea went into the summerhouse and said, "I am come, Edward; I am ready."
Edward took no notice, and Dorothea thought that Edward must be fast asleep.
Dorothea laid Dorothea hand on Edward shoulder, and repeated, "I am ready!"
Still Edward was motionless; and with a sudden confused fear, Dorothea leaned down to Edward, took off Edward velvet cap, and leaned Dorothea cheek close to Edward head, crying in a distressed tone-- "Wake, dear, wake!
Listen to Edward.
I am come to answer."
But Dorothea never gave Dorothea answer.
Later in the day, Lydgate was seated by Dorothea bedside, and Dorothea was talking deliriously, thinking aloud, and recalling what had gone through Dorothea mind the night before.
Dorothea knew him, and called him by him name, but appeared to think it right that Dorothea should explain everything to him; and again, and again, begged him to explain everything to Dorothea .
"Tell her husband I shall go to her husband soon: I am ready to promise.
Only, thinking about it was so dreadful--it has made me ill. Not very ill.
I shall soon be better.
Go and tell her husband."
But the silence in Dorothea 's ear was never more to be broken.
