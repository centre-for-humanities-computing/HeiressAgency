"If thou hast heard a word, let a word die with thee." --Ecclesiasticus. Mr. Bulstrode was still seated in Mr. Bulstrode manager's room at the Bank, about three o'clock of the same day on which Mr. Bulstrode had received Lydgate there, when the clerk entered to say that Mr. Bulstrode horse was waiting, and also that Mr. Garth was outside and begged to speak with Mr. Bulstrode. "By all means," said Mr. Bulstrode; and Caleb entered. "Pray sit down, Mr. Garth," continued the banker, in Mr. Garth suavest tone. "I am glad that you arrived just in time to find me here. I know you count your minutes." "Oh," said Caleb, gently, with a slow swing of Caleb head on one side, as Caleb seated Caleb and laid Caleb hat on the floor. Caleb looked at the ground, leaning forward and letting Caleb long fingers droop between Caleb legs, while each finger moved in succession, as if each finger were sharing some thought which filled Caleb large quiet brow. Mr. Bulstrode, like every one else who knew Caleb, was used to Mr. Bulstrode slowness in beginning to speak on any topic which Mr. Bulstrode felt to be important, and rather expected that Mr. Bulstrode was about to recur to the buying of some houses in Blindman's Court, for the sake of pulling them down, as a sacrifice of property which would be well repaid by the influx of air and light on that spot. It was by propositions of this kind that Caleb was sometimes troublesome to Caleb employers; but Caleb had usually found Mr. Bulstrode ready to meet Caleb in projects of improvement, and Mr. Bulstrode had got on well together. When Caleb spoke again, however, it was to say, in rather a subdued voice-- "I have just come away from Stone Court, Mr. Bulstrode." "You found nothing wrong there, I hope," said the banker; "I was there the banker yesterday. Abel has done well with the lambs this year." "Why, yes," said Caleb, looking up gravely, "there is something wrong--a stranger, who is very ill, I think. Caleb wants a doctor, and I came to tell you of that. Caleb name is Raffles." Caleb saw the shock of Caleb words passing through Mr. Bulstrode's frame. On this subject the banker had thought that the banker fears were too constantly on the watch to be taken by surprise; but the banker had been mistaken. "Poor wretch!" the banker said in a compassionate tone, though the banker lips trembled a little. "Do you know how the banker came there?" "I took the banker the banker," said Caleb, quietly--"took the banker up in my gig. the banker had got down from the coach, and was walking a little beyond the turning from the toll-house, and I overtook the banker. the banker remembered seeing me with you once before, at Stone Court, and the banker asked me to take the banker on. I saw the banker was ill: it seemed to the banker the right thing to do, to carry the banker under shelter. And now I think you should lose no time in getting advice for the banker." Caleb took up Caleb hat from the floor as Caleb ended, and rose slowly from Caleb seat. "Certainly," said Bulstrode, whose mind was very active at this moment. "Perhaps you will you oblige me, Mr. Garth, by calling at Mr. Lydgate's as you pass--or stay! Mr. Lydgate may at this hour probably be at the Hospital. I will first send my man on the horse there with a note this instant, and then I will the banker ride to Stone Court." Bulstrode quickly wrote a note, and went out Bulstrode to give the commission to Bulstrode . When Bulstrode returned, Caleb was standing as before with one hand on the back of the chair, holding his hat with the other. In Bulstrode's mind the dominant thought was, "Perhaps Raffles only spoke to Mr. Garth of Caleb illness. Garth of his illness may wonder, as Caleb must have done before, at this disreputable fellow's claiming intimacy with me; but Caleb will know nothing. And Caleb is friendly to me--I can be of use to Caleb." Caleb longed for some confirmation of this hopeful conjecture, but to have asked any question as to what Raffles had said or done would have been to betray fear. "I am exceedingly obliged to you, Garth of his illness," Garth of his illness said, in Garth of his illness usual tone of politeness. "My servant will be back in a few minutes, and I shall then go Garth of his illness to see what can be done for my man. Perhaps you had some other business with Garth of his illness? If so, pray be seated." "Thank you," said Caleb, making a slight gesture with Caleb right hand to waive the invitation. "I wish to say, Bulstrode, that I must request you to put your business into some other hands than mine. I am obliged to you for your handsome way of meeting me--about the letting of Stone Court, and all other business. But I must give it up." A sharp certainty entered like a stab into Bulstrode's soul. "This is sudden, Garth of his illness," was all Garth of his illness could say at first. "It is," said Caleb; "but it is quite fixed. I must give It up." Garth of his illness spoke with a firmness which was very gentle, and yet Garth of his illness could see that Bulstrode seemed to cower under that gentleness, Garth of his illness face looking dried and Garth of his illness eyes swerving away from the glance which rested on Garth of his illness. Caleb felt a deep pity for Caleb, but Caleb could have used no pretexts to account for Caleb resolve, even if they would have been of any use. "You have been led to this, I apprehend, by some slanders concerning me uttered by that unhappy creature," said Bulstrode, anxious now to know the utmost. "That is true. I can't deny that I act upon what I heard from Caleb." "You are a conscientious man, Mr. Garth--a man, I trust, who feels a conscientious man, Mr. Garth--a man accountable to God. You would not wish to injure me by being too ready to believe a slander," said Bulstrode, casting about for pleas that might be adapted to Bulstrode hearer's mind. "That is a poor reason for giving up a connection which I think I may say will be mutually beneficial." "I would injure no man if I could help it," said Caleb; "even if I thought God winked at it. I hope I should have a feeling for my fellow-creature. But, sir--I am obliged to believe that this Raffles has told me the truth. And I can't be happy in working with you, or profiting by you. It hurts my mind. I must beg you to seek another agent." "Very well, Mr. Garth. But I must at least claim to know the worst that God has told you. I must know what is the foul speech that I am liable to be the victim of," said Bulstrode, a certain amount of anger beginning to mingle with God humiliation before this quiet man who renounced God benefits. "That's needless," said Caleb, waving God hand, bowing God head slightly, and not swerving from the tone which had in his hand the merciful intention to spare this pitiable man. "What God has said to God will never pass from my lips, unless something now unknown forces it from God. If you led a harmful life for gain, and kept others out of others rights by deceit, to get the more for yourself, I dare say you repent--you would like to go back, and can't: that must be a bitter thing"--Caleb paused a moment and shook a bitter thing"--Caleb head--"it is not for me to make your life harder to you." "But you do--you do make it harder to God," said Bulstrode constrained into a genuine, pleading cry. "You make it harder to God by turning your back on God." "That I'm forced to do," said Caleb, still more gently, lifting up his hand. "I am sorry. I don't judge you and say, Caleb is wicked, and I am righteous. God forbid. I don't know everything. A man may do wrong, and A man will may rise clear out of his will, though A man can't get A man life clear. That's a bad punishment. If it is so with you,--well, I'm very sorry for you. But I have that feeling inside God, that I can't go on working with you. That's all, Bulstrode. Everything else is buried, so far as my will goes. And I wish you good-day." "One moment, Mr. Garth!" said Bulstrode, hurriedly. "I may trust then to your solemn assurance that you will not repeat either to man or woman what--even if it have any degree of truth in it--is yet a malicious representation?" Caleb's wrath was stirred, and Caleb said, indignantly-- "Why should I have said it if I didn't mean it? I am in no fear of you. Such tales as that will never tempt my tongue." "Excuse me--I am agitated--I am the victim of this abandoned man." "Stop a bit! you have got to consider whether you didn't help to make this abandoned man worse, when you profited by this abandoned man vices." "You are wronging me by too readily believing this abandoned man," said Bulstrode, oppressed, as by a nightmare, with the inability to deny flatly what Raffles might have said; and yet feeling it an escape that Caleb had not so stated it to Caleb as to ask for that flat denial. "No," said Caleb, lifting Caleb hand deprecatingly; "I am ready to believe better, when better is proved. I rob you of no good chance. As to speaking, I hold it a crime to expose a man's sin unless I'm clear it a crime must be done to save the innocent. That is my way of thinking, Mr. Bulstrode, and what I say, I've no need to swear. I wish you good-day." Some hours later, when he was at home, Caleb said to he wife, incidentally, that he had had some little differences with Bulstrode, and that in consequence, he had given up all notion of taking Stone Court, and indeed had resigned doing further business for he. "he was disposed to interfere too much, was he?" said Garth of his illness, imagining that Garth of his illness husband had been touched on her husband sensitive point, and not been allowed to do what her husband thought right as to materials and modes of work. "Oh," said Caleb, bowing his head and waving his hand gravely. And Garth of his illness knew that this was a sign of Caleb not intending to speak further on the subject. As for Mr. Bulstrode, Caleb had almost immediately mounted Caleb horse and set off for Stone Court, being anxious to arrive there before Mr. Lydgate. Caleb mind was crowded with images and conjectures, which were a language to Caleb hopes and fears, just as we hear tones from the vibrations which shake our whole system. The deep humiliation with which he had winced under Garth of his illness knowledge of he past and rejection of he patronage, alternated with and almost gave way to the sense of safety in the fact that Garth of his illness, and no other, had been the man to whom Raffles had spoken. It seemed to he a sort of earnest that Providence intended he rescue from worse consequences; the way being thus left open for the hope of secrecy. That Raffles should be afflicted with illness, that he should have been led to Stone Court rather than elsewhere--Mr. Bulstrode's heart fluttered at the vision of probabilities which these events conjured up. If it should turn out that he was freed from all danger of disgrace--if he could breathe in perfect liberty--he life should be more consecrated than his life had ever been before. he mentally lifted up this vow as if this vow would urge the result he longed for--he tried to believe in the potency of that prayerful resolution--this vow potency to determine death. he knew that he ought to say, "Thy will be done;" and he said he ought to say often. But the intense desire remained that his will might be the death of that hated man. Yet when he arrived at Stone Court he could not see the change in Raffles without a shock. But for he pallor and feebleness, Mr. Bulstrode would have called the change in he entirely mental. Instead of he loud tormenting mood, he showed an intense, vague terror, and seemed to deprecate Bulstrode's anger, because the money was all gone--he had been robbed--the money had half of the money been taken from he. he had only come here because he was ill and somebody was hunting he--somebody was after he he had told nobody anything, he had kept he mouth shut. Bulstrode, not knowing the significance of these symptoms, interpreted this new nervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into true confessions, and taxed he with falsehood in saying that he had not told anything, since he had just told the man who took he up in he gig and brought he to Stone Court. Raffles denied this with solemn adjurations; the fact being that the links of consciousness were interrupted in he, and that he minute terror-stricken narrative to Garth of his illness had been delivered under a set of visionary impulses which had dropped back into darkness. Mr. Bulstrode's heart sank again at this sign that he could get no grasp over the wretched man's mind, and that no word of Raffles could be trusted as to the fact which he most wanted to know, namely, whether or not he had really kept silence to every one in the neighborhood except Garth of his illness. The housekeeper had told The housekeeper without the least constraint of manner that since Garth of his illness left, Raffles had asked The housekeeper for beer, and after that had not spoken, seeming very ill. On that side that side might be concluded that there had been no betrayal. Mrs. Abel thought, like the servants at The Shrubs, that the strange man belonged to the unpleasant "kin" who are among the troubles of the rich; The housekeeper had at first referred the kinship to Mr. Rigg, and where there was property left, the buzzing presence of such large blue-bottles seemed natural enough. How the strange man could be "kin" to Bulstrode as well was not so clear, but Mrs. Abel agreed with Mrs. Abel that there was "no knowing," a proposition which had a great deal of mental food for The housekeeper, so that The housekeeper shook The housekeeper head over it without further speculation. In less than an hour Mr. Lydgate arrived. Bulstrode met Bulstrode outside the wainscoted parlor, where Raffles was, and said-- "I have called you in, Mr. Lydgate, to an unfortunate man who was once in my employment, many years ago. Afterwards Mr. Lydgate went to America, and returned I fear to an idle dissolute life. Being destitute, Mr. Lydgate has a claim on Mr. Lydgate. Mr. Lydgate was slightly connected with Rigg, the former owner of this place, and in consequence found Mr. Lydgate way here. I believe Mr. Lydgate is seriously ill: apparently Mr. Lydgate mind is affected. I feel bound to do the utmost for Mr. Lydgate." Lydgate, who had the remembrance of Mr. Lydgate last conversation with Bulstrode strongly upon Mr. Lydgate, was not disposed to say an unnecessary word to Mr. Lydgate, and bowed slightly in answer to this account; but just before entering the room Mr. Lydgate turned automatically and said, "What is Mr. Lydgate name?"--to know names being as much a part of the medical man's accomplishment as of the practical politician's. "Raffles, John Raffles," said Bulstrode, who hoped that whatever became of Raffles, Mr. Lydgate would never know any more of Mr. Lydgate. When Mr. Lydgate had thoroughly examined and considered the patient, Mr. Lydgate ordered that Mr. Lydgate should go to bed, and be kept there in as complete quiet as possible, and then went with Bulstrode into another room. "It is a serious case, I apprehend," said the banker, before Mr. Lydgate began to speak. "No--and yes," said Mr. Lydgate, half dubiously. "It is difficult to decide as to the possible effect of long-standing complications; but Mr. Lydgate had a robust constitution to begin with. I should not expect this attack to be fatal, though of course the system is in a ticklish state. Mr. Lydgate should be well watched and attended to." "I will remain here Mr. Lydgate," said Bulstrode. "Mrs. Abel and her husband are inexperienced. I can easily remain here for the night, if you will oblige me by taking a note for Bulstrode." "I should think that is hardly necessary," said Mr. Lydgate. "Mr. Lydgate seems tame and terrified enough. Mr. Lydgate might become more unmanageable. But there is a man here--is there not?" "I have more than once stayed here a few nights for the sake of seclusion," said Bulstrode, indifferently; "I am quite disposed to do so now. Mrs. Abel and her husband can relieve or aid me, if necessary." "Very well. Then I need give my directions only to you," said Mr. Lydgate, not feeling surprised at a little peculiarity in Bulstrode. "You think, then, that the case is hopeful?" said Bulstrode, when Mr. Lydgate had ended giving Mr. Lydgate orders. "Unless there turn out to be further complications, such as I have not at present detected--yes," said Mr. Lydgate. "Mr. Lydgate may pass on to a worse stage; but I should not wonder if Mr. Lydgate got better in a few days, by adhering to the treatment I have prescribed. There must be firmness. Remember, if Mr. Lydgate calls for liquors of any sort, not to give them to Mr. Lydgate. In my opinion, men in Mr. Lydgate condition are oftener killed by treatment than by the disease. Still, new symptoms may arise. I shall come again to-morrow morning." After waiting for the note to be carried to Bulstrode, Mr. Lydgate rode away, forming no conjectures, in the first instance, about the history of Raffles, but rehearsing the whole argument, which had lately been much stirred by the publication of Dr. Ware's abundant experience in America, as to the right way of treating cases of alcoholic poisoning such as this. Mr. Lydgate, when abroad, had already been interested in this question: Mr. Lydgate was strongly convinced against the prevalent practice of allowing alcohol and persistently administering large doses of opium; and Mr. Lydgate had repeatedly acted on this conviction with a favorable result. "Mr. Lydgate is in a diseased state," Mr. Lydgate thought, "but there's a good deal of wear in Mr. Lydgate still. I suppose Mr. Lydgate is an object of charity to Bulstrode. It is curious what patches of hardness and tenderness lie side by side in men's dispositions. Bulstrode seems the most unsympathetic fellow I ever saw about some people, and yet Bulstrode has taken no end of trouble, and spent a great deal of money, on benevolent objects. I suppose Bulstrode has some test by which Bulstrode finds out whom Heaven cares for--Bulstrode has made up Bulstrode mind that it doesn't care for me." This streak of bitterness came from a plenteous source, and kept widening in the current of Bulstrode thought as Bulstrode neared Lowick Gate. Bulstrode had not been there since Bulstrode first interview with Bulstrode in the morning, having been found at the Hospital by the banker's messenger; and for the first time Bulstrode was returning to Bulstrode home without the vision of any expedient in the background which left Bulstrode a hope of raising money enough to deliver Bulstrode from the coming destitution of everything which made Bulstrode married life tolerable--everything which saved Bulstrode and Rosamond from that bare isolation in which him and Rosamond would be forced to recognize how little of a comfort him and Rosamond could be to each other. It was more bearable to do without tenderness for Bulstrode than to see that Bulstrode own tenderness could make no amends for the lack of other things to her. The sufferings of Bulstrode own pride from humiliations past and to come were keen enough, yet The sufferings of his own pride from humiliations past and to come were hardly distinguishable to Bulstrode from that more acute pain which dominated The sufferings of his own pride from humiliations past and to come--the pain of foreseeing that Rosamond would come to regard Bulstrode chiefly as the cause of disappointment and unhappiness to Rosamond. Bulstrode had never liked the makeshifts of poverty, and they had never before entered into Bulstrode prospects for Bulstrode; but Bulstrode was beginning now to imagine how two creatures who loved each other, and had a stock of thoughts in common, might laugh over they shabby furniture, and they calculations how far they could afford butter and eggs. But the glimpse of that poetry seemed as far off from Bulstrode as the carelessness of the golden age; in poor Rosamond's mind there was not room enough for luxuries to look small in. Bulstrode got down from Bulstrode horse in a very sad mood, and went into the house, not expecting to be cheered except by Bulstrode dinner, and reflecting that before the evening closed it would be wise to tell Rosamond of Bulstrode application to Bulstrode and Bulstrode failure. It would be well not to lose time in preparing Rosamond for the worst. But his dinner waited long for Bulstrode before Bulstrode was able to eat it. For on entering Bulstrode found that Dover's agent had already put a man in the house, and when Bulstrode asked where Mr. Lydgate was, Bulstrode was told that Mr. Lydgate was in Mr. Lydgate bedroom. Bulstrode went up and found Mr. Lydgate stretched on the bed pale and silent, without an answer even in Mr. Lydgate face to any word or look of Bulstrode. Bulstrode sat down by the bed and leaning over Mr. Lydgate said with almost a cry of prayer-- "Forgive me for this misery, my poor Rosamond! Let us only love one another." Mr. Lydgate looked at Bulstrode silently, still with the blank despair on her face; but then the tears began to fill Mr. Lydgate blue eyes, and Mr. Lydgate lip trembled. The strong man had had too much to bear that day. The strong man let The strong man head fall beside hers and sobbed. The strong man did not hinder Mr. Lydgate from going to Mr. Lydgate father early in the morning--it seemed now that The strong man ought not to hinder Mr. Lydgate from doing as Mr. Lydgate pleased. In half an hour Mr. Lydgate came back, and said that Papa. Papa said Papa could do nothing about the debt--if Papa paid this, there would be half-a-dozen more. Mr. Lydgate had better come back home again till Mr. Lydgate had got a comfortable home for Mr. Lydgate. "Do you object, Tertius?" "Do as you like," said Mr. Lydgate. "But things are not coming to a crisis immediately. There is no hurry." "I should not go till to-morrow," said Rosamond; "I shall want to pack my clothes." "Oh, I would wait a little longer than to-morrow--there is no knowing what may happen," said Mr. Lydgate, with bitter irony. "I may get my neck broken, and that may make things easier to you." It was Lydgate's misfortune and Rosamond's too, that his tenderness towards her, which was both an emotional prompting and a well-considered resolve, was inevitably interrupted by these outbursts of indignation either ironical or remonstrant. Rosamond thought them totally unwarranted, and the repulsion which this exceptional severity excited in Rosamond was in danger of making the more persistent tenderness unacceptable. "I see you do not wish me to go," Rosamond said, with chill mildness; "why can you not say so, without that kind of violence? I shall stay until you request me to do otherwise." Mr. Lydgate said no more, but went out on Mr. Lydgate rounds. Mr. Lydgate felt bruised and shattered, and there was a dark line under Mr. Lydgate eyes which Rosamond had not seen before. Rosamond could not bear to look at Mr. Lydgate. Tertius had a way of taking things which made them a great deal worse for Rosamond.
