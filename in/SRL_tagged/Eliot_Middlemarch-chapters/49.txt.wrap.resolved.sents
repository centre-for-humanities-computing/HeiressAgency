A task too strong for wizard spells This squire had brought about; 'T is easy dropping stones in wells, But who shall get This squire out?"
"I wish to God we could hinder Dorothea from knowing this," said Sir James Chettam, with a little frown on Sir James Chettam brow, and an expression of intense disgust about Sir James Chettam mouth.
Sir James Chettam was standing on the hearth-rug in the library at Lowick Grange, and speaking to Mr. Brooke.
It was the day after Mr. Casaubon had been buried, and Dorothea was not yet able to leave Dorothea room.
"That would be difficult, you know, Chettam, as Chettam is an executrix, and Chettam likes to go into these things--property, land, that kind of thing.
Chettam has Chettam notions, you know," said Mr. Brooke, sticking Mr. Brooke eye-glasses on nervously, and exploring the edges of a folded paper which Mr. Brooke held in Mr. Brooke hand; "and Chettam would like to act--depend upon it, as an executrix Dorothea would want to act.
And Chettam was twenty-one last December, you know.
I can hinder nothing."
Sir James looked at the carpet for a minute in silence, and then lifting Sir James eyes suddenly fixed the carpet on Mr. Brooke, saying, "I will tell you what we can do.
Until Dorothea is well, all business must be kept from Chettam, and as soon as Chettam is able to be moved Chettam must come to we.
Being with Celia and the baby will be the best thing in the world for Celia, and will pass away the time.
And meanwhile you must get rid of Ladislaw: you must send the baby out of the country."
Here Sir James's look of disgust returned in all Here Sir James's look of disgust intensity.
Mr. Brooke put Mr. Brooke hands behind Mr. Brooke, walked to the window and straightened Mr. Brooke back with a little shake before Mr. Brooke replied.
"That is easily said, Chettam, easily said, you know."
"My dear sir," persisted Sir James, restraining Sir James indignation within respectful forms, "it was you who brought Sir James here, and you who keep Sir James here--I mean by the occupation you give Sir James."
"Yes, but I can't dismiss Sir James in an instant without assigning reasons, Chettam.
Ladislaw has been invaluable, most satisfactory.
I consider that I have done this part of the country a service by bringing Sir James--by bringing Sir James, you know."
Mr. Brooke ended with a nod, turning round to give a nod.
"It's a pity this part of the country didn't do without him, that's all I have to say about it.
At any rate, as Dorothea's brother-in-law, I feel warranted in objecting strongly to him being kept here by any action on the part of her friends.
You admit, I hope, that I have a right to speak about what concerns the dignity of Sir James?"
Sir James was getting warm.
"Of course, my dear Chettam, of course.
But you and I have different ideas--different--" "Not about this action of Casaubon's, I should hope," interrupted Sir James.
"I say that Sir James has most unfairly compromised Dorothea.
I say that there never was a meaner, more ungentlemanly action than this--a codicil of this sort to a will which Sir James made at the time of Sir James marriage with the knowledge and reliance of Sir James family--a positive insult to Dorothea!"
"Well, you know, Casaubon's was a little twisted about Ladislaw.
Ladislaw has told me the reason--dislike of the bent Ladislaw took, you know--Ladislaw didn't think much of Casaubon's's notions, Thoth and Dagon--that sort of thing: and I fancy that Casaubon's didn't like the independent position Ladislaw had taken up.
I saw the letters between them, you know.
Casaubon's was a little buried in books--Casaubon's didn't know the world."
"It's all very well for Ladislaw to put that color on it," said Sir James.
"But I believe Casaubon's was only jealous of Casaubon's on Dorothea's account, and the world will suppose that Casaubon's gave Casaubon's some reason; and that is what makes it so abominable--coupling Casaubon's name with this young fellow's."
"My dear Chettam, it won't lead to anything, you know," said Mr. Brooke, seating Mr. Brooke and sticking on Mr. Brooke eye-glass again.
"It's all of a piece with Casaubon's oddity.
This paper, now, 'Synoptical Tabulation' and so on, 'for the use of Casaubon's,' the use of Mrs. Casaubon was locked up in the desk with the will.
I suppose Mr. Brooke meant Dorothea to publish Mr. Brooke researches, eh?
and Dorothea'll do it, you know; Dorothea has gone into Mr. Brooke studies uncommonly."
"My dear sir," said Sir James, impatiently, "that is neither here nor there.
The question is, whether you don't see with me the propriety of sending young Ladislaw away?"
"Well, no, not the urgency of the thing.
By-and-by, perhaps, it may come round.
As to gossip, you know, sending Mr. Brooke away won't hinder gossip.
People say what People like to say, not what People have chapter and verse for," said Mr Brooke, becoming acute about the truths that lay on the side of Mr Brooke own wishes.
"I might get rid of Ladislaw up to a certain point--take away the 'Pioneer' from Ladislaw, and that sort of thing; but I couldn't send Ladislaw out of the country if Ladislaw didn't choose to go--didn't choose, you know."
Mr. Brooke, persisting as quietly as if Ladislaw were only discussing the nature of last year's weather, and nodding at the end with Ladislaw usual amenity, was an exasperating form of obstinacy.
"Good God!"
said Sir James, with as much passion as Sir James ever showed, "let us get Sir James a post; let us spend money on Sir James.
If Sir James could go in the suite of some Colonial Governor!
Grampus might take Sir James--and I could write to Fulke about it."
"But Ladislaw won't be shipped off like a head of cattle, my dear fellow; Ladislaw has Ladislaw ideas.
It's my opinion that if Ladislaw were to part from me to-morrow, you'd only hear the more of Ladislaw in the country.
With Ladislaw talent for speaking and drawing up documents, there are few men who could come up to Ladislaw as an agitator--an agitator, you know."
"Agitator!"
said Sir James, with bitter emphasis, feeling that the syllables of this word properly repeated were a sufficient exposure of this word hatefulness.
"But be reasonable, Chettam.
Dorothea, now.
As you say, she had better go to Celia as soon as possible.
she can stay under your roof, and in the mean time things may come round quietly.
Don't let us be firing off us guns in a hurry, you know.
Standish will keep us counsel, and the news will be old before the news's known.
Twenty things may happen to carry off Ladislaw--without my doing anything, you know."
"Then I am to conclude that you decline to do anything?"
"Decline, Chettam?--no--I didn't say decline.
But I really don't see what I could do.
Ladislaw is a gentleman."
"I am glad to hear Ladislaw!"
said Sir James, his irritation making his forget his a little.
"I am sure Casaubon was not."
"Well, it would have been worse if his had made the codicil to hinder she from marrying again at all, you know."
"I don't know that," said Sir James.
"It would have been less indelicate."
"One of poor Casaubon's freaks!
That attack upset his brain a little.
It all goes for nothing.
she doesn't _want_ to marry Ladislaw."
"But the codicil is framed so as to make everybody believe that she did.
I don't believe anything of the sort about Dorothea," said Sir James--then frowningly, "but I suspect Ladislaw.
I tell you frankly, I suspect Ladislaw."
"I couldn't take any immediate action on that ground, Chettam.
In fact, if it were possible to pack him off--send him to Norfolk Island--that sort of thing--it would look all the worse for Dorothea to those who knew about it.
It would seem as if we distrusted Dorothea--distrusted Dorothea, you know."
That Mr. Brooke had hit on an undeniable argument, did not tend to soothe Sir James--then frowningly.
Sir James--then frowningly put out Sir James--then frowningly hand to reach Sir James--then frowningly hat, implying that Sir James--then frowningly did not mean to contend further, and said, still with some heat-- "Well, I can only say that I think Dorothea was sacrificed once, because Dorothea friends were too careless.
I shall do what I can, as Dorothea brother, to protect Dorothea now."
"You can't do better than get Dorothea to Freshitt as soon as possible, Chettam.
I approve that plan altogether," said Mr. Brooke, well pleased that he had won the argument.
that plan would have been highly inconvenient to he to part with Ladislaw at that time, when a dissolution might happen any day, and electors were to be convinced of the course by which the interests of the country would be best served.
Mr. Brooke sincerely believed that this end could be secured by Mr. Brooke own return to Parliament: Mr. Brooke offered the forces of Mr. Brooke mind honestly to the country.
