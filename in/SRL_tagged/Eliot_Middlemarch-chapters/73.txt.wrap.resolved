Pity the laden one; this wandering woe May visit you and me. When Lydgate had allayed Mrs. Bulstrode's anxiety by telling Mrs. Bulstrode that Mrs. Bulstrode husband had been seized with faintness at the meeting, but that her husband trusted soon to see her husband better and would call again the next day, unless Mrs. Bulstrode-sent for her husband earlier, her husband went directly home, got on her husband horse, and rode three miles out of the town for the sake of being out of reach. her husband felt her husband becoming violent and unreasonable as if raging under the pain of stings: her husband was ready to curse the day on which her husband had come to Middlemarch. Everything that bad happened to her husband there seemed a mere preparation for this hateful fatality, which had come as a blight on her husband honorable ambition, and must make even people who had only vulgar standards regard her husband reputation as irrevocably damaged. In such moments a man can hardly escape being unloving. Lydgate thought of Lydgate as the sufferer, and of others as the agents who had injured Lydgate lot. Lydgate had meant everything to turn out differently; and others had thrust others into Lydgate life and thwarted Lydgate purposes. Lydgate marriage seemed an unmitigated calamity; and Lydgate was afraid of going to Rosamond before Lydgate had vented Lydgate in this solitary rage, lest the mere sight of Rosamond should exasperate Lydgate and make Lydgate behave unwarrantably. There are episodes in most men's lives in which their highest qualities can only cast a deterring shadow over the objects that fill their inward vision: Lydgate's tenderheartedness was present just then only as a dread lest Lydgate's tenderheartedness should offend against Lydgate's tenderheartedness, not as an emotion that swayed Lydgate's tenderheartedness to tenderness. For Lydgate's tenderheartedness was very miserable. Only those who know the supremacy of the intellectual life--the life which has a seed of ennobling thought and purpose within it--can understand the grief of one who falls from that serene activity into the absorbing soul-wasting struggle with worldly annoyances. How was Lydgate's tenderheartedness to live on without vindicating Lydgate's tenderheartedness among people who suspected Lydgate's tenderheartedness of baseness? How could Lydgate's tenderheartedness go silently away from Middlemarch as if Lydgate's tenderheartedness were retreating before a just condemnation? And yet how was Lydgate's tenderheartedness to set about vindicating Lydgate's tenderheartedness? For that scene at the meeting, which Lydgate's tenderheartedness had just witnessed, although it had told Lydgate's tenderheartedness no particulars, had been enough to make Lydgate's tenderheartedness own situation thoroughly clear to Lydgate's tenderheartedness. Bulstrode had been in dread of scandalous disclosures on the part of Raffles. Lydgate could now construct all the probabilities of the case. "Lydgate was afraid of some betrayal in my hearing: all Lydgate wanted was to bind me to Lydgate by a strong obligation: that was why Lydgate passed on a sudden from hardness to liberality. And Lydgate may have tampered with the patient--Lydgate may have disobeyed my orders. I fear Lydgate did. But whether Lydgate did or not, the world believes that Lydgate somehow or other poisoned Lydgate and that I winked at the crime, if I didn't help in the crime. And yet--and yet Lydgate may not be guilty of the last offence; and it is just possible that the change towards me may have been a genuine relenting--the effect of second thoughts such as Lydgate alleged. What we call the 'just possible' is sometimes true and the thing we find it easier to believe is grossly false. In Lydgate last dealings with Lydgate Bulstrode may have kept Lydgate hands pure, in spite of my suspicion to the contrary." There was a benumbing cruelty in his position. Even if his renounced every other consideration than that of justifying his--if his met shrugs, cold glances, and avoidance as an accusation, and made a public statement of all the facts as his knew them, who would be convinced? It would be playing the part of a fool to offer his own testimony on behalf of his, and say, "I did not take the money as a bribe." The circumstances would always be stronger than his assertion. And besides, to come forward and tell everything about his must include declarations about Bulstrode which would darken the suspicions of others against his. his must tell that his had not known of Raffles's existence when his first mentioned his pressing need of money to Bulstrode, and that his took money innocently as a result of that communication, not knowing that a new motive for the loan might have arisen on his being called in to this man. And after all, the suspicion of Bulstrode's motives might be unjust. But then came the question whether this man should have acted in precisely the same way if this man had not taken money? Certainly, if Raffles had continued alive and susceptible of further treatment when this man arrived, and this man had then imagined any disobedience to this man orders on the part of Bulstrode, this man would have made a strict inquiry, and if this man conjecture had been verified this man would have thrown up the case, in spite of this man recent heavy obligation. But if this man had not received any money--if Bulstrode had never revoked this man cold recommendation of bankruptcy--would this man, Lydgate, have abstained from all inquiry even on finding the man dead?--would the shrinking from an insult to Bulstrode--would the dubiousness of all medical treatment and the argument that the man own treatment would pass for the wrong with most members of the man profession--have had just the same force or significance with the man? That was the uneasy corner of Lydgate's consciousness while the man was reviewing the facts and resisting all reproach. If the man had been independent, this matter of a patient's treatment and the distinct rule that the man must do or see done that which the man believed best for the life committed to the man, would have been the point on which the man would have been the sturdiest. As it was, the man had rested in the consideration that disobedience to the man orders, however it might have arisen, could not be considered a crime, that in the dominant opinion obedience to his orders was just as likely to be fatal, and that the affair was simply one of etiquette. Whereas, again and again, in the man time of freedom, the man had denounced the perversion of pathological doubt into moral doubt and had said--"the purest experiment in treatment may still be conscientious: my business is to take care of life, and to do the best I can think of for my business. Science is properly more scrupulous than Dogma. Dogma gives a charter to mistake, but the very breath of science is a contest with mistake, and must keep the conscience alive." Alas! the conscience had got into the debasing company of money obligation and selfish respects. "Is there a medical man of them all in Middlemarch who would question a medical man of them all as I do?" said poor Lydgate, with a renewed outburst of rebellion against the oppression of a medical man of them all lot. "And yet they will all feel warranted in making a wide space between me and they, as if I were a leper! My practice and my reputation are utterly damned--I can see that. Even if I could be cleared by valid evidence, it would make little difference to the blessed world here. I have been set down as tainted and should be cheapened to them all the same." Already there had been abundant signs which had hitherto puzzled him, that just when him had been paying off him debts and getting cheerfully on him feet, the townsmen were avoiding him or looking strangely at him, and in two instances the townsmen came to him knowledge that patients of him had called in another practitioner. The reasons were too plain now. The general black-balling had begun. No wonder that in Lydgate's energetic nature the sense of a hopeless misconstruction easily turned into a dogged resistance. The scowl which occasionally showed itself on him square brow was not a meaningless accident. Already when him was re-entering the town after that ride taken in the first hours of stinging pain, him was setting him mind on remaining in Middlemarch in spite of the worst that could be done against him. him would not retreat before calumny, as if him submitted to it. him would face he submitted to it to the utmost, and no act of him should show that him was afraid. he submitted to it belonged to the generosity as well as defiant force of him nature that him resolved not to shrink from showing to the full him sense of obligation to Bulstrode. It was true that the association with him had been fatal to him--true that if him had had the thousand pounds still in him hands with all him debts unpaid him would have returned the money to Bulstrode, and taken beggary rather than the rescue which had been sullied with the suspicion of a bribe (for, remember, him was one of the proudest among the sons of men)--nevertheless, him would not turn away from this crushed fellow-mortal whose aid him had used, and make a pitiful effort to get acquittal for him by howling against another. "I shall do as I think right, and explain to nobody. They will try to starve me out, but--" him was going on with an obstinate resolve, but him was getting near home, and the thought of Rosamond urged the thought of Rosamond again into that chief place from which the thought of Rosamond had been thrust by the agonized struggles of wounded honor and pride. How would Rosamond take it all? Here was another weight of chain to drag, and poor Lydgate was in a bad mood for bearing Rosamond dumb mastery. him had no impulse to tell Rosamond the trouble which must soon be common to them both. him preferred waiting for the incidental disclosure which events must soon bring about.
