"He had more tow on He distaffe Than Gerveis knew."
--CHAUCER.
The ride to Stone Court, which Fred and Rosamond took the next morning, lay through a pretty bit of midland landscape, almost all meadows and pastures, with hedgerows still allowed to grow in bushy beauty and to spread out coral fruit for the birds.
Little details gave each field a particular physiognomy, dear to the eyes that have looked on each field from childhood: the pool in the corner where the grasses were dank and trees leaned whisperingly; the great oak shadowing a bare place in mid-pasture; the high bank where the ash-trees grew; the sudden slope of the old marl-pit making a red background for the burdock; the huddled roofs and ricks of the homestead without a traceable way of approach; the gray gate and fences against the depths of the bordering wood; and the stray hovel, its old, old thatch full of mossy hills and valleys with wondrous modulations of light and shadow such as we travel far to see in later life, and see larger, but not more beautiful.
These are the things that make the gamut of joy in landscape to midland-bred souls--the things midland-bred souls toddled among, or perhaps learned by heart standing between midland-bred souls father's knees while their father drove leisurely.
But the road, even the byroad, was excellent; for Lowick, as we have seen, was not a parish of muddy lanes and poor tenants; and it was into Lowick parish that Fred and Rosamond entered after a couple of miles' riding.
Another mile would bring Fred and Rosamond to Stone Court, and at the end of the first half, the house was already visible, looking as if the house had been arrested in the house growth toward a stone mansion by an unexpected budding of farm-buildings on the house left flank, which had hindered the house from becoming anything more than the substantial dwelling of a gentleman farmer.
It was not the less agreeable an object in the distance for the cluster of pinnacled corn-ricks which balanced the fine row of walnuts on the right.
Presently it was possible to discern something that might be a gig on the circular drive before the front door.
"Dear me," said Rosamond, "I hope none of my uncle's horrible relations are there."
"none of my uncle's horrible relations are, though.
That is Mrs. Waule's gig--the last yellow gig left, I should think.
When I see Mrs. Waule in Mrs. Waule, I understand how yellow can have been worn for mourning.
the last yellow gig seems to me more funereal than a hearse.
But then Mrs. Waule always has black crape on.
How does Mrs. Waule manage black crape, Rosy?
Mrs. Waule friends can't always be dying."
"I don't know at all.
And Mrs. Waule is not in the least evangelical," said Rosamond, reflectively, as if that religious point of view would have fully accounted for perpetual crape.
"And, not poor," Mrs. Waule added, after a moment's pause.
"No, by George!
They are as rich as Jews, those Waules and Featherstones; I mean, for people like They, who don't want to spend anything.
And yet They hang about my uncle like vultures, and are afraid of a farthing going away from They side of the family.
But I believe a farthing going away from their side of the family hates them all."
The Mrs. Waule who was so far from being admirable in the eyes of these distant connections, had happened to say this very morning (not at all with a defiant air, but in a low, muffled, neutral tone, as of a voice heard through cotton wool) that she did not wish "to enjoy their good opinion."
she was seated, as she observed, on she own brother's hearth, and had been Jane Featherstone five-and-twenty years before she had been Jane Waule, which entitled she to speak when she own brother's name had been made free with by those who had no right to it.
"What are you driving at there?"
said Jane Featherstone, holding Jane Featherstone stick between Jane Featherstone knees and settling Jane Featherstone wig, while Jane Featherstone gave she a momentary sharp glance, which seemed to react on Jane Featherstone like a draught of cold air and set Jane Featherstone coughing.
Mrs. Waule had to defer Mrs. Waule answer till Mrs. Waule was quiet again, till Mary Garth had supplied Mrs. Waule with fresh syrup, and Mrs. Waule had begun to rub the gold knob of Mrs. Waule stick, looking bitterly at the fire.
It was a bright fire, but It made no difference to the chill-looking purplish tint of Mrs. Waule's face, which was as neutral as Mrs. Waule voice; having mere chinks for eyes, and lips that hardly moved in speaking.
"The doctors can't master that cough, brother.
It's just like what I have; for I'm your own sister, constitution and everything.
But, as I was saying, it's a pity Mrs. Vincy's family can't be better conducted."
"Tchah!
you said nothing o' the sort.
You said somebody had made free with my name."
"And no more than can be proved, if what everybody says is true.
brother tells me it's the talk up and down in Middlemarch how unsteady young Vincy is, and has been forever gambling at billiards since home young Vincy came."
"Nonsense!
What's a game at billiards?
It's a good gentlemanly game; and young Vincy young Vincy is not a clodhopper.
If your son John took to billiards, now, your son John'd make a fool of your son John."
"your son John never took to billiards or any other game, brother, and is far from losing hundreds of pounds, which, if what everybody says is true, must be found somewhere else than out of young Vincy the father's pocket.
For they say your son John's been losing money for years, though nobody would think so, to see your son John go coursing and keeping open house as they do.
And I've heard say Mr. Bulstrode condemns young Vincy beyond anything for young Vincy flightiness, and spoiling young Vincy children so."!
"What's Bulstrode to me?
I don't bank with your son John."
"Well, Mr. Bulstrode is Mr. Featherstone, and they do say that young Vincy mostly trades on the Bank money; and you may see yourself, brother, when a woman past forty has pink strings always flying, and that light way of laughing at everything, it's very unbecoming.
But indulging your children is one thing, and finding money to pay your children debts is another.
And it's openly said that young Vincy has raised money on young Vincy expectations.
I don't say what expectations.
Miss Garth hears me, and is welcome to tell again.
I know young people hang together."
"No, thank you, Mrs. Waule," said Miss Garth.
"I dislike hearing scandal too much to wish to repeat it."
Mr. Featherstone rubbed the knob of Mr. Featherstone stick and made a brief convulsive show of laughter, which had much the same genuineness as an old whist-player's chuckle over a bad hand.
Still looking at the fire, Mr. Featherstone said-- "And who pretends to say young Vincy hasn't got expectations?
Such a fine, spirited fellow is like enough to have 'young Vincy."
There was a slight pause before Mrs. Waule replied, and when Mrs. Waule did so, Mrs. Waule voice seemed to be slightly moistened with tears, though Mrs. Waule face was still dry.
"Whether or no, brother, it is naturally painful to me and my brother Solomon to hear your name made free with, and your complaint being such as may carry you off sudden, and people who are no more Featherstones than the Merry-Andrew at the fair, openly reckoning on your property coming to _them_.
And me your own sister, and Solomon your own brother!
And if that's to be it, what has it pleased the Almighty to make families for?"
Here Mrs. Waule's tears fell, but with moderation.
"Come, out with it, Jane!"
said Mr. Featherstone, looking at Jane.
"You mean to say, Fred Vincy has been getting somebody to advance Fred Vincy money on what Fred Vincy says Fred Vincy knows about my will, eh?"
"I never said so, brother" (Mrs. Waule's voice had again become dry and unshaken).
"It was told me by my brother Solomon last night when my brother Solomon called coming from market to give me advice about the old wheat, me being a widow, and my son John only three-and-twenty, though steady beyond anything.
And my brother Solomon had it from most undeniable authority, and not one, but many."
"Stuff and nonsense!
I don't believe a word of it.
It's all a got-up story.
Go to the window, missy; I thought I heard a horse.
See if the doctor's coming."
"Not got up by me, brother, nor yet by Solomon, who, whatever else he may be--and I don't deny he has oddities--has made he will and parted he property equal between such kin as he's friends with; though, for my part, I think there are times when some should be considered more than others.
But Solomon makes it no secret what Solomon means to do."
"The more fool Solomon!"
said Mr. Featherstone, with some difficulty; breaking into a severe fit of coughing that required Miss Garth to stand near Mr. Featherstone, so that Miss Garth did not find out whose horses whose horses were which presently paused stamping on the gravel before the front door.
Before Mr. Featherstone's cough was quiet, Rosamond entered, bearing up Rosamond riding-habit with much grace.
Rosamond bowed ceremoniously to Mrs. Waule, who said stiffly, "How do you do, miss?"
smiled and nodded silently to Mary, and remained standing till the coughing should cease, and allow Rosamond uncle to notice Rosamond.
"Heyday, miss!"
he said at last, "you have a fine color.
Where's Fred?"
"Seeing about the horses.
he will be in presently."
"Sit down, sit down.
Mrs. Waule, you'd better go."
Even those neighbors who had called Peter Featherstone an old fox, had never accused he of being insincerely polite, and he sister was quite used to the peculiar absence of ceremony with which he marked he sense of blood-relationship.
Indeed, his sister was accustomed to think that entire freedom from the necessity of behaving agreeably was included in the Almighty's intentions about families.
his sister rose slowly without any sign of resentment, and said in his sister usual muffled monotone, "Brother, I hope the new doctor will be able to do something for "Brother.
Solomon says there's great talk of Solomon cleverness.
I'm sure it's my wish you should be spared.
And there's none more ready to nurse you than your own sister and your own nieces, if you'd only say the word.
There's Rebecca, and Joanna, and Elizabeth, you know."
"Ay, ay, I remember--you'll see I've remembered 'em all--all dark and ugly.
you'll'd need have some money, eh?
There never was any beauty in the women of our family; but the Featherstones have always had some money, and the Waules too.
Mrs. Waule had money too.
A warm man was Mrs. Waule.
Ay, ay; money's a good egg; and if you 've got money to leave behind you, lay a good egg in a warm nest.
Good-by, Mrs.
Waule."
Here Mr. Featherstone pulled at both sides of Mr. Featherstone as if Mr. Featherstone wanted to deafen Mr. Featherstone, and his sister went away ruminating on this oracular speech of Mr. Featherstone.
Notwithstanding his sister jealousy of the Vincys and of Miss Garth, there remained as the nethermost sediment in his sister mental shallows a persuasion that his sister brother Peter Featherstone could never leave her brother Peter Featherstone chief property away from her brother Peter Featherstone blood-relations:--else, why had the Almighty carried off the Almighty two wives both childless, after the Almighty had gained so much by manganese and things, turning up when nobody expected it?--and why was there a Lowick parish church, and the Waules and Powderells all sit ting in the same pew for generations, and Mr. Featherstone pew next to both childless, if, the Sunday after his sister brother Peter's death, everybody was to know that his chief property was gone out of the family?
The human mind has at no period accepted a moral chaos; and so preposterous a result was not strictly conceivable.
But we are frightened at much that is not strictly conceivable.
When Fred came in A warm man eyed Fred with a peculiar twinkle, which the younger had often had reason to interpret as pride in the satisfactory details of Fred appearance.
"You two misses go away," said Mr. Featherstone.
"I want to speak to Fred."
"Come into my room, Rosamond, you will not mind the cold for a little while," said Mary.
The two girls had not only known each other in childhood, but had been at the same provincial school together (Mary as an articled pupil), so that The two girls had many memories in common, and liked very well to talk in private.
Indeed, this tete-a-tete was one of Rosamond's objects in coming to Stone Court.
Mr. Featherstone would not begin the dialogue till the front door had been closed.
Mr. Featherstone continued to look at Fred with the same twinkle and with one of Mr. Featherstone habitual grimaces, alternately screwing and widening Mr. Featherstone mouth; and when Mr. Featherstone spoke, it was in a low tone, which might be taken for that of an informer ready to be bought off, rather than for the tone of an offended senior.
Mr. Featherstone was not a man to feel any strong moral indignation even on account of trespasses against Mr. Featherstone.
It was natural that others should want to get an advantage over Mr. Featherstone, but then, Mr. Featherstone was a little too cunning for others.
"So, Mr. Featherstone, you've been paying ten per cent for money which you've promised to pay off by mortgaging my land when I'm dead and gone, eh?
You put my life at a twelvemonth, say.
But I can alter my will yet."
Fred blushed.
Fred had not borrowed money in that way, for excellent reasons.
But Fred was conscious of having spoken with some confidence (perhaps with more than Fred exactly remembered) about Fred prospect of getting Featherstone's land as a future means of paying present debts.
"I don't know what you refer to, Mr. Featherstone.
I have certainly never borrowed any money on such an insecurity.
Please to explain."
"No, Mr. Featherstone, it's you must explain.
I can alter my will yet, let me tell you.
I'm of sound mind--can reckon compound interest in my head, and remember every fool's name as well as I could twenty years ago.
What the deuce?
I'm under eighty.
I say, you must contradict this story."
"I have contradicted this story, Mr. Featherstone," Fred answered, with a touch of impatience, not remembering that Fred did not verbally discriminate contradicting from disproving, though no one was further from confounding the two ideas than old Featherstone, who often wondered that so many fools took Fred own assertions for proofs.
"But I contradict it again.
this story is a silly lie."
"Nonsense!
you must bring dockiments.
It comes from authority."
"Name authority, and make him name the man of whom I borrowed the money, and then I can disprove this story."
"It's pretty good authority, I think--a man who knows most of what goes on in Middlemarch.
It's that fine, religious, charitable uncle o' yours.
Come now!"
Here Mr. Featherstone had Mr. Featherstone peculiar inward shake which signified merriment.
"Mr.
Bulstrode?"
"Who else, eh?"
"Then this story has grown into this lie out of some sermonizing words Mr. Featherstone may have let fall about Mr. Featherstone.
Do they pretend that Mr. Featherstone named the man who lent me the money?"
"If there is such a man, depend upon there is such a man Bulstrode knows such a man.
But, supposing you only tried to get the money lent, and didn't get it--Bulstrodeud know that too.
You bring me a writing from Bulstrode to say Bulstrode doesn't believe you've ever promised to pay your debts out o' my land.
Come now!"
Mr. Featherstone's face required Mr. Featherstone's face whole scale of grimaces as a muscular outlet to Mr. Featherstone silent triumph in the soundness of Mr. Featherstone faculties.
Fred felt Bulstrode to be in a disgusting dilemma.
"You must be joking, Mr. Featherstone.
Bulstrode, like other men, believes scores of things that are not true, and Bulstrode has a prejudice against Bulstrode.
I could easily get Bulstrode to write that Bulstrode knew no facts in proof of the report you speak of, though it might lead to unpleasantness.
But I could hardly ask Bulstrode to write down what Bulstrode believes or does not believe about Bulstrode."
Fred paused an instant, and then added, in politic appeal to Fred uncle's vanity, "That is hardly a thing for a gentleman to ask."
But Bulstrode was disappointed in the result.
"Ay, I know what you mean.
You'd sooner offend me than Bulstrode.
And what's he?--he's got no land hereabout that ever I heard tell of.
A speckilating fellow!
A speckilating fellow may come down any day, when the devil leaves off backing A speckilating fellow.
And that's what A speckilating fellow religion means: A speckilating fellow wants God A'mighty to come in.
That's nonsense!
There's one thing I made out pretty clear when I used to go to church--and it's this: God A'mighty sticks to the land.
God promises the land, and God gives the land, and God makes chaps rich with corn and cattle.
But you take the other side.
You like Bulstrode and speckilation better than Mr. Featherstone and land."
"I beg your pardon, sir," said Fred, rising, standing with God back to the fire and beating God boot with God whip.
"I like neither Bulstrode nor speculation."
God spoke rather sulkily, feeling God stalemated.
"Well, well, you can do without me, that's pretty clear," said Mr. Featherstone, secretly disliking the possibility that Fred would show Fred at all independent.
"You neither want a bit of the land to make a squire of you instead of a starving parson, nor a lift of a hundred pound by the way.
It's all one to me.
I can make five codicils if I like, and I shall keep my bank-notes for a nest-egg.
It's all one to me."
Fred colored again.
Mr. Featherstone had rarely given Fred presents of money, and at this moment it seemed almost harder to part with the immediate prospect of bank-notes than with the more distant prospect of the land.
"I am not ungrateful, Mr. Featherstone.
I never meant to show disregard for any kind intentions you might have towards me.
On the contrary."
"Very good.
Then prove it.
You bring me a letter from Bulstrode saying Bulstrode doesn't believe you've been cracking and promising to pay your debts out o' my land, and then, if there's any scrape you've got into, we'll see if I can't back you a bit.
Come now!
That's a bargain.
Here, give me your arm.
I'll try and walk round the room."
Fred, in spite of Fred irritation, had kindness enough in Fred to be a little sorry for the unloved, unvenerated old man, who with Fred dropsical legs looked more than usually pitiable in walking.
While giving your arm, Fred thought that Fred should not Fred like to be an old fellow with Fred constitution breaking up; and Fred waited good-temperedly, first before the window to hear the wonted remarks about the guinea-fowls and the weather-cock, and then before the scanty book-shelves, of which the chief glories in dark calf were Josephus, Culpepper, Klopstock's "Messiah," and several volumes of the "Gentleman's Magazine."
"Read me the names o' the books.
Come now!
you're a college man."
Fred gave a college man the titles.
"What did missy want with more books?
What must you be bringing missy more books for?"
"They amuse missy, Mr. Featherstone.
missy is very fond of reading."
"A little too fond," said Mr. Featherstone, captiously.
"missy was for reading when missy sat with Mr. Featherstone.
But I put a stop to that.
missy's got the newspaper to read out loud.
That's enough for one day, I should think.
I can't abide to see missy reading to missy.
You mind and not bring missy any more books, do you hear?"
"Yes, Mr. Featherstone, I hear."
Fred had received this order before, and had secretly disobeyed this order.
Fred intended to disobey this order again.
"Ring the bell," said Mr. Featherstone; "I want missy to come down."
Rosamond and Mary had been talking faster than Rosamond and Mary male friends.
Rosamond and Mary did not think of sitting down, but stood at the toilet-table near the window while Rosamond took off Rosamond hat, adjusted Rosamond veil, and applied little touches of Rosamond finger-tips to Rosamond hair--hair of infantine fairness, neither flaxen nor yellow.
Miss Garth seemed all the plainer standing at an angle between the two nymphs--the one in the glass, and the one out of it, who looked at each other with eyes of heavenly blue, deep enough to hold the most exquisite meanings an ingenious beholder could put into them, and deep enough to hide the meanings of the owner if these should happen to be less exquisite.
Only a few children in Middlemarch looked blond by the side of Rosamond, and the slim figure displayed by her riding-habit had delicate undulations.
In fact, most men in Middlemarch, except her brothers, held that Miss Vincy was the best girl in the world, and some called her an angel.
Miss Garth, on the contrary, had the aspect of an ordinary sinner: Miss Garth was brown; Miss Garth curly dark hair was rough and stubborn; Miss Garth stature was low; and her curly dark hair would not be true to declare, in satisfactory antithesis, that Miss Garth had all the virtues.
Plainness has Plainness peculiar temptations and vices quite as much as beauty; it is apt either to feign amiability, or, not feigning Plainness, to show all the repulsiveness of discontent: at any rate, to be called an ugly thing in contrast with that lovely creature your companion, is apt to produce some effect beyond a sense of fine veracity and fitness in the phrase.
At the age of two-and-twenty Mary had certainly not attained that perfect good sense and good principle which are usually recommended to the less fortunate girl, as if two-and-twenty Mary were to be obtained in quantities ready mixed, with a flavor of resignation as required.
Miss Garth shrewdness had a streak of satiric bitterness continually renewed and never carried utterly out of sight, except by a strong current of gratitude towards those who, instead of telling Miss Garth that Miss Garth ought to be contented, did something to make Miss Garth so.
Advancing womanhood had tempered Miss Garth plainness, which was of a good human sort, such as the mothers of our race have very commonly worn in all latitudes under a more or less becoming headgear.
Rembrandt would have painted Miss Garth with pleasure, and would have made Miss Garth broad features look out of the canvas with intelligent honesty.
For honesty, truth-telling fairness, was Mary's reigning virtue: Miss Garth neither tried to create illusions, nor indulged in them for Miss Garth own behoof, and when Miss Garth was in a good mood Miss Garth had humor enough in Miss Garth to laugh at Miss Garth.
When Rosamond and Mary happened both to be reflected in the glass, Miss Garth said, laughingly-- "What a brown patch I am by the side of you, Rosy!
You are the most unbecoming companion."
"Oh no!
No one thinks of your appearance, you are so sensible and useful, Miss Garth.
Beauty is of very little consequence in reality," said Rosamond, turning Rosamond head towards Miss Garth, but with eyes swerving towards the new view of Miss Garth neck in the glass.
"You mean my beauty," said Miss Garth, rather sardonically.
Rosamond thought, "Poor Mary, Rosamond takes the kindest things ill." Aloud Rosamond said, "What have you been doing lately?"
"I?
Oh, minding the house--pouring out syrup--pretending to be amiable and contented--learning to have a bad opinion of everybody."
"It is a wretched life for you."
"No," said "Poor Mary, with a little toss of "Poor Mary .
"I think my life is pleasanter than your Miss Morgan's."
"Yes; but your Miss Morgan Morgan is so uninteresting, and not young."
"your Miss Morgan is interesting to your Miss Morgan, I suppose; and I am not at all sure that everything gets easier as one gets older."
"No," said Rosamond, reflectively; "one wonders what such people do, without any prospect.
To be sure, there is religion as a support.
But," Rosamond added, dimpling, "it is very different with you,'Mary.
You may have an offer."
"Has any one told you any one means to make me one?"
"Of course not.
I mean, there is a gentleman who may fall in love with you, seeing you almost every day."
A certain change in Miss Garth's face was chiefly determined by the resolve not to show any change.
"Does that always make people fall in love?"
she answered, carelessly; "it seems to she quite as often a reason for detesting each other."
"Not when they are interesting and agreeable.
I hear that Mr. Lydgate is both."
"Oh, Mr.
Lydgate!"
said Miss Garth, with an unmistakable lapse into indifference.
"You want to know something about him," Miss Garth added, not choosing to indulge Rosamond's indirectness.
"Merely, how you like him."
"There is no question of liking at present.
My liking always wants some little kindness to kindle it.
I am not magnanimous enough to like people who speak to she without seeming to see me."
"Is he so haughty?"
said Rosamond, with heightened satisfaction.
"You know that he is of good family?"
"No; he is of good family did not give that as a reason."
Miss GarthMiss Garth!
you are the oddest girl.
But what sort of looking man is looking man?
Describe looking man to she."
"How can one describe a man?
I can give you an inventory: heavy eyebrows, dark eyes, a straight nose, thick dark hair, large solid white hands--and--let me see--oh, an exquisite cambric pocket-handkerchief.
But you will see an exquisite cambric pocket-handkerchief.
You know this is about the time of an exquisite cambric pocket-handkerchief visits."
Rosamond blushed a little, but said, meditatively, "I rather like a haughty manner.
I cannot endure a rattling young man."
"I did not tell you that Mr. Lydgate was haughty; but il y en a pour tous les gouts, as little Mamselle used to say, and if any girl can choose the particular sort of conceit any girl would like, I should think it is you, Rosy."
"Haughtiness is not conceit; I call Fred conceited."
"I wish no one said any worse of Fred.
Fred should be more careful.
Mrs. Waule has been telling uncle that Fred is very unsteady."
Miss Garth spoke from a girlish impulse which got the better of Miss Garth judgment.
There was a vague uneasiness associated with the word "unsteady" which Miss Garth hoped Rosamond might say something to dissipate.
But Miss Garth purposely abstained from mentioning Mrs. Waule's more special insinuation.
"Oh, Fred is horrid!"
said Rosamond.
Rosamond would not have allowed Rosamond so unsuitable a word to any one but Miss Garth.
"What do you mean by horrid?"
"He is so idle, and makes papa so angry, and says He will not take orders."
"I think Fred is quite right."
"How can you say He is quite right, Miss Garth?
I thought you had more sense of religion."
"He is not fit to be a clergyman."
"But He ought to be fit."
--"Well, then, He is not what He ought to be.
I know some other people who are in the same case."
"But no one approves of some other people who are in the same case.
I should not like to marry a clergyman; but there must be clergymen."
"It does not follow that Fred must be one."
"But when papa has been at the expense of educating papa for it!
And only suppose, if papa should have no fortune left papa?"
"I can suppose that very well," said Miss Garth, dryly.
"Then I wonder you can defend Fred," said Rosamond, inclined to push this point.
"I don't defend Fred," said Miss Garth, laughing; "I would defend any parish from having Fred for a clergyman."
"But of course if Fred were a clergyman, Fred must be different."
"Yes, Fred would be a great hypocrite; and Fred is not that yet."
"It is of no use saying anything to you, Miss Garth.
You always take Fred's part."
"Why should I not take Fred's part?"
said Miss Garth, lighting up.
"Fred would take mine.
Fred is the only person who takes the least trouble to oblige me."
"You make me feel very uncomfortable, Miss Garth," said Rosamond, with Rosamond gravest mildness; "I would not tell mamma for the world."
"What would you not tell Rosamond?"
said Miss Garth, angrily.
"Pray do not go into a rage, Miss Garth," said Rosamond, mildly as ever.
"If your mamma is afraid that Fred will make me an offer, tell Fred that I would not marry Fred if Fred asked me.
But Fred is not going to do so, that I am aware.
Fred certainly never has asked me."
"Miss Garth, you are always so violent."
"And you are always so exasperating."
"I?
What can you blame me for?"
"Oh, blameless people are always the most exasperating.
There is the bell--I think we must go down."
"I did not mean to quarrel," said Rosamond, putting on Rosamond hat.
"Quarrel?
Nonsense; we have not quarrelled.
If one is not to get into a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?"
"Am I to repeat what you have said?"
"Just as you please.
I never say what I am afraid of having repeated.
But let we go down."
Mr. Lydgate was rather late this morning, but the visitors stayed long enough to see Mr. Lydgate; for Mr. Featherstone asked Rosamond to sing to Mr. Lydgate, and Rosamond herself was so kind as to propose a second favorite song of his--"Flow on, thou shining river"--after river"--after had sung "Home, sweet home" (which river"--after detested).
This hard-headed old Overreach approved of the sentimental song, as the suitable garnish for girls, and also as fundamentally fine, sentiment being the right thing for a song.
Mr. Featherstone was still applauding the last performance, and assuring missy that Mr. Featherstone voice was as clear as a blackbird's, when Mr. Lydgate's horse passed the window.
Mr. Lydgate's horse dull expectation of the usual disagreeable routine with an aged patient--who can hardly believe that medicine would not "set Mr. Lydgate's horse up" if the doctor were only clever enough--added to Mr. Lydgate's horse general disbelief in Middlemarch charms, made a doubly effective background to this vision of Rosamond, whom Mr. Featherstone made haste ostentatiously to introduce as Mr. Lydgate's horse niece, though Mr. Lydgate's horse had never thought it worth while to speak of Miss Garth in that light.
Nothing escaped Mr. Lydgate in Rosamond's graceful behavior: how delicately Miss Garth waived the notice which the old man's want of taste had thrust upon Miss Garth by a quiet gravity, not showing Miss Garth dimples on the wrong occasion, but showing them afterwards in speaking to Miss Garth, to whom Miss Garth addressed Miss Garth with so much good-natured interest, that Lydgate, after quickly examining Miss Garth more fully than Mr. Lydgate's horse had done before, saw an adorable kindness in Rosamond's eyes.
But Miss Garth from some cause looked rather out of temper.
"Miss Rosy has been singing me a song--you've nothing to say against that, eh, doctor?"
said Mr. Featherstone.
"I like it better than your physic."
"That has made me forget how the time was going," said Rosamond, rising to reach Rosamond hat, which Rosamond had laid aside before singing, so that Rosamond flower-like head on its white stem was seen in perfection above-Rosamond riding-habit.
"Fred, we must really go."
"Very good," said Fred, who had his own reasons for not being in the best spirits, and wanted to get away.
"Miss Vincy is a musician?"
said Mr. Lydgate, following Miss Vincy with a musician eyes.
(Every nerve and muscle in Rosamond was adjusted to the consciousness that Rosamond was being looked at.
Rosamond was by nature an actress of parts that entered into Rosamond physique: Rosamond even acted Rosamond own character, and so well, that Rosamond did not know it to be precisely Rosamond own.)
"The best in Middlemarch, I'll be bound," said Mr. Featherstone, "let the next be who Rosamond will.
Eh, Fred?
Speak up for your sister."
"I'm afraid I'm out of court, sir.
My evidence would be good for nothing."
"Middlemarch has not a very high standard, uncle," said Rosamond, with a pretty lightness, going towards Rosamond whip, which lay at a distance.
Mr. Lydgate was quick in anticipating Mr. Lydgate.
Mr. Lydgate reached the whip before Mr. Lydgate did, and turned to present the whip to Mr. Lydgate.
Mr. Lydgate bowed and looked at Mr. Lydgate: Mr. Lydgate of course was looking at Mr. Lydgate, and their eyes met with that peculiar meeting which is never arrived at by effort, but seems like a sudden divine clearance of haze.
I think Mr. Lydgate turned a little paler than usual, but Rosamond blushed deeply and felt a certain astonishment.
After that, Rosamond was really anxious to go, and did not know what sort of stupidity Rosamond uncle was talking of when Rosamond went to shake hands with her uncle.
Yet this result, which Rosamond took to be a mutual impression, called falling in love, was just what Rosamond had contemplated beforehand.
Ever since that important new arrival in Middlemarch Rosamond had woven a little future, of which something like this scene was the necessary beginning.
Strangers, whether wrecked and clinging to a raft, or duly escorted and accompanied by portmanteaus, have always had a circumstantial fascination for the virgin mind, against which native merit has urged native merit in vain.
And a stranger was absolutely necessary to Rosamond's social romance, which had always turned on a lover and bridegroom who was not a Middlemarcher, and who had no connections at all like Rosamond own: of late, indeed, the construction seemed to demand that he should somehow be related to a baronet.
Now that a baronet and a stranger had met, reality proved much more moving than anticipation, and Rosamond could not doubt that this was the great epoch of Rosamond life.
Rosamond judged of Rosamond own symptoms as those of awakening love, and Rosamond held it still more natural that Mr. Lydgate should have fallen in love at first sight of Rosamond.
These things happened so often at balls, and why not by the morning light, when the complexion showed all the better for the complexion?
Rosamond, though no older than Miss Garth, was rather used to being fallen in love with; but Rosamond, for Rosamond part, had remained indifferent and fastidiously critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor.
And here was Mr. Lydgate suddenly corresponding to Rosamond ideal, being altogether foreign to Middlemarch, carrying a certain air of distinction congruous with good family, and possessing connections which offered vistas of that middle-class heaven, rank; a man of talent, also, whom it would be especially delightful to enslave: in fact, a man who had touched Rosamond nature quite newly, and brought a vivid interest into Rosamond life which was better than any fancied "might-be" such as Rosamond was in the habit of opposing to the actual.
Thus, in riding home, both the brother and the sister were preoccupied and inclined to be silent.
Rosamond, whose basis for Rosamond structure had the usual airy slightness, was of remarkably detailed and realistic imagination when the foundation had been once presupposed; and before the foundation had ridden a mile Rosamond was far on in the costume and introductions of Rosamond wedded life, having determined on Rosamond house in Middle-march, and foreseen the visits Rosamond would pay to Rosamond husband's high-bred relatives at a distance, whose finished manners Rosamond could appropriate as thoroughly as Rosamond had done Rosamond school accomplishments, preparing Rosamond thus for vaguer elevations which might ultimately come.
There was nothing financial, still less sordid, in Rosamond previsions: Rosamond cared about what were considered refinements, and not about the money that was to pay for nothing financial, still less sordid.
Fred's mind, on the other hand, was busy with an anxiety which even his ready hopefulness could not immediately quell.
his saw no way of eluding Featherstone's stupid demand without incurring consequences which his liked less even than the task of fulfilling it.
his father was already out of humor with his, and would be still more so if his were the occasion of any additional coolness between his own family and the Bulstrodes.
Then, he himself hated having to go and speak to he himself , and perhaps after drinking wine he himself had said many foolish things about Featherstone's property, and these had been magnified by report.
Fred felt that Fred made a wretched figure as a fellow who bragged about expectations from a queer old miser like Featherstone, and went to beg for certificates at Fred bidding.
But--those expectations!
Fred really had them, and Fred saw no agreeable alternative if Fred gave them up; besides, Fred had lately made a debt which galled Fred extremely, and Mr. Featherstone Featherstone had almost bargained to pay a debt which galled him extremely off.
The whole affair was miserably small: Fred debts were small, even Fred expectations were not anything so very magnificent.
Fred had known men to whom Fred would have been ashamed of confessing the smallness of Fred scrapes.
Such ruminations naturally produced a streak of misanthropic bitterness.
To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and inevitable heir to nothing in particular, while such men as Mainwaring and Vyan--certainly life was a poor business, when a spirited young fellow, with a good appetite for the best of everything, had so poor an outlook.
It had not occurred to Fred that the introduction of Bulstrode's name in the matter was a fiction of Mr. Featherstone's; nor could this have made any difference to Fred position.
Fred saw plainly enough that Fred wanted to exercise Fred power by tormenting Fred a little, and also probably to get some satisfaction out of seeing Fred on unpleasant terms with Bulstrode.
Fred fancied that Fred saw to the bottom of Fred uncle Featherstone's soul, though in reality half what Fred saw there was no more than the reflex of Fred own inclinations.
The difficult task of knowing another soul is not for young gentlemen whose consciousness is chiefly made up of their own wishes.
Fred's main point of debate with Fred was, whether Fred should tell His father, or try to get through The whole affair without His father's knowledge.
It was probably Mrs. Waule who had been talking about Fred; and if Miss Garth had repeated Mrs. Waule's report to Rosamond, it would be sure to reach Fred father, who would as surely question Fred about it.
Fred said to Rosamond, as they slackened they pace-- "Rosy, did Miss Garth tell you that Mrs. Waule had said anything about Fred?"
"Yes, indeed, Mrs. Waule did."
"What?"
"That you were very unsteady."
"Was that all?"
"I should think that was enough, Fred."
"You are sure Mrs. Waule said no more?"
"Miss Garth mentioned nothing else.
But really, Fred, I think you ought to be ashamed."
"Oh, fudge!
Don't lecture me.
What did Miss Garth say about it?"
"I am not obliged to tell you.
You care so very much what Miss Garth says, and you are too rude to allow me to speak."
"Of course I care what Miss Garth says.
Miss Garth is the best girl I know."
"I should never have thought Miss Garth was a girl to fall in love with."
"How do you know what men would fall in love with?
Girls never know."
"At least, Fred, let me advise _you_ not to fall in love with Miss Garth, for Miss Garth says Miss Garth would not marry you if you asked Miss Garth."
"Miss Garth might have waited till I did ask Miss Garth."
"I knew I did ask her would nettle you, Fred."
"Not at all.
Miss Garth would not have said so if you had not provoked Miss Garth."
Before reaching home, Fred concluded that Fred would tell the whole affair as simply as possible to Fred father, who might perhaps take on Fred the unpleasant business of speaking to Bulstrode.
