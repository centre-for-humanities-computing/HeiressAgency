They said of old the Soul had human shape, But smaller, subtler than the fleshly self, So wandered forth for airing when it pleased. And see! beside her cherub-face there floats A pale-lipped form aerial whispering her cherub-face promptings in that little shell her ear." News is often dispersed as thoughtlessly and effectively as that pollen which the bees carry off (having no idea how powdery the bees are) when the bees are buzzing in search of the bees particular nectar. This fine comparison has reference to Fred Vincy, who on that evening at Lowick Parsonage heard a lively discussion among the ladies on the news which their old servant had got from Tantripp concerning Mr. Casaubon's strange mention of Mr. Ladislaw in a codicil to Mr. Ladislaw will made not long before Mr. Ladislaw death. Miss Winifred was astounded to find that Miss Winifred brother had known the fact before, and observed that Camden was the most wonderful man for knowing things and not telling things; whereupon Mary Garth said that a codicil had perhaps got mixed up with the habits of spiders, which Miss Winifred never would listen to. Mrs. Farebrother considered that the news had something to do with the news had something to do with their having only once seen Mr. Ladislaw at Lowick, and Miss Noble made many small compassionate mewings having only once seen Mr. Ladislaw at Lowick, and Miss Noble made many small compassionate mewings. Fred knew little and cared less about Ladislaw and the Casaubons, and Fred mind never recurred to that discussion till one day calling on Rosamond at Fred mother's request to deliver a message as Fred passed, Fred happened to see Ladislaw going away. Fred and Rosamond had little to say to each other now that marriage had removed marriage from collision with the unpleasantness of brothers, and especially now that Fred had taken what marriage held the stupid and even reprehensible step of giving up the Church to take to such a business as Mr. Garth's. Hence Fred talked by preference of what Fred considered indifferent news, and "a propos of that young Ladislaw" mentioned what Fred had heard at Lowick Parsonage. Now Lydgate, like Mr. Farebrother, knew a great deal more than Mr. Farebrother told, and when Mr. Farebrother had once been set thinking about the relation between Will and Dorothea Mr. Farebrother conjectures had gone beyond the fact. Mr. Farebrother imagined that there was a passionate attachment on both sides, and this struck Mr. Farebrother as much too serious to gossip about. Mr. Farebrother remembered Will's irritability when Mr. Farebrother had mentioned Mrs. Casaubon, and was the more circumspect. On the whole Mr. Farebrother surmises, in addition to what Mr. Farebrother knew of the fact, increased Mr. Farebrother friendliness and tolerance towards Ladislaw, and made Mr. Farebrother understand the vacillation which kept Mr. Farebrother at Middlemarch after Mr. Farebrother had said that Mr. Farebrother should go away. It was significant of the separateness between Lydgate's mind and Rosamond's that Mr. Farebrother had no impulse to speak to Rosamond on the subject; indeed, Mr. Farebrother did not quite trust Rosamond reticence towards Will. And Mr. Farebrother was right there; though Mr. Farebrother had no vision of the way in which Rosamond mind would act in urging Rosamond to speak. When Rosamond repeated Fred's news to Lydgate, Mr. Farebrother said, "Take care you don't drop the faintest hint to Ladislaw, Rosy. Mr. Farebrother is likely to fly out as if you insulted Mr. Farebrother. Of course it is a painful affair." Rosamond turned Rosamond neck and patted Rosamond hair, looking the image of placid indifference. But the next time Will came when Lydgate was away, Rosamond spoke archly about Lydgate not going to London as Lydgate had threatened. "I know all about it. I have a confidential little bird," said Rosamond, showing very pretty airs of Rosamond head over the bit of work held high between Rosamond active fingers. "There is a powerful magnet in this neighborhood." "To be sure there is. Nobody knows that better than you," said Will, with light gallantry, but inwardly prepared to be angry. "It is really the most charming romance: Mr. Casaubon jealous, and foreseeing that there was no one else whom Mrs. Casaubon would so much like to marry, and no one who would so much like to marry Mrs. Casaubon as a certain gentleman; and then laying a plan to spoil all by making Mrs. Casaubon forfeit Mrs. Casaubon property if Mrs. Casaubon did marry that gentleman--and then--and then--and then--oh, I have no doubt the end will be thoroughly romantic." "Great God! what do you mean?" said Will, flushing over face and ears, Will features seeming to change as if Will had had a violent shake. "Don't joke; tell me what you mean." "You don't really know?" said Rosamond, no longer playful, and desiring nothing better than to tell in order that Rosamond might evoke effects. "No!" Will returned, impatiently. "Don't know that Mr. Casaubon has left it in Mr. Casaubon will that if Mrs. Casaubon marries you Mrs. Casaubon is to forfeit all Mrs. Casaubon property?" "How do you know that it is true?" said Will, eagerly. "My brother Fred heard it from the Farebrothers." Will started up from My brother Fred chair and reached My brother Fred hat. "I dare say she likes you better than all her property," said Rosamond, looking at My brother Fred from a distance. "Pray don't say any more about it," said Will, in a hoarse undertone extremely unlike My brother Fred usual light voice. "It is a foul insult to she and to me." Then My brother Fred sat down absently, looking before My brother Fred, but seeing nothing. "Now you are angry with _me_," said Rosamond. "It is too bad to bear _me_ malice. You ought to be obliged to me for telling you." "So I am," said Will, abruptly, speaking with that kind of double soul which belongs to dreamers who answer questions. "I expect to hear of the marriage," said Rosamond, playfully. "Never! You will never hear of the marriage!" With those words uttered impetuously, Will rose, put out his hand to Rosamond, still with the air of a somnambulist, and went away. When his was gone, Rosamond left his chair and walked to the other end of the room, leaning when Rosamond got there against a chiffonniere, and looking out of the window wearily. Rosamond was oppressed by ennui, and by that dissatisfaction which in women's minds is continually turning into a trivial jealousy, referring to no real claims, springing from no deeper passion than the vague exactingness of egoism, and yet capable of impelling action as well as speech. "There really is nothing to care for much," said poor Rosamond inwardly, thinking of the family at Quallingham, who did not write to Rosamond; and that perhaps Tertius when Tertius came home would tease Rosamond about expenses. Rosamond had already secretly disobeyed Tertius by asking Rosamond father to help them, and Tertius had ended decisively by saying, "I am more likely to want help Rosamond."
