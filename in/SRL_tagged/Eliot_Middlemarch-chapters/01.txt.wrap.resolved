"Since I can do no good because a woman, Reach constantly at something that is near it. --The Maid's Tragedy: BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER. Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress. Miss Brooke hand and wrist were so finely formed that Miss Brooke could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and Miss Brooke profile as well as Miss Brooke stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from Miss Brooke plain garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave Miss Brooke the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,--or from one of our elder poets,--in a paragraph of to-day's newspaper. Miss Brooke was usually spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that Miss Brooke sister Celia had more common-sense. Nevertheless, Miss Brooke wore scarcely more trimmings; and it was only to close observers that Miss Brooke dress differed from her sister Celia's, and had a shade of coquetry in its arrangements; for Miss Brooke's plain dressing was due to mixed conditions, in most of which Brooke shared. The pride of being ladies had something to do with The pride of being ladies: the Brooke connections, though not exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably "good:" if you inquired backward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring or parcel-tying forefathers--anything lower than an admiral or a clergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a respectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a parlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster's daughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made show in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was required for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such reasons would have been enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious feeling; but in Miss Brooke's case, religion alone would have determined religion alone; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all Celia sister's sentiments, only infusing religion alone with that common-sense which is able to accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea knew many passages of Pascal's Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart; and to Dorothea the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity, made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for Bedlam. Dorothea could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and artificial protrusions of drapery. Dorothea mind was theoretic, and yearned by Her mind nature after some lofty conception of the world which might frankly include the parish of Tipton and Dorothea own rule of conduct there; Dorothea was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing whatever seemed to Dorothea to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom, to make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a quarter where Dorothea had not sought retractations. Certainly such elements in the character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with Dorothea lot, and hinder retractations from being decided according to custom, by good looks, vanity, and merely canine affection. With all this, Dorothea, the elder of the sisters, was not yet twenty, and she, the elder of the sisters had both been educated, since she, the elder of the sisters were about twelve years old and had lost she, the elder of the sisters parents, on plans at once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and afterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, she, the elder of the sisters bachelor uncle and guardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of she, the elder of the sisters orphaned condition. It was hardly a year since she, the elder of the sisters had come to live at Tipton Grange with she, the elder of the sisters uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous opinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in He younger years, and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke's conclusions were as difficult to predict as the weather: Mr. Brooke's conclusions was only safe to say that He would act with benevolent intentions, and that He would spend as little money as possible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax about all a man own interests except the retention of a man snuff-box, concerning which a man was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch. In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in abeyance; but in Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and virtues, turning sometimes into impatience of Mr. Brooke uncle's talk or a man way of "letting things be" on a man estate, and making Mr. Brooke long all the more for the time when Mr. Brooke would be of age and have some command of money for generous schemes. Mr. Brooke was regarded as an heiress; for not only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from the sisters parents, but if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke's estate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year--a rental which seemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel's late conduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities of genteel life. And how should Dorothea not marry?--a girl so handsome and with such prospects? Nothing could hinder it but Mr. Brooke love of extremes, and Mr. Brooke insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a wary man to hesitate before a wary man to hesitate made Mr. Brooke an offer, or even might lead Mr. Brooke at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick laborer and prayed fervidly as if Mr. Brooke thought Mr. Brooke living in the time of the Apostles--who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist, and of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the application of Such a wife income which would interfere with political economy and the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice before a man risked a man in such fellowship. Women were expected to have weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic life was, that opinions were not acted on. Sane people did what Sane people neighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know and avoid Sane people. The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers, was generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and innocent-looking, while Miss Brooke's large eyes seemed, like Miss Brooke religion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with Miss Brooke, Miss Brooke was knowing and worldly-wise; so much subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of blazonry or clock-face for it. Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against Miss Brooke by this alarming hearsay, found that Miss Brooke had a charm unaccountably reconcilable with it. Most men thought Miss Brooke bewitching when Miss Brooke was on horseback. Miss Brooke loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the country, and when Miss Brooke eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure Miss Brooke looked very little like a devotee. Riding was an indulgence which Miss Brooke allowed Miss Brooke in spite of conscientious qualms; Miss Brooke felt that Miss Brooke enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to renouncing it. Miss Brooke was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it was pretty to see how Miss Brooke imagination adorned Miss Brooke sister Celia with attractions altogether superior to Miss Brooke own, and if any gentleman appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of seeing Mr. Brooke, Miss Brooke concluded that he must be in love with Celia: Sir James Chettam, for example, whom Miss Brooke constantly considered from Celia's point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for Celia to accept he. That he should be regarded as a suitor to Miss Brooke would have seemed to Miss Brooke a ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all Dorothea eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas about marriage. Dorothea felt sure that Dorothea would have accepted the judicious Hooker, if Dorothea had been born in time to save him from that wretched mistake him made in matrimony; or John Milton when him blindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits it would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome baronet, who said "Exactly" to Dorothea remarks even when Dorothea expressed uncertainty,--how could him affect Dorothea as a lover? The really delightful marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and could teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it. These peculiarities of Dorothea's character caused Mr. Brooke to be all the more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some middle-aged lady as guide and companion to Dorothea's character nieces. But he himself dreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for such a position, that he allowed he to be dissuaded by Dorothea's objections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world--that is to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector's wife, and the small group of gentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire. So Mr. Brooke Mr. Brooke presided in Mr. Brooke uncle's household, and did not at all dislike Mr. Brooke new authority, with the homage that belonged to her new authority. Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another gentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt some venerating expectation. This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon, noted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many years to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also as a man of wealth enough to give lustre to Sir James Chettam piety, and having views of Sir James Chettam own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication of Sir James Chettam book. Sir James Chettam very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be measured without a precise chronology of scholarship. Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which Dorothea had set going in the village, and was taking Dorothea usual place in the pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on finishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which Dorothea delighted in), when Celia, who had been watching Dorothea with a hesitating desire to propose something, said-- "Dorothea, dear, if you don't mind--if you are not very busy--suppose we looked at mamma's jewels to-day, and divided mamma's jewels? It is exactly six months to-day since uncle gave mamma's jewels to you, and you have not looked at mamma's jewels yet." Miss Brooke's face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full presence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and principle; two associated facts which might show a mysterious electricity if you touched mamma's jewels incautiously. To Dorothea relief, Dorothea's eyes were full of laughter as Dorothea looked up. "What a wonderful little almanac you are, Miss Brooke! Is it six calendar or six lunar months?" "It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April when uncle gave them to uncle. You know, uncle said that uncle had forgotten them till then. I believe you have never thought of them since you locked them up in the cabinet here." "Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know." Dorothea spoke in a full cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. Dorothea had Dorothea pencil in Dorothea hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin. Miss Brooke colored, and looked very grave. "I think, dear, we are wanting in respect to mamma's memory, to put them by and take no notice of them. And," Miss Brooke added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of mortification, "necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who was stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments. And Christians generally--surely there are women in heaven now who wore jewels." Miss Brooke was conscious of some mental strength when Miss Brooke really applied Miss Brooke to argument. "You would like to wear them?" exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished discovery animating Miss Brooke whole person with a dramatic action which Miss Brooke had caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments. "Of course, then, let us have the ornaments out. Why did you not tell me before? But the keys, the keys!" Miss Brooke pressed Miss Brooke hands against the sides of Miss Brooke head and seemed to despair of Miss Brooke memory. "They are here," said Miss Brooke, with whom this explanation had been long meditated and prearranged. "Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box." The casket was soon open before They, and the various jewels spread out, making a bright parterre on the table. It was no great collection, but a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest that was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in exquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it. Dorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened the necklace round Dorothea sister's neck, where the necklace fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the circle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Miss Brooke's head and neck, and Dorothea could see that the necklace did, in the pier-glass opposite. "There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But this cross you must wear with your dark dresses." Miss Brooke was trying not to smile with pleasure. "O Dodo, you must keep this cross you must wear with your dark dresses yourself." "No, no, dear, no," said Dorothea, putting up Dorothea hand with careless deprecation. "Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you--in your black dress, now," said Miss Brooke, insistingly. "You _might_ wear that." "Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing I would wear as a trinket." Dorothea shuddered slightly. "Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it," said Miss Brooke, uneasily. "No, dear, no," said Dorothea, stroking Dorothea sister's cheek. "Souls have complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another." "But you might like to keep it for mamma's sake." "No, I have other things of mamma's--her sandal-wood box which I am so fond of--plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear. We need discuss they no longer. There--take away your property." Miss Brooke felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of superiority in this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of an unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution. "But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will never wear ornaments?" "Nay, Miss Brooke, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to keep you in countenance. If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I should feel as if I had been pirouetting. the world would go round with me, and I should not know how to walk." Miss Brooke had unclasped the necklace and drawn the necklace off. "It would be a little tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit you better," Miss Brooke said, with some satisfaction. The complete unfitness of the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Miss Brooke happier in taking it. Miss Brooke was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed a fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a cloud sent a bright gleam over the table. "How very beautiful these gems are!" said Dorothea, under a new current of feeling, as sudden as a bright gleam. "It is strange how deeply colors seem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why gems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. gems look like fragments of heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful than any of gems." "And there is a bracelet to match it," said Miss Brooke. "We did not notice this at first." "They are lovely," said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on Dorothea finely turned finger and wrist, and holding They towards the window on a level with Dorothea eyes. All the while Dorothea thought was trying to justify Dorothea delight in the colors by merging them in Dorothea mystic religious joy. "You _would_ like those, Dorothea," said Miss Brooke, rather falteringly, beginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness, and also that emeralds would suit her sister own complexion even better than purple amethysts. "You must keep that ring and bracelet--if nothing else. But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet." "Yes! I will keep these--that ring and bracelet," said Dorothea. Then, letting Dorothea hand fall on the table, Dorothea said in another tone--"Yet what miserable men find such things, and work at miserable men, and sell miserable men!" Dorothea paused again, and Miss Brooke thought that her sister was going to renounce the ornaments, as in consistency her sister ought to do. "Yes, dear, I will keep these," said Dorothea, decidedly. "But take all the rest away, and The casket." her sister took up her sister without removing the jewels, and still looking at the jewels. her sister thought of often having the jewels by her sister, to feed her sister eye at these little fountains of pure color. "Shall you wear the jewels in company?" said Celia, who was watching her sister with real curiosity as to what her sister would do. Dorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her sister imaginative adornment of those whom her sister loved, there darted now and then a keen discernment, which was not without a scorching quality. If Mr. Brooke ever attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward fire. "Perhaps," her sister said, rather haughtily. "I cannot tell to what level I may sink." Miss Brooke blushed, and was unhappy: Miss Brooke saw that Miss Brooke had offended her sister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the ornaments which Miss Brooke put back into the box and carried away. Dorothea too was unhappy, as Dorothea went on with Dorothea plan-drawing, questioning the purity of Dorothea own feeling and speech in the scene which had ended with that little explosion. Miss Brooke's consciousness told Miss Brooke that Miss Brooke had not been at all in the wrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that Miss Brooke should have asked that question, and Miss Brooke repeated to Miss Brooke that Dorothea was inconsistent: either Miss Brooke should have taken Miss Brooke full share of the jewels, or, after what Miss Brooke had said, Miss Brooke should have renounced the jewels altogether. "I am sure--at least, I trust," thought Miss Brooke, "that the wearing of a necklace will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see that I should be bound by Dorothea's opinions now we are going into society, though of course Miss Brooke ought to be bound by society. But Dorothea is not always consistent." Thus Celia, mutely bending over Dorothea tapestry, until Dorothea heard her sister calling Dorothea. "Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great architect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces." As Miss Brooke bent over the paper, Dorothea put Dorothea cheek against her sister's arm caressingly. Miss Brooke understood the action. Dorothea saw that Miss Brooke had been in the wrong, and Miss Brooke pardoned Miss Brooke. Since they could remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in the attitude of Miss Brooke's mind towards her sister. The younger had always worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private opinions?
