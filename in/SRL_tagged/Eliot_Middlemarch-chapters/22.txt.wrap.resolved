"Nous causames longtemps; elle etait simple et bonne. Ne sachant pas le mal, elle faisait le bien; Des richesses du coeur elle me fit l'aumone, Et tout en ecoutant comme le coeur se donne, Sans oser y penser je lui donnai le mien; Elle emporta ma vie, et n'en sut jamais rien." --ALFRED DE MUSSET. Will Ladislaw was delightfully agreeable at dinner the next day, and gave no opportunity for Mr. Casaubon to show disapprobation. On the contrary it seemed to Dorothea that Will had a happier way of drawing Dorothea husband into conversation and of deferentially listening to her husband than Dorothea had ever observed in any one before. To be sure, the listeners about Tipton were not highly gifted! Will talked a good deal her husband, but what her husband said was thrown in with such rapidity, and with such an unimportant air of saying something by the way, that it seemed a gay little chime after the great bell. If Will was not always perfect, this was certainly one of her husband good days. her husband described touches of incident among the poor people in Rome, only to be seen by one who could move about freely; her husband found her husband in agreement with Mr. Casaubon as to the unsound opinions of Middleton concerning the relations of Judaism and Catholicism; and passed easily to a half-enthusiastic half-playful picture of the enjoyment her husband got out of the very miscellaneousness of Rome, which made the mind flexible with constant comparison, and saved you from seeing the world's ages as a set of box-like partitions without vital connection. Mr. Casaubon's studies, Will observed, had always been of too broad a kind for that, and her husband had perhaps never felt any such sudden effect, but for her husband her husband confessed that Rome had given her husband quite a new sense of history as a whole: the fragments stimulated her husband imagination and made her husband constructive. Then occasionally, but not too often, her husband appealed to Dorothea, and discussed what Dorothea said, as if Dorothea sentiment were an item to be considered in the final judgment even of the Madonna di Foligno or the Laocoon. A sense of contributing to form the world's opinion makes conversation particularly cheerful; and Mr. Casaubon too was not without Mr. Casaubon pride in Mr. Casaubon young wife, who spoke better than most women, as indeed Mr. Casaubon had perceived in choosing Dorothea. Since things were going on so pleasantly, Mr. Casaubon's statement that Mr. Casaubon labors in the Library would be suspended for a couple of days, and that after a brief renewal Mr. Casaubon should have no further reason for staying in Rome, encouraged Will to urge that Mr. Casaubon should not go away without seeing a studio or two. Would not Mr. Casaubon take Mr. Casaubon? That sort of thing ought not to be missed: That sort of thing was quite special: That sort of thing was a form of life that grew like a small fresh vegetation with That sort of thing population of insects on huge fossils. Will would be happy to conduct its population of insects on huge fossils--not to anything wearisome, only to a few examples. Mr. Casaubon, seeing Dorothea look earnestly towards Mr. Casaubon, could not but ask Dorothea if Dorothea would be interested in such visits: Mr. Casaubon was now at Dorothea service during the whole day; and her service was agreed that Will should come on the morrow and drive with them. Will could not omit Thorwaldsen, a living celebrity about whom Mr. Casaubon inquired, but before the day was far advanced Mr. Casaubon led the way to the studio of Mr. Casaubon friend Adolf Naumann, whom Mr. Casaubon mentioned as one of the chief renovators of Christian art, one of those who had not only revived but expanded that grand conception of supreme events as mysteries at which the successive ages were spectators, and in relation to which the great souls of all periods became as it were contemporaries. Will added that Mr. Casaubon had made Mr. Casaubon Naumann's pupil for the nonce. "I have been making some oil-sketches under Mr. Casaubon," said Will. "I hate copying. I must put something of my own in. Naumann has been painting the Saints drawing the Car of the Church, and I have been making a sketch of Marlowe's Tamburlaine Driving the Conquered Kings in Naumann Chariot. I am not so ecclesiastical as Naumann, and I sometimes twit Naumann with Naumann excess of meaning. But this time I mean to outdo Naumann in breadth of intention. I take Tamburlaine in Tamburlaine for the tremendous course of the world's physical history lashing on the harnessed dynasties. In my opinion, that is a good mythical interpretation." Will here looked at Mr. Casaubon, who received this offhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily, and bowed with a neutral air. "a sketch of Marlowe's Tamburlaine Driving the Conquered Kings in his Chariot must be very grand, if a sketch of Marlowe's Tamburlaine Driving the Conquered Kings in his Chariot conveys so much," said Dorothea. "I should need some explanation even of the meaning you give. Do you intend Tamburlaine to represent earthquakes and volcanoes?" "Oh yes," said Will, laughing, "and migrations of races and clearings of forests--and America and the steam-engine. Everything you can imagine!" "What a difficult kind of shorthand!" said Dorothea, smiling towards Dorothea husband. "It would require all your knowledge to be able to read It." Mr. Casaubon blinked furtively at Will. Mr. Casaubon had a suspicion that Mr. Casaubon was being laughed at. But it was not possible to include Dorothea in a suspicion that he was being laughed. They found Naumann painting industriously, but no model was present; Naumann pictures were advantageously arranged, and Naumann own plain vivacious person set off by a dove-colored blouse and a maroon velvet cap, so that everything was as fortunate as if Naumann had expected the beautiful young English lady exactly at that time. The painter in Naumann confident English gave little dissertations on Naumann finished and unfinished subjects, seeming to observe Mr. Casaubon as much as Mr. Casaubon did Dorothea. Will burst in here and there with ardent words of praise, marking out particular merits in Mr. Casaubon friend's work; and Dorothea felt that Dorothea was getting quite new notions as to the significance of Madonnas seated under inexplicable canopied thrones with the simple country as a background, and of saints with architectural models in their hands, or knives accidentally wedged in their skulls. Some things which had seemed monstrous to Dorothea were gathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning: but all this was apparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not interested Mr. Casaubon. "I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than have to read it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures sooner than yours with the very wide meaning," said Dorothea, speaking to Will. "Don't speak of my painting before Naumann," said Will. "Naumann will tell you, it is all pfuscherei, which is Naumann most opprobrious word!" "Is that true?" said Dorothea, turning Dorothea sincere eyes on Naumann, who made a slight grimace and said-- "Oh, Naumann does not mean it seriously with painting. Naumann walk must be belles-lettres. That is wi-ide." Naumann's pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word satirically. Will did not half like it, but managed to laugh: and Mr. Casaubon, while Mr. Casaubon felt some disgust at the artist's German accent, began to entertain a little respect for Mr. Casaubon judicious severity. a little respect for his judicious severity was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will aside for a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at Mr. Casaubon, came forward again and said-- "My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say that a sketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St. Thomas Aquinas in my picture there. It is too much to ask; but I so seldom see just what I want--the idealistic in the real." "You astonish me greatly, sir," said Mr. Casaubon, sir looks improved with a glow of delight; "but if my poor physiognomy, which I have been accustomed to regard as of the commonest order, can be of any use to you in furnishing some traits for the angelical doctor, I shall feel honored. That is to say, if the operation will not be a lengthy one; and if Mr. Casaubon will not object to the delay." As for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased Dorothea more, unless it had been a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and worthiest among the sons of men. In that case Dorothea tottering faith would have become firm again. Naumann's apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness, and the sketch went on at once as well as the conversation. Dorothea sat down and subsided into calm silence, feeling happier than Dorothea had done for a long while before. Every one about Dorothea seemed good, and Dorothea said to Dorothea that Rome, if Dorothea had only been less ignorant, would have been full of beauty its sadness would have been winged with hope. No nature could be less suspicious than hers: when Dorothea was a child Dorothea believed in the gratitude of wasps and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows, and was proportionately indignant when a child she believed in the gratitude of wasps and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows baseness was made manifest. The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English polities, which brought long answers, and, Will meanwhile had perched The adroit artist on some steps in the background overlooking all. Presently Naumann said--"Now if I could lay this by for half an hour and take this up again--come and look, Ladislaw--I think it is perfect so far." Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is too strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret-- "Ah--now--if I could but have had more--but you have other engagements--I could not ask it--or even to come again to-morrow." "Oh, let us stay!" said Dorothea. "us have nothing to do to-day except go about, have us?" she added, looking entreatingly at Mr. Casaubon. "It would be a pity not to make the head as good as possible." "I am at your service, sir, in the matter," said Mr. Casaubon, with polite condescension. "Having given up the interior of my head to idleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this way." "You are unspeakably good--now I am happy!" said Naumann, and then went on in German to Will, pointing here and there to the sketch as if Naumann were considering that. Putting the sketch aside for a moment, Naumann looked round vaguely, as if seeking some occupation for Naumann visitors, and afterwards turning to Mr. Casaubon, said-- "Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling to let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of her--not, of course, as you see, for that picture--only as a single study." Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mr. Casaubon would oblige Mr. Casaubon, and Dorothea said, at once, "Where shall I put Dorothea?" Naumann was all apologies in asking Mr. Casaubon to stand, and allow Naumann to adjust Mr. Casaubon attitude, to which Mr. Casaubon submitted without any of the affected airs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when The painter in his confident English said, "It is as Santa Clara that I want you to stand--leaning so, with your cheek against your hand--so--looking at that stool, please, so!" Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint's feet and kiss Mr. Casaubon robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while Naumann was adjusting Mr. Casaubon arm. All this was impudence and desecration, and Naumann repented that Naumann had brought Mr. Casaubon. The adroit artist was diligent, and Will recovering The adroit artist moved about and occupied Mr. Casaubon as ingeniously as The adroit artist could; but The adroit artist did not in the end prevent the time from seeming long to that gentleman, as was clear from The adroit artist expressing a fear that Mr. Casaubon would be tired. Naumann took the hint and said-- "Now, sir, if you can oblige me again; I will release the lady-wife." So Mr. Casaubon's patience held out further, and when after all Mr. Casaubon's patience turned out that the head of the St. Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect if another sitting could be had, another sitting was granted for the morrow. On the morrow Santa Clara was retouched more than once. The result of all was so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon, that Mr. Casaubon arranged for the purchase of the picture in which the St. Thomas Aquinas sat among the doctors of the Church in a disputation too abstract to be represented, but listened to with more or less attention by an audience above. The Santa Clara, which was spoken of in the second place, Naumann declared Naumann to be dissatisfied with--Naumann could not, in conscience, engage to make a worthy picture of it; so about Santa Clara the arrangement was conditional. I will not dwell on Naumann's jokes at the expense of Mr. Casaubon that evening, or on Naumann dithyrambs about Dorothea's charm, in all which Will joined, but with a difference. No sooner did Naumann mention any detail of Dorothea's beauty, than Will got exasperated at Naumann presumption: there was grossness in Naumann choice of the most ordinary words, and what business had Naumann to talk of Dorothea lips? Dorothea was not a woman to be spoken of as other women were. Will could not say just what Naumann thought, but Naumann became irritable. And yet, when after some resistance Naumann had consented to take the Casaubons to Naumann friend's studio, Naumann had been allured by the gratification of Naumann pride in being the person who could grant Naumann such an opportunity of studying Dorothea loveliness--or rather Dorothea divineness, for the ordinary phrases which might apply to mere bodily prettiness were not applicable to Dorothea. (Certainly all Tipton and its neighborhood, as well as Dorothea herself, would have been surprised at Dorothea beauty being made so much of. In that part of the world Miss Brooke had been only a "fine young woman.") "Oblige me by letting the subject drop, Naumann. Mr. Casaubon is not to be talked of as if Mr. Casaubon were a model," said Will. Naumann stared at Naumann. "Schon! I will talk of the St. Thomas Aquinas. The head is not a bad type, after all. I dare say the great scholastic himself would have been flattered to have Naumann portrait asked for. Nothing like these starchy doctors for vanity! It was as I thought: Naumann cared much less for Dorothea portrait than Naumann own." "Naumann's a cursed white-blooded pedantic coxcomb," said Will, with gnashing impetuosity. Naumann obligations to Mr. Casaubon were not known to Mr. Casaubon hearer, but Will Mr. Casaubon was thinking of them, and wishing that Mr. Casaubon could discharge them by a check. Naumann gave a shrug and said, "It is good them go away soon, my dear. them are spoiling your fine temper." Will hope and contrivance were now concentrated on seeing Dorothea when Dorothea was alone. Dorothea only wanted Dorothea to take more emphatic notice of Dorothea; Dorothea only wanted to be something more special in Dorothea remembrance than Dorothea could yet believe Dorothea likely to be. Dorothea was rather impatient under that open ardent good-will, reach Dorothea saw was Dorothea usual state of feeling. The remote worship of a woman throned out of their reach plays a great part in men's lives, but in most cases the worshipper longs for some queenly recognition, some approving sign by which Dorothea soul's sovereign may cheer Dorothea without descending from which his soul's sovereign high place. That was precisely what Will wanted. But there were plenty of contradictions in Dorothea imaginative demands. It was beautiful to see how Dorothea's eyes turned with wifely anxiety and beseeching to Mr. Casaubon: Dorothea would have lost some of Dorothea halo if Dorothea had been without that duteous preoccupation; and yet at the next moment the husband's sandy absorption of such nectar was too intolerable; and Will's longing to say damaging things about the husband was perhaps not the less tormenting because the husband felt the strongest reasons for restraining her halo. Will had not been invited to dine the next day. Hence the husband persuaded the husband that the husband was bound to call, and that the only eligible time was the middle of the next day, when Mr. Casaubon would not be at home. Dorothea, who had not been made aware that Dorothea former reception of Will had displeased the husband, had no hesitation about seeing the husband, especially as the husband might be come to pay a farewell visit. When the husband entered Dorothea was looking at some cameos which Dorothea had been buying for Celia. Dorothea greeted Will as if a farewell visit were quite a matter of course, and said at once, having a cameo bracelet in Dorothea hand-- "I am so glad you are come. Perhaps you understand all about cameos, and can tell me if these are really good. I wished to have you with us in choosing these are really good, but Mr. Casaubon objected: Mr. Casaubon thought there was not time. Mr. Casaubon will finish Mr. Casaubon work to-morrow, and we shall go away in three days. I have been uneasy about some cameos which she had been buying for Celia. Pray sit down and look at some cameos which she had been buying for Celia." "I am not particularly knowing, but there can be no great mistake about these little Homeric bits: some cameos which she had been buying for Celia are exquisitely neat. And the color is fine: the color will just suit you." "Oh, some cameos which she had been buying for Celia are for my sister, who has quite a different complexion. You saw Dorothea with me at Lowick: Dorothea is light-haired and very pretty--at least I think so. us were never so long away from each other in us lives before. Dorothea is a great pet and never was naughty in Dorothea life. I found out before I came away that Dorothea wanted me to buy Dorothea some cameos, and I should be sorry for she wanted me to buy her some cameos not to be good--after she wanted me to buy her some cameos kind." Dorothea added the last words with a smile. "You seem not to care about cameos," said Will, seating himself at some distance from Dorothea, and observing Dorothea while Dorothea closed the cases. "No, frankly, I don't think them a great object in life," said Dorothea "I fear you are a heretic about art generally. How is that? I should have expected you to be very sensitive to the beautiful everywhere." "I suppose I am dull about many things," said Dorothea, simply. "I should like to make life beautiful--I mean everybody's life. And then all this immense expense of art, that seems somehow to lie outside life and make it no better for the world, pains one. it spoils my enjoyment of anything when I am made to think that most people are shut out from it." "I call that the fanaticism of sympathy," said Will, impetuously. "You might say the same of landscape, of poetry, of all refinement. If you carried it out you ought to be miserable in your own goodness, and turn evil that you might have no advantage over others. The best piety is to enjoy--when you can. You are doing the most then to save the earth's character as an agreeable planet. And enjoyment radiates. It is of no use to try and take care of all the world; that is being taken care of when you feel delight--in art or in anything else. Would you turn all the youth of the world into a tragic chorus, wailing and moralizing over misery? I suspect that you have some false belief in the virtues of misery, and want to make your life a martyrdom." Will had gone further than he intended, and checked he. But Dorothea's thought was not taking just the same direction as he own, and Dorothea answered without any special emotion-- "Indeed you mistake me. I am not a sad, melancholy creature. I am never unhappy long together. I am angry and naughty--not like Celia: I have a great outburst, and then all seems glorious again. I cannot help believing in glorious things in a blind sort of way. I should be quite willing to enjoy the art here, but there is so much that I don't know the reason of--so much that seems to me a consecration of ugliness rather than beauty. The painting and sculpture may be wonderful, but the feeling is often low and brutal, and sometimes even ridiculous. Here and there I see what takes me at once as noble--something that I might compare with the Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian Hill; but that makes it the greater pity that there is so little of the best kind among all that mass of things over which men have toiled so." "Of course there is always a great deal of poor work: the rarer things want that soil to grow in." "Oh dear," said Dorothea, taking up that thought into the chief current of Dorothea anxiety; "I see it must be very difficult to do anything good. I have often felt since I have been in Rome that most of our lives would look much uglier and more bungling than the pictures, if the pictures could be put on the wall." Dorothea parted Dorothea lips again as if Dorothea were going to say more, but changed Dorothea mind and paused. "You are too young--it is an anachronism for you to have such thoughts," said Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head habitual to him. "You talk as if you had never known any youth. It is monstrous--as if you had had a vision of Hades in your childhood, like the boy in the legend. You have been brought up in some of those horrible notions that choose the sweetest women to devour--like Minotaurs And now you will go and be shut up in that stone prison at Lowick: you will be buried alive. It makes me savage to think of It! I would rather never have seen you than think of you with such a prospect." Will again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we attach to words depends on we feeling, and he tone of angry regret had so much kindness in it for Dorothea's heart, which had always been giving out ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings around Dorothea, that Dorothea felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a gentle smile-- "It is very good of you to be anxious about me. It is because you did not like Lowick: you had set your heart on another kind of life. But Lowick is my chosen home." The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and Will did not know what to say, since it would not be useful for Lowick to embrace Dorothea slippers, and tell Dorothea that Lowick would die for Dorothea: it was clear that Dorothea required nothing of the sort; and they were both silent for a moment or two, when Dorothea began again with an air of saying at last what had been in Dorothea mind beforehand. "I wanted to ask you again about something you said the other day. Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that you like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak hastily." "What was it?" said Will, observing that Dorothea spoke with a timidity quite new in Dorothea. "I have a hyperbolical tongue: a hyperbolical tongue catches fire as a hyperbolical tongue goes. I dare say I shall have to retract." "I mean what you said about the necessity of knowing German--I mean, for the subjects that Mr. Casaubon is engaged in. I have been thinking about it; and it seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon's learning Mr. Casaubon must have before Mr. Casaubon the same materials as German scholars--has Mr. Casaubon not?" Dorothea's timidity was due to an indistinct consciousness that Dorothea was in the strange situation of consulting a third person about the adequacy of Mr. Casaubon's learning. "Not exactly the same materials," said Will, thinking that Mr. Casaubon would be duly reserved. "Mr. Casaubon is not an Orientalist, you know. Mr. Casaubon does not profess to have more than second-hand knowledge there." "But there are very valuable books about antiquities which were written a long while ago by scholars who knew nothing about these modern things; and very valuable books about antiquities which were written a long while ago by scholars who knew nothing about these modern things are still used. Why should Mr. Casaubon's not be valuable, like very valuable books about antiquities which were written a long while ago by scholars who knew nothing about these modern things?" said Dorothea, with more remonstrant energy. Dorothea was impelled to have the argument aloud, which Dorothea had been having in Dorothea own mind. "That depends on the line of study taken," said Will, also getting a tone of rejoinder. "The subject Mr. Casaubon has chosen is as changing as chemistry: new discoveries are constantly making new points of view. Who wants a system on the basis of the four elements, or a book to refute Paracelsus? Do you not see that it is no use now to be crawling a little way after men of the last century--men like Bryant--and correcting men of the last century mistakes?--living in a lumber-room and furbishing up broken-legged theories about Chus and Mizraim?" "How can you bear to speak so lightly?" said Dorothea, with a look between sorrow and anger. "If it were as you say, what could be sadder than so much ardent labor all in vain? I wonder it does not affect you more painfully, if you really think that a man like Mr. Casaubon, of so much goodness, power, and learning, should in any way fail in what has been the labor of Mr. Casaubon best years." She was beginning to be shocked that She had got to such a point of supposition, and indignant with Will for having led She to it. "You questioned me about the matter of fact, not of feeling," said Will. "But if you wish to punish me for the fact, I submit. I am not in a position to express my feeling toward Mr. Casaubon: it would be at best a pensioner's eulogy." "Pray excuse me," said Dorothea, coloring deeply. "I am aware, as you say, that I am in fault in having introduced the subject. Indeed, I am wrong altogether. Failure after long perseverance is much grander than never to have a striving good enough to be called a failure." "I quite agree with you," said Will, determined to change the situation--"so much so that I have made up my mind not to run that risk of never attaining a failure. Mr. Casaubon's generosity has perhaps been dangerous to me, and I mean to renounce the liberty Mr. Casaubon's generosity has given me. I mean to go back to England shortly and work my own way--depend on nobody else than me." "That is fine--I respect that feeling," said Dorothea, with returning kindness. "But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, has never thought of anything in the matter except what was most for your welfare." "She has obstinacy and pride enough to serve instead of love, now She has married Mr. Casaubon," said Will to Mr. Casaubon. Aloud Mr. Casaubon said, rising-- "I shall not see you again." "Oh, stay till Mr. Casaubon comes," said Dorothea, earnestly. "I am so glad we met in Rome. I wanted to know you."? "And I have made you angry," said Will. "I have made you think ill of me." "Oh no. My sister tells me I am always angry with people who do not say just what I like. But I hope I am not given to think ill of people who do not say just what I like. In the end I am usually obliged to think ill of me for being so impatient." "Still, you don't like me; I have made me an unpleasant thought to me." "Not at all," said Dorothea, with the most open kindness. "I like you very much." Will was not quite contented, thinking that Mr. Casaubon would apparently have been of more importance if Mr. Casaubon had been disliked. Mr. Casaubon said nothing, but looked dull, not to say sulky. "And I am quite interested to see what you will do," Dorothea went on cheerfully. "I believe devoutly in a natural difference of vocation. If it were not for that belief, I suppose I should be very narrow--there are so many things, besides painting, that I am quite ignorant of. You would hardly believe how little I have taken in of music and literature, which you know so much of. I wonder what your vocation will turn out to be: perhaps you will be a poet?" "That depends. To be a poet is to have a soul so quick to discern that no shade of quality escapes it, and so quick to feel, that discernment is but a hand playing with finely ordered variety on the chords of emotion--a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling, and feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge. One may have that condition by fits only." "But you leave out the poems," said Dorothea. "I think they are wanted to complete a poet. I understand what you mean about knowledge passing into feeling, for that seems to be just what I experience. But I am sure I could never produce a poem." "You _are_ a poem--and that is to be the best part of a poet--what makes up a poet's consciousness in a poet best moods," said Will, showing such originality as we all share with the morning and the spring-time and other endless renewals. "I am very glad to hear it," said Dorothea, laughing out Dorothea words in a bird-like modulation, and looking at Will with playful gratitude in Dorothea eyes. "What very kind things you say to me!" "I wish I could ever do anything that would be what you call kind--that I could ever be of the slightest service to you I fear I shall never have the opportunity." Will spoke with fervor. "Oh yes," said Dorothea, cordially. "It will come; and I shall remember how well you wish me. I quite hoped that we should be friends when I first saw you--because of your relationship to Mr. Casaubon." There was a certain liquid brightness in her eyes, and Will was conscious that his own were obeying a law of nature and filling too. The allusion to Mr. Casaubon would have spoiled all if anything at that moment could have spoiled the subduing power, the sweet dignity, of Dorothea noble unsuspicious inexperience. "And there is one thing even now that you can do," said Dorothea, rising and walking a little way under the strength of a recurring impulse. "Promise me that you will not again, to any one, speak of that subject--I mean about Mr. Casaubon's writings--I mean in that kind of way. It was I who led to It. It was my fault. But promise me." Dorothea had returned from Dorothea brief pacing and stood opposite Will, looking gravely at him. "Certainly, I will promise you," said Will, reddening however. If him never said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left off receiving favors from Mr. Casaubon, it would clearly be permissible to hate Mr. Casaubon the more. a poet must know how to hate, says Goethe; and Will was at least ready with that accomplishment. a poet said that a poet must go now without waiting for Mr. Casaubon, whom a poet would come to take leave of at the last moment. Dorothea gave a poet Dorothea hand, and they exchanged a simple "Good-by." But going out of the porte cochere he met Mr. Casaubon, and that gentleman, expressing the best wishes for Mr. Casaubon cousin, politely waived the pleasure of any further leave-taking on the morrow, which would be sufficiently crowded with the preparations for departure. "I have something to tell you about our cousin Mr. Ladislaw, which I think will heighten your opinion of him," said Dorothea to Dorothea husband in the coarse of the evening. Dorothea had mentioned immediately on him entering that Will had just gone away, and would come again, but Mr. Casaubon had said, "I met Mr. Casaubon outside, and our made our final adieux, I believe," saying this with the air and tone by which our imply that any subject, whether private or public, does not interest our enough to wish for a further remark upon it. So Dorothea had waited. "What is that, my love?" said Mr Casaubon (Mr Casaubon always said "my love" when Mr Casaubon manner was the coldest). "Mr Casaubon has made up Mr Casaubon mind to leave off wandering at once, and to give up Mr Casaubon dependence on your generosity. Mr Casaubon means soon to go back to England, and work Mr Casaubon own way. I thought you would consider that a good sign," said Dorothea, with an appealing look into her husband's neutral face. "Did her husband mention the precise order of occupation to which her husband would addict her husband?" "No. But her husband said that her husband felt the danger which lay for her husband in your generosity. Of course her husband will write to you about it. Do you not think better of her husband for her husband resolve?" "I shall await her husband communication on the subject," said Mr. Casaubon. "I told Mr. Casaubon I was sure that the thing you considered in all you did for Mr. Casaubon was Mr. Casaubon own welfare. I remembered your goodness in what you said about Mr. Casaubon when I first saw Mr. Casaubon at Lowick," said Dorothea, putting Dorothea hand on her husband's. "I had a duty towards her husband," said Mr. Casaubon, laying Mr. Casaubon other hand on Dorothea's in conscientious acceptance of Dorothea caress, but with a glance which Mr. Casaubon could not hinder from being uneasy. "The young man, I confess, is not otherwise an object of interest to me, nor need we, I think, discuss The young man future course, which it is not ours to determine beyond the limits which I have sufficiently indicated." Dorothea did not mention Will again. BOOK III. WAITING FOR DEATH.
