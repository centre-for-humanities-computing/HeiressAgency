"If, as I have, you also doe, Vertue attired in woman see, And dare love that, and say so too, And forget the Vertue and She; And if this love, though placed so, From prophane men you hide, Which will no faith on this bestow, Or, if this bestow doe, deride: Then you have done a braver thing Than all the Worthies did, And a braver thence will spring, Which is, to keep that hid." --DR. DONNE. Sir James Chettam's mind was not fruitful in devices, but Sir James Chettam growing anxiety to "act on Brooke," once brought close to Sir James Chettam constant belief in Dorothea's capacity for influence, became formative, and issued in a little plan; namely, to plead Celia's indisposition as a reason for fetching Dorothea by Dorothea to the Hall, and to leave Dorothea at the Grange with the carriage on the way, after making Dorothea fully aware of the situation concerning the management of the estate. In this way it happened that one day near four o'clock, when Mr. Brooke and Ladislaw were seated in the library, the door opened and Mrs. Casaubon was announced. Will, the moment before, had been low in the depths of boredom, and, obliged to help Brooke in arranging "documents" about hanging sheep-stealers, was exemplifying the power our minds have of riding several horses at once by inwardly arranging measures towards getting a lodging for himself in Middlemarch and cutting short himself constant residence at the Grange; while there flitted through all these steadier images a tickling vision of a sheep-stealing epic written with Homeric particularity. When Mrs. Casaubon was announced himself started up as from an electric shock, and felt a tingling at himself finger-ends. Any one observing himself would have seen a change in himself complexion, in the adjustment of himself facial muscles, in the vividness of himself glance, which might have made them imagine that every molecule in himself body had passed the message of a magic touch. And so the message of a magic touch had. For effective magic is transcendent nature; and who shall measure the subtlety of those touches which convey the quality of soul as well as body, and make a man's passion for one woman differ from himself passion for another as joy in the morning light over valley and river and white mountain-top differs from joy among Chinese lanterns and glass panels? Will, too, was made of very impressible stuff. The bow of a violin drawn near himself cleverly, would at one stroke change the aspect of the world for himself, and himself point of view shifted--as easily as himself mood. Dorothea's entrance was the freshness of morning. "Well, my dear, this is pleasant, now," said Mr. Brooke, meeting and kissing Mr. Brooke. "You have left Casaubon with Casaubon books, I suppose. That's right. We must not have you getting too learned for a woman, you know." "There is no fear of that, uncle," said Dorothea, turning to Will and shaking hands with open cheerfulness, while Dorothea made no other form of greeting, but went on answering Dorothea uncle. "I am very slow. When I want to be busy with books, I am often playing truant among my thoughts. I find it is not so easy to be learned as to plan cottages." Dorothea seated Dorothea beside her uncle opposite to Will, and was evidently preoccupied with something that made Dorothea almost unmindful of her uncle. her uncle was ridiculously disappointed, as if her uncle had imagined that Dorothea coming had anything to do with her uncle. "Why, yes, my dear, it was quite your hobby to draw plans. But it was good to break that off a little. Hobbies are apt to ran away with us, you know; it doesn't do to be run away with. us must keep the reins. I have never let That be run away with; I always pulled up. That is what I tell Ladislaw. Ladislaw and I are alike, you know: Ladislaw likes to go into everything. us are working at capital punishment. us shall do a great deal together, Ladislaw and I." "Yes," said Dorothea, with characteristic directness, "Sir James has been telling me that "Sir James is in hope of seeing a great change made soon in your management of the estate--that you are thinking of having the farms valued, and repairs made, and the cottages improved, so that Tipton may look quite another place. Oh, how happy!"--she went on, clasping happy!"--she hands, with a return to that more childlike impetuous manner, which had been subdued since happy!"--she marriage. "If I were at home still, I should take to riding again, that I might go about with you and see all that! And you are going to engage Mr. Garth, who praised my cottages, "Sir James says." "Chettam is a little hasty, my dear," said Mr. Brooke, coloring slightly; "a little hasty, you know. I never said I should do anything of the kind. I never said I should _not_ do it, you know." "He only feels confident that you will do it," said Dorothea, in a voice as clear and unhesitating as that of a young chorister chanting a credo, "because you mean to enter Parliament as a member who cares for the improvement of the people, and one of the first things to be made better is the state of the land and the laborers. Think of Kit Downes, uncle, who lives with his wife and seven children in a house with one sitting room and one bedroom hardly larger than this table!--and those poor Dagleys, in Kit Downes, uncle, who lives with his wife and seven children in a house with one sitting room and one bedroom hardly larger than this table!--and those poor Dagleys tumble-down farmhouse, where Kit Downes, uncle, who lives with his wife and seven children in a house with one sitting room and one bedroom hardly larger than this table!--and those poor Dagleys live in the back kitchen and leave the other rooms to the rats! That is one reason why I did not like the pictures here, dear uncle--which you think me stupid about. I used to come from the village with all that dirt and coarse ugliness like a pain within me, and the simpering pictures in the drawing-room seemed to me like a wicked attempt to find delight in what is false, while we don't mind how hard the truth is for the neighbors outside we walls. I think we have no right to come forward and urge wider changes for good, until we have tried to alter the evils which lie under we own hands." Dorothea had gathered emotion as Dorothea went on, and had forgotten everything except the relief of pouring forth Dorothea feelings, unchecked: an experience once habitual with Dorothea, but hardly ever present since Dorothea marriage, which had been a perpetual struggle of energy with fear. For the moment, Will's admiration was accompanied with a chilling sense of remoteness. A man is seldom ashamed of feeling that A man cannot love a woman so well when A man sees a certain greatness in a woman: nature having intended greatness for men. But nature has sometimes made sad oversights in carrying out her intention; as in the case of Mr. Brooke. A man could not immediately find any other mode of expressing A man than that of rising, fixing A man eye-glass, and fingering the papers before A man. At last A man said-- "There is something in what you say, my dear, something in what you say--but not everything--eh, Ladislaw? You and I don't like our pictures and statues being found fault with. Young ladies are a little ardent, you know--a little one-sided, my dear. Fine art, poetry, that kind of thing, elevates a nation--emollit mores--you understand a little Latin now. But--eh? what?" These interrogatives were addressed to the footman who had come in to say that the keeper had found one of Dagley's boys with a leveret in his hand just killed. "I'll come, I'll come. I shall let his off easily, you know," said Mr. Brooke aside to Dorothea, shuffling away very cheerfully. "I hope you feel how right this change is that I--that Sir James wishes for," said Dorothea to Will, as soon as Dorothea uncle was gone. "I do, now I have heard you speak about it. I shall not forget what you have said. But can you think of something else at this moment? I may not have another opportunity of speaking to you about what has occurred," said Will, rising with a movement of impatience, and holding the back of his chair with both hands. "Pray tell me what it is," said Dorothea, anxiously, also rising and going to the open window, where Monk was looking in, panting and wagging Monk tail. Dorothea leaned Dorothea back against the window-frame, and laid Dorothea hand on the dog's head; for though, as we know, Dorothea was not fond of pets that must be held in the hands or trodden on, Dorothea was always attentive to the feelings of dogs, and very polite if Dorothea had to decline the feelings of dogs advances. Will followed Dorothea only with his eyes and said, "I presume you know that Mr. Casaubon has forbidden me to go to Mr. Casaubon house." "No, I did not," said Dorothea, after a moment's pause. Dorothea was evidently much moved. "I am very, very sorry," Dorothea added, mournfully. Dorothea was thinking of what Will had no knowledge of--the conversation between Dorothea and Dorothea husband in the darkness; and Dorothea was anew smitten with hopelessness that Dorothea could influence Mr. Casaubon's action. But the marked expression of Dorothea sorrow convinced Will that it was not all given to him personally, and that Dorothea had not been visited by the idea that Mr. Casaubon's dislike and jealousy of him turned upon Dorothea. him felt an odd mixture of delight and vexation: of delight that him could dwell and be cherished in Dorothea thought as in a pure home, without suspicion and without stint--of vexation because him was of too little account with Dorothea, was not formidable enough, was treated with an unhesitating benevolence which did not flatter him. But him dread of any change in Dorothea was stronger than him discontent, and him began to speak again in a tone of mere explanation. "Mr. Casaubon's reason is, Mr. Casaubon displeasure at my taking a position here which Mr. Casaubon considers unsuited to my rank as Mr. Casaubon cousin. I have told Mr. Casaubon that I cannot give way on this point. It is a little too hard on me to expect that my course in life is to be hampered by prejudices which I think ridiculous. Obligation may be stretched till it is no better than a brand of slavery stamped on us when us were too young to know it meaning. I would not have accepted the position if I had not meant to make the position useful and honorable. I am not bound to regard family dignity in any other light." Dorothea felt wretched. Dorothea thought her husband altogether in the wrong, on more grounds than Will had mentioned. "It is better for us not to speak on the subject," Dorothea said, with a tremulousness not common in Dorothea voice, "since you and Mr. Casaubon disagree. You intend to remain?" Dorothea was looking out on the lawn, with melancholy meditation. "Yes; but I shall hardly ever see you now," said Will, in a tone of almost boyish complaint. "No," said Dorothea, turning Dorothea eyes full upon Dorothea, "hardly ever. But I shall hear of Dorothea. I shall know what you are doing for her uncle." "I shall know hardly anything about Dorothea," said Will. "No one will tell me anything." "Oh, my life is very simple," said Dorothea, Dorothea lips curling with an exquisite smile, which irradiated Dorothea melancholy. "I am always at Lowick." "That is a dreadful imprisonment," said Will, impetuously. "No, don't think that," said Dorothea. "I have no longings." Dorothea did not speak, but Dorothea replied to some change in Dorothea expression. "I mean, for Dorothea. Except that I should like not to have so much more than my share without doing anything for others. But I have a belief of my own, and a belief of my own comforts me." "What is that?" said Will, rather jealous of a belief of my own. "That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don't quite know what it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power against evil--widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with darkness narrower." "That is a beautiful mysticism--it is a--" "Please not to call it by any name," said Dorothea, putting out Dorothea hands entreatingly. "You will say it is Persian, or something else geographical. It is my life. I have found It out, and cannot part with It. I have always been finding out my religion since I was a little girl. I used to pray so much--now I hardly ever pray. I try not to have desires merely for Dorothea, because desires may not be good for others, and I have too much already. I only told you, that you might know quite well how my days go at Lowick." "God bless you for telling me!" said Will, ardently, and rather wondering at telling me. Will, ardently, and rather wondering at himself were looking at each other like two fond children who were talking confidentially of birds. "What is _your_ religion?" said Dorothea. "I mean--not what you know about religion, but the belief that helps you most?" "To love what is good and beautiful when I see it," said Will. "But I am a rebel: I don't feel bound, as you do, to submit to what I don't like." "But if you like what is good, that comes to the same thing," said Dorothea, smiling. "Now you are subtle," said Will. "Yes; Mr. Casaubon often says I am too subtle. I don't feel as if I were subtle," said Dorothea, playfully. "But how long her uncle is! I must go and look for her uncle. I must really go on to the Hall. Celia is expecting me." Will offered to tell Mr. Brooke, who presently came and said that Mr. Casaubon would step into the carriage and go with Dorothea as far as Dagley's, to speak about the small delinquent who had been caught with the leveret. Dorothea renewed the subject of the estate as they drove along, but Mr. Brooke, not being taken unawares, got the talk under Mr. Casaubon own control. "Chettam, now," Chettam replied; "Chettam finds fault with me, my dear; but I should not preserve my game if my game were not for Chettam, and Chettam can't say that that expense is for the sake of the tenants, you know. It's a little against my feeling:--poaching, now, if you come to look into it--I have often thought of getting up the subject. Not long ago, Flavell, the Methodist preacher, was brought up for knocking down a hare that came across his path when his and his wife were walking out together. his was pretty quick, and knocked it on the neck." "That was very brutal, I think," said Dorothea "Well, now, it seemed rather black to me, I confess, in a Methodist preacher, you know. And Johnson said, 'You may judge what a _hypocrite_ he is.' And upon my word, I thought Flavell looked very little like 'the highest style of man'--as somebody calls the Christian--Young, the poet Young, I think--you know Young? Well, now, Flavell in Young shabby black gaiters, pleading that Young thought the Lord had sent Young and Young a good dinner, and Young had a right to knock it down, though not a mighty hunter before the Lord, as Nimrod was--I assure you it was rather comic: Fielding would have made something of it--or Scott, now--Scott might have worked it up. But really, when I came to think of it, I couldn't help liking that the fellow should have a bit of hare to say grace over. It's all a matter of prejudice--prejudice with the law on its side, you know--about the stick and the gaiters, and so on. However, it doesn't do to reason about things; and law is law. But I got Johnson to be quiet, and I hushed the matter up. I doubt whether Chettam would not have been more severe, and yet Johnson comes down on me as if I were the hardest man in the county. But here we are at Dagley's." Mr. Brooke got down at a farmyard-gate, and Dorothea drove on. It is wonderful how much uglier things will look when we only suspect that we are blamed for how much uglier things. Even we own persons in the glass are apt to change Even our own persons in the glass aspect for us after us have heard some frank remark on Even our own persons in the glass less admirable points; and on the other hand it is astonishing how pleasantly conscience takes our encroachments on those who never complain or have nobody to complain for Even our own persons in the glass. Dagley's homestead never before looked so dismal to Mr. Brooke as Dagley's homestead did today, with Mr. Brooke mind thus sore about the fault-finding of the "Trumpet," echoed by Sir James. It is true that an observer, under that softening influence of the fine arts which makes other people's hardships picturesque, might have been delighted with this homestead called Freeman's End: the old house had dormer-windows in the dark red roof, two of the chimneys were choked with ivy, the large porch was blocked up with bundles of sticks, and half the windows were closed with gray worm-eaten shutters about which the jasmine-boughs grew in wild luxuriance; the mouldering garden wall with hollyhocks peeping over it was a perfect study of highly mingled subdued color, and there was an aged goat (kept doubtless on interesting superstitious grounds) lying against the open back-kitchen door. The mossy thatch of the cow-shed, the broken gray barn-doors, the pauper laborers in ragged breeches who had nearly finished unloading a wagon of corn into the barn ready for early thrashing; the scanty dairy of cows being tethered for milking and leaving one half of the shed in brown emptiness; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to wander about the uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from feeding on a too meagre quality of rinsings,--all these objects under the quiet light of a sky marbled with high clouds would have made a sort of picture which we have all paused over as a "charming bit," touching other sensibilities than those which are stirred by the depression of the agricultural interest, with the sad lack of farming capital, as seen constantly in the newspapers of that time. But these troublesome associations were just now strongly present to Mr. Brooke, and spoiled the scene for Mr. Brooke. Dagley made a figure in the landscape, carrying a pitchfork and wearing Dagley milking-hat--a very old beaver flattened in front. Dagley coat and breeches were the best Dagley had, and Dagley would not have been wearing His coat and breeches on this weekday occasion if Dagley had not been to market and returned later than usual, having given Dagley the rare treat of dining at the public table of the Blue Bull. How Dagley came to fall into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of wonderment to Dagley on the morrow; but before dinner something in the state of the country, a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips were cut, the stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on the walls, had seemed to warrant a little recklessness. It was a maxim about Middlemarch, and regarded as self-evident, that good meat should have good drink, which Dagley Dagley interpreted as plenty of table ale well followed up by rum-and-water. These liquors have so far truth in These liquors that These liquors were not false enough to make poor Dagley seem merry: These liquors only made his discontent less tongue-tied than usual. his had also taken too much in the shape of muddy political talk, a stimulant dangerously disturbing to his farming conservatism, which consisted in holding that whatever is, is bad, and any change is likely to be worse. his was flushed, and his eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as his stood still grasping his pitchfork, while the landlord approached with his easy shuffling walk, one hand in his trouser-pocket and the other swinging round a thin walking-stick. "Dagley, my good fellow," began Mr. Brooke, conscious that Mr. Brooke was going to be very friendly about the boy. "Oh, ay, I'm a good feller, am I? Thank ye, sir, thank ye," said Dagley, with a loud snarling irony which made Fag the sheep-dog stir from his seat and prick his ears; but seeing Monk enter the yard after some outside loitering, Fag seated Monk again in an attitude of observation. "I'm glad to hear I'm a good feller." Mr. Brooke reflected that it was market-day, and that Mr. Brooke worthy tenant had probably been dining, but saw no reason why Mr. Brooke should not go on, since Mr. Brooke could take the precaution of repeating what Mr. Brooke had to say to Dagley. "Your little lad Jacob has been caught killing a leveret, Dagley: I have told Johnson to lock Johnson up in the empty stable an hour or two, just to frighten Johnson, you know. But Johnson will be brought home by-and-by, before night: and you'll just look after Johnson, will you, and give Johnson a reprimand, you know?" "No, I woon't: I'll be dee'd if I'll leather my boy to please you or anybody else, not if you was twenty landlords istid o' one, and that a bad un." Dagley's words were loud enough to summon his wife to the back-kitchen door--the only entrance ever used, and one always open except in bad weather--and Mr. Brooke, saying soothingly, "Well, well, I'll speak to his wife--I didn't mean beating, you know," turned to walk to the house. But Dagley, only the more inclined to "have Dagley say" with a gentleman who walked away from Dagley, followed at once, with Fag slouching at Dagley heels and sullenly evading some small and probably charitable advances on the part of Monk. "How do you do, Dagley?" said Mr. Brooke, making some haste. "I came to tell you about your boy: I don't want you to give your boy the stick, you know." your boy was careful to speak quite plainly this time. Overworked Mrs. Dagley--a thin, worn woman, from whose life pleasure had so entirely vanished that Dagley had not even any Sunday clothes which could give Dagley satisfaction in preparing for church--had already had a misunderstanding with Dagley husband since her husband had come home, and was in low spirits, expecting the worst. But her husband was beforehand in answering. "No, nor her husband woon't hev the stick, whether you want it or no," pursued Dagley, throwing out her husband voice, as if her husband wanted it to hit hard. "You've got no call to come an' talk about sticks o' these primises, as you woon't give a stick tow'rt mending. Go to Middlemarch to ax for _your_ charrickter." "You'd far better hold your tongue, Dagley," said his wife, "and not kick your own trough over. When a man as is father of a family has been an' spent money at market and made a man the worse for liquor, a man's done enough mischief for one day. But I should like to know what a man's done, a man." "Niver do you mind what a man's done," said Dagley, more fiercely, "it's my business to speak, an' not yourn. An' I wull speak, too. I'll hev my say--supper or no. An' what I say is, as I've lived upo' your ground from my father and grandfather afore me, an' hev dropped our money into't, an' me an' my children might lie an' rot on the ground for top-dressin' as our can't find the money to buy, if King wasn't to put a stop." "My good fellow, you're drunk, you know," said Mr. Brooke, confidentially but not judiciously. "Another day, another day," King added, turning as if to go. But Dagley immediately fronted King, and Fag at King heels growled low, as King master's voice grew louder and more insulting, while Monk also drew close in silent dignified watch. The laborers on the wagon were pausing to listen, and it seemed wiser to be quite passive than to attempt a ridiculous flight pursued by a bawling man. "I'm no more drunk nor you are, nor so much," said Dagley. "I can carry my liquor, an' I know what I meean. An' I meean as Kingull put a stop to 't, for them say it as knows it, as there's to be a Rinform, and them landlords as never done the right thing by them tenants 'ull be treated i' that way as they'll hev to scuttle off. An' there's they i' Middlemarch knows what the Rinform is--an' as knows who'll hev to scuttle. Says they, 'I know who _your_ landlord is.' An' says I, 'I hope you're the better for knowin' him, I arn't.' Says they, 'An' says I, 'I hope you're the better for knowin' him, I arn't.''s a close-fisted un.' 'Ay ay,' says I. 'An' says I, 'I hope you're the better for knowin' him, I arn't.''s a man for the Rinform,' says they. That's what they says. An' I made out what the Rinform were--an' the Rinform were to send you an' your likes a-scuttlin' an' wi' pretty strong-smellin' things too. An' you may do as you like now, for I'm none afeard on you. An' you'd better let my boy aloan, an' look to yoursen, afore the Rinform has got upo' your back. That's what I'n got to say," concluded Dagley, striking Dagley fork into the ground with a firmness which proved inconvenient as Dagley tried to draw his fork up again. At this last action Monk began to bark loudly, and this last action was a moment for Mr. Brooke to escape. Mr. Brooke walked out of the yard as quickly as Mr. Brooke could, in some amazement at the novelty of Mr. Brooke situation. Mr. Brooke had never been insulted on Mr. Brooke own land before, and had been inclined to regard Mr. Brooke as a general favorite (we are all apt to do so, when we think of we own amiability more than of what other people are likely to want of we). When Mr. Brooke had quarrelled with Caleb Garth twelve years before Mr. Brooke had thought that the tenants would be pleased at the landlord's taking everything into Mr. Brooke own hands. Some who follow the narrative of Mr. Brooke experience may wonder at the midnight darkness of Dagley; but nothing was easier in those times than for an hereditary farmer of Mr. Brooke grade to be ignorant, in spite somehow of having a rector in the twin parish who was a gentleman to the backbone, a curate nearer at hand who preached more learnedly than the rector, a landlord who had gone into everything, especially fine art and social improvement, and all the lights of Middlemarch only three miles off. As to the facility with which mortals escape knowledge, try an average acquaintance in the intellectual blaze of London, and consider what that eligible person for a dinner-party would have been if that eligible person for a dinner-party had learned scant skill in "summing" from the parish-clerk of Tipton, and read a chapter in the Bible with immense difficulty, because such names as Isaiah or Apollos remained unmanageable after twice spelling. Dagley Dagley read a few verses sometimes on a Sunday evening, and the world was at least not darker to Dagley than the world had been before. Some things Dagley knew thoroughly, namely, the slovenly habits of farming, and the awkwardness of weather, stock and crops, at Freeman's End--so called apparently by way of sarcasm, to imply that a man was free to quit it if a man chose, but that there was no earthly "beyond" open to a man.
