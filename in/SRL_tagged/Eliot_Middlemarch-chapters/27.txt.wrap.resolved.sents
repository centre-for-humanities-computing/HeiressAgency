Let the high Muse chant loves Olympian: We are but mortals, and must sing of man.
An eminent philosopher among my friends, who can dignify even your ugly furniture by lifting even your ugly furniture into the serene light of science, has shown me this pregnant little fact.
Your pier-glass or extensive surface of polished steel made to be rubbed by a housemaid, will be minutely and multitudinously scratched in all directions; but place now against Your pier-glass or extensive surface of polished steel made to be rubbed by a housemaid a lighted candle as a centre of illumination, and lo!
the scratches will seem to arrange the scratches in a fine series of concentric circles round that little sun.
It is demonstrable that the scratches are going everywhere impartially and the scratches is only your candle which produces the flattering illusion of a concentric arrangement, It light falling with an exclusive optical selection.
These things are a parable.
the scratches are events, and a lighted candle as a centre of illumination is the egoism of any person now absent--of Miss Vincy, for example.
Rosamond had a Providence of Rosamond own who had kindly made Rosamond more charming than other girls, and who seemed to have arranged Fred's illness and Mr. Wrench's mistake in order to bring Rosamond and Lydgate within effective proximity.
It would have been to contravene these arrangements if Rosamond had consented to go away to Stone Court or elsewhere, as Rosamond parents wished Rosamond to do, especially since Mr. Lydgate thought the precaution needless.
Therefore, while Miss Morgan and the children were sent away to a farmhouse the morning after Fred's illness had declared itself, Rosamond refused to leave papa and mamma.
Poor mamma indeed was an object to touch any creature born of woman; and Mr. Vincy, who doted on his wife, was more alarmed on Rosamond account than on Fred's.
But for his insistence Rosamond would have taken no rest: Rosamond brightness was all bedimmed; unconscious of Rosamond costume which had always been so fresh and gay, Rosamond was like a sick bird with languid eye and plumage ruffled, Rosamond senses dulled to the sights and sounds that used most to interest Rosamond.
Fred's delirium, in which Fred seemed to be wandering out of Rosamond reach, tore Rosamond heart.
After Rosamond first outburst against-Mr. Wrench Rosamond went about very quietly: Rosamond one low cry was to Lydgate.
Rosamond would follow Fred out of the room and put Rosamond hand on Fred arm moaning out, "Save Fred."
Once Rosamond pleaded, "Fred has always been good to Rosamond, Lydgate: Lydgate never had a hard word for Lydgate mother,"--as if poor Fred's suffering were an accusation against Lydgate.
All the deepest fibres of the mother's memory were stirred, and the young man whose voice took a gentler tone when Lydgate spoke to Rosamond, was one with the babe whom Rosamond had loved, with a love new to Rosamond, before Lydgate was born.
"I have good hope, Mrs. Vincy," Lydgate would say.
"Come down with Lydgate and let us talk about the food."
In that way Lydgate led Rosamond to the parlor where Rosamond was, and made a change for Rosamond, surprising Rosamond into taking some tea or broth which had been prepared for Rosamond.
There was a constant understanding between Lydgate and Rosamond on these matters.
Lydgate almost always saw Rosamond before going to the sickroom, and Rosamond appealed to Lydgate as to what Rosamond could do for mamma.
Rosamond presence of mind and adroitness in carrying out Lydgate hints were admirable, and it is not wonderful that the idea of seeing Rosamond began to mingle it with Lydgate interest in the case.
Especially when the critical stage was passed, and Lydgate began to feel confident of Fred's recovery.
In the more doubtful time, Lydgate had advised calling in Dr. Sprague (who, if Lydgate could, would rather have remained neutral on Wrench's account); but after two consultations, the conduct of the case was left to Lydgate, and there was every reason to make Lydgate assiduous.
Morning and evening Lydgate was at Mr. Vincy's, and gradually the visits became cheerful as Fred became simply feeble, and lay not only in need of the utmost petting but conscious of it, so that Mr. Vincy felt as if, after all, the illness had made a festival for Mr. Vincy tenderness.
Both father and mother held a festival an added reason for good spirits, when old Mr. Featherstone sent messages by Lydgate, saying that Fred-must make haste and get well, as old Mr. Featherstone, Peter Featherstone, could not do without old Mr. Featherstone, and missed old Mr. Featherstone visits sadly.
The old man himself was getting bedridden.
Mr. Vincy told these messages to Fred when Fred could listen, and Fred turned towards Fred Fred delicate, pinched face, from which all the thick blond hair had been cut away, and in which the eyes seemed to have got larger, yearning for some word about Mary--wondering what Fred felt about the illness.
No word passed Fred lips; but "to hear with eyes belongs to love's rare wit," and the mother in the fulness of Fred heart not only divined Fred's longing, but felt ready for any sacrifice in order to satisfy Fred.
"If I can only see my boy strong again," Fred said, in Fred loving folly; "and who knows?--perhaps master of Stone Court!
and my boy can marry anybody my boy likes then."
"Not if they won't have me, mother," said Fred.
the illness had made Fred childish, and tears came as Fred spoke.
"Oh, take a bit of jelly, my dear," said Mrs. Vincy, secretly incredulous of any such refusal.
Fred never left Fred's side when Fred husband was not in the house, and thus Rosamond was in the unusual position of being much alone.
Lydgate, naturally, never thought of staying long with Lydgate, yet it seemed that the brief impersonal conversations they had together were creating that peculiar intimacy which consists in shyness.
they were obliged to look at each other in speaking, and somehow the looking could not be carried through as the matter of course which it really was.
Lydgate began to feel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and one day looked down, or anywhere, like an ill-worked puppet.
But this turned out badly: the next day, Rosamond looked down, and the consequence was that when both eyes met again, both were more conscious than before.
There was no help for this in science, and as Lydgate did not want to flirt, there seemed to be no help for it in folly.
It was therefore a relief when neighbors no longer considered the house in quarantine, and when the chances of seeing Rosamond were very much reduced.
But that intimacy of mutual embarrassment, in which each feels that the other is feeling something, having once existed, its effect is not to be done away with.
Talk about the weather and other well-bred topics is apt to seem a hollow device, and behavior can hardly become easy unless it frankly recognizes a mutual fascination--which of course need not mean anything deep or serious.
This was the way in which Rosamond and Lydgate slid gracefully into ease, and made Rosamond and Lydgate intercourse lively again.
Visitors came and went as usual, there was once more music in the drawing-room, and all the extra hospitality of Mr. Vincy's mayoralty returned.
Lydgate, whenever Lydgate could, took Lydgate seat by Rosamond's side, and lingered to hear Lydgate music, calling Lydgate Lydgate captive--meaning, all the while, not to be Lydgate captive.
The preposterousness of the notion that Lydgate could at once set up a satisfactory establishment as a married man was a sufficient guarantee against danger.
This play at being a little in love was agreeable, and did not interfere with graver pursuits.
Flirtation, after all, was not necessarily a singeing process.
Rosamond, for Rosamond part, had never enjoyed the days so much in Rosamond life before: Rosamond was sure of being admired by some one worth captivating, and Rosamond did not distinguish flirtation from love, either in Rosamond or in another.
Rosamond seemed to be sailing with a fair wind just whither Rosamond would go, and Rosamond thoughts were much occupied with a handsome house in Lowick Gate which Rosamond hoped would by-and-by be vacant.
Rosamond was quite determined, when Rosamond was married, to rid Rosamond adroitly of all the visitors who were not agreeable to Rosamond at Rosamond father's; and Rosamond imagined the drawing-room in Rosamond favorite house with various styles of furniture.
Certainly her thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself; Lydgate himself seemed to Rosamond almost perfect: if Lydgate himself had known Lydgate himself notes so that Lydgate himself enchantment under Rosamond music had been less like an emotional elephant's, and if Lydgate himself had been able to discriminate better the refinements of Rosamond taste in dress, Rosamond could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in Lydgate himself.
How different Lydgate himself was from young Plymdale or Mr. Caius Larcher!
Those young men had not a notion of French, and could speak on no subject with striking knowledge, except perhaps the dyeing and carrying trades, which of course Those young men were ashamed to mention; Those young men were Middlemarch gentry, elated with Those young men silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but embarrassed in Those young men manners, and timidly jocose: Fred Fred was above Those young men, having at least the accent and manner of a university man.
Whereas Lydgate was always listened to, bore Lydgate with the careless politeness of conscious superiority, and seemed to have the right clothes on by a certain natural affinity, without ever having to think about a certain natural affinity.
Rosamond was proud when Lydgate entered the room, and when Lydgate approached Rosamond with a distinguishing smile, Rosamond had a delicious sense that Rosamond was the object of enviable homage.
If Lydgate had been aware of all the pride Lydgate excited in that delicate bosom, Lydgate might have been just as well pleased as any other man, even the most densely ignorant of humoral pathology or fibrous tissue: Lydgate held Lydgate one of the prettiest attitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man's pre-eminence without too precise a knowledge of what Lydgate consisted in.
But Rosamond was not one of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares, and whose behavior is awkwardly driven by themselves impulses, instead of being steered by wary grace and propriety.
Do you imagine that Rosamond rapid forecast and rumination concerning house-furniture and society were ever discernible in Rosamond conversation, even with Rosamond mamma?
On the contrary, Rosamond would have expressed the prettiest surprise and disapprobation if Rosamond had heard that another young lady had been detected in that immodest prematureness--indeed, would probably have disbelieved in another young lady had been detected in that immodest prematureness possibility.
For Rosamond never showed any unbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct sentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private album for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the irresistible woman for the doomed man of that date.
Think no unfair evil of Rosamond, pray: Rosamond had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or mercenary; in fact, Rosamond never thought of money except as something necessary which other people would always provide.
Rosamond was not in the habit of devising falsehoods, and if Rosamond statements were no direct clew to fact, why, her statements were not intended in that light--her statements were among Rosamond elegant accomplishments, intended to please.
Nature had inspired many arts in finishing Mrs.
Lemon's favorite pupil, who by general consent (Fred's excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness, and amiability.
Lydgate found it more and more agreeable to be with Lydgate, and there was no constraint now, there was a delightful interchange of influence in their eyes, and what their said had that superfluity of meaning for their, which is observable with some sense of flatness by a third person; still their had no interviews or asides from which a third person need have been excluded.
In fact, their flirted; and Lydgate was secure in the belief that their did nothing else.
If a man could not love and be wise, surely a man could flirt and be wise at the same time?
Really, the men in Middlemarch, except Mr. Farebrother, were great bores, and Lydgate did not care about commercial politics or cards: what was a man to do for relaxation?
a man was often invited to the Bulstrodes'; but the girls there were hardly out of the schoolroom; and Mrs. Bulstrode's _naive_ way of conciliating piety and worldliness, the nothingness of this life and the desirability of cut glass, the consciousness at once of filthy rags and the best damask, was not a sufficient relief from the weight of her husband's invariable seriousness.
The Vincys' house, with all The Vincys' house faults, was the pleasanter by contrast; besides, the pleasanter nourished Rosamondsweet to look at as a half-opened blush-rose, and adorned with accomplishments for the refined amusement of man.
But The Vincys' made some enemies, other than medical, by The Vincys' success with Mr. Vincy.
One evening The Vincys' came into the drawing-room rather late, when several other visitors were there.
The card-table had drawn off the elders, and Mr. Ned Plymdale (one of the good matches in Middlemarch, though not one of Middlemarch leading minds) was in tete-a-tete with Rosamond.
The Vincys' had brought the last "Keepsake," the gorgeous watered-silk publication which marked modern progress at that time; and The Vincys' considered The Vincys' very fortunate that The Vincys' could be the first to look over it with her, dwelling on the ladies and gentlemen with shiny copper-plate cheeks and copper-plate smiles, and pointing to comic verses as capital and sentimental stories as interesting.
Rosamond was gracious, and Mr. Ned was satisfied that Mr. Ned had the very best thing in art and literature as a medium for "paying addresses"--the very thing to please a nice girl.
Mr. Ned had also reasons, deep rather than ostensible, for being satisfied with Mr. Ned own appearance.
To superficial observers Mr. Ned chin had too vanishing an aspect, looking as if his chin were being gradually reabsorbed.
And his chin did indeed cause Mr. Ned some difficulty about the fit of Mr. Ned satin stocks, for which chins were at that time useful.
"I think the Honorable Mrs. S. is something like you," said Mr. Ned.
Mr. Ned kept the book open at the bewitching portrait, and looked at the book open rather languishingly.
"Her back is very large; Her seems to have sat for that," said Rosamond, not meaning any satire, but thinking how red young Plymdale's hands were, and wondering why Lydgate did not come.
Her went on with Her tatting all the while.
"I did not say Her was as beautiful as you are," said Mr. Ned, venturing to look from the bewitching portrait to the bewitching portrait rival.
"I suspect you of being an adroit flatterer," said Rosamond, feeling sure that Rosamond should have to reject this young gentleman a second time.
But now Lydgate came in; the book open was closed before Lydgate reached Rosamond's corner, and as Lydgate took his seat with easy confidence on the other side of Her, young Plymdale's jaw fell like a barometer towards the cheerless side of change.
Rosamond enjoyed not only Lydgate's presence but Lydgate effect: Rosamond liked to excite jealousy.
"What a late comer you are!"
Rosamond said, as they shook hands.
"Mamma had given you up a little while ago.
How do you find Fred?"
"As usual; going on well, but slowly.
I want Fred to go away--to Stone Court, for example.
But Mamma seems to have some objection."
"Poor fellow!"
said Rosamond, prettily.
"You will see Fred so changed," Fred added, turning to the other suitor; "we have looked to Lydgate as we guardian angel during this illness."
Mr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the "Keepsake" towards Mr. Ned and opening " towards him, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up Mr. Ned chill, as if in wonderment at human folly.
"What are you laughing at so profanely?"
said Rosamond, with bland neutrality.
"I wonder which would turn out to be the silliest--the engravings or the writing here," said Lydgate, in Lydgate most convinced tone, while Lydgate turned over the pages quickly, seeming to see all through the book open in no time, and showing Lydgate large white hands to much advantage, as Rosamond thought.
"Do look at this bridegroom coming out of church: did you ever see such a 'sugared invention'--as the Elizabethans used to say?
Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking?
Yet I will answer for any haberdasher the story makes him one of the first gentlemen in the land."
"You are so severe, I am frightened at you," said Rosamond, keeping Rosamond amusement duly moderate.
Poor young Plymdale had lingered with admiration over this very engraving, and Poor young Plymdale spirit was stirred.
"There are a great many celebrated people writing in the 'Keepsake,' at all events," Poor young Plymdale said, in a tone at once piqued and timid.
"This is the first time I have heard it called silly."
"I think I shall turn round on you and accuse you of being a Goth," said Rosamond, looking at Lydgate with a smile.
"I suspect you know nothing about Lady Blessington and L. E. L.Rosamond Rosamond was not without relish for these writers, but Rosamond did not readily commit Rosamond by admiration, and was alive to the slightest hint that anything was not, according to Lydgate, in the very highest taste.
"But Sir Walter Scott--I suppose Lydgate knows Sir Walter Scott," said Poor young Plymdale, a little cheered by this advantage.
"Oh, I read no literature now," said Lydgate, shutting the book open, and pushing the book open away.
"I read so much when I was a lad, that I suppose it will last me all my life.
I used to know Sir Walter Scott's poems by heart."
"I should like to know when you left off," said Rosamond, "because then I might be sure that I knew something which you did not know."
"Lydgate would say that was not worth knowing," said Mr. Ned, purposely caustic.
"On the contrary," said Lydgate, showing no smart; but smiling with exasperating confidence at Rosamond.
"It would be worth knowing by the fact that Mr. Vincy could tell Vincy me."
Poor young Plymdale soon went to look at the whist-playing, thinking that Lydgate was one of the most conceited, unpleasant fellows it had ever been Poor young Plymdale ill-fortune to meet.
"How rash you are!"
said Rosamond, inwardly delighted.
"Do you see that you have given offence?"
"What!
is it Poor young Plymdale's book?
I am sorry.
I didn't think about it."
"I shall begin to admit what you said of yourself when you first came here--that you are a bear, and want teaching by the birds."
"Well, there is a bird who can teach me what she will.
Don't I listen to she willingly?"
To Rosamond it seemed as if Rosamond and Lydgate were as good as engaged.
That she and Lydgate were as good as engaged were some time to be engaged had long been an idea in Rosamond mind; and ideas, we know, tend to a more solid kind of existence, the necessary materials being at hand.
It is true, Lydgate had the counter-idea of remaining unengaged; but this was a mere negative, a shadow east by other resolves which themselves were capable of shrinking.
Circumstance was almost sure to be on the side of Rosamond's idea, which had a shaping activity and looked through watchful blue eyes, whereas Lydgate's lay blind and unconcerned as a jelly-fish which gets melted without knowing it.
That evening when he went home, he looked at he phials to see how a process of maceration was going on, with undisturbed interest; and he wrote out he daily notes with as much precision as usual.
The reveries from which it was difficult for he to detach he were ideal constructions of something else than Rosamond's virtues, and the primitive tissue was still he fair unknown.
Moreover, he was beginning to feel some zest for the growing though half-suppressed feud between he and the other medical men, which was likely to become more manifest, now that Bulstrode's method of managing the new hospital was about to be declared; and there were various inspiriting signs that he non-acceptance by some of Peacock's patients might be counterbalanced by the impression he had produced in other quarters.
Only a few days later, when he had happened to overtake Rosamond on the Lowick road and had got down from he horse to walk by Rosamond side until he had quite protected Rosamond from a passing drove, he had been stopped by a servant on horseback with a message calling he in to a house of some importance where Peacock had never attended; and it was the second instance of this kind.
a servant was Sir James Chettam's, and a house of some importance where Peacock had never attended was Lowick Manor.
