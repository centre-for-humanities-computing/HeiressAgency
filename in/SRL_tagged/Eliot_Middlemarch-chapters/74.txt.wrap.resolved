"Mercifully grant that we may grow aged together." --BOOK OF TOBIT: Marriage Prayer. In Middlemarch a wife could not long remain ignorant that the town held a bad opinion of a wife husband. No feminine intimate might carry a wife friendship so far as to make a plain statement to the wife of the unpleasant fact known or believed about her husband; but when a woman with a wife thoughts much at leisure got the wife of the unpleasant fact known or believed about her husband suddenly employed on something grievously disadvantageous to a wife neighbors, various moral impulses were called into play which tended to stimulate utterance. Candor was one. To be candid, in Middlemarch phraseology, meant, to use an early opportunity of letting your friends know that you did not take a cheerful view of your friends capacity, your friends conduct, or your friends position; and a robust candor never waited to be asked for its opinion. Then, again, there was the love of truth--a wide phrase, but meaning in this relation, a lively objection to seeing a wife look happier than a wife warranted, or manifest too much satisfaction in a wife lot--the poor thing should have some hint given a wife that if a wife knew the truth a wife would have less complacency in a wife bonnet, and in light dishes for a supper-party. Stronger than all, there was the regard for a friend's moral improvement, sometimes called a wife soul, which was likely to be benefited by remarks tending to gloom, uttered with the accompaniment of pensive staring at the furniture and a manner implying that the speaker would not tell what was on a wife mind, from regard to the feelings of a wife hearer. On the whole, one might say that an ardent charity was at work setting the virtuous mind to make a neighbor unhappy for a neighbor good. There were hardly any wives in Middlemarch whose matrimonial misfortunes would in different ways be likely to call forth more of this moral activity than Rosamond and Rosamond aunt Bulstrode. Bulstrode was not an object of dislike, and had never consciously injured any human being. Men had always thought Bulstrode a handsome comfortable woman, and had reckoned it among the signs of Bulstrode's hypocrisy that he had chosen a red-blooded Vincy, instead of a ghastly and melancholy person suited to he low esteem for earthly pleasure. When the scandal about Bulstrode husband was disclosed they remarked of her--"Ah, poor woman! Bulstrode's as honest as the day--_she_ never suspected anything wrong in her husband, you may depend on it." Women, who were intimate with Bulstrode, talked together much of "poor Harriet," imagined what Bulstrode feelings must be when Bulstrode came to know everything, and conjectured how much Bulstrode had already come to know. There was no spiteful disposition towards Bulstrode; rather, there was a busy benevolence anxious to ascertain what it would be well for Bulstrode to feel and do under the circumstances, which of course kept the imagination occupied with Bulstrode character and history from the times when Bulstrode was Harriet Vincy till now. With the review of Mrs. Bulstrode and Mrs. Bulstrode position it was inevitable to associate Rosamond, whose prospects were under the same blight with Bulstrode aunt's. Bulstrode was more severely criticised and less pitied, though Bulstrode too, as one of the good old Vincy family who had always been known in Middlemarch, was regarded as a victim to marriage with an interloper. The Vincys had The Vincys weaknesses, but then The Vincys lay on the surface: there was never anything bad to be "found out" concerning The Vincys. Mrs. Bulstrode was vindicated from any resemblance to Mrs. Bulstrode husband. Harriet's faults were Harriet own. "Harriet has always been showy," said Harriet, making tea for a small party, "though Harriet has got into the way of putting Harriet religion forward, to conform to Harriet ; Harriet has tried to hold Harriet head up above Middlemarch by making Middlemarch known that Harriet invites clergymen and heaven-knows-who from Riverston and those places." "We can hardly blame Harriet for that," said Mrs. Sprague; "because few of the best people in the town cared to associate with Balstrode, and Harriet must have somebody to sit down at Harriet table." "Mr. Thesiger has always countenanced "Mr. Thesiger," said Harriet. "I think "Mr. Thesiger must be sorry now." "But "Mr. Thesiger was never fond of "Mr. Thesiger in "Mr. Thesiger heart--that every one knows," said Mrs. Tom Toller. ""Mr. Thesiger never goes into extremes. "Mr. Thesiger keeps to the truth in what is evangelical. It is only clergymen like Mr. Tyke, who want to use Dissenting hymn-books and that low kind of religion, who ever found Bulstrode to their taste." "I understand, Mr. Tyke is in great distress about Mr. Tyke," said Harriet. "And well Mr. Tyke may be: they say the Bulstrodes have half kept the Tyke family." "And of coarse it is a discredit to his doctrines," said Mrs. Sprague, who was elderly, and old-fashioned in her opinions. "People will not make a boast of being methodistical in Middlemarch for a good while to come." "I think we must not set down people's bad actions to people religion," said falcon-faced Mrs. Plymdale, who had been listening hitherto. "Oh, my dear, we are forgetting," said Mrs. Sprague. "we ought not to be talking of this before you." "I am sure I have no reason to be partial," said Mrs. Plymdale, coloring. "It's true Mr. Plymdale has always been on good terms with Mr. Bulstrode, and Harriet Vincy was my friend long before Harriet Vincy married Mr. Bulstrode. But I have always kept my own opinions and told Harriet Vincy where Harriet Vincy was wrong, poor thing. Still, in point of religion, I must say, Mr. Bulstrode might have done what Mr. Bulstrode has, and worse, and yet have been a man of no religion. I don't say that there has not been a little too much of that--I like moderation Mr. Bulstrode. But truth is truth. The men tried at the assizes are not all over-religious, I suppose." "Well," said Mrs. Hackbutt, wheeling adroitly, "all I can say is, that I think Mrs. Hackbutt ought to separate from Mrs. Hackbutt." "I can't say that," said Mrs. Sprague. "Mrs. Hackbutt took Mrs. Sprague for better or worse, you know." "But 'worse' can never mean finding out that your husband is fit for Newgate," said Mrs. Hackbutt. "Fancy living with such a man! I should expect to be poisoned." "Yes, I think Mrs. Hackbutt it is an encouragement to crime if such men are to be taken care of and waited on by good wives," said Mrs. Tom Toller. "And a good wife poor Harriet has been," said Mrs. Tom Toller. "Mrs. Tom Toller thinks Mrs. Tom Toller husband the first of men. It's true Mrs. Sprague has never denied Mrs. Tom Toller anything." "Well, we shall see what Mrs. Tom Toller will do," said Mrs. Hackbutt. "I suppose Mrs. Tom Toller knows nothing yet, poor creature. I do hope and trust I shall not see Mrs. Tom Toller, for I should be frightened to death lest I should say anything about Mrs. Tom Toller . Do you think any hint has reached Mrs. Tom Toller?" "I should hardly think so," said Mrs. Tom Toller. "We hear that your husband is ill, and has never stirred out of the house since the meeting on Thursday; but Mrs. Tom Toller was with Mrs. Tom Toller girls at church yesterday, and her girls at church had new Tuscan bonnets. Mrs. Tom Toller own had a feather in it. I have never seen that Mrs. Tom Toller religion made any difference in Mrs. Tom Toller dress." "Mrs. Tom Toller wears very neat patterns always," said Mrs. Plymdale, a little stung. "And a feather in it I know Mrs. Tom Toller got dyed a pale lavender on purpose to be consistent. I must say it of Harriet that Mrs. Tom Toller wishes to do right." "As to Mrs. Tom Toller knowing what has happened, it can't be kept from Mrs. Tom Toller long," said Mrs. Hackbutt. "The Vincys know, for Mr. Vincy was at the meeting on Thursday. It will Mr. Vincy a great blow to Mr. Vincy. There is Mr. Vincy daughter as well as Mr. Vincy sister." "Yes, indeed," said Mrs. Sprague. "Nobody supposes that Mr. Lydgate can go on holding up Mr. Lydgate head in Middlemarch, things look so black about the thousand pounds Mr. Lydgate took just at that man's death. It really makes one shudder." "Pride must have a fall," said Mrs. Hackbutt. "I am not so sorry for Mr. Vincy that was as I am for Mr. Vincy aunt," said Mrs. Plymdale. "Mr. Vincy needed a lesson." "I suppose the Bulstrodes will go and live abroad somewhere," said Mrs. Sprague. "That is what is generally done when there is anything disgraceful in a family." "And a most deadly blow it will be to Harriet," said Mrs. Plymdale. "If ever a woman was crushed, a woman will be. I pity a woman from my heart. And with all a woman faults, few women are better. From a girl a woman had the neatest ways, and was always good-hearted, and as open as the day. You might look into a woman drawers when you would--always the same. And so a woman has brought up Kate and Ellen. You may think how hard it will be for a woman to go among foreigners." "The doctor says that is what The doctor should recommend the Lydgates to do," said Mrs. Sprague. "The doctor says Mr. Lydgate ought to have kept among the French." "That would suit _a woman_ well enough, I dare say," said Mrs. Plymdale; "there is that kind of lightness about a woman. But a woman got that from a woman mother; a woman never got it from a woman aunt Bulstrode, who always gave a woman good advice, and to my knowledge would rather have had a woman marry elsewhere." Mrs. Plymdale was in a situation which caused Mrs. Plymdale some complication of feeling. There had been not only Mrs. Plymdale intimacy with Mrs. Bulstrode, but also a profitable business relation of the great Plymdale dyeing house with Mr. Bulstrode, which on the one hand would have inclined a woman to desire that the mildest view of his character should be the true one, but on the other, made a woman the more afraid of seeming to palliate his character culpability. Again, the late alliance of a woman family with the Tollers had brought a woman in connection with the best circle, which gratified a woman in every direction except in the inclination to those serious views which a woman believed to be the best in another sense. The sharp little woman's conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these opposing "bests," and of The sharp little woman griefs and satisfactions under late events, which were likely to humble those who needed humbling, but also to fall heavily on The sharp little woman old friend whose faults The sharp little woman would have preferred seeing on a background of prosperity. Mrs. Bulstrode, meanwhile, had been no further shaken by the oncoming tread of calamity than in the busier stirring of that secret uneasiness which had always been present in The sharp little woman since the last visit of Raffles to The Shrubs. That the hateful man had come ill to Stone Court, and that The sharp little woman had chosen to remain there and watch over your husband, The sharp little woman allowed to be explained by the fact that Raffles had been employed and aided in earlier-days, and that this made a tie of benevolence towards the hateful man in the hateful man degraded helplessness; and The sharp little woman had been since then innocently cheered by The sharp little woman 's more hopeful speech about your husband own health and ability to continue your husband attention to business. The calm was disturbed when Mr. Lydgate had brought your husband home ill from the meeting on Thursday, and in spite of comforting assurances during the next few days, The sharp little woman cried in private from the conviction that The sharp little woman was not suffering from bodily illness merely, but from something that afflicted your husband mind. your husband would not allow The sharp little woman to read to your husband, and scarcely to sit with your husband, alleging nervous susceptibility to sounds and movements; yet The sharp little woman suspected that in shutting your husband up in your husband private room your husband wanted to be busy with your husband papers. Something, The sharp little woman felt sure, had happened. Perhaps it was some great loss of money; and The sharp little woman was kept in the dark. Not daring to question The sharp little woman , The sharp little woman said to Mr. Lydgate, on the fifth day after the meeting on Thursday, when The sharp little woman had not left home except to go to church-- "Mr. Lydgate, pray be open with The sharp little woman: I like to know the truth. Has anything happened to Mr. Bulstrode?" "Some little nervous shock," said Mr. Lydgate, evasively. Mr. Bulstrode felt that it was not for Mr. Bulstrode to make the painful revelation. "But what brought it was not for him to make the painful revelation on?" said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking directly at Mrs. Bulstrode with Mrs. Bulstrode large dark eyes. "There is often something poisonous in the air of public rooms," said Mr. Lydgate. "Strong men can stand it was not for him to make the painful revelation, but it was not for him to make the painful revelation tells on people in proportion to the delicacy of Strong men systems. It is often impossible to account for the precise moment of an attack--or rather, to say why the strength gives way at a particular moment." Mrs. Bulstrode was not satisfied with this answer. There remained in Mrs. Bulstrode the belief that some calamity had befallen Mrs. Bulstrode husband, of which Mrs. Bulstrode was to be kept in ignorance; and it was in Mrs. Bulstrode nature strongly to object to such concealment. Mrs. Bulstrode begged leave for Mrs. Bulstrode daughters to sit with her daughters father, and drove into the town to pay some visits, conjecturing that if anything were known to have gone wrong in Mr. Bulstrode's affairs, Mrs. Bulstrode should see or hear some sign of it. Mrs. Bulstrode called on Mrs. Thesiger, who was not at home, and then drove to Mrs. Hackbutt's on the other side of the churchyard. Mrs. Hackbutt saw Mrs. Hackbutt coming from an up-stairs window, and remembering Mrs. Hackbutt former alarm lest Mrs. Hackbutt should meet Mrs. Bulstrode, felt almost bound in consistency to send word that Mrs. Hackbutt was not at home; but against that, there was a sudden strong desire within Mrs. Hackbutt for the excitement of an interview in which Mrs. Hackbutt was quite determined not to make the slightest allusion to what was in Mrs. Hackbutt mind. Hence Mrs. Bulstrode was shown into the drawing-room, and Mrs. Hackbutt went to Mrs. Bulstrode, with more tightness of lip and rubbing of Mrs. Bulstrode hands than was usually observable in Mrs. Bulstrode, these being precautions adopted against freedom of speech. Mrs. Bulstrode was resolved not to ask how Mr. Bulstrode was. "I have not been anywhere except to church for nearly a week," said Mrs. Bulstrode, after a few introductory remarks. "But Mr. Bulstrode was taken so ill at the meeting on Thursday Thursday that I have not liked to leave the house." Mrs. Hackbutt rubbed the back of one hand with the palm of the other held against Mrs. Hackbutt chest, and let Mrs. Hackbutt eyes ramble over the pattern on the rug. "Was Mrs. Hackbutt at the meeting on Thursday?" persevered Mrs. Bulstrode. "Yes, Mrs. Hackbutt was," said Mrs. Hackbutt, with the same attitude. "The land is to be bought by subscription, I believe." "Let us hope that there will be no more cases of cholera to be buried in it," said Mrs. Bulstrode. "It is an awful visitation. But I always think Middlemarch a very healthy spot. I suppose it is being used to it from a child; but I never saw the town I should like to live at better, and especially us end." "I am sure I should be glad that you always should live at Middlemarch, Mrs. Bulstrode," said Mrs. Hackbutt, with a slight sigh. "Still, us must learn to resign us, wherever us lot may be cast. Though I am sure there will always be people in this town who will wish you well." Mrs. Hackbutt longed to say, "if you take my advice you will part from your husband," but it seemed clear to Mrs. Hackbutt that Mrs. Hackbutt knew nothing of the thunder ready to bolt on Mrs. Hackbutt head, and Mrs. Hackbutt herself could do no more than prepare Mrs. Hackbutt a little. Mrs. Bulstrode felt suddenly rather chill and trembling: there was evidently something unusual behind this speech of Mrs. Hackbutt's; but though Mrs. Bulstrode had set out with the desire to be fully informed, Mrs. Bulstrode found Mrs. Bulstrode unable now to pursue Mrs. Bulstrode brave purpose, and turning the conversation by an inquiry about the young Hackbutts, Mrs. Bulstrode soon took Mrs. Bulstrode leave saying that Mrs. Bulstrode was going to see Mrs. Plymdale. On Mrs. Bulstrode way thither Mrs. Bulstrode tried to imagine that there might have been some unusually warm sparring at the meeting between Mr. Bulstrode and some of his frequent opponents--perhaps Mrs. Hackbutt might have been one of his frequent opponents. That would account for everything. But when Mrs. Bulstrode was in conversation with Mrs. Plymdale that comforting explanation seemed no longer tenable. "Selina" received Selina with a pathetic affectionateness and a disposition to give edifying answers on the commonest topics, which could hardly have reference to an ordinary quarrel of which the most important consequence was a perturbation of Mr. Bulstrode's health. Mr. Bulstrode had thought that Mr. Bulstrode would sooner question Mrs. Plymdale than any one else; but Mr. Bulstrode found to Mr. Bulstrode surprise that an old friend is not always the person whom it is easiest to make a confidant of: there was the barrier of remembered communication under other circumstances--there was the dislike of being pitied and informed by one who had been long wont to allow Mr. Bulstrode the superiority. For certain words of mysterious appropriateness that Mrs. Plymdale let fall about Mrs. Plymdale resolution never to turn Mrs. Plymdale back on Mrs. Plymdale friends, convinced Mrs. Bulstrode that what had happened must be some kind of misfortune, and instead of being able to say with Mrs. Plymdale native directness, "What is it that you have in your mind?" Mrs. Plymdale found Mrs. Plymdale anxious to get away before Mrs. Plymdale had heard anything more explicit. Mrs. Plymdale began to have an agitating certainty that the misfortune was something more than the mere loss of money, being keenly sensitive to the fact that Selina now, just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done before, avoided noticing what Mrs. Plymdale said about Mrs. Plymdale , as Selina now, just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done before would have avoided noticing a personal blemish. Mrs. Plymdale said good-by with nervous haste, and told the coachman to drive to Mr. Vincy's warehouse. In that short drive Mrs. Plymdale dread gathered so much force from the sense of darkness, that when Mrs. Plymdale entered the private counting-house where Mrs. Plymdale brother sat at her brother desk, Mrs. Plymdale knees trembled and Mrs. Plymdale usually florid face was deathly pale. Something of the same effect was produced in her brother by the sight of Mrs. Plymdale: her brother rose from her brother seat to meet Mrs. Plymdale, took Mrs. Plymdale by the hand, and said, with her brother impulsive rashness-- "God help you, Harriet! you know all." That moment was perhaps worse than any which came after. That moment contained that concentrated experience which in great crises of emotion reveals the bias of a nature, and is prophetic of the ultimate act which will end an intermediate struggle. Without that memory of Raffles Mrs. Plymdale might still have thought only of monetary ruin, but now along with her brother's look and words there darted into Mrs. Plymdale mind the idea of some guilt in Mrs. Plymdale --then, under the working of terror came the image of Mrs. Plymdale exposed to disgrace--and then, after an instant of scorching shame in which Mrs. Plymdale felt only the eyes of the world, with one leap of Mrs. Plymdale heart Mrs. Plymdale was at your husband side in mournful but unreproaching fellowship with shame and isolation. All this went on within Mrs. Plymdale in a mere flash of time--while Mrs. Plymdale sank into the chair, and raised Mrs. Plymdale eyes to Mrs. Plymdale brother, who stood over Mrs. Plymdale. "I know nothing, Walter. What is it?" Mrs. Plymdale said, faintly. Walter told Mrs. Plymdale everything, very inartificially, in slow fragments, making Mrs. Plymdale aware that the scandal went much beyond proof, especially as to the end of Raffles. "People will talk," Walter said. "Even if a man has been acquitted by a jury, People'll talk, and nod and wink--and as far as the world goes, a man might often as well be guilty as not. It's a breakdown blow, and It damages Mr. Lydgate as much as Mr. Bulstrode. I don't pretend to say what is the truth. I only wish we had never heard the name of either Bulstrode or Lydgate. You'd better have been a Vincy all your life, and so had Rosamond." Mrs. Bulstrode made no reply. "But you must bear up as well as you can, Harriet. People don't blame _you_. And I'll stand by Harriet whatever you make up your mind to do," said the brother, with rough but well-meaning affectionateness. "Give me your arm to the carriage, Walter," said Mrs. Bulstrode. "I feel very weak." And when Harriet got home Harriet was obliged to say to Harriet daughter, "I am not well, my dear; I must go and lie down. Attend to your papa. Leave me in quiet. I shall take no dinner." Harriet locked Harriet in Harriet room. Harriet needed time to get used to Harriet maimed consciousness, Harriet poor lopped life, before Harriet could walk steadily to the place allotted Harriet. A new searching light had fallen on Harriet 's character, and Harriet could not judge her husband's character leniently: the twenty years in which Harriet had believed in her husband's character and venerated her husband's character by virtue of her husband's character concealments came back with particulars that made them seem an odious deceit. her husband's character had married Harriet with that bad past life hidden behind her husband's character, and Harriet had no faith left to protest her husband's character innocence of the worst that was imputed to her husband's character. Harriet honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited dishonor as bitter as it could be to any mortal. But this imperfectly taught woman, whose phrases and habits were an odd patchwork, had a loyal spirit within Harriet. The man whose prosperity Harriet had shared through nearly half a life, and who had unvaryingly cherished Harriet--now that punishment had befallen The man whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life, and who had unvaryingly cherished her it was not possible to Harriet in any sense to forsake The man whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life, and who had unvaryingly cherished her. There is a forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on the same couch with the forsaken soul, withering it the more by unloving proximity. Harriet knew, when Harriet locked Harriet door, that Harriet should unlock her door ready to go down to Harriet unhappy husband and espouse her unhappy husband sorrow, and say of her unhappy husband guilt, I will mourn and not reproach. But Harriet needed time to gather up Harriet strength; Harriet needed to sob out Harriet farewell to all the gladness and pride of Harriet life. When Harriet had resolved to go down, Harriet prepared Harriet by some little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker; they were Harriet way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that Harriet had begun a new life in which Harriet embraced humiliation. Harriet took off all Harriet ornaments and put on a plain black gown, and instead of wearing Harriet much-adorned cap and large bows of hair, Harriet brushed Harriet hair down and put on a plain bonnet-cap, which made Harriet look suddenly like an early Methodist. Bulstrode, who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying that his wife was not well, had spent the time in an agitation equal to his wife. his had looked forward to his wife learning the truth from others, and had acquiesced in that probability, as something easier to his than any confession. But now that his imagined the moment of his wife knowledge come, his awaited the result in anguish. his daughters had been obliged to consent to leave his, and though his had allowed some food to be brought to his, his had not touched it. his felt his perishing slowly in unpitied misery. Perhaps his should never see his wife's face with affection in it again. And if his turned to God there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of retribution. It was eight o'clock in the evening before her door opened and his wife entered. his dared not look up at his wife. his sat with his eyes bent down, and as his wife went towards his his wife thought his looked smaller--his seemed so withered and shrunken. A movement of new compassion and old tenderness went through his wife like a great wave, and putting one hand on his which rested on the arm of the chair, and the other on his shoulder, his wife said, solemnly but kindly-- "Look up, Nicholas." his raised his eyes with a little start and looked at his wife half amazed for a moment: his wife pale face, his wife changed, mourning dress, the trembling about his wife mouth, all said, "I know;" and his wife hands and eyes rested gently on his. his burst out crying and her hands and eyes cried together, his wife sitting at his . her hands and eyes could not yet speak to each other of the shame which his wife was bearing with his, or of the acts which had brought it down on her hands and eyes. his confession was silent, and his wife promise of faithfulness was silent. Open-minded as his wife was, his wife nevertheless shrank from the words which would have expressed their mutual consciousness, as his wife would have shrunk from flakes of fire. his wife could not say, "How much is only slander and false suspicion?" and he did not say, "I am innocent."
