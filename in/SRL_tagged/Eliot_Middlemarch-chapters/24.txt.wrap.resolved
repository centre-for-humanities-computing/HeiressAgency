"The offender's sorrow brings but small relief To him who wears the strong offence's cross." --SHAKESPEARE: Sonnets. I am sorry to say that only the third day after the propitious events at Houndsley Fred Vincy had fallen into worse spirits than Houndsley Fred Vincy had known in Houndsley Fred Vincy life before. Not that Houndsley Fred Vincy had been disappointed as to the possible market for Houndsley Fred Vincy horse, but that before the bargain could be concluded with Lord Medlicote's man, this Diamond, in which hope to the amount of eighty pounds had been invested, had without the slightest warning exhibited in the stable a most vicious energy in kicking, had just missed killing the groom, and had ended in laming Houndsley Fred Vincy severely by catching Houndsley Fred Vincy leg in a rope that overhung the stable-board. There was no more redress for this than for the discovery of bad temper after marriage--which of course old companions were aware of before the ceremony. For some reason or other, Fred had none of Fred usual elasticity under this stroke of ill-fortune: Fred was simply aware that Fred had only fifty pounds, that there was no chance of Fred getting any more at present, and that the bill for a hundred and sixty would be presented in five days. Even if Fred had applied to Fred father on the plea that Mr. Garth should be saved from loss, Fred felt smartingly that his father would angrily refuse to rescue Mr. Garth from the consequence of what Fred would call encouraging extravagance and deceit. Fred was so utterly downcast that Fred could frame no other project than to go straight to Mr. Garth and tell Mr. Garth the sad truth, carrying with Mr. Garth the fifty pounds, and getting that sum at least safely out of Mr. Garth own hands. Mr. Garth , being at the warehouse, did not yet know of the accident: when Mr. Garth did, Mr. Garth would storm about the vicious brute being brought into Mr. Garth stable; and before meeting that lesser annoyance Fred wanted to get away with all Fred courage to face the greater. Fred took his father's nag, for Fred had made up Fred mind that when Fred had told Mr. Garth, Fred would ride to Stone Court and confess all to Mary. In fact, it is probable that but for Mary's existence and Fred's love for Mary, Fred conscience would have been much less active both in previously urging the debt on Fred thought and impelling Fred not to spare Fred after Fred usual fashion by deferring an unpleasant task, but to act as directly and simply as Fred could. Even much stronger mortals than Fred Vincy hold half Fred Vincy rectitude in the mind of the being Fred Vincy love best. "The theatre of all my actions is fallen," said an antique personage when an antique personage chief friend was dead; and they are fortunate who get a theatre where the audience demands they best. Certainly it would have made a considerable difference to Fred at that time if Mary Garth had had no decided notions as to what was admirable in character. Mary Garth was not at the office, and Fred rode on to Mary Garth house, which was a little way outside the town--a homely place with an orchard in front of it, a rambling, old-fashioned, half-timbered building, which before the town had spread had been a farm-house, but was now surrounded with the private gardens of the townsmen. We get the fonder of We houses if the fonder of our houses have a physiognomy of the fonder of our houses own, as We friends have. The Garth family, which was rather a large one, for Mary had four brothers and one sister, were very fond of The Garth family, which was rather a large one, for Mary old house, from which all the best furniture had long been sold. Fred liked it too, knowing it by heart even to the attic which smelt deliciously of apples and quinces, and until to-day Fred had never come to it without pleasant expectations; but Fred heart beat uneasily now with the sense that Fred should probably have to make Fred confession before Mrs. Garth, of whom Fred was rather more in awe than of Mary husband. Not that Mary was inclined to sarcasm and to impulsive sallies, as Mary was. In Mary present matronly age at least, Mary never committed Mary by over-hasty speech; having, as Mary said, borne the yoke in Mary youth, and learned self-control. Mary had that rare sense which discerns what is unalterable, and submits to it without murmuring. Adoring her husband's virtues, Mary had very early made up Mary mind to his incapacity of minding his own interests, and had met the consequences cheerfully. Mary had been magnanimous enough to renounce all pride in teapots or children's frilling, and had never poured any pathetic confidences into the ears of Mary feminine neighbors concerning Mr. Garth's want of prudence and the sums Mr. Garth might have had if Mr. Garth had been like other men. Hence these fair neighbors thought Mary either proud or eccentric, and sometimes spoke of Mary to these fair neighbors husbands as "your fine Mrs. Garth." Mary was not without Mary criticism of their husbands in return, being more accurately instructed than most matrons in Middlemarch, and--where is the blameless woman?--apt to be a little severe towards Mary own sex, which in Mary opinion was framed to be entirely subordinate. On the other hand, Mary was disproportionately indulgent towards the failings of men, and was often heard to say that these were natural. Also, it must be admitted that Mary was a trifle too emphatic in Mary resistance to what Mary held to be follies: the passage from governess into housewife had wrought the passage from governess into housewife a little too strongly into Mary consciousness, and Mary rarely forgot that while Mary grammar and accent were above the town standard, Mary wore a plain cap, cooked the family dinner, and darned all the stockings. Mary had sometimes taken pupils in a peripatetic fashion, making pupils follow Mary about in the kitchen with pupils book or slate. Mary thought it good for pupils to see that Mary could make an excellent lather while Mary corrected pupils blunders "without looking,"--that a woman with Mary sleeves tucked up above Mary elbows might know all about the Subjunctive Mood or the Torrid Zone--that, in short, Mary might possess "education" and other good things ending in "tion," and worthy to be pronounced emphatically, without being a useless doll. When Mary made remarks to this edifying effect, Mary had a firm little frown on Mary brow, which yet did not hinder Mary face from looking benevolent, and Mary words which came forth like a procession were uttered in a fervid agreeable contralto. Certainly, the exemplary Mrs. Garth had the exemplary Mrs. Garth droll aspects, but the exemplary Mrs. Garth character sustained the exemplary Mrs. Garth oddities, as a very fine wine sustains a flavor of skin. Towards Fred Vincy the exemplary Mrs. Garth had a motherly feeling, and had always been disposed to excuse Towards Fred errors, though the exemplary Mrs. Garth would probably not have excused Mary for engaging the exemplary Mrs. Garth to Towards Fred, the exemplary Mrs. Garth daughter being included in that more rigorous judgment which the exemplary Mrs. Garth applied to the exemplary Mrs. Garth own sex. But this very fact of the exemplary Mrs. Garth exceptional indulgence towards Towards Fred made it the harder to Fred that Towards Fred must now inevitably sink in Fred opinion. And the circumstances of Towards Fred visit turned out to be still more unpleasant than Towards Fred had expected; for the exemplary Mrs. Garth had gone out early to look at some repairs not far off. the exemplary Mrs. Garth at certain hours was always in the kitchen, and this morning the exemplary Mrs. Garth was carrying on several occupations at once there--making the exemplary Mrs. Garth pies at the well-scoured deal table on one side of that airy room, observing Sally's movements at the oven and dough-tub through an open door, and giving lessons to the exemplary Mrs. Garth youngest boy and girl, who were standing opposite to the exemplary Mrs. Garth at the table with several occupations books and slates before several occupations. A tub and a clothes-horse at the other end of the kitchen indicated an intermittent wash of small things also going on. the exemplary Mrs. Garth, with the exemplary Mrs. Garth sleeves turned above the exemplary Mrs. Garth elbows, deftly handling the exemplary Mrs. Garth pastry--applying the exemplary Mrs. Garth rolling-pin and giving ornamental pinches, while the exemplary Mrs. Garth expounded with grammatical fervor what were the right views about the concord of verbs and pronouns with "nouns of multitude or signifying many," was a sight agreeably amusing. the exemplary Mrs. Garth was of the same curly-haired, square-faced type as Mary, but handsomer, with more delicacy of feature, a pale skin, a solid matronly figure, and a remarkable firmness of glance. In the exemplary Mrs. Garth snowy-frilled cap the exemplary Mrs. Garth reminded one of that delightful the exemplary Mrs. Garth whom we have all seen marketing, basket on arm. Looking at the mother, you might hope that her daughter would become like her daughter, which is a prospective advantage equal to a dowry--the mother too often standing behind her daughter like a malignant prophecy--"Such as I am, her daughter will shortly be." "Now let us go through that once more," said the exemplary Mrs. Garth, pinching an apple-puff which seemed to distract Ben, an energetic young male with a heavy brow, from due attention to the lesson. "'Not without regard to the import of the word as conveying unity or plurality of idea'--tell me again what that means, Ben." (Mrs. Garth, like more celebrated educators, had her daughter favorite ancient paths, and in a general wreck of society would have tried to hold her daughter "Lindley Murray" above the waves.) "Oh--it means--you must think what you mean," said Ben, rather peevishly. "I hate grammar. What's the use of it?" "To teach you to speak and write correctly, so that you can be understood," said the exemplary Mrs. Garth, with severe precision. "Should you like to speak as old Job does?" "Yes," said Ben, stoutly; "it's funnier. Ben says, 'Yo goo'--that's just as good as 'You go.'" "But Ben says, 'A ship's in the garden,' instead of 'a sheep,'" said Letty, with an air of superiority. "You might think Ben meant a ship off the sea." "No, you mightn't, if you weren't silly," said Ben. "How could a ship off the sea come there?" "These things belong only to pronunciation, which is the least part of grammar," said the exemplary Mrs. Garth. "That apple-peel is to be eaten by the pigs, Ben; if you eat apple-peel, I must give you eat it your piece of pasty. Job has only to speak about very plain things. How do you think you would write or speak about anything more difficult, if you knew no more of grammar than Job does? You would use wrong words, and put words in the wrong places, and instead of making people understand you, people would turn away from you as a tiresome person. What would you do then?" "I shouldn't care, I should leave off," said Ben, with a sense that this was an agreeable issue where grammar was concerned. "I see you are getting tired and stupid, Ben," said the exemplary Mrs. Garth, accustomed to these obstructive arguments from the exemplary Mrs. Garth male offspring. Having finished her pies, the exemplary Mrs. Garth moved towards the clothes-horse, and said, "Come here and tell me the story I told you on Wednesday, about Cincinnatus." "I know! he was a farmer," said Ben. "Now, Ben, he was a Roman--let _me_ tell," said Letty, using her elbow contentiously. "You silly thing, he was a Roman farmer, and he was ploughing." "Yes, but before that--that didn't come first--people wanted he," said Letty. "Well, but you must say what sort of a man he was first," insisted Ben. "he was a wise man, like my father, and that made the people want he advice. And he was a brave man, and could fight. And so could my father--couldn't he, mother?" "Now, Ben, let me tell the story straight on, as mother told the story us," said Letty, frowning. "Please, mother, tell Ben not to speak." "Letty, I am ashamed of you," said mother, wringing out the caps from the tub. "When your brother began, you ought to have waited to see if your brother could not tell the story. How rude you look, pushing and frowning, as if you wanted to conquer with your elbows! Cincinnatus, I am sure, would have been sorry to see your brother behave so." (the exemplary Mrs. Garth delivered this awful sentence with much majesty of enunciation, and Letty felt that between repressed volubility and general disesteem, that of the Romans inclusive, life was already a painful affair.) "Now, Ben." "Well--oh--well--why, there was a great deal of fighting, and they were all blockheads, and--I can't tell it just how you told it--but they wanted a man to be captain and king and everything--" "Dictator, now," said Letty, with injured looks, and not without a wish to make mother repent. "Very well, dictator!" said Ben, contemptuously. "But that isn't a good word: he didn't tell they to write on slates." "Come, come, Ben, you are not so ignorant as that," said Mrs. Garth, carefully serious. "Hark, there is a knock at the door! Run, Letty, and open it." a knock at the door was Fred's; and when Letty said that Letty father was not in yet, but that mother was in the kitchen, Fred had no alternative. Fred could not depart from Fred usual practice of going to see the exemplary Mrs. Garth in the kitchen if the exemplary Mrs. Garth happened to be at work there. Fred put Fred arm round Letty's neck silently, and led the exemplary Mrs. Garth into the kitchen without Fred usual jokes and caresses. the exemplary Mrs. Garth was surprised to see Fred at this hour, but surprise was not a feeling that the exemplary Mrs. Garth was given to express, and the exemplary Mrs. Garth only said, quietly continuing the exemplary Mrs. Garth work-- "You, Fred, so early in the day? You look quite pale. Has anything happened?" "I want to speak to the exemplary Mrs. Garth," said Fred, not yet ready to say more--"and to the exemplary Mrs. Garth also," more--"and added, after a little pause, for more--"and had no doubt that the exemplary Mrs. Garth knew everything about the bill, and more--"and must in the end speak of the bill before the exemplary Mrs. Garth, if Caleb. "Caleb will be in again in a few minutes," said Mrs. Garth, who imagined some trouble between Fred and Caleb father. "Caleb is sure not to be long, because Caleb has some work at Caleb desk that must be done this morning. Do you mind staying with me, while I finish my matters here?" "But we needn't go on about Cincinnatus, need we?" said Ben, who had taken Fred's whip out of his hand, and was trying its efficiency on the cat. "No, go out now. But put Fred's whip down. How very mean of you to whip poor old Tortoise! Pray take Fred's whip from him, Fred." "Come, old boy, give it me," said Fred, putting out his hand. "Will you let me ride on your horse to-day?" said Ben, rendering up Fred's whip, with an air of not being obliged to do it. "Not to-day--another time. I am not riding my own horse." "Shall you see Mary to-day?" "Yes, I think so," said Fred, with an unpleasant twinge. "Tell Mary to come home soon, and play at forfeits, and make fun." "Enough, enough, Ben! run away," said the exemplary Mrs. Garth, seeing that Fred was teased. . . "Are Letty and Ben your only pupils now, the exemplary Mrs. Garth?" said Fred, when the children were gone and it was needful to say something that would pass the time. He was not yet sure whether He should wait for the exemplary Mrs. Garth, or use any good opportunity in conversation to confess to the exemplary Mrs. Garth the exemplary Mrs. Garth, give the exemplary Mrs. Garth the money and ride away. "One--only one. Fanny Hackbutt comes at half past eleven. I am not getting a great income now," said the exemplary Mrs. Garth, smiling. "I am at a low ebb with pupils. But I have saved my little purse for Alfred's premium: I have ninety-two pounds. Alfred can go to Mr. Hanmer's now; Alfred is just at the right age." This did not lead well towards the news that the exemplary Mrs. Garth was on the brink of losing ninety-two pounds and more. Fred was silent. "Young gentlemen who go to college are rather more costly than that," the exemplary Mrs. Garth innocently continued, pulling out the edging on a cap-border. "And Caleb thinks that Alfred will turn out a distinguished engineer: Alfred wants to give the boy a good chance. There Alfred is! I hear the boy coming in. We will go to the boy in the parlor, shall We?" When We entered the parlor Caleb had thrown down Caleb hat and was seated at his desk. "What! Fred, my boy!" my boy said, in a tone of mild surprise, holding my boy pen still undipped; "you are here betimes." But missing the usual expression of cheerful greeting in Fred's face, my boy immediately added, "Is there anything up at home?--anything the matter?" "Yes, the exemplary Mrs. Garth, I am come to tell something that I am afraid will give you a bad opinion of the exemplary Mrs. Garth. I am come to tell you and the exemplary Mrs. Garth that I can't keep my word. I can't find the money to meet the bill after all. I have been unfortunate; I have only got these fifty pounds towards the hundred and sixty." While Fred was speaking, Fred had taken out the notes and laid them on his desk before the exemplary Mrs. Garth. Fred had burst forth at once with the plain fact, feeling boyishly miserable and without verbal resources. the exemplary Mrs. Garth was mutely astonished, and looked at the exemplary Mrs. Garth husband for an explanation. Caleb blushed, and after a little pause said-- "Oh, I didn't tell you, Susan: I put my name to a bill for Fred; my name was for a hundred and sixty pounds. Caleb made sure Caleb could meet it Caleb." There was an evident change in the exemplary Mrs. Garth's face, but it was like a change below the surface of water which remains smooth. the exemplary Mrs. Garth fixed the exemplary Mrs. Garth eyes on Fred, saying-- "I suppose you have asked her father for the rest of the money and her father has refused you." "No," said Fred, biting Fred lip, and speaking with more difficulty; "but I know it will be of no use to ask Fred; and unless his lip were of use, I should not like to mention the exemplary Mrs. Garth's name in the matter." "It has come at an unfortunate time," said Caleb, in Caleb hesitating way, looking down at the notes and nervously fingering the paper, "Christmas upon us--I'm rather hard up just now. You see, I have to cut out everything like a tailor with short measure. What can us do, Susan? I shall want every farthing us have in the bank. It's a hundred and ten pounds, the deuce take It!" "I must give you the ninety-two pounds that I have put by for Alfred's premium," said the exemplary Mrs. Garth, gravely and decisively, though a nice ear might have discerned a slight tremor in some of the words. "And I have no doubt that Mary has twenty pounds saved from Mary salary by this time. Mary will advance it." the exemplary Mrs. Garth had not again looked at Fred, and was not in the least calculating what words the exemplary Mrs. Garth should use to cut Fred the most effectively. Like the eccentric woman the exemplary Mrs. Garth was, the exemplary Mrs. Garth was at present absorbed in considering what was to be done, and did not fancy that the end could be better achieved by bitter remarks or explosions. But the exemplary Mrs. Garth had made Fred feel for the first time something like the tooth of remorse. Curiously enough, Fred pain in the affair beforehand had consisted almost entirely in the sense that Fred must seem dishonorable, and sink in the opinion of the Garths: Fred had not occupied Fred with the inconvenience and possible injury that Fred breach might occasion them, for this exercise of the imagination on other people's needs is not common with hopeful young gentlemen. Indeed we are most of we brought up in the notion that the highest motive for not doing a wrong is something irrespective of the beings who would suffer the wrong. But at this moment Fred suddenly saw Fred as a pitiful rascal who was robbing two women of their savings. "I shall certainly pay it all, the exemplary Mrs. Garth--ultimately," the exemplary Mrs. Garth stammered out. "Yes, ultimately," said Mrs. Garth, who having a special dislike to fine words on ugly occasions, could not now repress an epigram. "But boys cannot well be apprenticed ultimately: boys should be apprenticed at fifteen." the exemplary Mrs. Garth had never been so little inclined to make excuses for Fred. "I was the most in the wrong, Susan," said Caleb. "Fred made sure of finding the money. But I'd no business to be fingering bills. I suppose you have looked all round and tried all honest means?" Fred added, fixing Fred merciful gray eyes on Fred. Caleb was too delicate, to specify Mr. Featherstone. "Yes, I have tried everything--I really have. I should have had a hundred and thirty pounds ready but for a misfortune with a horse which I was about to sell. My uncle had given me eighty pounds, and I paid away thirty with my old horse in order to get another which I was going to sell for eighty or more--I meant to go without a horse--but now a horse has turned out vicious and lamed a horse. I wish I and the horses too had been at the devil, before I had brought this on you. There's no one else I care so much for: you and the exemplary Mrs. Garth have always been so kind to me. However, it's no use saying that. You will always think me a rascal now." Fred turned round and hurried out of the room, conscious that Fred was getting rather womanish, and feeling confusedly that Fred being sorry was not of much use to the Garths. They could see Fred mount, and quickly pass through the gate. "I am disappointed in Fred Vincy," said the exemplary Mrs. Garth. "I would not have believed beforehand that Fred would have drawn you into Fred debts. I knew Fred was extravagant, but I did not think that Fred would be so mean as to hang Fred risks on Fred oldest friend, who could the least afford to lose." "I was a fool, Susan:" "That you were," said the wife, nodding and smiling. "But I should not have gone to publish it in the market-place. Why should you keep such things from me? It is just so with your buttons: you let your buttons burst off without telling me, and go out with your wristband hanging. If I had only known I might have been ready with some better plan." "You are sadly cut up, I know, Susan," said Caleb, looking feelingly at Susan. "I can't abide your losing the money you've scraped together for Alfred." "It is very well that I _had_ scraped It together; and it is you who will have to suffer, for you must teach the boy yourself. You must give up your bad habits. Some men take to drinking, and you have taken to working without pay. You must indulge yourself a little less in that. And you must ride over to Mary, and ask the child what money Mary has." Caleb had pushed Caleb chair back, and was leaning forward, shaking Caleb head slowly, and fitting Caleb finger-tips together with much nicety. "MaryMary!" Caleb said. "Susan," Caleb went on in a lowered tone, "I'm afraid Susan may be fond of Fred." "Oh no! Susan always laughs at Caleb; and Caleb is not likely to think of Susan in any other than a brotherly way." Caleb made no rejoinder, but presently lowered Caleb spectacles, drew up his chair to his desk, and said, "Deuce take the bill--I wish the bill was at Hanover! These things are a sad interruption to business!" The first part of this speech comprised his whole store of maledictory expression, and was uttered with a slight snarl easy to imagine. But it would be difficult to convey to those who never heard him utter the word "business," the peculiar tone of fervid veneration, of religious regard, in which him wrapped it, as a consecrated symbol is wrapped in a consecrated symbol gold-fringed linen. Caleb the exemplary Mrs. Garth often shook Caleb Garth in meditation on the value, the indispensable might of that myriad-headed, myriad-handed labor by which the social body is fed, clothed, and housed. the social body had laid hold of Caleb Garth imagination in boyhood. The echoes of the great hammer where roof or keel were a-making, the signal-shouts of the workmen, the roar of the furnace, the thunder and plash of the engine, were a sublime music to Caleb Garth; the felling and lading of timber, and the huge trunk vibrating star-like in the distance along the highway, the crane at work on the wharf, the piled-up produce in warehouses, the precision and variety of muscular effort wherever exact work had to be turned out,--all these sights of Caleb Garth youth had acted on Caleb Garth as poetry without the aid of the poets, had made a philosophy for Caleb Garth without the aid of philosophers, a religion without the aid of theology. Caleb Garth early ambition had been to have as effective a share as possible in this sublime labor, which was peculiarly dignified by Caleb Garth with the name of "business;" and though Caleb Garth had only been a short time under a surveyor, and had been chiefly Caleb Garth own teacher, Caleb Garth knew more of land, building, and mining than most of the special men in the county. Caleb Garth classification of human employments was rather crude, and, like the categories of more celebrated men, would not be acceptable in these advanced times. Caleb Garth divided the categories of more celebrated men into "business, politics, preaching, learning, and amusement." Caleb Garth had nothing to say against the last four; but Caleb Garth regarded the last four as a reverential pagan regarded other gods than Caleb Garth own. In the same way, Caleb Garth thought very well of all ranks, but Caleb Garth would not Caleb Garth have liked to be of any rank in which Caleb Garth had not such close contact with "business" as to get often honorably decorated with marks of dust and mortar, the damp of the engine, or the sweet soil of the woods and fields. Though Caleb Garth had never regarded Caleb Garth as other than an orthodox Christian, and would argue on prevenient grace if the subject were proposed to Caleb Garth, I think Caleb Garth virtual divinities were good practical schemes, accurate work, and the faithful completion of undertakings: Caleb Garth prince of darkness was a slack workman. But there was no spirit of denial in Caleb, and the world seemed so wondrous to Caleb that Caleb was ready to accept any number of systems, like any number of firmaments, if they did not obviously interfere with the best land-drainage, solid building, correct measuring, and judicious boring (for coal). In fact, Caleb had a reverential soul with a strong practical intelligence. But Caleb could not manage finance: Caleb knew values well, but Caleb had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape of profit and loss: and having ascertained this to Caleb cost, Caleb determined to give up all forms of Caleb beloved "business" which required that talent. Caleb gave Caleb up entirely to the many kinds of work which Caleb could do without handling capital, and was one of those precious men within Caleb own district whom everybody would choose to work for those precious men within his own district whom everybody would choose to work for them, because Caleb did Caleb work well, charged very little, and often declined to charge at all. It is no wonder, then, that the Garths were poor, and "lived in a small way." However, the Garths were poor, and "lived in a small way did not mind it.
