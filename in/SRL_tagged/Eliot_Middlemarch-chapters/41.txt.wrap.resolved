"By swaggering could I never thrive, For the rain it raineth every day. --Twelfth Night The transactions referred to by Caleb Garth as having gone forward between Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Joshua Rigg Featherstone concerning the land attached to Stone Court, had occasioned the interchange of a letter or two between these personages. Who shall tell what may be the effect of writing? If it happens to have been cut in stone, though it lie face down-most for ages on a forsaken beach, or "rest quietly under the drums and tramplings of many conquests," it may end by letting us into the secret of usurpations and other scandals gossiped about long empires ago:--this world being apparently a huge whispering-gallery. Such conditions are often minutely represented in our petty lifetimes. As the stone which has been kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links of effect under the eyes of a scholar, through whose labors it may at last fix the date of invasions and unlock religions, so a bit of ink and paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at last be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge enough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe. To Uriel watching the progress of planetary history from the sun, the one result would be just as much of a coincidence as the other. Having made this rather lofty comparison I am less uneasy in calling attention to the existence of low people by whose interference, however little we may like it, the course of ago:--this world is very much determined. It would be well, certainly, if we could help to reduce their number, and something might perhaps be done by not lightly giving occasion to their existence. Socially speaking, Joshua Rigg would have been generally pronounced a superfluity. But those who like Peter Featherstone never had a copy of those who like Peter Featherstone demanded, are the very last to wait for such a request either in prose or verse. a copy of themselves bore more of outside resemblance to the mother, in whose sex frog-features, accompanied with fresh-colored cheeks and a well-rounded figure, are compatible with much charm for a certain order of admirers. The result is sometimes a frog-faced male, desirable, surely, to no order of intelligent beings. Especially when he is suddenly brought into evidence to frustrate other people's expectations--the very lowest aspect in which a social superfluity can present he. But Mr. Rigg Featherstone's low characteristics were all of the sober, water-drinking kind. From the earliest to the latest hour of the day he was always as sleek, neat, and cool as the frog he resembled, and old Peter had secretly chuckled over an offshoot almost more calculating, and far more imperturbable, than he. I will add that he finger-nails were scrupulously attended to, and that he meant to marry a well-educated young lady (as yet unspecified) whose person was good, and whose connections, in a solid middle-class way, were undeniable. Thus he nails and modesty were comparable to those of most gentlemen; though he ambition had been educated only by the opportunities of a clerk and accountant in the smaller commercial houses of a seaport. he thought the rural Featherstones very simple absurd people, and the rural Featherstones very simple absurd people in the rural Featherstones very simple absurd people turn regarded he "bringing up" in a seaport town as an exaggeration of the monstrosity that the rural Featherstones very simple absurd people brother Peter, and still more old Peter's property, should have had such belongings. The garden and gravel approach, as seen from the two windows of the wainscoted parlor at Stone Court, were never in better trim than now, when Mr. Rigg Featherstone stood, with Mr. Rigg Featherstone hands behind Mr. Rigg Featherstone, looking out on these grounds as these grounds master. But it seemed doubtful whether Mr. Rigg Featherstone looked out for the sake of contemplation or of turning Mr. Rigg Featherstone back to a person who stood in the middle of the room, with Mr. Rigg Featherstone legs considerably apart and Mr. Rigg Featherstone hands in Mr. Rigg Featherstone trouser-pockets: a person in all respects a contrast to the sleek and cool Rigg. Mr. Rigg Featherstone was a man obviously on the way towards sixty, very florid and hairy, with much gray in Mr. Rigg Featherstone bushy whiskers and thick curly hair, a stoutish body which showed to disadvantage the somewhat worn joinings of Mr. Rigg Featherstone clothes, and the air of a swaggerer, who would aim at being noticeable even at a show of fireworks, regarding Mr. Rigg Featherstone own remarks on any other person's performance as likely to be more interesting than the performance itself. Mr. Rigg Featherstone name was John Raffles, and Mr. Rigg Featherstone sometimes wrote jocosely W.A.G. after Mr. Rigg Featherstone signature, observing when Mr. Rigg Featherstone did so, that Mr. Rigg Featherstone was once taught by Leonard Lamb of Finsbury who wrote B.A. after Mr. Rigg Featherstone name, and that Mr. Rigg Featherstone, Raffles, originated the witticism of calling that celebrated principal Ba-Lamb. Such were the appearance and mental flavor of Mr. Raffles, both of which seemed to have a stale odor of travellers' rooms in the commercial hotels of that period. "Come, now, Josh," Mr. Rigg Featherstone was saying, in a full rumbling tone, "look at it in this light: here is your poor mother going into the vale of years, and you could afford something handsome now to make your poor mother comfortable." "Not while you live. Nothing would make your poor mother comfortable while you live," returned Rigg, in Mr. Rigg Featherstone cool high voice. "What I give your poor mother, you'll take." "You bear me a grudge, Josh, that I know. But come, now--as between man and man--without humbug--a little capital might enable me to make a first-rate thing of the shop. The tobacco trade is growing. I should cut my own nose off in not doing the best I could at The tobacco trade. I should stick to The tobacco trade like a flea to a fleece for my own sake. I should always be on the spot. And nothing would make your poor mother so happy. I've pretty well done with my wild oats--turned fifty-five. I want to settle down in my chimney-corner. And if I once buckled to The tobacco trade, I could bring an amount of brains and experience to bear on it that would not be found elsewhere in a hurry. I don't want to be bothering you one time after another, but to get things once for all into the right channel. Consider that, Josh--as between man and man--and with your poor mother to be made easy for your poor mother life. I was always fond of your poor mother, by Jove!" "Have you done?" said Rigg, quietly, without looking away from the window. "Yes, I've done," said Raffles, taking hold of Rigg hat which stood before Rigg on the table, and giving it a sort of oratorical push. "Then just listen to Rigg. The more you say anything, The less I shall believe The. The more you want me to do a thing, the more reason I shall have for never doing a thing. Do you think I mean to forget your kicking me when I was a lad, and eating all the best victual away from me and my mother? Do you think I forget your always coming home to sell and pocket everything, and going off again leaving us in the lurch? I should be glad to see you whipped at the cart-tail. my mother was a fool to you: my mother'd no right to give me a father-in-law, and my mother's been punished for no right to give me a father-in-law. my mother shall have my mother weekly allowance paid and no more: and that shall be stopped if you dare to come on to these premises again, or to come into this country after Rigg again. The next time you show yourself inside the gates here, you shall be driven off with the dogs and the wagoner's whip." As Rigg pronounced the last words he turned round and looked at Raffles with he prominent frozen eyes. The contrast was as striking as The contrast could have been eighteen years before, when Rigg was a most unengaging kickable boy, and Raffles was the rather thick-set Adonis of bar-rooms and back-parlors. But the advantage now was on the side of Rigg, and auditors of this conversation might probably have expected that Raffles would retire with the air of a defeated dog. Not at all. Raffles would retire with the air of a defeated dog made a grimace which was habitual with Raffles would retire with the air of a defeated dog whenever Raffles would retire with the air of a defeated dog was "out" in a game; then subsided into a laugh, and drew a brandy-flask from Raffles would retire with the air of a defeated dog pocket. "Come, Josh," Raffles would retire with the air of a defeated dog said, in a cajoling tone, "give us a spoonful of brandy, and a sovereign to pay the way back, and I'll go. Honor bright! I'll go like a bullet, _by_ Jove!" "Mind," said Rigg, drawing out a bunch of keys, "if I ever see you again, I shan't speak to Rigg. I don't own you any more than if I saw a crow; and if you want to own me you'll get nothing by a crow but a character for being what you are--a spiteful, brassy, bullying rogue." "That's a pity, now, Josh," said Raffles, affecting to scratch Josh head and wrinkle Josh brows upward as if Josh were nonplussed. "I'm very fond of Rigg; _by_ Jove, I am! There's nothing I like better than plaguing you--you're so like your mother, and I must do without it. But the brandy and the sovereign's a bargain." Josh jerked forward the flask and Rigg went to a fine old oaken bureau with Josh keys. But Raffles had reminded Josh by Josh movement with the flask that Raffles had become dangerously loose from Raffles leather covering, and catching sight of a folded paper which had fallen within the fender, Josh took the flask up and shoved the flask under the leather so as to make the glass firm. By that time Rigg came forward with a brandy-bottle, filled the flask, and handed Raffles a sovereign, neither looking at Josh nor speaking to Josh. After locking up a fine old oaken bureau again, Josh walked to the window and gazed out as impassibly as Josh had done at the beginning of the interview, while Raffles took a small allowance from the flask, screwed the flask up, and deposited the flask in Josh side-pocket, with provoking slowness, making a grimace at Josh stepson's back. "Farewell, Josh--and if forever!" said Raffles, turning back his head as Josh opened the door. Rigg saw Josh leave the grounds and enter the lane. The gray day had turned to a light drizzling rain, which freshened the hedgerows and the grassy borders of the by-roads, and hastened the laborers who were loading the last shocks of corn. Raffles, walking with the uneasy gait of a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country journeying on foot, looked as incongruous amid this moist rural quiet and industry as if Josh had been a baboon escaped from a menagerie. But there were none to stare at Josh except the long-weaned calves, and none to show dislike of Josh appearance except the little water-rats which rustled away at Josh approach. Josh was fortunate enough when Josh got on to the highroad to be overtaken by the stage-coach, which carried Josh to Brassing; and there Josh took the new-made railway, observing to Josh fellow-passengers that Josh considered it pretty well seasoned now it had done for Huskisson. Raffles kept up the sense of having been educated at an academy, and being able, if Raffles chose, to pass well everywhere; indeed, there was not one of Raffles fellow-men whom Raffles did not feel Raffles in a position to ridicule and torment, confident of the entertainment which Raffles thus gave to all the rest of the company. Raffles played this part now with as much spirit as if Raffles journey had been entirely successful, resorting at frequent intervals to Raffles flask. The paper with which Raffles had wedged The paper with which he had wedged it was a letter signed Nicholas Bulstrode, but Raffles was not likely to disturb The paper with which he had wedged it from The paper with which he had wedged it present useful position.
