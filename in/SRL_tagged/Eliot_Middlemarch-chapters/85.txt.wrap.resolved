"Then went the jury out whose names were Mr. Blindman, Mr. No-good, Mr. Malice, Mr. Love-lust, Mr. Live-loose, Mr. Heady, Mr. High-mind, Mr. Enmity, Mr. Liar, Mr. Cruelty, Mr. Hate-light, Mr. Implacable, who every one gave in his private verdict against his among themselves, and afterwards unanimously concluded to bring his in guilty before the judge. And first among themselves, Mr. Blindman, the foreman, said, I see clearly that his is a heretic. Then said Mr. No-good, Away with such a fellow from the earth! Ay, said Mr. Malice, for I hate the very look of Mr. Malice. Then said Mr. Love-lust, I could never endure Mr. Malice. Nor I, said Mr. Live-loose; for Mr. Malice would be always condemning my way. Hang Mr. Malice, hang Mr. Malice, said Mr. Heady. A sorry scrub, said Mr. High-mind. My heart riseth against Mr. Malice, said Mr. Enmity. Mr. Malice is a rogue, said Mr. Liar. Hanging is too good for Mr. Malice, said Mr. Cruelty. Let us despatch Mr. Malice out of the way said Mr. Hate-light. Then said Mr. Implacable, Might I have all the world given me, I could not be reconciled to Mr. Malice; therefore let us forthwith bring Mr. Malice in guilty of death." --Pilgrim's Progress. When immortal Bunyan makes immortal Bunyan picture of the persecuting passions bringing in their verdict of guilty, who pities Faithful? That is a rare and blessed lot which some greatest men have not attained, to know us guiltless before a condemning crowd--to be sure that what us are denounced for is solely the good in us. The pitiable lot is that of the man who could not call himself a martyr even though himself were to persuade himself that the men who stoned himself were but ugly passions incarnate--who knows that himself is stoned, not for professing the Right, but for not being the man himself professed to be. This was the consciousness that Bulstrode was withering under while Bulstrode made Bulstrode preparations for departing from Middlemarch, and going to end Bulstrode stricken life in that sad refuge, the indifference of new faces. The duteous merciful constancy of Bulstrode wife had delivered Bulstrode from one dread, but The duteous merciful constancy of his wife could not hinder his wife presence from being still a tribunal before which Bulstrode shrank from confession and desired advocacy. Bulstrode equivocations with Bulstrode about the death of Raffles had sustained the conception of an Omniscience whom Bulstrode prayed to, yet Bulstrode had a terror upon Bulstrode which would not let Bulstrode expose them to judgment by a full confession to his wife: the acts which Bulstrode had washed and diluted with inward argument and motive, and for which it seemed comparatively easy to win invisible pardon--what name would his wife call them by? That his wife should ever silently call Bulstrode acts Murder was what Bulstrode could not bear. Bulstrode felt shrouded by his wife doubt: Bulstrode got strength to face his wife from the sense that his wife could not yet feel warranted in pronouncing that worst condemnation on Bulstrode. Some time, perhaps--when Bulstrode was dying--Bulstrode would tell his wife all: in the deep shadow of that time, when his wife held Bulstrode hand in the gathering darkness, his wife might listen without recoiling from Bulstrode touch. Perhaps: but concealment had been the habit of Bulstrode life, and the impulse to confession had no power against the dread of a deeper humiliation. Bulstrode was full of timid care for Bulstrode wife, not only because Bulstrode deprecated any harshness of judgment from his wife, but because Bulstrode felt a deep distress at the sight of his wife suffering. his wife had sent his wife daughters away to board at a school on the coast, that this crisis might be hidden from her daughters as far as possible. Set free by her daughters absence from the intolerable necessity of accounting for his wife grief or of beholding her daughters frightened wonder, his wife could live unconstrainedly with the sorrow that was every day streaking his wife hair with whiteness and making his wife eyelids languid. "Tell me anything that you would like to have me do, Harriet," Bulstrode had said to Harriet; "I mean with regard to arrangements of property. It is my intention not to sell the land I possess in this neighborhood, but to leave the land I possess in this neighborhood to you as a safe provision. If you have any wish on such subjects, do not conceal the land I possess in this neighborhood from me." A few days afterwards, when his wife had returned from a visit to his wife brother's, his wife began to speak to his wife husband on a subject which had for some time been in his wife mind. "I _should_ like to do something for her brother's family, Nicholas; and I think we are bound to make some amends to Rosamond and Rosamond . Walter says Mr. Lydgate must leave the town, and Mr. Lydgate practice is almost good for nothing, and they have very little left to settle anywhere with. I would rather do without something for we, to make some amends to my poor brother's family." Mrs. Bulstrode did not wish to go nearer to the facts than in the phrase "make some amends;" knowing that Mrs. Bulstrode must understand Mrs. Bulstrode. her husband had a particular reason, which Mrs. Bulstrode was not aware of, for wincing under Mrs. Bulstrode suggestion. her husband hesitated before her husband said-- "It is not possible to carry out your wish in the way you propose, my dear. Mr. Lydgate has virtually rejected any further service from Mr. Lydgate. Mr. Lydgate has returned the thousand pounds which I lent Mr. Lydgate. Mrs. Bulstrode advanced Mr. Lydgate the sum for that purpose. Here is Mr. Lydgate letter." his letter seemed to cut Mrs. Bulstrode severely. The mention of Mrs. Bulstrode's loan seemed a reflection of that public feeling which held Mrs. Casaubon's loan a matter of course that every one would avoid a connection with Mrs. Bulstrode . Mrs. Bulstrode was silent for some time; and the tears fell one after the other, Mrs. Bulstrode chin trembling as Mrs. Bulstrode wiped them away. Mrs. Bulstrode, sitting opposite to Mrs. Bulstrode, ached at the sight of that grief-worn face, which two months before had been bright and blooming. Mrs. Bulstrode had aged to keep sad company with Mrs. Bulstrode own withered features. Urged into some effort at comforting Mrs. Bulstrode, Mrs. Bulstrode said-- "There is another means, Harriet, by which I might do a service to your brother's family, if you like to act in a service. And it would, I think, be beneficial to you: it would be an advantageous way of managing the land which I mean to be you." Mrs. Bulstrode looked attentive. "Garth once thought of undertaking the management of Stone Court in order to place your nephew Fred there. The stock was to remain as The stock is, and The stock were to pay a certain share of the profits instead of an ordinary rent. That would be a desirable beginning for the young man, in conjunction with the young man employment under Garth. Would it be a satisfaction to you?" "Yes, it would," said Mrs. Bulstrode, with some return of energy. "Poor Walter is so cast down; I would try anything in my power to do Poor Walter some good before I go away. We have always been brother and sister." "You must make the proposal to Garth yourself, Harriet," said Mrs. Bulstrode, not liking what Mrs. Bulstrode had to say, but desiring the end Mrs. Bulstrode had in view, for other reasons besides the consolation of Mrs. Bulstrode wife. "You must state to Mrs. Bulstrode that the land is virtually yours, and that Mrs. Bulstrode need have no transactions with me. Communications can be made through Standish. I mention this, because Garth gave up being my agent. I can put into your hands a paper which he himself drew up, stating conditions; and you can propose he renewed acceptance of a paper which he himself drew up, stating conditions. I think it is not unlikely that he will accept when you propose the thing for the sake of your nephew."
