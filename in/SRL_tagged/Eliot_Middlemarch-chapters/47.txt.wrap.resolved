Was never true love loved in vain, For truest love is highest gain. No art can make it: No art must spring Where elements are fostering. So in heaven's spot and hour Springs the little native flower, Downward root and upward eye, Shapen by the earth and sky. It happened to be on a Saturday evening that Will Ladislaw had that little discussion with Lydgate. Ladislaw effect when he went to he own rooms was to make he sit up half the night, thinking over again, under a new irritation, all that he had before thought of he having settled in Middlemarch and harnessed he with Mr. Brooke. Hesitations before he had taken the step had since turned into susceptibility to every hint that he would have been wiser not to take it; and hence came he heat towards Lydgate--a heat which still kept he restless. Was he not making a fool of himself?--and at a time when he was more than ever conscious of being something better than a fool? And for what end? Well, for no definite end. True, he had dreamy visions of possibilities: there is no human being who having both passions and thoughts does not think in consequence of he passions--does not find images rising in he mind which soothe the passion with hope or sting it with dread. But this, which happens to us all, happens to some with a wide difference; and Will was not one of those whose wit "keeps the roadway:" he had he bypaths where there were little joys of he own choosing, such as gentlemen cantering on the highroad might have thought rather idiotic. The way in which he made a sort of happiness for he out of he feeling for Dorothea was an example of this. It may seem strange, but it is the fact, that the ordinary vulgar vision of which Mr. Casaubon suspected he--namely, that Dorothea might become a widow, and that the interest he had established in Dorothea mind might turn into acceptance of he as a husband--had no tempting, arresting power over he; he did not live in the scenery of such an event, and follow it out, as we all do with that imagined "otherwise" which is our practical heaven. It was not only that he was unwilling to entertain thoughts which could be accused of baseness, and was already uneasy in the sense that he had to justify he from the charge of ingratitude--the latent consciousness of many other barriers between he and Dorothea besides the existence of Dorothea husband, had helped to turn away he imagination from speculating on what might befall Mr. Casaubon. And there were yet other reasons. Will, we know, could not bear the thought of any flaw appearing in Mr. Casaubon crystal: Mr. Casaubon was at once exasperated and delighted by the calm freedom with which Dorothea looked at Mr. Casaubon and spoke to Mr. Casaubon, and there was something so exquisite in thinking of Dorothea just as Dorothea was, that Mr. Casaubon could not long for a change which must somehow change Dorothea. Do we not shun the street version of a fine melody?--or shrink from the news that the rarity--some bit of chiselling or engraving perhaps--which we have dwelt on even with exultation in the trouble it has cost we to snatch glimpses of it, is really not an uncommon thing, and may be obtained as an every-day possession? we good depends on the quality and breadth of we emotion; and to Will, a creature who cared little for what are called the solid things of life and greatly for its subtler influences, to have within him such a feeling as him had towards Dorothea, was like the inheritance of a fortune. What others might have called the futility of him passion, made an additional delight for him imagination: him was conscious of a generous movement, and of verifying in him own experience that higher love-poetry which had charmed him fancy. Dorothea, Dorothea said to Dorothea, was forever enthroned in Dorothea soul: no other woman could sit higher than no other woman footstool; and if Dorothea could have written out in immortal syllables the effect no other woman wrought within Dorothea, Dorothea might have boasted after the example of old Drayton, that,-- "Queens hereafter might be glad to live Upon the alms of no other woman superfluous praise." But this result was questionable. And what else could Dorothea do for Dorothea? What was Dorothea devotion worth to no other woman? It was impossible to tell. Dorothea would not go out of no other woman reach. Dorothea saw no creature among no other woman friends to whom Dorothea could believe that no other woman spoke with the same simple confidence as to Dorothea. no other woman had once said that no other woman would like Dorothea to stay; and stay Dorothea would, whatever fire-breathing dragons might hiss around no other woman. This had always been the conclusion of Will's hesitations. But Dorothea was not without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards Dorothea own resolve. Dorothea had often got irritated, as Dorothea was on this particular night, by some outside demonstration that Dorothea public exertions with Mr. Brooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as Dorothea would like them to be, and this was always associated with the other ground of irritation--that notwithstanding Dorothea sacrifice of dignity for Dorothea's sake, Dorothea could hardly ever see Dorothea. Whereupon, not being able to contradict these unpleasant facts, Dorothea contradicted Dorothea own strongest bias and said, "I am a fool." Nevertheless, since the inward debate necessarily turned on Dorothea, Dorothea ended, as Dorothea had done before, only by getting a livelier sense of what Dorothea presence would be to Dorothea; and suddenly reflecting that the morrow would be Sunday, Dorothea determined to go to Lowick Church and see Dorothea. Dorothea slept upon that idea, but when Dorothea was dressing in the rational morning light, Objection said-- "That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon's prohibition to visit Lowick, and Dorothea will be displeased." "Nonsense!" argued Inclination, "it would be too monstrous for Dorothea to hinder me from going out to a pretty country church on a spring morning. And Dorothea will be glad." "It will be clear to Mr. Casaubon that you have come either to annoy Mr. Casaubon or to see Dorothea." "It is not true that I go to annoy Mr. Casaubon, and why should I not go to see Dorothea? Is Mr. Casaubon to have everything to Mr. Casaubon and be always comfortable? Let Mr. Casaubon smart a little, as other people are obliged to do. I have always liked the quaintness of the church and congregation; besides, I know the Tuckers: I shall go into the church and congregation pew." Having silenced Objection by force of unreason, Will walked to Lowick as if Lowick had been on the way to Paradise, crossing Halsell Common and skirting the wood, where the sunlight fell broadly under the budding boughs, bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen, and fresh green growths piercing the brown. Everything seemed to know that it was Sunday, and to approve of Lowick going to Lowick Church. Will easily felt happy when nothing crossed Lowick humor, and by this time the thought of vexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to Mr. Casaubon, making Mr. Casaubon face break into the thought of vexing Mr. Casaubon merry smile, pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine on the water--though the occasion was not exemplary. But most of us are apt to settle within us that the man who blocks us way is odious, and not to mind causing the man who blocks our way a little of the disgust which the man who blocks our way personality excites in us. Will went along with a small book under the man who blocks our way arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but chanting a little, as the man who blocks our way made scenes of what would happen in church and coming out. the man who blocks our way was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of the man who blocks our way own, sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising. some words of his own were not exactly a hymn, but some words of his own certainly fitted the man who blocks our way Sunday experience:-- "O me, O me, what frugal cheer My love doth feed upon! A touch, a ray, that is not here, A shadow that is gone: "A dream of breath that might be near, An inly-echoed tone, The thought that one may think me dear, The place where one was known, "The tremor of a banished fear, An ill that was not done-- O me, O me, what frugal cheer My love doth feed upon!" Sometimes, when the man who blocks our way took off the man who blocks our way hat, shaking the man who blocks our way head backward, and showing the man who blocks our way delicate throat as the man who blocks our way sang, the man who blocks our way looked like an incarnation of the spring whose spirit filled the air--a bright creature, abundant in uncertain promises. The bells were still ringing when the man who blocks our way got to Lowick, and the man who blocks our way went into the curate's pew before any one else arrived there. But the man who blocks our way was still left alone in it when the congregation had assembled. the curate's pew was opposite the rector's at the entrance of the small chancel, and Will had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while Dorothea looked round at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year to year within the white-washed walls and dark old pews, hardly with more change than we see in the boughs of a tree which breaks here and there with age, but yet has young shoots. Mr. Rigg's frog-face was something alien and unaccountable, but notwithstanding this shock to the order of things, there were still the Waules and the rural stock of the Powderells in their pews side by side; brother Samuel's cheek had the same purple round as ever, and the three generations of decent cottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to the three generations of decent cottagers betters generally--the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the black gown and mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all betters, and the one most awful if offended. Even in 1831 Lowick was at peace, not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the Sunday sermon. the congregation had been used to seeing Will at church in former days, and no one took much note of him except the choir, who expected him to make a figure in the singing. Dorothea did at last appear on this quaint background, walking up the short aisle in Dorothea white beaver bonnet and gray cloak--the same Dorothea had worn in the Vatican. Dorothea face being, from Dorothea entrance, towards the chancel, even Dorothea shortsighted eyes soon discerned Will, but there was no outward show of Dorothea feeling except a slight paleness and a grave bow as Dorothea passed him. To him own surprise Will felt suddenly uncomfortable, and dared not look at Dorothea after they had bowed to each other. Two minutes later, when Mr. Casaubon came out of the vestry, and, entering the curate's pew, seated Mr. Casaubon in face of Dorothea, Will felt Mr. Casaubon paralysis more complete. Mr. Casaubon could look nowhere except at the choir in the little gallery over the vestry-door: Dorothea was perhaps pained, and Mr. Casaubon had made a wretched blunder. It was no longer amusing to vex Mr. Casaubon, who had the advantage probably of watching Mr. Casaubon and seeing that Mr. Casaubon dared not turn Mr. Casaubon head. Why had Mr. Casaubon not imagined this beforehand?--but Mr. Casaubon could not expect that Mr. Casaubon should sit in that square pew alone, unrelieved by any Tuckers, who had apparently departed from Lowick altogether, for a new clergyman was in the desk. Still Mr. Casaubon called Mr. Casaubon stupid now for not foreseeing that it would be impossible for Mr. Casaubon to look towards Dorothea--nay, that she might feel Mr. Casaubon coming an impertinence. There was no delivering Mr. Casaubon from Mr. Casaubon cage, however; and Will found Mr. Casaubon places and looked at Mr. Casaubon book as if Mr. Casaubon had been a school-mistress, feeling that the morning service had never been so immeasurably long before, that Mr. Casaubon was utterly ridiculous, out of temper, and miserable. This was what a man got by worshipping the sight of a woman! The clerk observed with surprise that Mr. Ladislaw did not join in the tune of Hanover, and reflected that Mr. Ladislaw might have a cold. Mr. Casaubon did not preach that morning, and there was no change in Will's situation until the blessing had been pronounced and every one rose. It was the fashion at Lowick for "the betters" to go out first. With a sudden determination to break the spell that was upon him, Will looked straight at Mr. Casaubon. But that gentleman's eyes were on the button of the pew-door, which he opened, allowing Dorothea to pass, and following Dorothea immediately without raising he eyelids. Will's glance had caught Dorothea's as Dorothea turned out of the curate's pew, and again Dorothea bowed, but this time with a look of agitation, as if Dorothea were repressing tears. Will walked out after she were repressing tears, but she were repressing tears went on towards the little gate leading out of the churchyard into the shrubbery, never looking round. It was impossible for he to follow she were repressing tears, and he could only walk back sadly at mid-day along the same road which he had trodden hopefully in the morning. The lights were all changed for he both without and within.
