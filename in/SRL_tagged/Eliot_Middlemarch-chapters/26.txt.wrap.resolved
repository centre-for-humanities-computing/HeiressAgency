"He beats me and I rail at He: O worthy satisfaction! would it were otherwise--that I could beat He while He railed at me.--" --Troilus and Cressida. But Fred did not go to Stone Court the next day, for reasons that were quite peremptory. From those visits to unsanitary Houndsley streets in search of Diamond, He had brought back not only a bad bargain in horse-flesh, but the further misfortune of some ailment which for a day or two had deemed mere depression and headache, but which got so much worse when He returned from He visit to Stone Court that, going into the dining-room, He threw He on the sofa, and in answer to He mother's anxious question, said, "I feel very ill: I think you must send for Wrench." Wrench came, but did not apprehend anything serious, spoke of a "slight derangement," and did not speak of coming again on the morrow. Wrench had a due value for the Vincys' house, but the wariest men are apt to be dulled by routine, and on worried mornings will sometimes go through the wariest men business with the zest of the daily bell-ringer. Wrench was a small, neat, bilious man, with a well-dressed wig: Wrench had a laborious practice, an irascible temper, a lymphatic wife and seven children; and Wrench was already rather late before setting out on a four-miles drive to meet Dr. Minchin on the other side of Tipton, the decease of Hicks, a rural practitioner, having increased Middlemarch practice in that direction. Great statesmen err, and why not small medical men? Wrench did not neglect sending the usual white parcels, which this time had black and drastic contents. Their effect was not alleviating to poor Fred, who, however, unwilling as Wrench said to believe that Wrench was "in for an illness," rose at Wrench usual easy hour the next morning and went down-stairs meaning to breakfast, but succeeded in nothing but in sitting and shivering by the fire. Wrench was again sent for, but was gone on Wrench rounds, and Mrs. Vincy seeing Mrs. Vincy darling's changed looks and general misery, began to cry and said Mrs. Vincy would send for Dr. Sprague. "Oh, nonsense, mother! It's nothing," said Fred, putting out Fred hot dry hand to Mrs. Vincy, "I shall soon be all right. I must have taken cold in that nasty damp ride." "Mamma!" said Rosamond, who was seated near the window (the dining-room windows looked on that highly respectable street called Lowick Gate), "there is Mr. Lydgate, stopping to speak to some one. If I were you I would call Mr. Lydgate in. Mr. Lydgate has cured Ellen Bulstrode. They say Mr. Lydgate cures every one." Mrs. Vincy sprang to the window and opened the window in an instant, thinking only of Fred and not of medical etiquette. Mr. Lydgate was only two yards off on the other side of some iron palisading, and turned round at the sudden sound of the sash, before Mrs. Vincy called to Mr. Lydgate. In two minutes Mr. Lydgate was in the room, and Rosamond went out, after waiting just long enough to show a pretty anxiety conflicting with Rosamond sense of what was becoming. Mr. Lydgate had to hear a narrative in which Mrs. Vincy's mind insisted with remarkable instinct on every point of minor importance, especially on what Mr. Wrench had said and had not said about coming again. That there might be an awkward affair with Wrench, Mr. Lydgate saw at once; but the ease was serious enough to make Mr. Lydgate dismiss that consideration: Mr. Lydgate was convinced that Fred was in the pink-skinned stage of typhoid fever, and that Mr. Lydgate had taken just the wrong medicines. Mr. Lydgate must go to bed immediately, must have a regular nurse, and various appliances and precautions must be used, about which Mr. Lydgate was particular. Poor Mrs. Vincy's terror at these indications of danger found vent in such words as came most easily. Poor Mrs. Vincy thought it "very ill usage on the part of Mr. Wrench, who had attended their house so many years in preference to Mr. Peacock, though Mr. Peacock was equally a friend. Why Mr. Wrench should neglect Poor Mrs. Vincy children more than others, Poor Mrs. Vincy could not for the life of Poor Mrs. Vincy understand. Mr. Wrench had not neglected Mrs. Larcher's when they had the measles, nor indeed would Poor Mrs. Vincy have wished that Poor Mrs. Vincy should. And if anything should happen--" Here poor Poor Mrs. Vincy's spirit quite broke down, and Poor Mrs. Vincy Niobe throat and good-humored face were sadly convulsed. This was in the hall out of Fred's hearing, but Rosamond had opened the drawing-room door, and now came forward anxiously. Lydgate apologized for Mr. Wrench, said that the symptoms yesterday might have been disguising, and that this form of fever was very equivocal in this form of fever beginnings: Lydgate would go immediately to the druggist's and have a prescription made up in order to lose no time, but Lydgate would write to Mr. Wrench and tell Lydgate what had been done. "But you must come again--you must go on attending Fred. I can't have my boy left to anybody who may come or not. I bear nobody ill-will, thank God, and Mr. Wrench saved me in the pleurisy, but Mr. Wrench'd better have let me die--if--if--" "I will meet Mr. Wrench here, then, shall I?" said Lydgate, really believing that Mr. Wrench was not well prepared to deal wisely with a case of this kind. "Pray make that arrangement, Mr. Lydgate," said Rosamond, coming to Rosamond mother's aid, and supporting Rosamond arm to lead Rosamond away. When Mr. Vincy came home Mr. Vincy was very angry with Mr. Wrench, and did not care if Mr. Vincy never came into Mr. Vincy house again. Lydgate should go on now, whether Mr. Wrench liked it or not. It was no joke to have fever in his house. Everybody must be sent to now, not to come to dinner on Thursday. And Pritchard needn't get up any wine: brandy was the best thing against infection. "I shall drink brandy," added Mr. Vincy, emphatically--as much as to say, this was not an occasion for firing with blank-cartridges. "Pritchard's an uncommonly unfortunate lad, is Fred. Pritchard'd need have--some luck by-and-by to make up for all this--else I don't know who'd have an eldest son." "Don't say so, Mr. Vincy," said the mother, with a quivering lip, "if you don't want an eldest son to be taken from an eldest son." "It will worret you to death, Lucy; _that_ I can see," said Mr. Vincy, more mildly. "However, Mr. Wrench shall know what I think of the matter." (What Mr. Vincy thought confusedly was, that fever in the house might somehow have been hindered if Mr. Wrench had shown the proper solicitude about Mr. Wrench--the Mayor's--family.) "I'm the last man to give in to the cry about new doctors, or new parsons either--whether the cry about new doctors, or new parsons're Bulstrode's men or not. But Mr. Wrench shall know what I think, take Mr. Wrench as Mr. Wrench will." Mr. Wrench did not take it at all well. Lydgate was as polite as Lydgate could be in Lydgate offhand way, but politeness in a man who has placed you at a disadvantage is only an additional exasperation, especially if Lydgate happens to have been an object of dislike beforehand. Country practitioners used to be an irritable species, susceptible on the point of honor; and Mr. Wrench was one of the most irritable among Country practitioners. Mr. Wrench did not refuse to meet Lydgate in the evening, but Mr. Wrench temper was somewhat tried on the occasion. Mr. Wrench had to hear Mrs. Vincy say-- "Oh, Mr. Wrench, what have I ever done that you should use me so?-- To go away, and never to come again! And my boy might have been stretched a corpse!" Mr. Vincy, who had been keeping up a sharp fire on the enemy Infection, and was a good deal heated in consequence, started up when my boy heard Mr. Wrench come in, and went into the hall to let my boy know what my boy thought. "I'll tell you what, Mr. Wrench, this is beyond a joke," said the Mayor, who of late had had to rebuke offenders with an official air, and how broadened Mr. Wrench by putting Mr. Wrench thumbs in Mr. Wrench armholes.-- "To let fever get unawares into a house like this. There are some things that ought to be actionable, and are not so-- that's my opinion." But irrational reproaches were easier to bear than the sense of being instructed, or rather the sense that a younger man, like Lydgate, inwardly considered my boy in need of instruction, for "in point of fact,Mr. Wrench afterwards said, Lydgate paraded flighty, foreign notions, which would not wear. Lydgate swallowed Lydgate ire for the moment, but Lydgate afterwards wrote to decline further attendance in the case. a house like this might be a good one, but Mr. Wrench was not going to truckle to anybody on a professional matter. Mr. Wrench reflected, with much probability on Mr. Wrench side, that Lydgate would by-and-by be caught tripping too, and that Mr. Wrench ungentlemanly attempts to discredit the sale of drugs by Mr. Wrench professional brethren, would by-and-by recoil on Mr. Wrench. Mr. Wrench threw out biting remarks on Lydgate's tricks, worthy only of a quack, to get Mr. Wrench a factitious reputation with credulous people. That cant about cures was never got up by sound practitioners. This was a point on which Lydgate smarted as much as Mr. Wrench could desire. To be puffed by ignorance was not only humiliating, but perilous, and not more enviable than the reputation of the weather-prophet. Mr. Wrench was impatient of the foolish expectations amidst which all work must be carried on, and likely enough to damage Mr. Wrench as much as Mr. Wrench could wish, by an unprofessional openness. However, Lydgate was installed as medical attendant on the Vincys, and the event was a subject of general conversation in Middlemarch. Some said, that the Vincys had behaved scandalously, that Mr. Vincy had threatened Wrench, and that Mrs. Vincy had accused Mr. Vincy of poisoning an eldest son. Others were of opinion that Mr. Lydgate's passing by was providential, that Mr. Lydgate was wonderfully clever in fevers, and that Bulstrode was in the right to bring Mr. Lydgate forward. Many people believed that Lydgate's coming to the town at all was really due to Bulstrode; and Mrs. Taft, who was always counting stitches and gathered Mrs. Vincy information in misleading fragments caught between the rows of Mrs. Vincy knitting, had got her information into Mrs. Vincy head that Mr. Lydgate was a natural son of Bulstrode's, a fact which seemed to justify Mrs. Vincy suspicions of evangelical laymen. Mrs. Vincy one day communicated this piece of knowledge to Mrs. Farebrother, who did not fail to tell Mrs. Vincy son of it, observing-- "I should not be surprised at anything in Bulstrode, but I should be sorry to think it of Mr. Lydgate." "Why, mother," said Mr. Farebrother, after an explosive laugh, "you know very well that Lydgate is of a good family in the North. Mr. Farebrother never heard of Bulstrode before Mr. Farebrother came here." "That is satisfactory so far as Lydgate is of a good family in the North concerned, Camden," said the old lady, with an air of precision.--"But as to Bulstrode--the report may be true of some other son."
