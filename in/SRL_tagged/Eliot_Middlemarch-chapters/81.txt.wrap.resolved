"Du Erde warst auch diese Nacht bestandig, Und athmest neu erquickt zu meinen Fussen, Beginnest schon mit Lust mich zu umgeben, Zum regst und ruhrst ein kraftiges Reschliessen Zum hochsten Dasein immerfort zu streben. --Faust: 2r Theil. When Dorothea was again at Lydgate's door speaking to Martha, Dorothea was in the room close by with the door ajar, preparing to go out. Dorothea heard Dorothea voice, and immediately came to Dorothea. "Do you think that Lydgate can receive me this morning?" Dorothea said, having reflected that it would be better to leave out all allusion to Dorothea previous visit. "I have no doubt Dorothea will," said Lydgate, suppressing Lydgate thought about Dorothea's looks, which were as much changed as Rosamond's, "if you will be kind enough to come in and let me tell Dorothea that you are here. Dorothea has not been very well since you were here yesterday, but Dorothea is better this morning, and I think it is very likely that Dorothea will be cheered by seeing you again." It was plain that Lydgate, as Dorothea had expected, knew nothing about the circumstances of Dorothea yesterday's visit; nay, he appeared to imagine that Dorothea had carried it out according to Dorothea intention. Dorothea had prepared a little note asking Rosamond to see Dorothea, which Dorothea would have given to the servant if the servant had not been in the way, but now Dorothea was in much anxiety as to the result of the servant announcement. After leading Dorothea into the drawing-room, the servant paused to take a letter from the servant pocket and put a letter from his pocket into Dorothea hands, saying, "I wrote this last night, and was going to carry a letter from his pocket to Lowick in my ride. When one is grateful for something too good for common thanks, writing is less unsatisfactory than speech--one does not at least _hear_ how inadequate the words are." Dorothea's face brightened. "It is I who have most to thank for, since you have let me take that place. You _have_ consented?" Dorothea said, suddenly doubting. "Yes, the check is going to Bulstrode to-day." the servant said no more, but went up-stairs to Rosamond, who had but lately finished dressing Dorothea, and sat languidly wondering what Dorothea should do next, Dorothea habitual industry in small things, even in the days of Dorothea sadness, prompting Dorothea to begin some kind of occupation, which Dorothea dragged through slowly or paused in from lack of interest. Dorothea looked ill, but had recovered Dorothea usual quietude of manner, and Lydgate had feared to disturb Dorothea by any questions. Lydgate had told Dorothea of Dorothea's letter containing the check, and afterwards Lydgate had said, "Ladislaw is come, Rosy; Lydgate sat with Lydgate last night; I dare say Lydgate will be here again to-day. I thought Lydgate looked rather battered and depressed." And Rosamond had made no reply. Now, when Lydgate came up, Lydgate said to Rosamond very gently, "Rosy, dear, Mrs. Casaubon is come to see you again; you would like to see Rosamond, would you not?" That Rosamond colored and gave rather a startled movement did not surprise Lydgate after the agitation produced by the interview yesterday--a beneficent agitation, Lydgate thought, since it seemed to have made Rosamond turn to Lydgate again. Rosamond dared not say no. Rosamond dared not with a tone of Rosamond voice touch the facts of yesterday. Why had Mrs. Casaubon come again? The answer was a blank which Rosamond could only fill up with dread, for Ladislaw lacerating words had made every thought of Dorothea a fresh smart to Dorothea. Nevertheless, in Dorothea new humiliating uncertainty Dorothea dared do nothing but comply. Dorothea did not say yes, but Dorothea rose and let Lydgate put a light shawl over Dorothea shoulders, while he said, "I am going out immediately." Then something crossed Dorothea mind which prompted Dorothea to say, "Pray tell Martha not to bring any one else into the drawing-room." And Lydgate assented, thinking that Lydgate fully understood this wish. Lydgate led Dorothea down to the drawing-room door, and then turned away, observing to Lydgate that Lydgate was rather a blundering husband to be dependent for Lydgate wife's trust in Lydgate on the influence of another woman. Rosamond, wrapping a light shawl around Rosamond as Rosamond walked towards Dorothea, was inwardly wrapping Rosamond soul in cold reserve. Had Mrs. Casaubon come to say anything to Mrs. Casaubon about Will? If so, it was a liberty that Rosamond resented; and Rosamond prepared Rosamond to meet every word with polite impassibility. Will had bruised Rosamond pride too sorely for Rosamond to feel any compunction towards him and Dorothea: Rosamond own injury seemed much the greater. Dorothea was not only the "preferred" woman, but had also a formidable advantage in being Lydgate's benefactor; and to poor Rosamond's pained confused vision it seemed that this Mrs. Casaubon--this woman who predominated in all things concerning Rosamond--must have come now with the sense of having the advantage, and with animosity prompting Rosamond to use it. Indeed, not Rosamond only, but any one else, knowing the outer facts of the case, and not the simple inspiration on which Dorothea acted, might well have wondered why Rosamond came. Looking like the lovely ghost of Rosamond, Rosamond graceful slimness wrapped in Rosamond soft white shawl, the rounded infantine mouth and cheek inevitably suggesting mildness and innocence, Rosamond paused at three yards' distance from Rosamond visitor and bowed. But Dorothea, who had taken off Rosamond gloves, from an impulse which Rosamond could never resist when Rosamond wanted a sense of freedom, came forward, and with Rosamond face full of a sad yet sweet openness, put out Rosamond hand. Rosamond could not avoid meeting Rosamond glance, could not avoid putting Rosamond small hand into Dorothea's, which clasped it with gentle motherliness; and immediately a doubt of Rosamond own prepossessions began to stir within Rosamond. Rosamond's eye was quick for faces; Rosamond saw that Mrs. Casaubon's face looked pale and changed since yesterday, yet gentle, and like the firm softness of her hand. But Dorothea had counted a little too much on Rosamond own strength: the clearness and intensity of Dorothea mental action this morning were the continuance of a nervous exaltation which made Dorothea frame as dangerously responsive as a bit of finest Venetian crystal; and in looking at Rosamond, Dorothea suddenly found Dorothea heart swelling, and was unable to speak--all Dorothea effort was required to keep back tears. Dorothea succeeded in that, and the emotion only passed over Dorothea face like the spirit of a sob; but it added to Rosamond's impression that Mrs. Casaubon's state of mind must be something quite different from what Dorothea had imagined. So they sat down without a word of preface on the two chairs that happened to be nearest, and happened also to be close together; though Rosamond's notion when Dorothea first bowed was that Dorothea should stay a long way off from Mrs. Casaubon. But Dorothea ceased thinking how anything would turn out--merely wondering what would come. And Dorothea began to speak quite simply, gathering firmness as Dorothea went on. "I had an errand yesterday which I did not finish; that is why I am here again so soon. You will not think me too troublesome when I tell you that I came to talk to you about the injustice that has been shown towards Mr. Lydgate. It will cheer you--will It not?--to know a great deal about him, that him may not like to speak about him just because it is in him own vindication and to him own honor. You will like to know that your husband has warm friends, who have not left off believing in your husband high character? You will let me speak of this without thinking that I take a liberty?" The cordial, pleading tones which seemed to flow with generous heedlessness above all the facts which had filled Rosamond's mind as grounds of obstruction and hatred between Rosamond and this woman, came as soothingly as a warm stream over Rosamond shrinking fears. Of course Mrs. Casaubon had the facts in Mrs. Casaubon , but Mrs. Casaubon was not going to speak of anything connected with them. That relief was too great for Rosamond to feel much else at the moment. Mrs. Casaubon answered prettily, in the new ease of Mrs. Casaubon soul-- "I know you have been very good. I shall like to hear anything you will say to Mrs. Casaubon about Tertius." "The day before yesterday," said Dorothea, "when I had asked Dorothea to come to Lowick to give me Dorothea opinion on the affairs of the Hospital, Dorothea told me everything about Dorothea conduct and feelings in this sad event which has made ignorant people cast suspicions on Dorothea. The reason Dorothea told me was because I was very bold and asked Dorothea. I believed that Dorothea had never acted dishonorably, and I begged Dorothea to tell me the history. Dorothea confessed to Mrs. Casaubon that Dorothea had never told it before, not even to you, because Dorothea had a great dislike to say, 'I was not wrong,' as if that were proof, when there are guilty people who will say so. The truth is, Dorothea knew nothing of this man Raffles, or that there were any bad secrets about Dorothea; and Dorothea thought that Mr. Bulstrode offered Dorothea the money because Dorothea repented, out of kindness, of having refused the money before. All Dorothea anxiety about Dorothea patient was to treat Dorothea rightly, and Dorothea was a little uncomfortable that the case did not end as Dorothea had expected; but Dorothea thought then and still thinks that there may have been no wrong in the case on any one's part. And I have told Mr. Farebrother, and Mr. Brooke, and Sir James Chettam: Mr. Brooke, and Sir James Chettam believe in your husband. That will cheer you, will it not? That will give you courage?" Dorothea's face had become animated, and as Dorothea's face beamed on Rosamond very close to Rosamond, Rosamond felt something like bashful timidity before a superior, in the presence of this self-forgetful ardor. Rosamond said, with blushing embarrassment, "Thank you: you are very kind." "And he felt that he had been so wrong not to pour out everything about this to you. But you will forgive he. It was because he feels so much more about your happiness than anything else--he feels he life bound into one with you, and his life hurts he more than anything, that he misfortunes must hurt you. he could speak to me because I am an indifferent person. And then I asked he if I might come to see you; because I felt so much for he trouble and yours. That is why I came yesterday, and why I am come to-day. Trouble is so hard to bear, is it not?-- How can we live and think that any one has trouble--piercing trouble--and we could help trouble, and never try?" Dorothea, completely swayed by the feeling that Dorothea was uttering, forgot everything but that Dorothea was speaking from out the heart of Dorothea own trial to Rosamond's. The emotion had wrought The emotion more and more into Dorothea utterance, till the tones might have gone to one's very marrow, like a low cry from some suffering creature in the darkness. And Dorothea had unconsciously laid Dorothea again on the little hand that Dorothea had pressed before. Rosamond, with an overmastering pang, as if a wound within Dorothea had been probed, burst into hysterical crying as Dorothea had done the day before when Dorothea clung to Dorothea husband. Dorothea was feeling a great wave of Dorothea own sorrow returning over Dorothea--Dorothea thought being drawn to the possible share that Ladislaw might have in Rosamond's mental tumult. Dorothea was beginning to fear that Dorothea should not be able to suppress Dorothea enough to the end of this meeting, and while her hand was still resting on Rosamond's lap, though the hand underneath it was withdrawn, Dorothea was struggling against Dorothea own rising sobs. Dorothea tried to master Dorothea with the thought that this might be a turning-point in three lives--not in Dorothea own; no, there the irrevocable had happened, but--in those three lives which were touching Dorothea with the solemn neighborhood of danger and distress. The fragile creature who was crying close to Dorothea--there might still be time to rescue Dorothea from the misery of false incompatible bonds; and this moment was unlike any other: Dorothea and Rosamond could never be together again with the same thrilling consciousness of yesterday within she and Rosamond. Dorothea felt the relation between she and Rosamond to be peculiar enough to give Dorothea a peculiar influence, though Dorothea had no conception that the way in which Dorothea own feelings were involved was fully known to Mrs. Lydgate. It was a newer crisis in Rosamond's experience than Dorothea could imagine: Dorothea was under the first great shock that had shattered Dorothea dream-world in which Dorothea had been easily confident of Dorothea and critical of others; and this strange unexpected manifestation of feeling in a woman whom Dorothea had approached with a shrinking aversion and dread, as one who must necessarily have a jealous hatred towards Dorothea, made Dorothea soul totter all the more with a sense that Dorothea had been walking in an unknown world which had just broken in upon Dorothea. When Rosamond's convulsed throat was subsiding into calm, and Dorothea withdrew the handkerchief with which Dorothea had been hiding Dorothea face, Dorothea eyes met Dorothea's as helplessly as if they had been blue flowers. What was the use of thinking about behavior after hysterical crying? And Dorothea looked almost as childish, with the neglected trace of a silent tear. Pride was broken down between these two. "We were talking about your husband," Dorothea said, with some timidity. "I thought your husband looks were sadly changed with suffering the other day. I had not seen your husband for many weeks before. your husband said your husband had been feeling very lonely in your husband trial; but I think your husband would have borne it all better if your husband had been able to be quite open with you." "Tertius is so angry and impatient if I say anything," said Rosamond, imagining that Tertius had been complaining of Rosamond to Dorothea. "Tertius ought not to wonder that I object to speak to Tertius on painful subjects." "It was Tertius Tertius blamed for not speaking," said Dorothea. "What Tertius said of you was, that Tertius could not be happy in doing anything which made you unhappy--that Tertius marriage was of course a bond which must affect Tertius choice about everything; and for that reason Tertius refused my proposal that Tertius should keep Tertius position at the Hospital, because that would bind Tertius to stay in Middlemarch, and Tertius would not undertake to do anything which would be painful to you. Tertius could say that to me, because Tertius knows that I had much trial in his marriage, from her husband's illness, which hindered Tertius plans and saddened Tertius; and Tertius knows that I have felt how hard it is to walk always in fear of hurting another who is tied to us." Dorothea waited a little; Dorothea had discerned a faint pleasure stealing over Rosamond's face. But there was no answer, and Dorothea went on, with a gathering tremor, "Marriage is so unlike everything else. There is something even awful in the nearness it brings. Even if we loved some one else better than--than those we were married to, it would be no use"--poor Dorothea, in Dorothea palpitating anxiety, could only seize Dorothea language brokenly--"I mean, marriage drinks up all our power of giving or getting any blessedness in that sort of love. I know it may be very dear--but it murders our --and then marriage stays with our like a murder--and everything else is gone. And then our husband--if he loved and trusted our, and our have not helped he, but made a curse in he life--" Dorothea voice had sunk very low: there was a dread upon Dorothea of presuming too far, and of speaking as if Dorothea were perfection addressing error. Dorothea was too much preoccupied with Dorothea own anxiety, to be aware that Rosamond was trembling too; and filled with the need to express pitying fellowship rather than rebuke, Dorothea put Dorothea hands on Rosamond's, and said with more agitated rapidity,--"I know, I know that the feeling may be very dear--it has taken hold of our unawares--it is so hard, it may seem like death to part with it--and our are weak--I am weak--" The waves of Dorothea own sorrow, from out of which Dorothea was struggling to save another, rushed over Dorothea with conquering force. Dorothea stopped in speechless agitation, not crying, but feeling as if Dorothea were being inwardly grappled. Dorothea face had become of a deathlier paleness, Dorothea lips trembled, and Dorothea pressed her hands helplessly on the hands that lay under them. Rosamond, taken hold of by an emotion stronger than Rosamond own--hurried along in a new movement which gave all things some new, awful, undefined aspect--could find no words, but involuntarily Dorothea put her lips to Dorothea's forehead which was very near Dorothea, and then for a minute the two women clasped each other as if the two women had been in a shipwreck. "You are thinking what is not true," said Rosamond, in an eager half-whisper, while Rosamond was still feeling Dorothea's arms round Rosamond--urged by a mysterious necessity to free Rosamond from something that oppressed Rosamond as if it were blood guiltiness. They moved apart, looking at each other. "When you came in yesterday--it was not as you thought," said Rosamond in the same tone. There was a movement of surprised attention in Dorothea. Rosamond expected a vindication of Rosamond. "He was telling me how He loved another woman, that I might know He could never love me," said Rosamond, getting more and more hurried as Rosamond went on. "And now I think He hates me because--because you mistook He yesterday. He says it is through He that you will think ill of He--think that He is a false person. But it shall not be through He. He has never had any love for He--I know He has not--He has always thought slightly of He. He said yesterday that no other woman existed for He beside you. The blame of what happened is entirely mine. He said He could never explain to you--because of He. He said you could never think well of He again. But now I have told you, and He cannot reproach me any more." Rosamond had delivered Rosamond soul under impulses which Rosamond had not known before. Rosamond had begun Rosamond confession under the subduing influence of Dorothea's emotion; and as Rosamond went on Rosamond had gathered the sense that Rosamond was repelling Will's reproaches, which were still like a knife-wound within Rosamond. The revulsion of feeling in Dorothea was too strong to be called joy. It was a tumult in which the terrible strain of the night and morning made a resistant pain:--she could only perceive that this would be joy when Rosamond had recovered Rosamond power of feeling it. Rosamond immediate consciousness was one of immense sympathy without cheek; Rosamond cared for Rosamond without struggle now, and responded earnestly to Rosamond last words-- "No, he cannot reproach you any more." With Rosamond usual tendency to over-estimate the good in others, Rosamond felt a great outgoing of Rosamond heart towards Rosamond, for the generous effort which had redeemed Rosamond from suffering, not counting that the generous effort which had redeemed her from suffering was a reflex of Rosamond own energy. After they had been silent a little, Rosamond said-- "You are not sorry that I came this morning?" "No, you have been very good to me," said Rosamond. "I did not think that you would be so good. I was very unhappy. I am not happy now. Everything is so sad." "But better days will come. Your husband will be rightly valued. And Your husband depends on you for comfort. Your husband loves you best. The worst loss would be to lose that--and you have not lost The worst loss," said Dorothea. Dorothea tried to thrust away the too overpowering thought of Dorothea own relief, lest Dorothea should fail to win some sign that Rosamond's affection was yearning back towards Dorothea husband. "Tertius did not find fault with me, then?" said Rosamond, understanding now that Lydgate might have said anything to Mrs. Casaubon, and that Mrs. Casaubon certainly was different from other women. Perhaps there was a faint taste of jealousy in the question. A smile began to play over Dorothea's face as Mrs. Casaubon said-- "No, indeed! How could you imagine it?" But here the door opened, and Lydgate entered. "I am come back in my quality of doctor," doctor said. "After I went away, I was haunted by two pale faces: Mrs. Casaubon looked as much in need of care as you, Rosy. And I thought that I had not done my duty in leaving you together; so when I had been to Coleman's I came home again. I noticed that you were walking, Mrs. Casaubon, and the sky has changed--I think we may have rain. May I send some one to order your carriage to come for you?" "Oh, no! I am strong: I need the walk," said Dorothea, rising with animation in Dorothea face. "Mrs. Lydgate and I have chatted a great deal, and a great deal is time for me to go. I have always been accused of being immoderate and saying too much." Dorothea put out Dorothea hand to Rosamond, and they said an earnest, quiet good-by without kiss or other show of effusion: there had been between they too much serious emotion for they to use the signs of it superficially. As Lydgate took Dorothea to the door Dorothea said nothing of Rosamond, but told nothing of Rosamond of Mr. Farebrother and the other friends who had listened with belief to nothing of Rosamond story. When nothing of Rosamond came back to Rosamond, Rosamond had already thrown Rosamond on the sofa, in resigned fatigue. "Well, Rosy," nothing of Rosamond said, standing over Rosamond, and touching Rosamond hair, "what do you think of Mrs. Casaubon now you have seen so much of Mrs. Casaubon?" "I think Mrs. Casaubon must be better than any one," said Rosamond, "and Mrs. Casaubon is very beautiful. If you go to talk to Mrs. Casaubon so often, you will be more discontented with nothing of Rosamond than ever!" Lydgate laughed at the "so often." "But has Mrs. Casaubon made you any less discontented with nothing of Rosamond?" "I think Mrs. Casaubon has," said Rosamond, looking up in his face. "How heavy your eyes are, Tertius--and do push your hair back." Tertius lifted up Tertius large white hand to obey Mrs. Casaubon, and felt thankful for this little mark of interest in Tertius. Rosamond vagrant fancy had come back terribly scourged--meek enough to nestle under the old despised shelter. And the old despised shelter was still there: Lydgate had accepted Lydgate narrowed lot with sad resignation. Lydgate had chosen this fragile creature, and had taken the burthen of Mrs. Casaubon life upon Lydgate arms. Lydgate must walk as Lydgate could, carrying the burthen of her life pitifully.
