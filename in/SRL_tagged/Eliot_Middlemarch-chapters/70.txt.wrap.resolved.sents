Our deeds still travel with Our from afar, And what Our have been makes Our what Our are."
Bulstrode's first object after Lydgate had left Stone Court was to examine Raffles's pockets, which he imagined were sure to carry signs in the shape of hotel-bills of the places he had stopped in, if he had not told the truth in saying that he had come straight from Liverpool because he was ill and had no money.
There were various bills crammed into he pocketbook, but none of a later date than Christmas at any other place, except one, which bore date that morning.
This was crumpled up with a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of he tail-pockets, and represented the cost of three days' stay at an inn at Bilkley, where the fair was held--a town at least forty miles from Middlemarch.
a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his tail-pockets was heavy, and since Raffles had no luggage with a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his tail-pockets, a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his tail-pockets seemed probable that a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his tail-pockets had left a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his tail-pockets portmanteau behind in payment, in order to save money for a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his tail-pockets travelling fare; for a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his tail-pockets purse was empty, and a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his tail-pockets had only a couple of sixpences and some loose pence in a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his tail-pockets pockets.
Bulstrode gathered a sense of safety from these indications that Raffles had really kept at a distance from Middlemarch since Bulstrode memorable visit at Christmas.
At a distance and among people who were strangers to Bulstrode, what satisfaction could there be to Raffles's tormenting, self-magnifying vein in telling old scandalous stories about a Middlemarch banker?
And what harm if a Middlemarch banker did talk?
The chief point now was to keep watch over a Middlemarch banker as long as there was any danger of that intelligible raving, that unaccountable impulse to tell, which seemed to have acted towards Caleb Garth; and Bulstrode felt much anxiety lest some such impulse should come over a Middlemarch banker at the sight of Lydgate.
a Middlemarch banker sat up alone with a Middlemarch banker through the night, only ordering the housekeeper to lie down in the housekeeper clothes, so as to be ready when a Middlemarch banker called the housekeeper, alleging a Middlemarch banker own indisposition to sleep, and a Middlemarch banker anxiety to carry out the doctor's orders.
a Middlemarch banker did carry the doctor's orders out faithfully, although Raffles was incessantly asking for brandy, and declaring that a Middlemarch banker was sinking away--that the earth was sinking away from under a Middlemarch banker.
a Middlemarch banker was restless and sleepless, but still quailing and manageable.
On the offer of the food ordered by Lydgate, which a Middlemarch banker refused, and the denial of other things which a Middlemarch banker demanded, a Middlemarch banker seemed to concentrate all a Middlemarch banker terror on Bulstrode, imploringly deprecating a Middlemarch banker anger, a Middlemarch banker revenge on a Middlemarch banker by starvation, and declaring with strong oaths that a Middlemarch banker had never told any mortal a word against a Middlemarch banker.
Bulstrode felt that Bulstrode would not have liked Lydgate to hear; but a more alarming sign of fitful alternation in Bulstrode delirium was, that in-the morning twilight Raffles suddenly seemed to imagine a doctor present, addressing Bulstrode and declaring that Bulstrode wanted to starve Bulstrode to death out of revenge for telling, when Bulstrode never had told.
Bulstrode's native imperiousness and strength of determination served Bulstrode well.
This delicate-looking man, Bulstrode nervously perturbed, found the needed stimulus in Bulstrode strenuous circumstances, and through that difficult night and morning, while Bulstrode had the air of an animated corpse returned to movement without warmth, holding the mastery by its chill impassibility Bulstrode mind was intensely at work thinking of what Bulstrode had to guard against and what would win Bulstrode security.
Whatever prayers Bulstrode might lift up, whatever statements Bulstrode might inwardly make of this man's wretched spiritual condition, and the duty Bulstrode was under to submit to the punishment divinely appointed for Bulstrode rather than to wish for evil to another--through all this effort to condense words into a solid mental state, there pierced and spread with irresistible vividness the images of the events Bulstrode desired.
And in the train of those images came those images apology.
Bulstrode could not but see the death of Raffles, and see in the death of Raffles Bulstrode own deliverance.
What was the removal of this wretched creature?
Bulstrode was impenitent--but were not public criminals impenitent?--yet the law decided on public criminals fate.
Should Providence in the death of Raffles, there was no sin in contemplating death as the desirable issue--if Bulstrode kept Bulstrode hands from hastening his hands--if Bulstrode scrupulously did what was prescribed.
Even here there might be a mistake: human prescriptions were fallible things: Lydgate had said that treatment had hastened death,--why not Lydgate own method of treatment?
But of course intention was everything in the question of right and wrong.
And Bulstrode set Bulstrode to keep Bulstrode separate from Bulstrode desire.
Bulstrode inwardly declared that Bulstrode intended to obey orders.
Why should Bulstrode have got into any argument about the validity of these orders?
It was only the common trick of desire--which avails It of any irrelevant scepticism, finding larger room for It in all uncertainty about effects, in every obscurity that looks like the absence of law.
Still, Bulstrode did obey these orders.
Bulstrode anxieties continually glanced towards Lydgate, and Bulstrode remembrance of what had taken place between them the morning before was accompanied with sensibilities which had not been roused at all during the actual scene.
Bulstrode had then cared but little about Lydgate's painful impressions with regard to the suggested change in the Hospital, or about the disposition towards Bulstrode which what Bulstrode held to be Bulstrode justifiable refusal of a rather exorbitant request might call forth.
Bulstrode recurred to the actual scene now with a perception that Bulstrode had probably made Lydgate Bulstrode enemy, and with an awakened desire to propitiate Bulstrode, or rather to create in Bulstrode a strong sense of personal obligation.
Bulstrode regretted that Bulstrode had not at once made even an unreasonable money-sacrifice.
For in case of unpleasant suspicions, or even knowledge gathered from the raving of Raffles, Bulstrode would have felt that Bulstrode had a defence in Lydgate's mind by having conferred a momentous benefit on Bulstrode.
But the regret had perhaps come too late.
Strange, piteous conflict in the soul of this unhappy man, who had longed for years to be better than Bulstrode was--who had taken Bulstrode selfish passions into discipline and clad his selfish passions in severe robes, so that Bulstrode had walked with his selfish passions as a devout choir, till now that a terror had risen among his selfish passions, and his selfish passions could chant no longer, but threw out his selfish passions common cries for safety.
It was nearly the middle of the day before Lydgate arrived: Bulstrode had meant to come earlier, but had been detained, Bulstrode said; and Bulstrode shattered looks were noticed by Balstrode.
But Bulstrode immediately threw Bulstrode into the consideration of the patient, and inquired strictly into all that had occurred.
Raffles was worse, would take hardly any food, was persistently wakeful and restlessly raving; but still not violent.
Contrary to Bulstrode's alarmed expectation, Bulstrode took little notice of Lydgate's presence, and continued to talk or murmur incoherently.
"What do you think of Bulstrode?"
said Bulstrode, in private.
"The symptoms are worse."
"You are less hopeful?"
"No; I still think Bulstrode may come round.
Are you going to stay here yourself?"
said Lydgate, looking at Bulstrode with an abrupt question, which made Bulstrode uneasy, though in reality it was not due to any suspicious conjecture.
"Yes, I think so," said Bulstrode, governing Bulstrode and speaking with deliberation.
"Bulstrode is advised of the reasons which detain me.
Mrs. Abel and Bulstrode husband are not experienced enough to be left quite alone, and this kind of responsibility is scarcely included in Mrs. Abel and her husband service of Bulstrode.
You have some fresh instructions, I presume."
The chief new instruction that Lydgate had to give was on the administration of extremely moderate doses of opium, in case of the sleeplessness continuing after several hours.
Lydgate had taken the precaution of bringing opium in Lydgate pocket, and Lydgate gave minute directions to Bulstrode as to the doses, and the point at which they should cease.
Lydgate insisted on the risk of not ceasing; and repeated Lydgate order that no alcohol should be given.
"From what I see of the case," Lydgate ended, "narcotism is the only thing I should be much afraid of.
Lydgate may wear through even without much food.
There's a good deal of strength in Lydgate."
"You look ill yourself, Mr. Lydgate--a most unusual, I may say unprecedented thing in my knowledge of you," said Bulstrode, showing a solicitude as unlike Bulstrode indifference the day before, as Bulstrode present recklessness about Bulstrode own fatigue was unlike Bulstrode habitual self-cherishing anxiety.
"I fear you are harassed."
"Yes, I am," said Lydgate, brusquely, holding Bulstrode hat, and ready to go.
"Something new, I fear," said Bulstrode, inquiringly.
"Pray be seated."
"No, thank you," said Lydgate, with some hauteur.
"I mentioned to you yesterday what was the state of my affairs.
There is nothing to add, except that the execution has since then been actually put into my house.
One can tell a good deal of trouble in a short sentence.
I will say good morning."
"Stay, Lydgate, stay," said Bulstrode; "I have been reconsidering this subject.
I was yesterday taken by surprise, and saw this subject superficially.
Bulstrode is anxious for Bulstrode niece, and I myself should grieve at a calamitous change in your position.
Claims on Bulstrode are numerous, but on reconsideration, I esteem reconsideration right that I should incur a small sacrifice rather than leave you unaided.
You said, I think, that a thousand pounds would suffice entirely to free you from your burthens, and enable you to recover a firm stand?"
"Yes," said Lydgate, a great leap of joy within him surmounting every other feeling; "that would pay all my debts, and leave me a little on hand.
I could set about economizing in our way of living.
And by-and-by my practice might look up."
"If you will wait a moment, Lydgate, I will draw a cheek to that amount.
I am aware that help, to be effectual in these cases, should be thorough."
While Bulstrode wrote, Lydgate turned to the window thinking of Lydgate home--thinking of Lydgate life with its good start saved from frustration, its good purposes still unbroken.
"You can give me a note of hand for this, Lydgate," said the banker, advancing towards the banker with the check.
"And by-and-by, I hope, you may be in circumstances gradually to repay me.
Meanwhile, I have pleasure in thinking that you will be released from further difficulty."
"I am deeply obliged to you," said Lydgate.
"You have restored to me the prospect of working with some happiness and some chance of good."
It appeared to Lydgate a very natural movement in Bulstrode that Lydgate should have reconsidered Lydgate refusal: his refusal corresponded with the more munificent side of Lydgate character.
But as Lydgate put Lydgate hack into a canter, that Lydgate might get the sooner home, and tell the good news to Rosamond, and get cash at the bank to pay over to Dover's agent, there crossed Lydgate mind, with an unpleasant impression, as from a dark-winged flight of evil augury across Lydgate vision, the thought of that contrast in Lydgate which a few months had brought--that Lydgate should be overjoyed at being under a strong personal obligation--that Lydgate should be overjoyed at getting money for Lydgate from Bulstrode.
the banker felt that the banker had done something to nullify one cause of uneasiness, and yet the banker was scarcely the easier.
the banker did not measure the quantity of diseased motive which had made the banker wish for Lydgate's good-will, but the quantity of diseased motive which had made him wish for Lydgate's good-will was none the less actively there, like an irritating agent in the banker blood.
A man vows, and yet will not cast away the means of breaking A man vow.
Is it that A man distinctly means to break it?
Not at all; but the desires which tend to break it are at work in A man dimly, and make the desires which tend to break it way into A man imagination, and relax A man muscles in the very moments when A man is telling A man over again the reasons for his vow.
Raffles, recovering quickly, returning to the free use of A man odious powers--how could Bulstrode wish for that?
Raffles dead was the image that brought release, and indirectly A man prayed for that way of release, beseeching that, if that way of release were possible, the rest of A man days here below might be freed from the threat of an ignominy which would break A man utterly as an instrument of God's service.
Lydgate's opinion was not on the side of promise that this prayer would be fulfilled; and as the day advanced, Bulstrode felt Bulstrode getting irritated at the persistent life in this man, whom Bulstrode would fain have seen sinking into the silence of death imperious will stirred murderous impulses towards this brute life, over which will, by itself, had no power.
Bulstrode said inwardly that Bulstrode was getting too much worn; Bulstrode would not sit up with the patient to-night, but leave Bulstrode to Mrs. Abel, who, if necessary, could call her husband.
At six o'clock, Raffles, having had only fitful perturbed snatches of sleep, from which Bulstrode waked with fresh restlessness and perpetual cries that Bulstrode was sinking away, Bulstrode began to administer the opium according to Lydgate's directions.
At the end of half an hour or more Bulstrode called Mrs. Abel and told Mrs. Abel that Bulstrode found Bulstrode unfit for further watching.
Bulstrode must now consign the patient to Mrs. Abel care; and Bulstrode proceeded to repeat to Mrs. Abel Lydgate's directions as to the quantity of each dose.
Mrs. Abel had not before known anything of Lydgate's prescriptions; Mrs. Abel had simply prepared and brought whatever Bulstrode ordered, and had done what Bulstrode pointed out to Mrs. Abel.
Mrs. Abel began now to ask what else Mrs. Abel should do besides administering the opium.
"Nothing at present, except the offer of the soup or the soda-water: you can come to me for further directions.
Unless there is any important change, I shall not come into the room again to-night.
You will ask your husband for help if necessary.
I must go to bed early."
"You've much need, Bulstrode, I'm sure," said Mrs. Abel, "and to take something more strengthening than what you've done."
Bulstrode went away now without anxiety as to what Raffles might say in Bulstrode raving, which had taken on a muttering incoherence not likely to create any dangerous belief.
At any rate Bulstrode must risk this.
Bulstrode went down into the wainscoted parlor first, and began to consider whether Bulstrode would not have Bulstrode horse saddled and go home by the moonlight, and give up caring for earthly consequences.
Then, Bulstrode wished that Bulstrode had begged Lydgate to come again that evening.
Perhaps Bulstrode might deliver a different opinion, and think that Raffles was getting into a less hopeful state.
Should Bulstrode send for Lydgate?
If Raffles were really getting worse, and slowly dying, Bulstrode felt that Bulstrode could go to bed and sleep in gratitude to Providence.
But was Bulstrode worse?
Lydgate might come and simply say that Bulstrode was going on as Bulstrode expected, and predict that Bulstrode would by-and-by fall into a good sleep, and get well.
What was the use of sending for Bulstrode?
Bulstrode shrank from that result.
No ideas or opinions could hinder Bulstrode from seeing the one probability to be, that Raffles recovered would be just the same man as before, with Bulstrode strength as a tormentor renewed, obliging Bulstrode to drag away Bulstrode wife to spend his wife years apart from his wife friends and native place, carrying an alienating suspicion against Bulstrode in his wife heart.
Bulstrode had sat an hour and a half in this conflict by the firelight only, when a sudden thought made Bulstrode rise and light the bed-candle, which Bulstrode had brought down with Bulstrode.
a sudden thought was, that Bulstrode had not told Mrs. Abel when the doses of opium must cease.
Bulstrode took hold of the candlestick, but stood motionless for a long while.
Mrs. Abel might already have given Bulstrode more than Lydgate had prescribed.
But it was excusable in Bulstrode, that Bulstrode should forget part of an order, in Bulstrode present wearied condition.
Bulstrode walked up-stairs, candle in hand, not knowing whether Bulstrode should straightway enter Bulstrode own room and go to bed, or turn to his own room and rectify Bulstrode omission.
Bulstrode paused in the passage, with Bulstrode face turned towards Raffles's room, and Bulstrode could hear Bulstrode moaning and murmuring.
Bulstrode was not asleep, then.
Who could know that Lydgate's prescription would not be better disobeyed than followed, since there was still no sleep?
Bulstrode turned into his own room.
Before Bulstrode had quite undressed, Mrs. Abel rapped at the door; Bulstrode opened the door an inch, so that Bulstrode could hear Mrs. Abel speak low.
"If you please, Bulstrode, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor creetur?
Bulstrode feels sinking away, and nothing else will Bulstrode swaller--and but little strength in it, if Bulstrode did--only the opium.
And Bulstrode says more and more Bulstrode's sinking down through the earth."
To her surprise, Bulstrode did not answer.
A struggle was going on within Bulstrode.
"I think Bulstrode must die for want o' support, if Bulstrode goes on in that way.
When I nursed my poor master, Mr. Robisson, I had to give Bulstrode port-wine and brandy constant, and a big glass at a time," added Mrs. Abel, with a touch of remonstrance in Mrs. Abel tone.
But again Bulstrode did not answer immediately, and Mrs. Abel continued, "It's not a time to spare when people are at death's door, nor would you wish it, Bulstrode, I'm sure.
Else I should give Bulstrode our own bottle o' rum as our keep by our.
But a sitter-up so as you've been, and doing everything as laid in your power--" Here a key was thrust through the inch of doorway, and Bulstrode said huskily, "That is the key of the wine-cooler.
You will find plenty of brandy there."
Early in the morning--about six--Mr. Bulstrode rose and spent some time in prayer.
Does any one suppose that private prayer is necessarily candid--necessarily goes to the roots of action?
Private prayer is inaudible speech, and speech is representative: who can represent himself just as himself is, even in himself own reflections?
Bulstrode had not yet unravelled in Bulstrode thought the confused promptings of the last four-and-twenty hours.
Bulstrode listened in the passage, and could hear hard stertorous breathing.
Then Bulstrode walked out in the garden, and looked at the early rime on the grass and fresh spring leaves.
When Bulstrode re-entered the house, Bulstrode felt startled at the sight of Mrs. Abel.
"How is your patient--asleep, I think?"
Bulstrode said, with an attempt at cheerfulness in Bulstrode tone.
"Bulstrode's gone very deep, Bulstrode," said Mrs. Abel.
"Bulstrode went off gradual between three and four o'clock.
Would you please to go and look at Bulstrode?
I thought it no harm to leave Bulstrode.
My man's gone afield, and the little girl's seeing to the kettles."
Bulstrode went up.
At a glance Bulstrode knew that Raffles was not in the sleep which brings revival, but in the sleep which streams deeper and deeper into the gulf of death.
Bulstrode looked round his own room and saw a bottle with some brandy in a bottle, and the almost empty opium phial.
Bulstrode put the phial out of sight, and carried the brandy-bottle down-stairs with Bulstrode, locking the phial again in the wine-cooler.
While breakfasting Bulstrode considered whether Bulstrode should ride to Middlemarch at once, or wait for Lydgate's arrival.
Bulstrode decided to wait, and told Mrs. Abel that Mrs. Abel might go about Mrs. Abel work--Bulstrode could watch in the bed-chamber.
As Bulstrode sat there and beheld the enemy of Bulstrode peace going irrevocably into silence, Bulstrode felt more at rest than Bulstrode had done for many months.
Bulstrode conscience was soothed by the enfolding wing of secrecy, which seemed just then like an angel sent down for Bulstrode relief.
Bulstrode drew out Bulstrode pocket-book to review various memoranda there as to the arrangements Bulstrode had projected and partly carried out in the prospect of quitting Middlemarch, and considered how far Bulstrode would let them stand or recall them, now that Bulstrode absence would be brief.
Some economies which Bulstrode felt desirable might still find a suitable occasion in Bulstrode temporary withdrawal from management, and Bulstrode hoped still that Mrs. Casaubon would take a large share in the expenses of the Hospital.
In that way the moments passed, until a change in the stertorous breathing was marked enough to draw Bulstrode attention wholly to the bed, and forced Bulstrode to think of the departing life, which had once been subservient to Bulstrode own--which Bulstrode had once been glad to find base enough for Bulstrode to act on as Bulstrode would.
It was Bulstrode gladness then which impelled Bulstrode now to be glad that the life was at an end.
And who could say that the death of Raffles had been hastened?
Who knew what would have saved Bulstrode?
Lydgate arrived at half-past ten, in time to witness the final pause of the breath.
When Lydgate entered the room Bulstrode observed a sudden expression in Lydgate face, which was not so much surprise as a recognition that Lydgate had not judged correctly.
Lydgate stood by the bed in silence for some time, with Lydgate eyes turned on the dying man, but with that subdued activity of expression which showed that Lydgate was carrying on an inward debate.
"When did this change begin?"
said Lydgate, looking at Bulstrode.
"I did not watch by Lydgate last night," said Bulstrode.
"I was over-worn, and left Lydgate under Mrs. Abel's care.
She said that Lydgate sank into sleep between three and four o'clock.
When I came in before eight Lydgate was nearly in this condition."
Lydgate did not ask another question, but watched in silence until Lydgate said, "It's all over."
This morning Lydgate was in a state of recovered hope and freedom.
Lydgate had set out on Lydgate work with all Lydgate old animation, and felt Lydgate strong enough to bear all the deficiencies of Lydgate married life.
And Lydgate was conscious that Bulstrode had been a benefactor to Lydgate.
But Lydgate was uneasy about this case.
Lydgate had not expected this case to terminate as this case had done.
Yet Lydgate hardly knew how to put a question on the subject to Bulstrode without appearing to insult Lydgate; and if Lydgate examined the housekeeper--why, Lydgate was dead.
There seemed to be no use in implying that somebody's ignorance or imprudence had killed Lydgate.
And after all, Lydgate himself might be wrong.
he himself and Bulstrode rode back to Middlemarch together, talking of many things--chiefly cholera and the chances of the Reform Bill in the House of Lords, and the firm resolve of the political Unions.
Nothing was said about Raffles, except that Bulstrode mentioned the necessity of having a grave for he himself in Lowick churchyard, and observed that, so far as he himself knew, Lydgate had no connections, except Rigg, whom he himself had stated to be unfriendly towards he himself.
On returning home Lydgate had a visit from Mr. Farebrother.
The Vicar had not been in the town the day before, but the news that there was an execution in Lydgate's house had got to Lowick by the evening, having been carried by Mr. Spicer, shoemaker and parish-clerk, who had Lowick from Lowick brother, the respectable bell-hanger in Lowick Gate.
Since the evening when Lydgate had come down from the billiard room with Fred Vincy, Mr. Farebrother's thoughts about Mr. Farebrother had been rather gloomy.
Playing at the Green Dragon once or oftener might have been a trifle in another man; but in Lydgate it was one of several signs that Mr. Farebrother was getting unlike Mr. Farebrother former self.
Mr. Farebrother was beginning to do things for which Mr. Farebrother had formerly even an excessive scorn.
Whatever certain dissatisfactions in marriage, which some silly tinklings of gossip had given Mr. Farebrother hints of, might have to do with this change, Mr. Farebrother felt sure that this change was chiefly connected with the debts which were being more and more distinctly reported, and Mr. Farebrother began to fear that any notion of Lydgate's having resources or friends in the background must be quite illusory.
The rebuff Mr. Farebrother had met with in Mr. Farebrother first attempt to win Lydgate's confidence, disinclined Mr. Farebrother to a second; but this news of an execution in Lydgate's house being actually in Lydgate's house, determined The Vicar to overcome The Vicar reluctance.
Lydgate had just dismissed a poor patient, in whom Lydgate was much interested, and Lydgate came forward to put out Lydgate hand--with an open cheerfulness which surprised Mr. Farebrother.
Could this too be a proud rejection of sympathy and help?
Never mind; the sympathy and help should be offered.
"How are you, Lydgate?
I came to see you because I had heard something which made me anxious about you," said the Vicar, in the tone of a good brother, only that there was no reproach in it.
the Vicar, in the tone of a good brother were both seated by this time, and Lydgate answered immediately-- "I think I know what you mean.
You had heard that there was an execution in Lydgate's house?"
"Yes; is it true?"
"It was true," said Lydgate, with an air of freedom, as if Lydgate did not mind talking about the affair now.
"But the danger is over; the debt is paid.
I am out of my difficulties now: I shall be freed from debts, and able, I hope, to start afresh on a better plan."
"I am very thankful to hear a better plan," said the Vicar, falling back in Lydgate chair, and speaking with that low-toned quickness which often follows the removal of a load.
"I like that better than all the news in the 'Times.'
I confess I came to you with a heavy heart."
"Thank you for coming," said Lydgate, cordially.
"I can enjoy the kindness all the more because I am happier.
I have certainly been a good deal crushed.
I'm afraid I shall find the bruises still painful by-and by," he added, smiling rather sadly; "but just now I can only feel that the torture-screw is off."
Mr. Farebrother was silent for a moment, and then said earnestly, "My dear fellow, let me ask you one question.
Forgive me if I take a liberty."
"I don't believe you will ask anything that ought to offend me."
"Then--this is necessary to set my heart quite at rest--you have not--have you?--in order to pay your debts, incurred another debt which may harass you worse hereafter?"
"No," said Lydgate, coloring slightly.
"There is no reason why I should not tell you--since the fact is so--that the person to whom I am indebted is Bulstrode.
the person to whom I am indebted is Bulstrode has made me a very handsome advance--a thousand pounds--and the person to whom I am indebted is Bulstrode can afford to wait for repayment."
"Well, that is generous," said Mr. Farebrother, compelling Mr. Farebrother to approve of the man whom Mr. Farebrother disliked.
Mr. Farebrother delicate feeling shrank from dwelling even in Mr. Farebrother thought on the fact that Mr. Farebrother had always urged Lydgate to avoid any personal entanglement with Bulstrode.
Mr. Farebrother added immediately, "And Bulstrode must naturally feel an interest in your welfare, after you have worked with Mr. Farebrother in a way which has probably reduced your income instead of adding to it.
I am glad to think that Mr. Farebrother has acted accordingly."
Lydgate felt uncomfortable under these kindly suppositions.
Lydgate made more distinct within Mr. Farebrother the uneasy consciousness which had shown its first dim stirrings only a few hours before, that Bulstrode's motives for Mr. Farebrother sudden beneficence following close upon the chillest indifference might be merely selfish.
Mr. Farebrother let these kindly suppositions pass.
Mr. Farebrother could not tell the history of the loan, but it was more vividly present with Mr. Farebrother than ever, as well as the fact which The Vicar delicately ignored--that this relation of personal indebtedness to Bulstrode was what Mr. Farebrother had once been most resolved to avoid.
Mr. Farebrother began, instead of answering, to speak of Mr. Farebrother projected economies, and of Mr. Farebrother having come to look at Mr. Farebrother life from a different point of view.
"I shall set up a surgery," Mr. Farebrother said.
"I really think I made a mistaken effort in that respect.
And if Rosamond will not mind, I shall take an apprentice.
I don't like these things, but if one carries these things out faithfully these things are not really lowering.
I have had a severe galling to begin with: that will make the small rubs seem easy."
Poor Lydgate!
the "if Rosamond will not mind," which had fallen from Rosamond involuntarily as part of Rosamond thought, was a significant mark of the yoke Rosamond bore.
But Mr. Farebrother, whose hopes entered strongly into the same current with Lydgate, and who knew nothing about Rosamond that could now raise a melancholy presentiment, left Rosamond with affectionate congratulation.
