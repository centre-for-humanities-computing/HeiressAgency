"One of us two must bowen douteless, And, sith a man is more reasonable Than woman is, ye [men] moste be suffrable.
--CHAUCER: Canterbury Tales.
The bias of human nature to be slow in correspondence triumphs even over the present quickening in the general pace of things: what wonder then that in 1832 old Sir Godwin Lydgate was slow to write a letter which was of consequence to others rather than to old Sir Godwin Lydgate?
Nearly three weeks of the new year were gone, and Rosamond, awaiting an answer to Rosamond winning appeal, was every day disappointed.
old Sir Godwin Lydgate, in total ignorance of old Sir Godwin Lydgate expectations, was seeing the bills come in, and feeling that Dover's use of old Sir Godwin Lydgate advantage over other creditors was imminent.
old Sir Godwin Lydgate had never mentioned to Rosamond old Sir Godwin Lydgate brooding purpose of going to Quallingham: old Sir Godwin Lydgate did not want to admit what would appear to Rosamond a concession to Rosamond wishes after indignant refusal, until the last moment; but old Sir Godwin Lydgate was really expecting to set off soon.
A slice of the railway would enable old Sir Godwin Lydgate to manage the whole journey and back in four days.
But one morning after old Sir Godwin Lydgate had gone out, a letter came addressed to old Sir Godwin Lydgate, which Rosamond saw clearly to be from Sir Godwin.
Rosamond was full of hope.
Perhaps there might be a particular note to Rosamond enclosed; but old Sir Godwin Lydgate was naturally addressed on the question of money or other aid, and the fact that old Sir Godwin Lydgate was written to, nay, the very delay in writing at all, seemed to certify that the answer was thoroughly compliant.
Rosamond was too much excited by these thoughts to do anything but light stitching in a warm corner of the dining-room, with the outside of this momentous letter lying on the table before Rosamond.
About twelve Rosamond heard Rosamond husband's step in the passage, and tripping to open the door, Rosamond said in Rosamond lightest tones, "Tertius, come in here--here is a letter for you."
"Ah?"
her husband said, not taking off her husband hat, but just turning Rosamond round within her husband arm to walk towards the spot where this momentous letter lying on the table before her lay.
"My uncle Godwin!"
My uncle Godwin!"
exclaimed, while Rosamond reseated Rosamond, and watched My uncle Godwin!"

to be surprised.

Rosamond too had changed color as Rosamond read.
a letter for you ran in this way:-- "DEAR TERTIUS,--Don't set your wife to write to My uncle Godwin!"
when you have anything to ask.
It is a roundabout wheedling sort of thing which I should not have credited you with.
I never choose to write to a woman on matters of business.
As to my supplying you with a thousand pounds, or only half that sum, I can do nothing of the sort.
My own family drains me to the last penny.
With two younger sons and three daughters, I am not likely to have cash to spare.
You seem to have got through your own money pretty quickly, and to have made a mess where you are; the sooner you go somewhere else the better.
But I have nothing to do with men of your profession, and can't help you there.
I did the best I could for you as guardian, and let you have your own way in taking to medicine.
You might have gone into the army or the Church.
Your money would have held out for that, and there would have been a surer ladder before you.
Your uncle Charles has had a grudge against you for not going into Your uncle Charles profession, but not I. I have always wished you well, but you must consider you on your own legs entirely now.
Your affectionate uncle, GODWIN LYDGATE."
When Rosamond had finished reading the letter Rosamond sat quite still, with Rosamond hands folded before Rosamond, restraining any show of Rosamond keen disappointment, and intrenching Rosamond in quiet passivity under Rosamond husband's wrath.
Lydgate paused in Lydgate movements, looked at Rosamond again, and said, with biting severity-- "Will this be enough to convince you of the harm you may do by secret meddling?
Have you sense enough to recognize now your incompetence to judge and act for Lydgate--to interfere with your ignorance in affairs which it belongs to Lydgate to decide on?"
The words were hard; but this was not the first time that Lydgate had been frustrated by Lydgate.
Lydgate did not look at Lydgate, and made no reply.
"I had nearly resolved on going to Quallingham.
It would have cost me pain enough to do It, yet It might have been of some use.
But It has been of no use for me to think of anything.
You have always been counteracting me secretly.
You delude me with a false assent, and then I am at the mercy of your devices.
If you mean to resist every wish I express, say so and defy me.
I shall at least know what I am doing then."
It is a terrible moment in young lives when the closeness of love's bond has turned to this power of galling.
In spite of Rosamond's self-control a tear fell silently and rolled over Rosamond lips.
Rosamond still said nothing; but under that quietude was hidden an intense effect: Rosamond was in such entire disgust with Rosamond husband that Rosamond wished Rosamond had never seen her husband.
Sir Godwin's rudeness towards Rosamond and utter want of feeling ranged her husband with Dover and all other creditors--disagreeable people who only thought of Dover and all other creditors--disagreeable people who only thought of themselves, and did not mind how annoying they were to her, and did not mind how annoying Dover and all other creditors--disagreeable people who only thought of themselves, and did not mind how annoying they were to her were to Rosamond.
Even Rosamond father was unkind, and might have done more for Dover and all other creditors--disagreeable people who only thought of themselves, and did not mind how annoying they were to her.
In fact there was but one person in Rosamond's world whom Rosamond did not regard as blameworthy, and that was the graceful creature with blond plaits and with little hands crossed before Rosamond, who had never expressed Rosamond unbecomingly, and had always acted for the best--the best naturally being what Rosamond best liked.
Lydgate pausing and looking at Rosamond began to feel that half-maddening sense of helplessness which comes over passionate people when Lydgate pausing and looking at her passion is met by an innocent-looking silence whose meek victimized air seems to put Lydgate pausing and looking at her in the wrong, and at last infects even the justest indignation with a doubt of its justice.
Even her father needed to recover the full sense that Even her father was in the right by moderating Even her father words.
"Can you not see, Rosamond," Even her father began again, trying to be simply grave and not bitter, "that nothing can be so fatal as a want of openness and confidence between us?
It has happened again and again that I have expressed a decided wish, and you have seemed to assent, yet after that you have secretly disobeyed my wish.
In that way I can never know what I have to trust to.
There would be some hope for us if you would admit this.
Am I such an unreasonable, furious brute?
Why should you not be open with me?"
Still silence.
"Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may depend on your not acting secretly in future?"
said Lydgate, urgently, but with something of request in Even her father tone which Rosamond was quick to perceive.
Rosamond spoke with coolness.
"I cannot possibly make admissions or promises in answer to such words as you have used towards me.
I have not been accustomed to language of that kind.
You have spoken of my 'secret meddling,' and my 'interfering ignorance,' and my 'false assent.'
I have never expressed me in that way to you, and I think that you ought to apologize.
You spoke of its being impossible to live with me.
Certainly you have not made my life pleasant to me of late.
I think it was to be expected that I should try to avert some of the hardships which our marriage has brought on me."
Another tear fell as Rosamond ceased speaking, and Rosamond pressed Rosamond ceased speaking away as quietly as the first.
Lydgate flung Lydgate into a chair, feeling checkmated.
What place was there in Rosamond mind for a remonstrance to lodge in?
Lydgate laid down Lydgate hat, flung an arm over the back of a chair, and looked down for some moments without speaking.
Rosamond had the double purchase over Lydgate of insensibility to the point of justice in Lydgate reproach, and of sensibility to the undeniable hardships now present in Rosamond married life.
Although Rosamond duplicity in the affair of the house had exceeded what Lydgate knew, and had really hindered the Plymdales from knowing of it, Rosamond had no consciousness that Rosamond action could rightly be called false.
We are not obliged to identify We own acts according to a strict classification, any more than the materials of We grocery and clothes.
Rosamond felt that Rosamond was aggrieved, and that this was what Lydgate had to recognize.
As for Lydgate, the need of accommodating Lydgate to Rosamond nature, which was inflexible in proportion to its negations, held Lydgate as with pincers.
Lydgate had begun to have an alarmed foresight of Rosamond irrevocable loss of love for Lydgate, and the consequent dreariness of their life.
The ready fulness of Lydgate emotions made this dread alternate quickly with the first violent movements of Lydgate anger.
It would assuredly have been a vain boast in Lydgate to say that Lydgate was Rosamond master.
"You have not made my life pleasant to me of late"--"the hardships which our marriage has brought on me"--these words were stinging Lydgate imagination as a pain makes an exaggerated dream.
If Lydgate were not only to sink from Lydgate highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous fettering of domestic hate?
"Rosamond," Lydgate said, turning Lydgate eyes on Rosamond with a melancholy look, "you should allow for a man's words when Lydgate is disappointed and provoked.
You and I cannot have opposite interests.
I cannot part my happiness from Rosamond.
If I am angry with Rosamond, it is that you seem not to see how any concealment divides us.
How could I wish to make anything hard to Rosamond either by my words or conduct?
When I hurt you, I hurt part of my own life.
I should never be angry with Rosamond if you would be quite open with me."
"I have only wished to prevent you from hurrying us into wretchedness without any necessity," said Rosamond, the tears coming again from a softened feeling now that Rosamond had softened.
"It is so very hard to be disgraced here among all the people we know, and to live in such a miserable way.
I wish I had died with the baby."
Rosamond spoke and wept with that gentleness which makes such words and tears omnipotent over a loving-hearted man.
Lydgate drew a chair near to Rosamond and pressed Rosamond delicate head against Lydgate cheek with Lydgate powerful tender hand.
Lydgate only caressed Rosamond; Lydgate did not say anything; for what was there to say?
Lydgate could not promise to shield Rosamond from the dreaded wretchedness, for Lydgate could see no sure means of doing so.
When Lydgate left Rosamond to go out again, Lydgate told Lydgate that it was ten times harder for Rosamond than for Lydgate: Lydgate had a life away from home, and constant appeals to Lydgate activity on behalf of others.
Lydgate wished to excuse everything in Rosamond if Lydgate could--but it was inevitable that in that excusing mood Lydgate should think of Rosamond as if Rosamond were an animal of another and feebler species.
Nevertheless Rosamond had mastered Lydgate.
