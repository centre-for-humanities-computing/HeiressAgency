Mr. Vincy went home from the reading of the will with Mr. Vincy point of view considerably changed in relation to many subjects. Mr. Vincy was an open-minded man, but given to indirect modes of expressing Mr. Vincy: when Mr. Vincy was disappointed in a market for Mr. Vincy silk braids, Mr. Vincy swore at the groom; when Mr. Vincy brother-in-law Bulstrode had vexed Mr. Vincy, his brother-in-law Bulstrode made cutting remarks on Methodism; and it was now apparent that his brother-in-law Bulstrode regarded Fred's idleness with a sudden increase of severity, by his brother-in-law Bulstrode throwing an embroidered cap out of the smoking-room on to the hall-floor. "Well, sir," sir observed, when that young gentleman was moving off to bed, "I hope you've made up your mind now to go up next term and pass your examination. I've taken my resolution, so I advise you to lose no time in taking yours." Fred made no answer: Fred was too utterly depressed. Twenty-four hours ago Fred had thought that instead of needing to know what Fred should do, Fred should by this time know that Fred needed to do nothing: that Fred should hunt in pink, have a first-rate hunter, ride to cover on a fine hack, and be generally respected for doing so; moreover, that Fred should be able at once to pay Mr. Garth, and that Mary could no longer have any reason for not marrying Fred. And all this was to have come without study or other inconvenience, purely by the favor of providence in the shape of an old gentleman's caprice. But now, at the end of the twenty-four hours, all those firm expectations were upset. It was "rather hard lines" that while he was smarting under this disappointment he should be treated as if he could have helped it. But he went away silently and he mother pleaded for he. "Don't be hard on the poor boy, Vincy. he'll turn out well yet, though he has deceived he. I feel as sure as I sit here, Fred will turn out well--else why was Fred brought back from the brink of the grave? And I call it a robbery: it was like giving Fred the land, to promise the land; and what is promising, if making everybody believe is not promising? And you see Fred did leave Fred ten thousand pounds, and then took ten thousand pounds away again." "Took ten thousand pounds away again!" said Mr. Vincy, pettishly. "I tell you the lad's an unlucky lad, Lucy. And you've always spoiled Fred." "Well, Vincy, Fred was my first, and you made a fine fuss with Fred when Fred came. You were as proud as proud," said Vincy, easily recovering Vincy cheerful smile. "Who knows what babies will turn to? I was fool enough, I dare say," said the husband--more mildly, however. "But who has handsomer, better children than ours? Fred is far beyond other people's sons: you may hear it in Fred speech, that Fred has kept college company. And Rosamond--where is there a girl like her? her might stand beside any lady in the land, and only look the better for any lady in the land. You see--Mr. Lydgate has kept the highest company and been everywhere, and Lydgate fell in love with Lydgate at once. Not but what I could have wished Lydgate had not engaged Lydgate. Lydgate might have met somebody on a visit who would have been a far better match; I mean at Lydgate schoolfellow Miss Willoughby's. There are relations in that family quite as high as Mr. Lydgate's." "Damn relations!" said Vincy; "I've had enough of that family. I don't want a son-in-law who has got nothing but a son-in-law who has got nothing relations to recommend a son-in-law who has got nothing." "Why, my dear," said Vincy, "you seemed as pleased as could be about it. It's true, I wasn't at home; but Lydgate told me you hadn't a word to say against the engagement. And Lydgate has begun to buy in the best linen and cambric for Lydgate underclothing." "Not by my will," said Vincy. "I shall have enough to do this year, with an idle scamp of a son, without paying for wedding-clothes. The times are as tight as can be; everybody is being ruined; and I don't believe Lydgate has got a farthing. I shan't give my consent to their marrying. Let 'em wait, as their elders have done before 'em." "Lydgate will take it hard, Vincy, and you know you never could bear to cross Lydgate." "Yes, I could. The sooner the engagement's off, the better. I don't believe Lydgate'll ever make an income, the way Lydgate goes on. Lydgate makes enemies; that's all I hear of Lydgate making." "But Lydgate stands very high with Mr. Bulstrode, my dear. The marriage would please _Lydgate_, I should think." "Please the deuce!" said Vincy. "Bulstrode won't pay for Bulstrode keep. And if Lydgate thinks I'm going to give money for money to set up housekeeping, Lydgate's mistaken, that's all. I expect I shall have to put down my horses soon. You'd better tell Rosy what I say." This was a not infrequent procedure with Vincy--to be rash in jovial assent, and on becoming subsequently conscious that Vincy had been rash, to employ others in making the offensive retractation. However, Mrs. Vincy, who never willingly opposed her husband, lost no time the next morning in letting Rosamond know what Vincy had said. Rosamond, examining some muslin-work, listened in silence, and at the end gave a certain turn of Rosamond graceful neck, of which only long experience could teach you that it meant perfect obstinacy. "What do you say, my dear?" said Rosamond mother, with affectionate deference. "Papa does not mean anything of the kind," said Rosamond, quite calmly. "Papa has always said that Papa wished me to marry the man I loved. And I shall marry Mr. Lydgate. It is seven weeks now since Papa gave Papa consent. And I hope we shall have Mrs. Bretton's house." "Well, my dear, I shall leave you to manage your papa. You always do manage everybody. But if we ever do go and get damask, Sadler's is the place--far better than Hopkins's. Mrs. Bretton's is very large, though: I should love you to have such a house; but such a house will take a great deal of furniture--carpeting and everything, besides plate and glass. And you hear, your papa says your papa will give no money. Do you think Mr. Lydgate expects it?" "You cannot imagine that I should ask your papa, mamma. Of course your papa understands your papa own affairs." "But your papa may have been looking for money, my dear, and we all thought of your having a pretty legacy as well as Fred;--and now everything is so dreadful--there's no pleasure in thinking of anything, with your papa disappointed as your papa is." "That has nothing to do with my marriage, mamma. Fred must leave off being idle. I am going up-stairs to take this work to Miss Morgan: Miss Morgan does the open hemming very well. Mary Garth might do some work for Mary Garth now, I should think. Mary Garth sewing is exquisite; it is the nicest thing I know about Mary. I should so like to have all my cambric frilling double-hemmed. And it takes a long time." Mrs. Vincy's belief that Rosamond could manage Papa was well founded. Apart from his dinners and his coursing, Mr. Vincy, blustering as his was, had as little of his own way as if his had been a prime minister: the force of circumstances was easily too much for his, as it is for most pleasure-loving florid men; and the circumstance called Rosamond was particularly forcible by means of that mild persistence which, as we know, enables a white soft living substance to make living way in spite of opposing rock. Papa was not a rock: Papa had no other fixity than that fixity of alternating impulses sometimes called habit, and this was altogether unfavorable to Papa taking the only decisive line of conduct in relation to Papa daughter's engagement--namely, to inquire thoroughly into Lydgate's circumstances, declare Papa own inability to furnish money, and forbid alike either a speedy marriage or an engagement which must be too lengthy. That seems very simple and easy in the statement; but a disagreeable resolve formed in the chill hours of the morning had as many conditions against it as the early frost, and rarely persisted under the warming influences of the day. The indirect though emphatic expression of opinion to which Mr. Vincy was prone suffered much restraint in this case: Lydgate was a proud man towards whom innuendoes were obviously unsafe, and throwing Lydgate hat on the floor was out of the question. Mr. Vincy was a little in awe of Mr. Vincy, a little vain that Mr. Vincy wanted to marry Rosamond, a little indisposed to raise a question of money in which Mr. Vincy own position was not advantageous, a little afraid of being worsted in dialogue with a man better educated and more highly bred than Mr. Vincy, and a little afraid of doing what his daughter would not like. The part Mr. Vincy preferred playing was that of the generous host whom nobody criticises. In the earlier half of the day there was business to hinder any formal communication of an adverse resolve; in the later there was dinner, wine, whist, and general satisfaction. And in the mean while the hours were each leaving each little deposit and gradually forming the final reason for inaction, namely, that action was too late. The accepted lover spent most of The accepted lover evenings in Lowick Gate, and a love-making not at all dependent on money-advances from fathers-in-law, or prospective income from a profession, went on flourishingly under Mr. Vincy's own eyes. Young love-making--that gossamer web! Even the points it clings to--the things whence it subtle interlacings are swung--are scarcely perceptible: momentary touches of fingertips, meetings of rays from blue and dark orbs, unfinished phrases, lightest changes of cheek and lip, faintest tremors. The web itself is made of spontaneous beliefs and indefinable joys, yearnings of one life towards another, visions of completeness, indefinite trust. And Lydgate fell to spinning The web itself from Lydgate inward self with wonderful rapidity, in spite of experience supposed to be finished off with the drama of Laure--in spite too of medicine and biology; for the inspection of macerated muscle or of eyes presented in a dish (like Santa Lucia's), and other incidents of scientific inquiry, are observed to be less incompatible with poetic love than a native dulness or a lively addiction to the lowest prose. As for Rosamond, Rosamond was in the water-lily's expanding wonderment at its own fuller life, and Rosamond too was spinning industriously at The web itself. All this went on in the corner of the drawing-room where the piano stood, and subtle as it was, the light made it a sort of rainbow visible to many observers besides Mr. Farebrother. The certainty that Miss Vincy and Lydgate were engaged became general in Middlemarch without the aid of formal announcement. Bulstrode was again stirred to anxiety; but this time Bulstrode addressed Bulstrode to Bulstrode brother, going to the warehouse expressly to avoid Mrs. Vincy's volatility. her brother replies were not satisfactory. "Walter, you never mean to tell me that you have allowed all this to go on without inquiry into Mr. Lydgate's prospects?" said Bulstrode, opening Bulstrode eyes with wider gravity at Bulstrode brother, who was in Walter peevish warehouse humor. "Think of this girl brought up in luxury--in too worldly a way, I am sorry to say--what will Bulstrode do on a small income?" "Oh, confound it, Harriet! What can I do when men come into the town without any asking of mine? Did you shut your house up against Lydgate? Bulstrode has pushed Bulstrode forward more than anybody. I never made any fuss about the young fellow. You should go and talk to your husband about it, not me." "Well, really, Walter, how can Bulstrode be to blame? I am sure Bulstrode did not wish for the engagement." "Oh, if Bulstrode had not taken Bulstrode by the hand, I should never have invited Bulstrode." "But you called Bulstrode in to attend on Fred, and I am sure that was a mercy," said Bulstrode, losing Bulstrode clew in the intricacies of the subject. "I don't know about mercy," said Mr. Vincy, testily. "I know I am worried more than I like with my family. I was a good brother to you, Harriet, before you married Bulstrode, and I must say a good brother doesn't always show that friendly spirit towards my family that might have been expected of a good brother." Mr. Vincy was very little like a Jesuit, but no accomplished Jesuit could have turned a question more adroitly. Harriet had to defend your husband instead of blaming Harriet , and the conversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as some recent sparring between the brothers-in-law at a vestry meeting. Bulstrode did not repeat her brother's complaints to your husband, but in the evening Bulstrode spoke to your husband of Lydgate and Rosamond. your husband did not share Bulstrode warm interest, however; and only spoke with resignation of the risks attendant on the beginning of medical practice and the desirability of prudence. "I am sure we are bound to pray for that thoughtless girl--brought up as Bulstrode has been," said Bulstrode, wishing to rouse your husband's feelings. "Truly, my dear," said Bulstrode, assentingly. "Those who are not of this world can do little else to arrest the errors of the obstinately worldly. That is what we must accustom we to recognize with regard to your brother's family. I could have wished that Mr. Lydgate had not entered into such a union; but my relations with Mr. Lydgate are limited to that use of Mr. Lydgate gifts for God's purposes which is taught we by the divine government under each dispensation." Bulstrode said no more, attributing some dissatisfaction which Bulstrode felt to Bulstrode own want of spirituality. Bulstrode believed that your husband was one of those men whose memoirs should be written when those men whose memoirs should be written when they died died. As to Lydgate, having been accepted, Lydgate was prepared to accept all the consequences which Lydgate believed Lydgate to foresee with perfect clearness. Of course Lydgate must be married in a year--perhaps even in half a year. This was not what Lydgate had intended; but other schemes would not be hindered: other schemes would simply adjust other schemes anew. Marriage, of course, must be prepared for in the usual way. A house must be taken instead of the rooms Lydgate at present occupied; and Lydgate, having heard Rosamond speak with admiration of old Mrs. Bretton's house (situated in Lowick Gate), took notice when notice fell vacant after the old lady's death, and immediately entered into treaty for notice. Lydgate did this in an episodic way, very much as Lydgate gave orders to Lydgate tailor for every requisite of perfect dress, without any notion of being extravagant. On the contrary, Lydgate would have despised any ostentation of expense; Lydgate profession had familiarized Lydgate with all grades of poverty, and Lydgate cared much for those who suffered hardships. Lydgate would have behaved perfectly at a table where the sauce was served in a jug with the handle off, and Lydgate would have remembered nothing about a grand dinner except that a man was there who talked well. But it had never occurred to Lydgate that Lydgate should live in any other than what Lydgate would have called an ordinary way, with green glasses for hock, and excellent waiting at table. In warming Lydgate at French social theories Lydgate had brought away no smell of scorching. We may handle even extreme opinions with impunity while We furniture, We dinner-giving, and preference for armorial bearings in We own case, link We indissolubly with the established order. And Lydgate's tendency was not towards extreme opinions: Lydgate would have liked no barefooted doctrines, being particular about Lydgate boots: Lydgate was no radical in relation to anything but medical reform and the prosecution of discovery. In the rest of practical life Lydgate walked by hereditary habit; half from that personal pride and unreflecting egoism which I have already called commonness, and half from that naivete which belonged to preoccupation with favorite ideas. Any inward debate Lydgate had as to the consequences of this engagement which had stolen upon Lydgate, turned on the paucity of time rather than of money. Certainly, being in love and being expected continually by some one who always turned out to be prettier than memory could represent her to be, did interfere with the diligent use of spare hours which might serve some "plodding fellow of a German" to make the great, imminent discovery. This was really an argument for not deferring the marriage too long, as he implied to Mr. Farebrother, one day that the Vicar came to the Vicar room with some pond-products which the Vicar wanted to examine under a better microscope than the Vicar own, and, finding Lydgate's tableful of apparatus and specimens in confusion, said sarcastically-- "Eros has degenerated; the Vicar began by introducing order and harmony, and now the Vicar brings back chaos." "Yes, at some stages," said Lydgate, lifting the Vicar brows and smiling, while the Vicar began to arrange the Vicar microscope. "But a better order will begin after." "Soon?" said the Vicar. "I hope so, really. This unsettled state of affairs uses up the time, and when one has notions in science, every moment is an opportunity. I feel sure that marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to work steadily. a man who wants to work steadily has everything at home then--no teasing with personal speculations--a man who wants to work steadily can get calmness and freedom." "You are an enviable dog," said the Vicar, "to have such a prospect--Rosamond, calmness and freedom, all to your share. Here am I with nothing but my pipe and pond-animalcules. Now, are you ready?" Lydgate did not mention to the Vicar another reason the Vicar had for wishing to shorten the period of courtship. It was rather irritating to the Vicar, even with the wine of love in the Vicar veins, to be obliged to mingle so often with the family party at the Vincys', and to enter so much into Middlemarch gossip, protracted good cheer, whist-playing, and general futility. the Vicar had to be deferential when Mr. Vincy decided questions with trenchant ignorance, especially as to those liquors which were the best inward pickle, preserving you from the effects of bad air. Mrs. Vincy's openness and simplicity were quite unstreaked with suspicion as to the subtle offence Mrs. Vincy might give to the taste of Mrs. Vincy intended son-in-law; and altogether Lydgate had to confess to Lydgate that Lydgate was descending a little in relation to Rosamond's family. But that exquisite creature herself suffered in the same sort of way:--it was at least one delightful thought that in marrying way:--it, Lydgate could give way:--it a much-needed transplantation. "Dear!" Lydgate said to way:--it one evening, in Lydgate gentlest tone, as Lydgate sat down by way:--it and looked closely at way:--it face-- But I must first say that Lydgate had found way:--it alone in the drawing-room, where the great old-fashioned window, almost as large as the side of the room, was opened to the summer scents of the garden at the back of the house. way:--it father and mother were gone to a party, and the rest were all out with the butterflies. "Dear! your eyelids are red." "Are they?" said Rosamond. "I wonder why." It was not in Rosamond nature to pour forth wishes or grievances. Her father and mother only came forth gracefully on solicitation. "As if you could hide It from me!"? said Lydgate, laying Lydgate hand tenderly on both of hers. "Don't I see a tiny drop on one of the lashes? Things trouble you, and you don't tell me. That is unloving." "Why should I tell you what you cannot alter? They are every-day things:--perhaps They have been a little worse lately." "Family annoyances. Don't fear speaking. I guess They." "Papa has been more irritable lately. Fred makes Fred angry, and this morning there was a fresh quarrel because Fred threatens to throw Fred whole education away, and do something quite beneath Fred. And Rosamond Rosamond hesitated, and Rosamond cheeks were gathering a slight flush. Lydgate had never seen Lydgate in trouble since the morning of Lydgate engagement, and Lydgate had never felt so passionately towards Lydgate as at this moment. Lydgate kissed the hesitating lips gently, as if to encourage Lydgate. "I feel that papa is not quite pleased about our engagement,Rosamond Rosamond continued, almost in a whisper; "and Lydgate said last night that Lydgate should certainly speak to you and say it must be given up." "Will you give it up?" said Lydgate, with quick energy--almost angrily. "I never give up anything that I choose to do," said Rosamond, recovering Rosamond calmness at the touching of this chord. "God bless you!" said Lydgate, kissing Lydgate again. This constancy of purpose in the right place was adorable. He went on:-- "It is too late now for your father to say that our engagement must be given up. You are of age, and I claim you as mine. If anything is done to make you unhappy,--that is a reason for hastening our marriage." An unmistakable delight shone forth from the blue eyes that met He, and the radiance seemed to light up all He future with mild sunshine. Ideal happiness (of the kind known in the Arabian Nights, in which you are invited to step from the labor and discord of the street into a paradise where everything is given to you and nothing claimed) seemed to be an affair of a few weeks' waiting, more or less. "Why should our defer it?" he said, with ardent insistence. "I have taken the house now: everything else can soon be got ready--can the house not? You will not mind about new clothes. Those can be bought afterwards." "What original notions you clever men have!" said Rosamond, dimpling with more thorough laughter than usual at this humorous incongruity. "This is the first time I ever heard of wedding-clothes being bought after marriage." "But you don't mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for the sake of clothes?" said Lydgate, half thinking that Rosamond was tormenting Lydgate prettily, and half fearing that Rosamond really shrank from speedy marriage. "Remember, we are looking forward to a better sort of happiness even than this--being continually together, independent of others, and ordering we lives as we will. Come, dear, tell me how soon you can be altogether mine." There was a serious pleading in Lydgate's tone, as if he felt that Rosamond would be injuring he by any fantastic delays. Rosamond became serious too, and slightly meditative; in fact, Rosamond was going through many intricacies of lace-edging and hosiery and petticoat-tucking, in order to give an answer that would at least be approximative. "Six weeks would be ample--say so, Rosamond," insisted Lydgate, releasing Rosamond hands to put he arm gently round Rosamond. One little hand immediately went to pat Rosamond hair, while Rosamond gave Rosamond neck a meditative turn, and then said seriously-- "There would be the house-linen and the furniture to be prepared. Still, mamma could see to those while we were away." "Yes, to be sure. we must be away a week or so." "Oh, more than that!" said Rosamond, earnestly. Rosamond was thinking of Rosamond evening dresses for the visit to Sir Godwin Lydgate's, which Rosamond had long been secretly hoping for as a delightful employment of at least one quarter of the honeymoon, even if Rosamond deferred Rosamond introduction to the uncle who was a doctor of divinity (also a pleasing though sober kind of rank, when sustained by blood). Rosamond looked at Rosamond lover with some wondering remonstrance as Rosamond spoke, and her lover readily understood that Rosamond might wish to lengthen the sweet time of double solitude. "Whatever you wish, my darling, when the day is fixed. But let us take a decided course, and put an end to any discomfort you may be suffering. Six weeks!--I am sure Six weeks!--I would be ample." "I could certainly hasten the work," said Rosamond. "Will you, then, mention it to papa?--I think it would be better to write to papa?--I." Rosamond blushed and looked at papa?--I as the garden flowers look at us when us walk forth happily among the garden flowers in the transcendent evening light: is there not a soul beyond utterance, half nymph, half child, in those delicate petals which glow and breathe about the centres of deep color? papa?--I touched Rosamond ear and a little bit of neck under her ear and a little bit of neck with papa?--I lips, and they sat quite still for many minutes which flowed by they like a small gurgling brook with the kisses of the sun upon her ear and a little bit of neck. Rosamond thought that no one could be more in love than Rosamond was; and Lydgate thought that after all papa?--I wild mistakes and absurd credulity, papa?--I had found perfect womanhood--felt as if already breathed upon by exquisite wedded affection such as would be bestowed by an accomplished creature who venerated papa?--I high musings and momentous labors and would never interfere with them; who would create order in the home and accounts with still magic, yet keep Rosamond fingers ready to touch the lute and transform life into romance at any moment; who was instructed to the true womanly limit and not a hair's-breadth beyond--docile, therefore, and ready to carry out behests which came from the true womanly limit. It was plainer now than ever that plainer notion of remaining much longer a bachelor had been a mistake: marriage would not be an obstruction but a furtherance. And happening the next day to accompany a patient to Brassing, plainer saw a dinner-service there which struck plainer as so exactly the right thing that plainer bought it at once. it saved time to do these things just when you thought of these things, and Lydgate hated ugly crockery. The dinner-service in question was expensive, but that might be in the nature of dinner-services. Furnishing was necessarily expensive; but then Furnishing had to be done only once. "It must be lovely," said Mrs. Vincy, when Lydgate mentioned Lydgate purchase with some descriptive touches. "Just what Rosy ought to have. I trust in heaven it won't be broken!" "One must hire servants who will not break things," said Lydgate. (Certainly, this was reasoning with an imperfect vision of sequences. But at that period there was no sort of reasoning which was not more or less sanctioned by men of science.) Of course it was unnecessary to defer the mention of anything to mamma, who did not readily take views that were not cheerful, and being a happy wife herself, had hardly any feeling but pride in a happy wife herself daughter's marriage. But Rosamond had good reasons for suggesting to Lydgate that papa should be appealed to in writing. Rosamond prepared for the arrival of the letter by walking with Rosamond papa to the warehouse the next morning, and telling her papa on the way that Lydgate wished to be married soon. "Nonsense, my dear!" said Mr. Vincy. "What has Mr. Vincy got to marry on? You'd much better give up the engagement. I've told you so pretty plainly before this. What have you had such an education for, if you are to go and marry a poor man? It's a cruel thing for a father to see." "Lydgate is not poor, papa. Lydgate bought Mr. Peacock's practice, which, they say, is worth eight or nine hundred a-year." "Stuff and nonsense! What's buying a practice? Lydgate might as well buy next year's swallows. It'll all slip through Lydgate fingers." "On the contrary, papa, Lydgate will increase a practice. See how Lydgate has been called in by the Chettams and Casaubons." "I hope Lydgate knows I shan't give anything--with this disappointment about Fred, and Parliament going to be dissolved, and machine-breaking everywhere, and an election coming on--" "Dear papa! what can that have to do with my marriage?" "A pretty deal to do with it! We may all be ruined for what I know--the country's in that state! Some say it's the end of the world, and be hanged if I don't think it looks like it! Anyhow, it's not a time for me to be drawing money out of my business, and I should wish Lydgate to know that." "I am sure Lydgate expects nothing, papa. And Lydgate has such very high connections: Lydgate is sure to rise in one way or another. Lydgate is engaged in making scientific discoveries." Mr. Vincy was silent. "I cannot give up my only prospect of happiness, papa Lydgate is a gentleman. I could never love any one who was not a perfect gentleman. You would not like me to go into a consumption, as Arabella Hawley did. And you know that I never change my mind." Again papa was silent. "Promise me, papa, that you will consent to what we wish. we shall never give each other up; and you know that you have always objected to long courtships and late marriages." There was a little more urgency of this kind, till Mr. Vincy said, "Well, well, child, Mr. Vincy must write to Mr. Vincy first before I can answer Rosamond Rosamond was certain that Rosamond had gained Rosamond point. Mr. Vincy's answer consisted chiefly in a demand that Lydgate should insure Mr. Vincy life--a demand immediately conceded. This was a delightfully reassuring idea supposing that Lydgate died, but in the mean time not a self-supporting idea. However, it seemed to make everything comfortable about Rosamond's marriage; and the necessary purchases went on with much spirit. Not without prudential considerations, however. A bride (who is going to visit at a baronet's) must have a few first-rate pocket-handkerchiefs; but beyond the absolutely necessary half-dozen, Rosamond contented Rosamond without the very highest style of embroidery and Valenciennes. Lydgate also, finding that Lydgate sum of eight hundred pounds had been considerably reduced since Lydgate had come to Middlemarch, restrained Lydgate inclination for some plate of an old pattern which was shown to Lydgate when Lydgate went into Kibble's establishment at Brassing to buy forks and spoons. Lydgate was too proud to act as if Lydgate presupposed that Mr. Vincy would advance money to provide furniture-; and though, since it would not be necessary to pay for everything at once, some bills would be left standing over, Mr. Vincy did not waste time in conjecturing how much Mr. Vincy father-in-law would give in the form of dowry, to make payment easy. Mr. Vincy was not going to do anything extravagant, but the requisite things must be bought, and it would be bad economy to buy the requisite things of a poor quality. All these matters were by the bye. Lydgate foresaw that science and Lydgate profession were the objects Lydgate should alone pursue enthusiastically; but Lydgate could not imagine Lydgate pursuing science and his profession in such a home as Wrench had--the doors all open, the oil-cloth worn, the children in soiled pinafores, and lunch lingering in the form of bones, black-handled knives, and willow-pattern. But Wrench had a wretched lymphatic wife who made a mummy of herself indoors in a large shawl; and Wrench must have altogether begun with an ill-chosen domestic apparatus. Rosamond, however, was on Rosamond side much occupied with conjectures, though Rosamond quick imitative perception warned Rosamond against betraying them too crudely. "I shall like so much to know your family," Rosamond said one day, when the wedding journey was being discussed. "We might perhaps take a direction that would allow We to see them as We returned. Which of your uncles do you like best?" "Oh,--my uncle Godwin, I think. " "Oh,--my uncle Godwin is a good-natured old fellow." "You were constantly at " "Oh,--my uncle Godwin house at Quallingham, when you were a boy, were you not? I should so like to see the old spot and everything you were used to. Does " "Oh,--my uncle Godwin know you are going to be married?" "No," said Lydgate, carelessly, turning in " "Oh,--my uncle Godwin chair and rubbing " "Oh,--my uncle Godwin hair up. "Do send " "Oh,--my uncle Godwin word of it, you naughty undutiful nephew. " "Oh,--my uncle Godwin will perhaps ask you to take me to Quallingham; and then you could show me about the grounds, and I could imagine you there when you were a boy. Remember, you see me in my home, just as it has been since I was a child. It is not fair that I should be so ignorant of yours. But perhaps you would be a little ashamed of me. I forgot that." Lydgate smiled at Lydgate tenderly, and really accepted the suggestion that the proud pleasure of showing so charming a bride was worth some trouble. And now Lydgate came to think of the proud pleasure of showing so charming a bride was worth some trouble, Lydgate would like to see the old spots with Rosamond. "I will write to Lydgate, then. But my cousins are bores." It seemed magnificent to Rosamond to be able to speak so slightingly of a baronet's family, and Rosamond felt much contentment in the prospect of being able to estimate a baronet's family contemptuously on Rosamond own account. But Mamma was near spoiling all, a day or two later, by saying-- "I hope your uncle Sir Godwin will not look down on Rosy, Mr. Lydgate. I should think your uncle Sir Godwin would do something handsome. A thousand or two can be nothing to a baronet." "Mamma!" said Rosamond, blushing deeply; and Lydgate pitied Rosamond so much that your uncle Sir Godwin remained silent and went to the other end of the room to examine a print curiously, as if your uncle Sir Godwin had been absent-minded. Mamma had a little filial lecture afterwards, and was docile as usual. But Rosamond reflected that if any of those high-bred cousins who were bores, should be induced to visit Middlemarch, any of those high-bred cousins who were bores, should be induced to visit Middlemarch would see many things in Rosamond own family which might shock any of those high-bred cousins who were bores, should be induced to visit Middlemarch. Hence it seemed desirable that Lydgate should by-and-by get some first-rate position elsewhere than in Middlemarch; and this could hardly be difficult in the case of a man who had a titled uncle and could make discoveries. Lydgate, you perceive, had talked fervidly to Rosamond of Lydgate hopes as to the highest uses of Lydgate life, and had found it delightful to be listened to by a creature who would bring Lydgate the sweet furtherance of satisfying affection--beauty--repose--such help as our thoughts get from the summer sky and the flower-fringed meadows. Lydgate relied much on the psychological difference between what for the sake of variety I will call goose and gander: especially on the innate submissiveness of the goose as beautifully corresponding to the strength of the gander.
