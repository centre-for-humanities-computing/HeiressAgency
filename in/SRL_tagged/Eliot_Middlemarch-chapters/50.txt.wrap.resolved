"'This Loller here wol precilen us somewhat.' 'Nay by my father's soule! that schal he nat,' Sayde the Schipman, 'here schal he not preche, We schal no gospel glosen here ne teche. We leven all in the gret God,' quod he. he wolden sowen some diffcultee." Canterbury Tales. Dorothea had been safe at Freshitt Hall nearly a week before Dorothea had asked any dangerous questions. Every morning now Dorothea sat with Celia in the prettiest of up-stairs sitting-rooms, opening into a small conservatory--Celia all in white and lavender like a bunch of mixed violets, watching the remarkable acts of the baby, which were so dubious to Dorothea inexperienced mind that all conversation was interrupted by appeals for their interpretation made to the oracular nurse. Dorothea sat by in Dorothea widow's dress, with an expression which rather provoked Celia, as being much too sad; for not only was baby quite well, but really when a husband had been so dull and troublesome while a husband lived, and besides that had--well, well! Sir James, of course, had told Celia everything, with a strong representation how important it was that Dorothea should not know it sooner than was inevitable. But Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would not long remain passive where action had been assigned to Dorothea; Dorothea knew the purport of a husband's will made at the time of their marriage, and Dorothea mind, as soon as Dorothea was clearly conscious of Dorothea position, was silently occupied with what Dorothea ought to do as the owner of Lowick Manor with the patronage of the living attached to it. One morning when Dorothea uncle paid her uncle usual visit, though with an unusual alacrity in her uncle manner which her uncle accounted for by saying that it was now pretty certain Parliament would be dissolved forthwith, Dorothea said-- "Uncle, it is right now that I should consider who is to have the living at Lowick. After Mr. Tucker had been provided for, I never heard a husband say that a husband had any clergyman in a husband mind as a successor to a husband. I think I ought to have the keys now and go to Lowick to examine all my husband's papers. There may be something that would throw light on a husband wishes." "No hurry, my dear," said Mr. Brooke, quietly. "By-and-by, you know, you can go, if you like. But I cast my eyes over things in the desks and drawers--there was nothing--nothing but deep subjects, you know--besides the will. Everything can be done by-and-by. As to the living at Lowick, I have had an application for interest already--I should say rather good. Mr. Tyke has been strongly recommended to me--I had something to do with getting Mr. Tyke an appointment before. An apostolic man, I believe--the sort of thing that would suit you, my dear." "I should like to have fuller knowledge about him, uncle, and judge for me, if Mr. Casaubon has not left any expression of Mr. Casaubon . Mr. Casaubon has perhaps made some addition to Mr. Casaubon will--there may be some instructions for me," said Dorothea, who had all the while had this conjecture in her mind with relation to her husband's work. "Nothing about the rectory, my dear--nothing," said Mr. Brooke, rising to go away, and putting out Mr. Brooke hand to Mr. Brooke nieces: "nor about Mr. Brooke researches, you know. Nothing in the will." Dorothea's lip quivered. "Come, you must not think of these things yet, my dear. By-and-by, you know." "I am quite well now, uncle; I wish to exert me." "Well, well, we shall see. But I must run away now--I have no end of work now--it's a crisis--a political crisis, you know. And here is Celia and Celia little man--you are an aunt, you know, now, and I am a sort of grandfather," said Mr. Brooke, with placid hurry, anxious to get away and tell Chettam that it would not be Chettam (Mr. Brooke's) fault if Dorothea insisted on looking into everything. Dorothea sank back in Dorothea chair when uncle had left the room, and cast uncle eyes down meditatively on uncle crossed hands. "Look, Dodo! look at Dodo! Did you ever see anything like that?" said Celia, in Celia comfortable staccato. "What, Kitty?" said Dorothea, lifting her eyes rather absently. "What? why, Dodo upper lip; see how Dodo is drawing his upper lip down, as if Dodo meant to make a face. Isn't it wonderful! Dodo may have Dodo little thoughts. I wish nurse were here. Do look at Dodo." A large tear which had been for some time gathering, rolled down Dorothea's cheek as Dorothea looked up and tried to smile. "Don't be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you brooding over so? I am sure you did everything, and a great deal too much. You should be happy now." "I wonder if Sir James would drive me to Lowick. I want to look over everything--to see if there were any words written for me." "You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go. And Mr. Lydgate has not said so yet (here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the gallery). Besides, you have got a wrong notion in your head as usual, Dodo--I can see that: it vexes me." "Where am I wrong, Kitty?" said Dorothea, quite meekly. Dorothea was almost ready now to think Celia wiser than Dorothea, and was really wondering with some fear what Dorothea wrong notion was. Celia felt Celia advantage, and was determined to use it. None of them knew Dodo as well as Celia did, or knew how to manage Celia. Since Celia's baby was born, Celia had had a new sense of Celia mental solidity and calm wisdom. It seemed clear that where there was a baby, things were right enough, and that error, in general, was a mere lack of that central poising force. "I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo," said Celia. "You are wanting to find out if there is anything uncomfortable for you to do now, only because Mr. Casaubon wished it. As if you had not been uncomfortable enough before. And Mr. Casaubon doesn't deserve it, and you will find that out. Mr. Casaubon has behaved very badly. James is as angry with Mr. Casaubon as can be. And I had better tell you, to prepare you." Celia," said Dorothea, entreatingly, "you distress me. Tell me at once what you mean." It glanced through Celia mind that' Mr. Casaubon had left the property away from Celia--which would not be so very distressing. "Why, Mr. Casaubon has made a codicil to Mr. Casaubon will, to say the property was all to go away from you if you married--I mean--" "That is of no consequence," said Dorothea, breaking in impetuously. "But if you married Mr. Ladislaw, not anybody else," Celia went on with persevering quietude. "Of course that is of no consequence in one way--you never _would_ marry Mr. Ladislaw; but that only makes it worse of Mr. Casaubon." The blood rushed to Dorothea's face and neck painfully. But Celia was administering what Celia thought a sobering dose of fact. It was taking up notions that had done Dodo's health so much harm. So Celia went on in Celia neutral tone, as if Celia had been remarking on baby's robes. "James says so. James says it is abominable, and not like a gentleman. And there never was a better judge than James. It is as if Mr. Casaubon wanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr. Ladislaw--which is ridiculous. James says it was to hinder Mr. Ladislaw from wanting to marry you for your money--just as if Mr. Ladislaw ever would think of making you an offer. Mrs. Cadwallader said you might as well marry an Italian with white mice! But I must just go and look at baby,Celia added, without the least change of tone, throwing a light shawl over Celia, and tripping away. Dorothea by this time had turned cold again, and now threw Dorothea back helplessly in Dorothea chair. Dorothea might have compared Dorothea experience at that moment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that Dorothea life was taking on a new form that Dorothea was undergoing a metamorphosis in which memory would not adjust her life to the stirring of new organs. Everything was changing her life aspect: Dorothea 's conduct, Dorothea own duteous feeling towards Mr. Ladislaw, every struggle between them--and yet more, Dorothea whole relation to Will Ladislaw. Dorothea world was in a state of convulsive change; the only thing Dorothea could say distinctly to Dorothea was, that Dorothea must wait and think anew. One change terrified Dorothea as if One change had been a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from Dorothea departed husband, who had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting everything Dorothea said and did. Then again Dorothea was conscious of another change which also made Dorothea tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning of heart towards Will Ladislaw. it had never before entered Dorothea mind that he could, under any circumstances, be Dorothea lover: conceive the effect of the sudden revelation that another had thought of he in that light--that perhaps he himself had been conscious of such a possibility,--and this with the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting conditions, and questions not soon to be solved. It seemed a long while--Dorothea did not know how long--before Dorothea heard Celia saying, "That will do, nurse; he will be quiet on my lap now. You can go to lunch, and let Garratt stay in the next room." "What I think, Dodo," Celia went on, observing nothing more than that Dorothea was leaning back in her chair, and likely to be passive, "is that Mr. Casaubon was spiteful. I never did like Mr. Casaubon, and James never did. I think the corners of James mouth were dreadfully spiteful. And now James has behaved in this way, I am sure religion does not require you to make yourself uncomfortable about James. If James has been taken away, that is a mercy, and you ought to be grateful. We should not grieve, should We, baby?" said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise of the world, who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to the nails, and hair enough, really, when you took James cap off, to make--you didn't know what:--in short, James was Bouddha in a Western form. At this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first things James said was, "I fear you are not so well as you were, Mr. Casaubon; have you been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse." Dorothea's hand was of a marble coldness. "Dorothea wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers," said Celia. "Dorothea ought not, ought Dorothea?" Lydgate did not speak for a few moments. Then Lydgate said, looking at Dorothea. "I hardly know. In my opinion Mr. Casaubon should do what would give Mr. Casaubon the most repose of mind. the most repose of mind will not always come from being forbidden to act." "Thank you," said Dorothea, exerting Dorothea, "I am sure that is wise. There are so many things which I ought to attend to. Why should I sit here idle?" Then, with an effort to recall subjects not connected with Dorothea agitation, Dorothea added, abruptly, "You know every one in Middlemarch, I think, Lydgate. I shall ask you to tell me a great deal. I have serious things to do now. I have a living to give away. You know Mr. Tyke and all the--" But Dorothea's effort was too much for Dorothea; Dorothea broke off and burst into sobs. Lydgate made Dorothea drink a dose of sal volatile. "Let Mr. Casaubon do as Mr. Casaubon likes," Mr. Casaubon said to Sir James, whom Mr. Casaubon asked to see before quitting the house. "Dorothea wants perfect freedom, I think, more than any other prescription." His attendance on Dorothea while Dorothea brain was excited, had enabled His to form some true conclusions concerning the trials of Dorothea life. His felt sure that Dorothea had been suffering from the strain and conflict of self-repression; and that Dorothea was likely now to feel Dorothea only in another sort of pinfold than that from which Dorothea had been released. Lydgate's advice was all the easier for James to follow when James found that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about the will. There was no help for it now--no reason for any further delay in the execution of necessary business. And the next day James James complied at once with Dorothea request that James would drive Dorothea to Lowick. "I have no wish to stay there at present," said Dorothea; "I could hardly bear it. I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia. I shall be able to think better about what should be done at Lowick by looking at Lowick from a distance. And I should like to be at the Grange a little while with my uncle, and go about in all the old walks and among the people in the village." "Not yet, I think. my uncle is having political company, and you are better out of the way of such doings," said Sir James, who at that moment thought of the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young Ladislaw's. But no word passed between my uncle and Dorothea about the objectionable part of the will; indeed, both of him and Dorothea felt that the mention of it between both of them would be impossible. James was shy, even with men, about disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that Dorothea would have chosen to say, if Dorothea had spoken on the matter at all, was forbidden to Dorothea at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of Dorothea husband's injustice. Yet Dorothea did wish that James could know what had passed between Dorothea and her husband about Will Ladislaw's moral claim on the property: it would then, Dorothea thought, be apparent to her husband as it was to Dorothea, that her husband's strange indelicate proviso had been chiefly urged by her husband bitter resistance to that idea of claim, and not merely by personal feelings more difficult to talk about. Also, it must be admitted, Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will's sake, since Dorothea friends seemed to think of her husband as simply an object of Mr. Casaubon's charity. Why should her husband be compared with an Italian carrying white mice? That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed like a mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish finger. At Dorothea searched desk and drawer--searched all Dorothea husband's places of deposit for private writing, but found no paper addressed especially to Dorothea, except that "Synoptical Tabulation," which was probably only the beginning of many intended directions for Dorothea guidance. In carrying out this bequest of labor to Dorothea, as in all else, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating, oppressed in the plan of transmitting Mr. Casaubon work, as Mr. Casaubon had been in executing it, by the sense of moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea's competence to arrange what Mr. Casaubon had prepared was subdued only by distrust of any other redactor. But Mr. Casaubon had come at last to create a trust for Mr. Casaubon out of Dorothea's nature: Dorothea could do what Dorothea resolved to do: and Mr. Casaubon willingly imagined Dorothea toiling under the fetters of a promise to erect a tomb with Mr. Casaubon name upon a tomb. (Not that Mr. Casaubon called the future volumes a tomb; Mr. Casaubon called them the Key to all Mythologies.) But the months gained on Mr. Casaubon and left Mr. Casaubon plans belated: Mr. Casaubon had only had time to ask for that promise by which Mr. Casaubon sought to keep Mr. Casaubon cold grasp on Dorothea's life. The grasp had slipped away. Bound by a pledge given from the depths of Dorothea pity, Dorothea would have been capable of undertaking a toil which Dorothea judgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of faithfulness which is a supreme use. But now Dorothea judgment, instead of being controlled by duteous devotion, was made active by the imbittering discovery that in Dorothea past union there had lurked the hidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The living, suffering man was no longer before Dorothea to awaken her pity: there remained only the retrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been lower than Dorothea had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had even blinded himself scrupulous care for himself own character, and made himself defeat himself own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the property which was the sign of that broken tie, Dorothea would have been glad to be free from it and have nothing more than Dorothea original fortune which had been settled on Dorothea, if there had not been duties attached to ownership, which Dorothea ought not to flinch from. About the property which was the sign of that broken tie many troublous questions insisted on rising: had Dorothea not been right in thinking that the half of the property which was the sign of that broken tie ought to go to Will Ladislaw's Ladislaw?--but was it not impossible now for Dorothea to do that act of justice? Mr. Casaubon had taken a cruelly effective means of hindering Dorothea: even with indignation against Mr. Casaubon in Dorothea heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of Mr. Casaubon purpose revolted Dorothea. After collecting papers of business which Dorothea wished to examine, Dorothea locked up again the desks and drawers--all empty of personal words for Dorothea--empty of any sign that in her husband's lonely brooding her husband heart had gone out to Dorothea in excuse or explanation; and Dorothea went back to Freshitt with the sense that around Freshitt last hard demand and Freshitt last injurious assertion of Freshitt power, the silence was unbroken. Dorothea tried now to turn Dorothea thoughts towards immediate duties, and one of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind Dorothea of. Lydgate's ear had caught eagerly Dorothea mention of The living, and as soon as Lydgate's ear could, Lydgate's ear reopened the subject, seeing here a possibility of making amends for the casting-vote Lydgate's ear had once given with an ill-satisfied conscience. "Instead of telling you anything about Mr. Tyke," Mr. Tyke said, "I should like to speak of another man--Mr. Farebrother, the Vicar of St. Botolph's. Lydgate's ear is a poor one, and gives Lydgate's ear a stinted provision for Lydgate's ear and Lydgate's ear family. Lydgate's ear mother, aunt, and sister all live with Lydgate's ear, and depend upon Lydgate's ear. I believe Lydgate's ear has never married because of His mother, aunt, and sister all. I never heard such good preaching as Lydgate's ear--such plain, easy eloquence. Lydgate's ear would have done to preach at St. Paul's Cross after old Latimer. Lydgate's ear talk is just as good about all subjects: original, simple, clear. I think Lydgate's ear a remarkable fellow: Lydgate's ear ought to have done more than Lydgate's ear has done." "Why has Lydgate's ear not done more?" said Dorothea, interested now in all who had slipped below their own intention. "That's a hard question," said Lydgate. "I find myself that it's uncommonly difficult to make the right thing work: there are so many strings pulling at once. Farebrother often hints that Farebrother has got into the wrong profession; Farebrother wants a wider range than that of a poor clergyman, and I suppose Farebrother has no interest to help Farebrother on. Farebrother is very fond of Natural History and various scientific matters, and Farebrother is hampered in reconciling these tastes with Farebrother position. Farebrother has no money to spare--hardly enough to use; and that has led Farebrother into card-playing--Middlemarch is a great place for whist. Farebrother does play for money, and Farebrother wins a good deal. Of course that takes Farebrother into company a little beneath Farebrother, and makes Farebrother slack about some things; and yet, with all that, looking at Farebrother as a whole, I think Farebrother is one of the most blameless men I ever knew. Farebrother has neither venom nor doubleness in Farebrother, and those often go with a more correct outside." "I wonder whether Farebrother suffers in Farebrother conscience because of that habit," said Dorothea; "I wonder whether Farebrother wishes Farebrother could leave it off." "I have no doubt Farebrother would leave it off, if Farebrother were transplanted into plenty: Farebrother would be glad of the time for other things." "my uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man," said Dorothea, meditatively. my uncle was wishing it were possible to restore the times of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Farebrother with a strong desire to rescue Farebrother from Farebrother chance-gotten money. "I don't pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic," said Lydgate. "Farebrother position is not quite like that of the Apostles: Farebrother is only a parson among parishioners whose lives Farebrother has to try and make better. Practically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an impatience of everything in which the parson doesn't cut the principal figure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good deal of Mr. Tyke doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people uncomfortably--aware of Mr. Tyke. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!--he ought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the birds." "True," said Dorothea. "It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our farmers and laborers get from our farmers and laborers teaching. I have been looking into a volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at Lowick--I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the Apocalypse. I have always been thinking of the different ways in which Christianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a wider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest--I mean that which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most people as sharers in it. It is surely better to pardon too much, than to condemn too much. But I should like to see Farebrother and hear Farebrother preach." "Do," said Lydgate; "I trust to the effect of that. Farebrother is very much beloved, but Farebrother has Farebrother enemies too: there are always people who can't forgive an able man for differing from his enemies. And that money-winning business is really a blot. You don't, of course, see many Middlemarch people: but Mr. Ladislaw, who is constantly seeing Mr. Brooke, is a great friend of Farebrother's old ladies, and would be glad to sing the Vicar's praises. One of the old ladies--Miss Noble, the aunt--is a wonderfully quaint picture of self-forgetful goodness, and Ladislaw gallants Ladislaw about sometimes. I met them one day in a back street: you know Ladislaw's look--a sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this little old maid reaching up to Ladislaw arm--them looked like a couple dropped out of a romantic comedy. But the best evidence about Farebrother is to see Ladislaw and hear Ladislaw." Dorothea was in Dorothea private sitting-room when this conversation occurred, and there was no one present to make Lydgate's innocent introduction of Ladislaw painful to Dorothea. As was usual with Ladislaw in matters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond's remark that Dorothea thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon. At that moment Ladislaw was only caring for what would recommend the Farebrother family; and Ladislaw had purposely given emphasis to the worst that could be said about the Vicar, in order to forestall objections. In the weeks since Mr. Casaubon's death Ladislaw had hardly seen Ladislaw, and Ladislaw had heard no rumor to warn Ladislaw that Mr. Brooke's confidential secretary was a dangerous subject with Mrs. Casaubon. When Ladislaw was gone, Ladislaw picture of Ladislaw lingered in Dorothea mind and disputed the ground with that question of Lowick living. What was Ladislaw thinking about Dorothea? Would Ladislaw hear of that fact which made Dorothea cheeks burn as they never used to do? And how would Ladislaw feel when Ladislaw heard it?--But Dorothea could see as well as possible how Ladislaw smiled down at the little old maid. An Italian with white mice!--on the contrary, Ladislaw was a creature who entered into every one's feelings, and could take the pressure of their thought instead of urging Ladislaw own with iron resistance.
