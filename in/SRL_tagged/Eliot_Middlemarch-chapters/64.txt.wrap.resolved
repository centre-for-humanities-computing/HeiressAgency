1st Gent. Where lies the power, there let the blame lie too. 1st Gent. Nay, power is relative; you cannot fright The coming pest with border fortresses, Or catch your carp with subtle argument. All force is twain in one: cause is not cause Unless effect be there; and action's self Must needs contain a passive. So command Exists but with obedience." Even if Lydgate had been inclined to be quite open about Lydgate affairs, Lydgate knew that Lydgate would have hardly been in Mr. Farebrother's power to give Lydgate the help Lydgate immediately wanted. With the year's bills coming in from Lydgate tradesmen, with Dover's threatening hold on Lydgate furniture, and with nothing to depend on but slow dribbling payments from patients who must not be offended--for the handsome fees Lydgate had had from Freshitt Hall and Lowick Manor had been easily absorbed--nothing less than a thousand pounds would have freed Lydgate from actual embarrassment, and left a residue which, according to the favorite phrase of hopefulness in such circumstances, would have given Lydgate "time to look about Lydgate." Naturally, the merry Christmas bringing the happy New Year, when fellow-citizens expect to be paid for the trouble and goods fellow-citizens have smilingly bestowed on fellow-citizens neighbors, had so tightened the pressure of sordid cares on Lydgate's mind that it was hardly possible for Lydgate to think unbrokenly of any other subject, even the most habitual and soliciting. Lydgate was not an ill-tempered man; Lydgate intellectual activity, the ardent kindness of Lydgate heart, as well as Lydgate strong frame, would always, under tolerably easy conditions, have kept Lydgate above the petty uncontrolled susceptibilities which make bad temper. But Lydgate was now a prey to that worst irritation which arises not simply from annoyances, but from the second consciousness underlying those annoyances, of wasted energy and a degrading preoccupation, which was the reverse of all Lydgate former purposes. "_This_ is what I am thinking of; and _that_ is what I might have been thinking of," was the bitter incessant murmur within Lydgate, making every difficulty a double goad to impatience. Some gentlemen have made an amazing figure in literature by general discontent with the universe as a trap of dulness into which Some gentlemen great souls have fallen by mistake; but the sense of a stupendous self and an insignificant world may have the universe consolations. Lydgate's discontent was much harder to bear: it was the sense that there was a grand existence in thought and effective action lying around him, while him self was being narrowed into the miserable isolation of egoistic fears, and vulgar anxieties for events that might allay such fears. him troubles will perhaps appear miserably sordid, and beneath the attention of lofty persons who can know nothing of debt except on a magnificent scale. Doubtless they were sordid; and for the majority, who are not lofty, there is no escape from sordidness but by being free from money-craving, with all its base hopes and temptations, its watching for death, its hinted requests, its horse-dealer's desire to make bad work pass for good, its seeking for function which ought to be another's, its compulsion often to long for Luck in the shape of a wide calamity. It was because Lydgate writhed under the idea of getting his neck beneath this vile yoke that his had fallen into a bitter moody state which was continually widening Rosamond's alienation from his. After the first disclosure about the bill of sale, his had made many efforts to draw her into sympathy with his about possible measures for narrowing their expenses, and with the threatening approach of Christmas his propositions grew more and more definite. "We two can do with only one servant, and live on very little," only one servant said, "and I shall manage with one horse." For Lydgate, as we have seen, had begun to reason, with a more distinct vision, about the expenses of living, and any share of pride he had given to appearances of that sort was meagre compared with the pride which made he revolt from exposure as a debtor, or from asking men to help he with men money. "Of course you can dismiss the other two servants, if you like," said Rosamond; "but I should have thought it would be very injurious to your position for us to live in a poor way. You must expect your practice to be lowered." "Rosamond, it is not a question of choice. us have begun too expensively. Peacock, you know, lived in a much smaller house than this. It is my fault: I ought to have known better, and I deserve a thrashing--if there were anybody who had a right to give it me--for bringing you into the necessity of living in a poorer way than you have been used to. But us married because us loved each other, I suppose. And that may help us to pull along till things get better. Come, dear, put down that work and come to me." He was really in chill gloom about her at that moment, but He dreaded a future without affection, and was determined to resist the oncoming of division between affection. Rosamond obeyed He, and He took Rosamond on He knee, but in Rosamond secret soul Rosamond was utterly aloof from He. The poor thing saw only that the world was not ordered to Rosamond liking, and Lydgate was part of the world. But He held Rosamond waist with one hand and laid the other gently on both of hers; for this rather abrupt man had much tenderness in He manners towards women, seeming to have always present in He imagination the weakness of women frames and the delicate poise of women health both in body and mind. And He began again to speak persuasively. "I find, now I look into things a little, Rosy, that it is wonderful what an amount of money slips away in our housekeeping. I suppose the servants are careless, and our have had a great many people coming. But there must be many in our rank who manage with much less: the servants must do with commoner things, I suppose, and look after the scraps. It seems, money goes but a little way in these matters, for Wrench has everything as plain as possible, and Wrench has a very large practice." "Oh, if you think of living as the Wrenches do!" said Rosamond, with a little turn of Rosamond neck. "But I have heard you express your disgust at that way of living." "Yes, they have bad taste in everything--they make economy look ugly. We needn't do that. I only meant that they avoid expenses, although Wrench has a capital practice." "Why should not you have a good practice, Tertius? Mr. Peacock had. You should be more careful not to offend people, and you should send out medicines as the others do. I am sure you began well, and you got several good houses. It cannot answer to be eccentric; you should think what will be generally liked," said Rosamond, in a decided little tone of admonition. Lydgate's anger rose: Lydgate was prepared to be indulgent towards feminine weakness, but not towards feminine dictation. The shallowness of a waternixie's soul may have a charm until she becomes didactic. But Lydgate controlled Lydgate, and only said, with a touch of despotic firmness-- "What I am to do in my practice, Rosy, it is for me to judge. That is not the question between us. It is enough for you to know that us income is likely to be a very narrow one--hardly four hundred, perhaps less, for a long time to come, and us must try to re-arrange us lives in accordance with that fact." Rosamond was silent for a moment or two, looking before Rosamond, and then said, "My uncle Bulstrode ought to allow you a salary for the time you give to the Hospital: it is not right that you should work for nothing." "It was understood from the beginning that my services would be gratuitous. That, again, need not enter into us discussion. I have pointed out what is the only probability," said Lydgate, impatiently. Then checking Lydgate, Lydgate went on more quietly-- "I think I see one resource which would free us from a good deal of the present difficulty. I hear that young Ned Plymdale is going to be married to Miss Sophy Toller. young Ned Plymdale are rich, and it is not often that a good house is vacant in Middlemarch. I feel sure that young Ned Plymdale would be glad to take a good house from us with most of us furniture, and young Ned Plymdale would be willing to pay handsomely for the lease. I can employ Trumbull to speak to young Ned Plymdale about Trumbull." Rosamond left Rosamond husband's knee and walked slowly to the other end of the room; when Rosamond turned round and walked towards her husband it was evident that the tears had come, and that Rosamond was biting Rosamond under-lip and clasping Rosamond hands to keep Rosamond from crying. Lydgate was wretched--shaken with anger and yet feeling that Lydgate would be unmanly to vent anger just now. "I am very sorry, Rosamond; I know this is painful." "I thought, at least, when I had borne to send the plate back and have her husband taking an inventory of the furniture--I should have thought _that_ would suffice." "I explained it to you at the time, dear. That was that Security and behind that Security there is a debt. And a debt must be paid within the next few months, else we shall have we furniture sold. If young Ned Plymdale young Ned Plymdale will take we house and most of our furniture, we shall be able to pay a debt, and some others too, and we shall be quit of a place too expensive for we. we might take a smaller house: Trumbull, I know, has a very decent one to let at thirty pounds a-year, and this is ninety." Lydgate uttered this speech in the curt hammering way with which we usually try to nail down a vague mind to imperative facts. Tears rolled silently down Rosamond's cheeks; Rosamond just pressed Rosamond handkerchief against them, and stood looking at the large vase on the mantel-piece. It was a moment of more intense bitterness than Rosamond had ever felt before. At last Rosamond said, without hurry and with careful emphasis-- "I never could have believed that you would like to act in that way." "Like it?" burst out Lydgate, rising from his chair, thrusting his hands in his pockets and stalking away from the hearth; "it's not a question of liking. Of course, I don't like it; it's the only thing I can do." his wheeled round there, and turned towards Rosamond. "I should have thought there were many other means than that," said Rosamond. "Let us have a sale and leave Middlemarch altogether." "To do what? What is the use of my leaving my work in Middlemarch to go where I have none? We should be just as penniless elsewhere as We are here," said Lydgate still more angrily. "If We are to be in that position it will be entirely your own doing, Tertius," said Rosamond, turning round to speak with the fullest conviction. "You will not behave as you ought to do to your own family. You offended Lydgate. Sir Godwin was very kind to Sir Godwin when We were at Quallingham, and I am sure if you showed proper regard to Sir Godwin and told Sir Godwin your affairs, Sir Godwin would do anything for Sir Godwin. But rather than that, you like giving up We house and furniture to young Ned Plymdale." There was something like fierceness in Lydgate's eyes, as Sir Godwin answered with new violence, "Well, then, if you will have it so, I do like it. I admit that I like it better than making a fool of Sir Godwin by going to beg where it's of no use. Understand then, that it is what I _like to do._" There was a tone in the last sentence which was equivalent to the clutch of his strong hand on Rosamond's delicate arm. But for all that, his will was not a whit stronger than hers. hers immediately walked out of the room in silence, but with an intense determination to hinder what Lydgate liked to do. Lydgate went out of the house, but as Lydgate blood cooled Lydgate felt that the chief result of the discussion was a deposit of dread within Lydgate at the idea of opening with Lydgate wife in future subjects which might again urge Lydgate to violent speech. It was as if a fracture in delicate crystal had begun, and Lydgate was afraid of any movement that might mate it fatal. Lydgate marriage would be a mere piece of bitter irony if they could not go on loving each other. Lydgate had long ago made up Lydgate mind to what Lydgate thought was her negative character--her want of sensibility, which showed itself in disregard both of Lydgate specific wishes and of Lydgate general aims. The first great disappointment had been borne: the tender devotedness and docile adoration of his wife must be renounced, and life must be taken up on a lower stage of expectation, as it is by men who have lost the tender devotedness and docile adoration of the ideal wife limbs. But his wife had not only his wife claims, his wife had still a hold on his heart, and it was his intense desire that the hold should remain strong. In marriage, the certainty, "his wife will never love me much," is easier to bear than the fear, "I shall love his wife no more." Hence, after that outburst, his inward effort was entirely to excuse his wife, and to blame the hard circumstances which were partly his fault. his tried that evening, by petting his wife, to heal the wound his had made in the morning, and it was not in Rosamond's nature to be repellent or sulky; indeed, his wife welcomed the signs that his wife loved his wife and was under control. But this was something quite distinct from loving _him_. Lydgate would not have chosen soon to recur to the plan of parting with the house; his was resolved to carry the house out, and say as little more about the house as possible. But Rosamond touched on the house at breakfast by saying, mildly-- "Have you spoken to Trumbull yet?" "No," said Lydgate, "but I shall call on Lydgate as I go by this morning. No time must be lost." Lydgate took Rosamond's question as a sign that Rosamond withdrew Rosamond inward opposition, and kissed Rosamond head caressingly when Lydgate got up to go away. As soon as it was late enough to make a call, Rosamond went to Mrs. Plymdale, Mr. Ned's mother, and entered with pretty congratulations into the subject of the coming marriage. Mrs. Plymdale's maternal view was, that Rosamond might possibly now have retrospective glimpses of Rosamond own folly; and feeling the advantages to be at present all on the side of Rosamond son, was too kind a woman not to behave graciously. "Yes, young Ned Plymdale is most happy, I must say. And Sophy Toller is all I could desire in a daughter-in-law. Of course a daughter-in-law father is able to do something handsome for a daughter-in-law--that is only what would be expected with a brewery like her father. And the connection is everything we should desire. But that is not what I look at. a daughter-in-law is such a very nice girl--no airs, no pretensions, though on a level with the first. I don't mean with the titled aristocracy. I see very little good in people aiming out of the titled aristocracy own sphere. I mean that Sophy is equal to the best in the town, and a daughter-in-law is contented with that." "I have always thought a daughter-in-law very agreeable," said Rosamond. "I look upon it as a reward for Ned, who never held his head too high, that his should have got into the very best connection," continued Mrs. Plymdale, a daughter-in-law native sharpness softened by a fervid sense that a daughter-in-law was taking a correct view. "And such particular people as the Tollers are, such particular people as the Tollers are might have objected because some of our friends are not theirs. It is well known that your aunt Bulstrode and I have been intimate from our youth, and young Ned Plymdale has been always on Mr. Bulstrode's side. And I myself prefer serious opinions. But the Tollers have welcomed young Ned Plymdale all the same." "I am sure young Ned Plymdale is a very deserving, well-principled young man," said Rosamond, with a neat air of patronage in return for young Ned Plymdale's wholesome corrections. "Oh, young Ned Plymdale has not the style of a captain in the army, or that sort of carriage as if everybody was beneath young Ned Plymdale, or that showy kind of talking, and singing, and intellectual talent. But I am thankful young Ned Plymdale has not. It is a poor preparation both for here and Hereafter." "Oh dear, yes; appearances have very little to do with happiness," said Rosamond. "I think there is every prospect of their being a happy couple. What house will their take?" "Oh, as for that, their must put up with what their can get. their have been looking at the house in St. Peter's Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt's; it belongs to Mr. Hackbutt, and Mr. Hackbutt is putting it nicely in repair. I suppose their are not likely to hear of a better. Indeed, I think young Ned Plymdale will decide the matter to-day." "I should think it is a nice house; I like St. Peter's Place." "Well, it is near the Church, and a genteel situation. But the windows are narrow, and the windows is all ups and downs. You don't happen to know of any other that would be at liberty?" said young Ned Plymdale, fixing young Ned Plymdale round black eyes on Rosamond with the animation of a sudden thought in them. "Oh no; I hear so little of those things." Rosamond had not foreseen that question and answer in setting out to pay Rosamond visit; Rosamond had simply meant to gather any information which would help Rosamond to avert the parting with Rosamond own house under circumstances thoroughly disagreeable to Rosamond. As to the untruth in Rosamond reply, Rosamond no more reflected on it than Rosamond did on the untruth there was in Rosamond saying that appearances had very little to do with happiness. Rosamond object, Rosamond was convinced, was thoroughly justifiable: it was Lydgate whose intention was inexcusable; and there was a plan in Rosamond mind which, when Rosamond had carried whose intention out fully, would prove how very false a step whose intention would have been for him to have descended from him position. Rosamond returned home by Mr. Borthrop Trumbull's office, meaning to call there. It was the first time in Rosamond life that Rosamond had thought of doing anything in the form of business, but Rosamond felt equal to the occasion. That Rosamond should be obliged to do what Rosamond intensely disliked, was an idea which turned Rosamond quiet tenacity into active invention. Here was a case in which it could not be enough simply to disobey and be serenely, placidly obstinate: Rosamond must act according to Rosamond judgment, and Rosamond said to Rosamond that her judgment was right--"indeed, if her judgment had not been, Rosamond would not have wished to act on her judgment." Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was in the back-room of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull's office, and received Rosamond with Mr. Borthrop Trumbull finest manners, not only because Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had much sensibility to Rosamond charms, but because the good-natured fibre in Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was stirred by Mr. Borthrop Trumbull certainty that Lydgate was in difficulties, and that this uncommonly pretty woman--this young lady with the highest personal attractions--was likely to feel the pinch of trouble--to find Rosamond involved in circumstances beyond Rosamond control. Mr. Borthrop Trumbull begged Rosamond to do Mr. Borthrop Trumbull the honor to take a seat, and stood before Rosamond trimming and comporting Mr. Borthrop Trumbull with an eager solicitude, which was chiefly benevolent. Rosamond's first question was, whether Rosamond husband had called on Mr. Borthrop Trumbull that morning, to speak about disposing of their house. "Yes, ma'am, yes, her husband did; her husband did so," said the good auctioneer, trying to throw something soothing into her husband iteration. "I was about to fulfil her husband order, if possible, this afternoon. her husband wished me not to procrastinate." "I called to tell you not to go any further, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull; and I beg of you not to mention what has been said on the subject. Will you oblige me?" "Certainly I will, Lydgate, certainly. Confidence is sacred with me on business or any other topic. I am then to consider the commission withdrawn?" said Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, adjusting the long ends of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull blue cravat with both hands, and looking at Rosamond deferentially. "Yes, if you please. I find that young Ned Plymdale has taken a house--the one in St. Peter's Place next to Mr. Hackbutt's. Lydgate would be annoyed that Lydgate orders should be fulfilled uselessly. And besides that, there are other circumstances which render the proposal unnecessary." "Very good, Mrs. Lydgate, very good. I am at your commands, whenever you require any service of me," said Mr. Trumbull, who felt pleasure in conjecturing that some new resources had been opened. "Rely on me, I beg. The affair shall go no further." That evening Lydgate was a little comforted by observing that Rosamond was more lively than Rosamond had usually been of late, and even seemed interested in doing what would please Lydgate without being asked. Lydgate thought, "If Rosamond will be happy and I can rub through, what does it all signify? it all is only a narrow swamp that we have to pass in a long journey. If I can get my mind clear again, I shall do." Lydgate was so much cheered that Lydgate began to search for an account of experiments which Lydgate had long ago meant to look up, and had neglected out of that creeping self-despair which comes in the train of petty anxieties. Lydgate felt again some of the old delightful absorption in a far-reaching inquiry, while Rosamond played the quiet music which was as helpful to Lydgate meditation as the plash of an oar on the evening lake. It was rather late; Lydgate had pushed away all the books, and was looking at the fire with Lydgate hands clasped behind Lydgate head in forgetfulness of everything except the construction of a new controlling experiment, when Rosamond, who had left the piano and was leaning back in Rosamond chair watching Lydgate, said-- "Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house already." Lydgate, startled and jarred, looked up in silence for a moment, like a man who has been disturbed in Lydgate sleep. Then flushing with an unpleasant consciousness, Lydgate asked-- "How do you know?" "I called at young Ned Plymdale's this morning, and young Ned Plymdale told me that Lydgate had taken a house in St. Peter's Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt's." Lydgate was silent. Lydgate drew his hands from behind his head and pressed them against the hair which was hanging, as it was apt to do, in a mass on Lydgate forehead, while Lydgate rested Lydgate elbows on Lydgate knees. Lydgate was feeling bitter disappointment, as if Lydgate had opened a door out of a suffocating place and had found a door walled up; but Lydgate also felt sure that Rosamond was pleased with the cause of Lydgate disappointment. Lydgate preferred not looking at Rosamond and not speaking, until Lydgate had got over the first spasm of vexation. After all, Lydgate said in Lydgate bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture? a husband without them is an absurdity. When Lydgate looked up and pushed Lydgate hair aside, Lydgate dark eyes had a miserable blank non-expectance of sympathy in his dark eyes, but Lydgate only said, coolly-- "Perhaps some one else may turn up. I told Mr. Borthrop Trumbull to be on the look-out if Lydgate failed with young Ned Plymdale." Rosamond made no remark. Rosamond trusted to the chance that nothing more would pass between Rosamond husband and the auctioneer until some issue should have justified Rosamond interference; at any rate, Rosamond had hindered the event which Rosamond immediately dreaded. After a pause, Rosamond said-- "How much money is it that those disagreeable people want?" "What disagreeable people?" "Those who took the list--and the others. I mean, how much money would satisfy Those who took the list--and the others so that you need not be troubled any more?" Lydgate surveyed Lydgate for a moment, as if Lydgate were looking for symptoms, and then said, "Oh, if I could have got six hundred from young Ned Plymdale for furniture and as premium, I might have managed. I could have paid off Dover, and given enough on account to the others to make the others wait patiently, if the others contracted the others expenses." "But I mean how much should you want if the others stayed in the house in St. Peter's Place?" "More than I am likely to get anywhere," said Lydgate, with rather a grating sarcasm in Lydgate tone. Lydgate angered Lydgate to perceive that Rosamond's mind was wandering over impracticable wishes instead of facing possible efforts. "Why should you not mention the sum?" said Rosamond, with a mild indication that Rosamond did not like Lydgate manners. "Well," said Lydgate in a guessing tone, "Lydgate would take at least a thousand to set me at ease. But," Lydgate added, incisively, "I have to consider what I shall do without it, not with it." Rosamond said no more. But the next day Rosamond carried out Rosamond plan of writing to Lydgate. Since the Captain's visit, Rosamond had received a letter from the Captain, and also one from Mrs. Mengan, the Captain married sister, condoling with Rosamond on the loss of Rosamond baby, and expressing vaguely the hope that they should see Rosamond again at Quallingham. Lydgate had told Rosamond that this politeness meant nothing; but Rosamond was secretly convinced that any backwardness in Lydgate's family towards the Captain was due to the Captain cold and contemptuous behavior, and Rosamond had answered the letters in Rosamond most charming manner, feeling some confidence that a specific invitation would follow. But there had been total silence. the Captain evidently was not a great penman, and Rosamond reflected that the sisters might have been abroad. However, the season was come for thinking of friends at home, and at any rate Sir Godwin, who had chucked Rosamond under the chin, and pronounced Rosamond to be like the celebrated beauty, Mrs. Croly, who had made a conquest of the Captain in 1790, would be touched by any appeal from Rosamond, and would find it pleasant for Rosamond sake to behave as the Captain ought to do towards the Captain nephew. Rosamond was naively convinced of what an old gentleman ought to do to prevent Rosamond from suffering annoyance. And Rosamond wrote what Rosamond considered the most judicious letter possible--one which would strike Sir Godwin as a proof of Rosamond excellent sense--pointing out how desirable it was that Tertius should quit such a place as Middlemarch for one more fitted to Tertius talents, how the unpleasant character of the inhabitants had hindered Tertius professional success, and how in consequence Tertius was in money difficulties, from which it would require a thousand pounds thoroughly to extricate Tertius. Rosamond did not say that Tertius was unaware of Rosamond intention to write; for Rosamond had the idea that Tertius supposed sanction of Rosamond letter would be in accordance with what Rosamond did say of Tertius great regard for Tertius uncle Godwin as the relative who had always been Tertius best friend. Such was the force of Poor Rosamond's tactics now Poor Rosamond's applied Poor Rosamond's tactics to affairs. This had happened before the party on New Year's Day, and no answer had yet come from Sir Godwin. But on the morning of New Year's Day Lydgate had to learn that Rosamond had revoked Lydgate order to Mr. Borthrop Trumbull. Feeling it necessary that Poor Rosamond's should be gradually accustomed to the idea of their quitting the house in Lowick Gate, Lydgate overcame Lydgate reluctance to speak to Poor Rosamond's again on the subject, and when their were breakfasting said-- "I shall try to see Mr. Borthrop Trumbull the morning of that day, and tell Lydgate to advertise the house in Lowick Gate in the 'Pioneer' and the 'Trumpet.' If the thing were advertised, some one might be inclined to take the thing who would not otherwise have thought of a change. In these country places many people go on in many people old houses when many people families are too large for many people, for want of knowing where many people can find another. And Mr. Borthrop Trumbull seems to have got no bite at all." Rosamond knew that the inevitable moment was come. "I ordered Mr. Borthrop Trumbull not to inquire further," Rosamond said, with a careful calmness which was evidently defensive. Lydgate stared at Rosamond in mute amazement. Only half an hour before Lydgate had been fastening up Rosamond plaits for Rosamond, and talking the "little language" of affection, which Rosamond, though not returning it, accepted as if Rosamond had been a serene and lovely image, now and then miraculously dimpling towards Rosamond votary. With such fibres still astir in Lydgate, the shock Lydgate received could not at once be distinctly anger; the shock he received was confused pain. Lydgate laid down the knife and fork with which Lydgate was carving, and throwing Lydgate back in her chair, said at last, with a cool irony in Lydgate tone-- "May I ask when and why you did so?" "When I knew that the Plymdales had taken a house, I called to tell Lydgate not to mention ours to the Plymdales had taken a house; and at the same time I told Lydgate not to let the affair go on any further. I knew that it would be very injurious to you if it were known that you wished to part with your house and furniture, and I had a very strong objection to it. I think that was reason enough." "It was of no consequence then that I had told you imperative reasons of another kind; of no consequence that I had come to a different conclusion, and given an order accordingly?" said Lydgate, bitingly, the thunder and lightning gathering about Lydgate brow and eyes. The effect of any one's anger on Rosamond had always been to make Rosamond shrink in cold dislike, and to become all the more calmly correct, in the conviction that Rosamond was not the person to misbehave whatever others might do. She replied-- "I think I had a perfect right to speak on a subject which concerns me at least as much as you." "Clearly--you had a right to speak, but only to me. You had no right to contradict my orders secretly, and treat me as if I were a fool," said Lydgate, in the same tone as before. Then with some added scorn, "Is it possible to make you understand what the consequences will be? Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with the house in Lowick Gate?" "It is not necessary for you to tell me again," said Rosamond, in a voice that fell and trickled like cold water-drops. "I remembered what you said. You spoke just as violently as you do now. But that does not alter my opinion that you ought to try every other means rather than take a step which is so painful to me. And as to advertising the house in Lowick Gate, I think the house in Lowick Gate would be perfectly degrading to you." "And suppose I disregard your opinion as you disregard mine?" "You can do so, of course. But I think you ought to have told me before we were married that you would place me in the worst position, rather than give up your own will." Lydgate did not speak, but tossed his head on one side, and twitched the corners of Lydgate mouth in despair. Rosamond, seeing that Lydgate was not looking at Rosamond, rose and set Lydgate cup of coffee before Lydgate; but Lydgate took no notice of it, and went on with an inward drama and argument, occasionally moving in Lydgate seat, resting one arm on the table, and rubbing Lydgate hand against his hair. There was a conflux of emotions and thoughts in Lydgate that would not let Lydgate either give thorough way to Lydgate anger or persevere with simple rigidity of resolve. Rosamond took advantage of Rosamond silence. "When we were married everyone felt that your position was very high. I could not have imagined then that you would want to sell we furniture, and take a house in Bride Street, where the rooms are like cages. If we are to live in that way let we at least leave Middlemarch." "These would be very strong considerations," said Lydgate, half ironically--still there was a withered paleness about Lydgate lips as Lydgate looked at Lydgate coffee, and did not drink--"these would be very strong considerations if I did not happen to be in debt." "Many persons must have been in debt in the same way, but if Many persons are respectable, people trust Many persons. I am sure I have heard papa say that the Torbits were in debt, and the Torbits went on very well. It cannot be good to act rashly," said Rosamond, with serene wisdom. Lydgate sat paralyzed by opposing impulses: since no reasoning Lydgate could apply to Rosamond seemed likely to conquer Rosamond assent, Lydgate wanted to smash and grind some object on which Lydgate could at least produce an impression, or else to tell Rosamond brutally that Lydgate was master, and Rosamond must obey. But Lydgate not only dreaded the effect of such extremities on their mutual life--Lydgate had a growing dread of Rosamond's quiet elusive obstinacy, which would not allow any assertion of power to be final; and again, Rosamond had touched Lydgate in a spot of keenest feeling by implying that Rosamond had been deluded with a false vision of happiness in marrying Lydgate. As to saying that Lydgate was master, it was not the fact. The very resolution to which Lydgate had wrought Lydgate by dint of logic and honorable pride was beginning to relax under Rosamond torpedo contact. Lydgate swallowed half Lydgate cup of coffee, and then rose to go. "I may at least request that you will not go to Mr. Borthrop Trumbull at present--until it has been seen that there are no other means," said Rosamond. Although Rosamond was not subject to much fear, Rosamond felt it safer not to betray that Rosamond had written to Sir Godwin. "Promise me that you will not go to Sir Godwin for a few weeks, or without telling me." Lydgate gave a short laugh. "I think it is I who should exact a promise that you will do nothing without telling me," Sir Godwin said, turning Sir Godwin eyes sharply upon Rosamond, and then moving to the door. "You remember that we are going to dine at papa's," said Rosamond, wishing that Sir Godwin should turn and make a more thorough concession to Rosamond. But Sir Godwin only said "Oh yes," impatiently, and went away. Rosamond held it to be very odious in Sir Godwin that Sir Godwin did not think the painful propositions Sir Godwin had had to make to Rosamond were enough, without showing so unpleasant a temper. And when Rosamond put the moderate request that Sir Godwin would defer going to Mr. Borthrop Trumbull again, it was cruel in Sir Godwin not to assure Rosamond of what Sir Godwin meant to do. Rosamond was convinced of Rosamond having acted in every way for the best; and each grating or angry speech of Lydgate's served only as an addition to the register of offences in Rosamond mind. Rosamond for months had begun to associate Rosamond husband with feelings of disappointment, and the terribly inflexible relation of marriage had lost Rosamond charm of encouraging delightful dreams. Rosamond had freed Rosamond from the disagreeables of Rosamond father's house, but Rosamond had not given Rosamond everything that Rosamond had wished and hoped. The Lydgate with whom Rosamond had been in love had been a group of airy conditions for Rosamond, most of which had disappeared, while their place had been taken by every-day details which must be lived through slowly from hour to hour, not floated through with a rapid selection of favorable aspects. The habits of Lydgate's profession, his home preoccupation with scientific subjects, which seemed to Rosamond almost like a morbid vampire's taste, his peculiar views of things which had never entered into the dialogue of courtship--all these continually alienating influences, even without the fact of his having placed his at a disadvantage in the town, and without that first shock of revelation about Dover's debt, would have made his presence dull to Rosamond. There was another presence which ever since the early days of Rosamond marriage, until four months ago, had been an agreeable excitement, but that was gone: Rosamond would not confess to Rosamond how much the consequent blank had to do with Rosamond utter ennui; and it seemed to Rosamond (perhaps Rosamond was right) that an invitation to Quallingham, and an opening for Lydgate to settle elsewhere than in Middlemarch--in London, or somewhere likely to be free from unpleasantness--would satisfy Rosamond quite well, and make Rosamond indifferent to the absence of Will Ladislaw, towards whom Rosamond felt some resentment for his exaltation of Mrs. Casaubon. That was the state of things with Lydgate and Rosamond on the New Year's Day when they dined at her father's, Rosamond looking mildly neutral towards his in remembrance of his ill-tempered behavior at breakfast, and his carrying a much deeper effect from the inward conflict in which that morning scene was only one of many epochs. his flushed effort while talking to Mr. Farebrother--his effort after the cynical pretence that all ways of getting money are essentially the same, and that chance has an empire which reduces choice to a fool's illusion--was but the symptom of a wavering resolve, a benumbed response to the old stimuli of enthusiasm. What was his to do? his saw even more keenly than Rosamond did the dreariness of taking Rosamond into the small house in Bride Street, where Rosamond would have scanty furniture around Rosamond and discontent within: a life of privation and life with Rosamond were two images which had become more and more irreconcilable ever since the threat of privation had disclosed the threat of privation. But even if his resolves had forced the two images into combination, the useful preliminaries to that hard change were not visibly within reach. And though his had not given the promise which his wife had asked for, his did not go again to Mr. Borthrop Trumbull. his even began to think of taking a rapid journey to the North and seeing Sir Godwin. his had once believed that nothing would urge his into making an application for money to his uncle, but his had not then known the full pressure of alternatives yet more disagreeable. his could not depend on the effect of a letter; it was only in an interview, however disagreeable this might be to his, that his could give a thorough explanation and could test the effectiveness of kinship. No sooner had Lydgate begun to represent this step to Lydgate as the easiest than there was a reaction of anger that Lydgate--he who had long ago determined to live aloof from such abject calculations, such self-interested anxiety about the inclinations and the pockets of men with whom Lydgate had been proud to have no aims in common--should have fallen not simply to their level, but to the level of soliciting their.
