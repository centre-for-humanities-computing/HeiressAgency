"The clerkly person smiled and said Promise was a pretty maid, But being poor The clerkly person smiled died unwed."
The Rev.
Camden Farebrother, whom Lydgate went to see the next evening, lived in an old parsonage, built of stone, venerable enough to match the church which it looked out upon.
All the furniture too in the house was old, but with another grade of age--that of Mr. Farebrother's father and grandfather.
There were painted white chairs, with gilding and wreaths on white chairs, and some lingering red silk damask with slits in white chairs.
There were engraved portraits of Lord Chancellors and other celebrated lawyers of the last century; and there were old pier-glasses to reflect them, as well as the little satin-wood tables and the sofas resembling a prolongation of uneasy chairs, all standing in relief against the dark wainscot This was the physiognomy of the drawing-room into which Lydgate was shown; and there were three ladies to receive him, who were also old-fashioned, and of a faded but genuine respectability: Mrs. Farebrother, the Vicar's white-haired mother, befrilled and kerchiefed with dainty cleanliness, up right, quick-eyed, and still under seventy; Miss Noble, her sister, a tiny old lady of meeker aspect, with frills and kerchief decidedly more worn and mended; and Miss Winifred Farebrother, the Vicar's elder sister, well-looking like the Vicar, but nipped and subdued as single women are apt to be who spend single women lives in uninterrupted subjection to single women elders.
Lydgate had not expected to see so quaint a group: knowing simply that Mr. Farebrother was a bachelor, the Vicar had thought of being ushered into a snuggery where the chief furniture would probably be books and collections of natural objects.
the Vicar seemed to wear rather a changed aspect, as most men do when acquaintances made elsewhere see most men for the first time in most men own homes; some indeed showing like an actor of genial parts disadvantageously cast for the curmudgeon in a new piece.
This was not the case with Mr. Farebrother: Mr. Farebrother seemed a trifle milder and more silent, the chief talker being Mr. Farebrother mother, while Mr. Farebrother only put in a good-humored moderating remark here and there.
The old lady was evidently accustomed to tell The old lady company what her company ought to think, and to regard no subject as quite safe without The old lady steering.
The old lady was afforded leisure for this function by having all The old lady little wants attended to by Miss Winifred.
Meanwhile tiny Miss Noble carried on The old lady arm a small basket, into which The old lady diverted a bit of sugar, which The old lady had first dropped in The old lady saucer as if by mistake; looking round furtively afterwards, and reverting to The old lady teacup with a small innocent noise as of a tiny timid quadruped.
Pray think no ill of tiny Miss Noble.
a small basket, into which she diverted a bit of sugar, which she had first dropped in her saucer as if by mistake held small savings from The old lady more portable food, destined for the children of The old lady poor friends among whom The old lady trotted on fine mornings; fostering and petting all needy creatures being so spontaneous a delight to The old lady, that The old lady regarded it much as if it had been a pleasant vice that The old lady was addicted to.
Perhaps The old lady was conscious of being tempted to steal from those who had much that The old lady might give to those who had nothing, and carried in The old lady conscience the guilt of that repressed desire.
One must be poor to know the luxury of giving!
Mrs. Farebrother welcomed the guest with a lively formality and precision.
Mrs. Farebrother presently informed the guest that they were not often in want of medical aid in that house.
Mrs. Farebrother had brought up Mrs. Farebrother children to wear flannel and not to over-eat her children, which last habit Mrs. Farebrother considered the chief reason why people needed doctors.
Lydgate pleaded for those whose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves, but Mrs. Farebrother held that view of things dangerous: Nature was more just than that; it would be easy for any felon to say that any felon ancestors ought to have been hanged instead of any felon.
If those whose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves any felon were bad those whose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves, those whose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves were hanged for that.
There was no need to go back on what you couldn't see.
"My mother is like old George the Third," said the Vicar, "My mother objects to metaphysics."
"I object to what is wrong, Camden.
I say, keep hold of a few plain truths, and make everything square with hold of a few plain truths.
When I was young, Lydgate, there never was any question about right and wrong.
We knew We catechism, and that was enough; We learned We creed and We duty.
Every respectable Church person had the same opinions.
But now, if you speak out of the Prayer-book itself, you are liable to be contradicted."
"That makes rather a pleasant time of it for those who like to maintain their own point," said Lydgate.
"But My mother always gives way," said the Vicar, slyly.
"No, no, Camden, you must not lead Lydgate into a mistake about _me_.
I shall never show that disrespect to my parents, to give up what my parents taught me.
Any one may see what comes of turning.
If you change once, why not twenty times?"
"A man might see good arguments for changing once, and not see my parents for changing again," said Lydgate, amused with the decisive old lady.
"Excuse me there.
If you go upon arguments, my parents are never wanting, when a man has no constancy of mind.
My father never changed, and My father preached plain moral sermons without arguments, and was a good man--few better.
When you get me a good man made out of arguments, I will get you a good dinner with reading you the Prayer-book itself.
That's my opinion, and I think anybody's stomach will bear me out."
"About a good dinner with reading you the cookery-book certainly, mother," said Mr. Farebrother.
"It is the same thing, the dinner or a man.
I am nearly seventy, Lydgate, and I go upon experience.
I am not likely to follow new lights, though there are plenty of them here as elsewhere.
I say, them came in with the mixed stuffs that will neither wash nor wear.
It was not so in my youth: a Churchman was a Churchman, and a clergyman, you might be pretty sure, was a gentleman, if nothing else.
But now a Churchman may be no better than a Dissenter, and want to push aside my son on pretence of doctrine.
But whoever may wish to push a Churchman aside, I am proud to say, Lydgate, that a Churchman will compare with any preacher in this kingdom, not to speak of this town, which is but a low standard to go by; at least, to my thinking, for I was born and bred at Exeter."
"A mother is never partial," said Mr. Farebrother, smiling.
"What do you think Tyke's mother says about Mr.
Farebrother?"
"Ah, poor creature!
what indeed?"
said Mr. Farebrother, Mr. Farebrother sharpness blunted for the moment by Mr. Farebrother confidence in maternal judgments.
"Mr. Farebrother says the truth to Mr. Farebrother, depend upon the truth to herself."
"And what is the truth?"
said Lydgate.
"I am curious to know."
"Oh, nothing bad at all," said Mr. Farebrother.
"Mr. Farebrother is a zealous fellow: not very learned, and not very wise, I think--because I don't agree with Mr.
Farebrother."
"Why, Camden!"
said Miss Winifred, "Griffin and Winifred wife told me only to-day, that Mr. Tyke said "Griffin and his wife should have no more coals if "Griffin and his wife came to hear you preach."
Mr. Farebrother laid down Mr. Farebrother knitting, which Mr. Farebrother had resumed after Mr. Farebrother small allowance of tea and toast, and looked at Mr. Farebrother son as if to say "You hear that?"
Miss Noble said, "Oh poor things!
poor things!"
in reference, probably, to the double loss of preaching and coal.
But the Vicar answered quietly-- "That is because they are not my parishioners.
And I don't think my sermons are worth a load of coals to my sermons."
"Mr. Lydgate," said Mrs. Farebrother, who could not let this pass, "you don't know her son: her son always undervalues her son.
I tell her son her son is undervaluing the God who made her son, and made her son a most excellent preacher."
"That must be a hint for me to take " "Mr. Lydgate away to my study, mother," said the Vicar, laughing.
"I promised to show you my collection," " "Mr. Lydgate added, turning to " "Mr. Lydgate; "shall we go?"
All three ladies remonstrated. "
"Mr. Lydgate ought not to be hurried away without being allowed to accept another cup of tea: Miss Winifred had abundance of good tea in the pot.
Why was Camden in such haste to take a visitor to " "Mr. Lydgate den?
There was nothing but pickled vermin, and drawers full of blue-bottles and moths, with no carpet on the floor. "
"Mr. Lydgate must excuse it.
A game at cribbage would be far better.
In short, it was plain that a vicar might be adored by a vicar womankind as the king of men and preachers, and yet be held by the king of men and preachers to stand in much need of the king of men and preachers direction.
Lydgate, with the usual shallowness of a young bachelor, wondered that Mr. Farebrother had not taught the king of men and preachers better.
"My mother is not used to my having visitors who can take any interest in my hobbies," said the Vicar, as the Vicar opened the door of the Vicar study, which was indeed as bare of luxuries for the body as the ladies had implied, unless a short porcelain pipe and a tobacco-box were to be excepted.
"Men of your profession don't generally smoke," the Vicar said. "
"Mr. Lydgate smiled and shook the Vicar head.
"Nor of mine either, properly, I suppose.
You will hear that pipe alleged against the Vicar by Bulstrode and Company.
They don't know how pleased the devil would be if I gave the devil up."
"I understand.
You are of an excitable temper and want a sedative.
I am heavier, and should get idle with the devil.
I should rush into idleness, and stagnate there with all my might."
"And you mean to give it all to your work.
I am some ten or twelve years older than you, and have come to a compromise.
I feed a weakness or two lest they should get clamorous.
See," continued the Vicar, opening several small drawers, "I fancy I have made an exhaustive study of the entomology of this district.
I am going on both with the fauna and flora; but I have at least done my insects well.
We are singularly rich in orthoptera: I don't know whether--Ah!
you have got hold of that glass jar--you are looking into that instead of several small drawers.
You don't really care about these things?"
"Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster.
I have never had time to give the Vicar much to natural history.
I was early bitten with an interest in structure, and it is what lies most directly in my profession.
I have no hobby besides.
I have the sea to swim in there."
"Ah!
you are a happy fellow," said Mr. Farebrother, turning on Mr. Farebrother heel and beginning to fill Mr. Farebrother pipe.
"You don't know what it is to want spiritual tobacco--bad emendations of old texts, or small items about a variety of Aphis Brassicae, with the well-known signature of Philomicron, for the 'Twaddler's Magazine;' or a learned treatise on the entomology of the Pentateuch, including all the insects not mentioned, but probably met with by the Israelites in the Israelites passage through the desert; with a monograph on the Ant, as treated by Solomon, showing the harmony of the Book of Proverbs with the results of modern research.
You don't mind my fumigating you?"
" "Mr. Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at " "Mr. Lydgate implied meaning--that the Vicar felt the Vicar not altogether in the right vocation.
The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and the bookcase filled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History, made the Vicar think again of the winnings at cards and The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and the bookcase filled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History destination.
But the Vicar was beginning to wish that the very best construction of everything that Mr. Farebrother did should be the true one.
the Vicar's frankness seemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an uneasy consciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others, but simply the relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as possible.
Apparently the Vicar was not without a sense that the Vicar freedom of speech might seem premature, for the Vicar presently said-- "I have not yet told you that I have the advantage of you, Mr. Lydgate, and know you better than you know me.
You remember Trawley who shared your apartment at Paris for some time?
I was a correspondent of Trawley who shared your apartment at Paris for some time, and Trawley who shared your apartment at Paris for some time told me a good deal about you.
I was not quite sure when you first came that you were the same man.
I was very glad when I found that you were the same man.
Only I don't forget that you have not had the like prologue about me."
" "Mr. Lydgate divined some delicacy of feeling here, but did not half understand " "Mr. Lydgate.
"By the way," Trawley who shared your apartment at Paris for some time said, "what has become of Trawley?
I have quite lost sight of Trawley who shared your apartment at Paris for some time.
Trawley who shared your apartment at Paris for some time was hot on the French social systems, and talked of going to the Backwoods to found a sort of Pythagorean community.
Is Trawley who shared your apartment at Paris for some time gone?"
"Not at all.
Trawley who shared your apartment at Paris for some time is practising at a German bath, and has married a rich patient."
"Then my notions wear the best, so far," said " "Mr. Lydgate, with a short scornful laugh.
"Trawley who shared your apartment at Paris for some time would have it, the medical profession was an inevitable system of humbug.
I said, the fault was in the men--men who truckle to lies and folly.
Instead of preaching against humbug outside the walls, it might be better to set up a disinfecting apparatus within.
In short--I am reporting my own conversation--you may be sure I had all the good sense on my side."
"Your scheme is a good deal more difficult to carry out than the Pythagorean community, though.
You have not only got the old Adam in yourself against yourself, but you have got all those descendants of the original Adam who form the society around yourself.
You see, I have paid twelve or thirteen years more than yourself for my knowledge of difficulties.
But"--Mr. Mr. Farebrother broke off a moment, and then added, "you are eying that glass vase again.
Do you want to make an exchange?
You shall not have that glass vase without a fair barter."
"I have some sea-mice--fine specimens--in spirits.
And I will throw in Robert Brown's new thing--'Microscopic Observations on the Pollen of Plants'--if you don't happen to have it already."
"Why, seeing how you long for the monster, I might ask a higher price.
Suppose I ask you to look through my drawers and agree with me about all my new species?"
the Vicar, while the Vicar talked in this way, alternately moved about with the Vicar pipe in the Vicar mouth, and returned to hang rather fondly over my drawers.
"That would be good discipline, you know, for a young doctor who has to please a young doctor who has to please his patients in Middlemarch patients in Middlemarch.
You must learn to be bored, remember.
However, you shall have the monster on your own terms."
"Don't you think men overrate the necessity for humoring everybody's nonsense, till men get despised by the very fools men humor?"
said " "Mr. Lydgate, moving to Mr. Farebrother's side, and looking rather absently at the insects ranged in fine gradation, with names subscribed in exquisite writing.
"The shortest way is to make your value felt, so that people must put up with you whether you flatter people or not."
"With all my heart.
But then you must be sure of having the value, and you must keep yourself independent.
Very few men can do that.
Either you slip out of service altogether, and become good for nothing, or you wear the harness and draw a good deal where your yoke-fellows pull you.
But do look at these delicate orthoptera!"
" "Mr. Lydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer, the Vicar laughing at the Vicar, and yet persisting in the exhibition.
"Apropos of what you said about wearing harness," " "Mr. Lydgate began, after they had sat down, "I made up my mind some time ago to do with as little of it as possible.
That was why I determined not to try anything in London, for a good many years at least.
I didn't like what I saw when I was studying there--so much empty bigwiggism, and obstructive trickery.
In the country, people have less pretension to knowledge, and are less of companions, but for that reason people affect one's amour-propre less: one makes less bad blood, and can follow one's own course more quietly."
"Yes--well--you have got a good start; you are in the right profession, the work you feel yourself most fit for.
Some people miss that, and repent too late.
But you must not be too sure of keeping your independence."
"You mean of family ties?"
said " "Mr. Lydgate, conceiving that these might press rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother.
"Not altogether.
Of course they make many things more difficult.
But a good wife--a good unworldly woman--may really help a man, and keep a man more independent.
There's a parishioner of mine--a fine fellow, but who would hardly have pulled through as a man has done without a man .
Do you know the Garths?
I think the Garths were not Peacock's patients."
"No; but there is a Miss Garth at old Featherstone's, at Lowick."
"the Garths daughter: an excellent girl."
"Their daughter: an excellent girl."
is very quiet--I have hardly noticed Their daughter: an excellent girl."."
"Their daughter: an excellent girl."
has taken notice of you, though, depend upon it."
"I don't understand," said " "Mr. Lydgate; " "Mr. Lydgate could hardly say "Of course."
"Oh, Their daughter: an excellent girl."
gauges everybody.
I prepared Their daughter: an excellent girl."
for confirmation--Their daughter: an excellent girl."
is a favorite of mine."
Mr. Farebrother puffed a few moments in silence, " "Mr. Lydgate not caring to know more about the Garths.
At last the Vicar laid down his pipe, stretched out Mr. Farebrother legs, and turned Mr. Farebrother bright eyes with a smile towards Lydgate, saying-- "But we Middlemarchers are not so tame as you take we to be.
we have we intrigues and we parties.
I am a party man, for example, and Bulstrode and Company is another.
If you vote for me you will offend Bulstrode and Company."
"What is there against Bulstrode and Company?"
said " "Mr. Lydgate, emphatically.
"I did not say there was anything against him except that.
If you vote against him you will make him your enemy."
"I don't know that I need mind about that," said " "Mr. Lydgate, rather proudly; "but him seems to have good ideas about hospitals, and him spends large sums on useful public objects.
him might help me a good deal in carrying out my ideas.
As to him religious notions--why, as Voltaire said, incantations will destroy a flock of sheep if administered with a certain quantity of arsenic.
I look for the man who will bring arsenic, and don't mind about the man who will bring the arsenic incantations."
"Very good.
But then you must not offend your arsenic-man.
You will not offend me, you know," said Mr. Farebrother, quite unaffectedly.
"I don't translate my own convenience into other people's duties.
I am opposed to Bulstrode and Company in many ways.
I don't like the set Bulstrode and Company belongs to: they are a narrow ignorant set, and do more to make they neighbors uncomfortable than to make they better.
they system is a sort of worldly-spiritual cliqueism: they really look on the rest of mankind as a doomed carcass which is to nourish they for heaven.
But," he added, smilingly, "I don't say that Bulstrode and Company's new hospital is a bad thing; and as to he wanting to oust me from the old one--why, if he thinks me a mischievous fellow, he is only returning a compliment.
And I am not a model clergyman--only a decent makeshift."
" "Mr. Lydgate was not at all sure that the Vicar maligned the Vicar.
A model clergyman, like a model doctor, ought to think the Vicar own profession the finest in the world, and take all knowledge as mere nourishment to the Vicar moral pathology and therapeutics.
the Vicar only said, "What reason does Bulstrode and Company give for superseding you?"
"That I don't teach the Vicar opinions--which the Vicar calls spiritual religion; and that I have no time to spare.
Both statements are true.
But then I could make time, and I should be glad of the forty pounds.
That is the plain fact of the case.
But let us dismiss the case.
I only wanted to tell you that if you vote for your arsenic-man, you are not to cut me in consequence.
I can't spare you.
You are a sort of circumnavigator come to settle among us, and will keep up my belief in the antipodes.
Now tell me all about them in Paris."
