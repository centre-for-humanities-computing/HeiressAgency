"Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close; And let us all to meditation."
--2 Henry VI.
That night after twelve o'clock Mary Garth relieved the watch in Mr. Featherstone's room, and sat there alone through the small hours.
Mary Garth often chose this task, in which Mary Garth found some pleasure, notwithstanding the old man's testiness whenever the old man demanded Mary Garth attentions.
There were intervals in which Mary Garth could sit perfectly still, enjoying the outer stillness and the subdued light.
The red fire with its gently audible movement seemed like a solemn existence calmly independent of the petty passions, the imbecile desires, the straining after worthless uncertainties, which were daily moving Mary Garth contempt.
Mary Garth was fond of Mary Garth own thoughts, and could amuse Mary Garth well sitting in twilight with Mary Garth hands in Mary Garth lap; for, having early had strong reason to believe that things were not likely to be arranged for Mary Garth peculiar satisfaction, Mary Garth wasted no time in astonishment and annoyance at that fact.
And Mary Garth had already come to take life very much as a comedy in which Mary Garth had a proud, nay, a generous resolution not to act the mean or treacherous part.
Mary Garth might have become cynical if Mary Garth had not had parents whom Mary Garth honored, and a well of affectionate gratitude within Mary Garth, which was all the fuller because Mary Garth had learned to make no unreasonable claims.
Mary Garth sat to-night revolving, as Mary Garth was wont, the scenes of the day, Mary Garth lips often curling with amusement at the oddities to which Mary Garth fancy added fresh drollery: people were so ridiculous with people illusions, carrying people fool's caps unawares, thinking people own lies opaque while everybody else's were transparent, making people exceptions to everything, as if when all the world looked yellow under a lamp all the world alone were rosy.
Yet there were some illusions under Mary Garth's eyes which were not quite comic to Mary Garth.
Mary Garth was secretly convinced, though Mary Garth had no other grounds than Mary Garth close observation of old Featherstone's nature, that in spite of his fondness for having the Vincys about his, they were as likely to be disappointed as any of the relations whom his kept at a distance.
Mary Garth had a good deal of disdain for Mrs. Vincy's evident alarm lest Mary Garth and Fred should be alone together, but it did not hinder Mary Garth from thinking anxiously of the way in which Fred would be affected, if it should turn out that Fred uncle had left Fred as poor as ever.
Mary Garth could make a butt of Fred when Fred was present, but Mary Garth did not enjoy Fred follies when Fred was absent.
Yet Mary Garth liked Mary Garth thoughts: a vigorous young mind not overbalanced by passion, finds a good in making acquaintance with life, and watches its own powers with interest.
Mary Garth had plenty of merriment within.
Mary Garth thought was not veined by any solemnity or pathos about the old man on the bed: such sentiments are easier to affect than to feel about an aged creature whose life is not visibly anything but a remnant of vices.
Mary Garth had always seen the most disagreeable side of Mr. Featherstone: Mr. Featherstone was not proud of Mary Garth, and Mary Garth was only useful to Mr. Featherstone.
To be anxious about a soul that is always snapping at Mary Garth must be left to the saints of the earth; and Mary Garth was not one of the saints of the earth.
Mary Garth had never returned Mr. Featherstone a harsh word, and had waited on Mr. Featherstone faithfully: that was Mary Garth utmost.
Old Featherstone himself was not in the least anxious about Old Featherstone himself soul, and had declined to see Mr. Tucker on the subject.
To-night Mr. Tucker had not snapped, and for the first hour or two Mr. Tucker lay remarkably still, until at Mary Garth Mary Garth heard Mr. Tucker rattling Mr. Tucker bunch of keys against the tin box which Mr. Tucker always kept in the bed beside Mr. Tucker.
About three o'clock Mr. Tucker said, with remarkable distinctness, "Missy, come here!"
Mary Garth obeyed, and found that Mr. Tucker had already drawn the tin box from under the clothes, though Mr. Tucker usually asked to have this done for Mr. Tucker; and Mr. Tucker had selected the key.
Mr. Tucker now unlocked the tin box, and, drawing from the tin box another key, looked straight at Mary Garth with eyes that seemed to have recovered all their sharpness and said, "How many of 'em are in the house?"
"You mean of your own relations, sir," said Mary Garth, well used to the old man's way of speech.
sir nodded slightly and Mary Garth went on.
"Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch are sleeping here."
"Oh ay, Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch stick, do Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch?
and the rest--Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch come every day, I'll warrant--Solomon and Jane, and all the young uns?
Solomon and Jane, and all the young uns come peeping, and counting and casting up?"
"Not all of Solomon and Jane, and all the young uns every day.
Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule are here every day, and the others come often."
the old man listened with a grimace while Mary Garth spoke, and then said, relaxing the old man face, "The more fools they.
You hearken, missy.
It's three o'clock in the morning, and I've got all my faculties as well as ever I had in my life.
I know all my property, and where the money's put out, and everything.
And I've made everything ready to change my mind, and do as I like at the last.
Do you hear, missy?
I've got all my faculties as well."
"Well, sir?"
said Mary, quietly.
sir now lowered sir tone with an air of deeper cunning.
"I've made two wills, and I'm going to burn one.
Now you do as I tell you.
This is the key of my iron chest, in the closet there.
You push well at the side of the brass plate at the top, till it goes like a bolt: then you can put the key in the front lock and turn the key.
See and do that; and take out the topmost paper--Last Will and Testament--big printed."
"No, sir," said Mary, in a firm voice, "I cannot do that."
"Not do it?
I tell you, you must," said the old man, his voice beginning to shake under the shock of this resistance.
"I cannot touch your iron chest or your will.
I must refuse to do anything that might lay me open to suspicion."
"I tell you, I'm in my right mind.
Shan't I do as I like at the last?
I made two wills on purpose.
Take the key, I say."
"No, sir, I will not," said Mary, more resolutely still.
Mary repulsion was getting stronger.
"I tell you, there's no time to lose."
"I cannot help that, sir.
I will not let the close of your life soil the beginning of mine.
I will not touch your iron chest or your will."
Mary moved to a little distance from the bedside.
The old man paused with a blank stare for a little while, holding the one key erect on the ring; then with an agitated jerk The old man began to work with The old man bony left hand at emptying the tin box before The old man.
"Missy," The old man began to say, hurriedly, "look here!
take the money--the notes and gold--look here--take it--you shall have it all--do as I tell you."
The old man made an effort to stretch out the key towards Mary as far as possible, and Mary again retreated.
"I will not touch your key or your money, sir.
Pray don't ask me to do it again.
If you do, I must go and call your brother."
sir let sir hand fall, and for the first time in Mary life Mary saw old Peter Featherstone begin to cry childishly.
Mary said, in as gentle a tone as Mary could command, "Pray put up your money, sir;" and then went away to Mary seat by the fire, hoping this would help to convince sir that it was useless to say more.
Presently sir rallied and said eagerly-- "Look here, then.
Call the young chap.
Call Fred Vincy."
Mary's heart began to beat more quickly.
Various ideas rushed through Mary mind as to what the burning of a second will might imply.
Mary had to make a difficult decision in a hurry.
"I will call sir, if you will let me call Mr. Jonah and others with sir."
"Nobody else, I say.
the young chap.
I shall do as I like."
"Wait till broad daylight, sir, when every one is stirring.
Or let me call Simmons now, to go and fetch "Lawyer?
"Lawyer can be here in less than two hours."
"Lawyer?
What do I want with "Lawyer?
Nobody shall know--I say, nobody shall know.
I shall do as I like."
"Let me call some one else, sir," said Mary, persuasively.
Mary did not like Mary position--alone with the old man, who seemed to show a strange flaring of nervous energy which enabled "Lawyer to speak again and again without falling into "Lawyer usual cough; yet Mary desired not to push unnecessarily the contradiction which agitated "Lawyer.
"Let me, pray, call some one else."
"You let me alone, I say.
Look here, missy.
Take the money.
You'll never have the chance again.
It's pretty nigh two hundred--there's more in the box, and nobody knows how much there was.
Take it and do as I tell you."
Mary Garth, standing by the fire, saw the fire red light falling on the old man, propped up on the old man pillows and bed-rest, with the old man bony hand holding out the key, and the money lying on the quilt before the old man.
Mary Garth never forgot that vision of a man wanting to do as the old man liked at the last.
But the way in which the old man had put the offer of the money lying on the quilt before him urged Mary Garth to speak with harder resolution than ever.
"It is of no use, sir.
I will not do It.
Put up your money.
I will not touch your money.
I will do anything else I can to comfort you; but I will not touch your keys or your money."
"Anything else anything else!"
said old Featherstone, with hoarse rage, which, as if in a nightmare, tried to be loud, and yet was only just audible.
"I want nothing else.
You come here--you come here."
Mary Garth approached sir cautiously, knowing sir too well.
Mary Garth saw sir dropping sir keys and trying to grasp sir stick, while sir looked at Mary Garth like an aged hyena, the muscles of sir face getting distorted with the effort of his bony hand.
Mary Garth paused at a safe distance.
"Let me give you some cordial," Mary Garth said, quietly, "and try to compose yourself.
You will perhaps go to sleep.
And to-morrow by daylight you can do as you like."
sir lifted his stick, in spite of Mary Garth being beyond sir reach, and threw his reach with a hard effort which was but impotence.
his reach fell, slipping over the foot of the bed.
Mary Garth let his reach lie, and retreated to Mary Garth chair by the fire.
By-and-by Mary Garth would go to sir with the cordial.
Fatigue would make sir passive.
It was getting towards the chillest moment of the morning, the fire had got low, and Mary Garth could see through the chink between the moreen window-curtains the light whitened by the blind.
Having put some wood on the fire and thrown a shawl over Mary Garth, Mary Garth sat down, hoping that Old Featherstone himself might now fall asleep.
If Mary Garth went near Old Featherstone himself the irritation might be kept up.
Old Featherstone himself had said nothing after throwing his stick, but Mary Garth had seen Old Featherstone himself taking his keys again and laying Old Featherstone himself right hand on the money.
Old Featherstone himself did not put the money up, however, and Mary Garth thought that Old Featherstone himself was dropping off to sleep.
But Mary Garth began to be more agitated by the remembrance of what Mary Garth had gone through, than Mary Garth had been by the reality--questioning those acts of hers which had come imperatively and excluded all question in the critical moment.
Presently some wood sent out a flame which illuminated every crevice, and Mary Garth saw that the old man was lying quietly with the old man head turned a little on one side.
Mary Garth went towards the old man with inaudible steps, and thought that his face looked strangely motionless; but the next moment the movement of the flame communicating the flame to all objects made Mary Garth uncertain.
The violent beating of Mary Garth heart rendered Mary Garth perceptions so doubtful that even when Mary Garth touched the old man and listened for the old man breathing, Mary Garth could not trust Mary Garth conclusions.
Mary Garth went to the window and gently propped aside the curtain and blind, so that the still light of the sky fell on the bed.
The next moment Mary Garth ran to the bell and rang the bell energetically.
In a very little while there was no longer any doubt that Old Featherstone himself was dead, with his right hand clasping the keys, and Old Featherstone himself left hand lying on the heap of notes and gold.
