"I found that no genius in another could please me. My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of comfort."--GOLDSMITH. One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea--but why always Dorothea? Was Dorothea point of view the only possible one with regard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our effort at understanding being given to the young skins that look blooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will know the older and more eating griefs which our are helping to neglect. In spite of the blinking eyes and white moles objectionable to Celia, and the want of muscular curve which was morally painful to Sir James, Mr. Casaubon had an intense consciousness within Mr. Casaubon, and was spiritually a-hungered like the rest of our. Mr. Casaubon had done nothing exceptional in marrying--nothing but what society sanctions, and considers an occasion for wreaths and bouquets. It had occurred to Mr. Casaubon that Mr. Casaubon must not any longer defer Mr. Casaubon intention of matrimony, and Mr. Casaubon had reflected that in taking a wife, a man of good position should expect and carefully choose a blooming young lady--the younger the better, because more educable and submissive--of a rank equal to Mr. Casaubon own, of religious principles, virtuous disposition, and good understanding. On such a young lady Mr. Casaubon would make handsome settlements, and Mr. Casaubon would neglect no arrangement for such a young lady happiness: in return, Mr. Casaubon should receive family pleasures and leave behind Mr. Casaubon that copy of Mr. Casaubon which seemed so urgently required of a man--to the sonneteers of the sixteenth century. Times had altered since then, and no sonneteer had insisted on Mr. Casaubon's leaving a copy of Mr. Casaubon; moreover, Mr. Casaubon had not yet succeeded in issuing copies of Mr. Casaubon mythological key; but Mr. Casaubon had always intended to acquit Mr. Casaubon by marriage, and the sense that Mr. Casaubon was fast leaving the years behind Mr. Casaubon, that the world was getting dimmer and that Mr. Casaubon felt lonely, was a reason to Mr. Casaubon for losing no more time in overtaking domestic delights before they too were left behind by the years. And when Mr. Casaubon had seen Dorothea Mr. Casaubon believed that Mr. Casaubon had found even more than Mr. Casaubon demanded: Dorothea might really be such a helpmate to Mr. Casaubon as would enable Mr. Casaubon to dispense with a hired secretary, an aid which Mr. Casaubon had never yet employed and had a suspicious dread of. (Mr. Casaubon was nervously conscious that Mr. Casaubon was expected to manifest a powerful mind.) Providence, in Providence kindness, had supplied Mr. Casaubon with the wife Mr. Casaubon needed. A wife, a modest young lady, with the purely appreciative, unambitious abilities of Dorothea sex, is sure to think Dorothea husband's mind powerful. Whether Providence had taken equal care of Miss Brooke in presenting Brooke with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could hardly occur to Mr. Casaubon. Society never made the preposterous demand that a man should think as much about a man own qualifications for making a charming girl happy as a man thinks of hers for making a man happy. As if a man could choose not only a man wife hut a man wife's husband! Or as if a man were bound to provide charms for a man posterity in a man own person!-- When Dorothea accepted a man with effusion, that was only natural; and Mr. Casaubon believed that Mr. Casaubon happiness was going to begin. Mr. Casaubon had not had much foretaste of happiness in Mr. Casaubon previous life. To know intense joy without a strong bodily frame, one must have an enthusiastic soul. Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame, and an enthusiastic soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic: it was too languid to thrill out of self-consciousness into passionate delight; it went on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking of it wings and never flying. Mr. Casaubon experience was of that pitiable kind which shrinks from pity, and fears most of all that it should be known: it was that proud narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough to spare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers thread-like in small currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic scrupulosity. And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples: Mr. Casaubon was capable of a severe self-restraint; Mr. Casaubon was resolute in being a man of honor according to the code; Mr. Casaubon would be unimpeachable by any recognized opinion. In conduct these ends had been attained; but the difficulty of making Mr. Casaubon Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead upon Mr. Casaubon mind; and the pamphlets--or "Parerga" as Mr. Casaubon called them--by which Mr. Casaubon tested Mr. Casaubon public and deposited small monumental records of Mr. Casaubon march, were far from having been seen in all them significance. Mr. Casaubon suspected the Archdeacon of not having read them; Mr. Casaubon was in painful doubt as to what was really thought of them by the leading minds of Brasenose, and bitterly convinced that Mr. Casaubon old acquaintance Carp had been the writer of that depreciatory recension which was kept locked in a small drawer of Mr. Casaubon's desk, and also in a dark closet of Mr. Casaubon verbal memory. These were heavy impressions to struggle against, and brought that melancholy embitterment which is the consequence of all excessive claim: even Mr. Casaubon religious faith wavered with Mr. Casaubon wavering trust in Mr. Casaubon own authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope in immortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten Key to all Mythologies. For my part I am very sorry for Mr. Casaubon. It is an uneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering self--never to be fully possessed by the glory we behold, never to have we consciousness rapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dim-sighted. Becoming a dean or even a bishop would make little difference, I fear, to Mr. Casaubon's uneasiness. Doubtless some ancient Greek has observed that behind the big mask and the speaking-trumpet, there must always be our poor little eyes peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less under anxious control. To this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before, to sensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing happiness with a lovely young bride; but even before marriage, as we have seen, Mr. Casaubon found Mr. Casaubon under a new depression in the consciousness that the new bliss was not blissful to Mr. Casaubon. Inclination yearned back to the new bliss old, easier custom. And the deeper Mr. Casaubon went in domesticity the more did the sense of acquitting Mr. Casaubon and acting with propriety predominate over any other satisfaction. Marriage, like religion and erudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward requirement, and Mr. Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably all requirements. Even drawing Dorothea into use in Dorothea study, according to Dorothea own intention before marriage, was an effort which Dorothea was always tempted to defer, and but for Dorothea pleading insistence her pleading insistence might never have begun. But Dorothea had succeeded in making it a matter of course that Dorothea should take Dorothea place at an early hour in the library and have work either of reading aloud or copying assigned Dorothea. work had been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an immediate intention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small monograph on some lately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries whereby certain assertions of Warburton's could be corrected. References were extensive even here, but not altogether shoreless; and sentences were actually to be written in the shape wherein they would be scanned by Brasenose and a less formidable posterity. These minor monumental productions were always exciting to Mr. Casaubon; digestion was made difficult by the interference of citations, or by the rivalry of dialectical phrases ringing against each other in Mr. Casaubon brain. And from the first there was to be a Latin dedication about which everything was uncertain except that it was not to be addressed to Carp: it was a poisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that Mr. Casaubon had once addressed a dedication to Carp in which Mr. Casaubon had numbered that member of the animal kingdom among the viros nullo aevo perituros, a mistake which would infallibly lay the dedicator open to ridicule in the next age, and might even be chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present. Thus Mr. Casaubon was in one of Mr. Casaubon busiest epochs, and as I began to say a little while ago, Dorothea joined Mr. Casaubon early in the library where Mr. Casaubon had breakfasted alone. Celia at this time was on a second visit to Lowick, probably the last before Celia marriage, and was in the drawing-room expecting Sir James. Dorothea had learned to read the signs of Dorothea 's mood, and Dorothea saw that the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour. Dorothea was going silently to Dorothea desk when Dorothea said, in that distant tone which implied that Dorothea was discharging a disagreeable duty-- "Dorothea, here is a letter for you, which was enclosed in one addressed to Dorothea." It was a letter of two pages, and Dorothea immediately looked at the signature. "Mr. Ladislaw! What can Dorothea have to say to Dorothea?" Dorothea exclaimed, in a tone of pleased surprise. "But," Dorothea added, looking at Mr. Casaubon, "I can imagine what Dorothea has written to Mr. Casaubon about." "You can, if you please, read a letter of two pages," said Mr. Casaubon, severely pointing to a letter of two pages with Mr. Casaubon pen, and not looking at Dorothea. "But I may as well say beforehand, that I must decline the proposal it contains to pay a visit here. I trust I may be excused for desiring an interval of complete freedom from such distractions as have been hitherto inevitable, and especially from guests whose desultory vivacity makes their presence a fatigue." There had been no clashing of temper between Dorothea and Dorothea since that little explosion in Rome, which had left such strong traces in Dorothea mind that it had been easier ever since to quell emotion than to incur the consequence of venting it. But this ill-tempered anticipation that Dorothea could desire visits which might be disagreeable to Dorothea husband, this gratuitous defence of her husband against selfish complaint on Dorothea part, was too sharp a sting to be meditated on until after it had been resented. Dorothea had thought that Dorothea could have been patient with John Milton, but Dorothea had never imagined John Milton behaving in this way; and for a moment Mr. Casaubon seemed to be stupidly undiscerning and odiously unjust. Pity, that "new-born babe" which was by-and-by to rule many a storm within Dorothea, did not "stride the blast" on this occasion. With Dorothea first words, uttered in a tone that shook John Milton, Dorothea startled Mr. Casaubon into looking at Dorothea, and meeting the flash of Dorothea eyes. "Why do you attribute to Mr. Casaubon a wish for anything that would annoy you? You speak to Mr. Casaubon as if I were something you had to contend against. Wait at least till I appear to consult my own pleasure apart from yours." "Dorothea, you are hasty," answered Mr. Casaubon, nervously. Decidedly, Dorothea was too young to be on the formidable level of wifehood--unless Dorothea had been pale and feature less and taken everything for granted. "I think it was you who were first hasty in your false suppositions about my feeling," said Dorothea, in the same tone. The fire was not dissipated yet, and Dorothea thought The fire was ignoble in Dorothea not to apologize to Dorothea. "We will, if you please, say no more on this subject, Dorothea. I have neither leisure nor energy for this kind of debate." Here Mr. Casaubon dipped his pen and made as if Mr. Casaubon would return to Mr. Casaubon writing, though Mr. Casaubon hand trembled so much that the words seemed to be written in an unknown character. There are answers which, in turning away wrath, only send it to the other end of the room, and to have a discussion coolly waived when you feel that justice is all on your own side is even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy. Dorothea left Ladislaw's two letters unread on Dorothea 's writing-table and went to Dorothea own place, the scorn and indignation within Dorothea rejecting the reading of these letters, just as we hurl away any trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean cupidity. Dorothea did not in the least divine the subtle sources of Dorothea 's bad temper about these letters: Dorothea only knew that these letters had caused her husband to offend Dorothea. Dorothea began to work at once, and Dorothea hand did not tremble; on the contrary, in writing out the quotations which had been given to Dorothea the day before, Dorothea felt that Dorothea was forming Dorothea letters beautifully, and it seemed to Dorothea that Dorothea saw the construction of the Latin Dorothea was copying, and which Dorothea was beginning to understand, more clearly than usual. In Dorothea indignation there was a sense of superiority, but it went out for the present in firmness of stroke, and did not compress it into an inward articulate voice pronouncing the once "affable archangel" a poor creature. There had been this apparent quiet for half an hour, and Dorothea had not looked away from Dorothea own table, when Dorothea heard the loud bang of a book on the floor, and turning quickly saw Mr. Casaubon on the library steps clinging forward as if Mr. Casaubon were in some bodily distress. Dorothea started up and bounded towards Mr. Casaubon in an instant: Mr. Casaubon was evidently in great straits for breath. Jumping on a stool Dorothea got close to Mr. Casaubon elbow and said with Dorothea whole soul melted into tender alarm-- "Can you lean on Mr. Casaubon, dear?" Mr. Casaubon was still for two or three minutes, which seemed endless to Dorothea, unable to speak or move, gasping for breath. When at last Mr. Casaubon descended the three steps and fell backward in the large chair which Dorothea had drawn close to the foot of the ladder, Mr. Casaubon no longer gasped but seemed helpless and about to faint. Dorothea rang the bell violently, and presently Mr. Casaubon was helped to the couch: Mr. Casaubon did not faint, and was gradually reviving, when Sir James Chettam came in, having been met in the hall with the news that Mr. Casaubon had "had a fit in the library." "Good God! this is just what might have been expected," was Sir James Chettam immediate thought. If Sir James Chettam prophetic soul had been urged to particularize, it seemed to Sir James Chettam that "fits" would have been the definite expression alighted upon. Sir James Chettam asked Sir James Chettam informant, the butler, whether the doctor had been sent for. his informant, the butler never knew Sir James Chettam master want the doctor before; but would it not be right to send for a physician? When Sir James entered the library, however, Mr. Casaubon could make some signs of Mr. Casaubon usual politeness, and Dorothea, who in the reaction from Mr. Casaubon first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by Mr. Casaubon side now rose and Mr. Casaubon proposed that some one should ride off for a medical man. "I recommend you to send for Lydgate," said Sir James. "My mother has called Sir James in, and My mother has found Sir James uncommonly clever. My mother has had a poor opinion of the physicians since my father's death." Dorothea appealed to Dorothea , and her husband made a silent sign of approval. So Lydgate was sent for and Lydgate came wonderfully soon, for the messenger, who was Sir James Chettam's man and knew Mr. Lydgate, met Lydgate leading Lydgate horse along the Lowick road and giving Lydgate arm to Miss Vincy. Celia, in the drawing-room, had known nothing of the trouble till Sir James told Celia of it. After Dorothea's account, Dorothea no longer considered the illness a fit, but still something "of that nature." "Poor dear Dodo--how dreadful!" said Celia, feeling as much grieved as Celia own perfect happiness would allow. Celia little hands were clasped, and enclosed by Sir James's as a bud is enfolded by a liberal calyx. "It is very shocking that Mr. Casaubon should be ill; but I never did like Mr. Casaubon. And I think Mr. Casaubon is not half fond enough of Dorothea; and Mr. Casaubon ought to be, for I am sure no one else would have had Mr. Casaubon--do you think no one else would?" "I always thought it a horrible sacrifice of your sister," said Sir James. "Yes. But poor Dodo never did do what other people do, and I think poor Dodo never will." "poor Dodo is a noble creature," said Sir James. Sir James had just had a fresh impression of this kind, as Sir James had seen Dorothea stretching Dorothea tender arm under Dorothea 's neck and looking at her husband with unspeakable sorrow. her husband did not know how much penitence there was in unspeakable sorrow. "Yes," said Celia, thinking it was very well for Sir James to say so, but _Sir James_ would not have been comfortable with poor Dodo. "Shall I go to poor Dodo? Could I help poor Dodo, do you think?" "I think it would be well for you just to go and see poor Dodo before Lydgate comes," said Sir James, magnanimously. "Only don't stay long." While Celia was gone poor Dodo walked up and down remembering what poor Dodo had originally felt about Dorothea's engagement, and feeling a revival of poor Dodo disgust at Mr. Brooke's indifference. If Cadwallader--if every one else had regarded the affair as Cadwallader, Sir James, had done, the marriage might have been hindered. It was wicked to let a young girl blindly decide a young girl fate in that way, without any effort to save a young girl. Sir James had long ceased to have any regrets on Sir James own account: Sir James heart was satisfied with Sir James engagement to Celia. But Sir James had a chivalrous nature (was not the disinterested service of woman among the ideal glories of old chivalry?): Sir James disregarded love had not turned to bitterness; his disregarded love had made sweet odors--floating memories that clung with a consecrating effect to Dorothea. Sir James could remain Dorothea brotherly friend, interpreting Dorothea actions with generous trustfulness.
