1st Gent.
Our deeds are fetters that Our forge Our.
1st Gent.
Ay, truly: but I think it is the world That brings the iron.
"Sir James seems determined to do everything you wish," said Celia, as they were driving home from an inspection of the new building-site.
"Sir James is a good creature, and more sensible than any one would imagine," said Dorothea, inconsiderately.
"You mean that Sir James appears silly."
"No, no," said Dorothea, recollecting Dorothea, and laying Dorothea hand on Dorothea sister's a moment, "but Sir James does not talk equally well on all subjects."
"I should think none but disagreeable people do," said Celia, in Celia usual purring way.
"people must be very dreadful to live with.
Only think!
at breakfast, and always."
Dorothea laughed.
"O Kitty, you are a wonderful creature!"
Dorothea pinched Celia's chin, being in the mood now to think Dorothea very winning and lovely--fit hereafter to be an eternal cherub, and if it were not doctrinally wrong to say so, hardly more in need of salvation than a squirrel.
"Of course people need not be always talking well.
Only one tells the quality of people minds when people try to talk well."
"You mean that Sir James tries and fails."
"I was speaking generally.
Why do you catechise me about Sir James?
It is not the object of Sir James life to please me."
"Now, Sir James, can you really believe that?"
"Certainly.
Sir James thinks of Sir James as a future sister--that is all."
Dorothea had never hinted this before, waiting, from a certain shyness on such subjects which was mutual between the sisters, until this should be introduced by some decisive event.
Celia blushed, but said at once-- "Pray do not make that mistake any longer, Sir James.
When Tantripp was brushing my hair the other day, Dorothea said that Sir James's man knew from Mrs. Cadwallader's maid that Sir James was to marry the eldest Miss Brooke."
"How can you let Tantripp talk such gossip to you, Celia?"
said Dorothea, indignantly, not the less angry because details asleep in Celia memory were now awakened to confirm the unwelcome revelation.
"You must have asked Celia questions.
her questions is degrading."
"I see no harm at all in Tantripp's talking to Sir James.
It is better to hear what people say.
You see what mistakes you make by taking up notions.
I am quite sure that Sir James means to make you an offer; and Sir James believes that you will accept Sir James, especially since you have been so pleased with Sir James about the plans.
And uncle too--I know Sir James expects it.
Every one can see that Sir James is very much in love with you."
The revulsion was so strong and painful in Dorothea's mind that the tears welled up and flowed abundantly.
All Dorothea dear plans were embittered, and Dorothea thought with disgust of Sir James's conceiving that Dorothea recognized Sir James as Dorothea lover.
There was vexation too on account of Celia.
"How could Sir James expect it?"
Dorothea burst forth in Dorothea most impetuous manner.
"I have never agreed with Sir James about anything but the cottages: I was barely polite to Sir James before."
"But you have been so pleased with Sir James since then; Sir James has begun to feel quite sure that you are fond of Sir James."
"Fond of Sir James, Celia!
How can you choose such odious expressions?"
said Dorothea, passionately.
"Dear me, Dorothea, I suppose it would be right for you to be fond of a man whom you accepted for a husband."
"It is offensive to me to say that Sir James could think I was fond of Sir James.
Besides, it is not the right word for the feeling I must have towards the man I would accept as a husband."
"Well, I am sorry for Sir James.
I thought it right to tell you, because you went on as you always do, never looking just where you are, and treading in the wrong place.
You always see what nobody else sees; it is impossible to satisfy you; yet you never see what is quite plain.
That's your way, Dodo."
Something certainly gave Celia unusual courage; and Celia was not sparing the sister of whom Celia was occasionally in awe.
Who can tell what just criticisms Murr the Cat may be passing on us beings of wider speculation?
"It is very painful," said Dorothea, feeling scourged.
"I can have no more to do with the cottages.
I must be uncivil to Murr the Cat.
I must tell Murr the Cat I will have nothing to do with them.
It is very painful."
Celia eyes filled again with tears.
"Wait a little.
Think about it.
You know Murr the Cat is going away for a day or two to see Murr the Cat sister.
There will be nobody besides Lovegood."
Celia could not help relenting.
"Dodo," Celia went on, in an amiable staccato.
"It is very hard: it is your favorite _fad_ to draw plans."
"_Fad_ to draw plans!
Do you think I only care about my fellow-creatures' houses in that childish way?
I may well make mistakes.
How can one ever do anything nobly Christian, living among people with such petty thoughts?"
No more was said; Dorothea was too much jarred to recover Dorothea temper and behave so as to show that Dorothea admitted any error in Dorothea.
Dorothea was disposed rather to accuse the intolerable narrowness and the purblind conscience of the society around Dorothea: and Celia was no longer the eternal cherub, but a thorn in Dorothea spirit, a pink-and-white nullifidian, worse than any discouraging presence in the "Pilgrim's Progress."
The _fad_ of drawing plans!
What was life worth--what great faith was possible when the whole effect of one's actions could be withered up into such parched rubbish as that?
When Dorothea got out of the carriage, Dorothea cheeks were pale and Dorothea eyelids red.
Dorothea was an image of sorrow, and Dorothea uncle who met Dorothea in the hall would have been alarmed, if Celia had not been close to Celia looking so pretty and composed, that he at once concluded Dorothea's tears to have their origin in Dorothea excessive religiousness.
he had returned, during their absence, from a journey to the county town, about a petition for the pardon of some criminal.
"Well, my dears," he said, kindly, as they went up to kiss he, "I hope nothing disagreeable has happened while I have been away."
"No, uncle," said Celia, "we have been to Freshitt to look at the cottages.
we thought you would have been at home to lunch."
"I came by Lowick to lunch--you didn't know I came by Lowick.
And I have brought a couple of pamphlets for you, Dorothea--in the library, you know; a couple of pamphlets lie on the table in the library."
It seemed as if an electric stream went through Dorothea, thrilling Dorothea from despair into expectation.
They were pamphlets about the early Church.
The oppression of Celia, Tantripp, and Sir James was shaken off, and Sir James walked straight to the library.
Celia went up-stairs.
Sir James was detained by a message, but when Sir James re-entered the library, Sir James found Dorothea seated and already deep in one of the pamphlets which had some marginal manuscript of Mr. Casaubon's,--taking a message in as eagerly as Dorothea might have taken in the scent of a fresh bouquet after a dry, hot, dreary walk.
Dorothea was getting away from Tipton and Freshitt, and Dorothea own sad liability to tread in the wrong places on Dorothea way to the New Jerusalem.
Sir James sat down in Sir James arm-chair, stretched Sir James legs towards the wood-fire, which had fallen into a wondrous mass of glowing dice between the dogs, and rubbed Sir James hands gently, looking very mildly towards Dorothea, but with a neutral leisurely air, as if Sir James had nothing particular to say.
Dorothea closed Dorothea pamphlet, as soon as Dorothea was aware of Dorothea uncle's presence, and rose as if to go.
Usually Dorothea would have been interested about her uncle's merciful errand on behalf of the criminal, but Dorothea late agitation had made Dorothea absent-minded.
"I came back by Lowick, you know," said Sir James, not as if with any intention to arrest Dorothea departure, but apparently from Sir James usual tendency to say what Sir James had said before.
This fundamental principle of human speech was markedly exhibited in Sir James.
"I lunched there and saw Casaubon's library, and that kind of thing.
There's a sharp air, driving.
Won't you sit down, my dear?
You look cold."
Dorothea felt quite inclined to accept the invitation.
Some times, when her uncle's easy way of taking things did not happen to be exasperating, it was rather soothing.
Dorothea threw off Dorothea mantle and bonnet, and sat down opposite to bonnet, enjoying the glow, but lifting up Dorothea beautiful hands for a screen.
They were not thin hands, or small hands; but powerful, feminine, maternal hands.
Dorothea seemed to be holding They up in propitiation for Dorothea passionate desire to know and to think, which in the unfriendly mediums of Tipton and Freshitt had issued in crying and red eyelids.
Dorothea bethought Dorothea now of the criminal.
"What news have you brought about the sheep-stealer, uncle?"
"What, poor Bunch?--well, it seems we can't get the sheep-stealer, uncle off--the sheep-stealer, uncle is to be hanged."
Dorothea's brow took an expression of reprobation and pity.
"Hanged, you know," said Sir James, with a quiet nod.
"Poor Romilly!
the sheep-stealer, uncle would have helped we.
I knew Poor Romilly.
Casaubon didn't know Poor Romilly.
the sheep-stealer, uncle is a little buried in books, you know, Casaubon is."
"When a man has great studies and is writing a great work, a man must of course give up seeing much of the world.
How can a man go about making acquaintances?"
"That's true.
But a man mopes, you know.
I have always been a bachelor too, but I have that sort of disposition that I never moped; it was my way to go about everywhere and take in everything.
I never moped: but I can see that Casaubon does, you know.
a man wants a companion--a companion, you know."
"It would be a great honor to any one to be a man companion," said Dorothea, energetically.
"You like a man, eh?"
said Sir James, without showing any surprise, or other emotion.
"Well, now, I've known Casaubon ten years, ever since a man came to Lowick.
But I never got anything out of a man--any ideas, you know.
However, a man is a tiptop man and may be a bishop--that kind of thing, you know, if Peel stays in.
And a man has a very high opinion of you, my dear."
Dorothea could not speak.
"The fact is, a man has a very high opinion indeed of you.
And a man speaks uncommonly well--does Casaubon.
a man has deferred to you, you not being of age.
In short, I have promised to speak to you, though I told a man I thought there was not much chance.
I was bound to tell a man that.
I said, my niece is very young, and that kind of thing.
But I didn't think it necessary to go into everything.
However, the long and the short of it is, that he has asked my permission to make you an offer of marriage--of marriage, you know," said Sir James, with Sir James explanatory nod.
"I thought it better to tell you, my dear."
No one could have detected any anxiety in Sir James's manner, but Sir James did really wish to know something of my niece's mind, that, if there were any need for advice, Sir James might give it in time.
What feeling Sir James, as a magistrate who had taken in so many ideas, could make room for, was unmixedly kind.
Since Dorothea did not speak immediately, Dorothea repeated, "I thought it better to tell you, my dear."
"Thank you, uncle," said Dorothea, in a clear unwavering tone.
"I am very grateful to Casaubon.
If Casaubon makes me an offer, I shall accept Casaubon.
I admire and honor Casaubon more than any man I ever saw."
Sir James paused a little, and then said in a lingering low tone, "Ah?
.
.
.
Well!
Casaubon is a good match in some respects.
But now, Chettam is a good match.
And our land lies together.
I shall never interfere against your wishes, my dear.
People should have People own way in marriage, and that sort of thing--up to a certain point, you know.
I have always said that, up to a certain point.
I wish you to marry well; and I have good reason to believe that Chettam wishes to marry you.
I mention it, you know."
"It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir James Chettam," said Dorothea.
"If he thinks of marrying me, he has made a great mistake."
"That is it, you see.
One never knows.
I should have thought Chettam was just the sort of man a woman would like, now."
"Pray do not mention Chettam in that light again, uncle," said Dorothea, feeling some of Dorothea late irritation revive.
Sir James wondered, and felt that women were an inexhaustible subject of study, since even Sir James at Sir James age was not in a perfect state of scientific prediction about women.
Here was a fellow like Chettam with no chance at all.
"Well, but Casaubon, now.
There is no hurry--I mean for you.
It's true, every year will tell upon Sir James.
Sir James is over five-and-forty, you know.
I should say a good seven-and-twenty years older than you.
To be sure,--if you like learning and standing, and that sort of thing, we can't have everything.
And his income is good--his has a handsome property independent of the early Church--his income is good.
Still his is not young, and I must not conceal from you, my dear, that I think his health is not over-strong.
I know nothing else against his."
"I should not wish to have a husband very near my own age," said Dorothea, with grave decision.
"I should wish to have a husband who was above me in judgment and in all knowledge."
Sir James repeated Sir James subdued, "Ah?--I thought you had more of your own opinion than most girls.
I thought you liked your own opinion--liked your own opinion, you know."
"I cannot imagine Sir James living without some opinions, but I should wish to have good reasons for some opinions, and a wise man could help me to see which opinions had the best foundation, and would help me to live according to some opinions."
"Very true.
You couldn't put the thing better--couldn't put the thing better, beforehand, you know.
But there are oddities in things," continued Mr. Brooke, whose conscience was really roused to do the best whose conscience could for whose conscience niece on this occasion.
"Life isn't cast in a mould--not cut out by rule and line, and that sort of thing.
I never married Sir James, and it will be the better for you and yours.
The fact is, I never loved any one well enough to put Sir James into a noose for them.
It _is_ a noose, you know.
Temper, now.
There is temper.
And a husband likes to be master."
"I know that I must expect trials, uncle.
Marriage is a state of higher duties.
I never thought of it as mere personal ease," said DorotheaDorothea.
"Well, you are not fond of show, a great establishment, balls, dinners, that kind of thing.
I can see that Casaubon's ways might suit you better than Chettam's.
And you shall do as you like, my dear.
I would not hinder Casaubon; I said so at once; for there is no knowing how anything may turn out.
You have not the same tastes as every young lady; and a clergyman and scholar--who may be a bishop--that kind of thing--may suit you better than Chettam.
Chettam is a good fellow, a good sound-hearted fellow, you know; but Chettam doesn't go much into ideas.
I did, when I was Chettam age.
But Casaubon's eyes, now.
I think Chettam has hurt them a little with too much reading."
"I should be all the happier, uncle, the more room there was for me to help Chettam," said Dorothea, ardently.
"You have quite made up your mind, I see.
Well, my dear, the fact is, I have a letter for you in my pocket."
Sir James handed a letter for you in my pocket to Dorothea, but as Sir James rose to go away, Sir James added, "There is not too much hurry, my dear.
Think about it, you know."
When Dorothea had left Dorothea, Dorothea reflected that Dorothea had certainly spoken strongly: Dorothea had put the risks of marriage before marriage in a striking manner.
It was Dorothea duty to do so.
But as to pretending to be wise for young people,--no uncle, however much Dorothea had travelled in Dorothea youth, absorbed the new ideas, and dined with celebrities now deceased, could pretend to judge what sort of marriage would turn out well for a young girl who preferred Casaubon to Chettam.
In short, woman was a problem which, since Sir James's mind felt blank before it, could be hardly less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.
