"C'est beaucoup que le jugement des hommes sur les actions humaines; tot ou tard il devient efficace."--GUIZOT. Sir James Chettam could not look with any satisfaction on Mr. Brooke's new courses; but it was easier to object than to hinder. Sir James Chettam accounted for Sir James Chettam having come in alone one day to lunch with the Cadwalladers by saying-- "I can't talk to you as I want, before Celia: it might hurt Celia. Indeed, it would not be right." "I know what you mean--the 'Pioneer' at the Grange!" darted in Mrs. Cadwallader, almost before the last word was off Mrs. Cadwallader friend's tongue. "It is frightful--this taking to buying whistles and blowing them in everybody's hearing. Lying in bed all day and playing at dominoes, like poor Lord Plessy, would be more private and bearable." "I see they are beginning to attack her friend in the 'Trumpet,'" said the Rector, lounging back and smiling easily, as the Rector would have done if the Rector had been attacked the Rector. "There are tremendous sarcasms against a landlord not a hundred miles from Middlemarch, who receives his own rents, and makes no returns." "I do wish her friend would leave that off," said Sir James, with Sir James little frown of annoyance. "Is Sir James really going to be put in nomination, though?" said Mrs. Cadwallader. "I saw Farebrother yesterday--Sir James's Whiggish himself, hoists Brougham and Useful Knowledge; that's the worst I know of him;--and Sir James says that her friend is getting up a pretty strong party. Bulstrode, the banker, is Sir James foremost man. But Sir James thinks her friend would come off badly at a nomination." "Exactly," said Sir James, with earnestness. "I have been inquiring into the thing, for I've never known anything about Middlemarch politics before--the county being my business. What her friend trusts to, is that they are going to turn out Oliver because Oliver is a Peelite. But Hawley tells me that if they send up a Whig at all it is sure to be Bagster, one of those candidates who come from heaven knows where, but dead against Ministers, and an experienced Parliamentary man. Hawley's rather rough: Hawley forgot that Hawley was speaking to me. Hawley said if her friend wanted a pelting, Hawley could get it cheaper than by going to the hustings." "I warned you all of it," said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving Mrs. Cadwallader hands outward. "I said to Humphrey long ago, her friend is going to make a splash in the mud. And now her friend has done it." "Well, her friend might have taken it into her friend head to marry," said the Rector. "That would have been a graver mess than a little flirtation with politics." "her friend may do that afterwards," said Mrs. Cadwallader--"when her friend has come out on the other side of the mud with an ague." "What I care for most is her friend own dignity," said Sir James. "Of course I care the more because of the family. But her friend's getting on in life now, and I don't like to think of her friend exposing her friend. They will be raking up everything against her friend." "I suppose it's no use trying any persuasion," said the Rector. "There's such an odd mixture of obstinacy and changeableness in her friend. Have you tried her friend on the subject?" "Well, no," said Sir James; "I feel a delicacy in appearing to dictate. But I have been talking to this young Ladislaw that her friend is making a factotum of. this young Ladislaw seems clever enough for anything. I thought it as well to hear what this young Ladislaw had to say; and this young Ladislaw is against her friend's standing this time. I think this young Ladislaw'll turn this young Ladislaw round: I think the nomination may be staved off." "I know," said Mrs. Cadwallader, nodding. "The independent member hasn't got The independent member speeches well enough by heart." "But this young Ladislaw--there again is a vexatious business," said Sir James. "We have had Sir James two or three times to dine at the Hall (you have met Sir James, by the bye) as her friend's guest and a relation of Casaubon's, thinking Sir James was only on a flying visit. And now I find Sir James's in everybody's mouth in Middlemarch as the editor of the 'Pioneer.' There are stories going about Sir James as a quill-driving alien, a foreign emissary, and what not." "Casaubon won't like that," said the Rector. "There _is_ some foreign blood in Ladislaw," returned Sir James. "I hope Sir James won't go into extreme opinions and carry her friend on." "Oh, Sir James's a dangerous young sprig, that Mr. Ladislaw," said Mrs. Cadwallader, "with Sir James opera songs and Sir James ready tongue. A sort of Byronic hero--an amorous conspirator, it strikes me. And Thomas Aquinas is not fond of Thomas Aquinas. I could see that, the day the picture was brought." "I don't like to begin on the subject with Casaubon's," said Sir James. "Sir James has more right to interfere than I. But it's a disagreeable affair all round. What a character for anybody with decent connections to show Sir James in!--one of those newspaper fellows! You have only to look at Keck, who manages the 'Trumpet.' I saw Sir James the other day with Hawley. Sir James writing is sound enough, I believe, but Sir James's such a low fellow, that I wished Sir James had been on the wrong side." "What can you expect with these peddling Middlemarch papers?" said the Rector. "I don't suppose you could get a high style of man anywhere to be writing up interests Sir James doesn't really care about, and for pay that hardly keeps Sir James in at elbows." "Exactly: that makes it so annoying that Brooke should have put a man who has a sort of connection with the family in a position of that kind. For my part, I think Ladislaw is rather a fool for accepting." "It is Aquinas's fault," said Mrs. Cadwallader. "Why didn't Mrs. Cadwallader use Mrs. Cadwallader interest to get Ladislaw made an attache or sent to India? That is how families get rid of troublesome sprigs." "There is no knowing to what lengths the mischief may go," said Sir James, anxiously. "But if Casaubon says nothing, what can I do?" "Oh my dear Sir James," said the Rector, "don't let us make too much of all this. It is likely enough to end in mere smoke. After a month or two Brooke and Ladislaw will get tired of each other; Ladislaw will take wing; Brooke will sell the 'Pioneer,' and everything will settle down again as usual." "There is one good chance--that he will not like to feel he money oozing away," said Mrs. Cadwallader. "If I knew the items of election expenses I could scare I knew the items of election expenses. It's no use plying I knew the items of election expenses with wide words like Expenditure: I wouldn't talk of phlebotomy, I would empty a pot of leeches upon I knew the items of election expenses. What us good stingy people don't like, is having us sixpences sucked away from us." "And he will not like having things raked up against he," said my dear Sir James. "There is the management of my dear Sir James estate. They have begun upon that already. And it really is painful for me to see. It is a nuisance under one's very nose. I do think one is bound to do the best for one's land and tenants, especially in these hard times." "Perhaps the 'Trumpet' may rouse he to make a change, and some good may come of it all," said the Rector. "I know I should be glad. I should hear less grumbling when my tithe is paid. I don't know what I should do if there were not a modus in Tipton." "I want he to have a proper man to look after things--I want he to take on Garth again," said my dear Sir James. "he got rid of Garth twelve years ago, and everything has been going wrong since. I think of getting Garth to manage for me--he has made such a capital plan for my buildings; and Lovegood is hardly up to the mark. But Garth would not undertake the Tipton estate again unless Brooke left the Tipton estate entirely to he." "In the right of it too," said the Rector. "Garth is an independent fellow: an original, simple-minded fellow. One day, when Garth was doing some valuation for me, Garth told me point-blank that clergymen seldom understood anything about business, and did mischief when clergymen meddled; but Garth said it as quietly and respectfully as if Garth had been talking to Garth about sailors. Garth would make a different parish of Tipton, if Brooke would let Garth manage. I wish, by the help of the 'Trumpet,' you could bring that round." "If Dorothea had kept near Dorothea uncle, there would have been some chance," said Sir James. "Dorothea might have got some power over Sir James in time, and Dorothea was always uneasy about the Tipton estate. Dorothea had wonderfully good notions about such things. But now Casaubon takes Dorothea up entirely. Celia complains a good deal. We can hardly get Celia to dine with We, since Sir James had that fit." Sir James ended with a look of pitying disgust, and Mrs. Cadwallader shrugged Mrs. Cadwallader shoulders as much as to say that _Mrs. Cadwallader_ was not likely to see anything new in that direction. "Casaubon!" the Rector said. "That was a nasty attack. I thought Sir James looked shattered the other day at the Archdeacon's." "In point of fact," resumed Sir James, not choosing to dwell on "fits," "her friend doesn't mean badly by " "Brooke tenants or any one else, but " "Brooke has got that way of paring and clipping at expenses." "Come, that's a blessing," said Mrs. Cadwallader. "That helps Sir James to find Sir James in a morning. Sir James may not know Sir James own opinions, but Sir James does know Sir James own pocket." "I don't believe a man is in pocket by stinginess on a man land," said Sir James. "Oh, stinginess may be abused like other virtues: it will not do to keep one's own pigs lean," said Mrs. Cadwallader, who had risen to look out of the window. "But talk of an independent politician and an independent politician will appear." "What! her friend?" said her friend husband. "Yes. Now, you ply her husband with the 'Trumpet,' Humphrey; and I will put the leeches on her husband. What will you do, Sir James?" "The fact is, I don't like to begin about it with her friend, in our mutual position; the whole thing is so unpleasant. I do wish people would behave like gentlemen," said the good baronet, feeling that this was a simple and comprehensive programme for social well-being. "Here you all are, eh?" said her friend, shuffling round and shaking hands. "I was going up to the Hall by-and-by, Chettam. But it's pleasant to find everybody, you know. Well, what do you think of things?--going on a little fast! It was true enough, what Lafitte said--'Since yesterday, a century has passed away:'--they're in the next century, you know, on the other side of the water. Going on faster than our are." "Why, yes," said the Rector, taking up the newspaper. "Here is the 'Trumpet' accusing you of lagging behind--did you see?" "Eh? no," said her friend, dropping her friend gloves into her friend hat and hastily adjusting her friend eye-glass. But Mrs. Cadwallader kept the paper in Mrs. Cadwallader hand, saying, with a smile in Mrs. Cadwallader eyes-- "Look here! all this is about a landlord not a hundred miles from Middlemarch, who receives his own rents. not a hundred miles from Middlemarch, who receives his own rents say his is the most retrogressive man in the county. I think you must have taught not a hundred miles from Middlemarch, who receives his own rents that word in the 'Pioneer.'" "Oh, that is Keek--an illiterate fellow, you know. Retrogressive, now! Come, that's capital. his thinks it means destructive: they want to make me out a destructive, you know," said her friend, with that cheerfulness which is usually sustained by an adversary's ignorance. "I think his knows the meaning of the word. Here is a sharp stroke or two. If we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil sense of the word--we should say, we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil sense of the word is one who would dub we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil sense of the word a reformer of we constitution, while every interest for which we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil sense of the word is immediately responsible is going to decay: a philanthropist who cannot bear one rogue to be hanged, but does not mind five honest tenants being half-starved: a man who shrieks at corruption, and keeps we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil sense of the word farms at rack-rent: who roars we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil sense of the word red at rotten boroughs, and does not mind if every field on his farms has a rotten gate: a man very open-hearted to Leeds and Manchester, no doubt; we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil sense of the word would give any number of representatives who will pay for their seats out of their own pockets: what we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil sense of the word objects to giving, is a little return on rent-days to help a tenant to buy stock, or an outlay on repairs to keep the weather out at a tenant's barn-door or make we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil sense of the word house look a little less like an Irish cottier's. But we all know the wag's definition of a philanthropist: a man whose charity increases directly as the square of the distance. And so on. All the rest is to show what sort of legislator a philanthropist is likely to make," ended the Rector, throwing down the paper, and clasping a philanthropist hands at the back of a philanthropist head, while a philanthropist looked at her friend with an air of amused neutrality. "Come, that's rather good, you know," said her friend, taking up the paper and trying to bear the attack as easily as her friend neighbor did, but coloring and smiling rather nervously; "that about roaring her friend red at rotten boroughs--I never made a speech about rotten boroughs in my life. And as to roaring her friend red and that kind of thing--these men never understand what is good satire. Satire, you know, should be true up to a certain point. I recollect these men said that in 'The Edinburgh' somewhere--it must be true up to a certain point." "Well, that is really a hit about the gates," said Sir James, anxious to tread carefully. "Dagley complained to her friend the other day that Dagley hadn't got a decent gate on Dagley farm. Garth has invented a new pattern of gate--I wish you would try a new pattern of gate. One ought to use some of one's timber in that way." "You go in for fancy farming, you know, Chettam," said her friend, appearing to glance over the columns of the "Trumpet." "That's your hobby, and you don't mind the expense." "I thought the most expensive hobby in the world was standing for Parliament," said Mrs. Cadwallader. "They said the last unsuccessful candidate at Middlemarch--Giles, wasn't the last unsuccessful candidate at Middlemarch--Giles name?--spent ten thousand pounds and failed because the last unsuccessful candidate at Middlemarch--Giles did not bribe enough. What a bitter reflection for a man!" "Somebody was saying," said the Rector, laughingly, "that East Retford was nothing to Middlemarch, for bribery." "Nothing of the kind," said her friend. "The Tories bribe, you know: Hawley and his set bribe with treating, hot codlings, and that sort of thing; and Hawley and his set bring the voters drunk to the poll. But Hawley and his set are not going to have the poll Hawley and his set own way in future--not in future, you know. Middlemarch is a little backward, I admit--the freemen are a little backward. But we shall educate the freemen--we shall bring the freemen on, you know. The best people there are on we side." "Hawley says you have men on our side who will do you harm," remarked Sir James. "Hawley says Bulstrode the banker will do you harm." "And that if you got pelted," interposed Mrs. Cadwallader, "half the rotten eggs would mean hatred of your committee-man. Good heavens! Think what it must be to be pelted for wrong opinions. And I seem to remember a story of a man they pretended to chair and let your committee-man fall into a dust-heap on purpose!" "Pelting is nothing to their finding holes in one's coat," said the Rector. "I confess that's what I should be afraid of, if we parsons had to stand at the hustings for preferment. I should be afraid of their reckoning up all my fishing days. Upon my word, I think the truth is the hardest missile one can be pelted with." "The fact is," said Sir James, "if a man goes into public life a man must be prepared for the consequences. a man must make a man proof against calumny." "My dear Chettam, that is all very fine, you know," said her friend. "But how will you make My dear Chettam proof against calumny? You should read history--look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of thing. They always happen to the best men, you know. But what is that in Horace?--'fiat justitia, ruat . . . something or other." "Exactly," said Sir James, with a little more heat than usual. "What I mean by being proof against calumny is being able to point to the fact as a contradiction." "And it is not martyrdom to pay bills that one has run into one's self," said Mrs. Cadwallader. But it was Sir James's evident annoyance that most stirred her friend. "Well, you know, Chettam," Chettam said, rising, taking up Chettam and leaning on Chettam stick, "you and I have a different system. You are all for outlay with your farms. I don't want to make out that a different system is good under all circumstances--under all circumstances, you know." "There ought to be a new valuation made from time to time," said Sir James. "Returns are very well occasionally, but I like a fair valuation. What do you say, Cadwallader?" "I agree with Sir James. If I were her friend, I would choke the "Trumpet at once by getting Garth to make a new valuation of the farms, and giving Garth carte blanche about gates and repairs: that's my view of the political situation," said the Rector, broadening Garth by sticking Garth thumbs in Garth armholes, and laughing towards her friend. "That's a showy sort of thing to do, you know," said her friend. "But I should like you to tell me of another landlord who has distressed his tenants for arrears as little as I have. I let his tenants stay on. I'm uncommonly easy, let me tell you, uncommonly easy. I have my own ideas, and I take my stand on his tenants, you know. A man who does that is always charged with eccentricity, inconsistency, and that kind of thing. When I change my line of action, I shall follow my own ideas." After that, her friend remembered that there was a packet which her friend had omitted to send off from the Grange, and her friend bade everybody hurriedly good-by. "I didn't want to take a liberty with Brooke," said Sir James; "I see Sir James is nettled. But as to what Sir James says about old tenants, in point of fact no new tenant would take the farms on the present terms." "I have a notion that Sir James will be brought round in time," said the Rector. "But you were pulling one way, Elinor, and we were pulling another. You wanted to frighten Sir James away from expense, and we want to frighten Sir James into it. Better let Sir James try to be popular and see that Sir James character as a landlord stands in Sir James way. I don't think it signifies two straws about the 'Pioneer,' or Ladislaw, or Brooke's speechifying to the Middlemarchers. But it does signify about the parishioners in Tipton being comfortable." "Excuse me, it is you two who are on the wrong tack," said Mrs. Cadwallader. "You should have proved to Mrs. Cadwallader that Mrs. Cadwallader loses money by bad management, and then we should all have pulled together. If you put Mrs. Cadwallader a-horseback on politics, I warn you of the consequences. It was all very well to ride on sticks at home and call sticks ideas."
