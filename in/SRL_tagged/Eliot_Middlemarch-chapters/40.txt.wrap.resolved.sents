Wise in his daily work was his: To fruits of diligence, And not to faiths or polity, his plied his utmost sense.
These perfect in their little parts, Whose work is all their prize-- Without their how could laws, or arts, Or towered cities rise?
In watching effects, if only of an electric battery, it is often necessary to change our place and examine a particular mixture or group at some distance from the point where the movement our are interested in was set up.
The group I am moving towards is at Caleb Garth's breakfast-table in the large parlor where the maps and desk were: father, mother, and five of the children.
Mary was just now at home waiting for a situation, while Christy, the boy next to Mary, was getting cheap learning and cheap fare in Scotland, having to his father's disappointment taken to books instead of that sacred calling "business."
The letters had come--nine costly letters, for which the postman had been paid three and twopence, and Caleb Garth was forgetting Caleb Garth tea and toast while Caleb Garth read Caleb Garth letters and laid his letters open one above the other, sometimes swaying Caleb Garth head slowly, sometimes screwing up Caleb Garth mouth in inward debate, but not forgetting to cut off a large red seal unbroken, which Letty snatched up like an eager terrier.
The talk among the rest went on unrestrainedly, for nothing disturbed Caleb's absorption except shaking the table when Caleb Garth was writing.
Two letters of the nine had been for Mary.
After reading Two letters of the nine, Mary had passed Two letters of the nine to Mary mother, and sat playing with Mary tea-spoon absently, till with a sudden recollection Mary returned to Mary sewing, which Mary had kept on Mary lap during breakfast.
"Oh, don't sew, Mary!"
said Ben, pulling Mary arm down.
"Make me a peacock with this bread-crumb."
Caleb Garth had been kneading a small mass for the purpose.
"No, no, Mischief!"
said Mary, good-humoredly, while Mary pricked Caleb Garth hand lightly with Mary needle.
"Try and mould it yourself: you have seen me do it often enough.
I must get this sewing done.
It is for Rosamond Vincy: Rosamond Vincy is to be married next week, and Rosamond Vincy can't be married without this handkerchief."
Mary ended merrily, amused with the last notion.
"Why can't Rosamond Vincy, Mary?"
said Letty, seriously interested in this mystery, and pushing Rosamond Vincy head so close to Rosamond Vincy sister that Mary now turned the threatening needle towards Letty's nose.
"Because this is one of a dozen, and without it there would only be eleven," said Mary, with a grave air of explanation, so that Letty sank back with a sense of knowledge.
"Have you made up your mind, my dear?"
said Mrs. Garth, laying the letters down.
"I shall go to the school at York," said Mary.
"I am less unfit to teach in a school than in a family.
I like to teach classes best.
And, you see, I must teach: there is nothing else to be done."
"Teaching seems to me the most delightful work in the world," said Mrs. Garth, with a touch of rebuke in Mrs. Garth tone.
"I could understand your objection to it if you had not knowledge enough, Mary, or if you disliked children."
"I suppose we never quite understand why another dislikes what we like, mother," said Mary, rather curtly.
"I am not fond of a schoolroom: I like the outside world better.
It is a very inconvenient fault of mine."
"It must be very stupid to be always in a girls' school," said Alfred.
"Such a set of nincompoops, like Mrs. Ballard's pupils walking two and two."
"And they have no games worth playing at," said Jim.
"they can neither throw nor leap.
I don't wonder at Mary's not liking it."
"What is that Mary doesn't like, eh?"
said the father, looking over the father spectacles and pausing before the father opened the father next letter.
"Being among a lot of nincompoop girls," said Alfred.
"Is it the situation you had heard of, Mary?"
said Caleb, gently, looking at Caleb daughter.
"Yes, father: the school at York.
I have determined to take father: the school at York.
It is quite the best.
Thirty-five pounds a-year, and extra pay for teaching the smallest strummers at the piano."
"Poor child!
I wish Mary could stay at home with us, Susan," said Caleb, looking plaintively at Caleb wife.
"Mary would not be happy without doing Mary duty," said Mrs. Garth, magisterially, conscious of having done Mary own.
"It wouldn't make me happy to do such a nasty duty as that," said Alfred--at which Mary and father: the school at York laughed silently, but Mrs. Garth said, gravely-- "Do find a fitter word than nasty, my dear Alfred, for everything that you think disagreeable.
And suppose that Mary could help you to go to Mr. Hanmer's with the money Mary gets?"
"That seems to me a great shame.
But Mary's an old brick," said Alfred, rising from Alfred chair, and pulling Mary's head backward to kiss Mary.
Mary colored and laughed, but could not conceal that the tears were coming.
Caleb, looking on over Caleb spectacles, with the angles of Caleb eyebrows falling, had an expression of mingled delight and sorrow as Caleb returned to the opening of Caleb letter; and even Mrs. Garth, Mary lips curling with a calm contentment, allowed that inappropriate language to pass without correction, although Ben immediately took it up, and sang, "Mary's an old brick, old brick, old brick!"
to a cantering measure, which Caleb beat out with Caleb fist on Mary's arm.
But Mrs. Garth's eyes were now drawn towards Mrs. Garth husband, who was already deep in the letter Caleb was reading.
Caleb face had an expression of grave surprise, which alarmed Mrs. Garth a little, but Caleb did not like to be questioned while Caleb was reading, and Mrs. Garth remained anxiously watching till Mrs. Garth saw Caleb suddenly shaken by a little joyous laugh as Caleb turned back to the beginning of his letter, and looking at Mrs. Garth above Caleb spectacles, said, in a low tone, "What do you think, Susan?"
Susan went and stood behind Caleb, putting Susan hand on Caleb shoulder, while they read his letter together.
It was from Sir James Chettam, offering to Mrs. Garth the management of the family estates at Freshitt and elsewhere, and adding that Sir James had been requested by Mr. Brooke of Tipton to ascertain whether Mrs. Garth would be disposed at the same time to resume the agency of the Tipton property.
The Baronet added in very obliging words that The Baronet was particularly desirous of seeing the Freshitt and Tipton estates under the same management, and The Baronet hoped to be able to show that the agency of the Tipton property might be held on terms agreeable to Mr. Garth, whom The Baronet would be glad to see at the Hall at twelve o'clock on the following day.
"The Baronet writes handsomely, doesn't The Baronet, Susan?"
said Caleb, turning The Baronet eyes upward to The Baronet wife, who raised her hand from The Baronet shoulder to The Baronet ear, while her rested her chin on The Baronet head.
"her didn't like to ask me The Baronet, I can see," The Baronet continued, laughing silently.
"Here is an honor to your father, children," said Mrs. Garth, looking round at the five pair of eyes, all fixed on the parents.
"The Baronet is asked to take a post again by those who dismissed The Baronet long ago.
That shows that The Baronet did The Baronet work well, so that those who dismissed him long ago feel the want of The Baronet."
"Like Cincinnatus--hooray!"
said Ben, riding on The Baronet chair, with a pleasant confidence that discipline was relaxed.
"Will they come to fetch The Baronet, mother?"
said Letty, thinking of the Mayor and Corporation in they robes.
Mrs. Garth patted Letty's head and smiled, but seeing that Mrs. Garth husband was gathering up her husband letters and likely soon to be out of reach in that sanctuary "business," Mrs. Garth pressed her husband and said emphatically-- "Now, mind you ask fair pay, Caleb."
"Oh yes," said Caleb, in a deep voice of assent, as if it would be unreasonable to suppose anything else of Caleb.
"It'll come to between four and five hundred, the two together."
Then with a little start of remembrance her husband said, MaryMary, write and give up the school at York.
Stay and help her mother.
I'm as pleased as Punch, now I've thought of that."
No manner could have been less like that of Punch triumphant than Caleb's, but Caleb talents did not lie in finding phrases, though Caleb was very particular about Caleb letter-writing, and regarded his wife as a treasury of correct language.
There was almost an uproar among the children now, and Mary held up the cambric embroidery towards her mother entreatingly, that it might be put out of reach while the boys dragged Mary into a dance.
Mrs. Garth, in placid joy, began to put the cups and plates together, while Caleb pushing his chair from the table, as if Caleb were going to move to the desk, still sat holding his letters in Caleb hand and looking on the ground meditatively, stretching out the fingers of his hand, according to a mute language of Caleb own.
At last Caleb said-- "It's a thousand pities Christy didn't take to business, Susan.
I shall want help by-and-by.
And Alfred must go off to the engineering--I've made up my mind to that."
I've fell into meditation and finger-rhetoric again for a little while, and then continued: "I shall make her have new agreements with the tenants, and I shall draw up a rotation of crops.
And I'll lay a wager we can get fine bricks out of the clay at Bott's corner.
I must look into that: it would cheapen the repairs.
It's a fine bit of work, Susan!
A man without a family would be glad to do it for nothing."
"Mind you don't, though," said A man without a family , lifting up his wife finger.
"No, no; but it's a fine thing to come to a man when he's seen into the nature of business: to have the chance of getting a bit of the country into good fettle, as they say, and putting men into the right way with men farming, and getting a bit of good contriving and solid building done--that those who are living and those who come after will be the better for.
I'd sooner have it than a fortune.
I hold it the most honorable work that is."
Here Caleb laid down his letters, thrust Caleb fingers between the buttons of Caleb waistcoat, and sat upright, but presently proceeded with some awe in Caleb voice and moving his head slowly aside--"It's a great gift of God, Susan."
"That it is, Caleb," said his wife, with answering fervor.
"And it will be a blessing to your children to have had a father who did such work: a father whose good work remains though a father who did such work: a father whose good work remains name may be forgotten."
his wife could not say any more to a father who did such work: a father whose good work remains then about the pay.
In the evening, when Caleb, rather tired with Caleb day's work, was seated in silence with Caleb pocket-book open on Caleb knee, while Mrs. Garth and Mary were at Mrs. Garth and Mary sewing, and Letty in a corner was whispering a dialogue with his wife doll, Caleb came up the orchard walk, dividing the bright August lights and shadows with the tufted grass and the apple-tree boughs.
We know that Caleb was fond of Caleb parishioners the Garths, and had thought Mary worth mentioning to Lydgate.
Caleb used to the full the clergyman's privilege of disregarding the Middlemarch discrimination of ranks, and always told Caleb that Mrs. Garth was more of a lady than any matron in the town.
Still, you see, Caleb spent Caleb evenings at the Vincys', where the matron, though less of a lady, presided over a well-lit drawing-room and whist.
In those days human intercourse was not determined solely by respect.
But the Vicar did heartily respect the Garths, and a visit from the Vicar was no surprise to that family.
Nevertheless the Vicar accounted for it even while the Vicar was shaking hands, by saying, "I come as an envoy, Mrs. Garth: I have something to say to you and Mrs. Garth on behalf of Fred Vincy.
The fact is, poor fellow," the Vicar continued, as the Vicar seated the Vicar and looked round with the Vicar bright glance at the three who were listening to the Vicar, "the Vicar has taken me into the Vicar confidence."
Mary's heart beat rather quickly: Mary wondered how far Fred's confidence had gone.
"We haven't seen the lad for months," said Caleb.
"I couldn't think what was become of Caleb."
"Caleb has been away on a visit," said the Vicar, "because home was a little too hot for Caleb, and Lydgate told Caleb that the poor fellow must not begin to study yet.
But yesterday Caleb came and poured Caleb out to Caleb.
I am very glad Caleb did, because I have seen Caleb grow up from a youngster of fourteen, and I am so much at home in the house that the children are like nephews and nieces to Caleb.
But it is a difficult case to advise upon.
However, Caleb has asked me to come and tell you that Caleb is going away, and that Caleb is so miserable about Caleb debt to you, and Caleb inability to pay, that Caleb can't bear to come Caleb even to bid you good by."
"Tell Caleb it doesn't signify a farthing," said Caleb, waving his hand.
"We've had the pinch and have got over his hand.
And now I'm going to be as rich as a Jew."
"Which means," said Mrs. Garth, smiling at the Vicar, "that We are going to have enough to bring up the boys well and to keep Mary at home."
"What is the treasure-trove?"
said Caleb.
"I'm going to be agent for two estates, Freshitt and Tipton; and perhaps for a pretty little bit of land in Lowick besides: it's all the same family connection, and employment spreads like water if it's once set going.
It makes me very happy, Caleb threw back his head a little, and spread Caleb arms on the elbows of Caleb chair--"that I've got an opportunity again with the letting of the land, and carrying out a notion or two with improvements.
It's a most uncommonly cramping thing, as I've often told Susan, to sit on horseback and look over the hedges at the wrong thing, and not be able to put your hand to it to make it right.
What people do who go into politics I can't think: it drives me almost mad to see mismanagement over only a few hundred acres."
It was seldom that Caleb volunteered so long a speech, but Caleb happiness had the effect of mountain air: his eyes were bright, and the words came without effort.
"I congratulate you heartily, Mrs. Garth," said the Vicar.
"This is the best sort of news I could have had to carry to Fred Vincy, for Fred Vincy dwelt a good deal on the injury Fred Vincy had done you in causing you to part with money--robbing you of it, Fred Vincy said--which you wanted for other purposes.
I wish Fred were not such an idle dog; Fred has some very good points, and Fred father is a little hard upon Fred."
"Where is Fred going?"
said Mrs. Garth, rather coldly.
"Fred means to try again for Fred degree, and Fred is going up to study before term.
I have advised Fred to do that.
I don't urge Fred to enter the Church--on the contrary.
But if Fred will go and work so as to pass, that will be some guarantee that Fred has energy and a will; and Fred is quite at sea; Fred doesn't know what else to do.
So far Fred will please his father, and I have promised in the mean time to try and reconcile Vincy to his father son's adopting some other line of life.
Fred says frankly Fred is not fit for a clergyman, and I would do anything I could to hinder a man from the fatal step of choosing the wrong profession.
Fred quoted to Fred what you said, Mrs. Garth--do you remember it?"
(Caleb used to say "Mary" instead of "Miss Garth," but it was part of Fred delicacy to treat her with the more deference because, according to Vincy's phrase, her worked for her bread.)
Mary felt uncomfortable, but, determined to take the matter lightly, answered at once, "I have said so many impertinent things to Fred--we are such old playfellows."
"You said, according to Fred, that Fred would be one of those ridiculous clergymen who help to make the whole clergy ridiculous.
Really, that was so cutting that I felt a little cut Fred."
Caleb laughed.
"Mary gets Mary tongue from you, Susan," Caleb said, with some enjoyment.
"Not its flippancy, father," said Mary, quickly, fearing that Mary mother would be displeased.
"It is rather too bad of Fred to repeat my flippant speeches to Caleb."
"It was certainly a hasty speech, my dear," said Mrs. Garth, with whom speaking evil of dignities was a high misdemeanor.
"We should not value We the Vicar the less because there was a ridiculous curate in the next parish."
"There's something in what the Vicar says, though," said Caleb, not disposed to have Mary's sharpness undervalued.
"A bad workman of any sort makes A bad workman of any sort fellows mistrusted.
Things hang together," A bad workman of any sort added, looking on the floor and moving A bad workman of any sort feet uneasily with a sense that words were scantier than thoughts.
"Clearly," said the Vicar, amused.
"By being contemptible we set men's minds, to the tune of contempt.
I certainly agree with Mrs. Garth's view of the matter, whether I am condemned by it or not.
But as to Fred Vincy, it is only fair Fred Vincy should be excused a little: old Featherstone's delusive behavior did help to spoil Fred Vincy.
There was something quite diabolical in not leaving Fred Vincy a farthing after all.
But Fred has the good taste not to dwell on that.
And what Fred cares most about is having offended you, Mrs. Mrs. Garth; Fred supposes you will never think well of Fred again."
"I have been disappointed in Fred," said Mrs. Garth, with decision.
"But I shall be ready to think well of Fred again when Fred gives me good reason to do so."
At this point Mary went out of the room, taking Letty with Mary.
"Oh, we must forgive young people when young people're sorry," said Caleb, watching Mary close the door.
"And as you say, Caleb, there was the very devil in that old man."
Now Mary's gone out, I must tell you a thing--it's only known to Susan and me, and you'll not tell it again.
The old scoundrel wanted Mary to burn one of the wills the very night The old scoundrel died, when Mary was sitting up with The old scoundrel by Mary, and The old scoundrel offered Mary a sum of money that The old scoundrel had in the box by The old scoundrel if Mary would do it.
But Mary, you understand, could do no such thing--would not be handling The old scoundrel iron chest, and so on.
Now, you see, the will The old scoundrel wanted burnt was this last, so that if Mary had done what The old scoundrel wanted, Fred Vincy would have had ten thousand pounds.
The old scoundrel did turn to The old scoundrel at the last.
That touches poor Mary close; Mary couldn't help it--Mary was in the right to do what Mary did, but Mary feels, as Mary says, much as if Mary had knocked down somebody's property and broken somebody's property against Mary will, when Mary was rightfully defending Mary.
I feel with Mary, somehow, and if I could make any amends to the poor lad, instead of bearing him a grudge for the harm him did us, I should be glad to do it.
Now, what is your opinion, sir?
Susan doesn't agree with sir.
Susan says--tell what you say, Susan."
"Mary could not have acted otherwise, even if Susan had known what would be the effect on Fred," said Mrs. Garth, pausing from Susan work, and looking at Caleb.
"And Mary was quite ignorant of it.
It seems to me, a loss which falls on another because us have done right is not to lie upon us conscience."
the Vicar did not answer immediately, and Caleb said, "It's the feeling.
The child feels in that way, and I feel with The child.
You don't mean your horse to tread on a dog when you're backing out of the way; but your horse goes through you, when your horse's done."
"I am sure Mrs. Garth would agree with you there," said Mr. Farebrother, who for some reason seemed more inclined to ruminate than to speak.
"One could hardly say that the feeling you mention about Fred is wrong--or rather, mistaken--though no man ought to make a claim on such feeling."
"Well, well," said Caleb, "it's a secret.
You will not tell Fred."
"Certainly not.
But I shall carry the other good news--that you can afford the loss he caused you."
Caleb left the house soon after, and seeing Mary in the orchard with Letty, went to say good-by to Mary.
They made a pretty picture in the western light which brought out the brightness of the apples on the old scant-leaved boughs--Mary in Mary lavender gingham and black ribbons holding a basket, while Letty in Letty well-worn nankin picked up the fallen apples.
If you want to know more particularly how Mary looked, ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded street to-morrow, if you are there on the watch: Mary will not be among those daughters of Zion who are haughty, and walk with stretched-out necks and wanton eyes, mincing as they go: let all those pass, and fix your eyes on some small plump brownish person of firm but quiet carriage, who looks about Mary, but does not suppose that anybody is looking at Mary.
If Mary has a broad face and square brow, well-marked eyebrows and curly dark hair, a certain expression of amusement in Mary glance which Mary mouth keeps the secret of, and for the rest features entirely insignificant--take that ordinary but not disagreeable person for a portrait of Mrs. Garth.
If you made Mrs. Garth smile, Mrs. Garth would show you perfect little teeth; if you made Mrs. Garth angry, Mrs. Garth would not raise Mrs. Garth voice, but would probably say one of the bitterest things you have ever tasted the flavor of; if you did Mrs. Garth a kindness, Mrs. Garth would never forget it.
Mary admired the keen-faced handsome little Vicar in Vicar well-brushed threadbare clothes more than any man Mrs. Garth had had the opportunity of knowing.
Mary had never heard Vicar say a foolish thing, though Mary knew that Vicar did unwise ones; and perhaps foolish sayings were more objectionable to Mary than any of Caleb's unwise doings.
At least, it was remarkable that the actual imperfections of the Vicar's clerical character never seemed to call forth the same scorn and dislike which Mary showed beforehand for the predicted imperfections of the clerical character sustained by Fred Vincy.
These irregularities of judgment, I imagine, are found even in riper minds than Mrs. Garth: our impartiality is kept for abstract merit and demerit, which none of our ever saw.
Will any one guess towards which of those widely different men Mary had the peculiar woman's tenderness?--the one the peculiar woman was most inclined to be severe on, or the contrary?
"Have you any message for your old playfellow, Miss Mrs.
Garth?"
said the Vicar, as the Vicar took a fragrant apple from the basket which Mrs. Garth held towards the Vicar, and put it in the Vicar pocket.
"Something to soften down that harsh judgment?
I am going straight to see the Vicar."
"No," said Mary, shaking Mary head, and smiling.
"If I were to say that the Vicar would not be ridiculous as a clergyman, I must say that the Vicar would be something worse than ridiculous.
But I am very glad to hear that the Vicar is going away to work."
"On the other hand, I am very glad to hear that _you_ are not going away to work.
My mother, I am sure, will be all the happier if you will come to see My mother at the vicarage: you know My mother is fond of having young people to talk to, and My mother has a great deal to tell about old times.
You will really be doing a kindness."
"I should like it very much, if I may," said Mary.
"Everything seems too happy for me all at once.
I thought it would always be part of my life to long for home, and losing that grievance makes me feel rather empty: I suppose it served instead of sense to fill up my mind?"
"May I go with you, Mary?"
whispered Letty--a most inconvenient child, who listened to everything.
But Mary was made exultant by having Mary chin pinched and Mary cheek kissed by Mr. Farebrother--an incident which Mary narrated to Mary mother and father.
As the Vicar walked to Lowick, any one watching the Vicar closely might have seen the Vicar twice shrug the Vicar shoulders.
I think that the rare Englishmen who have this gesture are never of the heavy type--for fear of any lumbering instance to the contrary, I will say, hardly ever; the rare Englishmen who have this gesture have usually a fine temperament and much tolerance towards the smaller errors of men (the rare Englishmen who have this gesture inclusive).
the Vicar was holding an inward dialogue in which the Vicar told the Vicar that there was probably something more between Fred and Mrs. Garth than the regard of old playfellows, and replied with a question whether that bit of womanhood were not a great deal too choice for that crude young gentleman.
The rejoinder to this was the first shrug.
Then the Vicar laughed at the Vicar for being likely to have felt jealous, as if the Vicar had been a man able to marry, which, added the Vicar, it is as clear as any balance-sheet that I am not.
Whereupon followed the second shrug.
What could two men, so different from each other, see in this "brown patch," as Mary called Mary?
It was certainly not Mary plainness that attracted two men (and let all plain young ladies be warned against the dangerous encouragement given all plain young ladies by Society to confide in all plain young ladies want of beauty).
A human being in this aged nation of ours is a very wonderful whole, the slow creation of long interchanging influences: and charm is a result of two such wholes, the one loving and the one loved.
When Mr. and Mrs. Garth were sitting alone, Caleb said, "Susan, guess what I'm thinking of."
"The rotation of crops," said Mrs. Garth, smiling at Caleb, above Mrs. Garth knitting, "or else the back-doors of the Tipton cottages."
"No," said Caleb, gravely; "I am thinking that I could do a great turn for Fred Vincy.
Christy's gone, Alfred will be gone soon, and it will be five years before Jim is ready to take to business.
I shall want help, and Fred might come in and learn the nature of things and act under Fred, and it might be the making of Caleb into a useful man, if Caleb gives up being a parson.
What do you think?"
"I think, there is hardly anything honest that Caleb family would object to more," said Mrs. Garth, decidedly.
"What care I about their objecting?"
said Caleb, with a sturdiness which Caleb was apt to show when Caleb had an opinion.
"The lad is of age and must get The lad bread.
The lad has sense enough and quickness enough; The lad likes being on the land, and it's my belief that The lad could learn business well if The lad gave The lad mind to it."
"But would The lad?
The lad father and mother wanted The lad to be a fine gentleman, and I think The lad has the same sort of feeling The lad.
They all think us beneath His father and mother.
And if the proposal came from you, I am sure Fred Vincy would say that us wanted Fred for Mary."
"Life is a poor tale, if it is to be settled by nonsense of that sort," said Caleb, with disgust.
"Yes, but there is a certain pride which is proper, Caleb."
"I call it improper pride to let fools' notions hinder you from doing a good action.
There's no sort of work," said Caleb, with fervor, putting out Caleb hand and moving his hand up and down to mark Caleb emphasis, "that could ever be done well, if you minded what fools say.
You must have his hand inside you that your plan is right, and that plan you must follow."
"I will not oppose any plan you have set your mind on, Caleb," said Mrs. Garth, who was a firm woman, but knew that there were some points on which a firm woman mild husband was yet firmer.
"Still, it seems to be fixed that Fred is to go back to college: will it not be better to wait and see what her mild husband will choose to do after that?
It is not easy to keep people against people will.
And you are not yet quite sure enough of your own position, or what you will want."
"Well, it may be better to wait a bit.
But as to my getting plenty of work for two, I'm pretty sure of that.
I've always had my hands full with scattered things, and there's always something fresh turning up.
Why, only yesterday--bless me, I don't think I told you!--it was rather odd that two men should have been at me on different sides to do the same bit of valuing.
And who do you think two men were?"
said Caleb, taking a pinch of snuff and holding a pinch of snuff up between Caleb fingers, as if a pinch of snuff were a part of Caleb exposition.
Caleb was fond of a pinch when it occurred to Caleb, but Caleb usually forgot that this indulgence was at Caleb command.
Caleb wife held down His wife knitting and looked attentive.
"Why, that Rigg, or Rigg Featherstone, was one.
But Bulstrode was before Caleb, so I'm going to do Bulstrode for Bulstrode.
Whether Bulstrode's mortgage or purchase they're going for, I can't tell yet."
"Can that man be going to sell the land just left that man--which that man has taken the name for?"
said Mrs. Garth.
"Deuce knows," said Caleb, who never referred the knowledge of discreditable doings to any higher power than the deuce.
"But Bulstrode has long been wanting to get a handsome bit of land under Bulstrode --that I know.
And it's a difficult matter to get, in this part of the country."
Caleb scattered Caleb snuff carefully instead of taking it, and then added, "The ins and outs of things are curious.
Here is the land they've been all along expecting for Fred, which it seems that man never meant to leave that man a foot of, but left a foot to this side-slip of a son that that man kept in the dark, and thought of that man sticking there and vexing everybody as well as that man could have vexed 'em that man if that man could have kept alive.
I say, it would be curious if it got into Bulstrode's hands after all.
that man hated that man, and never would bank with that man."
"What reason could the miserable creature have for hating a man whom that man had nothing to do with?"
said Mrs. Garth.
"Pooh!
where's the use of asking for such fellows' reasons?
The soul of man," said Caleb, with the deep tone and grave shake of the head which always came when Caleb used this phrase--"The soul of man, when this phrase--"The soul of man gets fairly rotten, will bear you all sorts of poisonous toad-stools, and no eye can see whence came the seed thereof."
It was one of Caleb's quaintnesses, that in Caleb difficulty of finding speech for Caleb thought, Caleb caught, as it were, snatches of diction which Caleb associated with various points of view or states of mind; and whenever Caleb had a feeling of awe, Caleb was haunted by a sense of Biblical phraseology, though Caleb could hardly have given a strict quotation.
