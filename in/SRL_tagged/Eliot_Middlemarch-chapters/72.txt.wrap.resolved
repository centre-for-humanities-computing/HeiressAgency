Full souls are double mirrors, making still An endless vista of fair things before, Repeating things behind. Dorothea's impetuous generosity, which would have leaped at once to the vindication of Lydgate from the suspicion of having accepted money as a bribe, underwent a melancholy check when Dorothea came to consider all the circumstances of the case by the light of Mr. Farebrother's experience. "It is a delicate matter to touch," Mr. Farebrother said. "How can we begin to inquire into It? It must be either publicly by setting the magistrate and coroner to work, or privately by questioning Lydgate. As to the first proceeding there is no solid ground to go upon, else Hawley would have adopted the first proceeding; and as to opening the subject with Lydgate, I confess I should shrink from the first proceeding. Hawley would probably take the first proceeding as a deadly insult. I have more than once experienced the difficulty of speaking to Hawley on personal matters. And--one should know the truth about Hawley conduct beforehand, to feel very confident of a good result." "I feel convinced that Hawley conduct has not been guilty: I believe that people are almost always better than people neighbors think people are," said Dorothea. Some of Dorothea intensest experience in the last two years had set Dorothea mind strongly in opposition to any unfavorable construction of others; and for the first time Dorothea felt rather discontented with Mr. Farebrother. Dorothea disliked this cautious weighing of consequences, instead of an ardent faith in efforts of justice and mercy, which would conquer by their emotional force. Two days afterwards, he was dining at the Manor with Dorothea uncle and the Chettams, and when the dessert was standing uneaten, the servants were out of the room, and Mr. Brooke was nodding in a nap, Mr. Brooke returned to the subject with renewed vivacity. "Mr. Lydgate would understand that if Mr. Lydgate friends hear a calumny about Mr. Lydgate the servants first wish must be to justify Mr. Lydgate. What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult to each other? I cannot be indifferent to the troubles of a man who advised me in _my_ trouble, and attended me in my illness." Dorothea's tone and manner were not more energetic than Dorothea's tone and manner had been when Dorothea was at the head of Dorothea uncle's table nearly three years before, and Dorothea experience since had given Dorothea more right to express a decided opinion. But Sir James Chettam was no longer the diffident and acquiescent suitor: Sir James Chettam was the anxious brother-in-law, with a devout admiration for Sir James Chettam sister, but with a constant alarm lest his sister should fall under some new illusion almost as bad as marrying Casaubon. Sir James Chettam smiled much less; when Sir James Chettam said "Exactly" it was more often an introduction to a dissentient opinion than in those submissive bachelor days; and Dorothea found to his sister surprise that his sister had to resolve not to be afraid of Sir James Chettam--all the more because Sir James Chettam was really his sister best friend. Sir James Chettam disagreed with his sister now. "But, Dorothea," Sir James Chettam said, remonstrantly, "you can't undertake to manage a man's life for a man in that way. Lydgate must know--at least Lydgate will soon come to know how Lydgate stands. If Lydgate can clear Lydgate, Lydgate will. Lydgate must act for Lydgate." "I think Lydgate friends must wait till his friends find an opportunity," added Mr. Farebrother. "It is possible--I have often felt so much weakness in Mr. Farebrother that I can conceive even a man of honorable disposition, such as I have always believed Lydgate to be, succumbing to such a temptation as that of accepting money which was offered more or less indirectly as a bribe to insure a bribe silence about scandalous facts long gone by. I say, I can conceive this, if a bribe were under the pressure of hard circumstances--if a bribe had been harassed as I feel sure Lydgate has been. I would not believe anything worse of a bribe except under stringent proof. But there is the terrible Nemesis following on some errors, that it is always possible for those who like it to interpret those who like it into a crime: there is no proof in favor of the man outside a bribe own consciousness and assertion." "Oh, how cruel!" said Dorothea, clasping Dorothea hands. "And would you not like to be the one person who believed in a bribe's innocence, if the rest of the world belied him? Besides, there is a man's character beforehand to speak for him." "But, my dear Mrs. Casaubon," said Mr. Farebrother, smiling gently at my dear Mrs. Casaubon ardor, "character is not cut in marble--it is not something solid and unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become diseased as our bodies do." "Then it may be rescued and healed," said Dorothea "I should not be afraid of asking Mr. Lydgate to tell me the truth, that I might help Mr. Lydgate. Why should I be afraid? Now that I am not to have the land, James, I might do as Mr. Bulstrode proposed, and take Mr. Bulstrode place in providing for the Hospital; and I have to consult Mr. Lydgate, to know thoroughly what are the prospects of doing good by keeping up the present plans. There is the best opportunity in the world for me to ask for his confidence; and his would be able to tell me things which might make all the circumstances clear. Then our would all stand by his and bring his out of his trouble. People glorify all sorts of bravery except the bravery People might show on behalf of People nearest neighbors." Dorothea's eyes had a moist brightness in Dorothea's eyes, and the changed tones of Dorothea voice roused Dorothea uncle, who began to listen. "It is true that a woman may venture on some efforts of sympathy which would hardly succeed if we men undertook them," said Mr. Farebrother, almost converted by Dorothea's ardor. "Surely, a woman is bound to be cautious and listen to those who know the world better than a woman does." said Sir James, with Sir James little frown. "Whatever you do in the end, Dorothea, you should really keep back at present, and not volunteer any meddling with this Bulstrode business. We don't know yet what may turn up. You must agree with Sir James?" Sir James ended, looking at Mr. Farebrother. "I do think it would be better to wait," said the latter. "Yes, yes, my dear," said Mr. Brooke, not quite knowing at what point the discussion had arrived, but coming up to the discussion with a contribution which was generally appropriate. "It is easy to go too far, you know. You must not let your ideas run away with Dorothea. And as to being in a hurry to put money into schemes--it won't do, you know. Garth has drawn me in uncommonly with repairs, draining, that sort of thing: I'm uncommonly out of pocket with one thing or another. I must pull up. As for Dorothea, Chettam, you are spending a fortune on those oak fences round your demesne." Dorothea, submitting uneasily to this discouragement, went with Celia into the library, which was Celia usual drawing-room. "Now, Dodo, do listen to what James says," said Celia, "else you will be getting into a scrape. You always did, and you always will, when you set about doing as you please. And I think it is a mercy now after all that you have got James to think for Dorothea. James lets you have your plans, only James hinders you from being taken in. And that is the good of having a brother instead of a husband. A husband would not let you have your plans." "As if I wanted a husband!" said Dorothea. "I only want not to have my feelings checked at every turn." Mrs. Casaubon was still undisciplined enough to burst into angry tears. "Now, really, Dodo," said Celia, with rather a deeper guttural than usual, "you _are_ contradictory: first one thing and then another. You used to submit to Mrs. Casaubon quite shamefully: I think you would have given up ever coming to see me if Mrs. Casaubon had asked you." "Of course I submitted to Mrs. Casaubon, because it was my duty; it was my feeling for Mrs. Casaubon," said Dorothea, looking through the prism of Dorothea tears. "Then why can't you think it your duty to submit a little to what James wishes?" said Celia, with a sense of stringency in Celia argument. "Because he only wishes what is for your own good. And, of course, men know best about everything, except what women know better." Dorothea laughed and forgot her tears. "Well, I mean about babies and those things," explained Celia. "I should not give up to James when I knew James was wrong, as you used to do to Mrs. Casaubon."
