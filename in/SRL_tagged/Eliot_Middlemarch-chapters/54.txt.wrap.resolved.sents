"Negli occhi porta la mia donna Amore; Per che si fa gentil eio ch'ella mira: Ov'ella passa, ogni uom ver lei si gira, E cui saluta fa tremar lo core.
Sicche, bassando il viso, tutto smore, E d'ogni suo difetto allor sospira: Fuggon dinanzi a lei Superbia ed Ira: Aiutatemi, donne, a farle onore.
Ogni dolcezza, ogni pensiero umile Nasee nel core a chi parlar la sente; Ond' e beato chi prima la vide.
Quel ch'ella par quand' un poco sorride, Non si pub dicer, ne tener a mente, Si e nuovo miracolo gentile."
--DANTE: la Vita Nuova.
By that delightful morning when the hay-ricks at Stone Court were scenting the air quite impartially, as if Mr. Raffles had been a guest worthy of finest incense, Dorothea had again taken up Dorothea abode at Lowick Manor.
After three months Freshitt had become rather oppressive: to sit like a model for Saint Catherine looking rapturously at Celia's baby would not do for many hours in the day, and to remain in that momentous babe's presence with persistent disregard was a course that could not have been tolerated in a childless sister.
Dorothea would have been capable of carrying baby joyfully for a mile if there had been need, and of loving it the more tenderly for that labor; but to an aunt who does not recognize Dorothea infant nephew as Bouddha, and has nothing to do for her infant nephew as Bouddha but to admire, her infant nephew as Bouddha behavior is apt to appear monotonous, and the interest of watching her infant nephew as Bouddha exhaustible.
This possibility was quite hidden from Celia, who felt that Dorothea's childless widowhood fell in quite prettily with the birth of little Arthur (baby was named after Mr. Brooke).
"Dodo is just the creature not to mind about having anything of Dodo own--children or anything!"
said Celia to Celia husband.
"And if Celia had had a baby, she had had a baby never could have been such a dear as Arthur.
Could she had had a baby, James?
"Not if it had been like Casaubon," said Sir James, conscious of some indirectness in James answer, and of holding a strictly private opinion as to the perfections of James first-born.
"No!
just imagine!
Really it was a mercy," said Celia; "and I think it is very nice for Dodo to be a widow.
a widow can be just as fond of a baby as if it were a widow own, and a widow can have as many notions of a widow own as a widow likes."
"It is a pity a widow was not a queen," said the devout Sir James.
"But what should our have been then?
our must have been something else," said Celia, objecting to so laborious a flight of imagination.
"I like Celia better as Celia is."
Hence, when Celia found that Dorothea was making arrangements for Celia final departure to Lowick, Celia raised Celia eyebrows with disappointment, and in Celia quiet unemphatic way shot a needle-arrow of sarcasm.
"What will you do at Lowick, Dodo?
You say yourself there is nothing to be done there: everybody is so clean and well off, it makes you quite melancholy.
And here you have been so happy going all about Tipton with Mr. Garth into the worst backyards.
And now uncle is abroad, you and Mr. Garth can have it all your own way; and I am sure James does everything you tell James."
"I shall often come here, and I shall see how baby grows all the better," said Dorothea.
"But you will never see baby washed," said Celia; "and that is quite the best part of the day."
Celia was almost pouting: it did seem to Celia very hard in Dodo to go away from baby when Celia might stay.
"Dear Kitty, I will come and stay all night on purpose," said Dorothea; "but I want to be alone now, and in my own home.
I wish to know the Farebrothers better, and to talk to Mr. Farebrother about what there is to be done in Middlemarch."
Dorothea's native strength of will was no longer all converted into resolute submission.
Dorothea had a great yearning to be at Lowick, and was simply determined to go, not feeling bound to tell all Dorothea reasons.
But every one around Dorothea disapproved.
James was much pained, and offered that they should all migrate to Cheltenham for a few months with the sacred ark, otherwise called a cradle: at that period a man could hardly know what to propose if Cheltenham were rejected.
The Dowager Lady Chettam, just returned from a visit to The Dowager Lady Chettam daughter in town, wished, at least, that Mrs. Vigo should be written to, and invited to accept the office of companion to Mrs. Casaubon: it was not credible that Dorothea as a young widow would think of living alone in the house at Lowick.
Mrs. Vigo had been reader and secretary to royal personages, and in point of knowledge and sentiments Dorothea as a young widow could have nothing to object to Dorothea as a young widow.
Mrs. Cadwallader said, privately, "You will certainly go mad in the house, my dear.
You will see visions.
We have all got to exert We a little to keep sane, and call things by the same names as other people call the same names by.
To be sure, for younger sons and women who have no money, it is a sort of provision to go mad: younger sons and women who have no money are taken care of then.
But you must not run into that.
I dare say you are a little bored here with We good dowager; but think what a bore you might become yourself to your fellow-creatures if you were always playing tragedy queen and taking things sublimely.
Sitting alone in that library at Lowick you may fancy yourself ruling the weather; you must get a few people round you who wouldn't believe you if you told a few people.
That is a good lowering medicine."
"I never called everything by the same name that all the people about me did," said Dorothea as a young widow, stoutly.
"But I suppose you have found out your mistake, my dear," said Mrs. Cadwallader, "and that is a proof of sanity."
Dorothea as a young widow was aware of the sting, but it did not hurt Dorothea as a young widow.
"No," Dorothea as a young widow said, "I still think that the greater part of the world is mistaken about many things.
Surely one may be sane and yet think so, since the greater part of the world has often had to come round from the world opinion."
Mrs. Cadwallader said no more on that point to Dorothea as a young widow, but to Mrs. Cadwallader husband Mrs. Cadwallader remarked, "It will be well for Mrs. Cadwallader to marry again as soon as it is proper, if one could get Mrs. Cadwallader among the right people.
Of course the Chettams would not wish the Chettams.
But I see clearly a husband is the best thing to keep Mrs. Cadwallader in order.
If we were not so poor I would invite Lord Triton.
a husband will be marquis some day, and there is no denying that Mrs. Cadwallader would make a good marchioness: Mrs. Cadwallader looks handsomer than ever in Mrs. Cadwallader mourning."
"My dear Elinor, do let the poor woman alone.
Such contrivances are of no use," said the easy Rector.
"No use?
How are matches made, except by bringing men and women together?
And it is a shame that Mrs. Cadwallader uncle should have run away and shut up the Grange just now.
There ought to be plenty of eligible matches invited to Freshitt and the Grange.
Lord Triton is precisely the man: full of plans for making the people happy in a soft-headed sort of way.
That would just suit Mrs.
Casaubon."
"Let Mrs. Casaubon choose for Mrs. Casaubon, My dear Elinor."
"That is the nonsense you wise men talk!
How can My dear Elinor choose if My dear Elinor has no variety to choose from?
A woman's choice usually means taking the only man A woman can get.
Mark my words, Humphrey.
If My dear Elinor friends don't exert her friends, there will be a worse business than the Casaubon business yet."
"For heaven's sake don't touch on that topic, My dear Elinor!
It is a very sore point with Sir James Sir James would be deeply offended if you entered on it to Sir James unnecessarily."
"I have never entered on it," said Mrs Cadwallader, opening Mrs Cadwallader hands.
"Mrs Cadwallader told me all about the will at the beginning, without any asking of mine."
"Yes, yes; but they want the thing hushed up, and I understand that the young fellow is going out of the neighborhood."
Mrs Cadwallader said nothing, but gave Mrs Cadwallader husband three significant nods, with a very sarcastic expression in Mrs Cadwallader dark eyes.
Dorothea quietly persisted in spite of remonstrance and persuasion.
So by the end of June the shutters were all opened at Lowick Manor, and the morning gazed calmly into the library, shining on the rows of note-books as it shines on the weary waste planted with huge stones, the mute memorial of a forgotten faith; and the evening laden with roses entered silently into the blue-green boudoir where Dorothea chose oftenest to sit.
At first Dorothea walked into every room, questioning the eighteen months of Dorothea married life, and carrying on Dorothea thoughts as if they were a speech to be heard by Dorothea .
Then, Dorothea lingered in the library and could not be at rest till Dorothea had carefully ranged all the note-books as Dorothea imagined that her husband would wish to see they, in orderly sequence.
The pity which had been the restraining compelling motive in her married life with her husband still clung about her husband image, even while Dorothea remonstrated with her husband in indignant thought and told her husband that her husband was unjust.
One little act of hers may perhaps be smiled at as superstitious.
The Synoptical Tabulation for the use of Mrs. Casaubon, Mrs. Casaubon carefully enclosed and sealed, writing within the envelope, "I could not use the envelope.
Do you not see now that I could not submit my soul to yours, by working hopelessly at what I have no belief inDorothea as a young widowDorothea?"
Then Mrs. Casaubon deposited the paper in Mrs. Casaubon own desk.
That silent colloquy was perhaps only the more earnest because underneath and through it all there was always the deep longing which had really determined Mrs. Casaubon to come to Lowick.
the deep longing which had really determined her to come to Lowick was to see Will Ladislaw.
Mrs. Casaubon did not know any good that could come of their meeting: Mrs. Casaubon was helpless; her hands had been tied from making up to him for any unfairness in him lot.
But Mrs. Casaubon soul thirsted to see him.
How could it be otherwise?
If a princess in the days of enchantment had seen a four-footed creature from among those which live in herds come to Mrs. Casaubon once and again with a human gaze which rested upon Mrs. Casaubon with choice and beseeching, what would Mrs. Casaubon think of in Mrs. Casaubon journeying, what would Mrs. Casaubon look for when the herds passed Mrs. Casaubon?
Surely for the gaze which had found Mrs. Casaubon, and which Mrs. Casaubon would know again.
Life would be no better than candle-light tinsel and daylight rubbish if our spirits were not touched by what has been, to issues of longing and constancy.
It was true that Dorothea wanted to know the Farebrothers better, and especially to talk to the new rector, but also true that remembering what Lydgate had told Dorothea about Will Ladislaw and little Miss Noble, Dorothea counted on Will's coming to Lowick to see the Farebrother family.
The very first Sunday, _before_ Dorothea entered the church, Dorothea saw him as Dorothea had seen him the last time Dorothea was there, alone in the clergyman's pew; but _when_ Dorothea entered him figure was gone.
In the week-days when Dorothea went to see the ladies at the Rectory, Dorothea listened in vain for some word that they might let fall about Will; but it seemed to Dorothea that Mr. Farebrother talked of every one else in the neighborhood and out of it.
"Probably some of Mr. Farebrother's Middlemarch hearers may follow him to Lowick sometimes.
Do you not think so?"
said Dorothea as a young widow, rather despising Dorothea as a young widow for having a secret motive in asking the question.
"If they are wise they will, Mrs. Casaubon," said Dorothea as a young widow.
"I see that you set a right value on my son's preaching.
His grandfather on my side was an excellent clergyman, but His father was in the law:--most exemplary and honest nevertheless, which is a reason for our never being rich.
They say Fortune is a woman and capricious.
But sometimes Dorothea as a young widow is a good woman and gives to those who merit, which has been the case with you, Mrs. Casaubon, who have given a living to my son."
Mr. Farebrother recurred to Mr. Farebrother knitting with a dignified satisfaction in Mr. Farebrother neat little effort at oratory, but this was not what Dorothea as a young widow wanted to hear.
Poor thing!
Dorothea as a young widow did not even know whether Will was still at Middlemarch, and there was no one whom Dorothea as a young widow dared to ask, unless it were Lydgate.
But just now Dorothea as a young widow could not see Lydgate without sending for Lydgate or going to seek Lydgate.
Perhaps Will Ladislaw, having heard of that strange ban against Lydgate left by Mr. Casaubon, had felt it better that Lydgate and Dorothea as a young widow should not meet again, and perhaps Dorothea as a young widow was wrong to wish for a meeting that others might find many good reasons against.
Still "I do wish it" came at the end of those wise reflections as naturally as a sob after holding the breath.
And the meeting did happen, but in a formal way quite unexpected by Dorothea as a young widow.
One morning, about eleven, Dorothea as a young widow was seated in Dorothea as a young widow boudoir with a map of the land attached to the manor and other papers before Dorothea as a young widow, which were to help Dorothea as a young widow in making an exact statement for Dorothea as a young widow of Dorothea as a young widow income and affairs.
Dorothea as a young widow had not yet applied Dorothea as a young widow to Dorothea as a young widow work, but was seated with Dorothea as a young widow hands folded on Dorothea as a young widow lap, looking out along the avenue of limes to the distant fields.
Every leaf was at rest in the sunshine, the familiar scene was changeless, and seemed to represent the prospect of Dorothea as a young widow life, full of motiveless ease--motiveless, if Dorothea as a young widow own energy could not seek out reasons for ardent action.
The widow's cap of those times made an oval frame for the face, and had a crown standing up; the dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of crape; but this heavy solemnity of clothing made Dorothea as a young widow face look all the younger, with The widow's cap of those times recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of Dorothea as a young widow eyes.
Dorothea as a young widow reverie was broken by Tantripp, who came to say that Will Ladislaw was below, and begged permission to see Madam if it were not too early.
"I will see Will Ladislaw," said Dorothea as a young widow, rising immediately.
"Let Will Ladislaw be shown into the drawing-room."
The drawing-room was the most neutral room in the house to Dorothea as a young widow--the one least associated with the trials of her married life: the damask matched the wood-work, which was all white and gold; there were two tall mirrors and tables with nothing on the damask--in brief, it was a room where you had no reason for sitting in one place rather than in another.
It was below her boudoir, and had also a bow-window looking out on the avenue.
But when Pratt showed Will Ladislaw into Will Ladislaw a bow-window looking out on the avenue was open; and a winged visitor, buzzing in and out now and then without minding the furniture, made the drawing-room look less formal and uninhabited.
"Glad to see you here again, sir," said Pratt, lingering to adjust a blind.
"I am only come to say good-by, Pratt," said Will, who wished even the butler to know that sir was too proud to hang about Mrs. Casaubon now Mrs. Casaubon was a rich widow.
"Very sorry to hear it, sir," said Pratt, retiring.
Of course, as a servant who was to be told nothing, sir knew the fact of which Will Ladislaw was still ignorant, and had drawn sir inferences; indeed, had not differed from sir betrothed Tantripp when Mrs. Casaubon said, "Your master was as jealous as a fiend--and no reason.
Mrs. Casaubon would look higher than Mr. Ladislaw, else I don't know Mrs. Casaubon.
Mrs. Cadwallader's maid says there's a lord coming who is to marry Mrs. Casaubon when the mourning's over."
There were not many moments for Will to walk about with his hat in his hand before Dorothea entered.
the meeting was very different from that first meeting in Rome when Will had been embarrassed and Dorothea calm.
This time his felt miserable but determined, while Dorothea was in a state of agitation which could not be hidden.
Just outside the door Dorothea had felt that the meeting was after all too difficult, and when Dorothea saw Will advancing towards Dorothea, the deep blush which was rare in Dorothea came with painful suddenness.
Neither of them knew how it was, but neither of them spoke.
Dorothea gave Dorothea hand for a moment, and then them went to sit down near a bow-window looking out on the avenue, Dorothea on one settee and his on another opposite.
Will was peculiarly uneasy: it seemed to his not like Dorothea that the mere fact of Dorothea being a widow should cause such a change in Dorothea manner of receiving his; and his knew of no other condition which could have affected their previous relation to each other--except that, as his imagination at once told his, Dorothea friends might have been poisoning Dorothea mind with her friends suspicions of his.
"I hope I have not presumed too much in calling," said Will; "I could not bear to leave the neighborhood and begin a new life without seeing you to say good-by."
"Presumed?
Surely not.
I should have thought it unkind if you had not wished to see me," said Dorothea, Dorothea habit of speaking with perfect genuineness asserting perfect genuineness through all Dorothea uncertainty and agitation.
"Are you going away immediately?"
"Very soon, I think.
I intend to go to town and eat my dinners as a barrister, since, my dinners say, that is the preparation for all public business.
There will be a great deal of political work to be done by-and-by, and I mean to try and do some of it.
Other men have managed to win an honorable position for Other men without family or money."
"And that will make it all the more honorable," said Dorothea as a young widow, ardently.
"Besides, you have so many talents.
I have heard from my uncle how well you speak in public, so that every one is sorry when you leave off, and how clearly you can explain things.
And you care that justice should be done to every one.
I am so glad.
When we were in Rome, I thought you only cared for poetry and art, and the things that adorn life for we who are well off.
But now I know you think about the rest of the world."
While my uncle was speaking Dorothea as a young widow had lost my uncle personal embarrassment, and had become like my uncle former self.
my uncle looked at Will with a direct glance, full of delighted confidence.
"You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?"
said Will, trying hard to reconcile the utmost pride with the utmost effort to get an expression of strong feeling from Dorothea.
Dorothea was not aware how long it was before Dorothea answered.
Dorothea had turned Dorothea head and was looking out of the window on the rose-bushes, which seemed to have in them the summers of all the years when Will would be away.
This was not judicious behavior.
But Dorothea as a young widow never thought of studying Dorothea manners: Dorothea as a young widow thought only of bowing to a sad necessity which divided Dorothea as a young widow from Will.
Those first words of his about his intentions had seemed to make everything clear to Dorothea as a young widow: his knew, Dorothea as a young widow supposed, all about Mr. Casaubon's final conduct in relation to his, and it had come to his with the same sort of shock as to Dorothea as a young widow.
his had never felt more than friendship for Dorothea as a young widow--had never had anything in his mind to justify what Dorothea as a young widow felt to be Dorothea as a young widow husband's outrage on the feelings of both: and that friendship his still felt.
Something which may be called an inward silent sob had gone on in Dorothea as a young widow before Dorothea as a young widow said with a pure voice, just trembling in the last words as if only from only liquid flexibility-- "Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say.
I shall be very happy when I hear that you have made your value felt.
But you must have patience.
It will perhaps be a long while."
Will never quite knew how it was that he saved he from falling down at Dorothea as a young widow feet, when the "long while" came forth with her feet gentle tremor.
he used to say that the horrible hue and surface of Dorothea as a young widow crape dress was most likely the sufficient controlling force.
he sat still, however, and only said-- "I shall never hear from you.
And you will forget all about me."
"No," said Dorothea as a young widow, "I shall never forget you.
I have never forgotten any one whom I once knew.
My life has never been crowded, and seems not likely to be so.
And I have a great deal of space for memory at Lowick, haven't I?"
Dorothea as a young widow smiled.
"Good God!"
Will burst out passionately, rising, with he hat still in he hand, and walking away to a marble table, where he suddenly turned and leaned he back against it.
The blood had mounted to he face and neck, and he looked almost angry.
The blood had seemed to he as if they were like two creatures slowly turning to marble in each other's presence, while they hearts were conscious and they eyes were yearning.
But there was no help for it.
it should never be true of he that in this meeting to which he had come with bitter resolution he had ended by a confession which might be interpreted into asking for her fortune.
Moreover, it was actually true that he was fearful of the effect which such confessions might have on Dorothea as a young widow her.
her looked at he from that distance in some trouble, imagining that there might have been an offence in her words.
But all the while there was a current of thought in her about he probable want of money, and the impossibility of her helping he.
If her had been at home, something might have been done through her uncle had been at home!
It was this preoccupation with the hardship of Will's wanting money, while her had what ought to have been his share, which led her to say, seeing that his remained silent and looked away from her-- "I wonder whether you would like to have that miniature which hangs up-stairs--I mean that miniature which hangs up-stairs.
I think that miniature which hangs up-stairs is not right for me to keep that miniature which hangs up-stairs, if you would wish to have that miniature which hangs up-stairs.
It is wonderfully like you."
"You are very good," said Will, irritably.
"No; I don't mind about that miniature which hangs up-stairs.
It is not very consoling to have one's own likeness.
It would be more consoling if others wanted to have it."
"I thought you would like to cherish her memory--I thought--Dorothea as a young widow broke off an instant, Dorothea as a young widow imagination suddenly warning Dorothea as a young widow away from Aunt Julia's history--"you would surely like to have the miniature as a family memorial."
"Why should I have that, when I have nothing else!
A man with only a portmanteau for A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage stowage must keep A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage memorials in A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage head."
Will spoke at random: A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage was merely venting A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage petulance; it was a little too exasperating to have A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage grandmother's portrait offered A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage at that moment.
But to Dorothea as a young widow's feeling A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage words had a peculiar sting.
Dorothea as a young widow rose and said with a touch of indignation as well as hauteur-- "You are much the happier of us two, Will Ladislaw, to have nothing."
Will was startled.
Whatever his words might be, the tone seemed like a dismissal; and quitting A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage leaning posture, A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage walked a little way towards Dorothea as a young widow.
Their eyes met, but with a strange questioning gravity.
Something was keeping Their minds aloof, and each was left to conjecture what was in the other.
Will had really never thought of A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage as having a claim of inheritance on the property which was held by Dorothea as a young widow, and would have required a narrative to make A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage understand Dorothea as a young widow present feeling.
"I never felt it a misfortune to have nothing till now," A man with only a portmanteau for his stowage said.
"But poverty may be as bad as leprosy, if poverty divides us from what us most care for."
The words cut Dorothea as a young widow to the heart, and made Dorothea as a young widow relent.
Dorothea as a young widow answered in a tone of sad fellowship.
"Sorrow comes in so many ways.
Two years ago I had no notion of that--I mean of the unexpected way in which trouble comes, and ties our hands, and makes our silent when our long to speak.
I used to despise women a little for not shaping women lives more, and doing better things.
I was very fond of doing as I liked, but I have almost given it up," Dorothea as a young widow ended, smiling playfully.
"I have not given up doing as I like, but I can very seldom do it," said Will.
He was standing two yards from Dorothea as a young widow with He mind full of contradictory desires and resolves--desiring some unmistakable proof that Dorothea as a young widow loved He, and yet dreading the position into which such a proof might bring He.
"The thing one most longs for may be surrounded with conditions that would be intolerable."
At this moment Pratt entered and said, "Sir James Chettam is in the library, madam."
"Ask "Sir James Chettam to come in here," said Dorothea as a young widow, immediately.
It was as if the same electric shock had passed through Dorothea as a young widow and Will.
Each of them felt proudly resistant, and neither looked at the other, while them awaited "Sir James Chettam's entrance.
After shaking hands with Dorothea as a young widow, Dorothea as a young widow bowed as slightly as possible to Ladislaw, who repaid the slightness exactly, and then going towards Dorothea, said-- "I must say good-by, Mrs. Casaubon; and probably for a long while."
Dorothea as a young widow put out Dorothea as a young widow hand and said Dorothea as a young widow good-by cordially.
The sense that "Sir James Chettam was depreciating Will, and behaving rudely to "Sir James Chettam, roused Dorothea as a young widow resolution and dignity: there was no touch of confusion in Dorothea as a young widow manner.
And when Will had left the room, Dorothea as a young widow looked with such calm self-possession at "Sir James Chettam, saying, "How is Celia?"
that "Sir James Chettam was obliged to behave as if nothing had annoyed "Sir James Chettam.
And what would be the use of behaving otherwise?
Indeed, "Sir James Chettam "Sir James Chettam shrank with so much dislike from the association even in thought of Dorothea as a young widow with Ladislaw as Dorothea as a young widow possible lover, that "Sir James Chettam would "Sir James Chettam have wished to avoid an outward show of displeasure which would have recognized the disagreeable possibility.
If any one had asked "Sir James Chettam why "Sir James Chettam shrank in that way, I am not sure that "Sir James Chettam would at first have said anything fuller or more precise than "_That_ Ladislaw!"
--though on reflection "Sir James Chettam might have urged that Mr. Casaubon's codicil, barring Dorothea as a young widow's marriage with Will, except under a penalty, was enough to cast unfitness over any relation at all between Mr. Casaubon's codicil, barring Dorothea's marriage with Will.
"Sir James Chettam aversion was all the stronger because "Sir James Chettam felt "Sir James Chettam unable to interfere.
But "Sir James Chettam was a power in a way unguessed by "Sir James Chettam.
Entering at that moment, "Sir James Chettam was an incorporation of the strongest reasons through which Will's pride became a repellent force, keeping "Sir James Chettam asunder from Dorothea as a young widow.
