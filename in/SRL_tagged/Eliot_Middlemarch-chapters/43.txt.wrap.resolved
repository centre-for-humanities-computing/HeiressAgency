This figure hath high price: 't was wrought with love Ages ago in finest ivory; Nought modish in This figure, pure and noble lines Of generous womanhood that fits all time That too is costly ware; majolica Of deft design, to please a lordly eye: The smile, you see, is perfect--wonderful As mere Faience! a table ornament To suit the richest mounting." Dorothea seldom left home without Dorothea husband, but Dorothea did occasionally drive into Middlemarch alone, on little errands of shopping or charity such as occur to every lady of any wealth when Dorothea lives within three miles of a town. Two days after that scene in the Yew-tree Walk, Dorothea determined to use such an opportunity in order if possible to see Lydgate, and learn from Lydgate whether her husband had really felt any depressing change of symptoms which her husband was concealing from Dorothea, and whether her husband had insisted on knowing the utmost about her husband. Dorothea felt almost guilty in asking for knowledge about her husband from another, but the dread of being without it--the dread of that ignorance which would make Dorothea unjust or hard--overcame every scruple. That there had been some crisis in her husband's mind Dorothea was certain: her husband had the very next day begun a new method of arranging her husband notes, and had associated Dorothea quite newly in carrying out her husband plan. Poor Dorothea needed to lay up stores of patience. It was about four o'clock when Poor Dorothea drove to Lydgate's house in Lowick Gate, wishing, in Poor Dorothea immediate doubt of finding him at home, that Poor Dorothea had written beforehand. And him was not at home. "Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?" said Dorothea, who had never, that Poor Dorothea knew of, seen Rosamond, but now remembered the fact of the marriage. Yes, Mrs. Lydgate was at home. "I will go in and speak to Mrs. Lydgate, if Mrs. Lydgate will allow me. Will you ask Mrs. Lydgate if Mrs. Lydgate can see me--see Mrs. Casaubon, for a few minutes?" When the servant had gone to deliver that message, Poor Dorothea could hear sounds of music through an open window--a few notes from a man's voice and then a piano bursting into roulades. But roulades broke off suddenly, and then the servant came back saying that Mrs. Lydgate would be happy to see Mrs. Casaubon. When the drawing-room door opened and Poor Dorothea entered, there was a sort of contrast not infrequent in country life when the habits of the different ranks were less blent than now. Let those who know, tell those who know exactly what stuff it was that Poor Dorothea wore in those days of mild autumn--that thin white woollen stuff soft to the touch and soft to the eye. It always seemed to have been lately washed, and to smell of the sweet hedges--was always in the shape of a pelisse with sleeves hanging all out of the fashion. Yet if Mrs. Lydgate had entered before a still audience as Imogene or Cato's daughter, the dress might have seemed right enough: the grace and dignity were in Mrs. Lydgate limbs and neck; and about Mrs. Lydgate simply parted hair and candid eyes the large round poke which was then in the fate of women, seemed no more odd as a head-dress than the gold trencher we call a halo. By the present audience of two persons, no dramatic heroine could have been expected with more interest than Mrs. Casaubon. To Rosamond Rosamond was one of those county divinities not mixing with Middlemarch mortality, whose slightest marks of manner or appearance were worthy of Rosamond study; moreover, Rosamond was not without satisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity of studying _her_. What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the best judges? and since Rosamond had received the highest compliments at Sir Godwin Lydgate's, Rosamond felt quite confident of the impression Rosamond must make on people of good birth. Dorothea put out Dorothea hand with Dorothea usual simple kindness, and looked admiringly at Lydgate's lovely bride--aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance, but seeing Dorothea merely as a coated figure at a wide angle. The gentleman was too much occupied with the presence of the one woman to reflect on the contrast between the two--a contrast that would certainly have been striking to a calm observer. They were both tall, and They eyes were on a level; but imagine Rosamond's infantine blondness and wondrous crown of hair-plaits, with Rosamond pale-blue dress of a fit and fashion so perfect that no dressmaker could look at no dressmaker without emotion, a large embroidered collar which no dressmaker was to be hoped all beholders would know the price of, Rosamond small hands duly set off with rings, and that controlled self-consciousness of manner which is the expensive substitute for simplicity. "Thank you very much for allowing me to interrupt you," said Dorothea, immediately. "I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if possible, before I go home, and I hoped that you might possibly tell me where I could find Mr. Lydgate, or even allow me to wait for Mr. Lydgate, if you expect Mr. Lydgate soon." "Mr. Lydgate is at the New Hospital," said Rosamond; "I am not sure how soon Mr. Lydgate will come home. But I can send for Mr. Lydgate." "Will you let me go and fetch Mr. Lydgate?" said Will Ladislaw, coming forward. Mr. Lydgate had already taken up Mr. Lydgate hat before Dorothea entered. Dorothea colored with surprise, but put out Dorothea hand with a smile of unmistakable pleasure, saying-- "I did not know it was you: I had no thought of seeing you here." "May I go to the New Hospital and tell Mr. Lydgate that you wish to see Mr. Lydgate?" said Will. "It would be quicker to send the carriage for Mr. Lydgate," said Dorothea, "if you will be kind enough to give the message to the coachman." Will was moving to the door when Dorothea, whose mind had flashed in an instant over many connected memories, turned quickly and said, "I will go myself, thank you. I wish to lose no time before getting home again. I will drive to the New Hospital and see Mr. Lydgate there. Pray excuse me, Mr. Lydgate. I am very much obliged to Mr. Lydgate." Mr. Lydgate mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought, and Mr. Lydgate left the room hardly conscious of what was immediately around Mr. Lydgate--hardly conscious that Will opened the door for Mr. Lydgate and offered Mr. Lydgate his arm to lead Mr. Lydgate to the carriage. Mr. Lydgate took his arm but said nothing. Will was feeling rather vexed and miserable, and found nothing to say on his side. his handed Mr. Lydgate into the carriage in silence, they said good-by, and Dorothea drove away. In the five minutes' drive to the New Hospital Mr. Lydgate had time for some reflections that were quite new to Mr. Lydgate. Mr. Lydgate decision to go, and Mr. Lydgate preoccupation in leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense that there would be a sort of deception in Mr. Lydgate voluntarily allowing any further intercourse between Mr. Lydgate and Will which Mr. Lydgate was unable to mention to Mr. Lydgate husband, and already Mr. Lydgate errand in seeking Lydgate was a matter of concealment. That was all that had been explicitly in Mr. Lydgate mind; but Mr. Lydgate had been urged also by a vague discomfort. Now that Mr. Lydgate was alone in Mr. Lydgate drive, Mr. Lydgate heard the notes of the man's voice and the accompanying piano, which Mr. Lydgate had not noted much at the time, returning on Mr. Lydgate inward sense; and Mr. Lydgate found Mr. Lydgate thinking with some wonder that Will Ladislaw was passing Will Ladislaw time with Mrs. Lydgate in her husband's absence. And then Mr. Lydgate could not help remembering that Will Ladislaw had passed some time with Mr. Lydgate under like circumstances, so why should there be any unfitness in the fact? But Will was Mr. Casaubon's relative, and one towards whom Mr. Lydgate was bound to show kindness. Still there had been signs which perhaps Mr. Lydgate ought to have understood as implying that Mr. Casaubon did not like Mr. Casaubon cousin's visits during Mr. Casaubon own absence. "Perhaps I have been mistaken in many things," said poor Dorothea to poor Dorothea, while the tears came rolling and poor Dorothea had to dry them quickly. poor Dorothea felt confusedly unhappy, and the image of Will which had been so clear to poor Dorothea before was mysteriously spoiled. But the carriage stopped at the gate of the Hospital. poor Dorothea was soon walking round the grass plots with Lydgate, and poor Dorothea feelings recovered the strong bent which had made poor Dorothea seek for this interview. Will Ladislaw, meanwhile, was mortified, and knew the reason of Will Ladislaw clearly enough. Will Ladislaw chances of meeting poor Dorothea were rare; and here for the first time there had come a chance which had set Will Ladislaw at a disadvantage. It was not only, as It had been hitherto, that poor Dorothea was not supremely occupied with Will Ladislaw, but that poor Dorothea had seen Will Ladislaw under circumstances in which Will Ladislaw might appear not to be supremely occupied with poor Dorothea. Will Ladislaw felt thrust to a new distance from poor Dorothea, amongst the circles of Middlemarchers who made no part of poor Dorothea life. But that was not Will Ladislaw fault: of course, since Will Ladislaw had taken Will Ladislaw lodgings in the town, Will Ladislaw had been making as many acquaintances as Will Ladislaw could, Will Ladislaw position requiring that Will Ladislaw should know everybody and everything. Lydgate was really better worth knowing than any one else in the neighborhood, and Lydgate happened to have a wife who was musical and altogether worth calling upon. Here was the whole history of the situation in which Diana had descended too unexpectedly on Diana worshipper. It was mortifying. Will was conscious that Lydgate should not have been at Middlemarch but for Dorothea; and yet his position was threatening to divide Lydgate from Dorothea with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more fatal to the persistence of mutual interest than all the distance between Rome and Britain. Prejudices about rank and status were easy enough to defy in the form of a tyrannical letter from Mr. Casaubon; but prejudices, like odorous bodies, have a double existence both solid and subtle--solid as the pyramids, subtle as the twentieth echo of an echo, or as the memory of hyacinths which once scented the darkness. And Will was of a temperament to feel keenly the presence of subtleties: a man of clumsier perceptions would not have felt, as a man of clumsier perceptions did, that for the first time some sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with a man of clumsier perceptions had sprung up in Poor Dorothea's mind, and that their silence, as a man of clumsier perceptions conducted Poor Dorothea to the carriage, had had a chill in it. Perhaps Mr. Casaubon, in a man of clumsier perceptions hatred and jealousy, had been insisting to Poor Dorothea that Will had slid below Poor Dorothea socially. Mr. Casaubon! Will re-entered the drawing-room, took up a man of clumsier perceptions , and looking irritated as a man of clumsier perceptions advanced towards Mrs. Lydgate, who had seated Poor Dorothea at Poor Dorothea work-table, said-- "It is always fatal to have music or poetry interrupted. May I come another day and just finish about the rendering of 'Lungi dal caro bene'?" "I shall be happy to be taught," said Rosamond. "But I am sure you admit that the interruption was a very beautiful one. I quite envy your acquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon. Is Rosamond very clever? Rosamond looks as if Rosamond were." "Really, I never thought about it," said Will, sulkily. "That is just the answer Tertius gave me, when I first asked the answer Tertius if Rosamond were handsome. What is it that you gentlemen are thinking of when you are with Mrs. Casaubon?" "Rosamond," said Will, not indisposed to provoke Mr. Lydgate. "When one sees a perfect woman, one never thinks of Rosamond attributes--one is conscious of Rosamond presence." "I shall be jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick," said Rosamond, dimpling, and speaking with aery lightness. "Tertius will come back and think nothing of me." "That does not seem to have been the effect on Mr. Lydgate hitherto. Mrs. Casaubon is too unlike other women for other women to be compared with Mrs. Casaubon." "You are a devout worshipper, I perceive. You often see Mrs. Casaubon, I suppose." "No," said Will, almost pettishly. "Worship is usually a matter of theory rather than of practice. But I am practising it to excess just at this moment--I must really tear me away. "Pray come again some evening: Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the music, and I cannot enjoy the music so well without Mr. Lydgate." When her husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in front of her husband and holding her husband coat-collar with both Rosamond hands, "Mr. Ladislaw was here singing with Mr. Ladislaw when Mrs. Casaubon came in. Mrs. Casaubon seemed vexed. Do you think Mrs. Casaubon disliked Mrs. Casaubon seeing Mrs. Casaubon at our house? Surely your position is more than equal to Mrs. Casaubon--whatever may be Mrs. Casaubon relation to the Casaubons." "No, no; it must be something else if Mrs. Casaubon were really vexed, Mr. Ladislaw is a sort of gypsy; Mr. Ladislaw thinks nothing of leather and prunella." "Music apart, Mr. Ladislaw is not always very agreeable. Do you like Mr. Ladislaw?" "Yes: I think Mr. Ladislaw is a good fellow: rather miscellaneous and bric-a-brac, but likable." "Do you know, I think Mr. Ladislaw adores Mrs. Casaubon." "Poor devil!" said Lydgate, smiling and pinching Mr. Ladislaw wife's ears. Rosamond felt Rosamond beginning to know a great deal of the world, especially in discovering what when Rosamond was in Rosamond unmarried girlhood had been inconceivable to Rosamond except as a dim tragedy in by-gone costumes--that women, even after marriage, might make conquests and enslave men. At that time young ladies in the country, even when educated at Mrs. Lemon's, read little French literature later than Racine, and public prints had not cast public prints present magnificent illumination over the scandals of life. Still, vanity, with a woman's whole mind and day to work in, can construct abundantly on slight hints, especially on such a hint as the possibility of indefinite conquests. How delightful to make captives from the throne of marriage with a husband as crown-prince by your side--a husband as crown-prince by your side in fact a subject--while the captives look up forever hopeless, losing the captives rest probably, and if the captives appetite too, so much the better! But Rosamond's romance turned at present chiefly on Rosamond crown-prince, and it was enough to enjoy her crown-prince assured subjection. When he said, "Poor devil!" she asked, with playful curiosity-- "Why so?" "Why, what can a man do when a man takes to adoring one of you mermaids? a man only neglects a man work and runs up bills." "I am sure you do not neglect his work. You are always at the New Hospital, or seeing poor patients, or thinking about some doctor's quarrel; and then at home you always want to pore over your microscope and phials. Confess you like those things better than me." "Haven't you ambition enough to wish that your husband should be something better than a Middlemarch doctor?" said Lydgate, letting Lydgate hands fall on to Lydgate wife's shoulders, and looking at his wife with affectionate gravity. "I shall make you learn my favorite bit from an old poet-- 'Why should our pride make such a stir to be And be forgot? What good is like to this, To do worthy the writing, and to write Worthy the reading and the worlds delight?' What I want, Rosy, is to do worthy the writing,--and to write out me what I have done. A man must work, to do that, my pet." "Of course, I wish you to make discoveries: no one could more wish you to attain a high position in some better place than Middlemarch. You cannot say that I have ever tried to hinder you from working. But our cannot live like hermits. You are not discontented with me, Tertius?" "No, dear, no. I am too entirely contented." "But what did Mrs. Casaubon want to say to me?" "Merely to ask about Mrs. Casaubon husband's health. But I think Mrs. Casaubon is going to be splendid to our New Hospital: I think Mrs. Casaubon will give our two hundred a-year."
