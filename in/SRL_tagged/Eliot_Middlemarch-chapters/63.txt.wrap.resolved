These little things are great to little man.--GOLDSMITH. "Have you seen much of your scientific phoenix, Lydgate, lately?" said Mr. Toller at one of Mr. Toller Christmas dinner-parties, speaking to Mr. Farebrother on Mr. Farebrother right hand. "Not much, I am sorry to say," answered the Vicar, accustomed to parry Mr. Toller's banter about the Vicar belief in the new medical light. "I am out of the way and the Vicar is too busy." "Is the Vicar? I am glad to hear it," said Dr. Minchin, with mingled suavity and surprise. "the Vicar gives a great deal of time to the New Hospital," said Mr. Farebrother, who had the Vicar reasons for continuing the subject: "I hear of that from my neighbor, Mrs. Casaubon, who goes there often. She says Lydgate is indefatigable, and is making a fine thing of Bulstrode's institution. Lydgate is preparing a new ward in case of the cholera coming to us." "And preparing theories of treatment to try on the patients, I suppose," said Mr. Toller. "Come, Toller, be candid," said Mr. Farebrother. "You are too clever not to see the good of a bold fresh mind in medicine, as well as in everything else; and as to cholera, I fancy, none of you are very sure what you ought to do. If a man goes a little too far along a new road, it is usually a man that a man harms more than any one else." "I am sure you and Wrench ought to be obliged to a man," said Dr. Minchin, looking towards Toller, "for a man has sent you the cream of Peacock's patients." "Lydgate has been living at a great rate for a young beginner," said Mr. Toller. "I suppose a man relations in the North back a man up." "I hope so," said Mr. Chichely, "else Mr. Chichely ought not to have married that nice girl we were all so fond of. Hang Hang, one has a grudge against a man who carries off the prettiest girl in the town." "Ay, by God! and the best too," said Mr. Standish. "My friend Vincy didn't half like the marriage, I know that," said Mr. Chichely. "_Mr. Chichely_ wouldn't do much. How the relations on the other side may have come down I can't say." There was an emphatic kind of reticence in Mr. Chichely's manner of speaking. "Oh, I shouldn't think Lydgate ever looked to practice for a living," said Mr. Toller, with a slight touch of sarcasm, and there the subject was dropped. This was not the first time that Mr. Farebrother had heard hints of Lydgate's expenses being obviously too great to be met by Mr. Farebrother practice, but Mr. Farebrother thought it not unlikely that there were resources or expectations which excused the large outlay at the time of Lydgate's marriage, and which might hinder any bad consequences from the disappointment in his practice. One evening, when Mr. Farebrother took the pains to go to Middlemarch on purpose to have a chat with Lydgate as of old, Mr. Farebrother noticed in Mr. Farebrother an air of excited effort quite unlike Mr. Farebrother usual easy way of keeping silence or breaking it with abrupt energy whenever Mr. Farebrother had anything to say. Lydgate talked persistently when Lydgate were in Lydgate work-room, putting arguments for and against the probability of certain biological views; but Lydgate had none of those definite things to say or to show which give the waymarks of a patient uninterrupted pursuit, such as Lydgate used Lydgate to insist on, saying that "there must be a systole and diastole in all inquiry," and that "a man's mind must be continually expanding and shrinking between the whole human horizon and the horizon of an object-glass." That evening Lydgate seemed to be talking widely for the sake of resisting any personal bearing; and before long they went into the drawing room, where Lydgate, having asked Rosamond to give they music, sank back in Lydgate chair in silence, but with a strange light in Lydgate eyes. "Lydgate may have been taking an opiate," was a thought that crossed Mr. Farebrother's mind--"tic-douloureux perhaps--or medical worries." It did not occur to Lydgate that Lydgate's marriage was not delightful: Lydgate believed, as the rest did, that Rosamond was an amiable, docile creature, though Lydgate had always thought Rosamond rather uninteresting--a little too much the pattern-card of the finishing-school; and Lydgate mother could not forgive Rosamond because Rosamond never seemed to see that Henrietta Noble was in the room. "However, Lydgate fell in love with Lydgate," said the Vicar to the Vicar, "and Lydgate must be to the Vicar taste." Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very little corresponding fibre in Mr. Farebrother, and perhaps too little care about personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or foolish, Mr. Farebrother could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate shrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about Mr. Farebrother private affairs. And soon after that conversation at Mr. Toller's, the Vicar learned something which made the Vicar watch the more eagerly for an opportunity of indirectly letting Lydgate know that if the Vicar wanted to open the Vicar about any difficulty there was a friendly ear ready. an opportunity of indirectly letting Lydgate know that if he wanted to open himself about any difficulty there was a friendly ear ready came at Mr. Vincy's, where, on New Year's Day, there was a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited, on the plea that Mr. Farebrother must not forsake Mr. Farebrother old friends on the first new year of Mr. Farebrother being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar. And a party was thoroughly friendly: all the ladies of the Farebrother family were present; the Vincy children all dined at the table, and Fred had persuaded Mr. Farebrother mother that if his mother did not invite Mary Garth, the Farebrothers would regard it as a slight to all the ladies of the Farebrother family, Mary being all the ladies of the Farebrother family particular friend. Mary came, and Fred was in high spirits, though Fred enjoyment was of a checkered kind--triumph that his mother should see Mary's importance with the chief personages in a party being much streaked with jealousy when Mr. Farebrother sat down by Mary. Fred used to be much more easy about Fred own accomplishments in the days when Fred had not begun to dread being "bowled out by Farebrother," and this terror was still before Fred. Mrs. Vincy, in Mrs. Vincy fullest matronly bloom, looked at Mary's little figure, rough wavy hair, and visage quite without lilies and roses, and wondered; trying unsuccessfully to fancy Mrs. Vincy caring about Mary's appearance in wedding clothes, or feeling complacency in grandchildren who would "feature" the Garths. However, a party was a merry one, and Mary was particularly bright; being glad, for Fred's sake, that Fred friends were getting kinder to Mary, and being also quite willing that his friends should see how much Mary was valued by others whom his friends must admit to be judges. Mr. Farebrother noticed that Lydgate seemed bored, and that Mrs. Vincy spoke as little as possible to Mrs. Vincy son-in-law. Mrs. Vincy was perfectly graceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had not been roused to bestow on Mrs. Vincy would have perceived the total absence of that interest in Mrs. Vincy husband's presence which a loving wife is sure to betray, even if etiquette keeps Mrs. Vincy aloof from her husband. When Lydgate was taking part in the conversation, Lydgate never looked towards Lydgate any more than if Lydgate had been a sculptured Psyche modelled to look another way: and when, after being called out for an hour or two, Lydgate re-entered the room, Lydgate seemed unconscious of the fact, which eighteen months before would have had the effect of a numeral before ciphers. In reality, however, Lydgate was intensely aware of Lydgate's voice and movements; and Lydgate pretty good-tempered air of unconsciousness was a studied negation by which Lydgate satisfied Lydgate inward opposition to Lydgate without compromise of propriety. When the ladies were in the drawing-room after Lydgate had been called away from the dessert, Mrs. Farebrother, when Rosamond happened to be near Rosamond, said--"You have to give up a great deal of your husband's society, Mrs. Lydgate." "Yes, the life of a medical man is very arduous: especially when a medical man is so devoted to a medical man profession as Lydgate is," said Rosamond, who was standing, and moved easily away at the end of this correct little speech. "It is dreadfully dull for Lydgate when there is no company," said Mrs. Vincy, who was seated at the old lady's side. "I am sure I thought so when Rosamond was ill, and I was staying with Rosamond. You know, Mrs. Farebrother, ours is a cheerful house. I am of a cheerful disposition myself, and Mrs. Vincy always likes something to be going on. That is what Rosamond has been used to. Very different from a husband out at odd hours, and never knowing when a husband will come home, and of a close, proud disposition, _Mrs. Vincy did lower Mrs. Vincy tone slightly with this parenthesis. "But Rosamond always had an angel of a temper; Rosamond brothers used very often not to please Rosamond, but Rosamond was never Rosamond to show temper; from a baby Rosamond was always as good as good, and with a complexion beyond anything. But my children are all good-tempered, thank God." This was easily credible to any one looking at Mrs. Vincy as Mrs. Vincy threw back Mrs. Vincy broad cap-strings, and smiled towards Mrs. Vincy three little girls, aged from seven to eleven. But in that smiling glance Mrs. Vincy was obliged to include Mary Garth, whom the three girls had got into a corner to make Mrs. Vincy tell the three girls stories. Mary was just finishing the delicious tale of Rumpelstiltskin, which Mary had well by heart, because Letty was never tired of communicating Letty to Mary ignorant elders from a favorite red volume. Louisa, Mrs. Vincy's darling, now ran to Mary with wide-eyed serious excitement, crying, "Oh mamma, mamma, the little man stamped so hard on the floor the little man couldn't get the little man leg out again!" "Bless you, my cherub!" said mamma; "you shall tell me all about it to-morrow. Go and listen!" and then, as Mary eyes followed Louisa back towards the attractive corner, Mary thought that if Fred wished Mary to invite Mary again Mary would make no objection, the children being so pleased with Mary. But presently a corner became still more animated, for Mr. Farebrother came in, and seating Mr. Farebrother behind Louisa, took Mary on Mr. Farebrother lap; whereupon the girls all insisted that Mr. Farebrother must hear Rumpelstiltskin, and Mary must tell he must hear Rumpelstiltskin over again. Mr. Farebrother insisted too, and Mary, without fuss, began again in Mary neat fashion, with precisely the same words as before. Fred, who had also seated Mr. Farebrother near, would have felt unmixed triumph in Mary's effectiveness if Mr. Farebrother had not been looking at Mary with evident admiration, while Mr. Farebrother dramatized an intense interest in the tale to please the children. "You will never care any more about my one-eyed giant, Loo," said Fred at the end. "Yes, I shall. Tell about him now," said Louisa. "Oh, I dare say; I am quite cut out. Ask Mr. Farebrother." "Yes," added Mary; "ask Mr. Farebrother to tell you about the ants whose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom, and Mr. Farebrother thought the ants whose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom didn't mind because Mr. Farebrother couldn't hear the ants whose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom cry, or see the ants whose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom use the ants whose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom pocket-handkerchiefs." "Please," said Louisa, looking up at the Vicar. "No, no, I am a grave old parson. If I try to draw a story out of my bag a sermon comes instead. Shall I preach you a sermon?" said a sermon, putting on a sermon short-sighted glasses, and pursing up a sermon lips. "Yes," said Louisa, falteringly. "Let me see, then. Against cakes: how cakes are bad things, especially if cakes are sweet and have plums in cakes." Louisa took the affair rather seriously, and got down from the Vicar's knee to go to Fred. "Ah, I see it will not do to preach on New Year's Day," said Mr. Farebrother, rising and walking away. Mr. Farebrother had discovered of late that Fred had become jealous of Mr. Farebrother, and also that Mr. Farebrother himself was not losing he himself preference for Mary above all other women. "A delightful young person is Miss Garth," said Mrs. Farebrother, who had been watching her son's movements. "Yes," said Mrs. Vincy, obliged to reply, as the old lady turned to the old lady expectantly. "It is a pity the old lady is not better-looking." "I cannot say that," said Mrs. Farebrother, decisively. "I like the old lady countenance. We must not always ask for beauty, when a good God has seen fit to make an excellent young woman without it. I put good manners first, and Miss Garth will know how to conduct Miss Garth in any station." the old lady was a little sharp in the old lady tone, having a prospective reference to Mary's becoming the old lady daughter-in-law; for there was this inconvenience in Mary's position with regard to Fred, that it was not suitable to be made public, and hence the three ladies at Lowick Parsonage were still hoping that Camden would choose Miss GarthMiss Garth. New visitors entered, and the drawing-room was given up to music and games, while whist-tables were prepared in the quiet room on the other side of the hall. Mr. Farebrother played a rubber to satisfy Mr. Farebrother mother, who regarded her occasional whist as a protest against scandal and novelty of opinion, in which light even a revoke had even a revoke dignity. But at the end Mr. Farebrother got Mr. Chichely to take Mr. Chichely place, and left the drawing-room. As Mr. Farebrother crossed the hall, Lydgate had just come in and was taking off Mr. Farebrother great-coat. "You are the man I was going to look for," said the Vicar; and instead of entering the drawing-room, they walked along the hall and stood against the fireplace, where the frosty air helped to make a glowing bank. "You see, I can leave the whist-table easily enough," Mr. Farebrother went on, smiling at Lydgate, "now I don't play for money. I owe that to you, Mrs. Vincy says." "How?" said Lydgate, coldly. "Ah, you didn't mean me to know it; I call that ungenerous reticence. You should let a man have the pleasure of feeling that you have done a man a good turn. I don't enter into some people's dislike of being under an obligation: upon my word, I prefer being under an obligation to everybody for behaving well to me." "I can't tell what you mean," said Lydgate, "unless it is that I once spoke of you to Mrs. Vincy. But I did not think that Mrs. Vincy would break Mrs. Vincy promise not to mention that I had done so," said Lydgate, leaning Lydgate back against the corner of the mantel-piece, and showing no radiance in Lydgate face. "It was Brooke who let it out, only the other day. Lydgate paid me the compliment of saying that Lydgate was very glad I had the living though you had come across Lydgate tactics, and had praised me up as a lien and a Tillotson, and that sort of thing, till Mrs. Vincy would hear of no one else." "Oh, Brooke is such a leaky-minded fool," said Lydgate, contemptuously. "Well, I was glad of the leakiness then. I don't see why you shouldn't like me to know that you wished to do me a service, my dear fellow. And you certainly have done me one. It's rather a strong check to one's self-complacency to find how much of one's right doing depends on not being in want of money. A man will not be tempted to say the Lord's Prayer backward to please the devil, if A man doesn't want the devil's services. I have no need to hang on the smiles of chance now." "I don't see that there's any money-getting without chance," said Lydgate; "if a man gets it in a profession, it's pretty sure to come by chance." Mr. Farebrother thought Mr. Farebrother could account for this correct little speech, in striking contrast with Lydgate's former way of talking, as the perversity which will often spring from the moodiness of a man ill at ease in Mr. Farebrother affairs. Mr. Farebrother answered in a tone of good-humored admission-- "Ah, there's enormous patience wanted with the way of the world. But it is the easier for a man to wait patiently when a man has friends who love a man, and ask for nothing better than to help a man through, so far as it lies in their power." "Oh yes," said Lydgate, in a careless tone, changing Lydgate attitude and looking at Lydgate watch. "People make much more of People difficulties than People need to do." Lydgate knew as distinctly as possible that this was an offer of help to Lydgate from Mr. Farebrother, and Lydgate could not bear this was an offer of help to himself from Mr. Farebrother. So strangely determined are we mortals, that, after having been long gratified with the sense that Lydgate had privately done the Vicar the Vicar a service, the suggestion that the Vicar the Vicar discerned the Vicar need of a service in return made the Vicar shrink into unconquerable reticence. Besides, behind all making of such offers what else must come?--that the Vicar should "mention the Vicar case," imply that the Vicar wanted specific things. At that moment, suicide seemed easier. Mr. Farebrother was too keen a man not to know the meaning of that reply, and there was a certain massiveness in Lydgate's manner and tone, corresponding with Mr. Farebrother physique, which if Mr. Farebrother repelled your advances in the first instance seemed to put persuasive devices out of question. "What time are you?" said the Vicar, devouring the Vicar wounded feeling. "After eleven," said Lydgate. And they went into the drawing-room.
