"'Dime; no ves aquel caballero que hacia nosotros viene sobre un caballo rucio rodado que trae puesto en la cabeza un yelmo de oro?' 'Lo que veo y columbro,' respondio Sancho, 'no es sino un hombre sobre un as no pardo como el mio, que trae sobre la cabeza una cosa que relumbra.' 'Pues ese es el yelmo de Mambrino,' dijo Don Quijote."--CERVANTES. "'Seest thou not yon cavalier who cometh toward us on a dapple-gray steed, and weareth a golden helmet?' 'What I see,' answered Sancho, 'is nothing but a man on a gray ass like my own, who carries something shiny on Sancho head.' 'Just so,' answered Don Quixote: 'and that resplendent object is the helmet of Mambrino.'" "Sir Humphry Davy?" said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in Mr. Brooke easy smiling way, taking up Sir James Chettam's remark that Mr. Brooke was studying Davy's Agricultural Chemistry. "Well, now, "Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with "Sir Humphry Davy years ago at Cartwright's, and Wordsworth was there too--the poet Wordsworth, you know. Now there was something singular. I was at Cambridge when Wordsworth was there, and I never met "Sir Humphry Davy--and I dined with "Sir Humphry Davy twenty years afterwards at Cartwright's. There's an oddity in things, now. But "Sir Humphry Davy was there: "Sir Humphry Davy was a poet too. Or, as I may say, Wordsworth was poet one, and "Sir Humphry Davy was poet two. That was true in every sense, you know." Dorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual. In the beginning of dinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the mass of a magistrate's mind fell too noticeably. Dorothea wondered how a man like Mr. Casaubon would support such triviality. Mr. Casaubon manners, Dorothea thought, were very dignified; the set of Mr. Casaubon iron-gray hair and Mr. Casaubon deep eye-sockets made Mr. Casaubon resemble the portrait of Locke. Mr. Casaubon had the spare form and the pale complexion which became a student; as different as possible from the blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type represented by Sir James Chettam. "I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry," said this excellent baronet, "because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see if something cannot be done in setting a good pattern of farming among my tenants. Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?" "A great mistake, Chettam," interposed Miss Brooke, "going into electrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of your cow-house. It won't do. I went into science a great deal myself at one time; but I saw It would not do. It leads to everything; you can let nothing alone. No, no--see that your tenants don't sell your tenants straw, and that kind of thing; and give your tenants draining-tiles, you know. But your fancy farming will not do--the most expensive sort of whistle you can buy: you may as well keep a pack of hounds." "Surely," said Dorothea, "it is better to spend money in finding out how men can make the most of the land which supports them all, than in keeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it. It is not a sin to make yourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all." Dorothea spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir James had appealed to Dorothea. Sir James was accustomed to do so, and Dorothea had often thought that Dorothea could urge Sir James to many good actions when Sir James was Dorothea brother-in-law. Mr. Casaubon turned Mr. Casaubon eyes very markedly on Dorothea while Dorothea was speaking, and seemed to observe Dorothea newly. "Young ladies don't understand political economy, you know," said Mr. Brooke, smiling towards Mr. Casaubon. "I remember when we were all reading Adam Smith. _There_ is a book, now. I took in all the new ideas at one time--human perfectibility, now. But some say, history moves in circles; and that may be very well argued; I have argued it Mr. Casaubon. The fact is, human reason may carry you a little too far--over the hedge, in fact. it carried me a good way at one time; but I saw it would not do. I pulled up; I pulled up in time. But not too hard. I have always been in favor of a little theory: we must have Thought; else we shall be landed back in the dark ages. But talking of books, there is Southey's 'Peninsular War.' I am reading that of a morning. You know Southey?" "No" said Mr. Casaubon, not keeping pace with Mr. Brooke's impetuous reason, and thinking of a book only. "I have little leisure for such literature just now. I have been using up my eyesight on old characters lately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I am fastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect reader. It is a misfortune, in some senses: I feed too much on the inward sources; I live too much with the dead. My mind is something like the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying mentally to construct the world as the world used to be, in spite of ruin and confusing changes. But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution about my eyesight." This was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. Mr. Casaubon delivered Mr. Casaubon with precision, as if Mr. Casaubon had been called upon to make a public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of Mr. Casaubon speech, occasionally corresponded to by a movement of Mr. Casaubon head, was the more conspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke's scrappy slovenliness. Dorothea said to Dorothea that Mr. Casaubon was the most interesting man Dorothea had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret, the Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the Waldenses. To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the highest purposes of truth--what a work to be in any way present at, to assist in, though only as a lamp-holder! This elevating thought lifted Dorothea above Dorothea annoyance at being twitted with Dorothea ignorance of political economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an extinguisher over all Dorothea lights. "But you are fond of riding, Dorothea," Sir James presently took an opportunity of saying. "I should have thought you would enter a little into the pleasures of hunting. I wish you would let me send over a chestnut horse for you to try. It has been trained for a lady. I saw you on Saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you. My groom shall bring Corydon for you every day, if you will only mention the time." "Thank you, you are very good. I mean to give up riding. I shall not ride any more," said Dorothea, urged to this brusque resolution by a little annoyance that Sir James would be soliciting Dorothea attention when Dorothea wanted to give it all to Mr. Casaubon. "No, that is too hard," said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that showed strong interest. "Your sister is given to self-mortification, is Your sister not?" he continued, turning to Celia, who sat at he right hand. "I think Your sister is," said Celia, feeling afraid lest Your sister should say something that would not please Your sister, and blushing as prettily as possible above Your sister necklace. "Your sister likes giving up." "If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not self-mortification. But there may be good reasons for choosing not to do what is very agreeable," said Dorothea. Mr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr. Casaubon was observing Dorothea, and Dorothea was aware of Mr. Casaubon was observing Dorothea. "Exactly," said Sir James. "You give up from some high, generous motive." "No, indeed, not exactly. I did not say that of myself," answered Dorothea, reddening. Unlike Celia, Celia rarely blushed, and only from high delight or anger. At this moment Celia felt angry with the perverse Sir James. Why did the perverse Sir James not pay attention to Celia, and leave Celia to listen to Mr. Casaubon?--if that learned man would only talk, instead of allowing the perverse Sir James to be talked to by Mr. Brooke, who was just then informing the perverse Sir James that the Reformation either meant something or the Reformation did not, that the perverse Sir James himself was a Protestant to the core, but that Catholicism was a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a Romanist chapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly speaking, was the dread of a Hereafter. "I made a great study of theology at one time," said Mr. Brooke, as if to explain the insight just manifested. "I know something of all schools. I knew Wilberforce in Wilberforce best days. Do you know Wilberforce?" Mr. Casaubon said, "No." "Well, Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker; but if I went into Parliament, as I have been asked to do, I should sit on the independent bench, as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy." Mr. Casaubon bowed, and observed that it was a wide field. "Yes," said Mr. Brooke, with an easy smile, "but I have documents. I began a long while ago to collect documents. They want arranging, but when a question has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an answer. I have documents at my back. But now, how do you arrange your documents?" "In pigeon-holes partly," said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air of effort. "Ah, pigeon-holes will not do. I have tried pigeon-holes, but everything gets mixed in pigeon-holes: I never know whether a paper is in A or Z." "I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle," said Dorothea. "I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects under each letter." Mr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, "You have an excellent secretary at hand, you perceive." "No, no," said Mr. Brooke, shaking Mr. Brooke head; "I cannot let young ladies meddle with my documents. young ladies are too flighty." Dorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that Dorothea uncle had some special reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in Mr. Casaubon mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other fragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her_. When the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said-- "How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!" "Celia! Mr. Casaubon is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw. Mr. Casaubon is remarkably like the portrait of LockeLocke. Mr. Casaubon has the same deep eye-sockets." "Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on those two white moles?" "Oh, I dare say! when people of a certain sort looked at Mr. Casaubon," said Dorothea, walking away a little. "Mr. Casaubon is so sallow." "All the better. I suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a cochon de lait." "Dodo!" exclaimed Celia, looking after Celia in surprise. "I never heard you make such a comparison before." "Why should I make it before the occasion came? It is a good comparison: the match is perfect." Miss Brooke was clearly forgetting Miss Brooke, and "Celia thought so. "I wonder you show temper, Dorothea." "It is so painful in you, "Celia, that you will look at human beings as if human beings were merely animals with a toilet, and never see the great soul in a man's face." "Has Mr. Casaubon?"Celia "Celia was not without a touch of naive malice. "Yes, I believe he has," said Dorothea, with the full voice of decision. "Everything I see in he corresponds to he pamphlet on Biblical Cosmology." "he talks very little," said "Celia "There is no one for he to talk to." "Celia thought privately, Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam; I believe "Celia would not accept Sir James Chettam." "Celia felt that this was a pity. "Celia had never been deceived as to the object of the baronet's interest. Sometimes, indeed, "Celia had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a husband happy who had not "Celia way of looking at things; and stifled in the depths of "Celia heart was the feeling that "Celia was too religious for family comfort. Notions and scruples were like spilt needles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even eating. When Miss Brooke Miss Brooke was at the tea-table, Sir James came to sit down by Miss Brooke, not having felt Miss Brooke mode of answering Sir James at all offensive. Why should Sir James? Sir James thought it probable that Miss Brooke Miss Brooke liked Sir James, and manners must be very marked indeed before they cease to be interpreted by preconceptions either confident or distrustful. Miss Brooke was thoroughly charming to Sir James, but of course Sir James theorized a little about Sir James attachment. Sir James was made of excellent human dough, and had the rare merit of knowing that Sir James talents, even if let loose, would not set the smallest stream in the county on fire: hence Sir James liked the prospect of a wife to whom Sir James could say, "What shall we do?" about this or that; who could help Miss Brooke husband out with reasons, and would also have the property qualification for doing so. As to the excessive religiousness alleged against Miss Brooke, Sir James had a very indefinite notion of what it consisted in, and thought that it would die out with marriage. In short, Sir James felt Sir James to be in love in the right place, and was ready to endure a great deal of predominance, which, after all, a man could always put down when Sir James liked. Sir James had no idea that Sir James should ever like to put down the predominance of Miss Brooke, in whose cleverness Sir James delighted. Why not? A man's mind--what there is of it--has always the advantage of being masculine,--as the smallest birch-tree is of a higher kind than the most soaring palm,--and even Sir James ignorance is of a sounder quality. Sir James might not have originated this estimate; but a kind Providence furnishes the limpest personality with a little gunk or starch in the form of tradition. "Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse, Miss Brooke," said the persevering admirer. "I assure you, riding is the most healthy of exercises." "I am aware of it," said Dorothea, coldly. "I think it would do "Celia good--if "Celia would take to it." "But you are such a perfect horsewoman." "Excuse me; I have had very little practice, and I should be easily thrown." "Then that is a reason for more practice. Every lady ought to be a perfect horsewoman, that Every lady may accompany Every lady husband." "You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that I ought not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never correspond to your pattern of a lady." Dorothea looked straight before Dorothea, and spoke with cold brusquerie, very much with the air of a handsome boy, in amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of Dorothea admirer. "I should like to know your reasons for this brusque resolution. It is not possible that you should think horsemanship wrong." "It is quite possible that I should think It wrong for me." "Oh, why?" said Sir James, in a tender tone of remonstrance. Mr. Casaubon had come up to the table, teacup in hand, and was listening. "We must not inquire too curiously into motives," Mr. Casaubon interposed, in Mr. Casaubon measured way. "Miss Brooke Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in the utterance: the aroma is mixed with the grosser air. We must keep the germinating grain away from the light." Dorothea colored with pleasure, and looked up gratefully to the speaker. Here was a man who could understand the higher inward life, and with whom there could be some spiritual communion; nay, who could illuminate principle with the widest knowledge a man whose learning almost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed! Dorothea's inferences may seem large; but really life could never have gone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions, which has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization. Has any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of pre-matrimonial acquaintanceship? "Certainly," said Sir James. "Miss Brooke Miss Brooke shall not be urged to tell reasons Miss Brooke would rather be silent upon. I am sure Miss Brooke reasons would do Miss Brooke honor." He was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had looked up at Mr. Casaubon: it never occurred to He that a girl to whom He was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm towards fifty, except, indeed, in a religious sort of way, as for a clergyman of some distinction. However, since Miss Brooke had become engaged in a conversation with Mr. Casaubon about the Vaudois clergy, Sir James betook Sir James to "Celia, and talked to "Celia about "Celia ; spoke of a house in town, and asked whether Miss Brooke Miss Brooke disliked London. Away from "Celia , "Celia talked quite easily, and Sir James said to Sir James that Mr. Brooke was certainly very agreeable as well as pretty, though not, as some people pretended, more clever and sensible than Your sister. Sir James felt that Sir James had chosen the one who was in all respects the superior; and a man naturally likes to look forward to having the best. Sir James would be the very Mawworm of bachelors who pretended not to expect it.
