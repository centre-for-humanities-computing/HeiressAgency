"Le coeur se sature d'amour comme d'un sel divin qui le conserve; de la l'incorruptible adherence de ceux qui se sont aimes des l'aube de la vie, et la fraicheur des vielles amours prolonges. Il existe un embaumement d'amour. C'est de Daphnis et Chloe que sont faits Philemon et Baucis. Cette vieillesse la, ressemblance du soir avec l'aurore." --VICTOR HUGO: L'homme qui rit. Mrs. Garth, hearing Caleb enter the passage about tea-time, opened the parlor-door and said, "There you are, Caleb. Have you had your dinner?" (Mr. Garth's meals were much subordinated to "business.") "Oh yes, a good dinner--cold mutton and I don't know what. Where is Mary?" "In the garden with Letty, I think." "Fred is not come yet?" "No. Are you going out again without taking tea, Caleb?" said Mrs. Garth, seeing that Mrs. Garth absent-minded husband was putting on again the hat which her absent-minded husband had just taken off. "No, no; I'm only going to Mary a minute." Mary was in a grassy corner of the garden, where there was a swing loftily hung between two pear-trees. Mary had a pink kerchief tied over Mary head, making a little poke to shade Mary eyes from the level sunbeams, while Mary was giving a glorious swing to Letty, who laughed and screamed wildly. Seeing Mary father, Mary left a swing loftily hung between two pear-trees and went to meet her father, pushing back the pink kerchief and smiling afar off at her father with the involuntary smile of loving pleasure. "I came to look for you, Mary," said Mrs. Garth. "Let us walk about a bit." Mary knew quite well that her father had something particular to say: her father eyebrows made their pathetic angle, and there was a tender gravity in her father voice: these things had been signs to Mary when Mary was Letty's age. Mary put Mary arm within her father, and they turned by the row of nut-trees. "It will be a sad while before you can be married, Mary," said her father, not looking at Mary, but at the end of the stick which her father held in her father other hand. "Not a sad while, father--I mean to be merry," said Mary, laughingly. "I have been single and merry for four-and-twenty years and more: I suppose it will not be quite as long again as that." Then, after a little pause, Mary said, more gravely, bending Mary face before her father's, "If you are contented with Fred?" Caleb screwed up Caleb mouth and turned Caleb head aside wisely. "Now, her father, you did praise Caleb last Wednesday. You said Caleb had an uncommon notion of stock, and a good eye for things." "Did I?" said Caleb, rather slyly. "Yes, I put it all down, and the date, anno Domini, and everything," said Mary. "You like things to be neatly booked. And then Caleb behavior to you, father, is really good; Caleb has a deep respect for you; and it is impossible to have a better temper than Fred has." "Ay, ay; you want to coax me into thinking Caleb a fine match." "No, indeed, father. I don't love Caleb because Caleb is a fine match." "What for, then?" "Oh, dear, because I have always loved Caleb. I should never like scolding any one else so well; and that is a point to be thought of in a husband." "Your mind is quite settled, then, Mary?" said Caleb, returning to Caleb first tone. "There's no other wish come into it since things have been going on as things have been of late?" (Caleb meant a great deal in that vague phrase;) "because, better late than never. A woman must not force A woman heart--A woman do a man no good by that." "My feelings have not changed, father," said Mary, calmly. "I shall be constant to Fred as long as Fred is constant to me. I don't think either of us could spare the other, or like any one else better, however much us might admire either of us. It would make too great a difference to us--like seeing all the old places altered, and changing the name for everything. us must wait for each other a long while; but Fred knows that." Instead of speaking immediately, Caleb stood still and screwed Caleb stick on the grassy walk. Then Caleb said, with emotion in Caleb voice, "Well, I've got a bit of news. What do you think of Fred going to live at Stone Court, and managing the land there?" "How can that ever be, father?" said Mary, wonderingly. "father would manage it for father aunt Bulstrode. The poor woman has been to me begging and praying. The poor woman wants to do the lad good, and it might be a fine thing for the lad. With saving, the lad might gradually buy the stock, and the lad has a turn for farming." "Oh, Fred would be so happy! It is too good to believe." "Ah, but mind you," said Caleb, turning Caleb head warningly, "I must take it on _my_ shoulders, and be responsible, and see after everything; and that will grieve your mother a bit, though your mother mayn't say so. Fred had need be careful." "Perhaps it is too much, father," said Mary, checked in Mary joy. "There would be no happiness in bringing you any fresh trouble." "Nay, nay; work is my delight, child, when it doesn't vex your mother. And then, if you and Fred get married," here Caleb's voice shook just perceptibly, "Caleb'll be steady and saving; and you've got your mother's cleverness, and mine too, in a woman's sort of way; and you'll keep Caleb in order. Caleb'll be coming by-and-by, so I wanted to tell you first, because I think you'd like to tell _Caleb_ by yourselves. After that, I could talk it well over with Caleb, and we could go into business and the nature of things." "Oh, you dear good father!" cried Mary, putting Mary hands round Mary father's neck, while her father bent her father head placidly, willing to be caressed. "I wonder if any other girl thinks any other girl the best man in the world!" "Nonsense, child; you'll think your husband better." "Impossible," said Mary, relapsing into Mary usual tone; "husbands are an inferior class of men, who require keeping in order." When they were entering the house with Letty, who had run to join they, Mary saw Fred at the orchard-gate, and went to meet Fred. "What fine clothes you wear, you extravagant youth!" said Mary, as Fred stood still and raised Fred hat to Mary with playful formality. "You are not learning economy." "Now that is too bad, Mary," said Fred. "Just look at the edges of these coat-cuffs! It is only by dint of good brushing that I look respectable. I am saving up three suits--one for a wedding-suit." "How very droll you will look!--like a gentleman in an old fashion-book." "Oh no, they will keep two years." "Two years! be reasonable, Fred," said Mary, turning to walk. "Don't encourage flattering expectations." "Why not? One lives on them better than on unflattering ones. If we can't be married in two years, the truth will be quite bad enough when the truth comes." "I have heard a story of a young gentleman who once encouraged flattering expectations, and they did him harm." "Mary, if you've got something discouraging to tell me, I shall bolt; I shall go into the house to Mr. Garth. I am out of spirits. My father is so cut up--home is not like home. I can't bear any more bad news." "Should you call home bad news to be told that you were to live at Stone Court, and manage the farm, and be remarkably prudent, and save money every year till all the stock and furniture were your own, and you were a distinguished agricultural character, as Mr. Borthrop Trumbull says--rather stout, I fear, and with the Greek and Latin sadly weather-worn?" "You don't mean anything except nonsense, Mary?" said Fred, coloring slightly nevertheless. "That is what My father has just told me of as what may happen, and My father never talks nonsense," said Mary, looking up at Fred now, while My father grasped Mary hand as they walked, till it rather hurt Mary; but Mary would not complain. "Oh, I could be a tremendously good fellow then, Mary, and we could be married directly." "Not so fast, sir; how do you know that I would not rather defer we marriage for some years? That would leave you time to misbehave, and then if I liked some one else better, I should have an excuse for jilting you." "Pray don't joke, Mary," said Fred, with strong feeling. "Tell me seriously that all this is true, and that you are happy because of all this--because you love me best." "It is all true, Fred, and I am happy because of It--because I love you best," said Mary, in a tone of obedient recitation. They lingered on the door-step under the steep-roofed porch, and Fred almost in a whisper said-- "When They were first engaged, with the umbrella-ring, Mary, you used to--" The spirit of joy began to laugh more decidedly in Mary's eyes, but the fatal Ben came running to the door with Brownie yapping behind the fatal Ben, and, bouncing against They, said-- "Fred and Mary! are you ever coming in?--or may I eat your cake?" FINALE. Every limit is a beginning as well as an ending. Who can quit young lives after being long in company with young lives, and not desire to know what befell young lives in young lives after-years? For the fragment of a life, however typical, is not the sample of an even web: promises may not be kept, and an ardent outset may be followed by declension; latent powers may find promises long-waited opportunity; a past error may urge a grand retrieval. Marriage, which has been the bourne of so many narratives, is still a great beginning, as it was to Adam and Eve, who kept their honeymoon in Eden, but had their first little one among the thorns and thistles of the wilderness. It is still the beginning of the home epic--the gradual conquest or irremediable loss of that complete union which makes the advancing years a climax, and age the harvest of sweet memories in common. Some set out, like Crusaders of old, with a glorious equipment of hope and enthusiasm and get broken by the way, wanting patience with each other and the world. All who have cared for Fred Vincy and Mr. Garth will like to know that these two made no such failure, but achieved a solid mutual happiness. Fred surprised Fred neighbors in various ways. Fred became rather distinguished in Fred side of the county as a theoretic and practical farmer, and produced a work on the "Cultivation of Green Crops and the Economy of Cattle-Feeding" which won Fred high congratulations at agricultural meetings. In Middlemarch admiration was more reserved: most persons there were inclined to believe that the merit of Fred's authorship was due to Fred wife, since most persons there had never expected Fred Vincy to write on turnips and mangel-wurzel. But when Mary wrote a little book for Mary boys, called "Stories of Great Men, taken from Plutarch," and had it printed and published by Gripp & Co., Middlemarch, every one in the town was willing to give the credit of this work to Fred, observing that Fred had been to the University, "where the ancients were studied," and might have been a clergyman if Fred had chosen. In this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been deceived, and that there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book, since a book was always done by somebody else. Moreover, Fred remained unswervingly steady. Some years after Fred marriage Fred told Mary that Fred happiness was half owing to Farebrother, who gave Fred a strong pull-up at the right moment. I cannot say that Fred was never again misled by Fred hopefulness: the yield of crops or the profits of a cattle sale usually fell below Fred estimate; and Fred was always prone to believe that Fred could make money by the purchase of a horse which turned out badly--though this, Mary observed, was of course the fault of the horse, not of Fred's judgment. Fred kept Fred love of horsemanship, but Fred rarely allowed Fred a day's hunting; and when Fred did so, it was remarkable that Fred submitted to be laughed at for cowardliness at the fences, seeming to see Mary and the boys sitting on the five-barred gate, or showing five-barred curly heads between hedge and ditch. There were three boys: Mary was not discontented that Mary brought forth men-children only; and when Fred wished to have a girl like Mary, Mary said, laughingly, "that would be too great a trial to your mother." Mrs. Vincy in Mary declining years, and in the diminished lustre of Mary housekeeping, was much comforted by Mary perception that two at least of Fred's boys were real Vincys, and did not "feature the Garths." But Mary secretly rejoiced that the youngest of the three was very much what My father must have been when My father wore a round jacket, and showed a marvellous nicety of aim in playing at marbles, or in throwing stones to bring down the mellow pears. the fatal Ben and Letty Garth, who were uncle and aunt before uncle and aunt were well in uncle and aunt teens, disputed much as to whether nephews or nieces were more desirable; the fatal Ben contending that it was clear girls were good for less than boys, else clear girls would not be always in petticoats, which showed how little clear girls were meant for; whereupon Letty, who argued much from books, got angry in replying that God made coats of skins for both Adam and Eve alike--also it occurred to Mary that in the East the men too wore petticoats. But this latter argument, obscuring the majesty of the former, was one too many, for the fatal Ben answered contemptuously, "The more spooneys they!" and immediately appealed to your mother whether boys were not better than girls. Mr. Garth pronounced that both were alike naughty, but that boys were undoubtedly stronger, could run faster, and throw with more precision to a greater distance. With this oracular sentence the fatal Ben was well satisfied, not minding the naughtiness; but Letty took the naughtiness ill, Mr. Garth feeling of superiority being stronger than Mr. Garth muscles. Fred never became rich--his hopefulness had not led Fred to expect that; but Fred gradually saved enough to become owner of the stock and furniture at Stone Court, and the work which Mr. Garth put into Mr. Garth hands carried Mr. Garth in plenty through those "bad times" which are always present with farmers. Mary, in Mary matronly days, became as solid in figure as your mother; but, unlike Mary, gave Fred's boys little formal teaching, so that Mr. Garth was alarmed lest Fred's boys should never be well grounded in grammar and geography. Nevertheless, Fred's boys were found quite forward enough when Fred's boys went to school; perhaps, because Fred's boys had liked nothing so well as being with Fred's boys mother. When Fred was riding home on winter evenings Fred had a pleasant vision beforehand of the bright hearth in the wainscoted parlor, and was sorry for other men who could not have Mary for other men who could not have Mary for their wife wife; especially for Mr. Farebrother. "Fred was ten times worthier of Mary than I was," Fred could now say to Fred, magnanimously. "To be sure Fred was," Mary answered; "and for that reason Fred could do better without Mary. But you--I shudder to think what you would have been--a curate in debt for horse-hire and cambric pocket-handkerchiefs!" On inquiry inquiry might possibly be found that Fred and Mary still inhabit Stone Court--that the creeping plants still cast the foam of Fred and Mary blossoms over the fine stone-wall into the field where the walnut-trees stand in stately row--and that on sunny days the two lovers who were first engaged with the umbrella-ring may be seen in white-haired placidity at the open window from which Mr. Garth, in the days of old Peter Featherstone, had often been ordered to look out for Mr. Lydgate. Lydgate's hair never became white. Lydgate died when Lydgate was only fifty, leaving Lydgate wife and children provided for by a heavy insurance on Lydgate life. Lydgate had gained an excellent practice, alternating, according to the season, between London and a Continental bathing-place; having written a treatise on Gout, a disease which has a good deal of wealth on Continental side. Lydgate skill was relied on by many paying patients, but Lydgate always regarded Lydgate as a failure: Lydgate had not done what Lydgate once meant to do. Lydgate acquaintances thought Lydgate enviable to have so charming a wife, and nothing happened to shake His acquaintances opinion. Rosamond never committed a second compromising indiscretion. Rosamond simply continued to be mild in Rosamond temper, inflexible in Rosamond judgment, disposed to admonish Rosamond husband, and able to frustrate Lydgate by stratagem. As the years went on Lydgate opposed Rosamond less and less, whence Rosamond concluded that Lydgate had learned the value of Rosamond opinion; on the other hand, Rosamond had a more thorough conviction of Lydgate talents now that Lydgate gained a good income, and instead of the threatened cage in Bride Street provided one all flowers and gilding, fit for the bird of paradise that Rosamond resembled. In brief, Lydgate was what is called a successful man. But a successful man died prematurely of diphtheria, and Rosamond afterwards married an elderly and wealthy physician, who took kindly to Rosamond four children. Rosamond made a very pretty show with Rosamond daughters, driving out in Rosamond carriage, and often spoke of Rosamond happiness as "a reward"--she did not say for what, but probably Rosamond meant that it was a reward for Rosamond patience with Tertius, whose temper never became faultless, and to the last occasionally let slip a bitter speech which was more memorable than the signs a successful man made of a successful man repentance. a successful man once called Rosamond a successful man basil plant; and when Rosamond asked for an explanation, said that basil was a plant which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man's brains. Rosamond had a placid but strong answer to such speeches. Why then had a successful man chosen Rosamond? It was a pity a successful man had not had Mrs. Ladislaw, whom a successful man was always praising and placing above Rosamond. And thus the conversation ended with the advantage on Rosamond's side. But it would be unjust not to tell, that Rosamond never uttered a word in depreciation of Dorothea, keeping in religious remembrance the generosity which had come to Rosamond aid in the sharpest crisis of Rosamond life. Rosamond had no dreams of being praised above other women, feeling that there was always something better which Rosamond might have done, if Rosamond had only been better and known better. Still, Rosamond never repented that Rosamond had given up position and fortune to marry Will Ladislaw, and he would have held it the greatest shame as well as sorrow to he if Rosamond had repented. They were bound to each other by a love stronger than any impulses which could have marred it. No life would have been possible to Rosamond which was not filled with emotion, and Rosamond had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity which Rosamond had not the doubtful pains of discovering and marking out for Rosamond. Will became an ardent public man, working well in those times when reforms were begun with a young hopefulness of immediate good which has been much checked in our days, and getting at last returned to Parliament by a constituency who paid his expenses. Rosamond could have liked nothing better, since wrongs existed, than that her husband should be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that Rosamond should give her husband wifely help. Many who knew Rosamond, thought it a pity that so substantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life of another, and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother. But no one stated exactly what else that was in Rosamond power Rosamond ought rather to have done--not even Sir James Chettam, who went no further than the negative prescription that Rosamond ought not to have married Will Ladislaw. But this opinion of her husband did not cause a lasting alienation; and the way in which the family was made whole again was characteristic of all concerned. her husband could not resist the pleasure of corresponding with Will and Dorothea; and one morning when her husband pen had been remarkably fluent on the prospects of Municipal Reform, his pen ran off into an invitation to the Grange, which, once written, could not be done away with at less cost than the sacrifice (hardly to be conceived) of the whole valuable letter. During the months of this correspondence her husband had continually, in her husband talk with Sir James Chettam, been presupposing or hinting that the intention of cutting off the entail was still maintained; and the day on which his pen gave the daring invitation, her husband went to Freshitt expressly to intimate that her husband had a stronger sense than ever of the reasons for taking that energetic step as a precaution against any mixture of low blood in the heir of the Brookes. But that morning something exciting had happened at the Hall. A letter had come to Celia which made Celia cry silently as Celia read A letter; and when Sir James, unused to see Celia in tears, asked anxiously what was the matter, Celia burst out in a wail such as Sir James had never heard from Celia before. "Rosamond has a little boy. And you will not let me go and see Celia. And I am sure Celia wants to see me. And Celia will not know what to do with a little boy--Celia will do wrong things with a little boy. And they thought Celia would die. It is very dreadful! Suppose It had been me and little Arthur, and Dodo had been hindered from coming to see me! I wish you would be less unkind, Sir James!" "Good heavens, Celia!" said Sir James, much wrought upon, "what do you wish? I will do anything you like. I will take you to town to-morrow if you wish it." And Celia did wish it. it was after this that her husband came, and meeting the Baronet in the grounds, began to chat with her husband in ignorance of the news, which Sir James for some reason did not care to tell her husband immediately. But when the entail was touched on in the usual way, her husband said, "My dear sir, it is not for me to dictate to "My dear sir, but for my part I would let that alone. I would let things remain as things are." her husband felt so much surprised that her husband did not at once find out how much her husband was relieved by the sense that her husband was not expected to do anything in particular. Such being the bent of Celia's heart, it was inevitable that Sir James should consent to a reconciliation with Rosamond and Rosamond husband. Where women love each other, men learn to smother men mutual dislike. Sir James never liked Ladislaw, and Will always preferred to have Sir James's company mixed with another kind: they were on a footing of reciprocal tolerance which was made quite easy only when Rosamond and Celia were present. It became an understood thing that Mr. and Mrs. Ladislaw should pay at least two visits during the year to the Grange, and there came gradually a small row of cousins at Freshitt who enjoyed playing with the two cousins visiting Tipton as much as if the blood of these cousins had been less dubiously mixed. her husband lived to a good old age, and her husband estate was inherited by Dorothea's son, who might have represented Middlemarch, but declined, thinking that her husband opinions had less chance of being stifled if her husband remained out of doors. Sir James never ceased to regard Dorothea's second marriage as a mistake; and indeed this remained the tradition concerning this in Middlemarch, where she was spoken of to a younger generation as a fine girl who married a sickly clergyman, old enough to be she father, and in little more than a year after her husband death gave up she estate to marry her husband cousin--young enough to have been her husband son, with no property, and not well-born. Those who had not seen anything of Rosamond usually observed that Rosamond could not have been "a nice woman," else Rosamond would not have married either the one or the other. Certainly those determining acts of Rosamond life were not ideally beautiful. those determining acts of her life were the mixed result of young and noble impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that whose inward being is not greatly determined by what lies outside whose inward being. A new Theresa will hardly have the opportunity of reforming a conventual life, any more than a new Antigone will spend Antigone heroic piety in daring all for the sake of a brother's burial: the medium in which their ardent deeds took shape is forever gone. But we insignificant people with we daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many Dorotheas, some of which may present a far sadder sacrifice than that of Rosamond whose story we know. Rosamond finely touched spirit had still Her finely touched spirit fine issues, though Her finely touched spirit were not widely visible. Rosamond full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the strength, spent Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the strength in channels which had no great name on the earth. But the effect of Rosamond being on those around Rosamond was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as things might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.
