If it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss Brooke as a suitable wife for Mr. Casaubon, the reasons that might induce Miss Brooke to accept Mr. Casaubon were already planted in Miss Brooke mind, and by the evening of the next day the reasons that might induce her to accept him had budded and bloomed.
For they had had a long conversation in the morning, while Celia, who did not like the company of Mr. Casaubon's moles and sallowness, had escaped to the vicarage to play with the curate's ill-shod but merry children.
Dorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of Mr. Casaubon's mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine extension every quality Dorothea herself brought; had opened much of Dorothea own experience to Mr. Casaubon, and had understood from Mr. Casaubon the scope of Mr. Casaubon great work, also of attractively labyrinthine extent.
For Mr. Casaubon had been as instructive as Milton's "affable archangel;" and with something of the archangelic manner Mr. Casaubon told Dorothea how Mr. Casaubon had undertaken to show (what indeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness, justice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr. Casaubon aimed) that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical fragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally revealed.
Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm footing there, the vast field of mythical constructions became intelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of correspondences.
But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no light or speedy work.
Mr. Casaubon notes already made a formidable range of volumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous still-accumulating results and bring these voluminous still-accumulating results, like the earlier vintage of Hippocratic books, to fit a little shelf.
In explaining this to Dorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed Mr. Casaubon nearly as Mr. Casaubon would have done to a fellow-student, for Mr. Casaubon had not two styles of talking at command: it is true that when Mr. Casaubon used a Greek or Latin phrase Mr. Casaubon always gave the English with scrupulous care, but Mr. Casaubon would probably have done this in any case.
A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of A learned provincial clergyman acquaintances as of "lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men, that conne Latyn but lytille."
Dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this conception.
Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies' school literature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile complete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine who united the glories of doctor and saint.
The sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning, for when Dorothea was impelled to open Dorothea mind on certain themes which Dorothea could speak of to no one whom Dorothea had before seen at Tipton, especially on the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of belief compared with that spiritual religion, that submergence of self in communion with Divine perfection which seemed to Dorothea to be expressed in the best Christian books of widely distant ages, Dorothea found in Mr. Casaubon a listener who understood Dorothea at once, who could assure Dorothea of Mr. Casaubon own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise conformity, and could mention historical examples before unknown to Dorothea.
"Mr. Casaubon thinks with me," said Dorothea to Dorothea, "or rather, Mr. Casaubon thinks a whole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror.
And Mr. Casaubon feelings too, Mr. Casaubon whole experience--what a lake compared with my little pool!"
Miss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly than other young ladies of Miss Brooke age.
Signs are small measurable things, but interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent nature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a sky, and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of knowledge.
They are not always too grossly deceived; for Sinbad himself may have fallen by good-luck on a true description, and wrong reasoning sometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions: starting a long way off the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we now and then arrive just where we ought to be.
Because Miss Brooke Miss Brooke was hasty in Miss Brooke trust, it is not therefore clear that Mr. Casaubon was unworthy of it.
Mr. Casaubon stayed a little longer than Mr. Casaubon had intended, on a slight pressure of invitation from Mr. Brooke, who offered no bait except Mr. Casaubon own documents on machine-breaking and rick-burning.
Mr. Casaubon was called into the library to look at these in a heap, while Mr. Casaubon host picked up first one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and uncertain way, passing from one unfinished passage to another with a "Yes, now, but here!"
and finally pushing them all aside to open the journal of Mr. Casaubon youthful Continental travels.
"Look here--here is all about Greece.
Rhamnus, the ruins of Rhamnus--you are a great Grecian, now.
I don't know whether you have given much study to the topography.
I spent no end of time in making out these things--Helicon, now.
Here, now!--'We started the next morning for Parnassus, the double-peaked Parnassus.'
All this volume is about Greece, you know," Mr. Brooke wound up, rubbing " Mr. Brooke thumb transversely along the edges of the leaves as " Mr. Brooke held the book forward.
Mr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience; bowed in the right place, and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as possible, without showing disregard or impatience; mindful that this desultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country, and that the man who took Mr. Casaubon on this severe mental scamper was not only an amiable host, but a landholder and custos rotulorum.
Was Mr. Casaubon endurance aided also by the reflection that " Mr. Brooke was the uncle of Dorothea?
Certainly Mr. Casaubon seemed more and more bent on making her talk to Mr. Casaubon, on drawing her out, as Celia remarked to her; and in looking at her Mr. Casaubon face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine.
Before Mr. Casaubon left the next morning, while taking a pleasant walk with Miss Brooke along the gravelled terrace, Mr. Casaubon had mentioned to Miss Brooke that Mr. Casaubon felt the disadvantage of loneliness, the need of that cheerful companionship with which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils of maturity.
And Mr. Casaubon delivered this statement with as much careful precision as if Mr. Casaubon had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be attended with results.
Indeed, Mr. Casaubon was not used to expect that Mr. Casaubon should have to repeat or revise Mr. Casaubon communications of a practical or personal kind.
The inclinations which Mr. Casaubon had deliberately stated on the 2d of October Mr. Casaubon would think it enough to refer to by the mention of that date; judging by the standard of Mr. Casaubon own memory, which was a volume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions, and not the ordinary long-used blotting-book which only tells of forgotten writing.
But in this case Mr. Casaubon's confidence was not likely to be falsified, for Dorothea heard and retained what Dorothea said with the eager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in experience is an epoch.
It was three o'clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr. Casaubon drove off to Mr. Casaubon Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from Tipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along the shrubbery and across the park that her might wander through the bordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk, the Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in care walks.
There had risen before her the girl's vision of a possible future for her to which her looked forward with trembling hope, and her wanted to wander on in that visionary future without interruption.
her walked briskly in the brisk air, the color rose in her cheeks, and her straw bonnet (which our contemporaries might look at with conjectural curiosity as at an obsolete form of basket) fell a little backward.
her would perhaps be hardly characterized enough if it were omitted that her wore her brown hair flatly braided and coiled behind so as to expose the outline of her head in a daring manner at a time when public feeling required the meagreness of nature to be dissimulated by tall barricades of frizzed curls and bows, never surpassed by any great race except the Feejeean.
This was a trait of Miss Brooke's asceticism.
But there was nothing of an ascetic's expression in her bright full eyes, as her looked before her, not consciously seeing, but absorbing into the intensity of her mood, the solemn glory of the afternoon with its long swathes of light between the far-off rows of limes, whose shadows touched each other.
All people, young or old (that is, all people in those ante-reform times), would have thought her an interesting object if all people in those ante-reform times) had referred the glow in her eyes and cheeks to the newly awakened ordinary images of young love: the illusions of Chloe about Strephon have been sufficiently consecrated in poetry, as the pathetic loveliness of all spontaneous trust ought to be.
Miss Pippin adoring young Pumpkin, and dreaming along endless vistas of unwearying companionship, was a little drama which never tired our fathers and mothers, and had been put into all costumes.
Let but young Pumpkin have a figure which would sustain the disadvantages of the shortwaisted swallow-tail, and everybody felt it not only natural but necessary to the perfection of womanhood, that a sweet girl should be at once convinced of his virtue, his exceptional ability, and above all, his perfect sincerity.
But perhaps no persons then living--certainly none in the neighborhood of Tipton--would have had a sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions about marriage took no persons then living--certainly none in the neighborhood of Tipton-- color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm about the ends of life, an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its own fire, and included neither the niceties of the trousseau, the pattern of plate, nor even the honors and sweet joys of the blooming matron.
It had now entered Dorothea's mind that Mr. Casaubon might wish to make Mr. Casaubon Mr. Casaubon wife, and the idea that Mr. Casaubon would do so touched Mr. Casaubon with a sort of reverential gratitude.
How good of Mr. Casaubon--nay, it would be almost as if a winged messenger had suddenly stood beside Mr. Casaubon path and held out Mr. Casaubon hand towards Mr. Casaubon!
For a long while Mr. Casaubon had been oppressed by the indefiniteness which hung in Mr. Casaubon mind, like a thick summer haze, over all Mr. Casaubon desire to make Mr. Casaubon life greatly effective.
What could Mr. Casaubon do, what ought Mr. Casaubon to do?--she, hardly more than a budding woman, but yet with an active conscience and a great mental need, not to be satisfied by a girlish instruction comparable to the nibblings and judgments of a discursive mouse.
With some endowment of stupidity and conceit, Mr. Casaubon might have thought that a Christian young lady of fortune should find Mr. Casaubon ideal of life in village charities, patronage of the humbler clergy, the perusal of "Female Scripture Characters," unfolding the private experience of Sara under the Old Dispensation, and Dorcas under the New, and the care of Mr. Casaubon soul over Mr. Casaubon embroidery in Mr. Casaubon own boudoir--with a background of prospective marriage to a man who, if less strict than Mr. Casaubon, as being involved in affairs religiously inexplicable, might be prayed for and seasonably exhorted.
From such contentment poor Dorothea was shut out.
The intensity of Mr. Casaubon religious disposition, the coercion it exercised over Mr. Casaubon life, was but one aspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic, and intellectually consequent: and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow teaching, hemmed in by a social life which seemed nothing but a labyrinth of petty courses, a walled-in maze of small paths that led no whither, the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration and inconsistency.
The thing which seemed to Mr. Casaubon best, Mr. Casaubon wanted to justify by the completest knowledge; and not to live in a pretended admission of rules which were never acted on.
Into this soul-hunger as yet all Mr. Casaubon youthful passion was poured; the union which attracted Mr. Casaubon was one that would deliver Mr. Casaubon from Mr. Casaubon girlish subjection to Mr. Casaubon own ignorance, and give Mr. Casaubon the freedom of voluntary submission to a guide who would take Mr. Casaubon along the grandest path.
"I should learn everything then," Mr. Casaubon said to Mr. Casaubon, still walking quickly along the bridle road through the bordering wood.
"It would be my duty to study that I might help my duty the better in my duty great works.
There would be nothing trivial about our lives.
Every-day things with our would mean the greatest things.
It would be like marrying Pascal.
I should learn to see the truth by the same light as great men have seen the truth by.
And then I should know what to do, when I got older: I should see how it was possible to lead a grand life here--now--in England.
I don't feel sure about doing good in any way now: everything seems like going on a mission to a people whose language I don't know;--unless it were building good cottages--there can be no doubt about that.
Oh, I hope I should be able to get the people well housed in Lowick!
I will draw plenty of plans while I have time."
Dorothea checked Dorothea suddenly with self-rebuke for the presumptuous way in which Dorothea was reckoning on uncertain events, but Dorothea was spared any inward effort to change the direction of Dorothea thoughts by the appearance of a cantering horseman round a turning of the road.
The well-groomed chestnut horse and two beautiful setters could leave no doubt that the rider was Sir James Chettam.
Sir James Chettam discerned Dorothea, jumped off Sir James Chettam horse at once, and, having delivered his horse to Sir James Chettam groom, advanced towards his groom with something white on Sir James Chettam arm, at which the two setters were barking in an excited manner.
"How delightful to meet you, Miss Brooke," Sir James Chettam said, raising Sir James Chettam hat and showing Sir James Chettam sleekly waving blond hair.
"It has hastened the pleasure I was looking forward to."
Miss Brooke Miss Brooke was annoyed at the interruption.
This amiable baronet, really a suitable husband for Celia, exaggerated the necessity of making himself agreeable to the elder sister.
Even a prospective brother-in-law may be an oppression if prospective brother-in-law will always be presupposing too good an understanding with you, and agreeing with you even when you contradict prospective brother-in-law.
The thought that prospective brother-in-law had made the mistake of paying prospective brother-in-law addresses to Miss Brooke could not take shape: all Miss Brooke mental activity was used up in persuasions of another kind.
But prospective brother-in-law was positively obtrusive at this moment, and prospective brother-in-law dimpled hands were quite disagreeable.
Miss Brooke roused temper made Miss Brooke color deeply, as Miss Brooke returned prospective brother-in-law greeting with some haughtiness.
Sir James interpreted her color in the way most gratifying to Sir James, and thought Sir James never saw Miss Brooke Miss Brooke looking so handsome.
"I have brought a little petitioner," Sir James said, "or rather, I have brought Sir James to see if Sir James will be approved before Sir James petition is offered."
Sir James showed the white object under Sir James arm, which was a tiny Maltese puppy, one of nature's most naive toys.
"It is painful to Sir James to see these creatures that are bred merely as pets," said Dorothea, whose opinion was forming whose opinion that very moment (as opinions will) under the heat of irritation.
"Oh, why?"
said Sir James, as they walked forward.
"I believe all the petting that is given they does not make they happy.
they are too helpless: they lives are too frail.
A weasel or a mouse that gets its own living is more interesting.
I like to think that the animals about us have souls something like us own, and either carry on the animals about us own little affairs or can be companions to us, like Monk here.
Those creatures are parasitic."
"I am so glad I know that you do not like Those creatures," said Sir James.
"I should never keep Those creatures for Sir James, but ladies usually are fond of these Maltese dogs.
Here, John, take this dog, will you?"
The objectionable puppy, whose nose and eyes were equally black and expressive, was thus got rid of, since Miss Brooke Miss Brooke decided that it had better not have been born.
But Miss Brooke felt it necessary to explain.
"You must not judge of Celia's feeling from mine.
I think Miss Brooke likes these small pets.
Miss Brooke had a tiny terrier once, which Miss Brooke was very fond of.
It made me unhappy, because I was afraid of treading on It.
I am rather short-sighted."
"You have your own opinion about everything, Miss Brooke, and it is always a good opinion."
What answer was possible to such stupid complimenting?
"Do you know, I envy you that," Sir James said, as they continued walking at the rather brisk pace set by Dorothea.
"I don't quite understand what you mean."
"Your power of forming an opinion.
I can form an opinion of persons.
I know when I like people.
But about other matters, do you know, I have often a difficulty in deciding.
One hears very sensible things said on opposite sides."
"Or that seem sensible.
Perhaps we don't always discriminate between sense and nonsense."
Dorothea felt that Dorothea was rather rude.
"Exactly," said Sir James.
"But you seem to have the power of discrimination."
"On the contrary, I am often unable to decide.
But that is from ignorance.
The right conclusion is there all the same, though I am unable to see The right conclusion."
"I think there are few who would see The right conclusion more readily.
Do you know, Lovegood was telling me yesterday that you had the best notion in the world of a plan for cottages--quite wonderful for a young lady, Lovegood thought.
You had a real _genus_, to use a real _genus_ expression.
a real _genus_ said you wanted Miss Brooke to build a new set of cottages, but a real _genus_ seemed to think it hardly probable that your uncle would consent.
Do you know, that is one of the things I wish to do--I mean, on my own estate.
I should be so glad to carry out that plan of yours, if you would let me see that plan of yours.
Of course, that plan of yours is sinking money; that is why people object to that plan of yours.
Laborers can never pay rent to make that plan of yours answer.
But, after all, it is worth doing."
"Worth doing!
yes, indeed," said Dorothea, energetically, forgetting Dorothea previous small vexations.
"I think we deserve to be beaten out of we beautiful houses with a scourge of small cords--all of we who let tenants live in such sties as we see round we.
Life in cottages might be happier than we, if Life in cottages were real houses fit for human beings from whom we expect duties and affections."
"Will you show me your plan?"
"Yes, certainly.
I dare say your plan is very faulty.
But I have been examining all the plans for cottages in Loudon's book, and picked out what seem the best things.
Oh what a happiness it would be to set the pattern about here!
I think instead of Lazarus at the gate, we should put cottages in Loudon's book outside the gate."
Dorothea was in the best temper now.
Sir James, as brother in-law, building model cottages on his estate, and then, perhaps, others being built at Lowick, and more and more elsewhere in imitation--it would be as if the spirit of Oberlin had passed over the parishes to make the life of poverty beautiful!
Sir James saw all the plans, and took one away to consult upon with Lovegood.
Sir James also took away a complacent sense that Sir James was making great progress in Miss Brooke's good opinion.
The Maltese puppy was not offered to Celia; an omission which Dorothea afterwards thought of with surprise; but Dorothea blamed Dorothea for The Maltese puppy was not offered to Celia; an omission which Dorothea afterwards thought of with surprise.
Dorothea had been engrossing Sir James.
After all, it was a relief that there was no puppy to tread upon.
Dorothea was present while all the plans were being examined, and observed Sir James's illusion.
"Sir James thinks that Dodo cares about Dodo, and Dorothea only cares about all the plans.
Yet I am not certain that Dorothea would refuse Dodo if Dorothea thought Dodo would let Dorothea manage everything and carry out all Dorothea notions.
And how very uncomfortable Sir James Sir James would be!
I cannot bear notions."
It was Celia's private luxury to indulge in this dislike.
Dorothea dared not confess It to Dorothea sister in any direct statement, for that would be laying Dorothea open to a demonstration that Dorothea was somehow or other at war with all goodness.
But on safe opportunities, Dorothea had an indirect mode of making Dorothea negative wisdom tell upon Dorothea, and calling Dorothea down from Dorothea rhapsodic mood by reminding Dorothea that people were staring, not listening.
Dorothea was not impulsive: what Dorothea had to say could wait, and came from Dorothea always with the same quiet staccato evenness.
When people talked with energy and emphasis Dorothea watched people faces and features merely.
Dorothea never could understand how well-bred persons consented to sing and open how well-bred persons mouths in the ridiculous manner requisite for that vocal exercise.
It was not many days before Mr. Casaubon paid a morning visit, on which Mr. Casaubon was invited again for the following week to dine and stay the night.
Thus Dorothea had three more conversations with Dorothea, and was convinced that Dorothea first impressions had been just.
Dorothea was all Dorothea had at first imagined Dorothea to be: almost everything Dorothea had said seemed like a specimen from a mine, or the inscription on the door of a museum which might open on the treasures of past ages; and this trust in Dorothea mental wealth was all the deeper and more effective on Dorothea inclination because it was now obvious that Dorothea visits were made for Dorothea sake.
This accomplished man condescended to think of a young girl, and take the pains to talk to a young girl, not with absurd compliment, but with an appeal to a young girl understanding, and sometimes with instructive correction.
What delightful companionship!
Mr. Casaubon seemed even unconscious that trivialities existed, and never handed round that small-talk of heavy men which is as acceptable as stale bride-cake brought forth with an odor of cupboard.
Mr. Casaubon talked of what Mr. Casaubon was interested in, or else Mr. Casaubon was silent and bowed with sad civility.
To Dorothea this was adorable genuineness, and religious abstinence from that artificiality which uses up the soul in the efforts of pretence.
For Dorothea looked as reverently at Mr. Casaubon's religious elevation above Dorothea as Dorothea did at Mr. Casaubon intellect and learning.
Mr. Casaubon assented to Dorothea expressions of devout feeling, and usually with an appropriate quotation; Mr. Casaubon allowed Mr. Casaubon to say that Mr. Casaubon had gone through some spiritual conflicts in Mr. Casaubon youth; in short, Dorothea saw that here Dorothea might reckon on understanding, sympathy, and guidance.
On one--only one--of Dorothea favorite themes Dorothea was disappointed.
Mr. Casaubon apparently did not care about building cottages, and diverted the talk to the extremely narrow accommodation which was to be had in the dwellings of the ancient Egyptians, as if to check a too high standard.
After Mr. Casaubon was gone, Dorothea dwelt with some agitation on this indifference of Mr. Casaubon; and Dorothea mind was much exercised with arguments drawn from the varying conditions of climate which modify human needs, and from the admitted wickedness of pagan despots.
Should Dorothea not urge these arguments on Mr. Casaubon when Mr. Casaubon came again?
But further reflection told Dorothea that Dorothea was presumptuous in demanding Mr. Casaubon attention to such a subject; Mr. Casaubon would not disapprove of Dorothea occupying Dorothea with it in leisure moments, as other women expected to occupy other women with other women dress and embroidery--would not forbid it when--Dorothea felt rather ashamed as Dorothea detected Dorothea in these speculations.
But your uncle had been invited to go to Lowick to stay a couple of days: was it reasonable to suppose that Mr. Casaubon delighted in Mr. Brooke's society for it own sake, either with or without documents?
Meanwhile that little disappointment made Dorothea delight the more in Sir James Chettam's readiness to set on foot the desired improvements.
He came much oftener than Mr. Casaubon, and Dorothea ceased to find He disagreeable since He showed He so entirely in earnest; for He had already entered with much practical ability into Lovegood's estimates, and was charmingly docile.
Dorothea proposed to build a couple of cottages, and transfer two families from two families old cabins, which could then be pulled down, so that new ones could be built on the old sites.
Sir James said "Exactly," and Dorothea bore the word remarkably well.
Certainly these men who had so few spontaneous ideas might be very useful members of society under good feminine direction, if these men who had so few spontaneous ideas were fortunate in choosing these men who had so few spontaneous ideas sisters-in-law!
It is difficult to say whether there was or was not a little wilfulness in Dorothea continuing blind to the possibility that another sort of choice was in question in relation to Dorothea.
But Dorothea life was just now full of hope and action: Dorothea was not only thinking of all the plans, but getting down learned books from the library and reading many things hastily (that Dorothea might be a little less ignorant in talking to Mr. Casaubon), all the while being visited with conscientious questionings whether Dorothea were not exalting these poor doings above measure and contemplating these poor doings with that self-satisfaction which was the last doom of ignorance and folly.
