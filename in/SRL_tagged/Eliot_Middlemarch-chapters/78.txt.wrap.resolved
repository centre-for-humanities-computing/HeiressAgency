"Would it were yesterday and I i' the grave, With her sweet faith above for monument" Rosamond and Will stood motionless--they did not know how long--" Rosamond looking towards the spot where Dorothea had stood, and " Rosamond looking towards " Rosamond with doubt. It seemed an endless time to Rosamond, in whose inmost soul there was hardly so much annoyance as gratification from what had just happened. Shallow natures dream of an easy sway over the emotions of others, trusting implicitly in their own petty magic to turn the deepest streams, and confident, by pretty gestures and remarks, of making the thing that is not as though it were. " Rosamond knew that Will had received a severe blow, but " Rosamond had been little used to imagining other people's states of mind except as a material cut into shape by " Rosamond own wishes; and " Rosamond believed in " Rosamond own power to soothe or subdue. Even Tertius, that most perverse of men, was always subdued in the long-run: events had been obstinate, but still Rosamond would have said now, as Rosamond did before Rosamond marriage, that Rosamond never gave up what Rosamond had set Rosamond mind on. Rosamond put out Rosamond arm and laid the tips of Rosamond fingers on Will's coat-sleeve. "Don't touch me!" he said, with an utterance like the cut of a lash, darting from Rosamond, and changing from pink to white and back again, as if he whole frame were tingling with the pain of the sting. he wheeled round to the other side of the room and stood opposite to Rosamond, with the tips of he fingers in he pockets and he head thrown back, looking fiercely not at Rosamond but at a point a few inches away from Rosamond. Rosamond was keenly offended, but the Signs Rosamond made of this were such as only Lydgate was used to interpret. Rosamond became suddenly quiet and seated Rosamond, untying Rosamond hanging bonnet and laying her hanging bonnet down with Rosamond shawl. Rosamond little hands which Rosamond folded before Rosamond were very cold. It would have been safer for Will in the first instance to have taken up his hat and gone away; but his had felt no impulse to do this; on the contrary, his had a horrible inclination to stay and shatter Rosamond with his anger. It seemed as impossible to bear the fatality Rosamond had drawn down on his without venting his fury as it would be to a panther to bear the javelin-wound without springing and biting. And yet--how could his tell a woman that his was ready to curse a woman? his was fuming under a repressive law which his was forced to acknowledge: his was dangerously poised, and Rosamond's voice now brought the decisive vibration. In flute-like tones of sarcasm a woman said-- "You can easily go after Mrs. Casaubon and explain your preference." "Go after Mrs. Casaubon!" his burst out, with a sharp edge in Rosamond's voice. "Do you think Mrs. Casaubon would turn to look at his, or value any word I ever uttered to Mrs. Casaubon again at more than a dirty feather?--Explain! How can a man explain at the expense of a woman?" "You can tell Mrs. Casaubon what you please," said Rosamond with more tremor. "Do you suppose Mrs. Casaubon would like me better for sacrificing you? Mrs. Casaubon is not a woman to be flattered because I made his despicable--to believe that I must be true to Mrs. Casaubon because I was a dastard to you." his began to move about with the restlessness of a wild animal that sees prey but cannot reach it. Presently his burst out again-- "I had no hope before--not much--of anything better to come. But I had one certainty--that Mrs. Casaubon believed in his. Whatever people had said or done about his, Mrs. Casaubon believed in me.--That's gone! Mrs. Casaubon'll never again think me anything but a paltry pretence--too nice to take heaven except upon flattering conditions, and yet selling his for any devil's change by the sly. Mrs. Casaubon'll think of his as an incarnate insult to Mrs. Casaubon, from the first moment we--" Will stopped as if his had found his grasping something that must not be thrown and shattered. his found another vent for his rage by snatching up Rosamond's words again, as if they were reptiles to be throttled and flung off. "Explain! Tell a man to explain how his dropped into hell! Explain my preference! I never had a _preference_ for Mrs. Casaubon, any more than I have a preference for breathing. No other woman exists by the side of No other woman. I would rather touch No other woman hand if her hand were dead, than I would touch any other woman's living." Rosamond, while these poisoned weapons were being hurled at Rosamond, was almost losing the sense of Rosamond identity, and seemed to be waking into some new terrible existence. Rosamond had no sense of chill resolute repulsion, of reticent self-justification such as Rosamond had known under Lydgate's most stormy displeasure: all Rosamond sensibility was turned into a bewildering novelty of pain; Rosamond felt a new terrified recoil under a lash never experienced before. What another nature felt in opposition to Rosamond own was being burnt and bitten into Rosamond consciousness. When Will had ceased to speak Rosamond had become an image of sickened misery: Rosamond lips were pale, and Rosamond eyes had a tearless dismay in them. If it had been Tertius who stood opposite to Rosamond, that look of misery would have been a pang to Tertius who stood opposite to her, and Tertius who stood opposite to her would have sunk by Rosamond side to comfort Rosamond, with that strong-armed comfort which, Rosamond had often held very cheap. Let it be forgiven to Will that Tertius who stood opposite to her had no such movement of pity. Tertius who stood opposite to her had felt no bond beforehand to this woman who had spoiled the ideal treasure of Tertius who stood opposite to her life, and Tertius who stood opposite to her held Tertius who stood opposite to her blameless. Tertius who stood opposite to her knew that Tertius who stood opposite to her was cruel, but Tertius who stood opposite to her had no relenting in Tertius who stood opposite to her yet. After Tertius who stood opposite to her had done speaking, Tertius who stood opposite to her still moved about, half in absence of mind, and Rosamond sat perfectly still. At length Will, seeming to bethink Tertius who stood opposite to her, took up Tertius who stood opposite to her hat, yet stood some moments irresolute. Tertius who stood opposite to her had spoken to Rosamond in a way that made a phrase of common politeness difficult to utter; and yet, now that Tertius who stood opposite to her had come to the point of going away from Rosamond without further speech, Tertius who stood opposite to her shrank from further speech as a brutality; Tertius who stood opposite to her felt checked and stultified in Tertius who stood opposite to her anger. Tertius who stood opposite to her walked towards the mantel-piece and leaned Tertius who stood opposite to her arm on the mantel-piece, and waited in silence for--Tertius who stood opposite to her hardly knew what. The vindictive fire was still burning in Tertius who stood opposite to her, and Tertius who stood opposite to her could utter no word of retractation; but it was nevertheless in Tertius who stood opposite to her mind that having come back to this hearth where Tertius who stood opposite to her had enjoyed a caressing friendship Tertius who stood opposite to her had found calamity seated there--Tertius who stood opposite to her had had suddenly revealed to Tertius who stood opposite to her a trouble that lay outside the home as well as within the home. And what seemed a foreboding was pressing upon Tertius who stood opposite to her as with slow pincers:--that Tertius who stood opposite to her life might come to be enslaved by this helpless woman who had thrown herself upon Tertius who stood opposite to her in the dreary sadness of herself heart. But Tertius who stood opposite to her was in gloomy rebellion against the fact that Tertius who stood opposite to her quick apprehensiveness foreshadowed to Tertius who stood opposite to her, and when Tertius who stood opposite to her eyes fell on Rosamond's blighted face it seemed to Tertius who stood opposite to her that Tertius who stood opposite to her was the more pitiable of the two; for pain must enter into he was the more pitiable of the two glorified life of memory before he was the more pitiable of the two can turn into compassion. And so they remained for many minutes, opposite each other, far apart, in silence; Will's face still possessed by a mute rage, and Rosamond's by a mute misery. The poor thing had no force to fling out any passion in return; the terrible collapse of the illusion towards which all her hope had been strained was a stroke which had too thoroughly shaken her: her little world was in ruins, and her felt her tottering in the midst as a lonely bewildered consciousness. Will wished that her would speak and bring some mitigating shadow across his own cruel speech, which seemed to stand staring at them both in mockery of any attempt at revived fellowship. But her said nothing, and at last with a desperate effort over himself, himself asked, "Shall I come in and see Lydgate this evening?" "If you like," Rosamond answered, just audibly. And then Will went out of the house, her never knowing that her had been in. After her was gone, Rosamond tried to get up from Rosamond seat, but fell back fainting. When Rosamond came to Rosamond again, Rosamond felt too ill to make the exertion of rising to ring the bell, and Rosamond remained helpless until the girl, surprised at Rosamond long absence, thought for the first time of looking for Rosamond in all the down-stairs rooms. Rosamond said that Rosamond had felt suddenly sick and faint, and wanted to be helped up-stairs. When there Rosamond threw Rosamond on the bed with Rosamond clothes on, and lay in apparent torpor, as Rosamond had done once before on a memorable day of grief. Lydgate came home earlier than Lydgate had expected, about half-past five, and found Rosamond there. The perception that Rosamond was ill threw every other thought into the background. When Lydgate felt Rosamond pulse, Rosamond rested on Lydgate with more persistence than her eyes had done for a long while, as if Rosamond felt some content that Lydgate was there. Lydgate perceived the difference in a moment, and seating Lydgate by Rosamond put Lydgate gently under Rosamond, and bending over Rosamond said, "My poor Rosamond! has something agitated you?" Clinging to Lydgate Rosamond fell into hysterical sobbings and cries, and for the next hour Lydgate did nothing but soothe and tend Rosamond. Lydgate imagined that Dorothea had been to see Rosamond, and that all this effect on Rosamond nervous system, which evidently involved some new turning towards Lydgate, was due to the excitement of the new impressions which that visit had raised.
