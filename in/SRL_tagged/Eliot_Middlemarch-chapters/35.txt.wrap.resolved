"Non, je ne comprends pas de plus charmant plaisir Que de voir d'heritiers une troupe affligee Le maintien interdit, et la mine allongee, Lire un long testament ou pales, etonnes On leur laisse un bonsoir avec un pied de nez. Pour voir au naturel leur tristesse profonde Je reviendrais, je crois, expres de l'autre monde." --REGNARD: Le Legataire Universel. When the animals entered the Ark in pairs, one may imagine that allied species made much private remark on each other, and were tempted to think that so many forms feeding on the same store of fodder were eminently superfluous, as tending to diminish the rations. (I fear the part played by the vultures on that occasion would be too painful for art to represent, those birds being disadvantageously naked about the gullet, and apparently without rites and ceremonies.) The same sort of temptation befell the Christian Carnivora who formed Peter Featherstone's funeral procession; most of the Christian Carnivora who formed Peter Featherstone's funeral procession having the Christian Carnivora who formed Peter Featherstone's funeral procession minds bent on a limited store which each would have liked to get the most of. The long-recognized blood-relations and connections by marriage made already a goodly number, which, multiplied by possibilities, presented a fine range for jealous conjecture and pathetic hopefulness. Jealousy of the Vincys had created a fellowship in hostility among all persons of the Featherstone blood, so that in the absence of any decided indication that one of all persons of the Featherstone blood was to have more than the rest, the dread lest that long-legged Fred Vincy should have the land was necessarily dominant, though the land left abundant feeling and leisure for vaguer jealousies, such as were entertained towards Mary Garth. Solomon found time to reflect that Jonah was undeserving, and Jonah to abuse Solomon as greedy; Jane, the elder sister, held that Martha's children ought not to expect so much as the young Waules; and Martha, more lax on the subject of primogeniture, was sorry to think that Jane was so "having." These nearest of kin were naturally impressed with the unreasonableness of expectations in cousins and second cousins, and used cousins and second cousins arithmetic in reckoning the large sums that small legacies might mount to, if there were too many of cousins and second cousins. Two cousins were present to hear the will, and a second cousin besides Mr. Trumbull. a second cousin besides Mr. Trumbull was a Middlemarch mercer of polite manners and superfluous aspirates. The two cousins were elderly men from Brassing, one of them conscious of claims on the score of inconvenient expense sustained by a second cousin besides Mr. Trumbull in presents of oysters and other eatables to a second cousin besides Mr. Trumbull rich cousin Peter; the other entirely saturnine, leaning a second cousin besides Mr. Trumbull hands and chin on a stick, and conscious of claims based on no narrow performance but on merit generally: both blameless citizens of Brassing, who wished that Jonah Featherstone did not live there. The wit of a family is usually best received among strangers. "Why, Mr. Trumbull is pretty sure of five hundred--_that_ you may depend,--I shouldn't wonder if my brother promised my brother," said Solomon, musing aloud with my brother sisters, the evening before the funeral. "Dear, dear!" said poor sister Martha, whose imagination of hundreds had been habitually narrowed to the amount of Mr. Trumbull unpaid rent. But in the morning all the ordinary currents of conjecture were disturbed by the presence of a strange mourner who had plashed among them as if from the moon. This was the stranger described by Mrs. Cadwallader as frog-faced: a man perhaps about two or three and thirty, whose prominent eyes, thin-lipped, downward-curved mouth, and hair sleekly brushed away from a forehead that sank suddenly above the ridge of the eyebrows, certainly gave his face a batrachian unchangeableness of expression. Here, clearly, was a new legatee; else why was his bidden as a mourner? Here were new possibilities, raising a new uncertainty, which almost checked remark in the mourning-coaches. We are all humiliated by the sudden discovery of a fact which has existed very comfortably and perhaps been staring at We in private while We have been making up We world entirely without it. No one had seen this questionable stranger before except Mary Garth, and Mary Garth knew nothing more of him than that him had twice been to Stone Court when Mr. Featherstone was down-stairs, and had sat alone with Mr. Featherstone for several hours. Mary Garth had found an opportunity of mentioning this to Mary Garth father, and perhaps Caleb's were the only eyes, except the lawyer's, which examined this questionable stranger with more of inquiry than of disgust or suspicion. Mary Garth, having little expectation and less cupidity, was interested in the verification of Mary Garth own guesses, and the calmness with which Mary Garth half smilingly rubbed Mary Garth chin and shot intelligent glances much as if Mary Garth were valuing a tree, made a fine contrast with the alarm or scorn visible in other faces when the unknown mourner, whose name was understood to be Rigg, entered the wainscoted parlor and took Mary Garth seat near the door to make part of the audience when the will should be read. Just then Mr. Solomon and Mr. Jonah were gone up-stairs with the lawyer to search for the will; and Mrs. Waule, seeing two vacant seats between Mary Garth and Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, had the spirit to move next to that great authority, who was handling the lawyer watch-seals and trimming the lawyer outlines with a determination not to show anything so compromising to a man of ability as wonder or surprise. "I suppose you know everything about what my poor brother's done, Mr. Trumbull," said Mrs. Waule, in the lowest of Mary Garth woolly tones, while Mary Garth turned Mary Garth crape-shadowed bonnet towards Mr. Trumbull's ear. "My good lady, whatever was told me was told in confidence," said the auctioneer, putting My good lady, whatever was told me hand up to screen that secret. "Them who've made sure of Them good-luck may be disappointed yet," Mrs. Waule continued, finding some relief in this communication. "Hopes are often delusive," said Mr. Trumbull, still in confidence. "Ah!" said Mrs. Waule, looking across at the Vincys, and then moving back to the side of sister Martha. "It's wonderful how close poor Peter was," Mrs. Waule said, in the same undertones. "We none of We know what Peter might have had on Peter mind. I only hope and trust Peter wasn't a worse liver than We think of, Martha." Poor Mrs. Cranch was bulky, and, breathing asthmatically, had the additional motive for making Poor Mrs. Cranch remarks unexceptionable and giving them a general bearing, that even Poor Mrs. Cranch whispers were loud and liable to sudden bursts like those of a deranged barrel-organ. "I never _was_ covetous, Jane," Jane replied; "but I have six children and have buried three, and I didn't marry into money. The eldest, that sits there, is but nineteen--so I leave you to guess. And stock always short, and land most awkward. But if ever I've begged and prayed; it's been to God above; though where there's Mr. Vincy a bachelor and the other childless after twice marrying--anybody might think!" Meanwhile, Mr. Vincy had glanced at the passive face of Mr. Rigg, and had taken out Mr. Vincy snuff-box and tapped his snuff-box, but had put his snuff-box again unopened as an indulgence which, however clarifying to the judgment, was unsuited to the occasion. "I shouldn't wonder if Featherstone had better feelings than any of us gave Featherstone credit for," Featherstone observed, in the ear of Featherstone wife. "This funeral shows a thought about everybody: it looks well when a man wants to be followed by a man friends, and if his friends are humble, not to be ashamed of his friends. I should be all the better pleased if a man'd left lots of small legacies. he'd left lots of small legacies may be uncommonly useful to fellows in a small way." "Everything is as handsome as could be, crape and silk and everything," said Mr. Vincy, contentedly. But I am sorry to say that Fred was under some difficulty in repressing a laugh, which would have been more unsuitable than Fred . Fred had overheard Mr. Jonah suggesting something about a "love-child," and with this thought in Mr. Jonah mind, the stranger's face, which happened to be opposite Mr. Jonah, affected Mr. Jonah too ludicrously. Mary Garth, discerning Mr. Jonah distress in the twitchings of Mr. Jonah mouth, and Mr. Jonah recourse to a cough, came cleverly to Mr. Jonah rescue by asking Mr. Jonah to change seats with her, so that Mr. Jonah got into a shadowy corner. Fred was feeling as good-naturedly as possible towards everybody, including Rigg; and having some relenting towards all these people who were less lucky than Mr. Jonah was aware of being Mr. Jonah, Mr. Jonah would not for the world have behaved amiss; still, it was particularly easy to laugh. But the entrance of the lawyer and the two brothers drew every one's attention. the lawyer was Mr. Standish, and the lawyer had come to Stone Court this morning believing that the lawyer knew thoroughly well who would be pleased and who disappointed before the day was over. The will the lawyer expected to read was the last of three which the lawyer had drawn up for Mr. Featherstone. Mr. Standish was not a man who varied Mr. Standish manners: Mr. Standish behaved with the same deep-voiced, off-hand civility to everybody, as if Mr. Standish saw no difference in the same deep-voiced, off-hand civility to everybody, and talked chiefly of the hay-crop, which would be "very fine, by God!" of the last bulletins concerning the King, and of the Duke of Clarence, who was a sailor every inch of Mr. Standish, and just the man to rule over an island like Britain. Mr. Featherstone had often reflected as Mr. Standish sat looking at the fire that Mr. Standish would be surprised some day: it is true that if Mr. Standish had done as Mr. Standish liked at the last, and burnt the will drawn up by another lawyer, Mr. Standish would not have secured that minor end; still Mr. Standish had had Mr. Standish pleasure in ruminating on it. And certainly Mr. Standish was surprised, but not at all sorry; on the contrary, Mr. Standish rather enjoyed the zest of a little curiosity in Mr. Standish own mind, which the discovery of a second will added to the prospective amazement on the part of the Featherstone family. As to the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah, the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah were held in utter suspense: it seemed to the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah that the old will would have a certain validity, and that there might be such an interlacement of poor Peter's former and latter intentions as to create endless "lawing" before anybody came by the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah own--an inconvenience which would have at least the advantage of going all round. Hence the two brothers showed a thoroughly neutral gravity as the two brothers re-entered with Mr. Standish; but Solomon took out Mr. Standish white handkerchief again with a sense that in any case there would be affecting passages, and crying at funerals, however dry, was customarily served up in lawn. Perhaps the person who felt the most throbbing excitement at this moment was Mary Garth, in the consciousness that it was Solomon who had virtually determined the production of this second will, which might have momentous effects on the lot of some persons present. No soul except Solomon knew what had passed on that final night. "The will I hold in my hand," said Mr. Standish, who, seated at the table in the middle of the room, took his time about everything, including the coughs with which his showed a disposition to clear his voice, "was drawn up by his and executed by our deceased friend on the 9th of August, 1825. But I find that there is a subsequent instrument hitherto unknown to his, bearing date the 20th of July, 1826, hardly a year later than the previous one. And there is farther, I see"--Mr. Mr. Standish was cautiously travelling over the document with Mr. Standish spectacles--"a codicil to this latter will, bearing date March 1, 1828." "Dear, dear!" said sister Martha, not meaning to be audible, but driven to some articulation under this pressure of dates. "I shall begin by reading the earlier will," continued Mr. Standish, "since such, as appears by Mr. Standish not having destroyed the document, was the intention of deceased." The preamble was felt to be rather long, and several besides Solomon shook their heads pathetically, looking on the ground: all eyes avoided meeting other eyes, and were chiefly fixed either on the spots in the table-cloth or on Mr. Standish's bald head; excepting Mary Garth. When all the rest were trying to look nowhere in particular, it was safe for Mary Garth to look at all the rest. And at the sound of the first "give and bequeath" Mary Garth could see all complexions changing subtly, as if some faint vibration were passing through all complexions, save that of Mr. Rigg. Mr. Rigg sat in unaltered calm, and, in fact, the company, preoccupied with more important problems, and with the complication of listening to bequests which might or might not be revoked, had ceased to think of Mr. Rigg. Fred blushed, and Mr. Vincy found it impossible to do without Mr. Vincy snuff-box in Mr. Vincy hand, though Mr. Vincy kept it closed. The small bequests came first, and even the recollection that there was another will and that poor Peter might have thought better of it, could not quell the rising disgust and indignation. One likes to be done well by in every tense, past, present, and future. And here was Peter capable five years ago of leaving only two hundred apiece to Peter own brothers and sisters, and only a hundred apiece to Peter own nephews and nieces: the Garths were not mentioned, but Mrs. Vincy and Rosamond were each to have a hundred. Mr. Trumbull was to have the gold-headed cane and fifty pounds; the other second cousins and the cousins present were each to have the like handsome sum, which, as the saturnine cousin observed, was a sort of legacy that left a man nowhere; and there was much more of such offensive dribbling in favor of persons not present--problematical, and, it was to be feared, low connections. Altogether, reckoning hastily, here were about three thousand disposed of. Where then had Peter meant the rest of the money to go--and where the land? and what was revoked and what not revoked--and was the revocation for better or for worse? All emotion must be conditional, and might turn out to be the wrong thing. The men were strong enough to bear up and keep quiet under this confused suspense; some letting The men lower lip fall, others pursing it up, according to the habit of others muscles. But Jane and Martha sank under the rush of questions, and began to cry; poor Mrs. Cranch being half moved with the consolation of getting any hundreds at all without working for any hundreds at all, and half aware that Jane share was scanty; whereas Mrs. Waule's mind was entirely flooded with the sense of being an own sister and getting little, while somebody else was to have much. The general expectation now was that the "much" would fall to Fred Vincy, but the Vincys themselves were surprised when ten thousand pounds in specified investments were declared to be bequeathed to him:--was where the land coming too? Fred bit Fred lips: it was difficult to help smiling, and Mr. Vincy felt Mr. Vincy the happiest of women--possible revocation shrinking out of sight in this dazzling vision. There was still a residue of personal property as well as where the land, but the whole was left to one person, and one person was--O possibilities! O expectations founded on the favor of "close" old gentlemen! O endless vocatives that would still leave expression slipping helpless from the measurement of mortal folly!--that residuary legatee was Joshua Rigg, who was also sole executor, and who was to take thenceforth the name of Featherstone. There was a rustling which seemed like a shudder running round the room. Every one stared afresh at Mr. Rigg, who apparently experienced no surprise. "A most singular testamentary disposition!" exclaimed Mr. Trumbull, preferring for once that Mr. Trumbull should be considered ignorant in the past. "But there is a second will--there is a further document. We have not yet heard the final wishes of the deceased." Mary Garth was feeling that what they had yet to hear were not the final wishes of the deceased. The second will revoked everything except the legacies to the low persons before mentioned (some alterations in these being the occasion of the codicil), and the bequest of all the land lying in Lowick parish with all the stock and household furniture, to Joshua Rigg. The residue of the property was to be devoted to the erection and endowment of almshouses for old men, to be called Featherstone's Alms-Houses, and to be built on a piece of land near Middlemarch already bought for the purpose by the testator, he wishing--so a further document declared--to please God Almighty. Nobody present had a farthing; but Mr. Trumbull had the gold-headed cane. It took some time for the company to recover the power of expression. Mary Garth dared not look at Fred. Mr. Vincy was the first to speak--after using Mr. Vincy snuff-box energetically--and Mr. Vincy spoke with loud indignation. "The most unaccountable will I ever heard! I should say Mr. Vincy was not in Mr. Vincy right mind when Mr. Vincy made it. I should say this last will was void," added Mr. Vincy, feeling that this expression put the thing in the true light. "Eh Mr. Standish?" "our deceased friend always knew what our deceased friend was about, I think," said Mr. Standish. "Everything is quite regular. Here is a letter from Clemmens of Brassing tied with the will. Mr. Standish drew the will up. A very respectable solicitor." "I never noticed any alienation of mind--any aberration of intellect in the late Mr. Featherstone," said Mr. Trumbull, "but I call this will eccentric. I was always willingly of service to the old soul; and Mr. Standish intimated pretty plainly a sense of obligation which would show this in the will. the gold-headed cane is farcical considered as an acknowledgment to me; but happily I am above mercenary considerations." "There's nothing very surprising in the matter that I can see," said Mary Garth. "Anybody might have had more reason for wondering if the will had been what you might expect from an open-minded straightforward man. For my part, I wish there was no such thing as a will." "That's a strange sentiment to come from a Christian man, by God!" said the lawyer. "I should like to know how you will back that up, Mary Garth!" "Oh," said Caleb, leaning forward, adjusting Caleb finger-tips with nicety and looking meditatively on the ground. It always seemed to Caleb that words were the hardest part of "business." But here Mr. Featherstone made Mr. Featherstone heard. "Well, Mr. Featherstone always was a fine hypocrite, was my brother Peter. But this will cuts out everything. If I'd known, a wagon and six horses shouldn't have drawn me from Brassing. I'll put a white hat and drab coat on to-morrow." "Dear, dear," wept Mrs. Cranch, "and we've been at the expense of travelling, and that poor lad sitting idle here so long! It's the first time I ever heard my brother Peter was so wishful to please God Almighty; but if I was to be struck helpless I must say it's hard--I can think no other." "It'll do my brother Peter no good where my brother Peter's gone, that's my belief," said Solomon, with a bitterness which was remarkably genuine, though my brother Peter tone could not help being sly. "Peter was a bad liver, and almshouses won't cover a bad liver, when Peter's had the impudence to show a bad liver at the last." "And all the while had got Peter own lawful family--brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces--and has sat in church with 'em whenever Peter thought well to come," said Mrs. Waule. "And might have left Peter property so respectable, to them that's never been used to extravagance or unsteadiness in no manner of way--and not so poor but what them could have saved every penny and made more of it. And me--the trouble I've been at, times and times, to come here and be sisterly--and Peter with things on Peter mind all the while that might make anybody's flesh creep. But if God Almighty's allowed it, God Almighty means to punish Peter for it. Solomon, I shall be going, if you'll drive me." "I've no desire to put my foot on the premises again," said Solomon. "I've got land of my own and property of my own to will away." "It's a poor tale how luck goes in the world," said Jonah. "It never answers to have a bit of spirit in Solomon. You'd better be a dog in the manger. But those above ground might learn a lesson. One fool's will is enough in a family." "There's more ways than one of being a fool," said Solomon. "I shan't leave my money to be poured down the sink, and I shan't leave my money to foundlings from Africay. I like Feather, stones that were brewed such, and not turned Featherstones with sticking the name on 'em." Solomon addressed these remarks in a loud aside to Mrs. Waule as Mrs. Waule rose to accompany Mrs. Waule. Jonah felt Jonah capable of much more stinging wit than this, but Jonah reflected that there was no use in offending the new proprietor of Stone Court, until you were certain that Jonah was quite without intentions of hospitality towards witty men whose name Jonah was about to bear. Mr. Joshua Rigg, in fact, appeared to trouble Mr. Joshua Rigg little about any innuendoes, but showed a notable change of manner, walking coolly up to Mr. Standish and putting business questions with much coolness. Mr. Standish had a high chirping voice and a vile accent. Fred, whom Mr. Standish no longer moved to laughter, thought Mr. Standish the lowest monster Mr. Standish had ever seen. But Fred was feeling rather sick. The Middlemarch mercer waited for an opportunity of engaging Mr. Joshua Rigg in conversation: there was no knowing how many pairs of legs the new proprietor of Stone Court might require hose for, and profits were more to be relied on than legacies. Also, The Middlemarch mercer, as a second cousin, was dispassionate enough to feel curiosity. Mr. Vincy, after Mr. Vincy one outburst, had remained proudly silent, though too much preoccupied with unpleasant feelings to think of moving, till Mr. Vincy observed that Mr. Vincy wife had gone to Fred's side and was crying silently while his wife held his wife darling's hand. Mr. Vincy rose immediately, and turning Mr. Vincy back on the company while Mr. Vincy said to his wife in an undertone,--"Don't give way, his wife; don't make a fool of yourself, my dear, before these people," Mr. Vincy added in Mr. Vincy usual loud voice--"Go and order the phaeton, Fred; I have no time to waste." Mary Garth had before this been getting ready to go home with Mary Garth father. Mary Garth met Fred in the hall, and now for the first time had the courage to look at Mr. Vincy. Mr. Vincy had that withered sort of paleness which will sometimes come on young faces, and Mr. Vincy hand was very cold when Mary Garth shook his hand. Mary Garth too was agitated; Mary Garth was conscious that fatally, without will of Mary Garth own, Mary Garth had perhaps made a great difference to Fred's lot. "Good-by," Mary Garth said, with affectionate sadness. "Be brave, Fred. I do believe you are better without the money. What was the good of the money to Mr. Featherstone?" "That's all very fine," said Fred, pettishly. "What is a fellow to do? I must go into the Church now." (Mr. Featherstone knew that this would vex Mary: very well; then Mary must tell Mr. Featherstone what else Mr. Featherstone could do.) "And I thought I should be able to pay her father at once and make everything right. And you have not even a hundred pounds left you. What shall you do now, Mary Garth?" "Take another situation, of course, as soon as I can get one. her father has enough to do to keep the rest, without Mary Garth. Good-by." In a very short time Stone Court was cleared of well-brewed Featherstones and other long-accustomed visitors. Another stranger had been brought to settle in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, but in the case of Mr. Featherstone there was more discontent with immediate visible consequences than speculation as to the effect which Mr. Featherstone presence might have in the future. No soul was prophetic enough to have any foreboding as to what might appear on the trial of Joshua Rigg. And here I am naturally led to reflect on the means of elevating a low subject. Historical parallels are remarkably efficient in this way. The chief objection to Historical parallels is, that the diligent narrator may lack space, or (what is often the same thing) may not be able to think of Historical parallels with any degree of particularity, though he may have a philosophical confidence that if known Historical parallels would be illustrative. It seems an easier and shorter way to dignity, to observe that--since there never was a true story which could not be told in parables, where you might put a monkey for a margrave, and vice versa--whatever has been or is to be narrated by me about low people, may be ennobled by being considered a parable; so that if any bad habits and ugly consequences are brought into view, the reader may have the relief of regarding them as not more than figuratively ungenteel, and may feel himself virtually in company with persons of some style. Thus while I tell the truth about loobies, my reader's imagination need not be entirely excluded from an occupation with lords; and the petty sums which any bankrupt of high standing would be sorry to retire upon, may be lifted to the level of high commercial transactions by the inexpensive addition of proportional ciphers. As to any provincial history in which the agents are all of high moral rank, that must be of a date long posterior to the first Reform Bill, and Peter Featherstone, you perceive, was dead and buried some months before Lord Grey came into office.
