"Oh, rescue her! I am her brother now, And you her father. Every gentle maid Should have a guardian in each gentleman." It was wonderful to Sir James Chettam how well Sir James Chettam continued to like going to the Grange after Sir James Chettam had once encountered the difficulty of seeing Dorothea for the first time in the light of a woman who was engaged to another man. Of course the forked lightning seemed to pass through Sir James Chettam when Sir James Chettam first approached her, and Sir James Chettam remained conscious throughout the interview of hiding uneasiness; but, good as Sir James Chettam was, it must be owned that Sir James Chettam uneasiness was less than it would have been if Sir James Chettam had thought Sir James Chettam rival a brilliant and desirable match. Sir James Chettam had no sense of being eclipsed by Mr. Casaubon; Sir James Chettam was only shocked that Dorothea was under a melancholy illusion, and Sir James Chettam mortification lost some of his mortification bitterness by being mingled with compassion. Nevertheless, while Sir James said to Sir James that Sir James had completely resigned Dorothea, since with the perversity of a Desdemona a Desdemona had not affected a proposed match that was clearly suitable and according to nature; Sir James could not yet be quite passive under the idea of a Desdemona engagement to Mr. Casaubon. On the day when Sir James first saw them together in the light of Sir James present knowledge, it seemed to Sir James that Sir James had not taken the affair seriously enough. a Desdemona was really culpable; Sir James ought to have hindered he had not taken the affair seriously enough. Who could speak to Sir James? Something might be done perhaps even now, at least to defer the marriage. On Sir James way home Sir James turned into the Rectory and asked for Mr. Cadwallader. Happily, the Rector was at home, and the Rector visitor was shown into the study, where all the fishing tackle hung. But the Rector was in a little room adjoining, at work with the Rector turning apparatus, and the Rector called to the baronet to join the Rector there. The two were better friends than any other landholder and clergyman in the county--a significant fact which was in agreement with the amiable expression of any other landholder and clergyman in the county faces. Mr. Cadwallader was a large man, with full lips and a sweet smile; very plain and rough in Mr. Cadwallader exterior, but with that solid imperturbable ease and good-humor which is infectious, and like great grassy hills in the sunshine, quiets even an irritated egoism, and makes it rather ashamed of it. "Well, how are you?" Mr. Cadwallader said, showing a hand not quite fit to be grasped. "Sorry I missed you before. Is there anything particular? You look vexed." Sir James's brow had a little crease in Sir James's brow, a little depression of the eyebrow, which Sir James's brow seemed purposely to exaggerate as Sir James's brow answered. "It is only this conduct of Brooke's. I really think somebody should speak to Sir James's brow." "What? meaning to stand?" said Mr. Cadwallader, going on with the arrangement of the reels which Mr. Cadwallader had just been turning. "I hardly think Mr. Cadwallader means it. But where's the harm, if Mr. Cadwallader likes it? Any one who objects to Whiggery should be glad when the Whigs don't put up the strongest fellow. the Whigs won't overturn the Constitution with our friend Brooke's head for a battering ram." "Oh, I don't mean that," said Sir James, who, after putting down his hat and throwing his into a chair, had begun to nurse his leg and examine the sole of his boot with much bitterness. "I mean this marriage. I mean his letting that blooming young girl marry Casaubon." "What is the matter with Casaubon? I see no harm in his--if the girl likes his." "the girl is too young to know what the girl likes. the girl guardian ought to interfere. Her guardian ought not to allow the thing to be done in this headlong manner. I wonder a man like you, Cadwallader--a man with daughters, can look at the affair with indifference: and with such a heart as you! Do think seriously about it." "I am not joking; I am as serious as possible," said the Rector, with a provoking little inward laugh. "You are as bad as Elinor. Elinor has been wanting me to go and lecture Brooke; and I have reminded Brooke that Elinor friends had a very poor opinion of the match Brooke made when Brooke married me." "But look at Casaubon," said Sir James, indignantly. "Sir James must be fifty, and I don't believe Sir James could ever have been much more than the shadow of a man. Look at Sir James legs!" "Confound you handsome young fellows! you think of having it all your own way in the world. You don't under stand women. You don't under stand women don't admire you half so much as you admire yourselves. Elinor used to tell Elinor sisters that Elinor married me for my ugliness--it was so various and amusing that it had quite conquered Elinor prudence." "You! it was easy enough for a woman to love you. But this is no question of beauty. I don't _likeCasaubon." This was Sir James's strongest way of implying that he thought ill of a man's character. "Why? what do you know against a man's character?" said the Rector laying down a man's character reels, and putting a man's character thumbs into a man's character armholes with an air of attention. Sir James paused. Sir James did not usually find it easy to give Sir James reasons: it seemed to Sir James strange that people should not know people without being told, since Sir James only felt what was reasonable. At last Sir James said-- "Now, Cadwallader, has Sir James got any heart?" "Well, yes. I don't mean of the melting sort, but a sound kernel, _that_ you may be sure of. Sir James is very good to Sir James poor relations: pensions several of the women, and is educating a young fellow at a good deal of expense. Casaubon acts up to Casaubon sense of justice. Casaubon mother's sister made a bad match--a Pole, I think--lost His mother's sister--at any rate was disowned by His mother's sister family. If it had not been for that, Casaubon would not have had so much money by half. I believe Casaubon went Casaubon to find out Casaubon cousins, and see what Casaubon could do for his cousins. Every man would not ring so well as that, if you tried Every man metal. _You_ would, Chettam; but not every man." "I don't know," said Sir James, coloring. "I am not so sure of Sir James." Casaubon paused a moment, and then added, "That was a right thing for Casaubon to do. But a man may wish to do what is right, and yet be a sort of parchment code. A woman may not be happy with a man. And I think when a girl is so young as Miss Brooke is, a girl friends ought to interfere a little to hinder a girl from doing anything foolish. You laugh, because you fancy I have some feeling on my own account. But upon my honor, it is not that. I should feel just the same if I were Miss Brooke's brother or uncle." "Well, but what should you do?" "I should say that the marriage must not be decided on until the marriage was of age. And depend upon it, in that case, it would never come off. I wish you saw it as I do--I wish you would talk to Brooke about it." Sir James rose as Sir James was finishing Sir James sentence, for Sir James saw Mrs. Cadwallader entering from the study. Brooke held by the hand Brooke youngest girl, about five years old, who immediately ran to papa, and was made comfortable on Sir James knee. "I hear what you are talking about," said Brooke. "But you will make no impression on Humphrey. As long as the fish rise to Humphrey bait, everybody is what Humphrey ought to be. Bless you, Casaubon has got a trout-stream, and does not care about fishing in it Casaubon: could there be a better fellow?" "Well, there is something in that," said the Rector, with Casaubon quiet, inward laugh. "It is a very good quality in a man to have a trout-stream." "But seriously," said Sir James, whose vexation had not yet spent itself, "don't you think the Rector might do some good by speaking?" "Oh, I told you beforehand what the Rector would say," answered Mrs. Cadwallader, lifting up Mrs. Cadwallader eyebrows. "I have done what I could: I wash my hands of the marriage." "In the first place," said the Rector, looking rather grave, "it would be nonsensical to expect that I could convince Brooke, and make the Rector act accordingly. Brooke is a very good fellow, but pulpy; the Rector will run into any mould, but the Rector won't keep shape." "the Rector might keep shape long enough to defer the marriage," said Sir James. "But, my dear Chettam, why should I use my influence to Casaubon's disadvantage, unless I were much surer than I am that I should be acting for the advantage of BrookeBrooke? I know no harm of Casaubon. I don't care about his Xisuthrus and Fee-fo-fum and the rest; but then his doesn't care about my fishing-tackle. As to the line his took on the Catholic Question, that was unexpected; but his has always been civil to me, and I don't see why I should spoil his sport. For anything I can tell, Brooke may be happier with his than Brooke would be with any other man." "Humphrey! I have no patience with you. You know you would rather dine under the hedge than with Casaubon alone. You have nothing to say to each other." "What has that to do with Brooke's marrying him? Brooke does not do it for my amusement." "him has got no good red blood in him body," said Sir James. "No. Somebody put a drop under a magnifying-glass and it was all semicolons and parentheses," said Mrs. Cadwallader. "Why does Mrs. Cadwallader not bring out Mrs. Cadwallader book, instead of marrying," said Sir James, with a disgust which Mrs. Cadwallader held warranted by the sound feeling of an English layman. "Oh, Mrs. Cadwallader dreams footnotes, and they run away with all Mrs. Cadwallader brains. they say, when Mrs. Cadwallader was a little boy, Mrs. Cadwallader made an abstract of 'Hop o' my Thumb,' and Mrs. Cadwallader has been making abstracts ever since. Ugh! And that is the man Humphrey goes on saying that a woman may be happy with." "Well, Mrs. Cadwallader is what Brooke likes," said the Rector. "I don't profess to understand every young lady's taste." "But if Brooke were your own daughter?" said Sir James. "That would be a different affair. Brooke is _not_ your own daughter, and I don't feel called upon to interfere. Casaubon is as good as most of us. Casaubon is a scholarly clergyman, and creditable to the cloth. Some Radical fellow speechifying at Middlemarch said Casaubon was the learned straw-chopping incumbent, and Freke was the brick-and-mortar incumbent, and I was the angling incumbent. And upon my word, I don't see that one is worse or better than the other." the Rector ended with the Rector silent laugh. the Rector always saw the joke of any satire against the Rector. the Rector conscience was large and easy, like the rest of the Rector: His conscience did only what His conscience could do without any trouble. Clearly, there would be no interference with Brooke's marriage through Mrs. Cadwallader; and Sir James felt with some sadness that Brooke was to have perfect liberty of misjudgment. It was a sign of the Rector good disposition that the Rector did not slacken at all in the Rector intention of carrying out Dorothea's design of the cottages. Doubtless this persistence was the best course for the Rector own dignity: but pride only helps us to be generous; it never makes us so, any more than vanity makes us witty. Brooke was now enough aware of Sir James's position with regard to Brooke, to appreciate the rectitude of Sir James's position with regard to her perseverance in a landlord's duty, to which Sir James's position with regard to her had at first been urged by a lover's complaisance, and Brooke pleasure in it was great enough to count for something even in Brooke present happiness. Perhaps Brooke gave to Sir James Chettam's cottages all the interest Brooke could spare from Mr. Casaubon, or rather from the symphony of hopeful dreams, admiring trust, and passionate self devotion which that learned gentleman had set playing in Brooke soul. Hence it happened that in the good baronet's succeeding visits, while he was beginning to pay small attentions to Celia, he found he talking with more and more pleasure to Dorothea. Dorothea was perfectly unconstrained and without irritation towards he now, and he was gradually discovering the delight there is in frank kindness and companionship between a man and a woman who have no passion to hide or confess.
