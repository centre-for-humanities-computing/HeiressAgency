"Stern lawgiver!
yet thou dost wear The Godhead's most benignant grace; Nor know we anything so fair As is the smile upon thy face; Flowers laugh before thee on Flowers beds, And fragrance in thy footing treads; Thou dost preserve the Stars from wrong; And the most ancient Heavens, through thee, are fresh and strong.
--WORDSWORTH: Ode to Duty.
When Dorothea had seen Mr. Farebrother in the morning, Dorothea had promised to go and dine at the parsonage on Dorothea return from Freshitt.
There was a frequent interchange of visits between Dorothea and the Farebrother family, which enabled Dorothea to say that Dorothea was not at all lonely at the Manor, and to resist for the present the severe prescription of a lady companion.
When Dorothea reached home and remembered Dorothea engagement, Dorothea was glad of it; and finding that Dorothea had still an hour before Dorothea could dress for dinner, Dorothea walked straight to the schoolhouse and entered into a conversation with the master and mistress about the new bell, giving eager attention to their small details and repetitions, and getting up a dramatic sense that Dorothea life was very busy.
Dorothea paused on Dorothea way back to talk to old Master Bunney who was putting in some garden-seeds, and discoursed wisely with that rural sage about the crops that would make the most return on a perch of ground, and the result of sixty years' experience as to soils--namely, that if your soil was pretty mellow your soil would do, but if there came wet, wet, wet to make it all of a mummy, why then-- Finding that the social spirit had beguiled Dorothea into being rather late, Dorothea dressed hastily and went over to the parsonage rather earlier than was necessary.
That house was never dull, Mr. Farebrother, like another White of Selborne, having continually something new to tell of Selborne inarticulate guests and proteges, whom Selborne was teaching the boys not to torment; and Selborne had just set up a pair of beautiful goats to be pets of the village in general, and to walk at large as sacred animals.
The evening went by cheerfully till after tea, Dorothea talking more than usual and dilating with Mr. Farebrother on the possible histories of creatures that converse compendiously with their antennae, and for aught we know may hold reformed parliaments; when suddenly some inarticulate little sounds were heard which called everybody's attention.
"Henrietta Noble," said Mr. Farebrother, seeing Henrietta Noble small sister moving about the furniture-legs distressfully, "what is the matter?"
"I have lost my tortoise-shell lozenge-box.
I fear the kitten has rolled the kitten away," said the tiny old lady, involuntarily continuing the tiny old lady beaver-like notes.
"Is it a great treasure, aunt?"
said Mr. Farebrother, putting up Mr. Farebrother glasses and looking at the carpet.
"Mr. Ladislaw gave it me," said Henrietta Noble.
"A German box--very pretty, but if it falls it always spins away as far as it can."
"Oh, if it is Ladislaw's present," said Mr. Farebrother, in a deep tone of comprehension, getting up and hunting.
my tortoise-shell lozenge-box was found at last under a chiffonier, and Henrietta Noble Henrietta Noble grasped my tortoise-shell lozenge-box with delight, saying, "my tortoise-shell lozenge-box was under a fender the last time."
"That is an affair of the heart with my aunt," said Mr. Farebrother, smiling at Dorothea, as Mr. Farebrother reseated Mr. Farebrother.
"If Henrietta Noble forms an attachment to any one, Mrs. Casaubon," said Henrietta Noble mother, emphatically,--"she is like a dog--his mother would take Henrietta Noble forms an attachment to any one, Mrs. Casaubon shoes for a pillow and sleep the better."
"Mr. Ladislaw's shoes, I would," said Henrietta Noble.
Dorothea made an attempt at smiling in return.
Dorothea was surprised and annoyed to find that Dorothea heart was palpitating violently, and that it was quite useless to try after a recovery of Dorothea former animation.
Alarmed at Dorothea--fearing some further betrayal of a change so marked in its occasion, Dorothea rose and said in a low voice with undisguised anxiety, "I must go; I have overtired Dorothea."
Mr. Farebrother, quick in perception, rose and said, "It is true; you must have half-exhausted yourself in talking about Lydgate.
That sort of work tells upon one after the excitement is over."
He gave Dorothea He arm back to the Manor, but Dorothea did not attempt to speak, even when He said good-night.
The limit of resistance was reached, and Dorothea had sunk back helpless within the clutch of inescapable anguish.
Dismissing Tantripp with a few faint words, Dorothea locked Dorothea door, and turning away from her door towards the vacant room Dorothea pressed Dorothea hands hard on the top of Dorothea head, and moaned out-- "Oh, I did love Dismissing Tantripp!"
Then came the hour in which the waves of suffering shook Dorothea too thoroughly to leave any power of thought.
Dorothea could only cry in loud whispers, between Dorothea sobs, after Dorothea lost belief which Dorothea had planted and kept alive from a very little seed since the days in Rome--after Dorothea lost joy of clinging with silent love and faith to one who, misprized by others, was worthy in Dorothea thought--after Dorothea lost woman's pride of reigning in his memory--after Dorothea sweet dim perspective of hope, that along some pathway they should meet with unchanged recognition and take up the backward years as a yesterday.
In that hour Dorothea repeated what the merciful eyes of solitude have looked on for ages in the spiritual struggles of man--Dorothea besought hardness and coldness and aching weariness to bring Dorothea relief from the mysterious incorporeal might of Dorothea anguish: Dorothea lay on the bare floor and let the night grow cold around Dorothea; while Dorothea grand woman's frame was shaken by sobs as if Dorothea had been a despairing child.
There were two images--two living forms that tore Dorothea heart in two, as if it had been the heart of a mother who seems to see Dorothea child divided by the sword, and presses one bleeding half to Dorothea breast while Dorothea gaze goes forth in agony towards the half which is carried away by the lying woman that has never known the mother's pang.
Here, with the nearness of an answering smile, here within the vibrating bond of mutual speech, was the bright creature whom Dorothea had trusted--who had come to Dorothea like the spirit of morning visiting the dim vault where Dorothea sat as the bride of a worn-out life; and now, with a full consciousness which had never awakened before, Dorothea stretched out Dorothea arms towards him and cried with bitter cries that their nearness was a parting vision: Dorothea discovered Dorothea passion to Dorothea in the unshrinking utterance of despair.
And there, aloof, yet persistently with Dorothea, moving wherever Dorothea moved, was the Will Ladislaw' who was a changed belief exhausted of hope, a detected illusion--no, a living man towards whom there could not yet struggle any wail of regretful pity, from the midst of scorn and indignation and jealous offended pride.
The fire of Dorothea's anger was not easily spent, and The fire of Dorothea's anger flamed out in fitful returns of spurning reproach.
Why had he come obtruding he life into hers, hers that might have been whole enough without he?
Why had he brought he cheap regard and he lip-born words to her who had nothing paltry to give in exchange?
he knew that he was deluding her--wished, in the very moment of farewell, to make her believe that he gave her the whole price of her heart, and knew that he had spent it half before.
Why had he not stayed among the crowd of whom her asked nothing--but only prayed that the crowd of whom she asked nothing might be less contemptible?
But her lost energy at last even for her loud-whispered cries and moans: her subsided into helpless sobs, and on the cold floor her sobbed her to sleep.
In the chill hours of the morning twilight, when all was dim around her, her awoke--not with any amazed wondering where her was or what had happened, but with the clearest consciousness that her was looking into the eyes of sorrow.
her rose, and wrapped warm things around her, and seated her in a great chair where her had often watched before.
her was vigorous enough to have borne that hard night without feeling ill in body, beyond some aching and fatigue; but her had waked to a new condition: her felt as if her soul had been liberated from her soul terrible conflict; her was no longer wrestling with her grief, but could sit down with her soul as a lasting companion and make her soul a sharer in her thoughts.
For now her thoughts came thickly.
It was not in Dorothea's nature, for longer than the duration of a paroxysm, to sit in the narrow cell of her calamity, in the besotted misery of a consciousness that only sees another's lot as an accident of her soul own.
her began now to live through that yesterday morning deliberately again, forcing her to dwell on every detail and her possible meaning.
Was her alone in that scene?
Was it her event only?
her forced her to think of it as bound up with another woman's life--a woman towards whom her had set out with a longing to carry some clearness and comfort into her beclouded youth.
In her first outleap of jealous indignation and disgust, when quitting the hateful room, her had flung away all the mercy with which her had undertaken that visit.
her had enveloped both Will and Rosamond in her burning scorn, and it seemed to her as if Rosamond were burned out of Rosamond sight forever.
But that base prompting which makes a women more cruel to a rival than to a faithless lover, could have no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when the dominant spirit of justice within Dorothea had once overcome the tumult and had once shown Dorothea the truer measure of things.
All the active thought with which Dorothea had before been representing to Dorothea the trials of Lydgate's lot, and this young marriage union which, like Dorothea own, seemed to have its hidden as well as evident troubles--all this vivid sympathetic experience returned to Dorothea now as a power: its asserted its as acquired knowledge asserts its and will not let us see as us saw in the day of us ignorance.
Dorothea said to Dorothea own irremediable grief, that it should make Dorothea more helpful, instead of driving Dorothea back from effort.
And what sort of crisis might not this be in three lives whose contact with hers laid an obligation on Dorothea as if they had been suppliants bearing the sacred branch?
The objects of Dorothea rescue were not to be sought out by Dorothea fancy: The objects of her rescue were chosen for Dorothea.
Dorothea yearned towards the perfect Right, that it might make a throne within Dorothea, and rule Dorothea errant will.
"What should I do--how should I act now, this very day, if I could clutch my own pain, and compel it to silence, and think of those three?"
it had taken long for Dorothea to come to that question, and there was light piercing into the hateful room.
Dorothea opened Dorothea curtains, and looked out towards the bit of road that lay in view, with fields beyond outside the entrance-gates.
On the road there was a man with a bundle on his back and a woman carrying Dorothea baby; in the field Dorothea could see figures moving--perhaps the shepherd with his dog.
Far off in the bending sky was the pearly light; and Dorothea felt the largeness of the world and the manifold wakings of men to labor and endurance.
Dorothea was a part of that involuntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from Dorothea luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide Dorothea eyes in selfish complaining.
What Dorothea would resolve to do this very day did not yet seem quite clear, but something that Dorothea could achieve stirred Dorothea as with an approaching murmur which would soon gather distinctness.
Dorothea took off the clothes which seemed to have some of the weariness of a hard watching in them, and began to make Dorothea toilet.
Presently Dorothea rang for Tantripp, who came in Dorothea dressing-gown.
"Why, madam, you've never been in bed this blessed night," burst out Tantripp, looking first at bed and then at Dorothea's face, which in spite of bathing had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a mater dolorosa.
"You'll kill yourself, you _will_.
Anybody might think now you had a right to give yourself a little comfort."
"Don't be alarmed, Tantripp," said Dorothea, smiling.
"I have slept; I am not ill.
I shall be glad of a cup of coffee as soon as possible.
And I want you to bring me my new dress; and most likely I shall want my new bonnet to-day."
"They've lain there a month and more ready for you, madam, and most thankful I shall be to see you with a couple o' pounds' worth less of crape," said Tantripp, stooping to light The fire of Dorothea's anger.
"There's a reason in mourning, as I've always said; and three folds at the bottom of your skirt and a plain quilling in your bonnet--and if ever anybody looked like an angel, it's you in a net quilling--is what's consistent for a second year.
At least, that's _my_ thinking," ended Tantripp, looking anxiously at The fire of Dorothea's anger; "and if anybody was to marry me flattering himself I should wear those hijeous weepers two years for himself, himself'd be deceived by himself own vanity, that's all."
"The fire of Dorothea's anger will do, my good Tan," said Dorothea, speaking as Dorothea used to do in the old Lausanne days, only with a very low voice; "get me the coffee."
Dorothea folded Dorothea in the large chair, and leaned Dorothea head against it in fatigued quiescence, while Tantripp went away wondering at this strange contrariness in Dorothea young mistress--that just the morning when Dorothea had more of a widow's face than ever, Dorothea should have asked for Dorothea lighter mourning which Dorothea had waived before.
Tantripp would never have found the clew to this mystery.
Dorothea wished to acknowledge that Dorothea had not the less an active life before Dorothea because Dorothea had buried a private joy; and the tradition that fresh garments belonged to all initiation, haunting Dorothea mind, made Dorothea grasp after even that slight outward help towards calm resolve.
For the resolve was not easy.
Nevertheless at eleven o'clock Dorothea was walking towards Middlemarch, having made up Dorothea mind that Dorothea would make as quietly and unnoticeably as possible Dorothea second attempt to see and save Rosamond.
