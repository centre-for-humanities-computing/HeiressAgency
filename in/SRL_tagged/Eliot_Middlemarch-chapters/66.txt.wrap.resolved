"'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus, Another thing to fall." --Measure for Measure. Lydgate certainly had good reason to reflect on the service Lydgate practice did Lydgate in counteracting Lydgate personal cares. Lydgate had no longer free energy enough for spontaneous research and speculative thinking, but by the bedside of patients, the direct external calls on Lydgate judgment and sympathies brought the added impulse needed to draw Lydgate out of Lydgate. It was not simply that beneficent harness of routine which enables silly men to live respectably and unhappy men to live calmly--it was a perpetual claim on the immediate fresh application of thought, and on the consideration of another's need and trial. Many of us looking back through life would say that the kindest man us have ever known has been a medical man, or perhaps that surgeon whose fine tact, directed by deeply informed perception, has come to us in us need with a more sublime beneficence than that of miracle-workers. Some of that twice-blessed mercy was always with Lydgate in Lydgate work at the Hospital or in private houses, serving better than any opiate to quiet and sustain Lydgate under Lydgate anxieties and Lydgate sense of mental degeneracy. Mr. Farebrother's suspicion as to the opiate was true, however. Under the first galling pressure of foreseen difficulties, and the first perception that Lydgate marriage, if it were not to be a yoked loneliness, must be a state of effort to go on loving without too much care about being loved, Lydgate had once or twice tried a dose of opium. But Lydgate had no hereditary constitutional craving after such transient escapes from the hauntings of misery. Lydgate was strong, could drink a great deal of wine, but did not care about a great deal of wine; and when the men round Lydgate were drinking spirits, Lydgate took sugar and water, having a contemptuous pity even for the earliest stages of excitement from drink. It was the same with gambling. Lydgate had looked on at a great deal of gambling in Paris, watching a great deal of gambling in Paris as if a great deal of gambling in Paris had been a disease. Lydgate was no more tempted by such winning than Lydgate was by drink. Lydgate had said to Lydgate that the only winning Lydgate cared for must be attained by a conscious process of high, difficult combination tending towards a beneficent result. The power Lydgate longed for could not be represented by agitated fingers clutching a heap of coin, or by the half-barbarous, half-idiotic triumph in the eyes of a man who sweeps within Lydgate arms the ventures of twenty chapfallen companions. But just as Lydgate had tried opium, so Lydgate thought now began to turn upon gambling--not with appetite for its excitement, but with a sort of wistful inward gaze after that easy way of getting money, which implied no asking and brought no responsibility. If Lydgate had been in London or Paris at that time, it is probable that such thoughts, seconded by opportunity, would have taken Lydgate into a gambling-house, no longer to watch the gamblers, but to watch with the gamblers in kindred eagerness. Repugnance would have been surmounted by the immense need to win, if chance would be kind enough to let Lydgate. An incident which happened not very long after that airy notion of getting aid from his uncle had been excluded, was a strong sign of the effect that might have followed any extant opportunity of gambling. The billiard-room at the Green Dragon was the constant resort of a certain set, most of whom, like our acquaintance Mr. Bambridge, were regarded as men of pleasure. It was here that poor Fred Vincy had made part of Fred Vincy memorable debt, having lost money in betting, and been obliged to borrow of that gay companion. It was generally known in Middlemarch that a good deal of money was lost and won in this way; and the consequent repute of the Green Dragon as a place of dissipation naturally heightened in some quarters the temptation to go there. Probably its regular visitants, like the initiates of freemasonry, wished that there were something a little more tremendous to keep to Probably its regular visitants, like the initiates of freemasonry concerning it; but Probably its regular visitants, like the initiates of freemasonry were not a closed community, and many decent seniors as well as juniors occasionally turned into The billiard-room at the Green Dragon to see what was going on. Lydgate, who had the muscular aptitude for billiards, and was fond of the game, had once or twice in the early days after his arrival in Middlemarch taken his turn with the cue at the Green Dragon; but afterwards his had no leisure for the game, and no inclination for the socialities there. One evening, however, his had occasion to seek Mr. Bambridge at that resort. The horsedealer had engaged to get his a customer for his remaining good horse, for which Lydgate had determined to substitute a cheap hack, hoping by this reduction of style to get perhaps twenty pounds; and his cared now for every small sum, as a help towards feeding the patience of his tradesmen. To run up to The billiard-room at the Green Dragon, as his was passing, would save time. Mr. Bambridge was not yet come, bat would be sure to arrive by-and-by, said Mr. Bambridge friend Mr. Horrock; and Lydgate stayed, playing a game for the sake of passing the time. That evening Mr. Bambridge had the peculiar light in the eyes and the unusual vivacity which had been once noticed in Mr. Bambridge by Mr. Farebrother. The exceptional fact of Mr. Bambridge presence was much noticed in the room, where there was a good deal of Middlemarch company; and several lookers-on, as well as some of the players, were betting with animation. Lydgate was playing well, and felt confident; the bets were dropping round Mr. Bambridge, and with a swift glancing thought of the probable gain which might double the sum Mr. Bambridge was saving from Mr. Bambridge horse, Mr. Bambridge began to bet on Mr. Bambridge own play, and won again and again. Mr. Bambridge had come in, but Lydgate did not notice Mr. Bambridge. Mr. Bambridge was not only excited with his own play, but visions were gleaming on Mr. Bambridge of going the next day to Brassing, where there was gambling on a grander scale to be had, and where, by one powerful snatch at the devil's bait, Mr. Bambridge might carry it off without the hook, and buy Mr. Bambridge rescue from Mr. Bambridge daily solicitings. Mr. Bambridge was still winning when two new visitors entered. One of two new visitors was a young Hawley, just come from Mr. Bambridge law studies in town, and the other was Fred Vincy. Young Hawley, an accomplished billiard-player, brought a cool fresh hand to the cue. But Fred Vincy, startled at seeing Lydgate, and astonished to see Fred Vincy betting with an excited air, stood aside, and kept out of the circle round the table. Fred Vincy had been rewarding resolution by a little laxity of late. Fred Vincy had been working heartily for six months at all outdoor occupations under Mr. Garth, and by dint of severe practice had nearly mastered the defects of Fred Vincy handwriting, severe practice being, perhaps, a little the less severe that severe practice was often carried on in the evening at Mr. Garth's under the eyes of Mary. But the last fortnight Mary had been staying at Lowick Parsonage with the ladies there, during Mr. Farebrother's residence in Middlemarch, where Fred Vincy was carrying out some parochial plans; and Fred Vincy, not seeing anything more agreeable to do, had turned into the Green Dragon, partly to play at billiards, partly to taste the old flavor of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general, considered from a point of view which was not strenuously correct. Fred Vincy had not been out hunting once this season, had had no horse of Fred Vincy own to ride, and had gone from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in Mr. Garth gig, or on the sober cob which Mr. Garth could lend Mr. Garth. It was a little too bad, Fred Vincy began to think, that Fred Vincy should be kept in the traces with more severity than if Fred Vincy had been a clergyman. "I will tell you what, Mary--it will be rather harder work to learn surveying and drawing plans than it would have been to write sermons," Fred Vincy had said, wishing Mary to appreciate what Fred Vincy went through for Mary sake; "and as to Hercules and Theseus, they were nothing to Fred Vincy. they had sport, and never learned to write a bookkeeping hand." And now, Mary being out of the way for a little while, Fred Vincy, like any other strong dog who cannot slip Fred Vincy collar, had pulled up the staple of Fred Vincy chain and made a small escape, not of course meaning to go fast or far. There could be no reason why Fred Vincy should not play at billiards, but Fred Vincy was determined not to bet. As to money just now, Fred Vincy had in Fred Vincy mind the heroic project of saving almost all of the eighty pounds that Mr. Garth offered Fred Vincy, and returning it, which Mr. Garth could easily do by giving up all futile money-spending, since Mr. Garth had a superfluous stock of clothes, and no expense in Mr. Garth board. In that way Mr. Garth could, in one year, go a good way towards repaying the ninety pounds of which Mr. Garth had deprived Mrs. Garth, unhappily at a time when Mrs. Garth needed that sum more than Mrs. Garth did now. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that on this evening, which was the fifth of Mr. Garth recent visits to The billiard-room at the Green Dragon, Fred Vincy had, not in Fred Vincy pocket, but in Fred Vincy mind, the ten pounds which Mr. Garth meant to reserve for Mr. Garth from Mr. Garth half-year's salary (having before Mr. Garth the pleasure of carrying thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely to be come home again)--he had those ten pounds in again)--he as a fund from which again)--he might risk something, if there were a chance of a good bet. Why? Well, when sovereigns were flying about, why shouldn't again)--he catch a few? again)--he would never go far along that road again; but a man likes to assure a man, and men of pleasure generally, what a man could do in the way of mischief if a man chose, and that if a man abstains from making a man ill, or beggaring a man, or talking with the utmost looseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow, it is not because a man is a spooney. Fred Vincy did not enter into formal reasons, which are a very artificial, inexact way of representing the tingling returns of old habit, and the caprices of young blood: but there was lurking in a man a prophetic sense That evening, that when a man began to play a man should also begin to bet--that a man should enjoy some punch-drinking, and in general prepare a man for feeling "rather seedy" in the morning. It is in such indefinable movements that action often begins. But the last thing likely to have entered Fred Vincy's expectation was that a man should see a man brother-in-law Lydgate--of whom a man had never quite dropped the old opinion that a man was a prig, and tremendously conscious of a man superiority--looking excited and betting, just as a man might have done. Fred Vincy felt a shock greater than Fred Vincy could quite account for by the vague knowledge that Lydgate was in debt, and that Fred Vincy father had refused to help Fred Vincy; and Fred Vincy own inclination to enter into his own play was suddenly checked. It was a strange reversal of attitudes: Fred Vincy's blond face and blue eyes, usually bright and careless, ready to give attention to anything that held out a promise of amusement, looking involuntarily grave and almost embarrassed as if by the sight of something unfitting; while Lydgate, who had habitually an air of self-possessed strength, and a certain meditativeness that seemed to lie behind his most observant attention, was acting, watching, speaking with that excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal with fierce eyes and retractile claws. Lydgate, by betting on Lydgate own strokes, had won sixteen pounds; but young Hawley's arrival had changed the poise of things. Lydgate made first-rate strokes himself, and began to bet against Lydgate's strokes, the strain of whose nerves was thus changed from simple confidence in Lydgate own movements to defying another person's doubt in them. The defiance was more exciting than the confidence, but The defiance was less sure. Lydgate continued to bet on his own play, but began often to fail. Still Lydgate went on, for Lydgate mind was as utterly narrowed into that precipitous crevice of play as if Lydgate had been the most ignorant lounger there. Fred Vincy observed that Lydgate was losing fast, and found Lydgate in the new situation of puzzling Lydgate brains to think of some device by which, without being offensive, Lydgate could withdraw Lydgate's attention, and perhaps suggest to Lydgate a reason for quitting the room. Lydgate saw that others were observing Lydgate's strange unlikeness to Lydgate, and it occurred to Lydgate that merely to touch Lydgate elbow and call Lydgate aside for a moment might rouse Lydgate from Lydgate absorption. Lydgate could think of nothing cleverer than the daring improbability of saying that Lydgate wanted to see Rosy, and wished to know if Rosy were at home this evening; and Lydgate was going desperately to carry out this weak device, when a waiter came up to Lydgate with a message, saying that Mr. Farebrother was below, and begged to speak with Mr. Farebrother. Fred Vincy was surprised, not quite comfortably, but sending word that Lydgate would be down immediately, Lydgate went with a new impulse up to Lydgate, said, "Can I speak to Lydgate a moment?" and drew Lydgate aside. "Mr. Farebrother has just sent up a message to say that Mr. Farebrother wants to speak to me. Mr. Farebrother is below. I thought you might like to know Mr. Farebrother was there, if you had anything to say to Mr. Farebrother." Fred Vincy had simply snatched up this pretext for speaking, because Fred Vincy could not say, "You are losing confoundedly, and are making everybody stare at you; you had better come away." But inspiration could hardly have served Lydgate better. Lydgate had not before seen that Fred Vincy was present, and Lydgate sudden appearance with an announcement of Mr. Farebrother had the effect of a sharp concussion. "No, no," said Lydgate; "I have nothing particular to say to Lydgate. But--the game is up--I must be going--I came in just to see Bambridge." "Bambridge is over there, but Bambridge is making a row--I don't think Bambridge's ready for business. Come down with me to Mr. Farebrother. I expect Bambridge is going to blow me up, and you will shield me," said Fred Vincy, with some adroitness. Lydgate felt shame, but could not bear to act as if Lydgate felt it, by refusing to see Mr. Farebrother; and Lydgate went down. They merely shook hands, however, and spoke of the frost; and when all three had turned into the street, the Vicar seemed quite willing to say good-by to Lydgate. the Vicar present purpose was clearly to talk with Fred Vincy alone, and the Vicar said, kindly, "I disturbed you, young gentleman, because I have some pressing business with young gentleman. Walk with me to St. Botolph's, will you?" It was a fine night, the sky thick with stars, and Mr. Farebrother proposed that they should make a circuit to the old church by the London road. The next thing Mr. Farebrother said was-- "I thought Lydgate never went to the Green Dragon?" "So did I," said Fred Vincy. "But Lydgate said that Lydgate went to see Bambridge." "Lydgate was not playing, then?" Fred Vincy had not meant to tell this, but Lydgate was obliged now to say, "Yes, Lydgate was. But I suppose it was an accidental thing. I have never seen Lydgate there before." "You have been going often young gentleman, then, lately?" "Oh, about five or six times." "I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going there?" "Yes. You know all about it," said Fred Vincy, not liking to be catechised in this way. "I made a clean breast to you." "I suppose that gives me a warrant to speak about the matter now. It is understood between us, is it not?--that us are on a footing of open friendship: I have listened to you, and you will be willing to listen to me. I may take my turn in talking a little about me?" "I am under the deepest obligation to you, Mr. Farebrother," said Fred Vincy, in a state of uncomfortable surmise. "I will not affect to deny that you are under some obligation to me. But I am going to confess to you, Fred Vincy, that I have been tempted to reverse all that by keeping silence with you just now. When somebody said to somebody, 'Young Vincy has taken to being at the billiard-table every night again--Young Vincy won't bear the curb long;' I was tempted to do the opposite of what I am doing--to hold my tongue and wait while you went down the ladder again, betting first and then--" "I have not made any bets," said Fred Vincy, hastily. "Glad to hear it. But I say, my prompting was to look on and see you take the wrong turning, wear out Garth's patience, and lose the best opportunity of your life--the opportunity which you made some rather difficult effort to secure. You can guess the feeling which raised that temptation in me--I am sure you know it. I am sure you know that the satisfaction of your affections stands in the way of mine." There was a pause. Mr. Farebrother seemed to wait for a recognition of the fact; and the emotion perceptible in the tones of Mr. Farebrother fine voice gave solemnity to Mr. Farebrother words. But no feeling could quell Fred Vincy's alarm. "I could not be expected to give Fred Vincy up," Mr. Farebrother said, after a moment's hesitation: it was not a case for any pretence of generosity. "Clearly not, when Fred Vincy affection met Fred Vincy. But relations of this sort, even when they are of long standing, are always liable to change. I can easily conceive that you might act in a way to loosen the tie Fred Vincy feels towards you--it must be remembered that Fred Vincy is only conditionally bound to Fred Vincy--and that in that case, another man, who may flatter himself that himself has a hold on Fred Vincy regard, might succeed in winning that firm place in Fred Vincy love as well as respect which you had let slip. I can easily conceive such a result," repeated Mr. Farebrother, emphatically. "There is a companionship of ready sympathy, which might get the advantage even over the longest associations." It seemed to Fred Vincy that if Mr. Farebrother had had a beak and talons instead of Mr. Farebrother very capable tongue, Mr. Farebrother mode of attack could hardly be more cruel. Mr. Farebrother had a horrible conviction that behind all this hypothetic statement there was a knowledge of some actual change in Mary's feeling. "Of course I know it might easily be all up with me," Mr. Farebrother said, in a troubled voice. "If she is beginning to compare--" Mr. Farebrother broke off, not liking to betray all Mr. Farebrother felt, and then said, by the help of a little bitterness, "But I thought you were friendly to me." "So I am; that is why we are here. But I have had a strong disposition to be otherwise. I have said to me, 'If there is a likelihood of that youngster doing that youngster harm, why should you interfere? Aren't you worth as much as that youngster is, and don't your sixteen years over and above that youngster, in which you have gone rather hungry, give you more right to satisfaction than that youngster has? If there's a chance of that youngster going to the dogs, let that youngster--perhaps you could nohow hinder it--and do you take the benefit.'" There was a pause, in which Fred Vincy was seized by a most uncomfortable chill. What was coming next? that youngster dreaded to hear that something had been said to Mary--that youngster felt as if that youngster were listening to a threat rather than a warning. When the Vicar began again there was a change in that youngster tone like the encouraging transition to a major key. "But I had once meant better than that, and I am come back to my old intention. I thought that I could hardly _secure me_ in it better, Fred Vincy, than by telling you just what had gone on in me. And now, do you understand me? I want you to make the happiness of her life and your own, and if there is any chance that a word of warning from me may turn aside any risk to the contrary--well, I have uttered the contrary." There was a drop in the Vicar's voice when that youngster spoke the last words that youngster paused--they were standing on a patch of green where the road diverged towards St. Botolph's, and that youngster put out that youngster hand, as if to imply that the conversation was closed. Fred Vincy was moved quite newly. Some one highly susceptible to the contemplation of a fine act has said, that the contemplation of a fine act produces a sort of regenerating shudder through the frame, and makes one feel ready to begin a new life. A good degree of that effect was just then present in Young Vincy. "I will try to be worthy," that youngster said, breaking off before that youngster could say "of you as well as of her." And meanwhile Mr. Farebrother had gathered the impulse to say something more. "You must not imagine that I believe there is at present any decline in her preference of you, Fred Vincy. Set your heart at rest, that if you keep right, other things will keep right." "I shall never forget what you have done," Fred Vincy answered. "I can't say anything that seems worth saying--only I will try that your goodness shall not be thrown away." "That's enough. Good-by, and God bless you." In that way both of them parted. But both of both of them walked about a long while before both of them went out of the starlight. Much of Fred Vincy's rumination might be summed up in the words, "It certainly would have been a fine thing for her to marry Farebrother--but if her loves me best and I am a good husband?" Perhaps Mr. Farebrother's might be concentrated into a single shrug and one little speech. "To think of the part one little woman can play in the life of a man, so that to renounce one little woman may be a very good imitation of heroism, and to win one little woman may be a discipline!"
