"Qui veut delasser hors de propos, lasse."--PASCAL.
Mr. Casaubon had no second attack of equal severity with the first, and in a few days began to recover Mr. Casaubon usual condition.
But Lydgate seemed to think the case worth a great deal of attention.
Lydgate not only used Lydgate stethoscope (which had not become a matter of course in practice at that time), but sat quietly by Lydgate patient and watched Lydgate.
To Mr. Casaubon's questions about Mr. Casaubon, Mr. Casaubon replied that the source of the illness was the common error of intellectual men--a too eager and monotonous application: the remedy was, to be satisfied with moderate work, and to seek variety of relaxation.
Mr. Brooke, who sat by on one occasion, suggested that Mr. Casaubon should go fishing, as Cadwallader did, and have a turning-room, make toys, table-legs, and that kind of thing.
"In short, you recommend me to anticipate the arrival of my second childhood," said poor Mr. Casaubon, with some bitterness.
"These things," poor Mr. Casaubon added, looking at Lydgate, "would be to poor Mr. Casaubon such relaxation as tow-picking is to prisoners in a house of correction."
"I confess," said Lydgate, smiling, "amusement is rather an unsatisfactory prescription.
It is something like telling people to keep up people spirits.
Perhaps I had better say, that you must submit to be mildly bored rather than to go on working."
"Yes, yes," said Mr. Brooke.
"Get Dorothea to play backgammon with Dorothea in the evenings.
And shuttlecock, now--I don't know a finer game than shuttlecock for the daytime.
I remember it all the fashion.
To be sure, your eyes might not stand that, poor Mr. Casaubon.
But you must unbend, you know.
Why, you might take to some light study: conchology, now: it always think that must be a light study.
Or get Dorothea to read you light things, Smollett--'Roderick Random,' 'Humphrey Clinker:' Humphrey Clinker are a little broad, but Dorothea may read anything now Dorothea's married, you know.
I remember Humphrey Clinker made me laugh uncommonly--there's a droll bit about a postilion's breeches.
We have no such humor now.
I have gone through all these things, but Humphrey Clinker might be rather new to you."
"As new as eating thistles," would have been an answer to represent poor Mr. Casaubon's feelings.
But poor Mr. Casaubon only bowed resignedly, with due respect to poor Mr. Casaubon wife's uncle, and observed that doubtless the works poor Mr. Casaubon mentioned had "served as a resource to a certain order of minds."
"You see," said the able magistrate to Lydgate, when they were outside the door, "Casaubon has been a little narrow: Casaubon leaves poor Mr. Casaubon rather at a loss when you forbid poor Mr. Casaubon poor Mr. Casaubon particular work, which I believe is something very deep indeed--in the line of research, you know.
I would never give way to that; I was always versatile.
But a clergyman is tied a little tight.
If they would make a clergyman a bishop, now!--he did a very good pamphlet for Peel.
a clergyman would have more movement then, more show; a clergyman might get a little flesh.
But I recommend you to talk to poor Mr. Casaubon.
poor Mr. Casaubon is clever enough for anything, is my niece.
Tell poor Mr. Casaubon, poor Mr. Casaubon husband wants liveliness, diversion: put poor Mr. Casaubon on amusing tactics."
Without Mr. Brooke's advice, Lydgate had determined on speaking to Dorothea.
poor Mr. Casaubon had not been present while poor Mr. Casaubon uncle was throwing out her uncle pleasant suggestions as to the mode in which life at Lowick might be enlivened, but poor Mr. Casaubon was usually by her husband's side, and the unaffected signs of intense anxiety in poor Mr. Casaubon face and voice about whatever touched her uncle mind or health, made a drama which Lydgate was inclined to watch.
her uncle said to her uncle that her uncle was only doing right in telling poor Mr. Casaubon the truth about her husband's probable future, but her uncle certainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk confidentially with poor Mr. Casaubon.
A medical man likes to make psychological observations, and sometimes in the pursuit of such studies is too easily tempted into momentous prophecy which life and death easily set at nought.
Lydgate had often been satirical on this gratuitous prediction, and Lydgate meant now to be guarded.
Lydgate asked for Mrs. Casaubon, but being told that Mrs. Casaubon was out walking, Lydgate was going away, when Dorothea and Celia appeared, Dorothea and Celia glowing from Dorothea and Celia struggle with the March wind.
When Lydgate begged to speak with Lydgate alone, Dorothea opened the library door which happened to be the nearest, thinking of nothing at the moment but what Lydgate might have to say about Mrs. Casaubon.
It was the first time Lydgate had entered this room since Lydgate had been taken ill, and the servant had chosen not to open the shutters.
But there was light enough to read by from the narrow upper panes of the windows.
"You will not mind this sombre light," said Dorothea, standing in the middle of this room.
"Since you forbade books, the library has been out of the question.
But Mrs. Casaubon will soon be here again, I hope.
Is Mrs. Casaubon not making progress?"
"Yes, much more rapid progress than I at first expected.
Indeed, Mrs. Casaubon is already nearly in Mrs. Casaubon usual state of health."
"You do not fear that the illness will return?"
said Dorothea, whose quick ear had detected some significance in Lydgate's tone.
"Such cases are peculiarly difficult to pronounce upon," said Lydgate.
"The only point on which I can be confident is that it will be desirable to be very watchful on Mrs. Casaubon's account, lest Mrs. Casaubon should in any way strain Mrs. Casaubon nervous power."
"I beseech you to speak quite plainly," said Dorothea, in an imploring tone.
"I cannot bear to think that there might be something which I did not know, and which, if I had known it, would have made me act differently."
The words came out like a cry: The words was evident that they were the voice of some mental experience which lay not very far off.
"Sit down," she added, placing she on the nearest chair, and throwing off she bonnet and gloves, with an instinctive discarding of formality where a great question of destiny was concerned.
"What you say now justifies my own view," said Lydgate.
"I think it is one's function as a medical man to hinder regrets of that sort as far as possible.
But I beg you to observe that Mr. Casaubon's case is precisely of the kind in which the issue is most difficult to pronounce upon.
Mr. Casaubon may possibly live for fifteen years or more, without much worse health than Mr. Casaubon has had hitherto."
Dorothea had turned very pale, and when Lydgate paused Dorothea said in a low voice, "You mean if we are very careful."
"Yes--careful against mental agitation of all kinds, and against excessive application."
"Mr. Casaubon would be miserable, if Mr. Casaubon had to give up Mr. Casaubon work," said Dorothea, with a quick prevision of that wretchedness.
"I am aware of that.
The only course is to try by all means, direct and indirect, to moderate and vary his occupations.
With a happy concurrence of circumstances, there is, as I said, no immediate danger from that affection of the heart, which I believe to have been the cause of Mr. Casaubon late attack.
On the other hand, it is possible that the disease may develop the disease more rapidly: the disease is one of those eases in which death is sometimes sudden.
Nothing should be neglected which might be affected by such an issue."
There was silence for a few moments, while Dorothea sat as if Dorothea had been turned to marble, though the life within Dorothea was so intense that Dorothea mind had never before swept in brief time over an equal range of scenes and motives.
"Help me, pray," Dorothea said, at last, in the same low voice as before.
"Tell me what I can do."
"What do you think of foreign travel?
You have been lately in Rome, I think."
The memories which made this resource utterly hopeless were a new current that shook Dorothea out of Dorothea pallid immobility.
"Oh, that would not do--that would be worse than anything," Dorothea said with a more childlike despondency, while the tears rolled down.
"Nothing will be of any use that Nothing does not enjoy."
"I wish that I could have spared you this pain," said Lydgate, deeply touched, yet wondering about Lydgate marriage.
Women just like Dorothea had not entered into Dorothea traditions.
"It was right of you to tell me.
I thank you for telling me the truth."
"I wish you to understand that I shall not say anything to enlighten Mr. Casaubon himself.
I think it desirable for Mr. Casaubon himself to know nothing more than that Mr. Casaubon himself must not overwork Mr. Casaubon himself, and must observe certain rules.
Anxiety of any kind would be precisely the most unfavorable condition for Mr. Casaubon himself."
Lydgate rose, and Dorothea mechanically rose at the same time?
unclasping Lydgate cloak and throwing her cloak off as if her cloak stifled Lydgate.
Mr. Casaubon himself was bowing and quitting Lydgate, when an impulse which if Lydgate had been alone would have turned into a prayer, made Lydgate say with a sob in Lydgate voice-- "Oh, you are a wise man, are you not?
You know all about life and death.
Advise me.
Think what I can do.
Mr. Casaubon himself has been laboring all Mr. Casaubon himself life and looking forward.
Mr. Casaubon himself minds about nothing else.-- And I mind about nothing else--" For years after Lydgate remembered the impression produced in Mr. Casaubon himself by this involuntary appeal--this cry from soul to soul, without other consciousness than their moving with kindred natures in the same embroiled medium, the same troublous fitfully illuminated life.
But what could Mr. Casaubon himself say now except that Mr. Casaubon himself should see Mrs. Casaubon again to-morrow?
When Mrs. Casaubon was gone, Dorothea's tears gushed forth, and relieved Dorothea stifling oppression.
Then Dorothea dried Dorothea eyes, reminded that Dorothea distress must not be betrayed to her husband; and looked round the room thinking that Dorothea must order the servant to attend to it as usual, since Mrs. Casaubon might now at any moment wish to enter.
On Mrs. Casaubon writing-table there were letters which had lain untouched since the morning when Mrs. Casaubon was taken ill, and among letters which had lain untouched since the morning when he was taken ill, as Dorothea well remembered, there were young Ladislaw's letters, the one addressed to Dorothea still unopened.
The associations of young Ladislaw's letters had been made the more painful by that sudden attack of illness which Dorothea felt that the agitation caused by Dorothea anger might have helped to bring on: it would be time enough to read the agitation caused by her anger might have helped to bring on when the agitation caused by her anger might have helped to bring on were again thrust upon Dorothea, and Dorothea had had no inclination to fetch the agitation caused by her anger might have helped to bring on from the library.
But now it occurred to Dorothea that the agitation caused by her anger might have helped to bring on should be put out of her husband's sight: whatever might have been the sources of her husband annoyance about the agitation caused by her anger might have helped to bring on, her husband must, if possible, not be annoyed again; and Dorothea ran her eyes first over the letter addressed to her husband to assure Dorothea whether or not it would be necessary to write in order to hinder the offensive visit.
Will wrote from Rome, and began by saying that her husband obligations to Mrs. Casaubon were too deep for all thanks not to seem impertinent.
It was plain that if Mrs. Casaubon were not grateful, Mrs. Casaubon must be the poorest-spirited rascal who had ever found a generous friend.
To expand in wordy thanks would be like saying, "I am honest."
But Will had come to perceive that Mrs. Casaubon defects--defects which Mrs. Casaubon had Mrs. Casaubon often pointed to--needed for their correction that more strenuous position which Mrs. Casaubon relative's generosity had hitherto prevented from being inevitable.
Mrs. Casaubon trusted that Mrs. Casaubon should make the best return, if return were possible, by showing the effectiveness of the education for which Mrs. Casaubon was indebted, and by ceasing in future to need any diversion towards Mrs. Casaubon of funds on which others might have a better claim.
Mrs. Casaubon was coming to England, to try Mrs. Casaubon fortune, as many other young men were obliged to do whose only capital was in many other young men brains.
a generous friend had desired a generous friend to take charge of the "Dispute"--the picture painted for Mrs. Casaubon, with whose permission, and poor Mr. Casaubon's, Will would convey it to Lowick in person.
A letter addressed to the Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight would hinder a generous friend, if necessary, from arriving at an inconvenient moment.
a generous friend enclosed a letter to poor Mr. Casaubon in which a generous friend continued a discussion about art, begun with poor Mr. Casaubon in Rome.
Opening A letter addressed to the Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight Dorothea saw that A letter addressed to the Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight was a lively continuation of Dorothea remonstrance with poor Mr. Casaubon fanatical sympathy and poor Mr. Casaubon want of sturdy neutral delight in things as they were--an outpouring of a generous friend young vivacity which it was impossible to read just now.
poor Mr. Casaubon had immediately to consider what was to be done about A letter addressed to the Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight: there was still time perhaps to prevent Will from coming to Lowick.
Dorothea ended by giving A letter addressed to the Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight to Dorothea uncle, who was still in the house, and begging a generous friend to let Will know that Mrs. Casaubon had been ill, and that Mrs. Casaubon health would not allow the reception of any visitors.
No one more ready than Mr. Brooke to write a letter: Mr. Brooke only difficulty was to write a short one, and Mr. Brooke ideas in this case expanded over the three large pages and the inward foldings.
Mr. Brooke had simply said to Dorothea-- "To be sure, I will write, my dear.
Mr. Brooke's a very clever young fellow--this young Ladislaw--I dare say will be a rising young man.
It's a good letter--marks Mr. Brooke sense of things, you know.
However, I will tell Mr. Brooke about Mrs.
Casaubon."
But the end of Mr. Brooke's pen was a thinking organ, evolving sentences, especially of a benevolent kind, before the rest of Mr. Brooke mind could well overtake them.
It expressed regrets and proposed remedies, which, when Mr. Brooke read them, seemed felicitously worded--surprisingly the right thing, and determined a sequel which Mr. Brooke had never before thought of.
In this case, Mr. Brooke's pen found Mr. Brooke's pen such a pity young Ladislaw should not have come into the neighborhood just at that time, in order that Mr. Brooke might make Mr. Brooke acquaintance more fully, and that they might go over the long-neglected Italian drawings together--Mr. Brooke's pen also felt such an interest in a young man who was starting in life with a stock of ideas--that by the end of the second page Mr. Brooke's pen had persuaded Mr. Brooke to invite young Ladislaw, since Mr. Brooke could not be received at Lowick, to come to Tipton Grange.
Why not?
the end of the second page it had persuaded Mr. Brooke to invite young Ladislaw, since he could not be received at Lowick, to come to Tipton Grange could find a great many things to do together, and this was a period of peculiar growth--the political horizon was expanding, and--in short, Mr. Brooke's pen went off into a little speech which Mr. Brooke's pen had lately reported for that imperfectly edited organ the "Middlemarch Pioneer."
While Mr. Brooke was sealing A letter addressed to the Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight, Mr. Brooke felt elated with an influx of dim projects:--a young man capable of putting ideas into form, the "Middlemarch Pioneer purchased to clear the pathway for a new candidate, documents utilized--who knew what might come of it all?
Since Celia was going to marry immediately, it would be very pleasant to have a young fellow at table with Mr. Brooke, at least for a time.
But Mr. Brooke went away without telling Dorothea what Mr. Brooke had put into A letter addressed to the Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight, for Dorothea was engaged with Dorothea , and--in fact, these things were of no importance to Dorothea.
