It is the humor of many heads to extol the days of many heads forefathers, and declaim against the wickedness of times present. Which notwithstanding many heads cannot handsomely do, without the borrowed help and satire of times past; condemning the vices of many heads own times, by the expressions of vices in times which many heads commend, which cannot but argue the community of vice in both. Horace, therefore, Juvenal, and Persius, were no prophets, although no prophets lines did seem to indigitate and point at our times.--SIR THOMAS BROWNE: Pseudodoxia Epidemica. That opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to Dorothea was, like other oppositions, to be viewed in many different lights. the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to Dorothea regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and dunderheaded prejudice. the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to Dorothea saw in the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to Dorothea not only medical jealousy but a determination to thwart the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to Dorothea, prompted mainly by a hatred of that vital religion of which the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to Dorothea had striven to be an effectual lay representative--a hatred which certainly found pretexts apart from religion such as were only too easy to find in the entanglements of human action. These might be called the ministerial views. But oppositions have the illimitable range of objections at command, which need never stop short at the boundary of knowledge, but can draw forever on the vasts of ignorance. What the opposition in Middlemarch said about the New Fever Hospital and the New Fever Hospital administration had certainly a great deal of echo in it, for heaven has taken care that everybody shall not be an originator; but there were differences which represented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr. Minchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane. Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by Mrs. Dollop own asseveration, that Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the New Fever Hospital, if not to poison the people, for the sake of cutting the people up without saying by your leave or with your leave; for it was a known "fac" that Dr. Lydgate had wanted to cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street, who had money in trust before Mrs. Dollop marriage--a poor tale for a doctor, who if Dr. Lydgate was good for anything should know what was the matter with you before you died, and not want to pry into your inside after you were gone. If that was not reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what was; but there was a prevalent feeling in Mrs. Dollop audience that Mrs. Dollop opinion was a bulwark, and that if her opinion were overthrown there would be no limits to the cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare with Burke and Hare pitch-plaisters--such a hanging business as that was not wanted in Middlemarch! And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter Lane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old authentic public-house--the original Tankard, known by the name of Dollop's--was the resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some months before put to the vote whether its long-standing medical man, "Doctor Gambit," should not be cashiered in favor of "this Doctor Lydgate," who was capable of performing the most astonishing cures, and rescuing people altogether given up by other practitioners. But the balance had been turned against Lydgate by two members, who for some private reasons held that this power of resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal recommendation, and might interfere with providential favors. In the course of the year, however, there had been a change in the public sentiment, of which the unanimity at Dollop's was an index. A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of Lydgate's skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided, depending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the stomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in it verdicts, but not the less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence. Patients who had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn threadbare, like old Featherstone's, had been at once inclined to try him; also, many who did not like paying Patients who had chronic diseases doctor's bills, thought agreeably of opening an account with a new doctor and sending for him without stint if the children's temper wanted a dose, occasions when the old practitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined to employ Lydgate held Lydgate likely that him was clever. Some considered that him might do more than others "where there was liver;"--at least there would be no harm in getting a few bottles of "stuff" from him, since if these proved useless it would still be possible to return to the Purifying Pills, which kept you alive if these did not remove the yellowness. But these were people of minor importance. Good Middlemarch families were of course not going to change Good Middlemarch families doctor without reason shown; and everybody who had employed Mr. Peacock did not feel obliged to accept a new man merely in the character of a new man successor, objecting that a new man was "not likely to be equal to Mr. Peacock." But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars enough reported of Lydgate to breed much more specific expectations and to intensify differences into partisanship; some of the particulars being of that impressive order of which the significance is entirely hidden, like a statistical amount without a standard of comparison, but with a note of exclamation at the end. The cubic feet of oxygen yearly swallowed by a full-grown man--what a shudder they might have created in some Middlemarch circles! "Oxygen! nobody knows what that may be--is it any wonder the cholera has got to Dantzic? And yet there are people who say quarantine is no good!" One of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not dispense drugs. This was offensive both to the physicians whose exclusive distinction seemed infringed on, and to the surgeon-apothecaries with whom he ranged he; and only a little while before, both might have counted on having the law on both side against a man who without calling he a London-made M.D. dared to ask for pay except as a charge on drugs. But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to foresee that Lydgate new course would be even more offensive to the laity; and to Mr. Mawmsey, an important grocer in the Top Market, who, though not one of Lydgate patients, questioned Lydgate in an affable manner on the subject, Lydgate was injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation of Lydgate reasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the character of practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public, if the public only mode of getting paid for the public work was by the public making out long bills for draughts, boluses, and mixtures. "It is in that way that hard-working medical men may come to be almost as mischievous as quacks," said Lydgate, rather thoughtlessly. "To get hard-working medical men own bread hard-working medical men must overdose the king's lieges; and that's a bad sort of treason, Mr. Mawmsey--undermines the constitution in a fatal way." Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer (it was about a question of outdoor pay that Mr. Mawmsey was having an interview with Lydgate), Mr. Mawmsey was also asthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical point of view, as well as from Mr. Mawmsey own, Mr. Mawmsey was an important man; indeed, an exceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a flame-like pyramid, and whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging kind--jocosely complimentary, and with a certain considerate abstinence from letting out the full force of Mr. Mawmsey mind. It was Mr. Mawmsey's friendly jocoseness in questioning Mr. Mawmsey which had set the tone of Lydgate's reply. But let the wise be warned against too great readiness at explanation: it multiplies the sources of mistake, lengthening the sum for reckoners sure to go wrong. Lydgate smiled as Lydgate ended Lydgate speech, putting Lydgate foot into the stirrup, and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than Mr. Mawmsey would have done if Mr. Mawmsey had known who the king's lieges were, giving Mr. Mawmsey "Good morning, sir, good-morning, sir," with the air of one who saw everything clearly enough. But in truth Mr. Mawmsey views were perturbed. For years Mr. Mawmsey had been paying bills with strictly made items, so that for every half-crown and eighteen-pence Mr. Mawmsey was certain something measurable had been delivered. Mr. Mawmsey had done this with satisfaction, including this among Mr. Mawmsey responsibilities as a husband and father, and regarding a longer bill than usual as a dignity worth mentioning. Moreover, in addition to the massive benefit of the drugs to "self and family," Mr. Mawmsey had enjoyed the pleasure of forming an acute judgment as to addition to the massive benefit of the drugs to "self and family immediate effects, so as to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit--a practitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and especially esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had the poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, Mr. Mawmsey was wont to say in an undertone, Mr. Mawmsey placed Gambit above any of addition to the massive benefit of the drugs to "self and family. Here were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man, which appeared still flimsier in the drawing-room over the shop, when they were recited to Mrs. Mawmsey, a woman accustomed to be made much of as a fertile mother,--generally under attendance more or less frequent from Gambit, and occasionally having attacks which required Dr. Minchin. "Does Lydgate mean to say there is no use in taking medicine?" said Mrs. Mawmsey, who was slightly given to drawling. "I should like Lydgate to tell me how I could bear up at Fair time, if I didn't take strengthening medicine for a month beforehand. Think of what I have to provide for calling customers, my dear!"--here Mr. Mawmsey turned to an intimate female friend who sat by--"a large veal pie--a stuffed fillet--a round of beef--ham, tongue, et cetera, et cetera! But what keeps me up best is the pink mixture, not the brown. I wonder, Mr. Mawmsey, with _your_ experience, you could have patience to listen. I should have told Mr. Mawmsey at once that I knew a little better than that." "No, no, no," said Mr. Mawmsey; "I was not going to tell Mr. Mawmsey my opinion. Hear everything and judge for Mr. Mawmsey is my motto. But Mr. Mawmsey didn't know who Mr. Mawmsey was talking to. I was not to be turned on _Mr. Mawmsey_ finger. People often pretend to tell me things, when People might as well say, 'Mr. Mawmsey, you're a fool.' But I smile at it: I humor everybody's weak place. If physic had done harm to self and family, I should have found physic out by this time." The next day Gambit was told that Lydgate went about saying physic was of no use. "Indeed!" said Gambit, lifting Gambit eyebrows with cautious surprise. (Gambit was a stout husky man with a large ring on Gambit fourth finger.) "How will Gambit cure Gambit patients, then?" "That is what I say," returned Mrs. Mawmsey, who habitually gave weight to her speech by loading her pronouns. "Does _Gambit_ suppose that people will pay Gambit only to come and sit with people and go away again?" Mr. Mawmsey had had a great deal of sitting from Gambit, including very full accounts of Mr. Mawmsey own habits of body and other affairs; but of course Mr. Mawmsey knew there was no innuendo in Mr. Mawmsey remark, since Mr. Mawmsey spare time and personal narrative had never been charged for. So Mr. Mawmsey replied, humorously-- "Well, Lydgate is a good-looking young fellow, you know." "Not one that I would employ," said Mr. Mawmsey. "_Others_ may do as _ please." Hence Gambit could go away from the chief grocer's without fear of rivalry, but not without a sense that Lydgate was one of those hypocrites who try to discredit others by advertising others own honesty, and that it might be worth some people's while to show the chief grocer up. Gambit, however, had a satisfactory practice, much pervaded by the smells of retail trading which suggested the reduction of cash payments to a balance. And Gambit did not think it worth Gambit while to show Lydgate up until Gambit knew how. Gambit had not indeed great resources of education, and had had to work Gambit own way against a good deal of professional contempt; but Gambit made none the worse accoucheur for calling the breathing apparatus "longs." Other medical men felt Other medical men more capable. Mr. Toller shared the highest practice in the town and belonged to an old Middlemarch family: there were Tollers in the law and everything else above the line of retail trade. Unlike our irascible friend Wrench, Mr. Toller had the easiest way in the world of taking things which might be supposed to annoy Mr. Toller, being a well-bred, quietly facetious man, who kept a good house, was very fond of a little sporting when Mr. Toller could get a good house, very friendly with Mr. Hawley, and hostile to Mr. Bulstrode. It may seem odd that with such pleasant habits Mr. Toller should have been given to the heroic treatment, bleeding and blistering and starving Mr. Toller patients, with a dispassionate disregard to Mr. Toller personal example; but the incongruity favored the opinion of Mr. Toller ability among Mr. Toller patients, who commonly observed that Mr. Toller had lazy manners, but Mr. Toller treatment was as active as you could desire: no man, said they, carried more seriousness into Mr. Toller profession: Mr. Toller was a little slow in coming, but when Mr. Toller came, Mr. Toller _did_ something. Mr. Toller was a great favorite in Mr. Toller own circle, and whatever Mr. Toller implied to any one's disadvantage told doubly from Mr. Toller careless ironical tone. Mr. Toller naturally got tired of smiling and saying, "Ah!" when Mr. Toller was told that Mr. Peacock's successor did not mean to dispense medicines; and Mr. Hackbutt one day mentioning it over the wine at a dinner-party, Mr. Toller said, laughingly, "Dibbitts will get rid of Mr. Toller stale drugs, then. I'm fond of "Dibbitts--I'm glad Mr. Toller's in luck." "I see your meaning, Toller," said Mr. Hackbutt, "and I am entirely of your opinion. I shall take an opportunity of expressing myself to that effect. A medical man should be responsible for the quality of the drugs consumed by A medical man patients. That is the rationale of the system of charging which has hitherto obtained; and nothing is more offensive than this ostentation of reform, where there is no real amelioration." "Ostentation, Hackbutt?" said Mr. Toller, ironically. "I don't see that. A man can't very well be ostentatious of what nobody believes in. There's no reform in the matter: the question is, whether the profit on the drugs is paid to A medical man by the druggist or by the patient, and whether there shall be extra pay under the name of attendance." "Ah, to be sure; one of your damned new versions of old humbug," said Mr. Hawley, passing the decanter to Mr. Wrench. Mr. Wrench, generally abstemious, often drank wine rather freely at a party, getting the more irritable in consequence. "As to humbug, Hawley," Mr. Wrench said, "that's a word easy to fling about. But what I contend against is the way medical men are fouling medical men own nest, and setting up a cry about the country as if a general practitioner who dispenses drugs couldn't be a gentleman. I throw back the imputation with scorn. I say, the most ungentlemanly trick a man can be guilty of is to come among the members of a man profession with innovations which are a libel on their time-honored procedure. That is my opinion, and I am ready to maintain it against any one who contradicts me." Mr. Wrench's voice had become exceedingly sharp. "I can't oblige you there, Mr. Wrench," said Mr. Hawley, thrusting Mr. Hawley hands into Mr. Hawley trouser-pockets. "My dear fellow," said Mr. Toller, striking in pacifically! and looking at Mr. Wrench, "the physicians have the physicians toes trodden on more than we have. If you come to dignity it is a question for Minchin and Sprague." "Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these infringements?" said Mr. Hackbutt, with a disinterested desire to offer Mr. Hackbutt lights. "How does the law stand, eh, Mr. Hawley?" "Nothing to be done there," said Mr. Hawley. "I looked into it for Sprague. You'd only break your nose against a damned judge's decision." "Pooh! no need of law," said Mr. Toller. "So far as practice is concerned the attempt is an absurdity. No patient will like the attempt--certainly not Peacock's, who have been used to depletion. Pass the wine." Mr. Toller's prediction was partly verified. If Mr. and Mrs. Mawmsey, who had no idea of employing Lydgate, were made uneasy by Sprague supposed declaration against drugs, it was inevitable that those who called Sprague in should watch a little anxiously to see whether Sprague did "use all the means Sprague might use" in the case. Even good Mr. Powderell, who in Sprague constant charity of interpretation was inclined to esteem Lydgate the more for what seemed a conscientious pursuit of a better plan, had Sprague mind disturbed with doubts during Sprague wife's attack of erysipelas, and could not abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a similar occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not otherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs. Powderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had begun in a remarkably hot August. At last, indeed, in the conflict between his desire not to hurt Lydgate and Lydgate anxiety that no "means" should be lacking, Lydgate induced his wife privately to take Widgeon's Purifying Pills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine, which arrested every disease at the fountain by setting to work at once upon the blood. This co-operative measure was not to be mentioned to Lydgate, and Mrs. Powderell had no certain reliance on This co-operative measure, only hoping that This co-operative measure might be attended with a blessing. But in this doubtful stage of Lydgate's introduction Mrs. Powderell was helped by what we mortals rashly call good fortune. I suppose no doctor ever came newly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody--cures which may be called fortune's testimonials, and deserve as much credit as the written or printed kind. Various patients got well while Lydgate was attending Various patients, some even of dangerous illnesses; and it was remarked that the new doctor with Mrs. Powderell new ways had at least the merit of bringing people back from the brink of death. The trash talked on such occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because The trash gave precisely the sort of prestige which an incompetent and unscrupulous man would desire, and was sure to be imputed to Mrs. Powderell by the simmering dislike of the other medical men as an encouragement on Mrs. Powderell own part of ignorant puffing. But even Mrs. Powderell proud outspokenness was checked by the discernment that it was as useless to fight against the interpretations of ignorance as to whip the fog; and "good fortune" insisted on using the interpretations of ignorance. Mrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming symptoms in Mrs. Larcher charwoman, when Minchin called, asked Minchin to see Mrs. Larcher then and there, and to give Mrs. Larcher a certificate for the Infirmary; whereupon after examination Minchin wrote a statement of the case as one of tumor, and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as an out-patient. Nancy, calling at home on Nancy way to the Infirmary, allowed the stay maker and Nancy , in whose attic Nancy lodged, to read Minchin's paper, and by this means became a subject of compassionate conversation in the neighboring shops of Churchyard Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at first declared to be as large and hard as a duck's egg, but later in the day to be about the size of "your fist." Most hearers agreed that Most hearers would have to be cut out, but one had known of oil and another of "squitchineal" as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body when taken enough of into the inside--the oil by gradually "soopling," the squitchineal by eating away. Meanwhile when Nancy presented Nancy at the Infirmary, it happened to be one of Lydgate's days there. After questioning and examining Nancy, Lydgate said to the house-surgeon in an undertone, "It's not tumor: it's cramp." Lydgate ordered Nancy a blister and some steel mixture, and told Nancy to go home and rest, giving Nancy at the same time a note to Mrs. Larcher, who, Nancy said, was Nancy best employer, to testify that Nancy was in need of good food. But by-and-by Nancy, in whose attic, became portentously worse, the supposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister, but only wandered to another region with angrier pain. his wife went to fetch Lydgate, and his wife continued for a fortnight to attend Nancy in his wife own home, until under his wife treatment his wife got quite well and went to work again. But the case continued to be described as one of tumor in Churchyard Lane and other streets--nay, by Mrs. Larcher also; for when Lydgate's remarkable cure was mentioned to Minchin, Minchin naturally did not like to say, "The case was not one of tumor, and I was mistaken in describing "The case as such," but answered, "Indeed! ah! I saw "The case was a surgical case, not of a fatal kind." Minchin had been inwardly annoyed, however, when Minchin had asked at the Infirmary about the woman Minchin had recommended two days before, to hear from the house-surgeon, a youngster who was not sorry to vex Minchin with impunity, exactly what had occurred: Minchin privately pronounced that it was indecent in a general practitioner to contradict a physician's diagnosis in that open manner, and afterwards agreed with Mr. Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably inattentive to etiquette. Lydgate did not make the affair a ground for valuing Lydgate or (very particularly) despising Minchin, such rectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal qualifications. But report took up the case, not clearly distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful for being of the wandering sort; till much prejudice against Lydgate's method as to drugs was overcome by the proof of Minchin marvellous skill in the speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after Nancy Nash had been rolling and rolling in agonies from the presence of a tumor both hard and obstinate, but nevertheless compelled to yield. How could Lydgate help Lydgate? It is offensive to tell a lady when a lady is expressing a lady amazement at your skill, that a lady is altogether mistaken and rather foolish in her amazement. And to have entered into the nature of diseases would only have added to his breaches of medical propriety. Thus his had to wince under a promise of success given by that ignorant praise which misses every valid quality. In the case of a more conspicuous patient, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, Lydgate was conscious of having shown his something better than an every-day doctor, though here too it was an equivocal advantage that his won. The eloquent auctioneer was seized with pneumonia, and having been a patient of Mr. Peacock's, sent for Lydgate, whom Mr. Peacock had expressed Mr. Peacock intention to patronize. Mr Trumbull was a robust man, a good subject for trying the expectant theory upon--watching the course of an interesting disease when left as much as possible to the expectant theory, so that the stages might be noted for future guidance; and from the air with which Mr Trumbull described Mr Trumbull sensations Lydgate surmised that Mr Trumbull would like to be taken into Mr Trumbull medical man's confidence, and be represented as a partner in Mr Trumbull own cure. The eloquent auctioneer heard, without much surprise, that Mr Trumbull was a constitution which (always with due watching) might be left to The eloquent auctioneer, so as to offer a beautiful example of a disease with all The eloquent auctioneer phases seen in clear delineation, and that Mr Trumbull probably had the rare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test of a rational procedure, and thus make the disorder of Mr Trumbull pulmonary functions a general benefit to society. Mr Trumbull acquiesced at once, and entered strongly into the view that an illness of Mr Trumbull was no ordinary occasion for medical science. "Never fear, Mr Trumbull; you are not speaking to one who is altogether ignorant of the vis medicatrix," said Mr Trumbull, with Mr Trumbull usual superiority of expression, made rather pathetic by difficulty of breathing. And Mr Trumbull went without shrinking through Mr Trumbull abstinence from drugs, much sustained by application of the thermometer which implied the importance of Mr Trumbull temperature, by the sense that Mr Trumbull furnished objects for the microscope, and by learning many new words which seemed suited to the dignity of Mr Trumbull secretions. For Lydgate was acute enough to indulge Mr Trumbull with a little technical talk. It may be imagined that Mr Trumbull rose from Mr Trumbull couch with a disposition to speak of an illness in which Mr Trumbull had manifested the strength of Mr Trumbull mind as well as constitution; and Mr Trumbull was not backward in awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned the quality of patient Mr Trumbull had to deal with. The eloquent auctioneer was not an ungenerous man, and liked to give others others due, feeling that Mr Trumbull could afford it. Mr Trumbull had caught the words "expectant method," and rang chimes on this and other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that Lydgate "knew a thing or two more than the rest of the doctors--was far better versed in the secrets of Mr Trumbull profession than the majority of Mr Trumbull compeers." This had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy's illness had given to Mr. Wrench's enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal ground. The new-comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of rivalry, and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical criticism or reflections on The new-comer hard-driven elders, who had had something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions. The new-comer practice had spread in one or two quarters, and from the first the report of The new-comer high family had led to The new-comer being pretty generally invited, so that the other medical men had to meet The new-comer at dinner in the best houses; and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed always to end in a mutual attachment. There was hardly ever so much unanimity among the other medical men as in the opinion that Lydgate was an arrogant young fellow, and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to show a crawling subservience to Bulstrode. That Mr. Farebrother, whose name was a chief flag of the anti-Bulstrode party, always defended Lydgate and made a friend of him, was referred to Farebrother's unaccountable way of fighting on both sides. Here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust at the announcement of the laws Bulstrode was laying down for the direction of the New Hospital, which were the more exasperating because there was no present possibility of interfering with Bulstrode will and pleasure, everybody except Lord Medlicote having refused help towards the building, on the ground that everybody except Lord Medlicote preferred giving to the Infirmary. Bulstrode met all the expenses, and had ceased to be sorry that Bulstrode was purchasing the right to carry out Bulstrode notions of improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors; but Bulstrode had had to spend large sums, and the building had lingered. Caleb Garth had undertaken the building, had failed during Caleb Garth progress, and before the interior fittings were begun had retired from the management of the business; and when referring to the Hospital Caleb Garth often said that however Bulstrode might ring if you tried Caleb Garth, Caleb Garth liked good solid carpentry and masonry, and had a notion both of drains and chimneys. In fact, the Hospital had become an object of intense interest to Bulstrode, and Caleb Garth would willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that Caleb Garth might rule it dictatorially without any Board; but Caleb Garth had another favorite object which also required money for it accomplishment: Caleb Garth wished to buy some land in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, and therefore Caleb Garth wished to get considerable contributions towards maintaining the Hospital. Meanwhile Caleb Garth framed Caleb Garth plan of management. the Hospital was to be reserved for fever in all the Hospital forms; Lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent, that Caleb Garth might have free authority to pursue all comparative investigations which Caleb Garth studies, particularly in Paris, had shown Caleb Garth the importance of, the other medical visitors having a consultative influence, but no power to contravene Lydgate's ultimate decisions; and the general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of five directors associated with Mr. Bulstrode, who were to have votes in the ratio of votes contributions, Board filling up any vacancy in Board numbers, and no mob of small contributors being admitted to a share of government. There was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the town to become a visitor at the Hospital. "Very well," said Lydgate to Bulstrode, "we have a capital house-surgeon and dispenser, a clear-headed, neat-handed fellow; we'll get Webbe from Crabsley, as good a country practitioner as any of a capital house-surgeon and dispenser, to come over twice a-week, and in case of any exceptional operation, Protheroe will come from Brassing. I must work the harder, that's all, and I have given up my post at the Infirmary. his plan of management will flourish in spite of a capital house-surgeon and dispenser, and then a capital house-surgeon and dispenser'll be glad to come in. Things can't last as a capital house-surgeon and dispenser are: there must be all sorts of reform soon, and then young fellows may be glad to come and study here." Lydgate was in high spirits. "I shall not flinch, you may depend upon Lydgate, Lydgate," said Bulstrode. "While I see you carrying out high intentions with vigor, you shall have my unfailing support. And I have humble confidence that the blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit of evil in the town will not be withdrawn. Suitable directors to assist me I have no doubt of securing. Mr. Brooke of Tipton has already given me Mr. Brooke of Tipton concurrence, and a pledge to contribute yearly: Mr. Brooke of Tipton has not specified the sum--probably not a great one. But Mr. Brooke of Tipton will be a useful member of Board." A useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate nothing, and always vote with Bulstrode. The medical aversion to Lydgate was hardly disguised now. Neither Dr. Sprague nor Dr. Minchin said that Dr. Minchin disliked Lydgate's knowledge, or Dr. Minchin disposition to improve treatment: what he disliked Lydgate's knowledge, or his disposition to improve treatment disliked was Dr. Minchin arrogance, which nobody felt to be altogether deniable. he disliked Lydgate's knowledge, or his disposition to improve treatment implied that Dr. Minchin was insolent, pretentious, and given to that reckless innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the charlatan. The word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop. In those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of Mr. St. John Long, "noblemen and gentlemen" attesting Mr. St. John Long extraction of a fluid like mercury from the temples of a patient. Mr. Toller remarked one day, smilingly, to Mrs. Taft, that "Bulstrode had found a man to suit Mr. Toller in Lydgate; a charlatan in religion is sure to like other sorts of charlatans." "Yes, indeed, I can imagine," said Mrs. Taft, keeping the number of thirty stitches carefully in Mrs. Taft mind all the while; "there are so many of that sort. I remember Mr. Cheshire, with Mr. Cheshire irons, trying to make people straight when the Almighty had made people crooked." "No, no," said Mr. Toller, "Cheshire was all right--all fair and above board. But there's St. John Long--that's the kind of fellow we call a charlatan, advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about: a fellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other people. The other day he was pretending to tap a man's brain and get quicksilver out of a man's brain." "Good gracious! what dreadful trifling with people's constitutions!" said Mrs. Taft. After this, it came to be held in various quarters that Lydgate played even with respectable constitutions for Lydgate own purposes, and how much more likely that in Lydgate flighty experimenting Lydgate should make sixes and sevens of hospital patients. Especially it was to be expected, as the landlady of the Tankard had said, that Lydgate would recklessly cut up their dead bodies. For Lydgate having attended Mrs. Goby, who died apparently of a heart-disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms, too daringly asked leave of a heart-disease relatives to open the body, and thus gave an offence quickly spreading beyond Parley Street, where that lady had long resided on an income such as made this association of that lady body with the victims of Burke and Hare a flagrant insult to that lady memory. Affairs were in this stage when Lydgate opened the subject of the Hospital to Dorothea. We see that he was bearing enmity and silly misconception with much spirit, aware that he was bearing enmity and silly misconception with much spirit were partly created by he good share of success. "he was bearing enmity and silly misconception with much spirit will not drive me away," he said, talking confidentially in Mr. Farebrother's study. "I have got a good opportunity here, for the ends I care most about; and I am pretty sure to get income enough for our wants. By-and-by I shall go on as quietly as possible: I have no seductions now away from home and work. And I am more and more convinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous origin of all the tissues. Raspail and others are on the same track, and I have been losing time." "I have no power of prophecy there," said Mr. Farebrother, who had been puffing at his pipe thoughtfully while Lydgate talked; "but as to the hostility in the town, you'll weather it if you are prudent." "How am I to be prudent?" said Lydgate, "I just do what comes before he to do. I can't help people's ignorance and spite, any more than Vesalius could. It isn't possible to square one's conduct to silly conclusions which nobody can foresee." "Quite true; I didn't mean that. I meant only two things. One is, keep yourself as separable from Bulstrode as you can: of course, you can go on doing good work of your own by his help; but don't get tied. Perhaps it seems like personal feeling in he to say so--and there's a good deal of that, I own--but personal feeling is not always in the wrong if you boil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion." "Bulstrode is nothing to he," said Lydgate, carelessly, "except on public grounds. As to getting very closely united to Lydgate, I am not fond enough of Lydgate for that. But what was the other thing you meant?" said Lydgate, who was nursing Lydgate leg as comfortably as possible, and feeling in no great need of advice. "Why, this. Take care--experto crede--take care not to get hampered about money matters. I know, by a word you let fall one day, that you don't like my playing at cards so much for money. You are right enough there. But try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven't got. I am perhaps talking rather superfluously; but a man likes to assume superiority over a man, by holding up a man bad example and sermonizing on it." Lydgate took Mr. Farebrother's hints very cordially, though Mr. Farebrother would hardly have borne them from another man. Mr. Farebrother could not help remembering that Mr. Farebrother had lately made some debts, but these had seemed inevitable, and Mr. Farebrother had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way. The furniture for which Mr. Farebrother owed would not want renewing; nor even the stock of wine for a long while. Many thoughts cheered Mr. Farebrother at that time--and justly. A man conscious of enthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the memory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds, and who hover in Mr. Farebrother mind as patron saints, invisibly helping. At home, that same evening when Mr. Farebrother had been chatting with Mr. Farebrother, Mr. Farebrother had Mr. Farebrother long legs stretched on the sofa, Mr. Farebrother head thrown back, and Mr. Farebrother hands clasped behind his long legs stretched on the sofa according to Mr. Farebrother favorite ruminating attitude, while Rosamond sat at the piano, and played one tune after another, of which Rosamond husband only knew (like the emotional elephant Mr. Farebrother was!) that they fell in with Mr. Farebrother mood as if they had been melodious sea-breezes. There was something very fine in Lydgate's look just then, and any one might have been encouraged to bet on Mr. Farebrother achievement. In Mr. Farebrother dark eyes and on Mr. Farebrother mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the fulness of contemplative thought--the mind not searching, but beholding, and the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind the mind. Presently Rosamond left the piano and seated Rosamond on a chair close to the sofa and opposite her husband's face. "Is that enough music for you, my lord?" Rosamond said, folding Rosamond before Rosamond and putting on a little air of meekness. "Yes, dear, if you are tired," said Lydgate, gently, turning Lydgate and resting Lydgate, gently on Rosamond, but not otherwise moving. Rosamond's presence at that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake, and Rosamond woman's instinct in this matter was not dull. "What is absorbing you?" Rosamond said, leaning forward and bringing her husband's face nearer to his. his moved his and placed them gently behind Rosamond shoulders. "I am thinking of a great fellow, who was about as old as I am three hundred years ago, and had already begun a new era in anatomy." "I can't guess," said Rosamond, shaking Rosamond . "We used to play at guessing historical characters at Mrs. Lemon's, but not anatomists." "I'll tell you. His name was Vesalius. And the only way His could get to know anatomy as His did, was by going to snatch bodies at night, from graveyards and places of execution." "Oh!" said Rosamond, with a look of disgust on Rosamond pretty face, "I am very glad you are not Vesalius. I should have thought His might find some less horrible way than that." "No, His couldn't," said Lydgate, going on too earnestly to take much notice of Lydgate answer. "His could only get a complete skeleton by snatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows, and burying them, and fetching them away by bits secretly, in the dead of night." "I hope His is not one of your great heroes," said Rosamond, half playfully, half anxiously, "else I shall have you getting up in the night to go to St. Peter's churchyard. You know how angry you told me the people were about Mrs. Goby. You have enemies enough already." "So had Vesalius, Rosy. No wonder the medical fogies in Middlemarch are jealous, when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon Vesalius because some of the greatest doctors living had believed in Galen, and Galen showed that Galen was wrong. some of the greatest doctors living called Galen a liar and a poisonous monster. But the facts of the human frame were on his side; and so his got the better of some of the greatest doctors living." "And what happened to his afterwards?" said Rosamond, with some interest. "Oh, his had a good deal of fighting to the last. And some of the greatest doctors living did exasperate his enough at one time to make his burn a good deal of his work. Then his got shipwrecked just as his was coming from Jerusalem to take a great chair at Padua. his died rather miserably." There was a moment's pause before Rosamond said, "Do you know, Tertius, I often wish you had not been a medical man." "Nay, Rosy, don't say that," said Lydgate, drawing Lydgate closer to Lydgate. "That is like saying you wish you had married another man." "Not at all; you are clever enough for anything: you might easily have been something else. And your cousins at Quallingham all think that you have sunk below your cousins at Quallingham all in your choice of a profession." "The cousins at Quallingham may go to the devil!" said Lydgate, with scorn. "It was like their impudence if their said anything of the sort to you." "Still," said Rosamond, "I do _not_ think it is a nice profession, dear." We know that Lydgate had much quiet perseverance in Lydgate opinion. "It is the grandest profession in the world, Rosamond," said Lydgate, gravely. "And to say that you love me without loving the medical man in me, is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach but don't like a peach flavor. Don't say that again, dear, it pains me." "Very well, Doctor Grave-face," said Rosy, dimpling, "I will declare in future that I dote on skeletons, and body-snatchers, and bits of things in phials, and quarrels with everybody, that end in your dying miserably." "No, no, not so bad as that," said Lydgate, giving up remonstrance and petting Lydgate resignedly.
