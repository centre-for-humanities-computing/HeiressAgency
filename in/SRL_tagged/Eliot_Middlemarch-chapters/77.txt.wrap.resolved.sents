"And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot, To mark the full-fraught man and best indued With some suspicion."
--Henry V. The next day Lydgate had to go to Brassing, and told Rosamond that Lydgate should be away until the evening.
Of late Rosamond had never gone beyond Rosamond own house and garden, except to church, and once to see Rosamond papa, to whom Rosamond said, "If Tertius goes away, you will help us to move, will you not, papa?
I suppose us shall have very little money.
I am sure I hope some one will help us."
And Mr. Vincy had said, "Yes, child, I don't mind a hundred or two.
I can see the end of that."
With these exceptions Rosamond had sat at home in languid melancholy and suspense, fixing Rosamond mind on Will Ladislaw's coming as the one point of hope and interest, and associating this with some new urgency on Lydgate to make immediate arrangements for leaving Middlemarch and going to London, till Rosamond felt assured that the coming would be a potent cause of the going, without at all seeing how.
This way of establishing sequences is too common to be fairly regarded as a peculiar folly in Rosamond.
And it is precisely this sort of sequence which causes the greatest shock when it is sundered: for to see how an effect may be produced is often to see possible missings and checks; but to see nothing except the desirable cause, and close upon it the desirable effect, rids us of doubt and makes us minds strongly intuitive.
That was the process going on in poor Rosamond, while Rosamond arranged all objects around Rosamond with the same nicety as ever, only with more slowness--or sat down to the piano, meaning to play, and then desisting, yet lingering on the music stool with Rosamond white fingers suspended on the wooden front, and looking before Rosamond in dreamy ennui.
Rosamond melancholy had become so marked that Lydgate felt a strange timidity before Lydgate, as a perpetual silent reproach, and the strong man, mastered by Lydgate keen sensibilities towards this fair fragile creature whose life Lydgate seemed somehow to have bruised, shrank from Rosamond look, and sometimes started at Rosamond approach, fear of Rosamond and fear for Rosamond rushing in only the more forcibly after Lydgate had been momentarily expelled by exasperation.
But this morning Rosamond descended from Rosamond room upstairs--where Rosamond sometimes sat the whole day when Lydgate was out--equipped for a walk in the town.
Rosamond had a letter to post--a letter addressed to Mr. Ladislaw and written with charming discretion, but intended to hasten Mr. Ladislaw arrival by a hint of trouble.
The servant-maid, their sole house-servant now, noticed Rosamond coming down-stairs in Rosamond walking dress, and thought "there never did anybody look so pretty in a bonnet poor thing."
Meanwhile Dorothea's mind was filled with Dorothea project of going to Rosamond, and with the many thoughts, both of the past and the probable future, which gathered round the idea of that visit.
Until yesterday when Lydgate had opened to Dorothea a glimpse of some trouble in Lydgate married life, the image of Lydgate had always been associated for Dorothea with that of Will Ladislaw.
Even in Dorothea most uneasy moments--even when Dorothea had been agitated by Mrs. Cadwallader's painfully graphic report of gossip--Dorothea effort, nay, Dorothea strongest impulsive prompting, had been towards the vindication of Will from any sullying surmises; and when, in Dorothea meeting with Lydgate afterwards, Dorothea had at first interpreted Lydgate words as a probable allusion to a feeling towards Lydgate which Lydgate was determined to cut Lydgate off from indulging, Dorothea had had a quick, sad, excusing vision of the charm there might be in Lydgate constant opportunities of companionship with that fair creature, who most likely shared Lydgate other tastes as Dorothea evidently did Lydgate delight in music.
But there had followed Lydgate parting words--the few passionate words in which Lydgate had implied that Dorothea was the object of whom Lydgate love held Lydgate in dread, that it was Lydgate love for Dorothea only which Lydgate was resolved not to declare but to carry away into banishment.
From the time of that parting, Dorothea, believing in Will's love for Dorothea, believing with a proud delight in Lydgate delicate sense of honor and Lydgate determination that no one should impeach Lydgate justly, felt Dorothea heart quite at rest as to the regard Lydgate might have for Mrs. Lydgate.
Dorothea was sure that the regard he might have for Mrs. Lydgate was blameless.
There are natures in which, if they love us, us are conscious of having a sort of baptism and consecration: they bind us over to rectitude and purity by they pure belief about us; and us sins become that worst kind of sacrilege which tears down the invisible altar of trust.
"If you are not good, none is good"--those little words may give a terrific meaning to responsibility, may hold a vitriolic intensity for remorse.
Dorothea's nature was of that kind: Dorothea own passionate faults lay along the easily counted open channels of Dorothea ardent character; and while Dorothea was full of pity for the visible mistakes of others, Dorothea had not yet any material within Dorothea experience for subtle constructions and suspicions of hidden wrong.
But that simplicity of hers, holding up an ideal for others in Dorothea believing conception of them, was one of the great powers of Dorothea womanhood.
And it had from the first acted strongly on Will Ladislaw.
He felt, when He parted from Dorothea, that the brief words by which He had tried to convey to Dorothea He feeling about Dorothea and the division which Dorothea fortune made between her fortune, would only profit by her fortune brevity when Dorothea had to interpret her fortune: Dorothea felt that in Dorothea mind Dorothea had found Dorothea highest estimate.
And Dorothea was right there.
In the months since their parting Dorothea had felt a delicious though sad repose in their relation to each other, as one which was inwardly whole and without blemish.
Dorothea had an active force of antagonism within Dorothea, when the antagonism turned on the defence either of plans or persons that Dorothea believed in; and the wrongs which Dorothea felt that Will had received from Dorothea husband, and the external conditions which to others were grounds for slighting her husband, only gave the more tenacity to Dorothea affection and admiring judgment.
And now with the disclosures about Bulstrode had come another fact affecting Will's social position, which roused afresh Dorothea's inward resistance to what was said about Dorothea in that part of Dorothea world which lay within park palings.
"Young Ladislaw the grandson of a thieving Jew pawnbroker" was a phrase which had entered emphatically into the dialogues about the Bulstrode business, at Lowick, Tipton, and Freshitt, and was a worse kind of placard on poor Will's back than the "Italian with white mice."
Upright Sir James Chettam was convinced that Upright Sir James Chettam own satisfaction was righteous when Upright Sir James Chettam thought with some complacency that here was an added league to that mountainous distance between Ladislaw and Dorothea, which enabled Upright Sir James Chettam to dismiss any anxiety in that direction as too absurd.
And perhaps there had been some pleasure in pointing Mr. Brooke's attention to this ugly bit of Ladislaw's genealogy, as a fresh candle for Upright Sir James Chettam to see Upright Sir James Chettam own folly by.
Dorothea had observed the animus with which Will's part in the painful story had been recalled more than once; but Dorothea had uttered no word, being checked now, as Dorothea had not been formerly in speaking of Will, by the consciousness of a deeper relation between them which must always remain in consecrated secrecy.
But Dorothea silence shrouded Dorothea resistant emotion into a more thorough glow; and this misfortune in Will's lot which, it seemed, others were wishing to fling at his back as an opprobrium, only gave something more of enthusiasm to Dorothea clinging thought.
Dorothea entertained no visions of their ever coming into nearer union, and yet Dorothea had taken no posture of renunciation.
Dorothea had accepted Dorothea whole relation to Will very simply as part of Dorothea marriage sorrows, and would have thought it very sinful in Dorothea to keep up an inward wail because Dorothea was not completely happy, being rather disposed to dwell on the superfluities of Dorothea lot.
Dorothea could bear that the chief pleasures of Dorothea tenderness should lie in memory, and the idea of marriage came to Dorothea solely as a repulsive proposition from some suitor of whom Dorothea at present knew nothing, but whose merits, as seen by Dorothea friends, would be a source of torment to her:--"somebody who will manage your property for you, my dear," was Mr. Brooke's attractive suggestion of suitable characteristics.
"I should like to manage it Dorothea, if I knew what to do with it," said Dorothea.
No--Dorothea adhered to Dorothea declaration that Dorothea would never be married again, and in the long valley of Dorothea life which looked so flat and empty of waymarks, guidance would come as Dorothea walked along the road, and saw Dorothea fellow-passengers by the way.
This habitual state of feeling about Will Ladislaw had been strong in all Dorothea waking hours since Dorothea had proposed to pay a visit to Mrs. Lydgate, making a sort of background against which Dorothea saw Rosamond's figure presented to Dorothea without hindrances to Dorothea interest and compassion.
There was evidently some mental separation, some barrier to complete confidence which had arisen between this wife and the husband who had yet made Dorothea happiness a law to him.
That was a trouble which no third person must directly touch.
But Dorothea thought with deep pity of the loneliness which must have come upon Rosamond from the suspicions cast on her husband; and there would surely be help in the manifestation of respect for Lydgate and sympathy with Rosamond.
"I shall talk to Rosamond about her husband," thought Dorothea, as Rosamond was being driven towards the town.
The clear spring morning, the scent of the moist earth, the fresh leaves just showing their creased-up wealth of greenery from out their half-opened sheaths, seemed part of the cheerfulness Rosamond was feeling from a long conversation with Mr. Farebrother, who had joyfully accepted the justifying explanation of Lydgate's conduct.
"I shall take Mrs. Lydgate good news, and perhaps Mrs. Lydgate will like to talk to me and make a friend of me."
Dorothea had another errand in Lowick Gate: it was about a new fine-toned bell for the school-house, and as Dorothea had to get out of Dorothea carriage very near to Lydgate, Dorothea walked thither across the street, having told the coachman to wait for some packages.
The street door was open, and the servant was taking the opportunity of looking out at the carriage which was pausing within sight when The street door became apparent to Dorothea that the lady who "belonged to it" was coming towards Dorothea.
"Is Lydgate at home?"
said Dorothea.
"I'm not sure, the lady who "belonged to it; I'll see, if you'll please to walk in," said Martha, a little confused on the score of the lady who "belonged to it kitchen apron, but collected enough to be sure that "mum" was not the right title for this queenly young widow with a carriage and pair.
"Will you please to walk in, and I'll go and see."
"Say that I am Mrs. Casaubon," said Dorothea, as Martha moved forward intending to show the lady who "belonged to it into the drawing-room and then to go up-stairs to see if Rosamond had returned from Rosamond walk.
They crossed the broader part of the entrance-hall, and turned up the passage which led to the garden.
The drawing-room door was unlatched, and Martha, pushing The drawing-room door without looking into the drawing-room, waited for Mrs. Casaubon to enter and then turned away, The drawing-room door having swung open and swung back again without noise.
Dorothea had less of outward vision than usual this morning, being filled with images of things as they had been and were going to be.
Dorothea found Dorothea on the other side of The drawing-room door without seeing anything remarkable, but immediately Dorothea heard a voice speaking in low tones which startled Dorothea as with a sense of dreaming in daylight, and advancing unconsciously a step or two beyond the projecting slab of a bookcase, Dorothea saw, in the terrible illumination of a certainty which filled up all outlines, something which made Dorothea pause, motionless, without self-possession enough to speak.
Seated with his back towards Dorothea on a sofa which stood against the wall on a line with the door by which Dorothea had entered, Dorothea saw Will Ladislaw: close by his and turned towards his with a flushed tearfulness which gave a new brilliancy to Dorothea face sat Rosamond, Dorothea bonnet hanging back, while Will leaning towards Dorothea clasped both Dorothea upraised hands in his and spoke with low-toned fervor.
Rosamond in Rosamond agitated absorption had not noticed the silently advancing figure; but when Dorothea, after the first immeasurable instant of this vision, moved confusedly backward and found Rosamond impeded by some piece of furniture, Rosamond was suddenly aware of Rosamond presence, and with a spasmodic movement snatched away Rosamond hands and rose, looking at Dorothea who was necessarily arrested.
Will Ladislaw, starting up, looked round also, and meeting Dorothea's eyes with a new lightning in them, seemed changing to marble: But Rosamond immediately turned them away from Will Ladislaw to Rosamond and said in a firm voice-- "Excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate, the servant did not know that you were here.
I called to deliver an important letter for Mr. Lydgate, which I wished to put into her upraised hands."
Rosamond laid down the letter on the small table which had checked Rosamond retreat, and then including Rosamond and Will in one distant glance and bow, Rosamond went quickly out of the drawing-room, meeting in the passage which led to the garden the surprised Martha, who said Rosamond was sorry the mistress was not at home, and then showed the lady who "belonged to it out with an inward reflection that grand people were probably more impatient than others.
Dorothea walked across the street with Dorothea most elastic step and was quickly in her carriage again.
"Drive on to Freshitt Hall," Rosamond said to the coachman, and any one looking at Rosamond might have thought that though Rosamond was paler than usual Rosamond was never animated by a more self-possessed energy.
And that was really Rosamond experience.
It was as if Rosamond had drunk a great draught of scorn that stimulated Rosamond beyond the susceptibility to other feelings.
Rosamond had seen something so far below Rosamond belief, that Rosamond emotions rushed back from it and made an excited throng without an object.
Rosamond needed something active to turn Rosamond excitement out upon.
Rosamond felt power to walk and work for a day, without meat or drink.
And Rosamond would carry out the purpose with which Rosamond had started in the morning, of going to Freshitt and Tipton to tell Sir James and Rosamond uncle all that Rosamond wished them to know about Lydgate, whose married loneliness under Lydgate, whose married loneliness under his trial now presented itself to her with new significance, and made her more ardent in readiness to be his champion trial now presented itself to Rosamond with new significance, and made Rosamond more ardent in readiness to be Lydgate, whose married loneliness under his trial now presented itself to her with new significance, and made her more ardent in readiness to be his champion champion.
Rosamond had never felt anything like this triumphant power of indignation in the struggle of Rosamond married life, in which there had always been a quickly subduing pang; and Rosamond took it as a sign of new strength.
"Dodo, how very bright your eyes are!"
said Celia, when Sir James was gone out of the drawing-room.
"And you don't see anything you look at, Arthur or anything.
You are going to do something uncomfortable, I know.
Is it all about Lydgate, or has something else happened?"
Rosamond had been used to watch Rosamond sister with expectation.
"Yes, dear, a great many things have happened," said Dodo, in Rosamond full tones.
"I wonder what," said Rosamond, folding Rosamond arms cozily and leaning forward upon them.
"Oh, all the troubles of all people on the face of the earth," said Dorothea, lifting her arms to the back of Dorothea head.
"Dear me, Dodo, are you going to have a scheme for them?"
said Celia, a little uneasy at this Hamlet-like raving.
But Sir James came in again, ready to accompany Dorothea to the Grange, and Dorothea finished Dorothea expedition well, not swerving in Dorothea resolution until Dorothea descended at Dorothea own door.
