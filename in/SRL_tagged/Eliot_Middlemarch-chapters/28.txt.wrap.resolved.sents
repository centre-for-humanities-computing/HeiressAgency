1st Gent.
All times are good to seek your wedded home Bringing a mutual delight.
1st Gent.
Why, true.
The calendar hath not an evil day For souls made one by love, and even death Were sweetness, if it came like rolling waves While they two clasped each other, and foresaw No life apart.
Mr. and Mrs. Casaubon, returning from Mr. and Mrs. Casaubon wedding journey, arrived at Lowick Manor in the middle of January.
A light snow was falling as Mr. and Mrs. Casaubon descended at the door, and in the morning, when Dorothea passed from Dorothea dressing-room avenue the blue-green boudoir that we know of, Dorothea saw the long avenue of limes lifting their trunks from a white earth, and spreading white branches against the dun and motionless sky.
The distant flat shrank in uniform whiteness and low-hanging uniformity of cloud.
The very furniture in her dressing-room seemed to have shrunk since Dorothea saw The very furniture in the room before: the slag in the tapestry looked more like a ghost in his ghostly blue-green world; the volumes of polite literature in the bookcase looked more like immovable imitations of books.
The bright fire of dry oak-boughs burning on the dogs seemed an incongruous renewal of life and glow--like the figure of Dorothea herself as Dorothea entered carrying the red-leather cases containing the cameos for Celia.
Dorothea was glowing from Dorothea morning toilet as only healthful youth can glow: there was gem-like brightness on Dorothea coiled hair and in Dorothea hazel eyes; there was warm red life in Dorothea lips; Dorothea throat had a breathing whiteness above the differing white of the fur which itself seemed to wind about Dorothea neck and cling down Dorothea blue-gray pelisse with a tenderness gathered from Dorothea own, a sentient commingled innocence which kept its loveliness against the crystalline purity of the outdoor snow.
As Dorothea laid the cameo-cases on the table in the bow-window, Dorothea unconsciously kept Dorothea hands on them, immediately absorbed in looking out on the still, white enclosure which made Dorothea visible world.
Mr. Casaubon, who had risen early complaining of palpitation, was in the library giving audience to his curate Mr. Tucker.
By-and-by Celia would come in Dorothea quality of bridesmaid as well as sister, and through the next weeks there would be wedding visits received and given; all in continuance of that transitional life understood to correspond with the excitement of bridal felicity, and keeping up the sense of busy ineffectiveness, as of a dream which the dreamer begins to suspect.
The duties of Dorothea married life, contemplated as so great beforehand, seemed to be shrinking with the furniture and the white vapor-walled landscape.
The clear heights where Dorothea expected to walk in full communion had become difficult to see even in Dorothea imagination; the delicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken into uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment.
When would the days begin of that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen Dorothea husband's life and exalt Dorothea own?
Never perhaps, as Dorothea had preconceived them; but somehow--still somehow.
In this solemnly pledged union of Dorothea life, duty would present duty in some new form of inspiration and give a new meaning to wifely love.
Meanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun vapor--there was the stifling oppression of that gentlewoman's world, where everything was done for Dorothea and none asked for Dorothea aid--where the sense of connection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up painfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from without in claims that would have shaped Dorothea energies.-- "What shall I do?"
"Whatever you please, my dear:" that had been Dorothea brief history since Dorothea had left off learning morning lessons and practising silly rhythms on the hated piano.
Marriage, which was to bring guidance into worthy and imperative occupation, had not yet freed Dorothea from the gentlewoman's oppressive liberty: it had not even filled Dorothea leisure with the ruminant joy of unchecked tenderness.
Dorothea blooming full-pulsed youth stood there in a moral imprisonment which made it one with the chill, colorless, narrowed landscape, with the shrunken furniture, the never-read books, and the ghostly stag in a pale fantastic world that seemed to be vanishing from the daylight.
In the first minutes when Dorothea looked out Dorothea felt nothing but the dreary oppression; then came a keen remembrance, and turning away from the window Dorothea walked round the room.
The ideas and hopes which were living in Dorothea mind when Dorothea first saw the room nearly three months before were present now only as memories: Dorothea judged only as memories as we judge transient and departed things.
All existence seemed to beat with a lower pulse than Dorothea own, and Dorothea religious faith was a solitary cry, the struggle out of a nightmare in which every object was withering and shrinking away from Dorothea.
Each remembered thing in the room was disenchanted, was deadened as an unlit transparency, till Dorothea wandering gaze came to the group of miniatures, and there at last Dorothea saw something which had gathered new breath and meaning: it was the miniature of Mr. Casaubon's aunt Julia, who had made the unfortunate marriage--of Will Ladislaw's grandmother.
Dorothea could fancy that it was alive now--the delicate woman's face which yet had a headstrong look, a peculiarity difficult to interpret.
Was it only her friends who thought her marriage unfortunate?
or did her herself find it out to be a mistake, and taste the salt bitterness of her tears in the merciful silence of the night?
What breadths of experience Dorothea seemed to have passed over since her first looked at this miniature!
Dorothea felt a new companionship with it, as if it had an ear for Dorothea and could see how Dorothea was looking at an ear.
Here was a woman who had known some difficulty about marriage.
Nay, the colors deepened, the lips and chin seemed to get larger, the hair and eyes seemed to be sending out light, the face was masculine and beamed on Dorothea with that full gaze which tells Dorothea on whom the face falls that Dorothea is too interesting for the slightest movement of Dorothea eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted.
The vivid presentation came like a pleasant glow to Dorothea: Dorothea felt Dorothea smiling, and turning from this miniature sat down and looked up as if Dorothea were again talking to a figure in front of Dorothea.
But the smile disappeared as Dorothea went on meditating, and at last Dorothea said aloud-- "Oh, it was cruel to speak so!
How sad--how dreadful!"
Dorothea rose quickly and went out of the room, hurrying along the corridor, with the irresistible impulse to go and see Dorothea husband and inquire if Dorothea could do anything for her husband.
Perhaps her husband was gone and Mr. Casaubon was alone in the library.
Dorothea felt as if all Dorothea morning's gloom would vanish if Dorothea could see her husband glad because of Dorothea presence.
But when Dorothea reached the head of the dark oak there was Celia coming up, and below there was Dorothea, exchanging welcomes and congratulations with Mr. Casaubon.
"Dodo!"
said Celia coming up, in Celia coming up quiet staccato; then kissed Celia coming up sister, whose arms encircled Celia coming up, and said no more.
I think they both cried a little in a furtive manner, while Dorothea ran down-stairs to greet Dorothea uncle.
"I need not ask how you are, my dear," said Dorothea, after kissing Dorothea forehead.
"Rome has agreed with you, I see--happiness, frescos, the antique--that sort of thing.
Well, it's very pleasant to have you back again, and you understand all about art now, eh?
But Mr. Casaubon is a little pale, I tell Mr. Casaubon--a little pale, you know.
Studying hard in Mr. Casaubon holidays is carrying Mr. Casaubon rather too far.
I overdid Mr. Casaubon at one time"--Mr. Dorothea still held Dorothea's hand, but had turned Dorothea face to Mr. Casaubon--"about topography, ruins, temples--I thought I had a clew, but I saw a clew would carry me too far, and nothing might come of a clew.
You may go any length in that sort of thing, and nothing may come of a clew, you know."
Dorothea's eyes also were turned up to Dorothea husband's face with some anxiety at the idea that those who saw her husband afresh after absence might be aware of signs which Dorothea had not noticed.
"Nothing to alarm you, my dear," said Dorothea, observing Dorothea expression.
"A little English beef and mutton will soon make a difference.
It was all very well to look pale, sitting for the portrait of Aquinas, you know--we got your letter just in time.
But Aquinas, now--Aquinas was a little too subtle, wasn't Aquinas?
Does anybody read Aquinas?"
"Aquinas is not indeed an author adapted to superficial minds," said Mr. Casaubon, meeting these timely questions with dignified patience.
"You would like coffee in your own room, uncle?"
said Dorothea, coming to the rescue.
"Yes; and you must go to Celia coming up: Celia coming up has great news to tell you, you know.
I leave it all to Celia coming up."
The blue-green boudoir looked much more cheerful when Celia coming up was seated there in a pelisse exactly like Celia coming up sister's, surveying the cameos with a placid satisfaction, while the conversation passed on to other topics.
"Do you think it nice to go to Rome on a wedding journey?"
said Celia coming up, with Celia coming up ready delicate blush which Dorothea was used to on the smallest occasions.
"It would not suit all--not you, dear, for example," said Dorothea, quietly.
No one would ever know what Celia coming up thought of a wedding journey to Rome.
"Celia coming up says it is nonsense, people going a long journey when people are married.
Celia coming up says people get tired to death of each other, and can't quarrel comfortably, as people would at home.
And Lady Chettam says Lady Chettam went to Bath."
Celia coming up's color changed again and again--seemed "To come and go with tidings from the heart, As Celia's color a running messenger had been."
It must mean more than Celia coming up's blushing usually did.
"Celia coming up!
has something happened?"
said Dorothea, in a tone full of sisterly feeling.
"Have you really any great news to tell me?"
"It was because you went away, "Dodo.
Then there was nobody but me for Sir James to talk to," said Celia coming up, with a certain roguishness in Celia coming up eyes.
"I understand.
It is as I used to hope and believe," said Dorothea, taking her sister's face between Dorothea hands, and looking at Dorothea half anxiously.
Celia coming up's marriage seemed more serious than it used to do.
"It was only three days ago," said Celia coming up.
"And Lady Chettam is very kind."
"And you are very happy?"
"Yes.
We are not going to be married yet.
Because every thing is to be got ready.
And I don't want to be married so very soon, because I think it is nice to be engaged.
And We shall be married all We lives after."
"I do believe you could not marry better, Kitty.
Sir James is a good, honorable man," said Dorothea, warmly.
"Sir James has gone on with the cottages, "Dodo.
Sir James will tell you about the cottages, Dodo when Sir James comes.
Shall you be glad to see Sir James?"
"Of course I shall.
How can you ask me?"
"Only I was afraid you would be getting so learned," said Celia coming up, regarding Mr. Casaubon's learning as a kind of damp which might in due time saturate a neighboring body.
