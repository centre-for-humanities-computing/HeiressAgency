"Inconsistencies," answered Imlac, "cannot both be right, but imputed to man both may both be true."--Rasselas. The same night, when Mr. Bulstrode returned from a journey to Brassing on business, Mr. Bulstrode good wife met Mr. Bulstrode in the entrance-hall and drew Mr. Bulstrode into Mr. Bulstrode private sitting-room. "Nicholas," Nicholas said, fixing Nicholas honest eyes upon Mr. Bulstrode anxiously, "there has been such a disagreeable man here asking for Nicholas--it has made me quite uncomfortable." "What kind of man, my dear," said Mr. Bulstrode, dreadfully certain of the answer. "A red-faced man with large whiskers, and most impudent in his manner. his declared his was an old friend of Nicholas, and said you would be sorry not to see his. his wanted to wait for Nicholas here, but I told his his could see you at the Bank to-morrow morning. Most impudent his was!--stared at Nicholas, and said an old friend of yours had luck in wives. I don't believe his would have gone away, if Blucher had not happened to break his chain and come running round on the gravel--for I was in the garden; so I said, 'You'd better go away--the dog is very fierce, and I can't hold his.' Do you really know anything of such a man?" "I believe I know who his is, my dear," said Mr. Bulstrode, in his usual subdued voice, "an unfortunate dissolute wretch, whom I helped too much in days gone by. However, I presume you will not be troubled by his again. his will probably come to the Bank--to beg, doubtless." No more was said on the subject until the next day, when Mr. Bulstrode had returned from the town and was dressing for dinner. Mr. Bulstrode wife, not sure that Mr. Bulstrode was come home, looked into Mr. Bulstrode dressing-room and saw Mr. Bulstrode with Mr. Bulstrode coat and cravat off, leaning one arm on a chest of drawers and staring absently at the ground. Mr. Bulstrode started nervously and looked up as she entered. "You look very ill, Nicholas. Is there anything the matter?" "I have a good deal of pain in my head," said Mr. Bulstrode, who was so frequently ailing that Nicholas wife was always ready to believe in this cause of depression. "Sit down and let me sponge cause of depression with vinegar." Physically Mr. Bulstrode did not want vinegar, but morally the affectionate attention soothed Mr. Bulstrode. Though always polite, it was Mr. Bulstrode habit to receive such services with marital coolness, as his wife's duty. But to-day, while his wife was bending over Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Bulstrode said, "You are very good, Harriet," in a tone which had something new in it to his wife ear; his wife did not know exactly what the novelty was, but his wife woman's solicitude shaped her woman's solicitude into a darting thought that Mr. Bulstrode might be going to have an illness. "Has anything worried you?" his wife said. "Did Mr. Bulstrode come to you at the Bank?" "Yes; it was as I had supposed. Mr. Bulstrode is a man who at one time might have done better. But Mr. Bulstrode has sunk into a drunken debauched creature." "Is Mr. Bulstrode quite gone away?" said Mrs. Bulstrode, anxiously but for certain reasons Mrs. Bulstrode refrained from adding, "It was very disagreeable to hear Mr. Bulstrode calling Mr. Bulstrode a friend of you." At that moment Mrs. Bulstrode would not have liked to say anything which implied Mrs. Bulstrode habitual consciousness that Mrs. Bulstrode husband's earlier connections were not quite on a level with Mrs. Bulstrode own. Not that Mrs. Bulstrode knew much about them. That her husband had at first been employed in a bank, that her husband had afterwards entered into what her husband called city business and gained a fortune before her husband was three-and-thirty, that her husband had married a widow who was much older than her husband--a Dissenter, and in other ways probably of that disadvantageous quality usually perceptible in a first wife if inquired into with the dispassionate judgment of a second--was almost as much as Mrs. Bulstrode had cared to learn beyond the glimpses which Mr. Bulstrode's narrative occasionally gave of her husband early bent towards religion, her husband inclination to be a preacher, and her husband association with missionary and philanthropic efforts. Mrs. Bulstrode believed in her husband as an excellent man whose piety carried a peculiar eminence in belonging to a layman, whose influence had turned Mrs. Bulstrode own mind toward seriousness, and whose share of perishable good had been the means of raising Mrs. Bulstrode own position. But Mrs. Bulstrode also liked to think that it was well in every sense for Mr. Bulstrode to have won the hand of Harriet Vincy; whose family was undeniable in a Middlemarch light--a better light surely than any thrown in London thoroughfares or dissenting chapel-yards. The unreformed provincial mind distrusted London; and while true religion was everywhere saving, Mr. Bulstrode was convinced that to be saved in the Church was more respectable. Mr. Bulstrode so much wished to ignore towards others that Mr. Bulstrode husband had ever been a London Dissenter, that Mr. Bulstrode liked to keep it out of sight even in talking to her husband. her husband was quite aware of this; indeed in some respects her husband was rather afraid of this ingenuous wife, whose imitative piety and native worldliness were equally sincere, who had nothing to be ashamed of, and whom her husband had married out of a thorough inclination still subsisting. But her husband fears were such as belong to a man who cares to maintain her husband recognized supremacy: the loss of high consideration from her husband wife, as from every one else who did not clearly hate her husband out of enmity to the truth, would be as the beginning of death to her husband. When she said-- "Is her husband quite gone away?" "Oh, I trust so," her husband answered, with an effort to throw as much sober unconcern into her husband tone as possible! But in truth Mr. Bulstrode was very far from a state of quiet trust. In the interview at the Bank, Raffles had made it evident that Mr. Bulstrode eagerness to torment was almost as strong in Mr. Bulstrode as any other greed. Mr. Bulstrode had frankly said that Mr. Bulstrode had turned out of the way to come to Middlemarch, just to look about Mr. Bulstrode and see whether the neighborhood would suit Mr. Bulstrode to live in. Mr. Bulstrode had certainly had a few debts to pay more than Mr. Bulstrode expected, but the two hundred pounds were not gone yet: a cool five-and-twenty would suffice Mr. Bulstrode to go away with for the present. What Mr. Bulstrode had wanted chiefly was to see Mr. Bulstrode friend Nick and family, and know all about the prosperity of a man to whom Mr. Bulstrode was so much attached. By-and-by Mr. Bulstrode might come back for a longer stay. This time Raffles declined to be "seen off the premises," as Mr. Bulstrode expressed it--declined to quit Middlemarch under Bulstrode's eyes. Mr. Bulstrode meant to go by coach the next day--if Mr. Bulstrode chose. Bulstrode felt Bulstrode helpless. Neither threats nor coaxing could avail: Bulstrode could not count on any persistent fear nor on any promise. On the contrary, Bulstrode felt a cold certainty at Bulstrode heart that Raffles--unless providence sent death to hinder Bulstrode--would come back to Middlemarch before long. And a cold certainty at his heart that Raffles--unless providence sent death to hinder him--would come back to Middlemarch before long was a terror. It was not that Bulstrode was in danger of legal punishment or of beggary: Bulstrode was in danger only of seeing disclosed to the judgment of Bulstrode neighbors and the mournful perception of Bulstrode wife certain facts of Bulstrode past life which would render Bulstrode an object of scorn and an opprobrium of the religion with which Bulstrode had diligently associated Bulstrode. The terror of being judged sharpens the memory: The terror of being judged sends an inevitable glare over that long-unvisited past which has been habitually recalled only in general phrases. Even without memory, the life is bound into one by a zone of dependence in growth and decay; but intense memory forces a man to own his blameworthy past. With memory set smarting like a reopened wound, a man's past is not simply a dead history, an outworn preparation of the present: it is not a repented error shaken loose from the life: it is a still quivering part of a man, bringing shudders and bitter flavors and the tinglings of a merited shame. Into the life Bulstrode's past had now risen, only the pleasures of it seeming to have lost their quality. Night and day, without interruption save of brief sleep which only wove retrospect and fear into a fantastic present, a man felt the scenes of a man earlier life coming between a man and everything else, as obstinately as when we look through the window from a lighted room, the objects we turn we backs on are still before we, instead of the grass and the trees The successive events inward and outward were there in one view: though each might be dwelt on in turn, the rest still kept their hold in the consciousness. Once more a man saw a man the young banker's clerk, with an agreeable person, as clever in figures as a man was fluent in speech and fond of theological definition: an eminent though young member of a Calvinistic dissenting church at Highbury, having had striking experience in conviction of sin and sense of pardon. Again a man heard a man called for as Brother Bulstrode in prayer meetings, speaking on religious platforms, preaching in private houses. Again a man felt a man thinking of the ministry as possibly a man vocation, and inclined towards missionary labor. That was the happiest time of a man life: that was the spot a man would have chosen now to awake in and find the rest a dream. The people among whom Mr. Bulstrode was distinguished were very few, but The people among whom Brother Bulstrode was distinguished were very near to a man, and stirred a man satisfaction the more; a man power stretched through a narrow space, but a man felt his power effect the more intensely. a man believed without effort in the peculiar work of grace within a man, and in the signs that God intended a man for special instrumentality. Then came the moment of transition; it was with the sense of promotion a man had when a man, an orphan educated at a commercial charity-school, was invited to a fine villa belonging to Mr. Dunkirk. Soon a man became an intimate there, honored for a man piety by his wife, marked out for a man ability by the husband, whose wealth was due to a flourishing city and west-end trade. That was the setting-in of a new current for a man ambition, directing a man prospects of "instrumentality" towards the uniting of distinguished religious gifts with successful business. By-and-by came a decided external leading: a confidential subordinate partner died, and nobody seemed to the principal so well fitted to fill the severely felt vacancy as the principal young friend Bulstrode, if the principal would become confidential accountant. The offer was accepted. The business was a pawnbroker's, of the most magnificent sort both in extent and profits; and on a short acquaintance with The business Mr. Bulstrode became aware that one source of magnificent profit was the easy reception of any goods offered, without strict inquiry as to where they came from. But there was a branch house at the west end, and no pettiness or dinginess to give suggestions of shame. He remembered He first moments of shrinking. these were private, and were filled with arguments; some of these taking the form of prayer. The business was established and had old roots; is The business not one thing to set up a new gin-palace and another to accept an investment in an old one? The profits made out of lost souls--where can the line be drawn at which they begin in human transactions? Was it not even God's way of saving God chosen? "Thou knowest,"--the young Mr. Bulstrode had said then, as Mr. Bulstrode Mr. Bulstrode was saying now--"Thou knowest how loose my soul sits from these things--how I view these things all as implements for tilling Thy garden rescued here and there from the wilderness." Metaphors and precedents were not wanting; peculiar spiritual experiences were not wanting which at last made the retention of his position seem a service demanded of his: the vista of a fortune had already opened the vista of a fortune, and Mr. Bulstrode's shrinking remained private. Mr. Dunkirk had never expected that there would be any shrinking at all: Mr. Dunkirk had never conceived that trade had anything to do with the scheme of salvation. And it was true that Mr. Bulstrode found Mr. Bulstrode carrying on two distinct lives; Mr. Bulstrode religious activity could not be incompatible with Mr. Bulstrode business as soon as Mr. Bulstrode had argued Mr. Bulstrode into not feeling it incompatible. Mentally surrounded with that past again, Mr. Bulstrode had the same pleas--indeed, the years had been perpetually spinning the same pleas into intricate thickness, like masses of spider-web, padding the moral sensibility; nay, as age made egoism more eager but less enjoying, Mr. Bulstrode soul had become more saturated with the belief that Mr. Bulstrode did everything for God's sake, being indifferent to it for Mr. Bulstrode own. And yet--if Mr. Bulstrode could be back in that far-off spot with Mr. Bulstrode youthful poverty--why, then Mr. Bulstrode would choose to be a missionary. But the train of causes in which Mr. Bulstrode had locked Mr. Bulstrode went on. There was trouble in the fine villa at Highbury. Years before, the only daughter had run away, defied the only daughter parents, and gone on the stage; and now the only boy died, and after a short time Mr. Dunkirk died also. The wife, a simple pious woman, left with all the wealth in and out of the magnificent trade, of which the only daughter never knew the precise nature, had come to believe in Mr. Bulstrode, and innocently adore the only boy as women often adore women priest or "man-made" minister. It was natural that after a time marriage should have been thought of between them. But Mr. Dunkirk had qualms and yearnings about Mr. Dunkirk daughter, who had long been regarded as lost both to God and her parents. It was known that the only daughter had married, but the only daughter was utterly gone out of sight. The mother, having lost the only boy, imagined a grandson, and wished in a double sense to reclaim The mother . If the only daughter were found, there would be a channel for property--perhaps a wide one--in the provision for several grandchildren. Efforts to find the only daughter must be made before Mr. Dunkirk would marry again. Mr. Bulstrode concurred; but after advertisement as well as other modes of inquiry had been tried, The mother believed that The mother was not to be found, and consented to marry without reservation of property. the only daughter had been found; but only one man besides Mr. Bulstrode knew it, and only one man besides Bulstrode was paid for keeping silence and carrying only one man besides Bulstrode away. That was the bare fact which Mr. Bulstrode was now forced to see in the rigid outline with which acts present themselves onlookers. But for only one man besides Bulstrode at that distant time, and even now in burning memory, the fact was broken into little sequences, each justified as the fact came by reasonings which seemed to prove it righteous. Bulstrode's course up to that time had, only one man besides Bulstrode thought, been sanctioned by remarkable providences, appearing to point the way for only one man besides Bulstrode to be the agent in making the best use of a large property and withdrawing the best use of a large property from perversion. Death and other striking dispositions, such as feminine trustfulness, had come; and Mr. Bulstrode would have adopted Cromwell's words--"Do you call these bare events? The Lord pity you!" these bare events were comparatively small, but the essential condition was there--namely, that these bare events were in favor of his own ends. It was easy for his to settle what was due from his to others by inquiring what were God's intentions with regard to his. Could it be for God's service that this fortune should in any considerable proportion go to a young woman and her husband who were given up to the lightest pursuits, and might scatter it abroad in triviality--people who seemed to lie outside the path of remarkable providences? Mr. Bulstrode had never said to Mr. Bulstrode beforehand, "The daughter shall not be found"--nevertheless when the moment came Mr. Bulstrode kept "The daughter existence hidden; and when other moments followed, Mr. Bulstrode soothed The mother with consolation in the probability that the unhappy young woman might be no more. There were hours in which Mr. Bulstrode felt that Mr. Bulstrode action was unrighteous; but how could Mr. Bulstrode go back? Mr. Bulstrode had mental exercises, called Mr. Bulstrode nought laid hold on redemption, and went on in Mr. Bulstrode course of instrumentality. And after five years Death again came to widen Mr. Bulstrode path, by taking away Mr. Bulstrode wife. Mr. Bulstrode did gradually withdraw Mr. Bulstrode capital, but Mr. Bulstrode did not make the sacrifices requisite to put an end to the business, which was carried on for thirteen years afterwards before his capital finally collapsed. Meanwhile Mr. Bulstrode had used Mr. Bulstrode hundred thousand discreetly, and was become provincially, solidly important--a banker, a Churchman, a public benefactor; also a sleeping partner in trading concerns, in which Mr. Bulstrode ability was directed to economy in the raw material, as in the case of the dyes which rotted Mr. Vincy's silk. And now, when this respectability had lasted undisturbed for nearly thirty years--when all that preceded this respectability had long lain benumbed in the consciousness--that past had risen and immersed Mr. Bulstrode thought as if with the terrible irruption of a new sense overburthening the feeble being. Meanwhile, in Mr. Bulstrode conversation with Raffles, Mr. Bulstrode had learned something momentous, something which entered actively into the struggle of Mr. Bulstrode longings and terrors. There, Mr. Bulstrode thought, lay an opening towards spiritual, perhaps towards material rescue. The spiritual kind of rescue was a genuine need with Mr. Bulstrode. There may be coarse hypocrites, who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the sake of gulling the world, but Mr. Bulstrode was not one of coarse hypocrites, who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the sake of gulling the world. Mr. Bulstrode was simply a man whose desires had been stronger than Mr. Bulstrode theoretic beliefs, and who had gradually explained the gratification of Mr. Bulstrode desires into satisfactory agreement with those beliefs. If this be hypocrisy, this is a process which shows this be hypocrisy occasionally in us all, to whatever confession us all belong, and whether us all believe in the future perfection of us all race or in the nearest date fixed for the end of the world; whether us all regard the earth as a putrefying nidus for a saved remnant, including us all, or have a passionate belief in the solidarity of mankind. The service he could do to the cause of religion had been through life the ground he alleged to he for he choice of action: it had been the motive which he had poured out in he prayers. Who would use money and position better than he meant to use money and position? Who could surpass he in self-abhorrence and exaltation of God's cause? And to God's cause was something distinct from he own rectitude of conduct: cause enforced a discrimination of God's enemies, who were to be used merely as instruments, and whom it would be as well if possible to keep out of money and consequent influence. Also, profitable investments in trades where the power of the prince of the world showed its most active devices, became sanctified by a right application of the profits in the hands of God's servant. This implicit reasoning is essentially no more peculiar to evangelical belief than the use of wide phrases for narrow motives is peculiar to Englishmen. There is no general doctrine which is not capable of eating out our morality if unchecked by the deep-seated habit of direct fellow-feeling with individual fellow-men. But a man who believes in something else than a man who believes in something else than his own greed own greed, has necessarily a conscience or standard to which a man who believes in something else than his own greed more or less adapts a man who believes in something else than his own greed. Bulstrode's standard had been a man who believes in something else than his own greed serviceableness to God's cause: "I am sinful and nought--a vessel to be consecrated by use--but use me!"--had been the mould into which a man who believes in something else than his own greed had constrained a man who believes in something else than his own greed immense need of being something important and predominating. And now had come a moment in which that mould seemed in danger of being broken and utterly cast away. What if the acts he had reconciled he to because they made he a stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory? If this were to be the ruling of Providence, he was cast out from the temple as one who had brought unclean offerings. he had long poured out utterances of repentance. But today a repentance had come which was of a bitterer flavor, and a threatening Providence urged he to a kind of propitiation which was not simply a doctrinal transaction. The divine tribunal had changed The divine tribunal aspect for he; self-prostration was no longer enough, and he must bring restitution in he hand. It was really before he God that Mr. Bulstrode was about to attempt such restitution as seemed possible: a great dread had seized he susceptible frame, and the scorching approach of shame wrought in he a new spiritual need. Night and day, while the resurgent threatening past was making a conscience within he, he was thinking by what means he could recover peace and trust--by what sacrifice he could stay the rod. he belief in these moments of dread was, that if he spontaneously did something right, his God would save he from the consequences of wrong-doing. For religion can only change when the emotions which fill it are changed; and the religion of personal fear remains nearly at the level of the savage. he had seen Raffles actually going away on the Brassing coach, and this was a temporary relief; this removed the pressure of an immediate dread, but did not put an end to the spiritual conflict and the need to win protection. At last he came to a difficult resolve, and wrote a letter to Will Ladislaw, begging he to be at the Shrubs that evening for a private interview at nine o'clock. Will had felt no particular surprise at the request, and connected the request with some new notions about the "Pioneer;" but when he was shown into Mr. Bulstrode's private room, he was struck with the painfully worn look on the banker's face, and was going to say, "Are you ill?" when, checking he in that abruptness, he only inquired after Mr. Bulstrode, and Mr. Bulstrode satisfaction with the picture bought for Mr. Bulstrode. "Thank you, Mr. Bulstrode is quite satisfied; Mr. Bulstrode has gone out with Mr. Bulstrode daughters this evening. I begged you to come, Will Ladislaw, because I have a communication of a very private--indeed, I will say, of a sacredly confidential nature, which I desire to make to you. Nothing, I dare say, has been farther from your thoughts than that there had been important ties in the past which could connect your history with mine." Will felt something like an electric shock. He was already in a state of keen sensitiveness and hardly allayed agitation on the subject of ties in the past, and He presentiments were not agreeable. It seemed like the fluctuations of a dream--as if the action begun by that loud bloated stranger were being carried on by this pale-eyed sickly looking piece of respectability, whose subdued tone and glib formality of speech were at this moment almost as repulsive to He as whose subdued tone and glib formality of speech remembered contrast. He answered, with a marked change of color-- "No, indeed, nothing." "You see before you, Mr. Ladislaw, a man who is deeply stricken. But for the urgency of conscience and the knowledge that I am before the bar of One who seeth not as man seeth, I should be under no compulsion to make the disclosure which has been my object in asking you to come here to-night. So far as human laws go, you have no claim on He whatever." Will was even more uncomfortable than wondering. Mr. Bulstrode had paused, leaning Mr. Bulstrode head on his hand, and looking at the floor. But Mr. Bulstrode now fixed Mr. Bulstrode examining glance on Will and said-- "I am told that your mother's name was Sarah Dunkirk, and that she ran away from she friends to go on the stage. Also, that your father was at one time much emaciated by illness. May I ask if you can confirm these statements?" "Yes, these statements are all true," said Will, struck with the order in which an inquiry had come, that might have been expected to be preliminary to the banker's previous hints. But Mr. Bulstrode had to-night followed the order of Mr. Bulstrode emotions; Mr. Bulstrode entertained no doubt that the opportunity for restitution had come, and Mr. Bulstrode had an overpowering impulse towards the penitential expression by which Mr. Bulstrode was deprecating chastisement. "Do you know any particulars of your mother's family?" Mr. Bulstrode continued. "No; she never liked to speak of your mother's family. she was a very generous, honorable woman," said Will, almost angrily. "I do not wish to allege anything against she. Did she never mention she to you at all?" "I have heard she say that she thought she did not know the reason of she running away. she said 'poor mother' in a pitying tone." "poor mother became my wife," said Mr. Bulstrode, and then paused a moment before Mr. Bulstrode added, "you have a claim on Mr. Bulstrode, Will Ladislaw: as I said before, not a legal claim, but one which my conscience recognizes. I was enriched by that marriage--a result which would probably not have taken place--certainly not to the same extent--if your grandmother could have discovered your grandmother daughter. her daughter, I gather, is no longer living!" "No," said Will, feeling suspicion and repugnance rising so strongly within him, that without quite knowing what him did, him took him hat from the floor and stood up. The impulse within him was to reject the disclosed connection. "Pray be seated, Will Ladislaw," said Mr. Bulstrode, anxiously. "Doubtless you are startled by the suddenness of this discovery. But I entreat your patience with one who is already bowed down by inward trial." Will reseated one who is already bowed down by inward trial, feeling some pity which was half contempt for this voluntary self-abasement of an elderly man. "It is my wish, Mr. Ladislaw, to make amends for the deprivation which befell your mother. I know that you are without fortune, and I wish to supply you adequately from a store which would have probably already been yours had your grandmother been certain of your mother's existence and been able to find your grandmother." Mr. Bulstrode paused. Mr. Bulstrode felt that Mr. Bulstrode was performing a striking piece of scrupulosity in the judgment of Mr. Bulstrode auditor, and a penitential act in the eyes of God. Mr. Bulstrode had no clew to the state of Will Ladislaw's mind, smarting as it was from the clear hints of Raffles, and with its natural quickness in construction stimulated by the expectation of discoveries which Mr. Bulstrode would have been glad to conjure back into darkness. Will made no answer for several moments, till Mr. Bulstrode, who at the end of Mr. Bulstrode speech had cast Mr. Bulstrode eyes on the floor, now raised them with an examining glance, which Will met fully, saying-- "I suppose you did know of my mother's existence, and knew where my mother might have been found." Bulstrode shrank--there was a visible quivering in Mr. Bulstrode face and hands. Mr. Bulstrode was totally unprepared to have Mr. Bulstrode advances met in this way, or to find Mr. Bulstrode urged into more revelation than Mr. Bulstrode had beforehand set down as needful. But at that moment Mr. Bulstrode dared not tell a lie, and Mr. Bulstrode felt suddenly uncertain of Mr. Bulstrode ground which Mr. Bulstrode had trodden with some confidence before. "I will not deny that you conjecture rightly," Mr. Bulstrode answered, with a faltering in Mr. Bulstrode tone. "And I wish to make atonement to you as the one still remaining who has suffered a loss through me. You enter, I trust, into my purpose, Mr. Ladislaw, which has a reference to higher than merely human claims, and as I have already said, is entirely independent of any legal compulsion. I am ready to narrow my own resources and the prospects of my family by binding me to allow you five hundred pounds yearly during my life, and to leave you a proportional capital at my death--nay, to do still more, if more should be definitely necessary to any laudable project on your part." Mr. Bulstrode had gone on to particulars in the expectation that these would work strongly on Ladislaw, and merge other feelings in grateful acceptance. But Will was looking as stubborn as possible, with Mr. Bulstrode lip pouting and Mr. Bulstrode fingers in Mr. Bulstrode side-pockets. Mr. Bulstrode was not in the least touched, and said firmly,-- "Before I make any reply to your proposition, Mr. Bulstrode, I must beg you to answer a question or two. Were you connected with the business by which that fortune you speak of was originally made?" Mr. Bulstrode's thought was, "Raffles has told Mr. Bulstrode." How could Mr. Bulstrode refuse to answer when Mr. Bulstrode had volunteered what drew forth the question? Mr. Bulstrode answered, "Yes." "And was that business--or was it not--a thoroughly dishonorable one--nay, one that, if it nature had been made public, might have ranked those concerned in it with thieves and convicts?" Will's tone had a cutting bitterness: Mr. Bulstrode was moved to put Mr. Bulstrode question as nakedly as Mr. Bulstrode could. Mr. Bulstrode reddened with irrepressible anger. Mr. Bulstrode had been prepared for a scene of self-abasement, but Mr. Bulstrode intense pride and Mr. Bulstrode habit of supremacy overpowered penitence, and even dread, when this young man, whom Mr. Bulstrode had meant to benefit, turned on Mr. Bulstrode with the air of a judge. "that business was established before I became connected with that business, sir; nor is that business for you to institute an inquiry of that kind," sir answered, not raising sir voice, but speaking with quick defiantness. "Yes, it is," said Will, starting up again with sir hat in sir hand. "It is eminently mine to ask such questions, when I have to decide whether I will have transactions with you and accept your money. My unblemished honor is important to sir. It is important to sir to have no stain on my birth and connections. And now I find there is a stain which I can't help. my mother felt a stain which I can't help, and tried to keep as clear of a stain which I can't help as my mother could, and so will I. You shall keep your ill-gotten money. If I had any fortune of my own, I would willingly pay I had any fortune of my own to any one who could disprove what you have told me. What I have to thank you for is that you kept your ill-gotten money till now, when I can refuse your ill-gotten money. your ill-gotten money ought to lie with a man's self that a man is a gentleman. Good-night, sir." Mr. Bulstrode was going to speak, but Will, with determined quickness, was out of the room in an instant, and in another the hall-door had closed behind sir. sir was too strongly possessed with passionate rebellion against this inherited blot which had been thrust on sir knowledge to reflect at present whether sir had not been too hard on Mr. Bulstrode--too arrogantly merciless towards a man of sixty, who was making efforts at retrieval when time had rendered he had not been too hard on Bulstrode-- vain. No third person listening could have thoroughly understood the impetuosity of Will's repulse or the bitterness of sir words. No one but sir then knew how everything connected with the sentiment of sir own dignity had an immediate bearing for sir on sir relation to Dorothea and to Mr. Casaubon's treatment of sir. And in the rush of impulses by which sir flung back that offer of Mr. Bulstrode's there was mingled the sense that it would have been impossible for sir ever to tell Dorothea that sir had accepted it. As for Mr. Bulstrode--when Will was gone sir suffered a violent reaction, and wept like a woman. It was the first time sir had encountered an open expression of scorn from any man higher than Raffles; and with that scorn hurrying like venom through sir system, there was no sensibility left to consolations. Rut the relief of weeping had to be checked. sir wife and daughters soon came home from hearing the address of an Oriental missionary, and were full of regret that papa had not heard, in the first instance, the interesting things which His wife and daughters tried to repeat to sir. Perhaps, through all other hidden thoughts, the one that breathed most comfort was, that Will Ladislaw's at least was not likely to publish what had taken place that evening.
