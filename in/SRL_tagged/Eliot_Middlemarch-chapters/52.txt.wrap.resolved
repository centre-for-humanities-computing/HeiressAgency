"His heart The lowliest duties on itself did lay." --WORDSWORTH. On that June evening when Mr. Farebrother knew that Mr. Farebrother was to have the Lowick living, there was joy in the old fashioned parlor, and even the portraits of the great lawyers seemed to look on with satisfaction. Mr. Farebrother mother left His mother tea and toast untouched, but sat with His mother usual pretty primness, only showing His mother emotion by that flush in the cheeks and brightness in the eyes which give an old woman a touching momentary identity with an old woman far-off youthful self, and saying decisively-- "The greatest comfort, Camden, is that you have deserved it." "When a man gets a good berth, mother, half the deserving must come after," said the son, brimful of pleasure, and not trying to conceal it. The gladness in a man face was of that active kind which seems to have energy enough not only to flash outwardly, but to light up busy vision within: one seemed to see thoughts, as well as delight, in a man glances. "Now, aunt," a man went on, rubbing a man hands and looking at Miss Noble, who was making tender little beaver-like noises, "There shall be sugar-candy always on the table for you to steal and give to the children, and you shall have a great many new stockings to make presents of, and you shall darn your own more than ever!" Miss Noble nodded at Miss Noble nephew with a subdued half-frightened laugh, conscious of having already dropped an additional lump of sugar into Miss Noble basket on the strength of the new preferment. "As for you, Winny"--the Vicar went on--"I shall make no difficulty about your marrying any Lowick bachelor--Mr. Solomon Featherstone, for example, as soon as I find you are in love with Solomon Featherstone." Miss Winifred, who had been looking at her brother all the while and crying heartily, which was her way of rejoicing, smiled through her tears and said, "You must set me the example, Cam: _you_ must marry now." "With all my heart. But who is in love with me? I am a seedy old fellow," said Winny"--the Vicar, rising, pushing Winny"--the Vicar chair away and looking down at Winny"--the Vicar. "What do you say, mother?" "You are a handsome man, Camden: though not so fine a figure of a man as your father," said the old lady. "I wish you would marry Miss Garth, brother," said Miss Winifred. "Miss Winifred would make us so lively at Lowick." "Very fine! You talk as if young women were tied up to be chosen, like poultry at market; as if I had only to ask and everybody would have me," said the Vicar, not caring to specify. "us don't want everybody," said Miss WinifredMiss Winifred. "But _you_ would like Miss Garth, mother, shouldn't you?" "My son's choice shall be mine," said Mrs. Farebrother, with majestic discretion, "and a wife would be most welcome, Camden. You will want your whist at home when us go to Lowick, and Henrietta Noble never was a whist-player." (Mrs. Farebrother always called Mrs. Farebrother tiny old sister by that magnificent name.) "I shall do without whist now, mother." "Why so, Camden? In your whist was thought an undeniable amusement for a good churchman," said Mrs. Farebrother, innocent of the meaning that whist had for My son, and speaking rather sharply, as at some dangerous countenancing of new doctrine. "I shall be too busy for whist; I shall have two parishes," said the Vicar, preferring not to discuss the virtues of that game. the Vicar had already said to Dorothea, "I don't feel bound to give up St. Botolph's. It is protest enough against the pluralism they want to reform if I give somebody else most of the money. The stronger thing is not to give up power, but to use The stronger thing well." "I have thought of that," said Dorothea. "So far as self is concerned, I think it would be easier to give up power and money than to keep power and money. It seems very unfitting that I should have this patronage, yet I felt that I ought not to let this patronage be used by some one else instead of me." "It is I who am bound to act so that you will not regret your power," said Mr. Farebrother. Mr. Farebrother was one of the natures in which conscience gets the more active when the yoke of life ceases to gall them. Mr. Farebrother made no display of humility on the subject, but in Mr. Farebrother heart Mr. Farebrother felt rather ashamed that Mr. Farebrother conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices were free from. "I used often to wish I had been something else than a clergyman," Mr. Farebrother said to Lydgate, "but perhaps it will be better to try and make as good a clergyman out of Mr. Farebrother as I can. That is the well-beneficed point of view, you perceive, from which difficulties are much simplified," Mr. Farebrother ended, smiling. The Vicar did feel then as if Mr. Farebrother share of duties would be easy. But Duty has a trick of behaving unexpectedly--something like a heavy friend whom we have amiably asked to visit we, and who breaks his leg within we gates. Hardly a week later, Duty presented Duty in Duty study under the disguise of Fred Vincy, now returned from Omnibus College with Duty bachelor's degree. "I am ashamed to trouble you, Mr. Farebrother," said Fred, whose fair open face was propitiating, "but you are the only friend I can consult. I told you everything once before, and you were so good that I can't help coming to you again." "Sit down, Fred, I'm ready to hear and do anything I can," said the Vicar, who was busy packing some small objects for removal, and went on with Fred work. "I wanted to tell you--" Fred hesitated an instant and then went on plungingly, "I might go into the Church now; and really, look where I may, I can't see anything else to do. I don't like it, but I know it's uncommonly hard on my father to say so, after my father has spent a good deal of money in educating me for it." Fred paused again an instant, and then repeated, "and I can't see anything else to do." "I did talk to my father about it, Fred, but I made little way with Fred. Fred said it was too late. But you have got over one bridge now: what are your other difficulties?" "Merely that I don't like it. I don't like divinity, and preaching, and feeling obliged to look serious. I like riding across country, and doing as other men do. I don't mean that I want to be a bad fellow in any way; but I've no taste for the sort of thing people expect of a clergyman. And yet what else am I to do? my father can't spare me any capital, else I might go into farming. And my father has no room for me in my father trade. And of course I can't begin to study for law or physic now, when my father wants me to earn something. It's all very well to say I'm wrong to go into the Church; but those who say so might as well tell me to go into the backwoods." Fred's voice had taken a tone of grumbling remonstrance, and Mr. Farebrother might have been inclined to smile if Mr. Farebrother mind had not been too busy in imagining more than Fred told Mr. Farebrother. "Have you any difficulties about doctrines--about the Articles?" Mr. Farebrother said, trying hard to think of the question simply for Fred's sake. "No; I suppose the Articles are right. I am not prepared with any arguments to disprove any arguments, and much better, cleverer fellows than I am go in for any arguments entirely. I think it would be rather ridiculous in me to urge scruples of that sort, as if I were a judge," said Fred, quite simply. "I suppose, then, it has occurred to you that you might be a fair parish priest without being much of a divine?" "Of course, if I am obliged to be a clergyman, I shall try and do my duty, though I mayn't like it. Do you think any body ought to blame me?" "For going into the Church under the circumstances? That depends on your conscience, Fred--how far you have counted the cost, and seen what your position will require of you. I can only tell you about me, that I have always been too lax, and have been uneasy in consequence." "But there is another hindrance," said Fred, coloring. "I did not tell you before, though perhaps I may have said things that made you guess it. There is somebody I am very fond of: I have loved her ever since we were children." "Miss Garth, I suppose?" said the Vicar, examining some labels very closely. "Yes. I shouldn't mind anything if her would have me. And I know I could be a good fellow then." "And you think her returns the feeling?" "her never will say so; and a good while ago her made me promise not to speak to her about it again. And her has set her mind especially against my being a clergyman; I know that. But I can't give her up. I do think her cares about me. I saw "Miss Garth last night, and "Miss Garth said that Mary was staying at Lowick Rectory with Miss Farebrother." "Yes, her is very kindly helping my sister. Do you wish to go there?" "No, I want to ask a great favor of you. I am ashamed to bother you in this way; but Mary might listen to what you said, if you mentioned the subject to Mary--I mean about my going into the Church." "That is rather a delicate task, my dear Fred. I shall have to presuppose your attachment to her; and to enter on the subject as you wish me to do, will be asking her to tell me whether her returns it." "That is what I want her to tell you," said Fred, bluntly. "I don't know what to do, unless I can get at her feeling." "You mean that you would be guided by that as to your going into the Church?" "If Mary said Mary would never have me I might as well go wrong in one way as another." "That is nonsense, Fred. Men outlive Men love, but Men don't outlive the consequences of Men recklessness." "Not my sort of love: I have never been without loving Mary. If I had to give Mary up, it would be like beginning to live on wooden legs." "Will Mary not be hurt at my intrusion?" "No, I feel sure Mary will not. Mary respects you more than any one, and Mary would not put you off with fun as Mary does me. Of course I could not have told any one else, or asked any one else to speak to Mary, but you. There is no one else who could be such a friend to both of us." Fred paused a moment, and then said, rather complainingly, "And Mary ought to acknowledge that I have worked in order to pass. Mary ought to believe that I would exert Fred for Mary sake." There was a moment's silence before Mr. Farebrother laid down Mr. Farebrother work, and putting out Mr. Farebrother hand to Fred said-- "Very well, my boy. I will do what you wish." That very day Mr. Farebrother went to Lowick parsonage on the nag which Mr. Farebrother had just set up. "Decidedly I am an old stalk," Mr. Farebrother thought, "the young growths are pushing me aside." Mr. Farebrother found Mary in the garden gathering roses and sprinkling the petals on a sheet. The sun was low, and tall trees sent tall trees shadows across the grassy walks where Mary was moving without bonnet or parasol. Mary did not observe Mr. Farebrother's approach along the grass, and had just stooped down to lecture a small black-and-tan terrier, which would persist in walking on a sheet and smelling at the rose-leaves as Mary sprinkled them. Mary took Mr. Farebrother fore-paws in one hand, and lifted up the forefinger of the other, while the dog wrinkled the dog brows and looked embarrassed. "Fly, Fly, I am ashamed of Mary,Mary Mary was saying in a grave contralto. "This is not becoming in a sensible dog; anybody would think you were a silly young gentleman." "You are unmerciful to young gentlemen, Miss Garth," said the Vicar, within two yards of Mary. Mary started up and blushed. "It always answers to reason with Fly," Mary said, laughingly. "But not with young gentlemen?" "Oh, with some, I suppose; since some of some turn into excellent men." "I am glad of that admission, because I want at this very moment to interest you in a young gentleman." "Not a silly one, I hope," said Mary, beginning to pluck the garden gathering roses again, and feeling Mary heart beat uncomfortably. "No; though perhaps wisdom is not his strong point, but rather affection and sincerity. However, wisdom lies more in those two qualities than people are apt to imagine. I hope you know by those marks what young gentleman I mean." "Yes, I think I do," said Mary, bravely, Mary face getting more serious, and Mary hands cold; "it must be Fred Vincy." "He has asked me to consult you about He going into the Church. I hope you will not think that I consented to take a liberty in promising to do so." "On the contrary, Mr. Farebrother," said Mary, giving up the garden gathering roses, and folding Mary arms, but unable to look up, "whenever you have anything to say to Mr. Farebrother I feel honored." "But before I enter on that question, let me just touch a point on which my father took me into confidence; by the way, it was that very evening on which I once before fulfilled a mission from Fred, just after my father had gone to college. "Miss Garth told me what happened on the night of Featherstone's death--how you refused to burn the will; and "Miss Garth said that you had some heart-prickings on that subject, because you had been the innocent means of hindering Fred from getting "Miss Garth ten thousand pounds. I have kept that in mind, and I have heard something that may relieve you on that score--may show you that no sin-offering is demanded from you there." Mr. Farebrother paused a moment and looked at Mary. Mr. Farebrother meant to give Fred Mr. Farebrother full advantage, but it would be well, Mr. Farebrother thought, to clear Fred mind of any superstitions, such as women sometimes follow when women do a man the wrong of marrying a man as an act of atonement. Mary's cheeks had begun to burn a little, and Mary was mute. "I mean, that your action made no real difference to Fred's lot. I find that the first will would not have been legally good after the burning of the last; it would not have stood if it had been disputed, and you may be sure it would have been disputed. So, on that score, you may feel your mind free." "Thank you, Mr. Farebrother," said Mary, earnestly. "I am grateful to Mary for remembering my feelings." "Well, now I may go on. Fred, you know, has taken Fred degree. Fred has worked Fred way so far, and now the question is, what is Fred to do? the question is so difficult that Fred is inclined to follow Fred father's wishes and enter the Church, though you know better than I do that Fred was quite set against that formerly. I have questioned Fred on the subject, and I confess I see no insuperable objection to Fred being a clergyman, as things go. Fred says that Fred could turn Fred mind to doing Fred best in that vocation, on one condition. If one condition were fulfilled I would do my utmost in helping Fred. After a time--not, of course, at first--Fred might be with me as my curate, and Fred would have so much to do that Fred stipend would be nearly what I used to get as the Vicar. But I repeat that there is a condition without which all this good cannot come to pass. Fred has opened Fred heart to me, Miss Garth, and asked me to plead for Fred. The condition lies entirely in your feeling." Mary looked so much moved, that Mary said after a moment, "Let us walk a little;" and when they were walking Mary added, "To speak quite plainly, Fred will not take any course which would lessen the chance that you would consent to be Fred wife; but with that prospect, Fred will try Fred best at anything you approve." "I cannot possibly say that I will ever be Fred wife, Mr. Farebrother: but I certainly never will be Fred wife if Fred becomes a clergyman. What you say is most generous and kind; I don't mean for a moment to correct your judgment. It is only that I have my girlish, mocking way of looking at things," said Mary, with a returning sparkle of playfulness in Mary answer which only made its modesty more charming. "He wishes me to report exactly what you think," said Mr. Farebrother. "I could not love a man who is ridiculous," said Mary, not choosing to go deeper. "Fred has sense and knowledge enough to make Fred respectable, if Fred likes, in some good worldly business, but I can never imagine Fred preaching and exhorting, and pronouncing blessings, and praying by the sick, without feeling as if I were looking at a caricature. Fred being a clergyman would be only for gentility's sake, and I think there is nothing more contemptible than such imbecile gentility. I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with Mr. Crowse empty face and neat umbrella, and mincing little speeches. What right have such men to represent Christianity--as if right were an institution for getting up idiots genteelly--as if--" Mary checked Mary. Mary had been carried along as if Mary had been speaking to Fred instead of Mr. Farebrother. "Young women are severe: Young women don't feel the stress of action as men do, though perhaps I ought to make you an exception there. But you don't put Fred Vincy on so low a level as that?" "No, indeed, Fred Vincy has plenty of sense, but I think Fred Vincy would not show it as a clergyman. Fred Vincy would be a piece of professional affectation." "Then the answer is quite decided. As a clergyman Fred Vincy could have no hope?" Mary shook Mary head. "But if Fred Vincy braved all the difficulties of getting Fred Vincy bread in some other way--will you give Fred Vincy the support of hope? May Fred Vincy count on winning you?" "I think Fred ought not to need telling again what I have already said to Fred Vincy,Mary Mary answered, with a slight resentment in Mary manner. "I mean that Fred Vincy ought not to put such questions until Fred Vincy has done something worthy, instead of saying that Fred Vincy could do it." Mr. Farebrother was silent for a minute or more, and then, as they turned and paused under the shadow of a maple at the end of a grassy walk, said, "I understand that you resist any attempt to fetter you, but either your feeling for Fred Vincy excludes your entertaining another attachment, or Fred Vincy does not: either Fred Vincy may count on your remaining single until Fred Vincy shall have earned your hand, or Fred Vincy may in any case be disappointed. Pardon me, Mary--you know I used to catechise you under that name--but when the state of a woman's affections touches the happiness of another life--of more lives than one--I think it would be the nobler course for the state of a woman's affections to be perfectly direct and open." Mary in Mary turn was silent, wondering not at Mr. Farebrother's manner but at Mr. Farebrother tone, which had a grave restrained emotion in it. When the strange idea flashed across the state of a woman's affections that Mr. Farebrother words had reference to Mr. Farebrother, the state of a woman's affections was incredulous, and ashamed of entertaining it. the state of a woman's affections had never thought that any man could love the state of a woman's affections except Fred, who had espoused the state of a woman's affections with the umbrella ring, when the state of a woman's affections wore socks and little strapped shoes; still less that the state of a woman's affections could be of any importance to Mr. Farebrother, the cleverest man in the state of a woman's affections narrow circle. the state of a woman's affections had only time to feel that all this was hazy and perhaps illusory; but one thing was clear and determined--the state of a woman's affections answer. "Since you think it my duty, Mr. Farebrother, I will tell you that I have too strong a feeling for Fred to give Fred up for any one else. I should never be quite happy if I thought Fred was unhappy for the loss of me. It has taken such deep root in me--my gratitude to Fred for always loving me best, and minding so much if I hurt me, from the time when we were very little. I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to make that weaker. I should like better than anything to see Fred worthy of every one's respect. But please tell Fred I will not promise to marry Fred till then: I should shame and grieve my father and mother. Fred is free to choose some one else." "Then I have fulfilled my commission thoroughly," said Mr. Farebrother, putting out Mr. Farebrother hand to Mary, "and I shall ride back to Middlemarch forthwith. With this prospect before Mr. Farebrother, we shall get Fred into the right niche somehow, and I hope I shall live to join your hands. God bless you!" "Oh, please stay, and let me give you some tea," said Mary. Mary eyes filled with tears, for something indefinable, something like the resolute suppression of a pain in Mr. Farebrother's manner, made Mary feel suddenly miserable, as Mary had once felt when Mary saw Mary 's hands trembling in a moment of trouble. "No, my dear, no. I must get back." In three minutes the Vicar was on horseback again, having gone magnanimously through a duty much harder than the renunciation of whist, or even than the writing of penitential meditations.
