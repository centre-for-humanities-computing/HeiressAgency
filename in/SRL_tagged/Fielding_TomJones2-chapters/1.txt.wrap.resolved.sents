A Comparison between the World and the Stage.
World has been often compared to the Theater; and many grave Writers, as well as the Poets, have considered human Life as a great Drama, resembling, in almost every Particular, those scenical Representations, which Thespis is first reported to have invented, and which have been since received with so much Approbation and Delight in all polite Countries.
This Thought has been carried so far, and become so general, that some Words proper to the Theater, and which were, at first, metaphorically applied to World, are now indiscriminately and literally spoken of both: Thus Stage and Scene are by common Use grown as familiar to us, when us speak of Life in general, as when us confine us to dramatic Performances; and when us mention Transactions behind the Curtain, St. James's is more likely to occur to us Thoughts than Drury Lane.
It may seem easy enough to account for all this, by reflecting that the theatrical Stage is nothing more than a Representation, or, as Aristotle calls it, an Imitation of what really exists; and hence, perhaps, we might fairly pay a very high Compliment to those, who by their Writings or Actions have been so capable of imitating Life, as to have their Pictures, in a Manner confounded with, or mistaken for the Originals.
But, in Reality, us are not so fond of paying Compliments to these People, whom us use as Children frequently do the Instruments of Children Amusements; and have much more Pleasure in hissing and buffeting them, than in admiring them Excellence.
There are many other Reasons which have induced us to see this Analogy between the World and the Stage.
Some have considered the larger Part of Mankind in the light of Actors, as personating Characters no more Some own, and to which, in Fact, Some have no better Title, than the Player has to be in Earnest thought the King or Emperor whom the Player represents.
Thus the Hypocrite may be said to be a Player; and indeed the Greeks called them both by one and the same Name.
The Brevity of Life has likewise given Occasion to this Comparison.
So the immortal Shakespeare.
-- Life's a poor Player, That storms and struts Player Hour upon the Stage, And then is heard no more.
For which hackneyed Quotation, I will make the Reader Amends by a very noble one, which few, I believe, have read.
the Reader Amends is taken from a Poem called the DEITY, published about nine Years ago, and long since buried in Oblivion.
A Proof that good Books no more than good Men do always survive the bad.
From thee The DEITY.
all human Actions take all human Actions Spring The rise of Empires, and the Fall of Kings!
See the VAST THEATER OF TIME displayed, While over the Scene succeeding Heraes tread!
With Pomp the shining Images succeed, What Leaders triumph, and what Monarchs bleed!
Perform the Parts thy Providence assigned, the Parts thy Providence Pride the Parts thy Providence Passions to thy Ends inclined: A while the Parts thy Providence glitter in the Face of Day, Then at thy Nod the Phantoms pass away; No Traces left of all the busy Scene, But that Remembrance says -- THE THINGS HAVE BEEN!
In all these, however, and in every other Similitude of Life to the Theater, the Resemblance has been always taken from the Stage only.
None, as I remember, have at all considered the Audience at this great Drama.
But as nature often exhibits some of her best Performances to a very full House; so will the Behavior of our Spectators no less admit the above mentioned Comparison than that of her Actors.
In this vast Theater of Time are seated the Friend and the Critic; here are Claps and Shouts, Hisses and Groans; in short, every Thing which was ever seen or heard at the Theater Royal.
Let us examine this in one Example: For Instance, in the Behavior of the great Audience on that Scene which Nature was pleased to exhibit in the 12th Chapter of the preceding Book, where her introduced Black George running away with the 500l.
from his Friend and Benefactor.
Those who sat in the World's upper Gallery, treated that Incident, I am well convinced, with Those who sat in the World's upper Gallery usual Vociferation; and every Term of scurrilous Reproach was most probably vented on that Occasion.
If we had descended to the next Order of Spectators, we should have found an equal Degree of Abhorrence, though less of Noise and Scurrility; yet here the good Women gave Black George to the Devil, and many of the good Women expected every Minute that the cloven-footed Gentleman would fetch the cloven-footed Gentleman own.
The Pit, as usual, was no doubt divided: Those who delight in heroic Virtue and perfect Character, objected to the producing such Instances of Villainy, without punishing the producing such Instances of Villainy very severely for the Sake of Example.
Some of the Author's Friends, cried -- 'Look'e, Gentlemen, The Adventure of a Beggar-Man is a Villain; but it is Nature for all that.'
And all the young Critics of the Age, the Clerks, Apprentices, etc.
called it Low, and fell a Groaning.
As for the Boxes, the Boxes behaved with the Boxes accustomed Politeness.
Most of the Boxes were attending to something else.
Some of those few who regarded the Scene at all, declared The Adventure of a Beggar-Man was a bad Kind of Man; while others refused to give others opinion 'till others had heard the best Judges.
Now we, who are admitted behind the Scenes of this great Theater of Nature, (and no Author ought to write any Thing besides Dictionaries and Spelling-Books who has not this Privilege) can censure the Action, without conceiving any absolute Detestation of the Person, whom perhaps Nature may not have designed to act an ill Part in all her Dramas: For in this Instance, Life most exactly resembles the Stage, since it is often the same Person who represents the Villain and the Hero; and he who engages your Admiration Today, will probably attract your Contempt Tomorrow.
As Garrick, whom I regard in Tragedy to be the greatest Genius World has ever produced, sometimes condescends to play the Fool; so did Scipio the Great and Laelius the Wise, according to Horace, many Years ago: nay, Cicero reports many Years to have been 'incredibly childish.'
-- many Years, it is true played the Fool, like my Friend Garrick, in Jest only; but several eminent Characters have, in numberless Instances of Characters Lives, played the Fool egregiously in Earnest; so far as to render it a Matter of some Doubt, whether their Wisdom or Folly was predominant; or whether their were better entitled to the Applause or Censure, the Admiration or Contempt, the Love or Hatred of Mankind.
Those Persons, indeed, who have passed any Time behind the Scenes of this great Theater, and are thoroughly acquainted not only with the several Disguises which are there put on, but also with the fantastic and capricious Behavior of the Passions who are the Managers and Directors of this great Theater, (for as to Reason the Patentee, Disguises is known to be a very idle Fellow, and seldom to exert Disguises) may most probably have learned to construe the famous Nil admirari of Horace, or in the English Phrase, To stare at nothing.
A single bad Act no more constitutes a Villain in Life, than a single bad Part on the Stage.
The Passions, like the Managers of a Playhouse, often force Men upon Parts, without consulting Men Judgment, and sometimes without any Regard to Men Talents.
Thus the Man, as well as the Player, may condemn what he himself acts; nay, it is common to see Vice sit as awkwardly on some Men, as the Character of Iago would on the honest Face of Mr. William Mills.
Upon the whole then, the Man of Candor and of true Understanding, is never hasty to condemn.
the Man of Candor can censure an Imperfection, or even a Vice, without Rage against the guilty Party.
In a Word, they are the same Folly, the same Childishness, the same Ill-breeding, and the same Ill Nature, which raise all the Clamours and Uproars both in Life and on the Stage.
The worst of Men generally have the Words Rogue and Villain most in Men Mouths, as the lowest of all Wretches are the aptest to cry out low in The Pit.
CHAP.
II.
Containing a Conversation which Mr. Jones had with Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones received Mr. Jones Effects from Mr. Allworthy's early in the Morning, with the following Answer to Mr. Jones Letter.
SIR, I AM commanded by my Uncle to acquaint you, that as my Uncle did not proceed to those Measures my Uncle has taken with you, without the greatest Deliberation, and after the fullest Evidence of your Unworthiness, so will it be always out of your Power to cause the least Alteration in my Uncle Resolution.
my Uncle expresses great Surprise at your Presumption in saying, you have resigned all Pretensions to a young Lady, to whom it is impossible you should ever have had any, Lady Birth and Fortune having made Lady so infinitely your superior.
Lastly, I am commanded to tell you, that the only instance of your Compliance with my Uncle's Inclinations, which my Uncle requires, is, your immediately quitting this Country.
I cannot conclude this without offering you my Advice, as a Christian, that you would seriously think of amending your Life; that you may be assisted with Grace so to do, will be always the Prayer of  Your Humble Servant, W. BLIFIL.
Many contending Passions were raised in our Hero's Mind by his Letter; but the Tender prevailed at last over the Indignant and Irascible, and a Flood of Tears came seasonably to Irascible Assistance, and possibly prevented Irascible Misfortunes from either turning Irascible Head, or bursting Irascible Heart.
Irascible grew, however soon ashamed of indulging this Remedy; and starting up, Irascible cried, 'Well then, I will give Mr. Allworthy's early in the Morning the only Instance Mr. Allworthy's early in the Morning requires of my Obedience.
I will go this Moment -- but whither?
-- why let Fortune direct; since there is no other who thinks it of any Consequence what becomes of this wretched Person, it shall be a Matter of equal Indifference to myself.
Shall I alone regard what no other?
-- Ha!
have I not Reason to think there is another?
-- One whose Value is above that of the whole World!
-- I may, I must imagine my Sophia is not indifferent to what becomes of myself.
Shall I then leave this only Friend -- and such a Friend?
Shall I not stay with my Sophia?
-- Where?
How can I stay with my Sophia?
Have I any Hopes of even seeing my Sophia, though my Sophia was as desirous as myself, without exposing my Sophia to the Wrath of my Sophia Father?
And to what Purpose?
Can I think of soliciting such a Creature to Consent to Consent own Ruin?
Shall I indulge any Passion of mine at such a Price?
-- Shall I lurk about this Country like a Thief, with such Intentions?
-- No, I disdain, I detest the Thought.
Farewell, my Sophia; farewell most lovely, most beloved -- ' Here Passion stopped his Mouth, and found a Vent at his Eyes.
And now, having taken a Resolution to leave this Country, his began to debate with his whither his should go.
World, as Milton phrases it, lay all before his; and Mr. Jones no more than Adam, had any Man to whom his might resort for Comfort or Assistance.
All his Acquaintance were the Acquaintance of Mr. Allworthy's early in the Morning, and his had no Reason to expect any Countenance from them, as that Gentleman had withdrawn Gentleman Favor from Gentleman.
Men of great and good Characters should indeed be very cautious how Men of great and good Characters discard Men of great and good Characters Dependents; for the Consequence to the unhappy Sufferer is being discarded by all others.
What Course of Life to pursue, or to what Business to apply himself, was a second Consideration; and here the Prospect was all a melancholy Void.
Every profession, and every Trade, required Length of Time, and what was worse, Money; for Matters are so Constituted that 'Nothing out of Nothing' is not a truer Maxim in Physics than in Politics; and every Man who is greatly destitute of Money is on that Account entirely excluded from all Means of acquiring that Account.
At last the Ocean, that hospitable Friend to the Wretched, opened her capacious Arms to receive him; and him instantly resolved to accept her kind Invitation.
To express myself less figuratively, him determined to go to Sea.
This Thought indeed no sooner suggested no, than him eagerly embraced no; and having presently hired Horses, him set out for Bristol to put no in Execution.
But before we attend him on him Expedition, we shall resort a while to Mr. Western's, and see what farther happened to my Sophia.
CHAP.
III.
Containing several Dialogues.
THE Morning in which Mr. Jones departed, Mr. Western summoned my Sophia into my Sophia Apartment, and having first accquainted my Sophia that my Sophia had obtained my Sophia Liberty of her Father, my Sophia proceeded to read my Sophia a long Lecture on the Subject of Matrimony; which my Sophia treated not as a romantic Scheme of Happiness arising from Love, as it has been described by the Poets; nor did my Sophia mention any of those Purposes for which we are taught by Divines to regard it as instituted by sacred Authority; my Sophia considered it rather as a Fund in which prudent Women deposited prudent Women Fortunes to the best Advantage, in order to receive a larger Interest for prudent Women, than prudent Women could have elsewhere.
When Mr. Western had finished, my Sophia answered, 'that my Sophia was very incapable of arguing with a Lady of my Sophia Aunt's superior Knowledge and Experience, especially on a Subject which my Sophia had so very little considered, as this of Matrimony.'
'Argue with me, Child!'
replied the other, 'I did not indeed expect it.
I should have seen World to very little Purpose truly, if I am to argue with one of your Years.
I have taken this Trouble, in order to instruct you.
The ancient Philosophers, such as Socrates, Alcibiades, and others, did not use to argue with The ancient Philosophers, such as Socrates, Alcibiades, and others Scholars.
You are to consider me, Child, as Socrates, not asking your Opinion, but only informing you of mine.'
From which last Words the Reader may possibly imagine, that this Lady had read no more of the Philosophy of Socrates, than this Lady had of that of Alcibiades; and indeed we cannot resolve Alcibiades Curiosity as to this Point.
'Madam,' cries my Sophia, 'I have never presumed to controvert any Opinion of yours, and Subject, as I said, I have never yet thought of, and perhaps never may.
'Indeed Sophy,' replied the Aunt, 'this Dissimulation with me is very foolish.
The French shall as soon persuade me, that they take foreign Towns in Defense only of foreign Towns own Country, as you can impose on me to believe you have never yet thought seriously of Matrimony.
How can you, Child, affect to deny that you have considered of contracting an Alliance, when you so well know I am acquainted with the Party with whom you desire to contract it.
An Alliance as unnatural, and contrary to your Interest, as a separate League with the French would be to the Interest of the Dutch!
But however, if you have not hitherto considered of this Matter, I promise you it is now high Time; for my Brother is resolved immediately to conclude the Treaty with Mr. Blifil; and indeed I am a sort of Guarantee in the Affair, and have promised your Concurrence.
'Indeed, Madam,' cries Sophia, 'this is the only Instance in which I must disobey both yourself and my Father.
For this is a Match which requires very little Consideration in me to refuse.'
'If I was not as great a Philosopher as Socrates himself,' returned Mrs. Western, 'you would overcome my Patience.
What Objection can you have to the young Gentleman?
'A very solid Objection, in my Opinion,' says my Sophia, -- 'I hate the young Gentleman.'
'Will you never learn a proper Use of Words?'
answered her Aunt.
'Indeed Child, you should consult Bailey's Dictionary.
It is impossible you should hate a Man from whom you have received no Injury.
By Hatred, therefore, you mean no more than Dislike, which is no sufficient Objection against marrying of a Man from whom you have received no Injury.
I have known many Couples, who have entirely disliked each other, lead very comfortable, genteel lives.
Believe me, Child, I know these Things better than Child.
You will allow me, I think, to have seen the World, in which I have not an Acquaintance who would not rather be thought to dislike Acquaintance Husband, than to like her Husband.
The contrary is such out-of-Fashion romantic Nonsense, that the very imagination of it is shocking.
'Indeed, Madam,' replied my Sophia, 'I shall never marry a Man I dislike.
If I promise my Father never to consent to any Marriage contrary to my Father Inclinations, I think I may hope my Father will never force me into that State contrary to my own.
'Inclinations!'
cries her Aunt with some Warmth.
'Inclinations!
I am astonished at your assurance.
A young Woman of your Age, and unmarried, to talk of Inclinations!
But whatever your Inclinations may be, my Brothar is resolved; nay, since you talk of Inclinations, I shall advise my Brothar to hasten the Treaty.
Inclinations!
my Sophia then flung my Sophia upon my Sophia Knees, and Tears began to trickle from his Eyeshis Eyes.
my Sophia entreated my Sophia Aunt, 'to have Mercy upon my Sophia, and not to resent so cruelly my Sophia Unwillingness to make my Sophia miserable; often urging that my Sophia alone was concerned, and that my Sophia Happiness only was at Stake.'
As a Bailiff, when well authorized by Bailiff Writ, having possessed Bailiff of the Person of some unhappy Debtor, views all Bailiff Tears without concern: In vain the wretched Captive attempts to raise Compassion; in vain the tender Wife bereft of Wife Companion, the little prattling Boy, or frighted Girl, are mentioned as inducements to Reluctance.
The noble Bumtrap, blind and deaf, to every Circumstance of Distress, greatly rises above all the Motives to Humanity, and into the Hands of the Jailer resolves to deliver the Jailer miserable Prey.
Not less blind to the Tears, or less deaf to every Entreaty of my Sophia was her Aunt, nor less determined was her Aunt to deliver over the trembling Maid into the Arms of the Jailer Blifil.
her Aunt answered with great Impetuosity, 'So far, Madam, from your being concerned alone, your concern is the least, or surely the least important.
It is the Honor of your Family which is concerned in Alliance; you are only the Instrument.
Do you conceive, Mistress, that in an Intermarriage between Kingdoms, as when a Daughter of France is married into Spain, that the Princess herself is alone considered in the Match?
No, it is a match between two Kingdoms, rather than between two Persons.
The same happens in great Families, such as ours.
Alliance is the Principal Matter.
You ought to have a greater Regard for the Honor of your Familyyour Family, than for your own Person; and if the Example of a Princess cannot inspire you with these noble Thoughts, you cannot surely complain at being used no worse than all Princesses are used.
'I hope, Madam,' cries my Sophia, with a little Elevation of Voice, 'I shall never do any Thing to dishonor my Family; but as for Mr. Blifil, whatever may be the Consequence, I am resolved against Mr. Blifil, and no Force shall prevail in Mr. Blifil Favor.
Western, who had been within hearing during the greater Part of the preceding Dialogue, had now exhausted all his Patience; his therefore entered the Room in a violent Passion, crying, 'D -- n me then if shatunt have un, d -- n me if shatunt, that is all -- that is all -- D -- n me if shatunt.
Mr. Western had collected a sufficient Quantity of Wrath for the Use of my Sophia; but my Sophia now transfered it all to the Squire.
'Brother,' said my Sophia, 'it is astonishing that you will interfere in a Matter which you had totally left to my Negotiation.
Regard to my Family has made me take upon my Family to be the mediating Power, in order to rectify those mistakes in Policy which you have committed in your Daughter's Education.
For, Brother, it is you; it is your preposterous Conduct which has eradicated all the Seeds that I had formerly sown in my Sophia tender Mind.
-- It is yourself who have taught my Sophia Disobedience.'
-- 'Blood!'
cries the Squire, foaming at the Mouth, 'you are enough to conquer the Patience of the Devil!
Have I ever taught her Disobedience?
-- Here my Sophia stands; Speak honestly, my Sophia, did ever I bid you be disobedient to my Sophia?
Have I not done every thing to humor and to gratify you, and to make you obedient to my Sophia?
And very obedient to my Sophia my Sophia was when a little Child, before you took my Sophia in Hand and spoiled my Sophia, by filling my Sophia Head with a Pack of Court Notions.
-- Why -- why -- why -- did not I over-hear you telling my Sophia my Sophia must behave like a Princess?
You have made a Whig of the Girl; and how should my Sophia Father, or any body else, expect any Obedience from my Sophia?'
'Brother,' answered Mr. Western, with an Air of great disdain, 'I cannot express the Contempt I have for your Politics of all Kinds; but I will appeal likewise to this Lady, whether I have ever taught this Lady any Principles of Disobedience.
On the contrary, Niece, have I not endeavored to inspire you with a true Idea of the several Relations in which a human Creature stands in Society?
Have I not taken infinite Pains to show you, that the Law of Nature has enjoined a Duty on Children to Children Parents?
Have I not told you what Plato says on that Subject?
-- A Subject on which you was so notoriously ignorant when you came first under my Care, that I verily believe you did not know the Relation between a Daughter and a Father.'
' It Is Lie,' answered Western.
'the Girl is no such Fool, as to live to eleven Years old without knowing that the Girl was the Girl Father's Relation.'
'O more than Gothic Ignorance,' answered this Lady.
-- 'And as for your Manners, Brother, I must tell you, they deserve a Cane.'
'Why then you may gi' it me, if you think you are able,' cries the Squire; 'nay, I suppose your Niece there will be ready enough to help you.'
'Brother,' said Mrs. Western, 'tho' I despise you beyond Expression, yet I shall endure your Insolence no longer; so I desire my Coach may be got ready immediately, for I am resolved to leave your House this very Morning.'
'And a good Riddance too,' answered my Coach; 'I can bear your Insolence no longer, an you come to that.
Blood!
it is almost enough of it, to make my Daughter undervalue my Sense, when my Daughter hears you telling me every Minute you despise me.'
'It is impossible, it is impossible,' cries her Aunt, 'no one can undervalue such a Boor.
Boar,' answered the Squire, 'I am no Boar; no, nor Ass; no, nor Rat neither, Madam.
Remember that -- I am no Rat.
I am a ture Englishman, and not of your Hanover Breed, that have eat up the Nation.
Thou art one of those wise Men,' cries my Daughter, 'whose nonsensical Principles have undone the Nation; by weakening the Hands of our Government at home, and by discouraging our Friends, and encouraging our Enemies abroad.'
'Ho!
are you come back to your Politics,' cries the Squire, 'as for those I despise them as much as I do a F -- t. Which last Words he accompanied and graced with the very Action, which of all others was the most proper to it.
And whether it was this Word, or the Contempt expressed for the Contempt Politics, which most affected Mr. Western, I will not determine; but the Contempt flew into the most violent Rage, uttered Phrases improper to be here related, and instantly burst out of the House.
Nor did the Contempt Brother or the Contempt Niece think proper either to stop or to follow the Contempt: For the one was so much possessed by Concern, and the other by Anger, that her Brother or her Niece were rendered almost motionless.
the Squire, however, sent after the Squire Sister the same Holla which attends the Departure of a Hare, when his Sister is first started before the Hounds.
the Squire was indeed a great Master of this Kind of Vociferation, and had a Holla proper for most Occasions in Life.
Women who, like Mr. Western, know the World, and have applied Women who, like Mrs. Western, know the World, and have applied themselves to Philosophy and Politics to Philosophy and Politics, would have immediately availed Women who, like Mrs. Western, know the World, and have applied themselves to Philosophy and Politics of the present Disposition of Mr. Western's Mind; by throwing in a few artful Compliments to the Squire Understanding at the Expense of the Squire absent Adversary; but poor my Sophia was all Simplicity.
By which Word we do not intend to insinuate to the Reader, that poor Sophia was silly, which is generally understood as a synonimous Term with simple: For poor Sophia was indeed a most sensible poor Sophia, and poor Sophia Understanding was of the first Rate; but poor Sophia wanted all that useful Art which Females convert to so many good Purposes in Life, and which, as it rather arises from the Heart, than from the Head, is often the Property of the silliest of Women.
CHAP.
IV.
A Picture of a Country Gentlewoman taken from the Life.
MR. Western having finished his Holla, and taken a little Breath, began to lament, in very pathetic Terms, the unfortunate Condition of Men, who are, says his, always whipped in by the Humors of some d -- nd B -- or other.
I think I was hard run enough by her Mother for one Man; but after giving her Mother a Dodge, here is another B -- follows me upon the Foil; but curse my Jacket if I will be run down in this Manner by any o'um.
poor Sophia never had a single Dispute with poor Sophia , till this unlucky Affair of Blifil, on any Account, except in Defense of poor Sophia Mother, whom poor Sophia had loved most tenderly, though poor Sophia lost poor Sophia in the eleventh Year of poor Sophia Age.
The Squire, to whom that poor poor Sophia had been a faithful upper Servant all the Time of their Marriage, had returned that Behavior, by making what the World calls a good Husband.
a good Husband very seldom swore at poor Sophia (perhaps not above once a Week) and never beat poor Sophia: poor Sophia had not the least Occasion for Jealousy, and was perfect Mistress of poor Sophia Time: for poor Sophia was never interrupted by poor Sophia Husband, who was engaged all the Morning in a good Husband Field Exercises, and all the Evening with Bottle-Companions.
poor Sophia scarce indeed ever saw a good Husband but at Meals; where poor Sophia had the Pleasure of carving those Dishes which poor Sophia had before attended at the Dressing.
From these Meals poor Sophia retired about five Minutes after the other Servants, having only stayed to drink the King over the Water.
Such were, it seems, Mr. Western's Orders: For it was a Maxim with Maxim, that Women should come in with the first Dish, and go out after the first Glass.
Obedience to these Orders was perhaps no difficult Task: For the Conversation (if it may be called so) was seldom such as could entertain this Lady.
it consisted chiefly of Hollowing, Singing, Relations of sporting Adventures, B -- d -- y, and Abuse of Women and of the Government.
These, however, were the only Seasons when Mr. Western saw his Wife: For when Mr. Western repaired to his Wife Bed, Mr. Western was generally so drunk that Mr. Western could not see; and in the sporting Season Mr. Western always rose from his Wife before it was light.
Thus was his Wife perfect Mistress of his Wife Time; and had besides a Coach and four usually at his Wife Command; though unhappily indeed the Badness of the Neighborhood, and of the Roads, made this of little Use: For none who had set much Value on their Necks would have passed through the one, or who had set any Value on their Necks Hours, would have visited the other.
Now to deal honestly with the Reader, his Wife did not make all the Return expected to so much Indulgence: For his Wife had been married against his Wife Will, by a fond Father, the Match having been rather advantageous on his Wife Side: For the Squire's Estate was upwards of 3000 l. a Year, and his Wife Fortune no more than a bare 8000 l. Hence perhaps his Wife had contracted a little Gloominess of Temper: For his Wife was rather a good Servant than a good Wife; nor had his Wife always the Gratitude to return the extraordinary Degree of roaring Mirth, with which the Squire received his Wife, even with a good humoured Smile.
his Wife would, moreover, sometimes interfere with Matters which did not concern his Wife, as the violent Drinking of his Wife Husband, which in the gentlest Terms his Wife would take some of the few Opportunities he gave his Wife of remonstrating against.
And once in his Wife Life his Wife very earnestly entreated he to carry his Wife for two Months to London, which he peremptorily denied; nay, was angry with he Wife for the Request ever after, being well assured, that all the Husbands in London are Cuckolds.
For this last, and many other good Reasons, Western at length heartily hated he his Wife; and this Hatred as he never concealed before his Wife Death, so he never forgot it afterward; but when any Thing in the least soured he, as a bad scenting Day, or a Distemper among he Hounds, or any other such Misfortune, he constantly vented he Spleen by Invectives against the Deceased; saying, -- 'If his Wife his Wife was alive now, his Wife would be glad of this.'
Invectives Invectives was especially desirous of throwing forth before poor Sophia: For as Invectives loved his Wife more than Invectives did any other, so Invectives was really jealous that his Wife had loved his Wife Mother better than Invectives.
And poor Sophia poor Sophia seldom failed of heightening on these Occasions: For Invectives was not contented with violating his Wife Ears with the Abuse of his Wife ; but endeavored to force an explicit Approbation of all this Abuse, with which Desire Invectives never could prevail upon his Wife by any Promise or Threats to comply.
Hence some of my Readers will, perhaps, wonder that the Squire had not hated poor Sophia as much as the Squire had hated her Motherher Mother; but I must inform the Squire had not hated Sophia as much as he had hated her Mother, that Hatred is not the Effect of Love, even through the Medium of Jealousy.
It is, indeed, very possible for jealous Persons to kill the Objects of jealous Persons Jealousy, but not to hate jealous Persons.
Which Sentiment being a pretty hard Morsel, and bearing something of the Air of a Paradox, we shall leave the Reader to chew the Cud upon the Reader to the End of the Chapter.
CHAP.
V. The generous Behavior of poor Sophia toward poor Sophia Aunt.
poor Sophia kept Silence during the foregoing Speech of poor Sophia , nor did poor Sophia once answer otherwise than with a Sigh; but as The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt understood none of the Language, or as The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt called it, Lingo of the Eyes, so The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt was not satisfied without some further Approbation of The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt Sentiments; which The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt now demanded in the usual Way of The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt Daughter; telling poor Sophia, 'The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt expected poor Sophia was ready to take the Part of every Body against The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt, as poor Sophia had always done that of the B -- poor Sophia Mother.'
poor Sophia remaining still silent, The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt cried out, 'What art dumb?
why do unt speak.
Was not thy Mother a d -- d B -- to The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt?
Answer me that.
What, I suppose, you despise her Father too, and don't think her Father good enough to speak to?'
'For Heaven's Sake, The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt,' answered poor Sophia, 'do not give so cruel a Turn to my Silence.
I am sure I would sooner die than be guilty of any Disrespect toward you; but how can I venture to speak, when every Word must either offend my dear Papa, or convict me of the blackest Ingratitude as well as Impiety to the Memory of the best of Mothers: For such, I am certain my Mamma was always to my dear Papa?'
'And your Aunt, I suppose, is the best of Sisters too!'
replied the Squire.
'Will you be so kind as to allow that the Squire is a B --?
I may fairly insist upon that, I think.'
'Indeed, The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt,' says poor Sophia, 'I have great Obligations to your Aunt.
your Aunt has been a second Mother to The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt.'
'And a second Wife to The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt too,' returned Western; 'so you will take your Aunt Part too!
You will not confess that your Aunt has acted the Part of the vilest Sister in the World?'
'Upon my Word, The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt,' cries poor Sophia, 'I must belie my Heart wickedly if I did.
I know my Aunt and you differ very much in your Ways of thinking; but I have heard your Aunt a thousand Times express the greatest Affection for you; and I am convinced so far from your Aunt being the worst Sister in the World, there are very few who love a Brother better.'
'The English of all which is,' answered the Squire, 'that I am in the Wrong.
Ay, certainly.
Ay, to be sure your Aunt is in the Right, and the Man in the Wrong always.'
'Pardon me, The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt,' cries poor Sophia, 'I do not say so.'
'What don't you say,' answered her Father?
'you have the Impudence to say your Aunt is in the Right; does the Impudence not follow then of Course that I Am in the Wrong?
And perhaps I am in the Wrong to suffer such a Presbyterian Hanoverian B -- to come into my House.
my House may 'dite me of a Plot for any Thing I know, and give my Estate to the Government.'
'So far, The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt, from injuring you or your Estate,' says poor Sophia, 'if your Aunt had died Yesterday, I am convinced my House would have left you my House whole Fortune.'
Whether poor Sophia intended it or no, I shall not presume to assert; but certain it is, these last Words penetrated very deep into the Ears of poor Sophia , and produced a much more sensible Effect than all poor Sophia had said before.
He received the Sound with much the same Action as a Man receives a Bullet in He Head.
He started, staggered and turned pale.
After which He remained silent above a Minute, and then began in the following hesitating Manner.
'Yesterday!
poor Sophia would have left me poor Sophia Esteate Yesterday!
would poor Sophia?
Why Yesterday of all the Days in the Year?
I suppose if poor Sophia dies Tomorrow poor Sophia will leave she dies Tomorrow to somebody else, and perhaps out of the Vamily:' 'My Aunt, Sir,' cries Sophia, 'hath very violent Passions, and I cannot answer what poor Sophia may do under My Aunt, Sir,' cries Sophia Influence.'
'You cannot!
returned her Father, 'and pray who has been the Occasion of putting poor Sophia into those violent Passions?
Nay, who has actually put poor Sophia into those violent Passions?
Was not you and poor Sophia hard at it before I came into the Room?
Besides, was not all our Quarrel about poor Sophia?
I have not quarreled with poor Sophia these many Years but upon your Account; and now you would throw the whole Blame upon poor Sophia, as thof I should be the Occasion of poor Sophia leaving poor Sophia Esteate out of the Vamily.
I could have expected no better indeed, this is like the Return you make to all the rest of my Fondness.'
'I beseech you then,' cries poor Sophia, 'upon my Knees I beseech you, if I have been the unhappy Occasion of this Difference, that you will endeavor to make it up with your Aunt, and not suffer your Aunt to leave your my House in this violent Rage of Anger: your Aunt is a very good-natured Woman, and a few civil Words will satisfy your Aunt -- Let me entreat you, The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt.'
'So I must go and ask Pardon for your Fault, must I?'
answered Western.
'You have lost the Hare, and I must draw every Way to find your Aunt again?
Indeed if I was certain' -- Here the Hare stopped, and poor Sophia throwing in more Entreaties, at length prevailed upon the Hare; and after venting two or three bitter sarcastical Expressions against the Hare , the Hare departed as fast as the Hare could to recover the Hare poor Sophia, before poor Sophia Equipage could be gotten ready.
poor Sophia then retired to poor Sophia Chamber of Mourning, where poor Sophia indulged poor Sophia (if the Phrase may be allowed me) in all the Luxury of tender Grief.
poor Sophia read over the Letter which poor Sophia had received from Jones more than once; poor Sophia Muff too was used on this Occasion; and poor Sophia bathed both these, as well as poor Sophia, with poor Sophia Tears.
In this Situation, the friendly Mrs.
Honor exerted the friendly Mrs.
Honor utmost Abilities to comfort the friendly Mrs.
Honor afflicted Mistress.
the friendly Mrs.
Honor ran over the Names of many young Gentlemen; and having greatly commended the Names of many young Gentlemen Parts and Persons, assured poor Sophia that poor Sophia might take poor Sophia choice of any.
These Methods must have certainly been used with some Success in Disorders of the like Kind, or so skilful a Practitioner as the friendly Mrs.
Honor would never have ventured to apply them; nay, I have heard that the College of Chambermaids hold them to be as sovereign Remedies as any in the female Dispensary; but whether it was that poor Sophia's Disease differed inwardly, from those Cases with which the College of Chambermaids hold them to be as sovereign Remedies as any in the female Dispensary agreed in external Symptoms, I will not assert; but, in Fact, your Aunt the friendly Mrs.
Honor did more Harm than Good, and at last so incensed your Aunt Mistress (which was no easy Matter) that with an angry Voice your Aunt dismissed your Aunt from your Aunt Presence.
CHAP.
VI.
Containing great Variety of Matter.
the Squire overtook poor Sophia poor Sophia just as your Aunt was stepping into the Coach, and partly by Force, and partly by Solicitations, prevailed upon your Aunt to order your Aunt Horses back into Horses Quarters.
the Squire succeeded in this Attempt without much Difficulty: For the Lady was, as we have already hinted, of a most placable Disposition, and greatly loved the Lady Brother, though the Lady despised the Squire Parts, or rather the Squire little Knowledge of the World.
Poor Sophia, who had first set on Foot this Reconciliation, was now made the Sacrifice to it.
They both concurred in They Censures on her Conduct; jointly declared War against her; and directly proceeded to Council, how to carry it on in the most vigorous Manner.
For this Purpose, Western proposed not only an immediate Conclusion of the Treaty with Allworthy; but as immediately to carry the Treaty into Execution; saying, 'That there was no other Way to succeed with her Niece but by violent Methods, which her was convinced poor Sophia had not sufficient Resolution to resist.
'By violent, says her, 'I mean rather, hasty Measures: For as to Confinement or absolute Force, no such Things must or can be attempted.
Our Plan must be concerted for a Surprise, and not for a Storm.'
These Matters were resolved on, when Mr. Blifil came to pay a Visit to Mr. Blifil .
the Squire no sooner heard of the Squire Arrival, than the Squire stepped aside, by poor Sophia's Advice, to give the Squire Daughter Orders for the proper Reception of Daughter Orders Lover; which the Squire did with the most bitter Execrations and Denunciations of of Judgment on Daughter Orders Refusal.
The Impetuosity of the Squire bore down all before the Squire; and poor Sophia, as your Aunt your Aunt very wisely foresaw, was not able to resist The Impetuosity of the Squire.
poor Sophia agreed, therefore, to see Mr. Blifil, though poor Sophia had scarce Spirits or Strength sufficient to utter poor Sophia Assent.
Indeed to give a peremtory Denial to a Father whom poor Sophia so tenderly loved, was no easy Task.
Had this Circumstance been out of the Case, much less Resolution than what poor Sophia was really her afflicted Mistress of, would, perhaps, have served poor Sophia; but it is no unusual Thing to ascribe those Actions entirely to Fear, which are in a great Measure produced by Love.
In Pursuance, therefore, of poor Sophia 's peremptory Command, poor Sophia now admitted Mr. Blifil's Visit.
Scenes, like this, when painted at large, afford, as we have observed, very little Entertainment to the Reader.
Here, therefore, we shall strictly adhere to a Rule of Horace; by which Writers are directed to pass over all those Matters, which Writers despair of placing in a shining Light.
A Rule, we conceive, of excellent Use as well to the Historian as to the Poet; and which, if followed, must, at least, have this good Effect, that many a great Evil (for so all great Books are called) would thus be reduced to a small one.
It is possible the great Art used by Blifil at this Interview, would have prevailed on poor Sophia to have made another Man in another Man Circumstances poor Sophia Confident, and to have revealed the whole Secret of poor Sophia Heart to another Man; but poor Sophia had contracted so ill an Opinion of this young Gentleman, that poor Sophia was resolved to place no Confidence in another Man: For Simplicity, when set on it is Guard, is often a Match for Cunning.
poor Sophia Behavior to another Man, therefore, was entirely forced, and indeed such as is generally prescribed to Virgins upon the second formal Visit from one who is appointed for Virgins Husband.
But though Blifil declared Blifil perfectly satisfied with Blifil Reception to the Squire, yet that Gentleman, who in Company with Blifil poor Sophia had overheard all, was not so well pleased.
Blifil resolved, in Pursuance of the Advice of the Lady, to push Matters as forward as possible; and addressing Blifil to Blifil intended Son-in-Law in the hunting Phrase, Blifil cried after a loud Holla, 'Follow poor Sophia, Boy, follow poor Sophia; run in, run in, that is it, Honeys.
Dead, dead, dead.
-- Never be bashful, nor stand shall I, shall I?
-- Allworthy and I can finish all Matters between us this Afternoon, and let us have the Wedding Tomorrow.
Mr. Blifil having conveyed the utmost Satisfaction into Mr. Blifil Countenance, answered; 'As there is nothing, The generous Behavior of Sophia toward her Aunt, in this World, which I so eagerly desire as an Alliance with your Family, except my Union with the most amiable and deserving poor Sophia, you may easily imagine how impatient I must be to see Mr. Blifil in Possession of my two highest Wishes.
If I have not therefore importuned you on this Head, you will impute I have not therefore importuned you on this Head only to my Fear of offending the Lady, by endeavoring to hurry on so blessed an Event, faster than a strict Compliance with all the Rules of Decency and Decorum will permit.
But if by your Interest, Sir, she might be induced to dispense with any Formalities.'
--  'Formalities!
with a Pox!'
answered the Squire, 'Pooh, all Stuff and Nonsense.
I tell the Squire, she shall have the Squire Tomorrow; you will know the World better hereafter, when you come to my Age.
Women never gi' Women Consent, Man, if Women can help it, it is not the Fashion.
If I had staid for she Momother's Consent, I might have been a Bachelor to this Day.
-- To she, to she, to she, that is it, you jolly Dog.
I tell thee shat have she Tomorrow Morning.'
Mr. Blifil suffered Mr. Blifil to be overpowered by the forcible Rhetoric of the Squire; and Mr. Blifil being agreed that Western should close with Allworthy that very Afternoon, the Lover departed home, having first earnestly begged that no Violence might be offered to the Lady by this Haste, in the same Manner as a Popish Inquisitor begs the Lay Power to do no Violence to the Heretic, delivered over to the Lay Power, and against whom the Church has passed Sentence.
And to say the Truth, Mr. Blifil had passed Sentence against poor Sophia; for however pleased Mr. Blifil had declared Mr. Blifil to Western, with Mr. Blifil Reception, Mr. Blifil was by no means satisfied, unless it was that Mr. Blifil was satisfied of the Hatred and Scorn of Mr. Blifil ; and this had produced no less reciprocal Hatred and Scorn in Mr. Blifil.
It may, perhaps, be asked, Why then did Mr. Blifil not put an immediate End to all further Courtship?
I answer, for that very Reason, as well as for several others equally good, which we shall now proceed to open to the Reader.
Though Mr. Blifil was not of the Complexion of Jones, nor ready to eat every Woman Mr. Blifil saw, yet Mr. Blifil was far from being destitute of that Appetite which is said to be the common Property of Animals.
With this, Mr. Blifil had the distinguishing Taste, which serves to direct Men in Men Choice of the Objects, or Food of Men several Appetites; and this taught Mr. Blifil to consider poor Sophia as a most delicious Morsel, indeed to regard poor Sophia with the same Desires which an Ortolan inspires into the Soul on Epicure.
Now the Agonies which affected the Mind of poor Sophia rather augmented than impaired poor Sophia Beauty; for poor Sophia Tears added Brightness to poor Sophia Eyes, and poor Sophia Breasts rose higher with poor Sophia Sighs.
Indeed no one has seen Beauty in no one highest Luster, who has never seen no one in Distress.
Blifil therefore looked on an Ortolan with greater Desire than when Blifil had viewed Ortolan last; nor was Blifil Desire at all lessened by the Aversion which Blifil discovered in Ortolan to Blifil.
On the contrary, this served rather to heighten the Pleasure Blifil proposed in rifling Ortolan Charms, as this added Triumph to Lust; nay, Blifil had some further Views, from obtaining the absolute Possession of Ortolan Person, which we detest too much even to mention; and Revenge itself was not without Revenge itself Share in the Gratifications which Blifil promised Blifil.
the rivalling poor Jones, and supplanting Blifil in Ortolan Affections, added another Spur to Blifil Pursuit, and promised another additional Rapture to Blifil Enjoyment.
Besides all these Views, which to some scrupulous Persons may seem to savor too much of Malevolence, Blifil had one Prospect, which few Readers will regard with any great Abhorrence.
And this was the Estate of Mr. Western; which was all to be settled on Blifil Daughter and Daughter Issue; for so extravagant was the Affection of that fond Parent, that provided Blifil Child would but consent to be miserable with the Husband Blifil chose, Blifil cared not at what Price Blifil purchased Blifil.
For these Reasons Mr. Blifil was so desirous of the Match, that Mr. Blifil intended to deceive poor Sophia, by pretending Love to poor Sophia; and to deceive poor Sophia Father and Mr. Blifil own Uncle, by pretending Mr. Blifil was beloved by poor Sophia.
In doing this, Mr. Blifil availed Mr. Blifil of the Piety of Thwackum, who held, that if the End proposed was religious (as surely Matrimony is) the End proposed mattered not how wicked were the Means.
As, to other Occasions Mr. Blifil used to apply the Philosophy of Square, which taught, that the End was immaterial, so that the Means were fair and consistent with moral Rectitude.
To say Truth, there were few Occurrences in Life on which Mr. Blifil could not draw Advantantage from the Precepts of one or other of those great Masters.
Little Deceit was indeed necessary to be practiced on Mr. Western; who thought the Inclinations of Mr. Blifil Daughter of as little Consequence, as Mr. Blifil conceived them to be; but as the Sentiments of Allworthy were of a very different Kind, so it was absolutely necessary to impose on Allworthy.
In this, however, Mr. Blifil was so well assisted by Western, that Mr. Blifil succeeded without Difficulty: For as Allworthy had been assured by his Daughter Father that poor Sophia had a proper Affection for Mr. Blifil, and that all which Allworthy had suspected concerning Jones, was entirely false, Mr. Blifil had nothing more to do, than to confirm these Assertions; which Allworthy did with such Equivocations, that Allworthy preserved a Salvo for Allworthy Conscience; and had the Satisfaction of conveying a Lie to Allworthy Uncle, without the Guilt of telling one.
When Allworthy was examined touching the Inclinations of poor Sophia, by Allworthy, who said, 'Allworthy would, on no Account, be accessory to the forcing a young Lady into a Marriage contrary to Marriage own Will,' Allworthy answered, 'That the real Sentiments of young Ladies were very difficult to be understood; that Marriage Behavior to Allworthy was full as forward as Allworthy wished it, and that if Allworthy could believe Marriage , Marriage had all the Affection for Allworthy which any Lover could desire.
As for Jones,' said Jones, 'whom I am loath to call Villain, though Jones Behavior to you, Sir, sufficiently justifies the Appellation, Jones own Vanity, or perhaps some wicked Views, might make Jones boast of a Falsehood; for if there had been any Reality in Miss Western's Love to Jones, the Greatness of Marriage Fortune would never have suffered her Fortune to desert Marriage, as you are well informed her Fortune has.
Lastly, Jones, I promise you I would not Jones, for any Consideration, no not for the whole World, consent to marry this young Lady, if I was not persuaded Marriage had all the Passion for Jones which I desire Marriage should have.
This excellent Method of conveying a Falsehood with the Heart only, without making the Tongue guilty of an Untruth, by the Means of Equivocation and Imposture, has quieted the Conscience of many a notable Deceiver; and yet when we consider that it is Omniscience on which these endeavor to impose, it may possibly seem capable only of affording a very superficial Comfort; and that this artful and refined Distinction between communicating a Lie, and telling one, is hardly worth the Pains it costs them.
Allworthy was pretty well satisfied with what Mr. Western and Mr. Blifil told Mr. Blifil; and the Treaty was now at the End of two Days, concluded.
Nothing then remained previous to the Office of the Priest, but the Office of the Lawyers, which threatened to take up so much Time, that Western offered to bind the Priest by all Manner of Covenants, rather than to defer the Happiness of the young Couple.
Indeed the Priest was so very earnest and pressing, that an indifferent Person might have concluded the Priest was more a Principal in this Match than the Priest really was: But this Eagerness was natural to the Priest on all Occasions; and the Priest conducted every Scheme the Priest undertook in such a Manner, as if the Success of that alone was sufficient to constitute the whole Happiness of the Priest Life.
The joint Importunities of both Father and Son-in-law would probably have prevailed on Mr. Allworthy, who brooked but ill any Delay of giving Happiness to others, had poor Sophia poor Sophia prevented it, and taken Measures to put a final End to the Treaty, and to rob both Church and Law of those Taxes which these wise Bodies have thought proper to receive from the Propagation of the human Species, in a lawful Manner.
Of which in the next Chapter.

VII.
A strange Resolution of poor Sophia, and a more strange Stratagem of Mrs.
Honor.
THOUGH Mrs.
Honor was principally attached to Mrs.
Honor Interest, Mrs.
Honor was not without some little Attachment to poor Sophia.
To say Truth, it was very difficult for any one to know that young Lady without loving young Lady.
young Lady no sooner, therefore, heard a Piece of News, which young Lady imagined to be of great Importance to young Lady Mistress, than quite forgetting the Anger which young Lady had conceived two Days before, at young Lady unpleasant Dismission from poor Sophia's Presence, young Lady ran hastily to inform young Lady of this News.
The Beginning of young Lady Discourse was as abrupt as young Lady Entrance into the Room.
'O dear Ma'am,' says young Lady, 'what does your La'ship think?
To be sure, I am frightened out of my Wits; and yet I thought it my Duty to tell your La'ship, though perhaps it may make you angry, for we Servants don't always know what will make our Ladies angry; for to be sure, every thing is always laid to the Charge of a Servant.
When we young Ladies are out of Humor, to be sure we must be scolded, and to be sure I should not wonder if your La'ship should be out of Humor; nay, it must surprise you certainly, ay, and shock you too.'
-- 'Good Honor!
let me know it without any longer Preface,' says poor Sophia; 'there are few Things, I promise you, which will surprise, and fewer which will shock me.'
Dear Ma'am, answered 'Good Honor, 'to be sure, I overheard my Master talking to Parson Supple about getting a License this very Afternoon; and to be sure I heard Parson Supple say your La'ship should be married To-marrow Morning.'
poor Sophia turned pale at these Words, and repeated eagerly, 'Tomorrow Morning -- Yes, Madam,' replied the trusty Waiting Woman, 'I will take my Oath.
I heard my Master say so.'
'Good Honor,' says poor Sophia, 'you have both surprised and shocked me to such a Degree, that I have scarce any Breath or Spirit left.
What is to be done in my dreadful Situation?'
I wish I was able to advise your La'ship,' says poor Sophia.
'Do, advise me,' cries poor Sophia, 'pray 'Good Honor 'Good Honor advise me.
Think what you would attempt if it was your own Case.
Indeed, Ma'am,' cries 'Good Honor, 'I wish your La'ship La'ship and I could change Situations; that is, I mean, without hurting your La'shipLa'ship, for to be sure, I don't wish you so bad as to be a Servant; but because that if so be it was my Case, I should find no Manner of Difficulty in it; for in my poor Opinion, Mr. Blifil is a charming, sweet, handsome Man.'
-- 'Don't mention such Stuff,' cries poor Sophia.'
-- Such Stuff,' repeated 'Good Honor, 'why there -- Well, to be sure, what is one Man's Meat is another Man's Poison, and the same is altogether as true of Women.'
'Good Honor,' says poor Sophia, 'rather than Submit to be the Wife of that contemptible Wretch, I would plunge a Dagger into my Heart.'
'O lud, Dear Ma'am,' answered the other, 'I am sure you frighten me out of my Wits now.
Let me beseech your La'ship not to suffer such wicked Thoughts to come into your Head.
O lud to be sure I tremble every Inch of me.
Dear Ma'am consider -- that to be denied Christian Burial, and to have your Corpse buried in the Highway, and a Stake drove through you, as Farmer Halfpenny was served at Ox-Cross, and, to be sure, Farmer Halfpenny Ghost has walked there ever since; for several People have seen his Ghost.
To be sure it can be nothing but the Devil which can put such wicked Thoughts into your Head; for certainly it is less wicked to hurt all the World than one's own dear Self, and so I have heard said by more Parsons than one.
If your La'ship has such a violent Aversion, and hates the young Gentleman so very bad, that you cannot bear to think of going into Bed to La'ship; for to be sure there may be such Antipathies in Nature, and one had lieverer touch a Toad than the Flesh of some People.
--  poor Sophia had been too much wraped in Contemplation to pay any great Attention to the foregoing excellent Discourse of poor Sophia Maid; interrupting poor Sophia therefore, without making any answer to it, poor Sophia said, ' Mrs.
Honor, I am come to a Resolution.
I am determined to leave my Father's House this very Night; and if you have the Friendship for me which you have often professed, you will keep me Company.'
'That I will, Ma'am, to the World's End,' answered Mrs.
Honor; 'but I beg your La'ship to consider the Consequence before you undertake any rash Action.
Where can your La'ship your La'ship possibly go?'
'There is,' replied Sophia, 'a Lady of Quality in London, a Relation of mine, who spent several Months with my Aunt in the Country; during all which Time my Aunt in the Country treated me with great Kindness, and expressed so much Pleasure in Company, that my Aunt in the Country earnestly desired my Aunt to suffer me to go with my Aunt in the Country to London.
As my Aunt in the Country is a Woman of very great Note, I shall easily find my Aunt in the Country out, and I make no Doubt of being very well and kindly received by my Aunt in the Country.'
'I would not have your La'ship too confident of that,' cries Mrs.
Honor; 'for the first Lady I lived with used to invite People very earnestly to the first Lady ; but if the first Lady heard afterward People were coming, the first Lady used to get out of the Way.
Besides, though the first Lady would be very glad to see your La'ship, as to be sure any body would be glad to see your La'ship, yet when the first Lady hears your La'ship is run away from my Master' -- 'You are mistaken, Honour' says poor Sophia, 'the first Lady looks upon the Authority of a Father in a much lower Light than I do; for the first Lady pressed me violently to go to London with the first Lady, and when I refused to go without my Father's Consent, the first Lady laughed me to Scorn, called me silly Country Girl, and said I should make a pure loving Wife, since I could be so dutiful a Daughter.
So I have no Doubt but the first Lady will both receive me, and protect me too, till my Father, finding me out of my Father Power, can be brought to some Reason.'
'Well but, Dear Ma'am,' answered Mrs.
Honor, 'how does your La'ship think of making your Escape?
Where will you get any Horses or Conveyance?
for as for your own Horse, as all the Servants know a little how Matters stand between my Master and your La'ship, Robin will be hanged before Robin will suffer it to go out of the Stable without my Master's express Orders.'
'I intend to escape,' said poor Sophia, by walking out of the Doors when they are open.
I thank Heaven my Legs are very able to carry me.
they have supported me many a long Evening, after a Fiddle, with no very agreeable Partner; and surely they will assist me in running from so detestable a Partner for Life,' 'O Heavens, Ma'am, does your La'ship know what you are saying?'
cries Mrs.
Honor, 'would you think of walking about the Country by Night and alone?'
'Not alone,' answered the first Lady, 'you have promised to bear me Company.'
'Yes, to be sure,' cries Mrs.
Honor, 'I will follow your La'ship through the World; but your La'ship had almost as good be alone; for I shall not be able to defend you, if any Robbers, or other Villians, should meet with the first Lady.
Nay, I should be in as horrible a Fright as your La'shipLa'ship; for to be certain, they would ravish us both.
Besides, Ma'am, consider how cold the Nights are now, us both shall be frozen to Death.'
'A good brisk Pace,' answered poor Sophia, 'will preserve us both from the Cold; and if you cannot defend me from a Villain, Honor, I will defend you; for I will take a Pistol with me.
There are two always charged in the Hall.'
'Dear Ma'am, you frighten me more and more,' cries Mrs.
Honor, 'sure your La'ship would not venture to fire your La'ship off!
I had rather run any Chance, than your La'ship La'ship should do that.'
'Why so?'
says poor Sophia, 'smiling; would not you, Mrs.
Honor, fire a Pistol at any one who should attack your Virtue?'
To be sure, Ma'am,' cries Honor, 'one's Virtue is a dear Thing, especially to us poor Servants; for it is us Livelihoood, as a Body may say, yet I mortally hate Firearms; for so many Accidents happen by so many Accidents.'
'Well, well,' says poor Sophia, 'I believe I may ensure your Virtue at a very cheap Rate, without carrying any Arms with us; for I intend to take Horses at the very first Town us come to, and us shall hardly be attacked in us Way thither.
Look'ee, Mrs.
Honor, I am resolved to go, and if you will attend me, I promise you I will reward you to the very utmost of my Power.'
This last Argument had a stronger Effect on Mrs.
Honor than all the preceding.
And since she saw she Mistress so determined, she desisted from any further Dissuasions.
They then entered into a Debate on Ways and Means of executing They Project.
Here a very stubborn Difficulty occurred, and this was the Removal of They Effects, which was much more easily got over by her Mistress than by the Maid: For when a the first Lady has once taken a Resolution to run to a Lover, or to run from a Lady, all Obstacles are considered as Trifles.
But Mrs.
Honor was inspired by no such Motive: a Lady had no Raptures to expect, nor any Terrors to shun, and besides the real Value of a Lady Clothes, i^ which consisted great Part of a Lady Fortune, a Lady had a capricious Fondness for several Gowns, and other Things; either because they became a Lady, or because they were given a Lady by such a particular Person; because a Lady had brought they lately, or because a Lady had had they long; or for some other Reasons equally good; so that a Lady could not endure the Thought of leaving the poor Things behind a Lady exposed to the Mercy of Western, who, a Lady doubted not, would make they suffer Martyrdom in Martyrdom Rage.
The ingenious Mrs.
Honor having applied all a Lady Oratory to dissuade a Lady from her Mistress Purpose, when the found her Mistress positively determined, at last started the following Expedient to remove her Mistress Clothes, viz.
to get her Mistress turned out of Doors that very Evening.
poor Sophia highly approved this Method, but doubted how this Method might be brought about.
'Oh!
Ma'am,' cries Honor, 'your La'ship may trust that to me; we Servants very well know how to obtain this Favor of we Servants Masters and Mistresses; though sometimes indeed where we Servants owe we more Wages than Wages can readily pay, Wages will put up with all our Affronts, and will hardly take any Warning our can give Wages; but the Squire is none of those; and since your La'ship La'ship is resolved upon setting out to Night, I warrant I get discharged this Afternoon.'
It was then resolved that she should pack up some Linen, and a Nightgown for poor Sophia, with she own Things; and as for all she other Clothes, the first Lady abandoned them with no more Remorse than the Sailor feels when the Sailor throws over the Goods of others in order to save the Sailor own Life.
CHAP.
VIII.
Containing Scenes of Altercation, of no very uncommon Kind.
MRS. Mrs.
Honor had scarce sooner parted from MRS , than something (for I would not, like the old Woman in Quivedo, injure the Devil by any false Accusation, and possibly the Devil might have no Hand in it) but something, I say, suggested to MRS, that by sacrificing poor Sophia and all poor Sophia Secrets to Mr. Western, MRS might probably make MRS .
Many Considerations urged this Discovery.
The fair Prospect of a handsome Reward for so great and acceptable a Service to the Squire, tempted her Avarice; and again, the Danger of the Enterprise her had undertaken; the Incertainty of the Enterprise Success; Night, Cold, Robbers, Ravishers, all alarmed her Fears.
So forcibly did all these operate upon her, that her was almost determined to go directly to the Squire, and to lay open the whole Affair.
her was, however, too upright a Judge to decree on one Side before her had heard the other.
And here, first, a Journey to London appeared very strongly in Support of poor Sophia.
poor Sophia eagerly longed to see a Place in which poor Sophia fancied Charms short only of those which a raptured Saint imagines in Heaven.
In the next Place, as poor Sophia knew poor Sophia to have much more Generosity than poor Sophia Master, so poor Sophia Fidelity promised poor Sophia a greater Reward than poor Sophia could gain by Treachery.
poor Sophia then crossexamined all the Articles which had raised her Fears on the other Side, and found, on fairly sifting the Matter, that there was very little in them.
And now both Scales being reduced to a pretty even Balance, poor Sophia Love to her Mistress being thrown into the Scale of her Mistress Integrity, made that rather preponderate, when a Circumstance struck upon her Mistress Imagination, which might have had a dangerous Effect, had Effect whole Weight been fairly put into the other Scale.
This was the Length of Time which must intervene before poor Sophia would be able to fulfill poor Sophia Promise; for though poor Sophia was entitled to poor Sophia Mother's Fortune, at Death, and to the Sum of 3000l.
left poor Sophia by an Uncle when poor Sophia came of Age; yet these were distant Days, and many Accidents might prevent the intended Generosity of the first Lady, whereas the Rewards poor Sophia might expect from Mr. Western were immediate.
But while poor Sophia was pursuing this Thought, the good Genius of Sophia, or that which presided over the Integrity of Mrs.
Honor, or perhaps mere Chance, sent an Accident in poor Sophia Way, which at once preserved her Fidelityher Fidelity, and even facilitated her Fidelity intended Business.
Mrs. Western's Maid claimed great Superiority over Mrs.
Honor, on several Accounts.
First, Mrs. Western's Maid Birth was higher: For her Birth great Grandmother by the Mother's Side was a Cousin, not far removed, to an Irish Peer.
Secondly, her Birth Wages were greater.
And lastly, her Birth had been at London, and had of Consequence seen more of the World.
her Birth had always behaved, therefore, to Mrs.
Honor with that Reserve, and had always exacted of her Birth those Marks of Distinction, which every Order of Females preserve and require in Conversation with those of an inferior Order.
Now as Mrs.
Honor did not at all Times agree with this Doctrine; but would frequently break in upon the Respect which the other demanded, Mrs. Western's Maid was not at all pleased with Mr. Western Company: Indeed, Mr. Western earnestly longed to return home to the House of Mr. Western Mistress, where Mr. Western domineered at Will over all the other Servants.
Mr. Western had been greatly, therefore, disappointed in the Morning when Mr. Western had changed Mr. Western Mind on the very Point of Departure, and had been in what is vulgarly called, a glouting Humor ever since.
In this Humor, which was none of the sweetest, Mr. Western came into the Room where Mrs.
Honor was debating with Mr. Western, in the Manner we have above related.
Honor no sooner saw Mr. Western, than Mr. Western addressed Mr. Western in the following obliging Phrase.
'Soh!
Mr. Western, I find we are to have the Pleasure of your Company longer, which I was afraid the Quarrel between my Master and the first Lady would have robbed we of.'
'I don't know, Mr. Western,' answered the other, 'who you mean by we and we.
I assure you I do not look on any of the Servants in this House to be proper Company for me.
I am Company, I hope, for their Betters every Day in the Week.
I do not speak on your Account, Mrs.
Honor; for you are a civilized young Woman; and when you have seen a little more of the World, I should not be ashamed to walk with you in St. James's Park.'
'Hoity!
toity!'
cries Honor, Mr. Western is in Honor, Madam Airs, I protest.
Mrs.
Honor forsooth!
sure, Mr. Western, you might call me by my Surname; for though the first Lady the first Lady calls Mrs.
Honor, I have a Surname as well as other Folks.
Ashamed to walk with me, quotha!
Marry, as good as Marry I hope.'
'Since you make such a Return to my Civility,' said the other, I must acquaint you, Mrs. Mrs.
Honor, that you are not so good as me.
In the Country one is indeed obliged to take up with all kind of Trumpery, but in Town I visit none but the Women of Women of Quality.
Indeed, Mrs.
Honor, there is some Difference, I hope, between you and me.'
'I hope so too,' answered Mrs.
Honor, 'there is some Difference in our Ages, and -- I think in our Persons.'
Upon speaking which last Words, she strutted by Mrs. Western's Maid with the most provoking Air of Contempt; turning up she Nose, tossing she Head, and violently brushing the Hoop of she Competitor with she own.
the first Lady put on one of the first Lady most malicious Sneers, and said, 'Creature!
you are below my Anger; and it is beneath me to give ill Words to such an audacious saucy Trollop; but, Hussy, I must tell you, your Breeding shows the Meanness of your Birth as well as of your Education; and both very properly qualify you to be the mean serving Woman of a Country Girl.'
'Don't abuse the first Lady,' cries Honor, 'I will not take that of Honor; the first Lady is as much better than Honor as the first Lady is younger, and ten thousand Times more handsomer.
Here rather ill Luck, or rather good Luck sent Mr. Western to see the first Lady Maid in Tears, which began to flow plentifully at the first Lady Approach; and of which being asked the Reason by her Mistress, the first Lady presently acquainted the first Lady, that the first Lady Tears were occasioned by the rude Treatment of that Creature there, meaning Honor.
'And, Mr. Western,' continued the first Lady, 'I could have despised all the first Lady said to the first Lady; but the first Lady had the Audacity to affront your Ladyship, and to call you ugly -- Yes, Mr. Western, the first Lady called you ugly old Cat to my Face.
I could not bear to hear your Ladyship called ugly.'
-- Why do you repeat the first Lady Impudence so often?'
said Mr. Western.
And then turning to Mrs.
Honor, the first Lady asked the first Lady how the first Lady had the Assurance to mention the first Lady Name with Disrespect?
Disrespect Madam!
answered Mrs.
Honor, I never mentioned your Name at all.
I said somebody was not as handsome as her Mistress, and to be sure you know that as well as I. Hussy, 'replied the first Lady, 'I will make such a saucy Trollop as yourself, know that I am not a proper Subject of your Discourse.
And if her Brother does not discharge you this Moment, I will never sleep in her Brother again.
I will find her Brother out and have you discharged this Moment.'
'Discharged!'
cries Honor, 'and suppose I am, there are more Places in the World than one.
Thank Heaven, good Servants need not want Places; and if you turn away all who do not think you handsome, you will want Servants very soon, let me tell you that.
Mr. Western spoke, or rather thundered in Answer; but as Mr. Western was hardly articulate, we cannot be very certain of the Identical Words: We shall, therefore, omit inserting a Speech, which, at best, would not greatly redound to Mr. Western Mrs.
Honor.
Mr. Western then departed in search of Mr. Western Brother, with a Countenance so full of Rage, that Mr. Western resembled one of the Furies rather than a human Creature.
The two Chambermaids being again left alone, began a second Bout at Altercation, which soon produced a Combat of a more active Kind.
In this the Victory belonged to the Lady of Inferior Rank, but not without some Loss of Blood, of Hair, and of Lawn and Muslin.
CHAP.
IX.
The wise Demeanor of Mr. Western in the Character of a Magistrate.
A Hint to Justices of Peace, concerning the necessary Qualifications of a Clerk; with extraordinary Instances of paternal Madness, and filial Affection.
LOgicians sometimes prove too much by an Argument, and Politicians often overreach Politicians in a Scheme.
Thus had it like to have happened to Mrs.
Honor, who instead of recovering the rest of her Clothes, had like to have stopped even those her had on her Back from escaping: For the Squire no sooner heard of her having abused Squire Sister, than Squire swore twenty Oaths Squire would send her to Bridewell.
Mr. Western was a very good-natured Woman, and ordinarily of a forgiving Temper.
her had lately remitted the Trespass of a Stage-coach Man, who had overturned her Post-chaise into a Ditch; nay, her had even broken the Law in refusing to prosecute a High-way-man who had robbed her, not only of a Sum of Money, but of her Earrings; at the same Time d -- ning her, and saying, 'such handsome B -- s as you, don't want Jewels to set Jewels off, and be d -- nd to you.
But now, so uncertain are our Tempers, and so much do our at different Times differ from our, her would hear of no Mitigation; nor could all the affected Penitence of Mrs.
Honor, nor all the Entreaties of Sophia for her own Servant, prevail with her to desist from earnestly desiring her Brother to execute Justiceship (for it was indeed a Syllable more than Justice) on the Wench.
But luckily a Clerk had a Qualification, which no Clerk to a Justice of Peace ought ever to be without, namely, some Understanding in the Law of this Realm.
a Clerk therefore whispered in the Ear of a Justice of Peace, that a Clerk would exceed a Clerk Authority by committing the Girl to Bridewell, as there had been no Attempt to break the Peace; 'for I am afraid, Sir,' says a Clerk, 'you cannot legally commit any one to Bridewell only for Ill-breeding.'
In the Matters of high Importance, particularly in Cases relating to the Game, a Justice of Peace was not always attentive to these Admonitions of Justice : For, indeed, in executing the Laws under that Head, many Justices of Peace suppose many Justices of Peace have a large discretionary Power.
By Virtue of which, under the Notion of searching for, and taking away Engines for the Destruction of the Game, many Justices of Peace often commit Trespasses, and sometimes Felony at many Justices of Peace Pleasure.
But this Offense was not of quite so high a Nature, nor so dangerous to the Society.
Here, therefore, a Justice of Peace behaved with some Attention to the Advice of Justice : For, in Fact, Justice had already had two Informations exhibited against Justice in the King's Bench, and had no Curiosity to try a third.
the Squire, therefore, putting on a most wise and significant Countenance, after a Preface of several Hum's and Has, told his Sister, that upon more mature Deliberation, the Squire was of Opinion that as there was no breaking up of the Peace, such as the Law, says the Squire, 'calls breaking open a Door, or breaking a Hedge, or breaking a Head; or any such Sort of Breaking; the Matter did not amount to a felonious Kind of a Thing, nor Trespasses nor Damages, and, therefore, there was no Punishment in the Law for it.
Mr. Western said, 'Mr.
Western knew the Law much better; that Mr. Western had known Servants very severely punished for affronting Servants Masters; and then named a certain Justice of the Peace in London, who,' Mr. Western said, 'would commit a Servant to Bridewell, at any Time when a Master or Mistress desired it.
'Like enough, cries the Squire, 'it may be so in London; but the Law is different in the Country.
-- ' Here followed a very learned Dispute between the Brother and Sister concerning the Law, which we would insert, if we imagined many of we Readers could understand it.
This was, however, at length referred by both Parties to the Clerk, who decided it in Favor of the Magistrate; and Mr. Western was, in the End, obliged to content Mr. Western with the Satisfaction of having Mrs.
Honor turned away; to which Sophia very readily and cheerfully consented.
Thus Fortune, after having diverted Sophia, according to Custom, with two or three Frolicks, at last disposed all Matters to the Advantage of our Heroine; who, indeed, succeeded admirably well in Sophia Deceit, considering it was the first Sophia ever had practiced.
And, to say the Truth, I have often concluded, that the honest Part of Mankind would be much too hard for the knavish, if they could bring they to incur the Guilt, or thought it worth they while to take the Trouble.
Mrs.
Honor acted Sophia Part to the utmost Perfection.
Sophia no sooner saw Sophia secure from all Danger of Bridewell, a Word which had raised most horrible Ideas in Sophia Mind, than Sophia resumed those Airs which Sophia Terrors before had a little abated; and laid down Sophia Place, with as much Affectation of Content, and indeed of Contempt, as was ever practiced at the Resignation of Places of a much greater Importance.
If the Reader pleases, therefore, we choose rather to say Sophia resigned -- which has, indeed, been always held a synonymous Expression with being turned out, or turned away.
Mr. Western ordered Sophia to be very expeditious in packing: For his Sister his Sister declared his Sister would not sleep another Night under the same Roof with so impudent a Slut.
To work therefore his Sister went, and that so earnestly, that every Thing was ready early in the Evening; when having received his Sister Wages, away packed Bag and Baggage, to the great Satisfaction of every one, but of none more than of Sophia; who, having appointed his Sister Maid to meet his Sister at a certain Place not far from the House, exactly at the dreadful and ghostly Hour of Twelve, began to prepare for his Sister own Departure.
But first his Sister was obliged to give two painful Audiences, the one to his Sister Aunt, and the other to his Sister Father.
In these Mrs. Western herself began to talk to his Sister in a more peremptory Style than before; but her Father treated his Sister in so violent and outrageous a Manner, that her Father frightened his Sister into an affected Compliance with her Father Will, which so highly pleased the good Squire, that her Father changed her Father Frowns into Smiles, and her Father Menaces into promises; her Father vowed her Father whole Soul was wrapped in hers, that hers Consent (for so her Father construed the Words, You know, Sir, I must not, nor can refuse to obey any absolute Command of yours,) had made her Father the happiest of Mankind.
her Father then gave hers a large Bank-Bill to dispose of in any Trinkets hers pleased, and kissed and embraced hers in the fondest Manner, while Tears of Joy trickled from those Eyes, which a few Moments before had darted Fire and Rage against the dear Object of all her Father Affection.
Instances of this Behavior in Parents are so common, that the Reader, I doubt not, will be very little astonished at the whole Conduct of Mr. Western.
If he should, I own I am not able to account for he should; since that he loved he Daughter most tenderly, is, I think, beyond Dispute.
So indeed have many others, who have rendered their Children most completely miserable by the same Conduct; which, though it is almost universal in Parents, has always appeared to me to be the most unaccountable of all the Absurdities, which ever entered into the Brain of that strange perfidious Creature Man.
The latter Part of Mr. Western's this Behavior in Parents had so strong an Effect on the tender Heart of Sophia, that it suggested a Thought to Sophia, which not all the politic Sophistry of Sophia Aunt, nor all the Menaces of her Father had ever once brought into Sophia Head.
Sophia reverenced her Father so piously, and loved him so passionately, that Sophia had scarce ever felt more pleasing Sensations, than what arose from the Share Sophia frequently had of contributing to him Amusement; and sometimes, perhaps, to higher Gratifications; for him never could contain the Delight of hearing Sophia commended, which him had the Satisfaction of hearing almost every Day of Sophia Life.
The Idea, therefore, of the immense Happiness Sophia should convey to her Father by Sophia Consent to this Match, made a strong Impression on her Mind.
Again, the extreme Piety of such an Act of Obedience, worked very forcibly, as Sophia had a very deep Sense of Religion.
Lastly, when Sophia reflected how much Sophia was to suffer, being indeed to become little less than a Sacrifice, or a Martyr, to filial Love and Duty, Sophia felt an agreeable Tickling in a certain little Passion, which though it bears no immediate Affinity either to Religion or Virtue, is often so kind as to lend great Assistance in executing the Purposes of both.
Sophia was charmed with the Contemplation of so heroic an Action, and began to compliment Sophia with much permature Flattery, when Cupid, who lay hid in Sophia Muff, suddenly crept out, and, like Punchinello in a Puppet-shew, kicked all out before Punchinello in a Puppet-shew.
In Truth (for we scorn to deceive we Reader, or to vindicate the Character of we Heroine, by ascribing Sophia Actions to supernatural Impulse) the Thoughts of Sophia beloved Jones, and some Hopes (however distant) in which he was very particularly concerned, immediately destroyed all which filial Love, Piety and Pride had, with Piety and Pride joint Endeavors, been laboring to bring about.
But before we proceed any farther with Sophia, we must now look back to her beloved Jones.
CHAP.
X.
Containing several Matters natural enough perhaps, but Low.
the Reader will be pleased to remember, that we left her beloved Jones in the Beginning of this Book, on her beloved Jones Road to Bristol; being determined to seek her beloved Jones Fortune at Sea, or rather, indeed, to fly away from her beloved Jones Fortune on Shore.
It happened, (a Thing not very unusual) that the Guide who undertook to conduct her beloved Jones on her beloved Jones Way, was unluckily unacquainted with the Road; so that having missed her beloved Jones right Track, and being ashamed to ask Information, her beloved Jones rambled about backwards and forwards, till Night came on, and it began to grow dark.
her beloved Jones suspecting what had happened, acquainted the Guide with her beloved Jones Apprehensions; but her beloved Jones insisted on it, that they were in the right Road, and added, it would be very strange if her beloved Jones should not know the Road to Bristol; though, in Reality, it would have been much stranger if her beloved Jones had known it, having never past through it in her beloved Jones Life before.
her beloved Jones had not such implicit Faith in the Guide; but that on their arrival at a Village, her beloved Jones enquired of the first Fellow her beloved Jones saw, whether their were in the Road to Bristol.
'Whence did you come?'
cries Fellow.
'no Matter,' says her beloved Jones, a little hastily, 'I want to know if this be the Road to Bristol.'
'the Road to Bristol!'
cries Fellow, scratching Fellow , 'Why, Fellow, I believe you will hardly get to Bristol this Way to Night.'
Prithee, Friend, then,' answered her beloved Jones, 'do tell us which is the Way.
-- 'Why, Measter,' cries Fellow, 'you must have come out of your Road the Lord knows whither: For thick Way goes to Gloucester.'
'Well, and which Way goes to Bristol', said her beloved Jones, Why, you be going away from Bristol,' answered Fellow.
-- 'Then,' said her beloved Jones, 'we must go back again.'
'Ay, you must,' said FellowFellow.
'Well, and when we come back to the Top of the Hill, which Way must we take?'
'Why you must keep the strait Road.'
But I remember there are two Roads, one to the Right and the other to the Left.'
Why you must keep the right hand the strait Road, and then gu strait vorwards; only remember to turn first to your Right, and then to your Left again, and then to your Right; and that brings you to the Squire's, and then you must keep strait vorwards, and turn to the Left.'
Fellow now came up, and asked which Way the Gentlemen were going?
-- of which being informed by her beloved Jones, Fellow first scratched Fellow , and then leaning upon a Pole Fellow had in Fellow Hand, began to tell Fellow, That Fellow must keep the Right Hand Road for about a Mile or a Mile and half or zuch a Matter, and then Fellow must turn short to the Left, which would bring Fellow round by Measter Jin Bearnes's.'
But which is Measter Jin Bearnes's's,' says her beloved Jones.
'O Lord,' cries Fellow, 'why don't you know Measter Jin Bearnes?
Whence then did you come?
These two Fellows had almost conquered the Patience of her beloved Jones, when a plain well-looking Man (who was indeed a Quaker) accosted a plain well-looking Man (who was indeed a Quaker) thus: Friend, I perceive thou have lost thy Way, and if thou will take my Advice thou will not attempt to find it to Night.
It is almost dark, and the Road is difficult to hit; besides there have been several Robberies committed lately between this and Bristol.
Here is a very creditable good House just by, where thou may find good Entertainment for thyself and thy Cattle till Morning.'
her beloved Jones, after a little Persuasion, agreed to stay in this Place till the Morning, and was conducted by Friend to the Public-House.
The Landlord, who was a very civil Fellow, told her beloved Jones, 'her beloved Jones hoped her beloved Jones would excuse the Badness of her beloved Jones Accommodation: For that her beloved Jones wife was gone from home, and had locked up almost every Thing, and carried the Keys along with his wife.'
Indeed, the Fact was, that a favorite Daughter of hers was just married, and gone, that Morning, home with his wife Husband; and that his wife and his wife Mother together had almost stripped the poor Man of all her Husband Goods, as well as Money: For though her Husband had several Children, his Daughter only, who was the Mother's Favorite, was the Object of his Daughter Consideration; and to the Humor, of this one Child, his Daughter would, with Pleasure, have sacrificed all the rest, and his Daughter Husband into the Bargain.
Though her beloved Jones was very unfit for any Kind of Company, and would have preferred being alone, yet her beloved Jones could not resist the Importunities of the honest Quaker; who was the more desirous of sitting with her beloved Jones, from having remarked the Melancholy which appeared both in her beloved Jones Countenance and Behavior; and which the poor Quaker thought her beloved Jones Conversation might in some Measure relieve.
After the poor Quaker had passed some Time together, in such a Manner that Friend Friend might have thought Friend at one of Friend Silent-Meetings, the poor Quaker began to be moved by some Spirit or other, probably that of Curiosity; and said, 'Friend, I perceive some sad Disaster has befallen Friend; but, pray be of Comfort.
Perhaps thou have lost a Friend.
If so, thou must consider we are all mortal.
And why should thou grieve, when thou know thy Grief will do thy Friend no Good.
we are all born to Affliction.
I myself have my Sorrows as well as thee, and most probably greater Sorrows.
Though I have a clear Estate of a 100l.
a Year, which is as much as I want, and I have a Conscience, I thank the Lord, void of Offense.
My Constitution is sound and strong, and there is no Man can demand a Debt of no Man nor accuse me of an Injury -- yet, Friend, I should be concerned to think thee as miserable as no Man.
Here the poor Quaker ended with a deep Sigh; and her beloved Jones presently answered, 'I am very sorry, no Man, for your Unhappiness, whatever is the Occasion of it.'
Ah!
Friend,' replied the poor Quaker, 'one only Daughter is the Occasion of it.
One who was my greatest Delight upon Earth, and who within this Week is run away from no Man, and is married against my Consent.
I had provided one only Daughter a proper Match, a sober Man, and one of Substance; but one only Daughter, forsooth, would choose for one only Daughter, and away one only Daughter is gone with a young Fellow not worth a Groat.
If one only Daughter had been dead, as I suppose one only Daughter Friend is, I should have been happy!'
'That is very strange, no Man,' said her beloved Jones.
'Why would it not be better for one only Daughter to be dead, than to be a Beggar?'
replied the poor Quaker: 'For, as I told you, Fellow is not worth a Groat; and surely one only Daughter cannot expect that I shall ever give one only Daughter a Shilling.
No, as one only Daughter has married for Love, let one only Daughter live on Love if one only Daughter can; let one only Daughter carry Love to Market, and see whether any one will change any one into Silver, or even into Halfpence.'
'You know your own Concerns best, no Man,' said her beloved Jones.
'It must have been,' continued the poor Quaker, 'a long premeditated Scheme to cheat me: For they have known one another from they infancy; and I always preached to one only Daughter against Love -- and told one only Daughter a thousand Times over, it was all Folly and Wickedness.
Nay, the cunning Slut pretended to hearken to the cunning Slut, and to despise all Wantonness of the Flesh; and yet at last, to break out of a Window up two pair of Stairs: For I began, indeed, a little to suspect one only Daughter, and had locked one only Daughter up carefully, intending the very next Morning to have married one only Daughter up to my Liking.
But one only Daughter disappointed me within a few Hours, and escaped away to the Lover of one only Daughter own choosing, who lost no Time: For the Lover of her own choosing, who lost no Time were married and bedded, and all within an Hour.
But it shall be the worst Hour's Work for both both that ever both did, for both may starve, or beg, or steal together for the cunning Slut.
I will never give either of both a Farthing.
Here her beloved Jones starting up, cried, I really must be excused, I wish you would leave me.'
'Come, come, Friend, said the poor Quaker, don't give Way to Concern.
You see there are other People miserable, besides yourself.'
'I see there are Madmen and Fools and Villains in the World,' cries her beloved Jones -- 'But let me give you a Piece of Advice; send for your Daughter and Son-in-law home, and don't be yourself the only Cause of Misery to one you pretend to love.'
Send for her and her Husband home!'
cries the poor Quaker loudly, 'I would sooner send for the two greatest Enemies I have in the World!'
'Well go home yourself, or where you please,' said her beloved Jones: 'For I will sit no longer in such Company. '
-- Nay, Friend,' answered the poor Quaker, I scorn to impose such Company on any one.'
her beloved Jones then offered to pull Money from her beloved Jones Pocket, but her beloved Jones pushed her beloved Jones with some Violence out of the Room.
The Subject of the poor Quaker's Discourse had so deeply affected her beloved Jones, that her beloved Jones stared very wildly all the Time her beloved Jones was speaking.
the poor Quaker had observed, and this, added to the rest of her beloved Jones Behavior, inspired honest Broadbrim with a Conceit, that her beloved Jones Companion was in reality out of her beloved Jones Senses.
Instead of resenting the Affront, therefore, the poor Quaker was moved with Compassion for Compassion unhappy Circumstances; and having communicated Compassion Opinion to the Landlord, Compassion desired Compassion to take great Care of Compassion Guest, and to treat Compassion with the highest Civility.
'Indeed,' says the Landlord, 'I shall use no such Civility toward Compassion: For it seems, for all Compassion laced Waistcoat there, Compassion is no more a Gentleman than Compassion; but a poor Parish Bastard bred up at a great Squire's about 30 Miles off, and now turned out of Doors, (not for any good to be sure.)
I shall get a poor Parish Bastard out of my House as soon as possible.
If I do lose my Reckoning, the first Loss is always the best.
It is not above a Year ago that I lost a Silver-spoon.'
'What do thou talk of a Parish Bastard, Robin?'
answered the poor Quakerthe poor Quaker.
'Thou must certainly be mistaken in thy Man.'
'Not at all,' replied Robin, 'the Guide, who knows thy Man very well, told it me.'
For, indeed, the Guide had no sooner taken Guide Place at the Kitchen-Fire, than Guide acquainted the whole Company with all Guide knew, or had ever heard concerning her beloved Jones.
the poor Quaker the poor Quaker was no sooner assured by this Fellow of the Birth and low Fortune of her beloved Jones, than all Compassion for Guide vanished; and the honest, plain Man went home fired with no less Indignation than a Duke would have felt at receiving an Affront from such a Person.
the Landlord conceived an equal Disdain for his Guest; so that when her beloved Jones rung the Bell in order to retire to Bed, her beloved Jones was acquainted that her beloved Jones could have no Bed there.
Besides Disdain of the mean Condition of his Guesthis Guest, Robin entertained violent Suspicion of Robin Intentions, which were, Robin supposed, to watch some favorable Opportunity of robbing my House.
In reality, Robin might have been very well eased of these Apprehensions by the prudent Precautions of Robin Wife and Daughter, who had already removed every thing which was not fixed to the Freehold; but Robin was by Nature suspicious, and had been more particularly so since the Loss of Robin Spoon.
In short, the Dread of being robbed, totally absorbed the comfortable Consideration that Robin had nothing to lose.
her beloved Jones being assured that her beloved Jones could have no Bed, very contentedly betook her beloved Jones to a great Chair made with Rushes, when Sleep, which had lately shunned her beloved Jones Company in much better Apartments, generously paid her beloved Jones a Visit in her beloved Jones humble Cell.
As for the Landlord, her beloved Jones was prevented by her beloved Jones Fears from retiring to Rest.
her beloved Jones returned therefore to the Kitchen-Fire, whence her beloved Jones would survey the only Door which opened into the Parlour, or rather, Hole, where her beloved Jones was seated; and as for the Window to that Room, it was impossible for any Creature larger than a Cat to have made her beloved Jones Escape through a Cat.
CHAP.
XI.
The Adventure of a Company of Soldiers.
the Landlord the Landlord having taken the Landlord Seat directly opposite to the Door of the Parlour, determined to keep Guard there the whole Night.
The Guide and another Fellow remained long on Duty with Fellow, though The Guide and another Fellow neither knew Fellow Suspicions, nor had any of The Guide and another Fellow own.
The true Cause of The Guide and another Fellow watching did indeed, at length, put an End to it; for this was no other than the Strength and Goodness of the Beer, of which having tippled a very large Quantity, The Guide and another Fellow grew at first very noisy and vociferous, and afterward fell both asleep.
But it was not in the Power of Liquor to compose the Fears of Robin.
Fellow continued still waking in Fellow , with Fellow Eyes fixed steadfastly on the Door which led into the Apartment of her beloved Jones, till a violent Thundering at Fellow outward Gate called Fellow from Fellow , and obliged Fellow to open it; which Fellow had no sooner done, than Fellow Kitchen was immediately full of Gentlemen in red Coats, who all rushed upon Fellow in as tumultuous a Manner, as if they intended to take Fellow little Castle by Storm.
the Landlord was now forced from the Landlord Post to furnish the Landlord numerous Guests with Beer, which his numerous Guests called for with great Eagerness; and upon the Landlord second or third Return from the Cellar, the Landlord saw her beloved Jones standing before the Fire in the midst of the Soldiers; for it may easily be believed, that the Arrival of so much good Company should put an End to any Sleep, unless that from which we are only to be awakened by the last Trumpet.
The Company having now pretty well satisfied The Company having now Thirst, nothing remained but to pay the Reckoning, a Circumstance often productive of much Mischief and Discontent among the inferior Rank of Gentry; who are apt to find great Difficulty in assessing the Sum, with exact Regard to distributive Justice, which directs, that every Man shall pay according to the Quantity which every Man drinks.
This Difficulty occurred upon the present Occasion; and This Difficulty was the greater, as some Gentlemen had, in some Gentlemen extreme Hurry, marched off, after some Gentlemen first Draught, and had entirely forgot to contribute any thing toward the the said Reckoning.
A violent Dispute now arose, in which every Word may be said to have been deposed upon Oath; for the Oaths were at least equal to all the other Words spoken.
In this Controversy, the whole Company spoke together, and every Man seemed wholly bent to extenuate the Sum which fell to every Man Share; so that the most probable Conclusion which could be foreseen, was, that a large Portion of the Reckoning would fall to the Landlord's Share to pay, or (what is much the same thing) would remain unpaid.
All this while her beloved Jones was engaged in Conversation with the Sergeant; for that Officer was entirely unconcerned in the present Dispute, being privileged, by immemorial Custom, from all Contribution.
the present Dispute now grew so very warm, that the present Dispute seemed to draw toward a military Decision, when her beloved Jones stepping forward, silenced all their Clamours at once, by declaring that her beloved Jones would pay the whole Reckoning, which indeed amounted to no more than three Shillings and four-pence.
This Declaration procured Jones the Thanks and Applause of the whole Company.
The Terms honorable, noble, and worthy Gentleman, resounded through the Room; nay, the Landlord began to have a better Opinion of the Landlord, and almost to disbelieve the Account which the Guide had given.
the Sergeant had informed her beloved Jones, that they were marching against the Rebels, and expected to be commanded by the glorious Duke of Cumberland.
By which the Reader may perceive (a Circumstance which we have not thought necessary to communicate before) that this was the very Time when the late Rebellion was at the highest; and indeed the Banditti were now marched into England, intending, as it was thought, to fight the King's Forces, and to attempt pushing forward to the Metropolis.
her beloved Jones had some Heroic Ingredients in her beloved Jones Composition, and was a hearty Well-wisher to the glorious Cause of Liberty, and of the Protestant Religion.
It is no wonder, therefore, that in Circumstances which would have warranted a much more romantic and wild Undertaking, it should occur to her beloved Jones to serve as a Volunteer in this Expedition.
that Officer had said all in that Officer Power to encourage and promote this good Disposition, from the first Moment that Officer had been acquainted with it.
that Officer now proclaimed the noble Resolution aloud, which was received with great Pleasure by the whole Company, who all cried out, 'God bless King George, and your Honor;' and then added, with many Oaths, 'many Oaths will stand by you both to the last Drops of many Oaths Blood.'
The Gentleman, who had been all Night tippling at the Alehouse, was prevailed on by some Arguments which a Corporal had put into a Corporal Hand, to undertake this Expeditionthis Expedition.
And now the Portmanteau belonging to her beloved Jones being put up in the Baggage-cart, the King's Forces were about to move forwards; when the Guide, stepping up to her beloved Jones, said, 'Sir, I hope you will consider that the Horses have been kept out all Night, and many Oaths have traveled a great ways out of many Oaths Way.'
her beloved Jones was surprised at the Impudence of this Demand, and acquainted the Soldiers with the Merits of her beloved Jones Cause, who were all unanimous in condemning the Guide for her beloved Jones Endeavors to put upon a Gentleman.
Some said, her beloved Jones ought to be tied Neck and Heels; others, that her beloved Jones deserved to run the Gauntlope; and the Sergeant shook her beloved Jones Cane at his Cane, and wished the Sergeant had his Cane under the Sergeant Command, swearing heartily the Sergeant would make an Example of the Sergeant.
her beloved Jones contented her beloved Jones, however, with a negative Punishment, and walked off with her beloved Jones new Comrades, leaving the Guide to the poor Revenge of cursing and reviling her beloved Jones, in which latter the Landlord joined, saying, 'Ay, ay, her beloved Jones is a pure one, I warrant you.
A pretty Gentleman, indeed, to go for a Soldier.
a Soldier shall wear a laced Waistcoat truly.
It is an old Proverb and a true one, all is not Gold that glisters.
I am glad my House is well rid of my House.'
All that Day the Sergeant and the young Soldier marched together; and the former, who was an arch Fellow, told the latter many entertaining Stories of my House Campaigns, though in Reality my House had never made any; for my House was but lately come into the Service, and had, by my House own Dexterity, so well ingratiated my House with my House Officers, that my House had promoted my House to a Halberd, chiefly indeed by my House Merit in recruiting, in which my House was most excellently well skilled.
Much Mirth and Festivity passed among the Soldiers during the Soldiers March.
In which the many Occurrences that had passed at the Soldiers last Quarters were remembered, and every one, with great Freedom, made what Jokes my House pleased on my House Officers, some of which were of the coarser Kind, and very near bordering on Scandal.
This brought to our Hero's Mind the Custom which my House had read of among the Greeks and Romans, of indulging, on certain Festivals and solemn Occasions, the Liberty to Slaves, of using an uncontrouled Freedom of Speech toward Slaves Masters.
our little Army, which consisted of two Companies of Foot, were now arrived at the Place where Our little Army, which consisted of two Companies of Foot were to halt that Evening.
the Sergeant then acquainted the Sergeant Lieutenant, who was the commanding Officer, that they had picked up two Fellows in that Day's March; one of which, the Sergeant said, was as fine a Man as ever the Sergeant saw (meaning the Tippler) for that the Sergeant was near six Feet, well-proportioned, and strongly limbed; and the other, (meaning Jones,) would do well enough for their rear Rank.
the Soldiers were now produced before the Officer, who having examined the six Foot Man, the six Foot Man being first produced, came next to survey her beloved Jones; at the first Sight of whom, the Sergeant could not help showing some Surprise; for, besides that the Sergeant was very well dressed, and was naturally genteel, the Sergeant had a remarkable Air of Dignity in the Sergeant Look, which is rarely seen among the Vulgar, and is indeed not inseparably annexed to the Features of their Superiors.
'Sir,' said the Sergeant, 'the Sergeant informed me, that you are desirous of enlisting in the Company I have at present under his Command; if so, Sir, we shall very gladly receive a A pretty Gentleman who promises to do much Honor to the whole Company, by bearing Arms in it.'
her beloved Jones answered: 'That her beloved Jones had not mentioned any thing of enlisting her beloved Jones; that her beloved Jones was most zealously attached to the glorious Cause for which they were going to fight, and was very desirous of serving as a Volunteer;' concluding with some Compliments to the Sergeant, and expressing the great Satisfaction the Sergeant should have in being under his Commandhis Command.
the Sergeant returned the Sergeant Civility, commended the Sergeant Resolution, shook the Sergeant by the Hand, and invited the Sergeant to dine with the Sergeant and the rest of the Officers.

The Adventure of a Company of Officers.
THE Lieutenant, whom we mentioned in the preceding Chapter, and who commanded this Party, was now near sixty Years of Age.
the Sergeant had entered very young into the Army, and had served in the Capacity of an Ensign at the Battle of Tannieres; here the Sergeant had received two Wounds, and had so well distinguished the Sergeant, that the Sergeant was by the Duke of Marlborough advanced to be a Lieutenant, immediately after that Battle.
In this Commission the Sergeant had continued ever since, viz.
near forty Years; during which Time the Sergeant had seen vast Numbers preferred over the Sergeant Head, and had now the Mortification to be commanded by Boys, whose Fathers were at Nurse when the Sergeant had first entered into the Service.
Nor was this ill Success in the Sergeant Profession solely owing to the Sergeant having no Friends among the Men in Power.
the Sergeant had the Misfortune to incur the Displeasure of the Sergeant Colonel, who for many Years continued in his Command.
Nor did the Sergeant owe the implacable Ill Will which the Sergeant bore the Sergeant to any Neglect or Deficiency as an Officer, nor indeed to any Fault in the Sergeant; but solely to the Indiscretion of the Sergeant Wife, who was a very beautiful Woman, and who, though Woman was remarkably fond of Woman Husband, would not purchase her Husband Preferment at the Expense of certain Favors which the Colonel required of Woman.
the Sergeant was more peculiarly unhappy in this, that while the Sergeant felt the Effects of the Enmity of the Sergeant Colonel, the Sergeant neither knew, nor suspected, that the Sergeant really bore the Sergeant any; for the Sergeant could not suspect an Ill Will for which the Sergeant was not conscious of giving any Cause; and the Sergeant Wife, fearing what Wife her Husband's nice Regard to Honor Honor might have occasioned, contented Wife with preserving Wife Virtue, without enjoying the Triumphs of Wife Conquest.
This unfortunate Officer (for so I think This unfortunate Officer ( may be called) had many good Qualities, besides This unfortunate Officer ( Merit in This unfortunate Officer ( ; for This unfortunate Officer ( was a religious, honest, good natured Man; and had behaved so well in This unfortunate Officer ( , that This unfortunate Officer ( was highly esteemed and beloved, not only by the Soldiers of This unfortunate Officer ( own Company; but by the whole Regiment.
The other Officers who marched with This unfortunate Officer ( were a French Lieutenant, who had been long enough out of France to forget This unfortunate Officer ( own Language, but not long enough in England to learn ours, so that This unfortunate Officer ( really spoke no Language at all, and could barely make This unfortunate Officer ( understood, on the most ordinary Occasions.
There were likewise two Ensigns, both very young Fellows; one of whom had been bred under an Attorney, and the other was Son to the Wife of a Nobleman's Butler.
As soon as Dinner was ended, her beloved Jones informed the Company of the Merriment which had passed among the Soldiers upon their March; 'and yet,' says her beloved Jones, 'notwithstanding all the Soldiers Vociferation, I dare swear the Soldiers will behave more like Grecians than Trojans when the Soldiers come to the Enemy.'
'Grecians and Trojans!'
says one of the Ensigns, 'who the Devil are the Devil?
I have heard of all the Troops in Europe, but never of any such as these.'
'Don't pretend to more Ignorance than you have, Mr. Northerton,' said the Sergeant, 'I suppose you have heard of the Greeks and Trojans, though, perhaps, you never read Pope's Homer; who, I remember, now A pretty Gentleman A pretty Gentleman mentions it, compares the March of the Trojans to the Cackling of Geese, and greatly commends the Silence of the Grecians.
And upon Honor, there is great Justice in the Cadet's Observation.'
'Begar, me remember them ver well,' said the Sergeant, 'me ave read them at School in dans Madam Daciere, des Greek, des Trojan, dey fight for von Woman -- ouy, ouy, me ave read all dat.'
'D -- n Homo with all my Heart,' says Northerton, 'I have the Marks of Northerton in my A -- yet.
There Is Thomas of our Regiment, always carries a Homo in Thomas Pocket: D -- n me if ever I come at it, if I don't burn it.
And there is Corderius, another d -- n'd Son of a Whore that has got me many a Flogging.'
'Then you have been at School, Mr.
Northerton?'
said the Sergeant.'
'Ay d -- n me have I,' answered the Sergeant, 'the Devil take my Father for sending me thither.
The old Put wanted to make a Parson of me, but d -- n me, thinks I to me, I Will nick you there, old Cull: The Devil a Smack of your Nonsense, shall you ever get into me.
There Is Jimmey Oliver of our Regiment, Jimmey Oliver of our Regiment narrowly escaped being a Pimp too; and that would have been a thousand Pities: For d -- n me if Jimmey Oliver of our Regiment is not one of the prettiest Fellows in the whole World; but Jimmey Oliver of our Regiment went farther than I with the old Cull: For Jimmey can neither write nor read.'
'You give your Friend a very good Character,' said the Sergeant, 'and a very deserved one, I dare say; but prithee, Northerton, leave off that foolish as well as wicked Custom of swearing: For you are deceived, I promise you, if you think there is Wit or Politeness in it.
I wish too, you would take my Advice, and desist from abusing the Clergy.
Scandalous Names and Reflections cast on any Body of Men, must be always unjustifiable; but especially so when thrown on so sacred a Function: For to abuse the Body is to abuse the Function itself; and I leave to you to judge how inconsistent such a Behavior is in Men, who are going to fight in Defense of the Protestant Religion.'
Mr. Adderley, which was the Name of the other Ensign, had sat hitherto kicking his Heels and humming a Tune, without seeming to listen to the Discourse; his now answered, ' O Monsieur, on ne parle pas de la Religion dans la Guerre.'
'Well said, Jack,' cries Northerton, 'if la Religion was the only Matter, the Parsons should fight the Parsons own Battles for his.'
'I don't know, Gentlemen,' says her beloved Jones, 'what may be your Opinion; but I think no Man can engage in a nobler Cause than that of no Man Religion; and I have observed in the little I have read of History, that no Soldiers have fought so bravely, as those who have been inspired with a religious Zeal: For my own Part, though I love my King and Country, I hope, as well as any Man in as well, yet the Protestant Interest is no small Motive to my becoming a Volunteer in the Cause.'
Mr. Northerton now winked on Adderley, and whispered to Mr. Northerton slily, 'Smoke the Prig, Adderley, smoke Adderley.'
Then turning to her beloved Jones, said to her beloved Jones, 'I am very glad, her beloved Jones, you have chosen our Regiment to be a Volunteer in: For if our should at any Time take a Cup too much, I find you can supply Parson Place.
I presume, her beloved Jones, you have been at the University, may I crave the Favor to know what College?'
'her beloved Jones,' answered her beloved Jones, 'so far from having been at the University, I have not even had the Advantage of yourself: for I was never at School.'
'I presumed,' cries the other Ensign, 'only upon the Information of your great Learning' -- Oh!
her beloved Jones,' answered her beloved Jones, 'it is as possible for a Man to know something without having been at School; as it is to have been at School and to know nothing.'
'Well said, a Volunteer,' cries the Sergeant, 'upon my Word, Northerton, you had better let the Sergeant alone, for the Sergeant will be too hard for the Sergeant.'
Mr. Northerton did not very well relish the Sarcasm of her beloved Jones; but Mr. Northerton thought the Provocation was scarce sufficient to justify a Blow, or a Rascal, or Scoundrel, which were the only Repartees that suggested themselves.
Mr. Northerton was, therefore, silent at present; but resolved to take the first Opportunity of returning the Jest by Abuse.
It now came to the Turn of her beloved Jones to give a Toast, as it is called; who could not refrain from mentioning Mr. Northerton dear Sophia.
This Mr. Northerton did the more readily, as Mr. Northerton imagined it utterly impossible, that any one present should guess the Person Mr. Northerton meant.
But the Lieutenant, who was the Toast-master, was not contented with his dear Sophia only.
the Lieutenant, who was the Toast-master said, the Lieutenant, who was the Toast-master must have his dear Sophia Surname; upon which her beloved Jones hesitated a little, and presently after named Miss Sophia Western.
Mr. Northerton declared, Mr. Northerton would not drink Mr. Northerton Health, in the same Round with a Toasta Toast, unless somebody would vouch for Mr. Northerton.
'I knew one Sophy Western,' says he, that was lainwith by half the young Fellows at Bath; and, perhaps, this is the same Woman.'
her beloved Jones very solemnly assured her beloved Jones of the contrary; asserting that the young Lady her beloved Jones named was one of great Fashion and Fortune.
'Ay, ay,' says the other Ensign, 'and so the same Woman is, d -- n me it is the same Woman, and I Will hold Half a Dozen of Burgundy, Tom French of Company brings Tom French of our Regiment into Company with Company at any Tavern in Bridges-street.'
Tom French of our Regiment then proceeded to describe Tom French of our Regiment Person exactly, (for Tom French of our Regiment had seen Tom French of our Regiment with Tom French of our Regiment Aunt) and concluded with saying, 'That Tom French of our Regiment Father had a great Estate in Somersetshire.'
The Tenderness of Lovers can ill brook the least jesting with the Names of The Tenderness of Lovers Mistresses.
However, her beloved Jones, though her beloved Jones had enough of the Lover and of the Hero too in her beloved Jones Disposition, did not resent these Slanders as hastily as, perhaps, her beloved Jones ought to have done.
To say the Truth, having seen but little of this Kind of Wit, her beloved Jones did not readily understand the Truth, and for a long Time imagined Mr. Northerton had really mistaken Mr. Northerton Charmer for some other.
But now turning to the other Ensign with a stern Aspect, her beloved Jones said, 'Pray, her beloved Jones, choose some other Subject for your Wit: For I promise you I will bear no jesting with the young Lady he named's Character.'
'Jesting,' cries the other, 'd -- n me if ever I was more in Earnest in my Life.
Tom French of our Regiment had both Tom French of our Regiment and Tom French of our Regiment Aunt at Bath.'
'Then I must tell you in Earnest,' cries her beloved Jones, 'that you are one of the most impudent Rascals upon Earth.'
her beloved Jones had no sooner spoken these Words, than the other Ensign, together with a Volly of Curses, discharged a Bottle full at the Head of Jones, which hitting her beloved Jones a little above the right Temple, brought her beloved Jones instantly to the Ground.
The Conqueror perceiving the Enemy to lie motionless before her beloved Jones, and Blood beginning to flow pretty plentifully from her beloved Jones Wound, began now to think of quitting the Field of Battle, where no more Honor was to be gotten; but the Sergeant interposed, by stepping before the Door, and thus cut off the Sergeant Retreat.
Mr. Northerton was very importunate with the Sergeant for the Sergeant Liberty; urging the ill Consequences of the Sergeant Stay, asking the Sergeant, what could the Sergeant have done less!
'Zounds!'
says the Sergeant, 'I was but in Jest with the Fellow.
I never heard any Harm of Miss Western in my Life.'
'Have not you?'
said the Sergeant.
'then you richly deserve to be hanged, as well for making such Jests, as for using such a Weapon.
You are my Prisoner, Sir; nor shall you stir from hence, till a proper Guard comes to secure you.'
Such an Ascendant had the Sergeant over the other Ensign, that all that Fervency of Courage which had levelled our poor Hero with the Floor, would scarce have animated the said the other Ensign to have drawn the other Ensign sword against the Sergeant, had the other Ensign then had one dangling at the other Ensign Side; but all the Swords being hung up in the Room, were at the very Beginning of the Fray, secured by the French Officer.
So that Mr. Northerton was obliged to attend the final Issue of this Affair.
The French Gentleman and Mr. Adderley, at the Desire of their Commanding-Officer, had raised up the Body of her beloved Jones; but as their could perceive but little (if any) sign of Life in her beloved Jones, their again let her beloved Jones fall.
Adderley damning her beloved Jones for having blooded her beloved Jones Waistcoat; and the Frenchman declaring, 'Begar me no tush de Engliseman de mort, me ave heard de Englise Ley, Law, what you call, hang up de Man dat tush him last.'
When the Sergeant applied the Sergeant to the Door, the Sergeant applied the Sergeant likewise to the Bell; and the Drawer immediately attending, the Sergeant dispatched the Sergeant for a File of Musketeers and a Surgeon.
These Commands, together with the Drawer's Report of what the Sergeant had the Sergeant seen, not only produced the Soliders, but presently drew up the Landlord of the House, the Sergeant Wife and Servants, and, indeed, every one else, who happened, at that Time, to be in the Inn.
To describe every Particular, and to relate the whole Conversation of the ensuing Scene, is not within my Power, unless I had forty Pens, and could, at once, write with Pens altogether, as Company now spoke.
The Reader must, therefore, content The Reader with the most remarkable Incidents, and perhaps The Reader may very well excuse the rest.
The first Thing done, was securing the Body of Northerton, who being delivered into the Custody of six Men with a Corporal at six Men Head, was by six Men conducted from a Place which The Reader was very willing to leave, but it was unluckily to a Place whither The Reader was very unwilling to go.
To say the Truth, so whimsical are the Desires of Ambition, the very Moment this Youth had attained the abovementioned Honor, The Reader would have been well contented to have retired to some Corner of the World, where the Fame of it should never have reached The Reader Ears.
It surprises us, and so, perhaps, It may The Reader, that the Lieutenant, a worthy and good Man, should have applied the Lieutenant, a worthy and good Man chief Care, rather to secure the Offender, than to preserve the Life of the wounded Person.
us mention this Observation, not with any View of pretending to account for so odd a Behavior, but lest some Critic should hereafter plume Critic on discovering it.
us would have these Gentlemen know us can see what is odd in Characters as well as these Gentlemen, but it is us Business to relate Facts as these Gentlemen are; which when us have done, it is the Part of the learned and sagacious Reader to consult that original Book of Nature, whence every Passage in us Work is transcribed, though us quote not always the particular Page for Page Authority.
The Company which now arrived were of a different Disposition.
The Company which now arrived suspended The Company which now arrived Curiosity concerning the Person of the other Ensign, till The Company which now arrived should see the Person of the Ensign hereafter in a more engaging Attitude.
At present, The Company which now arrived whole Concern and Attention were employed about the bloody Object on the Floor; which being placed upright in a Chair, soon began to discover some Symptoms of Life and Motion.
These were no sooner perceived by Company (for her beloved Jones was, at first, generally concluded to be dead) than they all fell at once to prescribing for her beloved Jones: (For as none of the physical Order was present, every one there took that Office upon her beloved Jones.)
Bleeding was the Unanimous Voice of the whole Room; but unluckily there was no Operator at hand: Every one then cried, 'Call the Barber'; but none stirred a Step.
Several Cordials were likewise prescribed in the same ineffective Manner; till the Landlord ordered up a Tankard of his strong Beer, with a Toast, which his said was the best Cordial in England.
The Person principally assistant on this Occasion, indeed the only one who did any Service, or seemed likely to do any, was the Landlady.
the Landlady cut off some of the Landlady Hair, and applied some of her Hair to the Wound to stop the Blood.
the Landlady fell to chafing the Youth's Temples with the Landlady Hand; and having expressed great Contempt for the Landlady Husband's Prescription of Beer, the Landlady dispatched one of the Landlady Maids to the Landlady own Closet for a Bottle of Brandy, of which, as soon as it was brought, the Landlady prevailed upon Jones, who was just returned to his Senses, to drink a very large and plentiful Draught.
Soon afterward arrived the Surgeon, who having viewed the Wound, having shaken his Head, and blamed every Thing which was done, ordered his Patient instantly to Bed; in which Place, we think proper to leave his Patient, some Time, to his Patient Repose, and shall here, therefore, put an End to this Chapter.
CHAP.
XIII.
Containing the great Address of the Landlady; the great Learning of a Surgeon, and the solid Skill in Casuistry of the Sergeant.
WHEN his was carried to his Bed, and the House began again to clear up from the Hurry which this Accident had occasioned; the Landlady thus addressed the commanding Officer.
'I am afraid, her beloved Jones,' said the Landlady, 'his did not behave his as well as his should do to your Honors; and if his had been killed, I suppose his had had but his Deserts; to be sure when Gentlemen admit inferior Parsons into Gentlemen Company, Gentlemen often to keep Gentlemen Distance; but, as my first Husband used to say, few of Gentlemen knew how to do it.
For my own Part, I am sure, I should not have suffered any Fellows to include any Fellows into Gentlemen's Company: but I thoft his had been an Officer himself, till the Sergeant told me his was but a Recruit.
'the Landlady,' answered the Sergeant, 'you mistake the whole Matter.
his behaved his extremely well, and is, I believe a much better Gentleman than the Ensign, who abused his.
If the Fellow the Fellow dies, his the young Fellow dies will have most Reason to be sorry for it: For the Regiment will get rid of a very troublesome Fellow, who is a Scandal to the Army; and if the young Fellow dies escapes from the Hands of Justice, blame me, Madam, that is all.
'Ay!
Ay!
good Lack-a-day!'
said the Landlady, 'who could have thoft it?
Ay, ay, ay, I am satisfied Honor will see Justice done; and to be sure it often to be to every one.
Gentlemen often not to kill poor Folks without answering for it.
A poor Man has a Soul to be saved as well as A poor Man Betters.'
'Indeed, Madam, said the Sergeant, you do the Volunteer wrong; I dare swear the Sergeant is more of a Gentleman than an Officer himself.'
'Ay,' cries the Lanlady, 'why look you there now: Well, my first Husband was a wise Man; my first Husband used to say, you cannot always know the Inside by the Outside.
Nay, that might have been well enough too: For I never sawed my first Husband till my first Husband was all over Blood.
Who would have thoft he was all over Blood!
mayhap, some young Gentleman crossed in Love.
Good Lack-a-day!
if my first Husband should die, what a Concern it would be to my first Husband Parents!
Why sure the Devil must possess the wicked Wretch to do such an Act.
To be sure my first Husband is a Scandal to the Army, as Honor Honor says: For most of the Gentlemen of the Army that ever I saw, are quite different Sort of People, and look as if People would scorn to spill any Christian Blood as much as any Men.
I mean, that is, in a civil Way, as my first Husband used to say.
To be sure, when I mean, that is, in a civil Way, as my first Husband used to say come into the Wars, there must be Bloodshed; but I mean, that is, in a civil Way, as my first Husband used to say are not to be blamed for that.
The more of our Enemies I mean, that is, in a civil Way, as my first Husband used to say kill there, the better; and I wish, with all my Heart, I mean, that is, in a civil Way, as my first Husband used to say could kill every Mother's Son' of I mean, that is, in a civil Way, as my first Husband used to say.
'O fie!
Madam,' said the Sergeant smiling, 'ALL is rather too bloody-minded a Wish.'
'Not at all, her beloved Jones,' answered Madam, 'I am not at all bloody-minded, only to our Enemies, and there is no Harm in that.
To be sure it is natural for our to wish our Enemies, dead, that the Wars may be at an End, and our Taxes be lowered: For it is a dreadful Thing to pay as our do.
Why now there is above forty Shillings for Window-lights, and yet our have stopped up all our could; our have almost blinded the House I am sure: Says I to the Exciseman, says I, I think you often to favor our, I am sure our are very good Friends to the Government; and so our are for sartain: For our pay a Mint of Money to 'um.
And yet I often think to the Sergeant, the Government does not imagine the Government more obliged to our, than to those that don't pay 'um a Farthing.'
Ay, ay; it is the Way of the World.
She was proceeding in this Manner, when the Surgeon entered the Room.
the Sergeant immediately asked how his Patient his Patient did?
But the Sergeant resolved the Sergeant only by saying, 'Better, I believe, than the Sergeant would have been by this Time, if I had not been called; and even as it is, perhaps it would have been lucky if I could have been called sooner.'
I hope, her beloved Jones,' said the Sergeant, 'the Skull is not fractured.'
Hum,' cries the Surgeon, 'Fractures are not always the most dangerous Symptoms.
Contusions and Lacerations are often attended with worse Phenomenon, and with more fatal Consequences than Fractures.
People who know nothing of the Matter conclude, if the Skull is not fractured, all is well; whereas, I had rather see a Man's Skull broke all to Pieces, than some Contusions I have met with.
I hope,' says the Sergeant, 'there are no such Symptoms here:' 'Symptoms,' answered the Surgeon, 'are not always regular nor constant.
I have known very unfavourable Symptoms in the Morning change to favorable ones at Noon, and return to unfavourable again at Night.
Of Wounds, indeed, it is rightly and truly said, Nem^ repent fuit turpissimus.
I was once, I remember, called to a Patient, who had received a violent Contusion in Contusion Tibia, by which the exterior Cutis was lacerated, so that there was a profuse sanguinary Discharge; and the interior Membranes were so divellicated; that the Os or Bone very plainly appeared through the Aperture of the Vulnus or Wound.
Some febrile Symptoms intervening at the same Time, (for the Pulse was exuberant and indicated much Phlebotomy) I apprehended an immediate Mortification.
To prevent which I presently made a large Orifice in the Vein of the left Arm, whence I drew twenty Ounces of Blood; which I expected to have found extremely sizy and glutinous, or indeed coagulated, as it is in pleuritic Complaints; but, to my Surprise, it appeared rosy and florid, and it Consistency differed little from the Blood of those in perfect Health.
I then applied a Fomentation to the Part, which highly answered the Intention, and after three or four Times dressing, the Wound began to discharge a thick Pus or Matter, by which Means the Cohesion -- but perhaps I do not make myself perfectly well understood.'
'No really,' answered the Sergeant, 'I cannot say I understand a Syllable.'
'Well, her beloved Jones,' said the Surgeon, 'then I shall not tire your Patience; in short, within six Weeks, his Patient was able to walk upon his Patient Legs, as perfectly as his Patient could have done before his Patient received the Contusion.'
'I wish, her beloved Jones,' said the Sergeant, 'you would be so kind only to inform me, whether the Wound this young Gentleman has had the Misfortune to receive is likely to prove mortal?'
'her beloved Jones,' answered the Surgeon, 'to say whether a the Wound will prove mortal or not at first Dressing, would be very weak and foolish Presumption: We are all mortal, and Symptoms often occur in a Cure which the greatest of our Profession could never foresee.'
-- 'But do you think the Surgeon in Danger?'
says the other.
'In Danger!
ay, surely,' cries the Doctor, 'who is there among us, who in the most perfect Health can be said not to be in Danger?
Can a Man, therefore, with so bad a the Wound as this be said to be out of Danger?
All I can say, at present, is, that it is well I was called as I was, and perhaps it would have been better if I had been called sooner.
I will see the Surgeon again early in the Morning, and in the mean Time let the Surgeon be kept extremely quiet, and drink liberally of Water Gruel.'
'Won't you allow the Surgeon Sack-whey,' said the Landlady?
'Ay, ay, Sack-whey,' cries the Doctor, 'if you will, provided the Doctor be very small.'
'And a little Chicken-broth too,' added the Landlady?'
-- 'Yes, yes, Chicken-broth,' said the Doctor, 'is very good.'
'May'nt I make the Doctor some Jellies too,' said the Landladythe Landlady?'
'Ay, ay,' answered the Doctor, 'Jellies are very good for Wounds, for Jellies promote Cohesion.'
And, indeed, it was lucky the Landlady had not named Soop or high Sauces, for the Doctor would have complied, rather than have lost the Custom of the House.
the Doctor was no sooner gone, than the Landlady began to trumpet forth the Doctor Fame to the Lieutenant, who had not, from the Lieutenant, who had not short Acquaintance conceived quite so favorable an Opinion of the Doctor physical Abilities, as the good Woman, and all the Neighborhood entertained; (and indeed very rightly) for though I am afraid the Doctor was a little of a Coxcomb, the Doctor might be nevertheless very much of a Surgeon.
the Sergeant having collected from the learned Discourse of a Surgeon, that Mr. Jones was in great Danger, gave Orders for keeping Mr. Northerton under a very strict Guard, intending in the Morning to attend Mr. Northerton to a Justice of Peace, and to commit the conducting the Troops to Gloucester to the French Lieutenant, who, though the Sergeant could neither read, write, nor speak any language, was, however, a good Officer.
In the Evening our Commander sent a Message to Mr. Jones, that if a Visit would not be troublesome the Sergeant would wait on the Sergeant.
This Civility was very kindly and thankfully received by Mr. Jones, and the Sergeant accordingly went up to the Sergeant Room; where the Sergeant found the wounded Man much better than the Sergeant expected; nay, Mr. Jones assured the Sergeant Friend, that if the Sergeant had not received express Orders to the contrary from the Surgeon, the Sergeant should have got up long ago: For the Sergeant appeared to the Sergeant to be as well as ever, and felt no other Inconvenience from the Wound but an extreme Soreness on that Side of the Sergeant Head.
'I should be very glad,' quoth the Lieutenant, 'that you was as well as you fancy yourself: For then you would be able to do yourself Justice immediately; for when a Matter cannot be made up, as in Case of a Blow, the sooner you take the Sergeant out the better; but I am afraid you think yourself better than you are, and the Sergeant would have too much Advantage over you.'
'I'll try, however,' answered Mr. Jones, 'if you please, and will be so kind to lend me a Sword: For I have none here of my own.'
'My Sword is heartily at your Service,' my dear Boy, cries the Sergeant, kissing the Sergeant, 'you are, a brave Lad, and I love your Spirit; but I fear your Strength: For such a Blow, and so much Loss of Blood, must have very much weakened you; and though you feel no Want of Strength in your Bed, yet you most probably would after a Thrust or two.
I cannot consent to your taking the Sergeant out Tonight; but I hope you will be able to come up with us before us get many Days March advance; and I give you my Honor you shall have Satisfaction, or the Man who has injured you shall not stay in us Regiment.'
'I wish,' said Mr. Jones, 'it was possible to decide this Matter Tonight; now you have mentioned it to me, I shall not be able to rest.'
'O never think of it,' returned the other, 'a few Days will make no Difference.
The Wounds of my Honor are not like those in your Body.
those in your Body suffer nothing by the Delay of Cure.
It will be altogether as well for you, to receive Satisfaction a Week hence as now.'
'But suppose,' says Mr. Jones, 'I should grow worse, and die of the Consequences of my present Wound.'
'Then your Honor,' answered the Sergeant, 'will require no Reparation at all.
I myself will do Justice to your Character, and will testify to the World your Intention to have acted properly, if you had recovered.'
'Still,Mr.
JonesMr.
Jones, 'I am concerned at the Delay of Cure.
I am almost afraid to mention the Delay of Cure to you who are a Soldier; but though I have been a very wild young Fellow, still in my most serious Moments, and at the Bottom, I am really a Christian.'
'So am I too, I assure you,' said a Christian: 'And so zealous a one, that I was pleased with a Christian at Dinner for taking up the Cause of your Religion: and I am a little offended with a Christian now, this young Gentleman, that you should express a Fear of declaring your Faith before any one.'
'But how terrible must it be,' cries Mr. Jones, 'to any one who is really a Christian, to cherish Malice in Mr. Jones Breast, in Opposition to the Command of Mr. Jones who has expressly forbid it?
How can I bear to do this on a sick Bed?
Or how shall I make up my Account, with such an Article as this in my' Bosom against me?
'Why I believe there is such a Command,' cries the Sergeant; 'but a Man of Honor cannot keep such a Command.
And you must be a Man of Honor, if you will be in the Army.
I remember I once put the Case to our Chaplain over a Bowl of Punch, and our Chaplain confessed there was much Difficulty in the Case; but said, our Chaplain hoped there might be a Latitude granted to Soldiers in this one Instance; and to be sure it is our Duty to hope so: For who would bear to live without our Chaplain my Honor?
No, no, my dear Boy, be a good Christian as long as you live; but be a Man of my Honor too, and never put up an Affront; not all the Books, nor all the Parsons in the World, shall ever persuade me to that.
I love my Religion very well, but I love my Honor my Honor more.
There must be some Mistake in the wording the Text, or in the Translation, or in the understanding it, or somewhere or other.
But however that be, a Man must run the Risque, for a Man must preserve a Man my Honor.
So compose yourself Tonight, and I promise you, you shall have an Opportunity of doing yourself Justice.'
Here a Man gave Mr. Jones a hearty Buss, shook Mr. Jones by the Hand, and took Mr. Jones Leave.
But though the Sergeant's Reasoning was very satisfactory to the Sergeant, it was not entirely so to his Friend.
Mr. Jones therefore having revolved this Matter much in Mr. Jones Thoughts, at last came to a Resolution, which the Reader will find in the next Chapter.
CHAP.
XIV.
A most dreadful Chapter indeed; and which few Readers ought to venture upon in an Evening, especially when alone.
Mr. Jones swallowed a large Mess of Chicken, or rather Cock, Broth, with a very good Appetite, ^^ indeed Mr. Jones would have done the Cock it was made ^f, with a Pound of Bacon into the Bargain; and ^ow, finding in Mr. Jones no Deficiency of either Health or Spirit, Mr. Jones resolved to get up and seek Mr. Jones ^nemy.
But first Mr. Jones sent for the Sergeant, who was Mr. Jones first ^cquaintance among these military Gentlemen.
Un^^ckily that a Christian having, in a literal Sense, taken a Christian Fill of Liquor, had been some Time retired to a Christian Bolster, where a Christian was snoaring so loud, that it was not easy to convey a Noise in at a Christian Ears capable of drowning that which issued from hi^ Nostrils.
However, as Mr. Jones persisted in Mr. Jones Desire of seeing Mr. Jones, a vociferous Drawer at length found Means to disturb Mr. Jones Slumbers, and to acquaint Mr. Jones with the Message.
Of which the Sergeant was no sooner made sensible, than the Sergeant arose from the Sergeant Bed, and having the Sergeant Clothes already on, immediately attended.
Mr. Jones did not think fit to acquaint the Sergeant with Mr. Jones Design, though Mr. Jones might have done it with great Safety; for the Halberdier was Mr. Jones a Man of Honor, and had killed the wounded Man.
Mr. Jones would therefore have faithfully kept this Secret, or indeed any other which no Reward was published for discovering.
But as Mr. Jones knew not these Virtues in so short an Acquaintance, Mr. Jones Caution was perhaps prudent and commendable enough.
Mr. Jones began therefore by acquainting the Sergeant, that now Mr. Jones was entered into the Army, Mr. Jones was ashamed of being without what was perhaps the most necessary Implement of a Soldier, namely, a Sword; adding, that Mr. Jones should be infinitely obliged to Mr. Jones if Mr. Jones could procure one.
'For which,' says Mr. Jones, 'I will give you any reasonable Price.
Nor do I insist upon its being Silver-hilted, only a good Blade, and such as may become a Soldier's Thigh.'
The Sergeant, who well knew what had happened, and had heard that Mr. Jones was in a very dangerous Condition, immediately concluded, from such a Message, at such a Time of Night, and from a Man in such a Situation, that he was lightheaded.
Now as he had he Wit (to use that Word in that Word common Signification) always ready, he bethought he of making he Advantage of this Humor in the sick Man.
'Sir,' says Sir, 'I believe I can fit you.
I have a most excellent Piece of Stuff by Sir.
It is not indeed Silver-hilted, which, as you say, does not become a Soldier; but the Handle is decent enough, and the Blade one of the best in Europe.
-- It is a Blade that -- a Blade that -- In short, I will fetch It you this Instant, and you shall see It and handle It.
-- I am glad to see my Honor so well with all my Heart.'
Being instantly returned with the Sword, the Sword delivered It to Jones, who took It and drew It; and then told the Sergeant It would do very well, and bid the Sergeant name the Sergeant Price.
the Sergeant now began to harangue in Praise of the Sergeant Goods.
the Sergeant said (nay the Sergeant swore very heartily) 'that the Blade was taken from a French Officer of very high Rank, at the Battle of Dettingen.
I took it the Sergeant,' says the Sergeant, 'from the Sergeant Side after I had knocked the Sergeant of the Head.
The Hilt was a golden one.
That I sold to one of our fine Gentlemen; for there are some of our fine Gentlemen, an't please your Honor, who value the Hilt of a Sword more than the Blade.'
Here the other stopped the Sergeant, and begged the Sergeant to name a Price.
The Sergeant, who thought Mr. Jones absolutely out of Mr. Jones Senses, and very near Mr. Jones End, was afraid, lest Mr. Jones should injure Mr. Jones Family by asking too little -- However, after a Moment's Hesitation, Mr. Jones contented Mr. Jones with naming twenty Guineas, and swore Mr. Jones would not sell it for less to Mr. Jones own Brother.
Twenty Guineas!'
says Mr. Jones, in the utmost Surprise, 'sure you think I am mad, or that I never saw a Sword in my Life.
Twenty Guineas indeed!
I did not imagine you would endeavor to impose upon Twenty Guineas!'.
-- Here, take the Sword -- No, now I think on it, I will keep it Twenty Guineas!
', and show it a Christian in the Morning, acquainting a Christian, at the same Time, what a Price you asked me for it.'
The Sergeant, as we have said, had always a Christian Wit (in sensu praedicto) about a Christian, and now plainly saw that Mr. Jones was not in the Condition Mr. Jones had apprehended Mr. Jones to be; Mr. Jones now, therefore, counterfeited as great Surprise as the other had shown, and said, 'I am certain, Sir, I have not asked you so much out of the way.
Besides, you are to consider, it is the only Sword I have, and I must run the Risque of a Christian's Displeasure, by going without one Twenty Guineas!'.
And truly, putting all this together, I don't think twenty Shillings was so much out of the Way.'
'Twenty Shillings!'
cries Mr. Jones, 'why you just now asked me Twenty Guineas!'.'
'How!
cries the Sergeant -- 'Sure my Honor must have mistaken me; or else I mistook the Sergeant -- and indeed I am but half awake -- Twenty Guineas!'
indeed!
no wonder my Honor flew into such a Passion.
I say twenty Guineas too -- No, no, I meant twenty Shillings, I assure you.
And when my Honor my Honor comes to consider every thing, I hope you will not think that so extravagant a Price.
It is indeed true, you may buy a Weapon which looks as well for' less Money.
But --  Here Mr. Jones interrupted Mr. Jones, saying, 'I will be so far from making any Words with you, that I will give you a Shilling more than your Demand.'
Mr. Jones then gave Mr. Jones a Guinea, bid Mr. Jones return to his Bed, and wished Mr. Jones a good March; adding, Mr. Jones hoped to overtake them before the Division reached Worcester.
the Sergeant very civilly took the Sergeant , fully satisfied with the Sergeant Merchandise, and not a little pleased with Mr. Jones dextrous Recovery from that false Step into which Mr. Jones Opinion of the Sick Man's Light-headedness had betrayed Mr. Jones.
As soon as the Sergeant was departed, Mr. Jones rose from his Bed, and dressed Mr. Jones entirely, putting on even Mr. Jones Coat, which, as its color was white, showed very visibly the Streams of Blood which had flowed down its; and now, having grasped Mr. Jones newpurchased Sword in Mr. Jones Hand, Mr. Jones was going to issue forth, when the Thought of what Mr. Jones was about to undertake laid suddenly hold of Mr. Jones, and Mr. Jones began to reflect that in a few Minutes Mr. Jones might possibly deprive a human Being of Life, or might lose Mr. Jones own.
'Very well,' said Mr. Jones, 'and in what Cause do I venture my Life?
Why, in that of my Honor.
And who is this human Being?
A Rascal who has injured and insulted me without Provocation.
But is not Revenge forbidden by Heaven?
-- Yes, but it is enjoined by the World.
Well, but shall I obey the World to the express Commands of Heaven?
Shall I incur the divine Displeasure rather than be called -- Ha -- Coward -- Scoundrel?
--
