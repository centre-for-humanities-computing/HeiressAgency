 The Clock had now struck Twelve, and every one in the House were in their Beds, except the Sentinel who stood to guard Northerton, when Jones softly opening Jones Door, issued forth in Pursuit of Jones Enemy, of whose Place of Confinement Jones had received a perfect Description from the Drawer.
It is not easy to conceive a much more tremendous Figure than Jones now exhibited.
Jones had on, as we have said, a light-coloured Coat, covered with Streams of Blood.
Jones Face, which missed that very Blood, as well as twenty Ounces more drawn from Jones by the Surgeon, was pallid.
Round Jones Head was a Quantity of Bandage, not unlike a Turban.
In the right Hand Jones carried a Sword, and in the left a Candle.
So that the bloody Banquo was not worthy to be compared to Jones.
In Fact, I believe a more dreadful Apparition was never raised in a Churchyard, nor in the Imagination of any good People met in a Winter Evening over a Christmas Fire in Somersetshire.
When the Sentinel first saw our Hero approach, Hero Hair began gently to lift up Hero Grenadier's Cap; and in the same Instant Hero Knees fell to Blows with each other.
Presently Hero whole Body was seized with worse than an Ague Fit.
Hero then fired Hero Piece, and fell flat on Hero Face.
Whether Fear or Courage was the Occasion of Hero Firing, or whether Hero took Aim at the Object of Hero Terror, I cannot say.
If Hero did, however, Hero had the good Fortune to miss Hero Man.
Jones seeing the Fellow fall, guessed the Cause of Hero Fright, at which Hero could not forbear smiling, not in the least reflecting on the Danger from which Hero had just escaped.
Hero then passed by the Fellow, who still continued in the Posture in which Hero fell, and entered the Room where Northerton, as Hero had heard, was confined.
Here, in a solitary Situation Hero found -- an empty Quart Pot standing on the Table, on which some Beer being split, looked as if the Room had lately been inhabited; but at present the Room was entirely vacant.
Hero then apprehended the Room might lead to some other Apartment; but, upon searching all round it, Hero could perceive no other Door than that at which Hero entered, and where the Sentinel had been posted.
Hero then proceeded to call Northerton several Times by Hero Name; but no one answered; nor did this serve to any other Purpose than to confirm the Sentinel in Hero Terrors, who was now convinced that the Volunteer was dead of Hero Wounds, and that Hero Ghost was come in Search of the Murderer: the Murderer now lay in all the Agonies of Horror, and I wish, with all my Heart, some of those Actors, who are hereafter to represent a Man frighted out of the Murderer Wits, had seen the Murderer, that some of those Actors, who are hereafter to represent a Man frighted out of his Wits might be taught to copy Nature instead of performing several antic Tricks and Gestures, for the Entertainment and Applause of the Galleries.
Perceiving the Bird was flown, at least despairing to find the Murderer, and rightly apprehending that the Report of the Firelock would alarm the whole House, our Hero now blew out our Hero Candle, and gently stole back again to our Hero Chamber, and to our Hero Bed: Whither our Hero would not have been able to have gotten undiscovered, had any other Person been on the same Staircase, save only one Gentleman who was confined to his Bed by the Gout; for before our Hero could reach the Door to our Hero Chamber, the Hall where the Sentinel had been posted was half full of People.
Some in People Shirts, and others not half dressed, all very earnestly enquiring of each other, what was the Matter?
The Soldier was now found lying in the same Place and Posture in which we just before left The Soldier.
Several immediately applied Some in their Shirts, and others not half dressed to raise The Soldier, and some concluded The Soldier dead: But Some in their Shirts, and others not half dressed presently saw Some in their Shirts, and others not half dressed Mistake; for Mistake not only struggled with those who laid Some in their Shirts, and others not half dressed Hands on Mistake, but fell a roaring like a Bull.
In reality, Mistake imagined so many Spirits or Devils were handling Mistake; for Mistake Imagination being possessed with the Horror of an Apparition, converted every Object Mistake saw or felt, into nothing but Ghosts and Specter.
At length Mistake was overpowered by Numbers, and got upon Mistake Legs; when Candles being brought, and seeing two or three of Mistake Comrades present, Mistake came a little to Mistake; but when they asked Mistake what was the Matter?
Mistake answered, 'I am a dead Man, that is all, I Am a dead Man.
I cannot recover it.
I have seen Mistake.'
What have thou seen, Jack,' says one of the Soldiers.
'Why I have seen the young Volunteer that was killed Yesterday.'
Mistake then imprecated the most heavy Curses on Mistake, if Mistake had not seen the Volunteer, all over Blood, vomiting Fire out of Mistake Mouth and Nostrils, pass by Mistake into the Chamber where Ensign Northerton was, and then seizing the Ensign by the Throat, fly away with Mistake in a Clap of Thunder.
This Relation met with a gracious Reception from the Audience.
All the Women present believed All the Women present firmly, and prayed Heaven to defend All the Women present from Murder.
Amongst the Men too, many had Faith in the Story; but others turned it into Derision and Ridicule; and a Sergeant who was present, answered very coolly: 'Mistake, you will hear more of this for going to sleep, and dreaming on your Post.'
The Soldier replied, 'You may punish me if you please; but I was as broad awake as I am now; and the Devil carry me away, as the Devil has the Ensign, if I did not see Mistake as I tell you, with Eyes as big and as fiery as two large Flambeaux.'
The Commander of the Forces, and the Commander of the House, were now both arrived: For the former being awake at the Time, and hearing the Sentinel fire Mistake Piece, thought it Mistake Duty to rise immediately, though Mistake had no great Apprehensions of any Mischief; whereas the Apprehensions of the latter were much greater, lest her Spoons and Tankards should be upon the March, without having received any such Orders from her.
Our poor Sentinel, to whom the Sight of this Officer was not much more welcome than the Apparition, as this Officer thought it, which this Officer had seen before, again related the dreadful Story, and with many Additions of Blood and Fire: But this Officer had the Misfortune to gain no Credit with either of the last mentioned Persons; for this Officer, though a very religious Man, was free from all Terrors of this Kind; besides, having so lately left Jones in the Condition Our have seen, Jones had no Suspicion of Jones being dead.
As for the Landlady, though not over religious, the Landlady had no kind of Aversion to the Doctrine of Spirits; but there was a Circumstance in the Tale which the Landlady well knew to be false, as we shall inform the Reader presently.
But whether Northerton was carried away in Thunder or Fire, or in whatever other Manner Northerton was gone; it was now certain, that Northerton Body was no longer in Custody.
Upon this Occasion, Northerton formed a Conclusion not very different from what the Sergeant is just mentioned to have made before, and immediately ordered the Sentinel Sentinel to be taken Prisoner.
So that, by a strange Reverse of Fortune (though not very uncommon in a military Life) the Guard became the Guarded.
CHAP.
XV.
The Conclusion of the foregoing Adventure.
BESIDES the Suspicion of Sleep, Northerton harbored another, and worse Doubt against the Sentinelthe Sentinel, and this was that of Treachery: For as Northerton believed not one Syllable of the Apparition, so Northerton imagined the whole to be an Invention, formed only to impose upon Northerton, and that Fellow had, in Reality, been bribed by Northerton to let Northerton escape.
And this Northerton imagined the rather, as the his Fright appeared to Northerton, the more unnatural in one who had the Character of as brave and bold a Man as any in the Regiment, having been in several Actions, having received several Wounds, and in a Word, having behaved Northerton always like a good and valiant Soldier.
That the Reader, therefore, may not conceive the least ill Opinion of such a Person, we shall not delay a Moment in rescuing his Character from the Imputation of this Guilt.
Northerton then, as we have before observed, was fully satisfied with the Glory which Northerton had obtained from this Action.
Northerton had, perhaps, seen, or heard, or guessed, that Envy is apt to attend Fame.
Not that I would here insinuate, that Northerton was heathenishly inclined to believe in, or to worship, the Goddess Nemesis; for, in fact, I am convinced Northerton never heard of her Name.
Northerton was, besides, of an Active Disposition, and had a great Antipathy to those close Winter Quarters in the Castle of Gloucester, for which a Justice of Peace might possibly give Northerton a Billet.
Nor was Northerton moreover free from some uneasy Meditations on a certain wooden Edifice, which I forbear to name, in Conformity to the Opinion of Mankind, who, I think, rather ought to honor than to be ashamed of this Building, as it is, or at least might be made, of more Benefit to Society than almost any other public Erection.
In a Word, to hint at no more Reasons for Northerton Conduct, Northerton was desirous of departing that Evening, and nothing remained for Northerton but to contrive the Quomodo, which appeared to be a Matter of some Difficulty.
Now this young Gentleman, though somewhat crooked in Northerton Morals, was perfectly strait in Northerton Person, which was extremely strong and well made.
Northerton Face too was accounted handsome by the Generality of Women, for it was broad and ruddy, with tolerably good Teeth.
Such Charms did not fail making an Impression on my Landlady, who had no little Relish for this kind of Beauty.
Such Charms had, indeed, a real Compassion for the young Man; and hearing from the Surgeon that Affairs were like to go ill with the young Volunteer that was killed Yesterday, Such Charms suspected a real Compassion for the young Man; and hearing from the Surgeon might hereafter wear no benign Aspect with the Ensign.
Having obtained, therefore, leave to make the young Man a Visit, and finding the young Man in a very melancholy Mood, which Such Charms considerably heightened, by telling the young Man there were scarce any Hopes of the young Volunteer that was killed Yesterday's Life, Such Charms proceeded to throw forth some Hints, which the other readily and eagerly taking up, a real Compassion for the young Man; and hearing from the Surgeon soon came to a right Understanding; and it was at length agreed, that the Ensign should at a certain Signal ascend the Chimney, which communicating very soon with that of the Kitchen, the young Man might there again let the young Man down; for which Such Charms would give the young Man an Opportunity, by keeping the Coast clear.
But lest our Readers, of a different Complexion, should take this Occasion of too hastily condemning all Compassion as a Folly, and pernicious to Society, we think proper to mention another Particular, which might possibly have some little Share in this Action.
the Ensign the Ensign happened to be at this Time possessed of the Sum of fifty Pounds, which did indeed belong to his Company: For the Captain having quarrelled with the Captain Lieutenant, had entrusted the Payment of the Captain Company to the Ensign.
This Money, however, the Ensign thought proper to deposite in my Landlady's Hand, possibly by way of Bail or Security that the Ensign would hereafter appear and answer to the Charge against the Ensign; but whatever were the Conditions, certain it is, that she had the Money, and the Ensignthe Ensign .
The Reader may, perhaps, expect, from the compassionate Temper of this good Woman, that when she saw the Sentinel taken Prisoner for a Fact of which she knew Prisoner innocent, that she should immediately have interposed in Prisoner Behalf; but whether it was that she had already exhausted all she Compassion in the abovementioned Instance, or that the Features of Fellow, though not very different from those of the Ensign, could not raise it, I will not determine; but so far from being an Advocate for the present Prisoner, she urged Prisoner Guilt to Prisoner , declaring with uplifted Eyes and Hands, that she would not have had any Concern in the Escape of a Murderer for all the World.
Every thing was now once more quiet; and most of the Company returned again to their Beds; but the Landlady, either from the natural Activity of she Disposition, or from she Fear for she Plate, having no Propensity to sleep, prevailed with the Officers, as the Officers were to march within little more than an Hour, to spend that Time with she over a Bowl of Punch.
Jones had lain awake all this while, and had heard great Part of the Hurry and Bustle that had passed, of which Jones had now some Curiosity to know the Particulars.
Jones therefore applied to Jones Bell, which Jones rung at least twenty Times without any Effect; for my Landlady was in such high Mirth with my Landlady Company, that no Clapper could be heard there but my Landlady own, and the Drawer and Chambermaid, who were sitting together in the Kitchen (for neither durst Jones sit up, nor my Landlady lie in Bed alone) the more they heard the Bell ring, the more they were frightened, and, as the Bell ring were, nailed down in they Places.
At last, at a lucky Interval of Chat, the Sound reached the Ears of our good Landlady, who presently sent forth my Landlady Summons, which both my Landlady Servants instantly obeyed.
'Joo,' says the Mistress, 'don't you hear the Bell ring?
why don't you go up?'
'It is not my Business,' answered the Drawer, 'to wait upon the Chambers.
It is Betty Chambermaid's!'
'If you come to that,' answered the Maid, 'it is not my Business to wait upon Gentlemen.
I have done my Business, indeed, some times; but the Devil fetch me if ever I do again, since you make your Preambles about my Business.'
Bell still ringing violently, the Mistress the Mistress fell into a Passion, and swore, if the Drawer did not go up immediately, the Mistress would turn the Mistress away that very Morning.
'If you do, Madam,' says the Mistress, 'I cannot help it.
I will not do another Servant's Business.'
the Mistress then applied the Mistress to the Maid, and endeavored to prevail by gentle Means; but all in vain, Betty was as inflexible as Joo.
Both insisted it was not Both Business, and Both would not do it.
Northerton then fell a laughing, and said, 'Come, I will put an End to this Contention;' and then turning to the Servants, commended the Servants for the Servants Resolution, in neither giving up the Point; but added, Northerton was sure, if one would consent to go, the other would.
To which Proposal they both agreed in an Instant, and accordingly went up very lovingly and close together.
When they both were gone, Northerton appeased the Wrath of my Landlady, by satisfying my Landlady why they both were both so unwilling to go alone.
they both returned soon after, and acquainted they both , that this young Gentleman was so far from being dead, that this young Gentleman spoke as heartily as if this young Gentleman was well; and that this young Gentleman gave this young Gentleman Service to the Captain, and should be very glad of the Favor of seeing this young Gentleman before this young Gentleman marched.
Northerton immediately complied with this young Gentleman Desires, and sitting down by this young Gentleman Bedside acquainted this young Gentleman with the Scene which had happened below, concluding with this young Gentleman Intentions to make an Example of the Sentinel.
Upon this, Jones related to Jones the whole Truth, and earnestly begged Jones not to punish the poor Soldier, 'who, I am confident,' says Jones, 'is as innocent of the Ensign's Escape, as Jones is of forging any Lie, or of endeavoring to impose on you.'
Northerton hesitated a few Moments, and then answered: 'Why, as you have cleared the Fellow of one Part of the Charge, so it will be impossible to prove the other; because Northerton was not the only Sentinel.
But I have a good mind to punish the Rascal for being a Coward.
Yet who knows what Effect the Terror of such an Apprehension may have; and to say the Truth, Northerton has always behaved well against an Enemy.
Come, it is a good Thing to see any Sign of Religion in these Fellows; so I promise you Northerton shall be set at liberty when we march.
But hark, the General beats.
My dear Boy, give me another Buss.
Don't discompose nor hurry yourself; but remember the Christian Doctrine of Patience, and I warrant you will soon be able to do yourself Justice, and take to an honorable Revenge on Fellow who has injured you.'
Northerton then departed, and Jones endeavored to compose Northerton to Rest.
THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING.
BOOK VIII.
Containing above two Days.
CHAP.
I.
A wonderful long Chapter concerning the Mavelous; being much the longest of all our introductory Chapters.
AS our are now entering upon a Book, in which the Course of our History will oblige our to relate some Matters of a more strange and surprising Kind than any which have hitherto occurred, it may not be amiss in the prolegomenous, or introductory Chapter, to say something of that Species of Writing which is called the Mavelous.
To this we shall, as well for the Sake of we, as of others, endeavor to set some certain Bounds; and indeed nothing can be more necessary, as Critics By this Word here, and in most other Parts of our Work, our mean every Reader in the World.
of different Complexions are here apt to run into very different Extremes; for while some are, with M. Dacier, ready to allow, that the same Thing which is impossible may be yet probable It is happy for M. Dacier that M. Dacier was not an Irishman.
, others have so little Historic or Poetic Faith, that others believe nothing to be either possible or probable, the like to which has not occured to others own Observation.
First then, I think, it may very reasonably be required of every Writer, that Writer keeps within the Bounds of Possibility; and still remembers that what it is not possible for Man to perform, it is scarce possible for Man to believe Man did perform.
This Conviction, perhaps, gave Birth to many Stories of the ancient Heathen Deities (for most of many Stories of the ancient Heathen Deities are of poetical Original).
The Poet, being desirous to indulge a wanton and extravagant Imagination, took Refuge in that Power, of the Extent of which his Readers were no Judges, or rather which Readers imagined to be infinite, and consequently Readers could not be shocked at any Prodigies related of it.
This has been strongly urged in Defense of Homer's Miracles; and This is, perhaps, a Defense; not, as Mr. Pope would have it, because Ulysses told a set of foolish Lies to the Phaeacians, who were a very dull Nation; but because the Poet himself wrote to Heathens, to whom poetical Fables were Articles of Faith.
For my own Part, I must confess, so compassionate is my Temper, I wish Polypheme had confined Polypheme to Polypheme Milk Diet, and preserved Polypheme Eye; nor could Ulysses be much more concerned than Polypheme, when Polypheme Companions were turned into Swine by Circe, who showed, I think, afterward, too much Regard for Man's Flesh to be supposed capable of converting Man's Flesh into Bacon.
I wish, likewise, with all my Heart, that Homer could have known the Rule prescribed by Horace, to introduce supernatural Agents as seldom as possible.
We should not then have seen Homer Gods coming on trivial Errands, and often behaving themselves so as not only to forfeit all Title to Respect, but to become the Objects of Scorn and Derision.
A Conduct which must have shocked the Credulity of a pious and sagacious Heathen; and which could never have been defended, unless by agreeing with a Supposition to which I have been sometimes almost inclined, that this most glorious Poet, as Homer certainly was, had an Intent to burlesque the superstious Faith of Homer own Age and Country.
But I have rested too long on a Doctrine which can be of no Use to a Christian Writer: For as Homer cannot introduce into Homer Works any of that heavenly Host which make a Part of Homer Creed; so is it horrid Puerility to search the Heathen Theology for any of those Deities who have been long since dethroned from Deities Immortality.
Lord Shaftsbury observes, that nothing is more cold than the Invocation of a Muse by a Modern; Lord Shaftsbury might have added that nothing can be more absurd.
A modern may with much more Elegance invoke a Ballad, as some have thought Homer did, or a Mug of Ale with the Author of Hudibras; which latter may perhaps have inspired much more Poetry as well as Prose, than all the Liquors of Hippocrene or Helicon.
The only supernatural Agents which can in any Manner be allowed to us Moderns are Ghosts; but of Moderns are Ghosts I would advise an Author to be extremely sparing.
Moderns are Ghosts are indeed like Arsenic, and other dangerous Drugs in Physic, to be used with the utmost Caution; nor would I advise the Introduction of Moderns are Ghosts at all in those Works, or by those Authors to which, or to whom a Horse-Laugh in the Reader, would be any great Prejudice or Mortification.
As for Elves and Fairies, and other such Mummery, I purposely omit the Mention of Moderns are Ghosts, as I should be very unwilling to confine within any Bounds those surprising Imaginations, for whose Capacity the Limits of human Nature are too narrow; whose Works are to be considered as a new Creation; and who have consequently just Right to do what they will with they own.
Man therefore is the highest Subject (unless on very extraordinary Occasions indeed) which presents itself to the Pen of our Historian, or of our ; and in relating his Actions, great Care is to be taken, that our do not exceed the Capacity of the Agent our describe.
Nor is Possibility alone sufficient to justify our, our must keep likewise within the Rules of Probability.
It is, I think, the Opinion of Aristotle; or if not, it is the Opinion of some wise Man, whose Authority will be as weighty, when it is as old; 'that it is no Excuse for a Poet who relates what is incredible, that the thing related is really Matter of Fact.'
This may perhaps be allowed true with regard to Poetry, but it may be thought impracticable to extend it to our Historian: For our Historian is obliged to record Matters as our Historian finds them; though them may be of so extraordinary a Nature, as will require no small Degree of historical Faith to swallow them.
Such was the successless Armament of Xerxes, described by Herodotus, or the successful Expedition of Alexander related by Arrian.
Such of later Years was the Victory of Agincourt obtained by Harry the Fifth, or that of Narva, won by Charles the Twelfth of Sweden.
All which Instances, the more we reflect on them, appear still the more astonishing.
Such Facts, however, as them occur in the Thread of the Story; nay, indeed, as them constitute the essential Parts of it, our Historian is not only justifiable in recording as them really happened; but indeed would be unpardonable, should our Historian omit or alter them.
But there are other Facts not of such Consequence nor so necessary, which though ever so well attested, may nevertheless be sacrificed to Oblivion in Complaisance to the Skepticism of a Reader.
Such is that memorable Story of the Ghost of George Villers, which might with more Propriety have been made a Present of to Dr. Drelincourt, to have kept the Ghost of Mrs. Veale Company, at the Head of Dr. Drelincourt Discourse upon Death, than have been introduced into so solemn a Work as the History of the Rebellion.
To say the Truth, if our Historian will confine Historian to what really happened, and utterly reject any Circumstance, which, though never so well attested, Historian must be well assured is false, Historian will sometimes fall into the Mavelous, but never into the Incredible.
Historian will often raise the Wonder and Surprise of Historian Reader, but never that incredulous Hatred mentioned by Horace.
It is by falling into Fiction therefore, that we generally offend against this Rule, of deserting Probability, which the Historian seldom if ever quits, till Historian forsakes Historian Character, and commences a Writer of Romance.
In this, however, those Historians who relate public Transactions, have the Advantage of us who confine ourselves to Scenes of private Life.
The Credit of the former is by common Notoriety supported for a long Time; and public Records, with the concurrent Testimony of many Authors bear Evidence to many Authors Truth in future Ages.
Thus a Trajan and an Antoninus, a Nero and a Caligula, have all met with the Belief of Posterity; and no one doubts but that Men so very good, and so very bad, were once the Masters of Mankind.
But we who deal in private Characters, who search into the most retired Recesses, and draw forth Examples of Virtue and Vice, from Holes and Corners of the World, are in a more dangerous Situation.
As' we have no public Notoriety, no concurrent Testimony, no Records to support and corroborate what we deliver, it becomes we not only to keep within the Limits of Possibility, but of Probability too; and this more especially in painting what is greatly good and amiable.
Knavery and Folly, though never so exorbitant, will more easily meet with Assent: for Illnature adds great Support and Strength to Faith.
Thus we may, perhaps, with little Danger relate the History of a Fisher; who having long owed his Bread to the Generosity of Mr. Derby, and having that very Morning received a considerable Bounty from Mr. Derby Hands, in order to possess Mr. Derby of what remained in Mr. Derby Friend's Scrutore, concealed Mr. Derby in a public Office of the Temple, through which there was a Passage into Mr. Derby's Chambers.
Here Mr. Derby overheard Mr. Derby for many Hours solacing Mr. Derby at an Entertainment which Mr. Derby that Evening gave Mr. Derby Friends, and to which Fisher had been invited.
During all this Time, no tender, no grateful Reflections arose to restrain Mr. Derby Purpose; but when the poor Gentleman had let the poor Gentleman Company out through Office of the Temple, Fisher came suddenly from the poor Gentleman lurking Place, and walking softly behind the poor Gentleman his Friend into the poor Gentleman Chamber, discharged a Pistol Ball into the poor Gentleman Head.
This may be believed, when the Bones of Fisher are as rotten as the Bones of Fisher Heart.
Nay, perhaps, it will be credited that the Villain went two Days afterward with some young Ladies to the Play of Hamlet; and with an unaltered Countenance heard one of the Ladies, who little suspected how near she was to the Person, cry out, Good God!
if the Man that murdered Mr. Derby was now present!
Manifesting in this a more seared and callous Conscience than even Nero himself; of whom we are told by Suetonius, 'that the Consciousness of the Man that murdered Mr. Derby Guilt after the Death of the Man that murdered Mr. Derby Mother became immediately intolerable, and so continued; nor could all the Congratulations of the Soldiers, of the Senate, and the People, allay the Horrors of the Man that murdered Mr. Derby Conscience.'
But now, on the other hand, should I tell his Reader, that I had known a Man whose penetrating Genius had enabled the Man that murdered Mr. Derby to raise a large Fortune in a Way where no Beginning was chaulked out to the Man that murdered Mr. Derby: That the Man that murdered Mr. Derby had done this with the most perfect Preservation of the Man that murdered Mr. Derby Integrity, and not only without the least Injustice or Injury to any one individual Person, but with the highest Advantage to Trade, and a vast Increase of the public Revenue: That the Man that murdered Mr. Derby had expended one Part of the Income of this Fortune in discovering a Taste superior to most, by Works where the highest Dignity was united with the purest Simplicity, and another Part in displaying a Degree of Goodness superior to all Men, by acts of Charity to Objects whose only Recommendations were their Merits, or their Wants: That the Man that murdered Mr. Derby was most industrious in searching after Merit in Distress, most eager to relieve it, and then as careful (perhaps too careful) to conceal what the Man that murdered Mr. Derby had done: That the Man that murdered Mr. Derby House, the Man that murdered Mr. Derby Furniture, the Man that murdered Mr. Derby Gardens, the Man that murdered Mr. Derby Table, the Man that murdered Mr. Derby private Hospitality, and the Man that murdered Mr. Derby public Beneficence all denoted the Mind from which they flowed, and were all intrinsically rich and noble, without Tinsel, or external Ostentation: That the Man that murdered Mr. Derby filled every Relation in Life with the most adequate Virtue: That the Man that murdered Mr. Derby was most piously religious to the Man that murdered Mr. Derby Creator, most zealously loyal to the Man that murdered Mr. Derby Sovereign; a most tender Husband to the Man that murdered Mr. Derby Wife, a kind Relation, a munificent Patron, a warm and firm Friend, a knowing and a cheerful Companion, indulgent to his Servants, hospitable to his Neighbors, charitable to the Poor, and benevolent to all Mankind.
Should I add to these the Epithits of wise, brave, elegant, and indeed every other amiable Epithet in our Language, I might surely say,  -- Quis credet?
nemo Hercule!
nemo; Vel duo, vel nemo.
And yet I know a Man who is all I have here described.
But a single Instance (and I really know not such another) is not sufficient to justify us, while us are writing to thousands who never heard of the Person, nor of any thing like the Person.
Such Rarae Aves should be remitted to the Epitaph-Writer, or to some Poet, who may condescend to hitch the Epitaph-Writer in a Distich, or to slide the Epitaph-Writer into a Rhyme with an Air of Carelessness and Neglect, without giving any Offense to the Reader.
In the last Place, the Actions should be such as may not only be within the Compass of human Agency, and which human Agents may probably be supposed to do; but human Agents should be likely for the very Actors and Characters themselves to have performed: For what may be only wonderful and surprising in one Man, may become improbable, or indeed impossible, when related of another.
This last Requisite is what the dramatic Critics call Conservation of Character, and This last Requisite requires a very extraordinary Degree of Judgment, and a most exact Knowledge of human Nature.
It is admirably remarked by a most excellent Writer, That Zeal can no more hurry a Man to act in direct Opposition to direct Opposition, than a rapid Stream can carry a Boat against a Boat own Current.
I will venture to say, that for a Man to act in direct Contradiction to the Dictates of Nature, is, if not impossible, as improbable and as miraculous as any Thing which can well be conceived.
Should the best Parts of the Story of M. Antoninus be ascribed to even Nero himself, or should the worst Incidents of even Nero himself's Life be imputed to M. Antoninus, what would be more shocking to Belief than either Instance; whereas both these being related of both these proper Agent, constitute the Truly Mavelous.
Our modern Authors of Comedy have fallen almost universally into the Error here hinted at: Our modern Authors of Comedy Heroes generally are notorious Rogues, and Our modern Authors of Comedy Heroines abandoned Jades, during the first four Acts; but in the fifth, the former become very worthy Gentlemen, and the latter, Women of Virtue and Discretion: Nor is the Writer often so kind as to give the Writer the least Trouble, to reconcile or account for this monstrous Change and Incongruity.
There is, indeed, no other Reason to be assigned for it, than because the Play of Hamlet is drawing to a Conclusion; as if it was no less natural in a Rogue to repent in the last Act of a Play, than in the last of the Writer Life; which we perceive to be generally the Case at Tyburn, a Place which might, indeed, close the Scene of some Comedies with much Propriety, as the Heroes in these are most commonly eminent for those very Talents which not only bring Men to the Gallows, but enable Men to make an heroic Figure when Men are there.
Within these few Restrictions, I think, every the Writer may be permitted to deal as much in the Wonderful as every Writer pleases; nay, the more every Writer can surprise the Reader, if every Writer thus keeps within the Rules of Credibility, the more every Writer will engage every Writer Attention, and the more every Writer will charm every Writer.
As a Genius of the highest Rank observes in every Writer 5th Chapter of the Bathos, 'The great Art of all Poetry is to mix Truth with Fiction; in order to join the Credible with the Surprising.'
For though every good Author will confine Author within the Bounds of Probability, it is by no means necessary that Author Characters, or Author Incidents, should be trite, common, or vulgar; such as happen in every Street, or in every House, or which may be met with in the home Articles of a News-paper.
Nor must Author be inhibited from showing many Persons and Things, which may possibly have never fallen within the Knowledge of great Part of Author Readers.
If the Writer strictly observes the Rules abovementioned, the Writer has discharged the Writer Part; and is then entitled to some Faith from the Writer Reader, who is indeed guilty of critical Infidelity if the Writer disbelieves the Writer.
For want of a Portion of such Faith, I remember the Character of a young Lady of Quality, which was condemned on the Stage for being unnatural, by the unanimous Voice of a very large Assembly of Clerks and Apprentices; though it had had the previous Suffrages of many Ladies of the first Rank; one of whom very eminent for her Understanding, declared it was the Picture of half the young People of her Acquaintance.
CHAP.
II.
In which the Landlady pays a Visit to Mr. Jones.
WHEN Mr. Jones had taken Leave of Mr. Jones Friend the Lieutenant, Mr. Jones endeavored to close Mr. Jones Eyes, but all in vain; Mr. Jones Spirits were too lively and wakeful to be lulled to Sleep.
So having amused, or rather tormented Mr. Jones with the Thoughts of Mr. Jones Sophia, till it was open Daylight, Mr. Jones called for some Tea; upon which Occasion my Landlady herself vouchsafed to pay Mr. Jones a Visit.
This was indeed the first Time her had seen Mr. Jones, or at least had taken any Notice of Mr. Jones; but as the Lieutenant had assured her that Mr. Jones was certainly some young Gentleman of Fashion, her now determined to show Mr. Jones all the Respect in her Power: for, to speak truly, this was one of those Houses where Gentlemen, to use the Language of Advertisements, meet with civil Treatment for Advertisements Money.
her had no sooner begun to make his Tea, than her likewise began to discourse, 'La!
Sir,' said her, I think it is great Pity that such a pretty young Gentleman should undervalue Gentleman so, as to go about with these Soldier Fellows.
these Soldier Fellows call these Soldier Fellows Gentlemen, I warrant you; but, as my first Husband used to say, these Soldier Fellows should remember it is we that pay these Soldier Fellows.
And to be sure it is very hard upon we to be obliged to pay these Soldier Fellows, and to keep 'em too, as we Publicans are.
I had twenty of 'um last Night, besides Officers; nay, for matter of that, I had rather have the Soldiers than the Officers: For nothing is ever good enough for those Sparks; and I am sure if you was to see the Bills; La, Sir, it is nothing.
I have had less Trouble, I warrant you, with a good Squire's Family, where we take forty or fifty Shillings of a Night besides Horses'.
And yet I warrants me, there is narrow a one of all those Officer Fellows, but looks upon Squire to be as good as arrow a Squire of 500l.
a Year.
To be sure it does me Good to hear their Men run about after 'um, crying your Honor, and your Honor.
Marry come up with your Honor, and an Ordinary at a Shilling a Head.
Then there is such Swearing among 'um, to be sure, it frightens me out of my Wits, I think nothing can prosper with such wicked People.
And here one of 'um has used you in so barbarous a Manner.
I thought indeed how well the rest would secure Squire; they all hang together; for if you had been in Danger of Death, which I am glad to see you are not, it would have been all as one to such wicked People.
such wicked People would have let Squire go.
Laud have Mercy upon 'um, I would not have such a Sin to answer for, for the whole World.
But though you are likely, with the Blessing to recover, there is Laa for Laa yet, and if you will employ Layer Small, I dare be sworn Laa will make the Fellow fly the Country for Laa; though perhaps, Laa will have fled the Country before; for it is here Today and gone Tomorrow with such Chaps.
I hope however, you will learn more Wit for the future, and return back to your Friends; I warrant they are all miserable for your Loss; and if they was but to know what had happened.
La, my seeming!
I would not for the World they should.
Come, come, we know very well what all the Matter is; but if one will not, another will, so pretty a Gentleman need never want a Lady.
I am sure if I was as you, I would see the finest a Lady that ever wore a Head hanged, before I would go for a Soldier for a Lady.
-- Nay, don't blush so (for indeed he did to a violent Degree) why, you thought, Sir, I knew nothing of the Matter, I warrant you, about his Sophia.'
'How,' says Mr. Jones, starting up, 'do you know his Sophiahis Sophia?'
Do I?
ay marry,' cries the Landlady, 'many's the Time has his Sophia lain in this House.'
'With his Sophia Aunt, I suppose,' says Mr.
Jones.'
-- 'Why there it is now,' cries the Landlady.
'Ay, ay, ay, I know his Sophia very well.
And a sweet young Creature is Madam Sophia, that is the truth on it.'
'A sweet Creature!'
cries Mr. Jones,' Oh Heavens!
Angels are painted fair to look like his Sophia.
There Is in his Sophia all that we believe of Heaven, Amazing Brightness, Purity and Truth, Eternal Joy, and everlasting Love.
'And could I ever have imagined that you had known his Sophia.'
'I wish,' says the Landlady, 'you knew half so much of the Landlady.
What would you have given to have sat by the Landlady Bedside?
What a delicious Neck the Landlady has!
the Landlady lovely Limbs have stretched Her lovely Limbs in that very Bed you now lie in.'
'Here!
cries Mr. Jones, 'hath his Sophia ever lain here?
-- 'Ay, ay, here; there; in that very Bed,' says the Landlady, 'where I wish you had the Landlady this Moment; and the Landlady may wish so too, for any thing I know to the contrary: For the Landlady has mentioned your Name to the Landlady.'
-- 'Ha,' cries the Landlady, 'did the Landlady ever mention the Landlady Mr. Jones?
-- You flatter me now, I can never believe so much.'
Why then,' answered the Landlady, 'as I hope to be saved, and may the Devil fetch me, if I speak a Syllable more than the Truth.
I have heard the Landlady mention Mr. Jones; but in a civil and modest Way, I confess; yet I could perceive the Landlady thought a great deal more than the Landlady said.'
'O my dear Woman,' cries Mr. Jones, 'the Landlady Thoughts of me I shall never be worthy of.
O the Landlady is all Gentleness, Kindness, Goodness.
Why was such a Rascal as I born, ever to give the Landlady soft Bosom a Moment's Uneasiness?
Why am I cursed?
I, who would undergo all the Plagues and Miseries which any Demon ever invented for Mankind, to procure the Landlady any Good; nay, Torture itself could not be Misery to me, did I but know that the Landlady was happy,' 'Why look you there now,' says the Landlady, I told the Landlady you was a constant Lover.'
But pray, Madam, tell me when or where you knew any thing of me; for I never was here before, nor do I remember ever to have seen you.'
'Nor is it possible you should,' answered the Landlady, 'for you was a little Thing when I had you in my Lap at the Squire's.'
-- 'How the Squire's,' said Mr. Jones, what do you know the great and good Mr. Allworthy then?'
'Yes, marry do I,' says the Landlady; 'Who in the Country does not?'
-- 'the Fame of his Goodness indeed,' answered Mr. Jones, 'must have extended farther than this; but Heaven only can know Mr. Jones, can know that Benevolence which is copied from Benevolence, and sent upon Earth as Benevolence own Pattern.
Mankind are as ignorant of such divine Goodness, as they are unworthy of it; but none so unworthy of it as myself.
I who was raised by Mr. Jones to such a Height; taken in, as you well must know, a poor base-born Child, adopted by Mr. Jones, and treated as Mr. Jones own Son, to dare by my Follies to disoblige Mr. Jones, to draw Mr. Jones Vengeance upon myself.
Yes, I deserve it all: For I will never be so ungrateful as even to think Mr. Jones has done an Act of Injustice by myself.
No, I deserve to be turned out of Doors, as I am.
And now, myself, says Mr. Jones, I believe you will not blame me for turning Soldier, especially' with such a Fortune as this in my Pocket.
At which words Mr. Jones shook a Purse which had but very little in it, and which still appeared to the Landlady to have less.
the Landlady the Landlady was, (according to vulgar Phrase) struck all of a Heap by this Relation.
the Landlady answered coldly, 'That to be sure People were the best Judges what was most proper for People Circumstances.
-- But hark,' says the Landlady, 'I think I hear some body call.
Coming!
coming!
the Devil's in all our Volk, nobody has any Ears.
I must go down Stairs, if you want any more Breakfast,' the Maid will come up.
Coming!'
At which Words, without taking any Leave of his Friend the Lieutenant, Leave of his Friend the Lieutenant flung out of the Room: For the lower Sort of People are very tenacious of Respect; and though People are contented to give this gratis to Persons of Quality, yet People never confer this gratis on those of People own Order, without taking Care to be paid for People Pains.

In which the Surgeon makes the Surgeon second Appearance.
BEFORE we proceed any farther, that the Reader may not be mistaken in imagining the Landlady the Landlady knew more than the Landlady did, nor surprised that the Landlady knew so much, it may be necessary to inform him, that the Lieutenant had acquainted the Landlady that the Name of his Sophia had been the Occasion of the Quarrel; and as for the rest of the Landlady Knowledge, the sagacious Reader will observe how the Landlady came by it in the preceding Scene.
Great Curiosity was indeed mixed with the Landlady Virtues; and the Landlady never willingly suffered any one to depart from the Landlady House without enquiring as much as possible into their Names, Families and Fortunes.
the Landlady was no sooner gone, than Mr. Jones, instead of animadverting on the Landlady Behavior, reflected that Mr. Jones was in the same Bed, which Mr. Jones was informed had held his Sophia.
This occasioned a thousand fond and tender Thoughts, which we would dwell longer upon, did we not consider that such kind of Lovers will make a very inconsiderable Part of we Readers.
In this Situation the Surgeon found the Surgeon, when the Surgeon came to dress the Surgeon Wound.
The Doctor, perceiving upon Examination, that The Doctor Pulse was disordered, and hearing that The Doctor had not slept, declared that The Doctor was in great Danger: For The Doctor apprehended a Fever was coming on; which The Doctor would have prevented by bleeding, but Mr. Jones would not submit, declaring The Doctor would lose no more Blood; and 'Doctor,' says The Doctor, 'if you will be so kind only to dress a Shilling a Head, I have no Doubt of being well in a Day or two.'
'I wish,' answered the Surgeon, 'I could assure your being well in a Month or two.
Well, indeed!
No, no, People are not so soon well of such Contusions; but, Sir, I am not at this Time of Day to be instructed in my Operations by a Patient, and a insist on making a Revulsion before I dress you.'
Mr. Jones persisted obstinately in Mr. Jones Refusal, and the Doctor at last yielded; telling Mr. Jones at the same Time, that Mr. Jones would not be answerable for the ill Consequence, and hoped Mr. Jones would do Mr. Jones the Justice to acknowledge that Mr. Jones had given Mr. Jones a contrary Advice; which the Patient promised Mr. Jones would.
The Doctor retired into the Kitchen, where, addressing Mr. Jones to the Landlady, Mr. Jones complained bitterly of the undutiful Behavior of Mr. Jones Patient, who would not be blooded, though Mr. Jones was in a Fever.
'It is an eating Fever then,' says the Landlady: 'For the Landlady has devoured two swinging buttered Toasts this Morning for Breakfast.'
'Very likely,' says The Doctor, 'I have known People eat in a Fever; and it is very easily accounted for; because the Acidity occasioned by the febrile Matter, may stimulate the Nerves of the Diaphragm, and thereby occasion a Craving, which will not be easily distinguishable from a natural Appetite; but the Aliment will not be concreted, nor assimilated into Chyle, and so will corrode the vascular Orifices, and thus will aggravate the febrific Symptoms.
Indeed I think the Gentleman in a very dangerous Way, and, if the Gentleman is not blooded, I am afraid will die.'
'Every Man must die some Time or other,' answered the good Woman; 'it is no Business of mine.
I hope, The Doctor, you would not have me hold The Doctor while you bleed The Doctor.
-- But, harkee, a Word in your Ear, I would advise you before you proceed too far, to take care who is to be your Paymaster.'
'Paymaster!
said The Doctor, staring, why, I Have a the Gentleman under my Hands, have I not?'
'I imagined so as well as you,' said the Landlady; 'but as my first Husband used to say, every Thing is not what it looks to be.
my first Husband is an arrant Scrub, I assure you.
However, take no Notice that I mentioned any thing to you of the Matter; but I think People in Business often always to let one another know such Things.'
'And have I suffered such a Fellow as this,' cries The Doctor, in a Passion, 'to instruct me?
Shall I hear my Practice insulted by one who will not pay me!
I am glad I have made this Discovery in Time.
I will see now whether he will be blooded or no.'
he then immediately went up Stairs, and flinging open the Door of the Chamber with much Violence, awaked Mr. Jones Mr. Jones from a very sound Nap, into which he was fallen, and what was still worse, from a delicious dream concerning his Sophia.
'Will you be blooded or no?'
cries The Doctor, in a Rage.
'I have told you my Resolution already,' answered Mr. Jones, 'and I wish with all my Heart you had taken my answer: For you have awaked me out of the sweetest Sleep which I ever had in his Life.'
'Ay, ay,' cries The Doctor, 'many a Man has dosed away The Doctor Life.
Sleep is not always good, no more than Food; but remember I demand of you, for the last Time, will you be blooded?'
'I answer you for the last Time, said Mr. Jones, I will not.'
'Then I wash my Hands of you,' cries The Doctor, 'and I desire you to pay me for the Trouble I have had already.
Two Journeys at 5s.
each, two Dressings at 5s.
more, and half a Crown for Phlebotomy.'
'I hope,' said Mr. Jones, you don't intend to leave me in this Condition.'
'Indeed but I shall,' said the other.
'Then said Mr. Jones, you have used me rascally, and I will not pay you a farthing.'
'Very well,' cries The Doctor, 'the first Loss is the best.
What a Pox did the Landlady mean by sending for the Landlady to such Vagabonds?'
At which Words he flung out of the Room, and he Patient turned he about, soon recovered he Sleep; but he Dream was unfortunately gone.

In which is introduced one of the pleasantest Barbers that was ever recorded in History, the Barber of Bagdad, nor he in Don Quixote not excepted.
THE Clock had now struck Five, when Mr. Jones awaked from a Nap of seven Hours, so much refreshed, and in such perfect Health and Spirits, that Mr. Jones resolved to get up and dress Mr. Jones: for which Purpose Mr. Jones unlocked Mr. Jones Portmanteau, and took out clean Linen, and a Suit of Clothes; but first Mr. Jones slipped on a Frock, and went down into the Kitchen to bespeak something that might pacify certain Tumults Mr. Jones found rising within Mr. Jones Stomach.
Meeting the Landlady, Mr. Jones accosted the Landlady with great Civility, and asked 'what Mr. Jones could have for Dinner.'
'For Dinner!
says the Landlady, 'it is an odd Time a Day to think of Dinner.
There is nothing dressed in the House, and the Fire is almost out: Well but,' says Mr. Jones, 'I must have something to eat, and it is almost indifferent to Mr. Jones what: For to tell you the Truth, I never was more hungry in his Life.'
'Then,' says the Landlady, 'I believe there is a Piece of cold Buttock and Carrot, which will fit you.'
-- 'Nothing better,' answered Mr. Jones, 'but I should be obliged to Mr. Jones, if you would let it be fried.'
To which the Landlady the Landlady consented, and said smiling, 'the Landlady was glad to see Mr. Jones so well recovered:' For the Sweetness of our Hero's Temper was almost irresistible; besides, the Landlady was really no ill-humoured Woman at the Bottom; but the Landlady loved Money so much, that the Landlady hated every Thing which had the Semblance of Poverty.
Mr. Jones now returned in order to dress Mr. Jones, while Dinner Dinner was preparing, and was, according to Mr. Jones Orders, attended by the Barber.
This Barber, who went by the Name of little Benjamin, was a Fellow of great Oddity and Humor, which had frequently led Mr. Jones into small Inconveniences, such as Slaps in the Face, Kicks in the Breech, broken Bones, etc.
For every one does not understand a Jest; and those who do, are often displeased with being those who do the Subjects of it.
This Vice was, however, incurable in This Vice; and though This Vice had often smarted for it, yet if ever This Vice conceived a Joke, This Vice was certain to be delivered of it, without the least Respect of Persons, Time, or Place.
This Vice had a great many other Particularities in This Vice Character, which I shall not mention, as the Reader himself will very easily perceive a great many other Particularities in his Character, which I shall not mention, on This Vice farther Acquaintance with this extraordinary Person.
Mr. Jones being impatient to be dressed, for a Reason which may be easily imagined, thought the Shaver was very tedious in preparing This Vice Suds, and begged This Vice to make Haste; to which the other answered, with Gravity: For This Vice never discomposed This Vice Muscles on any Account.
'Festina lent is a Proverb which I learnt long before I ever touched a Razor.'
'I find, Friend, you are a Scholar,' replied Jones, 'A poor one,' said the Barber, 'non omnia possumus omnes.
Again!'
said Mr. Jones; 'I fancy you are good at capping Verses.'
Excuse me Sir,' said the Barber, 'non tanti me dignor honor.'
And then proceeding to Sir Operation, 'Sir,' said Sir, 'since I have dealt in Suds, I could never discover more than two Reasons for shaving, the one is to get a Beard, and the other to get rid of one.
I conjecture, Sir, it may not be long since you were shaved from the former of these Motives.
Upon my Word you have had good Success, for one may say of a Beard, that it is Tondenti gravior.'
'I conjecture, says Mr. Jones, that thou art a very comical Fellow.'
'You mistake me widely, Sir,' said the Barber, 'I am too much addicted to the Study of Philosophy.
Hinc illae lachrymae, Sir, that is my Misfortune.
Too much Learning has been my ruin.'
'Indeed,' says Mr. Jones, 'I confess, Friend, you have more Learning than generally belongs to your Trade; but I cannot see how it can have injured you.'
'Alas, Sir,' answered the Shaver, 'my Father disinherited me for it.
my Father was a Dancing Master; and because I could read, before I could dance, my Father took an Aversion to my Father, and left every Farthing among my Father other Children.
-- Will you please to have your Temples -- O la!
I ask your Pardon, I fancy there is Hiatus in manuscriptis.
I heard you was going to the Wars: but I find it was a Mistake.'
Why do you conclude so?'
says Mr. Jones.
Sure, Sir,' answered the Barber, 'you are too wise a Man to carry a broken Head thither; for that would be carrying Coals to Newcastle.'
'Upon my word,' cries Mr. Jones, 'thou art a very odd Fellow, and I like thy Humor extremely; I shall be very glad if thou will come to my Father after Dinner, and drink a Glass with my Father; I long to be' better acquainted with thee.
'O dear Sir,' said the Barberthe Barber, 'I can do you twenty times as great a Favor, if you will accept of twenty times.'
'What is that, my Friend,' cries Mr. Jones.
'Why, I will drink a Bottle with the Barber, if you please; for I dearly love Goodnature, and as you have found me out to be a comical Fellow, so I have no Skill in Physiognomy, if you are not one of the bestnatured Gentlemen in the Universe.'
Mr. Jones now walked down Stairs neatly dressed, and perhaps the famed Adonis was not a lovelier Figure; and yet Mr. Jones had no Charms for my Landlady: For as that good Woman did not resemble Venus at all in Woman Person, so neither did Woman in Woman Taste.
Happy had it been for Nanny the Chambermaid, if Woman had seen with the Eyes of Woman Mistress; for Woman Woman fell so violently in love with Mr. Jones in five Minutes, that Woman Passion afterward cost Woman many a Sigh.
This Nancy was extremely pretty, and altogether as coy; for Nancy had refused a Drawer, and one or two young Farmers in the Neighborhood, but the bright Eyes of our Hero thawed all This Nancy Ice in a Moment.
When Mr. Jones returned to the Kitchen, Mr. Jones Cloth was not yet laid; nor indeed was there any Occasion his Cloth should, Dinner remaining in Satu quo, as did the Fire which was to dress his Cloth.
This Disappointment might have put many a philosopical Temper into a Passion; but his Cloth had no such Effect on Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones only gave the Landlady a gentle Rebuke, saying, 'Since it was so difficult to get it heated, Mr. Jones would eat the Beef cold.'
But now the good Woman, whether moved by Compassion, or by Shame, or by whatever other Motive, I cannot tell, first gave Compassion Servants a round Scold for disobeying the Orders which Compassion had never given, and then bidding the Drawer lay a Napkin in the Sun, Compassion set about the Matter in good earnest, and soon accomplished the Drawer.
This Sun, into which Mr. Jones was now conducted, was truly named as Lucus a non lucendo; for it was an Apartment into which the Sun had scarce ever looked.
It was indeed the worst Room in the House; and happy was it for Mr. Jones that it was so.
However, Mr. Jones was now too hungry to find any Fault; but having once satisfied Mr. Jones Appetite, Mr. Jones ordered the Drawer to carry a Bottle of Wine into a better Room, and expressed some Resentment at having been shown into a Dungeon.
the Drawer the Drawer having obeyed the Drawer Commands, the Drawer was, after some Time, attended by the Barber; who would not indeed have suffered the Drawer to wait so long for the Drawer Company, had the Drawer not been listening in the Kitchen to the Landlady, who was entertaining a Circle that she had gathered round she with the History of poor Mr. Jones, Part of which she had extracted from the Drawer own Lips, and the other Part was she own ingenious Composition; 'for she said the Drawer was a poor Parish Boy, taken into the House of Squire Allworthy, where the Drawer was bred up as an Apprentice, and now turned out of Doors for the Drawer Misdeeds, particularly for making Love to the Drawer young Mistress, and probably for robbing the House; for how else should the Drawer come by the little Money the Drawer has.
And this,' says she, 'is your Gentleman, forsooth.'
'A Servant of Squire Allworthy!'
says the Barber, 'what's the Barber Name.'
-- 'Why A Servant of Squire Allworthy!'
told me his Name his Name was Mr. Jones,' says she, 'perhaps A Servant of Squire Allworthy!'
goes by a wrong Name.
Nay, and A Servant of Squire Allworthy!'
told me too, that A Servant of Squire Allworthy!'
had maintained Squire as Squire own Son, thof he had quarrelled with he now.'
'And if he be Mr. Jones, he told you the Truth,' said the Barberthe Barber; for I have Relations who live in that Country, nay, and some People say he is he Son.
'Why does he not go by the Name of he ?'
'I cannot tell that,' said the Barber, 'many People's Sons don't go by the Name of the Barber, 'many People's Sons .'
'Nay,' said the Landlady, 'if I thought the Landlady was a Gentleman's Son, thof the Landlady was a Bye Blow, I should behave to the Landlady in another guess Manner; for many of these Bye Blows come to be great Men; and, as my poor first Husband used to say, Never affront any Customer that is a Gentleman.'
CHAP.
V. A Dialogue between Mr. Jones and the Barber.
THIS Conversation passed partly while Mr. Jones was at Dinner in Mr. Jones Dungeon, and partly while Mr. Jones was expecting the Barber in the Parlour.
And, as soon as it was ended, Mr. Benjamin, as we have said, attended Mr. Jones, and was very kindly desired to sit down.
Mr. Jones then filling out a Glass of Wine, drank Mr. Jones Health by the Appellation of Doctissime Tonsorum.
Ago tibi Gratias, Domine, said the Barber, and then looking very steadfastly at Mr. Jones, the Barber said, with great Gravity, and with a seeming Surprise, as if the Barber recollected a Face the Barber had seen before, 'the Barber, may I crave the Favor to know if your Name is not Mr.
Jones?'
To which the other answered, That it was.
'Proh Deum atque Hominum Fidem,' says the Barber, 'how strangely Things come to pass.
Mr. Jones, I am your most obedient Servant, I find you do not know me, which indeed is no Wonder, since you never saw me but once, and then you was very young.
Pray, Sir, how does the good Squire Allworthy?
How does Ille optimus omnium Patronus?'
'I find,' said Mr. Jones, 'you do indeed know me; but I have not the like Happiness of recollecting you.'
-- I do not wonder at that,' cries Benjamin; 'but I am surprised I did not know you sooner, for you are not in the least altered.
And pray, Sir, may I without Offense enquire whither you are traveling this Way?
Fill a Glass of Wine, the Barber,' said Mr. Jones, 'and ask me no more Questions.'
Nay, Sir,' answered Benjamin, 'I would not be troublesome; and I hope you don't think me a Man of an impertinent Curiosity, for that is a Vice which nobody can lay to my Charge; but I ask Pardon, for when a Gentleman of your Figure travels without Pardon , we may suppose Pardon to be, as we say, in Casu incognito, and perhaps I ought not to have mentioned your Name.'
'I own,' says Mr. Jones, 'I did not expect to have been so well known in that Country as I find I am, yet, for particular Reasons, I shall be obliged to Mr. Jones if you will not mention my Name to any other Person, till I am gone from hence.'
'Pauca Verba,' answered the Barberthe Barber; 'and I wish no other here knew you but the Barber; for some People have Tongues; but I promise you I can keep a Secret.
My Enemies will allow me that Virtue.'
'And yet that is not the Characteristic of your Profession, the Barber,' answered Mr. Jones.
'Alas, Sir,' replied Benjamin, 'Non si male nunc and olim sic erat.
I was not born nor bred a Barber, I assure you.
I have spent most of my Time among Gentlemen, and though I say it, I understand something of Gentility.
And if you had thought me as worthy of your Confidence as you have some other People, I should have shown you I could have kept a a Secret better.
I should not have degraded your Name in a public Kitchen; for indeed, Sir, some People have not used you well; for besides making a public Proclamation of what you told some People of a Quarrel between yourself and Squire Allworthy, some People added Lies of some People own, Things which I knew to be Lies.
You surprise me greatly,' cries Mr.
Jones.'
'Upon my Word, Sir, answered Benjamin, 'I tell the Truth, and I need not tell you my Landlady was the Person.
I am sure it moved me to hear the Story, and I hope it is all false; for I have a great Respect for you, I do assure you I have, and have had, ever since the Goodnature you showed to Black George, which was talked of all over that Country, and I received more than one Letter about it.
Indeed it made you beloved by every body.
You will pardon me, therefore; for it was real Concern at what I heard made me ask any Questions; for I have no impertinent Curiosity about me; but I love Goodnature, and thence became Amoris abundantia ergo Te.'
Every Profession of Friendship easily gains Credit with the Miserable, it is no wonder, therefore, if Jones, who, besides his being miserable, was extremely open-hearted, very readily believed all the Professions of Benjamin, and received his into his Bosom.
The Scraps of Latin, some of which Benjamin applied properly enough, though it did not favor of profound Literature, seemed yet to indicate something superior to a common Barber, and so indeed did his whole Behavior.
Mr. Jones therefore believed the Truth of what Mr. Jones said, as to Mr. Jones Original and Education, and at length, after much Entreaty, Mr. Jones said, 'Since you have heard, my Friend, so much of my Affairs, and seem so desirous to know the Truth, if you will have Patience to hear it, I will inform you of the whole.'
'Patience,' cries Benjamin, 'that I will, if the Chapter was never so long, and I am very much obliged to Friend for the Honor you do me.'
Mr. Jones now began, and related the whole History, forgetting only a Circumstance or two, namely, every thing which passed on that Day in which Mr. Jones had fought with Thwackum, and ended with Mr. Jones Resolution to go to Sea, till the Rebellion in the North had made Mr. Jones change Mr. Jones Purpose, and had brought Mr. Jones to the Place where Mr. Jones then was.
Little Benjamin, who had been all Attention, never once interrupted the Narrative; but when the Narrative was ended, Mr. Jones could not help observing, that there must be surely something more invented by Mr. Jones Enemies, and told Mr. Allworthy against Mr. Jones, or so good a Man would never have dismissed one a Man had loved so tenderly, in such a Manner.
To which Mr. Jones answered, 'Mr.
Jones doubted not but such villainous Arts had been made use of to destroy Mr.
Jones.'
And surely it was scarce possible for any one to have avoided making the same Remark with the Barber; who had not, indeed, heard from Jones one single Circumstance upon which a Man was condemned; for a Man Actions were not now placed in those injurious Lights, in which they had been misrepresented to Allworthy: Nor could a Man mention those many false Accusations which had been from time to time preferred against a Man to Allworthy; for with none of these was he himself acquainted.
a Man had likewise, as we have observed, omitted many material Facts in a Man present Relation.
Upon the whole, indeed, every thing now appeared in such favorable Colors to Mr. Jones, that Malice it self would have found it no easy Matter to fix any Blame upon a Man.
Not that Mr. Jones desired to conceal or to disguise the Truth; nay, a Man would have been more unwilling to have suffered any Censure to fall on Mr. Allworthy for punishing Mr. Allworthy, than on Mr. Allworthy own Actions for deserving it; but, in Reality, so it happened, and so it always will happen: For let a Man be never so honest, the Account of a Man own Conduct will, in Spite of a Man, be so very favorable, that a Man Vices will come purified through a Man Lips, and, like foul Liquors well strained, will leave all their Foulness behind.
For though the Facts themselves may appear, yet so different will be the Motives, Circumstances, and Consequences, when a Man tells a Man own Story, and when a Man Enemy tells it, that we scarce can recognize the Facts to be one and the same.
Though the Barber had drank down the Story the Story with greedy Ears, the Barber was not yet satisfied.
There was a Circumstance behind, which the Barber Curiosity, cold as it was, most eagerly longed for.
Mr. Jones had mentioned the Fact of Mr. Jones Amor, and of Mr. Jones being the Rival of Blifil, but had cautiously concealed the Name of the young Lady.
the Barber the Barber therefore, after some Hesitation, and many Hums and Has, at last begged Leave to crave the Name of the Lady, who appeared to be the principal Cause of all this Mischief.
Mr. Jones paused a Moment, and then said, 'Since I have trusted you with so much, and since I am afraid, Mr. Jones Name is become too public already on this Occasion, I will not conceal Name from you.
her Name is Sophia Western.'
'Proh Deum atque Hominum Fidem!
Sophia Western has a Daughter grown a Woman!'
'Ay, and such a Woman,' cries Mr. Jones, 'that the World cannot match.
No Eye ever saw any thing so beautiful; but that is No Eye least Excellence.
Such Sense, such Goodness!
O I could praise No Eye for ever, and yet should omit half No Eye Virtues.'
'Sophia Western grown up!'
cries the Barber, 'I remember the Father a Boy; well, Tempus edax Rerum.'
The Wine being now at an End, the Barber pressed very eagerly to be the Barber Bottle; but Mr. Jones absolutely refused, saying, 'Mr.
Jones had already drank more than Mr. Jones ought; and that Mr. Jones now chose to retire to Mr. Jones Room, where Mr. Jones wished Mr. Jones could procure Mr. Jones a Book.'
'a Book!'
cries Benjamin, 'what Book would you have?
Latin or English?
I have some curious Books in both Languages.
Such as Erasmi Colloquia, Ovid de Tristibus, Gradus ad Parnassum; and in English, I have several of the best Books, though some of the best Books are a little torn; but I have a great Part of Stow's Chronicle; the sixth Volume of Pope's Homer; the third Volume of the Spectator; the second Volume of Echard's Roman History; the Craftsman; Robinson Crusoe; Thomas a Kempis, and two Volumes of Tom Brown's Works.'
'Those last,' cries Mr. Jones, 'are Books I never saw, so if you please to lend me one of those Volumes.'
the Barber the Barber assured Mr. Jones Mr. Jones would be highly entertained; for Mr. Jones looked upon the Author to have been one of the greatest Wits that ever the Nation produced.
Mr. Jones then stepped to Mr. Jones House, which was hard by, and immediately returned, after which, the Barber the Barber having received very strict Injunctions of Secrecy from Mr. Jones, and having sworn inviolably to maintain it, they separated; the Barber went home, and Mr. Jones retired to Mr. Jones Chamber.

VI.
In which more of the Talents of Benjamin will appear, as well as who this extraordinary Person was.
IN Mr. Jones grew a little uneasy at the Desertion of Benjamin Surgeon, as Benjamin apprehended some Inconvenience, or even Danger, might attend the not Dressing Benjamin Wound; Benjamin enquired therefore of the Drawer what other Surgeons were to be met with in that Neighborhood.
the Drawer told the Drawer there was one not far off; but the Drawer had known the Drawer often refuse to be concerned after another had been sent for before the Drawer; 'but, Sir,' says the Drawer, 'if you will take my Advice, there is not a Man in the Kingdom can do your Business better than the Barber.
We look upon a Man in the Kingdom to be one of the ablest Men at a Cut in all this Neighborhood.
For though a Man in the Kingdom has not been here above three Months, a Man in the Kingdom has done several great Cures.'
the Drawer was presently dispatched for little Benjamin, who being acquainted in what Capacity a Man in the Kingdom was wanted, prepared a Man in the Kingdom accordingly, and attended; but with so different an Air and Aspect from that which a Man in the Kingdom wore when a Man in the Kingdom Basin was under a Man in the Kingdom Arm, that a Man in the Kingdom could scarce be known to be the same Person.
'So, Tonsor,' says Mr. Jones, 'I find you have more Trades than one; how came you not to inform me of this last Night?
A Surgeon,' answered Benjamin, with great Gravity, 'is a Profession, not a Trade.
The Reason why I did not acquaint you last Night that I professed this Art, was that I then concluded you was under the Hands of another Gentleman, and I never love to interfere with my Brethren in Brethren Business.
Ars omnibus communis; but now, Sir, if you please, I will inspect your Head, and when I see into your Skull, I will give my Opinion of your Case.'
Mr. Jones had no great Faith in this new Professor; however Mr. Jones suffered Mr. Jones to open the Bandage, and to look at Mr. Jones Wound, which as soon as Mr. Jones had done, Benjamin began to groan and shake your Head violently.
Upon which Mr. Jones, in a peevish Manner, bid Mr. Jones not play the Fool, but tell Mr. Jones in what Condition Mr. Jones found Mr. Jones.
'Shall I answer you as a Surgeon, or a Friend?'
said Benjamin.
'As a Friend, and seriously,' said Mr. Jones.
'Why then, upon my Soul,' cries Benjamin, 'it would require a great deal of Art to keep you from being well after a very few Dressings; and if you will suffer me to apply some Salve of mine, I will answer for the Success.'
Mr. Jones gave Mr. Jones Consent, and the Plaster was applied accordingly.
'There, Sir,' cries Benjamin, 'now I will, if you please, resume my former Self; but a Man is obliged to keep up some Dignity in a Man Countenance whilst a Man is performing these Operations, or the World will not submit to be handled by a Man.
You cannot imagine, Sir, of how much Consequence a grave Aspect is to a grave Character.
A the Barber may make you laugh, but a Surgeon ought rather to make you cry.'
'Mr.
Barber, or Mr.
Surgeon, or Mr. Barber-Surgeon, said Mr.
Jones.'
-- 'O dear Sir,' answered Benjamin, interrupting Benjamin, 'Infandum Regina jubes renovare Dolorem.
You recall to my Mind that cruel Separation of the united Fraternities, so much to the Prejudice of both Bodies, as all Separations must be, according to the old Adage, Vis unita fortior; which to be sure there are not wanting some of one or of the other Fraternity who are able to construe.
What a Blow was this to me who unite both in my own Person.'
-- Well, by whatever Name you please to be called,Mr.
JonesMr.
Jones, 'you certainly are one of the oddest, most comical Fellows I ever met with, and must have something very surprising in your Story, which you must confess I have a Right to hear.'
'I do confess a Right to hear,' answered Benjamin, 'and will very readily acquaint you with a Right to hear, when you have sufficient Leisure; for I promise you a Right to hear will require a good deal of Time.'
Mr. Jones told Benjamin Mr. Jones could never be more at Leisure than at present.
'Well then,' said Benjamin, 'I will obey you; but first I will fasten the Door, that none may interrupt us.'
Benjamin did so, and then advancing with a solemn Air to Mr. Jones, said; 'I must begin by telling you, Sir, that you yourself have been the greatest Enemy I ever had.'
Mr. Jones was a little startled at this sudden Declaration.
'I your Enemy, Sir!'
says Sir, with much Amazement, and some Sternness in Sir Look.
'Nay, be not angry,' said Benjamin, 'for I promise you I am not.
You are perfectly innocent of having intended me any Wrong; for you was then an Infant; but I shall, I believe, unriddle all this the Moment I mention my Name.
Did you never hear, Sir, of that Partridgethe Honorthe Honor?'
'I have indeed heard of that Partridge,' says Mr. Jones, 'and have always believed Sir to be Mr. Jones Son.'
'Well, Sir,' answered Benjamin, 'I am that that Partridge; but I hear absolve you from all filial Duty; for I do assure you you are no Son of mine.'
'How,' replied Mr. Jones, 'and is it possible that a false Suspicion should have drawn all the ill Consequences upon you, with which I am too well acquainted?'
'It is possible,' cries Benjamin, 'for it is so; but though it is natural enough for Men to hate even the innocent Causes of Men Sufferings, yet I am of a different Temper.
I have loved you ever since I heard of your Behavior to Black George, as I told you; and am convinced from this extraordinary Meeting, that you are born to make me Amends for all I have suffered on that Account.
Besides, I dreamt, the Night before I saw you, that I stumbled over a Stool without hurting myself; which plainly showed me something good was toward myself; and last Night I dreamt again, that I rode behind you on a Milk white Mare, which is a very excellent Dream, and betokens much good Fortune, which I am resolved to pursue, unless you have the Cruelty to deny me.'
'I should be very glad, that Partridge,' answered Mr. Jones, 'to have it in my Power to make you Amends for your Sufferings on my Account; though at present I see no Likelihood of it; however, I assure you I will deny you nothing which is in my Power to grant.'
'It is in your Power sure enough,' replied Benjamin, 'for I desire nothing more than Leave to attend you in this Expedition.
Nay, I have so entirely set my Heart upon it, that if you should refuse me, you will kill both a Barber and a Surgeon in one Breath.'
Mr. Jones answered smiling, That Mr. Jones should be very sorry to be the Occasion of so much Mischief to the Public.
Mr. Jones then advanced many prudential Reasons, in order to dissuade Benjamin (whom we shall hereafter call Partridge) from Mr. Jones Purpose; but all were in vain.
that Partridge relied strongly on that Partridge Dream of the milk-white Mare.
'Besides, Sir, says Sir, I promise you, I have as good an Inclination to the Cause, as any Man can possibly have; and go I will, whether you admit me to go in your Company or not.'
Jones, who was as much pleased with that Partridge, as that Partridge could be with that Partridge, and who had not consulted that Partridge own Inclination, but the Good of the other in desiring that Partridge to stay behind; when that Partridge found that Partridge Friend so resolute, at last gave that Partridge ; but then recollecting that Partridge, that Partridge said, 'Perhaps,' that Partridge, you think I shall be able to support you, but I really am not;' and then taking out that Partridge Purse, that Partridge told out nine Guineas, which that Partridge declared were that Partridge whole Fortune.
that Partridge answered, 'that that Partridge Dependence was only on that Partridge future Favor: For that Partridge was thoroughly convinced that Partridge would shortly have enough in that Partridge Power.
At present, Sir, said Sir, I believe I am rather the richer Man of the two; but all I have is at your Service, and at your Disposal.
I insist upon your taking the whole, and I beg only to attend you in the Quality of your Servant, Nil desperandum est Teucro duce et auspice Teucro;' But to this generous Proposal concerning the Money, Mr. Jones would by no means submit.
It was resolved to set out the next Morning; when a Difficulty arose concerning the Baggage, for the Portmanteau of Mr. Jones was too large to be carried without a Horse.
'If I may presume to give my Advice,' says that Partridge, 'this Portmanteau, with every Thing in it, except a few Shirts, should be left behind.
Those I shall be easily able to carry for you, and the res^ of your Clothes will remain very safely locked up' in my House.
This Method was no sooner proposed than agreed to, and then A Barber departed, in order to prepare^ every Thing for A Barber intended Expedition.
CHAP.
VII.
Containing better Reasons than any which have yet appeared for the Conduct of that Partridge; an Apology for the Weakness of Mr. Jones; and some farther Anecdotes concerning my Landlady.
that Partridge was one of the most superstitious of Men, that Partridge would hardly, perhaps have desired to accompany Mr. Jones on this Expedition ^erely from the Omens of the Joint-stool, and white ^^are, if that Partridge Prospect had been no better than to have ^ared the Plunder gained in the Field of Battle.
In ^^ct, when that Partridge came to ruminate on the Re^^ion that Partridge had heard from Mr. Jones, that Partridge could not recon^^e to that Partridge, that Mr. Allworthy should turn that Partridge ^^n (for so that Partridge most firmly believed that Partridge to be) out of ^oors, for any Reason which that Partridge had heard assigned.
^e concluded therefore, that the whole was a Ficti^^, and that Mr. Jones, of whom that Partridge had often from that Partridge ^orrespondents heard the wildest Character, had in ^ality run away from that Partridge Father.
It came into that Partridge ^ead, therefore, that if that Partridge could prevail with the ^ung Gentleman to return back to his Father, that Partridge ^ould by that Means render a Service to Allworthy, which would obliterate all that Partridge former Anger; nay, ^^deed that Partridge conceived that very Anger was counterfeit^^, and that Allworthy had sacrificed that Partridge to that Partridge own ^eputation.
And this Suspicion, indeed, that Partridge well ac^^unted for, from the tender Behavior of that ex^^llent Man to the Foundling Child; from that ex^^llent Man great verity to Partridge, who knowing that ex^^llent Man to be in^cent, could not conceive that any other should ^^nk that ex^^llent Man guilty; lastly, from the Allowance which had privately received long after the Annuity had ^^en publicly taken from; and which that ex^^llent Man looked upon a kind of Smart-money, or rather by way of ^tonement for Injustice: For it is very uncommon, believe, for Men to ascribe the Benefactions Men ^^ceive to pure Charity, when Men can possibly im^^te Men to any other Motive.
If that ex^^llent Man could by any ^eans, therefore, persuade the ^ung Gentleman to ^^turn home, that ex^^llent Man doubted not but that that ex^^llent Man should again received into the Favor of Allworthy, and well warded for that ex^^llent Man Pains; nay, and should be again re^red to that ex^^llent Man native Country; a Restoration which Ulysses himself never wished more heartily than poor Partridge.
As for Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones was well satisfied with the Truth of what the other had asserted, and believed that that Partridge had no other Inducements but Love to Mr. Jones, and Zeal for the Cause.
A blameable Want of Caution, and Diffidence in the Veracity of others, in which Mr. Jones was highly worthy of Censure.
To say the Truth, there are but two Ways by which Men become possessed of this excellent Quality.
The one is from long Experience, and the other is from Nature; which last, I presume, is often meant by Genius, or great natural Parts; and it is infinitely the better of the two, not only as we are Masters of i^ much earlier in Life, but as it is much more infallible and conclusive: For a Man who has been imposed on by ever so many, may still hope to find others more honest; whereas a Man who has been imposed on by ever so many who receives certain necessary Admonitions from within, that this is impossible, must have very little Understanding indeed, if a Man who has been imposed on by ever so many ever renders a Man who has been imposed on by ever so many liable to be once deceived.
As Mr. Jones had not this Gift from Nature, a Man who has been imposed on by ever so many was too young to have gained it by Experience; for at the diffident Wisdom which is to be acquired this Way, we seldom arrive till very late in Life; which is perhaps the Reason why some old Men are apt to despise the Understandings of all those who are a little younger than some old Men.
Mr. Jones spent most Part of the Day in the Company of a new Acquaintance.
This was no other than the Landlord of my House, or rather the Husband of the Landlady.
rather the Husband of the Landlady had but lately made rather the Husband of the Landlady Descent down Stairs, after a long Fit of the Gout, in which Distemper rather the Husband of the Landlady was generally confined to his Room during one half of the Year; and during the rest, rather the Husband of the Landlady walked about my House, smoaked rather the Husband of the Landlady Pipe, and drank rather the Husband of the Landlady Bottle with rather the Husband of the Landlady Friends, without concerning rather the Husband of the Landlady in the least with any Kind of Business.
rather the Husband of the Landlady had ^^en bred, as they call it, a Gentleman, that is, bred ^^ to do nothing, and had spent a very small For^ne, which rather the Husband of the Landlady inherited from an industrious Farmer ^^ Uncle, in Hunting, Horse-racing, and Cock^ghting, and had been married by my Landlady for ^^tain Purposes which he had long desisted from an^^ering: for which she hated he heartily.
But as ^^ was a surly Kind of Fellow, so she contented her^^^f with frequently upbraiding he by disadvantage^s Comparisons with she first Husband, whose Praise ^e had eternally in she Mouth; and as she was for ^e most part Mistress of the Profit, so she was sa^^^fied to take upon she the Care and Government ^^ the Family, and after a long successless Struggle, ^^ suffer she to be Master of he.
In the Evening when Mr. Jones retired to Mr. Jones Room, a ^^all Dispute arose between this fond Couple concern^^g Mr. Jones.
'What,' says she, 'you have been ^tipling with the ^ung Gentleman!
I see.'
'Yes,' an^wered the Husband, 'we have cracked a Bottle together, and a very Gentleman-like Man he is, and has a very pretty Notion of Horseflesh.
Indeed ^he is young, and has not seen much of the World: For I believe ^he has been at very few Horse-races.'
O ho!
^he is one of your Order, is ^he?'
replies the ^ndlady, '^he must be a Gentleman to be sure, if ^he is a Horse-racer.
The Devil fetch such Gentry, I am sure I wish I had never seen any of The Devil fetch such Gentry.
I have Reason to love Horse-racers truly.'
'That you have, says the Husband; for I was one you know.'
'Yes, answered she, 'You are a pure one indeed.
As the Husband used to say, I may put all the Good I have ever got by she in my Eyes, and see never the worse.'
'D -- n your first Husband,' cries the Husband,' -- 'Don't d -- n a better Man than she,' answered she, 'if a better Man than yourself had been alive, you durst not have done it.'
'Then you think,' says a better Man than yourself, 'I have not so much Courage as she: For you have d -- n'd a better Man than yourself often in my Hearing.
'If I did,' says she, 'I have repented of it many's the good Time and often.
And if a better Man than yourself was so good to forgive me a Word spoken in Haste, or so, Word does not become such a one as you to twitter me.
a better Man than yourself was a Husband to me, a better Man than yourself was; and if ever I did make use of an ill Word or so in a Passion; I never called a better Man than yourself a Rascal, I should have told a Lie, if I had called a better Man than yourself a a Rascal.'
Much more a Rascal said, but not in a better Man than yourself Hearing: For having lighted a better Man than yourself , a better Man than yourself staggered off as fast as a better Man than yourself could.
We shall therefore transcribe no more of a Rascal Speech, as it approached still nearer and nearer to a Subject too indelicate to find any Place in this History.
Early in the Morning, that Partridge appeared at the Bedside of Mr. Jones, ready equipped for the Journey, with that Partridge Knapsack at that Partridge Back.
This was that Partridge own Workmanship; for besides that Partridge other Trades, that Partridge was no indifferent Tailor.
that Partridge had already put up that Partridge whole Stock of Linen in his whole Stock of Linen, consisting of four Shirts, to which that Partridge now added eight for Mr. Jones, and then packing up the Portmanteau, that Partridge was departing with it toward that Partridge own House, but was stopped in that Partridge Way by the Landlady, who refused to suffer any Removals till after the Payment of the reckoning.
the Landlady was, as we have said, absolute Governess in these Regions; it was therefore necessary to comply with the Landlady Rules, so the Bill was presently writ out, which amounted to a much large^ Sum than might have been expected, from the Entertainment which Mr. Jones had met with; but here we are obliged to disclose some Maxims, which Publicans hold to be the grand Mysteries of their Trade.
The first is, if their have any Thing good in their House (which indeed very seldom happens) to produce i^ only to Persons who travel with great Equipages 2dly, To charge the same for the very worst Provisions, as if their were the best.
And, lastly, if any of their Guests call but for little, to make their pay a double Price for every Thing their have; so that the Amount by the Head may be much the same.
the Bill the Bill being made and discharged, Mr. Jones set forward with that Partridge carrying Mr. Jones Knapsack; nor did the Landlady condescend to wish Mr. Jones a good Journey: for this was, it seems, an Inn frequented by People of Fashion; and I know not whence it is, but all those who get their Livelihood by People of Fashion, contract as much Insolence to the rest of Mankind, as if they really belonged to that Rank they.
CHAP.
VIII.
Mr. Jones arrives at Gloucester, and goes to the Bell; the Character of that House, and of a Petty-fogger, which he there meets with.
MR. Jones, and Partridge, or Little Benjamin, (which Epithet of Little was perhaps given Epithet of Little ironically, Epithet of Little being in reality near six Feet high) having left their last Quarters in the Manner before described, traveled on to Gloucester without meeting any Adventure worth relating.
Being arrived here, Gloucester chose for Gloucester House of Entertainment the Sign of the Bell, an excellent House indeed, and which I do most seriously recommend to every Reader who shall visit this ancient City.
The Master of it is Brother to the great Preacher Whitefield; but is absolutely untainted with the per^icious Principles of Methodism, or of any other heretical Sect.
Brother is indeed a very honest plain Man, and in my Opinion, not likely to create any Disturbance either in Church or State.
Brother she has I believe, had much Pretension to Beauty, and is still a very fine Woman.
she Person and Deportment might have made a shining Figure in the politest Assemblies; but though she must be conscious of this, and many other Perfections, she seems perfectly contented with, and resigned to that State of Life to which she is called; and this Resignation is entirely owing to the Prudence and Wisdom of she Temper: For she is at present as free from any methodistical Notions as a Husband.
I say at present: For she freely confesses that she Brother's Documents made at first some Impression upon she, and that she had put she to the Expense of a long Hood, in order to attend the extraordinary Emotions of the Spirit; but having found during an Experiment of three Weeks, no Emotions, she says, worth a Farthing, she very wisely laid by she Hood, and abandoned the Sect.
To be concise, she is a very friendly, good-natured Woman, and so industrious to oblige, that the Guests must be of a very morose Disposition who are not extremely well satisfied in she House.
the great Preacher Whitefield happened to be in the Yard when Mr. Jones and Mr. Jones Attendant marched in.
the great Preacher Whitefield Sagacity soon discovered in the Air of our Hero something which distinguished him from the Vulgar.
the great Preacher Whitefield ordered the great Preacher Whitefield Servants, therefore, immediately to show him into a Room, and presently afterward invited him to Dinner with the great Preacher Whitefield; which Invitation him very thankfully accepted: For indeed much less agreeable Company than that of the great Preacher Whitefield, and a^ much worse Entertainment than the great Preacher Whitefield had provided would have been welcome, after so long fasting and so long a Walk.
Besides Mr. Jones and the good Governess of the Mansion, there sat down at Table an Attorney o^ Salisbury, indeed the very same who had brought the News of Mrs. Blifil's Death to Mr. Allworthy, an^ whose Name, which, I think, we did not before mention, was Dowling; there was likewise present another Person, who styled himself a Lawyer, an^ who lived somewhere near Lidlinch in Somersetshire.
Fellow, I say, styled Fellow a Lawyer, but was indeed a most vile Petty-fogger, without Sense or Knowledge of any Kind; one of those who may be termed Train-bearers to the Law; a Sort of Supernumeraries in the Profession, who are the Hackneys of Attorneys, and will ride more Miles for half a Crown, than a Post-boy.
During the time of Dinner, the Somersetshire Lawyer recollected the Face of Jones, which the Somersetshire Lawyer had seen at Mr Allworthy's: For the Somersetshire Lawyer had often visited in that Gentleman's Kitchen.
the Somersetshire Lawyer therefore took Occasion to enquire after the good Family there, with that Familiarity which would have become an intimate Friend or Acquaintance of Mr Allworthy's; and indeed the Somersetshire Lawyer did all in the Somersetshire Lawyer Power to insinuate the Somersetshire Lawyer to be such, though the Somersetshire Lawyer had never had the Honor of speaking to any Person in the good Family there higher than the Butler.
Mr. Jones answered all Mr. Jones Questions with much Civility, though Mr. Jones never remembered to have seen the Pettyfogger before, and though Mr. Jones concluded from the outward Appearance and Behavior of the Man, that Mr. Jones usurped a Freedom with Mr. Jones Betters, to which Mr. Jones was by no means entitled.
As the Conversation of Fellows of this Kind, is of all others the most detestable to Men of any Sense, the Cloth was no sooner removed than Mr. Jones withdrew, and a little barbarously left poor Mrs. Whitefield to do a Penance, which I have often heard Mr. Timothy Harris, and other Publicans of good Taste, lament, as the severest Lot annexed to Mr. Timothy Harris, and other Publicans of good Taste, lament Calling, namely, that of being obliged to keep Company with Mr. Timothy Harris, and other Publicans of good Taste, lament Guests.
Mr. Jones had no sooner quitted the Room, than the Petty-fogger, in a whispering Tone, asked the great Preacher Whitefield, 'if the great Preacher Whitefield knew who that fine Spark was?'
the great Preacher Whitefield answered, 'the great Preacher Whitefield had never seen the Gentleman before.
The Gentleman, indeed!'
replied the Petty-fogger, 'a pretty the Gentleman truly!
Why, the Petty-fogger is the Bastard of a Fellow who was hanged for Horse-stealing.
the Petty-fogger was dropped at Mr Allworthy's's Door, where one of her Servants found the Petty-fogger in a Box so full of Rainwater, that the Petty-fogger would certainly have been drowned, had the Petty-fogger not been reserved for another Fate.'
Ay, ay, you need not mention it, I protest, we understand what that Fate is very well,' cried Dowling, with a most facetious Grin.
'Well,' continued the other, 'the Squire ordered the Petty-fogger to be taken in: For the Petty-fogger is a timbersome Man every Body knows, and was afraid of drawing the Petty-fogger into a Scrape, and there the Bastard was bred up, and fed and cloathified all to the World like any the Gentleman: and there the Petty-fogger got one of the Servant Maids with Child, and persuaded the Servant Maids with Child to swear it to the Squire himself; and afterward the Petty-fogger broke the Arm of one Mr. Thwackum a Clergyman, only because the Petty-fogger reprimanded the Petty-fogger for following Whores; and afterward the Petty-fogger snapt a Pistol at Mr. Blifil behind Mr. Blifil Back; and once when Mr Allworthy's was sick, Mr Allworthy's got a Drum, and beat it all over the House, to prevent Mr Allworthy's from sleeping: And twenty other Pranks Mr Allworthy's has played, for all which, about four or five Days ago, just before I left the Country, the Squire himself the Squire himself stripped Mr Allworthy's stark naked, and turned Mr Allworthy's out of Doors.
'And very justly too, I protest,' cries Dowling, 'I would turn Mr Allworthy's out of Doors, if Mr Allworthy's was guilty of half as much.
And pray what is the' Name of the Gentleman?
'The Name o'un!'
answered Petty-fogger, 'why, Petty-fogger is a called Thomas Jones.'
Jones!'
answered cries Dowling, a little eagerly, 'what, a called Thomas Jones, that lived at Mr Allworthy's's!
was that the Gentleman that dined with us?'
'The very same,' said the other.
'I have heard of the Gentleman,' cries cries Dowling, 'often, but I never heard any ill Character of cries Dowling.'
'And I am sure,' says the great Preacher Whitefield, 'if half what the Gentleman the Gentleman has said be true, '  Jones has the most deceitful Countenance I ever saw; for sure '  Jones Looks promise something very different; and I must say, for the little I have seen of '  Jones, '  Jones is as civil a well-bred Man as you would wish to converse with.'
Pettyfogger calling to mind that Pettyfogger had not been sworn, as Pettyfogger usually was, before Pettyfogger gave Pettyfogger Evidence, now bound what Pettyfogger had declared with so many Oaths and Imprecations, that the Lady's Ears were shocked, and the Lady put a Stop to Pettyfogger swearing, by assuring Pettyfogger of the Lady Belief.
Upon which Pettyfogger said, 'I hope, the Lady, you imagine I would scorn to tell such Things of any Man, unless I knew such Things of any Man to be true.
What Interest have I in taking away the Reptutation of a Man who never injured me?
I promise you every Syllable of what I have said is Fact, and the whole Country knows it.'
As the great Preacher Whitefield had no Reason to suspect that Pettyfogger had any Motive or Temptation to abuse Mr. Jones, Reader cannot blame the great Preacher Whitefield for believing what he so confidently affirmed with many Oaths.
the great Preacher Whitefield accordingly gave up the great Preacher Whitefield Skill in Physiognomy, and henceforwards conceived so ill an Opinion of the great Preacher Whitefield Guest, that the great Preacher Whitefield heartily wished him out of her House.
This Dislike was now farther increased by a Report which the great Preacher Whitefield made from the Kitchen, where Partridge had informed the Company, 'That though Partridge carried the Knapsack, and contented Partridge with staying among Servants, while Tom Jones (as Partridge called Partridge) was regaling in the Parlour, Partridge was not Partridge Servant, but only a Friend and Companion, and as good a the Gentleman as a called Thomas Jones.'
cries Dowling sat all this while silent, biting cries Dowling Fingers, making Faces, grinning, and looking wonderfully arch; at last cries Dowling opened cries Dowling Lips, and protested that the Gentleman the Gentleman looked like another Sort of Man.
cries Dowling then called for cries Dowling Bill with the utmost Haste, declared cries Dowling must be at Hertford that Evening, lamenting cries Dowling great Hurry of Business, and wished cries Dowling could divide cries Dowling into twenty Pieces, in order to be at once in twenty Places.
The Pettyfoggar now likewise departed, and then Mr. Jones desired the Favor of the great Preacher Whitefield's Company to drink Tea with Mr. Jones; but Mrs. Whitefield's Company refused, and with a Manner so different from that with which Mrs. Whitefield's Company had received cries Dowling at Dinner, that it a little surprised cries Dowling.
And now cries Dowling perceived Mrs. Whitefield's Company Behavior totally changed; for instead of that natural Affability which we have before celebrated, Mrs. Whitefield's Company wore a constrained Severity on Mrs. Whitefield's Company Countenance, which was so disagreeable to a called Thomas Jones, that a called Thomas Jones resolved, however late, to quit the House that Evening.
a called Thomas Jones did indeed account somewhat unfairly for this sudden Change; for besides some hard and unjust Surmises concerning Female Fickleness and Mutability, a called Thomas Jones began to suspect that a called Thomas Jones owed this want of Civility to a called Thomas Jones Want of Horses, a Sort of Animals which, as they dirty no Sheets, are thought in Inns, to pay better for they Beds than they Riders, and are therefore considered as the more desirable Company; but Mrs. Whitefield, to do Mrs. Whitefield's Company Justice, had a much more liberal Way of thinking.
Mrs. Whitefield's Company was perfectly wellbred, and could be very civil to a the Gentleman, though a called Thomas Jones walked on Foot: In Reality, Mrs. Whitefield's Company looked on our Hero as a sorry Scoundrel, and therefore treated a sorry Scoundrel as such, for which not even Jones himself, had a sorry Scoundrel known as much as Reader, could have blamed Mrs. Whitefield's Company; nay, on the Contrary, a sorry Scoundrel must have approved Mrs. Whitefield's Company Conduct, and have esteemed Mrs. Whitefield's Company the more for the Disrespect shown toward a sorry Scoundrel.
This is indeed a most aggravating Circumstance which attends unjustly depriving Men of Men Reputation; for a Man who is Conscious of having an ill Character, cannot justly be angry with those who neglect and slight a sorry Scoundrel; but ought rather to despise those that affect a sorry Scoundrel Conversation, unless where a perfect Intimacy must have convinced Men that Men Friend's Character has been falsely and injuriously aspersed.
This was not, however, the Case of Mr. Jones; for as Mr. Jones was a perfect Stranger to the Truth, so Mr. Jones was with good Reason offended at the Treatment Mr. Jones received.
Mr. Jones therefore paid Mr. Jones Reckoning and departed, highly against the Will of Mr. Partridge, who having remonstrated much against it to no Purpose, at last condescended to take up Mr. Jones Knapsack, and to attend Mr. Jones Friend.
CHAP.
IX.
Containing several Dialogues between Mr. Jones and Partridge, concerning Love, Cold, Hunger, and other Matters; with the lucky and narrow Escape of Partridge, as Mr. Jones was on the very Brink of making a fatal Discovery to his Friendhis Friend.
THE Shadows began now to descend larger from the high Mountains: The feathered Creation had betaken The feathered Creation to The feathered Creation Rest.
Now the highest Order of Mortals were sitting down to The feathered Creation Dinners, and the lowest Order to The feathered Creation Suppers.
In a Word, the Clock struck five just as '  Jones took '  Jones Leave of Gloucester; an Hour at which (as it was now Midwinter) the dirty Fingers of Night would have drawn her sable Curtain over the Universe, had not the Moon forbid her, who now with a Face as broad and as red as those of some jolly Mortals, who, like her, turn Night into Day, began to rise from her Bed, where her had slumbered away the Day, in order to sit up all Night.
Mr. Jones had not traveled far before Mr. Jones paid Mr. Jones Compliments to that beautiful Planet, and turning to Mr. Jones Companion, asked Mr. Jones, If Mr. Jones had ever beheld so delicious an Evening.
Partride making no ready Answer to Mr. Jones Question, Mr. Jones proceeded to comment on the Beauty of the Moon, and repeated some Passages from Milton, who has certainly excelled all other Poets in Mr. Jones Description of the heavenly Luminaries.
Mr. Jones then told Partridge the Story from the Spectator, of Those LoversThose Lovers Those Lovers , at a certain fixed Hour, to look at the Moon; thus pleasing Those Lovers with the Thought that Those Lovers were both employed in contempiating the same Object at the same Time.
'Those Lovers,' added Mr. Jones, 'must have had Souls truly capable of feeling all the Tenderness of the sublimest of all human Passions.'
'Very probably,' cries Partridge, 'but I envy them more if them had Bodies incapable of feeling cold; for I am almost frozen to Death, and am very much afraid I shall lose a Piece of my Nose before we get to another House of Entertainment.
Nay, truly, we may well expect some Judgment should happen to we for we Folly in running away so by Night from one of the most excellent Inns I ever set my Foot into.
I am sure I never saw more good Things in my Life, and the greatest Lord in the Land cannot live better in the greatest Lord in the Land own House than the greatest Lord in the Land may there.
And to forsake such a House, and go a rambling about the Country, the greatest Lord in the Land knows whither, per devia rura viarum, I say nothing for my Part; but some People might not have Charity enough to conclude we were in we sober Senses.'
'Fie upon it, Partridge the Story,' says Mr. Jones, 'have a better Heart; consider you are going to face an Enemy, and are you afraid of facing a little Cold?
I wish indeed we had a Guide to advise which of these Roads we should take.'
'May I be so bold,' says Partridge the Story, 'to offer my Advice; Interdum Stultus opportuna loquitur.'
'Why, which of them.'
cries Mr. Jones, 'would you recommend?'
'Truly neither of them,' answered Partridge the Story.
'The only Road we can be certain of finding, is the Road we came.
A good hearty Pace will bring we back to Gloucester in an Hour; but if we go forward, the Lord Harry knows when we shall arrive at any Place; for I see at least fifty Miles before me, and no House in all the Way.'
'You see, indeed, a very fair Prospect,' says Mr. Jones, 'which receives great additional Beauty from the extreme Luster of the Moon.
However, I will keep the Left Hand Track, as that seems to lead directly to those Hills, which we were informed lie not far from Worcester.
And here, if you incline to quit me; you may, and return back again!
but for my Part, I am resolved to go forward.'
'It is unkind in you, Sir,' says Partridge the Story, 'to suspect me of any such Intention.
What I have advised has been as much on your Account as on my own; but since you are determined to go on, I am as much determined to follow.'
I prae, sequar te.
They now traveled some Miles without speaking to each other, during which Suspense of Mr. Jones often sighed, and Benjamin groaned as bitterly, though from a very different Reason.
At length Mr. Jones made a full Stop, and turning about, cries, 'Who knows, Partridge, but the loveliest Creature in the Universe may have Mr. Jones Eyes now fixed on that very the Moon which I behold at this Instant!'
'Very likely, Sir, answered Partridge the Story, and if her Eyes her Eyes were fixed on a good Surloin of roast Beef, the Devil might take the the Moon and Partridge the Story Horns into the Bargain.'
Did ever Tramontane make such an Answer,' cries Mr. Jones?
'Prithee, Partridge, wast thou never susceptible of Love in thy Life, or has Time worn away all the Traces of it from thy Memory?'
'Alack-a-day,Partridge the Story, well would it have been for me if I had never known what Love was.
Infandum Regina jubes renovare 'Dolorem.
I am sure I have tasted all the Tenderness and Sublimities and Bitternesses of the Pason.'
'Was your Mistress unkind then?'
says Mr. Jones.
'Very unkind indeed, Sir,' answered Partridge the Story; 'for Partridge the Story married me, and made one of the most confounded Wives in the World.
However, Heaven be praised, Partridge the Story is gone, and if I believed Partridge the Story was in the Moon, according to a Book I once read, which teaches that to be the Receptacle of departed Spirits, I would never look at it for fear of seeing Partridge the Story; but I wish, Sir, that the Moon the Moon was a Looking-glass for your Sake, and that Miss Sophia Western was now placed before it.'
'My dear Partridge,' cries Mr. Jones, 'what a Thought was there!
A thought which I am certain could never have entered into any Mind but that of a Lover.
O Partridge the Story, could I hope once again to see that Face; but, alas!
all those golden Dreams are vanished for ever, and my only Refuge from future Misery is to forget the Object of all my former Happiness.'
'And do you really despair of ever seeing Mifs Western again?'
answered Partridge the Story; 'if you will follow my Advice I will engage you shall not only see Partridge the Story, but have Partridge the Story in your Arms.'
'Ha!
do not awaken a Though of that Nature,' cries Mr. Jones.
'I have struggled sufficiently to conquer all such Wishes already.
'Nay, answered Partridge the Story, 'if you do not wish to have your Mistress in your Arms, you are a most extraordinary Lover indeed.'
Well, well,' says Mr. Jones, 'let us avoid this Subject; but pray what is your Advice?'
'To give this Subject you in the military Phrase then,' says Partridge the Story,' as us are Soldiers, To the Right about.'
'Let us return the Way us came, us may yet reach Gloucester to Night though late; whereas if us proceed, us are likely, for ought I see, to ramble about for ever with out coming either to House or Home.'
I have already told you my Resolution is to go on,' answered Mr. Jones; 'but I would have you go back.
I am obliged to Mr. Jones for your company hither, and I beg you to accept a Guinea as a small Instance of my Gratitude.
Nay, it would be cruel in me to suffer you to go any farther; for to deal plainly with Mr. Jones, my chief End and Desire is a glorious Death in the Service of my King and Country.'
'As for your Money,' replied Partridge, 'I beg, Sir, you will put it up; I will receive none of Sir at this Time; for at present I am, I believe, the richer Man of the two.
And as your my Resolution is to go on, so mine is to follow you if you do.
Nay, now my presence appears absolutely necessary to take Care of Sir, since your Intentions are so desperate, for I promise you my Views are much more prudent: As you are resolved to fall in Battle, if you can, so I am resolved as firmly to come to no Hurt if I can help it.
And indeed I have the Comfort to think there will be but little Danger; for a Popish Priest told me the other Day, the Business would soon be over, and a Popish Priest believed without a Battle.'
A popish Priest,' cries Mr. Jones, 'I have heard, is not always to be believed when Mr. Jones speaks in Behalf of Mr. Jones Religion.'
'Yes, but so far,' answered the other, 'from speaking in Behalf of his Religionhis Religion, Mr. Jones assured me, the Catholics did not expect to be any Gainers by the Change; for that Prince Charles was as good a Protestant as any in England; and that nothing but Regard to Right made Prince Charles and the rest of the popish Party to be Jacobites.'
'I believe Prince Charles to be as much a Protestant as I believe Prince Charles has any Right,' says Mr. Jones, 'and I make no Doubt of the Catholics Success, but not without a Battle.
So that I am not so sanguine as your Friend the popish Priest.'
'Nay, to be sure, Sir,' answered Parridge, 'all the Prophecies I have ever read, speak of a great deal of Blood to be spilt in the Quarrel, and the Miller with three Thumbs, who is now alive, is to hold the Horses of three Kings, up to his Knees in Blood.
Lord have Mercy upon us all, and send better Times!'
'With what Stuff and Nonsense have thou filled thy Head,' answered Mr. Jones?
This too, I suppose, comes from a Popish Priest.
Monsters and Prodigies are the proper Arguguments to support monstrous and absurd Doctrines.
The Cause of King George is the Cause of Liberty and true Religion.
In other Words, it is the Cause of common Sense, my Boy, and I warrant you will succeed, though Briareus himself was to rise again with Briareus himself hundred Thumbs, and to turn Miller.'
Partridge the Story made no Reply to this.
Partridge the Story was indeed cast in the utmost Confusion by this Declaration of Mr. Jones.
For to inform the Reader of a Secret, which we had no Opportunity of revealing before, Partridge the Story was in Truth a Jacobite, and had concluded that Mr. Jones was of the popish Party, and was now proceeding to join the Rebels.
An Opinion which was not without Foundation.
For the tall long-sided Dame, mentioned by Hudibras; that many-eyed, many-tongued, many-mouthed, many-eared Monster of Virgil, had related the Story of the Quarrel between Mr. Jones and the Officer, with her usual Regard to Truth.
her had indeed changed the Name of Sophia into that of the Pretender, and had reported, that drinking Mr. Jones Health was the Cause for which Mr. Jones was knocked down.
Partridge the Story had heard, and most firmly believed.
It Is no Wonder, therefore, that Partridge the Story had thence entertained the abovementioned Opinion of Mr. Jones; and which Partridge the Story had almost discovered to Mr. Jones before Mr. Jones found out Mr. Jones own Mistake.
And at this the Reader will be the less inclined to wonder, if Mr. Jones pleases to recollect the doubtful Phrase in which Mr. Jones first communicated Mr. Jones Resolution to Partridge the Story; and, indeed, had the Words been less ambiguous, Partridge the Story might very well have construed Partridge the Story as Partridge the Story did; being persuaded, as Partridge the Story was, that the whole Nation were of the same Inclination in Partridge the Story Hearts: Nor did it stagger him that Mr. Jones had traveled in the Company of Soldiers; for him had the same Opinion of the Army which him had of the rest of People.
But however well affected him might be to James or Charles, him was still much more attached to Benjamin than to either: for which Reason him no sooner discovered the Principles of him Fellow-traveller, than him thought proper to conceal, and outwardly to give up him own to the Man on whom him depended for the making him Fortune, since him by no means believed the Affairs of Mr. Jones to be so desperate as the Affairs of Jones really were with Mr. Allworthy; for as him had kept a constant Correspondence with some of him Neighbors since him left that Country, him had heard much, indeed more than was true, of the great Affection Mr. Allworthy bore this young Man, who, as Partridge the Story had been instructed, was to be that Gentleman's Heir, and whom, as we have said, Mr. Allworthy did not in the least doubt to be Mr. Allworthy Son.
Mr. Allworthy imagined, therefore, that whatever the Quarrel was between them, it would be certainly made up at the Return of Mr. Jones; an Event from which Mr. Jones promised great Advantages, if Mr. Jones could take this Opportunity of ingratiating Mr. Jones with that young Gentleman; and if Mr. Jones could by any Means be instrumental in procuring Mr. Jones Return, Mr. Jones doubted not, as we have before said, but it would as highly advance Mr. Jones in the Favor of Mr. Allworthy.
we have already observed, that Mr. Jones was a very good-natured Fellow, and Mr. Jones has Mr. Jones declared the violent Attachment Mr. Jones had to the Person and Character of Mr. Jones; but possibly the Views which I have just before mentioned, might likewise have some little Share in prompting Mr. Jones to undertake this Expepedition, at least in urging Mr. Jones to continue it, after Mr. Jones had discovered, that Mr. Jones Master and Mr. Jones, like some prudent Fathers and Sons, though his Master and himself traveled together in great Friendship, had embraced opposite Parties.
I am led into this Conjecture, by having remarked, that though Love, Friendship, Esteem, and such like, have very powerful Operations in the human Mind; Interest, however, is an Ingredient seldom omitted by wise Men, when wise Men would work others to wise Men own Purposes.
This is indeed a most excellent Medicine, and like Ward's Pill, flies at once to the particular Part of the Body on which you desire to operate, whether it be the Tongue, the Hand, or any other Member, where it scarce ever fails of immediately producing the desired Effect.
CHAP.
X.
In which our Travelers meet with a very extraordinary Adventure.
JUST as Mr. Jones and Mr. Jones Friend came to the End of Jones and his Friend Dialogue in the preceding Chapter, Jones and his Friend arrived at the Bottom of a very steep Hill.
Here Mr. Jones stopped short, and directing Mr. Jones Eyes upwards, stood for a while silent.
At length Mr. Jones called to Mr. Jones Companion, and said, 'Partridge the Story, I wish I was at the Top of this Hill; the Top of this Hill must certainly afford a most charming Prospect, especially by this Light: For the solemn Gloom which the Moon casts on all Objects, is beyond Expression beautiful, especially to an Imagination which is desirous of cultivating melancholy Ideas.'
Very probably,' answered Partridge the Story; 'but if the Top of this Hill be properest to produce melancholy Thoughts, I suppose the Bottom of a very steep Hill is the likeliest to produce merry ones, and these I take to be much the better of the two.
I protest you have made my Blood run cold with the very mentioning the Top of that Mountain; which seems to me to be one of the highest in the World.
No, no, if we look for any thing, let it be for a Place under Ground, to screen we from the Frost.
-- Do so, said Mr. Jones, let it be but within Hearing of this Place, and I will hollow to Mr. Jones at my Return back.'
'Surely, Sir, you are not mad,' said Partridge the Story.
'Indeed I am,' answered Mr. Jones, 'if ascending this Hill be Madness: But as you complain so much of the cold already, I would have you stay below.
I will certainly return to Mr. Jones within an Hour.'
Pardon me, Sir,' cries Partridge, I have determined to follow you wherever you go.'
Indeed he was now afraid to stay behind; for though he was Coward enough in all Respects, yet he chief Fear was that of Ghosts, with which the present Time of Night, and the Wildness of this Place, extremely well suited.
At Partridge the Story espied a glimmering Light through some Trees, which seemed very near to them.
he immediately cried out in a Rapture, 'Oh, Sir!
Heaven has at last heard my Prayers, and has brought us to a House; perhaps it may be an Inn.
Let me beseech you, Sir, if you have any Compassion either for me or yourself, do not despise the the Goodness of Providence, but let us go directly to yon Light.
Whether it be a Publick-house or no, I am sure if they be Christians that dwell there, they will not refuse a little House-room to Persons in us miserable Condition.'
Jones at length yielded to the earnest Supplications of Partridge the Story, and both together made directly toward the Place whence the Light issued.
both soon arrived at the Door of this House or Cottage: For it might be called either, without much Impropriety.
Here Mr. Jones knocked several Times with-receiving any Answer from within; at which Partridge, whose head was full of nothing but of Ghosts, Devils, Witches, and such like, began to tremble, crying 'Lord have Mercy upon us, sure the People must be all dead.
I can see no Light neither now, and yet I am certain I saw a Candle burning but a Moment before -- Well!
I have heard of such Things.
-- What have thou heard of,' said Mr. Jones.
the People are either fast asleep, or probably as this is a lonely Place, are afraid to open the People Door.'
Mr. Jones then began to vociferate pretty loudly, and at last an old Woman opening an upper Casement, asked who the People were, and what the People wanted?
Mr. Jones answered, 'the People were Travelers who had lost the People Way, and having seen a Light in the Window, had been led thither in Hopes of finding some Fire to warm the People.'
Whoever, you are,' cries the Woman, 'you have no Business here; nor shall I open their Door to any body a this Time of Night.'
Partridge, whom the Sound of a human Voice had recovered from his Fright, fell to the most earnest Supplications to be admitted for a few Minutes to the Fire, saying, 'his was almost dead with the Cold,' to which Fear had indeed contributed equally with the Frost.
his assured the Woman, that the Gentleman who spoke to the Woman, was one of the greatest Squires in the Country, and made use of every Argument save one, which Mr. Jones afterward effectually added, and this was the Promise of half a Crown.
A Bribe too great to be resisted by such a Person, especially as the genteel Appearance of Jones, which the Light of the Moon plainly discovered to the Woman, together with his affable Behavior, had entirely subdued those Apprehensions of Thieves which the Woman had at first conceived.
the Woman agreed, therefore, at last to let them in, where Partridge, to Partridge infinite Joy, found a good Fire ready for Partridge Reception.
The poor Fellow, however, had no sooner warmed The poor Fellow, than those Thoughts which were always uppermost in The poor Fellow Mind, began a little to disturb The poor Fellow Brain.
There was no Article of The poor Fellow Creed in which The poor Fellow had a stronger Faith, than The poor Fellow had in Witchcraft, nor can the Reader conceive a Figure more adapted to inspire this Idea, than the old Woman, who now stood before The poor Fellow.
the Woman answered exactly to that Picture drawn by Otway, in The poor Fellow Orphan.
Indeed if the Woman the Woman had lived in the Reign of James the First, the Woman Appearance alone would have hanged the Woman, almost without any Evidence.
Many Circumstances likewise conspired to confirm Partridge the Story in Partridge the Story Opinion.
the Woman living, as he then imagined, by the Woman in so lonely a Place; and in a House, the Outside of which seemed much too good for the Woman; but where the Inside was furnished in the most neat and elegant Manner.
To say the Truth, Mr. Jones was not a little surprised at what Mr. Jones saw: For, besides the extraordinary Neatness of the Room, it was adorned with a great Number of Nicknacks, and Curiosities, which might have engaged the Attention of a Virtuoso.
While Mr. Jones was admiring these Things, and Partridge the Story sat trembling with the firm Belief that Partridge the Story was in the House of a Witch, the Woman said, 'I hope, Gentlemen, you will make what Haste you can; for I expect my Master presently, and I would not for double the Money Partridge the Story should find you here.'
'Then you have a Master,' cries Mr. Jones; indeed you will excuse me, good the Woman, but I was surprised to see all those fine Things in a Housea House.'
'Ah, Sir!'
said the Woman, 'if the twentieth Part of these Things were the Woman, I should think the Woman a rich the Woman; but pray, Sir, do not stay much longer: For I look for Sir in every Minute.'
-- 'Why sure Sir would not be angry with Gentlemen,' said Mr. Jones, 'for doing a common Act of Charity.
Alack-a-day, Sir,' said the Woman, 'Sir is a strange Man, not at all like other People.
Sir keeps no Company with any Body, and seldom walks out but by Night, for Sir does not care to be seen; and all the Country People are as much afraid of meeting Sir; for Sir Dress is enough to frighten those who are not used to it.
those who are not used to it call Sir, The Man of this Hill (for there Sir walks by Night) and the People are not, I believe, more afraid of the Devil himself.
Sir would be terribly angry if Sir found you here.'
'Pray, Sir,' says Partridge the Story, 'don't let Pray, Sir offend the Gentleman, I am ready to walk, and was never warmer in my Life.
-- Do, pray Sir, let Pray, Sir go -- here are Pistols over the Chimney; who knows whether they be charged or no, or what the Gentleman may do with they.'
'Fear nothing, Partridge the Story,' cries Mr. Jones, 'I will secure thee from Danger.'
-- 'Nay, for Matter of that, the Gentleman never does any Mischief,' said the Woman; 'but to be sure it is necessary the Gentleman should keep some Arms for the Gentleman own Safety: for the Gentleman a House has been beset more than once, and it is not many Nights ago, that we thought we heard Thieves about it: for my own Part, I have often wondered that the Gentleman is not murdered by some Villain or other, as the Gentleman walks out by the Gentleman at such Hours; but then as I said, the People are afraid of the Gentleman, and besides the People think, I suppose, the Gentleman has nothing about the Gentleman worth taking.'
'I should imagine, by this Collection of Rarities,' cries Mr. Jones, that my Master had been a Traveller.'
'Yes, Sir,' answered the Woman, 'Sir has been a very great one; there be few Gentlemen that know more of all Matters than Sir; I fancy Sir has been crossed in Love, or whatever it is, I know not, but I have lived with Sir above these thirty Years, and in all that Time Sir has hardly spoke to six living People.'
the Woman then again solicited six living People Departure, in which the Woman was backed by Partridge the Story; but Mr. Jones purposely protracted the time: For Mr. Jones Curiosity was greatly raised to see this extraordinary Person.
Though the Woman, therefore, concluded every one of the Woman Answers with desiring Mr. Jones to be gone, and Partridge the Story proceed so far as to pull Mr. Jones by the Sleeve, Mr. Jones still continued to invent new Questions, till the old Woman with an affrighted Countenance, declared the Woman heard the Woman my Master's Signal; and at the same Instant more than one Voice was heard without their Door, ^rying, 'D -- n your Blood, show us your Money this Instant.
Your Money, you Villain, or us will blow your Brains about your Ears.
'O, good Heaven!'
cries the Woman.
'Some Villains, to be sure, have attacked my Master.
O la!
what shall I do?
what shall I do?'
'How, cries Mr. Jones, how -- Are these Pistols loaded?'
'O, Sir, there is nothing in 'How, cries Jones, indeed -- O, pray don't murder us, Gentlemen,' (for in reality the Woman now had the same Opinion of those within, as the Woman had for those without.)
Mr. Jones made the Woman no Answer; but snatching an old Broad-sword which hung ^n the Room, Mr. Jones instantly sallied out, where Mr. Jones found the Gentleman struggling with two Ruffians, and begging for Mercy.
Mr. Jones asked no Questions, but ^ell so briskly to work with Mr. Jones Broad-sword, that the Fellows immediately quitted the Fellows Hold, and without offering to attack our Hero, betook the Fellows to the Fellows Heels, and made the Fellows Escape; for Mr. Jones did not attempt to pursue the Fellows, being contented with having delivered the Gentleman; and indeed Mr. Jones concluded Mr. Jones had pretty well done the Fellows Business: For both of the Fellows, as both of them ran off, cried out with bitter Oaths, that both of them were dead Men.
Mr. Jones presently ran to lift up the old Gentleman, who had been thrown down in the Scuffle, expressed ^t the same Time great Concern, lest Mr. Jones should have ^eceived any Harm from the Villians.
The old Man ^ared a Moment at Mr. Jones, and then cried, -- 'No, Sir, no, I have very little Harm, I thank you.
Lord have mercy upon The old Man.'
'I see Sir,' said ^ones, 'you are not free from Apprehensions even of those who have had the Happiness to be your Deliverers; nor can I blame any Suspicions which you may have; but indeed, you have no real Occasion for any; here are none but your Friends present.
Having mist our Way this cold Night, our took the Liberty of warming our at your Fire, whence our were just departing when our heard you call for Assistance, which I must say, Providence alone seems to have sent you.'
-- 'Providence indeed,' cries the Gentleman, 'if it be so.'
-- 'So it is, I assure you,' cries Mr. Jones, 'here is your own Sword, Sir.
I have used your own Sword, Sir in your Defense, and I now return your own Sword, Sir into your own Hand.'
The old Man having received the Sword, which was stained with the Blood of The old Man Enemies, looked steadfastly at Mr. Jones during some Moments, and then with a Sigh, cried out, 'You will pardon me, the Gentleman, I was not always of a suspicious Temper, nor am I a Friend to Ingratitude.'
'Be thankful then,' cries Mr. Jones, 'to that Providence to which you owe your Deliverance; as to my Part, I have only discharged the common Duties of Humanity, and what I would have done for any Fellow Creature in your Situation.'
Let me look at you a little longer,' cries the Gentleman -- 'You are a human Creature then?
-- 'Well, perhaps, you are.
Come, pray walk into my little Hutt.
You have been my' Deliverer indeed.
the Woman was distracted between the Fears which the Woman had of my Master, and for him; and Partridge the Story was, if possible, in a greater Fright.
The former of these, however, when the Woman heard my Master speak kindly to Mr. Jones, and perceived what had happened, came again to the Woman; but Partridge the Story no sooner saw the Gentleman, than the Strangeness of his Dress infused greater Terrors into that poor Fellow, than Partridge the Story had before felt either from the strange Description which Partridge the Story had heard, or from the Uproar which had happened at their Door.
To say the Truth, it was an Appearance which might have affected a more constant Mind than that of Partridge the Story.
This Person was of the tallest ^ize, with a long Beard as white as Snow.
a long Beard as white as Snow Bo^y was clothed with the Skin of an Ass, made something into the Form of a Coat.
a long Beard as white as Snow wore likewise Boots on a long Beard as white as Snow Legs, and a Cap on a long Beard as white as Snow Head, both composed of the Skin of some other Animals.
As soon as the Gentleman came into his House, ^he old Woman began old Woman Congratulations on the Gentleman hap^y Escape from the Ruffins.
'Yes,' cries the Gentleman, 'I have escaped indeed, Thanks to my Preserver.'
O the Blessing on the Gentleman,' answered old Woman, 'the Gentleman is a good Gentleman, I warrant the Gentleman.
I was afraid your Worship would have been angry with the Gentleman for letting the Gentleman in; and to be certain I should not have done it, had not I seen by the Moonlight, that the Gentleman was a the Gentleman, and almost frozen to Death.
And to be certain it must have been some good Angel that sent the Gentleman hither, and tempted me to do it.
'I am afraid, Sir,' said the Gentleman to ^ones, 'that I have nothing in this House which you can either eat or drink, unless you will accept a Dram of Brandy; of which I can give you some most excellent, and which I have had by the Gentleman these thirty Years.'
Mr. Jones declined this Offer in a very ^ivil and proper Speech, and then the other asked Mr. Jones 'Whither Mr. Jones was traveling when Mr. Jones mist Mr. Jones Way; saying, I must own the Gentleman surprised to see such a Person as you appear to be journeying on Foot at this Time of Night.
I suppose, the Gentleman, you are a the Gentleman of these Parts: for you do not look like one who is used to travel far without Horses.
'Appearances,' cried Mr. Jones, 'are often deceitful; Men sometimes look like what Men are not.
I assure you, I am not of this Country, and whither I am traveling, in reality I scarce know the Gentleman.
'Whoever you are, or whithersoever you are going, answered The old Man, I have Obligations to' you which I can never return.
'I once more,' replied Mr. Jones, 'affirm, that you have none: For there can be no Merit in having hazarded that in your Service on which I set no Value.
And nothing is so contemptible in my Eye^' as Life.
'I am sorry, young Gentleman,' answered the Stranger, 'that you have any Reason to be so unhappy' at your Years.
'Indeed I am, Sir,' answered Mr. Jones, 'the mo^^ unhappy of Mankind.'
-- 'Perhaps you have ha^ a Friend, or a Mistress,' replied the other.
'Ho^ could you,' cries Mr. Jones, 'mention two Words sufficient to drive me to Distraction?'
'Either of ther^ are enough to drive any Man to Distraction,' answered The old Man.
'I enquire no farther, Sir Perhaps my Curiosity has led me too far already.'
'Indeed, Sir, cries Mr. Jones, 'I cannot censure Passion, which I feel at this Instant in the highe^ Degree.
You will pardon me, when I assure you that every Thing which I have seen or heard sin^^ I first entered this House, has conspired to raise the greatest Curiosity in The old Man.
Something very extraordinary must have determined you to this Cour^ of Life, and I have reason to fear your own History' is not without Misfortunes.'
Here the Gentleman again sighed, and remained silent for some Minutes; at last, looking earnest on Mr. Jones, the Gentleman said, 'I have read that a good Count^nance is a Letter of recommendation; if so, no^ ever can be more strongly recommended than your self.
If I did not feel some Yearnings towar^ you from another Consideration, I must be the mo^^ ungrateful Monster upon Earth; and I am real^^ concerned it is no otherwise in my Power, than' Words, to convince you of my Gratitude.'
Jones after a Moment's Hesitation, answered, 'That it was in his Power by Words to gratify his extremely.
I have confessed a Curiosity, said he, Sir; need I say how much obliged I should be to he, Sir, if you would condescend to gratify it?
Will you suffer me therefore to beg, unless any Consideration restrains you, that you would be pleased to acquaint me what Motives have induced you thus to withdraw from the Society of Mankind, and to betake yourself to a Course of Life to which it sufficiently' appears you was not born?
'I scarce think he, Sir at Liberty to refuse you any thing, after what has happened,' replied The old Man, 'If you desire therefore to hear the Story of an unhappy Man, I will relate it to The old Man.
Indeed you judge rightly, in thinking there is commonly something extraordinary in the Fortunes of those who fly from Society: For however it may seem a Paradox, or even a Contradiction, certain it is that great Philanthropy chiefly inclines us to avoid and detest Mankind; not on Account so much of their private and selfish Vices, but for those of a relative Kind; such as Envy, Malice, Treachery, Cruelty, with every other Species of Malevolence.
These are the Vices which true Philanthropy abhors, and which rather than see and converse with, she avoids Society itself.
However, without a Compliment to you, you do not appear to me one of those whom I should shun or detest; nay, I must say, in what little has dropped from you, there appears some Parity in our Fortunes; I hope however you will conclude more successfully.'
Here some Compliments passed between our Hero and Hero Host, and then the latter was going to begin Hero History, when Partridge the Story interrupted Hero.
Hero Apprehensions had now pretty well left Hero; but some Effects of Hero Terrors remained; Hero therefore reminded the Gentleman of that excellent Brandy which Hero had mentioned.
This was presently brought, and Partridge the Story swallowed a large Bumper.
the Gentleman, without any farther Preface, began as you may read in the next Chapter.

In which the Man of the Hill begins to relate the Man of the Hill .
'I Was born in a Village of Somersetshire, called Mark, in the Year 1657; my Father was one of those whom those whom they call Gentlemen Farmers call Gentlemen Farmers.
the Man of the Hill had a little Estate of about 300l.
a Year of the Man of the Hill own, and rented another Estate of near the same Value.
the Man of the Hill was prudent and industrious, and so good a Husbandman, that the Man of the Hill might have led a very easy and comfortable Life, had not an errant Vixe^ of a Wife soured the Man of the Hill domestic Quiet.
But tho this Circumstance perhaps made the Man of the Hill miserable, i^ did not make the Man of the Hill poor: For the Man of the Hill confined i^ almost entirely at Home, and rather chose to bear eeternal Upbraidings in the Man of the Hill own House, than to injur^ the Man of the Hill Fortune by indulging i^ in the Extravagancie^' i^ desired abroad.
'By this Xantippe (so was the Wife of Socrate^ called, said Partridge the Story) 'By this Xantippe he had two Sons, of which I was the younger.
he designe^ to give us both good Educations; but my elde^^ Brother, who, unhappily for he, was the Favourit^ of my Mother, utterly neglected he Learning insomuch that after having been five or six Years a^ School with little or no Improvement, my Father being told by he , that it would be to n^^ Purpose to keep he longer there, at last complie^ with my Mother in taking he home from the Hand of that Tyrant, as my Mother called he Master; thoug^^ indeed he gave the Lad much less Correction tha^ he Idleness deserved, but much more, it seem than the Gentleman the Gentleman liked, who constantly complained to he Mother of he severe Treatment,' and my Mother as constantly gave he a Hearing.
"Yes, yes,' cries Partridge the Story, 'I have seen such Mothers; I have been abused he by Mothers, and very unjustly; such Parents deserve Correction' as much as Mothers Children.
Mr. Jones chid the Pedagogue for this Interruption, and then the Stranger proceeded.
'My Brother now at the Age of fifteen, bid adieu to all Learning, and to every Thing else but to My Brother now at the Age of fifteen Dog and Gun, with which latter My Brother now at the Age of fifteen became so expert, that, though perhaps you may think it incredible, My Brother now at the Age of fifteen could not only hit a standing Mark with great Certainty; but has actually shot a Crow as it was flying in the Air.
My Brother now at the Age of fifteen was likewise excellent at finding a Hare sitting, and was soon reputed one of the best Sportsmen in this Country.
A Reputation which both My Brother now at the Age of fifteen and My Brother now at the Age of fifteen enjoyed as much as if My Brother now at the Age of fifteen had been thought the finest Scholar.
'The Situation of his elder Brother made me at first think my Lot the harder, in being continued at School; but I soon changed my Opinion; for as I advanced pretty fast in Learning, my Labors became easy, and my Exercise so delightful, that Holidays were my most unpleasant Time: For my Mother, who never loved me, now apprehending that I had the greater Share of my Father's Affection, and finding, or at least thinking, that I was more taken Notice of by some Gentlemen of Learning, and particularly by the Parson of the Parish, than his elder Brother, his elder Brother now hated my Sight, and made Home so disagreeable to me, that what is called by Schoolboys Black Monday, was to me the whitest in the whole Year.
'Having, at length, gone through the School at Taunton, I was thence removed to Exeter College in Oxford, where I remained four Years at the End of which an Accident happened, that put a final End to my Studies, and whence I may truly date the Rise of all which happened to me afterward in Life.'
'There was at the same College with me one Sir George Gresham, a young Fellow who was entitled to a very considerable Fortune; which he was not, by the Will of he , to come into full Possession of till he arrived at the Age of Twenty-five.
However, the Liberality of he Guardians gave he little Cause to regret the abundant Caution of he : for they allowed he Five hundred Pound a Year while he remained at the University, where he kept he Horses and he Whore, and lived as wicked and as profligate a Life, as he could have done, had he been never so entirely Master of he ; for besides the Five hundred a Year which he received from his Guardians, he found Means to spend a thousand more.
he was above the Age of Twenty-one, and had no Difficulty of gaining what Credit he pleased.'
'This young Fellow, among many other tolerable bad Qualities, had one very diabolical.
This young Fellow had a great Delight in destroying and ruining the Youth of inferior Fortune, by drawing them into Expenses which them could not afford so well as This young Fellow; and the better, and worthier, and soberer, any young Man was, the greater Pleasure and Triumph had This young Fellow in This young Fellow Destruction.
Thus acting the Character which is recorded of the Devil, and going about seeking whom This young Fellow might devour.'
'It was my Misfortune to fall into an Acquaintance and Intimacy with the Gentleman.
My Reputation of Diligence in my Studies made me a desirable Object of This young Fellow mischievous Intention; and my own Inclination made it sufficiently easy for This young Fellow to effect This young Fellow Purpose; for though I had applied myself with much Industry to Books, in which I took great Delight, there were other Pleasures in which I was capable of taking much greater; for I was high-mettled, had a violent Flow of animal Spirits, was a little ambitious, and extremely amorous.'
'I had not long contracted an Intimacy with Sir George, before I became a Partaker of all Sir George Pleasures; and when I was once entered on that Scene, neither my Inclination, nor my Spirit, would suffer me to play an Under-Part.
I was second to none of the Company in any Acts of Debauchery: nay, I soon distinguished myself so notably in all Riots and Disorders, that my Name generally stood first in the Roll of Delinquents, and instead of being lamented as the unfortunate Pupil of Sir George, I was now accused as the Person who had misled and debauched that the Gentlemanthe Gentleman; for though the Gentleman was the Ringleader and Promoter of all the Mischief, the Gentleman was never so considered.
I fell at last under the Censure of the Vice Chancellor, and very narrowly escaped Expulsion.
'You will easily believe, myself, that such a Life, as I am now describing must be incompatible with my further Progress in Learning; and that in Proportion as I addicted myself more and more to loose Pleasure, I must grow more and more remiss in Application to my Studies.
This was truly the Consequence; but This was not all.
My Expenses now greatly exceeded not only my former Income, but those Additions which I extorted from my Father, by Pretenses of Sums necessary for preparing for my approaching Degree of Bachelor of Arts.
These Demands, however, grew at last so frequent and exorbitant, that my Father, by slow Degrees, opened his Ears to the Accounts which his received from many Quarters of my present Behavior, and which my Mother Mother failed not to echo very faithfully and loudly; adding, 'Ay, this is the fine Gentleman, the Scholar who does so much Honor to so much Honor Family, and is to be the making of it.
I thought what all so much Honor Learning would come to.
so much Honor is to be the Ruin of us all, I find, after so much Honor elder Brother has been denied Necessaries for his elder Brother Sake, to perfect his elder Brother Education forsooth, for which his elder Brother was to pay us such Interest; I thought what the Interest would come to:" with much more of the same Kind; but I have, I believe, satisfied you with this Taste.'
'my Father, therefore, began now to return Remonstrances, instead of Money, to my Demands, which brought my Affairs, perhaps a little sooner to a Crisis; but had my Affairs remitted me my Affairs whole Income, you will imagine it could have sufficed a very short Time to support one who kept Pace with the Expenses of Sir George Gresham.
'It is more than possible, that the Distress I was now in for Money, and the Impracticability of going on in this Manner, might have restored me at once to my Senses, and to my Studies, had I opened my Eyes, before I became involved in Debts, from which I saw no Hopes of ever extricating my Father.
This was indeed the great Art of Sir George, and by which Sir George accomplished the Ruin of many, whom Sir George afterward laughed at as Fools and Coxcombs, for vying as Sir George called it, with a Man of Sir George .
To bring this about, Sir George would now and then advance a little Money himself, in order to support the Credit of the unfortunate Youth with other People; till, by Means of that very Credit, Sir George was irretrievably undone.'
'My Mind being by these Means, grown as desperate as his Fortune, there was scarce a Wickedness which I did not meditate, in order for my Relief.
Self-murder itself became the Subject of my serious Deliberation; and I had certainly resolved on Self-murder itself, had not a more shameful, though perhaps less sinful, Thought, expelled Self-murder itself from my Head.'
Here Sir George hesitated a Moment, and then cried out, 'I protest, so many Years have not washed away the Shame of this Act, and I shall blush while I relate this Act.
'Mr.
Jones desired Mr. Jones to pass over any thing that might give Mr. Jones pain in the Relation;' but Partridge eagerly cried out, 'O pray, myself, let us hear this, I had rather hear this than all the rest; as I hoped to be saved, I will never mention a Word of this.'
Mr. Jones was going to rebuke Mr. Jones, but the Stranger the Stranger prevented this by proceeding thus.
'I had a Chum, a very prudent frugal young Lad, who, though Mr. Jones had no very large Allowance, had by Mr. Jones Parsimony heaped up upwards of forty Guineas, which I knew Mr. Jones kept in Mr. Jones Escritore, I took therefore an Opportunity of purloining Mr. Jones Key from Mr. Jones Breeches Pocket while Mr. Jones was asleep, and thus made Mr. Jones Master of all Mr. Jones Riches.
After which I again conveyed his Key into his Breeches Pocket, and counterfeiting Sleep, though I never once closed my Eyes, lay in Bed till after Mr. Jones arose and went to Prayers, an Exercise to which I had long been unaccustomed.'
'Timorous Thieves, by extreme Caution, often subject Timorous Thieves, by extreme Caution to Discoveries, which those of a bolder Kind escape.
Thus it happened to Mr. Jones; for had I boldly broke open his Escritorehis Escritore.
I had, perhaps, escaped even his Escritore Suspicion; but as it was plain that the Person who robbed his Escritore had possessed his Escritore of his Key, his Escritore had no Doubt, when his Escritore first missed his Escritore Money, but that his Escritore Chum was certainly the Thief.
Now as his Escritore was of a fearful Disposition, and much my Inferior in Strength, and, I believe, in Courage, his Escritore did not dare to confront me with my Guilt, for fear of worse bodily Consequences which might happen to his Escritore.
his Escritore repaired therefore immediately to the Vice Chancellor, and, upon swearing to the Robbery, and to the Circumstances of it, very easily obtained a Warrant against one who had now so bad a Character through the whole University.'
'Luckily for one who had now so bad a Character through the whole University I lay out of the same College with myself the next Evening; for that Day I attended a young Lady in a Chaise to Whitney, where we staid all Night; and in we Return the next Morning to Oxford, I met one of my Cronies, who acquainted me with sufficient News concerning one who had now so bad a Character through the whole University to make me turn my Horse another Way.'
'myself, did myself mention any thing of the Warrant,' said Partridge?
But Mr. Jones begged the Gentleman the Gentleman to proceed without regarding any impertinent' Questions; which Mr. Jones did as follows.
'Having now abandoned all Thoughts of returning to Oxford, the next Thing which offered itself was a Journey to London.
I imparted this Intention to my female Companion, who at first remonstrated against this Intention, but upon producing my Wealth, a young Lady immediately consented.
we then struck across the Country into the great Cirencester Road, and made such Haste, that we spent the next Evening (save one) in London.'
'When you consider the Place where I now was, and the Company with whom I was, you will, I fancy, conceive that a very short Time brought me to an End of that Sum of which I had so iniquitously' possessed myself.
'I was now reduced to a much higher Degree of Distress than before; the Necessaries of Life began to be numbered among my Wants; and what made my Case still the more grievous, was, that my Paramour, of whom I was now grown immoderately fond, shared the same Distresses with myself.
To see a Woman you love in Distress; to be unable to relieve a Woman you love in Distress, and at the same Time to reflect that you have brought a Woman you love in Distress into this Situation, is, perhaps, Curse of which no Imagination can represent the Horrors to those who have not felt it.'
I believe it from my Soul,' cries Mr. Jones, 'and I pity you from the Bottom of my Heart.'
Mr. Jones then took two or three disorderly Turns about the Room, and at last begged Pardon, and flung Mr. Jones into Mr. Jones Chair, crying, 'I thank Heaven I have escaped that.'
'This Circumstance,' continued the Gentleman, 'so severely aggravated the Horrors of my present Situation, that they became absolutely intolerable.
I could with less Pain endure the raging of my own natural unsatisfied Appetites, even Hunger or Thirst, than I could submit to leave ungratified the most whimsical Desires of a Woman, on whom I so extravagantly doated, that though I knew a Woman had been the Mistress of half my Acquaintance, I firmly intended to marry a Woman.
But the good Creature was unwilling to consent to an Action which the World might think so much to my Disadvantage.
And as, possibly, a Woman compassionated the daily Anxieties which a Woman must have perceived me suffer on a Woman Account, a Woman resolved to put an End to my Distress.
a Woman soon, indeed, found Means to relieve me from my troublesome and perplexed Situation: For while I was distracted with various Inventions to supply a Woman with Pleasures, a Woman very kindly -- betrayed me to one of a Woman former Lovers at Oxford, by whose Care and Diligence I was immediately apprehended and committed to Goal.'
'Here I first began seriously to reflect on the Miscarriages of my former Life; on the Errors I had been guilty of; on the Misfortunes which I had brought on myself; and on the Grief which I must have occasioned to one of the best of Fathers.
When I added to all these the Perfidy of my Mistress, such was the Horror of my Mind, that Life, instead of being longer desirable, grew the Object of my Abhorrence, and I could have gladly embraced Death, as my dearest Friend, if it had offered it to my Choice unattended by Shame.'
'The Time of the Assizes soon came, and I was removed by Habeas Corpus to Oxford, where I expected certain Conviction and Condemnation; but, to my great Surprise, none appeared against myself, and I was, at the End of the Sessions, discharged for Want of Prosecution.
In short, his Chum had left Oxford, and whether from Indolence, or from what other Motive, I am ignorant, had declined concerning his Chum any farther in the Affair.'
'Perhaps,' cries Partridge, 'his Chum did not care to have your Blood upon his Chum Hands, and his Chum was in the right on it.
If any Person was to be hanged upon my Evidence, I should never be able to lie alone afterward, for Fear of seeing his Chum Ghost.'
'I shall shortly doubt, Partridge,' says Mr. Jones, 'whether thou art more brave or wise.
'You may laugh at myself, myself, if you please,' answered Partridge, 'but if you will hear a very short Story which I can tell, and which is most certainly true, perhaps you may change your Opinion.
In the Parish where I was born -- Here Mr. Jones would have silenced Mr. Jones, but the Stranger interceded that Mr. Jones might be permitted to tell StoryStory, and in the mean time promised to recollect the Remainder of Mr. Jones own.
Partridge then proceeded thus.
'In the Parish where I was born, there lived a Farmer whose Name was Bridle, and a Farmer whose Name was Bridle had a Son named Francis a good hopeful young Fellow; I was at the Grammar School with a Son named Francis a good hopeful young Fellow, where I remember a Son named Francis a good hopeful young Fellow wa^ got into Ovid's Epistles, and a Son named Francis a good hopeful young Fellow could construe yo^ three Lines together sometimes without looking into a Dictionary.
Besides all this, a Son named Francis a good hopeful young Fellow was a very goo^ Lad, never missed Church of Sundays, and was rec+ koned one of the best Psalm-Singers in the whole Parish.
a Son named Francis a good hopeful young Fellow would indeed now and then take a Cup too much, and that was the only Fault a Son named Francis a good hopeful young Fellow had.'
-- Well, but come to his Ghost.'
cries Mr. Jones.
'Never fear, myself, I shall come to Mr. Jones soon enough,' answered Partridge.
'You must know then, that Farmer Bridle lost a Mare, a sorrel one to the best of my Remembrance, and so it fell out, that this young Francis shortly afterward being at a Fair at Hindon, and as I think it was on -- I cannot remember the Day; and being as this young Francis was, what should this young Francis happen to meet, but the Man.
Frank called out presently, Stop Thief; and it being in the Middle of the Fair, it was impossible, you know, for the Man to make the Man Escape.
So they apprehended the Man, and carried the Man before the Justice, I remember it was Justice Willoughby of Noyle, a very worthy good Gentleman, and the Man committed the Man to Prison, and bound Frank in a Recognizance, I think they call it, a hard Word compounded of re and cognosco, but it differs in it Meaning from the Use of the Simple, as many other Compounds do.
Well, at last, down came my Lord Justice Page to hold the Assizes, and so Fellow was had up, and Frank was had up for a Witness.
To be sure I shall never forget the Face of the Judge, when Fellow begun to ask Fellow what Fellow had to say against the Prisoner.
Fellow made poor Frank tremble and shake in Fellow Shoes.
Well, FellowFellow, says my Lord, what have you to say?
Don't stand humming and hawing, but speak out; but however Fellow soon turned altogether as civil to Frank, and began to thunder at Fellow; and when Fellow asked Fellow, if Fellow had any Thing to say for Fellow, Fellow said Fellow had found the Horse.
Ay!'
answered the Judge, 'thou art a lucky Fellow; I have traveled the Circuit these forty Years, and never found a the Horse in my Life; but I Will tell thee what, Friend, thou wast more lucky than thou did know of: For thou did not only find a the Horse; but a Halter too, I promise thee.
To be sure I shall never forget the Word.
Upon which every Body fell a laughing, as how could they help it.
Nay, and twenty other Jests he made which I cannot remember now.
There was something about he Skill in Horse Flesh, which made all the Folks laugh.
To be certain the Judge must have been a very brave Man, as well as a Man of much Learning.
It is indeed charming Sport to hear Trials upon Life and Death.
One Thing I own I thought a little hard, that the Prisoner's Counsel was not suffered to speak for the Prisoner's Counsel, though the Prisoner's Counsel desired only to be heard one very short Word; but my Lord would not hearken to the Prisoner's Counsel, though the Prisoner's Counsel suffered a Counselor to talk against the Prisoner's Counsel for above half an Hour.
I thought it hard, I own, that there should be so many of them; my Lord, and the Court, and the Jury, and the Counselors, and the Witnesse^ all upon one poor Man, and Man too in Chains* Well, Fellow was hanged, as to be sure it could be no otherwise, and Frank Frank could never be easy about it.
Frank never was in the dark alone, bu^ Frank fancied Frank saw Fellow's Spirit.
Well, and is this thy Story, cries Mr. Jones?
No, no, answered Partridge, 'O Lord have Mercy upon Partridge, -- I am just now coming to the Matter; for one Night coming from the Alehouse in a long narrow dar^ Lane, there Partridge ran directly up against Mr. Jones, and the Fellow's Spirit was all in white and fell upon Frank, and Frank who is a sturdy Lad, fell upon the Fellow's Spirit again, and there they had a Tussel together, Frank Frank was dreadfully beat; indeed Frank made ^ shift at last to crawl Home, but what with the beating, and what with the Fright, Frank lay ill above Fortnight; and all this is most certainly true, and the whole Parish will bear Witness to the whole Parish.'
the Stranger smiled at Story, and Mr. Jones burst into a loud Fit of Laughter, upon which Partridge cried, 'Ay, you may laugh, myself, and so did some others, particularly a Squire, who is thought to be no better than an Atheist; who forsooth, because there was a Calf with a white Face found dead in the same Lane the next Morning, would fain have it, that the Battle was between Frank and that, as if a Calf would set upon a Man.
Besides, Frank told me Frank knew it to be a the Fellow's Spirit, and could swear to Frank in any Court in Christendom, and Frank had not drank above a Quart or two, or such a Matter of Liquor at the time.
Lud have Mercy upon us, and keep us from dipping us Hands in Blood, I say.'
'Well, myself,' said Mr. Jones to the Stranger, 'Partridge has finished StoryStory, and I hope will give you no future Interruption, if you will be so kind to proceed.
Partridge then resumed Partridge Narration; but as Partridge has taken Breath for a while, us think proper to give a while to us Reader, and shall therefore put an End to this Chapter.'
CHAP.
XII.
In which the Man of the Hill continues the Man of the Hill History.
'I Had now regained my Liberty, said the Stranger, but I had lost my Reputation; for there is a wide Difference between the Case of a Man who is barely acquitted of a Crime in a Court of Justice, and of a Man who is barely acquitted of a Crime in a Court of Justice who is acquitted in a Man who is barely acquitted of a Crime in a Court of Justice own Heart, and in the Opinion of the People.
I was conscious of my Guilt, and ashamed to look any one in the Face, so resolved to leave Oxford the next Morning, before the Daylight discovered me to the Eyes of any Beholders.'
'When I had got clear of the City, the City first entered into my Head to return Home to my Father, and endeavor to obtain my Head Forgiveness; but as I had no Reason to doubt my Head Knowledge of all which had past, and as I was well assured of my Head great Aversion to all Acts of Dishonesty, I could entertain no Hopes of being received by my Head, especially since I was too certain of all the good Offices in the Power of my Mother: Nay, had my Father's Pardon been as sure, as I conceived my Head Resentment to be, I yet question whether I could have had the Assurance to behold my Head, or whether I could, upon any Terms, have submitted to live and converse with those, who, I was convinced, knew me to have been guilty of so base an Action.'
'I hastened therefore back to London, the best Retirement of either Grief or Shame, unless for Persons of a very public Character; for here you have the Advantage of Solitude without the Advantage of Solitude Disadvantage, since you may be alone and in Company at the same Time; and while you walk or sit unobserved, Noise, Hurry, and a constant Succession of Objects, entertain the Mind, and prevent the Spirits from preying on themselves, or rather on Grief or Shame, which are the most unwholesome Diet in the World; and on which (though there are many who never taste either but in public) there are some who can feed very plentifully, and very fatally when alone.'
'But as there is scarce any human Good without its concommitant Evil, so there are People who find an Inconvenience in this unobserving Temper of Mankind; I mean Persons who have no Money; for as you are not put out of Countenance, so neither are you clothed or fed by those who do not know you.
And a Man may be as easily starved in Leadenhall Market as in the Deserts of Arabia.'
'It was at present my Fortune to be destitute of that great Evil, as It is apprehended to be by several Writers, who I suppose were over burdened with It, namely, Money.'
"With Submission, myself, said Partridge, I do not remember any Writers who have called it Malorum; but Irritamenta Malorum.
Effodiuntur opes irritamenta Malorum."
Well, myself, continued the Stranger, whether it be an Evil, or only the Cause of Evil, I was entirely void of it, and at the same Time of Friends, and as I thought of Acquaintance; when one Evening as I was passing through the Inner Temple, very hungry and very miserable, I heard a Voice on a suden haling me with great Familiarity by my Christian Name; and upon my turning about, I presently recollected the Person who so saluted me, to have been my Fellow Collegiate; one who had left the University above a Year, and long before any of my Misfortunes had befallen me.
This Gentleman, whose Name was Watson, shook me heartily by the Hand, and expressing great Joy at meeting me, proposed our immediately drinking a Bottle together.
I first declined the Proposal, and pretended Business; but as he was very earnest and pressing, Hunger at last overcame my Pride, and I fairly confessed to he I had no Money in my Pocket; yet not without framing a Lie for an Excuse, and imputing no Money to my having changed my Breeches that Morning.
Mr. Watson answered, I thought Jack, you and I had been too old Acquaintance for you to mention such a Matter.
Jack then took me by the Arm and was pulling me along; but I gave Jack very little Trouble, for my own Inclinations pulled me much stronger than Jack could do.'
'our then went into the Friars, which you know is the Scene of all Mirth and Jollity.
Here when our arrived at the Tavern, Mr. Watson applied Mr. Watson to the Drawer only, without taking the least Notice of the Cook; for Mr. Watson had no Suspicion, but that I had dined long since.
However, as the Case was really otherwise, I forged another Falsehood, and told my Companion, I had been at the further End of the City on Business of Consequence, and had snapt up a Mutton Chop in Haste, so that I was again Hungry, and wished Mr. Watson would add a Beef Steak to Mr. Watson .'
'Some People, cries Partridge, 'ought to have good Memories, or did you find just Money enough in your Breeches to pay for the Mutton Chop?'
'Your Observation is right,' answered the Strangerthe Stranger, 'and I believe such Blunders are inseparable from all dealing in Untruth.
-- But to proceed -- I began now to feel myself extremely happy.
The Meat and Wine soon revived my Spirits to a high Pitch, and I enjoyed much Pleasure in the Conversation of my old Acquaintance, the rather, as I thought my old Acquaintance entirely ignorant of what had happened at the University since my old Acquaintance leaving' the University.
'But my old Acquaintance did not suffer me to remain long in this agreeable Delusion; for taking a Bumper in one Hand, and holding me by the other, "Here, my Boy," cries my old Acquaintance, "here is wishing you Joy of your being so honorably acquitted of that Affair laid to your Charge."
'I was Thunderstruck with Confusion at these Words, which Mr. Watson observing, proceeded thus -- Nay, never be ashamed, Man; thou have been acquitted, and no one now dares call thee guilty; but prithee do tell me, who am thy Friend, I hope thou did really rob Man; for rat me if it was not a meritorious Action to strip such a sneaking pitiful Rascal, and instead of the two hundred Guineas, I wish you had taken as many thousand.
Come, come, my Boy, don't be shy of confessing to me, you are not now brought before one of the Pimps.
D -- n me, if I don't honor you for D --; for as I hope for Salvation, I would have made no manner of Scruple of doing the same Thing.'
'This Declaration a little relieved my Abashment, and as Wine had now somewhat opened my Heart, I very freely acknowledged the Robbery, but acquainted the Robbery that the Robbery had been misinformed as to the Sum taken, which was little more than a fifth Part of what the Robbery had mentioned.'
'I am sorry for it with all my Heart, quoth the Robbery, and I wish thee better Success another Time.
Though if you will take my Advice, you shall have no Occasion' to run any such Risque.
Here, said the Robbery, (taking some Dice out of the Robbery ) 'here's the Stuff.
Here are the Implements; here are the little Doctors which cure the Distempers of the Purse.
Follow but my Counsel, and I will show you a Way to empty the Pockets of a Queer Cull, without any Danger of the Nubbing Cheat.'
'Nubbing Cheat,' cries Partridge, 'Pay, myself, what is that?'
'Why that, myself,' says the Stranger, 'is a Cant Phrase for the Gallows; for as Gamesters differ little from Highwaymen in Highwaymen Morals, so do they' very much resemble they in they Language.
'We had now each drank We , when Mr. Watson said, the Board was sitting, and that Mr. Watson must attend, earnestly pressing me, at the same Time, to go with Mr. Watson and try my Fortune.
I answered, Mr. Watson knew that was at present out of my Power, as I had informed Mr. Watson of the emptiness of my Pocket.
To say the Truth, I doubted not, from Mr. Watson many strong Expressions of Friendship, but that Mr. Watson would offer to lend me a small Sum for that Purpose; but Mr. Watson answered, "Never mind' that, Man, even boldly run a Levant; (Partridge was going to enquire the Meaning of that Word; but Jones stopped Jones Mouth;) 'but be circumspect as to Mr. Watson.
I will tip you the proper Person, which may be necessary, as you do not know the Town, nor can distinguish a Rum Cull from a Queer one.'
'The Bill was now brought, when Mr. Watson paid Mr. Watson Share, and was departing.
I reminded Mr. Watson, not without blushing, of my having no Money.'
Mr. Watson answered, 'That signifies nothing, score it behind the Door, or make a bold Brush, and take no Notice -- Or -- stay," says Mr. Watson, "I will go down Stairs first, and then do you take up my Money, and score the whole Reckoning at the Bar, and I will wait for you at the Corner."
'I expressed some Dislike at this, and hinted my Expectations that Mr. Watson would have deposited the whole; but Mr. Watson swore Mr. Watson had not another Sixpence in Mr. Watson .'
'Mr.
Watson then went down, and I was prevailed on to take up my Money and follow Mr. Watson, which I did close enough to hear Mr. Watson tell the Drawer the Reckoning was upon the Table.
the Drawer the Drawer passed by you up Stairs; but I made such Haste into the Street, that I heard nothing of Mr. Watson Disappointment, nor did I mention a Syllable at the Bar according to my Instructions.'
'We now went directly to the Gaming Table, where Mr. Watson, to my Surprise, pulled out a large Sum of my Money, and placed before Mr. Watson, as did many others; all of many others, no doubt, considering many others own Heaps as so many decoy Birds, which were to entice and draw over the Heaps of' their own Heaps Neighbors.
'Here it would be tedious to relate all the Freaks which Fortune, or rather the Dice, played in this her Temple.
Mountains of Gold were in a few Moments reduced to nothing at one Part of the Table, and rose as suddenly in another.
The rich grew in a Moment poor, and the Poor as suddenly became rich: so that it seemed a Philosopher could no where have so well instructed Philosopher Pupils in the Contempt of Riches, at least Philosopher could no where have better inculcated the Incertainty of their Duration.'
'For my own Part, after having considerably improved my small Estate, I at last entirely demolished having considerably improved my small Estate.
Mr. Watson too, after much Variety of Luck, rose from the Table in some Heat, and declared Philosopher had lost a cool hundred, and would play no longer.
Then coming up to Mr. Watson, Philosopher asked me to return with Philosopher to the Tavern; but I positively refused, saying, I would not bring Mr. Watson a second Time into such a Dilemma, and especially as Philosopher had lost all Philosopher Money, and was now in my own Condition.'
Pooh," says Philosopher, "I have just borrowed a couple of Guineas of a Friend; and one of a couple of Guineas of a Friend is at your Service."
'Philosopher immediately put one of a couple of Guineas of a Friend into my Hand, and I no longer resisted Philosopher Inclination.'
'I was at first a little shocked at returning to the same House whence we had departed in so unhandsome a Manner; but when the Drawer, with very civil Address, told we, "Philosopher believed we had forgot to pay we Reckoning," I became perfectly easy, and very readily gave Philosopher a Guinea, bid Philosopher pay Philosopher, and acquiesced in the unjust Charge which had been laid on my Memory.'
'Mr.
Watson now bespoke the most extravagant Supper Mr. Watson could well think of, and though Mr. Watson had contented Mr. Watson with simple Claret before, nothing but the most precious Burgundy would serve the most precious Burgundy Purpose.'
'Our Company was soon increased by the Addition of several Gentlemen from the Gaming-Table; most of whom, as I afterward found, came not to the Tavern to drink, but in the Way of Business: for the true Gamesters pretended to be ill, and refused their Glass, while their plied heartily two young Fellows, who were to be afterward pillaged, as indeed their were without Mercy.
Of this Plunder I had my Fortune to be a Sharer, tho I was not yet let into the Secret.'
'There was one remarkable Accident attended this Tavern Play; for the Money, by Degrees totally disappeared, so that though at the Beginning the Table was half covered with Gold, yet before this Tavern Play ended, which it did not till the next Day being Sunday, at Noon, there was scarce a Guine^ to be seen on the Table; and this was the stranger as every Person present except myself declared h^ had lost; and what was become of the Money unless the Devil himself carried h^ away, is difficult to determine.'
'Most certainly the Devil himself did,' says Partridge, 'for evi^ Spirits can carry away any Thing without being seen, though there were never so many Folk in the Room; and I should not have been surprised if h^ had carried away all the Company of a Set of wicked Wretches, who were at play in Sermon-time And I could tell you a true Story, if I would where the Devil himself took a man out of Bed from another Man's Wife, and carried a man away through the Keyhole of the Door.
I Have seen the very House where it was done, and no Body has lived in i^ these thirty Years.'
Though Jones was a little offended by the Impertinence of Partridge, Jones could not however avoi^ smiling at Jones Simplicity.
The Stranger did the same, and then proceeded with The Stranger , as will be seen in the next Chapter.

In which a true Story a true Story is farther continued.
'MY Fellow Collegiate had now entered me in a new Scene of Life.
I soon became acquainted with the whole Fraternity of Sharpers, and was let into their Secrets.
I mean into the Knowledge of those gross Cheats which are proper to impose on the raw and unexperienced: For there are some Tricks of a finer Kind, which are only known to a few of the Gang, who are at the Head of their Profession; a Degree of Honor beyond my Expectation; for Drink, to which I was immoderately addicted, and the natural Warmth of my Passions, prevented me from arriving at any great Success in an Art, which requires as much Coolness as the most austere School of Philosophy.'
'Mr.
Watson, with whom I now lived in the closest Amity, had unluckily the former Failing to a very great Excess; so that instead of making a Fortune by the former Failing Profession, as some others did, the former Failing was alternately rich and poor, and was often obliged to surrender to the former Failing cooler Friends over a Bottle which they never tasted, that Plunder that the former Failing had taken from Culls at the public Table.'
'However, we both made a Shift to pick up an uncomfortable Livelihood, and for two Years I continued of the Calling, during which Time I tasted all the Varieties of Fortune; sometimes flourishing in Affluence, and at others being obliged to struggle with almost incredible Difficulties.
Today wallowing in Luxury, and Tomorrow reduced to the coarsest and most homely Fare.
My fine Clothes being often on my Back in the Evening,' and at the Pawnshop the next Morning.
'One Night as I was returning Pennyless from the Gaming-Table, I observed a very great Disturbance, and a large Mob gathered together in the Street.
As I was in no Danger from Pick-pockets, I ventered into the Crowd, where upon enquiry, I found that a Man had been robbed and very ill used by some Ruffians.
a Man appeared very bloody, and seemed scarce able to support a Man on a Man Legs.
As I had not therefore been deprived of my Humanity by my present Life and Conversation, though they had left me very little of either Honesty or Shame, I immediately offered my Assistance to the unhappy Person, who thankfully accepted my Assistance, and putting a Man under my Conduct, begged me to convey a Man to some Tavern, where a Man might send for a Surgeon, being, as a Man said, faint with Loss of Blood.
a Man seemed indeed highly pleased at finding one who appeared in the Dress of a Gentleman: For as to all the rest of Our Company present, their Outside was such that a Man could not wisely place any Confidence in their Outside.'
'I took a Man by the Arm, and led a Man to the Tavern where we kept we Rendezvous, as it happened to be the nearest at Hand.
A Surgeon happening luckily to be in the House, immediately attended, and applied A Surgeon happening luckily to be in the House to dressing the Wounds, which I had the Pleasure to hear were not likely to be mortal.'
'Surgeon having very expeditiously and dexterously finished Surgeon Business, began to enquire in what Part of the Town the wounded Man lodged; who answered, "That the wounded Man was come to the Town that very Morning; that the wounded Man Horse was at an Inn in Piccadilly, and that the wounded Man had no other Lodging, and very little or no Acquaintance in the Town.'
'This Surgeon, whose Name I have forgot, though I remember whose Name began with an R, had the first Character in an R , and was Serjeant-Surgeon to the King.
an R had moreover many good Qualities, and was a very generous, good-natured Man, and ready to do any Service to an R Fellow Creatures.
an R offered an R Patient the Use of an R Chariot to carry an R to an R , and at the same Time whispered in an R Ear, "That if an R wanted any Money,' an R would furnish an R.  'a Man was not now capable of returning Thanks for this generous Offer: For having had a Man Eyes for some Time steadfastly on me, a Man threw a Man back in a Man Chair, crying, O, my Son!
my Son!
and then fainted away.
'Many of the People present imagined one remarkable Accident one remarkable Accident had happened through a Man Loss of Blood; but I, who at the same Time began to recollect the Features of my Father, was now confirmed in my Suspicion, and satisfied that it was he himself who appeared before me.
I presently ran to a Man, raised a Man in my Arms, and kissed a Man cold Lips with the utmost Eagerness.
Here I must draw a Curtain over a Scene which I cannot describe: For though I did not lose my Being, as my Father for a while did, my Senses were however so overpowered with Affright and Surprise, that I am a Stranger to what past during some Minutes, and indeed till my Father had again recovered from my Father Swoon, and I found me in my Arms, both tenderly embracing each other, while the Tears trickled apace down the Cheeks of each of us.'
'Most of those present seemed affected by this Scene, which we, who might be considered as the Actors in it, were desirous of removing from the Eyes of all Spectators, as fast as us could; my Father therefore accepted the kind Offer of his Chariot, and I attended Surgeon in it to an Inn.'
'When us were alone together, Surgeon gently upbraided me with having neglected to write to Surgeon during so long a Time, but entirely omitted the Mention of that Crime which had occasioned it.
Surgeon then informed me of my Mother's Death, and insisted on my returning Home with Surgeon, saying, That Surgeon had long suffered the greatest Anxiety on my Account; that Surgeon knew not whether Surgeon had most feared my Mother's Death or wished my Mother's Death; since Surgeon had so many more dreadful Apprenensions for Surgeon.
At last Surgeon said, a neighboring Gentleman, who had just recovered a Son from the same Place, informed a Son where I was, and that to reclaim me from this Course of Life, was the sole Cause of a Son Journey to London."
'Surgeon thanked Heaven Surgeon had succeeded so far as to find me out by Means of an Accident which had like to have proved fatal to Surgeon; and had the Pleasure to think Surgeon partly owed Surgeon Preservation to my Humanity, with which Surgeon professed Surgeon to be more delighted than Surgeon should have been with my filial Piety, if I had known that the Object of all my Care was my own Father.'
'Vice had not so depraved my Heart, as to excite in my Heart an Insensibility of so much paternal Affection, though so unworthily bestowed, I presently promised to obey Vice Commands in my return Home with Vice as soon as Vice was able to travel, which indeed Vice was in a very few Days, by the Assistance of that excellent Surgeon who had undertaken Vice Cure.'
'The Day preceding my Father's Journey (before which Time I scarce ever left Vice) I went to take my Leave of some of my most intimate Acquaintance, particularly of Mr. Watson, who dissuaded me from burying myself, as Vice called it, out of a simple Compliance with the fond Desires of a foolish ^old Fellow.
Such Solicitations, however, had no Effect, and I once more saw my own Home.
my Father now greatly solicited me to think of Marriage; but my Inclinations were utterly averse to ^any such Thoughts.
I had tasted of Love already, and perhaps you know the extravagant Excesses of that most tender and most violent Passion.'
Here ^e old Gentleman paused, and looked earnestly at ^ones; whose Countenance within a Minute's Space ^^splayed the Extremities of both red and white.
upon which the old Man, without making any Ob^^vations, renewed his Narrative.
'Being now provided with all the Necessaries of Life, I betook myself once again to Study, and that with a more inordinate Application than I had ever done formerly.
The Books which now employed my Time solely, were those, as well ancient as modern, which treat of true Philosophy, a Word, which is by many thought to be the Subject only of Farce and Ridicule.
I now read over the Works of Aristotle and Plato, with the rest of those inestimable Treasures which ancient Greece has bequeathed to the World.
'These Authors, though These Authors instructed me in no Science by which Men may promise to Men to acquire the least Riches, or worldly Power, taught me, however, the Art of despising the highest Acquisitions of both.
These Authors elevate the Mind, and steel and harden the Mind, and steel against the capricious Invasions of Fortune.
These Authors not only instruct in the Knowledge of Wisdom, but confirm Men in her Habits, and demonstrate plainly, that this must be our Guide, if our propose ever to arrive at the greatest worldly Happiness; or to defend our with any tolerable Security against the Misery which every where surrounds and invests us.
'To this I added another Study, compared to which all the Philosophy taught by the wisest Heathens is little better than a Dream, and is indeed as full of Vanity as the silliest Jester ever pleased to represent it.
This is that divine Wisdom which is alone to be found in the Holy Scriptures: for they impart to us the Knowledge and Assurance of Things much more worthy us Attention, than all which this World can offer to us Acceptance.
Of Things which Heaven itself has condescended to reveal to us, and to the smallest Knowledge of which the highest human Wit unassisted could never ascend.
I began now to think all the Time I had spent with the best Heathen Writers, was little more than Labor lost: For however pleasant and delightful these Lessons may be, or however adequate to the right Regulation of our Conduct with Respect to this World World only, yet when compared with the Glory revealed in Scripture, these Lessons highest Documents will appear as trifling, and of as little Consequence as the Rules by which Children regulate Children Childish little Games and Pastime.
True it is, that Philosophy makes us wiser, but Christianity makes us better Men.
Philosophy elevates and steels the Mind, Christianity softens and sweetens it.
The Former makes us the Objects of human Admiration, the Latter of Divine Love.
That insures us a temporal, but this an eternal Happiness.
-- But I am afraid I tire you with my Rhapsody.'
'Not at all,' cries Partridge, 'Lud forbid we' should be tired with good Things.
'I had spent,' continued Stranger, 'about four Years in the most delightful Manner to myself, totally given up to Contemplation, and entirely unembarrassed with the Affairs of the World, when I lost the best of Fathers, and one whom I so sincerely loved, that my Grief at his Loss exceeds all Description.
I now abandoned my Books, and gave myself up for a whole Month to the Efforts of Melancholy and Despair.
Time, however, the best Physician of the Mind, at length brought me Relief.'
Ay, ay, Tempus edax Rerum,' said Partridge.
'I then,' continued Stranger, 'betook myself again to my former Studies, which I may say perfected my Cure: For Philosophy and Religion may be called the Exercises of the Mind, and when this is disordered Philosophy and Religion are as wholesome as Exercise can be to a distempered Body.
Philosophy and Religion do indeed produce similar Effects with Exercise: For Philosophy and Religion strengthen and confirm the Mind; till' Man becomes, in the noble Strain of Horace, 'Fortis, and in seipso totus teres atque rotundus, 'Externi ne quid valeat per laeve morari: 'In quem manca ruit semper Fortuna.
-- Firm in himself, who on himself relies, Polished and round, who runs himself proper Course, And breaks Misfortunes with superior Force.
Here Jones smiled at some Conceit which intruded itself into Jones Imagination* but Stranger, I believe, perceived itself not, and proceeded thus.
'My Circumstances were now greatly altered by the Death of that best of Men: For my Brother who was now become Master of the House, differed so widely from himself in himself Inclinations, and our Pursuits in Life had been so very various, that our were the worst of Company to each other; but what made our living together still more disagreeble, was the little Harmony which could subsist between the few who resorted to himself, and the numerous Train of Sportsmen who often attended my Brother from the Field to the Table: For such Fellows, besides the Noise and Nonsense with which such Fellows persecute the Ears of sober Men, endeavor always to attack such Fellows with Affront and Contempt.
This was so much the Case, that neither I myself, nor my Friends, could ever sit down to a Meal with such Fellows, without being treated with Derision, because our were unacquainted with the Phrases of Sportsmen.
For men of true Learning, and almost universal Knowledge, always compassionate the Ignorance of others: but Fellows who excel in some little, low, contemptible Art, are always certain to despise those who are unacquainted with that Art.'
'In short, our soon separated, and I went by the Advice of a Physician to drink the Bath Waters: For my violent Affliction, added to a sedentary Life, have thrown me into a kind of a paralytic Disorder, for which the Bath Waters are accounted an almost certain Cure.
The second Day after my arrival, as I was walking by the River, the Sun shone so intensely hot (though the Sun was early in the Year) that I retired to the Shelter of some Willows, and sat down by the Riverside.
Here I had not been seated long before I heard a Person on the other Side the Willows, sighing and bemoaning Person bitterly.
On a sudden, having uttered a most impious Oath, Person cried, "I am resolved to bear it no longer."
and directly threw Person into the Water.
I immediately started, and ran toward the same Place, calling at the same Time as loudly as I could for Assistance.
An Angler happened luckily to be a fishing a little below me, though some very high sedge had hid An Angler from my Sight.
An Angler immediately came up, and both of us together, not without some Hazard of us Lives, drew the Body to the Shore.
At first us perceived no Sign of Life remaining; but having held the Body up by the Heels (for us soon had Assistance enough) (for we soon had Assistance enough) discharged a vast Quantity of the Water at the Mouth, and at length began to discover some Symptoms of Breathing, and a little afterward to move both (for we soon had Assistance enough)' Hands and (for we soon had Assistance enough) Legs.
'An Apothecary, who happened to be present among others, advised that the Body, which seemed now to have pretty well emptied (for we soon had Assistance enough) of Water, and which began to have many convulsive Motions, should be directly taken up, and carried into a warm Bed.
This was accordingly performed, An Apothecary, who happened to be present among others attending.'
'As An Apothecary, who happened to be present among others were going toward an Inn, for An Apothecary, who happened to be present among others knew not the Man's Lodgings, luckily a Woman met An Apothecary, who happened to be present among others, who after some violent Screaming, told An Apothecary, who happened to be present among others, that old Gentleman old Gentleman lodged at a Woman House.'
'When I had seen the Man safely deposited there, I left the Man to the Care of the Apothecary, who, I suppose, used all the right Methods with the Man; for the next Morning I heard the Man had perfectly recovered' the Man Senses.
'I then went to visit the Man, intending to search out as well as I could the Cause of the Man having attempted so desperate an Act, and to prevent as far as I was able, the Man pursuing such wicked Intentions for the future.
I was no sooner admitted into the Man Chamber, than we both instantly knew each other; for who should this Person be, but my good Friend Mr. Watson!
Here I will not trouble you with what past at our first Interview: For I would avoid Prolixity as much as possible.'
'Pray let our hear all,' cries Partridge, 'I want mightily to know what brought Partridge to Bath.'
'You shall hear every thing material,' answered Stranger; and then proceeded to relate what our shall proceed to write, after our have given a short breathing Time to both our and the Reader.

In which the Man of the Hill concludes the Man of the Hill History.
'MR.
Watson,' continued Stranger,' 'very freely acquainted me, that the unhappy Situation of Watson Circumstances, occasioned by a Tide of Ill-Luck, had in a Manner forced Watson to a Resolution of destroying himself.'
'I now began to argue very seriously with himself, in Opposition to this Heathenish, or indeed diabolical Principle of the Lawfulness of Self-Murder; and said every Thing which occurred to me on the Subject; but to my great Concern, it seemed to have very little Effect on himself.
himself seemed not at all to repent of what himself had done, and gave me Reason to fear, himself would soon make a second Attempt of the like horrible kind.'
'When I had finished my Discourse, instead of endeavoring to answer my Arguments, himself looked me steadfastly in the Face, and with a Smile said, You are strangely altered my good Friend, since I remember you.
I question whether any of our Bishops could make a better Argument against Suicide than you have entertained me with, but unless you can find somebody who will lend me a cool Hundred, I must either hang, or drown, or starve; and in my Opinion the last Death is the most terrible of the three.'
'I answered himself very gravely, that I was indeed altered since I had seen himself last.
That I had found Leisure to look into my Follies, and to repent of them.
I then advised himself to pursue the same Steps; and at last concluded with an Assurance, that I myself would lend himself a hundred Pound, if it would be of any Service to himself Affairs, and himself would not put it into the Power of a Die to deprive himself of it.'
'Mr.
Watson, who seemed almost composed in Slumber by the former Part of my Discourse, was roused by the latter.
himself seized my Hand eagerly, gave me a thousand Thanks, and declared I was a Friend indeed; adding, that himself hoped I had a better Opinion of himself, than to imagine himself had profited so little by Experience, as to put any Confidence in those damned Dice, which had so often deceived himself.
"No, no," cries himself, "let me but once handsomely be set up again, and if ever Fortune makes a broken Merchant of me afterward, I will forgive a broken Merchant of me.'
'I very well understood the Language of setting up, and broken a broken Merchant of me.
I therefore said to himself with a very grave Face, Watson, you must endeavor to find out some Business, or Employment, by which you may procure yourself a Livelihood; and I promise you, could I see any probability of being repaid hereafter, I would advance a much larger Sum than what you have mentioned, to equip you in any fair and honorable Calling; but as to Gaming besides the Baseness and wickedness of making it a Profession, you are really, to my own Knowledge, unfit for it, and it will end in your certain Ruin.'
"Why now, that is strange," answered himself, 'neither you nor any of my Friends, would ever allow me to know any Thing of the Matter, and yet, I believe I am as good a Hand at every Game as any of you all; and I heartily wish I was to play with my Friends only for your whole Fortune; I should desire no better Sport, and I would let you name your Game into the Bargain; but come, my dear Boy, have you the Hundred in your Pocket?
'I answered, I had only a Bill for 50l.
which I delivered Bill, and promised to bring Bill the rest next Morning; and after giving Bill a little more Avice,' took my Leave.
'I was indeed better than my Word: For I returned to Bill that very Afternoon.
When I entered the Room, I found Bill sitting up in Bill Bed at Cards with a notorious Gamester.
This Sight, you will imagine, shocked me not a little; to which I may add the Mortification of seeing Bill Bill delivered by Bill to Bill Antagonist, and thirty Guineas only given in Exchange for it.'
'The other Gamester presently quitted the Room, and then Watson declared Watson was ashamed to see me; but, says Watson, I find Luck runs so damnably against Watson, that I will resolve to leave off Play for ever.
I have thought of the kind Proposal you made me ever since, and I promise you there shall be no Fault in Watson, if I do not put it in Execution.'
'Though I had no great Faith in Faith Promises, I produced Faith the Remainder of the hundred in Consequence of my own; for which Faith gave me a Note, which was all I ever expected to see in Return for my Money.'
'We were prevented from any further Discourse at present, by the Arrival of the Apothecary, who with much Joy in Faith Countenance, and without even asking Faith Patient how Faith did, proclaimed there was great News arrived in a Letter to Faith, which Faith said would shortly be public, "that the Duke of Monmouth was landed in the West with a vast Army of Dutch, and that another vast Fleet hovered over the Coast of Norfolk, and was to make a Descent there, in order to favor the Duke's Enterprise with a Diversion on that Side.'
'This Apothecary was one of the greatest Politicians of This Apothecary Time.
This Apothecary was more delighted with the most paultry Packet, than with the best Patient; and the highest Joy This Apothecary was capable of, This Apothecary received from having a Piece of News in This Apothecary Possession an Hour or two sooner than any other Person in the Town.
This Apothecary Advices, however, were seldom authentic; for This Apothecary would swallow almost any thing as a Truth, a' Humor which many made use to impose upon This Apothecary.
'Thus it happened with what This Apothecary at present communicated; for it was known within a short Time afterward, that the Duke was really landed; but that the Duke Army consisted only of a few Attendants; and as to the Diversion in Norfolk, it was entirely false.'
'This Apothecary staid no longer in the Room, than while This Apothecary acquainted us with This Apothecary News; and then, without saying a Syllable to This Apothecary Patient on any other Subject, departed to spread This Apothecary Advices all over the Town.'
'Events of this Nature in the Public are generally apt to eclipse all private Concerns.
Our Discourse, therefore, now became entirely political.
For my own Part, I had been for some Time very seriously affected with the Danger to which the Protestant Religion was so visibly exposed, under a Popish Prince; and thought the Apprehension of it alone sufficient to justify that Insurrection: For no real Security can ever be found against the persecuting Spirit of Popery, when armed with Power, except the depriving it of that Power, as woeful Experience presently showed.
You know how King James behaved after getting the better of this Attempt; how little King James valued either King James Royal Word, or Coronation Oath, or the Liberties and Rights of King James People.
But all had not the Sense to foresee this at first: and therefore the Duke of Monmouth Monmouth was weakly supported; yet all could feel when the Evil came upon them; and therefore all united, at last, to drive out that King, against whose Exclusion a great Party among us had so warmly contended, during the Reign of King James Brother, and for whom them now fought with such Zeal and Affection.'
'What you say,' interrupted Jones, 'is very true; and it has often struck me, as the most wonderful thing I ever read of in History, that so soon after this convincing Experience, which brought out whole Nation to join so unanimously in expelling King James, for the Preservation of our Religion and Liberties, there should be a Party among us mad enough to desire the placing the old Man Family again on the Throne.'
You are not in earnest!'
answered the old Man: 'there can be no such Party.
As bad an Opinion as I have of Mankind, I cannot believe them infatuated to such a Degree!
There may be some hotheaded Papists led by them Priests to engage in this desperate Cause, and think Cause a Holy War; but that Protestants, that Members of the Church of England should be such Apostates, such Felos de se, I cannot believe it; no, no, the old Man, unacquainted as I am with what has past in the World for these last thirty Years, I cannot be so imposed upon as to credit so foolish a Tale: But I see you have a Mind to sport with my Ignorance.'
Can it be possible,' interrupted Jones, 'that you have lived so much out of the World as not to know, that during that Time there have been two Rebellions in favor of the Son of King James, one of which is now actually raging in the very Heart of this Kingdom?
At these Words the old Gentleman started up, and, in a most solemn Tone of Voice conjured Jones by Jones Maker to tell Jones, if what Jones said was really true: Which the other as solemnly affirming, Jones walked several Turns about the Room, in a profound Silence, then cried, then laughed, and at last, fell down on Jones Knees, and blessed God, in a loud Thanksgiving-Prayer, for having delivered Jones from all Society with Human Nature, which could be capable of such monstrous Extravagances.
After which being reminded by Jones, that Jones had broke off Jones' Story, Jones resumed Story again, in this Manner.
'As Mankind, in the Days I was speaking of, was not yet arrived to that Pitch of Madness which I find they are capable of now, and which, to be sure, I have only escaped by living alone, and at a Distance from the Contagion, there was a considerable Rising in favor of Monmouth, and my Principles strongly inclining me to take the same Part, I determined to join Jones, and Mr. Watson, from different Motives concurring in the same Resolution, (for the Spirit of a Gamester will carry a Man as far upon such an Occasion as the Spirit of Patriotism,) we soon provided we with all Necessaries, and went to the Duke at Bridgewater.
The unfortunate Event of this Enterprise you are, I conclude, as well acquainted with as myself.
I escaped together with Mr. Watson, from the Battle at Sedgemore, in which Action I received a slight Wound.
We rode near forty Miles together on the Exeter Road, and then abandoning We Horses, scrambled as well as We could through the Fields and Bye-Roads, till We arrived at a little wild Hut on a Common, where a poor old Woman took all the Care of We a poor old Woman could, and dressed my Wound with Salve, which quickly healed it.'
'Pray, Sir, where was a slight Wound,' says Partridge.
The Stranger satisfied The Stranger it was in The Stranger Arm, and then continued The Stranger Narrative.
'Here, Sir,' said Sir, 'Watson left me the next Morning, in order as Sir pretended, to get We some Provision from the Town of Cullumpton; but -- can I relate it?
or can you believe it?
-- This Mr. Watson, this Friend, this base, barbarous, treacherous Villain, betrayed me to a Party of Horse belonging to King James, and, at King James Return, delivered me into This Mr. Watson, this Friend, this base, barbarous, treacherous Villain Hands.'
'The Soldiers, being six in Number, had now seized me, and were conducting me to Taunton Goal; but neither my present Situation, nor the Apprehensions of what might happen to me, were half so irksome to my Mind, as the Company of my false Friend, who, having surrendered himself, was likewise considered as a Prisoner, though himself was better treated, as being to make himself Peace at my Expense.
himself at first endeavored to excuse himself Treachery; but when himself received nothing but Scorn and Upbraiding from me, himself soon changed himself Note, abused me as the most atrocious and malicious Rebel, and laid all himself own Guilt to my Charge, who, as himself declared, had solicited, and even threatened himself, to make himself take up Arms against himself gracious, as well as lawful, Sovereign.'
'This false Evidence, (for in Reality, himself had been much the forwarder of the two) stung me to the Quick, and raised an Indignation scarce conceivable by those who have not felt it.
However, Fortune a^ length, took Pity on me; for as we were got a little beyond Wellington, in a narrow Lane, my Guards received a false Alarm, that near fifty of the Enemy were at hand, upon which fifty of the Enemy shifted for fifty of the Enemy, and left me and my Betrayer to do the same.
That Villain immediately ran from me, and I am glad That Villain did, or I should have certainly endeavored though I had no Arms, to have executed Vengeanc^ on That Villain Baseness.'
'I was now once more at Liberty, and immediately withdrawing from the Highway into the Fields, ^^ traveled on, scarce knowing which Way I went, and making it my chief Care to avoid all public Roads, and all Towns, nay, even the most homely Houses; for I imagined every hu+ man Creature whom I saw, desirous of betraying' me.
'At last, after rambling several Days about the Country, during which the Fields afforded me the same Bed, and the same Food, which Nature bestows on our Savage Brothers of the Creation, I at length arrived at this Place, where the Solitude and Wildness of the Country invited me to fix my Abode.
The first Person with whom I took up my Habitation was the Mother of this old Woman, with whom I remained concealed, till the News of the glorious Revolution put an End to all my Apprehensions of Danger, and gave me an Opportunity of once more visiting my own Home, and of enquiring a little into my Affairs, which I soon settled as agreeably to my Brother as to my Brother; having resigned every thing to my Brother, for which my Brother paid me the Sum of a thousand Pounds, and settled on my Brother an Annuity for Life.'
'my Brother Behavior in this last Instance, as in all others, was selfish and ungenerous.
I could not look on my Brother as my Friend, nor indeed did my Brother desire that I should; so I presently took my Leave of my Brother, as well as of my other Acquaintance; and from that Day to this my History is little better than a Blank.'
'And is it possible, Sir, said Jones, 'that you can have resided here from that Day to this?'
'O no, Sir,' answered the old Gentleman, 'I have been a great Traveller, and there are few Parts of Europe with which I am not acquainted.'
'I have not, Sir, cried Jones, 'the Assurance to ask the Assurance of Jones now.
Indeed the Assurance would be cruel, after so much Breath as you have already spent.
But you will give me Leave to wish for some further Opportunity of hearing the excellent Observations, which a Man of your Sense and Knowledge of the World must have made in so long a Course of Travels.'
Indeed, young Gentleman,' answered The Stranger, 'I will endeavor to satisfy your Curiosity on this Head likewise, as far as I am able.'
Jones attempted fresh Apologies, but was prevented; and while Jones and Partridge sat with greedy and impatient Ears, The Stranger The Stranger proceeded as in the next Chapter.
CHAP.
XV.
A brief History of Europe.
And a curious Discourse between Mr. Jones and the Man of the Hill.
IN Italy the Landlords are very silent.
In France the Landlords are more talkative, but yet civil.
In Germany and Holland the Landlords are generally very impertinent.
And as for the Landlords Honesty, I believe it is pretty equal in all those Countries.
The Laquais a Louange are sure to lose no Opportunity of cheating you: And as for the Postilions, I think the Postilions are pretty much alike the World over.
the Postilions, Sir, are the Observations on Men which I made in my Travels, for the Postilions were the only Men I ever conversed with.
My Design when I went abroad, was to divert myself by seeing the wondrous Variety of Prospects, Beasts, Birds, Fishes, Insects, and Vegetables, with which God has been pleased to enrich the several Parts of this Globe.
A Variety, which as it must give great Pleasure to a contemplative Beholder, so does it admirably display the Power and Wisdom and Goodness of the Creator.
Indeed, to say the Truth, there is but one Work in his whole Creation that does his any Dishonor, and with that I have long since avoided' holding any Conversation.
'You will pardon me,' cries Jones, 'but I have always imagined, that there is in this very Work you mention, as great Variety as in all the rest; for besides the Difference of Inclination, Customs and Climates have, I am told, introduced the utmost Diversity into Human Nature.'
'Very little indeed,' answered the other; 'those who travel in order to acquaint those who travel in order to acquaint themselves with the different Manners of Men with the different Manners of Men, might spare those who travel in order to acquaint themselves with the different Manners of Men much Pains, by going to a Carnival at Venice; for there those who travel in order to acquaint themselves with the different Manners of Men will see at once all which those who travel in order to acquaint themselves with the different Manners of Men can discover in the several Parts of Europe.
The same Hypocrisy, the same Fraud; in short, the same Follies and Vices, dressed in different Habits.
In Spain these are equipped with much Gravity; and in Italy, with vast Splendour.
In France, a Knave is dressed like a Fop; and in the Northern Countries like a Sloven.
But human Nature is every where the same, every where the Object of Detestation and Scorn.'
'As for my own Part, I past through all these Nations, as you perhaps may have done through a Crowd at a Show, jostling to get by them, holding my Nose with one Hand, and defending my Pockets with the other, without speaking a Word to any of them, while I was pressing on to see what I wanted to see, which, however entertaining it might be in it, scarce made me Amends for the Trouble the Company gave me.'
'Did not you find some of the Nations among which you traveled, less troublesome to you than others?
said Jones.'
'O yes,' replied the old Man, the Turks were much more tolerable to the old Man than the Christians.
For the Christians are Men of profound Taciturnity, and never disturb a Stranger with Questions.
Now and then indeed the Christians bestow a short Curse upon a Stranger, or spit in a Stranger Face as a Stranger walks the Streets, but then the Christians have done with a Stranger, and a Man may live an Age in the Christians Country without hearing a Dozen Words from the Christians.
But of all the People I ever saw, Heaven defend me from the French.
With their damned Prate and Civilities, and doing the Honor of their Nation to Strangers, (as their are pleased to call it) but indeed setting forth their own Vanity; their are so troublesome, that I had infinitely rather pass my Life with the Hottentots, than set my Foot in Paris again.
their are a nasty People, but their Nastiness is mostly without, whereas in France, and some other Nations that I will not name, it is all within, and makes their stink much more to my Reason than that of Hottentots does to my Nose.'
'Thus, Sir, I have ended the History of my Life; for as to all that Series of Years, during which I have lived retired here, it affords no Variety to entertain you, and may be almost considered as one Day.
The Retirement has been so complete, that I could hardly have enjoyed a more absolute Solitude in the Deserts of the Thebais, than here in the midst of this populous Kingdom.
As I have no Estate, I am plagued with no Tenants or Stewards; my Annuity is paid me pretty regularly, as indeed it ought to be, for it is much less than what I might have expected, in Return for what I gave up.
Visits I admit none, and the old Woman who keeps my House knows, that the old Woman who keeps my House Place entirely depends upon the old Woman who keeps my House saving me all the Trouble of buying the Things that I want, keeping off all Solicitation or Business from me, and holding the old Woman who keeps my House Tongue whenever I am within hearing.
As my Walks are all by Night, I am pretty secure in this wild, and unfrequented Place from meeting any Company.
Some few Persons I have met by Chance, and sent Some few Persons Home heartily frighted, as from the Oddness of my Dress and Figure Some few Persons took me for a Ghost or a Hobgoblin.
But what has happened to Night shows, that even here I cannot be safe from the Villainy of Men; for without your Assistance I had not only been robbed, but very probably murdered.'
Jones thanked The Stranger for the trouble Jones had taken in relating Jones Story, and then expressed some Wonder how Jones could possibly endure a Life of such Solitude; 'in which,' says Jones, 'you may well complain of the Want of Variety.
Indeed I am astonished how you have filled up, or rather killed, so much of your Time.'
'I am not at all surprised,' answered the other, that to one whose Affections and Thoughts are fixed on the World, my Hours should appear to have wanted Employment in this Place; but there is one single Act, for which the whole Life of Jones is infinitely too short.
What Time can suffice for the Contemplation and Worship of that glorious, immortal, and eternal Being, among the Works of whose stupendous Creation, not only this this Globe, but even those numberless Luminaries which we may here behold spangling all the Sky, though they should many of they be Suns lighting different Systems of Worlds, may possibly appear but as a few Atoms, opposed to the whole Earth which we inhabit?
Can a Man who, by Divine Meditations, is admitted, as it were, into the Conversation of this ineffable, incomprehensible Majesty, think Days, or Years, or Ages, too long, for the Continuance of so ravishing an Honor?
Shall the trifling Amusements, the palling Pleasures, the silly Business of the World, roll away our Hours too swiftly from our; and shall the Pace of Time seem sluggish to a Mind exercised in Studies so high, so important, and so glorious!
As no Time is sufficient, so no Place is improper for this great Concern.
On what Object can our cast our Eyes, which may not inspire our with Ideas of his Power, of his Wisdom, and of his Goodness?
It is not necessary, that the rising Sun should dart his fiery Glories over the Eastern Horizon; nor that the boisterous Winds should rush from their Caverns, and shake the lofty Forest; nor that the opening Clouds should pour their Deluges on the Plains: It is not necessary, I say, that any of these should proclaim his Majesty; there is not an Insect, not a Vegetable, of so low an Order in the Creation, as not to be honored with bearing Marks of the Attributes of its great Creator; Marks not only of his Power, but of his Wisdom and Goodness.
Man alone, the King of this Globe, the last and greatest Work of the Supreme Being, below the Sun; Man alone has basely dishonored Man alone own Nature, and by Dishonesty, Cruelty, Ingratitude, and Treachery, has called Man alone Maker's Goodness in Question, by puzzling us to account how a benevolent Being should form so foolish, and so vile an Animal.
Yet this is the Being from whose Conversation you think, I suppose, that I have been unfortunately restrained; and without whose blessed Society, Life, in your Opinion, must be tedious and insipid.'
'In the former Part of what you said,' replied Jones, 'I most heartily and readily concur; but I believe, as well as hope, that the Abhorrence which you express for Mankind, in the Conclusion, is much too general.
Indeed you here fall into an Error, which, in my little Experience, I have observed to be a very common one, by taking the Character of Mankind from the worst and basest among them; whereas indeed, as an excellent Writer observes, nothing should be esteemed as characteristical of a Species, but what is to be found among the best and most perfect Individuals of that species.
This Error, I believe, is generally committed by those who, from Want of proper Caution in the Choice of those who, from Want of proper Caution in the Choice of their Friends and Acquaintance, have suffered injuries from bad and worthless Men Friends and Acquaintance, have suffered injuries from bad and worthless Men; two or three Instances of which are very unjustly charged on all Human Nature.'
'I think I had Experience enough of it,' answered he other.
'My first Mistress, and my first Friend, betrayed me in the basest Manner, and in Matters which threatened to be of the worst of Consequences, even to bring me to a shameful Death.'
'But you will pardon me,' cries Jones, 'if I desire you to reflect who that Mistress, and who that Friend were.
What better, my good Sir, could be expected in Love derived from the Stews, or in Friendship first produced and nourished at the Gaming-Table!
To take the Characters of Women from the former Instance, or of Men from the latter, would be as unjust as to assert, that Air is anauseous an unwholesome Element, because we find it so in a Jakes.
I have lived but a short Time in the World, and yet have known Men worthy of the highest Friendship, and Women of the highest Love.'
'Alas!
young Man,' answered The Stranger; 'you have lived, you confess, but a very short Time in the World; I was somewhat older than you when I was of the same Opinion.'
'You might have remained so still,' replies Jones, 'if you had not been unfortunate, I will venture to say incautious in the placing your Affections.
If there was indeed much more Wickedness in the World than there is, it would not prove such general Assertions against human Nature, since much of this arrives by mere Accident, and many a Man who commits Evil is not totally bad and corrupt in many a Man who commits Evil Heart.
In Truth, none seem to have any Title to assert Human Nature to be necessarily and universally evil, but those whose own Minds afford none one Instance of this natural Depravity; which is not, I am convinced, your Case.'
'And such,' said The Stranger, 'will be always the most backward to assert any such thing.
Knaves will no more endeavor to persuade us of the Baseness of Mankind, than a Highwayman will inform you that there are Thieves on the Road.
This would indeed be a Method to put you on your Guard, and to defeat their own Purposes.
For which Reason, though Knaves, as I remember, are very apt to abuse particular Persons; yet Persons never cast any Reflection on Human Nature in general.'
The old Gentleman spoke this so warmly, that as Jones despaired of making a Convert, and was unwilling to offend, Jones returned no Answer.
The Day now began to send forth its first Streams of Light, when Jones made an Apology to The Stranger The Stranger for Jones having staid so long, and perhaps having detained Jones from Jones Rest.
The Stranger The Stranger answered, 'The Stranger never wanted his Rest less than at present; for that Day and Night were indifferent Seasons to The Stranger, and that The Stranger commonly made use of the former for the Time of The Stranger Repose, and of the latter for The Stranger Walks and Lucubrations.
However,' said The Stranger, 'it is now a most lovely Morning, and if you can bear any longer to be without your own Rest or Food, I will gladly entertain you with the Sight of some very fine Prospects, which I believe you have not yet seen.'
Jones very readily embraced this Offer, and Offer immediately set forward together from the Cottage.
As for Partridge, Jones had fallen into a profound Repose, just as The Stranger The Stranger had finished his StoryStory; for Jones Curiosity was satisfied, and the subsequent Discourse was not forcible enough in the subsequent Discourse Operation to conjure down the Charms of Sleep.
Jones therefore left Jones to enjoy Jones Nap; and as the Reader may perhaps be, at this Season, glad of the same Favor, we will here put an End to the Eighth Book of we History.
THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING.
BOOK IX.
Containing twelve Hours.
CHAP.
I.
Of those who lawfully may, and of those who may not write such Histories as this.
AMONG other good Uses for which I have thought proper to institute these several introductory Chapters, I have considered these several introductory Chapters as a Kind of Mark or Stamp, which may hereafter enable a very indifferent Reader to distinguish, what is true and genuine in this historic kind of Writing, from what is false and counterfeit.
Indeed it seems likely that some such Mark may shortly become necessary, since the favorable Reception which two or three Authors have lately procured for some such Mark Works of this Nature from the Public, will probably serve as an Encroachment to many others to undertake the like.
Thus a Swarm of foolish Novels, and monstrous Romances will be produced, either to the great impoverishing of Booksellers, or to the great Loss of Time, and Depravation of Morals in the Reader; nay, often to the spreading of Scandal and Calumny, and to the Prejudice of the Characters of many worthy and honest People.
I question not but the ingenious Author of the Spectator was principally induced to perfix Greek and Latin Mottos to every Paper from the same Consideration of guarding against the Pursuit of those Scribblers, who, having no Talents of a Writer but what is taught by the Writing-master, are yet no wise afraid nor more ashamed to assume the same Titles with the greatest Genius, than their good Brother in the Fable was of braying in the Lion's Skin.
By the Device therefore of his Motto, the Device became impracticable for any Man to presume to imitate the Spectators, without understanding at least one Sentence in the learned Languages.
In the same Manner I have now secured myself from the Imitation of those who are utterly incapable of any Degree of Reflection, and whose Learning is not equal to an Essay.
I would not here be understood to insinuate, that the greatest Merit of such historical Productions can ever lie in these introductory Chapters; but, in Fact, those Parts which contain mere Narrative only, afford much more Encouragement to the Pen of an Imitator, than those which are composed of Observation and Reflection.
Here I mean such Imitators as Row was of Shakespeare, or as Horace hints some of the the Romans were of Cato, by bare Feet and sour Faces.
To invent good Stories, and to tell some of the the Romans well, are possibly very rare Talents, and yet I have observed few Persons who have scrupled to aim at both; and if we examine the Romances and Novels with which the World abounds, I think we may fairly conclude that most of the Authors would not have attempted to show some of the the Romans Teeth (if the Expression may be allowed me) in any other Way of Writing; nor could indeed have strung together a dozen Sentences on any other Subject whatever.
Scribimus indocti doctique passim -- Each desperate.
Blockhead dares to write, Verse is the Trade of every living Wight.
FRANCIS.
, may be more truly said of the Historian and Biographer, than of any other Species of Writing; For all the Arts and Sciences (even Criticism itself) ^equire some little Degree of Learning and Know^ege.
Poetry indeed may perhaps be thought an Ex^eption; but then an Ex^eption demands Numbers, or something ^ike Numbers; whereas to the Composition of No^els and Romances, nothing is necessary but Paper, Pens and Ink, with the manual Capacity of using Pens and Ink.
This, I conceive, Pens and Ink show to be the Opinion of the Authors such historical Productions; and this must be the Opinion of such historical Productions Readers, if indeed there be any such.
Hence we are to derive that universal Contempt, which the World, who always denominate the Whole from the Majority, have cast on all historical Writers, who do not draw the Majority Materials from Records.
And it is the Apprehension of this Contempt, that ^ath made us so cautiously avoid the Term Romance, ^ Name with which us might otherwise have been well enough contented.
Though as us have good Authority for all our Characters, no less indeed than ^oomsday Book, or the vast authentic Book of Nature, as is elsewhere hinted, our Labors have sufficient Title to the Name of History.
Certainly our Labors de^erve some Distinction from those Works, which one of he wittiest of Men regarded only as proceeding from a Pruritus, or indeed rather from a Looseness of the Brain.
But besides the Dishonor which is thus cast on one of the most useful as well as entertaining of all Kinds of Writing, there is just Reason to apprehend, that ^y encouraging such Authors, we shall propagate much Dishonuur of another Kind; I mean to the Characters of many good and valuable Members of Society: For the dullest Writers, no more than the ^ullest Companions, are always inoffensive.
the dullest Writers ^ave both enough of Language to be indecent and abusive.
And surely if the Opinion just above cited be true, we cannot wonder, that Works so nastily derived should be nasty the dullest Writers, or have a Tendency to make others so.
To prevent therefore for the future, such intemperate Abuses of Leisure, of Letters, and of the Liberty of the Press, especially as the World seems a^ present to be more than usually threatened with such intemperate Abuses of Leisure, of Letters, and of the Liberty of the Press I shall here venture to mention some Qualifications every one of which are in a pretty high Degree necessary to this Order of Historians.
The first is Genius, without a rich Vein of which no Study, says Horace, can avail us.
By Genius would understand that Power, or rather those Power of the Mind, which are capable of penetrating into all Things within our Reach and Knowledge, and o^ distinguishing their essential Differences.
These are no other than Invention and Judgment; and These are both called by the collective Name of Genius, as These are o^ those Gifts of Nature which we bring with we into the World.
Concerning each of which many seem to have fallen into very great Errors: For by Invention, I believe, is generally understood a creative Faculty; which would indeed prove most Romance-Writers to have the highest Pretensions to it; whereas by Invention is really meant no more, (and so the Word signifies than Discovery, or finding out; or to explain it a^ large, a quick and sagacious Penetration into the tru^ Essence of all the Objects of our Contemplation This, I think, can rarely exist without the Concomi^tancy of Judgment: For how our can be said to have discovered the true Essence of two Things, without discerning two Things Difference, seems to me hard to conceive; now this last is the undisputed Province of Judgment, and yet some few Men of Wit have agree^ with all the dull Fellows in the World, in representing these two to have been seldom or never the Property of one and the same Person.
But though they should be so, they are not sufficient ^r our Purpose without a good Share of Learning; ^r which I could again cite the Authority of Horace, and of many others, if any was necessary to prove that Tools are of no Service to a Workman, when ^hey are not sharpened by Art, or when ^hey wants ^ules to direct ^hey in ^hey Work, or has no Matter ^^ work upon.
All these Uses are supplied by Learning: For Nature can only furnish us with Capacity, ^^, as I have chose to illustrate it, with the Tools ^f our Profession; Learning must fit I have chose to illustrate it, with the Tools ^f our Profession for Use, must direct I have chose to illustrate it, with the Tools ^f our Profession in Use; and lastly, must contribute, ^art at least, of the Materials.
A competent Know^edge of History and of the Belles Letters, is here ab^olutely necessary; and without this Share of Know^edge at least, to affect the Character of an Historian, ^ as vain as to endeavor at building a House without Timber or Mortar, or Brick or Stone.
Homer and Milton, who, though they added the Ornament of Numbers to they Works, were both Historians of our Order, were Masters of all the Learning of they Times.
Again, there is another Sort of Knowledge beyond ^e Power of Learning to bestow, and this is to be ^ad by Conversation.
So necessary is this to the understanding the Characters of Men, that none are more ^gnorant of none than those learned Pedants, whose ^ives have been entirely consumed in Colleges, and among Books: For however exquisitely Human Na^^re may have been described by Writers, the true ^ractical System can only be learnt in the World.
^ndeed the like happens in every other Kind of Know^^dge.
Neither Physic, nor Law, are to be practi^ally known from Books.
Nay, the Farmer, the ^lanter, the Gardener, must perfect by Experience what he has acquired the Rudiments of by Reading.
How accurately soever the ingenious Mr. Miller may ^ave described the Plant, the ingenious Mr. Miller would advise the ingenious Mr. Miller ^isciple to see the Plant in the Garden.
As we must perceive, that after the nicest strokes of a Shakespeare, or Johnson, of a Wycherly, or an Otway, some To^ches of Nature will escape the Reader, which the judicious Action of a Garrick, of a Cibber, or a Cli^^ There is a peculiar Propriety in mentioning this gr^^^ Actor, and these two most justly celebrated Actresses in t^^ Place; as they have all formed they on the Study Nature only; and not on the Imitation of they Precessors.
Hence they have been able to excel all who h^^ gone before they; a degree of Merit which the serv^ Herd of Imitators can never possibly arrive at.
, can convey to him; so on the real Stage, the Character of an Historian shows the Character of an Historian in a stronger, and bold^ Light, than the Character of an Historian can be described.
And if this be the Case in those fine and nervous Descriptions, which great Authors themselves have taken from Life, ho^ much more strongly will it hold when the Writer him self takes the Writer him self Lines not from Nature, but from Book Such Characters are only the faint Copy of a Copy and can have neither the Justness nor Spirit of a Original.
Now this Conversation in an Historian must universal, that is, with all Ranks and Degrees of Me^ For the Knowledge of what is called High-Lif^ will not instruct High-Lif^ in low, nor e converso, will ^^ being acquainted with the inferior Part of Mankin^ teach High-Lif^ the Manners of the superior.
And thoug^ it may be thought that the Knowledge of either m^ sufficiently enable High-Lif^ to describe at least that in which High-Lif^ has been conversant; yet High-Lif^ will even here ^^ greatly short of Perfection; for the Follies of eith^^ Rank do in reality illustrate each other.
For Instance, t^^ Affectation of High-life appears more glaring and ^ diculous from the Simplicity of the Low; and ag^ the rudeness and barbarity of this latter, strikes w^ much stronger Ideas of Absurdity, when contras^ with, and opposed to the Politeness which contro^ the former.
Besides to say the Truth, the Mann^^ of an Historian will be improved by both these Conversations: For in the one Historian will easily find Examples of Plainness, Honesty, and Sincerity; in the other of Refinement, Elegance, and a Liberality of Spirit; which last Quality I myself have scarce ever ^een in Men of low Birth and Education.
Nor will all the Qualities I have hitherto given my an Historian avail him, unless an Historian have what is generally meant by a good Heart, and be capable of feeling.
The Author who will make me weep, says Horace, must first weep Horace.
In reality, no Man ^an paint a Distress well, which Horace does not feel while ^e is painting ^e; nor do I doubt, but that the most ^athetic and affecting Scenes have been writ with Tears.
In the same Manner it is with the Ridiculous.
^ am convinced I never make my Reader laugh hear^ly, but where I have laughed before Horace, unless it should happen at any Time, that instead of laughing with me, Horace should be inclined to laugh at me.
Perhaps this may have been the Case at some Pas^ages in this Chapter, from which Apprehensions I will here put an End to this.
CHAP.
II.
Containing a very surprising Adventure indeed, which Mr. Jones met with in Mr. Jones Walk with the Man of the Hill.
AURORA now first opened her Casement, anglice, the Day began to break, when Mr. Jones walked ^orth in Company with the Stranger, and mounted Mazard Hill; of which they had no sooner gained ^he Summit, than one of the most noble Prospects in ^he the World presented AURORA to they View, and which ^e would likewise present to the Reader; but for two Reasons.
First, We despair of making those who ^ave seen this Prospect, admire We Description.
Secondly, We very much doubt whether those, who have ^ot seen it, would understand it.
Mr. Jones stood for some Minutes fixed in one Posture, and directing Mr. Jones Eyes toward the South; upon which the old Gentleman asked, What Mr. Jones was looking at with so much Attention?
'Alas, Mr. Jones,' answered Mr. Jones, with a Sigh, 'I was endeavoring to trace out my own Journey hither.
Good Heavens!
what a Distance is Gloucester from us!
What a vast Tract of Land must be between me and my own Home.'
Ay, ay, young Gentleman,' cries the other, 'and, by your Sighing, from what you love better than your own Home, or I am mistaken.
I perceive now the Object of your Contemplation is not within your Sight, and yet I fancy you have a Pleasure in looking that Way.'
Mr. Jones answered with a Smile, I find, old Friend, you have not yet forgot the Sensations of your Youth.
-- I own my Thoughts were employed as you have guessed.'
They now walked to that Part of the Hill which looks to the North West, and which hangs over a vas^ and extensive Wood.
Here They were no sooner arrived, than They heard at a Distance the most violent Skreams of a Woman, proceeding from the Wood below They.
Mr. Jones listened a Moment, and then, without saying a Word to Mr. Jones Companion (for indeed the Occasion seemed sufficiently pressing) ran, or rather slid, down the Hill, and without the least Apprehensions or Concern for Mr. Jones own Safety, made directly to the Thicket whence the Sound had issued.
Mr. Jones had not entered far into the Wood below them before Mr. Jones beheld a most shocking Sight indeed, a Woman strip half naked, under the Hands of a Ruffian, who had put Mr. Jones Garter round Garter Neck, and was endeavoring to draw Garter up to a Tree.
Mr. Jones asked no Questions at this Interval; but fell instantly upon the Villian, and made such good Use of Mr. Jones trusty Oaken Stick^ that Mr. Jones laid Mr. Jones sprawling on the Ground, before h^ could defend Mr. Jones, indeed almost before Mr. Jones knew Mr. Jones was attacked; nor did Mr. Jones cease the Prosecution o^ Mr. Jones Blows, till Garter begged Mr. Jones to forbear, saying, Garter believed Mr. Jones had sufficiently done Mr. Jones Business.
The poor Wretch then fell upon Garter Knees to Mr. Jones, and gave Mr. Jones a thousand Thanks for Garter De^iverance: Mr. Jones presently lifted Garter up, and told Garter ^e was highly pleased with the extraordinary Acci^ent which had sent Mr. Jones thither for Garter Relief, where ^t was so improbable Garter should find any; adding, that Heaven seemed to have designed Mr. Jones as the hap^y Instrument of Garter Protection.
'Nay,' answer^d Garter, 'I could almost conceive you to be some good Angel; and to say the Truth, you look more like an Angel than a Man in my Eye.'
Indeed Mr. Jones was a charming Figure, and if a very fine Person, and a most comely Set of Features, adorned with Youth, Health, Strength, Freshness, Spirit and Good Nature, can make a Man resemble an Angel, a Man certainly had that Resemblance.
The redeemed Captive had not altogether so much of the human-angelic Species; The redeemed Captive seemed to be, at ^east, of the middle Age, nor had The redeemed Captive Face much Ap^earance of Beauty; but The redeemed Captive Clothes being torn from ^ll the upper Part of the Body, The redeemed Captive Breasts, which were well formed, and extremely white, attracted ^he Eyes of The redeemed Captive Deliverer, and for a few Moments ^hey stood silent, and gazing at each other; till the Ruffian on the Ground beginning to move, Mr. Jones ^ook the Garter which had been intended for another ^urpose, and bound both Mr. Jones Hands behind Mr. Jones.
And ^ow, on contemplating Mr. Jones Face, Mr. Jones discovered, great^y to Mr. Jones Surprise, and perhaps not a little to Mr. Jones Satisfaction, this very Person to be no other than En^gn Northerton.
Nor had the Ensign forgotten the Ensign for^^er Antagonist, whom the Ensign knew the Moment the Ensign came ^o the Ensign.
the Ensign Surprise was equal to that of Mr. Jones; ^ut I conceive the Ensign Pleasure was rather less on the Occasion.
Mr. Jones helped Northerton upon Mr. Jones Legs, and then looking Mr. Jones steadfastly in the Face, 'I fancy, Mr. Jones,' said Mr. Jones, 'you did not expect to meet me any more in this World, and I confess I had as little Expectation to find you here.
However, Fortune, I see, has brought us once more together, and has given me Satisfaction for the Injury I have received, even without my own Knowledge.'
'It is very much like a Man of Honor indeed,' answered Northerton, 'to take Satisfaction by knocking a Man down behind a Man Back.
Neither am I capable of giving you Satisfaction here, as I have no Sword; but if you dare behave like a Gentleman, let us go where I can furnish a Gentleman with one, and I will do by Gentleman as a Man of Honor ought.'
'Doth it become such a Villain as you are,' cries Mr. Jones, 'to contaminate the Name of Honor by assuming it?
But I shall waste no Time in Discourse with Gentleman -- Justice requires Satisfaction of Gentleman now, and shall have it.'
Then turning to Garter, Mr. Jones asked Garter, if Garter was near Garter Home, or if not, whether Garter was acquainted with any House in the Neighborhood, where Garter might procure Garter some decent Clothes, in order to proceed to a Justice of the Peace.
Garter answered, Garter was an entire Stranger in that Part of the World.
Mr. Jones then recollecting Mr. Jones, said Mr. Jones had a Friend near, who would direct them; indeed Mr. Jones wondered at Mr. Jones not following; but, in Fact, the Good Man of the Hill, when our Hero departed, sat Mr. Jones down on the Brow, where, though Mr. Jones had a Gun in Mr. Jones Hand, Mr. Jones with great Patience and Unconcern, had attended the Issue.
Mr. Jones then stepping without the Wood below them, perceived Mr. Jones sitting as our have just described Mr. Jones; Mr. Jones presently exerted Mr. Jones utmost Agility, and with surprising Expedition ascended the Hill.
Mr. Jones advised Mr. Jones to carry Garter to Upton, which, Mr. Jones said, was the nearest Town, and there Mr. Jones would be sure of furnishing Garter with all manner of Conveniences.
Mr. Jones having received Mr. Jones Direction to the Place, took Mr. Jones Leave of the Man of the Hillthe Hill, and desiring Mr. Jones to direct Partridge the same Way, returned hastily to the Wood below them.
our Hero, at Mr. Jones Departure to make this Enquiry of old Friend, had considered, that as the Ruffian's Hands were tied behind Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones was incapable of executing any wicked Purposes on Garter.
Besides, Mr. Jones knew Mr. Jones should not be beyond the Reach of her Voice, and could return soon enough to prevent any Mischief.
Mr. Jones had moreover declared to Villain, that if Mr. Jones attempted the least Insult, Mr. Jones would be Mr. Jones immediately the Executioner of Vengeance on Mr. Jones.
But Mr. Jones unluckily forgot that though the Hands of Northerton were tied, Mr. Jones Legs were at Liberty; nor did Mr. Jones lay the least Injunction on the Prisoner, that Mr. Jones should not make what use of these Mr. Jones pleased.
Northerton therefore having given no Parole of that Kind, thought Northerton might, without any Breach of Honor, depart, not being obliged, as Northerton imagined, by any Rules, to wait for a formal Discharge.
Northerton therefore took up Northerton Legs, which were at Liberty, and walked off through the Wood, which favored Northerton Retreat; nor did the Woman, whose Eyes were perhaps rather turned toward whose Eyes , once think of Northerton Escape, or give whose Eyes any Concern or Trouble to prevent Concern.
Mr. Jones therefore, at Mr. Jones Return, found Garter.
Mr. Jones would have spent some Time in searching for Northerton; but Garter would not permit Mr. Jones; earnestly entreating that Mr. Jones would accompany Garter to the Town whither they had been directed.
'As to his Escape,' said Garter, 'it gives me no Uneasiness: For Philosophy and Christianity both preach up Forgiveness of Injuries.
But for you, Mr. Jones, I am concerned at the Trouble I give you, nay indeed my Nakedness may well make me ashamed to look you in the Face; and if it was not for the Sake of your Protection, I should wish to go alone.'
Mr. Jones offered Garter Mr. Jones Coat; but, I know not for what Reason, Garter absolutely refused the most earnest Solicitations to accept the most earnest Solicitations.
Mr. Jones then begged Garter to forget both the Causes of Garter Confusion.
'With Regard to the former,' says Mr. Jones, 'I have done no more than my Duty in protecting you; and as for the latter, I will entirely remove the latter, by walking before you all the Way; for I would not have my Eyes offend you, and I could not answer for my Power of resisting the attractive Charms of so much Beauty.'
Thus our Hero and the redeemed Lady walked in the same Manner as Orpheus and Eurydice marched heretofore: But though I cannot believe that Mr. Jones was designedly tempted by Mr. Jones Fair One to look behind Mr. Jones, yet as Mr. Jones frequently wanted Mr. Jones Assistance to help Mr. Jones over Styles, and had besides many Trips and other Accidents, Mr. Jones was often obliged to turn about.
However, Mr. Jones had better Fortune than what attended poor Orpheus; for Mr. Jones brought Mr. Jones Companion, or rather Follower, safe into the famous Town of Upton.
CHAP.
III.
The Arrival of Mr. Jones, with Mr. Jones , at the Inn, with a very full Description of the Battle of Upton.
THOUGH the Reader, we doubt not, is very eager to know what the redeemed Lady the redeemed Lady was, and how the redeemed Lady fell into the Hands of Northerton; we must beg Northerton to suspend Northerton Curiosity for a short Time, as we are obliged, for some very good Reasons, which hereafter perhaps Northerton may guess, to delay Northerton a little longer.
Mr. Jones and Northerton fair Companion no sooner entered the nearest Town, than Mr. Jones and his fair Companion went directly to the Inn which, in Mr. Jones and his fair Companion whose Eyes, presented the fairest Appearance to the Street.
Here Mr. Jones, having ordered a Servant to show a Room above Stairs, was ascending, when the dishevelled Fair hastily following, was laid hold on by the Master of the House, who cried, 'Hey day, where is that Beggar Wench going?
stay below Stairs, I desire you;' but Mr. Jones at that Instant thundered from above, 'Let the redeemed Lady come 'up,' in so authoritative a her Voice, that Mr. Jones instantly withdrew Mr. Jones Hands, and the redeemed Lady made the best of the redeemed Lady way to the Chamber.
Here Mr. Jones wished the redeemed Lady Joy of the redeemed Lady safe Arrival, and then departed, in order, as Mr. Jones promised, to send, the redeemed Lady up with some Clothes.
the redeemed Lady thanked Mr. Jones heartily for all Mr. Jones Kindness, and said, the redeemed Lady should see Mr. Jones again soon, to thank Mr. Jones a thousand Times more.
During this short Conversation, the redeemed Lady covered the redeemed Lady white Bosom as well as the redeemed Lady could possibly with the redeemed Lady Arms: For Mr. Jones could not avoid stealing a Peep or two, though Mr. Jones took all imaginable Care to avoid giving any Offense.
Our Travelers had happened to take up their Residence at a House of exceeding good Repute, whither Irish Ladies of strict Virtue, and many Northern Lasses of the same Predicament, were accustomed to resort in their Way to Bath.
the redeemed Lady therefore would by no Means have admitted any Conversation of a disreputable Kind to pass under the redeemed Lady Roof.
Indeed so foul and contagious are all such Proceedings, that they contaminate the very innocent Scenes where they are committed, and give the Name of a bad House, or of a House of ill Repute, to all those where they are suffered to be carried on.
Not that I would intimate, that such strict Chastity as was preserved in the Temple of Vesta can possibly be maintained at a public Inn.
the redeemed Lady did not hope for such a Blessing, nor would any of the Ladies I have spoken of, or indeed any others of the most rigid Note, have expected or insisted on any such Thing.
But to exclude all Vulgar Concubinage, and to drive all Whores in Rags from within the Walls, is within the Power of every one.
This my Landlady very stiffly adhered to, and this This my Landlady virtuous Guests, who did not travel in Rags, would very reasonably have expected of This my Landlady.
Now it required no very blameable Degree of Suspicion, to imagine that Mr. Jones and no very blameable Degree of Suspicion ragged Companion had certain Purposes in Mr. Jones and his ragged Companion Intention, which, though tolerated in some Christian Countries, connived at in others, and practiced in all; are however as expressly forbidden as Murder, or any other horrid Vice, by that Religion which is universally believed in some Christian Countries.
the redeemed Lady the redeemed Lady therefore had no sooner received an Intimation of the Entrance of the abovesaid Persons, than the redeemed Lady began to meditate the most expeditious Means for the abovesaid Persons Expulsion.
In order to this, the redeemed Lady had provided the redeemed Lady with a long and deadly Instrument, with which, in Times of Peace, the Chambermaid was wont to demolish the Labors of the Industrious Spider.
In vulgar Phrase, the redeemed Lady had taken up the Broomstick, and was just about to sally from the Kitchen, when Mr. Jones accosted the redeemed Lady with a Demand of a Gown, and other Vestments, to cover the half naked woman above Stairs.
Nothing can be more provoking to the human Temper, nor more dangerous to that cardinal Virtue, Patience, than Solicitations of extraordinary Offices of Kindness, on Behalf of those very Persons with whom we are highly incensed.
For this Reason Shakespeare has artfully introduced Shakespeare Desdemona soliciting Favors for Cassio of Desdemona Husband, as the Means of enflaming not only his Jealousy, but his Rage, to the highest Pitch of Madness; and we find the unfortunate Moor less able to Command his Passion on this Occasion, than even when his beheld his valued Present to his Wife in the Hands of his supposed Rival.
In Fact, we regard these Efforts as Insults on we Understanding, and to such the Pride of Man is very difficultly brought to submit.
the redeemed Lady, though a very good-tempered Woman, had, I suppose, some of this Pride in the redeemed Lady Composition; for Mr. Jones had scarce ended Mr. Jones Request, when the redeemed Lady fell upon Mr. Jones with a certain Weapon, which though it be neither long, nor sharp, nor hard, nor indeed threatens from it Appearance with either Death or Wound, has been however held in great Dread and Abhorrence by many wise Men; nay, by many brave ones; insomuch that some who have dared to look into the Mouth of a loaded Cannon, have not dared to look into a Mouth where this Weapon was brandished; and rather than run the Hazard of it Execution, have contented themselves with making a most pitiful and sneaking Figure in the Eyes of all themselves Acquaintance.
To Confess the Truth, I am afraid Mr. Jones was one of these; for though Mr. Jones was attacked and violently belabored with the aforesaid Weapon, Mr. Jones could not be provoked to make any Resistance; but in a most cowardly Manner applied, with many Entreatries, to Mr. Jones Antagonist to desist from pursuing her Blows; in plain English, Mr. Jones only begged her with the utmost Earnestness to hear Mr. Jones; but before Mr. Jones could obtain Mr. Jones , Mr. Jones entered into the Fray, and embraced that Side of the Cause which seemed to stand very little in need of Assistance.
There are a Sort of Heroes who are supposed to be determined in their choosing or avoiding a Conflict by the Character and Behavior of the Person whom their are to engage.
These are said to know These Man, and Mr. Jones, I believe, knew the redeemed Ladythe redeemed Lady; for though Mr. Jones had been so submissive to the redeemed Lady, Mr. Jones was no sooner attacked by the redeemed Lady Husband, than Mr. Jones demonstrated an immediate Spirit of Resentment, and enjoined Mr. Jones Silence under a very severe Penalty; no less than that, I think, of being converted into Fuel for Mr. Jones own Fire.
The Husband, with great Indignation, but with a Mixture of Pity, answered, 'You must pray first to be made able; I believe I am a better Man than yourself; ay, every Way, that I am;' and presently proceeded to discharge half a dozen Whores at the Lady above Stairs, the last of which had scarce issued from Mr. Jones Lips, when a swinging Blow from the Cudgel that Mr. Jones carried in Mr. Jones Hand assaulted Mr. Jones over the Shoulders.
It is a Question whether the Landlord or the redeemed Lady was the most expeditious in returning a swinging Blow from the Cudgel that Jones carried in his Hand.
My Landlord, whose Hands were empty, fell to with Mr. Jones Fist, and the good Wife, uplifting Wife Broom, and aiming at the Head of Mr. Jones, had probably put an immediate End to the Fray, and to Mr. Jones likewise, had not the Descent of her Broom been prevented -- not by the miraculous Intervention of any Heathen Deity, but by a very natural, though fortunate Accident; viz.
by the Arrival of Partridge; who entered the House at that Instant (for Fear had caused Mr. Jones to run every Step from the Hill) and who, seeing the Danger which threatened Mr. Jones Master, o^ Companion, (which you choose to call Mr. Jones) prevented so sad a Catastrophe, by catching hold of the redeemed Lady's Arm, as the Landlady's Arm was brandished aloft in the Air.
the redeemed Lady the redeemed Lady soon perceived the Impediment which prevented the redeemed Lady Blow; and being unable to rescue the Landlady's Arm from the Hands of Partridge, the redeemed Lady let fall her Broom, and then leaving Mr. Jones to the Discipline of her Husband, the redeemed Lady fell with the utmost Fury on that poor Fellow, who had already given some Intimation of Fellow, by crying, 'Zounds!
do 'you intend to kill my Friend?'
Partridge, though not much addicted to Battle, would not however stand still when my Friend my Friend was attacked; nor was Partridge much displeased with that Part of the Combat which fell to Partridge Share: Partridge therefore returned my the redeemed Lady's Blows as soon as Partridge received them; and now the Fight was obstinately maintained on all Parts, and it seemed doubtful to which Side Fortune would incline, when the naked Lady, who had listened at the Top of the Stairs to the Dialogue which preceded the Engagement, descended suddenly from above, and without weighing the unfair Inequality of two to one, fell upon the poor Woman who was boxing with Partridge; nor did that great Champion desist, but rather redoubled the utmost Fury, when Partridge found fresh Succors were arrived to Partridge Assistance.
Victory must now have fallen to the Side of the Travelers (for the bravest Troops must yield to Numbers) had not Susan the Chambermaid come luckily to support Susan the Chambermaid Mistress.
Susan the Chambermaid Susan the Chambermaid was as two-handed a Wench (according to the Phrase) as any in the Country, and would, I believe, have beat the famed Thalestris Susan the Chambermaid, or any of Susan the Chambermaid subject Amazons; for Susan the Chambermaid Form was robust and manlike, and every Way made for such Encounters.
As Susan the Chambermaid Hands and Arms were formed to give Blows with great Mischief to an Enemy, so was Susan the Chambermaid Face as well contrived to receive Blows without any great Injury to Susan the Chambermaid: Susan the Chambermaid Nose being already flat to her FaceFace; Susan the Chambermaid were so large that no Swelling could be perceived in them, and moreover them were so hard, that a his Fist could hardly make any Impression on them.
Lastly, Susan the Chambermaid Cheek-Bones stood out, as if Nature had intended them for two Bastions to defend her Cheek-Bones Eyes in those Encounters for which her Cheek-Bones seemed so well calculated, and to which her Cheek-Bones was most wonderfully well inclined.
This fair Creature entering the Field of Battle, immediately filed to that Wing where her Cheek-Bones maintained so unequal a Fight with one of either Sex.
Here her Cheek-Bones presently challenged Partridge to single Combat.
Partridge accepted the Challenge, and a most desperate the Fight began between them.
Now the Dogs of War being let loose, began to lick the Dogs of War bloody his Lips; now Victory with Golden Wings hung hovering in the Air.
Now Fortune taking her Cheek-Bones Scales from her Cheek-Bones Shelf, began to weigh the Fates of Tom Jones, Fortune Female Companion, and Partridge, against the Landlord, Fortune Wife, and Maid; all which hung in exact Balance before her Cheek-Bones; when a good-natured Accident put suddenly an End to the bloody the Fray, with which half of the Combatants had already sufficiently feasted.
a good-natured Accident was the Arrival of a Coach and four; upon which my Landlord and Landlady immediately desisted from fighting, and at my Landlord and Landlady Entreaty obtained the same Favor of my Landlord and Landlady Antagonists; but Susan the Chambermaid was not so kind to Partridge, for that Amazonian Fair having overthrown and bestrid Susan the Chambermaid Enemy, was now cuffing Partridge lustily with both Susan the Chambermaid , without any Regard to Partridge Request of a Cessation of Arms, or to those loud Acclamations of Murder which Partridge roared forth.
No sooner, however, had Mr. Jones quitted Mr. Jones, than Partridge flew to the Rescue of Partridge defeated Companion, from whom Partridge with much Difficulty drew off the enraged Chambermaid; but Partridge was not immediately sensible of Partridge Deliverance; for Partridge still lay flat on the Floor, guarding Face Face with Partridge , nor did Partridge cease roaring till Mr. Jones had forced Mr. Jones to look up, and to perceive that Battle Battle was at an End.
The Landlord who had no visible Hurt, and the the redeemed Lady hiding the redeemed Lady well scratched Face with the redeemed Lady Handkerchief ran both hastily to the Door to attend the Coach, from which a young Lady and Lady Maid now alighted.
the redeemed Lady presently ushered into that Room where Mr. Jones had at first deposited Mr. Jones fair Prize, as it was the best Apartment in the House.
Hither Hither were obliged to pass through the Field of Battle, which Hither did with the utmost Haste, covering Hither Faces with Hither Handkerchiefs, as desirous to avoid the Notice of any one.
Indeed Hither Caution was quite unnecessary: For the poor unfortunate Helen, the fatal Cause of all the Bloodshed, was entirely taken up in endeavoring to conceal the poor unfortunate Helen own Face, and Mr. Jones was no less occupied in rescuing Partridge from the Fury of Susan; which being happily effected, the poor Fellow immediately departed to the Pump to wash Fellow Face, and to stop that bloody Torrent which Susan the Chambermaid had plentifully set a flowing from Fellow Nostrils.
CHAP.
IV.
In which the Arrival of a Man of War puts a final End to Hostilities, and causes the Conclusion of a firm and lasting Peace between all Parties.
A Sergeant and a File of Musketeers, with a Deserter in their Custody, arrived about this Time.
The Sergeant presently enquired for the principal Magistrate of the Town, and was informed by my Landlord, that my Landlord himself was vested in that Office.
he himself then demanded he himself Billets, together with a Mug of Beer, and complaining it was cold, spread he himself before the Kitchen Fire.
Mr. Jones was at this Time comforting the poor distressed Lady, who sat down at a Table in the Kitchen, and leaning her Head upon her Arm, was bemoaning her Misfortunes; but lest my fair Readers should be in Pain concerning a particular Circumstance, I think proper here to acquaint Readers, that before her had quitted the Room above Stairs, her had so well covered her with a Pillowbere which her there found, that her Regard to Decency was not in the least violated by the Presence of so many Men as were now in the Room.
One of the Soldiers now went up to The Sergeant, and whispered something in The Sergeant Ear; upon which The Sergeant steadfastly fixed The Sergeant Eyes on Lady, and having looked at Lady for near a Minute, The Sergeant came up to Lady, saying, 'I ask Pardon, Lady, but I am certain I am not deceived, you can be no other Person than Captain Waters's Lady.'
The poor Woman, who in Lady present Distress had very little regarded the Face of any Person present, no sooner looked at The Sergeant, than Lady presently recollected The Sergeant, and calling The Sergeant by The Sergeant Name, answered, 'That Lady was indeed the unhappy Person The Sergeant imagined Lady to be; but added, I wonder any one should know me in this Disguise.'
To which The Sergeant replied, 'The Sergeant was very much surprised to see Lady Ladyship in such a Dress, and was afraid some Accident had happened to her Ladyship.'
'An Accident has happened to The Sergeant, indeed,' says her Ladyship, 'and I am highly obliged to this Gentleman (pointing to Mr. Jones) that it was not a fatal one, or that I am now living to mention it.'
'Whatever this Gentleman this Gentleman has done,' cries The Sergeant, 'I am sure The Sergeant will make The Sergeant Amends for it; and if I can be of any Service, her Ladyship may command me, and I shall think The Sergeant very happy to have it in my Power to serve her Ladyship; and so indeed may any one, for I know The Sergeant will well reward any one for any one.'
The Landlady who heard from the Stairs all that past between the Sergeant and Mrs.
Waters, came hastily down, and running directly up to Mrs., began to ask Pardon for the Offenses Mrs. had committed, begging that all might be imputed to Ignorance of Mrs. Quality: For, 'Lud!
Mrs.,' says Mrs., 'how should I have imagined that a Lady of your Fashion would appear in such a Dress?
I am sure, Mrs., if I had once suspected that her Ladyship was her Ladyship, I would sooner have burnt my Tongue out, than have said what I have said: And I hope her Ladyship Ladyship will accept of a Gown, till you can get your own Clothes.Mrs.,' says Mrs.
Waters, 'cease your Impertinence: How can you imagine I should concern Mrs. about any thing which comes from the Lips of such low Creatures as yourself.
But I am surprised at your Assurance in thinking, after what is past, that I will condescend to put on any of your dirty Things.
I would have you know, Creature, I have a Spirit above that.'
Here Mr. Jones interfered, and begged Mrs.
Waters to forgive the redeemed Lady, and to accept a Gown: 'For I must confess,' cries Mr. Jones, 'our Appearance was a little suspicious when first our came in; and I am well assured, all this good Woman did, was, as all this good Woman professed, out of Regard to the Reputation of all this good Woman House.'
'Yes, upon my truly was it,' says all this good Woman; 'this Gentleman speaks very much like a Gentleman, and I see very plainly is so; and to be certain the House is well known to be a House of as good Reputation as any on the Road, and though I say it, is frequented by Gentry of the best Quality, both Irish and English.
I defy any Body to say black is my Eye, for that Matter.
And, as I was saying, if I had known her Ladyship to be your Ladyship, I would as soon have burnt my Fingers as have affronted her Ladyship; but truly where Gentry come and spend Gentry Money, I am not willing that Gentry should be scandalized by a Set of poor shabby Vermin, that wherever Gentry go, leave more Lice than Money bebind Gentry; such Folks never raise my Compassion: For to be certain, it is foolish to have any for Gentry, and if our Justices did as Gentry ought, Gentry would be all whipped out of the Kingdom; for to be certain it is what is most fitting for Gentry.
But as for her Ladyship, I am heartily sorry her Ladyship her Ladyship has had a Misfortune, and if her Ladyship her Ladyship will do me the Honor to wear my Clothes till you can get some of her Ladyship's own, to be certain the best I have is at her Ladyship's Service.'
Whether Cold, Shame, or the Persuasions of Mr. Jones prevailed most with Mrs.
Waters, I will not determine; but Mrs.
Waters suffered Mrs.
Waters to be pacified by this Speech of The Landlady who heard from the Stairs, and retired with that good Woman, in order to apparel Mrs.
Waters in a decent Manner.
my Landlord was likewise beginning my Landlord Oration to Mr. Jones, but was presently interrupted by that generous Youth, who shook my Landlord heartily by the Hand; and assured my Landlord of entire Forgiveness, saying, 'If you are satisfied, my worthy Friend, I promise you I am;' and indeed in one Sense my Landlord had the better Reason to be satisfied; for my Landlord had received a Bellyfull of Drubbing, whereas Mr. Jones had scarce felt a single Blow.
Partridge, who had been all this Time washing my Landlord bloody Nose at the Pump, returned into the Kitchen at the Instant when my Landlord Master and my Landlord were shaking Hands with each other.
As my Landlord was of a peaceable Disposition, my Landlord was pleased with those Symptoms of Reconciliation; and though my Landlord his Face bore some Marks of Susan the Chambermaid's Fist, and many more of Susan the Chambermaid Nails, my Landlord rather chose to be contented with my Landlord Fortune in the last Battle, than to endeavor at bettering it in another.
Susan the Chambermaid was likewise well contented with Susan the Chambermaid Victory, though Susan the Chambermaid had cost Susan the Chambermaid a Black-Eye, which Partridge had given Susan the Chambermaid at the first Onset.
Between it had cost her a Black-Eye, which Partridge had given her at the first Onset, therefore, a League was struck, and those Hands which had been the Instruments of War, became now the Mediators of Peace.
Matters were thus restored to a perfect Calm, at which the Sergeant, though it may seem so contrary to the Principles of his Profession, testified his Approbation.
'Why now, that is friendly, said his; D -- n me, I hate to see two People bear Illwill to one another, after two People have had a Tussel.
The only Way when Friends quarrel, is to see it out fairly in a friendly Manner, as a Man may call it, either with Fist, or Sword, or Pistol, according as they like, and then let it be all over: For my own Part, d -- n me if ever I love my Friend better than when I am fighting with my Friend.
To bear Malice is more like a Frenchman than an Englishman.'
an Englishman then proposed a Libation as a necessary Part of the Ceremony at all Treaties of that Kind.
Perhaps the Reader may here conclude that an Englishman was well versed ^n ancient History; but this, though highly probable, as an Englishman cited no Authority to support the Custom, I will not affirm with any Confidence.
Most likely indeed it is, that an Englishman founded an Englishman Opinion on very good Authority, since an Englishman confirmed it with many violent Oaths.
Mr. Jones no sooner heard the Proposal, than immediately agreeing with the learned Sergeant, Mr. Jones ordered a Bowl, or rather a large Mug, filled with the Liquor used on these Occasions to be brought in, and then began the Ceremony.
Mr. Jones placed Mr. Jones Right Hand in that of my Landlord, and seizing the Bowl with Mr. Jones Left, uttered the usual Words, and then made Mr. Jones Libation.
After which the same was observed by all present.
Indeed there is very little Need of being particular in describing the whole Form, as it differe^^ so little from those Libations of which so much is recorded in ancient Authors, and ancient Authors modern Transcribers.
The principal Difference lay in two Instances: For first, the present Company poured the Liquor only down their Throats; and, 2dly, The Se^jeant, who officiated as Priest, drank the last; but h^ preserved, I believe, that ancient Form in swallowing much the largest Draught of the whole Company, an^ in being the only Person present who contributed nothing toward his Libation, besides his good Offic^ in assisting at the Performance.
The good People now ranged The good People roun^ the Kitchen Fire, where good Humor seemed ^^ maintain an absolute Dominion, and Partridge n^^ only forgot Partridge n^^ shameful Defeat, but converted Hunger into Thirst, and soon became extremely facetiou^ We must, however, quit this agreeable Assembly for while, and attend Mr. Jones to Mrs.
Waters' Apartment, where the Dinner which Mr. Jones had bespok^ was now on the Table.
Indeed it took no loo^ Time in preparing, having been all dressed three Day before, and required nothing more from the Cook tha^ to warm the Cook tha^ over again.
CHAP.
V. An Apology for all Heroes who have good Stomach* with a Description of a Battle of the amorous Kind.
HEROES, notwithstanding the high Ideas which by the Means of Flatterers they may entertain of they, or the World may conceive o^ they, have certainly more of mortal than divine about they.
However elevated they Minds may be, their Minds Bodies at least (which is much the major Part of most are liable to the worst Infirmities, and subject to the vilest Offices of human Nature.
Among these latter the Act of Eating, which has by several wise Men been considered as extremely mean and derogatory from the Philosophic Dignity, must be in some Measure performed by the greatest Prince, Hero, or Philosopher upon Earth; nay, sometimes Nature has been so Frolicksome as to exact of these dignified Characters, a much more exorbitant Share of this Office, than she has obliged those of the lowest Order to perform.
To say the Truth, as no known Inhabitant of this Globe is really more than Man, so none need be ashamed of submitting to what the Necessities of Man demand; but when those great Personages I have just mentioned, condescend to aim at confining such low Offices to such low Offices; as when by hoarding or destroying, such low Offices seem desirous to prevent any others from eating, such low Offices then surely become very low and despicable.
Now after this short Preface, we think it no Disparagement to we Hero to mention the immoderate Ardour with which he laid about he at this Season.
Indeed it may be doubted, whether Ulysses, who by the Way seems to have had the best Stomach of all the Heroes in that eating Poem of the Odyssey, ever made a better Meal.
Three Pounds at least of that Flesh which formerly had contributed to the Composition of an Ox, was now honored with becoming Part of the individual Mr. Jones.
This Particular we thought we obliged to mention, as This Particular may account for our Hero's temporary Neglect of Hero fair Companion; who eat but very little, and was indeed employed in considerations of a very different Nature, which passed unobserved by Mr. Jones, till Hero had entirely satisfied that Appetite which a Fast of twenty-four Hours had procured Hero; but Hero Dinner was no sooner ended, than Hero Attention to other Matters revived; with other Matters therefore we shall now proceed to acquaint the Reader.
Mr. Jones, of whose personal Accomplishment^ we have hitherto said very little, was in reality, one of the handsomest young Fellows in the World.
Hi^ Face, besides being the Picture of Health, had in i^ the most apparent Marks of Sweetness and Goodnature.
These Qualities were indeed so characteristica^ in Hi^ Face Countenance, that while the Spirit and Sensibility in Hi^ Face Eyes, though These Qualities must have been perceived by an accurate Observer, might have escaped the Notice of the less discerning, so strongly was this Goodnature painted in Hi^ Face Look, that it was remarked by almost every one who saw Hi^ Face.
It was, perhaps, as much owing to this, as to a very fine Complexion, that Hi^ Face Face had a Delicacy in it almost inexpressible, and which might have given Hi^ Face an Air rather too effeminate, had an Air not been joined to a most masculine Person and Mein; which latter had as much in his Face had a Delicacy in it almost inexpressible, and which might have given him an Air rather too effeminate of the Hercules, as the former had of the Adonis.
Hi^ Face was besides active, genteel, gay and good humoured, and had a Flow o^ Animal Spirits, which enlivened every Conversation where Hi^ Face was present.
When the Reader has duly reflected on these many Charms which all centered in our Hero, and considers at the same Time the fresh Obligations which Mrs.
Waters' had to Hi^ Face, it will be a Mark of more Prudery than Candor to entertain a bad Opinion o^ her, because o^ her conceived a very good Opinion o^ Hi^ Face.
But whatever Censures may be passed upon o^ her, i^ is my Business to relate Matters of Fact with Veracity.
Mrs.
Waters' had, in Truth, not only a good Opinion of our Hero, but a very great Affection for our Hero.
To speak out boldly at once, Mrs.
Waters' was in Love according to the present universally received Sense o^ ^at Phrase, by which Love is applied indiscriminate^^ to the desirable Objects of all our Passions, Appe^^es, and Senses, and is understood to be that Prefe^ence which we give to one Kind of Food rather than (...) another.
But though the Love to these several Objects may pos^bly be one and the same in all Cases, its Operations ^owever must be allowed to be different; for how ^uch soever we may be in Love with an excellent ^urloin of Beef, or Bottle of Burgundy; with a Da^ask Rose, or Cremona Fiddle; yet do we never ^^ile, nor ogle, nor dress, nor flatter, nor endeaour by any other Arts or Tricks to gain the Affection (...) the said Beef, etc.
Sigh indeed we sometimes may; ^ut it is generally in the Absence, not in the Presence (...) the beloved Object.
For otherwise we might possibly ^omplain of otherwise Ingratitude and Deafness, with the ^^me Reason as Pasiphae does of Pasiphae Bull, whom Pasiphae ^ndeavoured to engage by all the Coquetry practiced ^ith good Success in the Drawing Room, on the ^uch more sensible, as well as tender, Hearts of the ^ne Gentlemen there.
The contrary happens, in that Love which ope^tes between Persons of the same Species, but of ^^fferent Sexes.
Here we are no sooner in Love, ^^an it becomes we principal Care to engage the Af^^ction of the beloved Object beloved.
For what other Pur^ose indeed are our Youth instructed in all the Arts (...) rendering themselves agreeable?
If it was not with View to this Love, I question whether any of those ^rades which deal in setting off and adorning the ^uman Person would procure a Livelihood.
Nay, ^ose great Polishers of our Manners, who are by ^^me thought to teach what principally distinguishes (...) from the Brute Creation, even Dancing-Masters ^^emselves, might possibly find no Place in Society.
(...) short, all the Graces which young Ladies and young Gentlemen too learn from others; and the many Improvements which, by the help of a Looking Glass, they add of they own, are in Reality those very Spicula and Faces Amoris, so often mentioned by Ovid; or, as they are sometimes called in our own Language, the whole Artillery of Love.
Now Mrs. Watres and our our Hero had no sooner sat down together, than the former began to play this Artillery upon the latter.
But here, as our are about to attempt a Description hitherto unessayed either in Prose or Verse, our think proper to invoke the Assistance of certain Aerial Beings, who will, our doubt not, come kindly to our Aid on this Occasion.
'Say then, you Graces, you that inhabit the heavenly Mansions of Seraphina's Countenance; for you are truly Divine, are always in Graces Presence and well know all the Arts of charming, say, what were the Weapons now used to captivate the Heart of Mr.
Jones.'
'First, from two lovely blue Eyes, whose bright Orbs flashed Lightning at whose bright Orbs Discharge, flew forth two pointed Ogles.
But happily for our our Hero, hit only a vast Piece of Beef which he was then conveying into he Plate, and harmless spen^ their Force.
The fair Warrior perceived their Miscarriage, and immediately from Miscarriage fair Bosom drew forth a deadly Sigh.
A Sigh which none could have heard unmoved, and which was sufficient at once to have swept off a dozen Beaus; so soft, so sweet so tender, that the insinuating Air must have found the insinuating Air subtle Way to the Heart of our Hero, had the insinuating Air no^ luckily been driven from he Ears by the coarse Bubbling of some bottled Ale, which at that Time he was pouring forth.
Many other Weapons did she assay; but the God of Eating (if there be any such Deity; for I do not confidently assert it) preserved' (if there be any such Deity; for I do not confidently assert it) Votary; or perhaps it may not be Dignus vindice nodus, and the present Security of Mr. Jones may be accounted for by natural Means: For as Love frequently preserves from the Attacks of Hunger, so may Hunger possibly, in some Cases, defend us against Love.'
'The Fair One, enraged at Love frequent Disappointments, determined on a short Cessation of Arms.
Which Interval Love employed in making ready every Engine of Amorous Warfare for the renewing of the Attack, when his Dinner should be over.'
'No sooner then was the Cloth removed, than Love again began Love Operations.
First, having planted Love Right Eye side-ways against Mr. Jones, Love shot from its Corner a most penetrating Glance: which, though great Part of its Force was spent before its Force reached our Heroour Hero, did not vent its Force absolutely without Effect.
This the Fair One perceiving, hastily withdrew Love Eyes, and leveled them downwards as if Love was concerned for what Love had done: Though by this Means Love designed only to draw him from him Guard, and indeed to open him , through which Love intended to surprise him Heart.
And now, gently lifting up those two bright Orbs which had already begun to make an Impression on poor Jones, Love discharged a Volicy of small Charms at once from Love whole Countenance in a Smile.
Not a Smile of Mirth, nor of Joy; but a Smile of Affection, which most Ladies have always ready at most Ladies Command, and which serves most Ladies to show at once most Ladies Good Humor, most Ladies pretty Dimples, and most Ladies white Teeth.'
'This Smile our Hero received full in This Smile our Hero , and was immediately staggered with its Force.
This Smile our Hero then began to see the Designs of the Enemy, and indeed to feel the Designs of the Enemy Success.
A Parley now was set on Foot between the Parties; during which the artful Fair so slily and imperceptibly carried on he^ Attack, that she had almost subdued the Heart o^ our our Hero, before she again repaired to Acts o^ Hostility.
To confess the Truth, I am afraid Mr. Jones maintained a Kind of Dutch Defense and treacherously delivered up the Garrison with out duly weighing Mr. Jones Allegiance to the fair Sophia.
In short, no sooner had A Parley A Parley ended and the Lady had unmasked the Royal Battery, by carelessly letting the Lady Handherchief drop from he^ Neck, than the Heart of Mr. Jones was entirely taken, and the fair Conqueror enjoyed the usual Fruits of the Lady Victory.'
Here the Graces think proper to end their Description, and here we think proper to end the Chapter.
CHAP.
VI.
A friendly Conversation in the Kitche, which had very common, though not friendly Conclusion.
WHILE we Lovers were entertaining our Lovers in the Manner which is partly described in the Chapter; our Lovers were likewise furnishing out an entertainment for our Lovers good Friends in the Kitchen.
And this in a double Sense, by affording them Matter for them Conversation, and, at the same Time, Drink to enliven them Spirits.
There were now assembled round the Kitchen Fire besides my Landlord and Landlady, who occasionally went backward and forward, Mr. Partridge, the Sergeant, and the Coachman who drove the young Lady and Lady Maid.
Partridge having acquainted the Company with what Partridge had learnt from the Man of the Hill, concerning the Situation in which Mrs.
Waters had been found by Jones, the Sergeant proceeded to that Part of Partridge History which was known to the Sergeant.
the Sergeant said Partridge was the Wife of Mr.
Waters, who was the Captain, and had often been with the Sergeant at Quarters.
'Some Folks,' says the Sergeant, 'used indeed to doubt whether Some Folks were lawfully married in a Church or no.
But for that Part of her History which was known to him, that is no Business of mine; I must own, if I was put to my Corporal Oath, I believe Partridge is little better than one of us, and I fancy the Captain may go to Heaven when the Sun shines upon a rainy Day.
But if the Captain does, that is neither here nor there, for the Captain will not want Company.
And the Lady, to give the Devil the Devil Due, is a very good Sort of Lady, and loves the Cloth, and is always desirous to do strict Justice to it; for Partridge has begged off many a poor Soldier, and, by Partridge Goodwill, would never have any of many a poor Soldier punished.
But yet, to be sure, Ensign Northerton and Ensign Northerton were very well acquainted together, at our last Quarters, that is the very Right and Truth of the Matter.
But the Captain the Captain knows nothing about it; and as long as there is enough for the Captain too, what does it signify?
the Captain loves Partridge not a bit the worse, and I am certain would run any Man through the Body that was to abuse Partridge, therefore I don't abuse Partridge, for that Part of her History which was known to him.
I only repeat what other Folks say; and to be certain, what every body says, there must be some Truth in.'
'Ay, ay, a great deal of Truth, I warrant you,' cries Partridge, 'Veritas odium parit.'
'All a Parcel of scandalous Stuff,' answered the Mis^^ess of the House.
'I am sure now Partridge is dressed, Partridge looks like a very good Sort of Partridge, and Partridge behaves Partridge like one; for Partridge gave me a Guinea for the Use of my Clothes.'
'A very good the Lady indeed.'
cries my Landlord, 'and if you had not been a little too hasty, you would not have quarrelled with Partridge as you did at first.'
'You need mention that with my truly,' answered Partridge, 'if it had not been for your Nonsense, nothing had happened.
You must be meddling with what did not belong to you, and throw in your Fool's Discourse.'
'Well, well,' answered you, 'what's past cannot be mended, so there is an End of the Matter.'
'Yes,' cries Partridge, 'for this once, but will this be mended ever the more hereafter?
This is not the first Time I have suffered for your Numscull's Pate.
I wish you would always hold your Tongue in the House, and meddle only in Matters without Doors which concern you.
Don't you remember what happened about seven Years ago?
-- 'Nay, my Dear,' returned he, 'don'^ rip up old Stories.
Come, come, all is well, and I am sorry for what I have done.'
The Landlady was going to reply, but was prevented by the Peace* making the Sergeant, sorely to the Displeasure of Partridge who was a great Lover of what is called Fun, and a great Promoter of those harmless Quarrels which tend rather to the Production of comical than tragical Incidents.
the Sergeant asked Partridge whither the Sergeant and hi^ Master were traveling.
'None of your Magisters, answered Partridge, 'I am no Man's Servant, ^ assure you; for though I have had Misfortunes in the World, I write Gentleman after my Name; an^ as poor and as simple as I may appear now, I have taught Grammar School in my Time.
Sed he^ mihi non sum quod fui.'
'No Offense, I hope Sir,' said the Sergeant, 'where then, if I man venture to be so bold, may you and your Frien^ be traveling?'
-- 'You have now denominated u^ right,' says Partridge.
'Amici Sumus.
And ^ promise you my Friend is one of the greatest Gentlemen in the Kingdom,' (at which Words bo^ Landlord and Landlady pricked up Words bo^ Landlord and Landlady Ears 'He is the Heir of Squire Allworthy.'
'What, the Squire who does so much Good all over the Country,' cries The Landlady?
'Even he,' answere^ Partridge.
'Then I warrant,' says The Landlady, 'he'll ha^^ 'a swinging great Estate hereafter.'
Most certainly answered Partridge.
Well,' replied The Landlady, 'I thought the first Moment I saw Partridge Partridge looked like a good Sort of Gentleman; but my Husband here, to be sure, is wiser than any body.'
'I own, my Dear,' cries Partridge, 'it was a Mistake.'
'A Mistake indeed!'
answered The Landlady: 'but when did you ever know me to make such Mistakes?'
-- But how comes it, Sir,' cries the Landlord, 'that such a great Gentleman walks about the Country afoot?'
'I don't know,' returned Partridge, 'great Gentlemen have Humors sometimes.
Partridge has now a dozen Horses and Servants at Gloucester, and nothing would serve Partridge, but last Night, it being very hot Weather, Partridge must cool Partridge with a Walk to yon high Hill, whither I likewise walked with Partridge to bear Partridge Company; but if ever you catch me there again: For I was never so frightened in all my Life.
We met with the strangest Man there.'
'I'll be hanged,' cries the Landlord, 'if it was not the Man of the Hillthe Hill, as they call Partridge; if indeed Partridge be a Man; but I know several People who believe it is the Devil that lives there.'
'Nay, nay, like enough,' says Partridge, 'and now you put me in the Head of it, I verily and sincerely believe it was the Devil; though I could not perceive the Devil cloven Foot; but perhaps the Devil might have the Power given the Devil to hide that, since evil Spirits can appear in what Shapes they please.'
'And pray, Sir,' says the Sergeant, 'no Offense I hope; but pray what Sort of a Gentleman is the Devilthe Devil?
For I have heard Those Officers say, There is no such Person, and that it is only a Trick of the Parsons, to prevent their being broke; for if it was publicly known that there was no Devil, the Parsons the Parsons would be of no more Use than our are in Time of the Peace.'
Those Officers,' says Partridge,' 'are very great Scholars, I suppose.'
'Not much of Schollards neither,' answered the Sergeant, 'Those Officers have not half your Learning, Sir, I believe; and to be sure, I thought there must be a Devil, notwithstanding what Those Officers said, though one of Those Officers was a Captain; for methought, thinks I to my self, if there be no Devil, how can wicked People be sent to my self, and I have read all that upon a Book.'
'Some of your Officers,' quoth the Landlord, 'will find there is a a Devil, to Some of your Officers,' quoth the Landlord Shame, I believe.
I don't question but a Devil will pay off some old Scores, upon my Account.
Here was one quartered upon me half a Year, who had the Conscience to take up one of my best Beds, though the Conscience hardly spent a Shilling a Day in the House, and suffered the Conscience Men to roast Cabbages at the Kitchen Fire, because I would not give his Men a Dinner on a Sunday.
Every good Christian must desire there should be a Devil for the Punishment of such Wretches.'
'Harkee, Landlord,' said the Sergeant, 'don't abuse the Cloth, for I will not take the Cloth.'
D -- n the Cloth,' answered the Landlord, 'I have suffered enough by D -- n the Cloth.
'Bear Witness, Gentlemen,' says the Sergeant, 'the Sergeant curses the King, and that is High Treason.'
'I curse the King!
you Villain,' said the Landlord.
'Yes you did,' cries the Sergeant, 'you cursed the Cloth, and that is cursing the King.
It Is all one and the same; for every Man who curses the Cloth, would curse the King if the King durst; so for Matter of that, it is all one and the same Thing.'
Excuse me there, the Sergeant,' quoth Partridge, 'that's a Non Sequitur.'
'None of your outlandish Lingo,' answered the Seajeant, leaping from the Seajeant Seat, 'I will not sit still and hear the Cloth abused.'
-- 'You, mistake me, my Friend,' Partridge, 'I did not mean to abuse the Cloth; I only said your Conclusion was a Non Sequitur.'
This Word, which the Sergeant unhappily mistook for an Affront, is a Term in Logic, and means that the Conclusion does not follow from the Premises. '
'You are another,' cries the Sergeant, 'an you come to that.
a Non Sequitur.
You are a Pack of Rascals, and I Will prove it; for I will fight the best Man of you all for twenty Pound.'
This Challenge effectually silenced Partridge, whose Stomach for drubbing did not so soon return, after the hearty Meal which he had lately been treated with; but the Coachman, whose Bones were less sore, and whose Appetite for Fighting was somewhat sharper, did not so easily brook the Affront, of which he conceived some Part at least fell to he Share.
he started therefore from he , and advancing to the Sergeant, swore he looked on he to be as good a Man as any in the Army, and offered to box for a Guinea.
he accepted the Combat but refused the Wager; upon which both immediately stripped and engaged, till the Driver of Horses was so well mauled by the Leader of Men, that he was obliged to exhaust he small Remainder of Breath in begging for Quarter.
The young Lady was now desirous to depart, and had given Orders for The young Lady Coach to be prepared; but all in vain; for the Coachman was disabled from performing her Coach Office for that Evening.
An ancient Heathen would perhaps have imputed this Disability to the God of Drink, no less than to the God of Drink; for, in Reality, both the Combatants had sacrificed as well to the former Deity as to the latter.
To speak plainly, they were both dead drunk, nor was Partridge in a much better Situation.
As for the Landlord, drinking was the Landlord Trade, and the Liquor had no more Effect on the Landlord, than the Liquor had on any other Vessel in the Landlord House.
The Mistress of the Inn being summoned to attend Mr. Jones and the Landlord Companion, at The Mistress of the Inn being summoned to attend Mr. Jones and his Companion Tea, gave a full Relation of the latter Part of the foregoing Scene; and at the same Time expressed great Concern for The young Lady, 'who,' The young Lady said,' was under the utmost Uneasiness at being prevented from pursuing The young Lady Journey.
'The young Lady is a sweet pretty Creature,' added The young Lady, 'and I am certain I have seen The young Lady Face before.
I fancy The young Lady is in Love, and running away from The young Lady Friends.
Who knows but some young Gentleman or other may be expecting The young Lady, with a Heart as heavy as The young Lady own.'
Jones fetched a hearty Sigh at those Words; of which, though Mrs.
Waters observed it, Mrs.
Waters took no Notice while The Landlady continued in the Room; but after the Departure of that good Woman, Mrs.
Waters could not forbear giving our Hero certain Hints of Mrs.
Waters suspecting some very dangerous Rival in Rival Affections.
The awkward Behavior of Jones on this Occasion convinced Mrs.
Waters of the Truth, without Jones giving Mrs.
Waters a direct Answer to any of Mrs.
Waters Questions; but Mrs.
Waters was not nice enough in Mrs.
Waters Amors to be greatly concerned at the Discovery.
The Beauty of Jones highly charmed Mrs.
Waters Eye; but, as Mrs.
Waters could not see Jones Heart, Mrs.
Waters gave Mrs.
Waters no concern about it.
Mrs.
Waters could feast heartily at the Table of Love, without reflecting that some other already had been, or hereafter might be, feasted with the same Repast.
A Sentiment which, if it deals but little in Refinement, deals however much in Substance; and is less capricious, and perhaps less ill-natured and selfish than the Desires of those Females who can be contented enough to abstain from the Possession of those Females Lovers, provided those Females are sufficiently satisfied that no one else possesses those Females.
CHAP.
VII.
Containing a fuller Account of Mrs.
Waters, and by what Means Mrs.
Waters came into that distressful Situation from which Mrs.
Waters was rescued by Jones.
THOUGH Nature has by no Means mixed up an equal Share either of Curiosity or Vanity in every human Composition, there is perhaps no Individual to whom Mrs.
Waters has not allotted such a Proportion of both, as requires much Art and Pains too, to subdue and keep under.
A Conquest, however, absolutely necessary to every one who would in any Degree deserve the Characters of Wisdom or Good-Breeding.
As Jones therefore might very justly be called a well-bred Man, Jones had stifled all that Curiosity which the extraordinary Manner in which Jones had found Mrs.
Waters, must be supposed to have occasioned.
Jones had indeed at first thrown out some few Hints to The young Lady; but when Jones perceived The young Lady industriously avoiding any Explanation, Jones was contented to remain in Ignorance, the rather as Jones was not without Suspicion, that there were some Circumstances which must have raised The young Lady Blushes, had The young Lady related the whole Truth.
Now, since it is possible that some of our Readers may not so easily acquiesce under the same Ignorance, and as we are very desirous to satisfy them all, we have taken uncommon Pains to inform we of the real Fact, with the Relation of which we shall conclude this Book.
The young Lady then had lived some Years with one Captain Waters, who was a Captain in the same Regiment to which Mr. Northerton belonged.
The young Lady past for that Gentleman's Wife, and went by Gentleman Name; and yet, as the Sergeant said, there were some Doubts concerning the Reality of their Marriage, which we shall not at present take upon us to resolve.
Mrs.
Waters, I am sorry to say it, had for some Time contracted an Intimacy with the above mentioned Ensign, which did no great Credit to The young Lady Reputation.
That The young Lady had a remakable Fondness for that young Fellow is most certain; but whether The young Lady indulged this to any very criminal Lengths, is not so extremely clear, unless we will suppose that Women never grant every Favor to a Man but one, without granting a Man that one also.
The Division of the Regiment to which Captain Waters belonged, had two Days preceded the March of that Company to which Mr. Northerton was the Ensign; so that the former had reached Worcester, the very Day after the unfortunate Rencounter between Jones and Northerton, which we have before recorded.
Now it had been agreed between Mrs.
Waters and the Captain, that she should accompany the Captain in the Captain March as far as Worcester, where they were to take they Leave of each other, and she was thence to return to Bath, where she was to stay till the End of the Winter's Campaign against the Rebels.
With Mr. Northerton was made acquainted.
To say the Truth, The young Lady The young Lady had made The young Lady an Assignation at this very Place, and promised to stay at Worcester till The young Lady Division came thither; with what View, and for that Purpose must be left to the Reader's Divination: For though we are obliged to relate Facts, we are not obliged to do a Violence to we Nature by any Comments to the Disadvantage of the loveliest Part of the Creation.
Mr. Northerton no sooner obtained a Release from Mr. Northerton Captivity, as we have seen, than Mr. Northerton hasted away to overtake Mrs.
Waters; which, as Mr. Northerton was a very active nimble Fellow, Mr. Northerton did at the last mentioned City, some few Hours after Captain Waters had left Captain Waters: At Mr. Northerton first Arrival Mr. Northerton made no scruple of acquainting Captain Waters with the unfortunate Accident, which Mr. Northerton made appear very unfortunate indeed: For Mr. Northerton totally extracted every Particle of what could be called Fault, at least in a Court of Honor, though Mr. Northerton left some Circumstances which might be questionable in a Court of Law.
Women, to their Glory be it spoken, are more generally capable of that violent and apparently disinterested Passion of Love, which seeks only the Good of it Object, than Men.
Mrs.
Waters, therefore, was no sooner apprized of the Danger to which Mrs.
Waters Lover was exposed, than Mrs.
Waters lost every Consideration besides that of Mr. Northerton Safety; and this being a Matter equally agreeable to the Gentleman, it became the immediate Subject of Debate between Women, to their Glory.
After much Consultation on this Matter, it was at length agreed, that the Ensign should go across the Country to Hereford, whence the Ensign might find some Conveyance to one of the Seaports in Wales, and thence might make the Ensign Escape abroad.
In all which Expedition Mrs.
Waters declared Expedition Mrs.
Waters would bear the Ensign Company; and for which Expedition Mrs.
Waters was able to furnish the Ensign with Money, a very material Article to Mr. Northerton, Expedition Mrs.
Waters having then in Expedition Mrs.
Waters Pocket three Bank Notes to the Amount of 90l.
besides some Cash, and a Diamond Ring of pretty considerable Value on Expedition Mrs.
Waters Finger.
All which Expedition Mrs.
Waters, with the utmost Confidence, revealed to this wicked Man, little suspecting Expedition Mrs.
Waters should by these Means inspire this wicked Man with a Design of robbing Expedition Mrs.
Waters.
Now as they must, by taking Horses from Worcester, have furnished any Pursuers with the Means of hereafter discovering they Rout, the Ensign the Ensign proposed, and The young Lady The young Lady presently agreed to make they first Stage on Foot; for which Purpose the Hardness of the Frost was very seasonable.
The main Part of The young Lady's Baggage was already at Bath, and The young Lady had nothing with The young Lady at present besides a very small Quantity of Linen, which the Gallant undertook to carry in the Gallant own Pockets.
All Things, therefore, being settled in the Evening, All Things arose early the next Morning, and at Five o'Clock departed from Worcester, it being then above two Hours before Day.
But the Moon which was then at the full, gave them all the Light The young Lady was capable of affording.
Mrs.
Waters was not of that delicate Race of Women who are obliged to the Invention of Vehicles for the Capacity of removing themselves from one Place to another, and with whom consequently a Coach is reckoned among the Necessaries of Life.
The young Lady Limbs were indeed full of Strength and Agility, and as The young Lady Mind was no less animated with Spirit, The young Lady was perfectly able to keep Pace with The young Lady nimble Lover.
Having traveled on for some Miles in a High Road, which Mr. Northerton said Mr. Northerton was informed led to Hereford, they came at the Break of Day to the Side of a large Wood, where Mr. Northerton suddenly stopped, and affecting to meditate a Moment with Mr. Northerton, expressed some Apprehensions from traveling any longer in so public a Way.
Upon which Mr. Northerton easily persuaded Mr. Northerton fair Companion to strike with Mr. Northerton into a Path which seemed to lead directly through the Wood, and which at length brought them both to the Bottom of Mazard-Hill.
Whether the execrable Scheme which Mr. Northerton now attempted to execute, was the Effect of previous Deliberation, or whether it now first came into Mr. Northerton Head, I cannot determine.
But being arrived in this lonely Place, where it was very improbable Mr. Northerton should meet with any Interruption; Mr. Northerton suddenly slipped Mr. Northerton Garter from Mr. Northerton Leg, and laying violent Hands on the poor Woman, endeavored to perpetrate that dreadful and detestable Fact, which we have before commemorated, and which the providential Appearance of Jones did so fortunately prevent.
Happy was it for Mrs.
Waters, that Mrs.
Waters was not of the weakest Order of Females; for no sooner did Mrs.
Waters perceive by Mr. Northerton tying a Knot in his Garter, and by Mr. Northerton Declarations, what Mr. Northerton Hellish Intentions were, than Mrs.
Waters stood stoutly to Mrs.
Waters Defense, and so strongly struggled with Mrs.
Waters Enemy, screaming all the while for Assistance, that Mrs.
Waters delayed the Execution of the Villain's Purpose several Minutes, by which Means Jones came to Mrs.
Waters Relief, at that very Instant when Mrs.
Waters Strength failed, and Mrs.
Waters was totally overpowered, and delivered Mrs.
Waters from the Ruffian's Hands, with no other Loss than that of Mrs.
Waters Clothes, which were torn from Mrs.
Waters Back, and of the Diamond Ring, which during the Contention either dropped from her Finger, or was wrenched from it by Northerton.
Thus, Reader, we have given thee the Fruits of a very painful Enquiry, which for thy Satisfaction we have made into this Matter.
And here we have opened to thee a Scene of Folly, as well as Villainy, which we could scarce have believed a human Creature capable of being guilty of; had we not remembered that that young Fellow Fellow was at that Time firmly persuaded, that that young Fellow had already committed a Murder, and had forfeited that young Fellow Life to the Law.
As that young Fellow concluded therefore that that young Fellow only Safety lay in Flight, that young Fellow thought the possessing that young Fellow of this poor Woman's Money and Ring would make that young Fellow Amends for the additional Burden that young Fellow was to lay on that young Fellow Conscience.
And here, Reader, we must strictly caution thee, that thou do not take any Occasion from the Misbehaviour of such a Wretch as this, to reflect on so worthy and honorable a Body of Men, as are the Officers of our Army in general.
Thou will be pleased to consider, that that young Fellow, as we have already informed thee, had neither the Birth nor Education of a Gentleman, nor was a proper Person to be enrolled among the Number of such.
If therefore his Baseness can justly reflect on any besides his Baseness, it must be only on those who gave his Baseness his Baseness Commission.

CHAP.
I.
Containing Instructions very necessary to be perused by modern Critics.
READER, it is impossible we should know what Sort of Person thou will be: For, perhaps, thou may be as learned in Human Nature as Shakespeare himself was, and, perhaps, thou may be no wiser than some of Shakespeare himself Editors.
Now, lest this latter should be the Case, we think proper, before we go any farther together, to give thee a few wholesome Admonitions; that thou may not as grossly misunderstand and misrepresent we, as some of the said Editors have misunderstood and misrepresented Editors Author.
First, then, we warn the not too hastily to condemn any of the Incidents in this we History, as impertinent and foreign to we main Design, because thou do not immediately conceive in what Manner such Incident may conduce to our main Design.
This Work may, indeed, be considered as a great Creation of we own; and for a little Reptile of a Critic to presume to find Fault with any of Fault Parts, without knowing the Manner in which the Whole is connected, and before he comes to the final Catastrophe, is a most presumptuous Absurdity.
The Allusion and Metaphor we have here made use of, we must acknowledge to be infinitely too great for we , but there is, indeed, no other, which is at all adequate to express the Difference between an Author of the first Rate and a Critic of the lowest.
Another Caution we must give thee, my good Reptile, is, that thou do not find out too near a Resemblance between certain Characters here introduced; as for instance, between the Landlady who appears in the Seventh Book, and her in the Ninth.
Thou art to know, Friend, that there are these Characteristics.
To be able to preserve these Characteristics, and at the same Time to diversity these Characteristics Operations, is one Talent of a good Writer.
Again, to mark the nice Distinction between two Persons actuated by the same Vice or Folly is another; and as this last Talent is found in very few Writers, so is the true Discernment of it found in as few Readers; though, I believe the Observation of this forms a very principal Pleasure in those who are capable of the Discovery: Every Person, for Instance, can distinguish between Sir Epicure Mammon, and Sir Fopling Flutter; but to know the Difference between Sir Fopling Flutter and Sir Courtly Nice, requires a more exquisite Judgment: For want of which, vulgar Spectators of Plays very often do great Injustice in the Theater; where I have sometimes known a Poet in Danger of being convicted as a Thief, upon much worse Evidence than the Resemblance of Hands has been held to be in the Law.
In reality, I apprehend every amorous Widow on the Stage would run the Hazard of being condemned as a servile Imitation of Dido, but that happily very few of our Playhouse Critics understand enough of Latin to read Virgil.
In the next place, our must admonish thee, my worthy Friend, (for perhaps, thee Heart may be better than his Head) not to condemn a Character as a bad one, because it is not perfectly a good one.
If thou do delight in these models of Perfection, there are Books enough written to gratify thy Taste; but as we have not, in the Course of we Conversation, ever happened to meet with any such Person, we have not chosen to introduce any such here.
To say the Truth, I a little question whether mere Man ever arrived at this consummate Degree of Excellence, as well as whether there has ever existed a Monster bad enough to verify that  -- nulla virtute redemptum A vitiis -- Whose Vices are not allayed with a single Virtue.
in Juvenal: Nor do I, indeed, conceive the good Purposes served by inserting Characters of such angelic Perfection, or such diabolical Depravity, in any Work of Invention: Since from contemplating either, the Mind of Man is more likely to be overwhelmed with Sorrow and Shame, than to draw any good Uses from such Patterns; for in the former Instance the Mind of Man may be both concerned and ashamed to see a Pattern of Excellence, in the Mind of Man Nature, which the Mind of Man may reasonably despair of ever arriving at; and in contemplating the latter, the Mind of Man may be no less affected with those uneasy Sensations, at seeing the Nature, of which the Mind of Man is a Partaker, degraded into so odious and detestable a Creature.
In Fact, if there be enough of Goodness in a Character to engage the Admiration and Affection of a well-disposed Mind, though there should appear some of those little Blemishes, quas humana parum cavit natura, quas humana parum cavit will raise our Compassion rather than our Abhorrence.
Indeed, nothing can be of more moral Use than the Imperfections which are seen in Examples of this Kind; since such form a Kind of Surprise, more apt to affect and dwell upon our Minds, than the Faults of very vicious and wicked Persons.
The Foibles and Vices of Men, in whom there is great Mixture of Good, become more glaring Objects, from the Virtues which contrast The Foibles and Vices of Men, in whom there is great Mixture of Good, and which show The Foibles and Vices of Men, in whom there is great Mixture of Good Deformity; and when we find such Vices attended with such Vices evil Consequence to our favorite Characters, our are not only taught to shun such Vices for our own Sake, but to hate such Vices for the Mischiefs such Vices have already brought on those our love.
And now, my Friend, having given you these few Admonitions, our will, if you please, once more set forward with our History.
CHAP.
II.
Containing the Arrival of an Irish Gentleman, with very extraordinary Adventures which ensued at the Inn.
NOW the little trembling Hare, whom the Dread of all her numerous Enemies, and chiefly of that cunning, cruel, carnivorous Animal Man, had confined all the Day to her Lurking-place, sports wantonly over the Lawns: Now on some hollow Tree the Owl, shrill Chorister of the Night, hoots forth Notes which might Charm the Ears of some modern Conoisseurs in Music: Now in the Imagination of the half-drunk Clown, as he staggars through the Churchyard, or rather Charnal-yard, to he Home, Fear paints the bloody Hobgoblin: Now Thieves and Ruffians are awake, and honest Watchmen fast asleep: In plain English, it was now Midnight; and the Company at the Inn, as well those who have been already mentioned in this History, as some others who arrived in the Evening, were all in Bed.
Susan Chambermaid, was now only stirring, Susan Chambermaid being obliged to wash the Kitchen, before Susan Chambermaid retired to the Arms of the fond, expecting Ostler.
In this Posture were Affairs at the Inn, when a an Irish Gentleman arrived there Post.
a Gentleman immediately alighted from a Gentleman Horse, and coming up to Susan, enquired of Susan in a very abrupt and confused Manner, being almost out of Breath with Eagerness, whether there was any Lady in the House.
The Hour of Night, and the Behavior of the Man, who stared very wildly all the Time, a little surprised Susan, so that Susan hesitated before Susan made any Answer: Upon which a Gentleman, with redoubled Eagerness, begged Susan to give a Gentleman a true Information, saying, a Gentleman had lost a Gentleman 'Wife, and was come in Pursuit of Susan.
'Upon my Shoul,' cries a Gentleman, 'I have been near catching Susan already in two or three Places, if I had not found Susan gone just as I came up with Susan.'
'If Susan be in the House, do carry me up in the Dark and show Susan to me; and if Susan be gone away before me, do tell me which Way I shall go after Susan to meet Susan, and upon my Shoul, I will make you the richest poor Woman in the Nation.'
a Gentleman then pulled out a Handful of Guineas, a Sight which would have bribed Persons of much greater Consequence than this poor Wench, to much worse Purposes.
Susan, from the Account Susan had received of Mrs.
Waters, made not the least Doubt but that Susan was the very identical Stray whom the right owner pursued.
As Susan concluded, therefore, with great Appearance of Reason, that Susan never could get Money in an honester Way than by restoring a Wife to Susan , Susan made no Scruple of assuring an Irish Gentleman, that the Lady he wanted was then in the House, and was presently afterward prevailed upon (by very liberal Promises, and some Earnest paid into Susan Hands) to conduct he to the Bedchamber of Mrs.
Waters.
It has been a Custom long established in the polite World, and that upon very solid and substantial Reasons, that a Husband shall never enter a Husband Wife's Apartment without first knocking at the Door.
The many excellent Uses of a Custom long established in the polite World need scarce be hinted to a Reader who has any Knowledge of the World: For by this Means the Lady he wanted has Time to adjust the Lady he wanted, or to remove any disagreeable Object out of the Way; for there are some Situations, in which nice and delicate Women would not be discovered by nice and delicate Women Husbands.
To say the Truth, there are several Ceremonies instituted among the polished Part of Mankind, which though they may, to coarser Judgments, appear as Matters of mere Form, are found to have much of Substance in they, by the more discerning; and lucky would it have been, had a Custom long established in the polite World abovementioned been observed by a Gentleman in the present Instance.
Knock, indeed, a Gentleman did at the Door, but not with one of those gentle Raps which is usual on such Occasions.
On the contrary, when a Gentleman found the Door locked, a Gentleman flew at the Door with such Violence, that the Lock immediately gave Way, the Door burst open, and a Gentleman fell headlong into the Room.
a Gentleman had no sooner recovered a Gentleman Legs, than forth from the Bed, upon his Legs likewise appeared -- with Shame and Sorrow are we obliged to proceed -- we Hero himself, who, with a menacing Voice, demanded of a Gentlemana Gentleman , and what a Gentleman meant by daring to burst open a Gentleman Chamber in that outrageous Manner.
a Gentleman a Gentleman at first thought a Gentleman had committed a ^istake, and was going to ask Pardon and retreat, when, on a sudden, as the Moon shone very bright, ^e cast a Gentleman Eyes on Stays, Gowns, Petticoats, Caps, Ribbons, Stockings, Garters, Shoes, Clogs, etc.
^ll which lay in a disordered Manner on the Floor.
All these operating on the natural Jealousy of a Gentleman Temper, so enraged a Gentleman, that a Gentleman lost all Power of Speech; and without returning any Answer to Jones, ^e endeavored to approach the Bed.
Jones immediately interposing, a fierce Contention ^rose, which soon proceeded to Blows on both Sides.
And now Mrs.
Waters (for we must confess Jones was ^n the same Bed) being, I suppose, awakened from ^er Sleep, and seeing two Men fighting in Jones , began to scream in the most violent Manner, crying out Murder!
Robbery!
and more frequently Rape!
which last, some, perhaps, may wonder Jones should mention, who do not consider that these Words of Exclamation are used by Ladies in a Fright, as Fa, la, la, ra, da, etc.
are in Music, only as the Vehicles of Sound, and without any fixed Ideas.
Next to his Chamber was deposited the Body of an Irish Gentleman, who arrived too late at the Inn to have been mentioned before.
a Gentleman a Gentleman was one of those whom the Irish call a Calabalaro, or Cavalier.
a Gentleman was a younger Brother of a good Family, and having no Fortune at Home, was obliged to look abroad in order to get one: For which Purpose a Gentleman was proceeding to the Bath to try a Gentleman Luck with Cards and the Women.
This young Fellow lay in Bed reading one of Mrs. Behn's Novels; for This young Fellow had been instructed by a Friend, that This young Fellow would find no more effectual Method of recommending This young Fellow to the Ladies than the improving This young Fellow Understanding, and filling This young Fellow Mind with good Literature.
This young Fellow no sooner, therefore, heard the violent Uproar in the next Room, than This young Fellow leapt from hi^ Bolster, and taking This young Fellow Sword in one Hand, and the Candle which burnt by This young Fellow in the other, This young Fellow went directly to Mrs.
Waters's Chamber.
If the Sight of another Man in This young Fellow Shirt at first added some Shock to the Decency of the Lady he wanted, the Sight of another Man in his Shirt at first added some Shock to the Decency of the Lady mad the Lady he wanted presently Amends by considerably abating This young Fellow Fears; for no sooner had the Calabalaro entered the Room, than This young Fellow cried out: 'Mr.
Fitzpatrick, wha^ the Devil is the Meaning of this?'
Upon which the other immediately answered, 'O, Mr. Macklachlan I am rejoiced you are here, -- This Villain has debauched his 'Wife, and is got into Bed with his 'Wife.
-- 'his 'Wifehis 'Wife?
cries Macklachlan, do not know his 'Wife very well, and don't I se^ that the Lady, whom the Gentleman who stand here in his Shirt his Shirt is lying in Bed with, is none o^ his 'Wife?'
his 'Wife now perceiving, as well by the Glimps^ his 'Wife had of the Lady he wanted, as by the Lady he wanted Voice, which might have been distinguished at a greater Distance than his 'Wife now stood from the Lady he wanted, that his 'Wife had made a very unfortunate Mistake, began to ask many Pardons of the Lady he wanted; and then turning to Jones Jones said, 'I would have you take Notice I do not ask your Pardon, for you have bate me; for which I am resolved to have your Blood in the Morning.'
Jones treated this Menace with much Contempt; and Mr. Macklachlan answered, 'Indeed, his 'Wife, you may be ashamed of your ownself, to disturb People at this Time of Night: If all the People in the Inn were not asleep, you would have awakened all the People in the Inn as you have me.
a Gentleman a Gentleman has served you very rightly.
Upon my Conscience, though I have no Wife, if you had treated no Wife so, I would have cut your Throat.'
Jones was so confounded with Jones Fears for Jones 's Reputation, that Jones knew neither what to say or do; but the Invention of Women is, as has been observed, much readier than that of Men.
no Wife recollected that there was a communication between no Wife ^hamber and that of Jones; relying, therefore, ^n Jones Honor and no Wife own Assurance, no Wife answered, I know not what you mean, Villains!
I am Wife to none of Wife.
Help!
Rape!
Murder!
Rape!'
-- And now the Landlady coming into the Room, Mrs.
Waters fell upon Mrs.
Waters with the utmost Virulence, ^^ying, 'Mrs.
Waters thought Mrs.
Waters in a sober Inn, and not in a Bawdy House; but that a Set of Villains had broke into Mrs.
Waters Room, with an Intent upon Mrs.
Waters Honor, if not upon Mrs.
Waters Life; and both, Mrs.
Waters said, were equally dear to Mrs.
Waters'.
the Landlady the Landlady now began to roar as loudly as the ^oor Woman in Bed had done before.
the Landlady cried, the Landlady was undone, and that the Reputation of the Landlady House, which was never blown upon before, was utterly destroyed.'
Then turning to the Men, the Landlady ^ry'd, 'What, in the Devil's Name, is the Reason of all this Disturbance in the Lady he wanted's Room?'
his 'Wife, hanging down his 'Wife Head, repeated, 'that his 'Wife had committed a Mistake, for which his 'Wife heartily asked Pardon,' and then retired with his 'Wife Countryman.
Jones, who was too ingenious to have missed ^he Hint given his 'Wife by his 'Wife Fair One, boldly asserted, That his 'Wife had run to the Landlady Assistance upon hearing the Door broke open; with what Design his 'Wife could not conceive, unless of robbing the Lady he wanted; which if they intended, his 'Wife said, his 'Wife had had the good Fortune to prevent.
"I never had a Robbery committed in my House since I have kept a Robbery committed in my House,' cries the Landlady: I would have you to know, Sir, I harbor no Highwaymen here; I scorn the Word, thof I say the Word.
None but honest, good Gentlefolks, are welcome to my House; and I thank good Luck, I have always had enough of such Customers; indeed as many as I could entertain.
Here has been my Lord -- ' and then my House repeated over a Catalogue of Name and Titles, many of which we might, perhaps, b^ guilty of a Breach of Privilege by inserting.
Jones, after much Patience, at length interrupted my House, by making an Apology to Mrs.
Waters, for having appeared before my House in his Shirt, assuring my House 'That nothing but a Concern for my House Safety could have prevailed on Jones to do it.'
Jones inform Jones of my House Answer, and, indeed, of h^ whole Behavior to the End of the Scene, by considering the Situation which my House affected, being that of modest Lady, who was awakened out of my House Slee^ by three strange Men in my House .
This was the Part which my House undertook to perform; and, indeed my House executed This so well, that none of our Theatric^ Actresses could exceed my House, in any of our Theatric^ Actresses Performances, either on or off the Stage.
And hence, I think, we may very fairly draw a^ Argument, to prove how extremely natural Virtue i^ to the Fair Sex: For though there is not, perhaps, on^ in ten thousand who is capable of making a good Actress; and even among these we rarely see two wh^ are equally able to personate the same Character; y^^ this of Virtue they can all admirably well put on; an^ as well those Individuals who have it not, as thos^ who possess it, can all act it to the utmost Degree o^ Perfection.
When the Men were all departed, Mrs. Water recovering from Mrs. Water Fear, recovered likewise from Mrs. Water Anger, and spoke in much gentler Accents to the Landlady, who did not so readily quit Mrs. Water Concern for the Reputation of my House, in Favor of which Mrs. Water began again to number the many great Person^ who had slept under Mrs. Water Roof; but the Lady he wanted stopped he^ short, and having absolutely acquitted Mrs. Water of having had any Share in the past Disturbance, begged to b^ left to Mrs. Water Repose, which, Mrs. Water said, Mrs. Water hoped to enjoy unmolested during the Remainder of the Night Upon which the Landlady, after much Civility, and ^any Curt'sies, took Mrs. Water Leave.
CHAP.

^ Dialogue between the Landlady, and Susan the Chambermaid, proper to be read by all Innkeepers, and all Innkeepers Servants; with the Arrival, and affable Behavior of a beautiful young Lady; which may teach Persons of Condition how Persons of Condition may acquire the Love of the whole World.
the Landlady remembering that Susan had been the only Person out of Bed when the Door was ^urst open, resorted presently to the Landlady, to enquire into ^he first Occasion of the Disturbance, as well as who ^he strange a Gentleman was, and when and how a Gentleman ^^ived.
Susan related the whole Story which the Reader ^nows already, varying the Truth only in some Circumstances, as Susan saw convenient, and totally concealing the Money which Susan had received.
But whereas Susan Mistress had in the Preface to her Mistress Enquiry spoken much in Compassion for the Fright which the Lady he wanted the Lady he wanted had been in concerning any intended Depredations on Susan Virtue, Susan could not help endeavoring to quiet the Concern which her Mistress seemed to be under on that Account, by swear^ng heartily her Mistress saw Jones leap out from her Mistress Bed.
the Landlady the Landlady fell into a violent Rage at these Words.
'A likely Story truly,' cried her Mistress, 'that a Woman should cry out, and endeavor to expose her Mistress, if that was the Case!
I desire to know what better Proof any Lady can give of any Lady than any Lady crying out, which, I believe, twenty People can witness for any Lady any Lady did?
I beg, any Lady, you would spread no such Scandal of any of my Guests: For it will not only reflect on my Guests, but upon my House, and I am sure no Vagabonds, nor wicked beggarly People come here.'
'Well,' says Susan, 'then I must not believe my own Eyes.'
'No, indeed must you not always,' answered any Lady her Mistress, 'I would not have believed my own Eyes Eyes against such good Gentlefolks.
I have not had a better Supper ordered this half Year than they ordered last Night, and so easy and good humoured were they, that they found no Fault with my Worcestershire Perry, which I sold they for Champagne; and to be sure it is as well tasted, and as wholesome as the best Champagne in the Kingdom, otherwise I would scorn to give it 'em, and they drank me two Bottles.
No, no, I will never believe any Harm of such sober good Sort of People.'
Susan being thus silenced, her Mistress her Mistress proceeded to other Matters.
'And so you tell me,' continued Susan 'That the strange Gentleman came Post, and there is a Footman without with the Horses; why then, a Footman is certainly some of your great Gentlefolks too.
Why did not you ask a Footman whether a Footman would have any a better Supper?
I think a Footman is in the other Gentleman's Room, go up and ask whether a Footman called.
Perhaps a Footman will order something when a Footman find any Body stirring in my House to dress any Body.
Now don't commit any of your usual Blunders, by telling a Footman the Fire's out, and the Fowls alive.
And if a Footman should order Mutton, don't blab out, that we have none.
The Butcher, I know, killed a Sheep just before I went to Bed, and a Sheep never refuses to cut a Sheep up warm when I desire a Sheep.
Go, remember there is all Sort of Mutton and Fowls; go, open the Door, with Gentlemen do you call, and if all Sort of Mutton and Fowls say nothing, ask what a Sheep Honor will be pleased to have for a better Supper.
Don't forget Honor Honor; if you don't mind all these Matters better you will never come to any Thing.'
Susan departed, and soon returned with an Account that the two Gentlemen were got both into the sam^ Bed, 'Two Gentlemen,' says the Landlady, 'i^ the same Bed!
that is impossible, they are two errant Scrubs, I warrant they, and, I believe, young Squire Allworthy guessed right, that the Fellow intended to rob young Squire Allworthy Ladyship: For if young Squire Allworthy had broke open the Lady he wanted's Door with any of the wicked Designs of a Gentleman, young Squire Allworthy would never have sneaked away to another Room to save the Expense of a Supper and a Bed to young Squire Allworthy.
They are certainly Thieves, and They searching after a Wife is nothing but a Pretense.'
In these Censures, the Landlady the Landlady did Mr. Fitzpa^ick great Injustice; for Mr. Fitzpa^ick was really born a Gentleman, though not worth a Groat; and though, perhaps, ^e had some few Blemishes in ^e Heart as well as ^n ^e Head, yet being a sneaking, or a niggardly Fellow, was not one of them.
In reality, ^e was so generous a Man, that whereas ^e had received a very ^andsome Fortune with ^e Wife, ^e had now spent every Penny of it, except some little Pittance which was settled upon his Wife; and in order to possess ^e ^f this, ^e had used his Wife with such Cruelty, that together with ^e Jealousy, which was of the bitterest ^ind, it had forced the poor Woman to run away from ^e.
the strange Gentleman then being well tired with the strange Gentleman long ^ourney from Chester in one Day, with which, and ^ome good dry Blows, the strange Gentleman had received in the Scuffle, ^is Bones were so sore, that added to the Soreness of ^^s Mind, Bones had quite deprived the strange Gentleman of any Appetite for eating.
And now being so violently disappointed ^n the Woman, whom at the Maid's Instance, the strange Gentleman had mistaken for his Wife, it never once entered into ^is, that his Wife might nevertheless be in my House, though the strange Gentleman had erred in the first Person the strange Gentleman had attacked.
the strange Gentleman therefore yielded to the Dissuasions of the strange Gentleman Friend from searching any farther after his Wife that Night, and accepted the Kind offer of Part of the strange Gentleman Bed.
The Footman and Post-boy were in a differ^^^ Disposition.
The Footman and Post-boy were more ready to order th^^ the Landlady was to provide; however, after bei^^ pretty well satisfied by The Footman and Post-boy of the real Truth of ^^ Case, and that Mr. Fitzpatrick was no Thief, ^ was at length prevailed on to set some cold M^ before The Footman and Post-boy, which The Footman and Post-boy were devouring with gr^ Greediness, when Partridge came into the Kitch^ Partridge had been first awakened by the Hurry which ^ have before seen, and while Partridge was endeavoring compose Partridge again on Partridge Pillow, a Screech-O^ had given Partridge such a Serenade at Partridge Window, that leapt in a most horrible Affright from Affright , ^ huddling on Affright Clothes with great Expedition, ^ down to the Protection of the Company, whom heard talking below in the Kitchen.
Affright Arrival detained the Landlady from returni^^ to the Landlady Rest: For the Landlady was just about to leave the there two Guests to the Care of Susan; but the Fri^ of young Squire Allworthy was not to be so neglect especially as Squire Allworthy called for a Pint of Wine to be ^^ led.
the Landlady immediately obeyed, by putting the sa^ Quantity of Perry to the Fire: For this readily swered to the Name of every Kind of Wine.
The Irish Footman was retired to Bed, and Post-Boy was going to follow; but Partridge vited The Irish Footman to stay, and partake of The Irish Footman Wine, which Lad very thankfully accepted.
The Schoolma^ was indeed afraid to return to Bed by The Schoolma^; an^ The Schoolma^ did not know how soon The Schoolma^ might lose the Company of the Landlady, The Schoolma^ was resolved to secure of the Boy, in whose Presence The Schoolma^ apprehended Danger from the Devil, or any of The Schoolma^ Adherents.
And now arrived another Post-Boy at the G^ upon which Susan being ordered out, returned; troducing two young Women in Riding-habits, of which was so very richly laced, that Post-Boy instantly started from their Chairs, and the Landlady fell to the Landlady Curt'sies, and the Landlady Ladyships, with great Eagerness.
The Lady in the rich Habit said, with a Smile of great Condescension, 'If you will give me Leave, any Lady, I will warm The Lady in the rich Habit a few Minutes at your Kitchen Fire, for it is really very cold; but I must insist on disturbing no one from their Seats.'
This was spoken on Account of Partridge, who had retreated to the other End of the Room, struck with the utmost Awe and Astonishment at the Splendour of the Lady he wanted's dress.
Indeed the Lady he wanted had a much better Title to Respect than this: For the Lady he wanted was one of the most beautiful Creatures in the World.
the Lady he wanted earnestly desired Partridge to return to Partridge Seat, but could not prevail.
the Lady he wanted then pulled off the Lady he wanted Gloves, and displayed two Hands, which had every Property of Wax in Wax, except that of melting, to the Fire.
the Lady he wanted Companion, who was indeed the Lady he wanted Maid, likewise pulled off her Gloves, and discovered what bore an exact Resemblance, in Cold and Color, ^o a Piece of frozen Beef.
'I wish, the Lady he wanted,' quoth the latter, 'your Ladyship would not think of going any farther to Night.
I am terribly afraid your Ladyship your Ladyship will not be able to bear the Fatigue.
'Why sure,' cries the Landlady,' Honor the Landlady can never intend it.
O bless me, farther, to Night indeed!
Let me beseech your Ladyship your Ladyship not to think on it -- But to be sure, your Ladyship cannot.
What will Honor Honor be pleased to have for a better Supper?
I have Mutton of all Kinds, and some nice Chicken.'
--  'I think, Madam,' said the Lady he wanted, 'it would be rather Breakfast than a better Supper; but I cannot eat any Thing, and if I stay, shall only lie down for an Hour or two.
However, if you please, Madam, you may get me a little Sack-Whey made very small and thin.'
'Yes, Madam,' cries the Mistress of my House, I have some excellent White Wind.
'You have a little Sack-Whey then,' says the Lady he wanted.
'Yes, an't please Honor, I have; I may challange the Country for that -- But let me beg your Ladyship to eat something.'
'Upon my Word, I cannot eat a Morsel,' answerred the Lady he wanted; 'and I shall be much obliged to you, if you will please to get my Apartment ready as soon as possible: For I am resolved to be o^ Horseback again in three Hours.'
'Why Susan,' cries the Landlady, 'is there a Fir^ lit yet in the Wild-goose?
-- I am sorry, Madam, al^ my Best Rooms are full.
Several People of the first Quality are now in Bed.
Here Is a great youn^ Squire, and a many other great Gentlefolks of Quality.'
Susan answered, 'That the Irish Gentlemen were got into the Wild-goose.'
'Was ever any Thing like it,' says the Mistress of the House 'why the Devil the Devil would you not keep some of the be^ Rooms for the Quality, when you know scarce, Day passes without some calling here?
-- If some calling here b^ Gentlemen, I am certain, when some calling here know it is for the Mistress of the House , some calling here will get up again.'
'Not upon my Account,' says the Lady he wanted.
'I wi^^ have no Person disturbed for the Lady he wanted.
If you have Room that is commonly decent, it will serve n^^ very well, though it be never so plain.
I beg, Madam, you will not give yourself so much Troub^ on my Account.
OF Madam,' cries the other I have several very good Rooms for that Matte^ but none good enough for Honor's Ladyship However, as you are so condescending to take u^ with the best I have, do, Susan, get a Fire in the Rose this Minute.
Will your Ladyship be please to go up now, or stay till the Fire is lighted?
I think, I have, sufficiently warmed the Lady he wanted,' answered the Lady he wanted, 'so if you please I will go now; I am afraid I have kept People, and particularly that Gentleman (meaning Partridge) too long in the Cold already.
Indeed I cannot bear to think of keeping any Person from the Fire this dreadful Weather.'
the Lady he wanted then departed with the Lady he wanted Maid, the Landlady marching with two lighted Candles before the Lady he wanted.
When the Lady he wanted returned, the Conversation in the Kitchen was all upon the Charms of the Lady he wanted.
There is indeed in perfect Beauty a Power which none almost can withstand: For the Landladythe Landlady, though the Landlady was not pleased at the Negative given to the Supper, declared the Landlady had never seen so lovely a Creature.
Partridge ran out into the most extravagant Encomiums on the Landlady Face, though Partridge could not refrain from paying some Compliments to the Gold Lace on the Landlady Habit: Post-Boy sung forth the Praises of the Landlady Goodness, which were likewise echoed by the other Post-boy, who was now come in.
'the Landlady's a true good Lady, I warrant the Landlady,' says Post-Boy: For the Landlady has Mercy upon dumb Creatures; for the Landlady asked me every now and tan upon the Journey, if I did not think the Landlady should hurt the Horses by riding too fast; and when the Landlady came in, the Landlady charged me to give the Horses as much Corn as ever the Horses would eat.'
Such Charms are there in Affability, and so sure is it to attract the Praises of all Kinds of People.
it may indeed be compared to the celebrated Mrs. Hussy A celebrated Mantua-maker in the Strand, famous for setting off the Shapes of Women.
.
It is equally sure to set off every Female Perfection to the highest Advantage, and to palliate and conceal every Defect.
A short Reflection which we could not forbear making in this Place, where my Reader has seen the Loveliness of an affable Deportment; and Truth will now oblige us to contrast it, by showing the Reverse.

Containing infallible Nostrums for procuring universal Disesteem and Hatred.
the Lady he wanted the Lady he wanted had no sooner laid the Lady he wanted on the Lady he wanted Pillow, than the Waiting Woman returned to the Kitchen to regale with some of those Dainties which the Mistress of the House the Mistress of the House had refused.
The Company at the Lady he wanted Entrance, showed the Lady he wanted the same Respect which they had before paid to the Mistress of the House, by rising; but the Lady he wanted forgot to imitate the Lady he wanted, by desiring they to sit down again.
Indeed it was scarce possible they should have done so: For the Lady he wanted placed the Lady he wanted Chain in such a Posture, as almost to occupy the whole Fire.
the Lady he wanted then ordered a Chicken to be broiled that Instant, declaring if a Chicken was not ready in a Quarter of an Hour, the Lady he wanted would not stay for it was not ready in a Quarter of an Hour.
Now though the said a Chicken was then at Roost in the stable, and required the several Ceremonies of catching, killing, and picking, before it was brought to the Grid-iron, the Landlady the Landlady would nevertheless have undertaken to do all within the Time; but the Guest being unfortunately admitted behind the Scenes, must have been Witness to the Fourberie, the Lady he wanted was therefore obliged to confess that the Lady he wanted had none in my House; but, Madam, said the Lady he wanted, 'I can get any kind of Mutton in an Instant from the Butcher's.'
'Do you think then,' answered the Waiting Gentlewoman, 'that I have the Stomach of a Horse to eat Mutton at this Time of Night?
Sure you People that keep Inns imagine your Betters are like yourselves.
Indeed I expected to get nothing at this wretched place.
I wonder the Lady he wanted the Lady he wanted would stop at this wretched place.
I suppose none but Tradesmen and Grasiers ever call here.'
the Landlady fired at ^is Indignity offered to the Landlady House; however the Landlady supressed the Landlady Temper, and contented the Landlady with saying, 'Very good Quality frequented it, the Landlady thanked Heaven!'
Don't tell me,' cries the other, 'of Quality!
I believe I know more of People of Quality than such as you.
-- But, prithee, without troubling me with any of your Impertinence, do tell me what I can have for a better Supper; for though I connot eat Horseflesh, I am really hungry.'
'Why truly, Madam,' answered the Landlady, 'you could not have taken me again at such a Disadvantage: For I must confess, I have nothing in my House, unless a cold Piece of Beef, which indeed a Gentlewoman's Footman, and the Post-boy, have almost cleared to the Bone.'
Woman, said Mrs. Abigail (so for Shortness we will call her) I entreat you not to make me sick.
If I had fasted a Month, I could not eat what had been touched by the Fingers of such Fellows: Is there nothing neat or decent to be had in this horrid Place?'
'What think you of your Eggs,' said the Landlady.
'Are your Eggs new laid?
Are you certain your Eggs were laid Today?
And let me have the Bacon cut very nice and thin; for I cannot endure any Thing that is gross.
-- Prithee, try if you can do a little tolerably for once, and don't think you have a Farmer's Wife, or some of those Creatures in my House.'
-- the Landlady the Landlady begun then to handle the Landlady Knife; but the other stopped the Landlady, saying, 'Good Woman, I must insist upon your first washing your Hands; for I am extremely nice, and have been always used from my Cradle to have every thing in the most elegant Manner.'
The Landlady, who governed herself with much Difficulty, began now the necessary Preprerations; for as to Susan, the Landlady was utterly rejected, and with such Disdain, that the poor Wench was as hard put to the poor Wench, to restrain the Landlady Hands from Violence, as the Mistress of the House had been to hold the Landlady Tongue.
This indeed Susan did not entirely: For though Susan literally kept it within Susan Teeth, yet there it muttered many 'marry-come-ups, as good Flesh and Blood as yourself, with other such indignant Phrases.'
While the Supper was preparing, Mrs Abigail began to lament Mrs Abigail had not ordered a Fire in the Parlour; but Mrs Abigail said, that was now too late.
'However, said Mrs Abigail, 'I have Novelty to recommend a Kitchen, for I do not believe I ever eat in one before.'
Then turning to the Post-Boys, Mrs Abigail asked the Post-Boys, 'Why the Post-Boys were not in the Stable with the Post-Boys Horses?
If I must eat my hard Fare here, Madam,' cries Mrs Abigail to the Landlady, 'I beg a Kitchen may be kept clear, that I may not be surrounded with all the Black-guards in Town; as for you, Sir,' says Mrs Abigail to Partridge, 'you look somewhat like a Gentleman, and may sit still if you please, I don't desire to disturb any body but Mob.'
'Yes, yes, Madam, cries Partridge, 'I am a a Gentleman, I do assure you, and I am not so easily to be disturbed.
Non semper vox causalis est verbo nominativus.'
This Latin Mrs Abigail took to be some Affront, and answered, 'You may be a Gentleman, Sir, but you don't show yourself as one, to talk Latin to a Wonan.'
Partridge made a genteel Reply, and concluded with more Latin; upon which Partridge tossed up Partridge Nose, and contented Partridge by abusing Partridge with the Name of a great Scholar.
the Supper being now on the Table, Mrs Abigail eat very heartily, for so delicate a Person; and while a second Course of the same was by Mrs Abigail Order preparing, Mrs Abigail said, 'And so, Madam, you tell me my House is frequented by People of great Quality.'
the Landlady answered in the Affirmative, saying, 'There were a great many very good Quality and Gentlefolks in it now.
There Is young Squire Allworthy, as that Gentleman there knows.'
'And pray who is this young Gentleman of Quality, this young young Squire Allworthy?'
said Mrs Abigail.
'Who should young Squire Allworthy be,' answered Partridge, 'but the Son and Heir of the great Squire Allworthy of Somersetshire.'
'Upon my Word,' said Mrs Abigail, 'you tell me strange News: For I know young Squire Allworthy very well, and I know young Squire Allworthy has no Son alive.'
the Landlady the Landlady pricked up the Landlady Ears at this, and Partridge looked a little confounded.
However, after a short Hesitatation, Partridge answered, 'Indeed, Madam, it is true, every body does not know Partridge to be Squire Allworthy's Son; for Partridge was never married to Partridge Mother; but Partridge Son Partridge certainly is, and will be Partridge Heir too as certainly as Heir Name is Jones.'
At that Word, Mrs Abigail let drop the Bacon, which Mrs Abigail was conveying to Mrs Abigail Mouth, and cried out, 'You surprise me, Sir.
Is it possible Jones should be now in my House?'
'Quare non?'
answered Partridge, 'it is possible, and it is certain.
Mrs Abigail now made Haste to finish the Remainder of Mrs Abigail Meal, and then repaired back to Mrs Abigail Mistress, when the Conversation passed, which may be read in the next Chapter.
CHAP.
V. Showing who the amiable Lady, and Lady unamiable Maid, were.
AS in the Month of June, the Damask Rose, which Chance has planted among the Lillies with the Damask Rose, which Chance has planted among the Lillies candid Hue mixes their candid Hue Vermilion: Or, as some play-some Heifer in the pleasant Month of May diffuses Mrs Abigail oderiferous Breath over the flowery Meadows: Or as, in the blooming Month of April, the gentle, constant Dove, perched on some fair Bough, sits meditating Mrs Abigail Mate; so looking a hundred Charms, and breathing as many Sweets, Mrs Abigail Thoughts being fixed on Mrs Abigail Tommy, with a Heart as good and innocent, as Mrs Abigail Face was beautiful: Sophia (for it was Sophia herself) lay reclining Sophia lovely Head on Sophia Hand, when Sophia Maid entered the Room, and running directly to the Bed, cried, 'Madam -- Madam -- who does your Ladyship think is in my House?'
Sophia starting up, cried, 'I hope my Father has not overtaken us.'
'No, Madam, it is one worth a hundred Fathers; Jones is here at this very Instant.'
Jones!'
says Sophia, 'it is impossible, I cannot be so fortunate.'
her Maid averred the Fact, and was presently detached by Sophia to order Jones to be called; for Sophia said Sophia was resolved to see Jones immediately.
Mrs.
Honor had no sooner left a Kitchen in the Manner we have before seen, than the Landlady the Landlady fell severely upon the Landlady.
the Lady he wanted had indeed been loading the Lady he wanted Heart with foul Language for some Time, and now it scoured out of her Mouth as Filth does from a Mud-Cart, when the Board which consines the Board which consines is removed.
Partridge, likewise shovelled in his share of Calumny; and (what may surprise the Reader) not only bespattered the Maid, but attempted to fully the Lilly-white Character of Sophia herself 'Never a Barrel the better Herring,' cries his, 'Noscitur a socio, is a true Saying.
It must be confessed indeed that the Lady in the fine Garment is the civiller of the two; but I warrant neither o^ o^ are a Bit better than o^ should be.
A Coupl^ of Bath Trulls, I Will answer for o^; your Qualit^ don't ride about at this Time o'Night without Servants.'
'Sbodlikins, and that is true,' cries the Landlady, 'you have certainly hit upon the very Matter; for Quality don't come into a House without bespeaking a Supper, whether they eat or no.'
While they were thus discoursing, Mrs.
Honor returned, and discharged Mrs.
Honor Commission, by bidding the Landlady immediately awake Jones, and tell Jones a the Lady in the fine Garment wanted to speak with Jones.
the Landlady the Landlady referred to Partridge, saying, 'the Landlady was his Friend; but, for his Friend Part, his Friend never called Men Folks, especially Gentlemen,' and then walked sullenly out of a Kitchen.
Mrs.
Honor applied his Friend to Partridge; but Mrs.
Honor refused; 'For his Friend,' cries Mrs.
Honor, 'went to Bed very late, and Mrs.
Honor would be very angry to be disturbed so soon.'
Mrs.
Honor insisted still to have Mrs.
Honor called, saying, 'Mrs.
Honor was sure, instead of being angry, that Mrs.
Honor would be to the highest Degree delighted when Mrs.
Honor knew the Occasion.'
Another Time, perhaps, Mrs.
Honor might,Partridge; 'but non omnia possumus omnes.
One Woman is enough at once for a reasonrble Man.?
What do you mean by one Woman, Fellow,' cries Mrs.
Honor?
None of your Fellow,' answered Partridge.
Partridge then proceeded to inform Partridge plainly, that Jones was in Bed with a Wench, and made use of an Expression too indelicate to be here inserted; which so enraged Mrs.
Honor, that Mrs.
Honor called Partridge saucy Jackanapes, and returned in a violent Hurry to Mrs.
Honor Mistress, whom Mrs.
Honor acquainted with the Success of Mrs.
Honor Errand, and with the Account Mrs.
Honor had received; which, if possible, Mrs.
Honor exaggerated, being as angry with Jones, as if Partridge had pronounced all the Words that came from Mouth as Filth.
Mrs.
Honor discharged a Torrent of Abuse on the Master, and advised Mrs.
Honor to quit all Thoughts of a Man who had never shown a Man who had never shown himself deserving of her deserving of Mrs.
Honor.
Mrs.
Honor then ripped up the Story of Molly Seagrim, and gave the most malicious Turn to a Man who had never shown himself deserving of her formerly quitting Sophia herself; which, I must confess, the present Incident not a littl countenanced.
The Spirits of Sophia were too much dissipated by Concern to enable Sophia to stop the Torrent of her Maid.
At last, however, Sophia interrupted Sophia, saying, 'I never can believe this; some Villain has belied Villain.
You say you had this from Villain Friend; but surely this is not the Office of a Friend to betray such Secrets.'
'I suppose,' cries Honor, 'your Fellow is your Fellow Pimp, for I never saw so ill-looked a Villain.
Besides, such profligate Rakes as Mr. Jones, are never ashamed of these Matters.'
To say the Truth, this Behavior of Partridge was a little inexcusable; but this Behavior of Partridge had not slept off the Effect of the Dose which this Behavior of Partridge swallowed the Evening before; which had in the Morning, received the Addition of about a Pint of Wine, or indeed rather of Malt Spirits; for the Perry was by no Means pure.
These Sluices.
These Sluices were indeed naturally very ill secured.
To give the best natured Turn we can to These Sluices disposition, These Sluices was a very honest Man: for as These Sluices was the most inquisitive of Mortals, and eternally prying into the Secrets of others, so These Sluices very faithfully paid others by communicating, in Return, every thing within These Sluices Knowledge.
While Sophia tormented with Anxiety, knew not what to believe, nor what Resolution to take, Susan arrived with the Sack-Whey.
Mrs.
Honor immediately advised Mrs.
Honor , in a Whisper to pump this Wench, who probably could inform Sophia of the Truth.
Sophia approved it, and began as follows: 'Come hither, Child, now answer me truly what I am going to ask you, and I promise you I will very well reward you.
Is there a young Gentleman in' this House, a handsome young Gentleman that -- Here Sophia blushed and was confounded -- 'A young Gentleman,' cries Honor, 'that came hither in Company with that fancy Rascal who is now in a Kitchen?'
Susan answered, 'There was' -- 'Do you know any Thing of any Lady,' continues Sophia, 'any a Lady?
I don't ask you whether any Lady is handsome or no; perhaps any Lady is not, that is nothing to the Purpose, but do you know of any a Lady?'
La, Madam, cries Mrs.
Honor, you will make a very bad Examiner.
Harkee, Child,' says any Lady, 'Is not that very young Gentleman now in Bed with' some nasty Trull or other?
Here Susan smiled, and was silent.
'Answer the Question, Child, says Sophia, 'and here is a Guinea for Sophia.'
'A Guinea!
Madam, cries Susan; 'La, what is a Guinea?
If the Mistress of the House should know it, I shall certainly lose my Place that very Instant.'
'Here's another for you,' says Sophia, 'and I promise you faithfully the Mistress of the House the Mistress of the House shall never know it.'
Susan, after a very short Hesitation, took the Money, and told his whole Story, concluding with saying, 'If you have a great Curiosity, Madam, I can steal softly into the Room, and see whether his be in his own Bed or no.'
Susan accordingly did this by Sophia's Desire, and returned with an Answer in the Negative.
Sophia now trembled and turned pale.
Mrs.
Honor begged Sophia to be comforted, and not to think any more of your Fellowyour Fellow.
'Why there,' says Susan, 'I hope Madam, your Ladyship will not be offended; but pray Madam, is not your Ladyship's Name Madam Sophia Western?'
'How is it possible you should know me?
answered Sophia.
'Why that Man that the Gentlewoman spoke of, who is in a Kitchen, told about you last Night.
But I hope your Ladyship your Ladyship is not angry with you.'
'Indeed, Child,' said Sophia, 'I am not; pray tell me all, and I promise you
