Kitchen, that Madam Sophia Western -- Indeed I don't know how to bring it out.'
-- Here Madam Sophia Western stopped, till having received Encouragement from Sophia, and being vehemently pressed by Mrs.
Honor, Madam Sophia Western proceeded thus: -- 'He told us, Madam Sophia Western, though to be sure it is all a Lie, that your Ladyship was dying for Love of the young Squire, and that He was going to the Wars to get rid of you.
I thought to Madam Sophia Western then He was a false-hearted Wretch; but now to see such a fine, rich, beautiful Lady as you be forsaken for such an ordinary Woman; for to be sure so such an ordinary Woman is, and another Man's Wife into the Bargain.
It is such a strange unnatural thing, in a Manner.'
Sophia gave Sophia a third Guinea, and telling Sophia Sophia would certainly be Sophia Friend, if Sophia mentioned nothing of what had passed, nor informed any one who Sophia was, dismissed the Girl with Orders to the Post-Boy to get the Horses ready immediately.
Being now left alone with Sophia Maid, Sophia told Sophia trusty Waiting Woman, 'That Sophia never was more easy than at present.
I am now convinced,' said Sophia, 'the Post-Boy is not only a Villain, but a low despicable Wretch.
I can forgive all rather than the Post-Boy exposing my Name in so barbarous a Manner.
That renders the Post-Boy the Object of my Contempt.
Yes, Honor, I am now easy.
I am indeed.
I am very easy, and then Sophia burst into a violent Flood o^ Tears.'
After a short Interval, spent chiefly by Sophia, i^ crying and assuring her Maid her Maid that Sophia was perfectly easy, Susan arrived with an Account that the Horse^ were ready, when a very extraordinary Thought suggested the Horse^ to our young Heroine, by which Mr. Jones would be acquainted with Sophia having been a^ the Inn, in a Way, which, if any Sparks of Affection for Sophia remained in Mr. Jones, would be some Punishment, at least, for Mr. Jones Faults.
The Reader will be pleased to remember a little Muff, which has had the Honor of being more than once remembered already in this History.
Thi^ Muff, ever since the Departure of Mr. Jones, ha^^ been the constant companion of Sophia by Day, and Sophia Bedfellow by Night, and Thi^ Muff Sophia had at this very Instant upon Sophia Arm; whence Sophia took it off with great Indignation, and having writ Sophia Name with Sophia Pencil upon a Piece of Paper which Sophia pinned to it, Sophia bribed the Maid to convey it into the empty Bed of Mr. Jones, in which if Mr. Jones did not find it, Sophia charged Sophia to take some Method of conveying it before Mr. Jones Eyes in the Morning.
Then having paid for what Mrs.
Honor had eaten, in which Bill was included an Account for what Sophia herself might have eaten, Sophia mounted Sophia Horse, and once more assuring Sophia Companion that Sophia was perfectly easy, continued Sophia Journey.

VI.
Containing, among other Things, the Ingenuity of Partridge, the Madness of Jones, and the Folly of Fitzpatrick.
IT was now past Five in the Morning, and other Company began to rise and come to the Kitchen, among whom were the Sergeant and the Coachman, who being thoroughly reconciled, made a Libation, or, in the English Phrase, drank a hearty Cup together.
In this Drinking nothing more remarkable happened, than the Behavior of Partridge, who, when the Sergeant drank a Health to King George, repeated only the Word King: Nor could the Sergeant be brought to utter more: For though the Sergeant was going to sight against the Sergeant own Cause, yet the Sergeant could not be prevailed upon to drink against it.
Jones being now returned to Jones own Bed (but from whence we returned Jones must beg to be excused from relating) summoned Partridge from this agreeable Company, who, after a ceremonious Preface, having obtained leave to offer Jones Advice, delivered Jones as follows:  'It is, Sir, an old Saying, and a true one, that a wise Man may sometimes learn Council from a Fool; wish therefore I might be so bold as to offer you my Advice, which is to return home again and leave these Horrida Bella, these bloody Wars to Fellows who are contented to swallow Gunpowder, because my Advice, which is to return home again and leave these Horrida Bella, these bloody Wars to Fellows who are contented to swallow Gunpowder have nothing to eat.
Now every body knows your Honor wants for nothing at home; when that is the Case, why should any Man travel abroad?'
'Partridge,' cries Jones, 'thou art certainly a Coward, I wish therefore thou would return home thyself, and trouble me no more.'
'I ask your Honor's Pardon,' cries Partridge, 'I spoke on your Account more than my own; for as to Sir, Heaven knows my Circumstances are bad enough, and I am so far from being afraid, that I value a Pistol, or a Blunderbuss, or any such Thing, no more than a Pop-gun.
Every Man must die once, and what signifies the Manner how; besides, perhaps, I may come off with the Loss only of an Arm or a Leg.
I assure you, Sir, I was never less afraid in my Life; and so if your Honor your Honor is resolved to go on, I am resolved to follow you.
But, in that Case, I wish I might give my Opinion.
To be sure it is a scandalous Way of traveling, for a great Gentleman like you to walk afoot.
Now here are two or three good Horses in the Stable, which the Landlord will certainly make no Scruple of trusting you with; but if the Landlord should, I can easily contrive to take he should, and let the worst come to the worst, your Honor would certainly pardon you, as you are going to fight in your Honor Cause.'
Now as the Honesty of Partridge was equal to Partridge Understanding, and both dealt only in small Matters, Partridge would never have attempted a Roguery of this Kind, had Partridge not imagined it altogether safe; for Partridge was one of those who have more consideration of the Gallows than of the Fitness of Things; but in Reality, Partridge thought Partridge might have committed this Felony without any Danger: For, besides that Partridge doubted not but the Name of Mr. Allworthy would sufficiently quiet the Landlord, Mr. Allworthy conceived they should be altogether safe, whatever Turn Affairs might take; as Jones, Mr. Allworthy imagined, would have Friends enough on one Side, and as Mr. Allworthy Friends would as well secure Mr. Allworthy on the other.
When Jones found that Partridge was in earnest in this Proposal, Jones very severely rebuked Jones, and that in such bitter Terms that the other attempted to laugh it off, and presently turned the Discourse to other Matters, saying, Jones believed they were then in a Bawdy House, and that Jones had with much ado prevented two Wenches from disturbing Jones Honor in the middle of the Night.
'Heyday!'
says Jones, 'I believe they got into your Chamber whether I would or no, for here lies the Muff of one of they on the Ground.'
Indeed, as Jones returned to Jones Bed in the Dark, Jones had never perceived the Muff on the Quilt, and in leaping into his Bed Jones had tumbled it on the Floor.
This Partridge now took up, and was going to put into Jones Pocket, when Jones desired to see it.
the Muff on the Quilt was so very remarkable, that our Hero might possibly have recollected the Muff on the Quilt without the Information annexed.
But Jones Memory was not put to that hard Office, for at the same Instant Jones saw and read the Words Sophia Western upon the Paper which was pinned to it.
Jones Looks now grew frantic in a Moment, and Jones eagerly cried out, 'Oh Heavens, how came Thi^ Muff here!'
'I know no more than your Honor,' cried Partridge; 'but I saw Thi^ Muff upon the Arm of one of the Women who would have disturbed you, if I would have suffered the Women who would have disturbed you.'
'Where are the Women who would have disturbed you?'
cries Jones, jumping out of his Bed, and laying hold of Jones Clothes.
'Many Miles off, I believe,' by this Time,' said Partridge.
And JonesJones, upon further Enquiry, was sufficiently assured that the Bearer of Thi^ Muff was no other than the lovely Sophia herself.
The Behavior of Jones on this Occasion.
Jones Thoughts, Jones Looks, Jones Words, Jones Actions, were such as Beggar all Description.
After many bitter Execrations on Partridge, and not fewer on himself, himself ordered the poor Fellow, who was frightened out of himself Wits, to run down and hire himself Horses at any rate; and a very few Minutes afterward, having shuffled on himself , himself hastened down Stairs to execute the Orders himself, which himself had just before given.
But before we proceed to what passed on himself Arrival in the Kitchen, it will be necessary to recur to what had there happened since Partridge had first left it on Partridge Master's Summons.
the Sergeant was just marched off with the Sergeant Party when the two Irish Gentlemen arose and came down Stairs; both complaining, that the two Irish Gentlemen had been so often waked by the Noises in the Inn, that the two Irish Gentlemen had never once been able to close the two Irish Gentlemen Eyes all Night.
The Coach, which had brought the young Lady and Lady Maid, and which, perhaps, The Reader may have hitherto concluded was Lady own, was indeed Mr. Maclachlan.
By which Means they may, perhaps, have the Pleasure of riding in the very Coach, and being driven by the very Coachman, that is recorded in this History.
the very Coachman the very Coachman having but two Passengers, and hearing Mr. Maclachlan was bound to Bath, offered to carry Mr. Maclachlan thither at a very moderate Price.
Mr. Maclachlan was induced to this by the Report of the Ostler, who said, that the Horse which Mr. Maclachlan had hired from Worcester, would be much more pleased with re^^rning to Mr. Maclachlan Friend there, than to prosecute a long ^ourney; for that the said her Horse was rather a two^^gged than a four-legged Animal.
Mr. Maclachlan immediately closed with the Proposal of the very Coachman, and, at the same Time, per^aded Mr. Maclachlan Friend Fitzpatrick to accept of the fourth ^lace in the Coach.
This Conveyance the Soreness ^f Mr. Maclachlan Bones made more agreeable to Mr. Maclachlan than a Horse, and being well assured of meeting with Mr. Maclachlan Wife at ^ath, Mr. Maclachlan thought a little Delay would be of no Con^equence.
Maclachlan, who was much the sharper Man of the ^wo, no sooner heard that this Lady came from Ches^r, with the other Circumstances which Mr. Maclachlan learned from the Ostler, than it came into Mr. Maclachlan Head that this Lady ^ight possibly be Mr. Maclachlan Friend's Wife; and presently ac^uainted Mr. Maclachlan with this Suspicion, which had never ^nce occurred to his Friend Fitzpatrick.
To say the truth, his Friend Fitzpatrick was one of those Compositions which Na^^re makes up in two great a Hurry, and forgets to at any Brains in their Head.
Now it happens to this sort of Men, as to bad ^ounds, who never hit off a Fault Men; but no ^oner does a Dog of Sagacity open his Friend Fitzpatrick Mouth, than ^ey immediately do the same, and without the Guide ^ any Scent, run directly forwards as fast as Men are ^le.
In the same Manner, the very Moment Mr. Maclachlan had mentioned Mr. Maclachlan Apprehension, his Friend Fitzpatrick instantly concurred, and flew directly up ^airs to surprise his Wife his Wife before his Friend Fitzpatrick knew where his Wife ^as; and unluckily (as Fortune loves to play Tricks ^ith those Gentlemen who put themselves entirely un^r his Wife Conduct) ran his Head against several Doors ^^d Posts to no Purpose.
Much kinder was his Wife to (...), when his Wife suggested that Simile of the Hounds, (...) before inserted, since his Wife his Wife may, on these, Occasions, be so justly compared to a hunted Hare.
Like that little wretched Animal his Wife pricks up his Wife Ears to listen after the Voice of his Wife Pursuer; like his Wife, flies away trembling when his Wife hears it; and like his Wife, is generally overtaken and destroyed in the End.
This was not however the Case at present; for after a long fruitless Search, his Friend Fitzpatrick returned to the Kitchen, where, as if this had been a rea^ Chase, entered a Gentleman hallowing as Hunter do when the Hounds are at Fault.
his Friend Fitzpatrick was just a lighting from his Friend Fitzpatrick Horse, and had many Attendants a^ his Friend Fitzpatrick Heels.
Here, The Reader, it may be necessary to acquaint The Reader with some Matters, which, if thou do know already thou art wiser than I take thee to be.
And this Information thou shall receive in the next Chapter.
CHAP.
VII.
In which are included the Adventures that happened a the Inn at Upton.
IN the first Place then, this Gentleman just arrive^ was no other Person than Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of this Gentleman just arrive^ Daughter; an^ had this Gentleman just arrive^ fortunately been two Hours earlier, this Gentleman just arrive^ had no^ only found his Daughter, but this Gentleman just arrive^ Neice into the Bargain; for such was the Wife of Mr. Fitzpatrick, who had ru^ away with his Daughter five Years before, out of the Custod^ of that sage Lady Madam Western.
Now this Lady had departed from the Inn much about at the same Time with Sophia: For having bee^ waked by the Voice of Sophia Husband, Sophia had sent u^ for the Landlady, and being by Sophia apprized of the Matter, had bribed Sophia, at an extravagant Price, to furnish Sophia with Horses for Sophia e^cape.
Such Prevalence had Money in this Family and though the Mistress would have turned away the Mistress Maid for a corrupt Hussy, if Sophia had known as much ^s the Reader, yet Sophia was no more Proof against Corruption Sophia than poor Susan had been.
Mr. Western and his Nephew were not known to one another; nor indeed would the former have taken any Notice of the latter, if his had known his; for this being a stolen Match, and consequently an unnatural one in the Opinion of the good Squire, his had, from the Time of Sophia committing it, abandoned his poor young Creature, who was then no more than Eighteen, as a Monster, and had never since suffered Sophia to be named in his Presence.
the Kitchen was now a Scene of universal Confusion, Western enquiring after his , and his Friend Fitzpatrick as eagerly after his Friend Fitzpatrick Wife, when Jones entered the Room, unfortunately having Sophia's Muff in his Friend Fitzpatrick Hand.
As soon as Western saw Jones, Jones set up the same Holla as is used by Sportsmen when Sportsmen Game is in View.
Jones then immediately run up and laid hold of Jones, crying, 'We have got the Dog Fox, I warrant the Bitch is not far off.'
The Jargon which followed for some Minutes, where many spoke different Things at the same Time, as it would be very difficult to discribe, so would it be no less unpleasant to read.
Jones having, at length, shaken Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter off, and some of the Company having interfered between them, our Hero protested our Hero Innocence as to knowing any thing of this Lady; when Parson Supple stepped up, and said, 'It is Folly to deny It; for why the Marks of Guilt are in thy Hands.
I will myself asseverate and bind It by an Oath, that the Muff thou bear in thy Hand belonged unto Madam Sophia; for I have frequently observed Madam Sophia, of later Days, to bear it about Madam Sophia.'
'My Daughter's Muff!'
cries the good Squire, in a Rage.
'Hath Hath got My Daughter's Muff!
Bear Witness, the Goo^ are found upon Bear Witness.
I Will have Bear Witness before a Justi^^ of Peace this Instant.
Where is My Daughter, Vi^lain?'
'Sir,' said Jones, 'I beg you would ^pacified.
My Daughter's Muff, I acknowledge, is the youn^ Lady's; but, upon my Honor, I have never see the youn^ Lady.'
At these Words Western lost all Patienc^ and grew inarticulate with a Rage.
Some of the Servants had acquainted Fitzpatric^ who Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter was.
The good Irishman there fore thinking The good Irishman there fore had now an Opportunity to do a Act of Service to The good Irishman there fore Uncle, and by that Means mig^^ possibly obtain The good Irishman there fore Favor, stepped up to Jones, an^ cried out, 'Upon my Conscience, Sir, you may ^^ ashamed of denying your having seen the Gentleman's Daughter before my Face, when you kno^ I found you there upon the Bed together.'
The turning to Western, The good Irishman there fore offered to conduct The good Irishman there fore immediately to the Room where the Gentleman's Daughter was; which Offer being accepted, The good Irishman there fore, the Squire, the Parson, and some others, ascended directly to Mrs.
Waters Chamber, which they entered with no less Violence than his Friend Fitzpatrick had done before.
this Lady this Lady started from this Lady Sleep with a much Amazement as Terror, and beheld at this Lady Bed side a Figure which might very well be supposed ^ have escaped out of Bedlam.
Such Wildness an^ Confusion were in the Looks of Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter; wh^ no sooner saw this Lady, than this Lady started back, showing sufficiently by this Lady Manner, before this Lady spoke, the this was not this Lady sought after.
So much more tenderly do Women value Women Reputation than Women Persons, that though the latter seemed now in more Danger than before, yet as the former was secure, this Lady this Lady screamed not with such Violence as this Lady had done on the other Occasion.
However, this Lady no sooner found this Lady alone, than this Lady abandoned all Thoughts of further Repose, and as this Lady had sufficient Reason to be dissatisfied with this Lady present Lodging, this Lady dressed this Lady with all possible Expedition.
Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter now proceeded to search the whole House, but to as little Purpose as Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter had disturbed poor Mrs.
Waters.
Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter then returned disconsolate into the Kitchen, where Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter found Jones in the Custody of Jones Servants.
This violent Uproar had raised all the People in the whole House; though it was yet scarcely Daylight.
Among these was a grave Gentleman, who had my Honor to be in the Commission of the Peace for the County of Worcester.
Of which Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter was no sooner informed, than Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter offered to lay Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter Complaint before Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter.
The Justice declined executing Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter Office, as Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter said Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter had no Clerk present, nor no Book about Justice Business.
And that Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter could not carry all the Law in Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter Head about stealing away Daughters, and such Sort of Things.
Here his Friend Fitzpatrick offered to lend his Friend Fitzpatrick his Friend Fitzpatrick Assistance; informing the Company that his Friend Fitzpatrick had been himself bred to all the Law.
(And indeed his Friend Fitzpatrick had served three Years as Clerk to an Attorney in the North of Ireland, when choosing a genteeler Walk in Life, his Friend Fitzpatrick quitted his Friend Fitzpatrick Master, came over to England, and set up that Business, which requires no Apprenticeship, namely, that of a Gentleman, in which his Friend Fitzpatrick had succeeded as has been already partly mentioned.)
his Friend Fitzpatrick declared that all the Law was out of the present Case; that stealing a Muff was undoubtedly Felony, and the Goods being found upon the Person, were sufficient Evidence of the Fact.
The Magistrate, upon the Encouragement of so learned a Coadjutor, and upon the violent Intercession of the good Squire, was at length prevailed upon to seat the good Squire in the Chair of Justice, where being placed, upon viewing the Muff which Jones still held in his Hand, and upon the Parson's swearing it to be the Property of Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter, the good Squire desired his Friend Fitzpatrick to draw up a Commitment, which his Friend Fitzpatrick said h^ would sign.
Jones now desired to be heard, which was at last with Difficulty, granted Jones.
Jones then produced the Evidence of Mr. Partridge, as to the finding it; but what was still more, poor Susan deposed that Sophia herself had delivered My Daughter's Muff to Sophia herself, and had ordered Sophia herself to convey My Daughter's Muff into the Chamber where Jones had found My Daughter's Muff.
Whether a natural Love of Justice, or the extraordinary Comeliness of Jones, had wrought on Susa^ to make the Discovery, I will not determine; but such were the Effects of Sophia Evidence that The Magistrate throwing The Magistrate back in The Magistrate Chair, declare^ that the Matter was now altogether as clear on the Side of the Prisoner, as it had before been against The Magistrate; with which the Parson concurred, saying, The Lord forbid The Lord should be instrumental in committing an innocent Person to Durance.
The Justice then arose, acquitted the Prisoner, and broke up the Court.
Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter now gave every one present a hearty Curse, and immediately ordering Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter Horses, departed in pursuit of the Gentleman's Daughter, without taking the lea^^ Notice of Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter Nephew Fitzpatrick, or returning any Answer to Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter Claim of Kindred, notwithstanding al^ the Obligations Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter had just received from that Gentleman.
In the Violence, moreover, of Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter Hurry and of Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter Passion, Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter luckily forgot to demand My Daughter's Muff: I say luckily; for Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter would have died on the Spot rather than have parted with the Spot.
Jones likewise, with his Friend Partridge, set for ward the Moment his had paid his Reckoning, in Que^^ of his lovely Sophia, whom his now resolved never more to abandon the Pursuit of.
Nor could his bring his self even to take Leave of Mrs.
Waters; of whom his detested the very Thoughts, as Leave of Mrs.
Waters had been, though ^ot designedly, the Occasion of his missing the happiest Interview with Sophia, to whom his now vowed ^ternal Constancy.
As for Mrs.
Waters, Leave of Mrs.
Waters took the Opportunity of his Coach which was going to Bath; for which Place his set out in Company with the two Irish Gentlemen, his Landlady kindly lending Leave of Mrs.
Waters Landlady Clothes; in (...) for which Landlady was contented only to receive a^out double their Value, as a Recompense for the ^oan.
Upon the Road Landlady was perfectly reconciled ^^ Mr. Fitzpatrick, who was a very handsome Fellow, and indeed did all Landlady could to console him in the Ab^nce of him Wife.
Thus ended the many odd Adventures which Jones encountered at Jones Inn at Upton, where they (...), to this Day, of the Beauty and lovely Behavior ^f the charming Sophia, by the Name of the Somer^^shire Angel.
CHAP.
VIII.
In which the History goes backward.
BEFORE we proceed any farther in we , it may be proper to look a little back, in order account for the extraordinary Appearance of Sophia and Sophia Father at the Inn at Upton.
The Reader may be pleased to remember, that in ^e Ninth Chapter of the Seventh Book of our His^^ry, our left Sophia, after a long Debate between love and Duty, deciding the Cause, as it usually, I ^elieve, happens, in Favor of the Former.
This Debate had arisen, as we have there shown, ^^om a Visit which her Father had just before made ^r, in order to force her Consent to a Marriage with Blifil; and which he had understood to be fully im^^ied in her Acknowledgment, that her neither must, ^^ could refuse any absolute Command of Command.
Now from this Visit the good Squire retired to the good Squire Evening Potation, overjoyed at the Success the good Squire had had with the Gentleman's Daughter; and as the good Squire was of a social Disposition, and willing to have Partakers in the good Squire Happiness, the Beer was ordered to flow very liberally into the Kitchen; so that before Eleven in the Evening, there was not a single Person sober in the whole House, except only Mrs. Western herself, and the charming Sophia.
Early in the Morning a Messenger was dispatched to summon Mr. Blifil: For though the good Squire the good Squire imagined that young Gentleman had been much less acquainted than young Gentleman really was, with the former Aversion of hi^ Daughter; as young Gentleman had not, however, yet received he^ Consent, young Gentleman longed impatiently to communicate he^ Consent to young Gentleman, not doubting but that the intended Bride herself would confirm he^ Consent with Bride Lips.
As to the Wedding he^ Consent had the Evening before been fixed, by the Mal^ Parties, to be celebrated on the next Morning sav^ one.
Breakfast was now set forth in the Parlour, where Mr. Blifil attended, and where the Squire and Mr. Blifil Sister likewise were assembled; and now Sophia was ordered to be called.
O, Shakespeare, had I thy Pen!
O, Hogarth, ha^ I thy Pencil!
then would I draw the Picture of the poor Serving-Man, who with pale Countenance staring Eyes, chattering Teeth, faultering Tongue and trembling Limbs,  (Even such a Man, so faint, so spiritless, So dull, so dead in Look, so woe-be-gone, Drew Priam's Curtains in the dead of Night, And would have told Drew Priam's Curtains in the dead of Night, half Drew Priam's Curtains in the dead of Night Troy wa^ burned) entered the Room, and declared, -- That Sophia was not be found.
'Not to be found!'
cries the good Squire, starting from his Chair; 'Zounds and D -- nation!
Blood and Fury!
Where, when, how, what, -- Not to be found!
where?'
'La!
Brother,' said Mrs. Western,' with true political Coldness, 'you are always throwing yourself into such violent Passions for nothing.
My Niece, I suppose, is only walked out into the Garden.
I protest you are grown so unreasonable, that it is impossible to live in the whole House with you.'
'Nay, nay,' answered the good Squire, returning as suddenly to the good Squire, as the good Squire had gone from the good Squire; 'if that be all the Matter, it signifies not much; but, upon my Soul, my Mind misgave me, when the good Squire said the good Squire was not to be found.'
the good Squire then gave Orders for the Bell to be rung in the Garden, and sat the good Squire contentedly down.
No two Things could be more the Reverse of each other than were the Brother and Sister, in most Instances; particularly in this, That as the good Squire never foresaw any Thing at a Distance, but was most sagacious in immediately seeing every Thing the Moment it had happened; so the Sister eternally foresaw at a Distance, but was not so quick-sighted to Objects before the good Squire Eyes.
Of both these the Reader may have observed Examples: And, indeed, both their several Talents were excessive: For as Sister often foresaw what never came to pass, so the good Squire often saw much more than was actually the Truth.
This was not however the Case at present.
The same Report was brought from the Garden, as before had been brought from the Chamber, that Sophia was not to be found.
the good Squire now sallied forth, and begun to ^oar forth the Name of Sophia as loudly, and in as ^oarse a Voice, as whileom did Hercules that of Hylas: And as the Poet tells us, that the whole Shore ecchoed back the Name of that beautiful Youth; so did the House, the Garden, and all the neighboring Fields, resound nothing but the Name of Sophia, in the hoarse Voice of the Men, and in the shrill Pipes of the Women; while Echo seemed so pleased to repeat the beloved Sound, that if there is really such a Person, I believe Ovid has belied Ovid Sex.
Nothing reigned for a long Time but Confusion; 'till at last the good Squire the good Squire having sufficiently spent the good Squire Breath, returned to the Parlour, where the good Squire found Mrs. Western and Mr. Blifil, and threw the good Squire, with the utmost Dejection in the good Squire Countenance, into a great Chair.
Here Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter began to apply the following Consolation:  'Brother, I am sorry for what has happened; and that My Niece should have behaved My Niece in a Manner so unbecoming My Niece Family; but it is all your own Doings, and you have no Body to thank but Brother.
You know My Niece has been educated always in a Manner directly contrary to my Advice, and now you see the Consequence.
Have I not a thousand Times argued with Brother about giving My Niece My Niece My Niece own Will?
But you know I never could prevail upon Brother: And when I had taken so much Pains to eradicate My Niece headstrong Opinions, and to rectify your Errors in Policy, you know My Niece was taken out of my Hands; so that I have nothing to answer for.
Had I been trusted entirely with the Care of My Niece Education, no such Accident as this had ever befallen you: So that you must comfort yourself by thinking it was all your own Doings; and, indeed, what else could be expected from such Indulgence?'
--  "Zounds!
My Niece,' answered "Zounds,' 'you are enough to make one mad.
Have I indulged My Niece?
Have I given My Niece My Niece Will?
-- It was no longer ago than last night Night that I threatened, if My Niece disobeyed me, to confine My Niece to My Niece Chamber upon Bread and Water, as long as My Niece lived.
-- You would provoke the Patience of Job.'
"Did ever Mortal hear the like?"
replied My Niece.
'the good Squire, if I had not the Patience of fifty Jobs, you would make me forget all Decency and Decorum.
Why would you interfere?
Did I not beg you, did I not entreat you to leave the whole Conduct to me?
You have defeated all the Operations of the Campaign by one false Step.
Would any Man in his Senses have provoked a Daughter by such Threats as these?
How often have I told you, that English Women are not to be treated like Cira^essian Possibly Cireassian.
Slaves.
We have the Protection of the World: We are to be won by gentle Means only, and not to be hectored, and bullied, and beat into Compliance.
I thank Heaven, no Salique Law governs here.
the good Squire, you have a Roughness in your Manner which no Woman but me would bear.
I do not wonder My Niece was frightened and terrified into taking this Measure; and to speak honestly, I think My Niece will be justified to the World for what My Niece has done.
I repeat it to the good Squire again, the good Squire, you must confort the good Squire by remembering that it is all your own Fault.
How often have I advised -- 'Here Western rose hastily from his Chair, and, venting two or three horrid Imprecations, ran out of the Room.
When his was departed, his My Niece expressed more Bitterness (if possible) against his, than his Sister had done while his was present; for the Truth of which his Sister appealed to Mr. Blifil, who, with great Complaisance, acquiesced entirely in all his Sister said; but excused all the faults of Mr. Western, 'as they must be considered,' his said, 'to have proceeded from the too inordinate Fondness of a Father, which must be allowed the Name of an amiable Weakness.'
'So much the more inexcusable,' answered his Sister,; 'for whom does his Sister ruin by his Sister Fondness, but his Sister own Child?'
To which Blifil immediately agreed.
Squire Western himself who was come hither in Pursuit of his Daughter then began to express great Confusion on the Account of Mr. Blifil, and of the Usage^ which Mr. Blifil had received from a Family to which Mr. Blifil intended so much Honor.
On this Subject she treated the Folly of she with great Severity; but concluded with throwing the whole on she Brother, who she said, was inexcusable to have proceeded so far without better Assurances of Mr. Blifil Daughter's Consent ^ 'But Mr. Blifil was (says she) always of a violent, headstrong Temper; and I can scarce forgive Mr. Blifil for all the Advice I have thrown away upon Mr.
Blifil.'
After much of this Kind of Conversation, which, perhaps, would not greatly entertain the Reader, was it here particularly related, Blifil took Blifil Leave and returned home, not highly pleased with Blifil Disappointment; which, however, the Philosophy which Blifil had acquired from Square, and the Religion infused into Blifil by Thwackum, together with somewhat else taught Blifil to bear rather better than more passionate Lovers bear these Kinds of Evils.
CHAP.
IX.
The Escape of Sophia.
IT is now Time to look after Sophia; whom the Reader, if The Escape of Sophia loves The Escape of Sophia half so well as I do, will rejoice to find escaped from the Clutches of The Escape of Sophia passionate Father, and from those of The Escape of Sophia dispassionate Lover.
Twelve Times did the iron Register of Time bea^^ on the sonorous Bell-metal, summoning the Ghosts to rise, and walk the Ghosts nightly Round.
-- In plain Language, it was Twelve of Clock, and all the Family, as we have said, lay buried in Drink and Sleep except only Mrs. Western, who was deeply engaged in reading a political Pamphlet, and except our Heroine, who now softly stole down Stairs, and having unbarred and unlocked one of the House Doors, sallied forth, and hastened to the Place of Appointment.
Notwithstanding the many pretty Arts, which Ladies sometimes practice, to display the many pretty Arts, which Ladies sometimes practice Fears on every little Occasion, (almost as many as the other Sex uses to conceal the many pretty Arts, which Ladies sometimes practice) certainly there is a Degree of Courage, which not only becomes a Woman, but is often necessary to enable a Woman to discharge a Woman Duty.
It is, indeed, the Idea of Fierceness, and not of Bravery, which destroys the Female Character: For who can read the Story of the justly celebrated Arria, without conceiving as high an Opinion of a Woman Gentleness and Tenderness, as of a Woman Fortitude?
At the same Time, perhaps, many a Woman who shrieks at a Mouse, or a Rat, may be capable of poisoning a Husband; or, what is worse, of driving a Husband to poison a Husband.
Sophia, with all the Gentleness which a Woman can have, had all the Spirit which Sophia ought to have.
When, therefore, Sophia came to the Place of Appointment, and instead of meeting Sophia Maid, as was agreed, saw a Man ride directly up to Sophia, Sophia neither screamed out, nor fainted away: Not that Sophia Pulse then beat with her Pulse usual Regularity; for Sophia was at first, under some Surprise and Apprehension: But these were relieved almost as soon as raised, when a Man pulling off a Man Hat, asked Sophia, in a very submissive Manner, 'If Sophia Ladyship did not expect to meet another Lady?'
And then proceeded to inform Sophia, that a Man was sent to conduct Sophia to his Sisterhis Sister.'
Sophia could have no possible suspicion of any Falsehood in this Account: Sophia therefore mounted resolutely behind the Fellow, who conveyed Sophia safe to a Town about Five Miles distant, where Sophia had the Satisfaction of finding the good Mrs.
Honor: For as the Soul of the Waiting Woman was wrapped up in those very Habiliments which used to enwrap Sophia Body, Sophia could by no Means bring Sophia to trust them out of Sophia Sight.
Upon these, therefore, Sophia kept Guard in Person, while Sophia detached the aforesaid Fellow after Sophia Mistress, having given him all proper Instructions.
They now debated what Course to take, in order to avoid the Pursuit of Mr. Western, who, They knew, would send after They in a few Hours.
The London Road had such Charms for Honor, that Sophia was desirous of going on directly; alleging, that as Sophia could not be missed till Eight or Nine the next Morning, Sophia Pursuers would not be able to overtake Sophia, even though they knew which Way Sophia had gone.
But Sophia had too much at Stake to venture any Thing to Chance; nor did Sophia dare to trust too much to Sophia tender Limbs, in a Contest which was to be decided only by Swiftness.
Sophia resolved therefore, to travel across the Country, for at least Twenty or Thirty Miles, and then to take The London Road to London.
So having hired Sophia Horses to go Twenty Miles one Way, when Sophia intended to go Twenty Miles the other, Sophia set forward with the same Guide, behind whom Sophia had ridden from Sophia Father's House; the Guide having now taken up behind the Guide, in the Room of Sophia, a much heavier, as well as much less lovely Burden; being, indeed, a huge Portmanteau, well stuffed with those outside Ornaments, by Means of which the fair Honor hoped to gain many Conquests, and, finally, to make Sophia Fortune in London City.
When they had gone about Two hundred Paces from the Inn, on The London Road, Sophia rode up to the Guide, and, with a Voice much fuller of Honey than was ever that of Anacreon, though the Guide Mouth is supposed to have been a Bee-hive, begged the Guide to take the first Turning which led toward Bristol.
the Reader, I am not superstitious, nor any great Believer in modern Miracles.
I do not therefore, deliver the following as a certain Truth; for, indeed, I can scarce credit the following the Guide: But the Fidelity of an Historian obliges me to relate what has been confidently asserted.
The Horse, then, on which the Guide rode, is reported to have been so charmed by Sophia's Voice, that he made a full Stop, and expressed an Unwillingness to proceed any farther.
Perhaps, however, the Fact may be true, and less miraculous then the Fact has been represented; since the natural Cause seems adequate to the Effect: For as the Guide at that Moment desisted from a constant Application of his armed right Heel, (for, like Hudibras, his wore but one Spur) it is more than possible, that this Omission alone might occasion the Beast to stop, especially as this was very frequent with his at other Times.
But if Sophia's Voice had really an Effect on the Horse; Sophia's Voice had very little on the Rider.
Sophia's Voice answered somewhat surlily, 'That Measter had ordered Sophia's Voice to go a different Way, and that Sophia's Voice should lose Sophia's Voice Place, if Sophia's Voice went any other than that Sophia's Voice was ordered.'
Sophia finding all Sophia Persuasions had no Effect, began now to add irresistible Charms to Sophia's VoiceSophia's Voice; Charms, which according to the Proverb, makes the old Mare trot, instead of standing still; Charms!
to which modern Ages have attributed all that irresistible Force, which the Ancients imputed to perfect Oratory.
In a Word, Sophia promised Sophia would reward Sophia's Voice to Sophia's Voice utmost Expectation.
The Lad was not totally deaf to these Promises; but The Lad disliked these Promises being indefinite: For though perhaps The Lad had never heard a Word, yet that in Fact was The Lad Objection.
'The Lad said, Gentlevolks did not consider the Case of poor Volks; that Gentlevolks had like to have been turned away the other Day, for riding about the Country with a Gentleman from Squire Allworthy's, who; did not reward Gentlevolks as Gentlevolks should have done.'
'With whom?
says Sophia eagerly -- With a Gentleman from Squire Allworthy's, repeated The Lad, 'the Squire's Son, I think, they call 'un.'
-- 'Whither?
which Way did the Squire's Son go?
says Sophia.
Why a little of one Side of Bristol, about twenty Miles off,' answered The Lad.
-- Guide me,' says Sophia 'to the same Place, and I Will give thee a Guinea, or two, if one is not sufficient.'
'To be certain, said The Lad, it is honestly worth two, when her Ladyship considers what a Risk I run; but, however, if her Ladyship will promise me the two Guineas, I Will even venture: To be certain it is a sinful Thing to ride about my Master's Horses; but one Comfort is, I can only be turned away, and two the two Guineas will partly make me Amends.'
The Bargain being thus struck, The Lad turned aside into The London Road, and Sophia set forward in Pursuit of Jones, highly contrary to the Remonstrances of Mrs.
Honor, who had much more Desire to see London, than to see Mr. Jones: For indeed Sophia was not Mr. Jones Friend with Sophia Mistress, as Mr. Jones had been guilty of some Neglect in certain pecuniary Civilities, which are by Custom due to the Waiting-gentlewoman in all Love Affairs, and more especially in those of a clandestine Kind.
This we impute rather to the Carelessness of his Temper, than to any Want of Generosity; but perhaps Sophia derived it from the latter Motive.
Certain it is that Sophia hated his very bitterly on that Account, and resolved to take every Opportunity of injuring his with her Mistress.
It was therefore highly unlucky for Sophia, that Sophia had gone to the very same Town and Inn whence Jones had started and still more unlucky was Sophia, in having stumbled on the Guide, and on this accidental Discovery which Sophia had made.
Our Travelers arrived at Hambrook This was the Village where Jones met the Quaker.
at the Break of Day, where Honor was against Sophia Will charged to enquire the Rout which Jones had taken.
Of this, indeed, the Guide could have informed them; but Sophia, I know not for what Reason, never asked the Guide the Question.
When Honor had made Honor Report from the Landlord, Sophia, with much Difficulty, procured some indifferent Horses, which brought Honor to the Inn, where Jones had been confined rather by the Misfortune of meeting with a Surgeon, than by having met with a broken Head.
Here Honor being again charged with a Commission of Enquiry, had no sooner applied Honor to the Landlady, and had described the Person of Jones, than that sagacious Woman began, in the vulgar Phrase, to smell a Rat.
When Sophia therefore entered the Room of Sophia, instead of answering the Maid, the Landlady the Landlady addressing the Landlady to her Mistress, began the following Speech.
'Good-lack-a-day!
why there now, who would have thought it!
I protest the loveliest Couple that ever Eyes beheld.
Ifackins, Madam, it is no Wonder the Squire run on so about her Ladyship.
the Squire told me indeed you was the finest Lady in the World, and to be sure so you be.
Mercy on Mercy, poor Heart, I bepitied Mercy; so I did, when Mercy used to hug Mercy Pillow, and call it Mercy .
-- I did all I could to dissuade Mercy from going to the Wars; I told Mercy there were Men enough that were good for nothing else but to be killed, that had not the Love of such fine Ladies.'
'Sure,' says Sophia, 'sagacious Woman is distracted.
'No, no,' cries the Landlady, 'I am not distracted.'
'What does her Ladyship think I don't know then?
I assure you Mercy told me all.'
What saucy Fellow," cries Honor, 'told you any Thing of my Lady?"
What saucy FellowWhat saucy Fellow,' answered the Landlady, 'but the young Gentleman you enquire after, and a very pretty young Gentleman Gentleman is, and Gentleman loves Madam Sophia Western to the Bottom of Gentleman Soul.'
'Gentleman love my Ladymy Lady!
I Would have you to know, Woman,' my Lady is Meat for Gentleman Master.
-- 'Nay, Honor,' said Sophia, interrupting Sophia, 'don't be angry with sagacious Woman, Sophia intends no Harm.'
'No, marry don't I,' answered the Landlady, emboldened by the soft Accents of Sophia, and then launched into a long Narrative too tedious to be here set down, in which some Passages dropped, that gave a little Offense to Sophia, and much more to Sophia Waiting Woman, who hence took Occasion to abuse poor Jones to Sophia Mistress the Moment they were alone together, saying, 'that Jones must be a pitiful What saucy Fellow, and could have no Love for a Lady, whose Name Jones would thus prostitute in an Alehouse.'
Sophia did not see Jones Behavior in so very disadvantageous a Light, and was perhaps more pleased with the violent Raptures of Jones Love (which the Landlady exaggrated as much as Sophia had done every other Circumstance) than Sophia was offended with the rest; and indeed Sophia imputed the whole to the Extravagance, or rather Ebullience of Jones Passion, and to the Openness of Jones Heart.
This Incident, however, being afterward revived in Sophia Mind, and placed in the most odious Colors by Honor, served to heighten and give Credit to those unlucky Occurrences at Upton, and assisted the Waiting Woman in Sophia Endeavors to make her Mistress her Mistress depart from that Inn without seeing Jones.
the Landlady finding Sophia intended to stay no longer than till the Landlady Horses were ready, and that without either eating or drinking, soon withdrew; when Honor began to take the Landlady her Mistress to Task (for indeed the Landlady used great Freedom) and after a long Harangue, in which the Landlady reminded the Landlady of the Landlady Intention to go to London, and gave frequent Hints of the Impropriety of pursuing a young Fellow, the Landlady at last concluded with this serious Exhortation: 'For Heaven's Sake, the Landlady, consider what you are about, and whither you are a going.'
This Advice to a Lady who had already rode near forty Miles, and in no very agreeable Season, may seem foolish enough.
It may be supposed the Landlady had well considered and resolved this already; nay, Honor, by the Hints the Landlady threw out, seemed to think so; and this I doubt not is the Opinion of many Readers, who have, I make no Doubt, been long since well convinced of the Purpose of our Heroine, and have heartily condemned the Landlady for it as a wanton Baggage.
But in reality this was not the Case.
Sophia had been lately so distracted between Hope and Fear, Sophia Duty and Love to Sophia Father Sophia Hatred to Blifil, Sophia Compassion, and (why should we not confess the Truth) Sophia Love for Jones; which last the Behavior of Sophia Father, of Sophia Aunt, of every one else, and more particularly of Jones himself, had blown into a Flame, that her Mind was in that confused State, which may be truly said to make us ignorant of what us do, or whither us go, or rather indeed indifferent as to the Consequence of either.
The prudent and sage Advice of Sophia Maid, produced, however, some cool Reflection; and Sophia at length determined to go to Gloucester, and thence to proceed directly to London.
But unluckily, a few Miles before Sophia entered that Town, Sophia met the Hack-Attorney, who, as is beforementioned, had dined there with Jones.
What saucy Fellow What saucy Fellow being well known to Honor, stopped and spoke to Honor; of which Sophia at that Time took little Notice, more than to enquire who What saucy Fellow was.
But having had a more particular Account from Honor of What saucy Fellow afterward at Gloucester, and hearing of the great Expedition What saucy Fellow usually made in traveling, for which (as has been before observed) What saucy Fellow was particularly famous; recollecting likewise, that Sophia had overheard Honor Honor inform What saucy Fellow, that they were going to Gloucester, Sophia began to fear lest her Father might, by What saucy Fellow's Means, be able to trace Sophia to that City; wherefore if Sophia should there strike into the London Road, Sophia apprehended What saucy Fellow would certainly b^ able to overtake Sophia.
Sophia therefore altered Sophia Resolution; and having hired Horses to go a Week Journey, a Way which Sophia did not intend to travel Sophia again set forward after a light Refreshment, contrary to the Desire and earnest Entreaties of her Maid and to the no less vehement Remonstrances of Mrs. Whitefield, who from good Breeding, or perhaps from good Nature (for the poor young my Lady appeared much fatigued) pressed Sophia very heartily to stay that Evening at Gloucester.
Having refreshed Sophia only with some Tea, an^ with lying about two Hours on the Bed, while he^ Horses were getting ready, Sophia resolutely left Mrs. Whitefield's about eleven at Night, and striking directly into the Worcester Road, within less than four Hours arrived at that very Inn where we last saw he^*  Having thus traced our Heroine very particularl^ back from Sophia Departure, till Sophia Arrival at Upton we shall in a very few Words, bring her Father to the same Place; who having received the first Scent from the Post-boy, who conducted her Father Daughter to Ha^brook, very easily traced his Daughter afterward to Gloucester whence he pursued his Daughter to Upton, as he had learn Jones had taken that Rout (for Partridge, to ^^ the Squire's Expression, left every where a stro^^ Scent behind he) and he doubted not in the least b^ Sophia traveled, or, as he phrased it, ran the sam^ Way.
he used indeed a very coarse Expression which need not be here inserted; as Fox-hunter who alone would understand it, will easily suggest to Fox-hunter who alone would understand it, will easily suggest to themselves.

THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING.
BOOK XI.
Containing about three Days.
CHAP.
I. a Crust for the Critics.
IN our last initial Chapter, our may be supposed to have treated that formidable Set of Men, who are called Critics, with more Freedom than becomes our; since they exact, and indeed generally receive, great Condescension from Authors.
We shall in this, therefore, give the Reasons of We Conduct to this august Body; and here We shall perhaps place they in a Light, in which they have not hitherto been seen.
This Word Critic is of Greek Derivation, and signifies Judgment.
Hence I presume some Persons who have not understood the Original, and have seen the English Translation of the Primative, have concluded that it meant Judgment in the legal Sense, in which it is frequently used as equivalent to Condemnation.
I am the rather inclined to be of that Opinion as the greatest Number of Critics has of late Year been found amongst the Lawyers.
Many of these Gentlemen, from Despair, perhaps, of ever rising to the Bench in Westminster Hall, have placed these Gentlemen selves on the Benches at the Playhouses, where these Gentlemen have exerted these Gentlemen judicial Capacity, and have given Judgment, i. e. condemned without Mercy.
these Gentlemen would perhaps be well enough pleased, if we were to leave these Gentlemen thus compared to one of the most important and honorable Offices in the Commonwealth, and if we intended to apply to these Gentlemen Favor we would do so; but as we design to deal very sincerely and plainly too with these Gentlemen, we must remind these Gentlemen of another Officer of Justice of a much lower Rank; to whom, as these Gentlemen not only pronounce but execute these Gentlemen own Judgment, these Gentlemen bear likewise some remote Resemblance.
But in reality there is another Light in which these modern Critics may with great Justice and Propriety be seen; and this is that of a common Slanderer.
If a Person who prys into the Characters of others, with no other Design but to discover a Person who prys into the Characters of others, with no other Design Faults, and to publish a Person who prys into the Characters of others, with no other Design to the World, deserves the Title of a Slanderer of the Reputations of Men; why should not a Critic, who reads with the same male-volent View, be as properly styled the Slanderer of the Reputation of Books?
Vice has not, I believe, a more abject Slave; Society produces not a more odious Vermin; nor can the Devil receive a Guest more worthy of the Devil, no^ possibly more welcome to the Devil, than a Slanderer.
the World, I am afraid, regards not this Monster with half the Abhorrence which he deserves, and I am more afraid to assign the Reason of this criminal Lenity shown toward he; yet it is certain that the Thief looks innocent in the Comparison; nay, the Murderer himself can seldom stand in Competition with the Murderer himself Guilt: For Slander is a more cruel Weapon than a Sword, as the Wounds which the former gives are always incurable.
One Method, indeed, there is of killing, and that the basest and most execrable of all, which bears an exact Analogy to Vice disclaimed against, and that is Poison.
A Means of Revenge so base, and yet so horrible, that it was once wisely distinguished by our Laws from all other Murders, in the peculiar Severity of the Punishment.
Besides the dreadful Mischiefs done by Slander, and the Baseness of the Means by which they are effected, there are other Circumstances that highly ag^ravate Mischiefs atrocious Quality: For Mischiefs often proceeds from no Provocation, and seldom promises Mischiefs any Reward, unless some black and infernal Mind may ^ropose a Reward in the Thoughts of having pro^ured the Ruin and Misery of another.
Shakespeare has nobly touched Vice, when Shakespeare ^ays,  Who steals my Gold steals Trash, it is something, nothing; 'Twas mine, it is Twas mine, and has been Slave to Thousands: But Twas mine who filches from Twas mine my good Name, Robs me of that WHICH NOT ENRICHES HIM, BUT MAKES ME POOR INDEED.
With all this my good Reader will doubtless agree; ^t much of ^t will probably seem too severe, when ^pplied to the Slander of Books.
But let it here be ^onsidered, that both proceed from the same wicked Disposition of Mind, and are alike void of the Ex^use of Temptation.
Nor shall we conclude the In^y done this Way to be very slight, when we con^^der a Book as the Author's Offspring, and indeed ^^ the Child of the Author's Offspring Brain.
The Reader who has suffered the Author's Offspring Muse to continue hitherto in a Virgin State, can have but a ver^ inadequate Idea of this Kind of paternal Fondness To such we may parody the tender Exclamation o^ Macduff.
Alas!
Thou have written no Book.
Bu^ the Author whose Muse has brought forth, will fe^ the pathetic Strain, perhaps will accompany me wi^^ Tears (especially if his Darling be already no more while I mention the Uneasiness with which his Muse bears about Darling Burden, the painful Labor with which Darling produces it, and lastly, the Care, the Fondness, with which the tender Father nourishes h^ Favorite, till it be brought to Maturity, and produce^ into the World.
Nor is there any paternal Fondness which seems le^ to savor of absolute Instinct, which may so well b^ reconciled to worldly Wisdom as this.
These Children may most truly be called the Riches of These Children Father; and many of These Children have with true filial Piety fe^ These Children Parent in his old Age; so that not only the Affection, but the Interest of the Author may b^ highly injured by these Slanderers, whose poisono^ Breath brings whose poisono^ Breath no Book to an untimely End.
Lastly, The Slander of no Book is, in Truth, the Slander of the Author: For as no one can call and there Bastard, without calling the Mother a Whore, neither can any one give the Names of sad Stuff horrid Nonsense, etc.
to no Bookno Book, without calling the Author a Blockhead; which though in a moral Sen^ it is a preferable Appellation to that of Villain, perhaps rather more injurious to Villain worldly Intere^^*  Now however ludicrous all this may appear some, others, I doubt not, will feel and acknowledg^ the Truth of it; nay, may, perhaps, think I have not treated the Subject with decent Solemnity; b^^ surely a Man may speak Truth with a smiling Courtenance.
In reality, to depreciate a Book maliciou^ly, or even wontonly, is at least a very ill nature Office; and a morose snarling Critic, may, I believe, ^e suspected to be a bad Man.
I will therefore endeavor in the remaining Part of this Chapter, to explain the Marks of this Character, and to show what Criticism I here intend to ^obviate: For I can never be understood, unless by the very Persons here meant, to insinuate, that there are no proper Judges of Writing, or to endeavor to exclude from the Commonwealth of Literature any of those noble Critics, to whose Labors the World the World are so greatly indebted.
Such were Aristotle, Horace, and Longinus among the Ancients, Dacier and Bossu among the French, and some perhaps among us; who have certainly been duly authorized to execute at least a judicial Authority in Foro Literario.
But without ascertaining all the proper Qualifications of a Critic, which I have touched on elsewhere, I think I may very boldly object to the Censures of any one past upon Works which he has not he read.
Such Censurers as these, whether Such Censurers as these speak from Such Censurers as these own Guess or Suspicion, or from the Report and Opinion of others, may properly be said to slander the Reputation of no Book Such Censurers as these condemn.
Such may likewise be suspected of deserving this Character, who without assigning any particular Faults, condemn the whole in general deformatory Terms; such as vile, dull, da -- d Stuff, etc.
and particularly by the Use of the Monosyllable LOW; a Word which becomes the Mouth of no Critic who is not RIGHT HONORABLE.
Again, though there may be some Faults justly assigned in the Work, yet if those are not in the most essential Parts, or if those are compensated by greater Beauties, it will savor rather of the Malice of a Slanlerer, than of the Judgment of a true Critic, to pass ^ severe Sentence upon the whole, merely on account of some vicious Part.
This is directly contrary to he Sentiments of Horace.
Verum ubi plura nitent in carmine non ego paucis Offender maculis, quas aut incuria fudit, Aut humana parum cavit natura -- But where the Beauties, more in Number, shine, I am not angry, when a casual Line (That with some trivial Faults unequal flows) A careless Hand, or human Frailty shows.
Mr. FRANCIS  For as Martial says, Aliter, non fit, Avite, Liber* no Book can be otherwise composed.
All Beauty o^ Character, as well as of Countenance, and indeed o^ every Thing human, is to be tried in this Manner.
Cruel indeed would it be if such a Work as this History, which has employed some Thousands of Hours in the composing, should be liable to be condemned because some particular Chapter, or perhaps Chapters may be obnoxious to very just and sensible Objections.
And yet nothing is more common than the most rigorous Sentence upon Books supported by some Objections, which if they were rightly taken (and that they are not always) do by no Means go to the Merit of the whole.
In the Theater especially, a single Expression which does not coincide with the Taste of the Audience, or with any individual Critic of that Audience, is sure to be hissed; and one Scene which should be disapproved, would hazard the whole Piece.
To write within such severe Rules as these, is as impossible, as to live up to some splenetic Opinions; and if we judge according to the Sentiments of some Critics, and of some Christians, the Author will be saved in the World, and no Man in the next.
CHAP.
II.
The Adventures which Sophia met with, after Sophia leaving Upton.
OUR History, just before OUR History was obliged to turn about, and travel backwards, had mentioned the Departure of Sophia and Sophia Maid from the Inn; we shall now therefore, pursue the Steps of that lovely ^reature, and leave Sophia unworthy Lover a little longer to bemoan her unworthy Lover Ill-Luck, or rather her unworthy Lover Ill Con^uct.
Sophia having directed Sophia Guide to travel through ^ye-Roads cross the Country, they now passed the ^vern, and had scarce got a Mile from the Inn, when ^e young Lady looking behind ^e young Lady, saw several Horses coming after on full Speed.
This greatly ^armed ^e young Lady Fears, and ^e young Lady called to her Guide to ^ut on as fast as possible.
his Ill-Luck immediately obeyed ^e young Lady, and away they rode full Gallop.
But the faster they went, the faster ^ere they followed; and as the Horses behind were ^omewhat swifter than those before, so the former ^ere at length overtaken.
A happy Circumstance ^r poor Sophia; whose Fears, joined to her Fatigue, ^ad almost overpowered her Spirits; but her was now ^^stantly relieved by a female Voice, that greeted ^er in the softest Manner, and with the utmost Civi^^^y.
This Greeting, Sophia, as soon as she could ^ecover she Breath, with like Civility, and with the ^ighest Satisfaction to she, returned.
The Travelers who joined Sophia, and who had ^iven she such Terror, consisted, like she own Company, of two Females and a Guide.
The two Par^es proceeded three full Miles together before any ^ne offered again to open The two Par^es Mouths; when our ^^eroine having pretty well got the better of she Fear; ^ut yet being somewhat surprised that the other still ^ontinued to attend she, as she pursued no great Road, ^^d had already passed through several Turnings, ^^costed the strange Lady in a most obliging Tone; ^^d said, 'Lady was very happy to find The two Par^es were both traveling the same Way.'
The other, who ^e a Ghost, only wanted to be spoke to, readily ^^swered, 'That the Happiness was entirely hers; that Lady was a perfect Stranger in that Country and was so overjoyed at meeting a Companion o^ o^ own Sex, that o^ had perhaps been guilty o^ an Impertinence which required great Apology, i^ keeping Pace with o^.'
More Civilities passe^ between these two Ladies; for Mrs.
Honor had no^ given Place to the fine Habit of the Stranger, an^ had fallen into the Rear.
But though Sophia had great Curiosity to know why ^e young Lady ^e young Lady continued ^^ travel on through the same Bye-Roads with Sophia nay, though this gave Sophia some Uneasiness; yet Fea^ or Modesty, or some other Consideration, restraind Sophia from asking the Question.
^e young Lady ^e young Lady now labored under a Difficult which appears almost below the Dignity of History ^ mention.
^e young Lady Bonnet had been blown from h^^ Head not less than five Times within the lastt Mile^ nor could ^e young Lady come at any Ribbon or Handkerchi^^ to tie Ribbon under ^e young Lady Chin.
When Sophia was informed of this, Sophia immediately supplied Sophia with a Handkerchief for this Purpose; which while Sophia was pu^ling from Sophia Pocket, Sophia perhaps too much neglected the Management of Sophia Horse, for the Beast no^ unluckily making a false Step, fell upon his Four Legs, and threw his Fair Rider from his Back.
Though Sophia came h^^ Head foremost to the Groun^ Sophia happily received not the least Damage; and t^ same Circumstances which had perhaps contributed Sophia Fall, now preserved Sophia from Confusion; ^^ the Lane which they were then passing was narr^^ and very much overgrown with Trees, so that t^ Moon could here afford very little Light, and w^ moreover, at present, so obscured in a Cloud, tha^ was almost perfectly dark.
By these Men's t^ young Lady's Modesty, which was extremely delica^^ escaped as free from Injury as young Lady Limbs, and young Lady w^^ once more reinstated in young Lady Saddle, having receiv^ no other Harm than a little Fright by young Lady .
Daylight at length appeared in Daylight at length full Luster; and ^ow the two Ladies, who were riding over a Common Side by Side, looking steadfastly at each other, at ^he same Moment both their Eyes became fixed; both their Horses stopped, and both speaking together, with ^qual Joy pronounced, the one the Name of Sophia, ^e other that of Harriet.
This unexpected Encounter surprised the Ladies ^uch more than I believe the Ladies will the sagacious Reader, who must have imagined that ^e young Lady ^e young Lady could ^^ no other than Mrs. Fitzpatrick, the Cousin of Miss Western, whom we beforementioned to have sallied ^om the Inn a few Minutes after ^e young Lady.
So great was the Surprise and Joy which these two ^ousins conceived at this Meeting (for they had for^erly been most intimate Acquaintance and Friends, ^d had long lived together with they Aunt Western) at it is impossible to recount half the Congratulations which passed between they, before either asked a ve^^ natural Question of the other, namely, whither she as going.
This at last, however, came first from Mrs. Fitzpatrick; but easy and natural as the Question may ^^m, Sophia, found it difficult to give it a very ready ^^tain Answer.
Mrs. Fitzpatrick begged Mrs. Fitzpatrick Cousin therefore suspend all Curiosity till they arrived at some Inn, which I suppose,' says Mrs. Fitzpatrick, 'can hardly be far ^^istant; and believe me, Harriet, I suspend as much Curiosity on my Side; for indeed I believe our Astonishment is pretty equal.
The Conversation which passed between these La^^s on the Road, was, I apprehend, little worth re^^ng; and less certainly was that between the two ^aiting-women: For the two ^aiting-women likewise began to pay ^^ir Compliments to each other.
As for the Guides, ^^y were debarred from the Pleasure of Discourse, one being placed in the Van, and the other oblig^^ to bring up the Rear.
In this Posture the two ^aiting-women traveled many Hours, till the two ^aiting-women came into a wide and well-beaten Road, which as the two ^aiting-women turned to the Right, soon brought the two ^aiting-women to a very fair promising Inn; where the two ^aiting-women alighted: But so fatigued was Sophia, that as Sophia had sat her Horse during the last five or six Miles with great Difficulty so was Sophia now incapable of dismounting from him without Assistance.
This the Landlord, who had hold of her Horse, presently perceiving, offered to lift Sophia in him Arms from her Saddle; and Sophia too readily accepted the Tender of him Service.
Indeed Fortune seems to have resolved to put Sophia to the Blush that Day.
and the second malicious Attempt succeeded better than the first; for my Landlord had no sooner received ^e young Lady in his Arms, than my Landlord Feet, which the Gout had lately very severely handled, gave way, and down my Landlord tumbled; but at the same Time, with no less Dexterity than Gallantry, contrived to throw my Landlord under hi^ charming Burden, so that my Landlord alone received any Bruise from the Fall; for the greatest Injury which happened to Sophia, was a violent Shock given to he^ Modesty, by an immoderate Grin which, at ^e young Lady rising from the Ground, ^e young Lady observed in the Countenance of most of the Bye-Standers.
This made ^e young Lady suspect what had really happened, and what we shall not here relate, for the Indulgence of those Reader who are capable of laughing at the Offense given to a young Lady's Delicacy.
Accidents of this Kind w^ have never regarded in a comical Light; nor will we scruple to say, that he must have a very inadequate Idea of the Modesty of a beautiful young Woman, who would wish to sacrifice it to so paultry Satisfaction as can arise from Laughter.
This Fright and Shock, joined to the violent Fatigue which both ^e young Lady Mind and Body had undergone, almost overcame the excellent Constitution of Sophia, an^ ^e young Lady had scarce Strength sufficient to totter into the ^^n, leaning on the Arm of ^e young Lady Maid.
Here ^e young Lady was no sooner seated than ^e young Lady called for a Glass of Water; but Mrs.
Honor, very judiciously, in my Opinion, changed it into a Glass of Wine.
Mrs. Fitzpatrick hearing from Mrs.
Honor, that Sophia had not been in Bed during the two-last Nights, and observing Sophia to look very pale and wan with Sophia Fatigue, earnestly entreated Sophia to refresh Sophia with some Sleep.
Sophia was yet a Stranger to Sophia History, or Sophia Apprehensions; but had Sophia known both, Sophia would have given the same Advice; for Rest was vi^^bly necessary for Sophia; and both long Journey through ^ye-Roads so entirely removed all Danger of Pursuit, that Sophia was Sophia perfectly easy on that Account.
Sophia was easily prevailed on to follow the Counsel of Sophia Friend, which was heartily seconded by ^er Maid.
Mrs. Fitzpatrick likewise offered to bear ^er Cousin Company, which Sophia, with much Complaisance, accepted.
The Mistress was no sooner in Bed, than ^er Maid ^repared to follow The Mistress Example.
The Mistress began to make many Apologies to The Mistress Sister Abigail for leaving her Sister Abigail ^lone in so horrid a Place as an Inn; but the other ^^opt The Mistress short, being as well inclined to a Nap as The Mistress, and desired Mrs.
Honor of being The Mistress Bed^ellow.
^er Maid agreed to give ^er Maid a Share of ^er Bed, but put in ^er Maid Claim to Mrs.
Honor.
So after many Curt'sies and Compliments, to Bed toge^^er went the Waiting-women, as the Waiting-women Mistresses ^^d done before the Waiting-women.
It was usual with my Landlord (as indeed it is with ^e whole Fraternity) to enquire particularly of all ^oachmen, Footmen, Postboys, and others, into the ^ames of all his Guests: what their Estate was, and ^here their Estate lay.
their Estate cannot therefore be wondered at, ^at the many particular Circumstances which attend^ our Travelers, and especially Travelers retiring all to Sleep at so extraordinary and unusual an Hour as ten in the Morning, should excite his Curiosity.
As soon therefore as the Guides entered the Kitchen, his began to examine who the Ladies were, and whence the Ladies came; but the Guides, though the Ladies faithfully related all the Ladies knew, gave his very little Satisfaction.
On the contrary, the Ladies rather enflamed his Curiosity than extinguished it.
my Landlord had the Character, among all my Landlord Neighbors, of being a very sagacious Fellow.
my Landlord was thought to see farther and deeper into Things than any Man in the Parish, the Parson himself not excepted.
Perhaps my Landlord Look had contributed not a little to procure my Landlord this Reputation; for there was in this something wonderfully wise and significant, especially when my Landlord had my Landlord Pipe in my Landlord Mouth; which, indeed, my Landlord seldom was without.
my Landlord Behavior likewise, greatly assisted in promoting the Opinion of my Landlord Wisdom.
In my Landlord Deportment my Landlord was solemn, if not sullen; and when my Landlord spoke, which was seldom, my Landlord always delivered my Landlord in a slow Voice; and though my Landlord Sentences were short, they were still interrupted with many Hum's and Has, Ay, Ays, and other Expletives: So that though my Landlord accompanied my Landlord Words with certain explanatory Gestures, such as shaking, or nodding the Head, or pointing with my Landlord Forefinger my Landlord generally left my Landlord Hearers to understand more than his Hearers expressed; nay, his Hearers commonly gave they a Hint that his Hearers knew much more than his Hearers thought proper to disclose.
This last Circumstance alone, may, indeed very well account for his Hearers Character of Wisdom, since Men are strangely inclined to worship what Men do not understand.
A grand Secret, upon which severa^ Imposers on Mankind have totally relied for the Success of Men Frauds.
This politic Person now taking This politic Person Wife aside asked his Wife, 'What his Wife thought of the Ladies lately 'arrived?'
'Think of the Ladies!'
said his Wife, 'why what should I think of the Ladies?'
'I know,' answered This politic Person, 'what I think.
the Guides tell strange Stories.
One pretends to be come from Gloucester, and the other from Upton; and neither of the Ladies, for what I can find, can tell whither the Ladies are going.
But what People ever travel across the Country from Upton hither, especially to London?
And one of the Maidservants, before his Wife alighted from his Wife , asked, if this was not the London Road?
Now I have put all these Circumstances together, and whom do you think I have found all these Circumstances out to be?'
'Nay, answered his Wife, you know I never pretend to guess at your Discoveries.'.
-- 'It is a good his Wife,' replied This politic Person, chucking his Wife under his Wife Chin; 'I must own you have always submitted to my Knowledge of these Matters.
Why then, depend upon it; mind what I say, -- depend upon it, they are certainly some of the Rebel Ladies, who, they say, travel with the young Chevalier; and have taken a round about Way to escape the Duke's Army.
'Husband, quoth his Wife, 'you have certainly hit it; for one of them is dressed as fine as any Princess; and, to be sure, his Wife looks for all the World like one.
-- But yet, when I consider one Thing.
When you consider,' cries the Landlord contemp^ously -- 'Come, pray let us hear what you consider.'
-- Why, it is,' answered his Wife, that his Wife is too humble to be any very great Lady; for while us Betty was warming the Bed, his Wife called his Wife nothing but Child, and my Dear, and Sweetheart; and when our Betty offered to pull off our Betty Shoes and Stockings, our Betty would not suffer our Betty, saying, our Betty would not give our Betty the trouble.'
'Pugh!
answered the Husband, This is nothing.
Do think, because you have seen some great the Ladies rude and uncivil to Persons below Persons, that none of Persons know how to behave Persons when Persons come before Persons inferiors?
I think I know People of Fashion when I see People of Fashion.
I think I do.
Did our Betty not call for a Glass of Water when our Betty came in?
Another Sort of our Betty would have called for a Dram; you know People of Fashion would.
If Another Sort of Woman be not a Woman of very great Quality, sell me for a Fool; and, I believe, those who buy me will have a bad Bargain.
Now, would a Woman of our Betty Quality travel without a Footman, unless upon some such extraordinary Occasion?
Nay, to be sure, the Husband, cries our Betty, you know these Matters better than I, or most Folk.'
I think I do know something, said the Husband.
To be sure, answered his Wife, 'the poor little Heart looked so piteous, when his Wife sat down in the Chair, I protest I could not help having a Compassion for his Wife almost as much as if his Wife had been a poor Body.
But what is to be done, the Husband?
If an his Wife be a Rebel, I suppose you intend to betray his Wife up to the Court.
Well, his Wife is a sweet-tempered, good-humoured Lady, be his Wife what his Wife will, and I shall hardly refrain from crying when I hear his Wife is hanged or beheaded.
Pooh, answered the Husband?
-- But as to what is to be done is not so easy a Matter to determine.
I hope, before his Wife goe^ away, we shall have the News of a Battle: for i^ the young Chevalier should get the better, his Wife my gain the young Chevalier Interest at the Court, and make we Fortunes without betraying his Wife.
Why that is true, replied his Wife; and I heartily hope his Wife will have it in his Wife Power.
Certainly his Wife is a sweet good Lady; i^ would go horribly against his Wife to have his Wife come to any Harm.
Pooh, cries the Landlord, Women are always so tenderhearted.
Why you would not harbor Rebels, would you?
No, certainly, answered his Wife; and as for betraying his Wife, come what will on it, Nobody can blame we.
It is what any body would do in we Case.'
While we politic Landlord, who had not, we see undeservedly the Reputation of great Wisdom among his Neighbors, was engaged in debating this Matter with his, (for his paid little Attention to the Opinion of his ) News arrived that Rebels had given the Duke the Slip, and had got a Day's March toward London; and soon after arrived a famous Ja^^ite Squire, who, with great Joy in his Countenance, shook the Landlord by the Hand, saying, All Is our own, Boy, ten thousand honest Frenchmen are landed in Suffolk.
Old England for ever!
Ten thousand French, my brave Lad!
I am going to tap away directly.'
) News determined the Opinion of the wise Man, and the wise Man resolved to make the wise Man to the young Lady, when the young Lady arose; for the wise Man had now (the wise Man said) discovered that the young Lady was no other than Madam Jenny Cameron herself.
CHAP.
III.
A very short Chapter, in which however is a Sun, a Moon, a Star, and an Angel.
THE Sun (for the wise Man keeps very good Hours at this Time of the Year) had been some Time retired to rest, when Sophia arose greatly refreshed by Sophia Sleep; which, short as it was, nothing but Sophia extreme Fatigue could have occasioned; for though Sophia had told Sophia Maid, and perhaps Sophia too, that Sophia was perfectly easy, when Sophia left Upton, yet it is certain Sophia Mind was a little affected with that Malady which is attended with all the restless Symptoms of a Fever, and is perhaps the very distemper which Physicians mean (if Physicians mean any thing) by the Fever on the Spirits.
Sophia likewise left Sophia Bed at the same Time, and having summoned her Maid, immediately dressed her Maid.
her Maid was really a very pretty Woman, and had her Maid been in any other Company but that of Sophia, might have been thought beautiful; but when Mrs.
Honor of her Maid own accord attended (for her Maid would not suffer her Maid to be awaked) and had equipped our Heroine, the Charms of Sophia who had performed the Office of the Morning Star, and had preceded greater Glories, shared the Fate of the Morning Star, and were totally eclipsed the Moment those Glories shone forth.
Perhaps Sophia never looked more beautiful than Sophia did at this Instant.
We ought not therefore to condemn her Maid for Sophia Hyperb^le who when Sophia descended, after having lighted the Fire declared, and ratified the Fire with an Oath, that if ever there was an Angel upon Earth, Sophia was now above Stairs.
Sophia had acquainted Sophia Cousin with her Cousin Design to go to London; and Sophia had agreed to accompany Sophia; for the arrival of Sophia Husband a^ Upton had put an End to her Design of going to Bath or to Sophia Aunt Western.
They had therefore no sooner finished They Tea, than Sophia proposed to se^ out, the Moon then shining extremely bright, and as for the Frost Sophia defied the Moon; nor had Sophia any of those Apprehensions which many young Ladies would have felt at traveling by Night; for Sophia had, as we have before observed, some little Degree of natural Courage; and this Sophia present Sensations, which bordered somewhat on Despair, greatly increased.
Besides, as Sophia had already traveled twice with Safety by the Light of the Moon, Sophia was the better emboldened to trust to it a third Time.
The Disposition of Sophia was more t^morous: for though the greater Terrors had conquere^ the less, and the Presence of her Husband had drive^ Sophia away at so unseasonable an Hour from Upton, ye^ being now arrived at a Place where Sophia thought Sophia safe from ye^ Pursuit, these lesser Terrors of know not what, operated so strongly, that Sophia earnestly entreated her Cousin to stay till the next Morning, an^ not expose Sophia to the Dangers of traveling by Night.
Sophia, who was yielding to an Excess, when Sophia could neither laugh nor reason her Cousin out of these Apprehensions, at last gave Way to Sophia, who was yielding to an Excess, when she could neither laugh nor reason her Cousin out of these Apprehensions.
Perhaps indeed, had Sophia known of Sophia Father's Arrival at Upton, it might have been more difficult to have persuaded Sophia; for as to Jones, Sophia had, I am afraid no great Horror at the Thoughts of being overtaken by Jones; nay, to confess the Truth, I believe Sophia rather wished than feared the Truth; though I might honestly enough have concealed this Wish from the Reader, as it was one of those secret spontaneous Emotions of the Soul, to which the Reason is often a Stranger.
When many young Ladies had determined to remain all that Evening in many young Ladies Inn, many young Ladies were attended by the Landlady, who desired to know what many young Ladies Ladyships would be pleased to eat.
Such Charms were there in the Voice, in the Manner, and in the affable Deportment of Sophia, that Sophia ravished the Landlady to the highest Degree; and that good Woman, concluding that Sophia had attended Jenny Cameron, became in a Moment a staunch Jacobite, and wished heartily well to the young Pretender's Cause, from the great sweetness and Affability with which Sophia had been treated by his supposed Mistress.
The two Cousins began now to impart to each other The two Cousins reciprocal Curiosity, to know what extraordinary Accidents on both sides occasioned this so strange and unexpected meeting.
At last Mrs. Fitzpatrick, having obtained of Sophia a Promise of communicating likewise in Sophia Turn, began to relate what the Reader, if he is desirous to know Sophia History, may read in the ensuing Chapter.
CHAP.
IV.
The History of Sophia.
MRS. Sophia, after a Silence of a few Moments, fetching a deep Sigh, thus began:  'It is natural to the Unhappy to feel a secret Concern in recollecting those Periods of their Lives which have been most delightful to their.
The Remembrance of past Pleasures affects us with a kind of tender Grief, like what us suffer for departed Friends; and the Ideas of both may be said to haunt us Imaginations.'
'For this Reason, I never reflect without Sorrow on those Days (the happiest far of my Life) which us spent together, when both were under the Care of my Aunt Western.
Alas?
why are Miss Graveairs, and Miss Giddy no more.
You remember, I am sure, when us knew each other by no other Names.
Indeed you gave me the latter Appellation with too just Cause.
I have since experienced how much I deserved the latter Appellation.
You, my Sophia, was always my Superior in every thing, and I heartily hope you will be so in your Fortune.
I shall never forget the wise and matronly Advice you once gave me when I lamented being disappointed of a Ball, though you could not be then fourteen Years old.
-- O my Sophy, how blessed must have been my Situation, when I could think such a Disappointment a Misfortune and when indeed it was the greatest I had ever known.'
'And yet, my dear Harriet,' answered Sophia it was then a serious Matter with my dear Harriet.
Comfort my dear Harriet therefore with thinking, that whatever you now lament may hereafter appear as triffling and contemptible as a Ball would at this Time.'
'Alas, my Sophia,' replied the young Lady, 'you yourself will think otherwise of my present Situation; for greatly must that tender Heart be altered if my Misfortunes do not draw many a Sigh, nay many a Tear, from the young Lady.
The Knowledge of this should perhaps deter me from relating what I am convinced will so much affect you.'
-- Here Sophia stopped, till at the repeated Entreaties o^ Sophia, Sophia proceeded.
'Though you must have heard much of my Marriage, yet as Matters may probably have been mis represented, I will set out from the very Commencement of my unfortunate Acquaintance with my Husband; which was at Bath, soon after you' left my Aunt, and returned home to her Father.
'Among the gay young Fellows, who were at this Season at Bath, Sophia was one.
Sophia was handsome, degage, extremely gallant, and in Sophia Dress exceeded most others.
In short, my Dear, if you was unluckily to see Sophia now, I could describe Sophia no better than by telling you Sophia was the very Reverse of every Thing which Sophia is: For Sophia has rusticated Sophia so long, that Sophia is become an absolute wild Irishman.
But to proceed in my Story; the Qualifications which Sophia then possessed so well recommended Sophia, that though the People of Quality at this Time lived separate from the rest of the Company, and excluded the People of Quality at this Time from all the People of Quality at this Time Parties, Sophia found Means to gain Admittance.
It was perhaps no easy Matter to avoid Sophia; for Sophia required very little or no Invitation; and as being handsome and genteel, Sophia found it no difficult Matter to ingratiate Sophia with many young Ladies, so, Sophia having frequently drawn Sophia Sword, the Men did not care publicly to affront Sophia.
Had it not been for some such Reason, I believe Sophia would have been soon expelled by Sophia own Sex; for surely Sophia had no strict Title to be preferred to the English Gentry; nor did the English Gentry seem inclined to show Sophia any extraordinary Favor.
They all abused Sophia behind Sophia Back, which might probably proceed from Envy; for Sophia was well received,' and very particularly distinguished by the Women.
'My Aunt, though no Person of Quality herself, as My Aunt had always lived about the Court, was enrolled in that Party: For by whatever Means you get into the Polite Circle, when you are once there, it is sufficient Merit for you that you are there.
This Observation, young as you was, you could scarce avoid making from my Aunt, who was free, or reserved, with all People, just as all People had more o^' less of this Merit.
'And this Merit, I believe, it was, which principally recommended Sophia to Sophia Favor.
In which Sophia so well succeeded, that Sophia was always one of Sophia private Parties.
Nor was h^ backward in returning such Distinction; for Sophia soon grew so very particular in Sophia Behavior to Sophia, tha^ the Scandal Club first began to take Notice of the Scandal Club and the better disposed Persons made a Match between Persons.
For my own Part, I confess, I made no Doubt but that Sophia Designs were strictly honorable, as the Phrase is; that is, to rob a Lady of Sophia Fortune by Way of Marriage.
My Aunt was, conceived, neither young enough nor handsome enough, to attract much wicked Inclination; but' My Aunt had matrimonial Charms in great Abundance.
'I was the more confirmed in this Opinion from the extraordinary Respect which Sophia showed to my self from the first Moment of my unfortunate Acquaintance.
This I understood as an attempt to lessen, if possible that Disinclination which my Interest might be supposed to give me toward the Match; and I know no but in some Measure some Measure had that Effect: for as I was well contented with your Fortune, and of all People the least a Slave to interested Views, so could not be violently the Enemy of a Man with whose Behavior to me I was greatly pleased; and the more so, as I was the only Object of such Respect; for he behaved at the same Time to many' Women of Quality without any Respect at all.
'Agreeable as this was to me, he soon changed i^ into another Kind of Behavior, which was perhaps more so.
he now put on much Softness and Tenderness, and languished and sighed abundantly.
At Times indeed, whether from Art or Nature will not determine, he gave he usual loose to Gaye ty and Mirth; but this was always in general Company, and with other Women; for even in a Country Dance, when he was not my Partner, he became grave and put on the softest Look imaginable, the Moment he approached me.
Indeed he was in all Things so very particular toward me, that I must have been blind not to have discovered it.
And, and, and -- 'And you was more pleased still, my dear Harriet,SophiaSophia; 'you need not be ashamed, added Sophia sighing, 'for sure there are irresistible Charms in Tenderness, which too many Men are able to affect.'
'True,' answered Sophia Cousin, 'Men who in all other Instances want common 'Sense, are very Machiavels in the Art of Loving.
I wish I did not know an Instance.
-- Well, Scandal now began to be as busy with me as Scandal had before been with My Aunt, and some good Ladies did not scruple to affirm that Mr. Fitzpatrick had an Intrigue with us both.'
'But what may seem astonishing; My Aunt My Aunt never saw, nor in the least seemed to suspect that which was visible enough, I believe, from both our Behaviors.
One would indeed think, that Love quite puts out the Eyes of an old Woman.
In Fact, they so greedily swallow the Addresses which are made to they, that like an outrageous Glutton, they are not at Leisure to observe what passes amongst others at the same Table.
This I have observed in more Cases than my own; and This was so strongly verified by My Aunt, that though My Aunt often found us together at My Aunt Return from the Pump, the least: canting Word of Word of, pretending Impatience at My Aunt Absence effectually smothered all Suspicion.
One Artifice succeeded with My Aunt to Admiration.
This was Word of treating me like a little Child, and never calling me by any other Name in My Aunt Presence, but that of pretty Miss.
This indeed did Word of some Disservice with your humble Servant; but I soon saw through it, especially as in her Absence Word of behaved to me, as I have said, in a different Manner.
However, if I was not greatly disobliged by a Conduct of which I had discovered the Design, I smarted very severely for the Design: For My Aunt really conceived me to be what My Aunt Lover (as My Aunt thought Word of) called me, and treated me, in all Respects, as a perfect Infant.
To say the Truth, I wonder My Aunt had not insisted on my again wearing Leading-strings.'
'At last, my Lover (for so he was) thought proper, in a most solemn Manner, to disclose a Secret which I had known long before.
he now placed all the Love which he had pretended to My Aunt to my Account.
he lamented the Encouragement My Aunt had given he in very pathetic Terms, and made a high Merit of the tedious Hours, in which he had undergone My Aunt Conversation.
-- What shall I tell you, Sophia?
-- Then I will confess the Truth.
I was pleased with Man.
I was pleased with my Conquest.
To rival My Aunt delighted me; to rival so many other Women charmed me.
In short, I am afraid, I did not behave as I should do, even upon the very first Declaration.
-- I wish I did not almost give he positive Encouragement before we parted.'
'The Bath now talked loudly, I might almost say, roared against me.
Several young Women affected to shun my Acquaintance, not so much, perhaps, from any real Suspicion, as from a Desire of banishing me from a Company, in which I too much engrossed Several young Women .
And here I cannot omit expressing my Gratitude to the Kindness intended me by Mr. Nash; who took me one Day aside, and gave me Advice, which if I had followed, I had been a happy Woman.'
"Child," says Child, 'I am sorry to see the Familiarity which subsists between you and a Fellow who is altogether unworthy of you, and I am afraid will prove your Ruin.
As for your old stinking Aunt, if it was to be no Injury to you, and my pretty Sophia Western (I assure you I repeat the Fellow Words) I should be heartily glad, that the Fellow was in Possession of all that belongs to the Fellow.
I never advise old Women: For if old Women take it into old Women Heads to go to the Devil, it is no more possible, than worth while to keep them from the Devil.
Innocence and Youth and Beauty are worthy a better Fate, and I would save them from the Devil Clutches.
Let me advise you therefore, dear Child; never suffer the Fellow the Fellow to be particular with dear Child again."
' -- Many more Things the Fellow said to the Fellow, which I have now forgotton, and indeed I attended very little to them at that Time: For Inclination contradicted all the Fellow said, and besides I could not be persuaded, that Women of Quality would condescend to Familiarity with such a Person as the Fellow described.'
'But I am afraid, my Dear, I shall tire you with a Detail of so many minute Circumstances.
To be concise therefore, imagine me married; imagine me with my Husband, at the Feet of My Aunt, and then imagine the maddest Woman in Bedlam in a raving Fit, and your Imagination will suggest to dear Child no more than what really happened.'
'The very next Day, My Aunt left the Place, partly to avoid seeing Mr. Fitzpatrick or my self, and as much perhaps to avoid seeing any one else; for, though I am told My Aunt has since denied every thing stoutly, I believe My Aunt was then a little confounded at My Aunt Disappointment.
Since that Time, I have written to My Aunt many Letters; but never could obtain an Answer, which I must own sits somewhat the heavier, as My Aunt herself was, though undesignedly, the Occasion of all my Sufferings: For had it not been under the Color of paying Mr. Fitzpatrick Addresses to My Aunt, Mr. Fitzpatrick would never have found sufficient Opportunities to have engaged my Heart, which, in other Circumstances, I still flatter Mr. Fitzpatrick would not have been an easy Conquest to such a Person.
Indeed, I believe, I should not have erred so grossly in my Choice, if I had relied on my own Judgment; but I trusted totally to the Opinion of others, and very foolishly took this Merit for granted, whom I saw so universally well received by Several young Women.
What is the Reason, my Dear, that we who have Understandings equal to the wisest and greatest of the other Sex so often make Choice of the silliest Fellows for Companions and Favorites?
It raises my Indignation to the highest Pitch, to reflect on the Numbers of Women of Sense who have been undone by Fools.'
Here she paused a Moment; but Sophia making no Answer, Sophia proceeded as in the next Chapter.
CHAP.
V. In which the History of Mr. Fitzpatrick is continued.
'WE remained at The Bath no longer than a Fortnight after WE Wedding: For as to any Reconciliation with My Aunt, there were no Hopes; and of my Fortune, not one Farthing could be touched till I was at Age, of which I now wanted more than two Years.
my Husband therefore was resolved to set out for Ireland; against which I remonstrated very earnestly, and insisted on a Promise which my Husband had made me before WE Marriage, that I should never take this Journey against my Consent; and indeed I never intended to consent to this Journey; nor will any Body, I believe, blame me for that Resolution; but this, however, I never mentioned to my Husband, and petitioned only for the Reprieve of a Month; but my Husband had fixed the Day, and to the Day my Husband obstinately adhered.'
'The Evening before WE Departure, as WE were disputing this Point with great Eagerness on both Sides, my Husband started suddenly from my Husband Chair, and left me abruptly, saying, my Husband was going to the Rooms.
my Husband was hardly out of the House, when I saw a Paper lying on the Floor, which, I suppose, my Husband had carelessly pulled from my Husband Pocket, together with my Husband Handkerchief.
a Paper I took up, and finding a Paper to be a Letter, I made no Scruple to open and read a Paper, and indeed I read a Paper so often, that I can repeat a Paper to you almost Word for Word.
This then was my Husband a Letter.'
To Mr. Fitzpatrick.
my Husband, Mr. Fitzpatrick received, and am surprised you should use me in this Manner, as have never seen any of your Cash, unless for one Linsey Woolsey Coat, and your Bill now is upwards of 150l.
Consider, my Husband, how often you have fobbed me off with your being shortly to be married to this Lady, and the other Lady; but I can neither live on Hopes or Promises, nor will my Woollen-draper take any such in Payment.
You tell me you are secure of having either the Aunt or the Niece, and that you might have married My Aunt before this, whose Jointure you say is immense, but that you prefer the Niece on account of the Niece ready Money.
my Husband, take a Fool's Advice for once, and marry the first you can get.
You will pardon my offering a Fool's Advice, as you know I sincerely wish you well.
Shall draw on you per next Post, in favor of Messieurs John Drugget and Company, at fourteen Days, which doubt not your honoring and am,  Sir, Your humble Servant, SAM.
COSGRAVE.
'This was the Letter Word for Word.
Guess, my dear Girl, guess how this Letter affected me.
You prefer the Niece on account of her ready Money!
If every one of these Words had been a Dagger, I could with Pleasure have stabbed every one of these Words had been a Dagger into every one of these Words had been a Dagger Heart; but I will not recount my frantic Behavior on the Occasion.
I had pretty well spent my Tears before every one of these Words had been a Dagger return home; but sufficient Remains of every one of these Words had been a Dagger appeared in my swollen Eyes.
every one of these Words had been a Dagger threw every one of these Words had been a Dagger sullenly into every one of these Words had been a Dagger , and for a long Time we were both silent.
At length in a haughty Tone, every one of these Words had been a Dagger said, "I hope, Madam, your Servants have packed up all your Things; for the Coach will be ready by Six in the Morning."
My Patience was totally subdued by this Provocation, and I answered, No, my Husband, there is a Letter still remains unpacked, and then throwing it on the Table, I fell to upbraiding every one of these Words had been a Dagger with the most bitter Language I could invent.'
'Whether Guilt, or Shame, or Prudence, restrained every one of these Words had been a Dagger, I cannot say; but though every one of these Words had been a Dagger is the most passionate of Men, every one of these Words had been a Dagger exerted no Rage on the Occasion.
every one of these Words had been a Dagger endeavored on the contrary to pacify me by the most gentle Means.
every one of these Words had been a Dagger swore the Phrase in a Letter to which I principally objected was not every one of these Words had been a Dagger, nor had every one of these Words had been a Dagger ever written any such.
every one of these Words had been a Dagger owned indeed the having mentioned every one of these Words had been a Dagger Marriage and that Preference which every one of these Words had been a Dagger had given to myself, but denied with many Oaths the having assigned any such Reason.
And every one of these Words had been a Dagger excused the having mentioned any such Matter at all, on account of the Straits every one of these Words had been a Dagger was in for Money, arising, every one of these Words had been a Dagger said, from every one of these Words had been a Dagger having too long neglected every one of these Words had been a Dagger Estate in Ireland.
And this, every one of these Words had been a Dagger said, which every one of these Words had been a Dagger could not bear to discover to every one of these Words had been a Dagger, was the only Reason of every one of these Words had been a Dagger having so strenuously insisted on JourneyJourney.
every one of these Words had been a Dagger then used several endearing Expressions, and concluded by a very fond Caress, and many violent Protestations of Love.'
'There was one Circumstance, which, though every one of these Words had been a Dagger did not appeal to it, had much Weight with myself in every one of these Words had been a Dagger Favor, and that was the Word Jointure in the Taylor's Letter, whereas My Aunt never had been married, and this Mr. Fizpatrick well knew.
-- As I imagined therefore that the Fellow must have inserted this of the Fellow own Head, or from Hearsay, I persuaded myself the Fellow might have ventured likewise on that odious Line on no better Authority.
What Reasoning was this, my Dear?
Was I not an Advocate rather than a Judge?
-- But why do I mention such a Circumstance as this, or appeal to it for the Justification of my Forgiveness!
-- In short, had the Fellow been guilty of twenty Times as much, half the Tenderness and Fondness which the Fellow used, would have prevailed on myself to have forgiven the Fellow.
I now made no farther Objections to our setting out, which our did the next Morning, and in a little more than a Week arrived at the Seat of Mr.
Fitzpatrick.'
'Your Curiosity will excuse me from relating any Occurrences which past during our : For it would indeed be highly disagreeable to travel it over again, and no less so to you to travel it over with myself.'
'the Seat of Mr. Fitzpatrick then, is an ancient Mansion House; If I was in one of those merry Humors, in which you have so often seen me, I could describe it to you ridiculously enough.
it looked as if it had been formerly inhabited by a Gentleman.
Here was Room enough, and not the less Room on account of the Furniture: For indeed there was very little in the Furniture.
An old Woman who seemed coeval with the Building, and greatly resembled her whom Chamont mentions in the Orphan, received our at the Gate, and in a Howl scarce human, and to me unintelligible, welcomed her Master home.
In short, the whole Scene was so gloomy and melancholy, that the whole Scene threw my Spirits into the lowest Dejection; which my Husband discerning, instead of relieving, increased, by two or three malicious Observations.
There are good Houses, Madam," says my Husband, "^ you find, in other Places besides England; b^ perhaps you had rather be in a dirty Lodging ^ Bath.'
'Happy, my Dear, is the Woman, who in an^ State of Life, has a cheerful good-natured Companion to support and comfort her; but why do reflect on happy Situations only to aggravate m^ own Misery!
My Companion, far from clearing up the Gloom of Solitude, soon convinced me that I must have been wretched with my Husband in an^ Place, and in any Condition.
In a Word, my Husband wa^ a surly Fellow, a Character you have perhaps never seen: For indeed no Woman ever sees it exemplified, but in a Father, a Brother, or a Husband and though you have a Father, a Father, a Brother, or a Husband is not of that Character.
the Fellow had formerly appeared to me the very Reverse, and so the Fellow did still t^ every other Person.
Good Heaven!
how is it possible for a Man to maintain a constant Lie in h^ Appearance abroad and in Company, and to conten^ himself with showing disagreeable Truth only a home?
Here, my Dear, they make they Amends for the uneasy Restraint which they put o^ they Tempers in the World; for I have observe^ the more merry and gay, and good-humoured m^ my Husband has at any Time been in Company, the more sullen and morose my Husband was sure to be at ou^ next private Meeting.
How shall I describe hi^ Barbarity?
To my Fondness my Husband was cold and insible.
My little comical Ways, which you, m^ Sophy, and which others have called so agreeable my Husband treated with Contempt.
In my most seriou^ Moments my Husband sung and whistled; and whenever was thoroughly dejected and miserable, my Husband was angry, and abused me: for though my Husband was never pleased with my good Humor, nor ascribed he was never pleased with my good Humor to my Satisfaction in my Husband; yet my low Spirits always of fended my Husband, and those my Husband imputed to my Repentance of having (as my Husband said) married an Irishman.'
'You will easily conceive, my dear Graveairs; (I ask your Pardon, I really forgot my Husband) that when a Woman makes an imprudent Match in the Sense of the World; that is, when a Woman is not an arrant Prostitute to pecuniary Interest, a Woman must necessarily have some Inclination and Affection for a Woman Man.
You will as easily believe that this Affection may possibly be lessened; nay, I do assure you, Contempt will wholly eradicate this Affection may possibly be lessened.
Contempt I now began to entertain for my Husband, whom I now discover to be -- I must use the Expression -- an errant Blockhead.
Perhaps you will wonder I did not make this Discovery long before; but Women will suggest a thousand Excuses to Women for the Folly of those Women like: Besides, give me Leave to tell you, this Discovery requires a most penetrating Eye to discern a Fool through the Disguises of Gayety and Good-breeding.'
'It will be easily imagined, that when I once despised my Husband, as I confess to you I soon did, I must consequently dislike my Husband Company; and indeed I had the Happiness of being very little troubled with his Company; for our House was now most elegantly furnished, our Cellars well stocked, and Dogs and Horses provided in great Abundance.
As my Gentleman therefore entertained his Neighbors with great Hospitality, so Gentleman Neighbors resorted to Gentleman with great Alacrity; and Sports and Drinking consumed so much of Gentleman Time, that a small Part of Gentleman Conversation, that is to say, of Gentleman Ill-humours, fell to my Share.'
'Happy would it have been for Happy, if I could as easily have avoided all other disagreeable Company; but alas!
I was confined to some which constantly tormented me; and the more, as I saw no Prospect of being relieved from some which constantly tormented me.
some which constantly tormented me were my own racking Thoughts, which plagued and in a Manner haunted me Night and Day.
I this Situation I past through a Scene, the Horror of which can neither be painted nor imagined Think, my Dear, figure, if you can, to yourself what I must have undergone.
I became a Mother by the Man I scorned, hated, and detested.
I we^^ through all the Agonies and Miseries of a Lying-i^ (ten Times more painful in such a Circumstance than the worst Labor can be, when one endures for a Man one loves,) in a Desert, or rather indeed a Scene of Riot and Revel, without a Friend, without a Companion, or without any of those agreeable Circumstances which often alleviate, and perhaps sometimes more than compensate the Sufferings of our Sex at this Season.'

In which the Mistake of the Landlord throws Sophia into a dreadful Consternation.
MRS. Mr. Fitzpatrick was proceeding in Sophia Narrative, when Sophia was interrupted by the Entrance of Dinner, greatly to the Concern of Sophia: For the Misfortunes of Sophia had raised Sophia Anxiety and left Sophia no Appetite, but what Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick was to satisfy by Mr. Fitzpatrick Relation.
the Landlord now attended with a Plate under hi^ Arm, and with the same Respect in the Landlord Countenance and Address, which the Landlord would have put on, had the Ladies arrived in a Coach and Six.
a Friend seemed less affected with a Friend own Misfortunes than was a Friend Cousin: For the former eat very heartily, whereas the latter could hardl^ swallow a Morsel.
Sophia likewise showed more Concern and Sorrow in Sophia Countenance than appeared in the other Lady; who having observed the^ Symptoms in Sophia , begged Sophia to be comforted saying, 'Perhaps all may yet end better than either you or I expect.
the Landlord the Landlord thought the Landlord had now an Opportunity ^o open the Landlord Mouth, and was resolved not to omit an Opportunity.
I am sorry, Madam,' cries the Landlord, 'that your Ladyship cannot eat; for to be sure you must be hungry after so long fasting.
I hope your Ladyship is not uneasy at any Thing: For as Sophia there says, all may end better than any body expects.
A a Gentleman who was here just now, brought excellent News, and perhaps some Folks who have given other Folks the slip may get to London before other Folks are overtaken, and if other Folks do, I make no Doubt, but other Folks will find People who will be very ready to receive other Folks.
All Persons under the Apprehension of Danger, ^onvert whatever All Persons under the Apprehension of Danger see and hear into the Objects of that Apprehension.
Sophia therefore immediately ^oncluded from the foregoing Speech, that Sophia was ^nown and pursued by Sophia Father.
Sophia was now ^^ruck with the utmost Consternation, and for a few ^linutes deprived of the Power of Speech; which ^e no sooner recovered, than Sophia desired the Land^ord to send the Land^ord Servants out of the Room, and then ^ddressing Sophia to the Land^ord, said; 'I perceive, the Land^ord, you know who we are; but I beseech you; -- nay, I am convinced, if you have any Compassion or Goodness, you will not betray we.
'I betray your Ladyship,' quoth the Landlord!
No; (and then the Landlord swore several hearty Oaths) 'I would sooner be cut in ten thousand Pieces.
I hate all Treachery.
I!
I never betrayed any one in my Life yet, and I am sure I shall not begin with so sweet a Lady as your Ladyship.
All the World would very much blame me if I should, since it will be in your Ladyship's Power so shortly to reward me.
Sophia can Witness for Sophia, I knew Wife can Witness Ladyship the Moment you came into our House: I said it was your Honor, before I lifted you from your Horse, and I shall carry the Bruises I got in your Ladyship's Service to the Grave; but what signified that, as long as I saved your Ladyship.
To be sure some People this Morning would have thought of getting a Reward; but no such* Thought ever entered into my Head.
I would sooner starve than take any Reward for betraying your Ladyship.'
'I promise you, Sophia, says Sophia, if it be ever in my Power to reward you, you shall not lose by your Generosity.'
'Alack-a-day, Sophia!'
answered the Landlord, in your Ladyship's Power!
Heaven put it as much into your Will.
I am only afraid your Honor will forget such a poor Man as an Innkeeper; but if your Ladyship should not; I hope you will remember what Reward I refused -- refused ^ that is I would have refused, and to be sure it may be called refusing; for I might have had it certainly, and to be sure you might have been in some Houses; -- but for my Part, I would not methinks for the World have your Lady-ship wrong me so much, as to imagine I ever thought of betraying you, even before I heard the good News.
What excellent News pray?'
says Sophia, somewhat eagerly.'
'Hath not your Ladyship heard your Ladyship then?'
cries the Landlord, nay, like enough: For I heard your Ladyship only a few Minutes ago; and if I had never heard it, may the Devil fly away with me this Instant, if I would have betrayed your Honor; no, if I would, may I -- Here Honor subjoined several dreadful Execrations which Sophia at last interrupted, and begged to know what Honor meant by excellent News.'
-- Honor was going to answer, when your Honor came running into the Room, all pale and breathless, and cried out, 'Sophia, we are all undone, all ruined, all are come, all are come!'
These Words almost froze up the ^^ood of Sophia; but Mr. Fitzpatrick asked Ho^^ur, who are come?
-- 'Who?
answered Mr. Fitzpatrick, why the French; several hundred thousands of them are landed, and we shall be all murdered and ravished.'
As a Miser, who has in some well built City a Cottage value twenty Shillings, when at a Distance ^e is alarmed with the News of a Fire, turns pale and ^embles at his Loss; but when his finds the beau^^ful Palaces only are burnt, and his own Cottage retains safe, his comes instantly to his and smiles this good Fortune: Or as (for we dislike something ^^ the former Simile) the tender Mother, when ter^^fied with the Apprehension that Mr. Fitzpatrick darling Boy is towned, is struck senseless and almost dead with Consternation; but when Mr. Fitzpatrick is told that little Master ^ safe, and the Victory only with twelve hundred ^ave Men gone to the Bottom, Life and Sense again ^eturn, maternal Fondness enjoys the sudden Relief from all the sudden Relief Fears, and the general Benevolence which a another Time would have deeply felt the dreadful ^^astrophe, lies fast asleep in Mr. Fitzpatrick Mind.
So Sophia, than whom none was more capable of ^^derly feeling the general Calamity of Mr. Fitzpatrick Country, ^^nd such immediate Satisfaction from the Relief ^f those Terrors Mr. Fitzpatrick had of being overtaken by Mr. Fitzpatrick ^^ther, that the Arrival of the French scarce made my Impression on Mr. Fitzpatrick.
Mr. Fitzpatrick gently chid Mr. Fitzpatrick Maid ^^ the Fright into which Mr. Fitzpatrick had thrown Mr. Fitzpatrick; and (...), 'Mr.
Fitzpatrick was glad it was no worse; for that Mr. Fitzpatrick had feared somebody else was come.'
'Ay, ay,' quoth the Landlord smiling, 'your Ladyship knows better things; your Ladyship knows the French are our very best Friends, and come over hither only for our good.
the French are the People who are to make old England flourish again.
I warrant your Honor Honor thought the Duke was coming ^ and that was enough to put your Ladyship into a Fright.
I was going to tell your Ladyship the News.
-- your Ladyship the News Honor's Majesty, Heaven bless your Ladyship the News, has given the Duke the slip; and is marching as fast as your Ladyship the News can to London, and ten thousand the French are landed to join your Ladyship the News on the Road.'
Sophia was not greatly pleased with excellent News, nor with the Gentleman who related excellent News; but as Sophia still imagined your Ladyship the News knew Sophia (for Sophia could not possibly have any Suspicion of the real Truth) Sophia durst no show any Dislike.
And now the Landlord, having removed the Cloth from the Table, withdrew; but at your Ladyship the News Departure frequently repeated your Ladyship the News Hopes of being remembered hereafter.
The Mind of Sophia was not at all easy under the Supposition of being known at our House; for Sophia still applied to Sophia many Things which the Landlord had addressed to Jenny Cameron; Sophia therefore ordered Sophia Maid to pump out of your Ladyship the News by what Means your Ladyship the News had become acquainted with Sophia Person, and who had offered your Ladyship the News the Reward for betraying Sophia; Sophia likewise ordered the Horses to be in Readiness by four in the Morning, at which Hour Mrs. Fitzpatrick promised to bear Sophia Company, and then composing Sophia as well as Sophia could, Sophia desired that a Friend to continue Sophia Story.

VII.
In which Mr. Fitzpatrick concludes Mr. Fitzpatrick History.
WHILE your Honor, in Pursuance of the Commands of your Honor Mistress, ordered a Bowl of Punch, and invited my Landlord and Landlay to partake of it, Mr. Fitzpatrick thus went on with Mr. Fitzpatrick Relation.
'Most of the Officers who were quartered at a Town in our Neighborhood were of my Husband's Acquaintance.
Among these was a Lieutenant, a very pretty Sort of Man, and who was married to a Woman who was so agreeable both in Mr. Fitzpatrick Temper and Conversation, that from our first knowing each other, which was soon after my Lying-in, our were almost inseparable Companions; for I had this good Fortune to make Mr. Fitzpatrick equally agreeable to Mr.
Fitzpatrick.'
'The Lieutenant who was neither a Sot nor a Sportsman, was frequently of our Parties; indeed he was very little with my Husband, and no more than good-Breeding constrained he to be, as he lived almost constantly at our .
my Husband often expressed much dissatisfaction at the Lieutenant's preferring her Company to the Lieutenant; the Lieutenant was very angry with my Husband on that Account, and gave me many a hearty Curse for drawing away the Lieutenant Companions; saying, "I ought to be d -- ned for having spoiled one of the prettiest Fellows in the World, by making a Milk-sop of my Husband.'
'You will be mistaken, Sophia, if you imagine that the Anger of my Husband arose from my depriving my Husband of his Companion; for the Lieutenant was not a Person with whose Society a Fool could be pleased; and if I should admit the Possibility of this, so little Right had my Husband to place the Loss of my Husband Companion to my Husband, that I am convinced it was my Conversation alone which induced my Husband ever to come to our House.
No, Child, it was Envy, the worst and most rancorous Kind of Envy, the Envy of Superiority of Understanding.
The Wretch could not bear to see my Conversation preferred to The Wretch, by a Man of whom The Wretch could not entertain the least Jealousy.
O my dear Sophy, you are a Woman of Sense; if you marry a Man, as is most probable you will, of less Capacity than yourself, make frequent Trials of The Wretch Temper before Marriage, and see whether The Wretch can bear to submit to such a Superiority.
-- Promise me Sophy, you will take this Advice; for you will hereafter find this Advice Importance.'
'It is very likely I shall never marry at all,' answered Sophia; 'I think, at least, I shall never marry a Man in whose Understanding I see any Defects before Marriage; and I promise you I would rather give up my own, than see any such afterward.'
-- 'Give up your Understanding!'
replied Mr. Fitzpatrick, 'Oh fie, Child, I will not believe so meanly of Mr. Fitzpatrick.
Every thing else I might myself be brought to give up; but never this.
Nature would not have allotted this Superiority to the Wife in so many Instances, if the Wife intended we should have all surrendered it to my Husband.
This indeed Men of Sense never expect of us; of which the Lieutenant I have just mentioned was one notable Example; for though the Lieutenant I have just mentioned had a very good Understanding, the Lieutenant I have just mentioned always acknowledged (as was really true) that the Lieutenant I have just mentioned the Wife had a better.
And this, perhaps, was one Reason of the Hatred my Tyrant bore my Tyrant.'
'Before my Tyrant would be so governed by a Wife,' my Tyrant said, especially such an ugly B -- (for indeed my Tyrant was not a regular Beauty, but very agreeable, and extremely genteel) my Tyrant would see all the Women upon Earth at the Devil, which was a very usual Phrase with my Tyrant.'
my Tyrant said, 'my Tyrant wondered what I could see in my Tyrant to be so charmed with my Tyrant : since this Woman, says my Tyrant, 'hath come among us, there is an End of your beloved Reading, which you pretended to like so much, that you could not afford Time to return the Visits of the Ladies, in this Country; and I must confess I had been guilty of a little Rudeness this Way; for the Ladies there are at least no better than the mere Country Ladies here, and I think, I need make no other Excuse to you for declining any Intimacy with the Ladies.'
'This Correspondence however continued a whole Year, even all the while the Lieutenant was quartered in a Town in our Neighborhood; for which I was contented to pay the Tax of being constantly abused in the Manner abovementioned by my Husband; I mean when my Husband was at home; for my Husband was frequently absent a Month at a Time at Dublin, and once made a Journey of two Months to London; in all which Journeys I thought it a very singular Happiness that my Husband never once desired my Company; nay, by my Husband frequent Censures on Men who could not travel, as my Husband phrased it, without a Wife tied up to their Tail, my Husband sufficiently intimated that had I been never so desirous of accompanying my Husband, my Wishes would have been in vain; but, Heaven knows, such Wishes were very far from my Thoughts.'
'At length my Friend was removed from my Friend, and I was again left to my Solitude, to the tormenting Conversation with my own Reflections, and to apply to Books for my only Comfort.
I now read almost all Day long.
-- How many Books do you think I read in three Months?'
'I cannot guess, indeed, Cousin,' answered Sophia.
-- 'Perhaps half a Score!'
'Half a Score!
half a thousand, Child,' answered the other.
'I read a good deal in Daniel's English History of France; a great deal in Plutarch's Lives; the Atalantis, Pope's Homer, Dryden's Plays, Chillingworth, the Countess.
D' Anois, and Lock's Human Understanding.'
'During this Interval I wrote three very supplicating, and, I thought, moving Letters to my Aunt; but as I received no Answer to any of Letters, my Disdain would not suffer me to continue my Application.'
-- Here my Aunt stopped, and looking earnestly at Sophia, said, 'Methinks my Dear, I read something in your Eyes which reproaches me of a Neglect in another Place, where I should have met with a kinder Return.'
'Indeed, dear Harriet,' answered Sophia, your Story is an Apology for any Neglect; but indeed I feel that I have been guilty of a Remissness, without so good an Excuse.
-- Yet pray proceed; for I long, though I tremble, to hear the End.'
Thus then Mr. Fitzpatrick resumed Mr. Fitzpatrick Narrative.
'my Husband now took a second Journey to England, where my Husband continued upwards of three Months.
During the greater Part of this Time, I led a Life which nothing but having led a worse, could make me think tolerable; for perfect Solitude can never be reconciled to a social Mind, like mine, but when it relieves you from the Company of those you hate.
What added to my Wretchedness, was the Loss of my little Infant: Not that I pretend to have had for it that extravagant Tenderness of which I believe I might have been capable under other Circumstances; but I resolved, in every Instance, to discharge the Duty of the tenderest Mother, and this Care prevented me from feeling the Weight of that, heaviest of all Things, when it can be at all said to lie heavy on our Hands.'
'I had spent full ten Weeks almost entirely by myself, having seen no body all that Time, except my Servants, and a very few Visitors, when a young Lady, a Relation of my Husband, came from a distant Part of Ireland to visit me.
She had staid once before a Week at our House, and I then gave She a pressing Invitation to return; for She was a very agreeable Woman, and had improved good natural Parts by a proper Education.
Indeed She was to myself a most welcome Guest.'
'A few Days after She Arrival, perceiving me in very low Spirits, without enquiring the Cause, which indeed She very well knew, She fell to compassionating my Case.
She said, 'Tho' Politeness had prevented me from complaining of my Husband's Behavior to my Husband Relations, yet they all were very sensible of it, and felt great Concern upon that Account; but none more than She;" and after some general Discourse on this Head, which I own I could not forbear Countenancing; at last, after much previous Precaution, and enjoined Concealment, She communicated to myself, as a profound Secret -- that my Husband kept a Mistress.'
'You will certainly imagine, I heard this News with the utmost Insensibility -- Upon my Word, if you do, your Imagination will mislead you.
Contempt had not so kept down my Anger to my Husband; but that Hatred rose again on this occasion.
What can be the Reason of this?
Are we so abominably selfish, that we can be concerned at others having the Possession even of what we despise?
Or are we not rather abominably vain, and is not this the greatest Injury done to we Vanity?
What think you, Sophia?'
'I don't know, indeed,' answered Sophia, 'I have never troubled myself with any of these deep Contemplations; but I think She did very ill in communicating to Sophia such a Secret.'
'And yet, my Dear, this Conduct is natural,' replied Mr. Fitzpatrick; 'and when you have seen and read as much as myself, you will acknowledge it to be so.'
'I am sorry to hear it is natural,' returned Sophia; for I want neither Reading nor Experience, to convince me, that it is very dishonorable and very illnatur'd: Nay, it is surely as ill-bred to tell a Husband or Wife of the Faults of each other, as to tell them of them own.'
'Well,' continued Mrs. Fitzpatrick, 'my Husband at last returned; and if I am thoroughly acquainted with my own Thoughts, I hated I am thoroughly acquainted with my own Thoughts now more than ever; but I despised I am thoroughly acquainted with my own Thoughts rather less: For certainly nothing so much weakens our Contempt, as an Injury done to our Pride or our .'
'I am thoroughly acquainted with my own Thoughts now assumed a Carriage to me, so very different from what I am thoroughly acquainted with my own Thoughts had lately worn, and so nearly resembling I am thoroughly acquainted with my own Thoughts the first Week of our Marriage, that had I now had any Spark of Love remaining, I am thoroughly acquainted with my own Thoughts might, possibly, have rekindled my Fondness for I am thoroughly acquainted with my own Thoughts.
But though Hatred may succeed to Contempt, and may, perhaps, get the better of it, Love, I believe, cannot.
The Truth is, the Passion of Love is too restless to remain conconted, without the Gratification which it receives from it Object; and one can no more be inclined to love without loving, than we can have Eyes without seeing.
When a my Husband, therefore, ceases to be the Object of this Passion, it is most probable some other Man -- I say, my dear, if a Husband grows indifferent to you -- if you once come to despise a Husband -- I say, -- that is, -- if you have the Passion of Love in you -- Lud!
I have bewildered myself so -- but one is apt, in these abstracted Considerations, to lose the Concatenation of Ideas, as Mr.
Lock says.
-- In short the Truth is -- In short, I scarce know what it is; but, as I was saying, my Husband returned, and my Husband's Behavior, at first, greatly surprised me; but my Husband soon acquainted me with the Motive, and taught me to account for it.
In a Word, then, my Husband had spent and lost all the ready Money of my Fortune; and as my Husband could mortgage my Husband own Estate no deeper, my Husband was now desirous to supply my Husband with Cash for my Husband Extravagance, by selling a little Estate of mine, which my Husband could not do without my Assistance; and to obtain this Favor was the whole and sole Motive of all the Fondness which my Husband now put on.'
'With this I peremptorily refused to comply.
I told my Husband, and I told my Husband truly, that had I been possessed of the Indies at our Marriage, my Husband might have commanded it all: For it had been a constant Maxim with me, that where a Woman disposes of a Woman Heart, a Woman should always deposite a Woman Fortune; but as my Husband had been so kind, long ago, to restore the former into my Possession, I was resolved, likewise, to retain what little remained of the latter.'
'I will not describe to you the Passion into which these Words, and the resolute Air in which they were spoken, threw my Husband: Nor will I trouble you with the whole Scene which succeeded between our.
Out came, you may be well assured, the Story of the Mistress; and out the Story of the Mistress did come, with all the Embellishments which Anger and Disdain could bestow upon it.'
'Mr.
Fitzatrick seemed a little Thunderstruck with this, and more confused than I had seen Mr. Fitzatrick; though Mr. Fitzatrick Ideas are always confused enough, Heaven knows.
Mr. Fitzatrick did not, however, endeavor to exculpate Mr. Fitzatrick; but took a Method which almost equally confounded me.
What was this but Recrimination!
Mr. Fitzatrick affected to be jealous; -- Mr. Fitzatrick may, for ought I know, be inclined enough to Jealousy in Mr. Fitzatrick natural Temper: Nay, Mr. Fitzatrick must have had it from Nature, or the Devil must have put it into Mr. Fitzatrick Head: For I defy all the World to cast a just Aspersion on my Character: Nay, the most scandalous Tongues have never dared censure my Reputation.
My Fame, I thank Heaven, has been always as spotless as my Life; and let Falsehood itself accuse that, if Falsehood itself dare.
No, my dear Graveairs, however provoked, however ill treated, however injured in my Love, I have firmly resolved never to give the least Room for Censure on that Account.
-- And yet, my Dear, there are some People so malicious, some Tongues so venomous, that no Innocence can escape some People so malicious, some Tongues so venomous.
The most undesigned Word, the most accidental Look, the least Familiarity, or most innocent Freedom, will be misconstrued, and magnified into I know not what, by some People.
But I despise, my dear Graveairs, I despise all such Slander.
No such Malice, I assure you, ever gave me an uneasy Moment.
No, no, I promise you, I am above all that.
-- But where was I; O let me see, I told you, my Husband was jealous -- And of whom pray?
-- Why of whom but the Lieutenant I mentioned to you before.
the Lieutenant was obliged to resort above a Year and more back, to find an Object for this unaccountable Passion, if, indeed, the Lieutenant really felt any such, and was not an errant Counterfeit, in order to abuse me.'
'But I have tired you already with too many Particulars.
I will now bring my Story to a very speedy Conclusion.
In short, then, after many Scenes very unworthy to be repeated, in which my Cousin engaged so heartily on my Side, that Mr. Fitzpatrick at last turned my Cousin out of Doors; when Mr. Fitzpatrick found I was neither to be soothed nor bullied into Compliance, Mr. Fitzpatrick took a very violent Method indeed.
Perhaps you will conclude Mr. Fitzpatrick beat me; but this, though Mr. Fitzpatrick has approached very near to it, Mr. Fitzpatrick never actually did.
Mr. Fitzpatrick confined me to my Room, without suffering me to have either Pen, Ink, Paper, or Book; and a Servant every Day made my Bed, and brought me my Food.'
'When I had remained a Week under this Imprisonment, Mr. Fitzpatrick made me a Visit, and, with the Voice of a Schoolmaster, or, what is often much the same, a Tyrant, asked me, "If I would yet comply?"
I answered very stoutly, "That I would die first."
Then so you shall, and be d -- n'd," cries Mr. Fitzpatrick; for you shall never go alive out of my Room.'
'Here I remained a Fortnight longer; and, to say the Truth, my Constancy was almost subdued, and I began to think of Submission; when one Day in the Absence of my Husband, who was gone abroad for some short Time, by the greatest good Fortune in the World, an Accident happened.
-- I -- at a Time when I began to give Way to the utmost Despair -- every Thing would be excusable at such a Time -- at that very Time I received -- But it would take up an Hour to tell you all Particulars -- In one Word, then, (for I will not tire you with Circumstances) Gold, the common Key to all Padlocks, opened my Door, and set me at Liberty.'
'I now made Haste to Dublin, where I immediately procured a Passage to England; and was proceeding to Bath, in Order to throw myself into the Protection of my Aunt, or of your Father, or of any Relation who would afford it me.
my Husband overtook me last Night, at the Inn where I lay, and which you left a few Minutes before myself; but I had the good Luck to escape my Husband, and to follow you.'
'And thus, my Dear, ends my History: A tragical one, I am sure, it is to myself; but, perhaps, I ought rather to apologize to you for it Dullness.'
Sophia heaved a deep Sigh, and answered, 'Indeed, Harriet, I pity you from my Soul; -- But what could you expect?
Why, why, would you marry an Irishman?'
'Upon my Word,' replied Cousin, 'your Censure is unjust.
There are, among the Irish, Men of as much Worth and Honor, as any among the English: Nay, to speak the Truth, Generosity of Spirit is rather more common among as much Worth and Honor.
I have known some Examples there too of good Husbands: and, I believe, these are not very plenty in England.
Ask me, rather, what I could expect when I married a Fool; and I will tell you a solemn Truth; I did not know a solemn Truth to be so.'
-- 'Can no Man,' said Sophia, in a very low and altered Voice, do you think, make a bad Husband, who is not a Fool?'
'That,' answered the other, 'is too general a Negative; but none, I believe, is so likely as a Fool to prove so.
Among my Acquaintance, the silliest Fellows are the worst Husbands; and I will venture to assert, as a Fact, that a Man of Sense rarely behaves very ill to a Wife, who deserves very well.'
CHAP.
VIII.
A dreadful Alarm in the Inn, with the Arrival of an unexpected Friend of Mr. Fitzpatrick.
SOPHIA now at the Desire of Mr. Fitzpatrick Cousin, related -- not what follows, but what has gone before in this History: For which reason the Reader will, I suppose, excuse me, for not repeating it over again.
One Remark, however, I cannot forbear making on Mr. Fitzpatrick Narrative, namely, that Mr. Fitzpatrick made no more mention of Jones, from the Beginning to the End, than if there had been no such Person alive.
This I will neither endeavor to account for, nor to excuse.
Indeed, if This may be called a Kind of Dishonesty, it seems the more inexcusable, from the apparent Openness and explicit Sincerity of the other Lady.
-- But so it was.
Just as Sophia arrived at the Conclusion of Sophia Story, there arrived in the Room where the two Ladies were sitting, a Noise, not unlike, in Loudness, to that of a Pack of Hounds just let out from Hounds Kennel; nor, in Shrillness, to Cats when caterwauling; or to Screech-Owls; or, indeed, more like (for what Animal can resemble a human Voice) to those Sounds, which, in the pleasant Mansions of that Gate, which seems to derive their Kennel Name from a Duplicity of Tongues, issue from the Mouths, and sometimes from the Nostrils of those fair River Nymphs, yeleped of old the Napaeae, or the Naiades; in the vulgar Tongue translated Oyster-Wenches: For when, instead of the ancient Libations of Milk and Honey and Oil, the rich Distillation from the Juniper-Berry, or, perhaps, from Malt, has, by the early Devotion of their Votaries, been poured forth into great Abundance, should any daring Tongue, with unhallowed License profane; i. e. depreciate the delicate fat Milton Oyster, the Plaice sound and firm, the Flounder as much alive as when in the Water, the Shrimp as big as a Prawn, the fine Cod alive but a few Hours ago, or any other of the various Treasures, which those Water Deities, who fish the Sea and Rivers, have committed to the Care of the Nymphs, the angry Naiades lift up the delicate fat Milton Oyster, the Plaice sound and firm, the Flounder as much alive as when in the Water, the Shrimp as big as a Prawn, the fine Cod alive but a few Hours ago, or any other of the various Treasures, which those Water Deities, who fish the Sea and Rivers, have committed to the Care of the Nymphs, the angry Naiades immortal Voices, and the profane Wretch is struck deaf for the profane Wretch Impiety.
Such was the Noise, which now burst from one of the Rooms below; and soon the Thunder, which ^ong had rattled at a Distance, began to approach nearer and nearer, 'till, having ascended by Degrees up Stairs, ^ong at last entered the Apartment where the Ladies were.
In short, to drop all Metaphor and Figure, an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick having scolded violently below Stairs, and continued the same all the Way up, came ^n to ^n Mistress in a most outrageous Passion, crying out, 'What does your Ladyship think?
Would you imagine, that this impudent Villain, the Master of this House, has had the Impudence to tell me, nay, to stand it out to my Face, that your Ladyship is that nasty, stinking Wh -- re, (Jenny Cameron they call Jenny Cameron) that runs about the Country with the Pretender?
Nay, the lying, fancy Villain, had the Assurance to tell me, that your Ladyship had owned yourself to be so: But I have clawed the Rascal; I have left the Marks of my Nails in Rascal impudent my Face.
My Lady!'
says I, 'you fancy Scoundrel: Lady is Meat for no Pretenders.
Lady is a young Lady of as good Fashion, and Family, and Fortune, as any in Somersetshire.
Did you never hear of the great Squire Western, Sirrah?
Lady is his only Daughter; Lady is, -- and Heiress to all his great Estate.
Lady Lady to be called a nasty Scotch Wh -- re by such a Varlet -- To be sure, I wish I had knocked such a Varlet Brains out with the Punch-bowl.'
The principal Uneasiness with which Sophia was affected on this Occasion, an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick had Sophia caused, by having in Sophia Passion discovered who Sophia was.
However, as this Mistake of the Landlord sufficiently accounted for those Passages which Sophia had before mistaken, Sophia acquired some Ease on that Account; nor could Sophia upon the whole, forbear smiling.
This enraged an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and Sophia cried, 'Indeed, Madam, I did not think your Ladyship would have made a^ laughing Matter of Ladyship.
To be called Whore by such an impudent low the Rascal.
your Ladyship Ladyship may be angry with your Ladyship, for ought I know, for taking your Part, since proferred Service, they say, stinks; but to be sure I could never bear to hear a Lady of mine called Whore.
-- Nor will I bear it.
I am sure your Ladyship Ladyship is as virtuous a Lady as ever sat Foot on English Ground, and I will claw any Villain's Eyes out who dares for to offer to presume for to say the least Word to the contrary.
No body ever could say the least ill of the Character of any Lady that ever I waited upon.'
Hinc illae Lachrymae; in plain Truth, an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick had as much Love for Love as most Servants have, that is to say -- But besides this, Love Pride obliged Love to support the Character of Lady Love waited on; for Love thought Love own was in a very close Manner connected with it.
In Proportion as the Character of any Lady Love was raised, Love likewise, as Love conceived, was raised with it; and, on the contrary, Love thought the one could not be lowered without the other.
On this Subject, Reader, I must stop a Moment to tell thee a her Story.
'The famous Nell Gwynn, stepping one Day from a House where Love had made a short Visit in Love Coach, saw a great Mob assembled, and Love Footman all bloody and dirty; the Fellow being asked, by Fellow Mistress, the Reason of Fellow being in that Condition, answered, 'I have been fighting, Madam, with an impudent Rescal who called your Ladyship a Wh -- re.
'You Blockhead,' replied The famous Nell Gwynn, 'at this Rate you must fight every Day of your Life; why, you Fool, all the World knows it.'
"Do all the World?"
cries the Fellow, in a muttering Voice, after the Fellow had shut the Coach Door, 'they shall not call me a Whore's Footman for all that.'
Thus the Passion of an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick appears natural enough, even if it were to be no otherwise accounted for; but in reality, there was another Cause of an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick Anger; for which we must beg Leave to remind we Reader of a Circumstance mentioned in the above Simile.
There are indeed certain Liquors, which being applied to our Passions, or to Fire, produce Effects the very Reverse of those produced by Water, as those produced by Water serve to kindle and inflame, rather than to extinguish.
Among they serve to kindle and inflame, rather than to extinguish, the generous Liquor called Punch is one.
It was not therefore without Reason, that the learned Dr. Cheney used to call drinking Punch pouring liquid Fire down your Throat.
Now an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick had unluckily poured so much of liquid Fire down an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick Throat, that the Smoke of it began to ascend into an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick Pericranium, and blinded the Eyes of Reason which is there supposed to keep an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick Residence, while the Fire itself from the Stomach easily reached the Heart, and there inflamed the noble Passion of Pride.
So that upon the whole, we shall cease to wonder at the violent Rage of the Waiting Woman; though at first Sight we must confess the Cause seems inadequate to the Effect.
Sophia and Sophia Cousin both, did all in Sophia and her Cousin both Power to extinguish these Flames which had roared so loudly all over the House.
Sophia and her Cousin both at length prevailed; or, to carry the Metaphor one Step farther, liquid Fire having consumed all the Fuel which the Language affords, to wit, every reproachful Term in it, at last went out of liquid Fire own Accord.
But though Tranquillity was restored above Stairs, it was not so below; where my Landlady highly resenting the Injury done to the Beauty of my Landlady Husband, by the Flesh-Spades of an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick, called aloud for Revenge and Justice.
As to the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement, the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement was perfectly quiet.
Perhaps the Blood which the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement lost might have cooled the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement Anger: For the Enemy had not only applied my Landlady Nails to the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement Cheeks, but likewise my Landlady Fist to his Cheeks Nostils, which lamented the Blow with Tears of Blood in great Abundance.
To this we may add Reflections on the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement Mistake; but indeed nothing so effectually silenced the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement Resentment, as the Manner in which the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement now discovered the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement Error; for as to the Behavior of an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick, it had the more confirmed the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement in the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement Opinion: but the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement was now assured by a Person of great Figure, and who was attended by a great Equipage, that one of the Ladies was a Woman of Fashion, and the poor Man who had principally suffered in the Engagement intimate Acquaintance.
By the Orders of this Person, the Landlord now ascended, and acquainted our fair Travelers, that a great Gentleman below desired to do them an unexpected Friend of Mrs. Fitzpatrick of waiting on them.
Sophia turned pale, and trembled at this Message, though the Reader will conclude it was too civil, notwithstanding the Landlord's Blunder, to have come from Sophia Father; but Fear has the common Fault of a Justice of Peace, and is apt to conclude hastily from every slight Circumstance, without examining the Evidence on both Sides.
To ease the Reader's Curiosity, therefore, rather than his Apprehensions, we proceed to inform his, that an Irish Peer had arrived very late that Evening at the Inn in his Way to London.
his having sallied from his Supper at the Hurricane before commemorated, had seen the Attendant of Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and upon a short Enquiry was informed, that Mrs. Fitzpatrick Lady, with whom his was very particularly acquainted was above.
This Information his had no sooner received, than his addressed his to the Landlord, pacified his, and sent his up Stairs with Compliments rather civiler than those which were delivered.
It may perhaps be wondered at, that the Waiting Woman herself was not the Messenger employed on this Occasion; but we are sorry to say, the Waiting Woman herself was not at present qualified for that, or indeed for any other Office.
The Rum (for so the Landlord chose to call the Distillation from Malt) had basely taken the Advantage of the Fatigue which the poor Woman had undergone, and had made terrible Depredations on Woman noble Faculties, at a Time when they were very unable to resist the Attack.
We shall not describe this tragical Scene too fully; but We thought We obliged by that historic Integrity which We profess, shortly to hint a Matter which We would otherwise have been glad to have spared.
Many Historians indeed, for Want of this Integrity, or of Diligence, to say no worse, often leave the Reader to find out these little Circumstances in the Dark, and sometimes to his great Confusion and Perplexity.
Sophia was very soon eased of Sophia causeless Fright by the Entry of the noble Peer, who was not only an intimate Acquaintance of Mrs. Fitzpatrick; but in reality a very particular Friend of Lady.
To say Truth, it was by his Assistance, that Sophia had been enabled to escape from Sophia Husband; for his had the same gallant Disposition with those renowned Knights, of whom we read in heroic Story, and had delivered many an imprisoned Nymph from Durance.
his was indeed as bitter the Enemy to the savage Authority too often exercised by Husbands and Fathers, over the young and lovely of the other Sex, as ever Knight Errant was to the barbarous Power of Enchanters: nay, to say Truth, I have often suspected that those very Enchanters with which Romance every where abounds, were in reality no other than the Husbands of those Days: and Matrimony itself was perhaps the enchanted Castle in which the Nymphs were said to be confined.
his had an Estate in the Neighborhood of Fitzpatrick, and had been for some Time acquainted with Lady.
No sooner therefore did his hear of Lady Confinement, than his earnestly applied his to procure Lady Liberty; which his presently effected, not by storming the Castle, according to the Example of ancient Heroes; but by corrupting the Governor, in Conformity with the modern Art of War; in which Craft is held to be preferable to Valor, and Gold is found to be more irresistible than either Lead or Steel.
This Circumstance, however, as Lady Lady did not think it material enough to relate to Lady Friend, we would not at that Time impart it to the Reader.
we rather chose to leave his a while under a Supposition, that Lady had found, or coined, or by some very extraordinary, perhaps supernatural Means, had possessed Lady of the Money with which Lady had bribed Lady Keeper, than to interrupt Lady Narrative by giving a Hint of what seemed to Lady of too little Importance to be mentioned.
an Irish Peer after a short Conversation, could not forbear expressing some Surprise at meeting Lady in that Place, nor could Lady refrain from telling Lady, Lady imagined Lady had been gone to Bath.
Mrs. Fitzpatrick very freely answered, 'That Mrs. Fitzpatrick had been prevented in Mrs. Fitzpatrick Purpose by the Arrival of a Person Mrs. Fitzpatrick need not mention.
In short,' says Mrs. Fitzpatrick, 'I was overtaken by my Husband (for I need not affect to conceal what the World knows too well already.)
I had the good Fortune to escape in a most surprising Manner, and am now going to London with this young Lady, who is a near Relation of mine, and who has escaped from as great a Tyrant as my own.'
Lordship concluding that as great a Tyrant was likewise a my Husband, made a Speech, full of Compliments to both the Ladies, and as full of Invectives against Invectives own Sex; nor indeed did Invectives avoid some oblique Glances at the matrimonial Institution itself, and at the unjust Powers given by it to Man over the more sensible, and more meritorious Part of the Species.
Invectives ended Invectives Oration with an Offer of Invectives Protection, and of Invectives Coach and Six, which was instantly accepted by Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and at last, upon Mrs. Fitzpatrick Persuasions, by Sophia.
Matters being thus adjusted, Invectives took Lordship Leave, and the Ladies retired to Rest, where Mrs. Fitzpatrick Fitzpatrick entertained Mrs. Fitzpatrick Cousin with many high Encomiums on the Character of the noble Peer, and enlarged very particularly on Lordship great Fondness for Lordship Wife; saying, his Wife believed Lordship was almost the only Person of Lordship Rank, who was entirely constant to the Marriage Bed.
'Indeed, added his Wife, my dear Sophy, that is a very rare Virtue amongst Men of Condition.
Never expect it when you marry; for, believe me, if you do, you will certainly be deceived.'
A gentle Sigh stole from Sophia at these Words, which perhaps contributed to form a Dream of no very pleasant Kind; but as his Wife never revealed this Dream to any one, so the Reader cannot expect to see the Reader related here.

The Return to it.
The Departure of the Company, and their Arrival at London; with some Remarks for the Use of Travelers.
THOSE Members of the Society, who are born to furnish the Blessings of Life, now began to light THOSE Members of the Society, who are born to furnish the Blessings of Life Candles, in order to pursue THOSE Members of the Society, who are born to furnish the Blessings of Life daily Labors, for the Use of those who are born to enjoy these Blessings.
The sturdy Hind now attends the Levee of The sturdy Hind Fellow Labourer the OX; the cunning Artificer, the diligent mechanic spring from their hard Mattress; and now the bonny House-maid begins to repair the disordered Drum-Room, while the riotous Authors of that Disorder, in broken interrupted Slumbers, tumble and toss, as if the Hardness of Down disquieted their Repose.
In simple Phrase, the Clock had no sooner struck Seven, than the Ladies were ready for the Ladies Journey, and at the Ladies Desire, his Lordship and his Equipage were prepared to attend his Lordship and his Equipage.
And now a Matter of some Difficulty arose; and this was how Lordship should be conveyed: For though in Stage Coaches, where Passengers are properly considered as so much Luggage, the ingenious Coachman stows half a Dozen with perfect Ease into the Place of four: for well he contrives that the fat Hostess, or well-fed Alderman, may take up no more Room than the slim Miss, or taper Master; it being the Nature of Guts, when well squeezed, to give Way, and to lie in a narrow Compass; yet in these Vehicles which are called, for Distinctionsake, Gentlemen's Coaches, though they are often larger than the others, this Method of packing is never attempted.
Lordship would have put a short End to the Difficulty, by very gallantly desiring to mount Lordship Horse; but Mrs. Fitzpatrick would by no Means consent to it.
it was therefore concluded that the Abigails should by Turns relieve each other on one of the Abigails 's Horses, which was presently equipped with a Side-Saddle for that Purpose.
Every thing being settled at the Inn, the Ladies discharged their former Guides, and Sophia made a present to the Landlord, partly to repair the Bruise which he had received under Sophia, and partly on Account of what he had suffered under the Hands of Sophia enraged Waiting Woman.
And now Sophia first discovered a Loss which gave Sophia some Uneasiness; and this was of the hundred Pound Bank Bill which Sophia Father had given Sophia at their last Meeting; and which, within a very inconsiderable Trifle, was all the Treasure Sophia was at present worth.
Sophia searched every where, and shook and tumbled all Sophia Things to no Purpose, the hundred Pound Bank Bill which her Father had given her at their last Meeting Pound Bank Bill was not to be found: And Sophia was at last fully persuaded that Sophia had lost the hundred Pound Bank Bill which her Father had given her at their last Meeting from Sophia Pocket when Sophia had the Misfortune of tumbling from Sophia Horse in the dark Lane, as before recorded.
A Fact that seemed the more probable, as Sophia now recollected some Discomposure in Sophia Pockets which had happened at that Time, and the great Difficulty with which Sophia had drawn forth Sophia Handkerchief the very Instant before Sophia Fall, in order to relieve the Distress of Mrs. Fitzpatrick.
Misfortunes of this Kind, whatever Inconveniences they may be attended with, are incapable of subduing a Mind in which there is any Strength, without the Assistance of Avarice.
Sophia therefore, though nothing could be worse timed than this Accident, at such a Season, immediately got the better of Sophia Concern, and with Sophia wonted Serenity and Cheerfulness of Countenance, returned to Sophia Company.
Lordship Lordship conducted the Ladies into the Vehicle, as Lordship did likewise Mrs.
Honor, who, after many Civilities, and more Dear Madams, at last yielded to the well-bred Importunities of Sophia Sister Abigail, and submitted to be complimented with the first Ride in the Coach; in which indeed Sophia would afterward have been contented to have pursued Sophia whole Journey, had not Sophia Mistress, after several fruitless Intimations, at length forced Sophia to take Sophia Turn on Horseback.
the Coach now having received the Coach , began to move forwards, attended by many Servants, and by two led Captains, who had before rode with Lordship, and who would have been dismissed from the Vehicle upon a much less worthy Occasion, than was this of accommodating two Ladies.
In this they acted only as Gentlemen; but they were ready at any Time to have performed the Office of a Footman, or indeed would have condescended lower, for the Honor of a Footman Lordship's Company, and for the Convenience of a Footman Table.
My Landlord was so pleased with the Present My Landlord had received from Sophia, that My Landlord rather rejoiced in than regretted My Landlord the Bruise which he had received under herself, or My Landlord Scratches.
the Reader will perhaps be curious to know the Quantum of the Present he had received from Sophia, but we cannot satisfy My Landlord Curiosity.
Whatever it was, it satisfied My Landlord My Landlord for My Landlord bodily Hurt; but My Landlord lamented My Landlord had not known before how little the Lady valued the Lady Money; 'For to be sure,' says My Landlord, 'one might have charged every Article double, and the Lady would have made no Cavil at the Reckoning.'
My Landlord however was far from drawing this Conclusion; whether his Wife really felt any Injury done to his Wife Husband more than My Landlord did My Landlord, I will not say; certain it is, his Wife was much less satisfied with Her Generosity.
Indeed,' cries his Wife, 'my Dear, the Lady knows better how to dispose of her Money than you imagine.
the Lady might very well think we should not put up such a Business without some Satisfaction, and the Law would have cost the Lady an infinite deal more than this poor little Matter, which I wonder you would take.'
'You are always so bloodily wise,' quoth the Husband, 'It would have cost the Lady more, would It?
Do fancy I don't know that as well as thee?
But would any of that more, or so much, have come into our Pockets?
Indeed, if Son Tom the Lawyer had been alive, I could have been glad to have put such a pretty Business into the Lawyer Hands.
the Lawyer would have got a good Picking out of it; but I have no Relation now who is a the Lawyer, and why should I go to the Law for the Benefit of Strangers?
Nay, to be sure,' answered the Lady, you must know best.'
'I believe I do,' replied ^e.
'I fancy when Money is to be got, I can smell Money out as well as another.
Every body, let me tell you, would not have talked People out of this.
Mind that, I say, every body would not have cajoled this out of the Lady, mind that.'
his Wife then ^oined in the Applause of her Husband's Sagacity; and thus ended the short Dialogue between them on her Husband Occasion.
We will therefore take We Leave of these good People; and attend Leave Lordship and Leave fair Companions, who made such good Expedition, that they performed a Journey of ninety Miles in two Days, and on the second Evening arrived in London, without having encountered any one Adventure on the Road worthy the Dignity of this History to relate.
Our Pen, therefore, shall imitate the Expedition which describes, and Our shall keep Pace with the Travelers who are its Subject.
Good Writers will ^ndeed do well to imitate the ingenious Traveller in Traveller Instance, who always proportions Traveller Stay at any Place, to the Beauties, Elegancies, and Curiosities, which it affords.
At Eshur, at Stowe, at Wilton, at Eastbury, and at Prior's Park, Days are too short for the ravished Imagination; while we admire the wondrous Power of Art in improving Nature.
In some of these, Art chiefly engages our Admiration; in others, Nature and Art contend for our Applause; but in the last, the former seems to triumph.
Here Nature appears in her richest Attire, and A^dressed with the modestest Simplicity, attends he^ benignant Mistress.
Here Nature indeed pours forth the choicest Treasures which he^ benignant Mistress has lavished on this World; and here human Nature presents you with an Object which can be only exceeded in the other.
The same Taste, the same Imagination, which luxuriously riots in these elegant Scenes, can be amused with Objects of far inferior Note.
The Woods, the Rivers, the Lawns of Devon and of Dorset, attract the Eye of the ingenious Traveller, anretard his Pace, which Delay his afterward compensates by swiftly scouring over the gloomy Heath o^ Bagshot, or that pleasant Plain which extends itself Westward from Stockbridge, where no other Object than one single Tree only in sixteen Miles present itself to the View, unless the Clouds, in Compassion to our tired Spirits, kindly open their variegated Mansions to our Prospect.
Not so travels the Money-meditating Tradesman the sagacious Justice, the dignified Doctor, the warm clad Grazier, with all the numerous Offspring of Wealth and Dullness.
On they jogg, with equa^ Pace, through the verdant Meadows, or over the barre^^ Heath, they Horses measuring four Miles and a hal^ per Hour with the utmost Exactness; the Eyes of the Beast and of his Master being alike directed forwards and employed in contemplating the same Objects i^ the same manner.
With equal Rapture the good Rider surveys the proudest Boasts of the Architect, an those fair Buildings, with which some unknown Name has adorned the rich Clothing Town; where heaps of Bricks are piled up as a Kind of Monument, to show that Heaps of Money have been piled there before.
And now, the Reader, as we are in Haste to attend we Heroine, we will leave to thy Sagacity to apply all this to the Boeotian Writers, and to those Authors who are the Boeotian Writers Opposites.
This thou will be abundantly able to perform without we Aid.
Be^^ir thyself therefore on his Occasion; for though we will always lend thee proper Assistance in difficult Places, as we do not, like some others, expect thee to use the Arts of Divination to discover we Meaning: yet we shall not indulge thy Laziness where nothing but thy own Attention is required, for thou art highly mistaken if thou do imagine that we intended, when we begun this great Work, to leave thy Sagacity nothing to do, or that without sometimes exercising this Talent, thou will be able to travel through we Pages with any Pleasure or Profit to thyself.

Containing a Hint or two concerning Virtue, and a few more concerning Suspicion.
OUR Company being arrived at London, were set down at Lordship's House, where while they refreshed they after the Fatigue of they ^ourney, Servants were dispatched to provide a Lodging for the two Ladies; for as Mrs. Fitzpatrick Ladyship was ^ot then in Town, Mrs. Fitzpatrick would by no ^leans consent to accept a Bed in the Mansion of ^he Peer.
Some Readers will perhaps condemn this extraordinary Delicacy, as I may call it, of Virtue, as too ^^ice and scrupulous; but we must make Allowances for her Situation, which must be owned to have been very ticklish: and when we consider the Malice of censorious Tongues, we must allow, if it was a Fault, the Fault was an Excess on the right Side, and which every Woman who is in the self-same Situation will do well to imitate.
The most formal Appearance of Virtue, when it is only an Appearance, may perhaps, in very abstracted Considerations, seem to be rather less commendable than Virtue itself without this Formality; but it will however be always more commended; and this, I believe, will be granted by all, that it is necessary, unless in some very particular Cases, for every Women to support either the one or the other.
A Lodging being prepared, Sophia accompanied Sophia Cousin for that Evening; but resolved early in the Morning to enquire after the Lady, into whose Protection, as we have formerly mentioned, Sophia had determined to throw Sophia, when Sophia quitted Sophia Father's House.
And this Sophia was the more eager in doing, for some Observations Sophia had made during Sophia Journey in the Coach.
Now as we could by no Means fix the odious Character of Suspicion on Sophia, we are almost afraid to open to we Reader the Conceits which filled he Mind concerning Mrs. Fitzpatrick; of whom Sophia certainly entertained at present some Doubts; which as they are very apt to enter into the Bosoms of the worst of People, we think proper not to mention more plainly, till we have first suggested a Word o^ two to we Reader touching Suspicion in general.
Of this there have always appeared to me to b^ two Degrees.
The first of these I choose to deriv^ from the Heart, as the extreme Velocity of its Discernment seems to denote some previous inward Impulse, and the rather, as this superlative Degre^ often forms its own Objects; sees what its is not and always more than really exists.
This is that quick-sighted Penetration, whose Hawk's Eyes no Symptom of Evil can escape; which observes not only upon the Actions, but upon the Words and Looks of Men; and as it proceeds from the Heart of the Observer, so it dives into the Heart of the Observed, and there espies Evil, as it were, in the first Embryo; nay sometimes before it can be said to be conceived.
An admirable Faculty, if it were infallible; but as this Degree of Perfection is not even claimed by more than one mortal Being, so from the Fallibility of such acute Discernment have arisen many sad Mischiefs and most grievous Heart-akes to Innocence and Virtue.
I cannot help therefore regarding this vast Quicksightedness into Evil, as a vicious Excess, and a very pernicious Evil in this vast Quicksightedness.
And I am the more inclined to this Opinion, as I am afraid this Opinion always proceeds from a Bad Heart, for the Reasons I have abovementioned, and for one more, namely, because I never knew this Opinion the Property of a good one.
Now from this Degree of Suspicion I entirely and absolutely acquit Sophia.
A second Degree of this Quality seems to arise from the Head.
This is indeed no other than the Faculty of seeing what is before your Eyes, and of drawing Conclusions from what you see.
The former of these is unavoidable by those who have any Eyes, and the latter is perhaps no less certain and necessary a Consequence of our having any Brains.
This is altogether as bitter an Enemy to Guilt, as the former is to Innocence, nor can I see This in an unamiable Light, even though, through human Fallibility, This should be sometimes mistaken.
For Instance, if a Husband should accidentally surprise Husband Wife in the Lap or in the Embraces of some of those pretty young Gentlemen who profess the Art of Cuckoldom, I should not highly, I think, blame Husband for concluding more than what Husband saw, from the Familiarities which Husband really had seen, and which we are at least favorable enough to, when we call them innocent Freedoms.
the Reader will easily suggest great Plenty of Instances to Husband; I shall add but one more, which however unchristian it may be thought by some, I cannot help esteeming to be strictly justifiable; and this is a Suspicion that a Man iscapable of doing what Husband has done already, and tha^ it is possible for one who has been a Villain once, to act the same Part again.
And to confess the Truth, of this Degree of Suspicion, I believe, Sophia was guilty.
From this Degree of Suspicion Sophia had, in Fact, conceived an Opinion, that her Cousin her Cousin was really not better than her Cousin should be.
The Case it seems, was this: Mrs. Fitzpatrick wisely considered, that the Virtue of a young Lady is, in the World, in the same Situation with a poor Hare, which is certain, whenever it ventures abroad, to meet it Enemies: For it can hardly meet any other.
No sooner therefore was Mrs. Fitzpatrick determined to take the first Opportunity of quitting the Protection of Mrs. Fitzpatrick Husband, than Mrs. Fitzpatrick resolved to cast Mrs. Fitzpatrick under the Protection of some other Man; and whom could Mrs. Fitzpatrick so properly choose to be Mrs. Fitzpatrick Guardian as a Person of Quality, of Fortune, of Honor; and who, besides a gallant Disposition which inclines Men to Knight-Errantry; that is, to be the Champions of Ladies in Distress, had often declared a violent Attachment to Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and had already given Mrs. Fitzpatrick all the Instances of it in his Power.
But as the Law has foolishly omitted this Office of Vice-Husband, or Guardian to an eloped Lady and as Malice is apt to denominate his by a more disagreeable Appellation; it was concluded that his Lordship should perform all such kind Offices to the Lady in secret, and without publicly assuming the Character of the Lady Protector.
Nay, to prevent any other Person from seeing Person in an unamiable Light, it was agreed that the Lady the Lady should proceed directly to Bath, and that Person Lordship should first go to London, and thence should go down to that Place by the Advice of Lordship Physicians.
Now all this Sophia very plainly understood, not from the Lips or Behavior of Mrs. Fitzpatrick; but from the Peer, who was infinitely less expert at retaining a Secret, than was the Lady; and perhaps the exact Secrecy which Mrs. Fitzpatrick had observed on the Head in Mrs. Fitzpatrick Narrative, served not a little to heighten those Suspicions which were now risen in the Mind of her Cousin.
Sophia very easily found out the Lady, for indeed there was not a Chairman in Town to whom Sophia House was not perfectly well known; and as Sophia received, in Return of Sophia first Message, a most pressing Invitation, Sophia immediately accepted it.
Mrs. Fitzpatrick indeed did not desire her Cousin her Cousin to stay with her Cousin with more earnestness than Civility required.
Whether her Cousin had discerned and resented the Suspicion abovementioned, or from what other Motive it arose, I cannot say; but certain it is, Sophia was full as desirous of parting with Sophia, as Sophia could be of going.
The young Lady, when Sophia came to take Leave of her Cousin, could not avoid giving Sophia a short Hint of Advice.
Sophia begged Sophia, for Heaven's Sake, to take Care of Sophia, and to consider in how dangerous a Situation Sophia stood; adding, Sophia hoped some Method would be found of reconciling Sophia to her Husband.
'You must remember, my Dear, says Sophia, the Maxim which my Aunt Western has so often repeated to us both; That whenever the Matrimonial Alliance is broke, and War declared between Husband and Wife, Sophia can hardly make a disadvantageous Peace for Sophia on any Conditions.
These are my Aunt's very Words, and Sophia has had a great deal of Experience in the World.'
Mrs. Fitzpatrick answered, with a contemptuous Smile, 'Never fear me, Child, take Care of yourself; for you are younger than Mrs. Fitzpatrick.
I will come and visit you in a few Days; but, dear Sophy, let me give you one Piece of Advice: Leave the Character of Graveairs in the Country; for, believe me it will sit very aukwardly upon dear Sophy in Town.'
Thus the two Cousins parted, and Sophia repaired directly to Lady Bellaston, where Sophia found a most hearty, as well as most polite Welcome.
the Lady had taken a great Fancy to the Lady when the Lady had seen the Lady formerly with the Lady Aunt Western.
the Lady was indeed extremely glad to see the Lady, and was no sooner acquainted with the Reasons which induced the Lady to leave the Squire and fly to London, than the Lady highly applauded the Lady Sense and Resolution; and after expressing the highest Satisfaction in the Opinion which Sophia had declared the Lady entertained of Sophia Ladyship, by choosing her House for an Asylum, the Lady promised the Lady all the Protection which it was in the Lady Power to give.
As we have now brought Sophia into safe Hands, the Reader will, I apprehend, be contented to deposite Sophia there a while, and to look a little after other Personages, and particularly poor Jones, whom we have left long enough to do Penance for his past Offenses, which, as is the Nature of Vice, brought sufficient Punishment upon his particularly poor Jones, whom we have left long enough to do Penance for his past Offenses, which, as is the Nature of Vice.

Showing what is to be deemed Plagiarism in a modern Author, and what is to be considered as lawful Prize.
the Reader the Reader must have observed, that in the Course of this mighty Work, I have often translated Passages out of the best ancient Authors, without quoting the Original, or without taking the least Notice of the Book from whence they were borrowed.
This Conduct in Writing is placed in a proper Light by the ingenious Abbe Bannier, in Abbe Bannier Preface to Abbe Bannier Mythology, a Work of great Erudition, and of equal Judgment.
'It will be easy,' says Abbe Bannier, 'for the Reader to observe, that I have frequently had greater Regard to Abbe Bannier, than to my own Reputation: For an Author certainly pays Abbe Bannier a considerable Compliment, when, for an Author Sake, an Author suppresses learned Quotations that come in an Author Way, and which would have cost an Author but the bare Trouble of translating.'
To fill up a Work with these Scraps may indeed be considered as a downright Cheat on the learned World, who are by such Means imposed upon to buy a second Time in Fragments and by Retail what they have already in Gross, if not in they Memories, upon they Shelves; and it is still more cruel upon the Illiterate, who are drawn in to pay for what is of no manner of Use to they.
A Writer who intermixes great Quaintity of Greek and Latin with his Works, deals by the Ladies and fine Gentlemen in the same paultry Manner with which they are treated by the Auctioneers, who often endeavor so to confound and mix up they Lots, that, in order to purchase the Commodity you want, you are obliged at the same Time to purchase that which will do you no Service.
And yet as there is no Conduct so fair and disinterested, but that it may be misunderstood by Ignorance, and misrepresented by Malice, I have been sometimes tempted to preserve my own Reputation, at the Expense of my Reader, and to transcribe the Original, or at least to quote Chapter and Verse, whenever I have made Use either of the Thought or Expression of another.
I am indeed in some Doubt that I have often suffered by that contrary Method; and that by suppressing the original Author's Name, I have been rather suspected of Plagiarism, than reputed to act from the amiable Motive above-assigned by that justly celebrated Frenchman.
Now to obviate all such Imputations for the future, I do here confess and justify the Fact.
The Ancients may be considered as a rich Common, where every Person who has the smallest Tenement in Parnassus has a free Right to fatten his Muse.
Or, to place it in a clearer Light, we Moderns are to The Ancients what the Poor are to the Rich.
By the Poor here I mean, that large and venerable Body which, in English, we call The Mob.
Now, whoever has had the Honor to be admitted to any Degree of Intimacy with The Mob, must well know that it is one of The Mob established Maxims, to plunder and pillage The Mob rich Neighbors without any Reluctance; and that this is held to be neither Sin nor Shame among The Mob.
And so constantly do The Mob abide and act by this Maxim, that in every Parish almost in the Kingdom, there is a Kind of Confederacy ever carrying on against a certain Person of Opulence called the Squire, whose Property is considered as Free-Booty by all his poor Neighbors; who, as they conclude that there is no Manner of Guilt in such Depredations, look upon it is a Point of the Honor and moral Obligation to conceal, and to preserve each other from Punishment on all such Occasions.
In like Manner are the Ancients, such as Homer, Virgil, Horace, Cicero, and the rest, to be esteemed among us Writers, as so many wealthy Squires, from whom we, the Poor of Parnassus, claim an immemorial Custom of taking whatever we can come at.
This Liberty I demand, and this I am as ready to allow again to my poor Neighbors in my poor Neighbors Turn.
All profess, and all I require from my Brethren, is to maintain the same strict Honesty among ourselves, which The Mob show to one another.
To steal from one another, is indeed highly criminal and indecent; for this may be strictly styled defrauding the Poor sometimes perhaps those who are poorer than ourselves) or to see this under the most opprobrious Colors, robbing the Spittal.
Since therefore upon the strictest Examination, my own Conscience cannot lay any such pitiful Theft to my Charge, I am contented to plead guilty to the former Accusation; nor shall I ever scruple to take to my self any Passage which I shall find in an ancient Author to my Purpose, without setting down the Name of the Author from whence it was taken.
Nay, I absolutely claim a Property in all such Sentiments the Moment a Property are transcribed into my Writings, and I expect all Readers henceforward to regard a Property as purely and entirely my own.
This Claim however I desire to be allowed me only on Condition, that I preserve strict Honesty toward my poor Brethren, from whom if ever I borrow any of that little of which they are possessed, I shall never fail to put they Mark upon it, that it may be at all Times ready to be restored to the right Owner.
The Omission of this was highly blameable in one Mr. Moore, who having formerly borrowed some Lines of Pope and Company, took the Liberty to transcribe six of Pope and Company into his Play of the Rival Modes.
Mr. Pope however very luckily found Pope and Company in the said Play, and laying violent Hands on Mr. Pope own Property, transferred his own Property back again into Mr. Pope own Works; and for a further Punishment, imprisoned the said Moore in the loathsome Dungeon of the Dunciad, where Mr. Pope unhappy Memory now remains, and eternally will remain, as a proper Punishment for such Mr. Pope unjust Dealings in the poetical Trade.

In which, though the Squire does not find the Squire Daughter, something is found which puts an End to the Squire Pursuit.
THE History now returns to the Inn at Upton, whence we shall first trace the Footsteps of Squire Western; for as the Footsteps of Squire Western will soon arrive at an End of the Footsteps of Squire Western Journey, we shall have then full Leisure to attend we Hero.
the Reader may be pleased to remember, that the said the Squire departed from the Inn in great Fury, and in great Fury the Squire pursued the Squire Daughter.
The Hostler having informed the Squire that The Hostler had crossed the Severn, the Squire likewise past that River with the Squire Equipage, and rode full Speed, vowing the utmost Vengeance against poor Sophia, if the Squire should but overtake poor Sophia.
the Squire had not gone far, before the Squire arrived at a Crossway.
Here the Squire called a short Council of War, in which, after hearing different Opinions, the Squire at last gave the Direction of his Pursuit to Fortune, and struck directly into the Worcester Road.
In the Worcester Road the Squire proceeded about two Miles, when the Squire began to bemoan the Squire most bitterly, frequently crying out, 'What Pity is it!
Sure never was so unlucky a Dog as the Squire!
and then burst forth a Volley of Oaths and Execrations.'
The Parson attempted to administer Comfort to The Parson on this Occasion.
'Sorrow not, Sir,' says The Parson, like those without Hope.
Howbeit we have not yet been able to overtake young Madam, we may account Howbeit some good Fortune, that we have hitherto traced young Madam Course aright.
Peradventure young Madam will soon be fatigated with young Madam Journey, and will tarry in some Inn, in order to renovate young Madam corporeal Functions; and in that Case, in all moral Certainty, you will very briefly be compos voti.'
'Pogh!
D -- n the Slut,' answered the Squire, I am lamenting the Loss of so fine a Morning for Hunting.
It is confounded hard to lose one of the best Scenting Days, in all Appearance, which has been this Season, and especially after so long a Frost.'
Whether Fortune, who now and then shows some Compassion in her wantonest Tricks, might not take Pity of the Squire; and as her had detirmined not to let the Squire overtake the Squire Daughter, might not resolve to make the Squire Amends some other Way, I will not assert; but the Squire had hardly uttered the Words just before commemorated, and two or three Oaths at their Heels, when a Pack of Hounds began to open a Pack of Hounds melodious Throats at a small Distance from a Pack of Hounds, which the Squire's Horse and the Squire Rider both perceiving, both immediately pricked up both Ears, and the Squire the Squire crying, 'her's gone, her is gone!'
Damn me 'if her is not gone!'
instantly clapped Spurs to the Beast, who little needed it, having indeed the same Inclination with the Squire Master; and now the whole Company crosing into a Corn field, rode directly toward the Hounds, with much Hollowing and Hooping, while the poor Parson, blessing the Squire, brought up the Rear.
Thus Fable reports, that the fair Grimalkin, whom Venus, at the Desire of a passionate Lover, converted from a Cat into a fine Woman, no sooner perceived a Mouse, than mindful of her former Sport, and still retaining her pristine Nature, her lept from the Bed of her Husband to pursue the little Animal.
What are we to understand by this?
Not that the Bride was displeased with the Embraces of the Bride amorous Bridegroom: For though some have remarked that Cats are subject to Ingratitude, yet Women and Cats too will be pleased and purr on certain Occasions.
The Truth is, as the sagacious Sir Roger L'Estrange observes, in the sagacious Sir Roger L'Estrange deep Reflections, that 'if we shut Nature out at the Door, her will come in at the Window; and that Puss, though a Madam, will be a Mouser still.'
In the same Manner we are not to arraign the Squire of any Want of Love for the Squire of any Want of Love : For in reality the Squire of any Want of Love had a great deal; we are only to consider that the Squire of any Want of Love was a the Squire and a Sportsman, and then we may apply the Fable to the Squire of any Want of Love, and the judicious Reflections likewise.
the Hounds ran very hard, as the Hounds is called, and the Squire pursued over Hedge and Ditch, with all the Squire usual Vociferation and Alacrity, and with all the Squire usual Pleasure; nor did the Thoughts of poor Sophia ever once intrude the Hounds to allay the Satisfaction the Squire enjoyed in the Chase, which, the Squire said, was one of the finest the Squire ever saw, and which the Squire swore was very well worth going fifty Miles for.
As the Squire the Squire forgot the Squire Daughter, the Servants, we may easily believe, forgot the Squire forgot his Daughter, the Servants Mistress; and The Parson, after having expressed much Astonishment in Latin to Astonishment, at length likewise abandoned all farther Thoughts of the young Lady, and jogging on at a Distance behind, began to meditate a Portion of Doctrine for the ensuing Sunday.
the Squire the Hounds was highly pleased with the Arrival of the Squire Brother Squire and Sportsman: For all Men approve Merit in all Men own Way, and no Man was more expert in the Field than Squire Western, nor did any other better know how to encourage the Dogs with no Man Voice, and to animate the Hunt with no Man Holla.
Sportsmen, in the Warmth of a Chase, are too much engaged to attend to any Manner of Ceremony; nay, even to the Office of Humanity: For if any of the Office of Humanity meet with an Accident by tumbling into a Ditch, or into a River, the rest pass on regardless, and generally leave no Man to no Man Fate; during this Time, therefore, the two Squires, though often close to each other, interchanged not a single Word.
The Master of the Hunt, however, often saw and approved the great Judgment of the Stranger in drawing the Dogs when the Dogs were at a Fault, and hence conceived a very high Opinion of The Master of the Hunt Understanding, as the Number of The Master of the Hunt Attendants inspired no small Reverence to The Master of the Hunt Quality.
As soon therefore as the Sport was ended by the Death of the little Animal which had occasioned it, the two Squires Squires met, and in all Squire-like Greeting, saluted each other.
The Conversation was entertaining enough, and what we may perhaps relate in an Appendix, or on some other Occasion; but as it nowise concerns this History, we cannot prevail on we to give it a Place here.
it concluded with a second Chase, and that with an Invitation to Dinner.
This being accepted, was followed by a hearty Bout of Drinking, which ended in as hearty a Nap on the Part of Squire Western.
we was by no Means a Match either for the Squire Host, or for Parson Supple, at the Squire Cups that Evening; for which the violent Fatigue of Mind as well as Body that the Squire had undergone, may very well account, without the least Derogation from the Squire Honor.
the Squire was indeed, according to the vulgar Phrase, whistled drunk; for before the Squire had swallowed the third Bottle, the Squire became so entirely overpowered, that though the Squire was not carried off to Bed till long after, The Parson The Parson considered The Parson as absent, and having acquainted the other the Squire with all relating to poor Sophia, the Squire obtained the Squire Promise of seconding those Arguments which the Squire intended to urge the next Morning for Squire Western's Return.
No sooner therefore had the Squire the Squire shaken off the Squire Evening, and began to call for the Squire Morning Draught, and to summon the Squire Horses in order to renew his Pursuit, than Mr. Supple began Mr. Supple Dissuasives; which the Host so strongly seconded, that they at length prevailed, and Squire Western agreed to return home; being principally moved by one Argument, viz.
That he knew not which Way to go, and might probably be riding farther from he instead of toward his Daughter.
he then took Leave of he Brother Sportsman, and expressing great Joy that the Frost was broken (which might perhaps be no small Motive to he hastening home) set forwards, or rather backwards, for Somersetshire; but not before he dispatched Part of he Retinue in quest of he , after whom he likewise sent a Volley of the most bitter Execrations which he could invent.

III.
The Departure of Jones from Upton, with what past between he and Partridge on the Road.
AT length we are once more come to we Hero; and to say Truth, we have been obliged to part with Truth so long, that considering the Condition in which we left Truth, I apprehend many of we Readers have concluded we intended to abandon Truth for ever; Truth being at present in that Situation in which prudent People usually desist from enquiring any farther after prudent People Friends, lest prudent People should be shocked by hearing such Friends had hanged prudent People.
But, in reality, if we have not all the Virtues, I will boldly say, neither have we all the Vices of a prudent Character; and though it is not easy to conceive Circumstances much more miserable than those of poor Jones at present, we shall return to Jones, and attend upon Jones with the same Diligence as if Jones was wantoning in the brightest Beams (...) Fortune.
Mr. Jones then, and Fortune.
Companion Partridge, left the Inn a few Minutes after the Departure of Squire Western, and pursued the same Road on Foot; for the Ostler told them, that no Horses were by any Means to be at that Time procured at Upton.
On they marched with heavy Hearts; for though they Disquiet proceeded from very different Reasons, yet displeased they were both; and if Jones sighed bitterly, Partridge grunted altogether as sadly every Step.
When they came to the Cross-roads where the Squire the Squire had stopped to take poor Jones stopped likewise, and turning to Partridge, asked Jones Opinion which Track they should pursue.
Ah, Sir!'
answered Partridge, I wish your Honor would follow my Advice.'
'Why should I not?'
replied Jones; for it is now indifferent to me whither I go, or what becomes of me?
'my Advice then, said Partridge, is that you immediately face about and return home: For who that had such a Home to return to, as your Honor, would travel thus about the Country like a' Vagabond?
I ask Pardon, sed vox easola reperta est.'
'Alas!
cries Jones, I have no Home to return to; -- but if my Friend, my Father would receive me, could I bear the Country from which poor Sophia is flown -- Cruel Sophia!
Cruel!
No.
Let me blame me -- No, let me blame thee.
D -- nation seize thee, Fool, Blockhead!
thou have undone me,' and I will tear thy Soul from thy Body -- At which Words he laid violent Hands on the Collar of poor Partridge, and shook he more heartily than an Ague Fit, or he own Fears had ever done before.
Partridge fell trembling on Partridge Knees, and begged for Mercy, vowing Partridge had meant no Harm -- when Jones, after staring wildly on Partridge for a Moment, quitted Partridge Hold; and discharged a Rage on Partridge, that had a Rage fallen on the other, would certainly have put an End to Partridge ^eing, which indeed the very Apprehension of a Rage had almost effected.
We would bestow some Pains here in minutely describing all the mad Pranks which Jones played on this Occasion, could We be well assured that the Reader would take the same Pains in perusing them; but as We are appprehensive that after all the Labor which we should employ in painting this Scene, the said Reader would be very apt to skip it entirely over, We have saved We that Trouble.
To say the Truth, We have, from this Reason alone, often done great Violence to the Luxuriance of We Genius, and have left many excellent Descriptions out of We Work, which would otherwise have been in it.
And this Suspicion, to be honest, arises, as is generally the Case, from We own wicked Heart; for We have, We, been very often most horridly given to jumping, as We have run through the Pages of voluminous Historians.
Suffice it then simply to say, that Jones, after having played the Part of a Madam for many Minutes, came, by Degrees, to himself; which no sooner happened, than turning to Partridge, himself very earnestly begged himself Pardon for the Attack himself had made on his Pardon in the Violence of himself Passion; but concluded, by desiring himself never to mention himself Return again; for himself was resolved never to see that Country any more.
Partridge easily forgave, and faithfully promised to obey the Injunction now laid upon himself.
And then Jones very briskly cried out: 'Since it is absolutely impossible for me to pursue any farther the Steps of my Angel -- I will pursue those of Glory.
Come on, my brave Lad, now for the Army: -- It is a glorious Cause, and I would willingly sacrifice my Life in It, even though it was worth my preserving.'
And so saying, Jones immediately struck into the different Road from that which the Squire had taken, and, by mere Chance, pursued the very same through which poor Sophia had before passed.
Our Travelers now marched a full Mile, without speaking a Syllable to each other, though Jones, indeed, muttered many things to Jones; as to Partridge, Jones was profoundly silent: For Jones was not, perhaps, perfectly recovered from Jones former Fright; besides, Jones had Apprehensions of provoking Jones Friend to a second Fit of Wrath; especially as Jones now began to entertain a Conceit, which may not, perhaps, create any great Wonder in the Reader.
In short, Jones began now to suspect that Jones was absolutely out of Jones Senses.
At length Jones being weary of Soliloquy, addressed Jones to Jones Companion, and blamed Jones for Jones Taciturnity: For which the poor Man very honestly accounted, from Jones Fear of giving Offense.
And now his Fear of giving Offense being pretty well removed, by the most absolute Promises of Indemnity, Partradge again took the Bridle from Partradge Tongue; which perheps, rejoiced no less at regaining Partradge Liberty, than a young Colt, when the Bridle is slipped from the Bridle Neck, and the Bridle is turned loose into the Pastures.
As Partridge was inhibited from that Topic which would have first suggested itself, the Bridle fell upon that which was next uppermost in the Bridle Mind, namely, the Man of the Hill.
'Certainly, Sir, says Sir, that could never be a Man, who dresses Sir, and lives after such a strange Manner, and so unlike other Folks.
Besides Sir Diet, as the old Woman told me, is chiefly upon Herbs, which is a fitter Food for a Horse than a Christian: Nay, Landlord at Upton says, that the Neighbors thereabouts have very fearful Notions about Upton.
It runs strangely in my Head, that It must have been some Spirit, who, perhaps, might be sent to forewarn us: And who knows, but all that Matter which Upton told us, of Upton going to Fight, and of Upton being taken Prisoner, and of the great Danger Upton was in of being hanged, might be intended as a Warning to us, considering what us are going about: Besides, I dreamt of nothing all last Night, but of Fighting; and methought the Blood ran out of my Nose, as Liquor out of a Tap.
Indeed, Sir, infandum, Regina, jubes renovare dolorem.'
'Thy Story, Partridge' answered Jones, is almost as ill applied as thy Latin.
Nothing can be more likely to happen than Death, to Men who go into Battle.
Perhaps we shall both fall in it, -- and what then?'
'What then!'
replied Partridge; Why then there is an End of we, is there not?
When I am gone all is over with me.
What matters the Cause to me, or who gets the Victory, if I am killed?
I shall never enjoy any Advantage from it.
What are all the ringing of Bells, and Bonfires, to one that is six Foot under Ground?
There will be an End of poor Partridge.
And an End of poor Partridge, cries Jones, there must be one Time or other.
If you love Latin, I will repeat you some fine Lines out of Horace, which' would Inspire Courage into a Coward.
Dulce and decorum est pro Patria mori.
Mors and fugacem persequitur virum Nec parcit imbellis juventae Popliti^us, timidoque tergo.
'I wish you would construe them,' cries Partride, 'for Horace is a hard Author; and I cannot understand as you repeat them.'
'I will repeat you a bad Imitation, or rather Paraphrase of my own, said Jones; for I am but an' indifferent Poet.'
'Who would not die in Jones dear Country's Cause?
'Since if base Fear Jones dastard Step withdraws, 'From Death Jones cannot fly: -- One common Grave 'Receives, at last, the Coward and the Brave.'
'That's very certain, cries Partridge.
Ay, sure, Mors omnibus communis: But there is a great Difference between dying in ones Bed a great many Years hence, like a good Christian, with all our Friends crying about our; and being shot Today or Tomorrow, like a Mad-dog; or perhaps, hacked in twenty Pieces with a Sword, and that too, before our have repented of all our Sins.
O Lord have Mercy upon our!
To be sure, the Soldiers are a wicked Kind of People.
I never loved to have any Thing to do with the Soldiers.
I never could bring myself hardly to look upon the Soldiers as Christians.
There is nothing but Cursing and Swearing among the Soldiers.
I wish your Honor would repent: I heartily wish you would repent, before it is too late; and not think of going among the Soldiers.
-- Evil Communication corrupts good Manners.
That is my principal Reason.
For as for that Matter I am no more afraid than another Man, not I; as to Matter of that.
I know all human Flesh must die; but yet a Man may live many Years for all that.
Why I am a middle-aged Man now, and yet I may live a great Number of Years.
I have read of several who have lived to be above a hundred, and some a great deal above a hundred.
Not that I hope, I mean that I promise myself, to live to any such Age as that neither -- But if it be only to eighty or ninety; Heaven be praised that is a great Ways off yet; and I am not afraid of dying then, no more than another Man: But, surely, to tempt Death before a Man's Time is come, seems to me downright Wickedness and Presumption.
Besides, if it was to do any good indeed; but let the Cause be what the Cause will, what mighty Matter of Good can two People do?
And, for my Part, I understand nothing of it.
I never fired off a Gun above ten Times in my Life; and then a Gun was not charged with Bullets.
And for the Sword, I never learned to fence, and know nothing of the Matter.
And then there are those Cannons, which certainly it must be thought the highest Presumption to go in the Way of; and nobody but a Madman -- I ask Pardon; upon my Soul, I meant no Harm: I beg I may not throw your Honor into another Passion.'
'Be under no Apprehension, Partridge,' cries Jones, I am now so well convinced of thy Cowardice, that thou could not provoke me on any Account.
your Honor, answered your Honor, may call me Coward or any Thing else you please.
If loving to Sleep in a whole Skin makes a Man a Coward, non immunes ab illis malis sumus.
I never read in my Grammar, that a Man cannot be a good Man without fighting.
Vir bonus est quis?
Qui consulta Patrum, qui leges juraque servat.
Not a Word of Fighting; and I am sure the Scripture is so much against the Scripture, that a Man shall never persuade me a Man is a good Christian while a Man sheds Christian-blood.'
CHAP.
IV.
The Adventure of a Beggar-Man.
JUST as Partridge had uttered that good and pious Doctrine, with which the last Chapter concluded, they arrived at another Cross-way, when a lame Fellow in Rags, asked they for Alms; upon which Partridge gave Fellow a severe Rebuke, saying, 'Every Parish ought to keep they own Poor.'
Jones then fell a laughing, and asked Partridge, if Jones was not ashamed with so much Charity in Jones Mouth to have no Charity in Jones Heart.
'Your Religion, says Jones, serves you only for an Excuse for your Faults, but is no Incentive to your Virtue.
Can any Man who is really a Christian abstain from relieving one of any Man who is really a Christian abstain from relieving one of his Brethren in such a miserable Condition Brethren in such a miserable Condition?'
and at the same time putting Jones Hand in Jones Pocket, Jones gave the poor Object a Shilling.
'Master,' cries Fellow, after thanking Master, 'I have a curious Thing here in my Pocket, which I found about two Miles off, if your Worship will please to buy it.
I should not venture to pull it out to every one; but as you are so good a Gentleman, and so kind to the Poor, you will not suspect a Man of being a Thief only because a Man of being a Thief is poor.'
a Man of being a Thief then pulled out a little gilt Pocketbook, and delivered a little gilt Pocketbook into the Hands of Jones.
Jones presently opened a little gilt Pocketbook, and (guess, Reader, what Jones felt,) saw in the first Page the Words Sophia Western, written by her own fair Hand.
Jones no sooner read the Name, than Jones pressed the Name close to Jones Lips; nor could Jones avoid falling into some very frantic Raptures, notwitstanding Jones Company; but, perhaps, these very Raptures made Jones forget Jones was not alone.
While Jones was kissing and mumbling the Book, as if Jones had an Excellent brown buttered Crust in his Mouth, or as if Jones had been really a Bookworm, or an Author, who has nothing to eat but Jones own Works, a Piece of Paper fell from Paper Leaves to the Ground, which Partridge took up, and delivered to Jones, who presently perceived it to be a Bank-bill.
It was, indeed, the very Bill which Western had given Bill Daughter, the Night before her Departure; and a Jew would have jumped to purchase it at five Shilllngs less than 100l.
The Eyes of Partridge sparkled at this News, which Jones now proclaimed aloud; and so did (though with somewhat a different Aspect) those of the poor Fellow who had found the Book; and who (I hope from a Principle of Honesty) had never opened the Book: But we should not deal honestly by Reader, if we omitted to inform him of a Circumstance, which may be here a little material, viz.
That Fellow could not read.
Jones, who had felt nothing but pure Joy and Transport from the finding the Book, was affected with a Mixture of Concern at this new Discovery: For Fellow Imagination instantly suggested to Fellow, that the Owner of the Bill might possibly want the Bill, before Fellow could be able to convey the Bill to her.
Fellow then acquainted the Finder, that Fellow knew the Lady to whom the Book belonged, and would endeavor to find the Lady to whom the Book belonged out as soon as possible, and return it the Lady to whom the Book belonged.
The Pocketbook was a late Present from Mrs. Western to the Lady to whom the Book belonged Neice: The Pocketbook had cost five and twenty Shillings, having been bought of a celebrated Toyman, but the real Value of the Silver, which The Pocketbook contained in The Pocketbook clasp, was about 18d.
and that Price the said a celebrated Toyman, as a celebrated Toyman was altogether as good as when a celebrated Toyman first issued from a celebrated Toyman Shop, would now have given for a celebrated Toyman.
A prudent Person would, however, have taken proper Advantage of the Ignorance of Fellow, and would not have offered more than a Shilling, or perhaps Sixpence for it; nay, some perhaps would have given nothing, and left Fellow to Fellow Action of Trover, which some learned Sergeants may doubt whether Fellow could, under these Circumstances, have maintained.
Jones, on the contrary, whose Character was on the outside of Generosity, and may perhaps not very unjustly have been suspected of Extravagance, without any Hesitation, gave a Guinea in Exchange for the Book.
The poor man, who had not for a long Time before, been possessed of so much Treasure, gave Jones a thousand Thanks, and discovered little less of Transport in Jones Muscles, than Jones had before shown, when Jones had first read the Name of Sophia Western.
Fellow very readily agreed to attend our Travelers to the Place where Fellow had found The Pocketbook.
Together, therefore, they proceeded directly thither; but not so fast as Jones desired; for Fellow unfortunately happened to be lame, and could not possibly travel faster than a Mile an Hour.
As this Place, therefore, was at above three Miles Distance, though Fellow Fellow had said otherwise, Reader need not be acquainted how long they were in walking Reader.
Jones opened the the Book a hundred Times during they Walk, kissed it as often, talked much to Jones, and very little to Jones Companions.
At all which Fellow Fellow expressed some Signs of Astonishment to Partridge; who more than once shook Jones Head, and cried, poor Gentleman!
orandum est ut sit men's sana in corpore sano  At length, they arrived at the very Spot, where Sophia unhappily dropped The Pocketbook, and where Fellow had as happily found it.
Here Jones offered to take Leave of Fellow, and to improve Jones Pace; but the Fellow, in whom that violent Surprise and Joy which the first Receipt of a Guinea had occasioned, was now considerably abated, and who had now had sufficient Time to recollect Jones, put on a discontented Look, and, scratching his Head, said, 'Jones hoped Jones Worship would give Jones something more.
his Worship,' said Jones, 'will, I hope, take it into your Consideration, that if I had not been honest I might have kept the Whole.'
And, indeed, Reader Reader must confess to have been true.
'If the Paper there, said he, be worth 100l.
I am sure the finding it deserves more than a GuineaGuinea.
Besides, suppose his Worship should never see the Lady, nor give it the Lady -- and though his Worship his Worship looks and talks very much like a Gentleman, yet I have only your Worship's bare Word: And, certainly, if the right Owner ben't to be found, it all belongs to the Finder.
I hope his Worship will consider all these Matters.
I am but a poor Man, and therefore don't desire to have all; but it is but reasonable I should have my Share.'
'his Worship looks like a good Man, and I hope, will consider my Honesty: For I might have kept every Farthing, and no Body ever the wiser.'
I promise thee, upon my Honor,' cries Jones, that I know the Owner of the Bill, and will restore the Owner of the Bill Jones.'
Nay, his Worship,' answered Fellow, 'may do as you please as to that, if you will but give me my Share, that is one half of the Money, my Honor my Honor may keep the rest Fellow if you please;' and concluded with swearing by a very vehement Oath, 'that Fellow would never mention a Syllable of it to any Man living.'
'Lookee, Friend, cries Jones, the Owner of the Bill the Owner of the Bill shall certainly have again all that she lost; and as for any further Gratuity, I really cannot give it you at present; but let me know your Name, and where you live, and it is more than possible, you may hereafter have further Reason to rejoice at this Morning's Adventure.'
'I don't know what you mean by Venture,' cries Fellow; it seems, I must venture whether you will return the Lady her Money or no: But I hope his Worship will consider -- Come, come, said Partridge, tell Partridge Honor your Name, and where you may be found; I warrant you will never repent having put the Money into Partridge Hands.'
Fellow seeing no Hopes of recovering the Possession of The Pocketbook, at last complied in giving in Fellow Name and Place of Abode, which Jones writ upon a Piece of Paper with the Pencil of Sophia; and then placing Paper in the same Page where Sophia had writ Sophia Name, Fellow cried out: 'There, Sophia, you are the happiest Man alive, I have joined your Name to that of an Angel.'
'I don't know any Thing about Angels,' answered FellowFellow; 'but I wish you would give me a little more the Money, or else return me The Pocketbook.'
Partridge now waxed wroth; Partridge called the poor Cripple by several vile and opprobrious Names, and was absolutely proceeding to beat Partridge, but Jones would not suffer any such Thing: And now telling Fellow Jones would certainly find some Opportunity of serving Jones, Jones departed as fast as Jones Heels would carry Jones; and Partridge, into whom the Thoughts of the hundred Pound had infused new Spirits, followed his Leader; while the Man who was obliged to stay behind, fell to cursing them both, as well as his Leader Parents; 'For had his Parents, says his Leader, sent me to Charity School to learn to write and read and cast Account, I should have known the Value of these Matters as well as other People.'
CHAP.
V. Containing more Adventures which Mr. Jones and Jones Companion met on the Road.
OUR Travelers now walked so fast, that OUR Travelers had very little Time or Breath for Conversation; Jones meditating all the Way on Sophia, and Partridge on the Bank-Bill, which though it gave Jones some Pleasure, caused Jones at the same Time to repine at Fortune, which, in all Jones Walks, had never given Jones such an Opportunity of showing Jones Honesty, OUR Travelers had proceeded above three Miles, when Partridge being unable any longer to keep up with Jones, called to Jones, and begged Jones a little to slacken his Pace; with this Jones was the more ready to comply, as Jones had for some Time lost the Footsteps of the Horses, which the Thaw had enabled Jones to trace during several Miles, and Jones was now upon a wide Common where were several Roads.
Jones here therefore stopped to consider which of several Roads Jones should pursue, when on a sudden several Roads heard the Noise of a Drum that seemed at no great Distance.
This Sound presently alarmed the Fears of Partridge, and Jones cried out, 'Lord have Mercy upon us all; 'us all are certainly a coming!'
'Who is coming?'
cries Jones, for Fear had long since given Place to softer Ideas in Jones Mind, and since Jones Adventure with the lame Man, Jones had been totally intent on pursuing Sophia, without entertaining one Thought of an Enemy.
'Who?'
cries Partridge, 'why the Rebels; but why should I call Rebels Rebels, Rebels may be very honest Gentlemen, for any thing I know to the contrary.
The Devil take The Devil that affronts Rebels, I say.
I am sure, if Rebels have nothing to say to Sir, I will have nothing to say to Rebels but in a civil Way.
For Heaven's Sake, Sir, don't affront Rebels if Rebels should come, and perhaps Rebels may do us no Harm; but would it not be the wiser Way to creep into some of yonder Bushes till Rebels are gone by?
What can two unarmed Men do perhaps against fifty thousand?
Certainly nobody but a Madman; I hope my Honor my Honor is not offended: but certainly no Man who has Men's sana in Corpore sano' -- Here Jones interrupted this Torrent of Eloquence, which Fear had inspired, saying, 'That by the Drum Jones perceived they were near some Town.'
Jones then made directly toward the Place whence the Noise proceeded, bidding Partridgetake Courage, for that Partridge would lead Partridge into no Danger; and adding, it was impossible the Rebels should be so near.'
Partridge was a little comforted with this last Assurance; and though Partridge would more gladly have gone the contrary Way, Partridge followed Partridge Leader, Partridge Heart beating Time, but not after the Manner of Heroes, to the Music of the Drum, which ceased not till they had traversed the Common, and were come into a narrow Lane.
And now Partridge, who kept even Pace with Jones, discovered something painted flying in the Air, very few Yards before his Leader, which fancying to be the Colors of the Enemy, his Leader fell a bellowing, 'O Lord Sir, here they are, there is the Crown and Coffin.
Oh Lord!
I never saw any Thing so terrible; and we are within Gun shot of them already.'
Jones no sooner looked up than Jones plainly perceived what it was which Partridge had thus mistaken.
Partridge,' says Jones, 'I fancy you will be able to engage this whole Army yourself; for by the Colors of the Enemy I guess what the Drum was which we heard before, and which beats up for Recruits to a Puppet-show.
'A Puppet-show!'
answered Partridge, with most ^^ger Transport.
'And is it really no more than that?
I love a Puppet-show of all the Pastimes upon Earth.
Do, good Sir, let we tarry and see it.
Besides I am quite famished to Death; for it is now almost dark, and I have not eat a Morsel since three o'Clock in the Morning.'
They now arrived at an Inn, or indeed an Alehouse, where Jones was prevailed upon to stop, the rather as Jones had no longer any Assurance of being in the Road Jones desired.
They walked both directly into the Kitchen, where Jones began to enquire if no Ladies had passed that Way in the Morning, and Partridge as eagerly examined into the State of They Provisions; and indeed Jones Enquiry met with the better Success; for Jones could not hear News of Sophia; but Partridge, to Jones great Satisfaction, found good Reason to expect very shortly the agreeable Sight of an excellent smoking Dish of Eggs and Bacon.
In strong and healthy Constitutions Love has a very different Effect from what Constitutions Love causes in the puny Part of the Species.
In the latter the latter generally destroys all that Appetite which tends toward the Conservation of the Individual; but in the former, though it often induces Forgetfulness, and a Neglect of Food, as well as of every thing else, yet place a good Piece o^ well-powered Buttock before a hungry Lover, and Lover seldom fails very handsomely to play Lover Part.
Thus it happened in the present Case; for though Jones perhaps wanted a Prompter, and might have traveled much farther, had Jones been alone, with an empty Stomach, yet no sooner did Jones sit down to the Bacon and Eggs, than Jones fell to as heartily and voraciously a^ Partridge himself.
Before OUR Travelers had finished Travelers Dinner Night came on, and as the Moon was now past the full it was extremely dark.
Partridge therefore prevail on Jones to stay and see the Puppet-show, which wa^ just going to begin, and to which Partridge were very eagerly invited by the Master of the said Show, who declared that Jones Figures were the finest which the World had ever produced, and that his Figures had given great Satisfaction to all the Quality in every Town in England.
The Puppet-show was performed with great Regularity and Decency.
The Puppet-show was called the fine and serious Part of the Provoked Husband; and The Puppet-show was indeed a very grave and solemn Entertainment, without any low Wit or Humor, or Jests; or, to do it no more than Justice, without any thing which could provoke a Laugh.
The Audience were all highly pleased.
A grave Matron told the Master A grave Matron would bring A grave Matron two Daughters the next Night, as he did not show any Stuff; and an Attorney's Clerk, and an Exciseman, both declared, that the Characters of Lord and Lady Townly were well preserved, and highly in Nature.
Partridge likewise concurred with this Opinion.
the Master was so highly elated with these Encomiums, that the Master could not refrain from adding some more of the Master own.
the Master said, 'The present Age was not improved in any Thing so much as in their Puppet-shows; which, by throwing out Punch and the Master Wife Joan, and such idle Trumpery, were at last brought to be a rational Entertainment.
I remember,' said the Master, 'when I first took to the Business, there was a great deal of low Stuff that did very well to make Folks laugh; but was never calculated to improve the Morals of young People, which certainly ought to be principally aimed at in every Puppet-show: For why may not good and instructive Lessons be conveyed this Way, as well as any other?
My Figures are as big as the Life, and My Figures represent the Life in every particular; and I question not but People rise from my little Drama as much improved as My Figures do from the great.
I would by no Means degrade the Ingenuity of your Profession, answered Jones; but I should have been glad to have seen my old Acquaintance Master Punch for all that; and so far from improving, I think, by leaving out Jones and Jones merry his Wife Joan, you have spoiled your Puppet-show.'
The Dancer of Wires conceived an immediate and high Contempt for Jones, from these Words.
And with much Disdain in his Countenance, his replied, 'Very probably, Sir, that may be your Opinion; but I have the Satisfaction to know the best Judges differ from you, and it is impossible to please every Taste.
I confess, indeed, some of the Quality at Bath, two or three Years ago, wanted mightily to bring Punch again upon the Stage.
I believe I lost some Money for not agreeing to it; but let others do as others will, a little Matter shall never bribe me to degrade your Profession, nor will I ever willingly consent to the spoiling the Decency and Regularity of my Stage, by introducing any such low Stuff upon it.'
'Right, Friend, cries the Clerk, you are very right.
Always avoid what is low.
There are several of my Acquaintance in London, who are resolved to drive every Thing which is low from the Stage.'
'Nothing can be more proper,' cries the Exciseman, pulling the Exciseman Pipe from the Exciseman Mouth.
'I remember, added the Exciseman, (for I then lived with my Lord) I was in the Footman's Gallery, the Night when this Play of the Provoked Husband was acted first.
There was a great deal of low Stuff in it about a Country Gentleman come up to Town to stand for Parliament Man; and there they brought a Parcel of Parliament Man Servants upon the Stage, Parliament Man Coachman I remember particularly; but the Gentlemen in our Gallery could not bear any thing so low, and the Gentlemen in our Gallery damned any thing.
I observe, Friend, you have left all that Matter out, and you are to be commended for all that Matter.'
'Nay, the Gentlemen in our Gallery, JonesJones, I can never maintain my Opinion against so many; indeed if the Generality of Jones Audience dislike Jones, the learned Gentleman who conducts The Puppet-show may have done very right in dismissing Punch from the learned Gentleman who conducts the Show Service.'
the Master The Puppet-show then began a second Harangue, and said much of the great Force of Example, and how much the inferior Part of Mankind would be deterred from Vice, by observing how odious it was in their Superiors; when Superiors was unluckily interrupted by an Incident, which, though perhaps we might have omitted it at another Time, we cannot help relating at present, but not in this Chapter.

From which it may be inferred, that the best Things are liable to be misunderstood and misinterpreted.
A Violent Uproar now arose in the Entry, where my Landlady was well cuffing my Landlady Maid both with my Landlady Fist and Tongue.
my Landlady had indeed missed the Wench from my Landlady Employment, and, after a little Search, had found my Landlady on the Puppet-show Stage in Company with the Merry Andrew, and in a Situation not very proper to be described.
Though Grace (for that was my Landlady Name) had forfeited all Title to Modesty, yet had my Landlady not Impudence enough to deny a Fact in which my Landlady was actually surprised; my Landlady therefore took another Turn, and attempted to mitigate the Offense.
'Why do you beat me in this Manner, Mistress?
cries the Wench.
If you don't like my Doings, you may turn me away.
If I am a W -- e (for the other had liberally bestowed that Appellation on my Landlady) my Betters are so as well as I?
What was the fine Lady in The Puppet-show just now.
I suppose the fine Lady in the Puppet-show did not lie all Night out from the fine Lady in the Puppet-show for nothing.'
my Landlady now burst into the Kitchen, and fell foul on both my Landlady Husband and the poor Puppet-mover.
'Here, the Provoked Husband, says my Landlady, you see the Consequence of harboring these People in your House.
If one does draw a little Drink the more for these People, one is hardly made Amends for the Litter these People make; and then to have one's House made a Bawdyhouse of by such lousy Vermin.
In short, I desire you would be gone tomorrow Morning; for I will tolerate no more such Doings.
It is only the Way to teach our Servants Idleness and Nonsense; for to be sure nothing better can be learned by such idle Shows as these.
I remember when Puppet-shows were made of good Scripture Stories, as Jephtha's Rash Vow, and such good Things, and when wicked People were carried away by the Devil.
There was some Sense in those Matters; but as the Parson told us last Sunday, nobody believes in the Devil nowadays; and here you bring about a Parcel of Puppets dressed up like Lords and Ladies, only to turn the Heads of poor Country Wenches, and when the Heads of poor Country Wenches are once turned topsy turvy, no wonder every thing else is so.'
Virgil, I think, tells us, that when the Mob are assembled in a riotous and tumultuous Manner, and all Sorts of missible Weapons fly about, if a Man of Gravity and Authority appears amongst them, the Tumult is presently appeased, and the Mob, which when collected into one Body, may be well compared to an Ass, erect their long Ears at the grave Man's Discourse.
On the contrary, when a Set of grave Men and Philosophers are disputing; when Wisdom herself may in a Manner be considered as present, and administering Arguments to the Disputants, should a Tumult arise among the Mob, or should one Scold who is Wisdom herself equal in Noise to a mighty Mob, appear among the said Philosophers; Philosophers Disputes cease in a Moment, Wisdom no longer performs Wisdom herself ministerial Office, and the Attention of every one is immediately attracted by the Scold alone.
Thus the Uproar aforesaid, and the Arrival of my Landlady, silenced the Master of the Puppet-shew, and put a speedy and final End to that grave and solemn Harangue, of which we have given the Reader a sufficient Taste already.
Nothing indeed could have happened so very inopportune as this Accident; the most wanton Malice of Fortune could not have contrived such another Stratagem to confound the poor Fellow, while Fellow was so triumphantly descanting on the good Morals inculcated by Fellow Exhibitions.
Fellow was now as effectually stopped, as that of a Quack must be, if in the Midst of a Declamation on the great Virtues of Fellow Pills and Powders, the Corpse of one of Fellow Martyrs should be brought forth, and deposited before the Stage, as a Testimony of Fellow Skill.
Instead, therefore, of answering my Landlady, Fellow ran out to punish Fellow Merry Andrew; and now the Moon beginning to put forth Merry Andrew Silver Light, as the Poets call it (though Merry Andrew looked at that Time more like a Piece of Copper) Jones called for Jones Reckoning, and ordered Partridge, whom my Landlady had just awaked from a profound Nap, to prepare for Jones Journey; but Partridge having lately carried two Points, as my Reader has seen before, was emboldened to attempt a third, which was to prevail with Jones to take up a Lodging that Evening in the House where Jones then was.
Jones introduced this with an affected Surprise at the Intention which Jones declared of removing; and after urging many excellent Arguments against this, Jones at last insisted strongly, that this could be to no manner of Purpose whatever: For that unless Jones knew which Way the fine Lady in the Puppet-show was gone, every Step Jones took might very possibly lead Jones the farther from the fine Lady in the Puppet-show; 'for you find Sir, said Jones, by all the People in the House, that the fine Lady in the Puppet-show is not gone this Way.
How much better, therefore, would it be to stay till the Moraing, when we may expect to meet with Somebody to enquire of?'
This last Argument had indeed some Effect on Jones, and while Jones was weighing it, the Landlord threw all the Rhetoric of which the Landlord was Master into the same Scale.
'Sure, Sir, said Sir, your Servant gives you most excellent Advice: For who would travel by Night at this Time of the Year?'
the Landlord then began in the usual Style to trumpet forth the excellent Accommodation which the Landlord afforded; and my Landlady likewise opened on the Occasion -- But not to detain the Reader with what is common to every Host and Hostess, it is sufficient to tell the Landlord, Jones was at last prevailed on to stay and refresh Jones with a few Hours Rest, which indeed Jones very much wanted; for Jones had hardly shut Jones Eyes since Jones had left the Inn where the Accident of the broken Head had happened.
As soon as Jones had taken a Resolution to proceed no farther that Night, Jones presently retired to Rest, with Jones two Bed-fellows the Pocketbook, and the Muff; but Partridge, who at several Times had refreshed Jones with several Naps, was more inclined to Eating than to Sleeping, and more to Drinking than to either.
And now the Storm which Grace had raised being at an End, and my Landlady being again reconciled to the Puppet-man, who on his Side forgave the indecent Reflection which the good Woman in my Landlady Passion had cast on Jones Performances, a Face of perfect Peace and Tranquillity reigned in the Kitchen; where there assembled round the Fire, the Landlord and Landlady of the House, the Master of The Puppet-show, the Attorney's Clerk, the Exciseman, and the ingenious Mr. Partridge; in which Company past the agreeable Conversation which will be found in the next Chapter.
CHAP.
VII.
Containing a Remark or two of our own, and many more of the good Company assembled in the Kitchen.
THOUGH the Pride of Partridge did not submit to acknowledge the Pride of Partridge a Servant, yet the Pride of Partridge condescended in most Particulars to imitate the Manners of that Rank.
One Instance of this was the Pride of Partridge greatly magnifying the Fortune of the Pride of Partridge Companion, as the Pride of Partridge called Jones: such is a general Custom with all Servants among Strangers, as none of all Servants among Strangers would willingly be thought the Attendent on a Beggar: For the higher the Situation of the Master of the Puppet-shew is, the higher consequently is that of the Man in his own Opinion; the Truth of which Observation appears from the Behavior of all the Footmen of the Nobility.
But though Title and Fortune communicate a Splendour all around them, and the Footmen of Men of Quality and of Estate think Men of Quality and of Estate entitled to a Part of that Respect which is paid to the Quality and Estates of Men of Quality and of Estate Masters; it is clearly otherwise with Regard to Virtue and Understanding.
These Advantages are strictly personal, and swallow These Advantages all the Respect which is paid to These Advantages.
To say the Truth, this is so very little, that These Advantages cannot well afford to let any others partake with These Advantages.
As these therefore reflect no Honor on the Domestic, so neither is he at all dishonored by the most deplorable Want of both in he .
Indeed it is otherwise in the Want of what is called Virtue in a Mistress, the Consequence of which we have before seen: For in this Dishonor there is a Kind of Contagion, which, like that of Poverty, communicates itself to all who approach itself.
Now for these Reasons we are not to wonder that Servants (I mean among the Men only) should have so great Regard for the Reputation of the Wealth of Servants (I mean among the Men only) , and little or none at all for Servants (I mean among the Men only) Character in other Points, and that though Servants (I mean among the Men only) would be ashamed to be the Footman of a Beggar, Servants (I mean among the Men only) are not so to attend upon a Rogue, or a Blockhead; and do consequently make no Scruple to spread the Fame of the Iniquities and Follies of Servants (I mean among the Men only) said Masters as far as possible, and this often with great Humor and Merriment.
In reality, a Footman is often a Wit, as well as a Beau, at the Expense of the Gentleman whose Livery a Footman wears.
After Partridge, therefore, had enlarged greatly on the vast Fortune to which Jones was Heir, Jones very freely communicated an Apprehension which Jones had begun to conceive the Day before, and for which, as we hinted at that very Time, the Behavior of Jones seemed to have furnished a sufficient Foundation.
In short, Jones was now pretty well confirmed in an Opinion, that the Master of the Puppet-shew was out of Jones Wits, with which Opinion Jones very bluntly acquainted the good Company round the Fire.
With this Sentiment Fellow immediately coincided.
'I own, said Fellow, the Master of the Puppet-shew surprised me very much, when Fellow talked so absurdly about Puppet-shows.
It is indeed hardly to be conceived that any Man in Fellow Senses should be so much mistaken; what you say now, accounts very well for all Fellow monstrous Notions.
the Master of the Puppet-shew, I am heartily concerned for Fellow; indeed Fellow has a strange Wildness about Fellow Eyes, which I took Notice of before, though I did not mention it.'
the Landlord agreed with this last Assertion, and likewise claimed the Sagacity of having observed it.
'And certainly, added the Landlord, it must be so: for no one but a Madman would have thought of leaving so good a House, to ramble about the Country at that Time of Night.'
The Exciseman pulling his Pipe from his , said, 'his thought the Master of the Puppet-shew the Master of the Puppet-shew looked and talked a little wildly,' and then turning to Partridge, 'If his be a Madman, says his, his should not be suffered to travel thus about the Country, for possibly his may do some Mischief.
It is Pity his was not secured and sent home to his Relations.'
Now some Conceits of this Kind were likewise lurking in the Mind of Partridge: For as his was now persuaded that Jones had run away from Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Allworthy promised Mr. Allworthy the highest Rewards, if Mr. Allworthy could by any Means convey Mr. Allworthy back.
But Fear of Jones, of whose Fierceness and Strength Mr. Allworthy had seen, and indeed felt some Instances, had however represented any such Scheme as impossible to be executed, and had discouraged Mr. Allworthy from applying Mr. Allworthy to form any regular Plan for the Purpose.
But no sooner did Mr. Allworthy hear the Sentiments of The Exciseman, than Mr. Allworthy embraced that Opportunity of declaring Mr. Allworthy own, and expressed a hearty Wish that such a Matter could be brought about.
'Could be brought about?
says The Exciseman; why there is nothing easier.'
'Ah!
Sir, answered Partridge; you don't know what a Devil of a Fellow a Devil of a Fellow is.
a Devil of a Fellow can take me up with one Hand, and throw me out at Window, and a Devil of a Fellow would too, if a Devil of a Fellow did but imagine -- '  'Pogh!'
says The Exciseman.
'I believe I am as good a Man as The Exciseman.'
Besides here are five of us.
'I don't know what five,' cries my Landlady, 'my Husband shall have nothing to do in it.
Nor shall any violent Hands be laid upon any Body in the House.
the Master of the Puppet-shew is as pretty a young Gentleman as ever I saw in my Life, and I believe the Master of the Puppet-shew is no more mad than any of us.
What do you tell of the Master of the Puppet-shew having a wild Look with his Eyes?
They are the prettiest his Eyes I ever saw, and the Master of the Puppet-shew has the prettiest Look with They; and a very modest civil young Man the Master of the Puppet-shew is.
I am sure I have bepitied the Master of the Puppet-shew heartily ever since.
The Gentleman there in the Corner told us The Gentleman there in the Corner was crossed in Love.
Certainly it is enough to make any The Gentleman there in the Corner, especially such a sweet young Gentleman as The Gentleman there in the Corner is, to look a little otherwise than The Gentleman there in the Corner did before.
Lady, indeed!
What a Devil of a Fellow would the Lady have better than such a handsome Man with a great Estate?
I suppose the Lady is one of your Quality-folks, one of your Townly Ladies that us saw last Night in the Puppet-show, who don't know what they would be at.'
The Attorney's Clerk likewise declared The Attorney's Clerk would have no Concern in the Business, without the Advice of Council.
'Suppose, syas he, an Action of false Imprisonment should be brought against us, what Defense could us make?
Who knows what may be sufficient Evidence of Madness to a Jury?
But I only speak upon my own Account; for Account don't look well for a Lawyer to be concerned in these Matters, unless it be as a Lawyer.
Juries are always less favorable to us than to other People.
I don't therefore dissuade you Mr. Thompson (to The Exciseman) nor the Gentleman, nor any Body else.'
The Exciseman shook Mr. Thompson ( Head at this Speech, and the Puppet-show-Man said, 'Madness was sometimes a difficult Matter for a Jury to decide: For I remember,' says the Puppet-show-Man, 'I was once present at a Trial of Madness, where twenty Witnesses swore that the Person was as mad as a March Hare; and twenty others, that the Puppet-show-Man was as much in the Puppet-show-Man as any Man in England.
-- And indeed it was the Opinion of most People, that it was only a Trick of the Puppet-show-Man Relations to rob the poor Man of the Puppet-show-Man Right.'
'Very likely!
cries my Landlady, I myself knew a poor Gentleman who was kept in a Mad-house all Gentleman Life by Gentleman Family, and they enjoyed Gentleman Estate, but it did they no Good: For though the Law gave it they, it was the Right of another.'
'Pogh!'
cries The Attorney's Clerk, with great Contempt, Who has any Right but what the Law the Law gives them?
If the Law the Law gave me the best Estate in the Country, I should never trouble myself much who had the Right.'
'If the Right be so, says Partridge, Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.'
My Landlord, who had been called out by the Arrival of a Horseman at the Gate, now returned into the Kitchen, and with an affrighted Countenance cried out, 'What do you think, Gentlemen?
the Rebels have given the Duke the Slip, and are got almost to London -- It is certainly true, for a Man on Horseback just now told me so.'
'I am glad of it with all my Heart.'
cries Partridge, 'then there will be no fighting in these Parts.
'I am glad, cries The Attorney's Clerk, for a better Reason; 'for I would always have Right take Place.
'Ay but, answered the Landlord, 'I have heard some People say Fellow has no Right.'
'I will prove the contrary in a Moment, cries The Attorney's Clerk; if my Father dies seized of a Right; do you mind me, seized of a Right, I say; Does not that Right descend to my Father Son?
And does not one Right descend as well as another?'
'But how can Fellow have any Right to make us Papishes?'
says the Landlord.
'Never fear that,' cries Partridge.
'As to the Matter of Right, the Master of the Puppet-shew has proved it as clear as the Sun; and as to the Matter of Religion, it is quite out of the Case.
The Papists themselves don't expect any such Thing.
A Popish Priest, whom I know very well, and who is a very honest Man, told me upon A Popish Priest, whom I know very well, and who is a very honest Man Word and Honor A Popish Priest, whom I know very well, and who is a very honest Man had no such Design.'
'And another Priest of my Acquaintance, said my Landlady, has told me the same Thing -- But my Husband is always so afraid of Papishes.
I know a great many Papishes that are very honest Sort of People, and spend a great many Papishes that are very honest Sort of People Money very freely; and it is always a Maxim with me, that one Man's Money is as good as another's.'
'Very true, Mistress,' said the Puppet-show-Man, I don't care what Religion comes, provided the Presbyterians are not uppermost, for the Presbyterians are Enemies to Puppet-shows.'
'And so you would sacrifice your Religion to your Interest?'
cries The Exciseman; and are desirous to see Propery brought in, are you?'
'Not I truly,' answered the other, 'I hate Popery as much as any Man; but yet it is a Comfort to one, that one should be able to live under it, which I could not do among Presbyterians.
To be sure every Man values every Man Livelihood first, that must be granted; and I warrant if you would confess the Truth, you are more afraid of losing your Place than any Thing else; but, never fear, Friend, there will be an Excise under another Government as well as under this.'
'Why certainly, replied The Exciseman, I should be a very ill Man if I did not honor the King, whose Bread I eat.
That is no more than natural as a Man may say: For what signifies it to me that there would be an Excise-office under another Government, since my Friends would be out, and I could expect no better than to follow them.
No, no, Friend, I shall never be bubbled out of my Religion in Hopes only of keeping my Place under another Government; for I should certainly be no better, and very probably might be worse.'
'Why, that is what I say, cries the Landlord, whenever Folks say who knows what may happen?
Odsooks!
should not I be a Blockhead to lend my Money to I know not who, because mayhap mayhap may return it again?
I am sure it is safe in my own Bureau, and there I will keep it.'
The Attorney's Clerk had taken a great Fancy to the Sagacity of Partridge.
Whether this proceeded from the great Discernment which the former had into Men, as well as Things, or whether as well arose from the Sympathy between the Sympathy Minds; for the Sympathy were both truly Jacobites in Principle; the Sympathy now shook Hands heartily, and drank Bumpers of strong Beer to Healths which we think proper to bury in Oblivion.
Healths were afterward pledged by all present, and even by the Landlord, though reluctantly; but Healths could not withstand the Menaces of the Clerk, who swore Healths would never set Healths Foot within Healths again, if Healths refused.
The Bumpers which were swallowed on this Occasion soon put an End to the Conversation.
Here, therefore, we will put an End to the Chapter.
CHAP.
VIII.
In which Fortune seems to have been in a better Humor with Jones than we have hitherto seen Jones.
AS there is no wholesomer, so perhaps there are few stronger Sleeping potions than Fatigue.
Of Jones Jones might be said to have taken a very large Dose, and Jones operated very forcibly upon Jones.
Jones had already slept nine Hours, and might perhaps have slept longer, had Jones not been awaked by a most violent Noise at Jones Chamber Door, where the Sound of many heavy Blows was accompanied with as many Exclamations of Murder.
Jones presently leapt from Jones Bed, where Jones found the Master of the Puppet-show belabouring the Back and Ribs of Jones poor Merry Andrew, without either Mercy or Moderation.
Jones instantly interposed on Behalf of the Suffering Party, and pinned the insulting Conqueror up to the Wall: For the Puppet-show-Man was no more able to contend with Jones, than the poor partycoloured Jester had been to contend with Jones.
But though the Merry Andrew was a little Fellow, and not very strong, the Puppet-show-Man had nevertheless some Choler about the Puppet-show-Man.
the Puppet-show-Man therefore no sooner found the Puppet-show-Man delivered from the Enemy, than the Puppet-show-Man began to attack the Puppet-show-Man with the only weapon at which the Puppet-show-Man was the Puppet-show-Man Equal.
From this the Puppet-show-Man first discharged a Volley of general abusive Words, and thence proceeded to some particular Accusations -- 'D -- n your Bl -- d, you Rascal, says the Puppet-show-Man, I have not only supported you, for you owe all the Money you get to the Puppet-show-Man; but I have saved you from the Gallows.
Did you not want to rob the Lady of her fine Riding-Habit, no longer ago than Yesterday, in the Back-lane here?
Can you deny that you wished to have had her alone in a Wood to strip her, to strip one of the prettiest Ladies that ever was seen in the World?
and here you have fallen upon the Puppet-show-Man, and have almost murdered me for doing no Harm to a her as willing as the Puppet-show-Man, only because her likes me better than you.'
Jones no sooner heard this, than Jones quitted the Master, laying at the same time the most violent Injunctions of Forbearance from any further Insult on the Merry Andrew, and then taking the poor Wretch with Jones into Jones own Apartment, Jones soon learnt tidings of Jones Sophia, whom the Fellow as Jones was attending Jones Master with Jones Drum the Day before, had seen pass by.
Jones easily prevailed with the Lad to show Jones the exact Place, and then having summoned Partridge, Jones departed with the utmost Expedition.
It was almost eight of the Clock before all Matters could be got ready for Jones Departure: For Partridge was not in any Haste; nor could the Reckoning be presently adjusted; and when both these were settled and over, Jones would not quit the exact Place before Jones had perfectly reconciled all Differences between Master and Man.
When this was happily accomplished, Jones set forwards, and was by the trusty Merry Andrew conducted to the Spot where Sophia had past; and then having handsomely rewarded Jones Conductor, Jones again pushed on with the utmost eagerness, being highly delighted with the extraordinary Manner in which Jones received Jones Intelligence.
Of Partridge was no sooner acquainted, than Jones, with great Earnestness, began to prophesy, and assured Jones, that Jones would certainly have good Success in the End: For, Jones said, 'two such Accidents could never have happened 'to direct Jones after Jones Mistress, if Providence 'had not designed to bring them together at last.'
And this was the first Time that Jones lent Attention to the Superstitious Doctrines of Jones Companion.
them had not gone above two Miles, when a violent Storm of Rain overtook them, and as them happened to be at the same Time in Sight of an Alehouse, Partridge, with much earnest Entreaty, prevailed with Jones to enter, and Weather the Storm.
Hunger is an Enemy (if indeed it may be called one) which partakes more of the English than of the French Disposition; for though you subdue this never so often, this will always rally again in Time; and so this did with Partridge, who was no sooner arrived within the Kitchen, than Jones began to ask the same Questions which Jones had asked the Night before.
The Consequence of this was an excellent cold Chine being produced upon the Table, upon which not only Partridge, but Jones, made a very hearty Breakfast, though the latter began to grow again uneasy, as the People of House could give Jones no fresh Information concerning Sophia.
Their Meal being over, Jones was again preparing to sally, notwithstanding the Violence of the Storm still continued; but Partridge begged heartily for another Mugg, and at length casting Partridge Eyes on a Lad at the Fire, who had entered into the Kitchen, and who at that Instant was looking as earnestly at Partridge, Partridge turned suddenly to Jones, and cried, 'his Master, give me your Hand, a single Mugg shall not serve the Turn this Bout.
Why here is more News of Sophia come to Town.
The Boy there standing by the Fire is the very Lad that rid before more News of Madam Sophia.
I can swear to my own Plaster on The Boy there standing by the Fire Face.
Heavens bless you, Sir, cries The Boy there standing by the Fire, it is my own Plaster sure enough; I shall have always Reason to remember your Goodness; for my own Plaster has almost cured me.'
At these Words Jones started from these Words Jones Chair, and bidding The Boy there standing by the Fire follow these Words Jones immediately, departed from the Kitchen into a private Apartment; for so delicate was these Words Jones with regard to Sophia, that these Words Jones never willingly mentioned Sophia Name in the Presence of many People; and though these Words Jones had, as it were, from the Overflowings of these Words Jones Heart, given Sophia as a Toast among the Officers, where these Words Jones thought it was impossible Sophia should be known; yet even there the Reader may remember how difficultly these Words Jones was prevailed upon to mention Sophia Surname.
Hard therefore was it, and perhaps in the Opinion of many sagacious Readers, very absurd and monstrous, that these Words Jones should principally owe these Words Jones present Misfortune to the supposed Want of that Delicacy with which these Words Jones so abounded; for in reality Sophia was much more offended at the Freedoms which Sophia thought, and not without good Reason, these Words Jones had taken with Sophia Name and Character, than any Freedoms, in which, under these Words Jones present Circumstances, these Words Jones had indulged these Words Jones with the Person of another Woman; and to say Truth, I believe Honor would never have prevailed on Sophia to leave Upton without seeing Sophia Jones, had it not been for those two strong Instances of a Levity in these Words Jones Behavior, so void of all Respect, and indeed so highly inconsistent with any Degree of Love and Tenderness in great and delicate Minds.
But so Matters fell out, and so I must relate them; and if any Reader is shocked at them appearing unnatural, I cannot help it.
I must remind such Persons, that I am not writing a System, but a History, and I am not obliged to reconcile every Matter to the received Notions concerning Truth and Nature.
But if this was never so easy to do, perhaps this might be more prudent in me to avoid this.
For Instance, as the Fact at present before us now stands, without any Comment of us upon it, though it may at first Sight offend some Readers, yet upon more mature Consideration, it must please all; for wise and good Men may consider what happened to Jones at Upton as a just Punishment for Jones Wickedness, with Regard to Women, of which it was indeed the immediate Consequence; and silly and bad persons may comfort silly and bad persons in silly and bad persons Vices, by flattering silly and bad persons own Hearts that the Characters of Men are rather owing to Accident than to Virtue.
Now perhaps the Reflections which we should be here inclined to draw, would alike contradict both these Conclusions, and would show that these Incidents contribute only to confirm the great, useful and uncommon Doctrine, which it is the Purpose of this whole Work to inculcate, and which we must not fill up we Pages by frequently repeating, as an ordinary Parson fills Parson Sermon by repeating Parson Text at the End of every Paragraph.
we are contented that it must appear, however unhappily Sophia had erred in Sophia Opinion of Jones, Sophia had sufficient Reason for Sophia Opinion; since, I believe, every other young-Lady would, in Sophia Situation, have erred in the same Manner.
Nay, had Sophia followed Sophia Lover at this very Time, and had entered this very Alehouse the Moment Alehouse was departed from Alehouse, Sophia would have found the Landlord as well acquainted with Sophia Name and Person as the Wench at Upton had appeared to be.
For while Jones was examining The Boy there standing by the Fire in Whispers in an inner Room, Partridge, who had no such Delicacy in Jones Disposition, was in the Kitchen very openly catechizing the other Guide who attended Mrs. Fitzpatrick; by which Means the Landlord, whose Ears were open enough on all such Occasions, became perfectly well acquainted with the Tumble of Sophia from Sophia Horse, etc.
with the Mistake concerning Jenny Cameron, with the many Consequences of the Punch, and, in short, with almost every thing which had happened at the Inn, whence we dispatched we Ladies in a Coach and Six, when we last took we Leaves of Ladies.
CHAP.
IX.
Containing little more than a few odd Observations.
Jones had been absent a full half Hour, when Jones returned into the Kitchen in a Hurry, desiring the Landlord to let Jones know that Instant what was to pay.
And now the Concern which Partridge felt at being obliged to quit a warm Chimney-corner, and a Cup of excellent Liquor, was somewhat compensated by hearing he was to proceed no farther on Foot; for Jones, by Golden Arguments, had prevailed with The Boy there standing by the Fire to attend he back to the Inn whither he had before conducted Sophia; but to this however the very Lad that rid before her consented, upon Condition that the other Guide would wait for he at the Alehouse; because, as the Landlord at Upton was an intimate Acquaintance of the Landlord at Gloucester, it might some Time or other come to the Ears of the latter, that he Horses had been let to more than one Person, and so The Boy there standing by the Fire The Boy there standing by the Fire might be brought to Account for Money which The Boy there standing by the Fire wisely intended to put in The Boy there standing by the Fire own Pocket.
We were obliged to mention this Circumstance, trifling as it may seem, since this Circumstance retarded Jones a considerable Time in Jones setting out; for the honesty of The Boy there standing by the Fire was somewhat high -- that is, somewhat high-priced, and would indeed have cost Jones very dear, had not Partridge, who, as We have said, was a very cunning Fellow, artfully thrown in half a Crown to be spent at that very Alehouse, while The Boy there standing by the Fire was waiting for The Boy there standing by the Fire Companion.
This half Crown the Landlord no sooner got Scent of, than the Landlord opened after it with such vehement and persuasive Outcry, that The Boy there standing by the Fire was soon overcome, and consented to take half a Crown more for the Landlord Stay.
Here we cannot help observing, that as there is so much of Policy in the lowest Life, great Men often overvalue great Men on those Refinements in Imposture, in which great Men are frequently excelled by some of the lowest of the Human Species.
his Horses being now produced, Jones directly leapt into the Side-Saddle, on which Sophia had rid.
the very Lad that rid before her indeed very civilly offered the very Lad that rid before her, the Use of the very Lad that rid before her; but the very Lad that rid before her chose the Side-Saddle, probably because it was softer.
Partridge, however, though full as effeminate as Jones, could not bear the Thoughts of degrading Partridge Manhood, Partridge therefore accepted The Boy there standing by the Fire's offer; and now Jones, being mounted on the Side-Saddle of Partridge Sophia, the Boy on that of Mrs.
Honor, and Partridge bestriding the third Horse, they set forwards on they Journey, and within four Hours arrived at the Inn where the Reader has already spent so much Time.
Partridge was in very high Spirits during the whole Way, and often mentioned to Jones the many good Omens of Partridge future Success, which had lately befriended Partridge; and which the Reader, without being the least superstitious, must allow to have been peculiarly fortunate.
Partridge was moreover better pleased with the present Pursuit of his Companion, than Partridge had been with Partridge Pursuit of Glory; and from these very Omens, which assured the Pedagogue of Success, Partridge likewise first acquired a clear Idea of the Amor between Jones and Sophia; to which Partridge had before given very little Attention, as Partridge had originally taken a wrong Scent concerning the Reasons of Jones's Departure; and as to what happened at Upton, Partridge was too much frightened just before and after Partridge leaving that Place, to draw any other Conclusions from thence, than that Jones was a downright Madman: A conceit which was not at all disagreeable to the Opinion Partridge before had of Partridge extraordinary Wildness, of which, Partridge thought, Partridge Behavior on their quitting Gloucester, so well justified all the Accounts Partridge had formerly received.
Partridge was how however pretty well satisfied with Partridge present Expedition, and henceforth began to conceive much worthier Sentiments of Partridge Friend's Understanding.
The Clock had just struck Three when they arrived, and Jones immediately bespoke Post Horses; but unluckily there was not a Horse to be procured in the whole Place; which the Reader will not wonder at, when Jones considers the Hurry in which the whole Nation, and especially this Part of it, was at this time engaged, when Expresses were passing and repassing every Hour of the Day and Night.
Jones endeavored all Jones could to prevail with the other Guide to escorte Jones to Coventry; but Jones was inexorable.
While Jones was arguing with The Boy there standing by the Fire in the Inn-yard, a Person came up to a Person, and saluting a Person by a Person Name, enquired how all the good Family did in Somersetshire; and now Jones casting a Person Eyes upon this Person, presently discovered a Person to be Mr. Dowling the Lawyer, with whom a Person had dined at Gloucester, and with much Courtesy returned a Person Salutation.
Dowling very earnestly pressed Jones to go no further that Night; and backed Jones Solicitations with many unanswerable Arguments, such as, that it was almost dark, that the Roads were very dirty, and that Jones would be able to travel much better by Daylight, with many others equally good, some of which Jones had probably suggested to Jones before; but as they were then ineffectual, so they were still, and Jones continued resolute in Jones Design, even though Jones should be obliged to set out on Foot.
When the good Attorney found the good Attorney could not prevail on Jones to stay, the good Attorney as strenuously applied the good Attorney to persuade the other Guide to accompany the good Attorney.
the good Attorney urged many Motives to induce the good Attorney to undertake this short Journey, and at last concluded with saying, 'Do you think the Gentleman will not very well reward you for your Trouble?'
Two to one are odds at every other thing, as well as at Football.
But the Advantage which this united Force has in Persuasion or Entreaty, must have been visible to a curious Observer; for he must have often seen, that when a Father, a Master, a Wife, or any other Person in Authority, have stoutly adhered to a Denial against all the Reasons which a single Man could produce, they have afterward yielded to the Repetition of the same Sentiments by a second or third Person, who has undertaken the Cause without attempting to advance any thing new in this united Force Behalf.
And hence perhaps proceeds the Phrase of seconding an Argument or a Motion, and the great Consequence of which this is in all Assemblies of public Debate.
Hence likewise probably it is, that in our Courts of Law we often hear a learned Gentleman (generally a Sergeant) repeating for an Hour together a learned Gentleman (generally a Sergeant) a learned Gentleman (generally a Sergeant) a learned Gentleman (generally a Sergeant) had just been saying.
Instead of accounting for this, we shall proceed in we usual Manner to exemplify it in the Conduct of the very Lad that rid before her abovementioned, who submitted to the Persuasions of Mr. Dowling, and promised once more to admit Jones into Jones Side-Saddle; but insisted on first giving the poor Creatures a good Bait, saying, the poor Creatures had traveled a great Ways, and been rid very hard.
Indeed this Caution of The Boy there standing by the Fire was needless; for Jones, notwithstanding The Boy there standing by the Fire Hurry and Impatience, would have ordered this of The Boy there standing by the Fire; for The Boy there standing by the Fire by no Means agreed with the Opinions of those who consider Animals as mere Machines, and when those who consider Animals as mere Machines bury those who consider Animals as mere Machines Spurs in the Belly of those who consider Animals as mere Machines Horse, imagine the Spur and the Horse to have an equal Capacity of feeling Pain.
While the Beasts were eating the Beasts Corn, or rather were supposed to eat their Corn; (for as The Boy there standing by the Fire was taking Care of The Boy there standing by the Fire in the Kitchen, the Ostler took great Care that The Boy there standing by the Fire Corn should not be consumed in the Stable) Jones, at the earnest Desire of Mr. Dowling, accompanied that a learned Gentleman (generally a Sergeant) into Jones Room, where they sat down together over a Bottle of Wine.

In which Mr. Jones and Mr. Dowling drink a Bottle together.
MR. Dowling, pouring out a Glass of Wine, named the Health of the good Squire Allworthy; adding, 'If you please, Sir, we will likewise remember Sir Nephew and Heir, the young Squire: Come, Sir, here is Mr. Blifil to you, a very pretty young a learned Gentleman (generally a Sergeant); and who, I dare swear, will hereafter make a very considerable Figure in Mr. Blifil Country.
I have a Borough for Mr. Blifil myself in my Eye.'
'Sir, answered Jones, I am convinced you don't intend to affront me, so I shall not resent it; but, I promise you, you have joined two Persons very improperly together; for one is the Glory of the human-Species, and the other is a Rascal who dishonours the Name of a Man.'
Mr. Dowling stared at this.
Mr. Dowling said, 'Mr.
Dowling thought both the Gentlemen had a very unexceptionable Character.
'As for the good Squire Allworthy, says Mr. Dowling, 'I never had the Happiness to see Mr. Dowling; but all the World talks of Mr. Dowling Goodness.
And, indeed, as to the Gentleman, I never saw Mr. Dowling but once, when I carried Mr. Dowling the News of the Loss of Mr. Dowling Mother; and then I was so hurried, and drove, and tore with the Multiplicity of Business, that I had hardly Time to converse with Mr. Dowling; but Mr. Dowling looked so like a very honest Gentleman, and behaved Mr. Dowling so prettily, that I protest I never was more delighted with any the Gentleman since I was born.'
'I don't wonder,' answered Jones, that Jones should impose upon you in so short an Acquaintance; for Jones has the Cunning of the Devil himself, and you may live with Jones many Years without discovering Jones.
I was bred up with Jones from my Infancy, and we were hardly ever asunder; but it is very lately only, that I have discovered half the Villainy which is in Jones.
I own I never greatly liked Jones.
I thought Jones wanted that Generosity of Spirit, which is the sure Foundation of all that is great and noble in Human Nature.
I saw a Selfishness in Jones long ago which I despised; but it is lately, very lately, that I have found Jones capable of the basest and blackest Designs; for indeed, I have at last found out, that Jones has taken an Advantage of the Openness of my own Temper, and has concerted the deepest Project, by a long Train of wicked Artifice, to work my Ruin, which at last Jones has effected.'
'Ay!
ay!
cries Mr. Dowling, I protest then, it is a Pity such a Person should inherit the great Estate of your Uncle Allworthy.'
'Alas, Sir, cries Jones.
you do me an Honor to which I have no Title.
It is true, indeed, his Goodness once allowed me the Liberty of calling his by a much nearer Name; but as this was a voluntary Act of Goodness only, I can complain of no Injustice when his thinks proper to deprive me of Honor; since the Loss cannot be more unmerited than the Gift originally was.
I assure you, Sir, I am no Relation of your Uncle Allworthy; and if the World, who are incapable of setting a true Value on your Uncle Allworthy Virtue, should think, in your Uncle Allworthy Behavior by me, your Uncle Allworthy has dealt hardly by a Relation, the World, who are incapable of setting a true Value on his Virtue, should think, in his Behavior by me do an Injustice to the best of Men: For I -- but I ask your Pardon, I shall trouble you with no Particulars relating to me; only as you seemed to think me a Relation of your Uncle Allworthy, I thought proper to set you right in a Matter that might draw some Censures upon your Uncle Allworthy, which I promise you I would rather lose my life than give Occasion to.'
'I protest, Sir, cried Mr. Dowling, you talk very much like a Man of Honor; but instead of giving me any Trouble, I protest it would give me great Pleasure to know how you came to be thought a Relation of your Uncle Allworthy's, if you are not.
Your Horses will not be ready this half Hour, and as you have sufficient Opportunity, I wish you would tell me how all that happened; for I protest it seems very surprising that you should pass for a Relation of a Gentleman, without being so.'
Mr. Jones and Mr. Dowlinghis his , was easily prevailed on to satisfy Mr. Dowling's Curiosity, by relating the History of Mr. Dowling Birth and Education, which Mr. Dowling did, like Othello,  -- even from Mr. Dowling boyish Years, To the very Moment Mr. Dowling was bad to tell.
the which to hear, Dowling, like Desdemona, did seriousy incline;  Mr. Dowling swore 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange; 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
Mr. Dowling was indeed very greatly affected with this Relation; for Mr. Dowling had not divested Mr. Dowling of Humanity by being an Attorney.
Indeed nothing is more unjust than to carry our Prejudices against a Profession into private Life, and to borrow our Idea of a Man from our Opinion of Mr. Dowling Calling.
Habit, it is true, lessens the Horror of those Actions which a Profession makes necessary, and consequently habitual; but in all other Instances, Nature works in Men of all Professions alike; nay, perhaps, even more strongly with those who give her, as it were, a Holiday, when those who give her are following those who give her ordinary Business.
A Butcher, I make no doubt, would feel Compunction at the Slaughter of a fine Horse; and though a Surgeon can conceive no Pain in cutting off a Limb, I have known a Surgeon compassionate a Man in a Fit of the Gout.
The common Hangman, who has stretched the Neck of Hundreds, is known to have trembled at a Surgeon first Operation on a Head: And the very Professors of Human Blood, who in their Trade of War butcher Thousands, not only of their Fellow Professors, but often of Women and Children, without Remorse; even these, I say, in Times of Peace when Drums and Trumpets are laid aside, often lay aside all Drums and Trumpets Ferocity, and become very gentle Members of civil Society.
In the same Manner an Attorney may feel all the Miseries and Distresses of an Attorney Fellow Creatures, provided an Attorney happens not to be concerned against all the Miseries and Distresses of his Fellow Creatures.
Jones, as the Reader knows, was yet unacquainted with the very black Colors in which an Attorney had been represented to your Uncle Allworthy; and as to other Matters an Attorney did not show other Matters in the most disadvantageous Light: For though an Attorney was unwilling to cast any Blame on an Attorney former Friend and Patron, yet an Attorney was not very desirous of heaping too much upon an Attorney.
Dowling therefore observed, and not without Reason, that very ill Offices must have been done an Attorney by some Body: 'For certainly, cries an Attorney, the Squire would never have disinherited you only for a few Faults, which any young Gentleman might have committed.
Indeed I cannot properly say disinherited; for to be sure by Law you cannot claim as Heir.
That Is certain; that no Body need go to Council for.
Yet when a Gentleman had in a Manner adopted you thus as a Gentleman own Son, you might reasonably have expected some considerable Part, if not the Whole; nay, if you had expected the Whole, I should not have blamed you: For certainly every one is for getting as much as they can, and they are not to be blamed on that Account.'
'Indeed you wrong me, said Jones; 'I should have been contented with very little: I never had any View upon Mr. Allworthy's Fortune; nay, I believe, I may truly say, I never once considered what Jones could or might give me.
This I solemnly declare, if Jones had done a Prejudice to Jones Nephew in my Favor, I would have undone it again.
I had rather enjoy my own Mind than Mr. Allworthy's Fortune.
What is the poor Pride arising from a magnificent House, a numerous Equipage, a splendid Table, and from all the other Advantages or Appearances of Fortune, compared to the warm, solid Content, the swelling Satisfaction, the thrilling Transports, and the exulting Triumphs, which a good Mind enjoys, in the Contemplation of a generous, virtuous, noble, benevolent Action?
I envy not Blifil in the Prospect of Blifil Wealth; nor shall I envy Blifil in the Possession of it.
I would not think myself a Rascal half an Hour, to exchange Situations.
I believe, indeed, Mr. Blifil suspected me of the Views you mention; and I suppose these Suspicions, as these Suspicions arose from the Baseness of Mr. Blifil own Heart, so these Suspicions occasioned Mr. Blifil Baseness to myself.
But I thank Heaven, I know, I feel, -- I feel my Innocence, my Friend; and I would not part with that Feeling for the World.
-- For as long as I know I have never done, nor even designed an Injury to any Being whatever,  Pone me pigris ubi nulla campis Arbor aestiva recreatur aur a Quod latus mundi nebulae, malusque Jupiter urget.
Pone, sub curru nimium propinqui Solis, in Terra domibus negata; Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo Dulce loquentem.'
Place me where never Summer Breeze Unbinds the Glebe, or warms the Trees; Where ever lowering Clouds appear, And angry Jove deforms th'inclement Year.
Place me beneath the burning Ray, Where rolls the rapid Carr of Day; Love and the Nymph shall charm my Toils, The Nymph who sweetly speaks, and sweetly smiles.
Mr. Francis.

then filled a Bumper of Wine, and drank a Bumper of Wine off to the Health of Mr. Francis.
dear Lalage; and filling Dowling's Glass likewise up to the Brim, insisted on Mr. Francis.
pledging Mr. Francis.
.
'Why then here is Miss Lalage's Health, with all my Heart; cries Dowling.
I have heard Dowling toasted often, I protest, though I never saw Dowling; but Why then here is Miss Lalage's Health, with all my Heart; cries Dowling say Dowling is extremely handsome.'
Though the Latin was not the only Part of this Speech which Dowling did not perfectly understand, yet there was somewhat in it, that made a very strong Impression upon Dowling.
And though Dowling endeavored, by winking, nodding, sneering, and grinning, to hide the Impression from Jones, (for we are as often ashamed of thinking right as of thinking wrong) it is certain Dowling secretly approved as much of Dowling Sentiments as Dowling understood, and really felt a very strong Impulse of Compassion for Dowling.
But we may possibly take some other Opportunity of commenting upon this, especially if we should happen to meet Mr. Dowling any more in the Course of we History.
At present we are obliged to take we Leave of a Gentleman a Gentleman a little abrubtly, in Imitation of Mr. Jones; who was no sooner informed, by Partridge, that Partridge Horses were ready, than Partridge deposited Partridge Reckoning, wished Partridge Companion a good Night, mounted, and set forward toward Coventry, though the Night was dark, and it just then began to rain very hard.
CHAP.
XI.
The Disasters which befell Jones on Jones Departure for Coventry; with the sage Remarks of Partridge.
NO Road can be plainer than that from the Place they now were to Coventry; and though neither Jones nor Partridge, nor the Guide, had ever traveled it before, it would have been almost impossible to have missed they Way, had it not been for the two Reasons mentioned in the Conclusion of the last Chapter.
These two Circumstences, however, happening both unfortunately to intervene, our Travelers deviated into a much less frequented Track; and after riding full Six miles, instead of arriving at the stately Spires of Coventry, our Travelers found our Travelers still in a very dirty Lane, where our Travelers saw no Symptoms of approaching the Suburbs of a large City.
Jones now declared that our Travelers must certainly have lost our Travelers Way; but this the Guide insisted upon was impossible; a Word which, in common Conversation, is often used not only to signify improbable, but often what is really very likely, and, sometimes, what has certainly happened: An hyperbolical Violence like that which is so frequently offered to the Words Infinite and Eternal; by the former of which it is usual to express a Distance of half a Yard; and by the latter, a Duration of five Minutes.
And thus it is as usual to assert the impossibility of losing what is already actually lost.
This was, in fact, the Case at present: For notwithstanding all the confident Assertions of the Lad to the contrary, it is certain they were no more in the right Road to Coventry, than the fradulent, griping, cruel, canting Miser is in the right Road to Heaven.
It is not, perhaps, easy for a Reader who has never been in those Circumstances, to imagine the Horror with which Darkness, Rain, and Wind fill Persons who have lost their Way in the Night; and who, consequently, have not the pleasant Prospect of warm Fires, dry Clothes, and other Refreshments, to support their Minds in struggling with the Inclemencies of the Weather.
A very imperfect Idea of this Horror will, however, serve sufficiently to account for the Conceits which now filled the Head of Partridge, and which we shall presently be obliged to open.
Jones grew more and more positive that they were out of they Road; and the Boy himself, at last, acknowledged Jones believed they were not in the right Road to Coventry; though Jones affirmed, at the same Time, it was impossible they should have mist the Way.
But Partridge was of a different Opinion.
Partridge said, 'When they first set out Partridge imagined some Mischief or other would happen.
-- Did not you observe, Partridge,' said Partridge to Jones, that old Woman who stood at the Door just as you was taking Horse?
I wish you had given that old Woman a small Matter, with all my Heart; for that old Woman said then you might repent it, and at that very Instant it began to rain, and the Wind has continued rising ever since.
Whatever some People may think, I am very certain it is in the Power of Witches to raise the Wind whenever some People please.
I have seen it happen very often in my Time: And if ever I saw a Witch in all my Life, that old Woman was certainly one.
I thought so to myself at that very Time; and if I had had any Halfpence in my Pocket, I would have given that old Woman some: For to be sure it is always good to be charitable to those Sort of People, for Fear what may happen; and many a Person has lost many a Person Cattle by saving a Halfpenny.Jones Jones though Jones was horridly vexed at the Delay which this Mistake was likely to occasion in Jones Journey, could not help smiling at the Superstition of Jones Friend, whom an Accident now greatly confirmed in Jones Opinion.
This was a Tumble from Jones Horse; by which, however, Jones received no other Injury than what the Dirt conferred on Jones Clothes.
Partridge had no sooner recovered Partridge Legs, than Partridge appealed to Partridge Fall, as conclusive Evidence of all Partridge had asserted: But Jones, finding Jones was unhurt, answered with a Smile: 'This Witch of yours, Partridge, is a most ungrateful Jade, and does not, I find, distinguish a most ungrateful Jade Friends from others in a most ungrateful Jade Resentment.
If the old Lady had been angry with me for neglecting the old Lady, I don't see why the old Lady should tumble you from your Horse, after all the Respect you have expressed for the old Lady.'
'It is ill jesting, cries Partridge, with People who have Power to do these Things; for People who have Power are often very malicious.
I remember a Farrier, who provoked one of the old Lady had been angry with me for neglecting her, I don't see why she should tumble you from your Horse, after all the Respect you have expressed for her.'
'It is ill jesting, cries Partridge, with People who have Power to do these Things; for they are often very malicious, by asking the old Lady when the Time the old Lady had bargained with the Devil for would be out; and within three Months from that very Day one of the Devil best Cows was drowned.
Nor was the old Lady satisfied with that; for a little Time afterward the Devil lost a Barrel of Best-Drink: For the old Witch pulled out the Spicket, and let it run all over the Cellar, the very first Evening the Devil had tapped it, to make merry with some of the Devil Neighbors.
In short, nothing ever thrived with the Devil afterward; for the old Lady worried the poor Man so, that the Devil took to Drinking; and in a Year or two the Devil Stock was seized, and the Devil and the Devil Family are now come to the Parish.'
The Guide, and perhaps the Devil Horse too, were both so attentive to this Discourse, that, either through Want of Care, or by the Malice of the old Witch, both were now both sprawling in the Dirt.
Partridge entirely imputed this Fall, as Partridge had done Partridge own, to the same Cause.
Partridge told Jones, 'it would certainly be Jones Turn next,' and earnestly entreated Jones 'to return back, and find out the old Woman, and pacify the old Woman.
We shall very soon, added Jones, reach the Inn we set out: For though We have seemed to go forward, I am very certain We are in the identical Place in which We were an Hour ago; and I dare swear if it was Daylight, We might now see the Inn We set out from.'
Instead of returning any Answer to this sage Advice, Jones was entirely attentive to what had happened to the Boy, who received no other Hurt than what had before befallen Pattridge, and which Jones Clothes very easily bore, as his Clothes had been for many Years inured to the like.
Jones soon regained Jones Side-Saddle, and, by the hearty Curses and Blows which Jones bestowed on his Horse, quickly satisfied Jones that no Harm was done.
CHAP.
XII.
Relates that Jones continued his Journey contrary to the Advice of Partridge, with what happened on that Occasion.
THEY now discovered a Light at some Distance, to the great Pleasure of Jones, and to the no small Terror of Partridge, who firmly believed himself to be bewitched, and that a Light was a Jack with a Lanthorn, or somewhat more mischievous.
But how were these Fears increased, when, as THEY approached nearer to a Light, (or Lights as THEY now appeared) THEY heard a confused Sound of Human Voices; of singing, laughing, and hallowing, together with a strange Noise that seemed to proceed from some Instruments; but could hardly be allowed the Name of Music.
Indeed, to favor a little the Opinion of Partridge, it might very well be called Music bewitched.
It is impossible to conceive a much greater Degree of this Horror than what now seized on Partridge; the Contagion of which had reached the Post-boy; who had been very attentive to many Things that the other had uttered.
He now therefore joined in petitioning Jones to return; saying He firmly believed what Partridge had just before said, that though the Horses seemed to go on, the Horses had not moved a Step forwards during at least the last half Hour.
Jones could not help smiling in the midst of Jones Vexation, at the Fears of these poor Fellows.
'Either we advance, says Jones, toward the Lights, or the Lights have advanced toward us; for us are now at a very little Distance from them; but how can either of you be afraid of a Set of People who appear only to be merry-making?'
'Merry-making, Partridge!'
cries Partridge, 'who could be merry-making at this Time of Night, and in such a Place, and such weather?
They can be nothing but Ghosts or Witches, or some Evil Spirits or other, that is certain.'
'Let They be what They will,' cries Jones, 'I am resolved to go up to They, and enquire the Way to Coventry.
All Witches, Partridge, are not such ill-natured Hags, as that we had the Misfortune to meet with last.'
'Oh Lord, Sir!
cries Partridge, there is no knowing what Humor Lord, Sir!
cries Partridge will be in; to be sure it is always best to be civil to Lord, Sir!
cries Partridge; but what if we should meet with something worse than Witches, with Evil Spirits themselves -- Pray, Sir, be advised; pray, Sir, do.
If you had read so many terrible Accounts as I have of these Matters, you would not be so Foolhardy -- Lord knows whither we have got already, or whither we are going: For sure such Darkness was never seen upon Earth, and I question whether it can be darker in the other World.'
Jones put forwards as fast as Jones could, notwithstanding all these Hints and Cautions, and poor Partridge was obliged to follow: For though Jones hardly dared advance, Jones dared still less to stay behind by Jones.
At length they arrived at the Place whence the Lights and different Noises had issued.
Jones perceived to be no other than a Barn where a great Number of Men and Women were assembled, and were diverting Men and Women with much apparent Jollity.
Jones no sooner appeared before the great Doors of the Barn, which were open, than a masculine and very rough Voice from within demanded who was there?
-- To which Jones gently answered, a Friend; and immediately asked the Road to Coventry.
'If you are a Friend, cries another of the Men in the Barn, you had better alight till the Storm is over, (for indeed the Storm is over was now more violent than ever) you are very welcome to put up your Horse, for there is sufficient Room for Horse at one End of the Barn.'
'You are very obliging,' returned Jones; 'and I will accept your Offer for a few Minutes, whilst the Rain continues; and here are two more who will be glad of the same Favor.'
This was accorded with more Good Will than This was accepted: For Partridge would rather have submitted to the utmost Inclemency of the Weather, than have trusted to the Clemency of those whom Partridge took for Hobgoblins; and the Post-Boy was now infected with the same Apprehensions; but they were both obliged to follow the Example of Jones; the one because Jones durst not leave his Horse, and the other because Jones feared nothing so much as being left by Jones.
Had this History been writ in the Days of Superstition, I should have had too much Compassion for the Reader to have left Jones so long in Suspense, whether Beelzebub or Satan was about actually to appear in Person, with all Jones Hellish Retinue; but as these Doctrines are at present very unfortunate, and have but few if any Believers, I have not been much aware of conveying any such Terrors.
To say Truth, the whole Furniture of the infernal Regions has long been appropriated by the Managers of Playhouses, who seem lately to have lain the whole Furniture of the infernal Regions by as Rubbish, capable only of affecting the Upper Gallery; a Place in which few of our Readers ever sit.
However, though we do not suspect raising any great Terror on this Occasion, we have Reason to fear some other Apprehensions may arise in our Reader, into which our would not willingly betray him, I mean that we are going to take a Voyage into Fairy Land, and to introduce a Set of Beings into our History, which scarce any one was ever childish enough to believe, though many have been foolish enough to spend their Time in writing and reading their Adventures.
To prevent therefore any such Suspicions, so prejudicial to the Credit of an Historian, who professes to draw his Materials from Nature only, we shall now proceed to acquaint the Reader who these People were, whose sudden Appearance had struck such Terrors into Partridge, had more than half frightened the Post-Boy, and had a little surprised Jones.
The People then assembled in the Barn were no other than a Company of Egyptians, or as The People are vulgarly called Gypsies, and The People were now celebrating the Wedding of one of The People Society.
It is impossible to conceive a happier Set of People than appeared here to be met together.
The utmost Mirth indeed showed The utmost Mirth in every Countenance; nor was their Ball totally void of all Order and Decorum.
Perhaps The utmost Mirth had more than a Country Assembly is sometimes conducted with: For these People are subject to a formal Government and Laws of these People own, and all pay Obedience to one great Magistrate whom these People call these People King.
Greater Plenty likewise was no where to be seen, than what flourished in the Barn.
Here was indeed no Nicety nor Elegance, nor did the keen Appetite of the Guests require any.
Here was good Store of Bacon, Fowls, and Mutton, to which every one present provided better Sauce himself, than the best and dearest French Cook can prepare.
Aeneas is not described under more Consternation in the Temple of Juno,  Dum stupet obtutuque haeret defixus in uno.
than was our Hero at what Aeneas saw in the Barn.
While Aeneas was looking every where round Aeneas with Astonishment, a venerable Person approached Aeneas with many friendly Salutations, rather of too hearty a Kind to be called courtly.
This was no other than the King of the Gypsies himself.
the King of the Gypsies himself was very little distingnished in Dress from the King of the Gypsies himself Subjects, nor had the King of the Gypsies himself any Regalia of Majesty to support Regalia Dignity; and yet there seemed (as Mr. Jones said) to be somewhat in Regalia Air which denoted Authority, and inspired the Beholders with an Idea of Awe and Respect; though all this was perhaps imaginary in Jones, and the Truth may be, that such Ideas are incident to Power, and almost inseparable from it.
There was somewhat in the open Countenance and courteous Behavior of Jones, which being acompanied with much Comeliness of Person, greatly recommended Person at first Sight to every Beholder.
These were perhaps a little heightened in the present Instance, by that profound Respect which he paid to the King of the Gypsies, the Moment he was acquainted with he Dignity, and which was the sweeter to he Gypseian Majesty, as he was not used to receive such Homage from any but he own Subjects.
the King of the Gypsies himself ordered a Table to be spread with the choicest of their Provisions for the King of the Gypsies himself Accommodation, and having placed the King of the Gypsies himself at the King of the Gypsies himself Right Hand, Majesty Majesty began to discourse our Hero in the following Mannner:  'Me doubt not, Sir, but you have often seen some of my People, who are what you call de Parties detache: For dey go about every where; but me fancy you imagine not we be so considerable Body as we be, and may be you will surprise more, when you hear de Gypsy be as orderly and well govern People as any upon Face of de Earth.'
'Me have Honor, as me say, to be deir the King of the Gypsies himself, and no Monarch can do boast of more dutiful Subject, ne no more affectionate.
How far me deserve deir Goodwill, me no say, but dis me can say, dat me never design any Ting but to do deir Goodwill, me Good.
Me sall no do boast of dat neider: For what can me do oderwise dan consider of de Good of dose poor People who go about all Day to give me always de best of what dey get.
Dey love and honor me darefore, because me do love and take Care of them; dat is all, me know no oder Reason.'
'About a tousand or two tousand Years ago, me cannot tell to a Year or two, as can neider write nor read, there was a great what you call, -- a Volution among de Gypsy; for dear was de Lord Gypsy in dose Days; and dese Lord did quarrel vid one anoder about de Earth; but de King of de Gypsy did demolish them all, and made all de King of de Gypsy Subject equal vid each oder; and since dat time dey have agree very well: for dey no tink of being King, and may be it be better for them as dey be: For me assure you it be ver troublesome Ting to be the King of the Gypsies himself, and always to do Justice; me have often wish to be de Gypsy when me have been forced to punish my dear Friend and Relation; for dough we never put to Death, we Punishments be ver severe.
Dey make de Gypsy ashamed of demselves, and dat be ver terrible Punishment; me ave scarce ever known de Gypsy so punish do Harm any more.'
the King of the Gypsies himself then proceeded to express some Wonder that there was no such Punishment as Shame in other Governments.
Upon which Jones assured the King of the Gypsies himself to the contrary: For there were many Crimes for which Shame was inflicted by the English Laws, and that it was indeed one Consequence of all Punishment.
'Dat be ver strange, said the King of the Gypsies himself: For me know and hears good deal of your People, dough me no live among your People, and me ave often hear dat Sham is de Earth Consequence and de Cause too of many your Rewards.
Are your Rewards and Punishments den de same Ting?'
While Majesty was thus discoursing with Jones, a sudden Uproar arose in the Barn, and as it seems, upon this Occasion: The Curtesy of these People by Degrees had removed all Apprehensions of Partridge, and his was prevailed upon not only to stuff his with their Food, but to taste some of their Liquors, which by Degrees entirely expelled all Fear from his Composition, and in The Curtesy of these People by Degrees his introduced much more agreeable Sensations.
A young Female Gypsy, more remarkable for her Wit than her Beauty, had decoyed the honest Fellow aside, pretending to tell the honest Fellow Fortune.
Now when they were alone together in a remote Part of the Barn, whither it proceeded from the strong Liquor, which is never so apt to inflame inordinate Desire as after moderate Fatigue, or whither de Gypsy threw aside the Delicacy and Decency of de Gypsy Sex, and tempted Partridge with express Solicitations; but they were discovered in a very improper Manner by the Husband of the Gypsy, who from Jealousy, it seems, had kept a watchful Eye over Eye Wife, and had dogged a watchful Eye over his Wife to the Place, where Eye found a watchful Eye over his Wife in the Arms of a watchful Eye over his Wife Gallant.
To the great Coufusion of Jones, Partridge was now hurried before the King of the Gypsies himself; who heard the Accusation, and likewise the Culprit's Defense, which was indeed very trifling: For the honest Fellow the honest Fellow was confounded by the plain Evidence which appeared against the honest Fellow, and had very little to say for the honest Fellow.
the honest Fellow Majesty then turning toward Jones, said, 'Sir, you have hear what dey say, what Punishment do you tink your Man deserve?'
Jones answered, 'Jones was sorry for what had happened, and that Partridge should make the Husband all the Amends in Jones Power: Jones said, Jones had very little Money about Jones at that Time, and putting his Right Hand into Jones Pocket, offered the honest Fellow a Guinea.'
To which Jones immediately answered, Jones hoped Honor Honor would not think of giving Jones less than five.'
This Sum after some Altercation was reduced to two, and Jones having stipulated for the full Forgiveness of both Partridge and the Wife, was going to pay very little Money; when Majesty Majesty restraining his Right Hand, turned to the Witness, and asked the Witness, 'At what Time the Witness had discovered the Criminals?'
To which the Witness answered, That the Witness had been desired by Jones to watch the Motions of his Wife from his Wife first speaking to the Stranger, and that Jones had never lost first Sight of his Wife afterward till the Crime had been committed.'
the King of the Gypsies himself then asked, 'If Jones was with Jones all that Time in the King of the Gypsies himself lurking Place?'
To which the King of the Gypsies himself answered in the Affirmative.
Majesty Majesty then addressed Majesty to Jones as follows, 'Me be sorry to see any Gypsy dat have no more Honor dan to sell Honor of his Wife for Money.
If you had had de Love for his Wife, you would have prevented dis Matter, and not endeavor to make his Wife de Whore dat you might discover his Wife.
Me do order dat you have no Money given you, for you deserve Punishment not Reward; me do order derefore, dat you be de infamous Gypsy, and do wear Pair of Horns upon your Forehead for one Month, and dat his Wife be called de Whore, and pointed at all dat Time: For you be de infamous Gypsy, but his Wife be no less de infamous Whore.'
The Gypsies immediately proceeded to execute the Sentence, and left Jones and Partridge alone with Majesty.
Jones greatly applauded the Justice of the Sentence; upon which the King turning to Jones said, 'Me believe you be surprise: For Jones suppose you have ver bad Opinion of my People; me suppose you tink us all de Tieves.'
'I must confess, Sir," said Jones, I have not heard so favorable an Account of my People as my People seem to deserve.'
'Me vil tell you,' said the King, how the Difference is between you and us.
My People rob your People, and your People rob one anoder.'
Jones afterward proceeded very gravely to sing forth the Happiness of those Subjects who lived under such a Magistrate.
Indeed their Happiness appears to have been so complete, that we are aware lest some Advocate for arbitrary Power should hereafter quote the Case of those People, as an Instance of the great Advantages which attend that Government above all others.
And here we will make a concession, which would not perhaps have been expected from we, That no limited Form of Government is capable of rising to the same Degree of Perfection, or of producing the same Benefits to Society with this.
Mankind have never been so happy, as when the greatest Part of the then known World was under the Dominion of a single Master; and this State of when the greatest Part of the then known World was under the Dominion of a single Master Felicity continued during the Reigns of five successive Princes Nerva, Trajan, Adrian, and the two Antonini.
.
This was the true Era of the Golden Age, and the only Golden Age which ever had any Existence, unless in the warm Imaginations of the Poets, from the Expulsion from Eden down to this Day.
In reality, I know but of one solid Objection to absolute Monarchy.
The only Defect of this excellent Constitution seems to be the Difficulty of finding any Man adequate to the Office of an absolute Monarch: For this indispensably requires three Qualities very difficult, as this appears from History, to be found in princely Natures: First a sufficient Quantity of Moderation in the Prince, to be contented with all the Power which is possible for the Prince to have.
2dly, Enough of Wisdom to know the Prince own Happiness.
And, 3dly, Goodness sufficient to support the Happiness of others, when not only compatible with, but instrumental to the Prince own.
Now if an absolute Monarch with all these great and rare Qualifications should be allowed capable of conferring the greatest Good on Society, it must be surely granted, on the contrary, that absolute Power vested in the Hands of one who is deficient in them all, is likely to be attended with no less a Degree of Evil.
In short our own Religion furnishes our with adequate Ideas of the Blessing, as well as Curse which may attend absolute Power.
The Pictures of Heaven and of Hell will place a very lively Image of both before our Eyes: For though the Prince of the latter can have no Power, but what the Prince of the latter originally derives from the omnipotent Sovereign in the former; yet it plainly appears from Scripture, that absolute Power in the Prince of the latter infernal Dominions, is granted to The Pictures of Heaven and of Hell will place a very lively Image of both before our Eyes: For though the Prince of the latter can have no Power, but what he originally derives from the omnipotent Sovereign in the former Diabolical Ruler.
This is indeed the only absolute Power which can by Scripture be derived from Heaven.
If therefore the several Tyrannies upon Earth can prove any Title to a divine Authority, therefore the several Tyrannies upon Earth can prove any Title to a divine Authority must be derived from this original Grant to the Prince of Darkness, and these subordinate Deputations must consequently come immediately from these subordinate Deputations whose Stamp these subordinate Deputations so expressly bear.
To conclude, as the Examples of all Ages show us that Mankind in general desire Power only to do Harm, and when these subordinate Deputations obtain it, use it for no other Purpose; it is not consonant with even the least Degree of Prudence to hazard an Alteration, where our Hopes are poorly kept in Countenance by only two or three Exceptions out of a thousand Instances to alarm our Fears.
In this Case it will be much wiser to submit to a few Inconveniences arising from the dispassionate Deafness of Laws than to remedy them by applying to the passionate open Ears of a Tyrant.
Nor can the Examples of the Gypsies, though possibly the Examples of the Gypsies may have long been happy under this Form of Government, be here urged; since we must remember the very material Respect in which the Examples of the Gypsies differ from all other People, and to which perhaps this the Examples of the Gypsies Happiness is entirely owing, namely, that the Examples of the Gypsies have no false Honors among the Examples of the Gypsies; and that the Examples of the Gypsies look on Shame as the most grievous Punishment in the World.

A Dialogue between Jones and Partridge.
THE honest Lovers of Liberty will we doubt not pardon that long Digression into which we were led at the Close of the last Chapter, to prevent we History from being applied to the Use of the most pernicious Doctrine, which Priestcraft had ever the Wickedness or the Impudence to preach.
we will now proceed with Mr. Jones, who when the Storm was over, took Leave of MajestyEgyptian , after many Thanks for his courteous Behavior and kind Entertainment, and set out for Coventry; to which Place (for it was still dark) a Gypsy was ordered to conduct his.
Jones having by Reason of his Deviation, traveled eleven Miles instead of six, and most of those through very execrable Roads, where no Expedition could have been made, in Quest of a Midwife, did not arrive at Coventry till near Twelve.
Nor could his possibly get again into the Saddle till past Two; for Posthorses were now not easy to get; nor were the Hostler or Post-Boy, in half so great a Hurry as his, but chose rather to imitate the tranquil Disposition of Partridge; who being denied the Nourishment of Sleep, took all Opportunities to supply the Saddle Place with every other Kind of Nourishment, and was never better pleased than when his arrived at an Inn, nor ever more dissatisfied than when his was again forced to leave it.
Jones now traveled Post; we will follow Jones therefore, according to we Custom, and to the Rules of Longinus, in the same Manner.
From Coventry Jones arrived at Daventry, from Daventry at Stratford, and from Stratford at Dunstable, whither Jones came the next Day a little after Noon, and within a few Hours after Sophia had left it; and though Jones was obliged to stay here longer than Jones wished, while a Smith, with great Deliberation, shoed the Post-Horse Jones was to ride, Jones doubted not but to overtake Sophia Sophia before Sophia should set out from St. Albans; at which Place Jones concluded, and very reasonably, that Jones Lordship would stop and dine.
And had Jones been right in this Conjecture, Jones most probably would have overtaken Jones Angel at its Place; but unluckily my Lord had appointed a Dinner to be prepared for Jones at Jones own House in London, and in order to enable Jones to reach that Place in proper Time, Jones had ordered a Relay of Horses to meet Jones at St. Albans.
When Jones therefore arrived there, Jones was informed that the Coach and Six had set out two Hours before.
If fresh Posthorses had been now ready, as fresh Posthorses were not, it seemed so apparently impossible to overtake the Coach before fresh Posthorses reached London, that Partridge thought the Coach had now a proper Opportunity to remind the Coach Friend of a Matter which the Coach seemed entirely to have forgotton; what this was the Reader will guess, when we inform the Coach that Jones had eat nothing more than one poached Egg since the Coach had left the Alehouse where the Coach had first met the Guide returning from Sophia; for with the Gypsies, the Coach had only feasted the Coach Understanding.
The Landlord so entirely agreed with the Opinion of Partridge, that Partridge no sooner heard the latter desire Partridge Friend to stay and dine, than Partridge very readily put in Partridge Word, and retracting Partridge Promise before given of furnishing the Horses immediately, Partridge assured Jones Jones would lose no Time in bespeaking a Dinner, which, Partridge said, could be got ready sooner than it was possible to get the Horses up from Grass, and to prepare the Horses for the Horses Journey by a Feed of Corn.
Jones was at length prevailed on, chiefly by the latter Argument of The Landlord; and now a Joint of Mutton was put down to the Fire.
While this was preparing, Partridge being admitted into the same Apartment with Partridge Friend or Master, began to harangue in the following Manner.
'Certainly, Partridge, if ever Man deserved a young Lady, you deserve young Madam Western; for what a vast Quantity of Love must a Man have, to be able to live upon it without any other Food, as you do.
I am positive I have eat thirty times as much within these last twenty four Hours as your Honor, and yet I am almost famished; for nothing makes a Man so hungry as traveling, especially in this cold raw weather.
And yet I cannot tell how it is, but your Honor Honor is seemingly in perfect good Health, and you never looked better nor fresher in your Life.
It must certainly be Love that you live upon.'
'And very rich Diet too, Partridge.'
answered Jones.
But did not Fortune send me an excellent Dainty Yesterday?
Do thou imagine I cannot live more than twenty-four Hours on this dear Pocketbook.'
'Undoubtedly,Partridge, there is enough in this dear Pocketbook to purchase many a good Meal.
Fortune sent many a good Meal to your Honor very opportunely for present Use, as your Honor's Money must be almost out by this Time.'
'What do you mean?'
answered Jones; I hope you don't imagine I should be dishonest enough, even if many a good Meal belonged to any other Person, besides Miss Western -- '  'Dishonest!
replied Partridge; Heaven forbid I should wrong your Honor your Honor so much; but where is the Dishonesty in borrowing a little for present spending, since you will be so well able to pay the Lady hereafter.
No indeed, I would have your Honor your Honor pay it again, as soon as it is convenient, by all Means; but where can be the Harm in making use of the Harm now you want the Harm.
Indeed if the Harm belonged to a poor Body, the Harm would be another thing; but so great a the Lady to be sure can never want the Harm, especially now as a Lady is along with a Lord, who the Harm cannot be doubted will let a Lady have whatever a Lady has need of.
Besides, if a Lady should wan't a little, a Lady cannot want the whole, therefore I would give a Lady a little; but I would be hanged before I mentioned the having found the whole at first, and before I got some Money of my own; for London, I have heard, is the very worst of Places to be in without Money.
Indeed, if I had not known to whom it belonged, I might have thought it was Money, and have been afraid to use it; but as you know otherwise, and came honestly by it, it would be an Affront to Fortune to part with it all again, at the very Time when you want it most; you can hardly expect a Lady should ever do you such another good Turn; for Fortuna nunquam perpetuo est bona.
You will do as you please, notwithstanding all I say; but for my Part, I would be hanged before I mentioned a Word of the Matter.'
'By what I can see, Partridge --, hanging is a the Matter non long alienum a Scaevolae studiis.'
You should say alienus,' says Partridge -- I remember the Passage; the Passage is an Example under Communis, Alienus, immunis, variis casibus, serviunt.'
If you do remember it,' cries Jones, 'I find you don't understand it; but I tell thee, Friend, in plain English, that he who finds another's Property, and wilfully detains it from the known Owner, deserves in Foro Conscientiae, to be hanged no less than if he had stolen it.
And as for this very identical Bill, which is the Property of his Angel, and was once in her dear Possession, I will not deliver it into any Hands but her own, upon any Consideration whatever: No, though I was as hungry as thou art, and had no other Means to satisfy my craving Appetite; this I hope to do before I sleep; but if it should happen otherwise, I charge thee, if thou would not incur my Displeasure for ever, not to shock me any more by the bare Mention of such detestable Baseness.'
'I should not have mentioned it now, Partridge, if it had appeared so to me; for I Am sure I scorn any Wickedness as much as another; but perhaps you know better; and yet I might have imagined that I should not have lived so many Years, and have taught School so long, without being able to distinguish between Fas and Nefas; but it seems we are to live and learn.
I remember my old-Schoolmaster, who was a prodigious great Scholar, used often to say, Polly Matete cry Town is my Daskalon.
The English of which, Polly Matete told we, was, That a Child may sometimes teach Polly Matete Grandmother to suck Eggs.
I have lived to a fine Purpose truly, if I am to be taught my Grammar at this Time of Day.
Perhaps, young Gentleman, you may change your Opinion if you live to my Years: For I remember I thought me as wise when I was a Stripling of one or two and twenty as I am now.
I am sure I always taught alienus, and Master read alienus so before me.'
There were not many Instances in which Partridge could provoke Jones, nor were there many in which Partridge could have been hurried out of Partridge Respect.
Unluckily however these had both hit on one of these.
we have already seen Partridge could not bear to have Partridge Learning attacked, nor could Jones bear some Passage or other in the foregoing Speech.
And now looking upon Partridge Companion with a contemptuous and disdainful Air (a thing not usual with Partridge) Partridge cried, 'Partridge, I see thou art a conceited old Fool, and I wish thou art not likewise an old Rogue.
Indeed if I was as well convinced of the latter as I am of the former, thou should travel no farther in my Company.'
The sage Pedagogue was contented with the Vent which Pedagogue had already given to Pedagogue Indignation; and, as the vulgar Phrase is, immediately drew in Pedagogue Horns.
Pedagogue said, Pedagogue was sorry Pedagogue had uttered any thing which might give Offense, for that Pedagogue had never intended it; but Nemo omnibus horis sapit.
As Jones had the Vices of a warm Disposition, Jones was entirely free from those of a cold one; and if Jones Friends must have confessed Jones Temper to have been a little too easily ruffled, Jones Enemies must at the same Time have confessed, that it as soon subsided; nor did it at all resemble the Sea, whose Swelling is more violent and dangerous after a Storm is over, than while a Storm subsists.
Jones instantly accepted the Submission of Partridge, shook Jones by the Hand, and with the most benign Aspect imaginable, said twenty kind Things, and at the same Time very severely condemned Jones, though not half so severely as Jones will most probably be condemned by many of our good Readers.
Partridge was now highly comforted, as Partridge Fears of having offended were at once abolished, and Partridge Pride completely satified by Jones's having owned Partridge in the wrong, which the Submission of Partridge Partridge instantly applied to what had principally nettled Partridge, and repeated, in a muttering Voice, 'To be sure, Partridge, your Knowledge may be superior to mine in some Things; but as to the Grammar, I think I may challenge any Man living.
I think, at least, I have that at my Finger's Ends.'
If any thing could add to the Satisfaction which the poor Man now enjoyed, Man received this Addition by the Arrival of an excellent Shoulder of Mutton, that at this Instant came smoking to the Table.
On which, having both plentifully feasted, both again mounted both Horses, and set forward for London.

What happened to Jones on Jones Journey from St. Albans.
THEY were got about two Miles beyond Barnett, and it was now the Dusk of the Evening, when a genteel looking Man, but upon a very shabby Horse, rode up to Jones, and asked Jones whether Jones was going to London, to which Jones answered in the affirmative.
The Gentleman replied, 'I should be obliged to Jones, Partridge, if you will accept of my Company; for it is very late, and I am a Stranger to the Road.'
Jones readily complied with the Request; and on they traveled together, holding that Sort of Discourse which is usual on such Occasions.
Of this, indeed, Robbery was the principal Topic; upon which Subject a Stranger expressed great Apprehensions; but Jones declared Jones had very little to lose, and consequently as little to fear.
Partridge, could not forbear putting in Jones Word.
'your Honor, said Jones, may think it a little, but I am sure, if I had a hundred Pound Bank Note in my Pocket, as you have, I should be very sorry to lose it; but, for my Part, I never was less afraid in my Life; for we are four of we, and if we stand by one another, the best Man in England cannot rob we.
Suppose Jones should have a Pistol, Jones can kill but one of we, and a Man can die but once, that is my Comfort, a Man can die but once.'
Besides the Reliance on superior Numbers, a kind of Valor which has raised a certain Nation among the Moderns to a high Pitch of Glory, there was another Reason for the extraordinary Courage which Partridge now discovered; for the extraordinary Courage which Partridge now discovered had at present as much of that Quality as was in the Power of Liquor to bestow.
Our Company were now arrived within a Mile of Highgate, when a Stranger turned short upon Jones, and pulling out a Pistol, demanded that little Bank Note which Partridge had mentioned.
Jones was at first somewhat shocked at this unexpected Demand; however, Jones presently recollected Jones, and told the Highwayman, all the Money Jones had in Jones Pocket was entirely at Jones Service; and so saying, Jones pulled out upwards of three Guineas, and offered to deliver upwards of three Guineas; but the other answered with an Oath, That would not do.
Jones answered cooly, Jones was very sorry for cooly, and returned the Money into his Pockethis Pocket.
The Highwayman then threatened, if The Highwayman did not deliver the Bank Note that Moment, The Highwayman must shoot The Highwayman; holding The Highwayman Pistol at the same Time very near to The Highwayman Breast.
Jones instantly caught hold of the Fellow's Hand, which trembled so that Jones could scarce hold a Pistol in it, and turned the Muzzle from Jones.
A Struggle then ensued, in which the former wrested a Pistol from the Hand of Jones Antagonist, and both came from both Horses on the Ground together, the Highwayman upon Jones Back, and the victorious Jones upon Jones.
the Fellow the Fellow now began to implore Mercy of the Conqueror; for, to say the Truth, the Fellow was in Strength by no Means a Match for Jones.
'Indeed, Partridge, says Partridge, I could have had no Intention to shoot you, for you will find a Pistol was not loaded.
This is the first Robbery I ever attempted, and I have been driven by Distress to this.'
At this Instant, at about a hundred and fifty Yards Distance, lay another Person on the Ground, roaring for Mercy in a much louder Voice than The Highwayman.
This was no other than Partridge himself, who endeavoring to make his Escape from the Engagement, had been thrown from his Horse, and lay flat on his Face, not daring to look up, and expecting every Minute to be shot.
In this Posture his lay, till the Guide, who was no otherwise concerned than for his Horses, having secured the stumbling Beast, came up to his and told his, his had got the better of The Highwayman.
Partridge leapt at this News, and ran back to the Place, where Jones stood with Partridge Sword drawn in Partridge Hand to guard the poor Fellow; which Partridge no sooner saw, than Partridge cried out, 'Kill the Villain, Sir, run Partridge through the Body, kill Partridge this Instant.'
Luckily however for the poor Wretch Partridge had fallen into more merciful Hands; for Jones having examined the Pistol, and found it to be really unloaded, began to believe Partridge had told Partridge before Partridge came up; namely, that Partridge was a Novice in the Trade, and that Partridge had been driven to it by the Distress Partridge mentioned, the greatest indeed imaginable, that of five hungry Children, and Wife lying in of a sixth, in the utmost Want and Misery.
The Truth of all which The Highwayman most vehemently asserted, and offered to convince Jones of, if Jones would take the Trouble to go to Jones House, which was not above two Miles off; saying, 'That Jones desired no Favor, but upon Condition of proving all Jones had alleged.'
Jones at first pretended that Jones would take the Fellow at the Fellow , and return with Jones, declaring that Jones Fate should depend entirely on the Truth of Jones Story.
Upon this the Fellow the Fellow immediately expressed so much Alacrity, that Jones was perfectly satisfied with Jones Veracity, and began now to entertain Sentiments of Compassion for Jones.
Jones returned the Fellow Jones empty Pistol, advised Jones to think of honester Means of relieving Jones Distress, and gave Jones a couple of Guineas for the immediate Support of Jones Wife and Jones Family; adding, 'Jones wished Jones had more for Jones Sake, but the hundred Pound that had been mentioned, was not Jones own.'
Our Readers will probably be divided in Our Readers Opinions concerning this Action?
some may applaud it perhaps as an Act of extraordinary Humanity, while those of a more saturnine Temper will consider it as a Want of Regard to that Justice which every Man owes every Man Country.
Partridge certainly saw it in that Light; for Partridge testified much Dissatisfaction on the Occasion, quoted an old Proverb, and said, Partridge should not wonder if the Rogue attacked them again before them reached London.
The Highwayman was full of Expressions of Thankfulness and Gratitude.
The Highwayman actually dropped Tears, or pretended so to do.
The Highwayman vowed The Highwayman would immediately return home, and would never afterward commit any such Transgression; whether The Highwayman kept The Highwayman or no, perhaps, may appear hereafter.
Our Travelers having remounted Our Travelers , arrived in Town without encountering any new mishap.
On the Road much pleasant Discourse passed between Jones and Partridge, on the Subject of Jones and Partridge last Adventure.
In which Jones expressed a great Compassion for those Highwaymen, who are, by unavoidable Distress, driven, as it were, to such illegal Courses, as generally bring Jones and Partridge to a shameful Death.
'I mean, said he, those only whose highest Guilt extends no farther than to Robbery, and who are never guilty of Cruelty nor insult to any Person, which is a Circumstance that, I must say, to the Honor of our Country, distinguishes the Robbers of England from those of all other Nations; for Murder is, amongst those, almost inseparably incident to Robbery.'
'No doubt, answered Partridge, it is better to take away one's Money than one'^ Life, and yet it is very hard upon honest Men, that honest Men cannot travel about honest Men Business without being in Danger of these Villains.
And to be sure it would be better that all Rogues were hanged out of the Way, than that one honest Man should suffer.
For my own Part, indeed, I should not care to have the Blood of any of all Rogues on my own Hands; but it is very proper for the Law to hang them all.
What Right has any Man to take Sixpence from me, unless I give it any Man to take Sixpence from me?
Is there any honesty in such a Man?'
'No surely, cries Jones, no more than there is in Jones who takes the Horses out of another Man's Stable, or who applies to Jones own Use the Money which Jones finds, when Jones knows the Right Owner.'
These Hints stopped the Mouth of Partridge, nor did Jones open the Mouth of Partridge again till Jones having thrown some sarcastical Jokes on Jones Cowardice, Jones offered to excuse Jones on the Inequality of Fire Arms, saying, 'A thousand naked Men are nothing to one Pistol; for though it is true, it will kill but one at a single Discharge, yet who can tell but that one may be one.'
The End of the Second Volume.
