we must deliver we letters of qualification at the navyoffice before one a-clock; upon which we repaired thither, and gave our letters of qualification to the s -- t -- y, who opened and read our letters of qualification, and I was mightily pleased to find myself qualified for second mate of a third rate. When second mate of a third rate had stuck them all together on a file, one of we company asked if there were any vacancies; to which second mate of a third rate answered, No. Then I ventured to enquire if any ships were to be put in commission soon. -- At which second mate of a third rate surveyed me with a look of ineffable contempt, and pushing we out of second mate of a third rate office, locked the door without deigning we one word. -- we went down stairs and conferred together on we expectations, when I understood that each of them had been recommended to one or other of the commissioners; and each of them promised the first vacancy that should fall; but that none of them relied solely upon that interest, without a present to the s -- t -- y, with whom the c -- mm -- rs went snacks. -- For which reason each had provided a small purse; and I was asked what I proposed to give? -- This was a vexatious question to me, who (so far from being in a capacity to gratify a ravenous s -- t -- y) had not wherewithal to buy me a dinner. -- I therefore answered, I had not determined yet what to give; and sneaked off toward my own lodging, cursing my fate all the way, and inveighing with much bitterness against the barbarity of my grandfather, and the sordid avarice of my relations, who left me a prey to contempt and indigence. -- Full of these disagreeable reflections, I arrived at the house where I lodged, and relieved my landlord from great anxiety on my account; for this honest man believed I had met with some dismal accident, and that this honest man should never see me again. -- Strap, who had been to see me in the morning, understanding I had been abroad all night, was almost distracted, and after having obtained leave of this honest man master, had gone in quest of me, though this honest man was even more ignorant of the town than I. Not being willing to inform my landlord of my adventure, I told this honest man, I had met an acquaintance at Surgeon's-hall, with whom I spent the evening and night, but being very much infested by bugs, I had not slept much, and therefore intended to take a little repose: so saying, I went to bed and desired to be awakened if Strap happened to come while I should be asleep. -- I was accordingly roused by my friend himself, who entered my chamber about three a-clock in the afternoon; and presented a figure to my eyes, that I could scarce believe real. -- In short, this affectionate shaver, setting out toward Surgeon's-hall, had enquired for me there to no purpose; from thence this honest man found this honest man way to the navy-office, where this honest man this honest man could hear no tidings of this honest man, because I was unknown to every body then present; this honest man afterward went upon Change in hopes of seeing me upon the Scotch walk; but without any success: At last, being almost in despair of finding me, this honest man resolved to ask every body this honest man met in the street, if perchance any one could give this honest man information about me: and actually put this honest man resolution in practice, in spite of the scoffs, curses and reproaches with which this honest man was answered; until a blacksmith's 'prentice, seeing this honest man stop a porter with a burden on this honest man back, and hearing this honest man question, for which this honest man received a hearty curse, called to this honest man, and asked if the person this honest man enquired after was not a Scotchman? -- Strap replied with great eagerness, "Yes, and had on a brown coat with long skirts." -- "The same (said the blacksmith) I saw the blacksmith pass about an hour ago." -- "Did you so? (cried Strap, rubbing the blacksmith hands) Odd! I am very glad of that -- which way went the blacksmith?" -- "Toward Tyburn in a cart, (said the blacksmith) if you make good speed, you may get thither time enough to see the blacksmith hanged." -- This piece of wit incensed my friend to such a degree, that my friend called the blacksmith scoundrel, and protested the blacksmith would fight the blacksmith for half a farthing -- "No, no, (said the other, stripping) I Will have none of your money -- you Scotchmen seldom carry any about you -- but I Will fight you for love." -- There was a ring immediately formed by the mob; and Strap finding the blacksmith could not get off honorably without fighting, at the same time burning with resentment against the blacksmith adversary, quitted the blacksmith clothes to the care of the multitude, and the battle began with great violence on the side of Strap, who in a few minutes exhausted the blacksmith breach and spirits on the blacksmith patient antagonist, who sustained the assault with great coolness, till finding the barber quite spent, the blacksmith returned the blows the blacksmith had lent the blacksmith, with such interest, that Strap, after having received three falls on the hard stones, gave out, and allowed the blacksmith to be the better man. -- The victory being thus decided, The victory was proposed to adjourn to a cellar hard by and drink friends. -- But when my friend began to gather up my friend , my friend perceived that some honest person or other had made free with my friend shirt, neckcloath, hat and wig, which were carried off; and probably my friend coat and waistcoat would have met with the same fate, had his coat and waistcoat been worth the stealing. -- It was in vain for my friend to make a noise, which only yielded mirth to the spectators; my friend was fain to get off in this manner, which my friend accomplished with much difficulty, and appeared before my friend, all besmeared with blood and dirt. -- Notwithstanding this misfortune, such was my friend transport at finding me safe and sound, that my friend had almost stifled and stunk me to death with my friend embraces. -- After my friend had cleaned my friend and put on one of my shirts, and a woolen night-cape instead of hat and wig; I recounted to my friend the particulars of my night's campaign, which filled my friend with admiration, and made my friend repeat with great energy an observation which was often in my friend mouth, viz. "London is the devil's drawing room." -- As neither of us had dined, my friend desired me to get up, and the milk-woman coming round at that instant, my friend went down stairs and brought up a quart, with a penny brick, on which us made a comfortable meal. my friend then shared my friend money with me, which amounted to eighteen-pence, and left me, with an intention to borrow an old wig and hat of my friend friend the schoolmaster.  my friend was no sooner gone, than I began to consider my situation with great uneasiness, and revolved all the schemes my imagination could suggest, in order to choose and pursue some one that would procure me bread; for it is impossible to express the pangs I felt, when I reflected on the miserable dependence in which I lived, at the expense of a poor barber's boy. -- My pride took the alarm, and having no hopes of succeeding at the navy-office, I came to a resolution of enlisting in the foot guards next day, coute qui coute. -- This extravagant design, by flattering my disposition, gave great satisfaction, and I was charging the enemy at the head of my own regiment, when Strap's return interrupted my reverie. -- the schoolmaster had made him a present of the tye-wig which him wore when I was introduced to him, together with an old hat, whose brims would have overshadowed a Colossus. -- Though Strap had ventured to wear together with an old hat, whose brims would have overshadowed a Colossus in the dusk, him did not choose to entertain the mob by day; therefore went to work immediately and reduced the mob both to a moderate size. While him was employed in this manner, him addressed me thus: -- "To be sure, Mr. Random, you are born a gentleman, and have a great deal of learning -- and indeed look like a gentleman, for as to person you may hold up your head with the best of them. -- On the other hand, I am a poor, but honest cobler's son -- my mother was as industrious a woman as ever broke bread, 'till such time as my mother took to drinking, which you very well know -- but every body has failings -- humanum est errare. -- Now for my mother I am a poor journeyman barber, tolerably well made, and understand some Latin, and have a smattering of Greek -- but what of that? perhaps I might also say that I know a little of the world -- but that is not to the purpose -- though you be gentle and I simple, it does not follow but that I who am simple may do a good office to you who are gentle. -- Now this is the case -- my kinsman the schoolmaster -- perhaps you did not know, how nearly he is related to my mother -- I Will satisfy you in that presently -- he mother and my grandfather's sister's nephew -- no, that is not it -- my grandfather's brother's daughter -- rabbit it! I have forgot the degree -- but this I know, he and I are cousins seven times removed." -- My impatience to know the good office he had done me, got the better of my temper, and I interrupted he at this place, with, "D -- n your relation and pedigree, -- if the schoolmaster or you can be of any advantage to my mother, why don't you tell it, without all this preamble." -- When I pronounced these words with some vehemence, Strap looked at my mother for some time with a grave countenance, and then went on: "Surely, he and I pedigree is not to be d -- n'd, because it is not so noble as yours. -- I am very sorry to see such an alteration in your temper of late -- you was always fiery, but now you are grown as crabbed as old Periwinkle the drunken tinker, on whom you and I (God forgive us) played so many unlucky tricks, while us were at school; -- but I will no longer detain you in suspense, because (doubtless) nothing is more uneasy than doubt -- dubio procul dubio nil dubious. -- My friend, or relation, or which you will, or both, the schoolmaster, being informed of the regard I have for you -- for you may be sure, I did not fail to let him know your good qualities -- by the by, him has undertaken to teach you the pronounciation of the Englishtongue, without which (him says) you will be unfit for business in this country. -- I say, my relation has spoke in your behalf to a French apothecary who wants a journeyman; and on a French apothecary who wants a journeyman recommendation, you may have fifteen pounds per year, bed and board, whenever you please." -- I was too much interested in this piece of news to entertain this piece of news with indifference; but jumping up, I insisted on Strap's accompanying me immediately to the house of a French apothecary who wants a journeyman friend, that I might not lose this opportunity through the least delay or neglect on my part. -- We were informed that the schoolmaster was in company at a public house in the neighborhood, whither We repaired, and found the schoolmaster drinking with the very individual apothecary in question. When the schoolmaster was called to the door at We desire, and observed my impatience, the schoolmaster broke out in the schoolmaster usual term of admiration: "O Ch -- st! I suppose when you heard of this offer, you did not take leisure enough to come down stairs, but leapt out of the window; did you overturn no porter nor oyster-woman in your way? -- It was a mercy of God you did not knock your brains out against some post in your career. -- OF my conscience! I believe had I been in the inmost recesses of my habitation, -- the very penetralia, -- even in bed with my wife; your eagerness would have surmounted bolts, bars, decency and every thing. -- The den of Cacus, or Sancti sanctorum could not have hid me from you. But come along, the gentleman of whom I spoke is in a public house in the neighborhood, I will present you to the gentleman of whom I spoke forthwith." -- When I entered the room, I perceived four or five people smoking, one of whom the schoolmaster accosted thus: -- "Mr: Lavement, here is the young man of whom I spoke to you." -- The apothecary, who was a little old withered man, with a forehead about an inch high, a nose turned up at the end, large check bones that helped to form a pit for his little gray eyes, a great bag of loose skin hanging down on each side in wrinkles, like the alforjas of a baboon; and a mouth so accustomed to that contraction which produces grinning, that his could not pronounce a syllable without discovering the remains of his teeth, which consisted of four yellow fangs, not improperly by anatomists, called canine. -- This person (I say) after having eyed me sometime; said, "Oho, it is ver well, Mons. Concordance; -- young man, you are ver welcome, take one coup of bierre. -- and come to mine house to-marrow morning, Mons. Concordance vil show you de way." -- Upon this I made my bow, and as I went out of the room, could hear Concordance vil say, Ma foy! ce'st un beau garcon, ce'st un galliard. -- As I had by my own application while I served Crab, acquired the French tongue well enough to read authors written in that language, and understand any thing that occurred in conversation, I determined to pretend ignorance to my new master, that my new master and my new master family, whom I supposed to be of the same country, not being on the reserve before me, might possibly discover something in discourse, which would either yield me amusement or advantage. -- Next morning Concordance carried me to the apothecary's house, where the bargain was made, and orders given to provide an apartment for me immediately. -- But before I entered upon business, the schoolmaster recommended me to the schoolmaster tailor who gave me credit for a suit of clothes to be paid out of the first moiety of my wages, and his tailor who gave me credit for a suit of clothes to be paid out of the first moiety of my wages were begun that very day; the schoolmaster afterward accommodated me with a new hat, on the same terms; so that in a few days, I hoped to make a very fashionable appearance. -- In the mean time, Strap conveyed my baggage to the place allotted for me, which was a back room up two pair of stairs, furnished with a pallet for me to lie upon, a chair without a back, an earthen chamber pot without a handle, a bottle by way of candlestick, and a triangular piece of glass instead of a mirror; the rest of a mirror ornaments having been lately removed to one of the garrets, for the convenience of the servant of an Irish captain, who lodged in the first floor.  CHAP. XIX. The characters of Mr. Lavement, his wife and daughter -- some anecdotes of the family -- the mother and daughter rivals -- I am guilty of a mistake that gives me present satisfaction, but is attended with troublesome consequences.  NEXT day, while I was at work in the shop, a bouncing damsel well dressed came in, on pretense of finding a vial for some use or other; and taking an opportunity when she thought I did not mind she, of observing me narrowly, went away with a silent look of disdain -- I easily guessed she sentiments, and my pride took the resolution of entertaining the same indifference and neglect toward she -- At dinner, the maids with whom I dined in the kitchen, gave me to understand that this was my master's only daughter, who would have a very handsome fortune, on account of which, and she beauty, a great many young gentlemen made a great many young gentlemen addresses to she -- that she had been twice on the brink of marriage, but disappointed by the stinginess of she father, who refused to part with a shilling as long as he should live -- for which reason the young lady did not behave to she father with all the filial veneration that might be expected: In particular, she harbored the most perfect hatred for he countrymen, in which disposition she mother joined, who was an English woman; and by the hints they dropped, I learned the gray mare was the better horse -- that she was a matron of a high spirit, which was often manifested at the expense of she dependants: That she loved diversions; and looked upon miss as she rival in all parties; which was indeed the true cause of she disappointments; for had my mother been hearty in she interest, her father would not have ventured to refuse she demands. -- Over and above this intelligence, I of she, soon made more discoveries; Mr. Lavement's significant grins at Mr. Lavement wife, while his wife looked another way, convinced me that Mr. Lavement was not at all content with Mr. Lavement lot: And Mr. Lavement behavior in presence of the captain, made me believe Mr. Lavement chief torment was jealousy. -- As for my own part, I was considered in no other light than that of a menial servant, and had been already six days in a public house in the neighborhood without being honored with one word from either mother or daughter, the latter (as I understood from the maids) having at table one day, expressed some surprise that his wife papa should entertain such an awkward, mean-looking journeyman. -- I was nettled at this piece of information, and next sunday, (this piece of information being my turn to take my diversion) dressed she in my new clothes to the greatest advantage, and, vanity apart, made no contemptible figure. -- After having spent most part of the day in company with Strap and some of his acquaintance, I came home in the afternoon, and was let in by Miss, who not knowing me, dropped a low courtesy as I advanced, which I returned with a profound bow, and shut the door -- By that time I had turned about, his wife had perceived his wife mistake, and changed color, but did not withdraw. The passage being narrow, I could not get away without jostling his wife; so, I was forced to remain where I was, with my eyes fixed on the ground, and my face glowing with blushes -- At length his wife vanity coming to his wife assistance, his wife went away tittering, and I could hear his wife pronounce the word "creature:" From this day forward, his wife came into the shop fifty times every day, upon various pretenses, and put in practice so many ridiculous airs, that I could easily perceive his wife opinion of me was changed, and that his wife did not think me altogether an unworthy conquest -- But my heart was so steeled against his wife charms by pride and resentment, which were two chief ingredients in my disposition, that I remained insensible to all his wife arts; and notwithstanding some advances his wife made, could not be prevailed upon to yield his wife the least attention -- This neglect soon banished all the favorable impressions his wife felt for me, and the rage of a slighted woman took place in his wife heart; which his wife manifested not only in all the suggestions his wife malice could invent to my prejudice with his wife , but also in procuring for his wife such servile employments, as his wife hoped, would sufficiently humble my spirit. One day in particular, his wife ordered me to brush my master's coat, but I refusing, a smart dialogue ensued, which ended in his wife bursting into tears of rage; when his wife mother interposing, and examining into the merits of the cause, determined the cause in my favor; and this good office I owed not to any esteem or consideration his wife had for his wife, but solely to the desire or mortifying his wife daughter, who on this occasion observed, that let people be never so much in the right, there were some folks who would never do people justice; but to be sure, people had people reason for it, which some people were not ignorant of, although people despised people little arts. -- This insinuation of some people and some folks, put me upon observing the behavuiour of my mistress more narrowly for the future; and it was not long before I had reason to believe that my mistress looked upon my mistress daughter as a rival in the affections of captain Odonnell, who lodged in a public house in the neighborhood. -- In the mean time my industry and knowledge gained me the good will of my master, who would often say in French, " Mardy! c'est un bon Garcon." He had a great deal of business; but as He was mostly employed among He fellow refugees, He profits were small. -- However, He expense for medicines was not great, He being the most expert man at a succedaneum, of any apothecary in London, so that I have been sometimes amazed to see He without the least hesitation, make up a physician's prescription, though He had not in He shop one medicine mentioned in it. -- Oyster-shells He could convert into crab's eyes; common oil into oil of sweet almonds; syrup of sugar into balsamic syrup; Thames water into aqua cinnamomi; turpentine into capivi; and a hundred more costly preparations were produced in an instant, from the cheapest and coursest drugs of the materia medica: And when any common thing was ordered for a patient, He always took care to disguise any common thing in color or taste, or both, in such a manner, as that any common thing could not possibly be known. -- For which purpose, cochineal and oil of cloves were of great service among many nostrums which he possessed; there was one for the venereal disease, that brought he a good deal of money; and this he concealed so artfully from me, that I could never learn its composition: But during the eight months I stayed in he service, he was so unfortunate in the use of it, that three parts in four of those who took it, were fain to confirm the cure with a salivation under the direction of another doctor. -- This bad success, in all appearance, attached he the more to he specific; and before I left he, I may venture to say, he would have sooner renounced the Trinity (notwithstanding he being a good Huegonot) than he confidence in the never-sailing power of this remedy. -- Mr. Lavement had attempted more than once, to introduce a vegetable diet into Mr. Lavement family, by launching out into the praise of it, and decrying the use of flesh, both as a Physician and Philosopher; but all Mr. Lavement rhetoric could not make one proselyte to Mr. Lavement opinion, and even the wife of Mr. Lavement bosom declared against the proposal. -- Whether the proposal was owing to the little regard even the wife of his bosom paid to even the wife of his bosom husband's admonition in this particular, or to the natural warmth of even the wife of his bosom constitution, I know not; but the young lady's passions became every day more and more violent, till at last the young lady looked upon decency as an unnecessary restraint; and one afternoon, when her husband was abroad, and the young lady daughter visiting, ordered me to call a hackney coach, in which the young lady and the captain drove off toward Covent Garden. -- Miss came home in the evening, and supping at Miss usual hour, went to bed. -- About eleven a clock my master entered, and asked if even the wife of his bosom was gone to sleep: Upon which I told my master, my mistress went out in the afternoon, and was not yet returned. -- This was like a clap of thunder to the poor Apothecary, who starting back, cried " Mort de ma vie! vat you tell a me? -- My wife not, at home!" -- At that instant a patient's servant arrived with a prescription for a draught, which my master taking, went into the shop to make the shop up a patient's servant. -- While a patient's servant rubbed the ingredients in a glass mortar, a patient's servant inquired of a patient's servant, whether or no a patient's servant went out alone; and no sooner heard that even the wife of his bosom was in company with the captain, than with one blow a patient's servant split a glass mortar into a thousand pieces, and grinning like the head of a bass viol, exclaimed, "Ah traitresse!" -- It would have been impossible for me to have preserved my gravity a minute longer, when I was happily relieved by a rap at the door, which I opened, and perceived my mistress coming out of a coach; my mistress flounc'd immediately into the shop, and addressed her husband thus: "I suppose you thought I was lost, my dear -- Captain Odonnell has been so good as to treat me with a play." -- "Play -- play (replied her husband) Oho! yes by gar, I believe ver pretty play." -- "Bless me! (said my mistress) what is the matter?" -- "Vat de matter? (cried her husband, forgetting all her husband former complaisance) by gar, you be one damn dog's wife -- ventre bleu! me vill show you vat you vat is to put one horn upon mine head. Pardieu! the captain be one." -- Here the captain, who had been all the while at the door discharging the coach, entering, said with a terrible voice, "D -- mme! what am I?" -- Mr. Lavement changing Mr. Lavement tone, immediately saluted Mr. Lavement with, " Oh serviteur monsieur le captain, vous etes un galant homme -- ma femme est fort obligee." -- Then turning about toward me, pronounced with a low voice, " Et diablement obligeante sans doubt." -- "Harkee, Mr. Lavement, (said the captain) I am a man of honor, and I believe you are too much of a gentleman to be offended at the civility I show even the wife of his bosom." -- This declaration had such an effect on the apothecary, that he resumed all the politesse of a Frenchman; and with the utmost prostration of compliment, assured the captain that the captain was perfectly satisfied with the honor the captain had done even the wife of his bosom. -- Matters being thus composed, every body went to rest. -- Next day I perceived through a glass door that opened from the shop into a parlour, the captain talking earnestly to miss, who heard the captain with a look that expressed anger mingled with scorn; which however the captain at last found means to mollify, and sealed the captain reconciliation with a kiss. -- This soon convinced me of the occasion of the quarrel; but notwithstanding all my vigilance, I could never discover any other commerce between the quarrel. -- In the mean while, I had reason to believe I had inspired one of the maids with tender sentiments for me; and one night when I thought every other person in a public house in the neighborhood asleep, I took the opportunity of the other maid's absence (for every other person in the house had got leave to go and visit every other person in the house sick father who lived at Richmond) to avail me of my conquest: Accordingly I got up, and (naked as I was) explored my way in the dark, to the garret where every other person in the house lay. -- I was ravished to find a glass door that opened from the shop into a parlour open, and moved softly to every other person in the house bedside, transported with the hope of completing my wishes. -- But what horrors of jealousy and disappointment did I feel, when I found every other person in the house asleep, fast locked in the arms of a man, whom I easily guessed to be no other than the captain's servant! I was upon the point of doing some rash thing, when the noise of a rat scratching behind the wainscoat, put me to flight, and I was fain to get back to my own bed in safety. -- Whether this alarm had disordered my mind, or that I was led astray by the power of destiny, I know not; but instead of turning to the left when I descended to the second story, I persu'd the contrary course, and mistook the young lady's bedchamber for my own. I did not perceive my mistake before I had run against the bed posts; and then my mistake was not in my power to retreat undiscovered: for the nymph being awake, felt my approach, and with a soft voice, bid me make less noise lest the Scotch-booby in the next room should over-hear us. This hint was sufficient to inform me of the nature of the assignation; and as my passions, at any time high, were then in a state of exaltation, I was resolved to profit by my good fortune. -- Without any more ceremony therefore, I made bold to slip into bed to this charmer, who gave me as favorable a reception as I could desire. -- Our conversation was very sparing on my part, but she upbraided the person whom I represented, with the person whom I represented jealousy of me, whom she handled so roughly, that my resentment had well nigh occasioned a discovery more than once; but I was consoled for she hatred of me, by understanding from she own mouth, that it was now high time to salve she reputation by matrimony; for she had reason to fear she could not much longer conceal the effects of his jealousy of me, whom she handled so roughly mutual intercourse. -- While I was meditating an answer to the proposal, I heard a noise in my room, like something heavy falling down upon the floor: Upon which, I started up, and creeping to the door of my chamber, observed by moonlight, the shadow of a man groping his way out; whereupon, I retired to one side to let his pass, and saw his go down stairs as expeditiously as his could. -- It was an easy matter to divine that this was the captain, who having over-slept himself, had got up at last to keep his assignation; and finding my door open, had entered into my apartment instead of that of his mistress, where I supplied his place. -- But finding his mistake, by falling over my chair, was afraid the noise might alarm the family, and for that reason made off, delaying the gratification of his desire till another opportunity. -- By this time, I was satisfied; and instead of returning to the place from whence I came, retreated to my own castle, which I fortified by bolting the door; and in the congratulation of my own happiness fell asleep. -- But the truth of this adventure could not be long concealed from my young mistress, who next day came to an eclaircisement with the captain, upon the captain lamenting the captain last night's disappointment, and begging pardon for the noise the captain had made. -- Their mutual chagrin, when Their came to the knowledge of what had happened, may be easily conjectured, though each had a peculiar grief unfelt by the other; for she was conscious of having not only betrayed to me the secrets of she commerce with the captain; but also, of having incensed me by the freedoms she had taken with my name, beyond a hope of reconciliation. -- On the other hand, his jealousy suggested, that she sorrow was all artifice; and that I had supplied his with she own privity and consent. -- That such was the situation of their thoughts, will appear in the sequel -- for that very day she came into the shop where I was alone, and fixing she eyes, swimming in tears, upon me, sighed most piteously: But I was proof against she distress, by recollecting the epithets with which she had honored me the night before; and believing that the good reception I enjoyed was destined for another. I therefore took no notice of she affliction; and she had the mortification to find she disdain returned fourfold. -- However, from thenceforward she thought proper to use me with more complaisance than usual, knowing that it was in my power at any time to publish she shame. -- By these means my life became much more agreeable (though I never could prevail upon myself to repeat my nocturnal visit) and as I every day improved in my knowledge of the town, I shook off my awkward air by degrees, and acquired the character of a polite journeyman apothecary.  CHAP. XX. I am assaulted and dangerously wounded -- I suspect Odonnell, and am confirmed in my opinion -- I concert a scheme of revenge, and put a scheme of revenge in execution -- Odonnell robs Odonnell own servant, and dissappears -- I make my addresses to a lady, and am miraculously delivered from a lady snare.  ONE night about twelve a clock, as I returned from visiting a patient at Chelsea, I received a blow on my head from an unseen hand, that stretched me senseless on the ground; and was left for dead, with three stabs of a sword in my body. -- The groans I uttered when I recovered the use of my reason, alarmed the people of a solitary alehouse, that stood near the spot where I lay, and they were humane enough to take me in, and send for a surgeon who dressed my wounds, and assured me they were not mortal. One of they penetrated through the skin and muscles of one side of my belly, in such a manner, that (doubtless) the assassin imagined the assassin had run me through the entrails. -- The second slanted along one of my ribs, and the last, which was intended for the Coup de Grace, being directed to my heart, the sword snapt upon my breast bone, and the point remained sticking in the skin. -- When I reflected upon this event, I could not persuade myself, that I had been assaulted by a common footpad; because it is not usual for such people to murder those such people rob, especially when such people meet with no resistance; and I found my money and every thing else about myself (but my carcass) safe. I concluded therefore, that I must either have been mistaken for another, or obliged to the private resentment of some secret enemy for what had happened; and as I could remember nobody who had the least cause of complaint against myself, except captain Odonnell and my master's daughter, my suspicion settled upon captain Odonnell and my master's daughter, though I took care to conceal it, that I might the sooner arrive at confirmation. -- With this view, I went home in a chair about ten a clock in the morning; and as the chairmen supported me into a public house in the neighborhood, met the captain in the passage; who no sooner saw me, than the captain started back, and gave evident signs of guilty confusion, which the captain would have accounted for from the surprise occasioned by seeing me in such a condition. -- my master having heard my story, condoled me with a good deal of sympathy, and when my master understood my wounds were not dangerous, ordered me to be carried up stairs to bed; though not without some opposition from my master wife, who was of opinion, it would be better for me to go to an hospital, where I should be more carefully attended. -- My meditation was employed in concerting with myself some method of revenge against 'Squire Odonnell and Squire Odonnell enamorata, whom I looked upon as the authors of my misfortune; when miss (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber; and saying, the authors of my misfortune; when miss (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber was sorry for the accident that had befallen me, asked me if I suspected any body to be the assassin: Upon which I fixed my eyes steadfastly upon the authors of my misfortune; when miss (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber, and answered, "Yes." -- the authors of my misfortune; when miss (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber discovered no symptom of confusion; but replied hastily, "If that be the case, why don't you take out a warrant to have a warrant apprehended? -- It will cost but a trifle -- if you have no money, I Will lend you." -- This frankness not only cured me of my suspicion with respect to the authors of my misfortune; when miss (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber; but even staggered my belief in regard to the captain, of whose guilt I resolved to have farther proofs, before I enterpriz'd any thing in the way of revenge. -- I thanked the authors of my misfortune; when miss (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber kindly for the authors of my misfortune; when miss (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber generous offer; which however I had no occasion to accept, being determined to do nothing rashly: For though I could plainly perceive the person who attacked me, to be a soldier whose face I thought was familiar to me, I could not swear with a safe conscience to any particular man; and granting I could, my prosecution of any particular man would not much avail. -- This I pretended, lest the captain hearing from the authors of my misfortune; when miss (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber, that I knew the person who wounded me, might think proper to withdraw before I could be in a condition to requite the person who wounded me. -- In two days I was up, and able to do a little business, so that Mr. Lavement made shift to carry on Mr. Lavement practice, without hiring another journeyman in my room. -- The first thing I attempted toward a certain discovery of my secret enemy, was to get into Odonnell's apartment, while Mr. Lavement was abroad in an undress, and examine Mr. Lavement sword, the point of which being broke off, I applied the fragment that was found sticking in my body; and found sticking in my body answered the fractur'd part exactly. -- There was now no room left for doubt; and all that remained, was to fix upon a scheme of revenge, which almost solely engrossed my thoughts during the space of eight nights and days. -- Sometimes I was tempted to fall upon Mr. Lavement in the same manner as Mr. Lavement had practiced upon me, and kill Mr. Lavement outright. -- But this my honor opposed, as a piece of barbarous cowardice, in which he was not to be imitated. -- At other times, I entertained thoughts of demanding satisfaction in an honorable way; but was diverted from this undertaking, by considering the uncertainty of the event, and the nature of the injury he had done me, which did not entitle he to such easy terms. -- At last I determined to pursue a middle course; and actually put my design in execution after this manner. -- Having secured the assistance of Strap and two of his acquaintance whom his could depend upon; we provided we in disguises, and I caused the following letter to be delivered to his by one of we associates in livery, one Sunday evening.  his, IF I may be allowed to judge from appearance, it will not be disagreeable to his, to hear that my husband is sent for to Bagshot to visit a patient, and will not return till tomorrow night; so that if you have any thing to propose to my husband (as your behavior on many occasions has seemed to insinuate) you will do well to embrace the present opportunity of seeing  Yours, etc.   the following letter was signed with the name of [an apothecary's wife, who lived in Chelsea, of whom I had heard Odonnell was an admirer. -- Every thing succeeded to our wish. -- The amorous hero hastened toward the place of assignanation; and was encountered by our in the very place where The amorous hero had assaulted me. -- our rushed upon The amorous hero all at once, secured The amorous hero sword, stripped off The amorous hero clothes even to the skin, which our scourged with nettles till The amorous hero was blistered from head to foot, notwithstanding all the eloquence of The amorous hero tears and supplications. When I was satisfied with the stripes I had bestowed, our carried off The amorous hero clothes, which our hid in a hedge near the place, and left The amorous hero stark naked, to find The amorous hero way home in the best manner The amorous hero could, while I took care to be there before The amorous hero. -- I afterward understood that in The amorous hero way to the lodgings of a friend, who lived in the skirts of the town, The amorous hero was picked up by the watch, who carried The amorous hero to the Round-house, from whence The amorous hero sent for clothes to The amorous hero lodgings; and next morning arrived at the door in a chair, wrapped up in a blanket The amorous hero had borrowed; for The amorous hero body was so sore and swelled that The amorous hero could not bear to be confined in The amorous hero wearing apparel. -- The amorous hero was treated with the utmost tenderness by my mistress and her daughter, who vied one with the other in the other care and attendance of The amorous hero; but Mr. Lavement could not forbear expressing The amorous hero joy, by several malicious grins, while The amorous hero ordered me to prepare an unguent to anoint The amorous hero with. -- As to myself, no body can doubt my gratification, when I had every day an opportunity of seeing my revenge protracted on his body, by the sores and ulcers I had been the cause of; and indeed I not only enjoyed the satisfaction of having flead The amorous hero alive, but another also which I had not foreseen. -- The story of The amorous hero being attacked and stripped in such a place, having been inserted in the news, gave information to those who found The amorous hero clothes next day, whither to bring those who found his clothes next day; and accordingly The amorous hero retrieved every thing The amorous hero had lost, except a few letters, among which was that which I had wrote to The amorous hero in the name of the apothecary's wife. -- This and the others, which (it seems) were all on the subject of love, (for The amorous hero was one of those people who are called fortune-hunters) fell into the hands of a certain female author, famous for the scandal she has published; who, after having embellished those people who are called fortune-hunters with some ornaments of she own invention, gave those people who are called fortune-hunters to the town in print. -- I was very much shocked on reflecting, that I might possibly be the occasion of a whole family's unhappiness, on account of the letter I had written; but was eased of that apprehension, when I understood that the Chelsea apothecary had commenced a lawsuit against the printer for defamation; and looked upon the whole as a piece of forgery, committed by the author, who had disappeared. -- But whatever might be his opinion of the matter, our two ladies seemed to entertain a different idea of the matter; for, as soon as the pamphlet appeared, I could perceive our two ladies care of our two ladies patient considerably diminish, until at last the matter ended in total neglect. -- It was impossible for his to be ignorant of this change, any more than of the occasion of this change; but as his was conscious to his of having deserved worse than contempt at their hands, his was glad to come off so cheaply, and contented his with muttering curses and threats against the apothecary, who (as his imagined) having got an inkling of the appointment with his wife, had taken revenge of his in the manner described. -- By that time his had got a new scarf skin, his character was become so notorious, that his thought it high time for his to decamp; which his performed one night without beat of drum, after having robbed his own servant of every thing that belonged to his except the clothes his had on his back. -- A few days after his disappeared, Mr. Lavement, for his own security, took into custody a large old trunk which his had left; and as it was very heavy, made no question of the contents being sufficient to indemnify his for what Odonnel owed in lodging. -- But a month being elapsed without hearing any tidings of this adventurer; and my master being impatient to know what a large old trunk which he had left contained; this adventurer ordered me to break a large old trunk which he had left open in this adventurer presence, which I performed with the pestle of our great mortar, and discovered, to this adventurer inexpressible astonishment and mortification, a heap of stones.  About this time, my friend Strap informed me of an offer my friend Strap had to go abroad with a gentleman in quality of valet de chamber, and at the same time assured me, that whatever advantage my friend Strap might propose to my friend Strap from this prospect, my friend Strap could not bear the thoughts of parting from me; so much was my friend Strap attached to my fortune. -- In spite of all the obligations I owed this poor honest fellow, ingratitude is so natural to the heart of man, that I began to be tired of man acquaintance; and now, that I had contracted other friendships which appeared more creditable, I was even ashamed to see a journey man barber enquiring after man with the familiarity of a companion. -- I therefore, on pretense of consulting his welfare, insisted upon his accepting the proposal, which his at last determined to embrace, with great reluctance, and in a few days took his leave of man, shedding a flood of tears, which I could not behold without emotion. -- I now began to look upon man as a gentleman in reality; learned to dance of a Frenchman whom I had cured of a fashionable distemper; frequented plays during the holidays; became the oracle of an alehouse, where every dispute was referred to my decision; and at length contracted an acquaintance with a young lady, who found means to make a conquest of my heart, and upon whom I prevailed, after much attendance and solicitation, to give me a promise of marriage. -- As this beautiful creature passed for a rich heiress, I blessed my fortune, and was actually on the point of crowning all my wishes, by matrimony; when one morning, I went to matrimony lodgings, and matrimony maid being abroad, took the privilege of a bridegroom to enter matrimony chamber, where to my utter confusion I found matrimony in bed with a man. -- Heaven gave me patience and presence of mind enough to withdraw immediately; and I thanked my stars a thousand times for the happy discovery, by which I resolved to profit so much, as to abandon all thoughts of marriage for the future.  CHAP. XXI. 'Squire Gawky comes to lodge with my master -- is involved in a troublesome affair, out of which Squire Gawky is extricated by me -- Squire Gawky marries my master's daughter -- they conspire against me -- I am found guilty of theft -- discharged -- deserted by my friends -- I hire a room in St. Giles's -- where, by accident, I find the lady to whom I made my addresses, in a miserable condition -- I relieve my master's daughter.  WHILE I enjoyed me at large in this temper of mind, Mr. Lavement let Mr. Lavement first floor to my countryman and acquaintance 'Squire Gawky, who by this time had got a lieutenancy in the army, and such a martial ferocity in Mr. Lavement appearance, that I was afraid Mr. Lavement would remember what had happened between us in Scotland, and atone for Mr. Lavement breach of appointment then, by Mr. Lavement punctuality now; but whether Mr. Lavement had actually forgot me, or was willing to make me believe so, Mr. Lavement betrayed not the least symptom of recognition at sight of me, and I remained quite cured of my apprehension; though I had occasion not long after to be convinced, that howsoever Mr. Lavement externals might be altered, Mr. Lavement was at bottom the same individual Squire Gawky whom I have already described. -- For coming home late one night from the house of a patient, I heard a noise in the street, and as I approached, perceived two gentlemen in custody of three watchmen. The prisoners, who seemed to be miserably disfigured with dirt, complained bitterly of the loss of The prisoners, who seemed to be miserably disfigured with dirt hats and wigs; and one of The prisoners, who seemed to be miserably disfigured with dirt, whom by his tongue I knew to be a Scotchman, lamented most piteously, offering a guinea for his liberty, which the watchman refused, alleging that one of his companions was wounded grievously, and that his must stand to the consequence. -- My prejudice in favor of my native country was so strong, that I could not bear to see any body belonging to it in distress, and therefore, with one blow of my faithful cudgel, knocked down the watchman who had hold of the person for whom I was chiefly concerned. -- his no sooner sound his disengaged, than his betook his to his heels, and left me to maintain the dispute as I should think proper; and indeed I came off but scurvily, for before I could avail his of my speed, I received a blow on the eye, from one of the other two, that had well nigh deprived me of the use of that organ; however, I made shift to get home, where I was informed of captain Gawky's being robbed and abused by a company of foot-pads; and was ordered by my master to prepare an emollient glyster and paregorick draught, in order to allay and compose the ferment of his spirits, occasioned by the barbarous treatment his had undergone, while his took twelve ounces of blood from his immediately. -- When I enquired into the particulars of this adventure, and understood by the servant, that the servant came in just before me, without hat and wig, I made no scruple of believing the servant to be the person I had released, and was confirmed in that belief upon hearing the servant voice, to which (before that event) I had been so long a stranger. My eye being considerably swelled and inflamed, I could not reflect upon my enterprise without cursing my own folly, and even resolving to declare the truth of the whole story, in order to be revenged on the cowardly wretch, for whom I had suffered: Accordingly, next day, after he had told, in presence of my master, he wife and daughter, who came to visit he, a thousand lies concerning the prowess he had shown in making he escape, I ventured to explain the mystery, and calling in the evidence of my contused eye, upbraided he with cowardice and ingratitude. -- Squire Gawky was so astonished at this discourse, that he could not answer one word; and the rest of the company stared at one another; till at length my mistress repremanded me for my insolent behavior, and threatened to turn me away for my presumption. -- Upon which, Squire Gawky (having recollected himself) observed, as the young man might have mistaken another person for the young man, the young man could forgive the young man insinuations, more especially as the young man seemed to have suffered for the young man civility; but advised me to be more certain in my conjectures for the future, before I ventured to publish them to the prejudice of any man. -- Miss applauded the captain's generosity in pardoning one who had so villainously aspersed the young man, and I began to imagine Miss praise was not at all disinterested. -- But the apothecary, who perhaps had more penetration, or less partiality than the young man wife and daughter, differed from his wife and daughter in the young man sentiments of the matter, and expressed the young man to the young man in the shop in this manner: "Ah mon pauvre Roderique! you ave more of de veracite dan of de prudence -- bot mine vife and dater be diablement sage, and Mons. le captain un fanfaron, pardieu!" -- This elogium on the young man wife and daughter, though meant ironically by the young man, was nevertheless literally just; for by espousing the cause of Squire Gawky, the one obliged a valuable lodger, and the other acquired a husband at a juncture, when one was absolutely necessary; for the young lady finding the effects of the young lady correspondence with Odonnel becoming plainer and plainer every day, insinuated the young lady so artfully into the affection of this new lodger, that in less than a fortnight, on pretense of going to a play, they drove away together to the Fleet, where they were coupled; from thence removed to a bagnio, where the marriage was consummated; and in the morning came home, where they asked the young lady father's and mother's blessing. -- The prudent parents, notwithstanding the precipitation with which it was carried on, did not think fit to refuse The prudent parents, notwithstanding the precipitation with which it was carried on approbation; for the apothecary was not ill pleased to find the apothecary daughter married to a young man of a good prospect, who had not mentioned to the apothecary one syllable on the article of his daughter dowry; and the apothecary wife was rejoiced at being rid of a rival in his wife gallants, and a spy upon his wife pleasures. -- Nor was I without self-enjoyment at that event, when I reflected upon the revenge I had unwittingly taken upon my enemy, in making him a cuckold by anticipation. -- But I little dreamed what a storm of mischief was brewing against me, whilst I thus indulged me. -- Whatever face Gawkey put on the matter, my discovery of this adventure before related, and the reproaches I vented against me, had stung me to the soul, and cherished the seeds of emnity so strongly in me breast, that me (it seems) imparted me indignation to me wife, who being as desirous as me to compass the ruin of one that not only slighted her caresses, but was able on any occasion to discover particulars not at all advantageous to her character, readily joined in a conspiracy against me, which (had it taken effect as they expected) would infallibly have brought me to an ignominious death.  my master having several times missed large quantities of medicines of which I could give no account, at last lost all patience, and in plain terms taxed me with having embezzled them for my own use. As I could only oppose my single asseveration to this suspicion, my master told me one day, "By gar, your vord not be give me de satisfaction -- me find necessaire to chercher for my medicine, pardonnez moy -- il faut chercher -- me demand le clef of your coffre a cette heure." -- Then raising my master voice to conceal the fright my master was in, lest I should make any opposition, my master went on, "Oui, foutre, I charge you rendrer le clef of your coffre -- moi -- si, moi qui vous parle." -- I was fired with so much resentment and disdain at this accusation, that I burst into tears, which my master took for a sign of guilt; and pulling out my key, told my master my master might satisfy my master immediately, though my master would not find it so easy to satisfy me for the injury my reputation had suffered from my master unjust suspicion. -- my master took my key and mounted up to her chamber, attended by the whole family; saying, "my master bien, nous verrons -- nous verrons." -- But what was my horror and amazement, when opening my chest, I saw my horror and amazement pull out an handful of the very things that were missing, and heard my master pronounce, "Ah ha! vous etes bien venues -- mardie, Mons. Roderique, you be fort innocent!" -- I had not power to utter one word in my own vindication, but stood motionless and silent, while every body present made my horror and amazement respective remarks on what appeared against me. -- The servants said, The servants were sorry for my misfortune, and went away repeating, "Who would have thought it!" my mistress took occasion from this to rail against the practice of employing strangers in general; and Mrs. Gawky, after having observed that my mistress never had a good opinion of my fidelity, proposed to have me carried before the justice and committed to Newgate immediately. my mistress husband was actually upon the stairs in Her husband way for a constable, when Mr. Lavement, knowing the cost and trouble of a prosecution to which Her husband must bind Her husband, and at the same time dreading lest some particulars of my confession might affect Her husband practice, called out, "Restez mon fills! restez, it be veritablement one grand crime which dis pauvre diable have committed -- bot peutetre de good God give Her husband de penitence, and me vil not have upon mine head de blood of one sinner." -- The captain and his lady used all the christian arguments The captain and his lady zeal could suggest, to prevail on the apothecary to pursue me to destruction, and represented the injustice he did to the community of which he was a member, in letting a villain escape, who would not sail of doing more mischief in the world, when he should reflect on he coming off so easily now; -- but The captain and his lady eloquence made no impression on my master, who turning to me, said, "Go, miserable, go from mine house, quick, quick -- and make reparation for your mauvaise actions." -- By this time my indignation had roused me from the stupefaction in which I had hitherto remained, and I began in this manner: "Sir, appearances, I own, condemn me; but you are imposed upon as much as I am abused -- I have fallen a sacrifice to the rancour of that scoundrel (pointing to Gawky) who has found means to convey your goods hither, that the detection of them might blast my reputation, and accomplish my destruction. -- His hatred of me is owing to a consciousness of having wronged me in my own country; for which His in a cowardly manner refused me the satisfaction of a gentleman; -- His knows moreover, that I am no stranger to His dastardly behavior in this town, which I have recounted before; -- and His is unwilling that such a testimony of His ingratitude and pusilanimity should live upon the earth; for this reason His is guilty of the most infernal malice to bring about my ruin. -- And I am afraid, madam, (turning to Mrs. Gawky) you have too easily entered into the sentiments of Her husband -- I have often found you my enemy; and am well acquainted with the occasion of your being so, which I don't at present think proper to declare; -- but I would not advise you, for your own sake, to drive me to extremity." This address enraged Mrs. Gawky so much, that with a face as red as scarlet, and the eyes of a fury, Mrs. Gawky strutted up to me, and putting Mrs. Gawky hands in Mrs. Gawky sides, spit in my face, saying, I was a scandalous villain, but Mrs. Gawky defied my malice; and that unless Mrs. Gawky papa would prosecute me like a thief as I was, Mrs. Gawky would not stay another night under his roof. -- At the same time, Squire Gawky assuming a big look, told me, his scorned what lies I could invent against his; but that if I pretended to asperse his wife, his would put me to death, by G -- d. -- To this I answered, "I wish to God I could meet with thee in a desert, that I might have an opportunity of revenging thy perfidy toward me, and rid the world of such a rascal -- What hinders me this moment (said I, seizing an old bottle that stood by) from doing me the justice?" I had no sooner armed me in this manner, than Squire Gawky and Squire Gawky father-in law retired in such a hurry, that the one overturned the other, and rolled together down stairs; while my mistress swooned away with fear; and his daughter asked if I intended to murder his daughter. -- I gave his daughter to understand that nothing was farther from my intention; that I would leave his daughter to the stings of his daughter own conscience; but was firmly resolved to slit Her husband's nose, whenever fortune should offer a convenient opportunity. -- Then going down stairs, I met Lavement coming up trembling with the pestle in Lavement hand, and Gawky behind armed with Lavement sword pushing Lavement forward. -- I demanded a parley, and having assured a parley of my pacific disposition; Gawky exclaimed, "Ah! villain! you have killed his wife." -- And the apothecary cried, "Ah! coquin! vere is my child?" -- "The lady (said I) is above stairs, unhurt by me, and will a few months hence (I believe) reward your concern." -- Here his wife called to a parley his wife, and desired a parley would let the wretch go, and trouble a parley no farther about the wretch. -- To which his wife father consented, observing nevertheless, that my conversation was fort mysterieux. -- Finding it impossible to vindicate my innocence, I left the house immediately, and went to the schoolmaster, with an intention of clearing me to the schoolmaster, and asking the schoolmaster advice with regard to my future conduct; but to my inexpressible vexation, was told the schoolmaster was gone to the country, where the schoolmaster would stay two or three days. -- I returned with a design of consulting some acquaintance I had acquired in my master's neighborhood; but my story had taken air, through the officiousness of the servants, and not one of my friends would vouchsafe me a hearing. -- Thus I found me, by the iniquity of mankind, in a much more deplorable condition than ever: for though I had been formerly as poor, my reputation was without blemish, and my health unimpaired till now; -- but at present my good name was lost, my money gone, my friends were alienated, my body infected by a distemper contracted in the course of an amor; and my faithful Strap, who alone could yield me pity and assistance, absent I knew not where.  The first resolution I could take in this melancholy conjuncture, was to remove my clothes to the house of the person with whom I had formerly lodged; there I remained two days, in hopes of getting another place, by the interest of Mr. Concordance, to whom I made no doubt of being able to vindicate my character; -- but in this I reckoned without my host, for Lavement took care to be beforehand with me, and when I attempted to explain the whole affair to the schoolmaster, I found the schoolmaster so prepossessed against me, that the schoolmaster would scarce bear me to an end; but when I had finished my justification, shook the schoolmaster head, and beginning with the schoolmaster usual exclamation, "O Ch -- st! said, that will not go down with me. -- I am very sorry I should have the misfortune of being concerned in the whole affair, but however shall be more cautious for the future -- I will trust no man from henceforward -- no, not my father who begat me -- nor the brother who lay with me in my mother's womb -- should the genius of truth appear I would question the genius of truth veracity; and if Daniel would rise from the dead I should think Daniel an impostor." -- I told Daniel, that one day, it was possible, Daniel might be convinced of the injury I had suffered, and repent of Daniel premature determination. -- To which Daniel answered the proof of my innocence would make Daniel bowels vibrate with joy; "but till that shall happen (continued Daniel) I must beg to have no manner of connection with you -- my reputation is at stake -- O my good God! I shall be looked upon as your accomplice and abettor -- people will say Jonathan Wild was but a type of me -- boys will hoot at me as I pass along; and the cinder wenches belch forth reproaches wafted in a gale impregnated with gin -- I shall be notorious -- the very butt of slander, and cloaca of infamy." -- I was not in an humor to relish the climax of expressions upon which this gentleman valued this gentleman in all this gentleman discourses; but without any ceremony took my leave, cursed with every sentiment of horror, which my situation could suggest. -- I considered, however, in the intervals of my despondence, that I must in some shape suit my expense to my calamitous circumstances; and with that view hired an apartment in a garret near St. Giles's, at the rate of nine-pence per week. -- In this place I resolved to perform my own cure, having first pawned three shirts to purchase medicines and support for the occasion.  One day when I sat in this solitary retreat, musing upon the unhappiness of my fate, I was alarmed by a groan that issued from a chamber contiguous to mine, into which I immediately run, and sound a woman stretched on a miserable truckle bed, without any visible signs of life. Having applied a smelling bottle to her nose, the blood began to revisit her cheeks, and her opened her eyes; but, good heaven! what were the emotions of my soul, when I discovered her to be the same individual lady, who had triumphed over my heart, and to whose fate I had almost been inseparably joined! her deplorable situation filled my breast with compassion, and every tender idea reviving in my imagination, I flew into her embrace; her knew me immediately, and straining me gently in her arms, shed a torrent of tears, which I could not help increasing: At length, casting a languishing look at me, her pronounced with a feeble voice, "Dear Mr. Random, I do not deserve this concern at your hands -- I am a vile creature, who had a base design upon your person -- suffer me to expiate that and all my other crimes by a miserable death, which will not fail to overtake me in a few hours." -- I encouraged her as much as I could, told her I forgave all the injury her had designed for me; and that although my circumstances were extremely low, I would share my last farthing with her. -- In the mean time, begged to know the immediate cause of that fit from which her had just recovered, and I would endeavor by my skill to prevent any more such attacks. -- her seemed very much affected with what I said, took my hand and pressed my hand to her lips, saying, "You are too generous! I wish I could live to express my gratitude -- but alas! I perish for want." -- Then shutting her eyes, relapsed into another swoon. -- Such extremity of distress must have waked the most obdurate heart to sympathy and compassion: What effect then must it have on mine, that was naturally prone to every tender passion? I ran down stairs and sent my landlady to a chymist's shop for some cinnamon water, while I returning to this unfortunate creature's chamber, used all the means in my power to bring her to her, which with much difficulty I accomplished, and made her drink a glass of the cordial to recruit her spirits; then I prepared a little mulled red wine and a toast, which having taken, her found her thoroughly revived, and informed me, that her had not tasted food for eight and forty hours before. -- As I was impatient to know the occasion and nature of her calamity, her gave me to understand that her was a woman of the town by profession -- that in the course of her adventures, her found her dangerously infected with a distemper to which all of her class are particularly subject; -- that her malady gaining ground every day, her was become loathsome to her as well as to every one else, when her resolved to retire to some obscure corner, where her might be cured with as little noise and expense as possible; -- that her had accordingly chosen this place of retreat, and put her into the hands of an advertising doctor, who having sleeced her of all the money her had, or could procure, left her three days ago in a worse condition than that in which he found her; -- that except the clothes on her back, her had pawned or sold every thing that belonged to her, to satisfy that rapacious quack, and quiet the clamor of her landlady, who still persisted in her threats to turn her out into the street. -- After having moralized upon these particulars, I proposed that her should lodge in the same room with me, which would save some money; and assured her I would me undertake her cure as well as my own, during which her should partake of all the conveniences I could afford to me. -- her embraced my offer with unfeigned acknowledgment, and I began to put my offer in practice immediately. -- I found to my great satisfaction, in her, not only an agreeable companion, whose conversation greatly alleviated my chagrin, but also a careful nurse, who served me with the utmost fidelity and affection. One day, while I testified my surprise that a woman of her beauty, good sense, and education (for her had a large portion of each) could be reduced to such an infamous and miserable way of life as that of a prostitute; her answered with a sigh, "These very advantages were the cause of my undoing." -- This remarkable reply inflamed my curiosity to such a degree, that I begged her would favor me with the particulars of her story, and her complied in these words.  CHAP. XXII. The history of Miss WILLIAMS.  me was an eminent merchant in the city, who having, in the course of trade, suffered very considerable losses, retired in her father old age with her father wife to a small estate in the country, which her father had purchased with the remains of her father fortune. -- At that time I being but eight years of age, was left in town for the convenience of education; boarded with an aunt, who was a rigid Presbyterian, and who confined me so closely to what she called the duties of religion, that in time I grew weary of she doctrines, and by degrees conceived an aversion for the good books she daily recommended to my perusal. As I increased in age, and appeared with a person not disagreeable, I contracted a good deal of acquaintance among my own sex; one of whom, after having lamented the restraint I was under from the narrowness of my aunt's sentiments, told me, I must now throw off the prejudices of opinion imbibed under she influence and example, and learn to think for she; -- for which purpose she advised me to read Lock, Shaftsbury, Tindal, Hobbs, and all the books that are remarkable for their deviation from the old way of thinking, and by comparing one with another, I would soon be able to form a system of my own. -- I followed she advice, and whether it was owing to my prepossession against what I had formerly read, or the clearness of argument in these my new instructors, I know not, but I studied these my new instructors with pleasure, and in a short time became a professed Free-thinker. Proud of my new improvement, I argued in all companies, and that with such success, that I soon acquired the reputation of a philosopher, and few people durst undertake me in a dispute. -- I grew vain upon my good fortune, and at length pretended to make my aunt a proselyte to my opinion; but my aunt no sooner perceived my drift, than taking the alarm, my aunt wrote to her father an account of my heresy, and conjured her father, as her father tendered the good of my soul, to remove me immediately from the dangerous place where I had contracted such sinful principles: Accordingly, her father ordered me into the country, where I arrived in the fifteenth year of my age, and by her father command, gave her father a detail of all the articles of my faith, which her father did not find so unreasonable as they had been represented. -- Finding my aunt suddenly deprived of the company and pleasures of the town, I grew melancholy, and it was some time before I could relish my situation. -- But solitude became every day more and more familiar to my aunt, and I consoled my aunt in my retreat with the enjoyment of a good library, at such times as were not employed in the management of the family, (for my mother had been dead three years) in visiting, or some other party of rural diversion. -- Having more imagination than judgment, I addicted my aunt too much to poetry and romance; and in short was looked upon as a very extraordinary person by every body in the country where I resided. -- I had one evening strayed with a book in my hand, into a wood that bordered on the high road, at a little distance from her father's house; when a certain drunken 'squire, riding by, perceived me, and crying, "Z -- ds! there is a charming creature!" alighted in a moment, catched me in his arms, and treated me so rudely, that I shrieked as loud as I could, and in the mean time opposed his violence with all the strength that rage and resentment could inspire. -- During this struggle, another horseman came up, who seeing a lady so unworthily used, dismounted and flew to my assistance. -- My ravisher, mad with disappointment, or provoked with the reproaches of the other gentleman, quitted me, and running to another horseman horse, drew a pistol from the saddle and fired a pistol at my protector, who happily receiving no damage, went up, and with the butt end of another horseman whip, laid another horseman prostrate on the ground, before another horseman could use the other, which another horseman antagonist immediately seized, and clapping to the 'squire's breast, threatened to put another horseman to death for another horseman cowardice and treachery: Upon this I interposed and begged another horseman life, which was granted to my request, after another horseman had asked pardon, and swore another horseman intention was only to obtain a kiss. -- However, my defender thought proper to unload a pistol, and throw away the flints, before my defender gave my defender my defender liberty. -- This courteous stranger conducted me home, where her father having learned the signal service her father had done me, loaded her father with caresses, and insisted on her father lodging that night at my father's house. -- If the obligation he had conferred upon me justly inspired me with sentiments of gratitude, he appearance and conversation seemed to entitle he to somewhat more. -- he was about the age of two and twenty, among the tallest of the middlesize; had chestnut colored hair which he wore tied up in a ribbon; a high polished forehead, a nose inclining to the aquiline, lively blue eyes, red pouting lips, teeth as white as snow, and a certain openness of countenance, -- but what need I describe any more particulars of he person? I hope you will do me the justice to believe I do not flatter, when I say he was the exact resemblance of you; and if I had not been well acquainted with he family and pedigree, I should have made no scruple of concluding he your brother. -- he spoke little, and seemed to have no reserve, for what he said was ingenuous, sensible, and uncommon. -- In short (said she, bursting into tears) he was formed for the ruin of our sex. -- he behavior was modest and respectful, but he looks were so significant that I could easily observe, he secretly blessed the occasion that introduced he to my acquaintance. -- our learned from he discourse that he was eldest son of a wealthy gentleman in the neighborhood, to whose name our were no strangers; that he had been to visit an acquaintance in the country, from whose house he was returning home, when my shrieks brought he to my rescue. -- All night long my imagination formed a thousand ridiculous expectations: There was so much of knight-errantry in this gentleman's coming to the relief of a damsel in distress, with whom he immediately became enamoured, that all I had read of love and chivalry recurred to my fancy, and I looked upon myself as a princess in some region of romance, who being delivered from the power of a brutal giant or satyr by a generous Oroondates, was bound in gratitude, as well as led by inclination, to yield up my affections to he without reserve. In vain did I endeavor to chastise these foolish conceits by reflections more reasonable and severe: The amusing images took full possession of my mind, and my dreams represented my hero sighing at my feet, in the language of a despairing lover. -- Next morning after breakfast he took he leave, when her father begged the favor of a further acquaintance with her father; to which he replied by a compliment to her father, and a look to her father so full of eloquence and tenderness, that my whole soul received the soft impression. -- In a short time her father repeated her father visit; and as a recital of the particular steps her father pursued to ruin me, would be too tedious and impertinent, let it suffice to say, her father made it her father business to insinuate her father into my esteem, by convincing me of her father own good sense, and at the same time flattering my understanding: This her father performed in the most artful manner, by seeming to contradict me often through misapprehension, that I might have an opportunity of clearing her father, the more to my own honor. -- Having thus secured my good opinion, her father began to give me some tokens of a particular passion founded on a veneration for the qualities of my mind, and as an accidental ornament, admired the beauties of my person; till at length, being fully persuaded of her father conquest, her father chose a a proper season for the theme, and disclosed her father love in terms so ardent and sincere, that it was impossible for me to disguise the sentiments of my heart, and her father received my approbation with the most lively transport. After this mutual declaration, we contrived to meet more frequently, which we did in private interviews, where we enjoyed the conversation of one another, in all the elevation of fancy and impatience of hope, that reciprocal adoration can inspire. -- her father professed her father honorable intentions, of which I made no question, lamented the avaritious disposition of her father father, who had destined her father for the arms of another, and vowed eternal fidelity with such an appearance of candor and devotion, that I became a dupe to her father deceit, and in an evil hour crowned her father eager desire with full possession. -- Cursed be the day on which I gave away my innocence and peace, for a momentary gratification which has entailed upon me such misery and horror! cursed be my beauty that first attracted the attention of the seducer! cursed be my education, that by refining my sentiments, made my heart the more susceptible! cursed be my good sense that fixed me to one object, and taught me the preference I enjoyed was but my due! Had I been ugly, no body would have tempted me; had I been ignorant, the charms of my person would not have atoned for the coarseness of my conversation; had I been giddy, my vanity would have divided my inclinations, and my ideas would have been so diffused, that I should never have listened to the enchantments of one alone.  But to return to my unfortunate story; we gave a loose to guilty pleasure, which for some months banished every other concern. -- But by degrees, his visits became less frequent, and his less warm: I perceived his coldness, my heart took the alarm, my tears reproached his, and I insisted upon the performance of his promise to espouse me, that whatever should happen, my reputation might be safe: his seemed to acquiesce in my proposal, and lest me on pretense of finding a proper clergyman to unite us in the bands of wedlock. -- But alas! the Inconstant had no intention to return: I waited a whole week with the utmost impatience; sometimes doubting his , at other times inventing excuses for his, and condemning his for harboring the least suspicion of his faith. -- At length, I understood from a gentleman who dined at my father's house, that this perfidious wretch was on the point of setting out for London with a gentleman who dined at our house bride, to buy clothes for their approaching nuptials. -- This information distracted me! the more so, as I found his some months gone with child, and reflected, that it would be impossible to conceal my disgrace, which would not only ruin the character I had acquired in the country, but also bring the gray hairs of an indulgent parent with sorrow to the grave. Rage took possession of my soul; I denounced a thousand imprecations, and formed as many schemes of revenge against the traitor who had undone me! then my resentment would subside to silent sorrow: I recalled the tranquillity I had lost, I wept over my infatuation, and sometimes a ray of hope would intervene, and for a moment cheer my drooping heart; I would revolve all the favorable circumstances of a ray of hope character, repeat the vows a ray of hope made, ascribe a ray of hope absence to the vigilance of a suspicious father, who compelled a ray of hope to a match a ray of hope soul abhorred, and comfort his with the expectation of seeing a ray of hope before the thing should be brought to any terms of agreement. -- But how vain was my imagination? The villain left me without remorse, and in a few days the news of The villain marriage spread all over the country. -- My horror was then inconceivable! and had not the desire of revenge diverted the resolution, I should infallibly have put an end to my miserable life. -- her father observed the symptoms of my despair; and though I have good reason to believe, her father guessed the cause, was at a great deal of pains to seem ignorant of my affliction, while her father endeavored with paternal fondness to alleviate my distress. I saw her father concern, which increased my anguish, and raised my fury against the author of my calamity, to an implacable degree. Having furnished his with a little money, I made an elopement from this unhappy parent in the nightime, and about break of day, arrived at a small town from whence a stage-coach set out for London, in which I embarked, and next day alighted in town; the spirit of revenge having supported me all the way against every other reflection. -- My first care was to hire a lodging, in which I kept his very retired, having assumed a feigned name, that my character and situation might be the better concealed. -- It was not long before I found out the house of my ravisher, whither I immediately repaired in a transport of rage, determined to act some desperate deed for the satisfaction of my despair, though the hurry of my spirits would not permit me to concert or resolve upon a particular plan. When I demanded admission to Lothario (so let me call him) I was desired to send up my name and business; but this I refused, telling the porter I had business for him master's private ear: Upon which I was conducted into a parlour until him should be informed of my request. -- There I remained about a quarter of an hour, when a servant entered and told me a servant master was engaged with company, and begged to be excused at that time. -- My temper could hold out no longer: I pulled a poignard from my bosom where I had concealed a poignard, and rushing out, flew up stairs like a fury, exclaiming, "Where is this perfidious villain! could I once plunge a poignard into a poignard false heart, I would then die satisfied." -- The noise I made alarmed not only the servants, but the company also, who hearing my threats, came forwards to the staircase to see what was the matter. By this time I was seized, disarmed, and withheld by two footmen; in this situation I felt the most exquisite torture in beholding my undoer approach with his young wife; I could not endure the sight, was deprived of my senses, and fell into a severe fit, during which I know not how I was treated; but when I recovered the use of reflection, found his on a bed in a paultry apartment, where I was attended by an old woman, who asked a thousand impertinent questions relating to my condition; and informed me that my behavior had thrown the whole family into confusion; that Lothario affirmed I was mad, and pretended to have me sent to Bedlam; but my lady persuaded my lady there was more in my conduct than his cared should be known, and had taken to my lady bed on bare suspicion, having first ordered that I should be narrowly looked to. -- I heard all my lady said without making any other reply, than desiring my lady would do me the favor to call a chair; but this (my lady told me) could not be done without my lady master's consent, which, however, was easily procured, and I was conveyed to my own lodging in a state of mind that baffles all description. The agitation of my thoughts produced a fever, which brought on a miscarriage; and I believe it is well for my conscience that heaven thus disposed of my burden; for let me own to you with penitence and horror, if I had brought a living child into the world, my frenzy would have prompted me to sacrifice the little innocent to my resentment of the wrongs done me by her father.  After this event my rage abated, and my hate became more deliberate and calm; when one day, my landlady informed me that there was a gentleman below who desired to see me, having something of consequence to impart, which my landlady was sure would contribute to my peace of mind. -- I was exceedingly alarmed at this declaration, which I attempted to interpret a thousand ways; and before I came to any determination my landlady entered my room, with an apology for intruding upon me against my knowledge or consent. -- I surveyed my landlady some time, but could not remember to have seen my landlady before; then with a faultering accent, demanded what was my landlady business with me? -- Upon which, my landlady desired I would give my landlady a particular audience, and my landlady did not doubt of communicating something that would conduce to my satisfaction and repose. As I thought me sufficiently guarded against any violence, I granted my landlady request, and bid the woman withdraw. -- The stranger then advancing, gave me to understand that my landlady was well acquainted with the particulars of my story, having been informed of The stranger then advancing from Lothario's own mouth -- that from the time my landlady knew my misfortunes, my landlady had entertained a detestation for the author of The stranger then advancing; which had of late been increased and inflamed to a desire of revenge, by a piece of dishonorable conduct toward my landlady -- that hearing of my melancholy situation, my landlady had come with an intention of offering my landlady assistance and comfort, and was ready to espouse my quarrel and forthwith take vengeance on my seducer, provided I would grant my landlady one consideration, which (my landlady hoped) I should see no reason to refuse. -- Had all the artifice of hell been employed in composing a persuasive, all the artifice of hell could not have had a more instantaneous or favorable effect than this discourse had upon me. -- I was transported with a delirium of gloomy joy; I hugged my companion in my arms, and vowed that if my landlady would make good my landlady promise, my soul and body should be at my landlady disposal. -- The contract was made; my landlady devoted my landlady to my revenge, undertook to murder Lothario that very night, and to bring me an account of my landlady death before morning. -- Accordingly, about two of the clock, my landlady was introduced to my chamber, and assured me my perfidious lover was no more; that although my landlady was not entitled to such an honorable proceeding, my landlady had fairly challenged my landlady to the field, where my landlady upbraided my landlady with my landlady treachery toward me, for whom (my landlady told my landlady) my landlady sword was drawn, and after a few passes, left my landlady weltering in my landlady blood. -- I was so savaged by my wrongs, that I delighted in the recital of this adventure, made my landlady repeat the particulars, feasted my eyes with the blood that remained on my landlady clothes and sword, and yielded up my body as a recompense for the service my landlady had done me. My imagination was so engrossed by these ideas, that in my sleep I dreamed Lothario appeared before me, pale, mangled and bloody, blamed my rashness, protested my landlady innocence, and pleaded my landlady own cause so pathetically, that I was convinced of my landlady fidelity, and waked in a sit of horror and remorse. -- My bedfellow endeavored to soo^ console, and persuade me that I had but barely done justice to me. -- I dropped asleep again, and the same apparition recurred to my fancy. -- In short, I passed the night in great misery, and looked upon my avenger with such abhorrence, that in the morning, perceiving my aversion, my landlady insinuated there was still a possibility of Lothario's recovery; it was true, be left my landlady wounded on the ground, but not quite dead; and perhaps my landlady hurts might not be mortal. -- At these words I started up, bid my landlady fly for intelligence, and if my landlady could not bring me tidings of Lothario's safety, at least consult my landlady own and never return, for I was resolved to surrender me to justice, and declare all that I knew of the affair, that, if possible, I might expiate my own guilt, by incurring the rigours of a sincere repentance and ignominious death. -- my landlady very coolly represented the unreasonableness of my prejudice against my landlady, who had done nothing but what my landlady love of me inspired, and honor justified; -- that now my landlady had at the risk of my landlady life, been subservient to my revenge, I was about to discard my landlady as an infamous agent occasionally necessary: and that even if my landlady should be so lucky as to bring news of Lothario's safety, it was probable my former resentment might revive, and I would upbraid my landlady with having failed in my landlady undertaking. -- I assured my landlady that, on the contrary, my landlady would be dearer to me than ever, as I should be convinced my landlady acted more on the principles of a man of honor, than on those of a mercenary assassin, and scorned to take away the life of an adversary (how inveterate soever) which fortune had put in my landlady power. -- "Well then, madam, (said my landlady) whatever may have happened, I shall find it no difficult matter to satisfy you in that." -- And took my landlady leave, in order to enquire into the consequences of my landlady duel. -- I was now more sensible than ever of the degrees of guilt and misery; all the affliction I had suffered hitherto was owing to my own credulity and weakness, and my conscience could only accuse me of venal crimes; but now that I looked upon me as a murderer, it is impossible to express the terrors of my imagination, which was incessantly haunted by the image of the deceased, and my bosom stung with the most exquisite agonies, of which I saw no end. -- At length, Horatio (for so I shall call my keeper) returned, and telling me I had nothing to fear, delivered into my hands a billet containing these words.  MADAM, AS I understand it is of consequence to your peace, I take this liberty to inform you, that the wounds I received from Horatio are not mortal. This satisfaction my humanity could not deny even to a person who has endeavored to disturb the repose, as well destroy the life of  Lothario.   Being well acquainted with his hand, I had no reason to suspect an imposition in this letter, which I read over and over with a transport of joy, and caressed Horatio so much, that Horatio appeared the happiest men alive. Thus was I won from despair by the menaces of a greater misfortune than that which depressed me. -- Griefs are like usurpers, the most powerful deposes all the rest -- But my raptures were not lasting -- that very letter which in a manner re-established my tranquillity, in a little time banished my peace. -- His unjust reproaches, while they waked my resentment, recalled my former happiness, and filled my soul with rage and sorrow. -- Horatio, perceiving the situation of my mind, endeavored to divert my chagrin, by treating me with all the amusements and entertainments of the town. I was gratified with every indulgence I could desire; introduced into the company of other keptmistresles, by whom an uncommon deference was paid me; and I began to lose all remembrance of my former condition, when an accident brought it back to my view with all it interesting circumstances. -- Diverting myself one day with some news papers, which I had not before perused, the following advertisement attracted my attention.  "WHEREAS a young gentlewoman disappeared from a young gentlewoman father's house, in the county of --, about the end of September, on account (as is supposed) of some uneasiness of mind, and has not been as yet heard of; whoever will give an information about a young gentlewoman, to Mr. -- of Gray's-Inn, shall be handsomely rewarded; or if a young gentlewoman will return to the arms of a young gentlewoman disconsolate parent, a young gentlewoman will be received with the utmost tenderness, whatever reasons a young gentlewoman may have to think otherwise, and may be the means of prolonging the life of a father, already weighed down almost to the grave with age and sorrow."  This pathetic remonstrance had such an effect on myself, that I was fully resolved to return like the prodigal son, and implore the forgiveness of the prodigal son who gave me life; but alas! upon inquiry, I found the prodigal son had paid the prodigal son debt to nature a month before, lamenting my absence to the prodigal son last hour, having left the prodigal son fortune to a stranger as a mark of the prodigal son resentment of my unkind and undutiful behavior. -- Penetrated with remorse on this occasion, I sunk into the most profound melancholy, and considered myself as the immediate cause of the prodigal son . -- I lost all relish for company, and indeed most of my acquaintances no sooner perceived my change of temper, than my acquaintances abandoned me. Horatio, disgusted at my insensibility, or (which is more probable) cloyed with possession, became colder and colder every day, till at last Horatio left me altogether, without making any apology for Horatio conduct; or securing me against the miseries of want, as a man of honor ought to have done, considering the share Horatio had in my ruin; for I afterward learned that the quarrel between Lothario and Horatio, was a story trumped up to rid the one of my importunities, and give the other the enjoyment of my person, which, it seems, Horatio lusted after, upon seeing me at the house of my seducer. -- Reduced to this extremity, I cursed my own simplicity, uttered horrid imprecations against the treachery of Horatio; and as I became every day more and more familiarized to the loss of innocence, resolved to be revenged on the sex in general, by practicing their own arts upon their. -- Nor was an opportunity long wanting: An old gentlewoman, under pretense of sympathizing, visited me, and after having condoled with me on my misfortunes, and professed a disinterested friendship, began to display the art of her occupation, in encomiums on my beauty, and invectives against the wretch who had forsaken me; insinuating withal that it would be my own fault if I did not still make my fortune by the extraordinary qualifications with which nature had endowed me. -- I soon understood her drift, and gave her such encouragement to explain her, that we came to an agreement immediately to divide the profits of my prostitution, accruing from such gallants as her should introduce to my acquaintance. The first stroke of my dissimulation, was practiced upon a certain J -- ge, to whom I was recommended by this matron, as an innocent creature just arrived from the country; my acquaintance was so transported with my appearance and feigned simplicity, that my acquaintance paid a hundred guineas for the possession of me for one night only, during which I behaved in such a manner, as to make my acquaintance perfectly well pleased with my acquaintance purchase.  CHAP. XXIII. her is interrupted by a bailif, who arrests, and carries her to the Marshalsea -- I accompany her -- bring witnesses to prove her is not the same person named in the writ -- the bailif is fain to give her a present, and discharge her -- we shift we lodging -- her resumes her story and ends her story -- my reflections thereupon -- her makes me acquainted with the progress of a common woman of the town -- resolves to quit that way of life.  her story was here interrupted by a rap at the door, which I no sooner opened, than three or four terrible fellows rushed in, one of whom accosted my fellow lodger thus: -- "Madam, your servant -- you must do me the favor to come along with me -- I have got a writ against you." -- While the bailif (for so he was) spoke thus, he followers surrounded the prisoner, and began to handle her very roughly. -- This treatment incensed me so much, that I snatched up the poker, and would certainly have used This treatment in defense of the lady, without any regard to the strength and number of her adversaries, had not her begged me with a composure of countenance, for which I could not account, to use no violence in her behalf, which could be of no service to her, but might be very detrimental to me. -- Then turning to the leader of this formidable troop, her desired to see the warrant, and having perused the warrant, said with a faultering voice, "I am not the person whose name is here mentioned; arrest me at your peril." -- "Ay, ay, Madam, (replied the catch-pole) we shall prove your identity. -- In the mean time, whether will you be pleased to be carried to my house or to Jail?" -- "If I must be confined (said she) I would rather have my house for a prison than a common Jail." -- "Well, well, (answered he) if you have money enough in your pocket, you shall be entertained like a princess." -- But when a princess acquainted he with a princess poverty, he swore he never gave credit, and ordered one of he myrmidons to call a coach to carry a princess to the Marshalsea at once. -- While this was a doing a princess took me aside, and bid me be under no concern on a princess account, for a princess knew how to extricate a princess from this difficulty very soon, and perhaps gain something by this occasion. -- Although a princess discourse was a mystery to me, I was very well pleased with a princess assurance, and when a coach came to the door, offered to accompany a princess to prison, to which, after much entreaty, a princess consented. -- When we arrived at the gate of the Marshalsea, we conductor alighted, and having demanded entrance, presented the writ to the turnkey, who no sooner perceived the name of Elizabeth Carry, than our conductor cried, "Ah ha! my old acquaintance Bett! I Am glad to see thee with all my heart." -- So saying our conductor opened the door, and helped a princess to dismount; but when our conductor observed a princess face, our conductor started back, saying, "Z -- ds! who have we got here?" -- The bailif, alarmed at this interrogation, cried with some emotion, "Who the devil should it be, but the prisoner Elizabeth Carry?" The turnkey replied, "That Elizabeth Carry! -- I Will be damned if that is Elizabeth Carry, more than my grandmother. -- D -- n my blood, I know Bett Carry as well as if I had made my grandmother." -- Here the lady thought fit to interpose, and tell the catchpole, if the lady had taken the lady word for her word at first, the lady might have saved the lady and the lady a great deal of trouble. -- "It may be so (answered the lady) but by G -- d, I Will have further evidence that you are not the person before you and I part." -- "Yes, yes, (said the lady) you shall have further evidence to your cost." -- Upon this we adjourned into the lodge, and called for a bottle of wine, where my companion wrote a direction to two of the lady acquaintance, and begged the favor of me to go to their lodgings, and request their to come to the lady immediately: I found their together at a house in Bridges's street, Drury Lane, and as their were luckily unengaged, their set out with me in a hackney-coach without hesitation, after I had related the circumstances of the affair, which flattered their with hopes of seeing a bailif trounced; for there is an antipathy as natural between the whores and bailifs, as that subsisting between mice and cats. -- Accordingly, when they entered the lodge, they embraced the prisoner Elizabeth Carry very affectionately by the name of Nancy Williams; and asked how long Nancy Williams had been nabb'd, and for what? -- On hearing the particulars of Nancy Williams adventure repeated, they offered to swear before a justice of peace that Nancy Williams was not the person mentioned in the writ whom it seems, they all knew; but the bailif, who by this time was convinced of (...), told they all he would not put they all to that trouble. -- "Ladies (said he) there is no harm done -- you shall give me leave to treat you with another bottle, and then we'll part friends." -- This proposal was not at all relished by the sisterhood; and miss Nancy Williams told Nancy Williams: Sure Nancy Williams did not imagine Nancy Williams such a fool as to be satisfied with a paultry glass of sour wine. -- Here The turnkey interrupted Nancy Williams, by affirming with an oath, that the wine was as good as ever was tipped over tongue. -- "Well (continued Nancy Williams) that may be -- but was it the best of champaign, it is no recompense for the damage I have suffered both in character and health, by being wrongfully dragged to jail -- At this rate no innocent person is safe, since any officer of justice, out of malice, private pique, or mistake, may injure and oppress the subject with impunity -- but, thank heaven, I live under the protection of laws that will not suffer such insults to pass unpunished, and I know very well how to procure redress." -- Mr. Vulture (for that was the bailif's name) finding he had to deal with one who would not be imposed upon, began to look very sullen and perplexed, and leaning he forehead on he hand, entered into a deliberation with he, which lasted a few minutes, and then broke out in a volley of dreadful curses against the old b -- ch our landlady (as he called her) for having misinformed he. -- After much wrangling and swearing, the matter was referred to the decision of the turnkey, who calling for the other bottle, mulcted the bailif in all the liquor that had been drank, coach-hire, and a couple of guineas for the use of the plaintiff. -- The money was immediately deposited; Nancy Williams Nancy Williams gratified the two evidences with one half, and putting the other in Nancy Williams pocket drove home with me, leaving the catchpole grumbling over Nancy Williams loss, yet pleased in the main, for having so cheaply got clear of a business that might have cost Nancy Williams ten times the sum, and Nancy Williams place to boot. -- This guinea was a very seasonable relief to us, who were reduced to great necessity, six of my shirts and almost all my clothes, except those on my back, being either pawned or sold for us maintenance before this happened. -- As we resented the behavior of our landlandy, our first care was to provide our with another lodging, whither our removed next day, with an intention to keep our as retired as possible until our cure should be completed. -- When our were fixed in our new habitation, I entreated her to finish the story of her Life, which her pursued in this manner:  The success of our experiment on the J -- ge, encouraged our to practice the same deceit on others, and my virginity was five times sold to good purpose; but this harvest lasted not long, my character taking air, and my directress deserting me for some new game. Whereupon I took lodgings near Charing cross, at two guineas per week, and began to entertain company in a public manner: -- But my income being too small to defray my expense, I was obliged to retrench, and enter into articles with the porters of certain taverns, who undertook to find employment enough for me, provided I would share my profits with employment. -- Accordingly, I was almost every night engaged with company, among whom I was exposed to every mortification, danger and abuse that flow from drunkenness, brutality and disease. -- How miserable is the condition of a courtezan, whose business it is to sooth, suffer, and obey the dictates of rage, insolence and lust! -- As my spirit was not sufficiently humbled to the will, not my temper calculated for the conversation of my gallants, it was impossible for me to overcome an aversion I felt for my profession, which manifested itself in a settled gloom on my countenance, and disgusted these sons of mirth and riot so much, that I was frequently used in a shocking manner, and kicked down stairs with disgrace. -- The messengers seeing me disagrecable to The messengers benefactors and employers, seldom troubled me with a call, and I began to find me almost totally neglected. To contribute toward my support, I was fain to sell my watch, rings, trinkets, with the best part of my clothes; and I was one evening musing by me, on the misery before me, when I received a message from a bagnio, whither I repaired in a chair, and was introduced to a gentleman dressed like an officer, with whom I supped tete a tete, in a sumptuous manner, and after drinking a hearty glass of champaign, went to bed. -- In the morning when I awoke I found my gallant had got up, and drawing as^ the curtain, could not perceive my gallant in the room; this gave me some uneasiness, but (...) my gallant might have retired on some necessary occasion, I waited a full hour for my gallant return: and then in the greatest perplexity got up, and rung the bell. -- When the waiter came to the door, the waiter found the door locked, and desired admittance, which I granted, after observing with great surprise that the key remained on the inside, as when we went to bed. I no sooner enquired for the captain, than my gallant staring with a distracted look, cried, "How, madam! is the captain not a-bed?" And when the captain was satisfied as to that, run into a closet adjoining to the chamber, the window of which the captain found open. -- Through this the adventurer had got upon a wall, from whence the adventurer dropped down into a court and escaped; leaving me to be answerable, not only for the reckoning, but also for a large silver tankard and posset-bowl, which the adventurer had carried off with the adventurer. -- It is impossible to describe the consternation I was under, when I saw myself detained as a thief's accomplice (for I was looked upon in that light) and carried before a justice, who mistaking my confusion for a sign of guilt, committed me after a short examination to Bridewell, having advised me, as the only means to save my life, to turn evidence, and impeach my confederate. -- I now concluded, the vengeance of heaven had overtaken me, and that I must soon finish my carreer by an ignominious death. -- This reflection sunk so deep into my soul, that I was for some days deprived of my reason, and actually believed myself in hell, tormented by fiends: Indeed, there needs not a very extravagant imagination to form that conjecture; for of all the scenes on earth, that of Bridewell approaches nearest the idea I had always entertained of the infernal regions. -- Here I saw nothing but rage, anguish and impiety; and heard nothing but groans, curses and blasphemy. -- In the midst of this hellish crew, I was subjected to the tyranny of a barbarian, who imposed upon myself tasks that I could not possibly perform, and then punished my incapacity with the utmost rigor and inhumanity. I was often whipped into a swoon, and lashed out of it, during which miserable intervals, I was robbed by my fellow prisoners of every thing about myself, even to my cape, shoes and stockings: I was not only destitute of necessaries, but even of food, so that my wretchedness was extreme. Not one of my acquaintance to whom I imparted my situation, would grant me the least succor or regard, on pretense of my being committed for theft; and my landlord refused to part with some of my own clothes which I sent for, because I was indebted to my landlord for a week's lodging. -- Overwhelmed with calamity, I grew desperate, and resolved to put an end to my grievances and life together; for this purpose I got up in the middle of the night, when I thought every body round me asleep, and fixing one end of my handkerchief to a large hook in the ceiling, that supported the scales on which the hemp is weighed, I stood upon a chair and making a noose on the other end, put my neck into a chair, with an intention to hang myself, but before I could adjust the knot, I was surprised and prevented by two women who had been awake all the while, and suspected my design. -- In the morning my attempt was published among the prisoners, and punished with thirty stripes, the pain of which cooperating with my disappointment and disgrace, bereft me of my senses and threw me into an ecstasy of madness, wherein I tore the flesh from my bones with my teeth, and dashed my head against the pavement. -- So that they were obliged to set a watch over myself, to restrain me from doing further mischief to myself and others. -- This fit of phrenzy continued three days, at the end of which I grew calm and sullen; but as the desire of making away with myself still remained, I came to a determination of starving myself to death, and with that view refused all sustenance. Whether it was owing to the want of opposition, or to the weakness of nature, I know not, but on the second day of my fast, I found my resolution considerably impaired, and the calls of hunger almost insupportable. -- At this critical conjuncture a lady was brought into the prison, with whom I had contracted an acquaintance while I lived with Horatio; a lady was then on the same footing as I was, but afterward quarreling with a lady , and not finding another to a lady mind, altered a lady scheme of life, and set up a coffee-house among the hundreds of Drury, where a lady entertained gentlemen with claret, arrack and the choice of half a dozen damsels, who lived in a lady house. This serviceable matron, having neglected to gratify a certain j -- ce for the connivance a lady enjoyed, was indicted at the quarter sessions, in consequence of which a lady bevy was dispersed and a lady committed to Bridewell. -- a lady had not been long there, before a lady learned my disaster, and coming up to me, after a compliment of condolance, enquired into the particulars of my fate: While we were engaged in discourse together, the master coming up, told me that the fellow on whose account I had suffered was taken, that the master had confessed the theft, and cleared me of any concern in the affair; for which reason the master, the master, had orders to discharge me, and that I was from that moment free. This piece of news soon banished all thoughts of death, and had such an instantaneous effect on my countenance, that Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) hoping to find Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) account in me, very generously offered to furnish me with what necessaries I wanted, and take me into Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) own house, as soon as Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) could compromise matters with the j -- ces. -- The conditions of Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) offer, were, that I should pay three guineas weekly for my board, and a reasonable consideration besides for the use of such clothes and ornaments as Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) should supply me with, to be deducted from the first profits of my embraces. -- These were hard terms; but not be rejected by one who was turned out helpless and naked into the wide world, without a friend to pity or assist her. -- I therefore embraced Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) proposal, and Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) being bailed in a few hours, took me home with Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) in a coach. As I was by this time conscious of having formerly disgusted my admirers by my reserved and haughty behavior, I now endeavored to conquer that disposition, and the sudden change of my fortune giving me a flow of spirits, I appeared in the most winning and gay manner I could assume. Having the advantage of a good voice and education over most of my rivals, I exerted my talents to the uttermost, and soon became the favorite with all company. -- This success alarmed the pride and jealousy of Mrs. Coupler, who could not bear the thoughts of being eclipsed: Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) therefore made a merit of Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) envy, and whispered about among Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) customers that I was unsound. -- There needed no more to ruin my reputation and blast my prosperity; every body shunned me with marks of aversion and disdain, and in a very short time I was as solitary as ever. Want of gallants was attended with want of money to satisfy my malicious landlady, who having purposely given me credit to the amount of eleven pounds, took out a writ against me, and I was arrested in her own house. -- Though the room was crowded with people, when the bailif entered, not one of people had compassion enough to attempt to molify my prosecutrix, far less to pay the debt; people even laughed at my tears, and one of people bid me be of good cheer, for I should not want admirers in Newgate. At that instant a sea lieutenant came in, and seeing my plight, began to enquire into the circumstances of my misfortune, when this wit advised a sea lieutenant to keep clear of me, for I was a fire-ship. -- "A fire-ship! (replied the sailor) more like a poor galley in distress that has been boarded by such a fire-ship as you; if so be that be the case, Mrs. Coupler (the lady then present) stands in more need of assistance. -- Harkee, my girl, how far have you overrun the constable?" -- I told the constable that the debt amounted to eleven pounds, besides the expense of the writ. -- "An that be all (said the constable) you shall not go to the bilboes this bout." -- And taking out his purse, paid the money, discharged the bailif, and telling me, I had got into the wrong port, advised me to seek out a more convenient harbor, where I could be safely hove down, for which purpose his made me a present of five guineas more. -- I was so touched with This piece of news, that for some time I had not power to thank his. -- However, as soon as I had recollected me, I begged the favor of his to go with me to the next tavern, where I explained the nature of my disaster, and convinced his of the falsehood of what was reported to my prejudice so effectually, that his from that moment attached his to me, and we lived in great harmony together, until his was obliged to go to sea, where his perished in a storm.  Having lost my benefactor, and almost consumed the remains of his bounty, I saw me in danger of relapsing into my former necessity, and began to be very uneasy at the prospect of bailifs and jails; -- when one of the sisterhood, a little stale, advised me to take lodgings in a part of the town where I was unknown, and pass for an heiress, which might entrap some body to be my husband, who would possibly be able to allow me an handsome maintenance, or at wont screen me from the dread and danger of a prison, by becoming liable for whatever debts I should contract. -- I approved of this scheme, toward the execution of which my companion clubbed my companion wardrobe, and undertook to live with me in quality of my maid; with the proviso, that my companion should be reimbursed and handsomely considered out of the profits of my success. -- my companion was immediately detached to look out for a convenient place, and that very day hired a genteel apartment in Park-street, whither I moved in a coach loaded with my companion baggage and my own. -- I made my first appearance in a blue riding-habit trimmed with silver; and my maid acted my companion part so artfully, that in a day or two, my fame was spread all over the neighborhood, and I was said to be a rich heiress just arrived from the country. -- This report brought a swarm of gay young fellows about me; but I soon found gay young fellows out to be all indigent adventurers like myself, who crowded to myself like crows to a carrion, with a view of preying upon my fortune. -- I maintained, however, the appearance of wealth as long as possible, in hopes of gaining some admirer more for my purpose; and at length, I attracted the regard of one who would have satisfied my wishes, and managed matters so well, that a day was actually fixed for our nuptials: In the interim, he begged leave to introduce an intimate friend to me, which request as I could not refuse, I had the extreme mortification and surprise, to see next night, in an intimate friend, my old keeper Horatio, who no sooner beheld me than he changed color; but had presence of mind enough to advance and salute me, bidding me (with a low voice) be under no apprehension, for he would not expose me. -- In spite of this assurance, I could not recover me so far, as to entertain them, but withdrew to my chamber on pretense of a severe headache, to the no small concern of my adorer, who took his leave in the tenderest manner, and went off with his .  Having imparted my situation to my companion, my companion found it high time for us to decamp, and that without any noise, because us were not only indebted to us landlady, but also to several tradesmen in the neighborhood. -- us retreat (therefore) was concerted and executed in this manner: Having packed up all us clothes and movables in small parcels, my companion (on pretense of fetching cordials for me) carried them at several times, to the house of an acquaintance, where my companion likewise procured a lodging, to which we retired, in the middle of the night, opening the street door, when every other body in her own house was asleep. -- I was now obliged to aim at lower game, and accordingly spread my nets among trades people; but found trades people all too phlegmatic or cautious for my art and attractions; till at last I became acquainted with you, on whom I practiced all my dexterity; not that I believed you had any fortune or expectation of one, but that I might transfer the burden of such debts as I had incurred or could contract, from me to another, and at the same time, avenge me of your sex, by rendering miserable, one who bore such resemblance to the wretch who ruined me; -- but heaven preserved you from my snares, by the discovery you made, which was owing to the negligence of my maid in leaving the chamber door unlocked, when my companion went to buy sugar for breakfast. -- The person in bed with me, was a gentleman whom I had allured the night before, as he walked homeward pretty much elevated with liquor; for by this time, my condition was so low, that I was forced to turn out, in the twilight, to the streets in hopes of prey. -- When I found me detected and forsaken by you, I was fain to move my lodging and dwell two pair of stairs higher than before: my companion being disappointed in my companion expectations, left me, to trade upon my companion own bottom, and I had no other resource, than to venture forth like the owls, in the dark, to pick up a precarious and uncomfortable subsistence. I have often sauntered between Ludgate Hill and Charing Cross, a whole winter-night, exposed not only to the inclemency of the weather, but likewise to the rage of hunger and thirst, without being so happy as to meet with one cully; then creep up to my garret in a deplorable, draggled condition, sneak to bed, and try to bury my appetite and sorrows in sleep. -- When I lighted on some rake or tradesman reeling home drunk, I frequently suffered the most brutal treatment, in spite of which I was obliged to affect gaiety and good humor, though my soul was stung with resentment and disdain, and my heart loaded with grief and affliction. -- In the course of these nocturnal adventures, I was infected with the disease, that in a short time rendered me the object of my own abhorrence, and drove me to the retreat, where your benevolence rescued me from the jaws of death.  So much candor and good sense appeared in this lady's narration, that I made no scruple of believing every syllable of what she said; and expressed my astonishment at the variety of miseries she had undergone, in so little time; for all she misfortunes had happened within the compass of two years. -- I compared she situation with my own, and found my own a thousand times more wretched: I had endured hardships, it is true; my whole life had been a series of such, and when I looked forward, the prospect was not much bettered -- but then, the prospect were become habitual to me, and consequently, I could bear the prospect with less difficulty -- If one scheme of life should not succeed, I could have recourse to another, and so to a third, veering about to a thousand different shifts, according to the emergencies of my fate, without forfeiting the dignity of my character, beyond a power of retrieving it, or subjecting me wholly to the caprice and barbarity of the world. On the other hand, me had known and relished the sweets of prosperity, me had been brought up under the wings of an indulgent parent, in all the delicacies to which me sex and rank entitled me; and without any extravagance of hope, entertained me with the view of uninterrupted happiness through the whole scene of life -- How fatal then, how tormenting, how intolerable must me reverse of fortune be! a reverse, that not only robbs me of these external comforts, and plunges me into all the miseries of want, but also murders me peace of mind, and entails upon me the curse of eternal infamy! -- Of all professions I pronounced that of a courtezan the most deplorable, and me of all courtezans the most unhappy. -- me allowed my observation to be just in the main, but at the same time, affirmed, that notwithstanding the disgraces which had fallen to me share, me had not been so unlucky in the condition of a prostitute as many others of the same community. -- "I have often seen (said me) while I strolled about the streets at midnight, a number of naked wretches reduced to rags and filth, huddled together like swine, in the corner of a dark alley; some of whom, but eighteen months before, I had known the favorites of the town, rolling in affluence, and glittering in all the pomp of equipage and dress." -- And indeed the gradation is easily conceived; the most fashionable woman of the town is as liable to contagion, as one in a much humbler sphere; me infects me admirers, me situation is public, me is avoided, neglected, unable to support me usual appearance, which however me strives to maintain as long as possible; me credit fails, me is obliged to retrench and become a night-walker, me malady gains ground, me tampers with me constitution and ruins her constitution; me complexion fades, me grows nauseous to every body, finds me reduced to a starving condition, is tempted to pick pockets, is detected, committed to Newgate, where me remains in a miserable condition, 'till me is discharged because the plaintiff appears not to prosecute me. No body will afford me lodging, the symptoms of me distemper are grown outrageous, me sues to be admitted into an hospital, where me is cured at the expense of me nose; me is turned out naked into the streets, depends upon the addresses of the canaille, is fain to allay the rage of hunger and cold with gin, degenerates into a state of brutal insensibility, rots and dies upon a dunghill. -- Miserable wretch that I am! perhaps the same horrors are decreed for me! -- "No (cried me after some pause) I shall never live to such extremity of distress! my own hand shall open a way for my deliverance, before I arrive at that forlorn period!" -- me condition filled me with sympathy and compassion; I revered me qualifications, looked upon me as unfortunate, not criminal; and attended me with such care and success, that in less than two months, me health, as well as my own, was perfectly re-established. -- As we often conferred upon our mutual affairs, and interchanged advice; a thousand different projects were formed, which upon further canvassing appeared impracticable. -- we would have gladly gone to service; but who would take we in without recommendation? At length an expedient occurred to me, of which me intended to lay hold; and this was, to procure with the first money me should earn, the homely garb of a country wench, go to some village at a good distance from town, and come up in a wagon, as a fresh girl for service; by which means, me might be provided for in a manner much more suitable to me inclination, than me present way of life.  CHAP. XXIV. I am reduced to great misery -- assaulted on Tower Hill by a press-gang, who put me on board a tender -- my usage there -- my arrival on board of the Thunder man of war, where I am put in irons, and afterward released by the good offices of Mr. Thomson, who recommends me as assistant to the surgeon -- the surgeon relates the surgeon own story, and makes me acquainted with the characters of the captain, surgeon, and first mate.
