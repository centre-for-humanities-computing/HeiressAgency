CHAP. I. Of my birth and parentage.  I WAS born in the northern part of this united kingdom in the house of my grandfather, a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions signalized a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions in behalf of a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions country; and was remarkable for a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions abilities in the law, which a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions exercised with great success, in quality of a judge, particularly against beggars, for whom a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions had a singular aversion.  My father, a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions youngest son, sell in love with a poor relation, who lived with the old gentleman, and performed the office of housekeeper; whom a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions privately espoused; of which marriage I am the first fruit. -- During which marriage pregnancy, a dream discomposed my mother so much, that my father, tired with my mother importunity, at last consulted a seer, whose favorable interpretation a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions would have secured beforehand by a bribe, but found a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who had on many occasions incorruptible. my mother dreamed, my mother was delivered of a tennis-ball, which the devil (who to my mother great surprise, acted the part of a midwife) struck so forcibly with a racket, that it disappeared in an instant; and my mother was for some time inconsolable for the loss of my mother offspring; when all of a sudden, my mother beheld it return with equal violence, and earth itself beneath my mother feet, whence immediately sprung up a goodly tree covered with blossoms, the scent of which operated so strongly on my mother nerves that my mother awoke. -- The attentive sage, after some deliberation, assured my parents, that my parents firstborn would be a great traveller, that he would undergo many dangers and difficulties, and at last return to he native land, where he would flourish with great reputation and happiness. -- How truly this was foretold, will appear in the sequel. -- It was not long before some officious person informed my grandfather of familiarities that passed between some officious person son and housekeeper, which alarmed some officious person so much, that, a few days after, some officious person told my father it was high time for some officious person to enter into the holy state of matrimony, and that some officious person had provided a match for some officious person, to which some officious person could in justice have no objections. my father, finding it would be impossible to conceal my father situation much longer, frankly owned what my father had done, and excused my father for not having asked the consent of my father, by saying, my father knew it would be to no purpose; and that, had my father inclination been known, my grandfather might have taken such measures as would have effectually put the gratification of it out of my grandfather power: my grandfather added, that no exception could be made to my grandfather wife's virtue, birth, beauty, and good sense, and as for fortune, it was beneath my grandfather consideration. -- The old gentleman, who kept all my grandfather passions (except one) in excellent order, heard my grandfather to an end with great temper; and then calmly asked, how my grandfather proposed to maintain my grandfather and spouse? -- my grandfather replied, my grandfather could be in no danger of wanting, while my grandfather 's tenderness remained, which my grandfather and his wife would always cherish with the utmost veneration; that my grandfather was persuaded my grandfather allowance would be suitable to the dignity and circumstances of my grandfather family, and the provision already made to my grandfather brothers and sisters, who were happily settled under my grandfather protection. -- Your brothers and sisters, said my grandfather, did not think it beneath Your brothers and sisters to consult me in an affair of such importance as matrimony; neither (I suppose) would you have omitted that piece of duty, had you not some secret fund in reserve, to the comforts of which I leave you, with a desire that you will this night, seek out another habitation for Your brothers and sisters and wife, whither in a short time, I will send you an account of the ^pence I have been at in your education, with a view of being reimbursed. -- Sir, you have made the grand tour -- you are a polite gentleman -- a very pretty gentleman -- I wish you a great deal of joy, and am your very humble servant. So saying, Sir left my father in a situation easily imagined. However, Sir did not long hesitate; for lbeing perfectly well acquainted with Sir 's disposition, Sir did not doubt that Sir was glad of this pretense to get rid of Sir; and as Sir resolves were invariable like the laws of the Medes and Persians, Sir knew it would be to no purpose to attempt Sir by prayers and entreaties; so without any farther application, Sir betook Sir with Sir disconsolate bedfellow, to a farm-house, where an old servant of Sir mother dwelt; there a farm-house, where an old servant of his mother dwelt remained some time in a situation but ill adapted to the elegance of a farm-house, where an old servant of his mother dwelt desires and tenderness of a farm-house, where an old servant of his mother dwelt love; which nevertheless, my father endured, rather than supplicate an unnatural and inflexible parent: but his mother, foreseeing the inconveniences his mother would be exposed to, if his mother must be delivered in this place (and his mother pregnancy was very far advanced) without communicating his mother design to his mother husband, went in disguise to the house of my grandfather, hoping that his mother tears and condition would move my father to compassion, and reconcile my father to an event which could not otherwise be amended -- his mother found means to deceive the servants, and was introduced as an unfortunate lady, who wanted to complain of some matrimonial grievances, it being my grandfather's particular province to decide in all cases of scandal. his mother was accordingly admitted into my father presence, where discovering his mother, his mother sell at my father seet, and in the most affecting manner, implored my father forgiveness; at the same time, representing the danger that threatened not only his mother life, but that of my father own grandchild which was about to see the light. -- my father told his mother, my father was sorry that the indiscretion of his mother and my father son had compelled my father to make a vow, which put it out of my father power to give the indiscretion of her and his son any assistance -- That my father had already imparted my father thoughts on that subject to her husband, and was surprised that the indiscretion of her and his son should disturb my father peace with any further importunity. -- This said, he retired. -- The violence of his mother's affliction had such an effect on his mother constitution, that his mother was immediately seized with the pains of childbed; and had not an old maidservant to whom his mother was very dear, afforded his mother pity and assistance, at the hazard of incurring my grandfather's displeasure, his mother and the innocent fruit of his mother womb must have fallen miserable victims to he rigor and inhumanity. -- By the friendship of this poor woman, this poor woman was carried up to a garret, and immediately delivered of a man-child, the story of whose unfortunate birth, he himself now relates. -- my father being informed of what had happened, flew to the embraces of my father darling spouse, and while my father loaded my father off spring with paternal caresses, could not forbear shedding a flood of tears, on beholding the dear partner of my father heart (for whose ease my father would have sacrificed the treasures of the east) stretched upon a flock-bed, in a miserable apartment, unable to protect this poor woman from the inclemencies of the weather. -- It is not to be supposed that the old gentleman was ignorant of what passed, though the old gentleman affected to know nothing of the matter, and pretended to be very much surprised, when the son of the old gentleman deceased eldest son, a pert boy, who lived with the old gentleman as the old gentleman heir apparent, acquainted the old gentleman with the affair; the old gentleman determined therefore to preserve no medium, but immediately (on the third day after her delivery) sent her a peremptory order to begone, and turned off the servant who had preserved her life. This behavior so exasperated my father, that my father had recourse to the most dreadful imprecations, and on my father bare knees implored that heaven would renounce my father, if ever my father should forget or forgive the barbarity of my father fire. -- The injuries which his mother received from his mother removal in such circumstances, and the want of necessaries where his mother lodged, together with his mother grief and anxiety of mind, soon threw his mother into a languishing disorder which put an end to his mother life. My father, who loved his mother tenderly, was so affected with his mother death, that he remained six weeks deprived of he senses; during which time, the people where he lodged, carried the infant to the old man, who relented so far, on hearing the melancholy story of he daughter-in-law's death, and the deplorable condition of he , that he sent a man-child to nurse, and ordered my father to be carried home to my father house, where my father soon recovered the use of my father reason. -- Whether this hard-hearted judge felt any remorse for this hard-hearted judge cruel treatment of this hard-hearted judge son and daughter; or (which is more probable) was afraid this hard-hearted judge character would suffer in the neighborhood; his character professed great sorrow for his character conduct to my father, whose delirium was succeeded by a profound melancholy and reserve. At length his character disappeared, and notwithstanding all imaginable inquiry, could never be heard of, which confirmed most people in the opinion of his character having made away with his character in a fit of despair. -- How I understood the particulars of my birth, will appear in the course of these memoirs.  CHAP. II. I grew up -- am hated by my relations -- sent to school -- neglected by my grandfather -- maltreated by my master -- seasoned to adversity -- form cabals against the pedant -- debarred access to my grandfather -- hunted by his heir -- demolish the teeth of his tutor.  THERE were not wanting some, who suspected my uncles of being concerned in my father's fate, on the supposition that they would all share in the patrimony destined for his: and this conjecture seemed supported by reflecting, that in all his calamities they never discovered the least inclination to serve his; but, on the contrary, by all the artifices in they power, fed his 's resentment, and strengthened his resolution of leaving his to misery and want. -- But people of judgment treated this insinuation as an idle chimera; because had my relations been so wicked as to consult people of judgment interest by committing such an attrocious crime. my father's fate would have extended to me too, whose life was another obstacle to their expectation. -- Mean while, I grew apace, and as I strongly resembled my father, who was the darling of the tenants, I wanted nothing which my father, who was the darling of the tenants indigent circumstances could afford: but my father, who was the darling of the tenants favor was a weak resource against the jealous enmity of my cousins; who, the more my infancy promised, conceived the more implacable hatred against me; and before I was six years of age, had so effectually blockaded my grandfather, that I never saw my grandfather but by stealth; when I sometimes made up to my grandfather chair as my grandfather fat to view my grandfather laborers in the field: on which occasions, my grandfather would stroke my head, bid me be a good boy, and promise my grandfather would take care of me. -- I was soon after sent to school at a village hard by, of which my grandfather had been dictator time out of mind: but as my grandfather neither paid for my board, nor supplied me with clothes, books, and other necessaries I required, my condition was very ragged and contemptible, and the schoolmaster, who through fear of my grandfather taught me gratis, gave my grandfather no concern about the progress I made under my grandfather instruction. -- In spite of all these difficulties and disgraces, I became a good proficient in the Latin tongue; and as soon as I could write tolerably, pestered my grandfather with letters to such a degree, that my grandfather sent for my master, and chid my grandfather severely for bestowing such pains on my education, telling my grandfather, that if ever I should be brought to the gallows for forgery, which my grandfather had taught me to commit, my blood should lie on my grandfather head. -- The pedant, who dreaded nothing more than the displeasure of my grandfather patron, assured my grandfather honor that the boy's ability was more owing to my grandfather own genius and application, than to any instruction or encouragement my grandfather received; that, although my grandfather could not divest my grandfather of the knowledge my grandfather had already imbibed, unless my grandfather would empower my grandfather to disable my grandfather fingers, my grandfather should endeavor, with G -- d's help, to prevent my grandfather future improvement. And indeed, my grandfather punctually performed what my grandfather my grandfather had undertaken: for, on pretense that I had wrote impertinent letters to my grandfather, my grandfather caused a board to be made with five holes in a board, through which my grandfather thrust the fingers and thumb of my right hand, and fastened a board by whip-cord to my wrist, in such a manner, that I was effectually debarred the use of my pen. But this restraint I was freed from in a few days, by an accident which happened in a quarrel between me and another boy, who taking upon my grandfather to insult my poverty, I was so incensed at this ungenerous reproach, that with one stroke of my machine, I cut my grandfather to the skull, to the great terror of my grandfather and school-fellows, who left my grandfather bleeding on the ground, and ran to inform the master of what had happened. I was so severely punished for this trespass, that, were I to live to the age of Methusalem, the impression this trespass made on my grandfather would not be effaced; no more than the antipathy and horror I conceived for the merciless tyrant who inflicted it. The contempt which my appearance naturally produced, in all who saw me, the continual wants I was exposed to, and my own haughty disposition, impatient of affronts, involved me in a thousand troublesome adventures, by which I was at length enured to adversity, and emboldened to undertakings far above my years. I was often inhumanly scourged for crimes I did not commit, because having the character of a vagabond in the village, every piece of mischief whose author lay unknown, was charged upon my grandfather. -- I have been found guilty of robbing orchards I never entered, of killing cats I never hurted, of stealing gingerbread I never touched, and of abusing old women I never saw. -- Nay, a stammering carpenter had eloquence enough to persuade my master, that I fired a pistol loaded with small shot, into my master window; though my landlady and the whole family bore witness, that I was a-bed fast asleep at the time when this outrage was committed. -- I was flogged for having narrowly escaped drowning, by the sinking of a ferry-boat in which I was passenger. -- Another time for having recovered of a bruise occasioned by a horse and cart running over me. -- A third time, for being bit by a baker's dog. -- In short, whether I was guilty or unfortunate, the vengeance and sympathy of this arbitrary pedagogue were the same. Far from being subdued by this insernal usage, my indignation triumphed over that slavish awe which had hitherto enforced my obedience; and the more my years and knowledge increased, the more I perceived the injustice and barbarity of his behavior. By the help of an uncommon genius, and the advice and direction of our usher, who had served my father in my father travels, I made a surprising progress in the classicks, writing and arithmetic; so that before I was twelve years old, I was confessedly the best scholar in the school: This qualification, together with a boldness of temper, and strength of make, which had subjected almost all my cotemporaries, gave me such influence over them, that I began to form cabals against my persecutor; and was in hopes of being able to bid his defiance in a very short time. -- Being at the head of a faction consisting of thirty boys, most of a faction consisting of thirty boys of my own age, I was determined to put a faction consisting of thirty boys metal to trial, that I might know how far a faction consisting of thirty boys were to be depended upon, before I put my grand scheme in execution: with this view our attacked a body of stout apprentices, who had taken possession of a part of the ground allotted to our, for the scene of our diversions; and who were then playing at nine-pins on the spot: but I had the mortification to see my adherents routed in an instant, and a leg of one of my adherents broke in his flight by the bowl, which one of our adversaries had detached in pursuit of our. -- This discomfiture did not hinder our from engaging my adherents afterward, in frequent skirmishes which our maintained by throwing stones at a distance, wherein I received many wounds, the sears of which still remain. our enemies were so harassed and interrupted by these alarms, that Our enemies at last abandoned Our enemies conquest, and left our to the peaceable enjoyment of our own territories. -- It would be endless to enumerate the exploits our performed in the course of this consederacy, which became the terror of the whole village; insomuch, that when different interests divided it, one of the parties commonly courted the assistance of Roderick Random (by which name I was known) to cast the balance, and keep the opposite section in awe. -- Meanwhile, I took the advantage of every play-day, to present myself before my grandfather, to whom I seldom found access, by reason of my grandfather being so closely besieged by a numerous family of my grandfather female grandchildren, who, though they perpetually quarrelled among they, never failed to join against myself, as the common enemy of all. my grandfather heir, who was about the age of eighteen, minded nothing but fox-hunting, and indeed was qualified for nothing else, notwithstanding my grandfather's indulgence, in entertaining a tutor for my grandfather at home; who at the same time performed the office of parish clerk. This young Acteon, who inherited my grandfather's antipathy to every thing in distress, never set eyes on myself, without uncoupling his beagles, and hunting me into some cottage or other, whither I generally fled for shelter. In this christian amusement, his was encouraged by his preceptor, who, no doubt, took such opportunities to ingratiate his with the rising sun, observing that the old gentleman, according to course of nature, had not long to live, being already on the verge of fourscore. -- The behavior of this rascally sycophant incensed me so much, that one day, when I was beleagured by him and him hounds into a farmer's house, where I had found protection, I took aim at him (being an excellent marksman) with a large pebble, which struck out four of him foreteeth, and effectually incapacitated him for doing the office of a clerk ever after.  CHAP. III. My mother's brother arrives -- relieves me -- a description of My mother's brother -- goes along with My mother's brother to the house of my grandfather -- is encountered by My mother's brother dogs -- defeats his dogs after a bloody engagement -- is admitted to the old gentleman -- a dialogue between his dogs.  ABOUT this time, my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war, arrived in my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war own country; where being informed of my condition, my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war came to see me, and out of my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war slender finances, not only supplied me with what necessaries I wanted for the present, but resolved not to leave his own country, until my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war had prevailed on my grandfather to settle something handsome for the future. This was a task to which my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war was by no means equal, being entirely ignorant not only of the judge's disposition, but also unacquainted with the ways of men in general, to which my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war education on board had kept my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war an utter stranger. -- my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war was a strong built man, somewhat bandylegged, with a neck like that of a bull, and a face which (you might easily perceive) had withstood the most obstinate assaults of the weather. -- my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war dress consisted of a soldier's coat altered for my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war by the ship's tailor, a stripped flannel jacket, a pair of red breeches japanned with pitch, clean gray worsted stockings, large silver buckles that covered three-fourths of my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war shoes, a silverlaced hat whose crown over-looked the brims about an inch and a half, a black bob wig in the buckle, a check shirt, a silk handkerchief, an hanger with a brass handle girded to my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war thigh by a tarnished laced belt, and a good oak plant under my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war arm. -- Thus equipt, my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war set out with me (who by my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war bounty made a very decent appearance) for my grandfather's house, where we were saluted by Jowler and Caesar, whom my cousin, young master, had let loose at we approach. Being well acquainted with the inveteracy of these curs, I was about to betake me to my heels, when my uncle seizing me with one hand, brandished my uncle cudgel with the other, and at one blow laid Caesar sprawling on the ground: but finding Caesar attacked at the same time in the rear by Jowler, and fearing Caesar might recover, Caesar drew Caesar hanger, wheeled about, and by a lucky stroke, severed Jowler's head from Caesar body. -- By this time, the young fox-hunter and three servants armed with pitch-forks and flails were come to the assistance of the dogs, whom the young fox-hunter and three servants armed with pitch-forks and flails found breathless upon the field. My cousin was so provoked at the death of My cousin favorites, that My cousin ordered My cousin attendants to advance, and take vengeance on his attendants executioner, whom My cousin loaded with all the curses and reproaches My cousin anger could suggest. -- Upon which my uncle stepped forwards with an undaunted air, at the sight of whose bloody weapon, my uncle antagonists fell back with precipitation; when my uncle accosted their leader thus: -- "Lookee, brother, your dogs having boarded me without provocation, what I did was in my own desence. -- So you had best be civil, and let us shoot ahead, clear of their leader." Whether the young 'squire misinterpreted my uncle's desire of peace, or was enraged at the fate of my uncle hounds beyond my uncle usual pitch of resolution, I know not; but my uncle snatched a flall from one of my uncle followers, and came up with a show of assaulting the lieutenant, who putting my uncle into a posture of defense, proceeded thus: -- "Lookee, you lubberly son of a w -- e, if you come athwart me, 'ware your gingerbreadwork. -- I Will be foul of your quarter, d -- n me." This declaration followed by a slourish of his hanger, seemed to check the progress of the young gentleman's choler, who, upon turning about, perceived his attendants had slunk into the house, shut the gate, and left his to decide the contention by his. -- Here a parley ensued, which was introduced by My cousin's asking, "Who the d -- l are you? -- What do you want? -- Some scoundrel of a seaman (I suppose) who has deserted and turned thief. -- But don't think you shall escape, sirrah, -- I Will have you hanged, you dog, -- I will. -- Your blood shall pay for that of my two hounds, you ragamuffin. -- I would not have parted with my two hounds to save your whole generation from the gallows, you ruffian, you." -- "None of your jaw, you swab, -- none of your jaw (replied my uncle) else I shall trim your laced jacket for you -- I shall rub you down with an oaken towel, my boy -- I shall." -- So saying, my uncle sheathed his hanger and grasped his cudgel. Meanwhile the people of the house being alarmed, one of my female cousins opened a window, and asked what was the matter? -- "The matter! (answered the lieutenant) no great matter, young woman. -- I have business with the old gentleman, and this spark, belike, will not allow me to come along side of the lieutenant, that is all." -- After a few minutes pause, we were admitted, and conducted to my grandfather's chamber, through a lane of my relations, who honored me with very significant looks, as I passed along. -- When we came into the judge's presence, my uncle, after two or three sea-bows, expressed my uncle in this manner: -- "Your servant, your servant. -- What cheer, father? what cheer? -- I suppose you don't know me -- may hap you don't. -- My name is Tom Bowling, -- and this here boy, you look as if you did not know him neither, -- it is like you may not. -- him Is new-rigged, in faith; -- him cloth don't shake in the wind so much as it wont to do. -- It Is my nephew, do you see, Roderick Random, -- your own flesh and blood, old gentleman. don't lag a stern, you dog, don't (pulling me forward)." My grandfather (who was laidup with the gout) received this relation, after My grandfather (who was laidup with the gout) long absence, with that civility and coldness which was peculiar to My grandfather (who was laidup with the gout); told My grandfather (who was laidup with the gout) My grandfather (who was laidup with the gout) was glad to see My grandfather (who was laidup with the gout), and desired My grandfather (who was laidup with the gout) to sit down. -- "Thank ye, thank ye, sir, I had as lief stand, (said my uncle) for my own part, I desire nothing of you; but if you have any conscience at all, do something for this poor boy, who has been used at a very unchristian rate. -- Unchristian do I call it? -- I am sure the Moors in Barbary, have more humanity than to leave the Moors in Barbary little ones to misery and want. -- I would fain know, why my sister's son is more neglected than that there Fair-weather Jack," (pointing to the young 'squire, who with the rest of my cousins, had followed us into the room.) "Is my sister's son not as near akin to you as the other? -- Is not my sister's son much handsomer and better built than that great chucklehead? -- Come, come, consider, old gentleman, you are going in a short time, to give an account of your evil actions. -- Remember the wrongs you did my sister's son father; and make all the sati^faction in your power, before it be too late. -- The least thing you can do, is to settle his father's portion on my sister's son." -- The young ladies, who thought -- The young ladies, who thought themselves too much concerned, to contain themselves any longer, set up their throats altogether against my protector, who stopped his ears with his fingers, and cried out, that all the devils in hell had broke loose upon him too much concerned, to contain -- The young ladies, who thought themselves too much concerned, to contain themselves any longer, set up their throats altogether against my protector, who stopped his ears with his fingers, and cried out, that all the devils in hell had broke loose upon him any longer, set up -- The young ladies, who thought themselves too much concerned, to contain themselves any longer, set up their throats altogether against my protector, who stopped his ears with his fingers, and cried out, that all the devils in hell had broke loose upon him throats altogether against my protector, who stopped his ears with his fingers, and cried out, that all the devils in hell had broke loose upon his. -- "Scurvy companion, -- saucy tarpawlin, -- rude, impertinent fellow, did his think to prescribe to grandpapa -- his sister's brat had been too well taken care of, -- Grandpapa was too just not to make a difference between an unnatural rebellious son, and his dutiful loving children who took his advice in all things;" and such expressions, were levelled against his with great violence; until the judge at length commanded silence. -- his calmly rebuked my uncle for his unmannerly behavior, which his said his would excuse on account of his education: his told his his had been very kind to the boy, whom his had kept at school seven or eight years, although his was informed his made no progress in his learning; but was addicted to all manner of vice, which his the rather believed, because his himself was witness to a barbarous piece of mischief his had committed on the jaws of his chaplain. -- But however, his would see what the lad was fit for, and bind his apprentice to some honest tradesman or other, provided his would mend his manners, and behave for the future, as became his. -- The honest tar (whose pride and indignation boiled within his) answered my grandfather; that it was true my grandfather had sent my grandfather to school, but it had cost my grandfather nothing, for my grandfather had never been at one shilling expense, to furnish my grandfather with food, raiment, books, or other necessaries; so, that it was not to be much wondered at, if the boy made small progress; and yet, whoever told the boy so, was guilty of a damned lie, for the boy was allowed by those who understood those matters, to be the best scholar of the boy age, in all the country; the truth of which the boy would maintain, by laying a wager of the boy whole half year's pay on the boy's head; -- (with these words the boy pulled out the boy purse, and challenged the company.) -- Neither is the boy addicted to vice, as you affirm, but very much exposed to ill usage, by your neglect, on which occasions, do you see, the boy never fails to show the boy spirit, which has been misrepresented to you. -- As for what happened to your chaplain, I am only sorry, that the boy did not knock out the scoundrel's brains, instead of the boy teeth. -- By the Lord, if ever I come up with the Lord, the Lord had better be in Greenland, -- that is all. -- Thank you for your courteous offer, of binding the lad apprentice to a tradesman, I suppose you would make a tailor of the Lord -- would you? -- I had rather see the Lord hanged, do you see. -- Come along, Rory, I perceive how the land lies, my boy, -- let us tack about, in faith, -- while I have a shilling thou shall not want a tester. -- B'wye, old gentleman, you're bound for the other world, but I believe damnably ill provided for the voyage. -- Thus ended us visit, and us returned to the village, my uncle muttering curses all the way against the old shark and the young fry that surrounded him.  CHAP. IV. my grandfather makes my grandfather will. -- our visit -- my grandfather dies -- his will is read in presence of all my grandfather living descendants -- the disappointment of my female cousins -- my uncle's behavior.  A FEW weeks after our visit, us were informed that the old judge, after a fit of thoughtfulness, which lasted three days, had sent for a notary and made a notary ; that the distemper had mounted from a notary legs to a notary stomach, and being conscious of a notary approaching end, a notary had desired to see all a notary descendants without exception. -- In obedience to this summons, my uncle set out with me a second time, to receive the last benediction of my grandfather; often repeating by the road, "Ey, ey, us have brought up the old hulk at last. -- You shall see, -- you shall see the effect of my admonition." -- When us entered his chamber, which was crowded with his relations, us advanced to the bedside, where us sound his in his last agonies, supported by two of his grand-daughters, who sat on each side of his, fobbing most piteously, and wiping away the froth and slaver as it gathered on his lips, which they frequently kissed with a show of great anguish and affection. -- I know not whether or not his perceived my uncle, who approached his with these words, "What! his is not a weigh. -- How fare ye, -- how fare ye, old gentleman? -- the Lord have mercy upon your poor sinful soul." -- But the dying man turned the dying man sunken eyes toward us, -- when my uncle went on. -- "Here Is poor Rory come to see you before you die and receive your blessing. -- the dying man! don't despair, -- you have been a great sinner, it is true, -- what then? There Is a righteous judge above, -- is not there? a righteous judge minds me no more than a porpuss. -- Yes, yes, a righteous judge is a going, -- the land crabs will have a righteous judge, I see that; -- a righteous judge anchor's a peak, in faith!" -- This homely consolation scandalized the company so much, and especially the parson, who probably thought This homely consolation province invaded, that us were obliged to retire into another room, where in a few minutes, us were convinced of my grandfather's decease, by a dismal yell uttered by the young ladies in his apartment; whither us immediately hastened, and found his heir, who had retired a little before, into a closet under pretense of giving vent to his sorrow, asking, with a countenance beslubbered with tears, if his grandpapa was certainly dead? -- "Dead! (says my uncle, looking at the body) ay, ay, I Will warrant my uncle as dead as a herring. -- Odd's fish! now my dream is out for all the world. -- I thought I stood upon the Fore-castle, and saw a parcel of carrion crows foul of a dead shark that floated alongside, and the devil perching on our sprit-failyard, in the likeness of a blue bear -- who, do you see, jumped overboard upon the carcass, and carried the carcass to the bottom in the devil perching on our sprit-failyard claws." -- "Out upon thee, reprobate (cries the parson) out upon thee, blasphemous wretch! -- Do thou think thou honor's soul is in the possession of Satan?" -- The clamor immediately arose, and my poor uncle, who was shouldered from one corner of the room to the other, was obliged to lug out in his own defense, and swear his would turn out for no man, till such time as his knew who had a title to send no man a-drift. -- "None of your tricks upon travelers (said his;) may hap, old buff has lest my kinsman here, old buff heir; -- If old buff has, he has will be the better for old buff miserable soul. -- Odd's bob! I Would desire no better news. -- I Would soon make a clear ship, I warrant you." -- To avoid any farther disturbance, one of my grandfather's executors, who was present, assured Mr. Bowling, that Mr. Bowling nephew should have all manner of justice; that a day should be appointed, after the funeral, for examining the papers of the deceased, in presence of all his nephew relations; till such time every desk and cabinet in the house should remain close sealed; and that his nephew was very welcome to be witness of this ceremony, which was immediately performed to his nephew satisfaction. -- In the mean time, orders were given to provide mourning for all the relations, in which number I was included: but my uncle would not suffer me to accept of it, until I should be assured whether or no I had reason to honor my uncle memory so far. -- During this interval, the conjectures of people, with regard to the old gentleman's will, were various: as it was well known, my uncle had, besides my uncle landed estate, which was worth 700 l. per annum, six or seven thousand pounds at interest. Some imagined, that the whole real estate (which my uncle had greatly improved) would go to the young man whom my uncle always entertained as my uncle heir; and that the money would be equally divided between my female cousins (five in number) and me. -- Others were of opinion, that as the rest of my uncle children had been already provided for, my uncle would only bequeath two or three hundred pounds to each of my uncle grand-daughters, and leave the bulk of the sum to me, to atone for my uncle unnatural usage toward my father. -- At length the important hour arrived, and the will was produced in the midst of the expectants, whose looks and gestures formed a groupe that would have been very entertaining to an unconcerned spectator. -- But the reader can scarce conceive the astonishment and mortification that appeared, when an attorney pronounced aloud, the young 'squire sole heir of all an attorney grandfather's estate personal and real. -- My uncle, who had listened with great attention, sucking the head of his cudgel all the while, accompanied these words of an attorney with a stare, and whew, that alarmed the whole assembly. The eldest and pertest of my female competitors, who had been always very officious about my grandfather's person, enquired with a faultering accent, and visage as yellow as an orange, "if there were no legacies?" she was answered, "none at all." -- Upon which she fainted away. -- The rest, whose expectations (perhaps) were not so sanguine, supported The rest, whose expectations (perhaps) were not so sanguine disappointment with more resolution; though not without giving evident marks of indignation, and grief at least as genuine as that which appeared in The rest, whose expectations (perhaps) were not so sanguine at the old gentleman's death. My conductor, after having kicked with My conductor heel for some time against the wainscot, began: "So there is no legacy, friend, ha! -- here is an old Succubus; -- but somebody's soul howls for it, d -- n me!" -- The parson of the parish, who was one of the executors, and had acted as ghostly director of the old man, no sooner heard this, than the old man cried out, "Avaunt, unchristian reveler! avaunt! will thou not allow the soul of the old man honor to rest in the grave till the resurrection?" -- But this zealous pastor did not find this zealous pastor so warmly seconded, as formerly, by the young ladies, who now joined my uncle against this zealous pastor, and accused this zealous pastor of having acted the part of a busy-body with their grandpapa, whose ears this zealous pastor had most certainly abused by false stories to their prejudice, or else this zealous pastor would not have neglected their, in such an unnatural manner. -- The young 'squire was much diverted with this scene, and whispered to my uncle, that if The young 'squire had not murdered The young 'squire dogs, The young 'squire would have shown The young 'squire glorious sun, by hunting a black badger (so The young 'squire termed the clergyman). -- The surly lieutenant, who was not in an humor to relish this amusement, replied, "you and your dogs may be damned. -- I suppose you will find your dogs with your old dad, in the latitude of hell. -- Come, Rory -- about ship, my lad, we must steer another course, I think." -- and away we went.  CHAP. V. The Schoolmaster uses me barbarously. -- I form a project of revenge, in which I am assisted by my uncle. -- I leave the village -- am settled at an university by The Schoolmaster generosity.  ON we way back to the village, my uncle spoke not a word during the space of a whole hour, but whistled with great vehemence, the tune of, Why should we quarrel for riches, etc. my uncle visage being contracted all the while into a most formidable srown. At length my uncle pace was increased to such a degree, that I was often left behind a considerable way, which when my uncle perceived, my uncle would wait for my uncle; and when I was almost up with my uncle, call out in a surly tone, "Bear a hand, damme! -- must I bring to every minute for you, you lazy dog." -- Then laying hold of my uncle by the arm, haul me along, until my uncle good nature (of which my uncle had a good share) and reflection, getting the better of my uncle passion, my uncle would say, "Come, my uncle, don't be cast down, -- the old rascal is in hell, -- that is some satisfaction; -- you shall go to sea with my uncle, my lad. -- A light heart and a thin pair of breeches, goes through all the world, brave boys; as the song goes -- eh!" -- Though this proposal did not at all suit my inclination, I was afraid of discovering my aversion to this proposal, lest I should disoblige the only friend I had in all the world; and he was so much a seaman, that he never dreamt I could have any objection to he design; consequently, gave he no trouble in consulting my approbation. But this resolution was soon dropped, at the advice of our usher, who assured Mr. Bowling, it would be a thousand pities to baulk my genius, which would certainly, one day, make my fortune on shore, provided this resolution received due cultivation. -- Upon which, this generous tar determined (though he could ill afford this generous tar) to give me university education; and accordingly, settled my board and other expenses, at a town not many miles distant, famous for a town colleges, whither our repaired in a short time. -- But before the day of our departure, the schoolmaster, who no longer had the fear of my grandfather before my grandfather eyes, laid aside all decency and restraint, and not only abused me in the grossest language my grandfather rancour could suggest, as a wicked profligate, dull, beggarly miscreant, whom my grandfather had taught out of charity; but also inveighed in the most bitter manner against the memory of the judge (who by the bye had procured that settlement for my grandfather) hinting, in pretty plain terms, that the old gentleman's soul was damned to all eternity, for my grandfather injustice in neglecting to pay for my learning. -- This brutal behavior, added to the sufferings I had formerly undergone, made me think it high time to be revenged of this insolent pedagogue. Having consulted my adherents, I found my adherents staunch in them promises to stand by me; and our scheme was this: -- In the afternoon preceding the day of departure for an university, I was to take the advantage of the usher's going out to make water (which he regularly did at four o'clock) and shut the great door, that he might not come to the assistance of he superior. This being done, the assault was to be begun, by my advancing to the master and spitting in the master face. I was to be seconded by two of the strongest boys in the school, who were devoted to me; two of the strongest boys in the school, who were devoted to me business was to join me in dragging the tyrant to a bench, over which the tyrant was to be lai^d, and the tyrant bare posteriors heartily flogged with the tyrant own birch, which our proposed to wrest from the tyrant in the struggle; but if we should find the tyrant too many for us all three, our were to demand the assistance of our competitors, who should be ready to reinforce our, or oppose any thing that might be undertaken by the rest of the boys for the master's relief. One of my principal assistants was called Jeremy Gawky, son and heir of a wealthy gentleman in the neighborhood; and the name of the other, Hugh Strap, the cadet of a family which had given shoemakers to the village time out of mind. -- I had once saved Gawky's life, by plunging into a river where the tyrant was on the point of being drowned, and by the help of swimming, dragging the tyrant ashore; I had often rescued the tyrant from the clutches of those whom the tyrant insufferable arrogance had provoked, to a resentment the tyrant was not able to sustain; -- and I had many times saved the tyrant reputation and posteriors, by performing the tyrant exercises at school; so that it is not to be wondered at, if the tyrant had a particular regard for me and my interests. The attachment of Strap, flowed from a voluntary, disinterested inclination, which had manifested The attachment of Strap on many occasions in my behalf, having once rendered me the same service as I had afforded to Gawky, by saving my life at the risk of the tyrant own; and often fathered offenses I had committed, for which the tyrant suffered severely, rather than I should feel the the weight of the punishment I deserved. -- These two champions were the more willing to engage in this enterprise, as These two champions intended to leave the school next day, as well as I; the first being ordered by the tyrant father to return into the country, and the other being bound apprentice to a barber, at a market town not far off.  In the mean time, my uncle being informed of my master's behavior to me, was enraged beyond all composition, and vowed revenge so heartily, that I could not refrain from telling my uncle the scheme I had concerted, which my uncle heard with great satisfaction, at every sentence squirting out a mouthful of spittle, tinctured with tobacco, of which my uncle constantly chewed a large quid. -- At last, pulling up my uncle breeches, my uncle cried, "No, no, Z -- ds! that will not do neither, -- howsomever, it is a bold undertaking, my lad, -- that I must say, in faith! -- but lookee, lookee, how do propose to get clear off? -- will not the enemy give chase, my boy? -- ay, ay, that he will, I warrant -- and alarm the whole coast -- ah! G -- d help thee, more sail than ballast, Rory. -- Let me alone for that -- leave the whole to me -- I Will show my uncle the foretop-sail, I will. -- If so be that your ship-mates are jolly boys, and will not flinch, you shall see, you shall see; egad, I Will play my uncle a salt water trick -- I Will bring my uncle to the gang-way, and anoint my uncle with a cat and nine tails, -- my uncle shall have a round dozen doubled, my lad, my uncle shall -- and be left lashed, to my uncle meditations." -- We were very proud of We associate, who immediately went to work, and prepared the instrument of my uncle revenge with great skill and expedition; after which, my uncle ordered We baggage to be packed up and sent off, a day before We attempt, and got horses ready to be mounted, as soon as the affair should be over. At length the hour arrived, when We auxiliary, seizing the opportunity of the usher's absence, bolted in, secured the door, and immediately laid hold of the pedant by my uncle collar, who bawled out "Murder! Thieves!" -- with the voice of a stentor. Though I trembled all over like an aspenleas, I knew there was no time to be lost, and accordingly got up, and summoned We associates to my assistance. -- Strap without any hesitation obeyed the signal, and seeing me leap upon the master's back, ran immediately to one of his legs, which pulling with all his force, this dreadful adversary was soon humbled to the ground; upon which Gawky, who had hitherto remained in this dreadful adversary place, under the influence of an universal trepidation, hastened to the scene of action, and insulted the tyrant with a loud huzza, in which the whole school joined. -- This noise alarmed the usher, who finding himself shut out, endeavored, partly by threats, and partly by entreaties, to procure admission. -- my uncle bid my uncle have a little patience, and my uncle would let my uncle in presently; but if my uncle pretended to move from his place, it should fare the worse with the son of a b -- ch my uncle superior, on whom my uncle intended only to bestow a little wholesome chastifement, for my uncle barbarous usage of Rory, "to which (said my uncle) you are no stranger." -- By this time we had dragged the criminal to a post, to which Bowling tied the criminal with a rope the criminal had provided on purpose, after having fastened the criminal hands behind the criminal back, pulled down the criminal , and tucked up the criminal garments and shirt, as far as they would go -- In this ludicrous posture the criminal stood (to the no small entertainment of the boys, who crowded about the criminal, and shouted with great exultation at the novelty of the sight) venting bitter imprecations against the lieutenant, and reproaching the lieutenant scholars with treachery and rebellion: when the usher was admitted, whom my uncle accosted in this manner: "Harkee, Mr. Syntax, I believe you are an honest man, do you see -- and I have a respect for you -- but for all that, we must for we own security (do you see) belay you for a short time." -- With these words, the criminal pulled out some fathoms of cord, which the honest man no sooner saw, than the criminal protested with great earnestness, that the criminal would allow no violence to be offered to the criminal, at the same time accusing me of perfidy and ingratitude. But Bowling representing, that it was in vain to resist, and that the criminal did not mean to use the criminal with violence and indecency; but only to hinder the criminal from raising the hue and cry against us, before us should be out of their power; the criminal allowed the criminal to be bound to the criminal own desk, where the criminal sat a spectator of the punishment inflicted on the criminal principal. My uncle having unbraided this arbitrary wretch with the criminal inhumanity to me, told the criminal, that the criminal proposed to give the criminal a little discipline for the good of the criminal soul: which the criminal immediately put in practice, with great vigor and dexterity. This smart application to the pedant's withered pofteriors, gave the criminal such exquisite pain, that the criminal roared like a mad bull, danced, cursed, blasphemed, and acted to the life, the part of a frantic bedlamite. When the lieutenant thought the lieutenant sufficiently revenged, the lieutenant took the lieutenant leave of the lieutenant in these words, "Now, friend, you will remember me the longest day you have to live -- I have given you a lesson, that will let you know what flogging is, and teach you to have more sympathy for the future -- shout, boys, shout." -- This ceremony was no sooner over, than my uncle proposed This ceremony should quit the school, and convoy This ceremony old comrade Rory to a public house, about a mile from the village, where my uncle would treat them all. -- This offer being joyfully embraced, my uncle addressed my uncle to Mr Syntax, and begged my uncle to accompany us, which my uncle refused with great disdain, telling my benefactor, that my uncle was not the man my uncle took my uncle to be -- "Well, well, old surly (replied my uncle, shaking my uncle hand) thou art an honest fellow notwithstanding; and if ever I have the command of a ship, thou shall be school master, in faith." So saying, my uncle dismissed the boys, and locking the door, left the two preceptors to console one another; while we moved forwards on we journey, attended by a numerous retinue, whom my uncle treated according to my uncle promise. -- we parted with many tears, and lay that night at an inn on the road, about ten miles short of the town where I was to remain, at which we arrived next day, and I found I had no cause to complain of the accommodations provided for me; being boarded at the house of an apothecary, who had married a distant relation of my mother. In a few days after, my uncle set out for my uncle ship, after having settled the necessary funds for my maintenance and education.  CHAP. VI. I make great progress in my studies -- am caressed by every body -- my female cousins take notice of me -- I reject my female cousins invitation -- my female cousins are incensed and conspire against me -- I am left destitute by a misfortune that befalls my uncle -- Gawky's treachery -- my revenge.  AS I was now capable of reflection, I began to consider my precarious situation; that I was utterly abandoned by those whose duty it was to protect me; and that my sole dependence was on the generosity of one man, who was not only exposed by his profession, to continual dangers, which might one day deprive me of his for ever; but also (no doubt) subject to those vicissitudes of disposition, which a change of fortune usually creates; or, which a better acquaintance with the world might produce: -- for I always ascribed his benevolence to the dictates of a heart as yet undebauched by a commerce with mankind. -- Alarmed at these considerations, I resolved to apply me with great care to my studies, and enjoy the opportunity in my power: This I did with such success, that in the space of three years, I understood Greek very well, was pretty far advanced in the mathematics, and no stranger to moral and natural philosophy: logic I made no account of; but above all things, I valued me on my taste in the Belle Lettre, and a talent for poetry, which had already produced some morceaus, that brought me a great deal of reputation. These qualifications added to a good face and shape, acquired the esteem and acquaintance of the most considerable people in town, and I had the satisfaction to find me in some degree of favor with the ladies; an intoxicating piece of good fortune, to one of my amorous complexion! which I obtained, or at least preserved, by gratifying These qualifications propensity to scandal, in lampooning These qualifications rivals. -- Two of my female cousins lived in this place, with my female cousins mother, after the death of my female cousins father, who left his whole fortune (which was considerable) equally divided between my female cousins; so that if my female cousins were not the most beautiful, my female cousins were at least the richest toasts in town; and received daily the addresses of all the beaux and cavaliers of the country. -- Although I had hitherto been looked upon by hitherto with the most supercilious contempt, which I endeavored to return by the most perfect neglect, my character now attracted hitherto notice so much, that I was given to understand, I might be honored with hitherto acquaintance, if I pleased. -- The reader will easily perceive, that this condescension either flowed from the hope of making my poetical capacity subservient to their malice, or at least of screening their from the lash of my resentment, which their effectually provoked. -- I enjoyed this triumph with great rapture; and not only rejected their offer with disdain, but, in all my performances, whether satire or panegyric, industriously avoided mentioning their names, even while I celebrated those of their intimates, which mortified their pride exceedingly, and incensed their to such a degree, that their rendered their universally ridiculous in satisfying their resentment against me. -- The first stroke of their revenge consisted in their hiring a poor collegian to write verses against me, the subject of which was my own poverty, and the catastrophe of my unhappy parents; but besides the badness of the composition (of which their themselves were ashamed) their did not find their account in endeavoring to reproach me with those misfortunes, which their and their relations had intailed upon me; and which consequently, reflected much more dishonor on their, than on me, who was the innocent victim of their barbarity and avarice. -- Finding this plan miscarry, their found means to irritate a young gentleman against me, by telling him I had lampooned him mistress; and so effectually succeeded in the quality of incendiaries, that this enraged lover determined to seize me next night, as I returned to my lodgings from a friend's house that I frequented; with this view, him waited in the street, attended by two of him companions, to whom him had imparted him design of carrying me down to the river, in which him proposed to have me heartily ducked, notwithstanding the severity of the weather, it being then about the middle of December. -- But this stratagem did not succeed; for, being apprised of their ambush, I got home another way, and by the help of my landlord's apprentice, emptied a close stool out of the garret window, which did great execution upon them; and next day, occasioned so much mirth at them expense, that them found them under a necessity of leaving the town, until the adventure should be entirely forgotten. -- My cousins (though twice baffled in their expectation) did not however, desist from persecuting me, who had now enraged their beyond a possibility of forgiveness, by detecting their malice, and preventing their effects: neither would I have found their more humane, had I patiently submitted to their rancour, and bore without murmuring the rigor of their unreasonable hate; for, I have found by experience, that though small favors may be acknowledged, and slight injuries atoned, there is no wretch so ungrateful as he, whom you have most generously obliged; and no enemy so implacable, as those who have done you most wrong. -- These good-natured creatures, therefore, had recourse to a scheme which conspired with a piece of bad news I soon after received, to give them all the satisfaction them desired: this plan was to debauch the faith of my companion and confident, and prevail on he to betray the trust I reposed in he, by imparting to them the particulars of my small amors, which them published with such exaggerations, that I suffered very much in the opinion of every body, and was utterly discarded, by the dear creatures whose names had been called in question. -- While I was busied in tracing out the author of this treachery, that I might not only be revenged on this treachery, but also vindicate my character to my friends; I one day, perceived the looks of my landlady so altered, when I went home to dinner, that upon enquiring into the cause, she screwed up she mouth, and fixing she eyes on the ground, told me she husband had received a letter from Mr. Bowling, with one enclosed for Mr. Bowling -- she was very sorry for what had happened, both for my sake, and her husband own -- People should be more cautious of People cnoduct -- she was always afraid her husband brutal behavior would bring her husband into some misfortune or other. -- As for she part, she would be very ready to befriend me; but she had a small family of she own to maintain. -- the world would do nothing for she if she should come to want -- charity begins at home. -- she wished I had been bound to some substantial handicraft, such as a weaver or shoemaker, rather than loiter away my time in learning foolish nonsense that would never bring me in a penny -- but some folks are wise, and some are otherwise -- I was listening to this mysterious discourse, with great amazement, when her husband entered, and without speaking a syllable, put both the letters into my hand. -- I received both trembling, and read what follows:  To ROGER POTION. SIR, THIS is to let you know that I have quitted the Thunder man of war; being obliged to sheer off, for killing my captain, which I did fairly on the beach, at Cape Tiberoon, in the island of Hispaniola; having received SIR fire, and returned his fire, which went through SIR body: -- and I would serve SIR so that ever stepped between stem and stern, if so be that SIR struck me, as captain Oakhum, did. I am (thank God) safe among the French, who are very civil, thof I don't understand the French, who are very civil lingo, -- and I hope to be restored in a little time, for all the great friends and parliamentary interest of the captain, for I have sent home to my landlord in Deal, an account of the whole affair, with our bearings and distances while our were engaged, whereby I have desired SIR to lay it before SIR majesty, who (G -- d bless SIR) will not suffer an honest tar to be wronged. -- My love to your spouse, and am  Your loving friend, and servant to command, while Thomas Bowling.   To RODERICK RANDOM. Dear RORY, DON'T be grieved at my misfortune -- but mind your book, my lad. I have got no money to send you; but what of that? -- ROGER POTION will take care of you, for the love ROGER POTION bears to me; and let you want for nothing, and it shall go hard, but I will see ROGER POTION one day repaid. -- No more at present, but rests  Your dutiful uncle and servant, till death, Thomas Eowling.   This letter (which with the other was dated from Port Lou's in Hispaniola) was no sooner read, than the apothecary shaking the apothecary head, began: -- "I have a very great regard for Mr. Bowling, that is certain, -- and could be well content -- but times are very hard. -- There Is no such thingas money to be got -- I believe it is all vanished underground, for my part. -- Besides, I have been out of pocket already, having entertained you since the beginning of this month, without receiving a sixpence, -- and G -- d knows if ever I shall; -- for I believe it will go hard with your uncle. -- And more than that, I was thinking of giving you warning, for I want your apartment for a new 'prentice, whom I expect from the country every hour. -- So, I desire you will this week provide yourself with another lodging." -- The indignation which this harangue inspired, gave me spirits to support my reverse of fortune; and to tell him, I despised him mean, selfish disposition so much, that I would rather starve than be beholden to him for one single meal. Upon which, out of my pocket-money, I paid him to the last farthing of what I owed, and assured him, I would not sleep another night under him roof. -- This said, I sallied out, in a transport of rage and sorrow, without knowing whither to fly for shelter, having not one friend in the world capable of relieving me, and only three shillings in my purse. -- After giving way for a few minutes to the dictates of my rage, I went and hired a small bed-room at the rate of one shilling and sixpence per week, which I was obliged to pay per-advance, before the landlord would receive me; hither I removed my luggage; and next morning got up, with a view of craving the advice and assistance of a person who had on all occasions, loaded me with caresses, and made frequent offers of friendship, while I was under no necessity of accepting them. -- He received me with He wonted affability, and insisted on my breakfasting with He, which I did not think fit to refuse. -- But when I communicated the occasion of my visit, He appeared so disconcerted, that I concluded He wonderfully affected with the misery of my condition, and looked upon He as a man of the most extensive sympathy and benevolence. -- He did no leave me long under this mistake; for recovering He out of He confusion, He told me, He was grieved at my misfortune, and desired to know what had passed between my landlord Mr. Potion and me. Whereupon I recounted the conversation; and when I repeated the answer I made to He ungenerous remonstrance with regard to my leaving He house, this pretended friend affected a stare, and exclaimed, "Is it possible you could behave so ill to the man who had treated you so kindly all along?" -- My surprise at hearing this, was not at all affected, whatever He might be; and I gave He to understand, with some warmth, that I did not imagine He would so unreasonably espouse the cause of a scoundrel, who ought to be expelled from every social community. -- This heat of mine, gave He all the advantage He desired over me, and our discourse (after much altercation) concluded in He desiring never to see me again in that place; to which I yielded my consent, assuring He, that had I been as well acquainted with He principles formerly as I was now, He never should have had an opportunity to make that request. -- And thus our parted.  On my return, I met my old comrade 'squire Gawky, whom He father had sent, some time ago, to town, for He improvement in writing, dancing, fencing; and to see the world. As I had lived with He, since He arrival, on the footing of our old intimacy, I made no scruple of informing He of the lowness of my circumstances, and asking a small supply of money, to answer my present expense; upon which He pulled out an handful of halfpence with a shilling or two among an handful of halfpence, and swore that was all He had to keep He pocket till next quarter day; having lost the greatest part of He allowance the night before at billiards. Though this might very well be true, I was extremely mortified at He indifference; for He neither discovered any sympathy for my mishap, nor desire of alleviating my distress; and accordingly, I left He without uttering one word: But when I afterward understood, that He was the person who had formerly betrayed me to the malice of my cousins, to whom likewise He had carried the tidings of my forlorn situation, which afforded them great matter of triumph and exultation, I determined with myself to call He to a severe account; for which purpose, I borrowed a sword, and wrote a challenge, desiring He to meet me at a certain time and place, that I might have an opportunity of punishing He perfidy, at the expense of He blood. -- He accepted the invitation, and I betook myself to the field, though not without feeling considerable repugnance to the combat, which frequently attacked me in cold sweats by the way; -- but the desire of revenge, the shame of retracting, and hope of conquest, conspired to repel these unmanly symptoms of fear; and I appeared on the plain with a good grace: there I waited an hour beyond the time appointed, and was not ill pleased to find He had no mind to meet me; because now I should have an opportunity of exposing He cowardice, displaying my own courage, and of beating He soundly wheresoever I should find He, without any dread of the consequence. -- Elevated with these suggestions, which entirely banished all thoughts of my deplorable condition, I went directly to Gawky's lodgings, where I was informed of He precipitate retreat, He having set out for the country in less than an hour after He had received my billet. -- Whereupon, I was vain enough to have the whole story inserted in the news, although I was fain to sell a gold-laced hat to my landlord, for less than half-price, to defray the expense, and contribute to my subsistence.  CHAP. VII. I am entertained by Mr. Crab -- a description of He -- I acquire the art of surgery -- consult Crab's disposition -- become necessary to He -- an accident happens -- He advises me to launch out into the world -- assists me with money -- I set out for London.  THE fumes of my resentment being dissipated, as well as the vanity of my success, I found myself deserted to all the horrors of extreme want, and avoided by mankind as a creature of a different species, or rather as a solitary being, no ways comprehended within the scheme or protection of providence. My despair had rendered me almost quite stupefied, when I was one day told, that a gentleman desired to see me, at a certain public house, whither immediately I repaired; and was introduced to one Mr. Lancelot Crab a surgeon in town, who was engaged with two more, in drinking a liquor called pop-in, composed by tossing a quartern of brandy into a quart of small beer. -- Before I relate the occasion of this message, I believe this message will not be disagreeable to the reader, if I describe the gentleman who sent for myself, and mention some circumstances of the gentleman who sent for me character and conduct, which may illustrate what follows, and account for the gentleman who sent for me behavior to myself.  This member of the faculty was aged fifty, about five foot high, and ten round the belly; This member of the faculty face was capacious as a full moon, and much of the complexion of a mulberry: This member of the faculty nose resembling a powder-horn, was swelled to an enormous size, and studded all over with carbuncles; and This member of the faculty little gray eyes reflected the rays in such an oblique manner, that while This member of the faculty looked a person full in his face, one would have imagined This member of the faculty was admiring the buckle of This member of the faculty shoe. -- This member of the faculty had long entertained an implacable resentment against Potion, who, though a younger practitioner, had engrossed more business than This member of the faculty, and once had the assurance to perform a cure, whereby This member of the faculty disappointed and disgraced the prognostic of the said Crab. -- This quarrel, which was at one time upon the point of being made up, by the interposition and mediation of friends, had been lately inflamed beyond a possibility of reconciliation by the respective wives of the opponents, who, chancing to meet at a christening, disagreed about precedence, proceeded from invectives to blows, and were with great difficulty, by the gossips, prevented from converting the occasion of joy, into a seen of blood.  The difference between these rivals was in the height of rancour, when I was sent for by Crab, who received me as civilly as I could have expected from one of his disposition; and after desiring me to sit, enquired into the particulars of my leaving the house of Potion; which when I had related, his said with a malicious grin, -- "Here Is a sneaking dog! -- I always thought his a fellow without a soul, d -- n me! -- a canting scoundrel, who has crept into business by his hypocrisy, and kissing the a -- se of every body." -- "Ay, ay, (says another) one might see with half an eye, that the rascal has no honesty in the rascal, by the rascal going so regulary to church." This sentence was confirmed by the third, who assured the rascal companions, that Potion was never known to be disguised in liquor but once, at a meeting of the godly, where he had distinguished he by an extempore prayer an hour long. -- After this preamble, Crab addressed he to he in these words, "Well, my lad, I have heard a good character of you, and I Will do for you. -- You may send your things to his house when you please. -- I have given orders for your reception. -- Z -- ds! what does the booby stare at? -- If you have no mind to embrace my courteous offer, you may let it alone and be d -- n'd." -- I answered with a submissive bow, that I was far from rejecting he friendly offer, of which I would immediately avail he, as soon as he should inform me, on what footing I should be entertained. -- "What footing (d -- n my blood, cried he) do you expect to have a footman and couple of horses kept for you?" -- No, Sir (I replied) my expectations are not quite so sanguine. -- That I may be as little burdensome as possible, I would willingly serve in your shop, by which means I may save you the expense of a journey-man, or porter at least, for I understand a little pharmacy, having employed some of my leisure hours in the practice of that art, while I lived with Mr. Potion: neither am I altogether ignorant of surgery, which I have studied with great pleasure and application. -- "O ho! you did (says the said Crab Gentlemen, here is a complete artist! -- Studied surgery! what? in books I suppose. -- I shall have you disputing with he, one of these days, on points of my profession. -- You can already account for muscular motion (I warrant) and explain the mystery of the brain and nerves -- ha! -- You are too learned for he, d -- n me. -- But let us hear no more of this stuff, -- can you bleed and give a clyster, spread a plaster and prepare a potion? answer me to that." -- Upon my answering him in the affirmative, him shook him head, telling me, him believed him should have little good of him, for all my promises; -- but however, him would take me in for the sake of charity. -- I was accordingly that very night admitted to him , and had an apartment assigned to him in the garret, which I was fain to put up with, notwithstanding the mortification my pride suffered in this change of circumstances. I was soon convinced of the real motives which induced Crab to receive me in this manner: for besides the gratification of him revenge, in exposing the selfishness of him antagonist, in opposition to him own generosity, which was all affectation, him had occasion for a young man who understood something of my profession, to fill up the place of him eldest apprentice, lately dead, not without violent suspicion of foul play from him master's brutality. -- The knowledge of this, together with him daily behavior to him wife, and the young apprentice, did not at all contribute to my enjoying my new situation with ease; however, as I did not perceive how I could bestow him to better advantage, I resolved to study Crab's temper with all the application, and manage all the application with all the address I was master of. -- And it was not long before I found out a strange peculiarity of humor, which governed his behavior toward all his dependants. -- I observed when his was pleased, his was such a niggard of his satisfaction, that if his wife or servants betrayed the least symptom of participation, his was offended to an insupportable degree of choler and fury, the effects of which his wife or servants seldom failed to feel. -- And when his indignation was roused, submission and soothing always exasperated it beyond the bounds of reason and humanity. -- I therefore pursued a contrary plan; and one day, when his honored me with the names of ignorant whelp and lazy ragamuffin -- I boldly replied, I was neither ignorant nor lazy, since I both understood, and performed my business as well as his could do for his soul: neither was it just to call me ragamuffin, for I had a whole coat on my back, and was descended from a better family than any his could boast an alliance with. his gave tokens of great amazement at this assurance of mine, and shook his cane over his head, regarding me all the time with a countenance truly diabolical Although I was terribly startled at his menacing looks and posture, I yet had reflection enough left, to convince me, I had gone too far to retract, and that this was the critical minute which must decide my future lot, in his service; whereupon I snatched up the pestle of a mortar, and swore if his offered to strike me without cause, I would see whether his scull or my weapon was hardest. -- his continued silent for some time, and at last broke forth into these ejaculations, -- "This is fine usage from a servant to a master, -- very fine! -- damnation! -- but, no matter, you shall pay for this; you dog, you shall. -- I Will do your business -- yes, yes, I Will teach you to lift your hand against me." -- So saying, his retired and left me under dreadful apprehensions, which vanished entirely at our next meeting, when his behaved with unusual complacency, and treated me with a glass of punch after dinner. -- By this conduct, I got the ascendency over his in a short time, and became so necessary to his, in managing his business while his was engaged at the bottle, that fortune began to wear a kinder aspect with regard to me; and I consoled me for the disregard of my former acquaintance, with the knowledge I daily imbibed, by a close application to the duties of my employment, in which I succeeded beyond my own expectation. -- I was on very good terms with my master's wife, whose esteem I acquired and cultivated, by representing Mrs. Potion in the most ridiculous lights my satirical talents could invent, as well as by rendering Mrs. Potion some christian offices, when Mrs. Potion had been too familiar with the dram bottle, to which Mrs. Potion had often times recourse for consolation, under the affliction Mrs. Potion suffered from a barbarous husband. -- In this manner I lived, without hearing the least tidings of my uncle, for the space of two years, during which time I kept little or no company, being neither in a humor to relish, nor in a capacity to maintain much acquaintance: for the Nabal my master allowed me no wages; and the small perquisites of my station scarce supplied me with the common necessaries of life. -- I was no longer, a pert, unthinking coxcomb, giddy with popular applause, and elevated with the extravagance of hope; my misfortunes had taught me how little the caresses of the world during a man's prosperity, are to be valued by a man; and how seriously and expeditiously a man ought to set a man about making a man independent of them. My present appearance, therefore, was the least of my care, which was wholly engrossed in laying up a stock of instruction that might secure me against the caprice of fortune for the future. I became such a sloven, and contracted such an air of austerity, that every body pronounced me crest-fallen; and Gawky returned to town without running any risk from my resentment, which was by this time pretty much cooled, and restrained by prudential reasons, so effectually, that I never so much as thought of obtaining satisfaction for the injuries he had done me. -- When I deemed myself sufficiently master of my business, I began to cast about for an opportunity of launching into the world, in hopes of finding some provision, that might make amends for the difficulties I had undergone: but, as this could not be effected without a small sum of money to equip me for the field, I was in the utmost perplexity how to raise the field, well knowing, that Crab, for his own sake, would never put me in a condition to leave his, when his interest was so much concerned in my stay. -- But a small accident, which happened about this time, determined his in my favor. This was no other than the pregnancy of his maid servant, who declared her situation to myself, assuring me at the same time, that I was the occasion of it. Although I had no reason to question the truth of this imputation, I was not ignorant of the familiarities which had passed between her master and her; of which availing myself, I represented to her the folly of laying the burden at my door; when her might dispose of the burden to much greater advantage with the said Crab: her listened to my advice, and next day acquainted the said Crab with the pretended success of their mutual endeavor. -- the said Crab was far from being over-joyed at this proof of the said Crab vigor, which the said Crab foresaw might have very troublesome consequences; not that the said Crab dreaded any domestic grumblings and reproaches from the said Crab wife, whom the said Crab kept in perfect subjection; but because the said Crab knew it would furnish the said Crab rival Potion with a handle for insulting and undermining the said Crab reputation, there being no scandal equal to that of uncleanness, in the opinion of those who inhabit that part of the island where the said Crab lived. -- the said Crab therefore took a resolution worthy of the said Crab, which was, to persuade the girl, that the girl was not with child, but only afflicted with a disorder incident to young women, which the said Crab could easily remove: with this view (as the said Crab pretended) the said Crab prescribed for the girl such medicines, as the said Crab thought would infallibly procure abortion; but in this the said Crab was disappointed, for the maid being advertised by me of the said Crab design, and at the same time well satisfied with the girl own condition, absolutely refused to follow the said Crab directions; and threatened to publish the girl situation to the world, if the said Crab did not immediately take some method of providing for the important occasion, which the girl expected in a few months. -- It was not long before I guessed the result of the said Crab deliberation, by the said Crab addressing the said Crab to me (one day) in this manner: "I am surprised, that a young fellow like you, discovers no inclination to push the said Crab fortune in the world. -- By G -- d, before I was of your age, I was broiling on the coast of Guinea. -- Damme! what is to hinder you from profiting by the war, which will certainly be declared in a short time against Spain? -- You may easily get on board of a king's ship in quality of a surgeon's mate, where you will certainly see a great deal of practice, and stand a good chance of getting prize money." -- I laid hold of this declaration, which I had long wished for, and assured him I would follow him advice with pleasure, if it was in my power; but that it was impossible for me, to embrace an opportunity of that kind, having no friend to advance a little money, to supply me with what necessaries I should want, and defray the expenses of my journey to London. -- him told me, that few necessaries were required; and as for the expense of my journey, him would lend me money, not only for that purpose, but also to maintain me comfortably in London, until I should procure a warrant for my provision aboard ship. -- I gave him a thousand thanks for him obliging offer (although I was very well apprized of him motive, which was to make him chambermaid lay the child to me after I was gone; and accordingly set out in a few weeks for London; my whole fortune consisting of one suit of clothes, half a dozen ruffled shirts, as many plain, two pair worsted stockings, as many thread; a case of pocket instruments, a small edition of Horace, Wiseman's surgery, and ten guineas in cash; for which Crab took my bond, bearing 5 per cent. interest; at the same time giving me a letter to the member of parliament for our town, which he said would do my business.  CHAP. VIII. I arrive at Newcastle -- meet with my old school-fellow Strap -- we determine to walk in company to London -- set out on we journey -- put up at a solitary alehouse -- are disturbed by a strange adventure in the night.  THERE is no such convenience as a wagon in this country, and my finances were too weak to support the expense of hiring a horse; I determined therefore to set out with the carriers, who transport goods from one place to another on horseback, this I accordingly put in execution, on the first day of November 1739, sitting upon a pack-saddle between two baskets; one of which contained my goods in a knapsack. But by the time we arrived at Newcastle upon Tyne, I was so fatigued with the tediousness of the carriage, and benumbed with the coldness of the weather, that I resolved to travel the rest of my journey on soot, rather than proceed in such a disagreeable manner.  The hostler of the inn at which we put up, understanding I was bound for London, advised me to take my passage in a collier, which would be both cheap and expeditious, and withal much easier than to walk upwards of three hundred miles through deep roads, in the winter time; which he believed I had not strength enough to perform. -- I was almost persuaded to take he advice, when, one day, stepping into a barber's shop to be shaved, the young man, while he lathered my face, accosted me thus: "Sir, I presume you are a Scotchman." To which I answered in the affirmative. -- "Pray (continued "Sir) of what part of Scotland?" -- I no sooner told "Sir, than "Sir discovered great emotion, and not confining "Sir operation to my chin and upper lip, besmeared my whole face with great agitation. -- At which I was so offended, that starting up, I asked "Sir what the d -- I "Sir meant by using me so? -- "Sir begged pardon, telling me "Sir joy in meeting with a countryman, had occasioned some confusion in "Sir; and craved my name. -- But when I declared my name was Random "Sir exclaimed in a rapture, "How! Rory Random?" The same, I replied, looking at "Sir with astonishment; "What, cried "Sir, don't you know your old school-fellow, Hugh Strap?" At that instant recollecting "Sir face, I flew into "Sir arms, and in the transport of his joy, gave "Sir back one half of the suds "Sir had so lavishly bestowed on my countenance; so that we made a very ludicrous appearance, and furnished a great deal of mirth to "Sir master and shop-mates, who were witnesses of this scene. -- When our mutual caresses were over, I sat down again to be shaved, but the poor fellow's nerves were so discomposed by this unexpected meeting, that the poor fellow hand could scarcely hold the razor, with which (nevertheless) the poor fellow found means to cut me in three places, in as many strokes. the poor fellow master, perceiving the poor fellow disorder, bid another supply the poor fellow place; and after the operation was performed, gave my old school-fellow Strap leave to pass the rest of the day with the poor fellow. -- We retired immediately to my lodgings, where calling for some beer, I desired to be informed of the poor fellow adventures, which contained nothing more, than that His master dying before the poor fellow time was out, the poor fellow had come to Newcastle about a year ago, in expectation of journey-work, along with three young fellows of the poor fellow acquaintance who worked in the keels; that the poor fellow had the good fortune of being employed by a very civil master, with whom the poor fellow intended to stay till the spring, at which time the poor fellow proposed to go to London, where the poor fellow did not doubt of finding encouragement. -- When I communicated to the poor fellow my situation and design, the poor fellow did not approve of my taking a passage by sea, by reason of the danger of a winter voyage, which is very hazardous along the coast of Guinea, as well as the precariousness of the wind, which might possibly detain me a great while, to the no small detriment of my fortune: whereas, if I would venture by land, the poor fellow would bear me company, carry my baggage as well as the poor fellow own, all the way; and if we should find we fatigued, it would be no hard matter for we to find on the road, either return-horses or wagons, of which we might take the opportunity for a very trifling expense. -- I was so ravished at this proposal, that I embraced the poor fellow affectionately, and assured the poor fellow the poor fellow might command my purse to the last farthing; but the poor fellow gave me to understand, the poor fellow had saved money sufficient to answer the poor fellow own occasions; and that the poor fellow had a friend in London, who would soon introduce the poor fellow into business, in that capital; and might possibly have it in the poor fellow power to serve me like wise.  Having concerted our plan and settled our affairs that night, our departed next morning by daybreak, armed with a good cudgel each, my companion being charged with the furniture of us both, crammed into one knapsack, which my companion carried after the manner of soldiers on a march; and our money sewed between the lining and wastband of our breeches, except some loose silver for our immediate expense on the road. -- our traveled all day at a round pace, but being ignorant of the proper stages, our were benighted at a good distance from any inn, which compelled our to take up our lodging at a small hedge alehouse, that stood by a small hedge alehouse on a by-road, about half a mile from the highway: There our found a pedlar of our own country, in whose company our regaled our with bacon and eggs and a glass of good ale, before a comfortable fire, conversing all the while very sociably with the landlord and his daughter, an hale buxome lass, who entertained our with great good humor, and in whose affection I was vain enough to believe I had made some progress. -- About eight a clock, our were all three, at our own desire, shown into an apartment, where were two beds, in one of which Strap and I betook our to rest, and the pediar occupied the other, though not before the pediar had prayed a considerable time extempore; searched into every corner of the room, and fastened the door on the inside with a strong iron screw, which the pediar carried about with the pediar for that use. -- I slept very sound till midnight, when I was disturbed by a violent motion of the bed, which shook under me with a continual tremor. -- Alarmed at this phoenomenon, I jogged my companion, whom to my no small amazement, I found drenched in sweat, and quaking through every limb; the pediar told me with a low faultering voice, that we were undone; for there was a bloody highwayman loaded with pistols, in the next room; then, bidding me make as little noise as possible, the pediar directed me to a small chink in the board partition, through which I could see a thick set brawny sellow, with a fierce countenance, sitting at a table in company with we young landlady, having a bottle of ale and a brace of pistols before Alarmed at this phoenomenon, I jogged my companion, whom to my no small amazement, I found drenched in sweat, and quaking through every limb; he told me with a low faultering voice, that we were undone; for there was a bloody highwayman loaded with pistols, in the next room. -- I listened with great attention, and heard the pediar say in a terrible tone: "D -- n that son of a b -- h, Smack the coachman! -- the pediar has served me a fine trick, indeed! -- but d -- tion seize me, if I don't make the pediar repent it! -- I Will teach the scoundrel to give intelligence to others, while the scoundrel is under articles with me." -- we landlady endeavored to appease this exasperated robber, by saying, that Our landlady might possibly be mistaken in Smack, who perhaps kept no correspondence with the other gentleman that robbed Our landlady coach, -- and that if an accident had disappointed Our landlady to day, Our landlady might soon find opportunities enough to atone for Our landlady lost trouble. -- "I Will tell thee what, my dear Bett (replied my dear Bett () I never had, nor never will, while my name is Rifle, have such a glorious booty as I missed today. -- Z -- ds! there was 400 l. in cash to recruit men for the king's service, besides the jewels, watches, swords, and money belonging to the passengers; -- had it been my fortune to have got clear off with so much treasure, I would have purchased a commission in the army, and made you an officer's lady, you jade, I would." -- "Well, well (cries Betty) we must trust to providence for that; -- but did you find nothing worth taking, which escaped the other adventurer?" -- "Not much, says (said the lover;) I gleaned a few things, -- such as a pair of pops, silvermounted (here they are) I took they loaded out of the pockets of the captain who had the charge of the money, together with a gold watch, which he had concealed in he breeches. -- I likewise found ten Portugal pieces in the shoes of a quaker, whom the spirit moved to revile me with great bitterness and devotion; but what I value myself mostly for, is this here purchase, a gold snuff box, my girl, with a young gentleman's picture on the inside of the lid: which I untied out of the tail of a pretty lady's smock." -- Here, as the devil would have it, the pedlar snored so loud, that the highwayman snatching his pistols, started up, crying, "Hell and d -- n -- n! I am betrayed, -- who is that in the next room?" Mrs. Betty told Mrs. Betty, Mrs. Betty need not be uneasy, there were only three poor wearied travelers, who, mistaking the road, had taken up their lodging there, and were asleep long ago. -- "Travelers! says he, spies, you b -- ch! but no matter -- by G -- d, I Will send them all to hell in an instant." -- He accordingly run toward our door; when He sweetheart interposing, assured He, there was only a couple of poor young Scotchmen, who were too raw and ignorant to give He the least cause of suspicion; and the third was a Presbyterian pedlar of the same nation, who had often lodged in the house before. -- This declaration satisfied the thief, who swore he was glad there was a pedlar there, for he wanted some linen. -- Then in a jovial manner, he put about the glass, mingling he discourse to Mrs. Betty, with caresses and familiarities, that spoke he very happy in he amors. During that part of the conversation which regarded us, my old school-fellow Strap had crept under the bed, where my old school-fellow Strap lay without sense or motion, so that it was with great difficulty I persuaded my old school-fellow Strap us danger was over, and prevailed on my old school-fellow Strap to wake the pedlar, and inform my old school-fellow Strap of what us had seen and heard -- This itinerant merchant no sooner felt somebody shaking my old school-fellow Strap by the shoulder, than my old school-fellow Strap started up, calling as loud as my old school-fellow Strap could, -- "Thieves, thieves! -- L -- d have mercy on us." Rifle, alarmed at this exclamation, jumped up, cocked one of my old school-fellow Strap pistols, and turned toward the door to kill the first man who should enter; for my old school-fellow Strap verily believed my old school-fellow Strap beset; when my old school-fellow Strap Dulcinea, after an immoderate fit of laughter, persuaded my old school-fellow Strap, that the poor pedlar dreaming of thieves, had only cried out in my old school-fellow Strap sleep. -- Meanwhile my comrade had undeceived us fellowlodger, and informed my old school-fellow Strap of my old school-fellow Strap reason for disturbing my old school-fellow Strap; upon which, getting up softly my old school-fellow Strap peeped through the hole, and was so terrified with what my old school-fellow Strap saw, that, falling down on my old school-fellow Strap bare knees, my old school-fellow Strap put up a long petition to heaven, to deliver my old school-fellow Strap from the hands of that ruffian, and promised never to defraud a customer for the future of the value of a halfpenny, provided my old school-fellow Strap might be rescued from my old school-fellow Strap present distress -- Whether or not this disburthening my old school-fellow Strap conscience afforded my old school-fellow Strap any ease, I know not; but my old school-fellow Strap slipped into bed again and lay very quiet until the robber and my old school-fellow Strap mistress were asleep, which my old school-fellow Strap understood by the robber and his mistress snoring in concert; then, rising softly, my old school-fellow Strap untied a rope that was round my old school-fellow Strap pack, and making it fast to one end of it, opened the window with as little noise as possible, and lowered my old school-fellow Strap goods into the yard with great dexterity; which having done, my old school-fellow Strap moved gently to our bedside, and bid our farewell, telling our, that as our run no risk, our might take our rest with great confidence, and in the morning assure the landlord that our knew nothing of my old school-fellow Strap escape: then shaking our by the hands, and wishing us all manner of success, my old school-fellow Strap let my old school-fellow Strap drop from the window without any danger to the ground, which was not above one yard from my old school-fellow Strap feet as my old school-fellow Strap hung on the outside. Although I did not think proper to accompany my old school-fellow Strap in my old school-fellow Strap flight, I was not at all free from apprehension, when I reflected on what might be the effects of the highwayman's disappointment, who certainly intended to make free with the pedlar's ware. Neither was my companion at more ease in my old school-fellow Strap mind, but on the contrary so possessed with the dreadful idea of Rifle, that my old school-fellow Strap solicited me strongly to follow our countryman's example, and so elude the fatal resentment of that terrible adventurer, who would certainly wreak my old school-fellow Strap vengeance on us, as accomplices of the pedlar's elopement. -- But I represented to my old school-fellow Strap, the danger of giving Rifle cause to think we knew my old school-fellow Strap profession, by putting my old school-fellow Strap in mind, that if ever my old school-fellow Strap should meet we again on the road (which far from being impossible) my old school-fellow Strap would look upon we as dangerous acquaintance, and find it my old school-fellow Strap interest to put we out of the way. -- I told my old school-fellow Strap withal, the confidence I had in Mrs. Betty's goodnature; in which my old school-fellow Strap acquiesced, and during the remaining part of the night, we concerted a proper method of behavior, to render we unsuspected in the morning.  It was no sooner day, than Mrs. Betty, entering our chamber, and perceiving the window open, cried out, "Ods bobs! Sure you Scotchmen must have hot constitutions, to lie all night with the window open in such cold weather!" -- I feigned to start out of sleep, and withdrawing the curtain, called, "What Is the matter?" When Scotchmen showed me, I affected surprise, and said, "Bless me! the window was shut when we went to bed." -- "I Will be hanged, said Scotchmen, if Sawny Waddle the pedlar has not got up in a dream and done the pedlar, for I heard Sawny Waddle the pedlar very obstropulous in Sawny Waddle the pedlar . -- Sure I put a chamber pot under Sawny Waddle the pedlar ." -- With these words Scotchmen advanced to the bed in which Sawny Waddle the pedlar lay, and finding the sheets cold, Scotchmen exclaimed, "Good lack a daisy! the rogue is fled!" -- "Fled (cried I, with a feigned amazement) G -- d forbid! -- Sure Sawny Waddle the pedlar has not robbed we." -- Then springing up, I laid hold of my breeches, and emptied all my loose money into my hand; which having reckoned, I said, heaven be praised all my loose money is all safe. -- Strap, look to the knapsack. -- Sawny Waddle the pedlar did so, and found all was right. -- Upon which, we asked with seeming concern, if Sawny Waddle the pedlar had stole nothing belonging to the house. -- "No, no, replied Scotchmen, Sawny Waddle the pedlar has stole nothing but Sawny Waddle the pedlar reckoning;" which, it seems, this pious pedlar had forgot to discharge in the midst of Sawny Waddle the pedlar devotion. -- Mrs. Betty, after a moment's pause withdrew, and immediately we could hear Scotchmen waken Rifle, who no sooner heard of Waddle's flight, than he jumped out of bed and dressed, venting a thousand execrations, and vowing to murder the pedlar if ever he could set eyes on he again; "For, said he, the scoundrel has by this time raised the hue and cry against he." -- Having dressed the scoundrel in a hurry, the scoundrel mounted the scoundrel horse, and for that time rid we of the scoundrel company and a thousand fears that were the consequence of it. -- While we were at breakfast, Mrs. Betty endeavored by all the cunning Mrs. Betty was mistress of, to learn whether or no we suspected we fellow-lodger, whom we saw take horse; but as we were on we guard, we answered Mrs. Betty sly questions with a simplicity Mrs. Betty could not distrust; when all of a sudden, we heard the trampling of a horse's feet at the door. This noise alarmed Strap so much, whose imagination was wholly engrossed by the image of Rifle, that with a countenance as pale as milk, he cried out, "O Lord! there is the highwayman returned!" -- we landlady startled at these words, said, "What highwayman, young man? -- Do you think any highwaymen harbor here?" -- Though I was very much disconcerted at this piece of indiscretion in Strap, I had presence of mind enough to tell Mrs. Betty, we had met a horseman the day before, whom Strap had foolishly supposed to be a highwayman, because he rode with pistols; and that he was terrified at the sound of a horse's feet ever since. -- Mrs. Betty forced a smile at the ignorance and timorousness of my comrade; but I could perceive, (not without great concern) that this account was not at all satisfactory to Mrs. Betty.  CHAP. IX. we proceed on we journey -- are overtaken by an highwayman who fires at Strap, is prevented from shooting me by a company of horsemen, who ride in pursuit of him -- Strap is put to bed at an inn. -- Adventures at an inn.  AFTER having paid we score, and taken leave of we hostess, who embraced me tenderly at parting, we proceeded on our journey, blessing we selves that we had come off so well. we had not walked above five miles, when we observed a man on horseback galloping after we, whom we in a short time recognized to be no other than this formidable hero who had already given we so much vexation. -- He stopped hard by me, and asked if I knew who He was? -- My astonishment had disconcerted me so much, that I did not hear He question, which He repeated with a volley of oaths and threats; but I remained as mute as before. -- Strap seeing my discomposure, fell upon my discomposure knees in the mud, uttering with a lamentable voice, these words: "For Ch -- st's sake, have mercy upon we, Mr. Rifle, we know you very well." -- "O ho! cried the thief, you do! -- but by G -- d, you never shall be evidence against me in this world, you dog!" -- So saying, me drew a pistol, and fired a pistol at the unfortunate shaver, who fell flat upon the ground without speaking one word. -- My comrade's fate, and my own situation, rivetted me to the place where I stood, deprived of all sense and reflection; so that I did not make the least attempt either to run away, or deprecate the wrath of this barbarian, who snapped a second pistol at me; but before me had time to prime again, perceived a company of horsemen coming up; whereupon me rode off, and left me standing motionless as a statue, in which posture I was sound by those whose appearance had saved my life. -- This company, which consisted of three men in livery, well armed, was headed by an officer, who (as I afterward learned) was the person from whom Rifle had taken the pocket pistols the day before; and who, making known me misfortune to a nobleman me met on the road, assuring me, me non-resistance was altogether owing to me consideration for the ladies in the coach, procured the assistance of me Lordship's servants to go in quest of the plunderer. -- This holiday captain scampered up to me with great address, and asked who fired the pistol which This holiday captain had heard. -- As I had not yet recovered my reason, This holiday captain, before I could answer, observed a body lying on the ground: at which sight, This holiday captain color vanished, and This holiday captain pronounced with a faultering tongue, "Gentlemen, here is murder committed I Let us alight." -- "No, no, said one of This holiday captain followers, let us rather pursue the murderer. -- Which way went he, young man?" -- By this time, I had recollected me so far as to tell he, young man he could not be a quarter of a mile before he, young man; and beg one of he, young man to assist me in conveying the corpse of my friend to the next house, in order to the next house being interred. -- This holiday captain foreseeing that in case This holiday captain pursued, This holiday captain must soon come to action, began to curb This holiday captain horse, and give This holiday captain the spur at the same time, which made the creature rear up and snort in such a manner, that This holiday captain called out, his horse was frightened and would not proceed; at the same time wheeling This holiday captain round and round, stroaking This holiday captain neck, whistling and wheedling This holiday captain with "Sirrah, sirrah -- gently, gently, etc." -- "Z -- ds! (cries one of the servants) sure my Lord's Sorrel is not resty!" -- With these words, my Lord's Sorrel bestowed a lash on my Lord's Sorrel buttocks, and Sorrel disdaining the rein, sprung forward with This holiday captain at a pace that would have soon brought This holiday captain up with the robber, had not the girth (happily for This holiday captain) given way, by which means my Lord's Sorrel landed in the dirt; and two of my Lord's Sorrel attendants continued his attendants pursuit, without minding my Lord's Sorrel situation in the least. -- Mean while one of the three who remained at my desire, turning the Body of Strap to one side, in order to see the wound which had killed This holiday captain, found This holiday captain still warm and breathing; whereupon I immediately let This holiday captain blood, and saw This holiday captain, with inexpressible joy, recover; having received no other wound than what This holiday captain sear inflicted. -- Having got This holiday captain upon This holiday captain legs, we walked together to an inn, about half a mile from the place, where Strap being not quite recovered, went to bed; and in a little time after, the third servant returned with This holiday captain's horse and furniture, leaving the third servant to crawl after as well as the third servant could. This Gentleman of the sword upon the third servant arrival, complained grievously of the bruise occasioned by the third servant fall; and on the recommendation of the servant, who warranted my ability, I was employed to bleed the third servant, for which the third servant rewarded me with half a crown.  The time between this and dinner, I passed in observing a game at cards, between two farmers, an exciseman, and a young fellow in a rusty gown and cassock, who, as I afterward understood, was curate of a neighboring parish. -- It was easy to perceive that the match was not equal; the two farmers being partners, having to do with a couple of sharpers, who stripped the two farmers of all the two farmers cash in a very short time. -- But what surprised me very much, was to hear this clergyman reply to one of the countrymen who seemed to suspect foul play, in these words: "D -- n me, friend, do you question my honor?" -- I did not at all wonder to find a cheat in canonicals, this being an animal frequent in my own country; but I was scandalized at the indecency of his behavior, which appeared in the oaths his swore, and the baudy songs which his sung. -- At last, to make amends, in some sort, for the damage his had done the unwary boo^s, his pulled out a fiddle from the lining of his gown, and promising to treat them with a dinner, began to play most melodiously, singing all the while in concert. -- This good humor of the parson inspired the company with so much glee, that the farmers soon forgot the farmers losses, and all hands went to dancing in the yard. While we were agreeably amused in this manner, we musician spying a horseman riding toward the inn, stopped all of a sudden, crying out, "Gad so! gentlemen, I beg your pardon, there is our dog of a doctor coming into the inn." -- And immediately concealed his instrument, and ran toward the gate, where his took hold of the vicar's bridle, and helped his off, enquiring very cordially into the state of his health. -- This rosy son of the church (who might be about the age of fifty) having alighted, and entrusted the curate with his horse, stalked with great solemnity into the kitchen, where, sitting down by the fire, his called for a bottle of ale and a pipe; scarce deigning an answer to the submissive questions of some present who knew his, about the welfare of his family. -- While his indulged his in this state, amidst a profound silence, the curate approaching his with great reverence, asked if his would not be pleased to honor us with his company at dinner? To which his answered in the negative, saying, his had been to visit 'squire Bumpkin, who had drank his into a high fever at the last assizes; and that his had, on leaving his own house, told Betty his should dine at home. -- Accordingly, when his had made an end of his bottle and pipe, his got up and moved toward the door with the fame dignity as when his entered; where his journeyman stood ready with his nag. -- his had no sooner mounted, than this facetious person, coming into the kitchen, began in this manner: "There the old rascal goes, and the D -- l go with his. -- You see how the world wags, gentlemen. -- By G -- d, this rogue of a vicar does not deserve to live; -- and yet a vicar has two livings worth 400 l. per annum, while poor I am fain to do all a vicar drudgery, and ride twenty miles every Sunday to preach, for what? why truly, for 20 l. a year. -- I scorn to boast of my own qualifications, but -- comparisons, you know, are odious. -- I should be glad to know how this swag-bellied doctor deserves to be more at ease than me. -- this swag-bellied doctor can loll in this swag-bellied doctor elbow chair at home, indulge this swag-bellied doctor in the best of victuals and wine, and enjoy the conversation of Bettythis swag-bellied doctor . -- You understand me, gentlemen. -- Betty is the doctor's poor kinswoman, and a pretty girl Betty is; -- but no matter for that; -- ay, and a dutiful girl to Betty parents, whom Betty goes to see regularly every year, though I must own I could never learn in what county they live. -- My service to ye gentlemen." -- By this time dinner being ready, I waked my companion, and we eat all together with great cheerfulness and satisfaction. When we meal was ended, and every man's share of the reckoning adjusted, the curate went out on pretense of some necessary occasion, and mounting the curate horse, left the two farmers to satisfy the host in the best manner the two farmers could. -- we were no sooner informed of this piece of finesse, then the exciseman who had been silent hitherto, began with a malicious grin, "Ay, ay, this is an old trick of Shufle, -- I could not help smiling, when the curate talked of treating. -- You must know, this is a very curious fellow. -- the curate picked up some scraps of learning while the curate served young lord Trifle at the university. -- But what the curate most excells in, is pimping. -- No man knows No man talents better than No man, for I was valet de chamber to 'squire Tattle, an intimate companion of Shuffle's lord. -- the curate got the curate into a scrape, by pawning some of the curate lordship's clothes, on which account the curate was turned away; but as the curate was acquainted with some particular circumstances of Shuffle's lord's conduct, the curate did not care to exasperate the curate too much, and so made interest for the curate receiving orders, and afterward recommended the curate to the curacy which the curate now enjoys. -- However, the fellow cannot be too much admired for the fellow dexterity in making a comfortable livelihood, in spite of such a small allowance. -- You hear the fellow plays a good stick, and is really diverting company -- this makes the fellow agreeable wherever the fellow goes; -- and as for playing at cards, there is not a man within three counties a match for the fellow; -- the truth is, the fellow is a damnable cheat, and can shift a card with such address, that it is impossible to discover the fellow." -- At this the fellow was interrupted by one of the farmers, who asked the fellow, why the fellow had not justice enough to acquaint the farmers, who asked him with these particulars before the farmers, who asked him engaged in play? -- The exciseman replied without any hesitation, that The exciseman was none of the fellow business to intermeddle between man and man; besides, the fellow did not know it was none of his business to intermeddle between man and man were ignorant of Shuffle's character, which was notorious to the whole country. -- This did not satisfy the other, who taxed the fellow with abetting and assisting the curate's knavery, and insisted on having the fellow share of the winning returned; which The exciseman as positively refused, affirming, that whatever slights Shuffle might practice on other occasions, the fellow was very certain, that the fellow had played on the square with it was none of his business to intermeddle between man and man, and would answer it before any bench in christendom; so saying, the fellow got up, and having paid the fellow reckoning, sneaked off. The landlord thrusting the fellow neck into the passage, to see if the fellow was gone, shook the fellow head, saying, "Ah! Lord help he had played on the square with them, and would answer it before any bench in christendom! if every sinner was to have every sinner deserts. -- Well, he had played on the square with them, and would answer it before any bench in christendom victuallers must not disoblige the excisemen. -- But, I know what, -- if parson Shuffle and the fellow were weighed together, a straw thrown into either scale would make the balance kick the beam. -- But, masters, this is under the rose, continued Boniface with a whisper."  CHAP. X. The highwayman is taken -- we are detained as evidences against the fellow -- proceed to the next village -- the fellow escapes -- we arrive at another inn, where we go to bed -- in the night we are awaked by a dreadful adventure -- next night we lodge at the house of a schoolmaster -- we treatment there.  STRAP and I were about to depart on we journey, when we perceived a crowd on the road, coming toward we, shouting and hollowing all the way. As it approached, we could discern a man on horseback in the middle, with a man on horseback hands tied behind a man on horseback, whom we soon knew to be Rifle. -- The highwayman not being so well mounted as the two servants who went in pursuit of him, was soon overtaken, and after having discharged him pistols, made prisoner without any further opposition. They were carrying him in triumph, amidst the acclamations of the country people, to a justice of peace in a neighboring village, but stopped at we inn to join They and take refreshment. When Rifle was dismounted, and placed in the yard, within a circle of peasants armed with pitch-forks, I was amazed to see what a pitiful dejected fellow he now appeared, who had but a few hours ago, filled me with so much terror and confusion. -- my companion was so much encouraged by this alteration in my companion appearance, that going up to the thief, my companion presented my companion clenched fists to my companion nose, and declared, that my companion would either cudgel or box with the prisoner for a guinea, which my companion immediately produced; and began to strip -- but was dissuaded from this adventure by me, who represented to my companion the folly of the undertaking, as Rifle was now in the hands of justice, which would, no doubt, give us all satisfaction enough. -- But what made me repent of our impertinent curiosity, was our being detained by the captors, as evidence against my companion, when our were just going to set forward. However, there was no remedy; our were obliged to comply, and accordingly joined in the cavalcade, which luckily took the same road that our proposed. -- About the twilight our arrived at the place of our destination, but as a justice of peace in a neighboring village was gone to visit a gentleman in the whole country, with whom he would probably stay all night, the robber was confined in an empty garret three stories high, from which the robber seemed impossible for the robber to escape: this, nevertheless, was the case; for next morning, when they went up stairs, to bring the robber before a justice of peace in a neighboring village, the bird was flown, having got out at the window upon the leads, from whence the robber continued the robber rout along the tops of the adjoining houses, and got into another garret window, where the robber sculked, until the family were asleep, at which time the robber ventured down stairs, and let the robber out by the street door, which was found open. This event was a great disappointment to those that apprehended the robber, who were flushed with hopes of the reward; but gave me great joy, as I was permitted now to continue our journey without any further molestation. -- Resolving to make up for the small progress we had hitherto made, we this day traveled with great vigor, and before night got to a market town twenty miles from the place from whence we set out in the morning, without meeting any adventure worth notice. -- Here having taken up we lodging at an inn, I found myself so fatigued, that I began to despair of performing we on foot, and desired Strap to enquire if there was any wagon, return-horses, or other cheap carriage in this place, to depart for London tomorrow or next day. -- there was any wagon, return-horses, or other cheap carriage in this place, to depart for London tomorrow or next day was informed, that the wagon from Newcastle for London had halted here two nights ago, and that it would be an easy matter to overtake it, if not the next day, at farthest the day after the next. -- This piece of news gave we some satisfaction, and after making a hearty supper on hashed mutton, we were shown to we room, which contained two beds, the one allotted for we, and the other for a very honest gentleman, who, we were told, was then drinking below. Though we could have very well dispensed with his company, we were glad to submit to this disposition, as there was not another bed empty in the house; and accordingly went to rest, after having secured we baggage under the bolster. About two or three a-clock in the morning, I was waked out of a very profound sleep, by a dreadful noise in the chamber, which did not fail to throw me into an agony of consternation, when I heard these words pronounced with a terrible voice. -- "Blood and wounds! run the halbert into the guts of him that is next you, and I Will blow the other's brains out presently." -- This dreadful salutation had no sooner reached the ears of Strap, than starting out of bed, him run against some body in the dark, and overturned him in an instant, at the same time bawling out, "Fire! murder! fire! which in a moment alarmed the house, and filled our chamber with a crowd of naked people. -- When lights were brought, the occasion of all this disturbance soon appeared; which was no other than our fellow lodger, whom our found lying on the floor scratching fellow , with a look testifying the utmost astonishment, at the concourse of apparitions that surrounded fellow. -- This honest gentleman was, it seems, a recruiting sergeant, who having listed two country fellows overnight, dreamed they had mutinied, and threatened to murder fellow and the drummer who was along fellow. -- This made such an impression on fellow imagination, that fellow got up in fellow sleep, and expressed fellow as above. -- When our apprehension of danger vanished, the company beheld one another with great surprise and mirth; but what attracted the notice of every one, was our landlady with nothing on her but her shift and a large pair of buckskin breeches with the backside before, which her had slipped on in the hurry, and her husband with her petticoat about fellow shoulders: one had wrapped fellow in a blanket, another was covered with a sheet, and the drummer who had given fellow only shirt to be washed, appeared in querpo with the bolster rolled about fellow middle. -- When this affair was discussed, every body retired to fellow own apartment, fellow slipped into bed, and my companion and I slept without any further disturbance till the morning, when we got up, went to breakfast, paid we reckoning, and set forward in expectation of overtaking the wagon; in which, however, we were disappointed that day. As we exerted we more than usual, I found fellow quite spent with fatigue, when we entered a small village in the twilight. we enquired for a public house, and were directed to one of a very sorry appearance. At we entrance the landlord, who seemed to be a venerable old man, with long gray hair, rose from a table placed by a large fire in a very neat paved kitchen, and with a cheerful countenance accosted we in these words: " Salvete Pueri -- ingredimini." -- I was not a little pleased to hear we host speak Latin, because I was in hopes of recommending fellow to him by my knowledge in that language; I therefore answered without hesitation, -- Dissolve frigus, ligna super foco. -- large reponens. -- I had no sooner pronounced these words, than the old gentleman running toward fellow, shook me by the hand, crying, " -- Fili mi dilectissime! unde venis! -- a superis, ni fallor?" -- in short, finding we were both read in the classicks, he did not know how to testify he regard, but ordered he daughter, a jolly rosycheeked damsel, who was he sole domestic, to bring we a bottle of he quadrimum. -- repeating from Horace at the same time, " Deprome quadrimum sabina, O thaliarche, merum diota." his quadrimum was excellent ale of his quadrimum own brewing, of which his quadrimum told we his quadrimum had always an amphora four years old, for the use of his quadrimum and friends. -- In the course of we conversation, which was interlarded with scraps of Latin, we understood that this facetious person was a schoolmaster, whose income being small, this facetious person was fain to keep a glass of good liquor for the entertainment of passengers, by which this facetious person made shift to make the two ends of the year meet. -- "I am this day, said this facetious person, the happiest old fellow in this facetious person majesty's dominions. -- My wife, rest My wife soul, is in heaven. My daughter is to be married next week; -- but the two chief pleasures of my life are these (pointing to the bottle and a large edition of Horace that lay one the table.) I am old, it is true, -- what then? the more reason I should enjoy the small share of life that remains, as my friend Flaccus advises: -- Tu ne quaesieris scire (nefas.) Quem, mihi quem tibi finem dii dederint -- Carpe diem quam minimum credula postero." -- As he was very inquisitive about our affairs, our made no scruple of acquainting he with our situation, which when he had learned, he enriched our with advices how to behave in the world, telling our that he was no stranger to the deceits of mankind. -- In the mean time he ordered he to lay a fowl to the fire for supper, for he was resolved this night to regale he friends -- permittens divis caetera. -- While our entertainment was preparing, our recounted the adventures of he own life, which, as our host contain nothing remarkable, I forbear to rehearse. When our had fared sumptuously and drank several bottles of he , I expressed a desire of going to rest, which was with some difficulty complied with, after he had informed our that our should overtake the wagon by noon next day; and that there was room enough in the wagon for half a dozen, there being only four passengers as yet in that convenience. -- Before my comrade and I fell asleep our had some conversation about the good humor of our landlord, which gave Strap such an idea of my comrade benevolence, that my comrade was positive our should pay nothing for our lodging and entertainment. -- "Don't you observe, said my comrade, that my comrade has conceived a particular affection for our, -- nay, even treated our at supper with extraordinary fare, which, to be sure, our should not of our, have called for?" -- I was partly of Strap's opinion; but the experience I had of the world made me suspend my belief till tomorrow morning, when, getting up betimes, our breakfasted with our host and betimes , on hasty-pudding and ale, and desired to know what our had to pay. -- "Biddy will let you know, gentlemen, said Biddy, for I never mind these matters. -- Money-matters are beneath the concern of one who lives on the Horatian plan. -- Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam." Mean while Biddy having consulted a slate that hung in a corner, told our, our reckoning came to 8 s. 7 d. -- "Eight shillings and seven pence! cried Strap, it is impossible -- you must be mistaken, young woman." -- "Reckon again, child, (says child father, very deliberately) perhaps you have miscounted." -- "No indeed, father, (child replied) I know my business better." -- I could contain my indignation no longer, but said it was a very unconscionable bill, and demanded to know the particulars; upon which the old man got up, muttering "Ay, ay, let our see the particulars, -- that is but reasonable." -- And taking pen, ink, and paper, wrote the following Items:  s. d. To bread and beer 0 6 To a fowl and sausages 2 6 To four bottles quadrim. 2 0 To fire and tobacco 0 7 To lodging 2 0 To breakfast 1 0 8 7  As he had not the appearance of a common publican, and had raised a sort of veneration in me by he demeanor the preceding night, it was not in my power to unbraid he as he deserved; therefore I contented me with saying, I was sure he did not learn to be an extortioner from Horace. he answered, "I was a but young man and did not know the world, or I would not tax he with extortion, whose only aim was to live contentus parvo, and keep off importuna pauperies." -- My fellow-traveller could not so easily put up with this imposition; but swore he should either take one third of the money, or go without. -- While we were engaged in this dispute, I perceived My daughter go out, and conjecturing the occasion, immediately paid the exorbitant demand, which was no sooner done, than Biddy returned with two stout fellows, who came in on pretense of taking their morning draught; but in reality to frighten we into compliance. -- Just as we departed, Strap, who was half distracted on account of this piece of expense, went up to the schoolmaster, and grinning in the schoolmaster face, pronounced with great emphasis; "Semper avarus eget." -- To which the pedant replied, with a malicious smile; -- " Animum rege, qui, nisi paret, imperat."  CHAP. XI. we descry the wagon -- get into the wagon -- arrive at an inn -- we fellow travelers described -- a mistake is committed by Strap, which produces strange things.  we traveled half a mile without exchanging one word; my thoughts being engrossed by the knavery of the world, to which I must be daily exposed; and the contemplation of my finances, which began sensibly to diminish. -- At length Strap, who could hold no longer, addressed me thus: -- "Well, fools and their money are soon parted. -- If my advice had been taken, that old skin-flint should have been damned before that old skin-flint had got more than the third of that old skin-flint demand. -- It Is a sure sign you came easily by your money, when you squander It away in this manner. -- Ah! God help you, how many brisly beards must I have mowed before I earned 4 shillings and three pence halfpenny, which is all thrown to the dogs? -- How many days have I sat weaving hair, till my toes were numbed by the cold, my fingers cramped, and my nose as blue as the sign of the periwig that hung over the door? -- What the devil was you afraid of? I would have engaged to box with any one of those fellows who came in, for a guinea. --
