in quality of bar-keeper, by one of the ladies who had witnessed in her behalf at the Marshalsea; and who since that time had got credit with a wine merchant, whose favorite she was, to set up a convenient house of her own. -- Thither my fellow lodger repaired, after having taken leave of me, with a torrent of tears, and a thousand protestations of eternal gratitude; assuring me, she would remain in this new situation no longer than till she should pick up money sufficient to put her other design in execution.  As for my own part, I saw no resource but the army or navy, between which I hesitated so long, that I found myself reduced to a starving condition. -- My spirit began to accommodate itself to my beggarly fate, and I became so mean, as to go down toward Wapping, with an intention to enquire for an old school-fellow of mine, who (I understood) had got the command of a small coasting vessel, then in the river, and implore his assistance. -- But my destiny prevented this abject piece of behavior; for as I crossed Towerwharf, a squat tawny fellow, with a hanger by his side, and a cudgel in his hand, came up to me, calling, "Yo, ho! brother, you must come along with me." -- As I did not like his appearance, instead of answering his salutation, I quickened my pace in hopes of ridding myself of his company; which he perceiving, whistled aloud, and immediately another sailor appeared before me, who laid hold of me by the collar and began to drag me along. -- Not being of a humor to relish such treatment, I disengaged myself of the assailant, and with one blow of my cudgel, laid him motionless on the ground: and perceiving myself surrounded in a trice, by ten or a dozen more, exerted myself with such dexterity and success, that some of my opponents were fain to attack me with drawn cutlasses; and after an obstinate engagement, in which I received a large wound on the head, and another on my left cheek, I was disarmed, taken prisoner, and carried on board a pressing tender; where, after being pinioned like a malefactor, I was thrust down into the hold, among a parcel of miserable wretches, the sight of whom well nigh distracted me. -- As the commanding officer had not humanity enough to order my wounds to be dressed, and I could not use my own hands, I desired one of my fellow-captives who was unsettered, to take a handkerchief out of my pocket and tie it round my head to stop the bleeding. He pulled out my handkerchief ('it is true) but instead of applying it to the use for which I designed it, went to the grating of the hatchway, and with astonishing composure, sold it before my face to a bum-boatwoman A bum boat-woman, is one who sells bread, cheese, greens, liquor, and fresh provision to the sailors, in a small boat that lies along-side of the ship. then on board, for a quart of gin, with which he treated his companions, regardless of my circumstance and entreaties.  I complained bitterly of this robbery, to the midshipman on deck, telling him at the same time, that unless my hurts were dressed, I should bleed to death. But compassion was a weakness of which no man could justly accuse this person, who squirting a mouthful of dissolved tobacco upon me, through the gratings, told me, "I was a mutinous dog, and that I might die and be damned." -- Finding there was no other remedy, I appealed to patience, and laid up this usage in my memory, to be recalled at a fitter season. -- In the mean time, loss of blood, vexation and want of food, contributed, with the noisome stench of the place, to throw me into a swoon; out of which I was recovered by a tweak of the nose, administered by the tar who stood sentinel over us, who at the same time regaled me with a draught of flip, and comforted me with the hopes of being put on board of the Thunder next day, where I would be freed from handcuffs, and cured of my wounds by the doctor. -- I no sooner heard him name the Thunder, than I asked, if he had belonged to that ship long; and he giving me to understand, he had belonged to her five years, I enquired if he knew lieutenant Bowling? -- "Know lieutenant Bowling (said he) -- odds my life! and that I do; -- and a good seaman he is, as ever stepped upon forecastle, -- and a brave fellow as ever cracked biscuit; -- none of your Guinea pigs, -- nor your fresh water, wishy washy, fair-weather fowls. -- Many a taught gale of wind has honest Tom Bowling and I weathered together. -- Here Is his health with all my heart, wherever he is, a-loft or allow -- in heaven or in hell -- all is one for that -- he needs not be ashamed to show himself." -- I was so much affected with this elogium, that I could not refrain from telling him, I was lieutenant Bowling's kinsman; at which he expressed an inclination to serve me, and when he was relieved brought some cold boiled beef in a platter and biscuit, on which we supped plentifully, and afterward drank another can of flip together. While we were thus engaged, he recounted a great many exploits of my uncle, who (I found) was very much beloved by the ship's company, and pitied for the misfortune that happened to him in Hispaniola, which I was very glad to be informed was not so great as I imagined; for captain Oakhum had recovered of his wounds, and actually at that time, commanded the ship. Having by accident, in my pocket my uncle's letter written from Port Louis, I gave it my benefactor (whose name was Jack Rattlin) for his perusal; but honest Jack told me frankly, he could not read, and desired to know the contents, which I immediately communicated: When he heard that part of it, in which, he says, he had wrote to his landlord in Deal; he cried, "Body of me! that was old Ben. Block, -- he was dead before the letter came to hand. -- Ey, ey, had Been been alive, lieutenant Bowling would have had no occasion to sculk so long. -- Honest Ben was the first man that taught him to hand, reef and steer. -- Well, well, we must all die, that is certain, -- we must all come to port sooner or later, -- at sea or on shore; we must be fast moored one day, -- death's like the best bower anchor, as the saying is, it will bring us all up." -- I could not but signify my approbation of the justness of Jack's reflections; and enquired into the occasion of the quarrel between captain Oakhum and my uncle, which he explained in this manner. -- "Captain Oakhum, to be sure, is a good man enough, -- besides, he is my commander; -- but what is that to me! -- I do my duty, and value no man's anger of a rope's end. -- Now the report goes, as how he is a lord's, or baron knight's brother, whereby (do you see me) he carries a strait arm, and keeps a loof from his officers, thof, may hap, they may be as good men in the main as he. Now we lying at anchor in Tuberoon bay, lieutenant Bowling had the middle watch, and as he always kept a good-look out, he made (do you see) three lights in the offing, whereby he run down to the great cabin for orders, and found the captain asleep; -- whereupon he waked him, which put him in a main high passion, and he swore woundily at the lieutenant, and called him lousy Scotch son of a whore, (for I being then sentinel in the steerage, heard all) and swab and swabbard, whereby the lieutenant returned the salute, and they jawed together fore and aft a good spell, till at last the captain turned out, and laying hold of a rattan, came athwart Mr. Bowling's quarter; whereby he told the captain, that if he was not his commander, he would heave him overboard, and demanded satisfaction ashore, whereby in the morning watch, the captain went ashore in the pinnace, and afterward the lieutenant carried the cutter ashore; and so they, leaving the boats crews on their oars, went away together; and so (do you see) in less than a quarter of an hour we heard firing, whereby we made for the place, and found the captain lying wounded on the beach, and so brought him on board to the doctor, who cured him in less than six weeks. But the lieutenant clapped on all the sail he could bear, and had got far enough ahead before we knew any thing of the matter; so that we could never after get sight of him, for which we were not sorry, because the captain was mainly wroth, and would certainly have done him a mischief; -- for he afterward caused him to be run on the ships books, whereby he lost all his pay, and if he should be taken, would be tried as a deserter."  This account of the captain's behavior gave me no advantageous idea of his character; and I could not help lamenting my own fate, that had subjected me to such a commander. However, making a virtue of necessity, I put a good face on the matter, and next day was with the other pressed men put on board of the Thunder lying at the Nore. -- When we came along-side, the mate who guarded us thither, ordered my hand-cuffs to be taken off, that I might get on board the easier; which being perceived by some of the company who stood upon the gangboards to see us enter, one of them called to Jack Rattlin, who was busied in doing this friendly office for me; "Hey, Jack, what Newgate galley have you boarded in the river as you came along? Have we not thieves enough among us already?" Another observing my wounds, which still remained exposed to the air, told me, my seams were uncaulked, and that I must be new paid. -- A third, seeing my hair clotted together with blood, as it were, into distinct cords, took notice, that my bows were manned with the red ropes, instead of my side. -- A fourth asked me, if I could not keep my yards square without iron braces? and in short, a thousand witticisms of the same nature, were passed upon me, before I could get up the ship's side. -- After we had been all entered upon the books, I enquired at one of my ship-mates where the surgeon was, that I might have my wounds dressed, and had actually got as far as the middle deck (for our ship carried eighty guns) in my way to the cockpit, when I was met by the same midshipman who had used me so barbarously in the tender: He seeing me free from my chains, asked, with an insolent air, who had released me? To this I foolishly answered, with a countenance that too plainly declared the state of my thoughts; "Whoever did it, I am persuaded did not consult you in the affair." -- I had no sooner uttered these words, than he cried, "D -- n you, you saucy son of a b -- ch, I Will teach you to talk so to your officer." -- So saying, he bestowed on me several severe stripes, with a supple Jack he had in his hand; and going to the commanding officer, made such a report of me, that I was immediately put in irons by the master at arms, and a sentinel placed over me. -- Honest Rattlin, as soon as he heard of my condition, came to me, and administered all the consolation he could, and then went to the surgeon in my behalf, who sent one of his mates to dress my wounds. This mate was no other than my old friend Thomson, with whom I became acquainted at the Navy-office, as before mentioned. If I knew him at first sight, it was not so easy for him to recognize me, disfigured with blood and dirt, and altered by the misery I had undergone. -- Unknown as I was to him, he surveyed me with looks of compassion, and handled my sores with great tenderness. When he had applied what he thought proper, and was about to leave me, I asked him if my misfortunes had disquised me so much, that he could not recollect my face? Upon this he observed me with great earnestness for some time, and at length, protested he could not recollect one feature of my countenance. -- To keep him no longer in suspense, I told him my name; which when he heard, he embraced me with affection, and professed his sorrow in seeing me in such a disagreeable situation. I made him acquainted with my story, and when he heard how inhumanly I had been used in the tender, he left me abruptly, assuring me, I should see him again soon. I had scarce time to wonder at his sudden departure, when the master at arms came to the place of my confinement, and bid me follow him to the quarter deck, where I was examined by the first lieutenant, who commanded the ship in the absence of the captain, touching the treatment I had received in the tender from my friend the midshipman, who was present to confront me. -- I recounted the particulars of his behavior to me, not only in the tender, but since my being on board the ship, part of which being proved by the evidence of Jack Rattlin and others, who had no great devotion for my oppressor, I was discharged from confinement to make way for him, who was delivered to the master at arms to take his turn in the Bilboes. -- And this was not the only satisfaction I enjoyed, for I was, at the request of the surgeon, exempted from all other duty, than that of assisting his mates in making and administering medicines to the sick. -- This good office I owed to the friendship of Mr. Thomson, who had represented me in such a favorable light to the surgeon, that he demanded me of the lieutenant, to supply the place of his third mate, who was lately dead. -- When I had obtained this favor, my friend Thomson carried me down to the cockpit, which is the place allotted for the habitation of the surgeon's mates: And when he had shown me their birth (as he called it) I was filled with astonishment and horror. -- We descended by diverse ladders to a space as dark as a dungeon, which I understood was immersed several feet under water, being immediately above the hold: I had no sooner approached this dismal gulf, than my nose was saluted with an intolerable stench of putrified cheese, and rancid butter, that issued from an apartment at the foot of the ladder, resembling a chandler's shop, where, by the faint glimmering of a candle, I could perceive a man with a pale meagre countenance, sitting behind a kind of desk, having spectacles on his nose, and a pen in his hand. -- This (I learned of Mr. Thomson) was the ship's steward, who sat there to distribute provision to the several messes, and to mark what each received. -- He therefore presented my name to him, and desired I might be entered in his mess; then taking a light in his hand, conducted me to the place of his residence, which was a square of about six feet, surrounded with the medicine chest, that of the first mate, his own, and a board by way of table fastened to the mizen-mast it was also enclosed with canvas nailed round to the beams of the ship, to screen us from the cold, as well as the view of the midshipmen and quarter masters, who lodged within the cable tiers on each side of us: In this gloomy mansion, he entertained me with some cold salt pork, which he brought from a sort of locker, fixed above the table; and calling for the boy of the mess, sent him for a can of beer, of which he made excellent flip to crown the banquet. -- By this time I began to recover my spirits, which had been exceedingly depressed with the appearance of every thing about me, and could no longer refrain from asking the particulars of Mr. Thomson's fortune, since I had seen him in London. -- He told me, that being disappointed in his expectations of borrowing money to gratify the rapacious s -- t -- ry at the Navy-office, he found himself utterly unable to subsist any longer in town, and had actually offered his service, in quality of mate, to the surgeon of a merchant's ship bound to Guinea on the slaving trade; when one morning, a young fellow, of whom he had some acquaintance, came to his lodgings, and informed him, that he had seen a wa rant made out in his name at the Navy-office, for surgeon's second mate of a third rate: This unexpected piece of good news he could scarcely believe to be true; more especially, as he had been found qualified at Surgeon's-hall for third mate only; but that he might not be wanting to himself, he went thither to be assured, and actually found it so: Whereupon, demanding his warrant, it was delivered to him, and the oaths administered immediately. -- That very afternoon, he went to Gravesend in the tilt-boat, from whence he took a place in the tide-coach for Rochester; next morning got on board the Thunder, for which he was appointed, then lying in the harbor at Chatham; and the same day was mustered by the clerk of the checque. -- And well it was for him, that such expedition was used; for in less then twelve hours after his arrival, another William Thomson came on board, affirming that he was the person for whom the warrant was expedited, and that the other was an impostor. -- My friend was grievously alarmed at this accident; the more so, as his namesake had very much the advantage over him, both in assurance and dress. -- However, to acquit himself of the suspicion of imposture, he produced several letters written from Scotland to him in that name, and recollecting that his indentures were in his box on board, he brought them up, and convinced all present, that he had not assumed a name which did not belong to him. -- His competitor enraged, that they should hesitate in doing him justice (for to be sure, the warrant had been designed for him) behaved with so much indecent heat, that the commanding officer, (who was the same gentleman I had seen) and the surgeon, were offended at his presumption, and making a point of it with their friends in town, in less than a week got the first confirmed in his station. -- "I have been on board (said he) ever since, and as this way of life is become familiar to me, have no cause to complain of my situation. -- The surgeon is a good-natured indolent man; the first mate (who is now on shore on duty) is indeed a little proud and choleric, as all Welchmen are, but in the main, a friendly honest fellow. -- The lieutenants I have no concern with; and as for the captain, he is too much of a gentleman to know a surgeon's mate, even by sight."  CHAP. XXV. The behavior of Mr. Morgan -- his pride, displeasure and generosity -- the economy of our mess described -- Thomson's further friendship -- the nature of my duty explained -- the situation of the sick.  WHILE he was thus discoursing to me, we heard a voice on the cockpit ladder, pronounce with great vehemence, in a strange dialect, "The devil and his dam blow me from the top of Mounchdenny, if I go to him before there is something in my belly; -- let his nose be as yellow as a saffron, or as plue as a pell (look you) or as green as a leek, it is all one." -- To this somebody answered, "So it seems my poor mess-mate must part his cable for want of a little assistance. -- His fore-top-sail is loose already; and besides, the doctor ordered you to overhaul him; -- but I see, you don't mind what your master says." -- Here he was interrupted with, "Splutter and vons! you lousy tog, who do you call my master? get you gone to the doctor, and tell him my birth, and my education, and my abilities; and moreover, my behavior is as good as his, or any gentleman's (no disparagement to him) in the whole world -- Got pless my soul! does he think, or conceive, or imagine, that I am a horse, or an ass, or a goat, to trudge backwards and forwards, and upwards and downwards, and by sea and by land, at his will and pleasures? -- Go your ways, you rapscallion, and tell doctor Atkins, that I desire and request, that he will give a look upon the tying man, and order something for him, if he be dead or alive, and I will see him take it by and by, when my craving stomach is satisfied, look you." -- At this the other went away, saying, that if they would serve him so, when he was a dying, by G -- d, he would be foul of them in the other world. -- Here Mr. Thomson let me know that the person we heard, was Mr. Morgan the first mate, who was just come on board from the hospital, where he had been with sick people. -- At the same time, I saw him come into the birth. -- He was a short thick man, with a face garnished with pimples, a snub nose turned up at the end, an excessive wide mouth, and little fiery eyes, surrounded with skin puckered up in innumerable wrinkles. -- My friend immediately made him acquainted with my case; when he regarded me with a very lofty look, but without speaking, set down a bundle he had in his hand, and approached the cupboard, which when he had opened, he exclaimed in a great passion, "Cot is my life! all the pork is gone, as I am a christian!" Thomson then gave him to understand, that as I had been brought on board half famished, he could do no less than entertain me with what was in the locker; and the rather, as he had bid the steward enter me in the mess. -- Whether this disappointment made Mr. Morgan more peevish than usual, or he really thought himself too little regarded by his fellowmate, I know not, but after some pause, he went on in this manner -- "Mr. Thomson, perhaps you do not use me with all the good manners, and complaisance, and respect (look you) that becomes you, because you have not vouchsafed to advise with me in this affair. -- I have, in my time (look you) been a man of some weight, and substance, and consideration, and have kept house and home, and paid scot and lot, and the king's taxes; ay, and maintained a family to boot. -- And moreover, also, I am your senior, and your elder, and your petter, Mr. Thomson." -- "My elder I Will allow you to be, but not my better (cried Thomson, with some heat.)" -- "Cot is my savior, and witness too (said Morgan, with great vehemence) that I am more elder, and therefore more petter by many years than you." -- Fearing this dispute might be attended with some bad consequence, I interposed, and told Mr. Morgan, I was very sorry for having been the occasion of any difference between him and the second mate; and that rather than cause the least breach in their good understanding, I would eat my allowance by myself, or seek admission into some other company. -- But Thomson, with more spirit than discretion (as I thought) insisted upon my remaining where he had appointed me; and observed that no man possessed of generosity and compassion, would have any objection to it, considering my birth and talents, and the misfortunes I had of late so unjustly undergone. -- This was touching Mr. Morgan on the right key, who protested with great earnestness, that he had no objection to my being received in the mess; but only complained, that the ceremony of asking his consent was not observed. "As for a shentleman in distress (said he, shaking me by the hand) I lofe him as I lofe my own powels: For Got help me! I have had vexations enough upon my own pack." -- And as I afterward learned, in so saying he spoke no more than what was true; for he had been once settled in a very good situation in Glamorganshire, and was ruined by being security for an acquaintance. -- All differences being composed, he united his bundle, which consisted of three bunches of onions, and a great lump of Cheshire-cheese wrapped up in a handkerchief; and taking some biscuit from the cupboard, fell to with a keen appetite, inviting us to a share of the repast. -- When he had fed heartily on this homely fare, he filled a large cup made of a cocoa-nut-shell, with brandy, and drinking it off, told us, "Prandy was the best menstruum for onion and sheese." -- His hunger being appeased, he began to show a great deal of good humor; and being inquisitive about my birth, no sooner understood that I was descended of a good family, then he discovered a particular good will to me on that account, deducing his own pedigree in a direct line from the famous Caractacus king of the Britons, who was first the prisoner and afterward the friend of Claudius Caesar. -- Perceiving how much I was reduced in point of linen, he made me a present of two good ruffled shirts, which with two of check Mr. Thomson gave me, enabled me to appear with decency. -- Mean while the sailor, whom Mr. Morgan had sent to the doctor, brought a prescription for his mess-mate, which when Mr. Welchman had read, he got up to prepare it, and asked if the man was "Tead or alive." -- "Dead! (replied Jack) if he was dead he would have no occasion for doctor's stuff. -- No, thank God, death has'n't as yet boarded him, but they have been yard arm and yard arm these three glasses." -- "Are his eyes open? (continued the mate.)" -- "His starboard eye (said the sailor) is open, but fast jamm'd in his head; and the haulyards of his underjaw are given way." -- "Passion of my heart! (cried Morgan) the man is as pad as one would desire in a summer's day! -- Did you feel his pulses? To this, the other replied with "Anan?" -- Upon which this Cambro Briton, with great earnestness and humanity, ordered the tar to run to his mess-mate and keep him alive till he should come with the medicine, "and then (said he) you shall peradventure, pehold what you shall see." -- The poor fellow with great simplicity ran to the place where the sick man lay, but in less than a minute, returned with a woeful countenance, and told us his comrade had struck. Morgan hearing this, exclaimed, "Mercy upon my salfation! why did you not stop him till I came?" -- "Stop him (said the other) I hailed him several times, but he was too far on his way, and the enemy had got possession of his close quarters; so that he did not mind me." -- "Well, well, (said he) we all owe heaven a Teath. -- Go your ways, you ragamuffin, and take an example and a warning, look you, and repent of your misteets." -- So saying, he pushed the seamen out of the birth.  While he entertained us with reflections suitable to this event, we heard the boatswain pipe to dinner; and immediately the boy belonging to our mess, run to the locker, from whence he carried off a large wooden platter, and in a few minutes, returned with it full of boiled peace, crying, "Scaldings," all the way as he came. -- The cloth, consisting of a piece of an old sail, was instantly laid, covered with three plates, which by the color, I could with difficulty discern to be metal, and as many spoons of the same composition, two of which were curtailed in the handles, and the other in the lip. Mr. Morgan himself enriched this mess with a lump of salt butter, scooped from an old gallipot, and a handful of onions shorn, with some pounded pepper. -- I was not very much tempted with the appearance of this dish, of which, nevertheless, my mess-mates eat heartily, advising me to follow their example, as it was banyan day, and we could have no meat till next noon. -- But I had already laid in sufficient for the occasion; and therefore desired to be excused; expressing a curiosity to know the meaning of banyan day. -- They tole me, that on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the ship's company had no allowance of meat, and that these meagre days were called banyan days, the reason of which they did not know; but I have since learned they take their denomination from a sect of devotees in some parts of the East Indies, who never taste flesh.  After dinner, Thomson led me round the ship' showed me the different parts, described their uses, and as far as he could, made me acquainted with the particulars of the discipline and economy practiced on board. -- He then demanded of the boatswain, an hammock for me, which was slung in a very neat manner by my friend Jack Rattlin; and as I had no bed-Cloaths, procured credit for me with the purser, for a mattress and two blankets. -- At seven a-clock in the evening, Morgan visited the sick, and having ordered what was proper for each, I assisted Thomson in making up his prescriptions: But when I followed him with the medicines into the sick birth or hospital, and observed the situation of the patients, I was much less surprised to find people die on board, than astonished to find any body recover. -- Here I saw about fifty miserable distempered wretches, suspended in rows, so huddled one upon another, that not more than fourteen inches of space was allotted for each with his bed and bedding; and deprived of the light of the day, as well as of fresh air; breathing nothing but a noisome atmosphere of the morbid steams exhaling from their own excrements and diseased bodies, devoured with vermin hatched in the filth that surrounded them, and destitute of every convenience necessary for people in that helpless condition.  CHAP. XXVI. A disagreeable accident happens to me in the discharge of my office -- Morgan's nose is offended -- a dialogue between him and the ship's steward -- upon examination, I find more causes of complaint than one -- my hair is cut off -- Morgan's Cookery -- the manner of sleeping on board -- I am waked in the night by a dreadful noise.
