companion would have fought any body, when companion life was in no danger; but companion had a mortal aversion to fire arms and all instruments of death. In order to appease companion, I assured companion, no part of this extraordinary expense should fall upon companion shoulders; at which companion was affronted, and told me, companion would have me to know, that although companion was a poor barber's boy, companion had a soul to spend companion money with the best 'squire of the land. -- Having walked all day at a great pace, without halting for a refreshment, we descried toward the evening, to we inexpressible joy, the wagon about a quarter of a mile before we; and by that time we came up with it, were both of we so weary, that I verily believe it would have been impracticable for we to have walked one mile further. -- we therefore bargained with the driver, whose name was Joey, to give we a cast to the next stage for a shilling; at which place we would meet the master of the wagon, with whom we might agree for the rest of the journey.  Accordingly the convenience stopped, and Joey having placed the ladder, Strap (being loaded with we baggage) mounted first; but just as Joey was getting in, a tremendous voice assailed Joey ears in these words: "God's fury! there shall no passengers come here." -- The poor shaver was so disconcerted at this exclamation, which both Joey and I imagined proceeded from the mouth of a giant, that Joey descended with great velocity, and a countenance as white as paper. -- Joey perceiving our astonishment, called with an arch sneer, "Waunds, captain! whay woan't yau sooffer the poor waggoneer to meake a penny? -- Coom, coom, young man, get oop, get oop, -- never moind the coptain, -- I'se not afear'd of the coptain." -- This was not encouragement sufficient to Strap, who could not be prevailed upon to venture up again; upon which I attempted, though not without a quaking heart, when I heard a tremendous voice muttering like distant thunder: "By G -- d I will not be used so, d -- n -- n seize me if I am!" -- However I crept in, and by accident got an empty place in the straw, which I immediately took possession of, without being able to discern the faces of my fellow-travellers in the dark. Strap following with the knapsack on his back, chanced to take the other side, and by a jolt of the carriage, pitched directly upon the stomach of the captain, who bellowed out in a most dreadful manner: "Blood and thunder! where is my sword?" -- At these words, my frighted comrade started up, and at one spring, bounced against my frighted comrade with such force, that I thought the supposed son of Anak intended to smother me. -- In the mean time a female voice cried out, "Bless me! what is the matter, my dear?" "the matter, replied the captain, damn my blood! my guts are almost squeezed out by that Scotchman's hump." Strap trembling all the while at his back, asked Strap pardon, and laid the blame of what had happened upon the jolting of the wagon. -- The woman who spoke before, went on: "Ay, ay, my dear, it is our own fault -- our may thank our for all the inconveniences our meet with. -- I thank God, I never traveled so before, -- I Am sure if my lady or Sir John was to know where our are, my lady or Sir John would not sleep this night for vexation. -- I wish to God our had writ for the chariot, -- I know our shall never be forgiven." "Come, come, my dear (replied the captain) it don't signify fretting now, -- our shall laugh it over as a frolic. -- I hope you will not suffer in your health. -- I shall make God very merry with our adventures in the Diligence." -- This discourse gave me such a high notion of the captain and his lady, that I durst not venture to join in the conversation; but immediately after, another female voice begins: "Some people give "Some people a great many needless airs -- better folks than any here have traveled in wagons before now. -- Some of us have rode in coaches and chariots with three footmen behind Some of us, without making so much fuss about it. -- What then? us are now all upon a footing, therefore let us be sociable and merry. -- What do you say, Isaac? Is'n't this a good motion, you doting rogue? -- Speak, you old cent. per cent. fornicator. -- What desperate debt are you thinking of? What mortgage are you planning? Well, Isaac, positively you shall never gain my favor till you turn over a new leaf; grow honest, and live like a gentleman. -- In the mean time, give me a kiss, you old fumbler." -- These words, accompanied with a hearty smack, enlivened the person to whom they were addressed, to such a degree, that he cried in transport, though with a quavering voice, "Ah! you wanton baggage -- upon my credit, you are a waggish girl, he, he, he." -- This laugh introduced a fit of coughing, which almost suffocated the poor usurer (such, we afterward found, was the profession of this we fellow-traveller.) -- About this time, I fell asleep, and enjoyed a comfortable nap till such time as we arrived at the inn where we put up. -- Here, having got out of the wagon first, I had an opportunity of viewing the passengers in order as the passengers entered. -- The first who appeared was a brisk airy girl, about twenty years old, with a silver-laced hat on her head, instead of a cap, a blue stuff riding suit trimmed with silver, very much tarnished, and a whip in her hand. -- After her, came limping, an old man with a worsted nightcap, buttoned under an old man with a worsted nightcap chin, and a broad brimmed hat slouched over it, an old rusty blue cloak tied about an old man with a worsted nightcap neck, under which appeared a brown surtout, that covered a threadbare coat and waste-coat, and, as we afterward discerned, a dirty flannel jacket. -- an old man with a worsted nightcap eyes were hollow, bleared and gummy; an old man with a worsted nightcap face was shrivelled into a thousand wrinkles, an old man with a worsted nightcap gums were destitute of teeth, an old man with a worsted nightcap nose sharp and drooping, his chin peeked and prominent, so that when an old man with a worsted nightcap mumped or spoke, they approached one another like a pair of nut-crackers; an old man with a worsted nightcap supported an old man with a worsted nightcap on an ivory-headed cane, and an old man with a worsted nightcap whole figure was a just emblem of winter, famine and avarice. -- But how was I surprised, when I beheld the formidable captain leading in an old man with a worsted nightcap wife; in the shape of a little, thin creature, about the age of forty, with a long, withered visage, very much resembling that of a baboon, through the upper part of which, two little gray eyes peeped: an old man with a worsted nightcap wore an old man with a worsted nightcap own hair in a queue that reached to an old man with a worsted nightcap rump, which immoderate length, I suppose, was the occasion of a baldness that appeared on the crown of an old man with a worsted nightcap head, when an old man with a worsted nightcap deigned to take off an old man with a worsted nightcap hat, which was very much of the size and cock of Pistol's. -- Having laid aside an old man with a worsted nightcap great coat, I could not help admiring the extraordinary make of this man of war: an old man with a worsted nightcap was about five foot and three inches high, sixteen inches of which went to an old man with a worsted nightcap face and long scraggy neck; an old man with a worsted nightcap thighs were about six inches in length, an old man with a worsted nightcap legs resembling spindles or drum-sticks, two feet and an half, and an old man with a worsted nightcap body, which put me in mind of extension without substance, engrossed the remainder; -- so that on the whole, an old man with a worsted nightcap appeared like a spider or grasshopper erect, -- and was almost a vox and preterca nihil. -- an old man with a worsted nightcap dress consisted in a frock of what is called bear-skin, the skirts of which were about half a foot long, an Hussar waistcoat, scarlet breeches reaching half way down an old man with a worsted nightcap thigh, worsted stockings rolled up almost to an old man with a worsted nightcap groin, and shoes with wooden heels at least two inches high; an old man with a worsted nightcap carried a sword very near as long as an old man with a worsted nightcap in one hand, and in the other conducted an old man with a worsted nightcap lady, who seemed to be a woman of an old man with a worsted nightcap own age, and still retained some remains of an agreeable person; but so ridiculously affected, that had I then known as much of the world as I do now, I might have easily perceived in an agreeable person, the deplorable vanity and second-hand airs of a lady's woman. -- We were all assembled in the kitchen, when captain Weazel (for that was an old man with a worsted nightcap name) desired a room with a fire for an old man with a worsted nightcap and spouse; and told the landlord, himself and spouse would sup by himself and spouse. -- The innkeeper replied, that The innkeeper could not afford them a room by them; and as for supping, The innkeeper had prepared victuals for the passengers in the wagon without respect of persons, but if The innkeeper could prevail on the rest to let The innkeeper have The innkeeper choice in a separate manner, with all The innkeeper heart: This was no sooner said, than all of us declared against the proposal, and miss Jenny (our other female passenger) observed, that if captain Weazel and The innkeeper had a mind to sup by captain Weazel and his lady, captain Weazel and his lady might wait until us should have done. -- At this, the captain put on a martial frown and looked very big, without speaking; while the captain yoke fellow, with a disdainful toss of her nose, muttered something about "Creature;" -- which miss Jenny over-hearing, stepped up to Jenny, saying, "None of your names, good Mrs. Abigail; -- creature quotha, -- I Will assure you, -- No such creature as you neither -- no ten pound sneaker -- no quality coupler." -- Here the captain interposed with a "Damme, madam, what do you mean by that?" -- "Damn you, sir, who are you? (replied miss Jenny) who made you a captain, you pitiful, trencher-scraping, pimping curler? -- 'Sdeath! the army is come to a fine pass, when such fellows as you get commissions. -- What, I suppose you think I don't know you? -- By G -- d, you and your helpmate are well met, -- a cast-off mistress, and a bald valet de chamber are well yoked together. Blood and wounds! (cried Weazel) do you question the honor of my wife, madam? -- Hell and damnation! No man in England durst say so much, -- I would flea No man in England durst, carbonado No man in England durst! Fury and destruction! I would have No man in England durst liver for my supper." -- So saying, No man in England durst drew No man in England durst sword, and flourished with his sword, to the great terror of Strap: while miss Jenny snapping Jenny fingers, told No man in England durst, Jenny did not value No man in England durst resentment a f -- t. -- In the midst of this quarrel, the master of the wagon alighted, who understanding the cause of it, and fearing the captain and his lady would take so much umbrage, as to leave the captain carriage, was at great pains to have every thing made up, which the captain at last accomplished, and we sat down to supper all together. At bedtime we were shown to we apartments. The old usurer, Strap and I, were conducted to one room; the captain, the captain wife, and miss Jenny to another. -- About midnight, my companion's bowels being disordered, my companion got up, in order to go backward; in my companion return, mistaking one door for another, my companion entered Weazel's chamber, and without any hesitation went to bed to my companion wife, who was fast asleep; the captain being at another end of the room, groping for some empty vessel, my companion own chamber pot being leaky: As my companion did not perceive Strap coming in, my companion went toward my companion own bed, after having sound a convenience; but no sooner did my companion feel a rough head with a cotton nightcap on it, than it came into my companion mind, that my companion was got to miss Jenny's bed instead of my companion own, and that the head my companion felt, was that of some gallant, with whom Jenny had made an assignation. -- Full of this conjecture, and scandalized at the prostitution of my companion apartment, my companion snatched up the vessel my companion had just before filled, and emptied the vessel he had just before filled at once on the astonished barber and my companion own wife, who waking at that instant, broke forth into lamentable cries, which not only alarmed my companion beyond measure, but frightened poor Strap almost out of my companion senses; for my companion verily believed my companion bewitched; especially when the captain seized my companion by the throat, with a volley of oaths, asking my companion how my companion durst have the presumption to attempt the chastity of my companion wife. -- Poor Strap was so amazed and confounded, that my companion could say nothing, but, -- "I take God to witness Poor Strap is a virgin for my companion." -- Mrs. Weazel enraged to find Mrs. Weazel in such a pickle, through the precipitation of Mrs. Weazel , got up in Mrs. Weazel shift, and with the heel of Mrs. Weazel shoe, which Mrs. Weazel found at the bedside, belabored the captain's bald pate, till my companion cried "Murder." -- "I Will teach you to empty your stink-pots on my companion, (cried Mrs. Weazel) you pitiful, hop of my thumb coxcomb. -- What? I warrant you're jealous, you man of lath. -- Was it for this I condescended to take you to my bed, you poor, withered, sapless twig?" -- The noise occasioned by this adventure, had brought the master of the wagon and me to the door, where we overheard all that passed, with great satisfaction. In the mean time we were alarmed with the cry of "Rape! Murder! Rape!" which miss Jenny pronounced with great vociferation. -- "O! you vile, abominable old villain, (said she) would you rob me of my virtue? -- But I Will be revenged of you, you old goat! I will! -- help! for heaven's sake! help! -- I shall be ravished! ruined! help!" -- Some servants of the inn hearing the cry of "Rape, came running up stairs with lights, and such weapons as chance afforded; when we beheld a very diverting scene. -- In one corner stood the captain shivering in the captain shirt, which was all torn to rags; with a woeful visage, scratched all over by the captain wise, who had by this time wrapped the covering about she, and sat crying on the side of she bed -- In the other end, lay the old usurer sprawling on miss Jenny's bed, with nothing on the captain but the captain flannel jacket over his shirt, and the captain tawny meagre limbs exposed to the air; while she held the captain fast by the two ears, and loaded the captain with execrations. -- When we asked what was the matter, she affected to weep, and told we, she was afraid that wicked rogue had ruined she in she sleep, and bid we take notice of what we saw, for she intended to make use of we evidence against the captain. -- The poor wretch looked like one more dead than alive, and begged for Christ's sake to be released; which was no sooner done, than the captain protested she was no woman, but a devil incarnate -- that she had first seduced the captain flesh to rebel, and then betrayed the captain. -- "Yes, cockatrice (continued the captain, with a faultering voice) thou know thou did spread this snare for the captain -- but thou shall not succeed -- for I will hang the captain before thou shall get a farthing of the captain." -- So saying, the captain crawled to the captain own bed, groaning all the way. -- We then advanced to the captain, who told We, "Gentlemen, here has been a damned mistake; but I Will be revenged on the captain who was the occasion of it. -- That Scotchman who carries the knapsack shall not breathe this vital air another day, if my name be Weazel. -- My dear, I ask you ten thousand pardons; you are sensible I could mean no harm to My dear." -- "I know not what you meant (replied My dear, sobbing) but I know I have got enough to send me to my grave." -- At length they were reconciled. -- his wife was complimented with a share of miss Jenny's bed (his wife own being overflowed) and the master of the wagon invited Weazel to sleep the remaining part of the night with Weazel. I retired to mine, where I found Strap mortally afraid, Weazel having got away in the dark, while the captain and Weazel were at logger-heads.  CHAP. XII. Weazel challenges Strap, who declines the combat -- an affair between the captain and me -- the usurer is fain to give miss Jenny five guineas for a release -- we are in danger of losing a meal -- the behavior of Weazel, Jenny, and Joey on that occasion -- an account of captain Weazel and Weazel lady -- the captain's courage tried -- Isaac's mirth at the captain's expense.  NEXT morning, I agreed to give the master of the wagon ten shillings for my passage to London, provided Strap should be allowed to take my place when I should be disposed to walk. -- At the same time I desired Weazel to appease the incensed captain, who by this time had got into the kitchen, with a drawn sword in Weazel hand, and threatened with many oaths, to sacrifice the villain, who attempted to violate Weazel bed; but it was to no purpose for the master to explain the mistake, and assure the master of the poor lad's innocence, who stood trembling behind me all the while: the more submission that appeared in Strap, the more implacable seemed the resentment of Weazel, who swore the master must either fight the master, or the master would instantly put the master to death. -- I was extremely provoked at this insolence, and told the master, it could not be supposed that a poor barber lad would engage a man of the sword at the master own weapon; but I was persuaded the master would wrestle or box with the master. -- To which proposal Strap immediately gave assent, by saying, the master would box with the master for a guinea. -- Weazel replied with a look of disdain, Weazel was beneath any gentleman of Weazel character to fight like a porter, or even to put Weazel on a footing, in any respect, with such a fellow as Strap. -- "Ods bodikins! (cries Joey) sure coptain, yaw wauld not coommit moorder! Here Is a poor lad that is willing to make attoonement for his offense; and an that woant't satisfy yaw, offers to fight yaw fairly. -- An yaw woan't box, I dare say, he will coodgel with yaw. -- Woan't yaw, my lad?" -- Strap, after some hesitation, answered, "Ye -- yes, I Will cudgel with Strap." -- But this expedient being also rejected by the captain, I began to smell his character, and tipping Strap the wink, told Strap, that I had always heard this expedient said, the person who receives a challenge should have the choice of the weapons; this therefore being the rule in point of honor, I would venture to promise on the head of my companion, that the captain would even fight Weazel at sharps; but it should be with such sharps as Strap was best acquainted with, namely razors -- At my mentioning razors, I could perceive the captain's color to change, while Strap pulling me by the sleeve, whispered with great eagerness; -- "No, no, no; for the love of God, don't make any such bargain." -- At length, Weazel recovered Weazel, turned toward me, and with a ferocious countenance, asked, "Who the devil are you? -- will you fight me?" With these words, putting Weazel in a posture, I was grievously alarmed at seeing the point of a sword within half a foot of my breast; and springing to one side, snatched up a spit that stood in the chimney corner, with which I kept my formidable adversary at bay, who made a great many half longes, skipping backward every time, till at last I got Weazel pinned up in a corner, to the no small diversion of Strap. While Weazel was in this situation, Weazel entered, and seeing his wife husband in these dangerous circumstances, uttered a dreadful scream, and swooned: Upon this, Weazel demanded a cessation, which was immediately granted; and after Weazel had recovered, was contented with the submission of Strap, who falling on Weazel knees before Weazel, protested the innocence of Weazel intention, and asked pardon for the mistake Weazel had committed. This affair being ended without bloodshed, we went to breakfast, but missed two of we , to wit, miss Jenny and the usurer. As for the first, Mrs. Weazel informed we, that Mrs. Weazel had kept Mrs. Weazel awake all night with Mrs. Weazel groans; and that when Mrs. Weazel got up this morning, Jenny Jenny was so much indisposed, that Jenny could not proceed on Jenny journey. -- At this moment, a message came from Mrs. Weazel to the master of the wagon, who immediately went into Mrs. Weazel chamber, followed by we. -- Mrs. Weazel told the master of the wagon, who immediately went into her chamber, followed by us all in a lamentable tone, that Mrs. Weazel was afraid of a miscarriage owing to the fright Mrs. Weazel received last night, from the brutality of Isaac; and as the event was uncertain, desired the usurer might be detained to answer for the consequence -- Accordingly this ancient Tarquin was found in the wagon, whither the master of the wagon, who immediately went into her chamber, followed by us all had retired to avoid the shame of last night's disgrace; and brought by force into Mrs. Weazel presence. -- the master of the wagon, who immediately went into her chamber, followed by us all no sooner appeared, than Mrs. Weazel began to weep and sigh most piteously, and told we, if Mrs. Weazel died, Mrs. Weazel would leave Mrs. Weazel blood upon the head of that ravisher. -- Poor Isaac, turning up Poor Isaac eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God would deliver Poor Isaac from the machinations of that Jezabel; and assured we with tears in Poor Isaac eyes, that Poor Isaac being found in bed with Mrs. Weazel, was the result of Mrs. Weazel own invitation. -- The waggoner understanding the case, advised Poor Isaac to make it up, by giving Mrs. Weazel a sum of money, to which Poor Isaac replied with great vehemence, "A sum of money! -- a halter for the cockatrice!" -- "O! it is very well, (said miss Jenny) I see it is in vain to attempt that flinty heart of his, by fair means. -- Joey, be so good as to go to the Justice, and tell Joey there is a sick person here, who wants to see Joey on an affair of consequence." -- At the name of justice, Poor Isaac trembling like an aspen-leaf, and bidding Joey stay, asked with a faultering voice, "what Poor Isaac would have?" Poor Isaac told Poor Isaac, that as Poor Isaac had not perpetrated Poor Isaac wicked purpose, Poor Isaac would be satisfied with a small matter. -- And though the damage Poor Isaac might sustain in Poor Isaac health, might be irreparable, Poor Isaac would give Poor Isaac a release for an hundred guineas. -- "An hundred guineas! (cried Poor Isaac in an ecstasy) an hundred furies! -- Where should a poor old wretch like me, have an hundred guineas? if I had so much money, do you think I would be found traveling in a wagon, at this season of the year?" -- "Come, come, (replied Jenny) None of your miserly artifice here. -- You think I don't know Isaac Rapine the money-broker in the Minories. -- Ah! you old rogue! many a pawn have you had from me and my acquaintance which was never redeemed." -- Poor Isaac finding it was in vain to disguise Poor Isaac, offered twenty shillings for a discharge, which she absolutely refused under fifty pounds: At last, however, she was brought down to five, which Poor Isaac paid with great reluctance, rather than be prosecuted for a rape. -- After which this sick person made shift to get into a wagon, and we set forwards in great tranquillity, Strap being accommodated with Joey's horse, the driver himself choosing to walk. -- This morning and forenoon we were entertained with an account of the valor of captain Weazel, who told we of the driver himself having once knocked down a soldier that made game of the driver himself; of tweaking a drawer by the nose, who found fault with the driver himself picking the driver himself teeth with a fork; and of the driver himself sending a challenge to a cheese-monger, who had the presumption to be the driver himself rival, -- for the truth of which the driver himself appealed to the driver himself . -- his wife confirmed whatever the driver himself said, and observed such a thing happened that day, "I received a loveletter from 'squire Gobble; -- and don't you remember, my dear, I was prodigiously sick that very night with eating ortolans, when my lord Diddle took notice of my complexion's being altered, and his lady was so alarmed, that his lady had well nigh fainted." -- "Yes, my dear, (replied the captain) you know, my lord Diddle said to me, with a sneer," -- "Billy, Mrs. Weazel is certainly breeding." -- "And I answered cavalierly, my lord Diddle, I wish I could return the compliment. -- Upon which the whole company broke out into an immoderate fit of laughter; and my lord, who loves a repartee dearly, came round and bussed me." -- We traveled in this manner five days, without interruption or meeting any thing worth notice: Miss Jenny (who soon recovered his lady spirits) entertaining We every day with diverting songs, of which his lady could sing a great number; and rallying his lady old gallant, who notwithstanding could never be reconciled to his lady. -- On the sixth day, while We were about to sit down to dinner, the innkeeper came and told We, that three gentlemen just arrived, had ordered the victuals to be carried to three gentlemen apartment, although the innkeeper had informed three gentlemen that three gentlemen were bespoke by the passengers in a wagon. To which three gentlemen had replied, "The passengers in a wagon might be damned -- three gentlemen betters must be served before three gentlemen, -- three gentlemen supposed it would be no hardship on such travelers to dine upon bread and cheese for one day." -- This was a terrible disappointment to us all; and We laid We heads together how to remedy This; when miss Jenny propose that captain Weazel, being by profession a soldier, ought in this case to protect and prevent We from being insulted. -- But the captain excused the captain, saying, the captain would not for the world be known to have traveled in a wagon; swearing at the same time, the (...) the captain appear with honor, they should eat the captain sword sooner than the captain provision. -- Upon this declaration, miss Jenny snatching his sword drew this declaration, and run immediately to the kitchen, where Jenny threatened to put the cook to death, if the captain did not send the victuals into our chamber immediately. -- The noise Jenny made, brought the three strangers down, one of whom no sooner perceived Jenny, than the captain cried out, "Ha! Jenny Ramper! what the devil brought thee hither?" -- "My dear Jack Rattle! (replied Jenny, running into the captain arms) is it you? -- Then Weazel may go to hell for a dinner -- I shall dine with you." -- They consented to this, with a great deal of joy; and we were on the point of being reduced to a very uncomfortable meal, when Joey understanding the whole affair, entered the kitchen with a pitchfork in Joey hand, swore Joey would be the death of any man who should pretend to seize the victuals prepared for a wagon. -- This menace had like to have produced fatal consequences; the three strangers drawing their swords, and being joined by their servants, and we ranging we on the side of Joey; when the landlord interposing, offered to part with the landlord own dinner to keep the peace, which was accepted by the strangers; and we sat down at table without any further molestation. -- In the afternoon, I chose to walk along with Joey, and Strap took my place. -- Having entered into conversation with this driver, I soon found this driver to be a merry, facetious, good-natured fellow, and withal very arch: this driver informed me, that miss Jenny was a common girl upon the town, who falling into company with a recruiting officer, this driver carried that miss Jenny down in the stage-coach from London to Newcastle, where this driver had been arrested for debt, and was now in prison; upon which that miss Jenny was fain to return to that miss Jenny former way of life, in the manner we found that miss Jenny. -- this driver told me likewise, that one of the gentlemen's servants, whom we left at the inn, having accidentally seen Weazel, immediately knew this driver, and acquainted Joey with some particulars of this driver character, as follows: That this driver had served my lord Frizzle in quality of valet de chamber many years; while this driver lived separate from this driver : But upon their reconciliation, that miss Jenny expressly insisted upon Weazel's being turned off, as well as the woman this driver kept: whereupon this driver lordship, to get rid of them both with a good grace, proposed that this driver should marry this driver mistress, and this driver would procure a commission for this driver in the army; this expedient was agreed to, and Weazel is now, by this driver lordship's interest, ensign in -- 's regiment, I found this driver and I had the same sentiments with regard to Weazel's courage, which we resolved to put to the trial, by alarming the passengers with the cry of, "an highwayman!" as soon as we should discover an horseman appear. This we put in practice toward the dusk, when we descried a man on horseback approaching we. Joey had no sooner intimated to the people in a wagon, that Joey was afraid we should be all robbed, than a general consternation arose: Strap jumped out of a wagon and hid Joey behind a hedge. The usurer put forth ejaculations, and made a rustling among the straw, which made us conjecture Joey had hid something under it. Mrs. Weazel wringing Mrs. Weazel hands, uttered lamentable cries; and the captain, to our great amazement, began to snore; but this artifice did not succeed; for Jenny, shaking Joey by the shoulder, bawled out, "'Sdeath! captain, is this a time to snore, when our are going to be robbed? -- Get up for shame, and behave like a soldier and a man of honor." -- Mrs. Weazel pretended to be in a great passion for being disturbed, and swore Mrs. Weazel would have Mrs. Weazel nap out if all the highwaymen in England surrounded Mrs. Weazel. -- "D -- n my blood! what are you afraid of (continued Mrs. Weazel;") at the same time trembling with such agitation, that the whole carriage shook. -- This singular piece of behavior incensed Jenny Ramper so much, that Jenny Ramper cried out, "D -- n your pitiful soul, you are as arrant a poltroon as ever was drummed out of a regiment. -- Stop the wagon, Joey -- let me get out, and by G -- d, if I have rhetoric enough, the thief shall not only take your purse, but your skin also." -- So saying, Jenny Ramper leapt out with great agility. -- By this time the horseman came up with us, and happened to be a gentleman's servant well known to Joey, who communicated us scheme, and desired the horseman to carry our scheme on a little further, by going up to a wagon, and questioning those within a wagon. -- The stranger consenting for the sake of diversion, approached The stranger consenting for the sake of diversion, and in a terrible tone, demanded, "Who have you got here?" -- Poor Isaac replied with a lamentable voice, "Here is a poor miserable sinner, who has got a small family to maintain, and nothing in the world wherewithal, but these fifteen shillings, which if you rob me of, we must all starve together." -- "Who Is that sobbing in the other corner?" (said the supposed highwayman.) "A poor unfortunate woman, (answered Mrs. Weazel) upon whom I beg you for Christ's sake, to have compassion." -- "Are you maid or wife?" (said he) -- "Wife to my sorrow," (cried she.) -- "Who, or where is your husband?" (continued your husband.) -- "My husband, (replied Mrs. Weazel) is an officer in the army, and was left sick at the last inn where we dined." -- "You must be mistaken, madam, (said he) for I myself saw he get into a wagon this afternoon; -- But pray what smell is that? Sure your lapdog has befoul'd himself; -- let me catch hold of the nasty cur, I Will teach he better manners." -- Here he laid hold of one of Weazel's legs, and pulled he from under he wife's petticoats where he had concealed he. -- The poor trembling captain being detected in this inglorious situation, rubbed The poor trembling captain eyes, and affecting to wake out of sleep, cried, "What Is the matter? -- What Is the matter?" -- "the matter is not much, (answered the horseman) I only called in, to enquire after your health, and so adieu, most noble captain." -- Having said this, The poor trembling captain clapped spurs to The poor trembling captain horse, and was out of sight in a moment. -- It was some time before Mrs. Weazel could recollect The poor trembling captain, but at length, re-assuming the big look, The poor trembling captain said, "Damn the fellow! why did The poor trembling captain ride away, before I had time to ask how The poor trembling captain lord and lady do? -- Don't you remember Tom, my dear?"x addressing Tom to Tom . -- "Yes, (replied his wife) I think I do remember something of the fellow, -- but you know I seldom converse with people of the fellow station." -- "Hoy day! (cried Joey) do yaw know the young mon, coptain?" -- "Know Tom, (said Weazel) many a time has Tom filled a glass of Burgundy for Tom, at my lord Trippit's table." -- "And what may Tom neame be, coptain," (said Joey.) "Tom name! -- Tom name (replied Weazel) is Tom Rinser. -- "Waunds! (cried Joey) a has changed his true neame then! for I'se lay any wager his was christened John Trotter." -- This observation raised the laugh against the captain, who seemed very much disconcerted; when Poor Isaac broke silence, and said, "It was no matter who or what Poor Isaac was, since Poor Isaac had not proved the robber we suspected. -- And that we ought to bless God for we narrow escape." -- "Bless God, (said Weazel) bless the devil! for what? had Poor Isaac been a highwayman, I should have eat Poor Isaac blood, body and guts, before Poor Isaac had robbed me, or any one in this Diligence." -- "Ha, ha, ha! (cried miss Jenny) I believe you will eat all you kill indeed, captain." -- The usurer was so pleased at the event of this adventure, that Poor Isaac could not refrain from being severe, and took notice that captain Weazel seemed to be a good Christian, for Poor Isaac had armed Poor Isaac with patience and resignation, instead of carnal weapons; and worked out Poor Isaac salvation with fear and trembling. -- This piece of satire occasioned a great deal of mirth at Weazel's expense, who muttered a great many oaths, and threatened to cut Poor Isaac's throat; -- which the usurer taking hold of, said, "Gentlemen and ladies, I take you all to witness, that my life is in danger from this bloody-minded officer. -- I Will have Poor Isaac bound over to the peace." This second sneer, procured another laugh against Poor Isaac, and Poor Isaac remained crest-fallen during the remaining part of our journey.  CHAP. XIII. Strap and I are terrified by an apparition -- Strap's conjecture -- the mystery explained by Joey -- we arrive at London -- we dress and appearance described -- we are insulted in the street -- an adventure in the alehouse -- we are imposed upon by a waggish footman -- set to rights by a tobacconist -- take lodgings -- dive for a dinner -- an accident at we ordinary.  we arrived at we inn, supped and went to bed; but Strap's distemper continuing, he was obliged to get up in the middle of the night, and taking the candle in he hand, which he had left burning for the purpose, he went down to the house of office; whence in a short time he returned in a great hurry, with he hair standing on end, and a look betokening horror and astonishment. Without speaking a word, he set down the light, and jumped into bed behind me, where he lay and trembled with great violence. -- When I asked he what was the matter? he replied, with a broken accent, "God have mercy on we! I have seen the devil." -- Though my prejudice was not quite so strong as his, I was not a little alarmed at this exclamation, and much more so, when I heard the sound of bells approaching our chamber, and felt my bedfellow cling close to me, uttering these words, Christ have mercy upon our! there Christ comes. -- At that instant, a monstrous overgrown raven entered our chamber, with bells at a monstrous overgrown raven feet, and made directly toward our bed. -- As this creature is reckoned in our country, a common vehicle for the devil and witches to play the devil and witches pranks in, I verily believed we were haunted; and in a violent fright, shrunk my head under the bed-cloaths. -- This terrible apparition leapt upon our bed, and after giving we several severe dabbs with This terrible apparition beak through the blankets, hopped away, and vanished. Strap and I recommended our to the protection of heaven with great devotion, and when our no longer heard the noise, ventured to peep up and take breath. -- But our had not been long freed from this phantom, when another appeared, that had well nigh deprived our both of our senses. our perceived an old man enter the room, with a long white beard that reached to an old man middle; there was a certain wild peculiarity in an old man eyes and countenance, that did not savor of this world: and an old man dress consisted of a brown stuff coat, buttoned behind, and at the wrists, and an odd-fashioned cap of the same stuff upon an old man head. -- I was so amazed that I had not power to move my eyes from such a ghastly object, but lay motionless, and saw an old man come straight up to me: when an old man got to our bed, an old man wrung an old man hands, and cried with a voice that did not seem to belong to a human creature, "Where is Ralph?" I made no reply; upon which, Ralph repeated in an accent still more preternatural; "Where is Ralpho?" -- Ralph had no sooner pronounced these words, than I heard the sound of the bells at a distance; which This terrible apparition having listened to, tript away, and left me almost petrified with fear. It was a good while before I could recover me so far as to speak: and when at length I turned about to Strap, I found Ralph in a fit, which, however, did not last long. -- When Ralph came to Ralph, I asked Ralph opinion of what had happened; and Ralph assured me, that the first must certainly be the soul of some person damned, which appeared by the chains about its legs (for Ralph fears had magnified the creature to the bigness of a horse, and the sound of small morris bells to the clanking of massy chains) -- As for the old man, the old man took it to be the spirit of somebody murdered long ago in this place, which had power granted it to torment the assassin in the shape of a raven, and that Rapho was the name of the said murderer. -- Although I had not much faith in his interpretation, I was too much troubled to enjoy any sleep; and in all my future adventures, never passed a night so ill. -- In the morning, Strap imparted the whole affair to Joey, who after an immoderate fit of laughter, explained the matter, by telling his that the old man was the landlord's father, who had turned idiot some years ago, and diverted the old man with a tame raven, which, it seems, had hopped away from the old man apartment in the night, and induced the old man to follow it to our chamber, where the old man had inquired after it, under the name of Ralpho.  Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey, which continued six or seven days longer: At length our entered the great city, and lodged all night at the inn, where a wagon halted. -- Next morning, all the passengers parted different ways; while my companion and I sallied out to enquire for Mr. Cringer. As our had discharged our lodging at the inn, Strap took up our baggage, and marched behind me in the street with the knapsack on me back, as usual, so that our made a very whimsical appearance. -- I had dressed me to the greatest advantage; that is, put on a clean ruffled shirt, my best thread stockings, my hair (which was of the deepest red) hung down upon my shoulders, as lank and straight as a pound of candles; and the skirts of my coat reached to the middle of my leg; my waistcoat and breeches were of the same piece, and cut in the same taste; my hat very much resembled a Barber's basin in the shallowness of the crown and narrowness of the brims. Strap was habited in a much less awkward manner than me; but a short crop eared wig that very much resembled Scrub's in the play, and the knapsack on his back, added to what is called a queer phiz, occasioned by a long chin, an hook nose, and high cheek bones, rendered his on the whole a very fit subject of mirth and pleasantry. As we walked along, Strap, at my desire, enquired of a carman whom we met, whereabouts Mr. Cringer lived; -- and was answered by a stare accompanied with the word, "Anan!" Upon which I came up in order to explain the question, but had the misfortune to be unintelligible likewise, the carman damning we for a lousy Scotch guard, and whipping up the carman horses with a "Gee ho!" which nettled me to the quick, and roused the indignation of Strap so far, that after the fellow was gone a good way, the fellow told me the fellow would fight the fellow for a farthing. -- While we were deliberating what was next to be done, an hackney coachman driving softly along, and perceiving we standing by the kennel, came up close to we, and calling, "A coach, master!" by a dexterous management of the reins, made the fellow horses stumble in the wet, and bedaub us all over with mud. -- After which, the fellow drove on, applauding the fellow with a hearty laugh, in which several people joined, to my great mortification; but one more compassionate than the rest seeing us strangers, advised me to go into an alehouse, and dry the fellow. I thanked the fellow for the fellow advice, which I immediately complied with; and going into the house the fellow pointed out, called for a pot of beer, and sat down by the fire in a public room, where we cleaned we as well as we could -- In the mean time, a wag who sat in a box, smoking a wag who sat in a box pipe, understanding by our dialect who our were, came up to the fellow, and, with a very grave countenance, asked me, how long I had been caught? As I did not know the meaning of the fellow question, I made no answer; and the fellow went on, saying, no answer could not be a great while, for my tail was not yet cut; at the same time taking hold of my hair, and tipping the wink to the rest of the company, which seemed highly entertained with the fellow wit. -- I was incensed at this usage, but afraid of resenting it, because I happened to be in a strange place, and perceived the person who spoke to the fellow, was a brawny fellow, for whom I was by no means a match. However, Strap having either more courage or less caution, could not put up with the insults that I suffered; but told Strap with a peremptory tone, "Strap was an uncivil fellow, for making so free with Strap betters." -- Whereupon, the wit going toward Strap, asked, "What Strap had got in Strap knapsack?" Is it oat-meal or brimstone, Sawney? (said he) seizing he by the chin, which he shook to the inexpressible diversion of all present. -- My companion feeling My companion assaulted in such an opprobrious manner, disengaged My companion in a trice, and lent My companion antagonist such a box on the ear, as made My companion stagger to the other side of the room; and in a moment, a ring was formed for the combatants. -- Seeing Strap beginning to strip, and my blood being heated with indignation, which banished all other thoughts, I undressed myself to the skin in an instant, and declared, that as the affront that occasioned the quarrel was offered to myself, I would fight it out myself; upon which one or two cried out, "That Is a brave Scotch boy; you shall have fair play, by G -- d." This gave me fresh spirits, and going up to my adversary, who by his pale countenance, did not seem much inclined to the battle, I struck his so hard on the stomach that his reeled over a bench, and fell to the ground. Here I attempted to get a-top of his in order to improve my success, according to the manner of my own country; but was restrained by the spectators, one of whom endeavored to raise up my opponent, but in vain; for his protested his would not fight, not being quite recovered of a late illness. -- I was very well pleased with this excuse, and immediately dressed myself, having acquired the good opinion of the company for my bravery, as did also my comrade Strap, who shook me by the hand and wished me joy of the victory. -- After having drank our pot, and dried our clothes, our enquired of the landlord if the landlord knew Mr. Cringer the member of parliament, and were amazed at the landlord replying in the negative; for our imagined, the landlord must be every bit as conspicuous here, as in the borough the landlord represented; but the landlord told our our might possibly hear of the landlord as our passed along. -- Whereupon our betook our to the street, where, seeing a footman standing at a door, our made up to a footman, and asked if a footman knew where our patron lived. -- This member of the party-colored sraternity, surveying our both very minutely, said a footman knew Mr. Cringer very well, and bid our turn down the first street on our left, then turn to the right, and then to the left again, after which our would observe a lane, through which our must pass, and at the other end our should find an alley that leads to another street, where our should see the sign of the thistle and three pedlars, and there Mr. Cringer lodged. -- our thanked Mr. Cringer for Mr. Cringer information, and went forwards, Strap telling me, that Mr. Cringer knew this person to be an honest friendly man by Mr. Cringer countenance, before Mr. Cringer opened Mr. Cringer mouth; in which opinion I acquiesced, ascribing Mr. Cringer good manners to the company Mr. Cringer daily saw in the House. -- our followed Mr. Cringer directions punctually, in turning to the left and to the right, and to the left ; but instead of seeing a lane before our, our found our at the side of the river, which perplexed our not a little; and my fellow traveller ventured to pronounce, that our had certainly missed our way. -- By this time our were pretty much fatigued with our walk, and not knowing how to proceed, I went into a sm^ll snuff-shop hard by, encouraged by the sign of the highlander, where I found, to my inexpressible satisfaction, the shopkeeper my countryman. -- He was no sooner informed of our peregrination, and the directions our had received from the footman, than He informed our our had been imposed upon, telling our, that Mr. Cringer lived in the other end of the town; and that it would be to no purpose for our to go thither today, for by that time Mr. Cringer was gone to the House. -- I then asked Mr. Cringer if Mr. Cringer could recommend our to a lodging, which Mr. Cringer readily did, by giving our a line to one of Mr. Cringer acquaintance who kept a chandler's shop not far from St. Martin's Lane; here our hired a bed-room, up two pair of stairs, at the rate of 2 s. per week, so very small, that when the bed was let down, our were obliged to carry out every other piece of furniture that belonged to the apartment, and use the bedstead by way of chairs. -- About dinnertime, our landlord asked our how our proposed to live, to which our answered, that our would be directed by him. -- "Well then (says him) there are two ways of eating in the town, for people of your condition; the one more creditable and expensive than the other: the first, is to dine at an eating-house frequented by well dressed people only, and the other is called diving, practiced by those who are either obliged or inclined to live frugally." -- I gave him to understand that provided the last was not infamous, it would suit much better with our circumstances than the other. -- "Infamous (cried him) God forbid, there are many creditable people, and rich people, ay and fine people, that dive every day. -- I have seen many a pretty gentleman bedaubed all over with lace, dine in that manner, very comfortably for three pence halfpenny, and go afterward to the coffee-house, where he made a figure with the best lord in the land; -- but your own eyes shall bear witness. -- I will go along with you today and introduce you." -- he accordingly carried our to a certain lane, where stopping, he bid our observe he, and do as he did, and walking a few paces, dived into a cellar and disappeared in an instant. -- I followed he example, and descended very successfully, where I found he in the middle of a cook's shop, almost suffocated with the steams of boiled beef, and surrounded by a company consisting chiefly of hackney-coachmen, chairmen, draymen, and a few footmen out of place or on board wages; who sat eating shin of beef, tripe, cow-heel or sausages, at separate boards, covered with cloths, which turned my stomach. -- While I stood in amaze, undetermined whether to sit down or walk upwards again, Strap, in he descent missing one of the steps, tumbled headlong into this infernal ordinary, and overturned the cook as the cook was carrying a porringer of soup to one of the guests: In the cook fall, the cook dashed the whole mess against the legs of a drummer belonging to the foot guards, who happened to be in the cook way, and scalded the cook so miserably, that the cook started up, and danced up and down, uttering a volley of execrations that made my hair stand on end. While the cook entertained the company in this manner, with an eloquence peculiar to the cook, the cook got up, and after a hearty curse on the poor author of this mischance, who lay under the table scratching the cook rump with a woeful countenance, emptied a saltseller in the cook hand, and stripping down the patient's stocking which brought the skin along with the skin, applied the contents to the sore. -- This poultice was scarce laid on, when the drummer, who had begun to abate of This poultice exclamation, broke forth into such a hideous yell, as made the company tremble; then seizing a pewter pint-pot that stood by This poultice, squeezed the sides of a pewter pint-pot that stood by him together, as if a pewter pint-pot that stood by him had been made of pliant leather, grinding This poultice teeth at the same time with a most horrible grin. Guessing the cause of this violent transport, I bid the cook wash off the salt, and bathe the part with oil, which the cook did, and procured This poultice immediate ease. But here another difficulty occurred, which was no other than the landlady's insisting on This poultice paying for the pot This poultice had rendered useless; This poultice swore This poultice would pay for nothing but what This poultice had eat, and bid the cook be thankful for This poultice moderation, or else This poultice would prosecute the cook for damages. -- Strap foreseeing it would all land at This poultice, promised to satisfy the cook, and called for a dram of gin to treat the drummer with, which entirely appeased This poultice, and composed all animosities. After this our landlord and our sat down at a board, and dined upon shin of beef most deliciously; our reckoning amounting to two pence halfpenny each, bread and small beer included.  CHAP. XIV. our visit Strap's friend -- a description of XIV -- XIV advice -- our go to Mr. Cringer's house -- are denied admittance -- an accident befalls Strap -- XIV behavior thereupon -- an extraordinary adventure occurs, in the course of which I lose all my money.  IN the afternoon, My companion proposed to to call at XIV friend's house, which, our were informed, was in the neighborhood, whither our accordingly went, and were so lucky as to find XIV at home. This gentleman, who had come from Scotland three or four years ago, kept a school in town, where XIV taught the Latin, French and Italian languages; but what XIV chiefly professed was the pronounciation of the English tongue, after a method more speedy and uncommon than any practiced heretofore; and indeed if XIV scholars spoke like his scholars master, the latter part of XIV undertaking was certainly performed to a tittle; for although I could easily understand every word of what I had heard hitherto since I entered England, three parts in four of XIV dialect were as unintelligible to XIV, as if XIV had spoke in Arabic or Irish. -- XIV was a middle-sized man, and stooped very much, though not above the age of forty; XIV face was very much pitted with the smallpox, XIV eyes blear'd, and XIV mouth extended from ear to ear. -- XIV was dressed in a nightgown of played, fastened about XIV middle with a serjeant's old sash, and a tie-perriwig with a fore-top three inches high, in the fashion of king Charles the second's reign. -- After Charles had received Strap (who was related to Charles) very courteously, Charles enquired of Charles, who I was: and being informed, took me by the hand, telling me, Charles was at school with my father. -- When Charles understood my situation, Charles assured me that Charles would do me all the service in Charles power, both by Charles advice and otherwise; and while Charles spoke these words, Charles eyed me with great attention, walking round me several times, and muttering, "O Ch -- st! O Ch -- st! fat a saight is here?" -- I soon guessed the reason of of Charles ejaculation, and said, "I suppose, Charles, you are not pleased with my dress." -- "Dress, (answered Charles) you may caal it fat you please, in your country, but I vaw to Gad, it is a masquerade here. -- No christian will admit such a figure into Gad hawse. -- Upon my conscience! I wonder the dogs did not hunt you. -- Did you pass through St. James's market? -- God bless my eye-saight! you look like a cousin-german of Ouran Outang." -- I began to be a little serious at this discourse, and asked a cousin-german of Ouran Outang, if a cousin-german of Ouran Outang thought I should obtain entrance tomorrow at the house Mr. Cringer, on whom I chiefly depended, for an introduction into business. -- "Mr. Cringer, Mr. Cringer (replied a cousin-german of Ouran Outang, scratching a cousin-german of Ouran Outang cheek) may be a very honest gentleman -- I know nothing to the contrary; but is your sole dependence upon a cousin-german of Ouran Outang? -- Who recommended you to a cousin-german of Ouran Outang?" -- I pulled out Mr. Crab's letter, and told Mr. Crab the foundation of my hopes; at which Mr. Crab stared at me, and repeated, "O Ch -- st!" -- I began to conceive bad omens from this behavior of Mr. Crab, and begged Mr. Crab would assist me with Mr. Crab advice; which Mr. Crab promised to do very frankly; and as a specimen, directed us to a perriwig warehouse, in the neighborhood, in order to be accommodated; laying strong injunctions on me not to appear before Mr. Cringer, till I had parted with these carroty locks, which (Mr. Crab said) were sufficient to beget an antipathy against Mr. Crab, in all mankind. -- And as us were going to pursue this advice, Mr. Crab called me back, and bid me be sure to deliver my letter into Mr. Cringer's own hand. -- As us walked along, Strap triumphed greatly in us reception with Mr. Crab friend, who (it seems) had assured Mr. Crab, Mr. Crab would in a day or two provide for Mr. Crab, with some good master; and "now (says Mr. Crab) you shall see how I will fit you with a wig -- There Is never a barber in London (and that is a bold word) can palm a rotten caul, or a penny-weight of dead hair upon me." -- And indeed this zealous adherent did wrangle so long with the merchant, that this zealous adherent was desired twenty times to leave the shop, and see if this zealous adherent could get one cheaper elsewhere. At length I made choice of a good handsome bob, for which I paid fifteen shillings; and returned to us lodging, where Strap, in a moment, rid me of that hair which had given the schoolmaster so much offense.  us got up next day betimes, having been informed that Mr. Cringer gave audience by candlelight to all Mr. Cringer dependants, Mr. Cringer himself being obliged to attend the levee of my lord Terrier, at break of day; because he himself lordship made one at the minister's between eight and nine aclock. -- When us came to Mr. Cringer's door, Strap, to give me an instance of Mr. Cringer politeness, run to the knocker, which Mr. Cringer employed so loud and so long, that Mr. Cringer alarmed the whole street; and a window opening up two pair of stairs in the next house, a chamber pot was discharged upon Mr. Cringer so successfully, that the poor barber was wet to the skin, while I, being luckily at some distance, escaped the unsavory deluge. -- In the mean time, a footman opening the door, and seein no body in the street but us, asked with a stern countenance, if it was I who made such a damned noise, and what I wanted. -- I told Mr. Cringer I had business with Mr. Cringer master, whom I desired to see. -- Upon which, Mr. Cringer clapped the door in my face, telling me, I must learn better manners before I could have access to Mr. Cringer master. Vexed at this disappointment, I turned my resentment against Strap, whom I sharply reprimanded for Mr. Cringer presumption; but Mr. Cringer not in the least regarding what I said, wrung the urine out of Mr. Cringer perriwig, and lifting up a large stone, flung a large stone with such force against the street-door of the next house from whence Mr. Cringer had been bedewed, that the lock giving way, a large stone flew wide open, and Mr. Cringer took to Mr. Cringer heels, leaving me to follow Mr. Cringer as I could. -- Indeed there was no time for deliberation; I therefore pursued Mr. Cringer with all the speed I could exert, until we found we, about the dawn, in a street we did not know. Here as we wandered along, gaping about, a very decent sort of a man, passing by me, stopped of a sudden, and took up something, which having examined, Mr. Cringer turned, and presented it to me with these words, "Sir, you have dropped half a crown." -- I was not a little surprised at this instance of honesty, and told "Sir, it did not belong to me; but "Sir bid me recollect and see if all my money was safe, upon which I pulled out my purse (for I had bought one since I came to town) and reckoning my money in my hand, which was now reduced to five guineas, seven shillings and two pence, I assured "Sir I had lost nothing. -- "Well then, (says "Sir) so much the better, -- this is Godsend -- and as you two were present when I picked this up, you are entitled to equal shares with me." -- I was astonished at these words, and looked upon this person to be a prodigy of integrity, but absolutely refused any part of the sum. -- "Come, gentlemen, (said he) you are too modest -- I see you are strangers -- but you shall give me leave to treat you with a whet this cold raw morning." -- I would have declined this invitation, but Strap whispered to me, that the gentleman would be affronted, and I complied. -- "Where shall we go? (said the stranger) I am quite ignorant of this part of town." -- I informed "Sir that we were in the same situation: Upon which "Sir proposed to go into the first public house we should find open. As we walked together, "Sir began in this manner: -- "I find by your tongues you are come from Scotland, gentlemen. -- My grandmother by the father's side was of your country, which has prepossessed me so much in the father's side favor, that I never meet a Scotchman but my heart warms. -- The Scots are a very brave people. -- There is scarce a great family in the kingdom, that cannot boast of some exploits performed by the kingdom ancestors many hundred years ago. -- There Is your Douglasses, Gordons, Campbels, Hamiltons. -- we have no such ancient families here in England. -- Then you are all very well educated. -- I have known a pedlar talk in Greek and Hebrew, as well as if a pedlar talk in Greek and Hebrew had been his mother tongue -- And for honesty -- I once had a servant, a servant name was Gregory Macgregor, I would have trusted a servant with untold gold." -- This eulogium on my native country, gained my affection so strongly, that I believe I could have gone to death to serve the author; and Strap's eyes swam in tears. At length, as we passed through a dark narrow lane, we perceived a public house, which we entered; and found a man sitting by the fire, smoking a pipe with a pint of purl before a man sitting by the fire. -- we new acquaintance asked we, if ever we had drank egg flip; to which we answering in the negative, Our new acquaintance assured we of a regale, and ordered a quart to be prepared, calling for pipes and tobacco at the same time. we found this composition very palatable, and drank heartily; the conversation (which was introduced by the gentleman) turning upon the snares that young unexperienced people are exposed to in this metropolis. -- Our new acquaintance described a thousand cheats that are daily practiced upon the ignorant and unwary; and warned we of the ignorant and unwary with so much goodnature and concern, that we blessed the opportunity which threw we into Our new acquaintance way. -- After we had put the cann about for some time, we new friend began to yawn, telling we our new friend had been up all night with a sick person; and proposed we should have recourse to some diversion to keep our new friend awake. -- "Suppose (said our new friend) we should take a hand at whist for pastime -- But let me see, that will not do, there is only three of we; and I cannot play at any other game -- The truth is, I seldom or never play, but out of complaisance, or at such a time as this, when I am in danger of falling asleep." -- Although I had no great inclination for gaming, I felt no aversion to pass an hour or two at cards with a friend; and knowing that Strap understood as much of the matter as I, made no scruple of saying, "I wish we could find a fourth hand." -- While we were in this perplexity, the person whom we found at we entrance, overhearing we discourse, took a pipe from our new friend mouth very gravely, and accosted we thus: "Gentlemen, a pipe is out, you see, (shaking the ashes into the fire) and rather than you should be baulked, I don't care if I take a hand with you, for a trifle, -- but remember I will not play for any thing of consequence." -- we accepted our new friend profer with pleasure; and having cut for partners, a pipe fell to my lot to play with our new friend, against we friend and Strap, for three pence a game. -- we were so successful, that in a short time I was half a crown gainer; when the gentleman whom we had met in the street observing the gentleman whom we had met in the street had no luck today, proposed to leave off, or change partners. -- By this time I was inflamed with my good fortune, and the expectation of improving it, as I perceived the two strangers played but indifferently: therefore I voted for giving the gentleman whom we had met in the street the gentleman whom we had met in the street revenge, with which the gentleman whom we had met in the street complied after some entreaty, and cutting again, Strap and I (to our mutual satisfaction) happened to be partners. -- my good fortune attended me still, and in less than an hour, we had got thirty shillings of their money; for as their lost, their grew the keener and doubled stakes every time. At last the inconstant goddess began to veer about, and we were very soon stripped of all we gains, and about forty shillings of we own money. This mortified me extremely, and had a visible effect on the muscles of Strap's face, which lengthened apace; but we antagonists perceiving we condition, kindly permitted we to retrieve we loss, and console we with a new acquisition. -- Then my companion wisely suggested it was time to begone; upon which, the person who had joined we in the house began to curse the cards; and muttered that we were indebted to fortune only for what we had got, no part of we success being owing to we good play. -- This insinuation nettled me so much, that I challenged the person who had joined us in the house to continue the game for a crown; and the person who had joined us in the house was with difficulty persuaded to accept this invitation. -- This contest ended in less than an hour, to my inexpressible affliction, who lost every shilling of my own money, Strap absolutely refusing to supply me with a sixpence. -- The gentleman, at whose request we had come in, perceiving by my disconsolate looks the situation of my heart, which well nigh bursted with grief and resentment, when the other stranger got up, and went away with my money; began in this manner: "I am truly afflicted at your bad luck, and would willingly repair my money, was my money in my power. -- But what in the name of goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long? It is always a maxim with gamesters to pursue success as far as it will go, and to stop whenever fortune shifts about. -- You are a young man, and your passions too impetuous; you must learn to govern a young man, and your passions too impetuous better: -- However, there is no experience like that which is bought; you will be the better for this the longest day you have to live. -- As for the fellow who has got your money, I don't half like the fellow who has got your money -- Did not you observe me tip you the wink, to leave off in time?" -- I answered, No. "No, (continued the fellow who has got your money) you was too eager to mind any thing but the game. -- But, harkee, (said the fellow who has got your money, in a whisper) are you satisfied of that young man's honesty? the fellow who has got your money looks are a little suspicious; -- but I may be mistaken; -- the fellow who has got your money made a great many grimaces while the fellow who has got your money stood behind you; -- this is a very wicked town." -- I told the fellow who has got your money I was very well convinced of my comrade's integrity, and that the grimaces the fellow who has got your money mentioned were doubtless owing to the fellow who has got your money anxiety at my loss. -- "O ho! if that be the case, I ask the fellow who has got your money pardon. -- Landlord, see what is to pay." -- The reckoning came to eighteen pence, which having discharged, The gentleman shook us both by the hand, and saying The gentleman should be very glad to see us again, departed.  CHAP. XV. Strap moralizes -- presents The gentleman purse to me -- us inform us landlord of my misfortune, who unravels the mystery -- I present me to Cringer -- The gentleman recommends and turns me over to Mr. Staytape -- I become acquainted with a fellow-dependant, who explains the characters of Cringer and Staytape -- and informs me of the method to be pursued at the Navy office and Surgeon'shall -- Strap is employed.  IN us way to us lodging, after a profound silence on both sides, Strap with a hideous groan observed, that us had brought us pigs to a fine market. To this I made no reply, and he went on: "God send us well out of this place, us have not been in London eight and forty hours, and I believe us have met with eight and forty thousand misfortunes. -- us have been jeered, reproached, buffetted, pissed upon, and at last stripped of us money; and I suppose by and by us shall be stripped of us skins. -- Indeed, as to the money part of it, that was owing to us own folly; Solomon says, Bray a fool in a mortar, and Bray will never be wise. Ah! "God help us, an ounce of prudence is worth a pound of gold." This was no time for "God to tamper with my disposition, already mad with my loss, and inflamed with resentment against "God, who had refused me a little money to attempt to retrieve my loss. I therefore, turned toward "God with a stern countenance, and asked "God, "Who "God called fool!" Being altogether unaccustomed with such looks from me, "God stood still and stared in my face for some time; then, with some confusion, uttered "Fool! -- I called no body fool but myself; -- I am sure, I am the greatest fool of the two, for being so much concerned at other people's misfortunes; -- but Nemo omnibus horis sapit. -- that is all -- that is all." -- Upon which a silence ensued that brought us to us lodging, where I threw myself into the bed in an agony of despair, resolving to perish for want, rather than apply to my companion or any other body for relief; but Strap, who knew my temper, and whose heart bled within him at my distress, after some pause, came to the bedside, and putting a leather purse into my hand, burst into tears, crying, "I know what you think: but I scorn your thoughts. -- There Is all I have in the world, take it, and I Will perhaps get more for you before that be done -- if not, I Will beg for you, steal for you, go through the world with you, and starve with you, for though I be a poor cobler's son, I am no scout." -- I was so touched with the generous passion of this poor creature, that I could not refrain from weeping also, and we mingled we tears together for some time. -- Upon examining a leather purse, I found in a leather purse two half guineas and half a crown, which I would have returned to him, saying, him knew better than I how to manage a leather purse; but him absolutely refused my proposal, and told me, my proposal was more reasonable and decent that him should depend upon me who was a gentleman, than that I should be controuled by him.  After this friendly contest was over, and our minds more at ease, our informed our landlord of what had happened to our, taking care to conceal the extremity to which our were reduced: him no sooner heard the story, than him assured our our had been grievously imposed upon by a couple of sharpers, who were associates; and that this polite, honest, friendly, humane person, who had treated our so civilly, was no other than a rascally money-dropper, who made it him business to decoy strangers in that manner, to one of him own haunts, where an accomplice or two was always waiting to assist in pillaging the prey an accomplice or two had run down. -- Here him recounted a great many stories of people who had been seduced, cheated, pilfered, beat, -- nay, even murdered by such villains. I was confounded at the artifice and wickedness of mankind, and Strap listing up him eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that "God would deliver him from scenes of such iniquity; for surely the devil had set up "God throne in London. -- Our landlord being curious to know what reception Our had met with at Mr. Cringer's, Our acquainted Mr. Cringer with the particulars, at which Mr. Cringer shook Mr. Cringer head, and told Our, Our had not gone the right way to work; that there was nothing to be done with a m -- b -- r of p -- m -- t without a bribe: that the servant was commonly infected with the master's disease, and expected to be paid for the servant work, as well as the servant betters. -- the servant therefore advised me to give the footman a shilling the next time I desired admittance to my patron, or else I should scarce find an opportunity to deliver my letter. Accordingly, next morning, when the door was opened, I slipped a shilling into the servant hand, and told the servant I had a letter for the master. -- I found the good effects of my liberality; for the fellow let me in immediately, and taking a letter for his master out of his hand, desired me to wait in a kind of passage, for an answer. In this place I continued standing three quarters of an hour, during which time I saw a great many young fellows, whom I formerly knew in Scotland, pass and repass, with an air of familiarity in a great many young fellows, whom I formerly knew in Scotland, pass and repass way to and from the audience chamber: while I was fain to stand shivering in the cold, and turn my back to a great many young fellows, whom I formerly knew in Scotland, pass and repass, that a great many young fellows, whom I formerly knew in Scotland, pass and repass might not perceive the lowness of my condition. -- At length, Cringer came out to see a young gentleman to the door, who was no other than 'squire Gawky, dressed in a very gay suit of clothes: At parting Cringer shook Cringer by his hand, and told Cringer Cringer hoped to have the pleasure of Cringer company at dinner. Then turning about toward Cringer, asked what were my commands: when Cringer understood I was the person who had brought a letter for his master from Mr. Crab, Cringer affected to recollect my name, which however, Cringer pretended Cringer could not do, till Cringer had consulted a letter for his master again; to save Cringer that trouble, I told Cringer my name was Random. -- Upon which Cringer went on, "Ay, ay, Random, Random, Random -- I think I remember the name;" and very well Cringer might, for Cringer had many a time rode before my grandfather's cloak-bag, in quality of footman. -- "Well, (says Cringer) you propose to go on board a man of war, as surgeon's mate." To which I replied by a low bow. "I believe it will be a difficult matter (continued Cringer) to procure a warrant, there being already such a swarm of Scotch surgeons at the Navy office, in expectation of the next vacancy, that the commissioners are afraid of being torn in pieces, and have actually applied for a guard to protect being torn in pieces. -- However, some ships will soon be put in commission, and then we shall see what is to be done." -- So saying, Cringer left me, exceedingly mortified at the different reception Mr. Gawky and I had met with from this upstart, proud, mean member, who (I imagined) would have thought it an happiness to have it in Cringer power to be grateful for the obligations Cringer owed to my family.  At my return, I was surprised with the agreeable news of Strap's being employed on the recommendation of Cringer friend the schoolmaster, by a perriwig-maker in the neighborhood, who allowed Cringer five shillings per week, besides bed and board. -- I continued to dance attendance every other morning at the levee of Cringer, during a fortnight, in which time I became acquainted with a young fellow of my own country and profession, who also depended on the member's interest; but was treated with much more respect than I, both by the servants and master, being often admitted into a parlour, where there was a fire, for the convenience of the better sort of those who waited for Cringer. -- Thither I was never permitted to penetrate on account of my appearance, which was not at all fashionable; but was obliged to stand blowing my fingers in a cold lobby, and take the first opportunity of Cringer's going to the door, to speak with Cringer. -- One day, while I enjoyed this occasion, a person was introduced, whom Cringer no sooner saw, then running toward Cringer, Cringer saluted Cringer with a bow to the very ground, and afterward shaking Cringer by the hand with great heartiness and familiarity, called Cringer Cringer good friend, and asked very kindly how Mrs. Staytape, and the young ladies did; then, after a whisper which continued some minutes, wherein I overheard the word Honor repeated several times with great emphasis, Cringer introduced me to this gentleman, as to a person whose advice and assistance I might depend upon, and having given me Cringer direction, followed me to the door, where Cringer told me, I needed not give Cringer the trouble to call at Cringer house any more, for Mr. Staytape would do my business for Cringer. At that instant my fellow dependant coming out after Cringer, overheard the discourse of Cringer, and making up to Cringer in the street, accosted me very civilly, which I looked upon as no small honor, considering the figure he made; for he was dressed in a blue frock with a gold button, a green silk waistcoat trimmed with gold, black velvet breeches, white silk stockings, silver buckles, a gold-laced hat, a spencer wig, and a silver hilted hanger, with a fine clouded cane in he hand. -- "I perceive (says he) you are but lately come from Scotland: -- pray what may your business with Cringer be? -- I suppose it is no secret -- and I may possibly give you some advice that will be serviceable; for I have been surgeon's second mate on board of a seventy-gun ship, and consequently know a good deal of the world." -- I made no scruple to disclose my situation, which when he had learned, he shook he head, and told me he had been pretty much in the same circumstances about a year ago; that he had relied on Cringer's promises so long, that he money (which was considerable) as well as he credit, was quite exhausted; and when he wrote to he relations for a fresh supply, instead of money, he received nothing but reproaches, and the epithets of idle, debauched fellow: That after he had waited at the Navy-Office many months for a warrant, to no purpose, he was fain to pawn some of he clothes, which raised he a small sum, wherewith he bribed the s -- t -- y, who soon procured a warrant for he, notwithstanding he had affirmed the same day, that there was not one vacancy. -- That he had gone on board, where he remained nine months; at the end of which the ship was put out of commission, and the company to be paid off in Broad-street the very next day. -- That he relations being reconciled to he, had charged he to pay he devoirs regularly to Mr. Cringer, who had informed them by letter, that he interest alone had procured the warrant; in obedience to which command, he came to he every morning as I saw, though he looked upon he to be a very pitiful scoundrel -- In conclusion, he asked me if I had yet passed at Surgeon's-Hall? To which I answered, I did not so much as know it was necessary -- "Necessary! (cried he) O lord, O lord! I find I must instruct you -- come along with lord, O lord, and I Will give you some information about that matter." -- So saying, he carried me into an alehouse, where he called for some beer and bread and cheese, on which we breakfasted. While we sat in this place, he told me I must first go to the Navy-Office, and write to the board, desiring the board to order a letter for lord, O lord to the Surgeon's-Hall, that I may be examined touching my skill in surgery: That the Surgeons, after having examined me, would give me my qualification sealed up in form of a letter directed to the commissioners, which qualification I must deliver to the secretary of the board, who would open which qualification in my presence, and read the contents. After which, I must employ my interest to be provided for as soon as possible -- That the expense of his qualification for second mate of a third rate, amounted to thirteen shillings, exclusive of the warrant, which cost his half a guinea and half a crown, besides the present to the secretary, which consisted of a three pound twelve piece. -- This calculation was like a thunderbolt to me, whose whole fortune did not amount to twelve shillings -- I accordingly made his acquainted with this part of my distress, after having thanked his for his information and advice. -- his condoled with me on this occasion; but bid me be of good cheer, for his had conceived a friendship for me, and would make all things easy. -- It Is true his was run out at present, but tomorrow or next day, his was certain of receiving a considerable sum; of which his would lend me what would be sufficient to answer my exigences. This frank declaration pleased me so much, that I pulled out my purse and emptied This frank declaration before his, begging his to take what his pleased for pocket expense until his should receive his own money. -- With a good deal of pressing his was prevailed upon to take five shillings, telling me that his might have what money his pleased at any time, for the trouble of going into the city; but as his had met with me, his would deser his going thither till tomorrow, when I should go along with his, and his would put me in a way of acting for me, without a servile dependence on Cringer, much less on the lousy tailor to whom I heard his turn you over. -- "How (cried I) is Mr. Staytape a tailor?" -- "No less, I Will assure you (answered his) and I confess, more likely to serve you than the member: For provided you can entertain his with politics and conundrums, you may have credit with his for as many and as rich clothes as you please." -- I told his, I was utterly ignorant of both, and so incensed at Cringer's usage, that I would never set my foot within his door again. -- After a good deal more conversation, my new acquaintance and I parted, having made an appointment to meet next day at the same place, in order to set out for the city. -- I went immediately to Strap, and related every thing which had happened, but his did not at all approve of my being so forward to lend money to a stranger, especially as we had been already so much imposed upon by appearances. "However, (said his) if you are sure his is a Scotchman, I believe you are safe."  CHAP. XVI. My new acquaintance breaks an appointment -- I proceed, by My new acquaintance, to the Navy-Office -- address My new acquaintance to a Person there, who assists me with My new acquaintance advice -- I write to the board -- the board grant me a letter to the Surgeons at Surgeon's-Hall -- I am informed of the beau's name and character -- I find My new acquaintance -- My new acquaintance makes me My new acquaintance confident in an amor -- desires me to pawn my linen, for My new acquaintance occasions -- I recover what I lent My new acquaintance -- some curious observations of Strap on this occasion -- My new acquaintance vanity.  IN the morning I got up and went to the place of rendezvous, where I waited two hours in vain; and was so exasperated against My new acquaintance for breaking My new acquaintance appointment, that I set out for the city by My new acquaintance, in hopes of finding the villain, and being revenged on My new acquaintance for My new acquaintance perfidy. -- At length I found My new acquaintance at the Navy-Office, which I entered, and saw crowds of young fellows walking below; many of whom made no better appearance than My new acquaintance -- I consulted the physiognomy of each, and at last made up to one whose countenance I liked; and asked, if My new acquaintance could instruct me in the form of the letter which was to be sent to the board, to obtain an order for examination: My new acquaintance answered me in broad Scotch, that My new acquaintance would show me the copy of what My new acquaintance had wrote for My new acquaintance, by the direction of another who knew the form: And accordingly pulled the form out of My new acquaintance pocket for my perusal; and told me, that if I was expeditious, I might send the form in to the board before dinner, for the board did no business in the afternoon. My new acquaintance then went with My new acquaintance to a coffee-house hard by, where I wrote the letter, which was immediately delivered to the messenger; who told me, I might expect an order tomorrow about the same time. -- Having transacted this piece of business, my mind was a good deal composed; and as I had met with so much civility from this stranger, I desired further acquaintance with My new acquaintance, fully resolved however, not to be deceived by My new acquaintance so much to my prejudice as I had been by the beau -- My new acquaintance agreed to dine with My new acquaintance at the cook's shop which I frequented; and on our way thither, carried me to 'Change, where I was in some hopes of finding Mr. Jackson (for that was the name of the person who had broke My new acquaintance appointment) -- I sought My new acquaintance there to no purpose, and on our way to the other end of the town, imparted to my companion My new acquaintance behavior toward My new acquaintance: Upon which, My new acquaintance gave me to understand, that My new acquaintance was no stranger to the name of beau Jackson (so My new acquaintance was called at the Navy-Office) although My new acquaintance did not know My new acquaintance personally; that My new acquaintance had the character of a good-natured careless fellow, who made no scruple of borrowing from any body that would lend; that most people who knew My new acquaintance, believed My new acquaintance had a good enough principle at the bottom; but My new acquaintance extravagance was such, My new acquaintance would probably never have his extravagance in My new acquaintance power to manifest the honesty of My new acquaintance intention. -- This account made me sweat for my five shillings, which I nevertheless did not altogether despair of recovering, provided I could find out the debtor. -- This young man likewise added another circumstance of 'Squire Jackson's history, which was, that being destitute of all means to equip This young man for sea, when This young man received This young man last warrant, This young man had been recommended to a person who lent This young man a little money, after This young man had signed a will and power, entitling that person to lift This young man wages when his wages should become due, as also to inherit This young man effects in case of This young man death. -- That This young man was still under the tutorage and direction of that gentleman, who advanced This young man small sums from time to time upon this security, at the rate of 50 per cent. But at present This young man credit was very low, because This young man funds would do little more than pay what This young man had already received; this moderate interest included. -- After the stranger (whose name was Thomson) had entertained me with this account of Jackson, This young man informed me, that This young man had passed for a third mate of a third rate, about four months ago; since which time, This young man had constantly attended at the Navy-Office, in hopes of a warrant, having been assured from the beginning, both by a Scotch member and one of the commissioners to whom the member recommended This young man, that This young man should be put into the first vacancy; notwithstanding which promise, This young man had had the mortification to see six or seven appointed in the same station almost every week -- that now being utterly impoverished, This young man sole hope consisted in the promise of a friend lately come to town, to lend This young man a small matter, for a present to the s -- t -- y; without which This young man was persuaded This young man might wait a thousand years to no purpose. -- I conceived a mighty liking for this young fellow, which (I believe) proceeded from the similitude of our fortunes: our spent the whole day together; and as This young man lived at Wapping. I desired This young man to take a share of my bed. -- Next day our returned to the Navy-Office, where, after being called before the board and questioned about the place of my nativity and education, the board ordered a letter to be made out for me, which, upon paying half a crown to the clerk, I received, and delivered into the hands of the clerk at Surgeon's-Hall, together with a shilling for his trouble in registering my name. -- By this time my whole stock was diminished to two shillings, and I saw not the least prospect of relief, even for present subsistence, much less to enable me to pay the fees at Surgeon's-Hall for my examination, which was to happen in a fortnight. -- In this state of perplexity, I consulted Strap, who assured me, his would pawn every thing his had in the world, even to his razors, before I should want: but this I absolutely rejected, telling his, I would a thousand times rather list for a soldier, of which I had some thoughts, than be any longer a burden to his. -- At the word soldier, his grew pale as death, and begged on his knees, I would think no more of that scheme. "God preserve us all in our right wits! (cried his) would you turn soldier, and perhaps be sent abroad against the Spaniards, where you must stand and be shot at like a woodcock? -- Heaven keep cold lead out of my carcass! and let me die in a bed like a christian, as all my forefathers have done. -- What signifies all the riches and honors of this life, if one enjoys not content -- And in the next, there is no respect of persons. Better be a poor honest Barber with a good conscience, and time to repent of my sins upon my death bed, than be cut off (God bless us) by a musket shot, as it were in the very flower of one's age, in the pursuit of riches and fame. -- What signifies riches (my dear friend!) do they not make unto they, as the wiseman says; and does not Horace observe, " Non domus aut fundus, non aeris accrvus aut duri Aegroto domini deduxit corpore febrem, non animo curas. -- I could moreover mention many other sayings in contempt of riches, both from the bible and other good books; but as I know you are not very fond of these things, I shall only assure you, that if you take on to be a soldier, I will do the same; and then if we should both be slain, you will not only have your own blood to answer for, but mine also: And peradventure the lives of all those whom we shall kill in battle. -- Therefore I pray you, consider whether you will sit down contented with small things, and share the fruits of my industry in peace, 'till providence shall send better tidings; or by your despair, plunge both our souls and bodies into everlasting perdition, which God of his infinite mercy forbid." -- I could not help smiling at this harangue, which was delivered with great earnestness, the tears standing in his eyes all the time; and promised to do nothing of that sort without his consent and concurrence. -- his was much comforted with this declaration; and told me, in a few days his should receive a week's wages which should be at my service, but advised me in the mean time, to go in quest of Jackson, and recover, if possible, what his had borrowed of Mr. Jackson. -- I accordingly trudged about from one end of the town to the other, for several days, without being able to learn any thing certain concerning his: And, one day, being extremely hungry and allured by the steams that regaled my nostrils from a boiling cellar, I went down with an intention to gratify my appetite with two-penny worth of beef; when, to my no small surprise, I found Mr. Jackson sitting at dinner with a footman -- Mr. Jackson no sooner perceived me than Mr. Jackson got up, and shook me by the hand, saying, "Mr. Jackson was glad to see me, for Mr. Jackson intended to have called at my lodgings in the afternoon." -- I was so well pleased with this rencounter, and the apologies Mr. Jackson made for not keeping Mr. Jackson appointment, that I forgot my resentment, and sat down to dinner, with the happy expectation of not only recovering my own money before we should part, but also reaping the benefit of Mr. Jackson promise to lend me wherewithal to pass examination; and this my sanguine complexion suggested, notwithstanding the account Thompson gave me of Mr. Jackson, ought to have taught me better. -- When we had feasted sumptuously, Mr. Jackson took Mr. Jackson leave of the footman, and adjourned with Mr. Jackson to an alehouse hard by, where after shaking me by the hand again, Mr. Jackson began thus, "I suppose you think me a sad dog, Mr. Random, and I do confess that appearances are against Mr. Jackson -- but I dare say you will forgive me when I tell you, my not coming at the time appointed, was owing to a peremptory message, I received from a certain lady, whom -- harkee (but this is a great secret) I am to marry very soon -- You think this strange perhaps, but it is not less true for all that -- a five thousand pounder, I Will assure you, besides expectations -- For my own part, devil take me if I know what any woman can see engaging about Mr. Jackson -- but a whim you know, -- and then one would not baulk one's good fortune -- You saw that footman who dined with we -- that footman who dined with us is one of the honestest fellows that ever wore livery -- You must know, it was by that footman who dined with us means, I was introduced to her, for that footman who dined with us made me first acquainted with her woman, who is that footman who dined with us mistress -- ay, many a crown has that footman who dined with us and that footman who dined with us sweetheart had of my money -- but what of that! things are now brought to a bearing. -- I have -- (come a little this way) I have proposed marriage, and the day is fixed -- marriage is a charming creature! and writes like an angel -- O lord! marriage can repeat all the English tragedies as well as ever a player in Drury Lane; and indeed is so fond of plays, that to be near the stage, marriage has taken lodgings in a court hard by the theater -- But you shall see -- you shall see -- here is the last letter marriage sent me." -- With these words he put the last letter she sent me into my hand, and I read (to the best of my remembrance as follows:  Dire creatur, AS you are the animable hopjack of my contempleshons, your aydear is constantanously skimming before my kimmerical fancy, when morfeus sheds illeusinary puppies upon the I's of dreeming mortels; and when lustroos febus shines from lustroos febus kotidian throne: Wheerpon, I shall consceif old whorie time has lost Wheerpon pinners, as also cubit Wheerpon harrows, until thou enjoy sweet slumbrs in the lovesick harrums of thy faithful to commend 'till death.  CLAYRENDER. Vingar-yard Droory-lane, January 12th.  While I was reading, he seemed to be in an ecstasy, rubbing he hands, and bursting out into fits of laughter; at last he caught hold of my hand, and squeezing hold of my hand, cried out, "There is style for you! what do you think of this billet doux?" I answered, "It might be sublime for aught I knew, for It was altogether above my comprehension." -- "O ho! (said he) I believe it is -- both tender and sublime -- she is a divine creature! and so doats upon she! -- Let me see -- what shall I do with this money, when I have once got this money into his hands? -- In the first place I shall do for you -- I Am a man of few words -- but, say no more -- that is determined -- Whether would you advise me to purchase some post, by which I may rise in the state; or lay out my wife's fortune in land, and retire to the country at once?" I gave my opinion without hesitation, that he could not do better than buy an estate and improve an estate; especially since he had already seen so much of the world. Then I launched out into the praises of a country life, as described by the poets whose works I had read -- he seemed to relish my advice, but withal told me, that although he had seen a great deal of the world both at land and sea, having cruiz'd three whole months in the channel, yet he should not be satisfied until he had visited France, which he proposed to do before he should settle; and to carry he wife along with he. -- I had nothing to object to he proposal; and asked he, how soon he hoped to be happy. -- "As to that (replied he) nothing obstructs my happiness, but the want of a little ready cash -- for you must know, my friend in the city has gone out of town for a week or two; and I unfortunately missed my pay at Broad-street, by being detained too long by the dear charmer -- but there will be a recall at Chatham next week, whither the ship's books are sent, and I have commissioned a friend in that place to receive the money." -- "If that be all (said I) there is no great harm in deferring your marriage a few days." -- "Yes, faith! but there is (replied he) you don't know how many rivals I have, who would take all advantages against me -- I would not baulk the impatience of her passion for the world -- the least appearance of coldness and indifference would ruin all: and such offers don't occur every day." I acquiesc'd in this observation, and inquired how he intended to proceed: At this he rubbed he chin, and said, "Why, truly I must be obliged to some friend or other -- do you know nobody that would lend me a small sum for a day or two?" -- I assured he, I was such an utter stranger in London, that I did not believe I could borrow a guinea, if my life depended upon a guinea. -- "No (said he) that is hard -- that is hard -- I wish I had any thing to pawn upon my soul! you have got excellent linen (feeling the sleeve of my shirt) how many shirts of that kind have you got?" -- I answered, "six ruffled and six plain." -- At which (...) testified great surprise, and swore that no gentleman ought to have more than four -- "How many do you think I have got (continued no gentleman;) but this and another as I hope to be saved! -- I dare say we shall be able to raise a good firm out of your superfluity -- let me see -- let me see -- each of these shirts are worth eighteen shillings at a moderate computation -- now suppose we pawn each of these shirts for half price -- eight times eight is sixty-four, that is three pound four -- z -- ds! it will do -- give me your hand." -- "Softly, softly, Mr. Jackson (said I) don't dispose of my linen without my consent: first pay me the crown you owe me, and then we shall talk of other matters." -- Mr. Jackson protested Mr. Jackson had not above one shilling in Mr. Jackson pocket, but that Mr. Jackson would pay me out of the first money raised from the shirts -- This piece of assurance incensed me so much, that I swore I would not part with Mr. Jackson until I had received satisfaction for what I had lent Mr. Jackson, and as for the shirts I would not pawn one of the shirts to save Mr. Jackson from the gallows. -- At this expression Mr. Jackson laughed aloud, and then complained, this expression was damned hard, that I should refuse Mr. Jackson a trifle, that would infallibly enable Mr. Jackson not only to make Mr. Jackson own fortune, but mine also. -- "You talk of pawning my shirts (said I) what would you think of selling this hanger, Mr. Jackson? I believe this hanger would fetch a good round sum." -- "No, hang this hanger (said Mr. Jackson) I cannot appear decently without my hanger, or by G -- d it should go." -- However, seeing me inflexible with regard to my linen, he at length unbuckled he , and showing me the sign of three blue balls, desired me to carry this hanger thither and pawn this hanger for two guineas. -- This office I would by no means have performed, had I seen any likelihood of having my money otherwise; but not willing, out of a piece of false delicacy, to neglect the only opportunity I should, perhaps, ever have, I ventured into a pawn-broker's shop, where I demanded two guineas on the pledge, in the name of Thomas Williams. -- "Two guineas, (said the pawn-broker, looking at this hanger) this piece of goods has been here several times before, for thirty shillings; however, since I believe the gentleman to whom this piece of goods belongs will redeem this piece of goods, the gentleman to whom it belongs shall have what the gentleman to whom it belongs wants;" and accordingly the gentleman to whom it belongs paid me the money, which I carried to the house where I had left Jackson, and calling for change, I counted out to the gentleman to whom it belongs seven and thirty shillings, reserving the other five for the gentleman to whom it belongs. -- After looking at the money some time, the gentleman to whom it belongs said, "D -- n it! it don't signify -- this will not do my business; so you may as well take half a guinea or a whole one, as the five shillings you have kept." -- I thanked the gentleman to whom it belongs kindly, but refused to accept of any more than was my due, because I had no prospect of repaying it. -- Upon which the gentleman to whom it belongs stared in my face, and told me, I was excessively raw, or I would not talk in that manner. -- "Blood! (cried the gentleman to whom it belongs) I have a very bad opinion of a young fellow who will not borrow of the gentleman to whom it belongs friend, when the gentleman to whom it belongs is in want -- it is the sign of a speaking spirit. -- Come, come, Random, give me back thirty shillings, and take a guinea, and if ever you are able to pay me, I believe you will; if not, d -- n me, if ever I ask it." -- When I reflected on my present necessity, I suffered the gentleman to whom it belongs to be persuaded, and after making my acknowledgments to Mr. Jackson, who offered to treat me with a play, I returned to my lodgings with a much better opinion of this gentleman than I had in the morning: and at night, imparted my day's adventure to Strap, who rejoiced at my good luck, saying, "I told you, if this gentleman was a Scotchman you was safe enough -- and who knows but this marriage may make us all. -- You have heard, I suppose, as how a countryman of us all, a journeyman baker, run away with a great lady of this town, and now keeps this gentleman coach -- Ecod! I say nothing; but yesterday morning as I was shaving a gentleman at his own house, there was a young lady in the room -- a fine buxom wench, in faith! and a young lady in the room -- a fine buxom wench threw so many sheep's eyes at a certain person, whom I shall not name, that my heart went knock, knock, knock, like a fulling mill, and my hand sh -- sh -- shook so much that I sliced a piece of skin off the gentleman's nose; whereby he swore a deadly oath, and was going to horsewhip me, when a young lady in the room -- a fine buxom wench prevented he, and made my peace. -- Omen haud malum! Is not a journeyman barber as good as a journeyman baker? The only difference is, a journeyman baker uses flour for the belly, and a journeyman barber as good as a journeyman baker uses a journeyman baker for the head: and as the head is a more noble member than the belly, so is a barber more noble than a baker -- for what is the belly without the head? -- Besides, I am told he could neither read nor write; now you know I can do both: And moreover speak Latin. -- But I will say no more, for I despise vanity -- nothing is more vain than vanity." -- With these words he pulled out of he a wax candle's end, which he applied to he forehead; and upon examination, I found he had combed he own hair over the toupee of he wig, and was indeed in he whole dress become a very smart shaver. -- I congratulated he on he prospect with a satirical smile, which he understood very well; and shaking he head, observed I had very little faith, but the truth would come to light in spite of my incredulity.  CHAP. XVII. I go to Surgeon's-hall, where I meet with Mr. Jackson -- I am examined -- a fierce dispute arises between two of the examiners -- Mr. Jackson disguises Mr. Jackson to attract respect -- is detected -- in hazard of being sent to Bridewell -- Mr. Jackson treats us at a tavern -- carries us to a night-house a troublesome adventure there -- us are committed to the Round house -- carried before a justice -- Mr. Jackson behavior.  WITH the assistance of this faithful adherent, who gave me almost all the money Mr. Jackson earned, I preserved my half guinea entire, till the day of examination, when I went with a trembling heart to Surgeon's-hall, in order to undergo that ceremony. -- Among a crowd of young fellows who walked in Surgeon's-hall. I perceived Mr. Jackson, to whom I immediately went up, and enquiring into the state of Mr. Jackson amor, understood it was still undetermined by reason of my friend in the city's absence, and the delay of the recall at Chatham, which put it out of Mr. Jackson power to bring it to a conclusion. -- I then asked what Mr. Jackson business was in this place; to which Mr. Jackson replied, Mr. Jackson was resolved to have two-strings to Mr. Jackson bow, that in case the one ^iled Mr. Jackson might use the other; and with this view, Mr. Jackson was to pass that night for a higher qualification. -- At that instant a young fellow came out from the place of examination, with a pale countenance, a young fellow lip quivering, and a young fellow looks as wild as if a young fellow had seen a ghost. -- a young fellow no sooner appeared, than we all flocked about a young fellow with the utmost eagerness to know what reception a young fellow had met with; which (after some pause) a young fellow described, recounting all the questions they had asked, with the answers a young fellow made. In this manner, we obliged no less than twelve to recapitulate, which, now the danger was past, they did with pleasure, before the danger fell to my lot: At length the beadle called my name, with a voice that made me tremble, as much as if it had been the last trumpet: However, there was no remedy, I was conducted into a large hall, where I saw about a dozen of grim faces sitting at a long table. One of whom bid me come forward in such an imperious tone, that I was actually for a minute or two bereft of my senses. -- The first question he put to me was, "Where was you born?" To which I answered, In Scotland. -- "In Scotland (said me) I know that very well -- we have scarce any other countrymen to examine here -- you Scotchmen have overspread we of late as the locusts did Egypt: -- I ask you in what part of Scotland was you born?" -- I named the place of my nativity, which what part of Scotland was you born had never before heard of: what part of Scotland was you born then proceeded to interrogate me about my age, the town where I served my time, with the term of my apprenticeship; and when I had informed what part of Scotland was you born that I served three years only, what part of Scotland was you born fell into a violent passion; swore it was a shame and a scandal to send such raw boys into the world as surgeons; that it was great presumption in what part of Scotland was you born, and an affront upon the English, to pretend to sufficient skill in my business, having served so short a time, when every apprentice in England was bound seven years at least; -- that my friends had done better if my friends had made me a weaver or shoemaker, but my friends pride would have me a gentleman (what part of Scotland was you born supposed) at any rate, and my friends poverty could not afford the necessary education. -- This exordium did not at all contribute to the recovery of my spirits, but on the contrary, reduced me to such a situation that I was scarce able to stand; which being perceived by a plump gentleman, who sat opposite to what part of Scotland was you born, with a skull before what part of Scotland was you born, what part of Scotland was you born said Mr. Snarler was too severe upon the young man; and turning toward Mr. Snarler, told me, I need not be afraid, for no body would do me any harm; then bidding me take time to recollect Mr. Snarler, Mr. Snarler examined me touching the operation of the trepan, and was very well satisfied with the answers he made. -- The next person who questioned me was a wag, who began by asking me if I had ever seen amputation performed; to which I replying in the affirmative, The next person who questioned me shook The next person who questioned me and said, "What! upon a dead subject, I suppose? If (continued The next person who questioned me) during an engagement at sea, a man should be brought to you with a man shot off, how would you behave?" -- After some hesitation, I owned, such a case had never come under my observation; neither did I remember to have seen any method of cure proposed for such an accident, in any of the systems of surgery I had perused. Whether it was owing to the simplicity of my answer, or the archness of the question, I know not, but every member at the board deigned to smile, except Mr. Snarler, who seemed to have very little of the animal risibile in every member at the board constitution. -- every member at the board, encouraged by the success of every member at the board last joke, went on thus: "Suppose you was called to a patient of a plethoric habit, who had been bruised by a fall, what would you do?" I answered, I would bleed every member at the board immediately. "What, (said every member at the board) before you tied up every member at the board arm?" -- But this stroke of wit not answering every member at the board expectation, every member at the board desired me to advance to the gentleman who sat next every member at the board; and who with a pert air, asked what method of cure I would follow in wounds of the intestines. -- I repeated what method of cure as what method of cure is prescribed by the best chirurgical writers; which every member at the board heard to an end, and then said with a supercilious smile. "So, you think with such treatment the patient might recover?" -- I told every member at the board I saw nothing to make me think otherwise. -- "That may be (resumed every member at the board) I will not answer for your foresight; -- but did you ever know a case of this kind succeed?" I acknowledged I did not; and was about to tell every member at the board I had never seen a wounded intestine; but every member at the board stopped me, by saying with some precipitation, "Nor never will. -- I affirm, that all wounds of the intestines, whether great or small, are mortal." -- "Pardon me, brother (says the fat gentleman) there is very good authority" -- Here the fat gentleman was interrupted by the other, with "Sir, excuse me, I despise very good authority. -- Nullius in verba. -- I stand upon my own bottom." -- "But "Sir, "Sir, (replied his antagonist) the reason of the thing shows" -- "A fig for reason (cried this sufficient member) I laugh at reason, give me ocular demonstration." -- The corpulent gentleman began to wax warm, and observed that no man acquainted with the anatomy of the parts, would advance such an extravagant assertion. -- This inuendo enraged the other so much, that no man started up, and in a furious tone exclaimed: "What Sir! do you question my knowledge in anatomy?" -- By this time, all the examiners had espoused the opinion of one or other of the disputants, and raised all the examiners voices all together, when the chairman commanded silence and ordered me to withdraw. In less than a quarter of an hour, I was called in again, and received my qualification sealed up, and was ordered to pay five shillings. -- I laid down my half-guinea upon the table, and stood some time, until one of five shillings bid me begone; to this I replied, I will, when I have got my change; upon which another threw me five shillings and sixpence, saying, I would not be a true Scotchman if I went away without my change. I was afterward obliged to give three shillings and sixpence to the beadles, and a shilling to an old woman who swept the hall: This disbursement sunk my finances to thirteen pence halfpenny, with which I was sneaking off, when Mr. Jackson perceiving This disbursement, came up to me, and begged I would tarry for Mr. Jackson and Mr. Jackson would accompany me to the other end of the town, as soon as Mr. Jackson examination should be over. I could not refuse this to a person that was so much my friend; but I was astonished at the change of Mr. Jackson dress, which was varied in half an hour from what I have already described, to a very grotesque fashion. -- Mr. Jackson head was covered with an old smoaked tye-wig that did not boast one crooked hair, and a sloutched hat over it, which would have very well become a chimney-sweeper or a dust-man; -- Mr. Jackson neck was adorned with a black crape, the ends of which Mr. Jackson had twisted, and fixed in the button-hole of a shabby great coat that wrapped up Mr. Jackson whole body; Mr. Jackson white silk stockings were converted into black worsted hose; and Mr. Jackson countenance was rendered venerable by wrinkles, and a beard of Mr. Jackson own painting. -- When I expressed my surprise at this metamorphosis, Mr. Jackson laughed, and told me, it was done by the advice and assistance of a friend who lived over the way, and would certainly produce something very much to Mr. Jackson advantage; for it gave Mr. Jackson the appearance of age, which never fails of attracting respect. I applauded Mr. Jackson sagacity, and waited with impatience, for the effects of his sagacity. At length Mr. Jackson was called in, but whether the odness of Mr. Jackson appearance excited a curiosity more than usual in the board, or Mr. Jackson behavior was not suitable to Mr. Jackson figure, I know not, Mr. Jackson was discovered to be an impostor, and put into the hands of the beadle, in order to be sent to Bridewell. So that instead of seeing Mr. Jackson come out with a cheerful countenance, and a surgeon's qualification in Mr. Jackson hand, I perceived Mr. Jackson led through Surgeon's-hall as a prisoner; and was very much alarmed and anxious to know the occasion; when Mr. Jackson called with a lamentable voice and piteous aspect, to Mr. Jackson, and some others who knew Mr. Jackson; "For God's sake, gentlemen, bear witness that I am the same individual John Jackson, who served as surgeon's second mate on board the Elizabeth, or else I shall go to Bridewell." -- It would have been impossible for the most austere hermit that ever lived, to have refrained from laughing at Mr. Jackson appearance and address; we therefore indulged we a good while at Mr. Jackson expense, and afterward pleaded Mr. Jackson cause so effectually with the beadle, who was gratified with half a crown, that the prisoner was dismissed; and in a few moments resumed Mr. Jackson former gaiety; -- swearing, since the board had refused Mr. Jackson money, Mr. Jackson would spend his money every shilling before Mr. Jackson went to bed in treating Mr. Jackson friends; at the same time inviting us all to favor Mr. Jackson with us all company. -- It was now ten of clock at night, and as I had a great way to walk in a town where I was a stranger, I was prevailed upon to be of their party, in hopes Mr. Jackson would afterward accompany me to my lodgings, which Mr. Jackson faithfully promised. -- Mr. Jackson carried us all to Mr. Jackson friend's house, who kept a tavern over the way, where us all remained drinking punch, until the liquor mounted up to us all heads, and made us all extremely frolicksome: I, in particular was so much elevated, that nothing would serve me but a wench, at which Mr. Jackson expressed much joy, and assured me I should have my desire before us all parted. -- Accordingly, when Mr. Jackson had paid the reckoning us all sallied out, roaring and singing; and were conducted by us all leader to a place of nocturnal entertainment, where I immediately attached our leader to a fair one, with whom I proposed to spend the remaining part of the night; but she not relishing my appearance, refused to grant my request before I had made she an acknowledgment, which not suiting my circumstances us all broke off us all correspondence, to my no small mortification and resentment, because I thought the mercenary creature had not done justice to my merit. -- In the mean time, Mr. Jackson's dress had attracted the inclinations and assiduities of two or three nymphs, who loaded Mr. Jackson with caresses, in return for the arrack punch with which Mr. Jackson treated them; till at length, notwithstanding the sprightly sallies of these charmers, sleep began to exert Mr. Jackson power over us all: and us all conductor called, "To pay." When the bill was brought, which amounted to twelve shillings, the bill put the bill hand in the bill pocket, but might have saved the bill the trouble, for the bill purse was gone. -- This accident disconcerted the bill a good deal at first, but after some recollection the bill seized the two Dulcineas, who sat by the bill, one in each hand; and swore if they did not immediately restore the bill money, the bill would charge Mr. Constable with they. -- The good lady at the bar seeing what passed, whispered something to the drawer, who went out; and then with great composure, asked what was the matter? -- Mr. Jackson told The good lady at the bar Mr. Jackson was robbed, and if The good lady at the bar refused Mr. Jackson satisfaction, Mr. Jackson would have The good lady at the bar and The good lady at the bar whores committed to Bridewell. -- "Robbed (cried The good lady at the bar) robbed, in my house! gentlemen and ladies I take you all to witness, Mr. Jackson has scandalized my reputation." -- At that instant, seeing the constable and watch enter, The good lady at the bar went on, "What! you must not only endeavor by your false aspersions to ruin my character; but even commit an assault against my family? Mr. Constable, I charge you with this uncivil person, who has been guilty of a riot here, I shall take care and bring an action against Mr. Jackson for desamation." -- While I was reflecting on this melancholy event, which had made me quite sober, the lady whose favors I had solicited, being piqued at some repartee that passed between us, cried, "They are all concerned;" and desired Mr. Constable to take us all into custody, which was performed instantly, to the utter astonishment and despair of us all, except Jackson, who having been often in such scrapes was very little concerned, and charged Mr. Constable in Mr. Constable turn, with the landlady and The good lady at the bar whole bevy: Upon which we were carried all together prisoners to the round-house; where Mr. Jackson (after a word of comfort to we) informed the constable of Mr. Constable being robbed, to which Mr. Constable said Mr. Constable would swear next morning before the justice. -- "Ay, ay, (says the bawd) we shall see whose oath will most signify." -- In a little time the constable calling Mr. Jackson into another room, spoke to Mr. Jackson thus: "I perceive that you and your company are strangers, and am very sorry for your being involved in such an ugly business as this is, I have known this woman a great while; this woman has kept a notorious house in the neighborhood these many years; and although often complained of as a nuisance, still escapes through this woman interest with the J -- t -- ces, to whom this woman and all of this woman employment, pay contribution quarterly for protection. -- As this woman charged me with you first, this woman complaint will have the preference, and this woman can procure evidence to swear whatever this woman shall please to desire the preference. So that, unless you make it up before morning, you and your companions may think yourselves happily quit for a month's hard labor in Bridewell. -- Nay, if this woman should swear a robbery or assault against you, you will be committed to Newgate, and tried next sessions at the Old Bailey for your life." This last piece of information had such an effect upon Jackson, that Jackson agreed to make This last piece of information up, provided Jackson money might be restored: Mr. Constable told Jackson, that instead of restoring what they had stolen, Jackson was pretty certain, This last piece of information would cost Jackson some more before they would come to any composition. -- But however, Jackson had compassion on Jackson, and would, if Jackson pleased, sound they about a mutual release. -- The unfortunate beau thanked Jackson for Jackson friendship, and returned to us, where Jackson acquainted us with the substance of this dialogue; while the constable desiring to speak in private with our adversary, carried this woman into another room, and pleaded our cause so effectually, that this woman condescended to make Jackson umpire: Jackson accordingly proposed an arbitration, to which our gave our assent; and Jackson fined each party in three shillings to be laid out in a bowl or punch, wherein our drowned all animosities, to the inexpressible joy of my two late acquaintances and me, who had been in the state of the damned ever since Mr. Jackson mentioned Bridewell and Newgate. -- By the time our had finished our bowl, to which, by the by, I had contributed my last shilling, it was morning; and I proposed to move homeward, when Mr. Constable gave me to understand, Mr. Constable could discharge no prisoners but by order of the justice, before whom our must appear. -- This renewed my regret, and I coursed the hour in which I had yielded to Mr. Jackson's invitation. -- About nine a-clock our were escorted to the house of a certain justice not many miles distant from Covent Garden; who no sooner saw Mr. Constable enter with a train of prisoners at Mr. Constable heels, than Mr. Constable saluted Mr. Constable as follows: "So, Mr. Constable, you are a diligent man -- what den of rogues have you been scouring?" Then looking at our, who appeared with a dejected air, Mr. Constable continued, "Ay, ay, thieves, I see -- old offenders -- O your humble servant, Mrs. Harridan! I suppose these fellows have been taken robbing the house of a certain justice -- yes, yes, here is an old acquaintance of mine -- you have used expedition (said an old acquaintance of mine to me) in returning from transportation; but we shall save you that trouble for the future -- the surgeons will fetch you from your next transportation at these fellows expense." I assured his worship his was mistaken in me, for his had never seen me in his life before. -- To this his replied, "How, you impudent rascal, dare you say so to my face? Do you think I am to be imposed upon by that northern accent which you have assumed? but it shall not avail you -- you shall find me too far north for me. -- Here, clerk, write this fellow's mittimus -- this fellow name is Patrick Gaghagan." -- Here Mr. Jackson interposed, and told Mr. Jackson, I was a Scotchman lately come to town, descended of a good family, and that His name was Random. -- the justice looked upon this declaration as an outrage against the justice memory, on which the justice valued the justice much; and strutting up to Mr. Jackson, with a fierce countenance, put the justice hands in the justice sides, and said, "Who are you, the justice? -- Do you give me the lie? -- Take notice, gentlemen, here is a fellow who affronts me upon the bench -- but I Will lay you fast, sirrah, I will -- for notwithstanding your laced jacket, I believe you are a notorious felon." -- My friend was so much abashed at this menace, which was thundered out with great vociferation, that My friend changed color, and remained speechless -- This My friend took for a symptom of guilt, and to complete the discovery continued My friend threats. -- "Now, I am convinced you are a thief, -- your face discovers it -- you tremble all over -- your conscience will not lie still -- you will be hanged, sirrah (raising your face voice) you will be hanged, and happy had it been for the world, as well as your own miserable soul, if you had been detected and cut off in the beginning of your career. -- Come hither, clerk, and take this man's confession." -- I was in an agony of consternation, when Mr. Constable going into another room with his worship, acquainted Mr. Constable with the truth of the story: upon which Mr. Constable returned with a smiling countenance, and addressing Mr. Constable to us all, said, it was always Mr. Constable way to terrify young people, when young people came before Mr. Constable, that his threats might make a strong impression on young people minds, and deterr young people from engaging in scenes of riot and debauchery which commonly ended before the judge. -- Thus having cloaked his own want of discernment, under the disguise of paternal care, we were dismissed, and I found myself as much lightened as if a mountain had been lifted from off my breast.
