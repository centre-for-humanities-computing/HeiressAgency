those who hung on the inside toward the sides of the ship, in order to assist them, as they seemed barricadoed by those who lay on the outside, and entirely out of the reach of all visitation. -- Much less could I conjecture how my friend Thomson would be able to administer clysters, that were ordered for some in that situation. -- When I saw him thrust his wig in his pocket, and strip himself to his waistcoat in a moment, then creep on all fours, under the hammocks of the sick, and forcing up his bare pate between two, kept them asunder with one shoulder, until he had done his duty. -- Eager to learn the service, I desired he would give me leave to perform the next operation of that kind; he consenting, I undressed myself after his example, and crawling along, the ship happened to roll, which alarmed me; I laid hold of the first thing that came within my grasp, with such violence, that I overturned it, and soon found by the smell that issued upon me, I had not unlocked a box of the most delicious perfume; it was well for me that my nostrils was none of the most delicate, else I know not how I might have been affected by this vapor, which diffused itself all over the ship to the utter discomposure of every body who tarried on the same deck; -- neither was the consequence of this disgrace confined to my sense of smelling only, for I felt my misfortune more ways than one. That I might not, however, appear altogether disconcerted in this my coup d'essai, I got up, and pushing my head with great force between two hammocks, toward the middle, where the greatest resistance was, I made an opening indeed, but not understanding the knack of dexterously turning my shoulder to maintain my advantage, I had the mortification to find myself stuck up as it were in a pillory, and the weight of three or four people bearing on each side of my neck, so that I was in danger of strangulation. -- While I remained in this defenseless posture, one of the sick men, rendered peevish by his distemper, was so enraged at the smell I had occasioned, and the rude shock he had received from me in my elevation, that with many bitter reproaches, he seized me by the nose, which he tweaked so unmercifully that I roared with anguish. Thomson perceiving my condition, ordered one of the waiters to my assistance, who with much difficulty disengaged me from this embarras, and hindered me from taking vengeance of the sick man, whose indisposition would not have screened him from the effects of my indignation.  After having made an end of our ministry for that time, we descended to the cockpit, my friend comforting me for what had happened, with a homely proverb, which I do not choose to repeat. -- When we had got half way down the ladder, Mr. Morgan, before he saw us, having intelligence by his nose, of the approach of something extraordinary, cried, "Cot have mercy upon my senses! I pelieve the enemy has poarded us in a stink-pot!" Then directing his discourse to the steward, from whom he imagined the odor proceeded, he reprimanded him severely for the freedoms he took among gentlemen of birth, threatened to smoke him like a padger with sulphur, if ever he should presume to offend his neighbors with such smells, for the future: The steward, conscious of his own innocence, replied with some warmth, "I know of no smells but those of your own making." -- This repartee introduced a smart dialogue, in which the Welchman undertook to prove, that though the stench he complained of, did not flow from the steward's own body, he was nevertheless the author of it, by serving out damaged provisions to the ship's company; and in particular, putrified cheese, from the use of which only, he affirmed, such unsavory steams could arise. -- Then he launched cut into praises of good cheese, of which he gave the analysis; explained the different kinds of that commodity, with the methods practiced to make and preserve it; and concluded with observing, that in yielding good cheese, the county of Glamorgan might vie with Cheshire itself, and was much superior to it in the produce of goats and putter. -- I gathered from this conversation, that if I went into the birth in my present pickle, I should be no welcome guest, and therefore desired Mr. Thomson to go before, and represent my calamity; at which the first mate expressing some concern, went upon deck immediately, taking his way through the cable tire, and by the main hatchway, to avoid encountering with me; desiring me to clean myself as soon as possible, for he intended to regale himself with a dish of salmagundy and a pipe. -- Accordingly, I set about this disagreeable business, and soon found I had more causes of complaint than I at first imagined: For I perceived some guests had honored me with their company, whose visit I did not at all think seasonable; neither did they seem inclined to leave me in a hurry, being in possession of my chief quarters, where they fed without reserve at the expense of my blood. -- But considering it would be much easier to extirpate this ferocious colony in the infancy of their settlement, than after they should be multiplied and naturalized to the soil, I took the advice of my friend, who, to prevent such misfortunes, went always closs shaved, and made the boy of our mess cut off my hair, which had been growing since I lest the service of Lavement. The second mate lent me an old bob wig to supply the loss of that covering. This affair being ended, and every thing adjusted in the best manner my circumstances would permit, the descendant of Caractacus returned, and ordering the boy to bring a piece of salt beef from the brine, cut off a slice and mixed it with an equal quantity of onions, which seasoning with a moderate proportion of pepper and salt, he brought it into a consistence with oil and vinegar. -- Then tasting the dish, assured us, it was the best salmagundie, that ever he made, and recommended it to our palate with such heartiness, that I could not help doing honor to his preparation. But I had no sooner swallowed a mouthful, than I thought my entrails were scorched, and endeavored with a deluge of small beer, to allay the heat it occasioned. -- Supper being over, Mr. Morgan having smoaked a couple of pipes, and supplied the moisture he had expended with as many cans of flip, of which we all partook, a certain yawning began to admonish me, that it was high time to repair by sleep the injury I had suffered from want of rest the preceding night; which being perceived by my companions, whose time of repose was by this time arrived, they proposed we should turn in, or in other words, go to bed. Our hammocks, which hung parallel to one another, on the outside of our birth, were immediately unlashed, and I beheld each of my mess-mates spring with great agility into his respective nest, where they seemed to lie concealed, very much at their ease. -- But it was some time before I could prevail upon myself to trust my carcass at such a distance from the ground, in a narrow bag, out of which, I imagined, I should be apt, on the least motion in my sleep, to tumble down at the hazard of breaking my bones. I suffered myself, however, to be persuaded, and taking a leap to get in, threw myself quite over, with such violence, that had I not luckily got hold of Thomson's hammock, I should have pitched upon my head on the other side, and in all likelihood fractured my scull. -- After some fruitless efforts, I succeeded at last; but the apprehension of the jeopardy in which I believed myself, withstood all the attacks of sleep, till toward the morningwatch, when in spite of my fears, I was overpowered with slumber: though I did not long enjoy this comfortable situation; being arroused with a noise so loud and shrill, that I thought the drums of my ears were burst by it; this was followed by a dreadful summons pronounced by a hoarse voice, which I could not understand. While I was debating with myself whether or not I should wake my companion, and enquire into the occasion of this disturbance, I was informed by one of the quarter masters, who passed by me with a lanthorn in his hand, that the noise which alarmed me, was occasioned by the boatswain's mates who called up the larboard watch, and that I must lay my account with such interruption every morning at the same hour. -- Being now more assured of of my safety, I addressed myself again to rest, and slept till eight a-clock, when getting up, and breakfasting with my comrades, on biscuit and brandy, the sick were visited and assisted as before; after which my good friend Thomson explained and performed another piece of duty, to which I was a stranger. -- At a certain hour in the morning, the boy of the mess went round all the decks, ringing a small hand-bell, and in rhimes composed for the occasion, inviting all those who had sores to repair before the mast, where one of the doctor's mates attended, with applications to dress them.  CHAP. XXVII. I acquire the friendship of the surgeon, who procures a warrant for me, and makes me a present of clothes -- a battle between a midshipman and me -- the surgeon leaves the ship -- the captain comes on board with another surgeon -- a dialogue between the captain and Morgan -- the sick are ordered to be brought upon the quarter deck and examined -- the consequences of that order -- a madman accuses Morgan, and is set at liberty by command of the captain, whom he instantly attacks and pummels without mercy.  WHILE I was busied with my friend in this practice, the doctor chanced to pass by the place where we were, and stopping to observe me, appeared very well satisfied with my method of application; and afterward sent for me to his cabin, where, having examined me touching my skill in surgery, and the particulars of my fortune, interested himself so far in my behalf, as to promise his assistance in procuring a warrant for me, seeing I had been already found qualified at Surgeon's hall, for the station I now filled on board; and this he the more cordially engaged in, when he understood I was nephew to lieutenant Bowlin^ for whom he expressed a particular regard. -- In the mean time, I could learn from his discourse, that he did not intend to go to sea again with captain Oakhum, having, as he thought, been indifferently used by him during the last voyage.  While I lived tollerably easy, in expectation of preferment, I was not altogether without mortifications, which I not only suffered from the rude insults of the sailors, and petty officers, among whom I was known by the name of Loblolly Boy; but also from the disposition of Morgan, who, though friendly in the main, was often very troublesome with his pride, which expected a good deal of submission from me, and delighted in recapitulating the favors I had received at his hands.  About six weeks after my arrival on board, the surgeon bidding me follow him into his cabin, presented a warrant to me, by which I was appointed surgeon's third mate on board the Thunder. -- This he had procured by his interest at the Navy-office; as also another for himself, by virtue of which he was removed into a second rate. I acknowledged his kindness in the strongest terms my gratitude could suggest, and professed my sorrow at the prospect of losing such a valuable friend, to whom I hoped to have recommended myself still further, by my respectful and diligent behavior. -- But his generosity rested not here; -- for, before he left the ship, he made me a present of a chest and some clothes, that enabled me to support the rank to which he had raised me. -- I found my spirit revive with my good fortune; and now I was an officer, resolved to maintain the dignity of my station, against all opposition or affronts; nor was it long before I had occasion to exert my resolution; my old enemy the midshipman (whose name was Crampley) entertaining an implacable animosity against me, for the disgrace he had suffered on my account, had since that time taken all opportunities of reviling and ridiculing me, when I was not entitled to retort his bad usage. -- And even after I had been rated on the books, and mustered as surgeon's mate, did not think fit to restrain his insolence. -- In particular, being one day present, while I dressed a wound in a sailor's leg, he began to sing a song, which I thought highly injurious to the honor of my country, and therefore signified my resentment, by observing, that the Scots always laid their account in finding enemies among the ignorant, insignificant and malicious. -- This unexpected piece of assurance enraged him to such a degree, that he lent me a blow on the face, which I verily thought had demolished my cheekbone; I was not slow in returning the obligation, and the affair began to be very serious, when by accident Mr. Morgan, and one of the master's mates, coming that way, interposed, and inquiring into the cause, endeavored to promote a reconciliation; but finding us both exasperated to the uttermost, and bent against accommodation, they advised us, either to leave our difference undecided till we should have an opportunity of terminating it on shore, like gentlemen, or else choose a proper place on board, and bring it to an issue by boxing. This last expedient was greedily embraced; and being forthwith conducted to the ground proposed, we stripped in a moment, and began a very furious contest, in which I soon found myself inferior to my antagonist, not so much in strength and agility, as in skill, which he had acquired in the school at Hockley in the Hole and Tottenham-Court. -- Many cross-buttocks did I sustain, and pegs on the stomach without number, till at last, my breath being quite gone, as well as my vigor wasted, I grew desperate, and collecting all my spirits in one effort, threw in at once head, hands, and feet with such violence, that I drove my antagonist three paces backward into the main hatch-way, down which he fell, and pitching upon his head and right shoulder, remained without sense and motion. -- Morgan looking down, and seeing him lie in that condition, cried, "Upon my conscience, as I am a Christian sinner (look you) I believe his pattles are all ofer; but I take you all to witness that there was no treachery in the case, and that he has suffered by the chance of war." -- So saying, he descended to the deck below, to examine into the situation of my adversary; and left me very little pleased with my victory, as I found myself not only terribly bruised, but likewise in danger of being called to account for the death of Crampley: But this fear vanished when my fellow-mate, having by bleeding him in the juglar, brought him to himself, and assured himself of the state of his body, called up to me, to be under no concern, for the midshipman had received no other damage than as pretty a luxation of the os humeri, as one would desire to see on a summer's day. -- Upon this information, I crawled down to the cockpit, and acquainted Thomson with the affair, who, providing himself with bandages, etc. necessary for the occasion, went up to assist Mr. Morgan in the reduction of the dislocation. -- When this was successfully performed, they wished me joy of the event of the combat; and the Welchman, after observing, that in all likelihood, the ancient Scots and Britons were the same people, bid me "Praise Cot for putting mettle in my pelly, and strength in my limbs to support it." -- I acquired such reputation by this recounter (which lasted twenty minutes) that every body became more cautious of his behavior toward me; though Crampley with his arm in a sling, talked very high, and threatened to seize the first opportunity of retrieving on shore, the honor he had lost by an accident, from which I could justly claim no merit.  About this time, captain Oakhum, having received sailing orders, came on board, and brought along with him a surgeon of his own country, who soon made us sensible of the loss we suffered in the departure of doctor Atkins; being grossly ignorant, and intolerably assuming, false, vindictive, and unforgiving; a merciless tyrant to his inferiors, an abject sycophant to those above him. In the morning after the captain came on board, our first mate, according to custom, went to wait on him with a sick list, which when this grim commander had perused, he cried with a stern countenance, "Blood and oons! sixty-one sick people on board of my ship! -- Harkee you, sir, I Will have no sick in my ship, by G -- d." The Welchman replied, he should be very glad to find no sick people on board; but while it was otherwise, he did no more than his duty in presenting him with a list. -- "You and your list may be d -- n'd, (said the captain, throwing it at him) I say, there shall be no sick in this ship while I have the command of her." -- Mr. Morgan being nettled at this treatment, told him, his indignation ought to be directed to Got Almighty, who visited his people with distempers, and not to him, who contributed all in his power toward their cure. The Bashaw not being used to such behavior in any of his officers, was enraged to fury at this satirical insinuation, and stamping with his foot, called him insolent scoundrel, threatening to have him pinioned to the deck, if he should presume to utter another syllable. But the blood of Caractacus being thoroughly heated, disdained to be restricted by such a command, and began to manifest itself in, "Captain Oakoum, I am a shentleman of birth and parentage (look you) and peradventure, I am moreover --." Here his harrangue was broke off by the captain's steward, who being Morgan's countryman, hurried him out of the cabin before he had time to exasperate his master to a greater degree, which would certainly have been the case; for the indignant Welchman, could hardly be hindered by his friend's arguments and entreaties, from reentering the presence chamber, and defying captain Oakhum to his teeth. -- He was, however, appeased at length, and came down to the birth, where finding Thomson and me at work preparing medicines, he bid us leave off our lapour and go to play, for the captain, by his sole word and power and command, had driven sickness a pegging to the tevil, and there was no more malady on poard. So saying, he drank off a gill of brandy, sighed grievously three times, poured forth an ejaculation of "Got pless my heart, liver, and lungs!" and then began to sing a Welsh song with great earnestness of visage, voice and gesture. -- I could not conceive the meaning of this singular phenomenon, and saw by the looks of Thomson, who at the same time, shook his head, that he suspected poor Cadwallader's brains were unsettled. He perceiving our amazement, told us, he would explain the mystery; but at the same time, bid us take notice, that he had lived poy, patchelor, married man and widower, almost forty years, and in all that time, there was no man nor mother's son in the whole world, who durst use him so ill as captain Oakhum had done. Then he acquainted us with the dialogue that passed between them, as I have already related it; and had no sooner finished this narration, than he received a message from the surgeon, to bring the sick-list to the quarter deck, for the captain had ordered all the patients thither to be reviewed. -- This inhuman order shocked us extremely, as we knew it would be impossible to carry some of them on the deck, without imminent danger of their lives; but as we likewise knew it would be to no purpose for us to remonstrate against it, we repaired to the quarter deck in a body, to see this extraordinary muster; Morgan observing by the way, that the captain was going to send to the other world, a great many evidences to testify against himself. -- When we appeared upon deck, the captain bid the doctor, who stood bowing at his right hand, look at these lazy, lubberly sons of bitches, who were good for nothing on board, but to eat the king's provision, and encourage idleness in the skulkers. -- The surgeon grinned approbation, and taking the list, began to examine the complaints of each as they could crawl to the place appointed. -- The first who came under his cognizance, was a poor fellow just freed of a fever, which had weakened him so much, that he could hardly stand. -- Mr. Mackshane (for that was the doctor's name) having felt his pulse, protested he was as well as any man in the world; and the captain delivered him over to the boatswain's mate, with orders that he should receive a round dozen at the gangway immediately, for counterfeiting himself sick when he was not; -- but before the discipline could be executed, the man dropped down on the deck, and had well nigh perished under the hands of the executioner. -- The next patient to be considered, labored under a quartan ague, and being then, in his interval of health, discovered no other symptoms of distemper, than a pale meagre countenance, and emaciated body; upon which, he was declared fit for duty, and turned over to the boatswain; -- but being resolved to disgrace the doctor, died upon the forecastle next day, during his cold fit. -- The third complained of a pleuretic stitch, and spitting of blood, for which doctor Mackshane prescribed exercise at the pump to promote expectoration; but whether this was improper for one in his situation, or that it was used to excess, I know not, but in less than half an hour, he was suffocated with a deluge of blood that issued from his lungs. -- A fourth, with much difficulty climbed to the quarter deck, being loaded with a monstrous ascites or dropsy, that invaded his chest so much, he could scarce fetch his breath; but his disease being interpreted into fat, occasioned by idleness and excess of eating, he was ordered, with a view to promote perspiration and enlarge his chest, to go aloft immediately: It was in vain for this unwieldy wretch, to allege his utter incapacity, the boatswain's driver was commanded to whip him up with a cat and nine tails: The smart of this application made him exert himself so much, that he actually arrived at the foot-hook-shrouds, but when the enormous weight of his body had nothing else to support it than his weakened arms, either out of spite or necessity, he quitted his hold, and plumped into the sea, where he must have been drowned, had not a sailor who was in a boat along-side, saved his life, by keeping him afloat, till he was hoisted on board by a tackle -- It would be tedious and disagreeable to describe the fate of every miserable object that suffered by the inhumanity and ignorance of the captain and surgeon, who so wantonly sacrificed the lives of their fellow creatures. Many were brought up in the height of fevers, and rendered delirious by the injuries they suffered in the way. -- Some gave up the ghost in the presence of their inspectors; and others, who were ordered to their duty, languished a few days at work, among their fellows, and then departed without any ceremony. -- On the whole, the number of sick was reduced to less than a dozen; and the authors of this reduction were applauding themselves for the service they had done to their king and country, when the boatswain's mate informed his honor, that there was a man below lashed to his hammock by the direction of the doctor's mate, and that he begged hard to be released; affirming, he had been so maltreated only for a grudge Mr. Morgan bore to him, and that he was as much in his senses as any man aboard. -- The captain hearing this, darted a severe look at the Welchman, and ordered the man to be brought up immediately: Upon which, Morgan protested with great fervency, that the person in question was as mad as a March-hare; and begged for the the love of Got, they would at least keep his arms pinioned during his examination, to prevent him from doing mischief. -- This request the commander granted for his own sake, and the patient was produced, who insisted upon his being in his right wits with such calmness and strength of argument, that every body present was inclined to believe him, except Morgan, who affirmed there was no trusting to appearances; for he himself had been so much imposed upon by his behavior two days before, that he had actually unbound him with his own hands, and had well nigh been murdered for his pains: this was confirmed by the evidence of one of the waiters, who declared, he had pulled this patient from the doctor's mate, whom he had gotten down and almost strangled. -- To this the man answered, that the witness was a creature of Morgan's, and was suborned to give his testimony against him by the malice of the mate, whom the defendant had affronted, by discovering to the people on board, that Mr. Morgan's wife kept a gin-shop in Rag-Fair. -- This anecdote produced a laugh at the expense of the Welchman, who shaking his head with some emotion, said, "Ay, ay, it is no matter. -- Got knows, it is an arrant falsehood." -- Captain Oakhum, without any further hesitation, ordered the fellow to be unfettered; at the same time, threatening to make Morgan exchange situations with him for his spite; but the Briton no sooner heard the decision in favor of the madman, than he got up the mizzen-shrouds, crying to Thomson and me to get out of his reach, for we should see him play the tevil with a vengeance. We did not think fit to disregard this caution, and accordingly got up on the poop, whence we beheld the maniac (as soon as he was released) fly at the captain like a fury, crying, "I Will let you know, you scoundrel, that I am commander of this vessel" -- and pummel him without mercy. The surgeon, who went to the assistance of his patron, shared the same fate; and it was with the utmost difficulty, that he was mastered at last, after having done great execution among those who opposed him.  CHAP. XXVIII. The captain enraged, threatens to put the madman to death with his own hand -- is diverted from that resolution by the arguments and persuasion of the first lieutenant and surgeon -- we set sail for St. Helens, join the fleet under the command of Sir C -- n -- r O -- le, and proceed for the West Indies -- are overtaken by a terrible tempest -- my friend Jack Rattlin has his leg broke by a fall from the main-yard -- the behavior of doctor Mackshane -- Jack opposes the amputation of his limb, in which he is seconded by Morgan and me, who undertake the cure, and perform it successfully.  THE captain was carried into his cabin, so enraged with the treatment he had received, that he ordered the sellow to be brought before him, that he might have the pleasure of pistoling him with his own hand; and would certainly have satisfied his revenge in this manner, had not the first lieutenant remonstrated against it, by observing that in all appearance, the fellow was not mad but desperate; that he had been hired by some enemy of the captain to assassinate him, and therefore ought to be kept in irons till he could be brought to a court martial, which, no doubt, would sift the affair to the bottom, by which, important discoveries might be made, and then sentence the criminal to a death adequate to his demerits. -- This suggestion, improbable as it was, had the desired effect upon the captain, being exactly calculated for the meridian of his intellects; more especially, as doctor Mackshane espoused this opinion, in consequence of his previous declaration that the man was not mad. -- Morgan finding there was no more damage done, could not help discovering by his countenance, the pleasure he enjoyed on this occasion; and while he bathed the doctor's face with an embrocation, ventured to ask him, Whether he thought there were more fools or madmen on board? But he would have been wiser in containing this sally, which his patient carefully laid up in his memory, to be taken notice of at a more fit season. -- Mean while we weighed anchor, and on our way to the Downs, the madman, who was treated as a prisoner, took an opportunity, while the sentinel attended him at the head, to leap overboard, and frustrate the revenge of the captain. -- We staid not long at the downs, but took the benefit of the first easterly wind to go round to Spithead; where having received on board provisions for six months, we sailed from St. Helens, in the grand fleet bound for the West Indies on the ever memorable expedition of Carthagena.  It was not without great mortification, I saw myself on the point of being transported to such a distant and unhealthy climate, destitute of every convenience that could render such a voyage supportable; and under the dominion of an arbitrary tyrant, whose command was almost intolerable: However, as these complaints were common to a great many on board, I resolved to submit patiently to my fate, and contrive to make myself as easy as the nature of the case would allow. -- We got out of the channel with a prosperous breeze, which died away, leaving us becalmed about fifty leagues to the westward of the Lizard: But this state of inaction did not last long; for next night our main-top-sail was split by the wind, which in the morning increased to a hurricane. -- I was wakened by a most horrible din, occasioned by the play of the gun carriages upon the decks above, the creaking of cabins, the howling of the wind through the shrouds, the confused noise of the ship's crew, the pipes of the boatswain and his mates, the trumpets of the lieutenants, and the clanking of the chainpumps. -- Morgan, who had never been at sea before, turned out in a great hurry, crying, "Got have mercy and compassion upon us! I believe we have got upon the confines of Lucifer and the d -- ned!" -- while poor Thomson lay quaking in his hammock, putting up petitions to heaven for our safety. -- I got out of bed and joined the Welchman, with whom (after having fortified ourselves with brandy) I went above; but if my sense of hearing was startled before, how must my sight be appalled in beholding the effects of the storm? The sea was swelled into billows mountain-high, on the top of which our ship sometimes hung, as if it was about to be precipitated to the abyss below! Sometimes we sunk between two waves that rose on each side higher than our topmast head, and threatened by dashing together, to overwhelm us in a moment! Of all our fleet, consisting of a hundred and fifty sail, scarce twelve appeared, and these driving under their bare poles, at the mercy of the tempest. At length the masts of one of them gave way, and tumbled overboard with a hideous crash! Nor was the prospect in our own ship much more agreeable; -- a number of officers and sailors run backward and forward with distraction in their looks, hollowing to one another, and unknowing what they should attend to first. Some clung to the yards, endeavoring to unbend the sails that were split into a thousand pieces flapping in the wind; others tried to furl those which were yet whole, while the masts, at every pitch, bent and quivered like twigs, as if they would have shivered into innumerable splinters! -- While I considered this scene with equal terror and astonishment, one of the main-braces broke, by the shock whereof two sailors were flung from the yard's arm into the sea, where they perished, and poor Jack Rattlin thrown down upon the deck, at the expense of a broken leg. Morgan and I ran immediately to his assistance, and found a splinter of the shin-bone thrust by the violence of the fall through the skin: As this was a case of too great consequence to be treated without the authority of the doctor, I went down to his cabin, to inform him of the accident, as well as to bring up dressings, which we always kept ready prepared. -- I entered his apartment without any ceremony, and by the glimmering of a lamp, perceived him on his knees, before something that very much resembled a crucifix; but this I will not insist upon, that I may not seem too much a slave to common report, which indeed assisted my conjecture on this occasion, by representing doctor Mackshane as a member of the church of Rome. -- Be this as it will, he got up in a sort of confusion, occasioned (I suppose) by his being disturbed in his devotion, and in a trice, snatched the object of my suspicion from my sight. -- After making an apology for my intrusion, I acquainted him with the situation of Rattlin, but could by no means prevail upon him to visit him on deck where he lay; he bid me desire the boatswain to order some of the men to carry him down to the cockpit, and in the mean time he would direct Thomson in getting ready the dressings. -- When I signified to the boatswain the doctor's desire, he swore a terrible oath, that he could not spare one man from the deck, because he expected the masts would go by the board every minute. -- This piece of information did not at all contribute to my peace of mind; however, as my friend Rattlin complained very much, with the assistance of Morgan, I supported him to the lower deck, whither Mr. Mackshane, after much entreaty, ventured to come, attended by Thomson with a boxful of dressings, and his own servant, who carried a whole set of capital instruments. -- He examined the fracture and the wound, and concluding from a livid color extending itself upon the limb, that a mortification would ensue, resolved to amputate the leg immediately. -- This was a dreadful sentence to the patient, who recruiting himself with a quid of tobacco, pronounced with a woeful countenance, "What! is there no remedy, doctor? must I be dock'd? cannot you splice it?" -- "Assuredly, doctor Mackshane (said the first mate) with submission, and deference, and veneration to your superior abilities, and opportunities, and stations (look you) I do apprehend, and conjecture, and aver, that there is no occasion nor necessity to smite off this poor man's leg." -- "God almighty bless you, dear Welchman! (cried Rattlin) may you have fair wind and weather wheresoever you're bound, and come to an anchor in the road of heaven at last." -- Mackshane, very much incensed at his mate's differing in opinion from him so openly, answered, that he was not bound to give an account of his practice to him; and in a peremptory tone, ordered him to apply the tourniquet. -- At the sight of which, Jack starting up, cried, "Avast, avast! d -- n my heart, if you clap your nippers on me, till I know wherefore! -- Mr. Random, will not you lend a hand toward saving of my precious limb? Odd's heart, if lieutenant Bowling was here, he would not suffer Jack Rattlin's leg to be be chopped off like a piece of old junk." -- This pathetic address to me, joined to my inclination to serve my honest friend, and the reasons I had to believe there was no danger in delaying the amputation, induced me to declare myself of the first mate's opinion, and affirm that the preternatural color of the skin, was owing to an inflammation occasioned by a contusion, and common in all such cases, without any indication of an approaching gangrene. Morgan, who had a great opinion of my skill, manifestly exulted in my fellowship, and asked Thomson's sentiments of the matter, in hopes of strengthening our association with him too; but he being of a meek disposition, and either dreading the enmity of the surgeon, or speaking the dictates of his own judgment, in a modest manner, espoused the opinion of Mackshane, who by this time, having consulted with himself, determined to act in such a manner, as to screen himself from censure; and at the same time revenge himself on us, for our arrogance in contradicting him. -- With this view, he demanded to know if we would undertake to cure the leg at our peril; that is, be answerable for the consequence. -- To this Morgan replied, that the lives of his creatures are in the hands of Got alone; and it would be great presumption in him to undertake for an event that was in the power of his maker, no more than the doctor could promise to cure all the sick to whom he administered his assistance; but if the patient would put himself under our direction, we would do our endeavor to bring his distemper to a savourable issue, to which, at present, we saw no obstruction. -- I signified my concurrence; and Rattlin was so over-joyed, that shaking us both by the hands, he swore no body else should touch him, and if he died, his blood should be upon his own head. -- Mr. Mackshane, flattering himself with the prospect of our miscarriage, went away, and left us to manage it as we should think proper; accordingly, having sawed off part of the splinter that stuck through the skin, we reduced the fracture, dressed the wound, applied the eighteen-tailed bandage, and put the leg in a box, secundum artem. -- Every thing succeeded according to our wish, and we had the satisfaction, of not only preserving the poor fellow's leg, but likewise of rendering the doctor contemptible among the ship's company, who had all their eyes on us during the course of this cure, which was completed in six weeks.  CHAP. XXIX. Mackshane's malice -- I am taken up and imprisoned for a spy -- Morgan meets with the same fate -- Thomson is tempered with to turn evidence against us -- disdains the proposal, and is maltreated for his integrity -- Morgan is released to assist the surgeon during an engagement with some French ships of war -- I remain fettered on the poop, exposed to the enemy's shot, and grow delirious with fear -- am comforted after the battle by Morgan, who speaks freely of the captain; is overheard by the sentinel, who informs against him, and again imprisoned -- Thomson grows desperate, and notwithstanding the remonstrances of Morgan and me, goes overboard in the night.  IN the mean time, the storm subsided into a brisk gale, that carried us into the warm latitudes, where the weather became intolerable and the crew very sickly. -- The doctor left nothing unattempted toward the completion of his vengeance against the Welchman and me. He went among the sick under pretense of enquiring into their grievances, with a view of picking up complaints to our prejudice; but finding himself frustrated in that expectation, by the good will we had procured from the patients by our diligence and humanity, he took the resolution of listening to our conversation, by hiding himself behind the canvas that surrounded our birth; here too he was detected by the boy of our mess, who acquainted us with this piece of behavior, and one night, while we were picking a large bone of salt-beef, Morgan discerned something stir against our hangings, which immediately interpreting to be the doctor, he tipped me the wink, and pointed to the place, where I could evidently perceive some body standing; upon which, I snatched up the bone, and levelled it with all my force at him, saying, "Whoever you are, take that for your curiosity." -- It had the desired effect, for we heard the listener tumble down, and afterward crawl to his own cabin. -- I applauded myself much for this feat, which turned out one of the most unlucky exploits of my life, Mackshane from that night marking me out for destruction. -- About a week thereafter, as I was going my rounds among the sick, I was taken prisoner, and carried to the poop by the master at arms, where I was loaded with irons, and stapled to the deck, on pretense that I was a spy on board, and had conspired against the captain's life. -- How ridiculous soever this imputation was, I did not fail to suffer by it all the rigor that could be shown to the worst of criminals, being exposed in this miserable condition to the scorching heat of the sun by day, and the unwholesome damps by night, during the space of twelve days, in which time I was neither brought to trial, nor examined touching the probability of my charge. -- I had no sooner recovered the use of my reflection, which had been quite overthrown by this accident, than I sent for Thomson, who, after condoling with me on the occasion, hinted to me, that I owed this misfortune to the hatred of the doctor, who had given in an information against me to the captain, in consequence of which I was arrested, and all my papers seized. -- While I was cursing my capricious fate, I saw Morgan ascend the poop, guarded by two corporals, who made him sit down by me, that he might be pinioned in the same machine. -- Notwithstanding my situation, I could scarce refrain from laughing at the countenance of my fellow prisoner, who, without speaking one word, allowed his seet to be enclosed in the rings provided for that purpose; but when they pretended to fasten him on his back, he grew outrageous, and drawing a large cuteau from his side-pocket, threatened to rip up the belly of the first man who should approach him, in order to treat him in such an unworthy manner. -- They were preparing to use him very roughly, when the lieutenant on the quarterdeck, called up to them to let him remain as he was. -- He then crept toward me, and taking me by the hand, bid me "put my trust in Got." -- And looking at Thomson, who sat by us trembling, with a pale visage, told him, there were two more rings for his feet, and he should be glad to find him in such good company. -- But it was not the intention of our adversary to include the second mate in our fate: Him he excepted to be his drudge in attending the sick, and if possible, his evidence against us: With this view he sounded him afar off, but finding his integrity incorruptible, he harrassed him so much out of spite, that in a short time this mild creature grew weary of his life.  While I and my fellow-prisoner comforted each other in our tribulation, the admiral discovered four sail of ships to leeward, and made signal for our ship and four more to chase: Hereupon, every thing was cleared for an engagement, and Mackshane foreseeing he would have occasion for more assistants than one, obtained Morgan's liberty; while I was left in this deplorable posture to the chance of battle. -- It was almost dark when we came up with the sternmost chase, which we hailed, and enquired who they were; they gave us to understand they were French men of war, upon which captain Oakhum commanded them to send their boat on board of him; but they refused, telling him, if he had any business with them, to come on board of their ship: He then threatened to pour in a broadside upon them, which they promised to return. -- Both sides were as good as their word, and the engagement began with great fury. -- The reader may guess how I passed my time, lying in this helpless situation, amidst the terrors of a sea fight; expecting every moment to be cut asunder or dashed in pieces by the enemy's shot! I endeavored to compose myself as much as possible, by reflecting that I was not a whit more exposed than those who were stationed about me; but when I beheld them employed without intermission, in annoying the foe, and encouraged by the society and behavior of one another, I could easily perceive a wide difference between their condition and mine: However, I concealed my agitation as well as I could, till the head of the officer of Marines, who stood near me, being shot off, bounced from the deck athwart my face, leaving me well-nigh blinded with brains. -- I could contain myself no longer, but began to bellow with all the strength of my lungs; when a drummer coming toward me, asked if I was wounded; and before I could answer, received a great shot in his belly which tore out his intrails, and he fell flat on my breast. -- This accident entirely bereft me of all discretion: I redoubled my cries, which were drowned in the noise of the battle; and finding myself disregarded, lost all patience and became frantic; vented my rage in oaths and execrations, till my spirits being quite exhausted, I remained quiet and insensible of the load that oppressed me. -- The engagement lasted till broad day, when captain Oakhum, finding he was like to gain neither honor nor advantage by the affair, pretended to be undeceived by seeing their colors; and hailing the ship with whom he had fought all night, protested he believed them Spaniards, and the guns being silenced on each side, ordered the barge to be hoisted out, and went on board of the French commodore. -- Our loss amounted to ten killed and eighteen wounded, most part of whom afterward died. -- My fellow-mates had no sooner dispatched their business in the cockpit, than full of friendly concern, they came to visit me. -- Morgan ascending first, and seeing my face almost covered with brains and blood, concluded I was no longer a man for this world; and calling to Thomson with great emotion, bid him come up and take his last farewell of his comrade and countryman, who was posting to a petter place, where there were no Mackshanes nor Oakhums to asperse and torment him. -- "No (said he, taking me by the hand) you are going to a country where there is more respect shown to unfortunate shentlemen, and where you will have the satisfaction of peholding your adversaries tossing upon pillows of purning primstone." -- Thomson alarmed at this apostrophe, made haste to the place where I lay, and sitting down by me, with tears in his eyes, enquired into the nature of my calamity. -- By this time I had recollected myself so far as to be able to converse rationally with my friends, whom, to their great satisfaction, I immediately undeceived with regard to their apprehension of my being mortally wounded. -- After I had got myself disengaged from the carnage in which I wallowed, and partaken of a refreshment which my friends brought along with them, we entered into discourse upon the hardships we sustained, and spoke very freely of the authors of our misery; which being overheard by the sentinel who guarded me, he was no sooner relieved, than he reported to the captain every syllable of our conversation, according to the orders he had received: The effects of this soon appeared in the arrival of the master at arms, who replaced Morgan in his former station; and gave the second mate a caution to keep a strict guard over his tongue, if he did not choose to accompany us in our confinement. -- Thomson foreseeing that the whole slavery of attending and dressing the sick and wounded, must now fall upon his shoulders, as well as the ill usage of Mackshane, grew desperate at the prospect, and though I never heard him swear before, imprecated dreadful curses on the heads of his oppressors, declaring, that he would rather quit life altogether, than be much longer under the power of such barbarians. -- I was not a little startled at his vivacity, and endeavored to alleviate his complaints, by representing the subject of my own, with as much aggravation as it would bear, by which comparison he might see the balance of misfortune lay on my side, and take an example from me of fortitude and submission, till such time as we could procure redress, which (I hoped) was not far off, considering, that we should probably be in a harbor in less than three days, where we should have an opportunity of preferring our complaints to the admiral. -- The Welchman joined in my remonstrances, and was at great pains to demonstrate, that it was every man's duty as well as interest to resign himself to the divine will, and look upon himself as a sentinel upon duty, who is by no means at liberty to leave his post before he is relieved. -- Thomson listened attentively to what we said, and at last, shedding a flood of tears, shook his head, and left us, without making any reply. -- About eleven at night, he came to see us again, with a settled gloom on his countenance, and gave us to understand, that he had undergone excessive toil since he saw us, and in recompense, had been grossly abused by the doctor, who taxed him with being confederate with us, in a design of taking away his life and that of the captain. After some time spent in mutual exhortation, he got up, and squeezing me by the hand with an uncommon fervor, cried, "God bless you both," and left us to wonder at his singular manner of parting with us, which did not fail to make an impression on us both.  Next morning, when the hour of visitation ^ame round, this unhappy young man was a missing, and after strick search, supposed to have gone overboard in the night; which was certainly the case.  CHAP. XXX. We lament over the fate of our companion -- the captain offers Morgan his liberty, which he refuses to accept -- we are brought before him and examined -- Morgan is sent back to custody, whither also I am remanded after a curious trial.  THE news of this event affected my fellow-prisoner and me extremely, as our unfortunate companion had justly acquired by his amiable disposition, the love and esteem of us both; and the more we regretted his untimely fate, the greater horror we conceived for the villain who was undoubtedly the occasion of it. -- This abandoned miscreant did not discover the least symptom of concern for Thomson's death, although he must be conscious to himself, of having driven him by ill usage to that fatal resolution; but desired the captain to set Morgan at liberty again to look after the patients. Accordingly, one of the corporals was sent up to unfetter him; when he protested he would not be released until he should know for what he was confined; nor would he be a tennis-ball, nor a shittle-cock, nor a trudge, nor a scullion to any captain under the sun. -- Oakhum finding him obstinate, and fearing it would not be in his power to exercise his tyranny much longer with impunity, was willing to show some appearance of justice, and therefore ordered us both to be brought before him, on the quarter deck, where he sat in state, with his clerk on one side, and his counselor Mackshane on the other. -- When we approached, he honored us with this salutation: "So, gentlemen, d -- n my blood! many a captain in the navy would have ordered you both to be tucked up to the yard's arm, without either judge or jury, for the crimes you have been guilty of; but d -- n my blood, I have too much good nature, in allowing such dogs as you to make your defense." -- "Captain Oaghum, (said my fellow-sufferer) certainly it is in your power (Got help the while) to tuck us all up at your will, and desire, and pleasures. -- And perhaps it would be petter for some of us to be tucked up, than undergo the miseries to which we have been exposed. -- So may the farmer hang his kids for his diversion, and amusement, and mirth; but there is such a thing as justice, if not upon earth, surely in heaven, that will punish with fire and primstone all those who take away the lives of innocent people out of wantonness and parparity (look you.) -- In the mean time, I shall be glad to know the crimes laid to my charge, and see the person who accuses me." -- "That you shall (said the captain) here doctor, what have you to say?" -- Mackshane stepping forward, hemmed a good while, in order to clear his throat, and before he began, Morgan accosted him thus: "Doctor Mackshane, look in my face -- look in the face of an honest man, who abhorrs a false-witness as he abhorrs the tevil, and Got be judge between you and me." -- The doctor not minding this conjuration, made the following speech, as near as I can remember: -- "I Will tell you what, Mr. Morgan, to be sure what you say is just, in regard to an honest man; and if so be it appears as how you are an honest man, then it is my opinion, that you deserve to be acquitted, in relation to that there affair; for I tell you what, captain Oakhum is resolved for to do every body justice. -- As for my own part, all that I have to allege, is that I have been informed, you have spoken disrespectful words against your captain, who to be sure, is the most honorable and generous commander in the king's service, without asparagement or acceptance of man, woman or child." -- Having uttered this elegant harrangue, on which he seemed to plume himself, Morgan replied, "I do partly guess, and conceive, and understand your meaning, which I wish could be more explicit: But however, I do suppose, I am not to be condemned upon bare hearsay; or if I am convicted of speaking disrespectfully of captain Oakhum, I hope there is no treason in my words." -- "But there is mutiny, by G -- d, and that is death by the articles of war (cried Oakhum.) -- In the mean time, let the witnesses be called." -- Hereupon Mackshane's servant appeared, and the boy of our mess, whom they had seduced and tutored for the purpose. -- The first declared, that Morgan, as he descended the cockpit ladder, one day, cursed the captain and called him a savage beast, saying, he ought to be hunted down as an enemy to mankind. -- "This (said the clerk) is a strong presumption of a design formed against the captain's life. -- For why? It presupposes malice afore-thought, and a criminal intention a priori." -- "Right (said the captain to this miserable grub, who had been an attorney's boy) you shall have law enough, here is Cook and Littlejohn for it." This evidence was confirmed by the boy, who affirmed, he heard the first mate say, that the captain had no more bowels than a bear, and the surgeon had no more brains than an ass. -- Then the sentinel who heard our discourse on the poop was examined, and informed the court that the Welchman assured me, that captain Oakhum and doctor Mackshane would toss upon billows of burning brimstone in hell for their barbarity. -- The clerk observed, that here was an evident prejudication, which confirmed the former suspicion of a conspiracy against the life of captain Oakhum; for, because, how could Morgan so positively pronounce that the captain and surgeon would be damned, unless he had intention to make away with them before they could have time to repent? -- This sage explanation had great weight with our noble commander, who exclaimed, "What have you to say to this, Taffy? you seem to be taken all a-back, brother, hah!" -- Morgan was too much of a gentleman to disown the text, although he absolutely denied the truth of the comment: Upon which the captain, strutting up to him, with a ferocious countenance, said, "So, Mr. Son-of-a-b -- ch, you confess you honored me with the names of bear and beast, and pronounced my damnation! D -- n my heart! I have a good mind to have you brought to a court martial and hanged, you dog." -- Here Mackshane having occasion for an assistant, interposed, and begged the captain to pardon Mr. Morgan, with his wonted goodness, upon condition that he the delinquent should make such submission as the nature of his misdemeanour demanded. -- Upon which the Cambro-Briton, who on this occasion, would have made no submission to the Great Mogul, surrounded with his guards, thanked the doctor for his mediation, and acknowledged himself in the wrong for having called the image of Got, a beast, "but (said he) I spoke by metaphor, and parable, and comparison, and types; as we signify meekness by a lamb, letchery by a goat, and craftiness by a fox; so we liken ignorance to an ass, and brutality to a bear, and fury to a tiger; -- therefore I made these similies to express my sentiments (look you) and what I said, before Got, I will not unsay before man nor peast neither." -- Oakhum was so provoked at this insolence (as he termed it) that he ordered him forthwith to be carried to the place of his confinement, and his clerk to proceed in the examination of me. -- The first question put to me, was touching the place of my nativity, which I declared to be the north of Scotland. "The north of Ireland more liker (cried the captain) but we shall bring you up presently." -- He then asked what religion I professed; and when I answered, "The protestant," swore I was as arrant a Roman as ever went to mass. -- "Come, come, clerk (continued he) catechize him a little on this subject." -- But before I relate the particulars of the clerk's enquiries, it will not be amiss to inform the reader that our commander himself was an Hibernian, and, if not shrewdly belied, a Roman Catholic to boot. -- "You say you are a protestant (said the clerk) make the sign of the cross with your fingers, so, and swear upon it, to that affirmation." -- When I was about to perform this ceremony, the captain cried with some emotion, "No, no, damme!
