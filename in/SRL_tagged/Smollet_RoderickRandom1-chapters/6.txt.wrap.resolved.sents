"Well then (proceeded my examiner) how many sacraments are there?"
-- To which I replied, "Two."
-- "What are how many sacraments?
(said he.)"
I answered, "Baptism and the Lord's Supper."
-- "And so you would explode confirmation and marriage altogether?
(said Oakhum) I thought this fellow was a rank Roman."
-- The clerk, though this fellow was bred under an attorney, could not relrain from blushing at this blunder, which this fellow endeavored to conceal, by observing, that these decoys would not do with me who seemed to be an old offender.
-- this fellow went on, with asking if I believed in transubstantiation; but I treated the notion of the real presence with such disrespect that this fellow patron was scandalized at my impiety, and commanded this fellow to proceed to the plot.
-- Whereupon this miserable pettifogger told me, there was great reason to suspect me of being a spy on board; and that I had entered into a conspiracy with Thomson and others not yet detected, against the life of captain Oakhum.
-- To support which accusation, which accusation adduced the testimony of our boy, who declared he had often heard Thomson and others whispering together, and could distinguish the words, "Oakhum, rascal, poison, pistol," by which it appeared, Thomson and others did intend to use sinister means to accomplish he destruction.
That the death of Thomson seemed to confirm this conjecture, who, either feeling the stings of remorse, for being engaged in such a horrid confederacy, or fearing a discovery, by which he must have infallibly suffered an ignominious death, had put a fatal period to he own existence.
-- But what established the truth of the whole, was a book in cipher found among my papers, which exactly tallied with one found in he chest, after he disappearance: This, he observed, was a presumption very near proof positive, and would determine any jury in christendom to find me guilty.
-- In my own defense, I alleged that I had been dragged on board at first very much against my inclination, as I could prove by the evidence of some people now in the ship; consequently could have no design of becoming spy at that time; and ever since had been entirely out of the reach of any correspondence that could justly intail that suspicion upon me; -- and as for conspiring against my captain's life, it could not be supposed that any man in my captain right wits would harbor the least thought of such an undertaking, which my captain could not possibly perform without certain infamy and ruin to my captain, even if my captain had all the inclination in the world.
-- That allowing the boy's evidence to be true (which I affirmed was false and malicious) nothing conclusive could be gathered from a few incoherent words: Neither was the fate of Mr. Thomson a circumstance more favorable for the charge; for I had in my pocket, a letter which too well explained that mystery, in a very different manner from that which was supposed: With these words I produced the following letter, which Jack Rattlin brought to me the very day after Mr. Thomson disappeared; and told me it was committed to Thomson disappeared care by the deceased, who made Thomson disappeared promise not to deliver it sooner.
The clerk taking it out of my hand, read aloud the contents, which were these:  DEAR FRIEND, I AM so much oppressed with the fatigue I daily and nightly undergo, and the barbarous usage of doctor Mackshane, who is bent on your destruction, as well as mine, that I am resolved to free me from this miserable life, and before you receive this, shall be no more.
I could have wished to die in your good opinion, which I am afraid I shall forfeit by the last act of my life; but if you cannot acquit me, I know you will at least preserve some regard for the memory of an unfortunate young man who loved you.
-- I recommend it to you, to beware of Mackshane, whose revenge is implacable.
-- I wish all prosperity to you and Mr. Morgan, to whom pray offer my last respects, and beg to be remembered as your unhappy friend and countryman.
WILLIAM THOMSON.
This letter was no sooner read, than Mackshane, in a transport of rage, snatched This letter out of The clerk's hands, and tore This letter into a thousand pieces, saying, This letter was a villainous forgery, contrived and executed by me.
-- The captain and clerk declared The captain and clerk of the same opinion, notwithstanding I insisted on having the remains of it compared to other writings of Thomson, which The captain and clerk had in possession; and I was ordered to answer the last article of my accusation, namely, the book of ciphers found among my papers.
-- "That is easily done (said I.)
What you are pleased to call ciphers, are no other than the Greek characters, in which, for my amusement, I kept a diary of every thing remarkable that has occurred to my observation since the beginning of the voyage, till the day on which I was put in irons; and the same method, was practiced by Mr. Thomson who copied mine."
-- "A very likely story!
(cried Mackshane) what occasion was there for using Greek characters, if you were not afraid of discovering what you had wrote?
-- but, what do you talk of Greek characters?
-- Do You think I am so ignorant of the Greek language, as not to distinguish the Greek language letters from these, which are no more Greek than Chinese?
No, no, I will not give up my knowledge of the Greek for you, nor none that ever came from your country."
So saying, with an unparalleled effronterie, an unparalleled effronterie repeated some gibberish, which by the sound seemed to be Irish, and made it pass for the Greek with the captain, who looking at an unparalleled effronterie with a contemptible sneer, exclaimed, "Ah ha!
have you caught a tartar?"
I could not help smiling at the consummate assurance of this Hibernian, and offered to refer the dispute to any body on board, who understood the Greek alphabet: Upon which Morgan was brought back, and being made acquainted with the affair, took the book and read a whole page in English, without hesitation, deciding the controversy in my favor.
-- The doctor was so far from being out of countenance at this, that The doctor affirmed Morgan was in the secret, and repeated from Morgan own invention.
-- Oakhum said, "Ay, ay, I see both are both in a story," and dismissed my fellowmate to Morgan cock-loft, although I proposed that Morgan and I should read and translate separately, any chapter or verse in the Greek-testament in Morgan possession, by which it would appear whether we or the surgeon spoke truth.
-- Not being endued with eloquence enough to convince the captain that there could be no juggle nor confederacy in this expedient, I begged to be examined by some unconcerned person on board, who understood Greek: Accordingly the whole ship's company, officers and all, were called upon deck, among whom it was proclaimed, that if any of the whole ship's company, officers and all could speak Greek, he or the whole ship's company, officers and all so qualified, should ascend the quarter deck immediately.
-- After some pause two fore-mast-men came up and professed two fore-mast-men skill in that language, which (two fore-mast-men said) two fore-mast-men acquired during several voyages to the Levant, among the Greeks of the Morea.
the captain exulted much in this declaration, and put my journal book into the hands of one of them, who heartily owned the captain could neither read nor write; the other acknowledged the same degree of ignorance, but pretended to speak the Greek lingo with any man on board; and addressing the captain to the captain, pronounced some sentences of a barbarous corrupted language, which I did not understand.
-- I asserted that the modern Greek was as different from that spoke and written by the ancients, as the English used now from the old Saxon spoke in the time of Hengist; and as I had only learned the true original tongue, in which Homer, Pindar, the evangelists and other Great men of antiquity wrote, it could not be supposed that I should know any thing of an imperfect Gothic dialect that rose on the ruins of the former, and scarce retained any traces of the old expression.
-- But if doctor Mackshane, who pretended to be master of the Greek language, could maintain a conversation with these seamen, I would retract what I had said, and be content to suffer any punishment he should think proper to inflict.
-- I had no sooner uttered these words, than the surgeon knowing one of the fellows to be his countryman, accosted his in Irish, and was answered in the same brogue; then a dialogue ensued between these seamen, which these seamen affirmed to be Greek, after having secured the secrecy of the other tar, who had his cue in the language of the Morea from the Morea companion, before these seamen would venture to assert such an intrepid falsehood.
-- "I thought (said Oakhum) we should discover the imposture at last, -- Let the rascal be carried back to his confinement.
-- I find his must dangle."
-- Having nothing further to urge in my own behalf, before a court so prejudiced with spite, and fortified with ignorance against truth, I suffered myself to be reconducted peaceably to my fellow-prisoner, who hearing the particulars of my trial, lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven, and uttered a dreadful groan; and not daring to disburthen his thoughts to myself by speech, lest his might be overheard by the sentinel, burst forth into a Welsh song, which his accompanied with a thousand contortions of face and violent gestures of body.

XXXI.
I discover a subornation against myself, by means of a quarrel between two of the evidences; in consequence of which, I am set at liberty, and prevail upon Morgan to accept of Morgan freedom on the same terms -- Mackshane's malice -- we arrive at Jamaica, from whence in a short time we beat up to Hispaniola, in conjunction with the West-Indian squadron -- we take in water, sail again, and arrive at Carthagena -- reflections on we conduct there.
MEAN while, a quarrel happening between the two modern Greeks, the one to be revenged of the other, came and discovered to we the mystery of Mackshane dialogue, as I have explained it above.
This detection coming to the ears of the doctor, who was sensible that (now we were in sight of Jamaica) we should have an opportunity of clearing we before a court martial, and at the same time, of making his malice and ignorance conspicuous, his interceeded for we with the captain so effectually, that in a few hours we were set at liberty, and ordered to return to we duty.
-- This was a happy event for me, my whole body being blistered by the sun, and my limbs benumbed for want of motion: But I could not persuade the Welchman to accept of this indulgence, the Welchman persisting in the Welchman obstinacy to remain in irons until the Welchman should be discharged by a courtmartial, which the Welchman believed would also do the Welchman justice on the Welchman enemies; at length, I represented to the Welchman the precarious issue of a trial, the power and interest of the Welchman adversaries, and flattered the Welchman revenge with the hope of wreaking the Welchman resentment with the Welchman own hands upon Mackshane after we return to England: This last argument had more weight with the Welchman than all the rest, and prevailed upon the Welchman to repair with me to the cockpit, which I no sooner entered, than the idea of my departed friend presented the Welchman to my remembrance, and filled my eyes with tears.
-- we discharged from we mess the boy who had acted so perfidiously, notwithstanding the Welchman tears, entreaties, and professions of penitence for what the Welchman had done; but not before the Welchman had confessed that the surgeon had bribed the Welchman to give evidence against we, with a pair of stockings and a couple of old check shirts, which his servant had since plundered the Welchman of.
The keys of we chests and lockers being sent to we by the doctor, we detained the messenger until we had examined the contents; and my fellow-mate finding all his Cheshire cheese consumed to a crust, his brandy exhausted, and his onions gone, was seized with a fit of choler, which his discharged on Mackshane's man in oaths and execrations, threatening to prosecute his as a thief.
-- The fellow swore in The fellow turn that The fellow never had the keys in The fellow possession till that time, when The fellow received them from The fellow master, with orders to deliver them to we.
-- "As Got is my judge (cried Morgan) and my salfation, and my witness, whosoever has pilfered my provisions, is a lousy, beggarly, rascally knave!
and by the soul of my grandsire!
I will impeach, and accuse, and indict my judge (cried Morgan) and my salfation, and my witness of a roppery, if I did but know who my judge (cried Morgan) and my salfation, and my witness is."
-- Had this happened at sea where we could not repair the loss, in all probability, this descendant of Cadwallader would have lost this descendant of Cadwallader wits entirely: but when I observed, how easy it would be to make up for this paultry misfortune, this descendant of Cadwallader became more calm, and reconciled this descendant of Cadwallader to the occasion.
-- A little while after, the surgeon came into the birth, under pretense of taking something out of the medicine-chest, and with a smiling aspect, wished we joy of we deliverance, which (he said) he had been at great pains to obtain of the captain, who was very justly incensed at we behavior; but he (the doctor) had passed he word for we conduct in time to come, and he hoped we should give he no cause to repent of he kindness.
-- he expected (no doubt) an acknowledgment from we for this pretended piece of service, as well as a general amnesty of what was past; but he had to do with people who were not quite so apt to forgive injuries as he imagined, or to forget that if we deliverance was owing to he mediation, we calamity was occasioned by he malice; I therefore sat silent while my companion answered, "Ay, ay, it is no matter -- Got knows the heart -- there is a time for all things, as the wise man says, there is a time for throwing away stones, and a time to gather stones up again."
-- he seemed to be disconcerted at this reply, and went away in a pet, muttering something about "Ingratitude" and "Fellows," which we did not think fit to take any notice of.
we fleet having joined another that waited for we, lay at anchor about a month in the harbor of Port Royal in Jamaica, during which time something of consequence was certainly transacted, notwithstanding the insinuations of some who affirmed we had no business at all in that place -- that in order to take the advantage of the season proper for we enterprise, the West-Indian squadron, which had previous notice of we coming, ought to have joined we at the west end of Hispaniola with necessary stores and refreshments, from whence we could have sailed directly to Carthagena, before the enemy could put the enemy in a good posture of defense, or indeed have an inkling of we design.
Be this as it will, we sailed from Jamaica, and in ten days or a fortnight, beat up against the wind as far as the isle of Vache, with an intention, as was said, to attack Our fleet, then supposed to be lying near that place; but before we arrived they had sailed for Europe, having first dispatched an advice-boat to Carthagena with an account of we being in these seas, as also of we strength and destination.
-- we loitered here some days longer, taking in wood, and brackish water, in the use whereof, however, we admiral seemed to consult the health of the men, by restricting each to a quart a day.
-- At length we set sail, and arrived in a bay to the windward of Carthagena, where we came to an anchor, and lay at we ease ten days longer.
-- Here again, certain malicious people take occasion to blame the conduct of certain malicious people superiors, by saying, this was not only throwing away time, which was very precious considering the approach of the rainy season, but also giving the Spaniards time to recollect themselves, and recover from the consternation themselves were thrown into at the approach of an English fleet, at least three times as numerous as ever appeared in that part of the world before.
But if I might be allowed to give my opinion of the matter, I would ascribe this delay to the generosity of our chiefs, who scorned to take any advantage that fortune might give fortune, even over an enemy.
At last, however, we weighed, and anchored again somewhat nearer the harbour's mouth, where we made shift to land we marines, who encamped on the beach, in despite of the enemy's shot, which knocked a good many of fortune on the head.
-- This piece of conduct in choosing a camp under the walls of an enemy's fortification, which I believe never happened before, was practiced, I presume, with a view of accustoming the soldiers to stand fire, who were not as yet much used to discipline, most of the soldiers having been taken from the plough-tail a few months before.
-- This again has furnished matter for censure against the Ministry, for sending a few raw recruits on such an important enterprise, while so many veteran regiments lay inactive at home: But surely our governors had our governors reasons for so doing, which possibly may be disclosed with other secrets of the deep.
Perhaps our governors were loath to risk our governors best troops on such desperate service; or, may be the colonels and field officers of the old corpse, who, generally speaking, enjoyed our governors commissions as sine-cures or pensions, for some domestic services tendered to the court, refused to embark in such a dangerous and precarious undertaking; for which, no doubt, our governors are to be much commended.

Our land forces being disembarked, erect a faschine battery -- Our ship is ordered with four more, to batter the fort of Bocca Chica -- Mackshane's cowardice -- the chaplain's phrenzy -- honest Rattlin lases one hand -- his heroism and reflections on the battle -- Crampley's behavior to me during the heat of the fight.
OUR forces being landed and stationed as I have already mentioned, set about erecting a faschine battery to cannonade the principal fort of the enemy, and in something more than three weeks, it was ready to open.
That we might do the Spaniards as much honor as possible, it was determined in a council of war, that five of our largest ships should attack the fort on one side, while the battery plied the battery on the other, strengthened with two mortars, and twenty-four cohorns.
Accordingly, the signal for our to engage, among others, was hoisted, our being advertised the night before, to make every thing clear for that purpose: and in so doing, a difference happened between captain Oakhum and his well-beloved cousin and counselor Mackshane, which had well nigh terminated in an open rupture.
-- The doctor, who had imagined there was no more danger of being hurt by the enemy's shot in the cockpit than in the center of the earth, was lately informed that a surgeon's mate had been killed in that place, by a cannon-ball from two small forts, that were destroyed before the disembarkation of our soldiers; and therefore insisted upon having a platform raised for the convenience of the sick and wounded, in the after-hold, where a surgeon's mate deemed a surgeon's mate more secure than on the deck above.
-- The captain, offended at this extraordinary proposal, accused a surgeon's mate of pusilanimity, and told a surgeon's mate there was no room in the hold for such an occasion; or if there was, a surgeon's mate could not expect to be indulged more than the rest of the surgeons of the navy, who used the cockpit for that purpose: Fear rendering Mackshane obstinate, a surgeon's mate persisted in a surgeon's mate demand, and showed a surgeon's mate instructions, by which it was authorized: The captain swore his instructions, by which it was authorized were dictated by a parcel of lazy poltroons who were never at sea; but was obliged to comply, and sent for the carpenter to give The captain orders about it: But before any such measure could be taken, our signal was thrown out, and the doctor compelled to trust the doctor carcass in the cockpit, where Morgan and I were busy in putting Morgan and I instruments and dressings in order.
Morgan and I , with the others destined for this service, immediately weighed, and in less than half an hour came to an anchor before the castle of Bocca Chica, with a spring upon Morgan and I cable.
-- The cannonading (which indeed was terrible!)
began.
the surgeon, after having crossed the surgeon, fell flat on the deck; and the chaplain and purser, who were stationed with Morgan and I, in quality of assistants, followed the surgeon example, while the Welchman and I sat upon a chest looking at one another with great discomposure, scarce able to refrain from the like prostration.
-- And that the reader may know, the reader was not a common occasion that alarmed Morgan and I thus, I must inform the surgeon of the particulars of this dreadful din that astonished Morgan and I.
The fire of the Spaniards proceeded from Bocca Chica mounting eighty-four great guns, beside a mortar and small arms; from fort St. Joseph, mounting thirty-six; from two faschine batteries, mounting twenty; and from four men of war, mounting sixty-four guns each.
-- This was answered by Morgan and I, from Morgan and I land battery, mounting twenty-one cannon; Morgan and I bomb battery, mounting two mortars, and twenty-four cohorns, and five men of war, two of eighty, and three of seventy guns, which fired without intermission.
-- Morgan and I had not been many minutes engaged, when one of the sailors brought another on his back to the cockpit, where his tossed his down like a bag of oats, and pulling out his pouch, put a large chew of tobacco in his mouth, without speaking a word; Morgan immediately examined the condition of the wounded man, and cried, "As I shall answer now, the wounded man is as tead as my greatgrandfather."
-- "Dead (said the wounded man comrade) the wounded man may be dead now, for ought I know, but I Will be d -- mn'd if the wounded man was not alive when I took the wounded man up."
-- So saying, the wounded man was about to return to the wounded man quarters, when I bid the wounded man carry the body along with the wounded man and throw the body overboard.
-- "D -- n the body!
(said the wounded man) I think it is fair enough if I take care of my own."
-- My fellow-mate snatching up the amputation knife, pursued the wounded man halfway up the cockpit ladder, crying, "You lousy rascal, is this the churchyard, or the charnel-house, or the sepulcher, or the Golgotha of our ship?"
-- but was stopped in the wounded man carreer by one calling, "Yo ho, avast there -- scaldings."
-- "Scaldings!
(answered Morgan) Got knows it is hot enough indeed: -- who are you?"
-- "Here Is one (replied the voice.")
and I immediately knew it to be that of my honest friend Jack Rattlin, who coming toward Morgan) Got, told me, with great deliberation, the wounded man was come to be dock'd at last, and discovered the remains of one hand which had been shattered to pieces with grape shot.
-- I lamented with unfeigned sorrow the wounded man misfortune, which the wounded man bore with heroic courage, observing, that every shot had its commission: It was well it did not take the wounded man in the head; or if it had, what then?
the wounded man should have died bravely, fighting for the wounded man king and country: Death was a debt which every man owed, and must pay now as well as another time.
-- I was much pleased and edified with the maxims of this sea-philosopher, who endured the amputation of the wounded man left hand without shrinking; the operation being performed (at the wounded man request) by Morgan) Got, after Mackshane, who was with difficulty prevailed to lift the wounded man head from the deck, had declared there was a necessity for the wounded man losing the limb.
-- While I was employed in dressing the stump, I asked Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking Jack , frankly told me, Jack believed Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head should do no good; "For why, because instead of dropping anchor close under shore, where Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head should have had to deal with one corner of Bocca Chica only, Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head had opened the harbor, and exposed Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head to the whole fire of the enemy from the enemy shipping and fort St. Joseph, as well as from the castle Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head intended to canonade; that besides, Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head lay at too great a distance to damage the walls, and three parts in four of Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head shot did not take place; for there was scarce any body on board, who understood the pointing of a gun.
-- Ah!
God help Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head!
(continued he) if your kinsman lieutenant Bowling had been here, Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head should have had other-guess-work."
-- By this time Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head patients had increased to such a degree, that Jack's opinion of the battle, who shaking his head did not know which to begin with; and the first mate plainly told the surgeon, that if the surgeon did not get up immediately, and perform the surgeon duty, the surgeon would complain of the surgeon behavior to the admiral, and make application for the surgeon warrant.
-- This effectually roused Mackshane, who was never ^eaf to an argument in which he thought he interest was concerned; he therefore rose up, and in order to strengthen he resolution, had recourse more than once to a case-bottle of rum which he freely communicated to the chaplain and purser, who had as much need of such extraordinary inspiration as he: Being thus supported, he went to work, and arms and legs were hewed down without mercy.
-- The fumes of the liquor mounting into the parson's brain, conspired with he former agitation of spirits, to make he quite delirious; he stripped he to the skin, and besmearing he body with blood, could scarce be withheld from running upon deck in that condition.
Jack Rattlin, scandalized at this deportment, endeavored to allay Jack Rattlin transports with reason; but finding all Jack Rattlin said ineffectual, and great confusion occasioned by Jack Rattlin frolicks, Jack Rattlin knocked he down with Jack Rattlin right hand, and by threats kept Jack Rattlin quiet in that state of humiliation.
-- But it was not in the power of rum to elevate the purser, who sat on the floor wringing Jack Rattlin hands, and cursing the hour in which Jack Rattlin left Jack Rattlin peaceable profession of a brewer in Rochester, to engage in such a life of terror and disquiet.
-- While we diverted we at the expense of this poor devil, a shot happened to take we between wind and water, and its course being through the purser's store-room, made a terrible havoc and noise among the jars and bottles in its way, and disconcerted Mackshane so much, that Mackshane dropped Mackshane scalpel, and falling down on Mackshane knees, pronounced Mackshane Paternoster aloud; the purser fell backward and lay without sense or motion; and the chaplain grew so outrageous, that Rattlin with one hand, could not keep Mackshane under; so that we were obliged to confine Mackshane in the surgeon's cabin, where Mackshane was no doubt guilty of a thousand extravagancies.
-- Much about this time, my old antagonist Crampley came down, with express orders (as my old antagonist Crampley said) to bring me up to the quarterdeck, to dress a slight wound The captain had received by a splinter.
my old antagonist Crampley reason for honoring me in particular with this piece of service, being that in case I should be killed or disabled by the way, my death or mutilation would be of less consequence to our ship's company, than that of the doctor or my old antagonist Crampley first mate.
-- At another time, perhaps, I might have disputed this order, to which I was not bound to pay the least regard; but as I thought my reputation depended upon my compliance, I was resolved to convince my rival that I was no more afraid than my rival, to expose my rival to danger.
-- With this view, I provided my rival with dressings, and followed my rival immediately to the quarter deck, through a most infernal scene of slaughter, fire, smoke, and uproar!
Captain Oakhum, who leaned against the mizen mast, no sooner (...) me approach in my shirt, with the sleeves t^ed up to my armpits, and my hands dyed with blood, than my rival signified my rival displeasure by a frown, and asked why the doctor himself did not come?
I told the doctor himself Crampley had singled me out, as if by the doctor himself express command; at which the doctor himself seemed surprised, and threatened to punish the midshipman for the doctor himself presumption, after the engagement: In the mean time, I was sent back to my station, and ordered to tell Mackshane, that The captain expected the doctor himself immediately.
-- I got safe back and delivered up my commission to the doctor, who flatly refused to quit the post assigned to the doctor himself by the doctor himself instructions.
Hereupon, Morgan, who (I believe) was jealous of my reputation for courage, undertook the affair, and ascended with great intrepidity.
-- The captain finding the surgeon obstinate, suffered The captain finding the surgeon obstinate to be dressed, and swore The captain finding the surgeon obstinate would confine Mackshane as soon as that service should be over.

XXXIII.
A breach being made in the walls, our soldiers give the assault, take the place without opposition -- our sailors at the same time become masters of all the other strengths near Bocca Chica, and take possession of the harbor -- the good consequence of this success -- our move nearer the town -- find two forts deserted, and the channel blocked up with sunk vessels; which however, we find means to clear -- land we soldiers at La Quinta -- repulse a body of militia -- attack the castle of St. Lazar, and are forced to retreat with great loss -- the remains of our army are re-imbarked -- an effort of the admiral to take the Town -- the economy of we expedition described.
HAVING cannonaded the fort, during the space of four hours, we were all ordered to slip we cables, and sheer off; but next day the engagement was renewed, and continued from the morning till the afternoon, when the enemy's fire from Bocca Chica slackened, and toward evening was quite silenced.
-- A breach being made on the other side, by our land-battery, large enough to admit a middle sized baboon, provided the admiral could find means to climb up to a middle sized baboon; our general proposed to give the assault that very night, and actually ordered a detachment on that duty: Providence stood our friend upon this occasion, and put this occasion into the hearts of the Spaniards to abandon the fort, which might have been maintained by resolute men, to the day of judgment against all the force our could exert in the attack.
-- And while our soldiers took possession of the enemy's ramparts, without resistance, the same good luck attended a body of sailors, who made sailors masters of fort St. Joseph, the faschine batteries, and one Spanish man of war; the other three being burnt or sunk by the foe, that sailors might not fall into our hands.
-- The taking of these forts, in the strength of which the Spaniards chiefly confided, made us masters of the outward harbor, and occasioned great joy among our; as our laid our accounts with finding little or no opposition from the town: And indeed, if a few great ships had sailed up immediately, before a few great ships had recovered from the confusion and despair that our unexpected success had produced among a few great ships, it is not impossible that our might have finished the affair to our satisfaction, without any more bloodshed: but this our Heroes disdained, as a barbarous insult over the enemy's distress; and gave them all the respite them could desire, in order to recollect them.
-- In the mean time, Mackshane taking the advantage of this general exultation, waited on our captain, and pleaded our captain own cause so effectually, that our captain was re-established in our captain good graces; and as for Crampley, there was no more notice taken of our captain behavior toward me, during the action.
-- But of all the consequences of the victory, none was more grateful than plenty of fresh water, after our had languished five weeks on the allowance of a purser's quart per diem for each man, in the Torrid Zone, where the sun was vertical, and the expense of bodily fluid so great, that a gallon of liquor could scarce supply the waste of twentyfour hours; especially, as our provision consisted of putrid salt beef, to which the sailors gave the name of Irish horse; salt pork of New England, which though neither fish nor flesh, savoured of both; bread from the same country, every biscuit whereof, like a piece of clock work, moved by its own internal impulse, occasioned by the myriads of insects that dwelt within its; and butter served out by the gill, that tasted like train-oil thickened with salt.
Instead of small-beer, each man was allowed three half quarterns of brandy or rum, which was distributed every morning, diluted with a certain quantity of each man water, without either sugar or fruit to render it palatable, for which reason this composition, was by the sailors not unaptly styled Necessity.
Nor was this limitation of simple element owing to a scarcity of it on board, there being at this time water enough in our ship for a voyage of six months, at the rate of half a gallon per day to each man: But this fast must (I suppose) have been injoined by way of penance on our ship's company for their sins; or rather with a view to mortify their into a contempt of life, that their might thereby become more resolute and regardless of danger.
How simply then do their argue, who ascribe the great mortality among us, to us bad provision and want of water; and affirm, that a great many valuable lives might have been saved, if the useless transports had been employed in fetching fresh stock, turtle, fruit, and other refreshments, from Jamaica and other adjacent islands, for the use of the army and fleet!
seeing, it is to be hoped, that those who died went to a better place, and those who survived were the more easily maintained.
-- After all, a sufficient number remained to fall before the walls of St. Lazar, where they behaved like they own country mastifs, which shut they eyes, run into the jaws of a bear, and have they heads crushed for they valor.
But to return to my narration: After having put garrisons into the forts we had taken, and re-imbarked we soldiers and artillery, which detained we more than a week, we ventured up to the mouth of the inner harbor, guarded by a large fortification on one side, and a small redoubt on the other, both of which were deserted before we approach, and the entrance of the harbor blocked up by several old galleons that the enemy had sunk in the channel.
-- we made shift, however, to open a passage for some ships of war, that favored the second landing of we troops at a place called La Quinta, not far from the town, where, after a faint resistance from a body of Spaniards, who opposed their disembarkation, their encamped with a design of besieging the castle of St. Lazar, which overlooked and commanded the city: Whether we renowned general had no body in our renowned general army who knew how to approach it in form, or that our renowned general trusted entirely to the fame of our renowned general arms, I shall not determine; but certain it is, a resolution was taken in a council of war, to attack the place with musquetry only, which was put in execution, and succeeded accordingly; the enemy giving the enemy such an hearty reception, that the greatest part of the detachment took up the enemy everlasting residence on the spot.
-- we chief not relishing this kind of complaisance in the Spaniards, was wise enough to retreat on board with the remains of our renowned general army, which, from eight thousand able men landed on the beach near Bocca Chica, was now reduced to fifteen hundred fit for service.
-- The sick and wounded were squeezed into certain vessels, which thence obtained the name of hospital ships, though methinks they scarce deserved such a creditable title, seeing none of they could boast of either surgeon, nurse or cook; and the space between decks was so confined, that the miserable patients had not room to sit upright in the miserable patients beds.
the miserable patients wounds and stumps being neglected, contracted filth and putrefaction, and millions of maggots were hatched amid the corruption of millions of maggots sores.
This inhuman disregard was imputed to the scarcity of surgeons; though This inhuman disregard is well known, that every great ship in the fleet could have spared one at least for this duty, which would have been more than sufficient to remove this shocking inconvenience: But, perhaps, our renowned general was too much of a gentleman to ask a favor of this kind from our renowned general fellow-chief, who on the other hand, would not derogate so far from our renowned general own dignity, as to offer such assistance unasked; for I may venture to affirm, that by this time, the Demon of discord with her sooty wings, had breathed her influence upon our counsels; and it might be said of these great men, (I hope these great men will pardon the comparison) as of Caesar and Pompey, the one could not brook a superior, and the other was impatient of an equal: So that between the pride of one, and insolence of another, the enterprise miscarried, according to the proverb, "Between two stools the backside falls to the ground."
-- Not that I would be thought to liken any public concern to that opprobrious part of the human body, although I might with truth assert, if I durst use such a vulgar idiom, that the nation did hang an a -- se at the nation disappointment on this occasion; neither would I presume to compare the capacity of our heroic leaders to any such wooden convenience as a joint-stool or a close-stool; but only signify by this simile, the mistake the people committed in trusting to the union of two instruments that were never joined.
A day or two after the attempt on St. Lazar, the admiral ordered one of the Spanish men of war we had taken, to be mounted with sixteen guns, and manned with detachments from we great ships, in order to batter the town; accordingly, the admiral was towed into the inner harbor in the nightime, and moored within half a mile of the walls, against which the admiral began to fire at daybreak; and continued about four hours exposed to the opposition of at least forty pieces of cannon, which at length obliged our men to set the admiral on fire, and get off as well as our men could, in our men boats.
-- This piece of conduct afforded matter of speculation to all the wits, either in the army or the navy, who were at last fain to acknowledge it a stroke of policy above all the wits comprehension.
-- Some entertained such an irreverent opinion of the admiral's understanding, as to think the admiral expected the town would surrender to the admiral floating battery of sixteen guns: Others imagined the admiral sole intention was to try the enemy's strength, by which the admiral would be able to compute the number of great ships that would be necessary to bring the Spaniards to a capitulation: But this last conjecture soon appeared groundless, in as much as no ships of any kind whatever were afterward employed on that service.
-- A third sort swore, that no other cause could be assigned for this undertaking, than that which induced Don Quixote to attack the windmill.
A fourth class (and that the most numerous, though without doubt, composed of the sanguine and malicious) plainly taxed this commander with want of honesty as well as sense; and alleged that this commander ought to have sacrificed private pique to the interest of this commander country; that where the lives of so many brave fellow citizens were concerned, this commander ought to have concurred with our renowned general, without being solicited or even desired, toward so many brave fellow citizens preservation and advantage; that if this commander arguments could not dissuade this commander from a desperate enterprise, it was this commander duty to render it as practicable as possible, without running extreme hazard; that this could have been done, with a good prospect of success, by ordering five or six large ships to batter the town while the land forces stormed the castle, by this means, a considerable diversion would have been made in favor of those troops, who in their march to the assault and in the retreat, suffered much more from the town than from the castle; that the inhabitants seeing themselves vigorously attacked on all hands, would have been divided, distracted and confused, and in all probability, unable to resist the assailants.
-- But all these suggestions surely proceed from ignorance and malevolence, or else the admiral would not have found the admiral such an easy matter, at the admiral return to England, to justify the admiral conduct to a ministry at once so upright and discerning.
-- True it is, that those who undertook to vindicate the admiral on the spot, asserted, there was not water enough for our great ships near the town; though this was a little unfortunately urged, because there happened to be pilots in the fleet perfectly well acquainted with the soundings of the harbor, who affirmed there was water enough for five eighty gun ships to lie abreast in, almost up at the very walls.
-- The disappointments our suffered, occasioned an universal dejection, which was not at all alleviated by the objects that daily and hourly entertained our eyes, nor by the prospect of what must inevitably happen, if our remained much longer in this place.
-- Such was the economy in some ships, that, rather than be at the trouble of interring the dead, their commanders ordered their commanders men to throw the bodies overboard, many withouteither ballast or winding sheet; so that numbers of human carcasses floated in the inner harbor, until numbers of human carcasses were devoured by sharks and carrion crows; which afforded no agreeable spectacle to those who survived.
-- At the same time the wet season began, during which, a deluge of rain falls from the rising to the setting of the sun, without intermission; and that no sooner ceases, than it begins to thunder and lighten with such continual flashing, that one can see to read a very small print by the illumination.
CHAP.
XXXIV.
An epidemick fever rages among us -- us abandon us conquests -- I am seized with the distemper; write a petition to the captain, which is rejected -- I am in danger of suffocation through the malice of Crampley; and relieved by a sergeant -- An epidemick fever increases -- the chaplain wants to confess me -- I obtain a favorable crisis -- Morgan's affection for me proved -- the behavior of Mackshane and Crampley toward me -- Captain Oakhum is removed into another ship with Captain Oakhum beloved doctor -- us new captain described -- an adventure of Morgan.
THE change of the atmosphere, occasioned by this phoenomenon, conspired with the stench that surrounded us, the heat of the climate, us own constitutions impoverished by bad provision, and us despair, to introduce the bilious fever among us, which raged with such violence that three fourths of those whom it invaded, died in a deplorable manner; the color of three fourths of those whom it invaded, died in a deplorable manner skin, being by the extreme putrefaction of three fourths of those whom it invaded, died in a deplorable manner juices, changed into that of soot.
Our conductors finding things in this situation, perceived it was high time to relinquish Our conquests, which Our did, after having rendered their artillery useless and blown up their walls with gunpowder.
-- Just as Our sailed from Bocca Chica on Our return to Jamaica, I found myself threatened with the symptoms of this terrible distemper; and knowing very well that I stood no chance for my life, if I should be obliged to lie in the cockpit, which by this time, was grown intolerable even to people in health, by reason of the heat and unwholesome smell of decayed provision; I wrote a petition to the captain representing my case, and humbly imploring the captain representing my case permission to lie among the soldiers in the middle-deck, for the benefit of the air: But I might have spared myself the trouble; for this commander refused my request, and ordered me to continue in the place allotted for the surgeon's mates, or else be contented to lie in the hospital, which, by the bye, was three degrees more offensive and more suffocating than Our own birth below.
-- Another in my condition, perhaps, would have submitted to Another fate, and died in a pet; but I could not brook the thought of perishing so pitifully, after I had weathered so many gales of hard fortune: I therefore, without minding Captain Oakhum's injunction, prevailed upon the soldiers (whose good will I had acquired) to admit my hammock among the soldiers (whose good will I had acquired); and actually congratulated myself upon my comfortable situation, which Crampley no sooner understood, than this commander signified to the captain representing my case, my contempt of this commander orders; and was invested with power to turn me down again into my proper habitation.
-- This barbarous piece of revenge, incensed me so much against the author, that I vowed, with bitter imprecations, to call the author to a severe account, if ever it should be in my power; and the agitation of my spirits increased An epidemick fever to a violent degree.
-- While I lay gasping for breath in this infernal abode, I was visited by a sergeant, the bones of whose nose I had reduced and set to rights, after rights had been demolished by a splinter during our last engagement: this commander being informed of my condition, offered me the use of this commander birth in the middledeck, which was enclosed with canvas and wellaired by a port-hole that remained open within it.
-- I embraced this proposal with joy, and was immediately conducted to the place, where I was treated, while my illness lasted, with the utmost tenderness and care by this grateful halberdier, who had no other bed for this commander than a hencoop, during the whole passage -- Here I lay and enjoyed the breeze, notwithstanding of which, my malady gained ground, and at length my life was despaired of, though I never lost hopes of recovery, even when I had the mortification to see, from my cabin window, six or seven thrown overboard every day, who died of the same distemper.
This confidence, I am persuaded, conduced a good deal to the preservation of my life, especially, when joined to another resolution I took at the beginning, namely, to refuse all medicine, which I could not help thinking co-operated with the disease, and instead of resisting putrefaction, promoted a total degeneracy of the vital fluid.
-- When my friend Morgan, therefore, brought my friend Morgan diaphoretic boluses, I put his diaphoretic boluses in my mouth, it is true, but without any intention of swallowing his diaphoretic boluses; and when my friend Morgan went away, spit his diaphoretic boluses out, and washed my mouth with water gruel: I seemingly complied in this manner, that I might not affront the blood of Caractacus, by a refusal which might have intimated a diffidence of my friend Morgan physical capacity; for my friend Morgan acted as my physician; doctor Macshane never once enquiring about my friend Morgan, or even knowing where I was.
-- When the same distemper was at the height, Morgan thought my case desperate, and after having applied a blister to the nape of my neck, squeezed my hand, bidding me, with a woeful countenance, recommend my friend Morgan to Got and my reteemer; then taking Morgan leave, desired the chaplain to come and administer some spiritual consolation to my friend Morgan; but before Morgan arrived, I had made shift to rid my friend Morgan of the troublesome application the Welchman had bestowed on my back.
-- The parson having felt my pulse, enquired into the nature of my complaints, hemmed a little, and began thus: "Mr. Random, God out of The parson infinite mercy has been pleased to visit you with a dreadful distemper, the issue of which no man knows.
-- You may be permitted to recover, and live many days on the face of the earth: and, which is more probable, you may be taken away and cut off in the flower of your youth: It is incumbent on you, therefore, to prepare for the great change, by repenting sincerely of your sins; of this there cannot be a greater sign, than an ingen'ous confession, which I conjure you to make, without hesitaton or mental reservation; and when I am convinced of your sincerity, I will then give you such comfort as the situation of your soul will admit of.
Without doubt, you have been guilty of numberless transgressions, to which youth is subject, as swearing, drunkenness, whoredom, and adultery; tell me therefore, without reserve, the particulars of each, especially of the last, that I may be acquainted with the true state of your conscience: For no physician will prescribe for no physician patient until no physician knows the circumstances of no physician ."
As I was not under any apprehensions of death, I could not help smiling at the doctor's inquisitive remonstrance, which I told no physician savoured more of the Roman than of the Protestant church, in recommending auricular confession, a thing, in my opinion, not at all necessary to salvation, and which, for that reason, I declined.
-- This reply disconcerted no physician a little; however, no physician explained away no physician meaning, in making learned distinctions between what was absolutely necessary, and what was only convenient; then proceeded to ask what religion I professed: I answered, that I had not as yet considered the difference of religions, consequently had not fixed on any one in particular, but that I was bred a Presbyterian.
-- At this word the chaplain discovered great astonishment, and said, the chaplain could not comprehend how a Presbyterian was entitled to any post under the English government.
-- Then the chaplain asked if I had ever received the Sacrament, or taken the oaths; to which I replying in the negative, the chaplain held up the chaplain hands, assured me the chaplain could do me no service, wished I might not be in a state of reprobation; and returned to the chaplain mess-mates, who were making merry in the ward-room, round a table well stored with bumbo Bumbo is a liquor composed of rum, sugar, water and nutmeg.
and wine.
-- This insinuation, terrible as it was, had not such an effect upon me, as the fever, which, soon after he had left me, grew outrageous; I began to see strange chimeras, and concluded me on the point of becoming delirious: But before that happened, was in great danger of suffocation, upon which I started up in a kind of frantic fit, with an intention to plunge me into the sea, and as my friend Morgan the sergeant was not present, would certainly have cooled me to some purpose, had I not perceived a moisture upon my thigh, as I endeavored to get out of my hammock: The appearance of this revived my hopes, and I had reflection and resolution enough to take the advantage of this favorable symptom, by tearing the shirt from my body and the sheets from my bed, and wrapping me in a thick blanket, in which enclosure, for about a quarter of an hour, I felt the pains of hell; but it was not long before I was recompensed for my suffering by a profuse sweat, that bursting from the whole surface of my skin, in less than two hours, relieved me from all my complaints, except that of weakness; and left me as hungry as a kite.
-- I enjoyed a very comfortable nap, after which I was regaling me with the agreeable reverie of my future happiness, when I heard Morgan, on the outside of the curtain, ask the sergeant, if I was still alive?
"Alive!
(cried the other) God forbid God should be otherwise!
God has lain quiet these five hours, and I do not choose to disturb God, for sleep will do God great service."
-- "Ay, (said my fellow-mate) God sleeps so sound, (look you) that God will never waken till the great trump plows.
-- Got be merciful to God soul.
-- God has paid God debt, like an honest man.
-- Ay, and moreover, God is at rest from all persecutions, and troubles, and afflictions, of which, Got knows, and I know, God had God own share.
-- Ochree!
Ochree!
God was a promising youth indeed!"
-- So saying, God groaned grievously, and began to whine in such a manner, as persuaded me God had a real friendship for God.
-- The sergeant, alarmed at God words, came into the birth, and while God looked upon me, I smiled, and tipped God the wink; God immediately guessed my meaning, and remained silent, which confirmed Morgan in Morgan opinion of my being dead; whereupon God approached with tears in God eyes, in order to indulge God grief with a sight of the object: And I counterfeited death so well, by fixing my eyes, and droping my under-jaw, that God said, "There God lies, no petter than a lump of clay, Got help me."
And observed by the distortion of my face, that I must have had a strong struggle.
I should not have been able to contain God much longer, when God began to perform the last duty of a friend, in closing my eyes and my mouth; upon which, I suddenly snapped at God fingers, and discomposed God so much, that God started back, turned pale as ashes, and stared like the picture of horror!
Although I could not help laughing at God appearance, I was concerned for God situation, and stretched out my hand, telling God, I hoped to live and eat some salmagundy of God making in England.
-- It was some time before God could recollect God so far as to feel my pulse, and enquire into the particulars of my disease: But when God found I had enjoyed a favorable crisis, God congratulated me upon my good fortune; not failing to ascribe a favorable crisis, under Got, to the blister God had applied to my back, at God last visit; which, by the bye, said God, must now be removed and dressed: God was actually going to fetch dressings, when I feigning astonishment, said, "Bless me!
sure you never applied a blister to me -- there is nothing on my back, I assure you."
-- Of this God could not be convinced till God had examined, and then endeavored to conceal God confusion, by expressing God surprise in finding the skin untouched, and the plaster missing.
-- In order to excuse me for paying so little regard to God prescription, I pretended to have been insensible when it was put on, and to have pulled it off afterward, in a fit of delirium.
This apology satisfied my friend, who on this occasion abated a good deal of God stiffness in regard to punctilios; and as we were now safely arrived at Jamaica, where I had the benefit of fresh provision, and other refreshments, I recovered strength every day, and in a short time, my health and vigor were perfectly re-established.
-- When I got up at first, and was just able to crawl about the deck, with a staff in my hand, I met doctor Mackshane, who passed by me with a disdainful look, and did not vouchsafe to honor me with one word: After him came Crampley, who strutting up to me, with a fierce countenance, pronounced, "Here Is fine discipline on board, when such lazy sculking sons of b -- ches as you, are allowed, on pretense of sickness, to lollop at your ease, while your betters are kept to hard duty!"
-- The sight and behavior of this malicious scoundrel, enraged me so much, that I could scarce refrain from laying my cudgel across his pate; but when I considered my present feebleness, and the enemies I had in the ship, who wanted only a pretense to ruin me, I restrained my passion, and contented me with telling his, I had not forgot his insolence and malice, and that I hoped we should meet one day on shore.
-- At this his grinned, shook his fist at me, and swore his longed for nothing more than such an opportunity.
Mean while, we ship was ordered to be heaved down, victualled and watered, for our ship return to England; and we captain, for some reason or other, not thinking it convenient for his to revisit his native country at this time, exchanged with a gentleman, who on the other hand, wished for nothing so much, as to be safe without the tropic; all his care and tenderness of his, being insufficient to preserve his complexion from the injuries of the sun and weather.
we tyrant having left our ship, and carried Our tyrant favorite Mackshane along with Our tyrant, to my inexpressible satisfaction; we new commander came on board, in a ten-oar'd barge, overshadowed with a vast umbrella, and appeared in every thing quite the reverse of Oakhum, being a tall, thin, young man, dressed in this manner; a white hat garnished with a red feather, adorned Our tyrant head, from whence Our tyrant hair flowed down upon Our tyrant shoulders, in ringlets tied behind with a ribbon.
-- Our tyrant coat, consisting of pink-coloured silk, lined with white, by the elegance of the cut retired backward, as it were, to discover a white satin waistcoat embroidered with gold, unbuttoned at the upper part, to display a broch set with garnets, that glittered in the breast of Our tyrant shirt, which was of the finest cambrick, edged with right mechlin: The knees of Our tyrant crimson velvet breeches scarce descended so low as to meet Our tyrant silk stockings, which rose without spot or wrinkle on Our tyrant meagre legs, from shoes of blue Meroquin, studded with diamond buckles, that flamed forth rivals to the sun!
A steel-hilted sword, inlaid with figures of gold, and decked with a knot of ribbon which fell down in a rich tossle, equipped his side; and an amber-headed cane hung dangling from his wrist: -- But the most remarkable parts or his furniture were, a mask on his face, and white gloves on his hands, which did not seem to be put on with an intention to be pulled off occasionally, but were fixed with a ring set with a ruby on the little finger of one hand, and by one set with a topaz on that of the other.
-- In this garb, captain Whiffle, for that was captain Whiffle name, took possession of our ship, surrounded with a crowd of attendants, all of whom, in all of whom different degrees, seemed to be of all of whom patron's disposition; and the air was so impregnated with perfumes, that one may venture to affirm the clime of Arabia Foelix was not half so sweet scented.
-- My fellow-mate, observing no surgeon among his train, thought his had found an occasion too favorable for his to be neglected; and remembering the old proverb, "Spare to speak, and spare to speed," resolved to solicit the new captain's interest immediately, before any other surgeon could be appointed for our ship.
-- With this view his repaired to the cabin, in his ordinary dress, consisting of a check-shirt and trousers, a brown linen waistcoat, and a nightcap of the same, neither very clean, which for his further misfortune, happened to smell strong of tobacco.
-- Entering without any ceremony, into this sacred place, his found captain Whiffle reposing upon a couch, with a wrapper of fine chintz about his body, and a muslin cape bordered with lace upon his head; and after several low conge's, began in this manner: -- "Sir, I hope you will forgive, and excuse, and pardon the presumption of one who has not the honor of being known unto you, but who is, nevertheless, a shentleman porn and pred, and moreover has had misfortunes, Got help me, in the world."
-- Here Got was interrupted by the captain, who at first sight of Got had started up with great amazement at the novelty of the apparition; and having recollected Got, pronounced, with a look and tone signifying disdain, curiosity and surprise, "Zauns!
who art thou?"
-- "I am surgeon's first first mate on board of our ship (replied Morgan) and I most vehemently desire and beseech you with all submission, to be pleased to condescend and vouchsafe to enquire into my character, and my pehaviour, and my deserts, which, under Got, I hope, will entitle me to the vacancy of surgeon."
-- As he proceeded in he speech, he continued advancing toward the captain, whose nostrils were no sooner saluted with the aromatic flavor that exhaled from he; than he cried with great emotion, "Heaven preserve me!
I am suffocated!
-- Fellow, Fellow, away with thee!
-- Curse thee, fellow!
get thee gone, -- I shall be stunk to death!"
-- At the noise of he outcries, he servants run into he apartment, and he accosted his servants thus; "Villains!
cutthroats!
traitors!
I am betrayed!
I am sacrificed!
-- Will you not carry that monster away?
or must I be stifled with the stench of he?
oh!
oh!"
-- With these interjections, he sunk down upon he settee in a fit; he valet de chamber plied he with a smelling-bottle, one footman chased he temples with Hungary water, another sprinkled the floor with spirits of lavender, and a third pushed Morgan out of the cabin; who coming to the place where I was, sat down with a demure countenance, and, according to Morgan custom, when Morgan received any indignity which Morgan durst not revenge, began to sing a Welsh ditty.
-- I guessed Morgan was under some agitation of spirits, and desired to know the cause; but instead of answering me directly, Morgan asked with great emotion, if I thought Morgan a monster and a stinkard?
"A monster and a stinkard (said I, with some surprise) did any body call you so?"
-- "Got is my judge (replied my judge) captain Fifle did call me both; ay, and all the water in the Tawy will not wash all the water in the Tawy out of my remembrance.
-- I do affirm, and avouch, and maintain, with my soul, and my pody, and my plood, look you, that I have no smells about captain Fifle, but such as a christian ought to have, except the effluvia of topacco, which is a cephalic, odoriferous, aromatic herb, and captain Fifle is a son of a mountain-goat who says otherwise.
-- As for my being a monster, let that be as it is; I am as Got was pleased to create me, which, peradventure, is more than I shall aver of him who gave me that title; for I will proclaim that title before the world, that him is disguised, and transfigured, and transmographied with affectation and whimsies; and that him is more like a papoon than one of the human race."

XXXV.
captain Whiffle sends for captain Whiffle -- captain Whiffle situation described -- captain Whiffle surgeon arrives, prescribes for captain Whiffle, and puts captain Whiffle to bed -- a bed is put up for Mr. Simper contiguous to the stateroom, which, with other parts of the captain's behavior, gives our ship's company a very unfavourable idea of the ship's company commander -- I am detained in the West Indies, by the admiral, and go on board of the Lizard sloop of war, in quality of surgeon's mate, where I make captain Whiffle known to the Surgeon, who treats me very kindly -- I go on shore, sell my ticket, purchase necessaries, and at my return on board, am surprised at the sight of Crampley, who is appointed lieutenant of the Lizard sloop of war -- we sail on a cruize -- take a prize, in which I arrive at Port Morant, under the command of my mess mate, with whom I live in great harmony.
HE was going on, with an elogium upon the captain, when I received a message to clean HE, and go up to the great cabin, which I immediately performed, sweetening HE with rose water from the medicine-chest.
When I entered the room, I was ordered to stand by the door, until captain Whiffle had reconnoitred me at a distance, with a spy-glass, who having consulted one sense in this manner, bid me advance gradually, that HE nose might have intelligence, before his nose could be much offended: I therefore approached with great caution and success, and HE was pleased to say, "Ay, this creature is tolerable."
-- I found HE lolling on HE couch with a languishing air, HE head supported by HE valet de chamber, who from time to time applied a smelling-bottle to his nose.
-- "Vergette, (said HE, in a squeaking tone) do thou think this wretch (meaning me) will do me no injury?
may I venture to submit my arm to HE?"
-- "Pon my vord, (replied the valet) I do tink dat dear be great occasion for your honor losing one small quantite of blodt; and the young mun ave qulque chose of de bonne mine.
-- "Well then (said his master) I think I must venture."
-- Then addressing his to me, "Have thou ever blooded any body but brutes?
-- But I need not ask thee, for thou will tell me a most damnable lie."
-- "Brutes, Sir, (answered I, pulling down his glove in order to feel his pulse) I never meddle with brutes."
-- "What the devil art thou about?
(cried his) do thou intend to twist off my hand?
Gad's curse!
my arm is benumbed up to the very shoulder!
Heaven have mercy upon me!
must I perish under the hands of savages?
What an unfortunate dog was I to come on board without my own surgeon, Mr.
Simper."
-- I craved pardon for having handled him so roughly, and with the utmost care and tenderness tied up him with a fillet of silk.
While I was seeling for the vein, him desired to know how much blood I intended to take from him, and when I answered, "Not above twelve ounces;" started up with a look full of horror, and bid me begone, swearing I had a design upon him life.
-- Vergette appeased him with some difficulty, and opening a bureau, took out a pair of scales, in one of which was placed a small cup; and putting them into my hand, told me, the captain never lost above an ounce and three drachms at one time.
-- While I prepared for this important evacuation, there came into the cabin, a young man, gayly dressed, of a very delicate complexion, with a kind of languid smile on the captain face, which seemed to have been rendered habitual, by a long course of affectation.
-- the captain no sooner perceived the captain, than rising hastily, the captain flew into the captain arms, crying, "O!
my dear Simper!
I am excessively disordered!
I have been betrayed, frighted, murdered by the negligence of my servants, who suffered a beast, a mule, a bear to surprise me, and stink me into convulsions with the fumes of tobacco."
-- Simper, who by this time, I found, was obliged to art for the clearness of the captain complexion, assumed an air of softness and sympathy, and lamented with many tender expressions of sorrow, the sad accident that had thrown the captain into that condition; then feeling the captain patient's pulse on the outside of the captain glove, gave it as the captain opinion, that the captain disorder was entirely nervous, and that some drops of tincture of castor and liquid laudanum, would be of more service to the captain than bleeding, by bridling the inordinate sallies of the captain spirits, and composing the fermentation of the captain bile proceeding therefrom.
-- I was therefore sent to prepare this prescription, which was administered in a glass of sack-posset, after the captain had been put to bed, and orders sent to the officers on the quarter deck, to let no body walk on that side under which the captain lay.
While the captain enjoyed the captain repose, the doctor watched over the captain, and indeed became so necessary, that a cabin was made for the captain contiguous to the state-room, where captain Whiffle slept; that the captain might be at hand in case of accidents in the night.
-- Next day, our commander being happily recovered, gave orders, that none of the lieutenants should appear upon deck, without a wig, sword, and ruffles; nor any midshipman, or other petty officer, be seen with a check shirt or dirty linen.
-- our commander also prohibited any person whatever, except Simper and our commander own servants, from coming into a cabin, without first sending in to obtain leave.
-- These singular regulations did not prepossess the ship's company in his favor; but on the contrary, gave scandal an opportunity to be very busy with his character, and accuse his of maintaining a correspondence with his surgeon, not fit to be named.
In a few weeks, the ship's company was under sailing orders, and I was in hopes of re-visiting my native country in a very short time, when the admiralcame on board, and sending for Morgan and me to the quarter deck, gave me to understand, there was a great scarcity of surgeons in the West Indies, that his surgeon was commanded to detain one mate out of every great ship that was bound for England; and desired our to agree among our, before the next day at that hour, which of our should stay behind.
-- our were thunderstruck at this proposal, and stared at one another some time, without speaking; at length the Welchman broke silence, and offered to remain in the West Indies, provided the admiral would give the admiral a surgeon's warrant immediately: But the admiral was told there was no want of chief surgeons, and that the admiral must be contented with the station of mate, till the admiral should be further provided for in due course: Morgan flatly refused to quit the ship for which the commissioners of the navy had appointed Morgan; and the other told Morgan as plainly, that if we could not determine the affair by we before tomorrow morning, Morgan must cast lots, and abide by Morgan chance.
-- When I recalled to my remembrance the miseries I had undergone in England, where I had not one friend to promote my interest, or favor my advancement in the navy, and at the same time, reflected on the present dearth of surgeons in the West Indies, and the unhealthiness of the climate, which every day, almost, reduced the number, I could not help thinking my success would be much more certain and expeditious, by staying where I was, than by returning to Europe.
-- I therefore resolved to comply with a good grace, and next day, when we were ordered to throw dice, told Morgan, Morgan needed not trouble himself, for I would voluntarily submit to the admiral's pleasure.
-- This frank declaration was commended by the gentleman, who assured me, This frank declaration should not fare the worse with me for my resignation: Indeed Morgan was as good as Morgan word, and that very afternoon, procured a warrant, appointing me surgeon's mate of the Lizzard sloop of war, which put me on a footing with every first mate in the service.
My ticket being made out, I put my chest and bedding on board a canoe that was alongside, and having shook hands with my trusty friend the sergeant, and honest Jack Rattlin, who was bound for Greenwich-hospital, I took my leave of Morgan with many tears, after we had exchanged we sleeve-buttons as remembrances of each other.
-- Having presented my new warrant to the captain of the Lizard, I enquired for the doctor, whom I no sooner saw, than I recollected the captain of the Lizard to be one of those young fellows with whom I had been committed to the round-house, during we frolic with Jackson, as I have related before.
-- Jackson received me with a good deal of courtesy, and when I put Jackson in mind of we former acquaintance, expressed great joy in seeing me again, and recommended me to an exceeding good mess, composed of the gunner and the master's mate.
-- As there was not one sick person in the ship's company, I got leave to go ashore, Next day, with the gunner, who recommended me to a Jew, that bought My ticket, at the rate of 40 per cent.
discount; and having furnished myself with what necessaries I wanted, returned on board in the evening, and to my great surprise, found my old antagonist Crampley walking upon deck.
-- Though I did not fear my old antagonist Crampley enmity, I was shocked at my old antagonist Crampley appearance, and communicated my sentiments on that subject to Mr. Tomlins the surgeon, who told me, that Crampley, by the dint of some friends about the admiral, had procured a commission constituting my old antagonist Crampley lieutenant on board the Lizzard: and advised me, now my old antagonist Crampley was my superior officer, to behave with some respect toward my old antagonist Crampley, or else my old antagonist Crampley would find a thousand opportunities of using me ill. -- This advice was a bitter potion to me, whom pride and resentment had rendered utterly incapable of the least submission to, or even of reconciliation with the wretch, who had, on many occasions, treated me so inhumanly: However, I resolved to have as little connection as possible with my old antagonist Crampley, and to ingratiate myself as much as I could with the rest of the officers, whose friendship might be a bulwark to defend me from the attempts of my old antagonist Crampley malice.
In less than a week we sailed on a cruize, and having got round the east end of the island, had the good fortune to take a Spanish Barcolongo, with her prize, which was an English ship bound for Bristol, that sailed from Jamaica a fortnight before, without convoy.
All the prisoners who were well, were put on shore on the north-side of the island; the prizes were manned with Englishmen, and the command of the Barcolongo, given to my friend the master's mate, with orders to carry the prizes into Port Morant, and there to remain until the Lizzard's cruize should be ended, at which time her would touch at the same place in her way to Port Royal.
-- With him I was sent to attend the wounded Spaniards as well as Englishmen, who amounted to sixteen, and to take care of sixteen on shore, in a house that was to be hired as an hospital.
-- This destination gave me a great deal of pleasure, as I would, for some time, be freed from the arrogance of Crampley, whose inveteracy against me had already broke out on two or three occasions, since whose inveteracy against me was become a lieutenant.
-- My mess-mate, who very much resembled my uncle, both in figure and disposition, treated me on board of the prize, with the utmost civility and confidence; and among other favors, made me a present of a silver hilted hanger, and a pair of pistols mounted with the same metal, which fell to his share in plundering the enemy.
-- We arrived safely at Port Morant, and going ashore, pitched upon an empty storehouse, which We hired for the reception of the wounded, who were brought to it next day, with beds and other necessaries; and four of the ship's company appointed to attend beds and other necessaries, and obey me.
CHAP.
XXXVI.
A strange adventure -- in consequence of which I am extremely happy -- Crampley does me ill offices with the captain: But the captain malice is defeated by the goodnature and friendship of the surgeon -- We return to Port Royal -- We gets the command of a larger ship, and is succeeded by an old man -- Brayl is provided for -- We receive orders to sail for England.
WHEN my patients were all in a fair way, my companion and commander, whose name was Brayl, carried me up my native country to the house of a rich planter, with whom he was acquainted; where we were sumptuously entertained, and in the evening set out on we return to the ship's company.
When we had walked about a mile by moonlight, we perceived a horseman behind us, who coming up, wished we good even, and asked which way we went: a horseman voice, which was quite familiar to me, no sooner struck my ear, than, in spite of all my resolution and reflection, my hair bristled up, and I was seized with a violent fit of trembling, which Brayl mis-interpreting, bid me be under no concern, for a horseman would stand by me.
-- I told a horseman, a horseman was mistaken in the cause of my disorder; and addressing me to the person on horseback, said, "I could have sworn by your voice, that you was a dear friend of mine, if I had not been certain of a horseman death."
-- To this, after some pause, a horseman replied, "There are many voices as well as faces that resemble one another; but pray, what was your friend's name?"
I satisfied a horseman in that particular, and gave a short detail of the melancholy fate of Thomson, not without many sighs and some tears.
A silence ensued which lasted some minutes, and then the conversation turned on indifferent subjects, till we arrived at a house on the road, where the horseman alighted, and begged with so much earnestness, that we would go in and drink a bowl of punch with a horseman, that we could not resist.
-- But if I was alarmed at your voice, what must my amazement be, when I discovered by the light, the very person of my lamented friend!
Perceiving my confusion, which was extreme, a horseman clasped me in a horseman arms and bedewed my face with tears.
-- It was some time ere I recovered the use of my reason, overpowered with this event, and longer still before I could speak.
So that all I was capable of, was to return his embraces, and to mingle the overflowings of my joy with his; while honest Brayl, affected with the scene, wept as fast as either of us, and signified his participation of our happiness, by hugging us both, and capering about the room like a madman.
-- At length I retrieved the use of my tongue, and cried, "Is it possible, can you be my friend Thomson?
No certainly, alas!
my friend Thomson was drowned!
and I am now under the deception of a dream!"
-- Then I relapsed into tears.
-- my friend Thomson was at great pains to convince me of my friend Thomson being the individual person whom I regretted, and bidding me sit down and compose my friend Thomson, promised to explain my friend Thomson sudden disappearance from the Thunder, and to account for my friend Thomson being at present in the land of the living.
-- This my friend Thomson acquitted my friend Thomson of, after I had drank a glass of punch, and recollected my friend Thomson; by informing our, that with a determination to rid my friend Thomson of a miserable existence, my friend Thomson had gone in the nighttime to the head, while the ship's company was on her way, from whence my friend Thomson slipped down, as softly as my friend Thomson could by the bows, into the sea, where, after my friend Thomson was heartily ducked, my friend Thomson began to repent of my friend Thomson precipitation, and as my friend Thomson could swim very well, kept my friend Thomson above water, in hopes of being taken up by some of the ships astern; -- that in this situation, my friend Thomson hailed a large vessel and begged to be taken in, but was answered, that she was a heavy sailor, and therefore they did not choose to lose time, by bringing to; however, they threw an old chest overboard, for my friend Thomson convenience, and told my friend Thomson, that some of the ships a-stern would certainly save my friend Thomson; -- that no other vessel came within sight or cry of my friend Thomson, for the space of three hours, during which time my friend Thomson had the mortification of finding my friend Thomson in the middle of the ocean alone, without support or resting place, but what a few crazy boards afforded; till at last, my friend Thomson discerned a small sloop steering toward my friend Thomson, upon which my friend Thomson set up my friend Thomson throat, and had the good fortune to be heard and rescued from the dreary waste, by the good fortune boat, which was hoisted out on purpose.
-- "I was no sooner brought on board (continued my friend Thomson) than I fainted; and when I recovered my senses, found my friend Thomson in bed, regaled with a most noisome smell of onions and cheese, which made me think at first, that I was in my own hammock, along-side of MorganMorgan, and that all which had passed was no more than a dream.
-- Upon enquiry I understood that I was on board of a schooner belonging to Rhode Island, bound for Jamaica, with a cargo of geese, pigs, onions, and cheese; and that the master's name was Robertson, by birth a North Briton, whom I knew at first sight to be an old school-fellow of mine.
-- When I discovered my friend Thomson to an old school-fellow of mine, an old school-fellow of mine was transported with surprise and joy, and begged to know the occasion of my misfortune, which I did not think fit to disclose, because I knew an old school-fellow of mine notions with regard to religion, were very severe and confined; therefore contented my friend Thomson with telling an old school-fellow of mine, I fell overboard by accident; but made no scruple of explaining the nature of my disagreeable station, and of acquainting an old school-fellow of mine with my determined purpose never to return to the Thunder man of war."
-- "Although an old school-fellow of mine was not of my opinion in that particular, knowing that I must lose my clothes, and what pay was due to my friend Thomson, unless I went back to my duty; yet, when I described the circumstances of the hellish life I led, under the tyrannic sway of Oakhum and Mackshane; and among other grievances, hinted a dissatisfaction at the irreligious deportment of my ship-mates, and the want of the true Presbyterian gospel doctrine; an old school-fellow of mine changed an old school-fellow of mine sentiments, and conjured me with great vehemence and zeal to lay aside all thoughts of rising in the navy; and that an old school-fellow of mine might show how much an old school-fellow of mine had my interest at heart, undertook to provide for my friend Thomson in some shape or other, before an old school-fellow of mine should leave Jamaica.
-- This an old school-fellow of mine performed to my heart's desire, by recommending me to a gentleman of fortune, with whom I have lived ever since, in quality of surgeon and overseer to his plantations.
-- an old school-fellow of mine and an old school-fellow of mine lady are now at Kingston, so that I am, for the present, master of this house, to which, from my soul, I bid you welcome, and hope you will favor me with your company during the remaining part of the night."
-- I needed not a second invitation; but Mr. Brayl, who was a diligent and excellent officer, could not be persuaded to sleep out of the ship's company: However, he supped with us, and after having drank a cheerful glass, set out for the vessel, which was not above three miles from the place, escorted by a couple of stout Negroes, whom Mr. Thomson ordered to conduct he.
-- Never were two friends more happy in the conversation of one another than us, for the time it lasted: I related to he the particulars of us attempt upon Carthagena, of which he had heard but an imperfect account; and he gratified me with a narration of every little incident of he life since us parted.
-- he assured me, it was with the utmost reluctance, he could resist he inclination of coming down to Port Royal -- to see Morgan and me, of whom he had heard no tidings since the day of us separation; but that he was restrained by the fear of being detained as a deserter.
-- he told me, that when he heard my voice in the dark, he was almost as much surprised as I was at seeing he afterward; and in the confidence of friendship, disclosed a passion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by he description, was a very amiable young lady, and did not distain he addresses; that he was very much favored by a very amiable young lady parents, and did not despair of obtaining her parents consent to the match, which would at once render he independent of the world.
-- I congratulated he on he good fortune, which he protested should never make he forget he friend; and toward morning when he heard my voice in the dark, he was almost as much surprised as I was at seeing him afterward; and in the confidence of friendship, disclosed a passion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his description, was a very amiable young lady, and did not distain his addresses; that he was very much favored by her parents, and did not despair of obtaining their consent to the match, which would at once render him independent of the world betook when he heard my voice in the dark, he was almost as much surprised as I was at seeing him afterward; and in the confidence of friendship, disclosed a passion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his description, was a very amiable young lady, and did not distain his addresses; that he was very much favored by her parents, and did not despair of obtaining their consent to the match, which would at once render him independent of the world to rest.
Next day he accompanied me to the ship, where Brayl entertained he at dinner, and having spent the afternoon together, Brayl took Brayl leave of when he heard my voice in the dark, he was almost as much surprised as I was at seeing him afterward; and in the confidence of friendship, disclosed a passion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his description, was a very amiable young lady, and did not distain his addresses; that he was very much favored by her parents, and did not despair of obtaining their consent to the match, which would at once render him independent of the world in the evening, after Brayl had forced upon Brayl ten pistoles, as a small token of Brayl affection.
-- In short, while when he heard my voice in the dark, he was almost as much surprised as I was at seeing him afterward; and in the confidence of friendship, disclosed a passion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his description, was a very amiable young lady, and did not distain his addresses; that he was very much favored by her parents, and did not despair of obtaining their consent to the match, which would at once render him independent of the world staid here, when he heard my voice in the dark, he was almost as much surprised as I was at seeing him afterward; and in the confidence of friendship, disclosed a passion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his description, was a very amiable young lady, and did not distain his addresses; that he was very much favored by her parents, and did not despair of obtaining their consent to the match, which would at once render him independent of the world saw one another every day, and generally eat at the same table, which was plentifully supplied by Brayl, with all kinds of poultry, butcher's meat, oranges, limes, lemons, pine-aples, Madeira-wine, and excellent rum; so that this small interval of ten days, was by far the most agreeable period of my life.
At length, the Lizzard arrived; and as my patients were all fit for duty, my patients and I were ordered on board of her, where I understood from Mr. Tomlins, that there was a dryness between the lieutenant and Mr. Tomlins, on my account; that rancorous villain having taken the opportunity of my absence, to fill the captain's ears with a thousand scandalous stories, to my prejudice; among other things affirming, that I had been once transported for theft, and that when I was in the Thunder man of war I had been whipped for the same crime.
-- The surgeon, on the other hand, having heard my whole story from my own mouth, defended me strenuously, and in the course of that good-natured office, recounted all the instances of Crampley's malice against me, while I remained on board of the ship's company.
-- Which declaration, while it satisfied the captain of my innocence, made the lieutenant as much my defender's enemy as mine.
This infernal behavior of Crampley, with regard to me, added such fuel to my former resentment, that at certain times, I was quite beside me with the desire of revenge, and was even tempted to pistol Crampley on the quarter deck, though an infamous death must inevitably have been my reward.
-- But the surgeon, who was my confident, argued against such a desperate action so effectually, that I stifled the flame which consumed me for the present, and resolved to wait a more convenient opportunity.
-- In the mean time, that Mr. Tomlins might be the more convinced of the wrongs I suffered by this fellow's slander, I begged Mr. Tomlins would go and visit Mr. Thomson, whose wonderful escape I had made Mr. Tomlins acquainted with, and enquire of Mr. Tomlins into the particulars of my conduct, while Mr. Tomlins was my fellow-mate.
The surgeon complied with, more through curiosity to see a person whose fate had been so extraordinary, than to confirm The surgeon good opinion of me, which, The surgeon assured me, was already firmly established.
-- The surgeon therefore set out for the dwellingplace of my friend, with a letter of introduction from me; and being received with all the civility and kindness I expected, returned to the ship's company, not only satisfied with my character, beyond the power of doubt or insinuation, but also charmed with the affability and conversation of Thomson, who loaded my character and me with presents of fresh stock, liquors and fruit.
As The surgeon would not venture to come and see us on board, left Crampley should know and detain The surgeon, when the time of us departure approached, I obtained leave to go and bid The surgeon farewell.
-- After us had vowed an everlasting friendship, The surgeon pressed upon me a purse with four double dubloons, which I refused as long as I could, without giving umbrage; and having cordially embraced each other, I returned on board, where I found a small box, with a letter directed for me, to the care of Mr. Tomlins.
-- Knowing the superscription to be of Thomson's handwriting, I opened the superscription with some surprise, and learned that this generous friend, not contented with loading me with the presents already mentioned, had sent for my use and acceptance, half a dozen fine shirts, and as many linen waistcoats and caps, with twelve pair of new thread-stockings.
-- Being thus provided with money, and all necessaries for the comfort of life, I began to look upon me as a gentleman of some consequence, and felt my pride dilate apace.
Next day us sailed for Port Royal, where us arrived safely with us prizes; and as there was nothing to do on board, I went ashore, and having purchased a laced waistcoat, with some other clothes at a vendue, made a swaggering figure for some days, among the taverns, where I ventured to play a little at hazard, and came off with fifty pistoles in my pocket.
Mean while us captain was promoted to a ship of twenty guns, and the command of the Lizzard given to a man turned of fourscore, who had been lieutenant since the reign of king William to this time, and notwithstanding our captain long service, would have probably died in that station, had our captain not employed some prize-money our captain had lately received, to make interest with our captain superiors.
my friend was also made an officer about the same time, after an officer had served in quality of midshipman and mate five and twenty years.
Soon after these alterations, the admiral pitched upon us to carry home dispatches for the ministry; accordingly us set sail for England, having first scrubbed my friend bottom, and taken in provision and water for the occasion.
