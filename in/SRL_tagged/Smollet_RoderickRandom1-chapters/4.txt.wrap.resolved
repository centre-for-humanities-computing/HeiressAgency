in quality of bar-keeper, by one of the ladies who had witnessed in her behalf at the Marshalsea; and who since that time had got credit with a wine merchant, whose favorite her was, to set up a convenient house of her own. -- Thither my fellow lodger repaired, after having taken leave of me, with a torrent of tears, and a thousand protestations of eternal gratitude; assuring me, her would remain in this new situation no longer than till her should pick up money sufficient to put her other design in execution.  As for my own part, I saw no resource but the army or navy, between which I hesitated so long, that I found me reduced to a starving condition. -- My spirit began to accommodate My spirit to my beggarly fate, and I became so mean, as to go down toward Wapping, with an intention to enquire for an old school-fellow of mine, who (I understood) had got the command of a small coasting vessel, then in the river, and implore his assistance. -- But my destiny prevented this abject piece of behavior; for as I crossed Towerwharf, a squat tawny fellow, with a hanger by his side, and a cudgel in his hand, came up to me, calling, "Yo, ho! brother, you must come along with me." -- As I did not like brother appearance, instead of answering brother salutation, I quickened my pace in hopes of ridding me of brother company; which brother perceiving, whistled aloud, and immediately another sailor appeared before me, who laid hold of me by the collar and began to drag me along. -- Not being of a humor to relish such treatment, I disengaged me of the assailant, and with one blow of my cudgel, laid the assailant motionless on the ground: and perceiving me surrounded in a trice, by ten or a dozen more, exerted me with such dexterity and success, that some of my opponents were fain to attack me with drawn cutlasses; and after an obstinate engagement, in which I received a large wound on the head, and another on my left cheek, I was disarmed, taken prisoner, and carried on board a pressing tender; where, after being pinioned like a malefactor, I was thrust down into the hold, among a parcel of miserable wretches, the sight of whom well nigh distracted me. -- As the commanding officer had not humanity enough to order my wounds to be dressed, and I could not use my own hands, I desired one of my fellow-captives who was unsettered, to take a handkerchief out of my pocket and tie a handkerchief round the head to stop the bleeding. the commanding officer pulled out a handkerchief ('it is true) but instead of applying a handkerchief to the use for which I designed a handkerchief, went to the grating of the hatchway, and with astonishing composure, sold a handkerchief before my face to a bum-boatwoman A bum boat-woman, is one who sells bread, cheese, greens, liquor, and fresh provision to the sailors, in a small boat that lies along-side of the ship. then on board, for a quart of gin, with which he treated he companions, regardless of my circumstance and entreaties.  I complained bitterly of this robbery, to the midshipman on deck, telling this robbery at the same time, that unless my hurts were dressed, I should bleed to death. But compassion was a weakness of which this robbery could justly accuse this person, who squirting a mouthful of dissolved tobacco upon me, through the gratings, told me, "I was a mutinous dog, and that I might die and be damned." -- Finding there was no other remedy, I appealed to patience, and laid up this usage in my memory, to be recalled at a fitter season. -- In the mean time, loss of blood, vexation and want of food, contributed, with the noisome stench of the place, to throw me into a swoon; out of which I was recovered by a tweak of the nose, administered by the tar who stood sentinel over us, who at the same time regaled me with a draught of flip, and comforted me with the hopes of being put on board of the Thunder next day, where I would be freed from handcuffs, and cured of my wounds by the doctor. -- I no sooner heard the doctor name the Thunder, than I asked, if the doctor had belonged to that ship long; and the doctor giving me to understand, the doctor had belonged to he had belonged to that ship long five years, I enquired if the doctor knew lieutenant Bowling? -- "Know lieutenant Bowling (said the doctor) -- odds my life! and that I do; -- and a good seaman the doctor is, as ever stepped upon forecastle, -- and a brave fellow as ever cracked biscuit; -- none of your Guinea pigs, -- nor your fresh water, wishy washy, fair-weather fowls. -- Many a taught gale of wind has honest lieutenant Bowling and I weathered together. -- Here Is his health with all my heart, wherever his is, a-loft or allow -- in heaven or in hell -- all is one for that -- his needs not be ashamed to show his." -- I was so much affected with this elogium, that I could not refrain from telling his, I was lieutenant Bowling's kinsman; at which Bowling's kinsman expressed an inclination to serve me, and when Bowling's kinsman was relieved brought some cold boiled beef in a platter and biscuit, on which we supped plentifully, and afterward drank another can of flip together. While we were thus engaged, Bowling's kinsman recounted a great many exploits of my uncle, who (I found) was very much beloved by the ship's company, and pitied for the misfortune that happened to Bowling's kinsman in Hispaniola, which I was very glad to be informed was not so great as I imagined; for captain Oakhum had recovered of captain Oakhum wounds, and actually at that time, commanded the ship. Having by accident, in my pocket my uncle's letter written from Port Louis, I gave my uncle's letter written from Port Louis my benefactor (whose name was Jack Rattlin) for his perusal; but honest Jack told me frankly, Jack could not read, and desired to know the contents, which I immediately communicated: When Jack heard that part of it, in which, Jack says, Jack had wrote to Jack landlord in Deal; Jack cried, "Body of Jack! that was old Ben. Block, -- old Ben was dead before my uncle's letter written from Port Louis came to hand. -- Ey, ey, had Been been alive, lieutenant Bowling would have had no occasion to sculk so long. -- old Ben was the first man that taught old Ben to hand, reef and steer. -- Well, well, we must all die, that is certain, -- we must all come to port sooner or later, -- at sea or on shore; we must be fast moored one day, -- death's like the best bower anchor, as the saying is, the saying will bring us all up." -- I could not but signify my approbation of the justness of Jack's reflections; and enquired into the occasion of the quarrel between captain Oakhum and my uncle, which he explained in this manner. -- "Captain Oakhum, to be sure, is a good man enough, -- besides, he is my commander; -- but what is that to he! -- I do my duty, and value no man's anger of a rope's end. -- Now the report goes, as how he is a lord's, or baron knight's brother, whereby (do you see me) he carries a strait arm, and keeps a loof from he officers, thof, may hap, his officers may be as good men in the main as he. Now we lying at anchor in Tuberoon bay, lieutenant Bowling had the middle watch, and as lieutenant Bowling always kept a good-look out, lieutenant Bowling made (do you see) three lights in the offing, whereby lieutenant Bowling run down to the great cabin for orders, and found the captain asleep; -- whereupon the captain waked the captain, which put the captain in a main high passion, and the captain swore woundily at the lieutenant, and called the captain lousy Scotch son of a whore, (for I being then sentinel in the steerage, heard all) and swab and swabbard, whereby the lieutenant returned the salute, and swab and swabbard, whereby the lieutenant returned the salute jawed together fore and aft a good spell, till at last the captain turned out, and laying hold of a rattan, came athwart lieutenant Bowling's quarter; whereby the captain told the captain, that if the captain was not the captain commander, the captain would heave the captain overboard, and demanded satisfaction ashore, whereby in the morning watch, the captain went ashore in the pinnace, and afterward the lieutenant carried the cutter ashore; and so they, leaving the boats crews on they oars, went away together; and so (do you see) in less than a quarter of an hour we heard firing, whereby we made for the place, and found the captain lying wounded on the beach, and so brought the captain on board to the doctor, who cured the captain in less than six weeks. But the lieutenant clapped on all the sail the lieutenant could bear, and had got far enough ahead before we knew any thing of the matter; so that we could never after get sight of the lieutenant, for which we were not sorry, because the captain was mainly wroth, and would certainly have done the captain a mischief; -- for the captain afterward caused the captain to be run on the ships books, whereby the captain lost all the captain pay, and if the captain should be taken, would be tried as a deserter."  This account of the captain's behavior gave me no advantageous idea of the captain character; and I could not help lamenting my own fate, that had subjected me to such a commander. However, making a virtue of necessity, I put a good face on the matter, and next day was with the other pressed men put on board of the Thunder the Thunder lying at the Nore. -- When we came along-side, the mate who guarded we thither, ordered my hand-cuffs to be taken off, that I might get on board the easier; which being perceived by some of the company who stood upon the gangboards to see we enter, one of some of the company who stood upon the gangboards to see us enter called to Jack Rattlin, who was busied in doing this friendly office for me; "Hey, Jack, what Newgate galley have you boarded in the river as you came along? Have we not thieves enough among we already?" Another observing my wounds, which still remained exposed to the air, told me, my seams were uncaulked, and that I must be new paid. -- A third, seeing my hair clotted together with blood, as my hair were, into distinct cords, took notice, that my bows were manned with the red ropes, instead of my side. -- A fourth asked me, if I could not keep my yards square without iron braces? and in short, a thousand witticisms of the same nature, were passed upon me, before I could get up the ship's side. -- After we had been all entered upon the books, I enquired at one of my ship-mates where the surgeon was, that I might have my wounds dressed, and had actually got as far as the middle deck (for we carried eighty guns) in my way to the cockpit, when I was met by the same midshipman who had used me so barbarously in the tender: the surgeon seeing me free from my chains, asked, with an insolent air, who had released me? To this I foolishly answered, with a countenance that too plainly declared the state of my thoughts; "Whoever did the state of my thoughts, I am persuaded did not consult you in the affair." -- I had no sooner uttered these words, than the surgeon cried, "D -- n you, you saucy son of a b -- ch, I Will teach you to talk so to the commanding officer." -- So saying, the commanding officer bestowed on me several severe stripes, with a supple Jack the commanding officer had in the commanding officer hand; and going to the commanding officer, made such a report of me, that I was immediately put in irons by the master at arms, and a sentinel placed over me. -- Honest Rattlin, as soon as -- Honest Rattlin heard of my condition, came to me, and administered all the consolation -- Honest Rattlin could, and then went to the surgeon in my behalf, who sent one of -- Honest Rattlin mates to dress my wounds. This mate was no other than my old friend Thomson, with whom I became acquainted at the Navy-office, as before mentioned. If I knew This mate at first sight, it was not so easy for This mate to recognize me, disfigured with blood and dirt, and altered by the misery I had undergone. -- Unknown as I was to This mate, This mate surveyed me with looks of compassion, and handled my sores with great tenderness. When This mate had applied what This mate thought proper, and was about to leave me, I asked This mate if my misfortunes had disquised me so much, that This mate could not recollect my face? Upon this This mate observed me with great earnestness for some time, and at length, protested This mate could not recollect one feature of my countenance. -- To keep This mate no longer in suspense, I told This mate my name; which when This mate heard, This mate embraced me with affection, and professed This mate sorrow in seeing me in such a disagreeable situation. I made This mate acquainted with my story, and when This mate heard how inhumanly I had been used in the tender, This mate left me abruptly, assuring me, I should see This mate again soon. I had scarce time to wonder at This mate sudden departure, when the master at arms came to the place of my confinement, and bid me follow This mate to the quarter deck, where I was examined by the first lieutenant, who commanded the ship in the absence of the captain, touching the treatment I had received in the tender from my friend the midshipman, who was present to confront me. -- I recounted the particulars of This mate behavior to me, not only in the tender, but since my being on board the ship, part of which being proved by the evidence of Jack Rattlin and others, who had no great devotion for my oppressor, I was discharged from confinement to make way for This mate, who was delivered to the master at arms to take This mate turn in the Bilboes. -- And this was not the only satisfaction I enjoyed, for I was, at the request of the surgeon, exempted from all other duty, than that of assisting his mates in making and administering medicines to the sick. -- This good office I owed to the friendship of Mr. Thomson, who had represented me in such a favorable light to the surgeon, that the surgeon demanded me of the lieutenant, to supply the place of the surgeon third mate, who was lately dead. -- When I had obtained this favor, my old friend Thomson carried me down to the cockpit, which is the place allotted for the habitation of the surgeon's mates: And when my old friend Thomson had shown me their birth (as my old friend Thomson called it) I was filled with astonishment and horror. -- We descended by diverse ladders to a space as dark as a dungeon, which I understood was immersed several feet under water, being immediately above the hold: I had no sooner approached this dismal gulf, than my nose was saluted with an intolerable stench of putrified cheese, and rancid butter, that issued from an apartment at the foot of the ladder, resembling a chandler's shop, where, by the faint glimmering of a candle, I could perceive a man with a pale meagre countenance, sitting behind a kind of desk, having spectacles on his nose, and a pen in his hand. -- This (I learned of Mr. Thomson) was the ship's steward, who sat there to distribute provision to the several messes, and to mark what each received. -- Mr. Thomson therefore presented my name to Mr. Thomson, and desired I might be entered in Mr. Thomson mess; then taking a light in Mr. Thomson , conducted me to the place of Mr. Thomson residence, which was a square of about six feet, surrounded with the medicine chest, that of the first mate, Mr. Thomson own, and a board by way of table fastened to the mizen-mast the mizen-mast was also enclosed with canvas nailed round to the beams of the ship, to screen us from the cold, as well as the view of the midshipmen and quarter masters, who lodged within the cable tiers on each side of us: In this gloomy mansion, Mr. Thomson entertained me with some cold salt pork, which Mr. Thomson brought from a sort of locker, fixed above the table; and calling for the boy of his mess, sent Mr. Thomson for a can of beer, of which Mr. Thomson made excellent flip to crown the banquet. -- By this time I began to recover my spirits, which had been exceedingly depressed with the appearance of every thing about Mr. Thomson, and could no longer refrain from asking the particulars of Mr. Thomson's fortune, since I had seen Mr. Thomson in London. -- Mr. Thomson told me, that being disappointed in Mr. Thomson expectations of borrowing money to gratify the rapacious s -- t -- ry at the Navy-office, Mr. Thomson found Mr. Thomson utterly unable to subsist any longer in town, and had actually offered Mr. Thomson service, in quality of mate, to the surgeon of a merchant's ship bound to Guinea on the slaving trade; when one morning, a young fellow, of whom Mr. Thomson had some acquaintance, came to Mr. Thomson lodgings, and informed Mr. Thomson, that Mr. Thomson had seen a wa rant made out in Mr. Thomson name at the Navy-office, for surgeon's second mate of a third rate: This unexpected piece of good news Mr. Thomson could scarcely believe to be true; more especially, as Mr. Thomson had been found qualified at Surgeon's-hall for third mate only; but that Mr. Thomson might not be wanting to Mr. Thomson, Mr. Thomson went thither to be assured, and actually found it so: Whereupon, demanding Mr. Thomson warrant, it was delivered to Whereupon, and the oaths administered immediately. -- That very afternoon, Mr. Thomson went to Gravesend in the tilt-boat, from whence Mr. Thomson took a place in the tide-coach for Rochester; next morning got on board the Thunder, for which Mr. Thomson was appointed, then lying in the harbor at Chatham; and the same day was mustered by the clerk of the checque. -- And well it was for Mr. Thomson, that such expedition was used; for in less then twelve hours after Mr. Thomson arrival, another William Thomson came on board, affirming that William Thomson was the person for whom the warrant was expedited, and that the other was an impostor. -- my old friend Thomson was grievously alarmed at this accident; the more so, as my old friend Thomson namesake had very much the advantage over my old friend Thomson, both in assurance and dress. -- However, to acquit my old friend Thomson of the suspicion of imposture, my old friend Thomson produced several letters written from Scotland to my old friend Thomson in that name, and recollecting that my old friend Thomson indentures were in my old friend Thomson box on board, my old friend Thomson brought them up, and convinced all present, that my old friend Thomson had not assumed a name which did not belong to my old friend Thomson. -- my old friend Thomson competitor enraged, that them should hesitate in doing my old friend Thomson justice (for to be sure, the warrant had been designed for my old friend Thomson) behaved with so much indecent heat, that the commanding officer, (who was the same gentleman I had seen) and the surgeon, were offended at my old friend Thomson presumption, and making a point of it with them friends in town, in less than a week got the first confirmed in my old friend Thomson station. -- "I have been on board (said my old friend Thomson) ever since, and as this way of life is become familiar to my old friend Thomson, have no cause to complain of my situation. -- the surgeon is a good-natured indolent man; the first mate (who is now on shore on duty) is indeed a little proud and choleric, as all Welchmen are, but in the main, a friendly honest fellow. -- The lieutenants I have no concern with; and as for the captain, the captain is too much of a gentleman to know a surgeon's mate, even by sight."  CHAP. XXV. The behavior of Mr. Morgan -- his pride, displeasure and generosity -- the economy of our mess described -- another William Thomson's further friendship -- the nature of my duty explained -- the situation of the sick.  WHILE his was thus discoursing to my old friend Thomson, our heard a voice on the cockpit ladder, pronounce with great vehemence, in a strange dialect, "The devil and his dam blow me from the top of Mounchdenny, if I go to his before there is something in my belly; -- let his nose be as yellow as a saffron, or as plue as a pell (look you) or as green as a leek, it is all one." -- To this somebody answered, "So it seems my poor mess-mate must part my poor mess-mate cable for want of a little assistance. -- my poor mess-mate fore-top-sail is loose already; and besides, the doctor ordered you to overhaul my poor mess-mate; -- but I see, you don't mind what the master says." -- Here my poor mess-mate was interrupted with, "Splutter and vons! you lousy tog, who do you call the master? get you gone to the doctor, and tell the doctor my birth, and my education, and my abilities; and moreover, my behavior is as good as the doctor, or any gentleman's (no disparagement to the doctor) in the whole world -- Got pless my soul! does the doctor think, or conceive, or imagine, that I am a horse, or an ass, or a goat, to trudge backwards and forwards, and upwards and downwards, and by sea and by land, at the doctor will and pleasures? -- Go your ways, you rapscallion, and tell doctor Atkins, that I desire and request, that doctor Atkins will give a look upon the tying man, and order something for the tying man, if the tying man be dead or alive, and I will see the tying man take it by and by, when my craving stomach is satisfied, look you." -- At this the other went away, saying, that if they would serve the tying man so, when the tying man was a dying, by G -- d, the tying man would be foul of they in the other world. -- Here Mr. Thomson let me know that the person we heard, was Mr. Morgan the first mate, who was just come on board from the hospital, where Mr. Thomson had been with sick people. -- At the same time, I saw Mr. Thomson come into my birth. -- Mr. Thomson was a short thick man, with a face garnished with pimples, a snub nose turned up at the end, an excessive wide mouth, and little fiery eyes, surrounded with skin puckered up in innumerable wrinkles. -- my old friend Thomson immediately made Mr. Thomson acquainted with my case; when Mr. Thomson regarded me with a very lofty look, but without speaking, set down a bundle Mr. Thomson had in Mr. Thomson , and approached the cupboard, which when Mr. Thomson had opened, Mr. Thomson exclaimed in a great passion, "Cot is my life! all the pork is gone, as I am a christian!" Mr. Thomson then gave Mr. Thomson to understand, that as I had been brought on board half famished, Mr. Thomson could do no less than entertain me with what was in the locker; and the rather, as Mr. Thomson had bid the steward enter me in his mess. -- Whether this disappointment made Mr. Morgan more peevish than usual, or Mr. Morgan really thought Mr. Morgan too little regarded by Mr. Morgan fellowmate, I know not, but after some pause, Mr. Morgan went on in this manner -- "Mr. Thomson, perhaps you do not use me with all the good manners, and complaisance, and respect (look you) that becomes you, because you have not vouchsafed to advise with me in this affair. -- I have, in my time (look you) been a man of some weight, and substance, and consideration, and have kept house and home, and paid scot and lot, and the king's taxes; ay, and maintained a family to boot. -- And moreover, also, I am your senior, and your elder, and your petter, Mr. Thomson." -- "My elder I Will allow you to be, but not my better (cried Mr. Thomson, with some heat.)" -- "Cot is my savior, and witness too (said Morgan, with great vehemence) that I am more elder, and therefore more petter by many years than Morgan." -- Fearing this dispute might be attended with some bad consequence, I interposed, and told Mr. Morgan, I was very sorry for having been the occasion of any difference between Mr. Morgan and the second mate; and that rather than cause the least breach in their good understanding, I would eat my allowance by me, or seek admission into some other company. -- But Mr. Thomson, with more spirit than discretion (as I thought) insisted upon my remaining where Thomson, with more spirit than discretion (as I thought) had appointed me; and observed that no man possessed of generosity and compassion, would have any objection to it, considering my birth and talents, and the misfortunes I had of late so unjustly undergone. -- This was touching Mr. Morgan on the right key, who protested with great earnestness, that Mr. Morgan had no objection to my being received in his mess; but only complained, that the ceremony of asking Mr. Morgan consent was not observed. "As for a shentleman in distress (said he, shaking me by the hand) I lofe he as I lofe my own powels: For Got help me! I have had vexations enough upon my own pack." -- And as I afterward learned, in so saying he spoke no more than what was true; for he had been once settled in a very good situation in Glamorganshire, and was ruined by being security for an acquaintance. -- All differences being composed, he united he bundle, which consisted of three bunches of onions, and a great lump of Cheshire-cheese wrapped up in a handkerchief; and taking some biscuit from the cupboard, fell to with a keen appetite, inviting us to a share of the repast. -- When he had fed heartily on this homely fare, he filled a large cup made of a cocoa-nut-shell, with brandy, and drinking a large cup made of a cocoa-nut-shell off, told us, "Prandy was the best menstruum for onion and sheese." -- he hunger being appeased, he began to show a great deal of good humor; and being inquisitive about my birth, no sooner understood that I was descended of a good family, then he discovered a particular good will to he on that account, deducing he own pedigree in a direct line from the famous Caractacus king of the Britons, who was first the prisoner and afterward the friend of Claudius Caesar. -- Perceiving how much I was reduced in point of linen, he made me a present of two good ruffled shirts, which with two of check Mr. Thomson gave me, enabled me to appear with decency. -- Mean while the sailor, whom Mr. Morgan had sent to the doctor, brought a prescription for Mr. Morgan mess-mate, which when Mr. Welchman had read, Mr. Welchman got up to prepare it, and asked if Mr. Morgan was "Tead or alive." -- "Dead! (replied Jack) if Mr. Morgan was dead Mr. Morgan would have no occasion for doctor's stuff. -- No, thank God, death has'n't as yet boarded Mr. Morgan, but death has'n't have been yard arm and yard arm these three glasses." -- "Are Mr. Morgan eyes open? (continued the mate.)" -- "Mr. Morgan starboard eye (said the sailor) is open, but fast jamm'd in Mr. Morgan head; and the haulyards of Mr. Morgan underjaw are given way." -- "Passion of my heart! (cried Mr. Morgan) Mr. Morgan is as pad as one would desire in a summer's day! -- Did you feel Mr. Morgan pulses? To this, the other replied with "Anan?" -- Upon which this Cambro Briton, with great earnestness and humanity, ordered the tar to run to his mess-mate and keep his alive till his should come with the medicine, "and then (said his) you shall peradventure, pehold what you shall see." -- The poor fellow with great simplicity ran to the place where his lay, but in less than a minute, returned with a woeful countenance, and told us his comrade had struck. Morgan hearing this, exclaimed, "Mercy upon my salfation! why did you not stop his till I came?" -- "Stop his (said the other) I hailed his several times, but his was too far on his way, and the enemy had got possession of his close quarters; so that his did not mind me." -- "Well, well, (said his) we all owe heaven a Teath. -- Go your ways, you ragamuffin, and take an example and a warning, look you, and repent of your misteets." -- So saying, his pushed the seamen out of my birth.  While his entertained us with reflections suitable to this event, us heard the boatswain pipe to dinner; and immediately the boy belonging to us mess, run to the locker, from whence the boy carried off a large wooden platter, and in a few minutes, returned with a large wooden platter full of boiled peace, crying, "Scaldings," all the way as the boy came. -- The cloth, consisting of a piece of an old sail, was instantly laid, covered with three plates, which by the color, I could with difficulty discern to be metal, and as many spoons of the same composition, two of which were curtailed in the handles, and the other in the lip. Mr. Morgan enriched this mess with a lump of salt butter, scooped from an old gallipot, and a handful of onions shorn, with some pounded pepper. -- I was not very much tempted with the appearance of this dish, of which, nevertheless, my mess-mates eat heartily, advising me to follow my mess-mates example, as it was banyan day, and we could have no meat till next noon. -- But I had already laid in sufficient for the occasion; and therefore desired to be excused; expressing a curiosity to know the meaning of banyan day. -- my mess-mates tole me, that on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the ship's company had no allowance of meat, and that these meagre days were called banyan days, the reason of which my mess-mates did not know; but I have since learned my mess-mates take my mess-mates denomination from a sect of devotees in some parts of the East Indies, who never taste flesh.  After dinner, Mr. Thomson led me round the ship' showed me the different parts, described the different parts uses, and as far as Mr. Thomson could, made me acquainted with the particulars of the discipline and economy practiced on board. -- Mr. Thomson then demanded of the boatswain, an hammock for me, which was slung in a very neat manner by my friend Jack Rattlin; and as I had no bed-Cloaths, procured credit for me with the purser, for a mattress and two blankets. -- At seven a-clock in the evening, Mr. Morgan visited the sick, and having ordered what was proper for each, I assisted Mr. Thomson in making up Mr. Morgan prescriptions: But when I followed Mr. Morgan with the medicines into the sick birth or hospital, and observed the situation of the patients, I was much less surprised to find people die on board, than astonished to find any body recover. -- Here I saw about fifty miserable distempered wretches, suspended in rows, so huddled one upon another, that not more than fourteen inches of space was allotted for each with his bed and bedding; and deprived of the light of the day, as well as of fresh air; breathing nothing but a noisome atmosphere of the morbid steams exhaling from about fifty miserable distempered wretches, suspended in rows own excrements and diseased bodies, devoured with vermin hatched in the filth that surrounded about fifty miserable distempered wretches, suspended in rows, and destitute of every convenience necessary for people in that helpless condition.  CHAP. XXVI. A disagreeable accident happens to me in the discharge of my office -- Mr. Morgan's nose is offended -- a dialogue between Mr. Morgan and the ship's steward -- upon examination, I find more causes of complaint than one -- my hair is cut off -- Mr. Morgan's Cookery -- the manner of sleeping on board -- I am waked in the night by a dreadful noise.
