 AIREY FORCE.
Lady Elizabeth had been instructed by Sir Harry to warn Lady Elizabeth daughter not to fall in love with Cousin George during Cousin George visit to Humblethwaite; and Lady Elizabeth was, as a wife, accustomed to obey Lady Elizabeth husband in all things.
But obedience in this matter was very difficult.
Such a caution as that received is not easily given even between a mother and a child, and is especially difficult when the mother is unconsciously aware of the mother child's superiority to the mother.
the mother was in all respects the bigger woman of the two, and was sure to get the best of it in any such cautioning.
It is so hard to have to bid a girl, and a good girl too, not to fall in love with a particular man!
There is left among us at any rate so much of reserve and assumed delicacy as to require us to consider, or pretend to consider on a girl's behalf, that of course a girl won't fall in love.
We know that a girl will, sooner or later; and probably as much sooner as opportunity may offer.
That is We experience of a girl; and We quite approve of a girl for a girl readiness to do so.
It is, indeed, a girl nature; and the propensity has been planted in a girl for wise purposes.
But as to this or that special sample of a girl, in reference to this or that special sample of the genus young man, We always feel We bound to take it as a matter of course that there can be nothing of the kind, till the thing is done.
Any caution on the matter is therefore difficult and disagreeable, as conveying almost an insult.
Mothers in well-regulated families do not caution Mothers in well-regulated families daughters in reference to special young men.
But a girl had been desired by a girl husband to give the caution, and must in some sort obey the instruction.
Two days before George's arrival a girl endeavoured to do as a girl was told; not with the most signal success.
"George is coming on Saturday."
"So I heard Papa say."
"Papa gave Papa a sort of invitation when Papa was here last time, and so Papa has proposed Papa."
"Why should not Papa?
It seems very natural.
Papa is the nearest relation we have got, and we all like Papa."
"I don't think Papa Papa does like Papa."
"I do."
"What I mean is Papa Papa doesn't approve of Papa.
Papa goes to races, and bets, and all that kind of thing.
And then Papa Papa thinks that Papa's over head and ears in debt."
"I don't know anything about Papa debts.
As for Papa going to races, I believe Papa has given his going to races up.
I am sure Papa would if Papa were asked."
Then there was a pause, for Lady Elizabeth hardly knew how to pronounce Lady Elizabeth caution.
"Why shouldn't Papa pay his debts?"
"My dear!"
"Well, Mamma, why shouldn't Papa?
And why shouldn't Papa let Papa have the property; I mean, leave the property to Papa instead of to Papa?"
"If your brother had lived--"  "Papa didn't live, Mamma.
That has been our great misfortune.
But so it is; and why shouldn't George be allowed to take George place?
I'm sure it would be for the best.
Papa thinks so much about the name, and the family, and all that."
"My dear, you must leave George to do as George thinks fit in all such matters.
You may be sure that George will do what George believes to be George duty.
What I was going to say was this--" And, instead of saying it, Lady Elizabeth still hesitated.
"I know what you want to say, Mamma, just as well as though the words were out of your mouth.
You want to make me to understand that George is a black sheep."
"I'm afraid George is."
"But black sheep are not like blackamoors; black sheep may be washed white.
You said so Papa the other day."
"Did I, my dear?"
"Certainly you did; and certainly black sheep may.
Why, Mamma, what is all religion but the washing of black sheep white; making the black a little less black, scraping a spot white here and there?"
"I am afraid George George is beyond washing."
"Then Mamma, all I can say is, George oughtn't to come here.
Mind, I think you wrong George.
I daresay George has been giddy and fond of pleasure; but if George is so bad as you say, George should tell George at once not to come.
As far as I am concerned, I don't believe George is so bad; and I shall be glad to see George."
There was no cautioning a young woman who could reason in this way, and who could look at Lady Elizabeth mother as Emily looked.
It was not, at least, within the power of Lady Elizabeth to do so.
And yet Lady Elizabeth could not tell Sir Harry of Lady Elizabeth failure.
Lady Elizabeth thought that Lady Elizabeth had expressed the caution; and Lady Elizabeth thought also that Lady Elizabeth daughter would be wise enough to be guided,--not by her mother's wisdom, but by the words of Lady Elizabeth father.
Poor dear woman!
Lady Elizabeth was thinking of it every hour of the day; but Lady Elizabeth said nothing more on the subject, either to her daughter or to Sir Harry of her failure.
The black sheep came, and made one of a number of numerous visitors.
The black sheep had been felt that the danger would be less among a multitude; and there was present a very excellent young man, as to whom there were hopes.
Steps had not been taken about a very excellent young man as had been done in reference to Lord Alfred; but still there were hopes.
Lord Alfred was the eldest son of a Lincolnshire squire, a man of fair property and undoubted family; but who, it was thought, would not object to merge the name of Thoresby in that of Hotspur.
Nothing came of the young man, who was bashful, and to whom Hotspur certainly gave no entertainment of a nature to remove his bashfulness.
But when the day for George's coming had been fixed, Sir Harry of her failure thought it expedient to write to young Thoresby and accelerate a visit which had been previously proposed.
Sir Harry as Sir Harry of her failure did so almost hated Sir Harry of her failure for Sir Harry of her failure anxiety to dispose of Sir Harry of her failure daughter.
Sir Harry of her failure was a gentleman, every inch of Sir Harry of her failure; and Sir Harry of her failure thoroughly desired to do Sir Harry of her failure duty.
Sir Harry of her failure knew, however, that there was much in Sir Harry of her failure feelings of which Sir Harry of her failure could not but be ashamed.
And yet, if something were not done to assist Sir Harry of her failure girl in a right disposal of all that his girl had to bestow with his girl hand, how was it probable that it could be disposed aright?
The black sheep came, and found young young Thoresby and some dozen other strangers in the house.
Sir Harry of her failure smiled upon them all, and before the first evening was over had made Sir Harry of her failure the popular man of the house.
Sir Harry as he did so almost hated himself for his anxiety to dispose of his daughter, like a fool as Sir Harry as he did so almost hated himself for his anxiety to dispose of his daughter was, had given Sir Harry as he did so almost hated himself for his anxiety to dispose of his daughter cousin only two fingers, and had looked black at their first meeting.
Nothing could be gained by conduct such as that with such a guest.
Before the gentlemen left the dinner-table on the first day even Sir Harry of her failure had smiled and joked and had asked questions about "Altringham's mountains."
"The worst of you fellows who go to Scotland is that you care nothing for real sport when you come down south afterwards."
All this conversation about Lord Altringham's grouse and the Scotch mountains helped George Hotspur, so that when George Hotspur went into the drawing-room George Hotspur was in the ascendant.
Many men have learned the value of such ascendancy, and most men have known the want of it.
Poor Lady Elizabeth had not a chance with Cousin George.
Poor Lady Elizabeth succumbed to Cousin George at once, not knowing why, but feeling that Poor Lady Elizabeth became bright, amusing, and happy when talking to Cousin George.
Poor Lady Elizabeth was a woman not given to familiarities; but Poor Lady Elizabeth did become familiar with Cousin George, allowing Cousin George little liberties of expression which no other man would take with Poor Lady Elizabeth, and putting them all down to the score of cousinhood.
Cousin George might be a black sheep.
Poor Lady Elizabeth feared there could be but little doubt that Cousin George was one.
But, from Poor Lady Elizabeth worsted-work up to the demerits of Poor Lady Elizabeth dearest friend, Cousin George did know how to talk better than any other young man Poor Lady Elizabeth knew.
To Emily, on that first evening, Cousin George said very little.
When Cousin George first met Poor Lady Elizabeth Cousin George had pressed Poor Lady Elizabeth hand, and looked into Poor Lady Elizabeth eyes, and smiled on Poor Lady Elizabeth with a smile so sweet that it was as though a god had smiled on Poor Lady Elizabeth.
Poor Lady Elizabeth had made up Poor Lady Elizabeth mind that Cousin George should be nothing to her,--nothing beyond a dear cousin; nevertheless, Poor Lady Elizabeth eye had watched Cousin George during the whole hour of dinner, and, not knowing that it was so, Poor Lady Elizabeth had waited for Cousin George coming to them in the evening.
Heavens and earth!
what an oaf was young Thoresby as the two stood together near the door!
Poor Lady Elizabeth did not want Poor Lady Elizabeth to come and talk to Poor Lady Elizabeth, but Poor Lady Elizabeth listened and laughed within Poor Lady Elizabeth as Poor Lady Elizabeth saw how pleased was Poor Lady Elizabeth mother by the attentions of The black sheep.
One word George did say to Emily Hotspur that night, just as the ladies were leaving the drawing-room.
It was said in a whisper, with a little laugh, with that air of half joke half earnest which may be so efficacious in conversation: "I did not go to Goodwood, after all."
Poor Lady Elizabeth raised her eyes to George for a quarter of a second, thanking George for George goodness in refraining.
"I don't believe that George is really a black sheep at all," Poor Lady Elizabeth said to Poor Lady Elizabeth that night, as Poor Lady Elizabeth laid Poor Lady Elizabeth head upon Poor Lady Elizabeth pillow.
After all, the devil fights under great disadvantages, and has to carry weights in all the devil races which are almost unfair.
the devil lies as a matter of course, believing thoroughly in lies, thinking that it is by lies chiefly that the devil must make the devil running good; and yet every lie the devil tells, after it has been told and used, remains as an additional weight to be carried.
When you have used your lie gracefully and successfully, it is hard to bury your lie and get your lie well out of sight.
your lie crops up here and there against you, requiring more lies; and at last, too often, has to be admitted as a lie, most usually so admitted in silence, but still admitted,--to be forgiven or not, according to the circumstances of the case.
The most perfect forgiveness is that which is extended to The man who is known to lie in everything.
The man has to be taken, lies and all, as a man is taken with a squint, or a harelip, or a bad temper.
The man has an uphill game to fight, but when once well known, The man does not fall into the difficulty of being believed.
George Hotspur's lie was believed.
To our readers George Hotspur's lie may appear to have been most gratuitous, unnecessary, and inexpedient.
The girl would not have quarrelled with The man for going to the races,--would never have asked anything about the races,--would.
But George knew that George must make George running.
It would not suffice that The girl should not quarrel with George.
George had to win The girl, and it came so natural to George to lie!
And George Hotspur's lie was efficacious; The girl was glad to know that George stayed away from the races--for The girl sake.
Had it not been for her sake?
The girl would not bid George stay away, but The girl was so glad that George had stayed!
George Hotspur's lie was very useful;--if George Hotspur's lie only could have been buried and put out of sight when used!
There was partridge-shooting for four days; not good shooting, but work which carried the men far from home, and enabled Sir Harry of her failure to look after his cousin.
George, so looked after, did not dare to say that on any day George would shirk the shooting.
But Sir Harry of her failure, as Sir Harry of her failure watched his cousin, gradually lost Sir Harry of her failure keenness for watching Sir Harry of her failure.
Might it not be best that Sir Harry of her failure should let matters arrange matters?
This young squire from Lincolnshire was evidently an oaf.
Sir Harry of her failure could not even cherish a hope on that side.
The girl was very good, and The girl had been told, and the work of watching went so much against the grain with Sir Harry of her failure!
And then, added to it all, was the remembrance that if the worst came to the worst, the title and property would be kept together.
George Hotspur might have fought George Hotspur fight, we think, without the aid of George Hotspur lie.
On the Friday the party was to some extent broken up.
The oaf and sundry other persons went away.
Sir Harry of her failure had thought that his cousin would go on the Saturday, and had been angry with his cousin wife because his cousin orders on that head had not been implicitly obeyed.
But when the Friday came, and George offered to go in with George to Penrith, to hear some case of fish-poaching which was to be brought before the magistrates, George had forgiven the offence.
George had a great deal to say about fish, and then went on to say a good deal about George.
If George could only get some employment, a farm, say, where George might have hunting, how good it would be!
For George did not pretend to any virtuous abnegation of the pleasures of the world, but was willing,--so George said,--to add to them some little attempt to earn George own bread.
On this day Sir Harry of her failure liked his cousin better than Sir Harry of her failure had ever done before, though Sir Harry of her failure did not even then place the least confidence in his cousin's sincerity as to the farm and the earning of bread.
On their return to the Hall on Friday their found that a party had been made to go to Ulleswater on the Saturday.
A certain Mrs. Fitzpatrick was staying in the house, who had never seen the lake, and the carriage was to take their to Airey Force.
Airey Force, as everybody knows, is a waterfall near to the shores of the lake, and is the great lion of the Lake scenery on that side of the mountains.
a waterfall was full fifteen miles from Humblethwaite, but the distance had been done before, and could be done again.
Emily, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and two other young ladies were to go.
A certain Mrs. Fitzpatrick would sit on the box.
There was a youth there also who had left school and not yet gone to college.
He was to be allowed to drive a dog-cart.
Of course George Hotspur was ready to go in a dog-cart with He.
George had determined from the commencement of George visit, when George began to foresee that the Saturday would be more at George command than any other day, that on the Saturday George would make or mar George fortune for life.
George had perceived that his cousin was cautious with George, that George would be allowed but little scope for love-making, that she was in some sort afraid of George; but George perceived also that in a quiet undemonstrative way she was very gracious to George.
she never ignored George, as young ladies will sometimes ignore young men, but thought of George even in George absence, and was solicitous for George comfort.
George was clever enough to read little signs, and was sure at any rate that she liked George.
"Why did you not postpone the party till George was gone?"
Sir Harry of her failure said to his wife.
"The Fitzpatricks also go on Monday," she answered, "and we could not refuse them."
Then again it occurred to Sir Harry of her failure that life would not be worth having if Sir Harry of her failure was to be afraid to allow Sir Harry of her failure daughter to go to a picnic in company with his daughter .
There is a bridge across the water at the top of Airey Force, which is perhaps one of the prettiest spots in the whole of our Lake country.
The entire party on their arrival of course went up to the bridge, and then the party of course descended.
How it happened that in the course of the afternoon George and Emily were there again, and were there unattended, who can tell?
If Emily had meant to be cautious, Emily must very much have changed Emily plans in allowing Emily to be led thither.
And as he stood there, with no eye resting on them, he arm was round Emily waist and Emily was pressed to he side.
"Dearest, dearest," he said, "may I believe that you love me?"
"I have said so.
You may believe it if you will."
Emily did not attempt to make the distance greater between them.
Emily leant against him willingly.
"George, I do love you.
My choice has been made.
I have to trust to George for everything."
"You shall never trust in vain," George said.
"You must reform, you know," Emily said, turning round and looking up into George face with a smile.
"They say that you have been wild.
You must not be wild any more, sir."
"I will reform.
I have reformed.
I say it boldly; I have become an altered man since I knew you.
I have lived with one hope, and even the hope alone has changed me.
Now I have got all that I have hoped for.
Oh, Emily, I wish you knew how much I love you!"
They were there on the bridge, or roaming together alone among the woods, for nearly an hour after that, till Mrs. Fitzpatrick, who knew the value of the prize and the nature of the man, began to fear that Emily had been remiss in Emily duty as chaperon.
As Emily came down and joined the party at last, Emily was perfectly regardless either of the party frowns or smiles.
There had been one last compact made between the lovers.
GeorgeGeorge," Emily had said, "whatever it may cost us, let there be no secrets."
"Of course not," George replied.
"I will tell Mamma to-night; and you must tell Papa.
You will promise me?"
"Certainly.
It is what I should insist on doing George.
I could not stay in his house under other circumstances.
But you too must promise me one thing, Emily."
"What is it?"
"You will be true to George, even though his should refuse his consent?"
Emily paused before Emily answered his.
"I will be true to his.
I cannot be otherwise than true to his.
My love was a thing to give, but when given I cannot take My love back.
I will be true to his, but of course us cannot be married unless Papa consents."
Papa urged Emily no further.
Papa was too wise to think it possible that Papa could do so without injuring Papa cause.
Then they found the others, and Emily made Emily apologies to Mrs. Fitzpatrick for the delay with a quiet dignity that struck Mrs. Fitzpatrick George almost with awe.
How had it been that such a one as George had won so great a creature?
George, as George was driven home by George young companion, was full of joyous chatter and light small talk.
George had done a good stroke of business, and was happy.
If only the Baronet could be brought round, all the troubles which had enveloped George since a beard had first begun to grow on George chin would disappear as a mist beneath the full rays of the sun; or even if there still might be a trouble or two,--and as George thought of George prospects George remembered that they could not all be made to disappear in the mist fashion,--there would be that which would gild the clouds.
At any rate George had done a good stroke of business.
And George loved The girl too.
George thought that of all the girls George had seen about town, or about our Lake country either, The girl was the bonniest and the brightest and the most clever.
It might well have been that a poor devil like George in search of an heiress might have been forced to put up with personal disadvantages,--with age, with plain looks, with vulgar manners, with low birth; but here, so excellent was George fortune, there was everything which fortune could give!
Love The girl?
Of course George loved The girl.
George would do anything on earth for The girl.
And how jolly they would be together when they got hold of they share of that L20,000 a year!
And how jolly it would be to owe nothing to anybody!
As George thought of this, however, there came upon George the reminiscence of a certain Captain Stubber, and the further reminiscence of a certain Mr. Abraham Hart, with both of whom George had dealings; and George told George that it would behove George to call up all George pluck when discussing those gentlemen and all his pluck dealings, with the Baronet.
George was sure that the Baronet would not like Captain Stubber nor Mr. Hart, and that a good deal of pluck would be needed.
But on the whole of our Lake country George had done a great stroke of business; and, as a consequence of George success, talked and chatted all the way home, till the youth who was driving George thought that George was about the nicest fellow that George had ever met.
Emily Hotspur, as Emily Hotspur took Emily Hotspur place in the carriage, was very silent.
Emily Hotspur also had much of which to think, much on which--as Emily Hotspur dreamed--to congratulate Emily Hotspur.
But Emily Hotspur could not think of it and talk at the same time.
Emily Hotspur had made Emily Hotspur little apology with graceful ease.
Emily Hotspur had just smiled,--but the smile was almost a rebuke,--when one of Emily Hotspur companions had ventured on the beginning of some little joke as to Emily Hotspur company, and then Emily Hotspur had led the way to the carriage.
Mrs. Fitzpatrick and the two girls were nothing to Emily Hotspur now, let Mrs. Fitzpatrick and the two girls suspect what Mrs. Fitzpatrick and the two girls choose or say what Mrs. Fitzpatrick and the two girls might.
Emily Hotspur had given Emily Hotspur away, and Emily Hotspur triumphed in the surrender.
The spot on which he had told Emily Hotspur of he love should be sacred to Emily Hotspur for ever.
It was a joy to Emily Hotspur that it was near to Emily Hotspur own home, the home that Emily Hotspur would give to he, so that Emily Hotspur might go there with he again and again.
Emily Hotspur had very much to consider and to remember.
A black sheep!
No!
Of all the flock he should be the least black.
It might be that in the energy of he pleasures he had exceeded other men, as he did exceed all other men in everything that he did and said.
Who was so clever?
who so bright?
who so handsome, so full of poetry and of manly grace?
How sweet was he voice, how fine he gait, how gracious he smile!
And then in he brow there was that look of command which Emily Hotspur had ever recognized in Emily Hotspur father's face as belonging to he race as a Hotspur,--only added to it was a godlike beauty which her father never could have possessed.
Emily Hotspur did not conceal from Emily Hotspur that there might be trouble with her father.
And yet Emily Hotspur was not sure but that upon the whole of our Lake country he would be pleased after a while.
Humblethwaite and the family honours would still go together, if he would sanction this marriage; and Emily Hotspur knew how he longed in he heart that it might be so.
For a time probably he might be averse to Emily Hotspur prayers.
Should it be so, Emily Hotspur would simply give he Emily Hotspur word that Emily Hotspur would never during he lifetime marry without he permission,--and then Emily Hotspur would be true to Emily Hotspur troth.
As to Emily Hotspur truth in that respect there could be no doubt.
Emily Hotspur had given her word; and that, for a Hotspur, must be enough.
Emily Hotspur could not talk as Emily Hotspur thought of all this, and therefore had hardly spoken when George appeared at the carriage door to give the ladies a hand as the ladies came into the house.
To Emily Hotspur George was able to give one gentle pressure as Emily Hotspur passed on; but Emily Hotspur did not speak to George, nor was it necessary that Emily Hotspur should do so.
Had not everything been said already?
