 COUSIN GEORGE IS HARD PRESSED.   The very sensible and, as one would have thought, very manifest idea of buying up  COUSIN GEORGE  COUSIN GEORGE originated with Mr. Boltby. " COUSIN GEORGE will have  COUSIN GEORGE price, Sir Harry," said the lawyer. Then Sir Harry's eyes were opened, and so excellent did this mode of escape seem to Sir Harry that Sir Harry was ready to pay almost any price for the article. Sir Harry saw he was ready to pay almost any price for the article at a glance. Emily had high-flown notions, and would not yield; Sir Harry feared that Emily would not yield, let  COUSIN GEORGE delinquencies be shown to be as black as Styx. But if  COUSIN GEORGE could be made to give  COUSIN GEORGE up,--then Emily must yield; and, yielding in such manner, having received so rude a proof of her up,--then Emily lover's unworthiness, it could not be but that her up,--then Emily heart would be changed. Sir Harry's first idea of a price was very noble; all debts to be paid, a thousand a year for the present, and Scarrowby to be attached to the title. What price would be too high to pay for the extrication of Sir Harry daughter from so grievous a misfortune? But Mr. Boltby was more calm. As to the payment of the debts,--yes, within a certain liberal limit. For the present, an income of five hundred pounds Mr. Boltby thought would be almost as efficacious a bait as double the amount; and it would be well to tack to it the necessity of a residence abroad. it might, perhaps, serve to get the young man out of the country for a time. If the young man bargained on either of these headings, the matter could be reconsidered by Mr. Boltby; as to settling Scarrowby on the title, Mr. Boltby was clearly against it. "Mr. Boltby would raise every shilling Mr. Boltby could on post-obits within twelve months." At last the offer was made in the terms with which the reader is already acquainted. George was sent off from the lawyer's chambers with directions to consider the terms, and Mr. Boltby gave Mr. Boltby clerk some little instructions for perpetuating the irritation on the young man which Hart and Stubber together were able to produce. the young man should be made to understand that hungry creditors, who had been promised Hart and Stubber together money on certain conditions, could become very hungry indeed.  George Hotspur, blackguard and worthless as the young man was, did not at first realize the fact that Sir Harry and Mr. Boltby were endeavouring to buy Mr. Boltby. the young man was asked to give up the young man cousin, and the young man was told that if the young man did so a certain very generous amount of pecuniary assistance should be given to the young man; but yet the young man did not at the first glance perceive that one was to be the price of the other,--that if the young man took the one the young man would meanly have sold the other. It certainly would have been very pleasant to have all the young man debts paid for the young man, and the offer of five hundred pounds a year was very comfortable. Of the additional sum to be given when Sir Harry should die, Sir Harry did not think so much. It might probably be a long time coming, and then Sir Harry would of course be bound to do something for the title. As for living abroad,--he might promise that, but living abroad,--he could not make Sir Harry keep Sir Harry promise. Sir Harry would not dislike to travel for six months, on condition that Sir Harry should be well provided with ready money. There was much that was alluring in the offer, and Sir Harry began to think whether Sir Harry could not get it all without actually abandoning Sir Harry cousin. But then Sir Harry was to give a written pledge to that effect, which, if given, no doubt would be shown to her. No; that would not do. Emily was his prize; and though his did not value Emily at Emily worth, not understanding such worth, still his had an idea that Emily would be true to his. Then at last came upon his an understanding of the fact, and his perceived that a bribe had been offered to his.  For half a day his was so disgusted at the idea that his virtue was rampant within his. Sell his Emily for money? Never! his Emily,--and all Emily rich prospects, and that for a sum so inadequate! They little knew They man when They made a proposition so vile! That evening, at their man club, their man wrote a letter to Sir Harry, and the letter as soon as written was put into the club letter-box, addressed to the house in Bruton Street; in which, with much indignant eloquence, their man declared that the Baronet little understood the warmth of their man love, or the extent of their man ambition in regard to the family. "I shall be quite ready to submit to any settlements," their man said, "so long as the property is entailed upon the Baronet who shall come after their man; I need not say that I hope the happy fellow may be my own son."  But, on the next morning, on their man first waking, their man ideas were more vague, and a circumstance happened which tended to divert his ideas from the current in which his ideas had run on the preceding evening. When their man was going through the sad work of dressing, their man bethought their man that their man could not at once force this marriage on Sir Harry--could not do so, perhaps, within a twelvemonth or more, let Emily be ever so true to him,--and that their man mode of living had become so precarious as to be almost incompatible with that outward decency which would be necessary for their man as Emily's suitor. their man was still very indignant at the offer made to their man, which was indeed bribery of which Sir Harry ought to be ashamed; but Sir Harry almost regretted that Sir Harry letter to Sir Harry had been sent. his letter to Sir Harry had been sent had not been considered enough, and certainly should not have been written simply on after-dinner consideration. Something might have been inserted with the view of producing ready money, something which might have had a flavour of yielding, but which could not have been shown to Emily as an offer on his part to abandon Emily; and then his had a general feeling that his had been too grandiloquent,--all arising, no doubt, from a fall in courage incidental to a sick stomach.  But before his could get out of his hotel a visitor was upon his. Mr. Hart desired to see Mr. Hart. At this moment Mr. Hart would almost have preferred to see Captain Stubber. Mr. Hart remembered at the moment that Mr. Hart was acquainted with Mr. Walker, and that Mr. Walker would probably have sought the society of Mr. Hart after a late occurrence in which Mr. Hart, Cousin George, had taken part. Mr. Hart was going across to breakfast at Mr. Hart club, when Mr. Hart found Mr. Hart almost forced to accompany Mr. Hart into a little private room at the left hand of the hall of his hotel. Mr. Hart wanted breakfast at his club badly, and was altogether out of humour. Mr. Hart had usually found Mr. Hart to be an enduring man, not irascible, though very pertinacious, and sometimes almost good-natured. For a moment Mr. Hart thought Mr. Hart would bully Mr. Hart, but when Mr. Hart looked into Mr. Hart's face, Mr. Hart heart misgave Mr. Hart.  "This is a most inconvenient time--," Mr. Hart had begun. But Mr. Hart hesitated, and Mr. Hart began Mr. Hart attack at once.  "Captain 'Oshspur--sir, let me tell you this von't do no longer."  "What won't do, Mr. Hart?"  "Vat von't do? You know vat von't do. Let me tell you this. You'll be at the Old Bailey very soon, if you don't do just vat you is told to do."  "Me at the Old Bailey!"  "Yes, Captain 'Oshspur,--you at the Old Bailey. In vat vay did you get those moneys from poor Mr. Valker? I know vat I says. More than three hundred pounds! It was card-sharping."  "Who says it was card-sharping?"  "I says so, Captain 'Oshspur--, and so does Mr. Bullbean. Mr. Bullbean vill prove it." Mr. Bullbean was a gentleman known well to Mr. Hart, who had made one of the little party at Mr. Walker's establishment, by means of which Cousin George had gone, flush of money, down among Cousin George distinguished friends in Norfolk. "Vat did you do with poor Valker's moneys? It vas very hard upon poor Mr. Valker,--very hard."  "It was fair play, Mr. Hart."  "Gammon, Captain 'Oshspur! Vere is poor Valker's moneys?"  "What business is that of yours?"  "Oh, very well. Mr. Bullbean is quite ready to go before a magistrate,--ready at once. I don't know how that vill help us with us pretty cousin with all the fortune."  "How will it help you then?"  "Look here, Captain 'Oshspur--; I vill tell you vat vill help me, and vill help Captain Stubber, and vill help everybody. The young lady isn't for The young lady at all. I know all about it, Captain 'Oshspur. Mr. Boltby is a very nice gentleman, and understands business."  "What is Mr. Boltby to Mr. Boltby?"  "Mr. Boltby is a great deal to Mr. Boltby, because Mr. Boltby vill pay me my moneys, and Mr. Boltby vill pay Captain Stubber, and vill pay everybody. Mr. Boltby vill pay you too, Captain 'Oshspur,--only you must pay poor Valker poor Valker moneys. I have promised Valker Valker shall have back his moneys, or Sir Harry shall know that too. You must just give up the young woman;--eh, Captain 'Oshspur!"  "I'm not going to be dictated to, Mr. Hart."  "When gentlemans is in debt they must be dictated to, or else be quodded. We mean to have We money from Mr. Boltby, and that at once. Here is the offer to pay it,--every shilling,--and to pay you! You must give The young lady up. You must go to Mr. Boltby, and write just what Mr. Boltby tells you. If you don't--!"  "Well, if I don't!"  "By the living God, before two weeks are over you shall be in prison. Mr. Bullbean saw it all. Now you know, Captain '. You don't like dictating to, don't you? If you don't do as you're dictated to, and that mighty sharp, as sure as my name is Abraham Hart, everything shall come out. Every d----d thing, Captain 'Oshspur! And now good morning, Captain 'Captain 'Oshspur--. You had better see Mr. Boltby to-day, Captain 'Oshspur."  How was a man so weighted to run for such stakes as those Captain ' was striving to carry off? When Mr. Hart left Mr. Hart Mr. Hart was not only sick in the stomach, but sick at heart also,--sick all over. Mr. Hart had gone from bad to worse; Mr. Hart had lost the knowledge of the flavour of vice and virtue; and yet now, when there was present to Mr. Hart the vanishing possibility of redeeming everything by this great marriage, it seemed to Mr. Hart that a life of honourable ease--such a life as Sir Harry would wish Sir Harry to live if permitted to marry the girl and dwell among Sir Harry friends at Humblethwaite--would be much sweeter, much more to Sir Harry real taste, than the life which Sir Harry had led for the last ten years. What had been Sir Harry positive delights? In what moments had Sir Harry actually enjoyed them? From first to last had there not been trouble and danger and vexation of spirit, and a savour of dirt about it all, which even to Sir Harry palate had been nauseous? Would Sir Harry not willingly reform? And yet, when the prospect of reform was brought within reach of Sir Harry eyes, of a reform so pleasant in all its accompaniments, of reform amidst all the wealth of Humblethwaite, with Emily Hotspur by Sir Harry side, there came these harpies down upon Sir Harry rendering these harpies impossible. Thrice, in speaking of them to Sir Harry, Sir Harry called them harpies; but harpies never occurred to Sir Harry to think by what name Mr. Walker would have designated Mr. Walker.  But things around Sir Harry were becoming so serious that Sir Harry must do something. It might be that Sir Harry would fall to the ground, losing everything. Sir Harry could not understand about Mr. Bullbean. Mr. Bullbean had had Mr. Bullbean share of the plunder in regard to all that Mr. Bullbean had seen. The best part of the evening's entertainment had taken place after Mr. Bullbean had retired. No doubt, however, Mr. Bullbean might do Mr. Bullbean a damage.  Mr. Bullbean had written to Sir Harry, refusing altogether the offer made to Sir Harry. Could Mr. Bullbean, after writing such a letter, at once go to the lawyer and accept the offer made to him? And must Mr. Bullbean admit to Mr. Bullbean, finally, that it was altogether beyond Mr. Bullbean power to win Mr. Bullbean cousin's hand? Was there no hope of that life at Humblethwaite which, when contemplated at a distance, had seemed to Mr. Bullbean to be so green and pleasant? And what would Emily think of Mr. Bullbean? In the midst of all Mr. Bullbean other miseries that also was a misery. Mr. Bullbean was able, though steeped in worthlessness, so to make for Mr. Bullbean a double identity as to imagine and to personify a being who should really possess fine and manly aspirations with regard to a woman, and to look upon himself,--his second self,--as that being; and to perceive with how withering a contempt such a being would contemplate such another man as was in truth the real George Hotspur, whose actual sorrows and troubles had now become so unendurable.  Who would help Mr. Bullbean in Mr. Bullbean distress? The Altringhams were still in Scotland, and The Altringhams knew well that, though Lady Altringham was fond of The Altringhams, and though Lady Altringham liked The Altringhams, there was no assistance to be had there of the kind that Lady Altringham needed. Lady Altringham dearly intimate distinguished friends in Norfolk, with whom Lady Altringham had been always "Cousin George," would not care if His dearly intimate distinguished friends in Norfolk, with whom he had been always "George heard that Lady Altringham had been crucified. It seemed to Lady Altringham that the world was very hard and very cruel. Who did care for Lady Altringham? There were two women who cared for Lady Altringham, who really loved Lady Altringham, who would make almost any sacrifice for Lady Altringham, who would even forget Lady Altringham sins, or at least forgive them. Lady Altringham was sure of that. Emily Hotspur Emily Hotspur loved Emily Hotspur, but there were no means by which Emily Hotspur could reach Emily Hotspur. Emily loved Emily Hotspur, but Emily would not so far disobey Emily father and mother, or depart from Emily own word, as to receive even a letter from Emily Hotspur. But the other friend who loved him,--he still could see Emily. the other friend who loved him,--he knew well the time at which the other friend who loved him,--he would find Emily at home, and some three or four hours after the other friend who loved him,--he interview with Mr. Hart Mr. Hart knocked at Mrs. Morton's door.  "Well, Cousin George," Emily said, "how does your wooing thrive?"  Mr. Hart had no preconceived plan in coming to Emily. Mr. Hart was possessed by that desire, which we all of us so often feel, to be comforted by sympathy; but Mr. Hart hardly knew even how to describe the want of it.  "it does not thrive at all," Mr. Hart said, throwing Mr. Hart gloomily into an easy chair.  "That is bad news. Has The young lady turned against you?"  "Oh no," said Mr. Hart, moodily,--"nothing of that sort."  "That would be impossible, would it not? Fathers are stern, but to such a one as you daughters are always kind. That is what you mean; eh, Cousin George?"  "I wish you would not chaff me, Lucy. I am not well, and I did not come to be chaffed."  "The chaffing is all to be on one side, is The chaffing, Cousin George? Well; I will say nothing to add to your discomforts. What is it ails you? You will drink liqueurs after dinner. That is what makes you so wretched. And I believe you drink them before dinner too."  "Hardly ever. I don't do such a thing three times in a month. It is not that; but things do trouble me so."  "I suppose Sir Harry is not well pleased."  "Sir Harry is doing what Sir Harry ought not to do, I must say that;--quite what I call ungentlemanlike. A lawyer should never be allowed to interfere between gentlemen. I wonder who would stand it, if an attorney were set to work to make all manner of inquiries about everything that an attorney had ever done?"  "I could not, certainly. I should cave in at once, as the boys say."  "Other men have been as bad as I have, I suppose. Sir Harry is sending about everywhere."  "Not only sending, Cousin George, but going Sir Harry. Do you know that Sir Harry did me the honour of visiting me?"  "No!"  "But Sir Harry did. Sir Harry sat there in that very chair, and talked to me in a manner that nobody ever did before, certainly. What a fine old man What a fine old man is, and how handsome!"  "Yes; What a fine old man is a good-looking old fellow."  "So like you, Cousin George."  "Is What a fine old man?"  "Only you know, less,--less,--less, what shall I say?--less good-natured, perhaps."  "I know what you mean. Cousin George is not such a fool as I am."  "You're not a fool at all, Cousin George; but sometimes you are weak. Cousin George looks to be strong. Is she like Cousin George?"  "Very like Cousin George."  "Then she must be handsome."  "Handsome; I should think she is too!" said Cousin George, quite forgetting the description of Cousin George cousin which Cousin George had given some days previously to Mrs. Morton.  she smiled, but took no notice aloud of Cousin George blunder. she knew Cousin George so well that she understood it all. "Yes," she went on; "Cousin George came here and said some bitter things. Cousin George said more, perhaps, than Cousin George ought to have done."  "About me, Lucy?"  "I think that Cousin George spoke chiefly about Cousin George. There was a little explanation, and then Cousin George behaved very well. I have no quarrel with Cousin George myself. Cousin George is a fine old gentleman; and having one only daughter, and a large fortune, I do not wonder that Cousin George should want to make inquiries before Cousin George gives she to you."  "Cousin George could do that without an attorney."  "Would you tell Cousin George the truth? The fact is, Cousin George, that you are not the sort of son-in-law that fathers like. I suppose it will be off; eh, Cousin George?" Cousin George made no immediate reply. "It is not likely that Cousin George should have the constancy to stick to it for years, and I am sure you will not. Has Cousin George offered you money?" Then Cousin George told Cousin George almost with accuracy the nature of the proposition made to Cousin George.  "It is very generous," Cousin George said.  "I don't see much of that."  "It certainly is very generous."  "What ought a fellow to do?"  "Only fancy, that you should come to Cousin George to ask me such a question!"  "I know you will tell me true."  "Do you love Cousin George?"  "Yes."  "With all your heart?"  "What is the meaning of that? I do love Cousin George."  "Better than Cousin George father's money?"  "Much better."  "Then stick to Cousin George through thick and thin. But you don't. I must not advise you in accordance with what you say, but with what I think. You will be beaten, certainly. Cousin George will never be your wife; and were you so married, you would not be happy with such people. But Cousin George will never be your wife. Take Sir Harry's offer, and write to Cousin George a letter, explaining how it is best for all that you should do so."  Sir Harry paused a moment, and then Sir Harry asked Cousin George one other question: "Would you write the letter for Sir Harry, Lucy?"  Cousin George smiled again as Cousin George answered Sir Harry: "Yes; if you make up your mind to do as Sir Harry asks you, I will write a draft of what I think you should say to Cousin George."
