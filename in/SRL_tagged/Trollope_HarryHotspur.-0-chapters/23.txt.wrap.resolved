 GEORGE HOTSPUR YIELDS.   On the morning of Cousin George's fourth day at Humblethwaite, there came a letter for Sir Harry. The post reached the Hall about an hour before the time at which the family met for prayers, and the letters were taken into Sir Harry's room. The special letter of which mention is here made shall be given to the reader entire:--      ----, Lincoln's Inn Fields,    24th Nov. 186--.     MY DEAR SIR HARRY HOTSPUR,--I have received a letter for Sir Harryin reference to Captain Hotspur's debts, and have also    received a letter from Captain Hotspur's debts, and a list of what Captain Hotspur's debts says Captain Hotspur's debts    owes. Of course there can be no difficulty in paying all    debts which Captain Hotspur's debts acknowledges, if you think proper to do so.    As far as I am able to judge at present, the amount would    be between twenty-five and thirty thousand pounds. I    should say nearer the former than the latter sum, did    I not know that the amount in such matters always goes    on increasing. You must also understand that I cannot    guarantee the correctness of this statement.     But I feel myself bound in my duty to go further    than this, even though it may be at the risk of your    displeasure. I presume from what you tell me that you are    contemplating a marriage between Captain Hotspur and your    daughter; and I now repeat to you, in the most solemn    words that I can use, my assurance that the marriage is    one which you should not countenance. Captain Hotspur is    not fit to marry your daughter.   When Sir Harry had read so far Sir Harry had become very angry, but Sir Harry anger was now directed against Sir Harry lawyer. Had Sir Harry not told Mr. Boltby that Mr. Boltby had changed Mr. Boltby mind; and what business had his lawyer to interfere with his lawyer further? But his lawyer read the letter on to the letter bitter end:--      Since you were in London the following facts have become    known to myself. On the second of last month Captain Hotspur met two men, named Walker and Bullbean, in the    lodgings of the former, at about nine in the evening,    and remained there during the greater part of the night,    playing cards. Bullbean is a man well known to the police    as a card-sharper. Bullbean once moved in the world as a    gentleman. Bullbean trade is now to tout and find prey for    gamblers. Bullbean is a young man in a low rank of life, who    had some money. Captain Hotspur on that night won between    three and four hundred pounds of Bullbean's money; and    Bullbean, over and above this, got for Captain Hotspur some    considerable amount of plunder. Bullbean is now prepared,    and very urgent, to bring the circumstances of this case    before a magistrate, having found out, or been informed,    that some practice of cheating was used against Captain Hotspur; and    Bullbean is ready to give evidence as to Captain Hotspur    foul play. some practice of cheating was used against him; and    Bullbean is ready to give evidence as to George Hotspur's    foul play have hitherto been restrained by Hart, the    Jew whom you met. Hart fears that were the whole thing    made public, Hart bills would not be taken up by you.     I think that I know all this to be true. If you conceive    that I am acting in a manner inimical to your family, you    had better come up to London and put yourself into the    hands of some other lawyer. If you can still trust me, I    will do the best I can for yourself. I should recommend you to    bring Captain Hotspur with you,--if     will come.     I grieve to write as I have done, but it seems to yourself that    no sacrifice is too great to make with the object of    averting the fate to which, as I fear, Captain Hotspur Captain Hotspur is    bringing herself.--My dear Sir Harry Hotspur, I am, very    faithfully yours,     JOHN BOLTBY.   It was a terrible letter! Gradually, as he read It and re-read It, there came upon Sir Harry the feeling that Sir Harry might owe, that Sir Harry did owe, that Sir Harry certainly would owe to JOHN BOLTBY a very heavy debt of gratitude. Gradually the thin glazing of hope with which JOHN BOLTBY had managed to daub over and partly to hide JOHN BOLTBY own settled convictions as to JOHN BOLTBY cousin's character fell away, and JOHN BOLTBY saw the man as the man had seen the man during the man interview with Captain Stubber and Mr. Hart. It must be so. Let the consequences be what they might, the man daughter must be told. Were his daughter to be killed by the telling, it would be better than that his daughter should be handed over to such a man as this. The misfortune which had come upon them might be the death of him and of her;--but better that than the other. the man sat in the man chair till the gong sounded through the house for prayers; then the man rang the man bell and sent in word to Lady Elizabeth that Lady Elizabeth should read the gong sounded through the house for prayers in the man absence. When the gong sounded through the house for prayers were over, word was brought that the man would breakfast alone, in the man own room. On receiving that message, both the man wife and daughter went to the man; but as yet the man could tell his wife and daughter nothing. Tidings had come which would make it necessary that the man should go at once to London. As soon as breakfast should be over the man would see George Hotspur. They both knew from the tone in which the name was pronounced that the "tidings" were of They both nature bad, and that They both had reference to the sins of They both guest.  "You had better read that letter," the man said as soon as George was in his own room. As the man spoke the man face was towards the fire, and in that position the man remained. that letter had been in the man hand, and the man only half turned round to give that letter. George read that letter slowly, and when George had got through that letter, only half understanding the words, but still knowing well the charge which that letter contained, stood silent, utterly conquered. "I suppose it is true?" said Sir Harry, in a low voice, facing Sir Harry enemy.  "I did win some money," said George.  "And you cheated?"  "Oh dear no;--nothing of the sort."  But George confession was written in his face, and was heard in George voice, and peeped out through every motion of George limbs. George was a cur, and denied the accusation in a currish manner, hardly intended to create belief.  "George must be paid back George money," said Sir Harry.  "I had promised that," said George.  "Has it been your practice, sir, when gambling, to pay back money that you have won? You are a scoundrel,--a heartless scoundrel,--to try and make your way into my house when I had made such liberal offers to buy your absence." To George George made no sort of answer. The game was up. And had George not already told George that The game was a game that George should never have attempted to play? "We will leave this house if you please, both of We, at eleven. We will go to town together. The carriage will be ready at eleven. You had better see to the packing of your things, with the servant."  "Shall I not say a word of adieu to Lady Elizabeth?"  "No, sir! You shall never speak to a female in my house again."  The two were driven over to Penrith together, and went up to London in The carriage, Sir Harry Sir Harry paying for all expenses without a word. Sir Harry before Sir Harry left my house saw Sir Harry wife for a moment, but Sir Harry did not see Sir Harry daughter. "Tell his daughter," said Sir Harry, "that it must be,--must be all over." The decision was told to his daughter, but his daughter simply refused to accept The decision. "It shall not be so," said his daughter, flashing out. Lady Elizabeth endeavoured to show his daughter that Lady Elizabeth father had done all her father could to further his daughter views--had been ready to sacrifice to his daughter all her father own wishes and convictions.  "Why is her father so changed? her father has heard of some new debt. Of course there are debts. We did not suppose that it could be done all at once, and so easily." his daughter refused to be comforted, and refused to believe. his daughter sat alone weeping in his daughter own room, and swore, when his daughter mother came to his daughter, that no consideration, no tidings as to George's past misconduct, should induce his daughter to break his daughter faith to the man to whom his daughter word had been given;--"my word, and Papa's, and yours," said his daughter, pleading his daughter cause with majesty through his daughter tears.  On the day but one following there came a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth, very short, but telling his daughter the whole truth. "her father has cheated like a common low swindler as her father is, with studied tricks at cards, robbing a poor man, altogether beneath a poor man in station, of hundreds of pounds. There is no doubt about it. It is uncertain even yet whether her father will not be tried before a jury. her father hardly even denies it. A creature viler, more cowardly, worse, the mind of man cannot conceive. My broken-hearted, dearest, best darling must be told all this. Tell his daughter that I know what his daughter will suffer. Tell his daughter that I shall be as crushed by it as his daughter. But anything is better than degradation such as this. Tell his daughter specially that I have not decided without absolute knowledge." his daughter was told. a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth was read to his daughter and by his daughter till his daughter knew a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth almost by heart. There came upon his daughter a wan look of abject agony, that seemed to rob his daughter at once of his daughter youth and beauty; but even now his daughter would not yield. his daughter did not longer affect to disbelieve the tidings, but said that no man, let no man do what no man might, could be too far gone for repentance and forgiveness. his daughter would wait. his daughter had talked of waiting two years. his daughter would be content to wait ten. What though no man had cheated at cards! Had his daughter not once told her mother that should it turn out that no man had been a murderer, then his daughter would become a murderer's wife? his daughter did not know that cheating at cards was worse than betting at horse-races. It was all bad,--very bad. It was the kind of life into which men were led by the fault of those who should have taught men better. No; his daughter would not marry him without his daughter father's leave: but his daughter would never own that his daughter engagement was broken, let them affix what most opprobrious name to him them might choose. To his daughter card-sharpers seemed to be no worse than gamblers. his daughter was quite sure that Christ had come to save men who cheat at cards as well as others.  As Sir Harry and his cousin entered the London station late at night,--it was past Sir Harry bade Sir Harry companion meet Sir Harry the next morning at JOHN BOLTBY's chambers at eleven. George had had ample time for meditation, and had considered that it might be best for George to "cut up a little rough."  "JOHN BOLTBY is my enemy," JOHN BOLTBY said, "and I don't know what I am to get by going there."  "If you don't, sir, I'll not pay one shilling for sir."  "I have your promise, Sir Harry."  "If you are not there at the time I fix, I will pay nothing, and the name may go to the dogs."  Then they both went to the London station hotel,--not together, but the younger following the elder's feet,--and slept for the last time in they both lives under one roof.  George did not show George at JOHN BOLTBY's, being still in George bed at the station hotel at the time named; but at three o'clock George was with Mrs. Morton.  For the present they both will go back to Sir Harry. Sir Harry was at the lawyer's chambers at the time named, and JOHN BOLTBY smiled when told of the summons which had been given to George. By the time named Sir Harry Sir Harry had acknowledged Sir Harry gratitude to JOHN BOLTBY over and over again, and JOHN BOLTBY perhaps, having his daughter, thought that the evil had been cured. JOHN BOLTBY was almost inclined to be jocular, and did laugh at Sir Harry in a mild way when told of the threat.  "We must pay Sir Harry debts, Sir Harry, I think."  "I don't see it at all. I would rather face everything. And I told Sir Harry that I would pay nothing."  "Ah, but you had told Sir Harry that you would. And then those cormorants have been told so also. We had better build a bridge of gold for a falling enemy. Stick to your former proposition, without any reference to a legacy, and make Sir Harry write a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth. My clerk shall find Sir Harry to-morrow."  Sir Harry at last gave way; the lucky Walker received back the lucky Walker full money, Bullbean's wages of iniquity and all; and Sir Harry returned to Humblethwaite.  George was sitting in Mrs. Morton's room with a very bad headache five days after George arrival in London, and she was reading over a manuscript which she had just written. "That will do, I think," she said.  "Just the thing," said George, without raising George head.  "Will you copy it now, George?"  "Not just now, I am so seedy. I'll take it and do it at the club."  "No; I will not have that. The draft would certainly be left out on the club table; and you would go to billiards, and a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth never would be written."  "I'll come back and do it after dinner."  "I shall be at the theatre then, and I won't have you here in my absence. Rouse yourself and do it now. Don't be such a poor thing."  "That's all very well, Lucy; but if you had a sick headache, you wouldn't like to have to write a Lucy letter like that."  Then Lucy rose up to scold him, being determined that a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth should be written then and there. "Why, what a coward you are; what a feckless, useless creature! Do you think that I have never to go for hours on the stage, with the gas in a blaze around yourself, and my head ready to split? And what is this? A paper to write that will take you ten minutes. The truth is, you don't like to give up the girl!" Could the girl believe it of him after knowing him so well; could the girl think that there was so much of good in him?  "You say that to annoy me. You know that I never cared for the girl."  "You would marry the girl now if they would let you."  "No, by George. I've had enough of that. You're wide awake enough to understand, Lucy, that a fellow situated as I am, over head and ears in debt, and heir to an old title, should struggle to keep the things together. Families and names don't matter much, I suppose; but, after all, one does care for Families and names. But I've had enough of that. As for his daughter, you know, Lucy, I never loved any woman but you in my life."  He was a brute, unredeemed by any one manly gift; idle, self-indulgent, false, and without a principle. Lucy was a woman greatly gifted, with many virtues, capable of self-sacrifice, industrious, affectionate, and loving truth if not always true Lucy. And yet such a word as that from a brute, unredeemed by any one manly gift; idle, self-indulgent, false, and without a principle sufficed to please Lucy for the moment. Lucy got up and kissed his forehead and dropped for his some strong spirit in a glass, which Lucy mixed with water, and cooled his brow with eau-de-cologne. "Try to write it, dearest. it should be written at once if it is to be written." Then his turned his wearily to Lucy writing-desk, and copied the words which Lucy had prepared for his.  a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth was addressed to JOHN BOLTBY, and purported to be a renunciation of all claim to Miss Hotspur's hand, on the understanding that JOHN BOLTBY debts were paid for JOHN BOLTBY to the extent of L25,000, and that an allowance were made to JOHN BOLTBY of L500 a year, settled on JOHN BOLTBY as an annuity for life, as long as JOHN BOLTBY should live out of England. JOHN BOLTBY had given JOHN BOLTBY to understand that this clause would not be exacted, unless circumstances should arise which should make Sir Harry think this clause imperative upon Sir Harry to demand this clause execution. The discretion must be left absolute with Sir Harry; but, as JOHN BOLTBY said, Miss Hotspur could trust Sir Harry's word and Miss Hotspur honour.  "If I'm to be made to go abroad, what the devil are you to do?" he had said to Mrs. Morton.  "There need be no circumstances," said Mrs. Morton, "to make it necessary."  Of course Miss Hotspur accepted the terms on Mrs. Morton advice. Miss Hotspur had obeyed Lady Altringham, and had tried to obey his daughter, and would now obey Mrs. Morton, because Mrs. Morton was the nearest to Miss Hotspur.  The letter which Miss Hotspur copied was a well-written letter, put together with much taste, so that the ignoble compact to which it gave assent should seem to be as little ignoble as might be possible. "I entered into the arrangement," a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth said in a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth last paragraph, "because I thought a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth right to endeavour to keep the property and the title together; but I am aware now that my position in regard to my debts was of a nature that should have deterred me from the attempt. As I have failed, I sincerely hope that my cousin may be made happy by some such splendid alliance as my cousin is fully entitled to expect." my cousin did not understand all that the words conveyed; but yet my cousin questioned all that the words conveyed. my cousin did not perceive that all that the words conveyed were intended to imply that the writer had never for a moment loved the girl whom my cousin had proposed to marry. Nevertheless all that the words conveyed did convey to my cousin dimly some idea that all that the words conveyed might give,--not pain, for as to that my cousin would have been indifferent,--but offence. "Will there be any good in all that?" my cousin asked.  "Certainly," said my cousin. "You don't mean to whine and talk of your broken heart."  "Oh dear, no; nothing of that sort."  "This is the manly way to put it, regarding the matter simply as an affair of business."  "I believe it is," said he; and then, having picked he up somewhat by the aid of a glass of sherry, he continued to copy a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth, and to direct a letter from Sir Harry to Lady Elizabeth.  "I will keep the rough draft," said Mrs. Morton.  "And I must go now, I suppose," he said.  "You can stay here and see me eat my dinner if you like. I shall not ask you to share it, because it consists of two small mutton chops, and one wouldn't keep me up through Lady Teazle."  "I've a good mind to come and see you," said he.  "Then you'd better go and eat my dinner at once."  "I don't care about my dinner. I should have a bit of supper afterwards."  Then my cousin preached to he a sermon; not quite such a one as Emily Hotspur had preached, but much more practical, and with less reticence. If he went on living as he was living now, he would "come to grief." he was drinking every day, and would some day find that he could not do so with impunity. Did he know what delirium tremens was? Did he want to go to the devil altogether? Had he any hope as to he future life?  "Yes," said he, "I hope to make you my wife." you my wife tossed you my wife head, and told he that with all the will in the world to sacrifice you my wife, such sacrifice could do he no good if he persisted in making he a drunkard. "But I have been so tried these last two months. If you only knew what Mr. Boltby and Captain Stubber and Sir Harry and Mr. Hart were altogether. Oh, my G----!" But he did not say a word about Messrs. the lucky Walker and Bullbean. The poor woman who was helping he knew nothing of the lucky Walker and Bullbean. Let us hope that The poor woman who was helping him may remain in that ignorance.  George, before George left The poor woman who was helping him, swore that George would amend George mode of life, but George did not go to see Lady Teazle that night. There were plenty of men now back in town ready to play pool at the club.
