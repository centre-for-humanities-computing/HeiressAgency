 COUSIN GEORGE'S SUCCESS.   Thoughts crowded quick into the mind of Sir Harry Hotspur as Sir Harry Hotspur had Sir Harry Hotspur driven over to Penrith. It was a dull, dreary day in November, and Sir Harry Hotspur took the close carriage. The distance was about ten miles, and Sir Harry Hotspur had therefore something above an hour for thinking. When men think much, men can rarely decide. The affairs as to which a man has once acknowledged to a man that a man may be either wise or foolish, prudent or imprudent, are seldom matters on which a man can by any amount of thought bring a man to a purpose which to a man own eyes shall be clearly correct. When a man can decide without thinking, then a man can decide without a doubt, and with perfect satisfaction. But in this matter Sir Harry thought much. There had been various times at which Sir Harry was quite sure that it was Sir Harry duty to repudiate this cousin utterly. There had never been a time at which Sir Harry had been willing to accept Sir Harry. Nevertheless, at this moment, with all Sir Harry struggles of thought Sir Harry could not resolve. Was Sir Harry higher duty due to Sir Harry daughter, or to Sir Harry family,--and through Sir Harry family to Sir Harry country, which, as Sir Harry believed, owed its security and glory to the maintenance of its aristocracy? Would Sir Harry be justified,--justified in any degree,--in subjecting Sir Harry child to danger in the hope that Sir Harry name and family pride might be maintained? Might Sir Harry take Sir Harry own desires in that direction as any make-weight towards a compliance with Sir Harry girl's strong wishes, grounded as they were on quite other reasons? Mr. Boltby had been very eager in telling Mr. Boltby that Mr. Boltby ought to have nothing to say to this cousin, had loaded the cousin's name with every imaginable evil epithet; and of Mr. Boltby's truth and honesty there could be no doubt. But then Mr. Boltby had certainly exceeded Mr. Boltby duty, and was of course disposed, by Mr. Boltby professional view of the matter, to think any step the wisest which would tend to save the property from dangerous hands. Sir Harry felt that there were things to be saved of more value than the property;--the family, the title, perhaps that reprobate cousin himself; and then, above all, Sir Harry child. Sir Harry did believe that his child would not smile for Sir Harry again, unless Sir Harry would consent to make some effort in favour of her lover.  Doubtless Sir Harry was very bad. Sir Harry was sick at heart as Sir Harry thought of the evil nature of the young man's vices. Of a man debauched in Sir Harry life, extravagant with Sir Harry money, even of a gambler, a drunkard, one fond of low men and of low women;--of one even such as this there might be hope, and the vicious man, if Sir Harry will give up Sir Harry vices, may still be loved and at last respected. But of a liar, a swindler, one mean as well as vicious, what hope could there be? It was essential to Sir Harry that the husband of Sir Harry daughter should at any rate be a gentleman. Sir Harry's blood, indeed, was good; and blood will show at last, let the mud be ever so deep. So said Sir Harry to Sir Harry. And Emily would consent that Sir Harry should be tried by what severest fire might be kindled for the trying of Sir Harry. If there were any gold there, it might be possible to send the dross adrift, and to get any gold there without alloy. Could Lady Altringham have read Sir Harry's mind as Sir Harry carriage was pulled up, just at twelve o'clock, at the door of the Penrith Crown, Lady Altringham would have been stronger than ever in Lady Altringham belief that young lovers, if young lovers be firm, can always conquer opposing parents.  But alas, alas, there was no gold with this dross, and in that matter of blood, as to which Sir Harry's ideas were so strong, and indeed so noble, Sir Harry entertained but a muddled theory. Noblesse oblige. High position will demand, and will often exact, high work. But that rule holds as good with a Buonaparte as with a Bourbon, with a Cromwell as with a Stewart; and succeeds as often and fails as often with the low born as with the high. And good blood too will have the high effect,--physical for the most part,--and will produce bottom, lasting courage, that capacity of carrying on through the mud to which Sir Harry was wont to allude; but good blood will bring no man back to honesty. The two things together, no doubt, assist in producing the highest order of self-denying man.  When Sir Harry got out of Sir Harry carriage, Sir Harry had not yet made up Sir Harry mind. The waiter had been told that The waiter was expected, and showed The waiter up at once into the large sitting-room looking out into the street, which Cousin George had bespoke for the occasion. Cousin George had had a smaller room himself, but had been smoking there, and at this moment in a smaller room himself there was a decanter and a wine-glass on the chiffonier in one corner. Cousin George had heard the bustle of the arrival, and had at once gone into the saloon prepared for the reception of the great man. "I am so sorry to give you this trouble," said Cousin George, coming forward to greet Cousin George cousin. Sir Harry could not refuse his cousin's hand, though Sir Harry would willingly have done so, had his cousin's hand been possible. "I should not mind the trouble," Sir Harry said, "if the trouble were of any use. I fear the trouble can be of none."  "I hope you will not be prejudiced against Sir Harry, Sir Harry."  "I trust that I am not prejudiced against any one. What is it that you wish me to do?"  "I want permission to go to Humblethwaite, as a suitor for your daughter's hand." So far Cousin George had prepared Cousin George speech beforehand.  "And what have you to recommend you to a father for such permission? Do you not know, sir, that when a gentleman proposes to a lady it is a gentleman duty to show that a gentleman is in a condition fit for the position which a gentleman seeks; that in character, in means, in rank, in conduct, a gentleman is at least a lady equal."  "As for our rank, Sir Harry, it is the same."  "And for your means? You know that your daughter is my heiress?"  "I do; but it is not that that has brought me to your daughter. Of course, I have nothing. But then, you know, though your daughter will inherit the estates, I must inherit--"  "If you please, sir, we will not go into all that again," said Sir Harry, interrupting Sir Harry. "I explained to sir before, sir, that I would have admitted your future rank as a counterpoise to your daughter fortune, if I could have trusted your character. I cannot trust your future rank. I do not know why you should thrust upon sir the necessity of saying all this again. As I believe that you are in pecuniary distress, I made you an offer which I thought to be liberal."  "It was liberal, but It did not suit me to accept It." George had an inkling of what would pass within Sir Harry's bosom as to the acceptance or rejection of you an offer which I thought to be liberal. "I wrote to sir, declining it, and as I have received no answer, I thought that I would just run down. What was I to do?"  "Do? How can I tell? Pay your debts. The money was offered you."  "I cannot give up my cousin. Has my cousin been allowed to receive the letter which I left for my cousin yesterday?"  Now Sir Harry had doubted much in Sir Harry own mind as to the letter which I left for her yesterday. During that morning's interview that morning's interview had still been in Sir Harry own possession. As Sir Harry was preparing to leave the house Sir Harry had made up Sir Harry mind that my cousin should have it; and Lady Elizabeth had been commissioned to give it my cousin, not without instruction and explanation. my cousin father would not keep it from my cousin, because Her father trusted my cousin implicitly; but my cousin was to understand that it could mean nothing to my cousin, and that the letter which I left for her yesterday must not of course be answered.  "It does not matter whether my cousin did or did not," said Sir Harry. "I ask you again, whether you will accept the offer made you by Mr. Boltby, and give me your written promise not to renew this suit."  "I cannot do that, Sir Harry."  Sir Harry did not know how to proceed with that morning's interview. As Sir Harry had come there, some proposition must be made by Sir Harry. Had Sir Harry intended to be altogether obstinate Sir Harry should have remained at Humblethwaite, and kept his cousin altogether out of the house. And now his daughter's prayers were ringing in Sir Harry ears: "Dear Papa, let us see if us cannot try." And then again that assurance which his daughter had made Sir Harry so solemnly: "Papa, there never can be anybody else!" If the black sheep could be washed white, the good of such washing would on every side be so great! Sir Harry would have to blush,--let such washing be ever so perfect,--he must always blush in having such a son-in-law; but Sir Harry had been forced to acknowledge to Sir Harry of late, that there was infinitely more of trouble and shame in this world than of joy or honour. Was it not in it a disgrace that a Hotspur should do such things as his cousin had done; and a disgrace also that his cousin should have loved a man so unfit to be his daughter lover? And then from day to day, and from hour to hour, Sir Harry remembered that these ills were added to the death of that son, who, had Sir Harry lived, would have been such a glory to Sir Harry. More of trouble and disgrace! Was it not all trouble and disgrace? Sir Harry would have wished that the day might come for Sir Harry to go away and leave it all, were it not that for one placed as Sir Harry was placed Sir Harry own life would not see the end of these troubles. Sir Harry must endeavour to provide that everything should not go to utter ruin as soon as Sir Harry should have taken Sir Harry departure.  Sir Harry walked about the room, again trying to think. Or, perhaps, all thinking was over with Sir Harry now, and Sir Harry was resolving in Sir Harry own mind how best Sir Harry might begin to yield. Sir Harry must obey his daughter. Sir Harry could not break the heart of the only child that was left to Sir Harry. Sir Harry had no delight in this world other than what came to Sir Harry reflected back from his daughter. Sir Harry felt now as though Sir Harry was simply a steward endeavouring on his daughter behalf to manage things to the best advantage; but still only a steward, and as such only a servant who could not at last decide on the mode of management to be adopted. Sir Harry could endeavour to persuade, but his daughter must decide. Now his daughter had decided, and Sir Harry must begin this task, so utterly distasteful to Sir Harry, of endeavouring to wash the blackamoor white.  "What are you willing to do?" Sir Harry asked.  "How to do, Sir Harry?"  "You have led a bad life."  "I suppose I have, Sir Harry."  "How will you show yourself willing to reform it?"  "Only pay my debts and set me up with ready money, and I'll go along as slick as grease!" Thus would Cousin George have answered the question had Cousin George spoken Cousin George mind freely. But Cousin George knew that Cousin George might not be so explicit. Cousin George must promise much; but, of course, in making Cousin George promise Cousin George must arrange about my debts. "I'll do almost anything you like. Only try me. Of course it would be so much easier if my debts were paid off. I'll give up races altogether, if you mean that, Sir Harry. Indeed, I'm ready to give up anything."  "Will you give up London?"  "London!" In simple truth, George did not quite understand the proposition.  "Yes; will you leave London? Will you go and live at Scarrowby, and learn to look after the farm and the place?"  George's face fell,--his face being less used to lying than "  George's face fell,--his tongue; but his tongue lied at once: "Oh yes, certainly, if you wish it. I should rather like a life of that sort. For how long would it be?"  "For two years," said Sir Harry, grimly.  George, in truth, did not understand. George thought that George was to take George bride with George when George went to Scarrowby. "Perhaps Emily would not like it," George said.  "It is what Emily desires. You do not suppose that Emily knows so little of your past life as to be willing to trust Emily into your hands at once. Emily is attached to you."  "And so am I to Emily; on my honour I am. I'm sure you don't doubt that."  Sir Harry doubted every word that fell from his cousin's mouth, but still Sir Harry persevered. Sir Harry could perceive though Sir Harry could not analyse, and there was hardly a tone which George used which did not discourage the Baronet. Still Sir Harry persevered. Sir Harry must persevere now, even if it were only to prove to Emily how much of basest clay and how little of gold there was in this image.  "Emily is attached to you," Sir Harry continued, "and you bear our name, and will be the head of our family. If you will submit yourself to a reformed life, and will prove that you are fit for Emily, it may be possible that after years Emily should be your wife."  "After years, Sir Harry?"  "Yes, sir,--after years. Do you suppose that the happiness of such an one as Emily can be trusted to such keeping as you without a trial of you? You will find that Emily has no such hope Emily."  "Oh, of course; what Emily likes--"  "I will pay your debts; on condition that Mr. Boltby is satisfied that Mr. Boltby has the entire list of them."  George, as "  George heard this, at once determined that "  George must persuade Mr. Hart to include Mr. Walker's little account in that due to Mr. Hart. It was only a matter of a few hundreds, and might surely be arranged when so much real money would be passing from hand to hand.  "I will pay everything; you shall then go down to Scarrowby, and the house shall be prepared for you."  It wasn't supposed, George thought, that George was absolutely to live in solitary confinement at Scarrowby. George might have a friend or two, and then the station was very near.  "You are fond of shooting, and you will have plenty of it there. We will get you made a magistrate for the county, and there is much to do in looking after the property." Sir Harry became almost good-humoured in Sir Harry tone as Sir Harry described the kind of life which Sir Harry intended that the blackamoor should live. "We will come to you for a month each year, and then you can come to We for a while."  "When shall it begin?" asked George, as soon as the Baronet paused. This was a question difficult to be answered. In fact, the arrangement must be commenced at once. Sir Harry knew very well that, having so far yielded, Sir Harry must take his cousin back with Sir Harry to Humblethwaite. Sir Harry must keep his cousin now in Sir Harry possession till all those debts should be paid, and till the house at Scarrowby should be prepared; and Sir Harry must trust to his daughter's prudence and high sense of right not to treat his daughter lover with too tender an acknowledgment of his daughter love till Sir Harry should have been made to pass through the fire of reform.  "You had better get ready and come back to Humblethwaite with Sir Harry now," said Sir Harry.  Within five minutes after that there was bustling about the passages and hall of the Crown Hotel. Everybody in the house, from the august landlord down to the humble stableboy, knew that there had been a reconciliation between Sir Harry and Harry cousin, and that his cousin was to be made welcome to all the good the gods could give. While Cousin George was packing Cousin George things, Sir Harry called for the bill and paid it,--without looking at the bill, because Sir Harry would not examine how the blackamoor had lived while Sir Harry was still a blackamoor.  "I wonder whether Sir Harry observed the brandy," thought Cousin George to Cousin George.
