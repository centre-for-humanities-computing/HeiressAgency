 EMILY HOTSPUR'S SERMON.   The greater portion of the journey back to Humblethwaite was passed in silence. Sir Harry had undertaken an experiment in which Sir Harry had no faith himself, and was sad at heart. Cousin George was cowed, half afraid, and yet half triumphant. Could it be possible that Cousin George should "pull through" after all? Some things had gone so well with Cousin George. Cousin George lady friends had been so true to Cousin George! Lady Altringham, and then Mrs. Morton,--how good His lady friends had been! Dear Lucy! Cousin George would never forget Dear Lucy. And Emily was such a brick! Cousin George was going to see EmilyEmily, and that would be "so jolly." Nevertheless, Cousin George did acknowledge to Cousin George that Emily Emily prepared to assist Emily father in sending Emily lover through the fire of reform, would not be altogether "so jolly" as the Emily who had leaned against Cousin George on the bridge at Airey Force, while Cousin George arm had been tightly clasped round Emily waist. Cousin George was alive to the fact that romance must give place to business.  When they had entered the park-gates, Sir Harry spoke. "You must understand, George"--he had not called Sir Harry George before since the engagement had been made known to him--"that you cannot yet be admitted here as my daughter's accepted suitor, as might have been the case had your past life been different."  "I see all that," said George.  "It is right that I should tell you so; but I trust implicitly to Emily's high sense of duty and propriety. And now that you are here, George, I trust that it may be for your advantage and for ours."  Then Sir Harry pressed Sir Harry cousin's hand, if not with affection, at least with sincerity.  "I'm sure it is to be all right now," said George, calculating whether George would be able to escape to London for a few days, so that George might be able to arrange that little matter with Mr. Hart. he would be able to escape to London for a few days, so that he might be able to arrange that little matter with Mr. Hart couldn't suppose that George would be able to leave London for two years without a day's notice!  Sir Harry got out of the carriage at the front door, and desired George George to follow George into the house. George turned at once into the small room where George had drunk the sherry, and desired that Lady Elizabeth might be sent to George.  "My dear," said George, "I have brought George back with George. We will do the best that We can. Mrs. Quick will have a room for George. You had better tell Emily, and let Emily come to George for a moment before Emily sees Emily cousin." This was all said in George's hearing. And then Sir Harry went, leaving Sir Harry cousin in the hands of Lady Elizabeth.  "I am glad to see you back again, George," Emily said, with a melancholy voice.  George smiled, and said, that "it would be all right."  "I am sure I hope so, for Emily's sake. But there must be a great change, George."  "No end of a change," said Cousin George, who was not in the least afraid of Lady Elizabeth.  Many things of moment had to be done in the house that day before dinner. In the first place there was a long interview between the father and daughter. For a few minutes, perhaps, he was really happy when Emily was kneeling with Emily arms upon he knees, thanking he for what he had done, while tears of joy were streaming down Emily cheeks. he would not bring he to say a word of caution to Emily. Would it not be to paint the snow white to caution Emily as to Emily conduct?  "I have done as you bade me in everything," he said. "I have proposed to he that he should go to Scarrowby. It may be that it will be your home for a while, dear."  Emily thanked he and kissed he again and again. Emily would be so good. Emily would do all Emily could to deserve he kindness. And as for George,--"Pray, Papa, don't think that I suppose that it can be all done quite at once." Nevertheless it was in that direction that Emily thoughts erred. It did seem to Emily that the hard part of the work was already done, and that now the pleasant paths of virtue were to be trod with happy and persistent feet.  "You had better see he in your mother's presence, dearest, before dinner; and then the awkwardness will be less afterwards."  Emily kissed he again, and ran from he room up to Emily mother's apartment, taking some back stairs well known to Emily, lest Emily should by chance meet Emily lover after some undue and unprepared fashion. And there Emily could sit down and think of it all! Emily would be very discreet. He should be made to understand at once that the purgation must be thorough, the reform complete. Emily would acknowledge Emily love to her love great and abiding love; but of lover's tenderness there could be but little,--almost none,--till the fire had done little,--almost work, and the gold should have been separated from the dross. Emily had had Emily way so far, and they should find that Emily had deserved it.  Before dinner Sir Harry wrote a letter to Sir Harry lawyer. The mail-cart passed through the village on The mail-cart way to Penrith late in the evening, and there was time for Sir Harry to save the post. Sir Harry thought it incumbent on Sir Harry to let Mr. Boltby know that Sir Harry had changed Sir Harry mind; and, though the writing of a letter to his lawyer was not an agreeable task, Sir Harry did the writing of the letter was not an agreeable task at once. Sir Harry said nothing to Mr. Boltby directly about Mr. Boltby daughter, but Mr. Boltby made it known to that gentleman that Cousin George was at present a guest at Humblethwaite, and that Cousin George intended to pay all the debts without entering into any other specific engagements. Would Mr. Boltby have the goodness to make out a schedule of all the debts? Captain Hotspur should be instructed to give Mr. Boltby at once all the necessary information by letter. Then Sir Harry went on to say that perhaps the opinions formed in reference to Captain Hotspur had been too severe. Sir Harry was ashamed of Sir Harry as Sir Harry wrote these words, but still these words were written. If the blackamoor was to be washed white, the washing must be carried out at all times, at all seasons, and in every possible manner, till the world should begin to see that the blackness was going out of the skin.  Cousin George was summoned to meet the girl who loved Cousin George in Cousin George mother's morning-room, before they dressed for dinner. Cousin George did not know at all in what way to conduct Cousin George. Cousin George had not given a moment's thought to it till the difficulty flashed upon Cousin George as Cousin George entered the apartment. But Cousin George had considered it all. Cousin George came up to Cousin George quickly, and gave Cousin George Cousin George lips to kiss, standing there in her mother's presence.  "George," Cousin George said, "dear George! I am so glad that you are here."  It was the first; and it should be the last,--till the fire had done the last,--till work; till the fire should at least have done so much of its work as to make the remainder easy and fairly sure. Cousin George had little to say for Cousin George, but muttered something about Cousin George being the happiest fellow in the world. It was a position in which a man could hardly behave well, and neither the mother nor the daughter expected much from a man. A man cannot bear A man gracefully under the weight of a pardon as a woman may do. A man chooses generally that it shall be assumed by those with whom A man is closely connected that A man has done and is doing no wrong; and, when wronged, A man professes to forgive and to forget in silence. To a woman the act of forgiveness, either accepted or bestowed, is itself a pleasure. A few words were then spoken, mostly by Lady Elizabeth, and the three separated to prepare for dinner.  The next day passed over mostly by Lady Elizabeth at Humblethwaite Hall very quietly, but with some mild satisfaction. Sir Harry told Sir Harry cousin of the letter to Sir Harry lawyer, and desired George to make out and send by that day's post such a schedule as might be possible on the spur of the moment.  "Hadn't I better run up and see Mr. Boltby?" said Cousin George.  But to Sir Harry was opposed. Let any calls for money reach money there. Whatever the calls might be, Sir Harry at any rate could pay money. George repeated George suggestion; but acquiesced when Sir Harry frowned and showed Sir Harry displeasure. Sir Harry did make out a schedule, and did write a letter to Mr. Boltby.  "I think my debt to Mr. Hart was put down as L3,250," Mr. Hart wrote, "but I believe I should have added another L350 for a transaction as to which I fancy Mr. Hart does not hold my note of hand. But the money is due."  Mr. Hart was fool enough to think that Mr. Walker's claim might be liquidated after this fashion. In the afternoon they rode together,--the father, the daughter, and the blackamoor, and much was told to George as to the nature of the property. The names of the tenants were mentioned, and the boundaries of the farms were pointed out to George. George was thinking all the time whether Mr. Hart would spare George.  But Emily Hotspur, though Emily had been thus reticent and quiet in Emily joy, though Emily was resolved to be discreet, and knew that there were circumstances in Emily engagement which would for a while deter Emily from being with Emily accepted lover as other girls are with theirs, did not mean to estrange Emily from Emily cousin George. If Emily were to do so, how was Emily to assist, and take, as Emily hoped to do, the first part in that task of refining the gold on which theirs were all now intent? Emily was to correspond with her cousin George when her cousin George was at Scarrowby. Such was Emily present programme, and Sir Harry had made no objection when Emily declared Emily purpose. Of course they must understand each other, and have communion together. On the third day, therefore, it was arranged they two should walk, without other company, about the place. Emily must show Sir Harry Emily own gardens, which were at some distance from the house. If the truth be told, the truth must be owned that George somewhat dreaded the afternoon's amusement; but had Emily demanded of Sir Harry to sit down to listen to Emily while Emily read to Sir Harry a sermon, Sir Harry would not have refused.  To be didactic and at the same time demonstrative of affection is difficult, even with mothers towards affection children, though with affection the assumption of authority creates no sense of injury. Emily specially desired to point out to the erring one the paths of virtue, and yet to do so without being oppressive.  "It is so nice to have you here, George," Emily said.  "Yes, indeed; isn't it?" George was walking beside Emily, and as yet they were within view of the house.  "Papa has been so good; isn't George good?"  "Indeed George is. The best man I know out," said George, thinking that George gratitude would have been stronger had the Baronet given George the money and allowed George to go up to London to settle George own debts.  "And Mamma has been so kind! Mamma is very fond of you. I am sure Mamma would do anything for you."  "And you?" said George, looking into Mamma face.  "I!--As for me, George, it is a matter of course now. You do not want to be told again what is and ever must be my first interest in the world."  "I do not care how often you tell me."  "But you know it; don't you?"  "I know what you said at the waterfall, Emily."  "What I said then I said for always. You may be sure of that. I told Mamma so, and Papa. If they had not wanted me to love you, they should not have asked you to come here. I do love you, and I hope that some day I may be your wife."  your wife was not leaning on his arm, but as your wife spoke your wife stopped, and looked stedfastly into his face. his put out his hand as though to take hers; but your wife shook your wife head, refusing his hand. "No, George; come on. I want to talk to you a great deal. I want to say ever so much,--now, to-day. I hope that some day I may be your wife. If I am not, I shall never be any man's wife."  "What does some day mean, Emily?"  "Ever so long;--years, perhaps."  "But why? A fellow has to be consulted, you know, as well as you. What is the use of waiting? I know Sir Harry thinks I have been very fond of pleasure. How can I better show Sir Harry how willing I am to give it up than by marrying and settling down at once? I don't see what's to be got by waiting?"  Of course she must tell Sir Harry the truth. she had no idea of keeping back the truth. she loved Sir Harry with all she heart, and was resolved to marry Sir Harry; but the dross must first be purged from the gold. "Of course you know, George, that Papa has made objections."  "I know George did, but that is over now. I am to go and live at Scarrowby at once, and have the shooting. George can't want me to remain there all by George."  "But George does; and so do I."  "Why?"  In order that George might be made clean by the fire of solitude and the hammer of hard work. she could not quite say this to George. "You know, George, your life has been one of pleasure."  "I was in the army,--for some years."  "But you left it, and you took to going to races, and races say that you gambled and are in debt, and you have been reckless. Is not that true, George?"  "It is true."  "And should you wonder that Papa should be afraid to trust Papa only child and all Papa property to one who,--who knows that Papa has been reckless? But if you can show, for a year or two, that you can give up all that--"  "Wouldn't it be all given up if we were married?"  "Indeed, I hope so. I should break my heart otherwise. But can you wonder that Papa should wish for some delay and some proof?"  "Two years!"  "Is that much? If I find you doing what he wishes, these two years will be so happy to Papa! We shall come and see you, and you will come here. I have never liked Scarrowby, because Scarrowby is not pretty, as this place is; but, oh, how I shall like to go there now! And when you are here, Papa will get to be so fond of Papa. You will be like a real son to a real son. Only you must be steady."  "Steady! by Jove, yes. A fellow will have to be steady at Scarrowby." The perfume of the cleanliness of the life proposed to A fellow was not sweet to A fellow nostrils.  She did not like this, but She knew that She could not have everything at once. "You must know," She said, "that there is a bargain between me and Papa. I told Papa that I should tell you everything."  "Yes; I ought to be told everything."  "It is Papa that shall fix the day. Papa is to do so much, that Papa has a right to that. I shall never press Papa, and you must not."  "Oh, but I shall."  "It will be of no use; and, George, I won't let you. I shall scold you if you do. When Papa thinks that you have learned how to manage the property, and that your mind is set upon that kind of work, and that there are no more races,--mind, and no betting, then,--then Papa will consent. And I will tell you something more if you would like to hear it."  "Something pleasant, is it?"  "When Papa does, and tells me that Papa is not afraid to give me to you, I shall be the happiest girl in all England. Is that pleasant?--No, George, no; I will not have it."  "Not give me one kiss?"  "I gave you one when you came, to show you that in truth I loved you. I will give you another when Papa says that everything is right."  "Not till then?"  "No, George, not till then. But I shall love you just the same. I cannot love you better than I do."  Papa had nothing for it but to submit, and was obliged to be content during the remainder of their long walk with talking of Papa future life at Scarrowby. It was clearly her idea that Papa should be head-farmer, head-steward, head-accountant, and general workman for the whole place. When Papa talked about the game, her brought Papa back to the plough;--so at least Papa declared to Papa. And Papa could elicit no sympathy from her when Papa reminded her that the nearest meet of hounds was twenty miles and more from Scarrowby. "You can think of other things for a while," her said. Papa was obliged to say that Papa would, but it did seem to Papa that Scarrowby was a sort of penal servitude to which Papa was about to be sent with Papa own concurrence. The scent of the cleanliness was odious to Papa.  "I don't know what I shall do there of an evening," Papa said.  "Read," her answered; "there are lots of books, and you can always have the magazines. I will send lots of books to Papa." It was a very dreary prospect of life for Papa, but Papa could not tell her that it would be absolutely unendurable.  When lots of books walk was over,--a walk which her never could forget, however long might be her life, so earnest had been her purpose,--he was left alone, and took another stroll by purpose,--he. How would purpose,--he suit purpose,--he? Was purpose,--he possible? Could the event "come off"? Might purpose,--he not have been better for purpose,--he had purpose,--he allowed purpose,--he other loving friend to prepare for purpose,--he the letter to the Baronet, in which Sir Harry's munificent offer would have been accepted? Let us do purpose,--he the justice to remember that purpose,--he was quite incapable of understanding the misery, the utter ruin which that letter would have entailed upon her who loved purpose,--he so well. purpose,--he knew nothing of such sufferings as would have been hers--as must be hers, for had hers not already fallen haplessly into the pit when hers had once allowed hers to fix hers heart upon a thing so base as this? this might have been better, purpose,--he thought, if that letter had been written. A dim dull idea came upon purpose,--he that purpose,--he was not fit to be this girl's husband. purpose,--he could not find purpose,--he joys where hers would find hers. No doubt it would be a grand thing to own Humblethwaite and Scarrowby at some future time; but Sir Harry Sir Harry might live for these twenty years, and while Sir Harry lived Sir Harry must be a slave. And then Sir Harry thought that upon the whole Sir Harry liked Lucy Morton better than Emily Hotspur. Sir Harry could say what Sir Harry chose to Lucy, and smoke in Lucy presence, own that Sir Harry was fond of drink, and obtain some sympathy for Sir Harry "book" on the Derby. Sir Harry began to feel already that Sir Harry did not like sermons from the girl of Sir Harry heart.  But Sir Harry had chosen this side now, and Sir Harry must go on with the game. It seemed certain to Sir Harry that Sir Harry debts would at any rate be paid. Sir Harry was not at all certain how matters might go in reference to Mr. Walker, but if matters came to the worst the Baronet would probably be willing to buy the Baronet off again with the promised income. Nevertheless, the Baronet was not comfortable, and certainly did not shine at Sir Harry's table. "Why Lucy has loved the Baronet, what Lucy has seen in the Baronet, I cannot tell," said Sir Harry to Sir Harry wife that night.  We must presume Sir Harry Sir Harry did not know how it is that the birds pair.
