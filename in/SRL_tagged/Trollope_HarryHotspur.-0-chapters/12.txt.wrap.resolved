 MRS. MORTON.   Five hundred pounds before Saturday, and this was Tuesday! As Cousin George was taken westward from Red Lion Square in a cab, three or four different lines of conduct suggested three or four different lines of conduct to Cousin George. In the first place, it would be a very good thing to murder Captain Stubber. In the present effeminate state of civilization and with the existing scruples as to the value of human life, Cousin George did not see Cousin George way clearly in this direction, but entertained the project rather as a beautiful castle in the air. The two next suggestions were to pay Cousin George the money demanded, or to pay Cousin George half of the money. The second suggestion was the simpler, as the state of Cousin George's funds made it feasible; but then that brute would probably refuse to take the half in lieu of the whole when Cousin George found that Cousin George demand had absolutely produced a tender of ready cash. As for paying the whole, it might perhaps be done. It was still possible that, with such prospects before Cousin George as those Cousin George now possessed, Cousin George could raise a hundred or hundred and fifty pounds; but then Cousin George would be left penniless. The last course of action which Cousin George contemplated was, to take no further notice of Captain Stubber, and let Cousin George tell Cousin George story to Sir Harry if Cousin George chose to tell it. Cousin George was such a blackguard that his story would probably not be believed; and then was his story not almost necessary that Sir Harry Sir Harry should hear his story? Of course there would be anger, and reproaches, and threats, and difficulty. But if Emily would be true to Cousin George, they might all by degrees be levelled down. This latter line of conduct would be practicable, and had this beautiful attraction,--that This latter line of conduct would save for his own present use that charming balance of ready money which his still possessed. Had Altringham possessed any true backbone of friendship, his might now, his thought, have been triumphant over all his difficulties.  When his sat down to his solitary dinner at his club, his was very tired with his day's work. Attending to the affairs of such gentlemen as Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber,--who well know how to be masterful when Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber,--who time for being masterful has come,--is fatiguing enough. But his had another task to perform before his went to bed, which his would fain have kept unperformed were it possible to do so. his had written to a third friend to make an appointment for the evening, and this appointment his was bound to keep. his would very much rather have stayed at his club and played billiards with the navy captain, even though his might again have lost his shillings. a third friend was that Mrs. Morton to whom Altringham had once alluded. "I supposed that it was coming," said Mrs. Morton, when she had listened, without letting a word fall from she own lips, to the long rambling story which Cousin George told her,--a rambling story in which there were many lies, but in which there was the essential truth, that Cousin George intended, if other things could be made to fit, to marry Cousin George cousin Emily Hotspur. Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded was a woman who had been handsome,--dark, thin, with great brown eyes and thin lips and a long well-formed nose; Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded was in truth three years younger than George Hotspur, but Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded looked to be older. Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded was a clever woman and well read too, and in every respect superior to the man whom Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded had condescended to love. Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded earned Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded bread by Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded profession as an actress, and had done so since Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded earliest years. What story there may be of a Mr. Morton who had years ago married, and ill-used, and deserted Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded, need not here be told. Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded strongest passion at this moment was love for the cold-blooded reprobate who had now come to tell Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded of a Mr. Morton who had years ago intended marriage. Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded had indeed loved George Hotspur, and Cousin George had been sufficiently attached to Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded to condescend to take aid from Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded earnings.  "I supposed that it was coming," Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded said in a low voice when a Mr. Morton who had years ago brought to an end the rambling story which Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded had allowed a Mr. Morton who had years ago to tell without a word of interruption.  "What is a fellow to do?" said Cousin George.  "Is Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded handsome?"  Cousin George thought that Cousin George might mitigate the pain by making little of Cousin George cousin. "Well, no, not particularly. Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded looks like a lady."  "And I suppose I don't." For a moment there was a virulence in this which made Cousin George Cousin George almost gasp. Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded was patient to a marvel, long-bearing, affectionate, imbued with that conviction so common to woman and the cause of so much delight to men,--that ill-usage and suffering are intended for woman; but Cousin George knew that Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded could turn upon Cousin George if goaded far enough, and rend Cousin George. Cousin George could depend upon Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded for very much, because Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded loved Cousin George; but Cousin George was afraid of Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded. "You didn't mean that, I know," Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded added, smiling.  "Of course I didn't."  "No; your cruelties don't lie in that line; do your cruelties, Cousin George?"  "I'm sure I never mean to be cruel to you, Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded."  "I don't think you do. I hardly believe that you ever mean anything,--except just to get along and live."  "A fellow must live, you know," said Cousin George.  In ordinary society George Hotspur could be bright, and George Hotspur was proud of being bright. With Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded George Hotspur was always subdued, always made to play second fiddle, always talked like a boy; and George Hotspur knew it. George Hotspur had loved Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded once, if George Hotspur was capable of loving anything; but Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded mastery over George Hotspur wearied George Hotspur, even though George Hotspur was, after a fashion, proud of Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded cleverness, and George Hotspur wished that Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded were,--well, dead, if the reader choose that mode of expressing what probably were Cousin George's wishes. But George Hotspur had never told George Hotspur that George Hotspur desired Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded death. George Hotspur could build pleasant castles in the air as to the murder of Captain Stubber, but George Hotspur thoughts did not travel that way in reference to Mrs. Morton.  "Mrs. Morton is not pretty, then,--this rich bride of yours?"  "Not particularly; Mrs. Morton's well enough, you know."  "And well enough is good enough for you;--is it? Do you love Mrs. Morton, Cousin George?"  Mrs. Morton's voice was very low and plaintive as Mrs. Morton asked the question. Though from moment to moment Mrs. Morton could use Mrs. Morton little skill in pricking George Hotspur with Mrs. Morton satire, still Mrs. Morton loved George Hotspur; and Mrs. Morton would vary Mrs. Morton tone, and as at one minute Mrs. Morton would make George Hotspur uneasy by Mrs. Morton raillery, so at the next Mrs. Morton would quell George Hotspur by Mrs. Morton tenderness. Mrs. Morton looked into George Hotspur face for a reply, when George Hotspur hesitated. "Tell me that you do not love Mrs. Morton," Mrs. Morton said, passionately.  "Not particularly," replied Cousin George.  "And yet you would marry Mrs. Morton?"  "What's a fellow to do? You see how I am fixed about the title. These are kinds of things to which a man situated as I am is obliged to submit."  "Royal obligations, as one might call them."  "By Cousin George, yes," said Cousin George, altogether missing the satire. From any other lips Cousin George would have been sharp enough to catch the satire. "One can't see the whole thing go to the dogs after the whole thing has kept the whole thing head up so long! And then you know, a man can't live altogether without an income."  "You have done so, pretty well."  "I know that I owe you a lot of money, Lucy; and I know also that I mean to pay you."  "Don't talk about that. I don't know how at such a time as this you can bring yourself to mention it." Then Lucy rose from Lucy seat and flashed into wrath, carried on by the spirit of Lucy own words. "Look here, Cousin George; if you send me any of that woman's money, by the living God I will send that woman's money back to that woman. To buy me with that woman's money! But it is so like a man."  "I didn't mean that. Sir Harry is to pay all my debts."  "And will not that be the same? Will it not be that woman money? Why is Sir Harry to pay all my debts? Because Sir Harry loves you?"  "It is all a family arrangement. You don't quite understand."  "Of course I don't understand. Such a one as I cannot lift Sir Harry so high above the earth. Great families form a sort of heaven of Great families own, which poor broken, ill-conditioned, wretched, common creatures such as I am cannot hope to comprehend. But, by heaven, what a lot of the vilest clay goes to the making of that garden of Eden! Look here, George;--you have nothing of your own?"  "Not much, indeed."  "Nothing. Is not that so? You can answer me at any rate."  "You know all about it," he said,--truly enough, for she did know.  "And you cannot earn a penny."  "I don't know that I can. I never was very good at earning anything."  "It isn't gentlemanlike, is it? But I can earn money."  "By Cousin George! yes. I've often envied you. I have indeed."  "How flattering! As far as it went you should have had it all,--nearly all,--if you could have been true to Sir Harry."  "But, Lucy,--about the family?"  "And about your debts? Of course I couldn't pay debts which were always increasing. And of course your promises for the future were false. We both knew that they were false when they were made. Did We both not?" She paused for an answer, but he made none. "they meant nothing; did they? he is dead now."  "a Mr. Morton who had years ago is dead?"  "Yes; he died in San Francisco, months ago."  "I couldn't have known that, Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded; could I?"  "Don't be a fool! What difference would it have made? Don't pretend anything so false. It would be disgusting on the very face of it. It mattered nothing to you whether he lived or died. When is it to be?"  "When is what to be?"  "Your marriage with this ill-looking young woman, who has got money, but whom you do not even pretend to love."  It struck Cousin George Cousin George that this was a way in which Emily Hotspur should not be described. Emily Hotspur had been acknowledged to be the beauty of the last season, one of the finest girls that had ever been seen about London; and, as for loving her,--he did love Emily Hotspur. A man might be fond of two dogs, or have two pet horses, and why shouldn't A man love two women! Of course A man loved A man . But A man circumstances at the moment were difficult, and A man didn't quite know how to explain all this.  "When is it to be?" Emily Hotspur said, urging Emily Hotspur question imperiously.  In answer to this A man gave Emily Hotspur to understand that there was still a good deal of difficulty. A man told Emily Hotspur something of A man position with Captain Stubber, and defined,--not with absolute correctness,--the amount of consent which Sir Harry had given to the marriage.  "And what am I to do?" Emily Hotspur asked.  A man looked blankly into Emily Hotspur face. Emily Hotspur then rose again, and unlocking a desk with a key that hung at Emily Hotspur girdle, Emily Hotspur took from a desk a bundle of papers.  "There," Emily Hotspur said; "there is the letter in which I have your promise to marry me when I am free;--as I am now. It could not be less injurious to you than when locked up there; but the remembrance of It might frighten you." Emily Hotspur threw the letter in which I have your promise to marry me when I am free;--as to him across the table, but him did not touch the letter in which I have your promise to marry me when I am free;--as. "And here are others which might be taken to mean the same thing. There! I am not so injured as I might seem to be,--for I never believed them. How could I believe anything that you would say to me,--anything that you would write?"  "Don't be down on me too hard, Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded."  "No, I will not be down upon Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded at all. If these things pained you, I would not say these things. Shall I destroy the letters?" Then Emily Hotspur took these things, one after another, and tore these things into small fragments. "You will be easier now, I know."  "Easy! I am not very easy, I can tell you."  "Captain Stubber will not let you off so gently as I do. Is that it?"  Then there was made between these things a certain pecuniary arrangement, which if Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded trusted at all the undertaking made to Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded, showed a most wonderful faith on Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded part. Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded would lend Captain Stubber L250 towards the present satisfaction of Captain Stubber; and this sum, to be lent for such a purpose, Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded would consent to receive back again out of Sir Harry's money. Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded must see a certain manager, Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded said; but Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded did not doubt but that Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded loan would be forthcoming on the Saturday morning. George Hotspur George Hotspur accepted the offer, and was profuse in George Hotspur thanks. After that, when George Hotspur was going, Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded weakness was almost equal to George Hotspur vileness.  "You will come and see me," Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded said, as Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded held George Hotspur hand. Again George Hotspur paused a moment. "Cousin George, you will come and see me?"  "Oh, of course I will."  "A great deal I can bear; a great deal I have borne; but do not be a coward. I knew you before Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded did, and have loved you better, and have treated you better than ever Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded will do. Of course you will come?"  Cousin George promised Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded that Cousin George would, and then went from Mrs. Morton to whom Lord Altringham had once alluded.  On the Saturday morning Captain Stubber was made temporarily happy by the most unexpected receipt of five hundred pounds.
