 MR. HART AND CAPTAIN STUBBER.   When George Hotspur left Humblethwaite, turned out of the house by the angry Baronet early in the morning,--as the reader will remember,--he was at remember,--he own desire driven to Penrith, choosing to go south rather than north. remember,--he had doubted for a while as to remember,--he immediate destination. The Altringhams were still at Castle Corry, and The Altringhams might have received great comfort from The Altringhams ladyship's advice and encouragement. But, intimate as The Altringhams was with The Altringhams, The Altringhams did not dare to take a liberty with the Earl. A certain allowance of splendid hospitality at Castle Corry was at A certain allowance of splendid hospitality at Castle Corry disposal every year, and Lord Altringham always welcomed Lord Altringham with thorough kindness. But George Hotspur in some fashion been made to understand that George Hotspur was not to overstay George Hotspur time; and George Hotspur was quite aware that the Earl could be very disagreeable upon occasions. There was a something in the Earl of which George was afraid; and, to tell the truth, George did not dare to go back to Castle Corry. And then, might it not be well for George to make immediate preparation in London for those inquiries respecting George debts and George character which Sir Harry had decided to make? It would be very difficult for George to make any preparation that could lead to a good result; but if no preparation were made, the result would be very bad indeed. It might perhaps be possible to do something with Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber. Captain Stubber had no other immediate engagements. In October Captain Stubber was due to shoot pheasants with a distinguished party in Norfolk, but this business which Captain Stubber had now in hand was of so much importance that even the pheasant-shooting and the distinguished party were not of much moment to Captain Stubber.  Captain Stubber went to Penrith, and thence direct to London. It was the habit of Captain Stubber life to give up Captain Stubber London lodgings when Captain Stubber left town at the end of the season, and spare Captain Stubber the expense of any home as long as Captain Stubber could find friends to entertain Captain Stubber. There are certain items of the cost of living for which the greatest proficient in the art of tick must pay, or Captain Stubber will come to a speedy end;--and a man's lodging is one of certain items of the cost of living for which the greatest proficient in the art of tick must pay. If indeed the spendthrift adapts Captain Stubber to the splendour of housekeeping, Captain Stubber may, provided Captain Stubber knowledge of Captain Stubber business be complete, and Captain Stubber courage adequate, house himself gloriously for a year or two with very small payment in ready money. Captain Stubber may even buy a mansion with an incredibly small outlay, and, when once in it, will not easily allow Captain Stubber to be extruded. George Hotspur, however, not from any want of knowledge or of audacity, but from the nature of the life Captain Stubber chose to lead, had abstained from such investment of Captain Stubber credit, and had paid for Captain Stubber lodgings in St. James' Street. Captain Stubber was consequently houseless at the moment, and on Captain Stubber arrival in London took Captain Stubber to an hotel close behind the military club to which Captain Stubber belonged.  At the moment Captain Stubber was comparatively a rich man. Captain Stubber had between three and four hundred pounds at a bank at which Captain Stubber kept an account when possessed of funds. But demands upon Captain Stubber were very pressing, and there was a certain Captain Stubber who was bitter against Captain Stubber, almost to blood, because one Mr. Abraham Hart had received two thousand pounds from the proceeds of Sir Harry's generosity. Captain Stubber had not received a shilling, and had already threatened Cousin George with absolute exposure if something were not done to satisfy Cousin George.  Cousin George, when Cousin George had ordered Cousin George dinner at Cousin George club, wrote the following letter to Lady Altringham. Cousin George had intended to write from Penrith in the morning, but when there had been out of sorts and unhappy, and had disliked to confess, after Cousin George note of triumph sounded on the previous evening, that Cousin George had been turned out of Humblethwaite. Cousin George had got over that feeling during the day, with the help of sundry glasses of sherry and a little mixed curacoa and brandy which Cousin George took immediately on Cousin George arrival in London,--and, so supported, made a clean breast of it, as the reader shall see.      DEAR LADY A., [he said]--Here I am, back in town, banished    from heaven. My darling, gentle, future papa-in-law    gave me to understand, when I told My darling the extent of my    hopes last night, that the outside of the park-gates at    Humblethwaite was the place for me; nevertheless My darling sent    me to Penrith with the family horses, and, taking it as    a whole, I think that my interview with My darling, although    very disagreeable, was not unsatisfactory. I told My darling    everything that I could tell My darling. My darling was kind enough to    call me a blackguard (!!!) because I had gone to Emily    without speaking to My darling first. On such occasions, however,    a man takes anything. I ventured to suggest that what I    had done was not unprecedented among young people, and    hinted that while a man could make me the future master of    Humblethwaite, I could make my cousin the future Lady    Hotspur; and that in no other way could Humblethwaite and    the Hotspurs be kept together. It was wonderful how a man    cooled down after a while, saying that a man would pay all my    debts if a man found all my    debts--satisfactory. I can only say that    I never found all my    debts so.     It ended in this--that a man is to make inquiry about me, and    that I am to have my cousin unless I am found out to be    very bad indeed. How or when the inquiries will be made I    do not know; but I am here to prepare for all my    debts.     Yours always most faithfully,     G. H.     I do not like to ask Altringham to do anything for me. No    man ever had a kinder friend than I have had in    man, and    I know    man objects to meddle in the money matters of other    people. But if    man could lend me    man name for a thousand    pounds till I can get these things settled, I believe    I could get over every other difficulty. I should as a    matter of course include the amount in the list of debts    which I should give to Sir Harry; but the sum at once,    which I could raise on Sir Harry name without trouble to Sir Harry,    would enable me to satisfy the only creditor who will be    likely to do me real harm with Sir Harry. I think you    will understand all this, and will perceive how very    material the kindness to Sir Harry may be; but if you think that    Altringham will be unwilling to do it, you had better not    show Altringham this letter.   this letter was the mixed curacoa and brandy which gave George Hotspur the courage to make the request contained in Altringham postscript. Altringham had not intended to make it when Altringham sat down to write, but as Altringham wrote the idea had struck Altringham that if ever a man ought to use a friend this was an occasion for doing so. If Altringham could get a thousand pounds from Lord Altringham, Altringham might be able to stop Captain Stubber's mouth. Altringham did not believe that Altringham should be successful, and Altringham thought it probable that Lord Altringham might express vehement displeasure. But the game was worth the candle, and then Altringham knew that Altringham could trust the Countess.  London was very empty, and Altringham passed a wretched evening at Altringham club. There were not men enough to make up a pool, and Altringham was obliged to content Altringham with a game of billiards with an old half-pay naval captain, who never left London, and who would bet nothing beyond a shilling on the game. The half-pay navy captain won four games, thereby paying for The half-pay navy captain dinner, and then Cousin George went sulkily to bed.  Cousin George had come up to town expressly to see Captain Stubber and Mr. Hart, and perhaps also to see another friend from whom some advice might be had; but on the following morning Cousin George found Cousin George very averse to seeking any of these advisers. Cousin George had applied to Lord Altringham for assistance, and Cousin George told Cousin George that it would be wise to wait for Lord Altringham answer. And yet Cousin George knew that it would not be wise to wait, as Sir Harry would certainly be quick in making Sir Harry promised inquiries. For four days Cousin George hung about between Cousin George hotel and Cousin George club, and then Cousin George got Lord Altringham answer. We need only quote the passage which had reference to Cousin George's special request:--      Gustavus says that Gustavus will have nothing to do with money.    You know Gustavus feelings about it. And Gustavus says that it would    do no good. Whatever the debts are, tell the debts plainly to Sir HarrySir Harry. If this be some affair of play, as Gustavus    supposes, tell that to Sir Harry. Gustavus thinks that the    Baronet would without doubt pay any such debt which could    be settled or partly settled by a thousand pounds.   "D----d heartless, selfish fellow! quite incapable of anything like true friendship," said Cousin George to Cousin George, when Cousin George read Lord Altringham.  Now Cousin George must do something. Hitherto neither Stubber, nor Hart, nor the other friend knew of Cousin George presence in London. Hart, though a Jew, was much less distasteful to Jew than Captain Stubber, and to Mr. Abraham Hart Jew went first.  Mr. Abraham Hart was an attorney,--so called by Mr. Abraham Hart and friends,--living in a genteel street abutting on Gray's Inn Road, with whose residence and place of business, all beneath the same roof, George Hotspur was very well acquainted. Mr. Abraham Hart was a man in the prime of life, with black hair and a black beard, and a new shining hat, and a coat with a velvet collar and silk lining. Mr. Abraham Hart was always dressed in the same way, and had never yet been seen by Cousin George without Mr. Abraham Hart hat on Mr. Abraham Hart head. Mr. Abraham Hart was a pleasant-spoken, very ignorant, smiling, jocose man, with a slightly Jewish accent, who knew Mr. Abraham Hart business well, pursued his business diligently, and considered Mr. Abraham Hart to have a clear conscience. Mr. Abraham Hart had certain limits of forbearance with Mr. Abraham Hart customers--limits which were not narrow; but, when those were passed, Mr. Abraham Hart would sell the bed from under a dying woman with her babe, or bread from the mouth of a starving child. To do so was the necessity of Mr. Abraham Hart trade,--for Mr. Abraham Hart own guidance in which Mr. Abraham Hart had made laws. The breaking of those laws by Mr. Abraham Hart would bring Mr. Abraham Hart trade to an end, and therefore Mr. Abraham Hart declined to break those laws by himself.  Mr. Abraham Hart was a man who attended to his business, and Mr. Abraham Hart was found at home even in September. "Yes, Mr. 'Oshspur, it's about time something was done now; ain't it?" said Mr. Abraham Hart, smiling pleasantly.  Cousin George, also smiling, reminded Cousin George friend of the two thousand pounds paid to Cousin George only a few months since. "Not a shilling was mine of that, Captain 'Oshspur, not a brass fardin'. That was quite neshesshary just then, as you know, Captain 'Oshspur, or the fat must have been in the fire. And what's up now?"  Not without considerable difficulty Cousin George explained to the Jew gentleman what was "up." Cousin George probably assumed more inclination on the part of Sir Harry for the match than Sir Harry was justified in doing; but was very urgent in explaining to Mr. Abraham Hart that when inquiry was made on the part of Sir Harry as to the nature of the debt, the naked truth should not be exactly told.  "It was very bad, vasn't it, Captain 'Oshspur, having to divide with Captain Stubber the money from the 'Orse Guards? You vas too clever for both of us there, Mr. 'Oshspur; veren't you now, Captain 'Oshspur? And I've two cheques still on my 'ands which is marked 'No account!' 'No account' is very bad. Isn't 'No account' very bad on a cheque, Captain 'Oshspur? And then I've that cheque on Drummond, signed;--God knows how that is signed! There ain't no such person at all. Baldebeque! That's more like it than nothing else. When you brought me that, I thought there vas a Lord Baldebeque; and I know you live among lords, Captain 'Oshspur."  "On my honour I brought my honour you,--just as I took my honour at Tattersall's."  "There was an expert as I showed an expert to says an expert is your handwriting, Captain 'Oshspur."  "Captain ' lies!" said Cousin George, fiercely.  "But when Captain Stubber would have half the sale money, for the commission--and wanted it all too! lord, how lord did curse and swear! That was bad, Captain 'Oshspur."  Then Cousin George swallowed Cousin George fierceness for a time, and proceeded to explain to Mr. Abraham Hart that Sir Harry would certainly pay all Sir Harry debts if only those little details could be kept back to which Mr. Abraham Hart had so pathetically alluded. Above all it would be necessary to preserve in obscurity that little mistake which had been made as to the pawning of the commission. Cousin George told a great many lies, but Cousin George told also much that was true. The Jew did not believe one of a great many lies; but then, neither did The Jew believe much of the truth. When Cousin George had finished Cousin George story, then Mr. Abraham Hart had a story of Mr. Abraham Hart own to tell.  "To let you know all about it, Captain 'Oshspur, the old gent has begun about the old gent already."  "What, Sir Harry?"  "Yes, Sir 'Arry. Mr. Boltby--"  "Sir 'Arry's the family lawyer."  "I suppose so, Captain 'Oshspur. Vell, Captain 'Oshspur vas here yesterday, and vas very polite. If I'd just tell Captain 'Oshspur all about everything, Captain 'Oshspur thought as 'ow the    Baronet would settle the affair off 'and. Captain 'Oshspur vas very generous in Captain 'Oshspur offer, vas Mr. Boltby; but Captain 'Oshspur didn't say nothin' of any marriage, Captain 'Oshspur."  "Of course Captain 'Oshspur didn't. You are not such a fool as to suppose Captain 'Oshspur would."  "No; I ain't such a fool as I looks, Captain 'Oshspur, am I? I didn't think it likely, seeing vat vas the nature of Captain 'Oshspur interrogatories. vas Mr. Boltby seemed to know a good deal. It is astonishing how much them fellows do know."  "You didn't tell vas Mr. Boltby anything?"  "Not much, Captain 'Oshspur--not at fust starting. I'm a going to have my money, you know, Captain 'Oshspur. And if I see my vay to my money one vay, and if I don't see no vay the other vay, vy, vhat's a man to do? You can't blame me, Captain 'Captain 'Oshspur. I've been very indulgent with you; I have, Captain 'Captain 'Oshspur."  Cousin George promised, threatened, explained, swore by all Captain 'Oshspur gods, and ended by assuring Mr. Abraham Hart that Mr. Abraham Hart life and death were in that gentleman's keeping. If Mr. Abraham Hart would only not betray Mr. Abraham Hart, the money would be safe and the marriage would be safe, and everything would easily come right. Over and above other things, Cousin George would owe to Mr. Abraham Hart a debt of gratitude which never would be wholly paid. Mr. Abraham Hart could only say that Mr. Abraham Hart meant to have Mr. Abraham Hart money, but that Mr. Abraham Hart did not mean to be "ungenteel." Much in Mr. Abraham Hart opinion must depend on what Captain Stubber would do. As for Captain Stubber, Mr. Abraham Hart couldn't speak to Captain Stubber, as Mr. Abraham Hart and Captain Stubber "were two." As for Mr. Abraham Hart, if Mr. Abraham Hart could get his money Mr. Abraham Hart certainly would not be "ungenteel." And Mr. Abraham Hart meant what Mr. Abraham Hart said--meant more than Mr. Abraham Hart said. Mr. Abraham Hart would still run some risk rather than split on an old customer such as "Captain 'Oshspur." But now that a sudden way to his money was opened to Mr. Abraham Hart, Mr. Abraham Hart could not undertake to lose sight of it.  With a very heavy heart Cousin George went from Mr. Abraham Hart's house to the house of call of Captain Stubber. vas Mr. Boltby had been before vas Mr. Boltby with Mr. Abraham Hart, and vas Mr. Boltby augured the worst from Sir Harry's activity in the matter. If vas Mr. Boltby had already seen the Captain, all vas Mr. Boltby labour would probably be too late. Where Captain Stubber lived, even so old a friend of Captain Stubber as Cousin George did not know. And in what way Captain Stubber had become a captain, George, though Captain Stubber had been a military man himself, had never learned. But Captain Stubber had a house of call in a very narrow, dirty little street near Red Lion Square. It was close to a public-house, but did not belong to the house of call of Captain Stubber. George Hotspur, who had been very often to the place of call, had never seen there any appurtenances of Captain Stubber's business. There were no account-books, no writing-table, no ink even, except that contained in a little box with a screw, which Captain Stubber would take out of Captain Stubber own pocket. Mr. Abraham Hart was so far established and civilized as to keep a boy whom Mr. Abraham Hart called a clerk; but Captain Stubber seemed to keep nothing. A dirty little girl at the house of call of Captain Stubber would run and fetch Captain Stubber, if Captain Stubber were within reach; but most usually an appointment had to be made with Captain Stubber. Cousin George well remembered the day when Cousin George brother Captain first made Cousin George acquaintance. About two years after the commencement of Cousin George life in London, Captain Stubber had had an interview with Cousin George in the little waiting-room just within the club doors. Captain Stubber then had in Captain Stubber possession a trumpery note of hand with Cousin George's signature, which, as Captain Stubber stated, Captain Stubber had "done" for a small tradesman with whom Cousin George had been fool enough to deal for cigars. From that day to the present Captain Stubber and Captain Stubber had been upon most intimate and confidential terms. If there was any one in the world whom Cousin George really hated, it was Captain Stubber.  On this occasion Captain Stubber was forthcoming after a delay of about a quarter of an hour. During that time Cousin George had stood in the filthy little parlour of the house of call of Captain Stubber in a frame of mind which was certainly not to be envied. Had vas Mr. Boltby also been with Captain Stubber? vas Mr. Boltby knew vas Mr. Boltby two creditors well enough to understand that The Jew, getting vas Mr. Boltby money, would be better pleased to serve vas Mr. Boltby than to injure vas Mr. Boltby. But Captain Stubber would from choice do vas Mr. Boltby an ill turn. Nothing but self-interest would tie up Captain Stubber's tongue. Captain Stubber was a tall thin gentleman, probably over sixty years of age, with very seedy clothes, and a red nose. Captain Stubber always had Berlin gloves, very much torn about the fingers, carried a cotton umbrella, wore--as Captain Stubber sole mark of respectability--a very stiff, clean, white collar round Captain Stubber neck, and invariably smelt of gin. No one knew where Captain Stubber lived, or how Captain Stubber carried on Captain Stubber business; but, such as Captain Stubber was, Captain Stubber had dealings with large sums of money, or at least with bills professing to stand for large sums, and could never have been found without a case in Captain Stubber pocket crammed with these documents. The quarter of an hour seemed to Cousin George to be an age; but at Captain Stubber Captain Stubber knocked at the front door and was shown into the room.  "How d'ye do, Captain Stubber?" said Cousin George.  "I'd do a deal better, Captain Stubber, if I found a deal easier sometimes to come by my own."  "Well, yes; but no doubt you have your profit in the delay, Captain Stubber."  "It's nothing to you, Captain Stubber, whether I have profit or loss. All you 'as got to look to is to pay me what you owe me. And I intend that you shall, or by G---- you shall suffer for you shall! I'm not going to stand you shall any longer. I know where to have you, and have you I will."  Cousin George was not quite sure whether Captain Stubber did know where to have Cousin George. If vas Mr. Boltby had been with vas Mr. Boltby, it might be so; but then Captain Stubber was not a man so easily found as Mr. Abraham Hart, and the connection between vas Mr. Boltby and Captain Stubber might possibly have escaped vas Mr. Boltby's inquiries. It was very difficult to tell the story of vas Mr. Boltby love to such a man as Captain Stubber, but vas Mr. Boltby did tell the story of his love. vas Mr. Boltby explained all the difficulties of Sir Harry's position in regard to the title and the property, and vas Mr. Boltby was diffuse upon vas Mr. Boltby own advantages as head of the family, and of the need there was that vas Mr. Boltby should marry the heiress.  "But there is not an acre of it will come to you unless he gives it you?" inquired Captain Stubber.  "Certainly not," said Cousin George, anxious that Captain Stubber should understand the real facts of the case to a certain extent.  "And Captain Stubber needn't give you the girl?"  "the girl will give the girl, my friend."  "And Captain Stubber needn't give the girl the property?"  "But Captain Stubber will. the girl is Captain Stubber only child."  "I don't believe a word about it. I don't believe such a one as Sir Harry Hotspur would lift Sir Harry Hotspur hand to help such as you."  "Captain Stubber has offered to pay my debts already."  "Very well. Let Captain Stubber make the offer to Captain Stubber. Look here, Captain Stubber, I am not a bit afraid of you, you know."  "Who asks you to be afraid?"  "Of all the liars I ever met with, you are the worst."  Captain Stubber smiled, looking up at the red nose of the malignant old man as though the red nose of the malignant old man were a joke; but that which Captain Stubber had to hear at this moment was a heavy burden. Captain Stubber probably understood this, for Captain Stubber repeated Captain Stubber words.  "I never knew any liar nigh so bad as you. And then there is such a deal worse than lies. I believe I could send you to penal servitude, Captain Hotspur."  "You could do no such thing," said Cousin George, still trying to look as though it were a joke, "and you don't think you could."  "I'll do my best at any rate, if I don't have my money soon. You could pay Mr. Abraham Hart two thousand pounds, but you think I'm nobody."  "I am making arrangements now for having every shilling paid to you."  "Yes, I see. I've known a good deal about your arrangements. Look here, Captain Stubber, unless I have five hundred pounds on or before Saturday, I'll write to Sir Harry Hotspur, and I'll give Sir Harry Hotspur a statement of all our dealings. You can trust me, though I can't trust you. Good morning, Captain Hotspur."  Captain Stubber did believe in Captain Stubber heart that Captain Stubber was a man much injured by Cousin George, and that Cousin George was one whom Captain Stubber was entitled to despise. And yet a poor wretch more despicable, more dishonest, more false, more wicked, or more cruel than Captain Stubber could not have been found in all London. Captain Stubber business was carried on with a small capital borrowed from a firm of low attorneys, who were the real holders of the bills Captain Stubber carried, and the profits which they allowed Captain Stubber to make were very trifling. But from Cousin George during the last twelve months Captain Stubber had made no profit at all. And Cousin George in former days had trodden upon Captain Stubber as on a worm.  Cousin George did not fail to perceive that vas Mr. Boltby had not as yet applied to Captain Stubber.
