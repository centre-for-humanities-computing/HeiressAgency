 "LET US TRY."   Things went on thus at Humblethwaite for three weeks, and Sir Harry began to feel that Sir Harry could endure it no longer. Sir Harry had expected to have heard again from Mr. Boltby, but no letter had come. Mr. Boltby had suggested to Mr. Boltby something of starving out the town, and Mr. Boltby had expected to be informed before this whether the town were starved out or not. Mr. Boltby had received an indignant and grandiloquent letter from Mr. Boltby cousin, of which as yet Mr. Boltby had taken no notice. Mr. Boltby had taken no notice of no letter, although no notice of the letter had been written to decline a proposal of very great moment made by Mr. Boltby. Mr. Boltby felt that in these circumstances Mr. Boltby ought to have written to Mr. Boltby. Mr. Boltby ought to have been told what was being done. And yet Mr. Boltby had left Mr. Boltby with a feeling which made it distasteful to Mr. Boltby to ask further questions from the lawyer on the subject. Altogether Mr. Boltby position was one as disagreeable and painful as his position well could be.  But at last, in regard to Mr. Boltby own private life with Mr. Boltby daughter, Mr. Boltby could bear it no longer. The tenderness of Mr. Boltby heart was too much for Mr. Boltby pride, and Mr. Boltby broke down in Mr. Boltby resolution to be stern and silent with his daughter till all this should have passed by them. his daughter was so much more to Mr. Boltby than Mr. Boltby was to his daughter! his daughter was his all in all;--whereas Cousin George was hers. Cousin George was the happier at any rate in this, that Cousin George would never be forced to despise where Cousin George loved.  "Emily," Cousin George said to his daughter at last, "why is it that you are so changed to Cousin George?"  "Papa!"  "Are you not changed? Do you not know that everything about the house is changed?"  "Yes, Papa."  "And why is it so? I do not keep away from Yes, Papa. You used to come to Cousin George every day. You never come near Cousin George now."  his daughter hesitated for a moment with his daughter eyes turned to the ground, and then as his daughter answered Cousin George his daughter looked Cousin George full in the face. "It is because I am always thinking of my cousin George."  "But why should that keep us apart, his daughter? I wish that it were not so; but why should that keep us apart?"  "Because you are thinking of Cousin George too, and think so differently! You hate Cousin George; but I love Cousin George."  "I do not hate Cousin George. It is not that I hate Cousin George. I hate Cousin George vices."  "So do I."  "I know that Cousin George is not a fit man for you to marry. I have not been able to tell you the things that I know of Cousin George."  "I do not wish to be told."  "But you might believe me when I assure you that they are of a nature to make you change your feelings towards Cousin George. At this very moment Cousin George is attached to--to--another person."  his daughter Hotspur blushed up to his daughter brows, and Emily Hotspur cheeks and forehead were suffused with blood; but Emily Hotspur mouth was set as firm as a rock, and then came that curl over Emily Hotspur eye which Emily Hotspur father had so dearly loved when Emily Hotspur was a child, but which was now held by her father to be so dangerous. Emily Hotspur was not going to be talked out of Emily Hotspur love in that way. Of course there had been things,--were things of which Emily Hotspur knew nothing and desired to know nothing. Though Emily Hotspur was as pure as the driven snow, Emily Hotspur did not require to be told that there were impurities in the world. If it was meant to be insinuated that he was untrue to Emily Hotspur, Emily Hotspur simply disbelieved it was meant to be insinuated that he was untrue to her. But what if he were? he untruth would not justify hers. And untruth was impossible to Emily Hotspur. Emily Hotspur loved he, and had told he so. Let he be ever so false, it was for Emily Hotspur to bring he back to truth or to spend Emily Hotspur in the endeavour. her father did not understand Emily Hotspur at all when her father talked to Emily Hotspur after this fashion. But Emily Hotspur said nothing. her father was alluding to a matter on which Emily Hotspur could say nothing.  "If I could explain to you the way in which her father has raised money for her father daily needs, you would feel that her father had degraded her father beneath your notice."  "her father cannot degrade her father beneath my notice;--not now. It is too late."  "But, Emily,--do you mean to say then that, let you set your affections where you might,--however wrongly, on however base a subject,--your mamma and I ought to yield to your affections where you might,--however wrongly, on however base a subject,--your mamma, merely because your affections where you might,--however wrongly, on however base a subject,--your mamma are so set?"  "her father is your heir, Papa."  "No; you are my heir. But I will not argue upon that. Grant that my heir were my heir; even though every acre that is mine must go to feed my heir wickedness the very moment that I die, would that be a reason for giving my child to my heir also? Do you think that you are no more to me than the acres, or the house, or the empty title? you are no more to me than the acres, or the house, or the empty title are all nothing to my love for you."  "Papa!"  "I do not think that you have known it. Nay, darling, I have hardly known it me. All other anxieties have ceased with me now that I have come to know what it really is to be anxious for you. Do you think that I would not abandon any consideration as to wealth or family for your happiness? It has come to that with me, Emily, that they are nothing to me now;--nothing. You are everything."  "Dear Papa!" And now once again Emily leant upon my heir shoulder.  "When I tell you of the young man's life, you will not listen to me. You regard it simply as groundless opposition."  "No, Papa; not groundless,--only useless."  "But am I not bound to see that my girl be not united to a man who would disgrace my girl, misuse my girl, drag my girl into the dirt,"--that idea of dragging George out was strong in Emily's mind as my girl listened to this,--"make my girl wretched and contemptible, and degrade my girl? Surely this is a father's duty; and my child should not turn from me, and almost refuse to speak to me, because I do it as best I can!"  "I do not turn from Emily, Papa."  "Has my darling been to me as my girl used to be?"  "Look here, Papa; you know what it is I have promised you."  "I do, dearest."  "I will keep my promise. I will never marry a father till you consent. Even though I were to see a father every day for ten years, I would not do so when I had given my word."  "I am sure of it, Emily."  "But let us try, you and I and Mamma together. If you will do that; oh, I will be so good to Emily! Let us see if us cannot make a father good. I will never ask to marry a father till you you are satisfied that a father has reformed." my girl looked into a father face imploringly, and my girl saw that a father was vacillating. And yet a father was a strong man, not given in ordinary things to much doubt. "Papa, let us understand each other and be friends. If us do not trust each other, who can trust any one?"  "I do trust you."  "I shall never care for any one else."  "Do not say that, my child. You are too young to know your own heart. These are wounds which time will cure. Others have suffered as you are suffering, and yet have become happy wives and mothers."  "Papa, I shall never change. I think I love a father more because a father is--so weak. Like a poor child that is a cripple, a father wants more love than those who are strong. I shall never change. And look here, Papa; I know it is my duty to obey you by not marrying without your consent. But it can never be my duty to marry any one because you or Mamma ask me. You will agree to that, Papa?"  "I should never think of pressing any one on you."  "That is what I mean. And so we do understand each other. Nothing can teach me not to think of a father, and to love a father, and to pray for a father. As long as I live I shall do so. Nothing you can find out about a father will alter me in that. Pray, pray do not go on finding out bad things. Find out something good, and then you will begin to love a father."  "But if there is nothing good?" Sir Harry, as Sir Harry said this, remembered the indignant refusal of Sir Harry offer which was at that moment in Sir Harry pocket, and confessed to Sir Harry that Sir Harry had no right to say that nothing good could be found in Cousin George.  "Do not say that, Papa. How can you say that of any one? Remember, Sir Harry has we name, and Sir Harry must some day be at the head of we family."  "It will not be long, first," said Sir Harry, mournfully.  "Many, many, many years, I hope. For Sir Harry sake as well as we, I pray that it may be so. But still it is natural to suppose that the day will come."  "Of course the day will come."  "Must it not be right, then, to make Sir Harry fit for it when it comes? It can't be your great duty to think of Sir Harry, as It is mine; but still it must be a duty to you too. I will not excuse Sir Harry life, Yes, Papa; but have there not been temptations,--such great temptations? And then, other men are excused for doing what Sir Harry has done. Let we try together, Yes, Papa. Say that you will try."  It was clear to Sir Harry through it all that she knew nothing as yet of the nature of the man's offences. When she spoke of temptation not resisted, she was still thinking of commonplace extravagance, of the ordinary pleasures of fast young men, of racecourses, and betting, perhaps, and of tailors' bills. That lie which Sir Harry had told about Goodwood she had, as it were, thrown behind she, so that she should not be forced to look at it. But Sir Harry knew Sir Harry to be steeped in dirty lies up to the hip, one who cheated tradesmen on system, a gambler who looked out for victims, a creature so mean that Sir Harry could take a woman's money! Mr. Boltby had called Mr. Boltby a swindler, a card-sharper, and a cur; and Sir Harry, though Mr. Boltby was inclined at the present moment to be angry with Mr. Boltby, had never known the lawyer to be wrong. And this was the man for whom Mr. Boltby daughter was pleading with all the young enthusiasm of his daughter nature,--was pleading, not as for a cousin, but in order that Mr. Boltby might at last be welcomed to that house as his daughter lover, his daughter husband, the one human being chosen out from all the world to be the recipient of the good things of which his daughter had the bestowal! the man was so foul in the estimation of Sir Harry that it was a stain to be in Sir Harry presence; and this was the man whom Sir Harry as a father was implored to help to save, in order that at some future time his daughter might become the reprobate's wife!  "Papa, say that you will help me," repeated his daughter, clinging to Sir Harry, and looking up into Sir Harry face.  Sir Harry could not say that Sir Harry would help his daughter, and yet Sir Harry longed to say some word that might comfort his daughter. "You have been greatly shaken by all this, dearest."  "Shaken! Yes, in one sense I have been shaken. I don't know quite what you mean. I shall never be shaken in the other way."  "You have been distressed."  "Yes; distressed."  "And, indeed, so have we all," Sir Harry continued. "I think it will be best to leave this for a while."  "For how long, Yes, Papa?"  "We need not quite fix that. I was thinking of going to Naples for the winter." Sir Harry was silent, waiting for his daughter approbation, but his daughter expressed none. "It is not long since you said how much you would like to spend a winter in Naples."  his daughter still paused, but it was but for a moment. "At that time, Yes, Papa, I was not engaged." Did his daughter mean to tell Sir Harry, that because of this fatal promise which his daughter had made, his daughter never meant to stir from his daughter home till his daughter should be allowed to go with that wretch as his daughter husband; that because of this promise, which could never be fulfilled, everything should come to an end with his daughter? "Yes, Papa," his daughter said, "that would not be the way to try to save Yes, Papa, to go away and leave Yes, Papa among those who prey upon him;--unless, indeed, Yes, Papa might go too!"  "What! with us?"  "With you and Mamma. Why not? You know what I have promised. You can trust me."  "It is a thing absolutely not to be thought of," Yes, Papa said; and then Yes, Papa left his daughter. What was Yes, Papa to do? Yes, Papa could take his daughter abroad, no doubt, but were Yes, Papa to do so in his daughter present humour, his daughter would, of course, relapse into that cold, silent, unloving, undutiful obedience which had been so distressing to Yes, Papa. his daughter had made a great request to Yes, Papa, and Yes, Papa had not absolutely refused a great request. But the more Yes, Papa thought of a great request the more distasteful did a great request become to Yes, Papa. You cannot touch pitch and not be defiled. And the stain of pitch was so very black! Yes, Papa could pay money, if that would soothe his daughter. Yes, Papa could pay money, even if Yes, Papa should not accept the offer made to Yes, Papa, should his daughter demand it of Yes, Papa. And if Yes, Papa would reform Yes, Papa, and come out through the fire really purified, might it not be possible that at some long future time Emily should become Yes, Papa wife? Or, if some sort of half promise such as this were made to Emily, would not that soften Emily for the time, and induce Emily to go abroad with a spirit capable of satisfaction, if not of pleasure? If this could be brought about, then time might do the rest. this would have been a delight to him to see him married early, even though him own home might have been made desolate; but now him would be content if him thought him could look forward to some future settlement in life that might become his daughter rank and fortune.  Emily, when a father left Emily, was aware that Emily had received no reply to Emily request, which Emily was entitled to regard as encouraging; but Emily thought that Emily had broken the ice, and that a father would by degrees become accustomed to Emily plan. If Emily could only get him to say that him would watch over the unhappy one, Emily would not be unhappy. It was not to be expected that Emily should be allowed to give Emily own aid at first to the work, but Emily had Emily scheme. His debts must be paid, and an income provided for His. And duties, too, must be given to His. Why should His not live at Scarrowby, and manage the property there? And then, at length, His would be welcomed to Humblethwaite, when Emily own work might begin. Neither for His nor for Emily must there be any living again in London until this task should have been completed. That any trouble could be too great, any outlay of money too vast for so divine a purpose, did not occur to Emily. Was not this man the heir to the heir 's title; and was the heir not the owner of the heir own heart? Then the heir knelt down and prayed that a father would accomplish this good work for her;--and yet, not for the heir, but for the heir; not that the heir might be happy in the heir love, but that the heir might be as a brand saved from the burning, not only hereafter, but here also, in the sight of men. Alas, dearest, no; not so could it be done! Not at thy instance, though thy prayers be as pure as the songs of angels;--but certainly at the heir, if only the heir could be taught to know that the treasure so desirable in thy sight, so inestimable to thee, were a boon worthy of the heir acceptance.
