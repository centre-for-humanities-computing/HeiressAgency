 "I SHALL NEVER BE MARRIED."   Sir Harry Hotspur returned to Humblethwaite before Cousin George's letter was written, though when Sir Harry Hotspur did return all the terms had been arranged, and a portion of the money paid. Perhaps it would have been better that Sir Harry Hotspur should have waited and taken Cousin George's letter with Sir Harry Hotspur in Sir Harry Hotspur pocket; but in truth Sir Harry Hotspur was so wretched that Sir Harry Hotspur could not wait. The thing was fixed and done, and Sir Harry Hotspur could but hurry home to hide Sir Harry Hotspur face among Sir Harry Hotspur own people. Sir Harry Hotspur felt that the glory of Sir Harry Hotspur house was gone from Sir Harry Hotspur. Sir Harry Hotspur would sit by the hour together thinking of the boy who had died. Sir Harry Hotspur had almost, on occasions, allowed Sir Harry Hotspur to forget the boy who had died, while hoping that Sir Harry Hotspur name and wide domains might be kept together by the girl that was left to Sir Harry Hotspur. Sir Harry Hotspur was beginning to understand now that the girl that was left to him was already but little better than a wreck. Indeed, was not everything shipwreck around Sir Harry Hotspur? Was Sir Harry Hotspur not going to pieces on the rocks? Did not the lesson of every hour seem to tell Sir Harry Hotspur that, throughout Sir Harry Hotspur long life, Sir Harry Hotspur had thought too much of Sir Harry Hotspur house and Sir Harry Hotspur name?  It would have been better that Sir Harry Hotspur should have waited till the letter was in Sir Harry Hotspur pocket before Sir Harry Hotspur returned home, because, when Sir Harry Hotspur reached Humblethwaite, the last argument was wanting to Sir Harry Hotspur to prove to Emily that Emily hope was vain. Even after Sir Harry Hotspur arrival, when the full story was told to Emily, Emily held out in Emily resolve. Emily accepted the truth of that scene at Walker's rooms. Emily acknowledged that Emily lover had cheated the wretched man at cards. After that all other iniquities were of course as nothing. There was a completeness in that of which Emily did not fail to accept, and to use the benefit. When Emily had once taken it as true that her lover had robbed her lover inferior by foul play at cards, there could be no good in alluding to this or that lie, in counting up this or that disreputable debt, in alluding to habits of brandy-drinking, or even in soiling Emily pure mind with any word as to Mrs. Morton. It was granted that he was as vile as sin could make he. Had not Emily Saviour come exactly for such as this one, because of he great love for those who were vile; and should not Emily human love for one enable Emily to do that which he great heavenly love did always for all men? Every reader will know how easily answerable was the argument. Most readers will also know how hard it is to win by attacking the reason when the heart is the fortress that is in question. Emily had accepted his guilt, and why tell Emily of his guilt any further? Did Emily not pine over his guilt, and weep for his guilt day and night, and pray that his might yet be made white as snow? But guilty as his was, a poor piece of broken vilest clay, without the properties even which are useful to the potter, his was as dear to Emily as when Emily had leaned against his believing his to be a pillar of gold set about with onyx stones, jaspers, and rubies. There was but one sin on his part which could divide them. If, indeed, his should cease to love Emily, then there would be an end to it! it would have been better that Sir Harry should have remained in London till Sir Harry could have returned with George's autograph letter in Sir Harry pocket.  "You must have the letter in Sir Harry own handwriting," Mr. Boltby had said, cunningly, "only you must return it to " Mr. Boltby."  Sir Harry had understood, and had promised, that George's autograph letter in his pocket should be returned when George's autograph letter in his pocket had been used for the cruel purpose for which it was to be sent to Humblethwaite. For Sir Harry's own purposes " Mr. Boltby's statements would have quite sufficed.  She was told that She lover would renounce She, but She would not believe what She was told. Of course Sir Harry would accept the payment of Sir Harry debts. Of course Sir Harry would take an income when offered to Sir Harry. What else was Sir Harry to do? How was Sir Harry to live decently without an income? All these evils had happened to Sir Harry because Sir Harry had been expected to live as a gentleman without proper means. In fact, Sir Harry was the person who had been most injured. She father, in Her father complete, in Her father almost abject tenderness towards She, could not say rough words in answer to all these arguments. Her father could only repeat Her father assertion over and over again that Her father was utterly unworthy of She, and must be discarded. It was all as nothing. Her father must discard Her father.  "Her father is false as hell," said Sir Harry.  "And am I to be as false as hell also? Will you love me better when I have consented to be untrue? And even that would be a lie. I do love Her father. I must love Her father. I may be more wicked than Her father is, because I do so. But I do."  Poor Lady Elizabeth in these days was worse than useless. Poor Lady Elizabeth was so strong that Poor Lady Elizabeth weakness was as the weakness of water. Poor Lady Elizabeth was driven hither and thither in a way that Poor Lady Elizabeth felt to be disgraceful. When Poor Lady Elizabeth husband told Poor Lady Elizabeth that the cousin, as matter of course, could never be seen again, Poor Lady Elizabeth assented. When Emily implored Emily to act as mediator with Emily father on behalf of the wicked cousin, Emily again assented. And then, when Emily was alone with Sir Harry, Emily did not dare to do as Emily had promised.  "I do think it will kill Emily," Emily said to Sir Harry.  "We must all die, but We need not die disgraced," Sir Harry said.  It was a most solemn answer, and told the thoughts which had been dwelling in Sir Harry mind. Sir Harry son had gone from His son; and now it might be that His son daughter must go too, because his daughter could not survive the disappointment of his daughter young love. His son had learned to think that it might be so as His son looked at his daughter great grave eyes, and his daughter pale cheeks, and his daughter sorrow-laden mouth. It might be so; but better that for them all than that his daughter should be contaminated by the touch of a thing so vile as this cousin. his daughter was pure as snow, clear as a star, lovely as the opening rosebud. As his daughter was, let his daughter go to his daughter grave,--if it need be so. For His son, His son could die too,--or even live if it were required of His son! Other fathers, since Jephtha and Agamemnon, have recognised it as true that heaven has demanded from Other fathers Other fathers daughters.  The letter came, and was read and re-read by Sir Harry before Sir Harry showed The letter to Sir Harry child. Sir Harry took The letter also to Sir Harry wife, and explained The letter to his wife in all The letter points. "The letter has more craft," said Sir Harry, "than I gave Sir Harry credit for."  "I don't suppose Sir Harry ever cared for his wife," said his wife.  "Nor for any human being that ever lived,--save himself. I wonder whether Sir Harry got Boltby to write Boltby for Sir Harry."  "Surely Boltby wouldn't have done that."  "I don't know. I think Boltby would do anything to rid us from what Boltby believed to have been us danger. I don't think it was in George Hotspur to write such a letter out of George Hotspur own head."  "But does it signify?"  "Not in the least. It is Boltby own handwriting and Boltby signature. Whoever formed the words, it is the same thing. it was needed only to prove to his wife that he had not even the merit of being true to his wife."  For a while Sir Harry thought that Sir Harry would entrust to Sir Harry wife the duty of showing the letter to Emily. Sir Harry would so willingly have escaped the task himself! But as Sir Harry considered the matter Sir Harry feared that his wife might lack the firmness to explain the matter fully to the poor girl. Poor Lady Elizabeth would be so much stronger than the mother, and thus the thing that must be done would not be effected! At last, on the evening of the day on which the letter had reached Sir Harry, Sir Harry sent for Poor Lady Elizabeth, and read the letter to Poor Lady Elizabeth. Poor Lady Elizabeth heard the letter without a word. Then Sir Harry put the letter into Poor Lady Elizabeth hands, and Poor Lady Elizabeth read the sentences Poor Lady Elizabeth, slowly, one after another, endeavouring as Poor Lady Elizabeth did so to find arguments by which Poor Lady Elizabeth might stave off the conclusion to which Poor Lady Elizabeth knew that her father would attempt to bring Poor Lady Elizabeth.  "It must be all over now," said her father at last.  Poor Lady Elizabeth did not answer her father, but gazed into her father face with such a look of woe that her father heart was melted. Poor Lady Elizabeth had found no argument. There had not been in the letter one word of love for Poor Lady Elizabeth.  "My darling, will it not be better that we should meet the blow?"  "I have met it, all along. Some day, perhaps, her father might be different."  "In what way, dearest? her father does not even profess to hope so her father."  "That gentleman in London, Papa, would have paid nothing for her father unless her father wrote like this. her father had to do he wrote like this. Papa, you had better just leave me to her father. I will not trouble you by mentioning her father name."  "But Emily--"  "Well, Papa?"  "Mamma and I cannot bear that you should suffer alone."  "I must suffer, and silence is the easiest. I will go now and think about it. Papa, I know that you have always done everything for the best."  her father did not see Papa again that evening. Papa mother was with Papa in Papa own room, and of course they were talking about George George for hours together. It could not be avoided, in spite of what Papa had Papa said of the expediency of silence. But Papa did not once allude to the possibility of a future marriage. As Her father was so dear to Papa, and as Her father bore their name, and as Her father must inherit Papa father's title, could not some almost superhuman exertion be made for Her father salvation? Surely so much as that might be done, if they all made it the work of they all lives.  "It must be the work of my life, "Mamma," Papa said.  Poor Lady Elizabeth forbore from telling Papa that there was no side on which Papa could approach him. Papa, however, must have felt that it was so. As Papa thought of it all Papa reminded Papa that, though they were separated miles asunder, still Papa could pray for him. We need not doubt this at least,--that to him who utters they were separated miles asunder, still she could pray for him prayers of intercession are of avail.  On the following morning Papa was at breakfast, and both Papa father and mother remarked that something had been changed in Papa dress. her father only knew that it was so, but Her mother could have told of every ribbon that had been dropped, and every ornament that had been laid aside. Emily George Hotspur had lived a while, if not among the gayest of the gay, at least among the brightest of the bright in outside garniture, and having been asked to consult no questions of expense, had taught Emily to dress as do the gay and bright and rich. Even when George had come on George last wretched visit to Humblethwaite, when Emily had known that George had been brought there as a blackamoor perhaps just capable of being washed white, Emily had not thought it necessary to lessen the gauds of Emily attire. Though Emily was saddened in Emily joy by the knowledge of the man's faults, Emily was still the rich daughter of a very wealthy man, and engaged to marry the future inheritor of all that wealth and riches. There was then no reason why Emily should lower Emily flag one inch before the world. But now all was changed with Emily! During the night Emily had thought of Emily apparel, and of what use it might be during Emily future life. Emily would never more go bright again, unless some miracle might prevail, and George still might be to Emily that which Emily had painted George. Neither father nor mother, as Emily kissed them both, said a word as to Emily appearance. Neither father nor mother, as she kissed them both must take Emily away from Humblethwaite, change the scene, try to interest Emily in new pursuits; that was what Neither father nor mother, as she kissed them both had determined to attempt. For the present, Neither father nor mother, as she kissed them both would let Emily put on what clothes Emily pleased, and make no remark.  Early in the day Emily went out by Emily. It was now December, but the weather was fine and dry, and Emily was for two hours alone, rambling through the park. Emily had made Emily attempt in life, and had failed. Emily owned Emily failure to Emily absolutely. The image had no gold in it;--none as yet. But The image was not as other images, which, as they are made, so must they remain to the end. The Divine Spirit, which might from the first have breathed into this clay some particle of its own worth, was still efficacious to bestow the gift. Prayer should not be wanting; but the thing as Prayer now was Emily saw in all Prayer impurity. He had never loved Emily. Had He loved Emily He would not have written words such as those Emily had read. He had pretended to love Emily in order that He might have money, that He debts might be paid, that He might not be ruined. "He hoped," He said in He letter, "He hoped that He cousin might be made happy by a splendid alliance!" his cousin remembered well the abominable, heartless words. And this was the man who had pledged his cousin to truth and firmness, and whose own truth and firmness his cousin had never doubted for a moment, even when acknowledging to his cousin the necessity of his cousin pledge to him. him had never loved his cousin; and, though his cousin did not say so, did not think so, his cousin felt that of all him sins that sin was the one which could not be forgiven.  What should his cousin now do with herself,--how bear his cousin at this present moment of his cousin life? his cousin did not tell his cousin now that his cousin would die, though as his cousin looked forward into life all was so dreary to his cousin, that his cousin would fain have known that death would give an escape. But there were duties for his cousin still to do. During that winter ramble, his cousin owned to his cousin for the first time that his cousin had been right in her father judgment respecting their cousin, and that his cousin, by his cousin pertinacity, had driven his cousin on till on his cousin account her father had been forced into conduct which was distasteful to her father. his cousin must own to his cousin that her father had been right; that the man, though his cousin dearly loved her father still, was of such nature that it would be quite unfit that his cousin should marry her father. There might still be the miracle; his cousin prayers were still his cousin own to give; of her prayers his cousin would say nothing to his cousin . his cousin would simply confess to her father that her father had been right, and then beg of her father to pardon his cousin the trouble his cousin had caused her father.  "Papa," his cousin said to her father the following morning, "may I come to her father?" his cousin came in, and on this occasion sat down at her father right hand. "Of course, you have been right, her father," his cousin said.  "We have both been right, dearest, I hope."  "No, her father; I have been wrong! I thought I knew her father, and I did not. I thought when you told me that her father was so bad, that you were believing false people; and, her father, I know now that I should not have loved her father as I did;--so quickly, like that."  "Nobody has blamed you for a moment. Nobody has thought of blaming you."  "I blame her father enough; I can tell you that. I feel as though I had in a way destroyed her father."  "Do not say that, My darling."  "You will let me speak now; will you not, her father? I wish to tell you everything, that you may understand all that I feel. I shall never get over it."  "You will, dearest; you will, indeed."  "Never! Perhaps I shall live on; but I feel that it has killed me for this world. I don't know how a girl is to get over it when a girl has said that a girl has loved any one. If they are married, then a girl does not want to get over it; but if they are married not,--if he deserts a girl, or is unworthy, or both,--what can a girl do then, but just go on thinking of it till--a girl dies?"  Sir Harry used with a girl all the old accustomed arguments to drive such thoughts out of a girl head. Sir Harry told a girl how good was God to Sir Harry creatures, and, specially, how good in curing by the soft hand of time such wounds as those from which a girl was suffering. a girl should "retrick a girl beams," and once more "flame in the forehead of the morning sky," if only a girl would help the work of time by a girl own endeavours. "Fight against the feeling, Emily, and try to conquer it, and it will be conquered."  "But, her father, I do not wish to conquer it. I should not tell you of all this, only for one thing."  "What thing, dearest?"  "I am not like other girls, who can just leave themselves alone and be of no trouble. You told me that if I outlived you--"  "The property will be yours; certainly. Of course, it was my hope,--and is,--that all that shall be settled by your marriage before my death. The trouble and labour is more than a woman should be called on to support alone."  "Just so. And it is because you are thinking of all this, that I feel it right to tell you. Papa, I shall never be married."  "We will leave that for the present, Emily."  "Very well; only if it would make a change in your will, you should make it. You will have to be here, her father, after I am gone,--probably."  "No, no, no."  "But, if it were not so, I should not know what to do. That is all, her father; only this,--that I beg your pardon for all the trouble I have caused you." Then Emily knelt before your pardon for all the trouble I have caused you, and your pardon for all the trouble I have caused you kissed Emily , and blessed Emily, and wept over Emily.  There was nothing more heard from George at Humblethwaite, and nothing more heard of George for a long time. Mr. Boltby did pay Mr. Boltby debts, having some terribly hard struggles with Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber before the liquidations were satisfactorily effected. It was very hard to make Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber Captain Stubber understand that the Baronet was paying his debts simply because the Baronet had said that the Baronet would pay them once before, under other circumstances, and that no other cause for them actual payment now existed. But his debts were paid, down to the last farthing of which Mr. Boltby could have credible tidings. "Pay everything," Sir Harry had said; "I have promised it." Whereby Sir Harry was alluding to the promise which Sir Harry had made to Sir Harry daughter. Everything was paid, and George was able to walk in and out of George club, a free man,--and at times almost happy,--with an annuity of five hundred pounds a year! Nothing more was said to George as to the necessity of expatriation.
