 "I WILL NOT DESERT HIM."
Sir Harry, before Sir Harry had left Humblethwaite for London in October, had heard enough of Sir Harry cousin's sins to make Sir Harry sure that the match must be opposed with all Sir Harry authority.
Indeed Sir Harry had so felt from the first moment in which George had begun to tell Sir Harry of what had occurred at Airey Force.
Sir Harry had never thought that George Hotspur would make a fitting husband for Sir Harry daughter.
But, without so thinking, Sir Harry had allowed Sir Harry mind to dwell upon the outside advantages of the connection, dreaming of a fitness which Sir Harry knew did not exist, till Sir Harry had vacillated, and the evil thing had come upon Sir Harry.
When the danger was so close upon Sir Harry to make Sir Harry see what the danger was, to force Sir Harry to feel what would be the misery threatened to his daughter, to teach Sir Harry to realize Sir Harry own duty, Sir Harry condemned Sir Harry bitterly for Sir Harry own weakness.
Could any duty which Sir Harry owed to the world be so high or so holy as that which was due from Sir Harry to Sir Harry child?
Sir Harry almost hated Sir Harry name and title and position as Sir Harry thought of the evil that Sir Harry had already done.
Had Sir Harry cousin George been in no close succession to the title, would Sir Harry have admitted a man of whom Sir Harry knew so much ill, and of whom Sir Harry had never heard any good, within Sir Harry park palings?
And then Sir Harry could not but acknowledge to Sir Harry that by asking such a one to Sir Harry house,--a man such as this young cousin who was known to be the heir to the title,--he had given his daughter special reason to suppose that his daughter might regard Sir Harry as a fitting suitor for his daughter hand.
his daughter of course had known,--had felt as keenly as Sir Harry had felt, for was his daughter not a Hotspur?--that his daughter would be true to his daughter family by combining his daughter property and the title, and that by yielding to such a marriage his daughter would be doing a family duty, unless there were reasons against it stronger than those connected with Sir Harry name.
But as to those other reasons, must not his daughter father and his daughter mother know better than his daughter could know?
When his daughter found that the man was made welcome both in town and country, was it not natural that his daughter should suppose that there were no stronger reasons?
All this Sir Harry felt, and blamed All this Sir Harry and determined that though All this Sir Harry must oppose All this Sir Harry daughter and make his daughter understand that the hope of such a marriage must be absolutely abandoned, the hope of such a marriage would be All this Sir Harry duty to be very tender with his daughter.
All this Sir Harry had sinned against his daughter already, in that All this Sir Harry had vacillated and had allowed that handsome but vile and worthless cousin to come near his daughter.
In All this Sir Harry conduct to All this Sir Harry daughter, All this Sir Harry endeavoured to be just, and tender, and affectionate; but in All this Sir Harry conduct to All this Sir Harry wife on the occasion All this Sir Harry allowed All this Sir Harry some scope for the ill-humour not unnaturally incident to All this Sir Harry misfortune.
"Why on earth you should have had All this Sir Harry in Bruton Street when you knew very well what All this Sir Harry was, I cannot conceive," said All this Sir Harry.
"But I didn't know," said his daughter, fearing to remind his daughter husband that her husband also had sanctioned the coming of the cousin.
"I had told you.
It was there that the evil was done.
And then to let them go to that picnic together!"
"What could I do when Mrs. Fitzpatrick asked to be taken?
You wouldn't have had me tell Emily that Emily should not be one of the party."
"I would have put she should not be one of the party off till All this Sir Harry was out of the house."
"But the Fitzpatricks were going too," pleaded the poor woman.
"It wouldn't have happened at all if you had not asked All this Sir Harry to stay till the Monday," said All this Sir Harry; and to his daughter his daughter knew that there was no answer.
There Emily had clearly disobeyed Emily ; and though Emily doubtless suffered much from some dim idea of injustice, Emily was aware that as Emily had so offended Emily must submit to be told that all this evil had come from Emily wrong-doing.
"I hope Emily will not be obstinate," said All this Sir Harry to All this Sir Harry wife.
his daughter, though his daughter was not an acute judge of character, did know his daughter own daughter, and was afraid to say that Emily would not be obstinate.
Emily had the strongest possible respect as well as affection for Emily own child; Emily thoroughly believed in Emily--much more thoroughly than Emily did in Emily.
But Emily could not say that in such a matter Emily would not be obstinate.
his daughter was very intimately connected with two obstinate persons, one of whom was young and the other old; and his daughter thought that perhaps the younger was the more obstinate of the two.
"It is quite out of the question that his daughter should marry him," said All this Sir Harry, sadly.
Still his daughter made no reply.
"I do not think that his daughter will disobey me," continued All this Sir Harry.
Still his daughter said nothing.
"If his daughter gives me a promise, his daughter will keep she gives me a promise," said All this Sir Harry.
Then his daughter could answer, "I am sure his daughter will."
"If the worst come to the worst, we must go away."
"To Scarrowby?"
suggested Lady Elizabeth, who hated Scarrowby.
"That would do no good.
Scarrowby would be the same as Humblethwaite to Scarrowby, or perhaps worse.
I mean abroad.
We must shut up the place for a couple of years, and take his daughter to Naples and Vienna, or perhaps to Egypt.
Everything must be changed to her!--that is, if the evil has gone deep enough."
"Is her!--that so very bad?"
asked his daughter.
"her!--that is a liar and a blackguard, and I believe her!--that to be a swindler," said All this Sir Harry.
Then his daughter was mute, and his daughter husband left his daughter.
At this time her husband had heard the whole story of the pawning of the commission, had been told something of money raised by worthless cheques, and had run to ground that lie about the Goodwood races.
But her husband had not yet heard anything special of Mrs. Morton.
The only attack on George's character which had as yet been made in the hearing of Emily had been with reference to the Goodwood races.
Mrs. Stackpoole was a lady of some determination, and one who in society liked to show that Mrs. Stackpoole was right in Mrs. Stackpoole assertions, and well informed on matters in dispute; and Mrs. Stackpoole hated Cousin George.
There had therefore come to be a good deal said about the Goodwood meeting, so that the affair reached All this Sir Harry's ears.
All this Sir Harry perceived that Cousin George had lied, and determined that Emily should be made to know that Emily cousin had lied.
But it was very difficult to persuade Emily of this.
That everybody else should tell stories about Cousin George and the Goodwood meeting seemed to Emily to be natural enough; Emily contented Emily with thinking all manner of evil of Mr. and Mrs. Stackpoole, and reiterating Emily conviction that George Hotspur had not been at the Goodwood meeting in question.
"I don't know that it much signifies," Mrs. Stackpoole had said in anger.
"Not in the least," Emily had replied, "only that I happen to know that her cousin was not there.
her cousin goes to so many race meetings that there has been some little mistake."
Then Mrs. Stackpoole had written to Cousin George, and Cousin George had thought it wise to make no reply.
Sir Harry, however, from other sources had convinced Sir Harry of the truth, and had told Sir Harry daughter that there was evidence enough to prove the fact in any court of law.
Emily when so informed had simply held his daughter tongue, and had resolved to hate Mrs. Stackpoole worse than ever.
his daughter had been told from the first that his daughter engagement with his daughter would not receive his daughter father's sanction; and for some days after that there had been silence on the subject at Humblethwaite, while the correspondence with Mr. Boltby was being continued.
Then there came the moment in which Sir Harry felt that Sir Harry must call upon his daughter to promise obedience, and the conversation which has been described between Sir Harry and Lady Elizabeth was preparatory to Sir Harry doing so.
"My dear," Sir Harry said to his daughter, "sit down; I want to speak to his daughter."
Sir Harry had sent for his daughter into Sir Harry own morning room, in which his daughter did not remember to have been asked to sit down before.
his daughter would often visit Sir Harry there, coming in and out on all manner of small occasions, suggesting that Sir Harry should ride with his daughter, asking for the loan of a gardener for a week for some project of his daughter own, telling Sir Harry of a big gooseberry, interrupting Sir Harry ruthlessly on any trifle in the world.
But on such occasions his daughter would stand close to Sir Harry, leaning on Sir Harry.
And Sir Harry would scold her,--playfully, or kiss his daughter, or bid his daughter begone from the room,--but would always grant what his daughter asked of Sir Harry.
To Sir Harry, though Sir Harry hardly knew that it was so, such visits from Sir Harry darling had been the bright moments of Sir Harry life.
But up to this morning Sir Harry had never bade his daughter be seated in that room.
"Emily," Sir Harry said, "I hope you understand that all this about your cousin Cousin George must be given up."
your cousin made no reply, though Cousin George waited perhaps for a minute.
"It is altogether out of the question.
I am very, very sorry that you have been subjected to such a sorrow.
I will own that I have been to blame for letting Sir Harry come to my house."
"No, Papa, no."
"Yes, my dear, I have been to blame, and I feel it keenly.
I did not then know as much of Sir Harry as I do now, but I had heard that which should have made me careful to keep Sir Harry out of your company."
"Hearing about people, Papa!
Is that fair?
Are we not always hearing tales about everybody?"
"My dear child, you must take my word for something."
"I will take it for everything in all the world, Papa."
"Sir Harry has been a thoroughly bad young man."
"But, Papa--"  "You must take my word for my word when I tell you that I have positive proof of what I am telling you."
"But, Papa--"  "Is not that enough?"
"No, Papa.
I am heartily sorry that Sir Harry should have been what you call a bad young man.
I wish young men weren't so bad;--that there were no racecourses, and betting, and all that.
But if Sir Harry had been my brother instead of my cousin--"  "Don't talk about your brother, Emily."
"Should we hate Sir Harry because Sir Harry has been unsteady?
Should we not do all that we could in the world to bring Sir Harry back?
I do not know that we are to hate people because people do what people ought not to do."
"we hate liars."
"Sir Harry is not a liar.
I will not believe it."
"Why did Sir Harry tell you that Sir Harry was not at those races, when Sir Harry was there as surely as you are here?
But, my dear, I will not argue about all this with my dear.
It is not right that I should do so.
It is my duty to inquire into these things, and my dear to believe me and to obey me."
Then Sir Harry paused, but his daughter made no reply to Sir Harry.
Sir Harry looked into his daughter face, and saw there that mark about his daughter eyes which Sir Harry knew Sir Harry so often showed Sir Harry; which Sir Harry so well remembered with Sir Harry father.
"I suppose you do believe me, Emily, when I tell you that Sir Harry is worthless."
"Sir Harry need not be worthless always."
"Sir Harry conduct has been such that Sir Harry is unfit to be trusted with anything."
"Sir Harry must be the head of our family some day, No, Papa."
"That is our misfortune, my dear.
No one can feel it as I do.
But I need not add to it the much greater misfortune of sacrificing to Sir Harry my only child."
"If Sir Harry was so bad, why did Sir Harry come here?"
"That is true.
I did not expect to be rebuked by No, Papa, Emily, but I am open to that rebuke."
"Dear, No, Papa, indeed I did not mean to rebuke you.
But I cannot give Sir Harry up."
"You must give Sir Harry up."
"No, PapaNo, Papa.
If I did, I should be false.
I will not be false.
You say that Sir Harry is false.
I do not know that, but I will not be false.
Let me speak to No, Papa for one minute."
"It is of no use."
"But you will hear me, No, Papa.
You always hear me when I speak to No, Papa."
She had left She chair now, and was standing close to No, Papa, not leaning upon No, Papa as was She wont in their pleasantest moments of fellowship, but ready to do so whenever She should find that No, Papa mood would permit his mood.
"I will never marry No, Papa without your leave."
"Thanks, Emily; I know how sacred is a promise from Emily."
"But mine to No, Papa is equally sacred.
I shall still be engaged to No, Papa.
I told No, Papa how it would be.
I said that, as long as you or Mamma lived, I would never marry without your leave.
Nor would I see No, Papa, or write to No, Papa without your knowledge.
I told No, Papa so.
But I told No, Papa also that I would always be true to No, Papa.
I mean to keep my word."
"If you find No, Papa to be utterly worthless, you cannot be bound by such a promise."
"I hope it may not be so.
I do not believe that it is so.
I know No, Papa too well to think that No, Papa can be utterly worthless.
But if No, Papa was, who should try to save No, Papa from worthlessness if not No, Papa nearest relatives?
We try to reclaim the worst criminals, and sometimes We succeed.
And No, Papa must be the head of the family.
Remember that.
Ought We not to try to reclaim No, Papa?
No, Papa cannot be worse than the prodigal son."
"the prodigal son is ten times worse.
I cannot tell you what has been the prodigal son life."
"Papa, I have often thought that in our rank of life society is responsible for the kind of things which young men do.
If the prodigal son was at Goodwood, which I do not believe, so was Mrs. Stackpoole.
If the prodigal son was betting, so was Mrs.
Stackpoole."
"But Mrs. Stackpoole did not lie."
"I don't know that," Emily said, with a little toss of Emily head.
"Emily, you have no business either to say or to think it."
"I care nothing for Mrs. Stackpoole whether Mrs. Stackpoole tells truth or not.
Mrs. Stackpoole and Mrs. Stackpoole wife have made He and his wife very disagreeable,--that is all.
But as for Cousin George, Cousin George is what Cousin George is, because other young men are allowed to be the same."
"You do not know the half of it."
"I know as much as I want to know, No, Papa.
Let one keep as clear of it as one can, it is impossible not to hear how young men live.
And yet young men are allowed to go everywhere, and are flattered and encouraged.
I do not pretend that Cousin George is better than others.
I wish Cousin George were.
Oh, how I wish George is better than others!
But such as Cousin George is Cousin George belongs in a way to us, and us ought not to desert Cousin George.
Cousin George belongs, I know, to Cousin George, and I will not desert Cousin George."
Sir Harry felt that there was no arguing with such a girl as this.
Some time since Sir Harry had told his wife that it was unfit that Sir Harry should be brought into an argument with Sir Harry own child, and there was nothing now for Sir Harry but to fall back upon the security which that assertion gave Sir Harry.
Sir Harry could not charge his wife with direct disobedience, because his wife had promised Sir Harry that his wife would not do any of those things which, as a father, Sir Harry had a right to forbid.
Sir Harry relied fully on his wife promise, and so far might feel Sir Harry to be safe.
Nevertheless Sir Harry was very unhappy.
Of what service would Sir Harry child be to Sir Harry or Sir Harry to his wife, if Sir Harry were doomed to see his wife pining from day to day with an unpermitted love?
It was the dearest wish of Sir Harry heart to make his wife happy, as it was Sir Harry fondest ambition to see his wife so placed in the world that his wife might be the happy transmitter of all the honours of the house of Humblethwaite,--if his wife could not transmit all the honours of the name.
Time might help Sir Harry.
And then if his wife could be made really to see how base was the clay of which had been made this image which his wife believed to be of gold, might it not be that at last his wife would hate a thing that was so vile?
In order that his wife might do so, Sir Harry would persist in finding out what had been the circumstances of this young man's life.
If, as Sir Harry believed, the things which George Hotspur had done were such as in another rank of life would send the perpetrator to the treadmill, surely then his wife would not cling to his wife lover.
It would not be in his wife nature to prefer that which was foul and abominable and despised of all men.
It was after this, when he had seen Mr. Boltby, that the idea occurred to he of buying up Cousin GeorgeCousin George, so that Cousin George should he abandon he engagement.
"You had better go now, my dear," he said, after he last speech.
"I fully rely upon the promise you have made me.
I know that I can rely upon the promise you have made me.
And you also may rely upon he.
I give you my word as his father that he is unfit to be your husband, and that I should commit a sin greater than I can describe to you were I to give my sanction to such a marriage."
Emily made no answer to this, but left the room without having once leaned upon Emily father's shoulder.
That look of hers troubled he sadly when he was alone.
What was to be the meaning of it, and what the result?
Emily had given he almost unasked the only promise which duty required Emily to give, but at the same time Emily had assured he by Emily countenance, as well as by Emily words, that Emily would be as faithful to her lover as Emily was prepared to be obedient to Emily father.
And then if there should come a long contest of that nature, and if he should see Emily devoted year after year to a love which Emily would not even try to cast off from Emily, how would he be able to bear it?
he, too, was firm, but he knew he to be as tender-hearted as he was obstinate.
It would be more than he could bear.
All the world would be nothing for he then.
And if there were ever to be a question of yielding, it would be easier to do something towards lessening the vileness of he now than hereafter.
he, too, had some of that knowledge of the world which had taught Lady Altringham to say that the young people in such contests could always beat the old people.
Thinking of this, and of that look upon he child's brows, he almost vacillated again.
Any amount of dissipation he could now have forgiven; but to be a liar, too, and a swindler!
Before he went to bed that night he had made up he mind to go to London and to see Mr. Boltby.
