 THE BALL IN BRUTON STREET.   Sir Harry vacillated, Lady Elizabeth doubted, and Cousin George was allowed to come to  THE BALL IN BRUTON STREET.   . At this time, in the common understanding of such phrase, Emily Hotspur was heart-whole in regard to Emily Hotspur cousin. Had Emily Hotspur been made to know that her cousin had gone away for ever,--been banished to some antipodes from which her cousin never could return,--there would have been no lasting sorrow on Emily Hotspur part, though there might have been some feeling which would have given Emily Hotspur an ache for the moment. Emily Hotspur had thought about her cousin, as girls will think of men as to whom men own to men that it is possible that men may be in love with men some day;--and Emily Hotspur liked her cousin much. Emily Hotspur also liked Lord Alfred, but the liking had been altogether of a different kind. In regard to Lord Alfred Emily Hotspur had been quite sure, from the first days of Emily Hotspur intercourse with Lord Alfred, that Emily Hotspur could never be in love with Lord Alfred. Lord Alfred was to Emily Hotspur no more than old Mr. Crutchley or young Mr. Latheby,--a man, and a good sort of man, but no more than a man. To worship Lord Alfred must be impossible to Emily Hotspur. Emily Hotspur had already conceived that it would be quite possible for Emily Hotspur to worship Emily Hotspur Cousin George in the teeth of all the hard things that Emily Hotspur had heard of her Cousin George. The reader may be sure that such a thought had passed through Emily Hotspur mind when Emily Hotspur asked Emily Hotspur mother whether her Cousin George was to be accepted as a black sheep or a white one?  The ball was a very grand affair, and Emily Hotspur was a very great lady. The ball had come to be understood that the successful suitor for Emily Hotspur hand would be the future lord of Humblethwaite, and the power with which Emily Hotspur was thus vested gave Emily Hotspur a prestige and standing which can hardly be attained by mere wit and beauty, even when most perfectly combined. It was not that all who worshipped, either at a distance or with passing homage, knew the fact of the heiress-ship, or had ever heard of the L20,000 a year; but, given the status, and the worshippers will come. The word had gone forth in some mysterious way, and The word was acknowledged that Emily Hotspur was a great young lady. Other young ladies, who were not great, allowed Other young ladies, who were not great to be postponed to Emily Hotspur was a great young lady almost without jealousy, and young gentlemen without pretensions regarded Emily Hotspur was a great young lady as one to whom Other young ladies, who were not great did not dare to ask to be introduced. Emily saw it all, and partly liked it, and partly despised it. But, even when despising it, Emily Hotspur was a great young lady took advantage of it. The young gentlemen without pretensions were no more to Emily Hotspur was a great young lady than the chairs and tables; and the young ladies who submitted to Emily Hotspur was a great young lady and adored her,--were allowed to be submissive, and to adore. But of this Emily Hotspur was a great young lady was quite sure,--that Emily Hotspur was a great young lady Cousin George must some day be the head of Emily Hotspur was a great young lady own family. Cousin George was a man whom Emily Hotspur was a great young lady was bound to treat with attentive regard, if they who had the custody of Emily Hotspur was a great young lady chose to place Emily Hotspur was a great young lady in Cousin George company at all.  At this ball there were some very distinguished people indeed,--persons whom it would hardly be improper to call illustrious. There were two royal duchesses, one of whom was English, and no less than three princes. The Russian and French ambassadors were both there. There was the editor of the most influential newspaper of the day,--for a few minutes only; and the Prime Minister passed through the room in the course of the evening. Dukes and duchesses below the royal degree were common; and as for earls and countesses, and Dukes and duchesses below the royal degree daughters, Dukes and duchesses below the royal degree formed the ruck of the crowd. The Poet-laureate didn't come indeed, but was expected; and three Chinese mandarins of the first quality entered the room at eleven, and did not leave till one. Poor Lady Elizabeth suffered a great deal with three Chinese mandarins of the first quality. From all this it will be seen that the ball was quite a success.  George Hotspur dined that day with Lord and Lady Altringham, and went with Lord and Lady Altringham to the ball in the evening. Lady Altringham, though Lady Altringham manner was airy and almost indifferent, was in truth most anxious that Lady Altringham friend should be put upon Lady Altringham feet by the marriage; and the Countess was so keen about it, that there was nothing in the way of innocent intrigue which the Countess would not have done to accomplish it. the Countess knew that George Hotspur was a rake, was a gambler, was in debt, was hampered by other difficulties, and all the rest of it; but the Countess liked Lady Altringham, and was therefore willing to believe that a rich marriage would put it all right. George Hotspur was nothing to Emily, nor was Sir Harry; but George had often made Emily own house pleasant to Emily, and therefore, to Emily thinking, deserved a wife with L20,000 a year. And then, if there might have been scruples under other circumstances, that fact of the baronetcy overcame other circumstances. It could not be wrong in one placed as was Lady Altringham to assist in preventing any separation of the title and the property. Of course George might probably squander all that George could squander; but that might be made right by settlements and entails. Lady Altringham was much more energetic than Lady Altringham husband, and had made out quite a plan of the manner in which George should proceed. Lady Altringham discussed the matter with George at great length. The one difficulty Lady Altringham was, indeed, obliged to slur over; but even that was not altogether omitted in Lady Altringham scheme. "Whatever incumbrances there may be, free yourself from them at once," Lady Altringham had advised.  "That is so very easy to say, Lady Altringham, but so difficult to do."  "As to debts, of course debts can't be paid without money. Sir Harry will find it worth Sir Harry while to settle any debts. But if there is anything else, stop it at once." Of course there was something else, and of course Lady Altringham knew what that something else was. Lady Altringham demanded, in accordance with Lady Altringham scheme, that George should lose no time. This was in May. This was known that Sir Harry intended to leave town early in June. "Of course you will take Sir Harry at Sir Harry word, and go to Humblethwaite when you leave us," Lady Altringham had said.  "No time has been named."  "Then you can name your own without difficulty. You will write from Castle Corry and say you are coming. That is, if it's not all settled by that time. Of course, it's not all cannot be done in a minute, because Sir Harry must consent; but I should begin at once,--only, Captain Hotspur, leave nothing for Sir Harry must consent to find out afterwards. What is past Sir Harry must consent will forgive." Such had been Lady Altringham advice, and no doubt Lady Altringham understood the matter which Lady Altringham had been discussing.  When Captain Hotspur entered the room, his Cousin was dancing with a prince. Captain Hotspur could see Lady Altringham as Captain Hotspur stood speaking a few words to Lady Elizabeth. And in talking to Lady Elizabeth Captain Hotspur did not talk as a stranger would, or a common guest. Captain Hotspur had quite understood all that Captain Hotspur might gain by assuming the intimacy of cousinhood, and Captain Hotspur had assumed it. Lady Elizabeth was less weary than before when Captain Hotspur stood by Lady Elizabeth, and accepted from Captain Hotspur hand some little trifle of help, which was agreeable to Lady Elizabeth. And Captain Hotspur showed Captain Hotspur in no hurry, and told Lady Elizabeth some little story that pleased Lady Elizabeth. What a pity it was that his Cousin should be a scamp, Lady Elizabeth thought, as Captain Hotspur went on to greet Sir Harry.  And with Sir Harry Sir Harry remained a minute or two. On such an occasion as Sir Harry was all smiles, and quite willing to hear a little town gossip. "Come with the Altringhams, have you? I'm told Altringham has just sold all Altringham horses. What's the meaning of that?"  "The old story, Sir Harry. The old story, Sir Harry has weeded The old story, Sir Harry stable, and got the buyers to think that the buyers were getting the cream. There isn't a man in England knows better what The old story, Sir Harry's about than Altringham."  Sir Harry smiled Sir Harry sweetest, and answered with some good-humoured remark, but Sir Harry said in Sir Harry heart that "birds of a feather flock together," and that Sir Harry cousin was--not a man of honour.  There are some things that no rogue can do. Sir Harry can understand what it is to condemn roguery, to avoid roguery, to dislike roguery, to disbelieve in it;--but Sir Harry cannot understand what it is to hate roguery. George had probably exaggerated the transaction of which George had spoken, but George had little thought that in doing so George had helped to imbue Sir Harry with a true idea of George own character.  George passed on, and saw George cousin, who was now standing up with a foreign ambassador. George just spoke to a foreign ambassador as George passed a foreign ambassador, calling a foreign ambassador by a foreign ambassador Christian name as George did so. a foreign ambassador gave George a foreign ambassador hand ever so graciously; and George, when George had gone on, returned and asked a foreign ambassador to name a dance.  "But I don't think I've one left that I mean to dance," a foreign ambassador said.  "Then give me one that you don't mean to dance," George answered. And of course a foreign ambassador gave it to George.  It was an hour afterwards that George came to claim a foreign ambassador promise, and a foreign ambassador put a foreign ambassador arm through George and stood up with George. There was no talk then of a foreign ambassador not dancing, and a foreign ambassador went whirling round the room with George in great bliss. George waltzed well. All such men do. It is a part of All such men stock-in-trade. On this evening George Hotspur thought that George Hotspur waltzed better than any one else, and told George Hotspur so. "Another turn? Of course I will with you, because you know what you're about."  "I'd blush if I'd time," said George Hotspur.  "A great many gentlemen ought to blush, I know. That prince, whose name I always forget, and you, are the only men in the room who dance well, according to my ideas."  Then off That prince, whose name I always forget, and you went again, and Emily was very happy. George Hotspur could at least dance well, and there could be no reason why Emily should not enjoy George Hotspur dancing well since George Hotspur had been considered to be white enough to be asked to the ball.  But with George there was present at every turn and twist of the dance an idea that George was there for other work than that. George was tracking a head of game after which there would be many hunters. George had George advantages, and so would his advantages have his advantages. One of George was this,--that George had Emily there with George now, and George must use his advantages. Emily would not fall into George mouth merely by being whirled round the room pleasantly. At last Emily was still, and consented to take a walk with George out of the room, somewhere out amidst the crowd, on the staircase if possible, so as to get a breath of fresh air. Of course George soon had Emily jammed into a corner out of which there was no immediate mode of escape.  "We shall never get away again," Emily said, laughing. Had Emily wanted to get away Emily tone and manner would have been very different.  "I wonder whether you feel yourself to be the same sort of person here that you are at Humblethwaite," person said.  "Exactly the same."  "To me you seem to be so different."  "In what way?"  "I don't think you are half so nice."  "How very unkind!"  Of course Emily was flattered. Of all flattery praise is the coarsest and least efficacious. When you would flatter a man, talk to a man about a man, and criticise a man, pulling a man to pieces by comparison of some small present fault with a man past conduct;--and the rule holds the same with a woman. To tell Emily that Emily looks well is feeble work; but complain to Emily wofully that there is something wanting at the present moment, something lacking from the usual high standard, some temporary loss of beauty, and your solicitude will prevail with Emily.  "And in what am I not nice? I am sure I'm trying to be as nice as I know how."  "Down at Humblethwaite you are simply yourself,--Emily George Hotspur."  "And what am I here?"  "That formidable thing,--a success. Don't you feel yourself that you are lifted a little off your legs?"  "Not a bit;--not an inch. Why should I?"  "I fail to make you understand quite what I mean. Don't you feel that with all these princes and potentates you are forced to be something else than your natural self? Don't you know that you have to put on a special manner, and to talk in a special way? Does not the champagne fly to your head, more or less?"  "Of course, the princes and potentates are not the same as old Mrs. Crutchley, if you mean that."  "I am not blaming you, you know, only I cannot help being very anxious; and I found you so perfect at Humblethwaite that I cannot say that I like any change. You know I am to come to Humblethwaite again?"  "Of course you are."  "You go down next month, I believe?"  "Papa talks of going to Scarrowby for a few weeks. Scarrowby always does every year, and it is so dull. Did you ever see Scarrowby?"  "Never."  "You ought to come there some day. You know one branch of the Hotspurs did live there for ever so long."  "Is it a good house?"  "Very bad indeed; but there are enormous woods, and the country is very wild, and everything is at sixes and sevens. However, of course you would not come, because it is in the middle of your London season. There would be ever so many things to keep you. You are a man who, I suppose, never was out of London in June in your life, unless some race meeting was going on."  "Do you really take me for such as that, Emily?"  "Yes, I do. That is what they tell me you are. Is it not true? Don't you go to races?"  "I should be quite willing to undertake never to put my foot on a racecourse again this minute. I will do so now if you will only ask it of me."  She paused a moment, half thinking that She would ask it, but at last She determined against it.  "No," She said; "if you think it proper to stay away, you can do so without my asking it. I have no right to make such a request. If you think races are bad, why don't you stay away of your own accord?"  "They are bad," he said.  "Then why do you go to They?"  "They are bad, and I do go to They. They are very bad, and I go to They very often. But I will stay away and never put my foot on another racecourse if you, my cousin, will ask me."  "That is nonsense."  "Try me. It shall not be nonsense. If you care enough about he to wish to save me from what is evil, you can do It. I care enough about you to give up the pursuit at your bidding."  As he said this he looked down into She eyes, and She knew that the full weight of he gaze was upon She. She knew that he words and he looks together were intended to impress She with some feeling of he love for She. She knew at the moment, too, that they gratified She. And She remembered also in the same moment that She George was a black sheep.  "If you cannot refrain from what is bad without my asking you," She said, "your refraining will do no good."  he was making She some answer, when She insisted on being taken away. "I must get into the dancing-room; I must indeed, George. I have already thrown over some poor wretch. No, not yet, I see, however. I was not engaged for the quadrille; but I must go back and look after the people."  George led She back through the crowd; and as George did so George perceived that Sir Harry's eyes were fixed upon Sir Harry. George did not much care for that. If George could carry George Cousin Emily, George thought that George might carry the Baronet also.  George could not get any special word with the Baronet again that night. George asked the Baronet for another dance, but the Baronet would not grant another dance to George. "You forget the princes and potentates to whom I have to attend," the Baronet said to George, quoting George own words.  George did not blame the Baronet, even to George, judging by the importance which George attached to every word of private conversation which George could have with the Baronet, that the Baronet found it to be equally important. It was something gained that the Baronet should know that George was thinking of the Baronet. George could not be to the Baronet now like any cousin, or any other man, with whom the Baronet might dance three or four times without meaning anything. As George was aware of it, so must the Baronet be; and George was glad that the Baronet should feel that it was so.  "Emily tells me that you are going to Scarrowby next month," Scarrowby said afterwards to Sir Harry.  Sir Harry frowned, and answered Sir Harry very shortly, "Yes, we shall go there in June."  "Is it a large place?"  "Large? How do you mean? it is a good property."  "But the house?"  "the house?"   is quite large enough for we," said Sir Harry; "but we do not have company there."  This was said in a very cold tone, and there was nothing more to be added. George, to do George justice, had not been fishing for an invitation to Scarrowby. George had simply been making conversation with the Baronet. It would not have suited George to go to Scarrowby, because by doing so George would have lost the power of renewing George visit to Humblethwaite. But Sir Harry in this interview had been so very ungracious,--and as George knew very well, because of the scene in the corner,--that there might be a doubt whether Sir Harry in this interview would ever get to Humblethwaite at all. If Sir Harry in this interview failed, however, he failed should not be for the want of audacity on Sir Harry in this interview own part.  But, in truth, Sir Harry's blackness was still the result of vacillation. Though Sir Harry would fain redeem this prodigal, if it were possible, and give Sir Harry everything that was to be given; yet, when Sir Harry saw the prodigal attempting to help Sir Harry to the good things, Sir Harry wrath was aroused. George Hotspur, as Sir Harry betook George Hotspur from Bruton Street to such other amusements as were at George Hotspur command, meditated much over George Hotspur position. George Hotspur thought George Hotspur could give up the racecourses; but George Hotspur was sure that George Hotspur could at any rate say that George Hotspur would give them up.
