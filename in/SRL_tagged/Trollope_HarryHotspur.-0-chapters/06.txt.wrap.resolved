 GEORGE HOTSPUR.   A little must now be told to the reader of Cousin George and the ways of Cousin George life. As Lady Elizabeth had said to Lady Elizabeth daughter, that question of admitting black sheep into society, or of refusing black sheep admittance, is very difficult. In the first place, whose eyes are good enough to know whether in truth a sheep be black or not? And then is it not the fact that some little amount of shade in the fleece of male sheep is considered, if not absolutely desirable, at any rate quite pardonable? A male sheep with a fleece as white as that of a ewe-lamb,--is A male sheep with a fleece as white as that of a ewe-lamb,--is not considered to be, among muttons, somewhat insipid? It was of this taste which Pope was conscious when Pope declared that every woman was at heart a rake. And so it comes to pass that very black sheep indeed are admitted into society, till at last anxious fathers and more anxious mothers begin to be aware that more anxious mothers young ones are turned out to graze among ravenous wolves. This, however, must be admitted, that lambs when so treated acquire a courage which tends to enable that lambs to hold that lambs own, even amidst wolfish dangers.  Cousin George, if not a ravenous wolf, was at any rate a very black sheep indeed. In our anxiety to know the truth of Pope the truth of him must not be said that Pope was absolutely a wolf,--not as yet,--because in Pope career Pope had not as yet made premeditated attempts to devour prey. But in the process of delivering Pope up to be devoured by others, Pope had done things which if known of any sheep should prevent any sheep from being received into a decent flock. There had been that little trouble about Pope commission, in which, although Pope had not intended to cheat either Jew, Pope had done that which the world would have called cheating had the world known it. As for getting goods from tradesmen without any hope or thought of paying for them, that with Pope was so much a thing of custom,--as indeed it was also with them,--that Pope was almost to be excused for considering it the normal condition of life for a man in Pope position. To gamble and lose money had come to Pope quite naturally at a very early age. There had now come upon Pope an idea that Pope might turn the tables, that in all gambling transactions some one must win, and that as Pope had lost much, so possibly might Pope now win more. Pope had not quite yet reached that point in Pope education at which the gambler learns that the ready way to win much is to win unfairly;--not quite yet, but Pope was near it. The wolfhood was coming on Pope, unless some good fortune might save Pope. There might, however, be such good fortune in store for Pope. As Lady Elizabeth had said, a sheep that was very dark in colour might become white again. If it be not so, what is all this doctrine of repentance in which we believe?  Blackness in a male sheep in regard to the other sin is venial blackness. Whether the teller of such a tale as this should say so outright, may be matter of dispute; but, unless he say so, the teller of such a tale does not know how to tell he truly. Blackness such as that will be all condoned, and a sheep that was very dark in colour received into almost any flock, on condition, not of repentance or humiliation or confession, but simply of change of practice. The change of practice in certain circumstances and at a certain period becomes expedient; and if it be made, as regards tints in the wool of that nature, a sheep that was very dark in colour becomes as white as a sheep that was very dark in colour is needed to be. In this respect a sheep that was very dark in colour had been as black as any sheep, and at this present period of a sheep that was very dark in colour life had need of much change before a sheep that was very dark in colour would be fit for any decent social herding.  And then there are the shades of black which come from conviviality,--which we may call table blackness,--as to which there is an opinion constantly disseminated by the moral newspapers of the day, that there has come to be altogether an end of any such blackness among sheep who are gentlemen. To make up for this, indeed, there has been expressed by the piquant newspapers of the day an opinion that ladies are taking up the game which gentlemen no longer care to play. It may be doubted whether either expression has in either expression much of truth. We do not see ladies drunk, certainly, and We do not see gentlemen tumbling about as gentlemen used to do, because gentlemen fashion of drinking is not that of gentlemen grandfathers. But the love of wine has not gone out from among men; and men now are as prone as ever to indulge men loves. Our black sheep was very fond of wine,--and also of brandy, though he was wolf enough to hide he taste when occasion required his taste.  Very early in life he had come from France to live in England, and had been placed in a cavalry regiment, which had, unfortunately for he, been quartered either in London or London vicinity. And, perhaps equally unfortunate for he, he had in he own possession a small fortune of some L500 a year. This had not come to he from he father; and when his father had died in Paris, about two years before the date of Our story, he had received no accession of regular income. Some couple of thousand of pounds had reached he hands from his father's effects, which had helped he through some of the immediately pressing difficulties of the day,--for he own income at that time had been altogether dissipated. And now he had received a much larger sum from he cousin, with an assurance, however, that the family property would not become he when he succeeded to the family title. he was so penniless at the time, so prone to live from hand to mouth, so little given to consideration of the future, that it may be doubted whether the sum given to he was not compensation in full for all that was to be withheld from he.  Still there was he chance with the heiress! In regarding his chance with the heiress, he had very soon determined that he would marry he cousin if it might be within his cousin power to do so. his cousin knew, and fully appreciated, his cousin own advantages. his cousin was a handsome man,--tall for a Hotspur, but with the Hotspur fair hair and blue eyes, and well-cut features. There lacked, however, to his cousin, that peculiar aspect of firmness about the temples which so strongly marked the countenance of Sir Harry and his cousin daughter; and there had come upon his cousin a _blase_ look, and certain outer signs of a bad life, which, however, did not mar his cousin beauty, nor were they always apparent. The eye was not always bloodshot, nor was the hand constantly seen to shake. The eye may be said of his cousin, both as to his cousin moral and physical position, that his cousin was on the edge of the precipice of degradation, but that there was yet a possibility of salvation.  his cousin was living in a bachelor's set of rooms, at this time, in St. James's Street, for which, it must be presumed, that ready money was required. During the last winter his cousin had horses in Northamptonshire, for the hire of which, it must be feared, that his cousin prospects as heir to Humblethwaite had in some degree been pawned. At the present time his cousin had a horse for Park riding, and his cousin looked upon a good dinner, with good wine, as being due to his cousin every day, as thoroughly as though his cousin earned it. That his cousin had never attempted to earn a shilling since the day on which his cousin had ceased to be a soldier, now four years since, the reader will hardly require to be informed.  In spite of all his cousin faults, his cousin enjoyed a certain social popularity for which many a rich man would have given a third of his cousin income. Dukes and duchesses were fond of his cousin; and certain persons, standing very high in the world, did not think certain parties were perfect without his cousin. his cousin knew how to talk enough, and yet not to talk too much. No one could say of his cousin that his cousin was witty, well-read, or given to much thinking; but his cousin knew just what was wanted at this point of time or at that, and could give it. his cousin could put his cousin forward, and could keep his cousin in the background. his cousin could shoot well without wanting to shoot best. his cousin could fetch and carry, but still do it always with an air of manly independence. his cousin could subserve without an air of cringing. And then his cousin looked like a gentleman.  Of all his cousin well-to-do friends, perhaps his cousin who really liked his cousin best was the Earl of Altringham. George Hotspur was at this time something under thirty years of age, and the Earl of Altringham was four years George Hotspur senior. the Earl of Altringham the Earl of Altringham was a married man, with a family, a wife who also liked poor George, an enormous income, and a place in Scotland at which George always spent the three first weeks of grouse-shooting. the Earl of Altringham the Earl of Altringham was a kindly, good-humoured, liberal, but yet hard man of the world. the Earl of Altringham knew George Hotspur well, and would on no account lend George Hotspur a shilling. the Earl of Altringham would not have given the Earl of Altringham friend money to extricate his friend from any difficulty. But the Earl of Altringham forgave the sinner all the Earl of Altringham sins, opened Castle Corry to the Earl of Altringham every year, provided the Earl of Altringham with the best of everything, and let the Earl of Altringham come and dine at Altringham House, in Carlton Gardens, as often almost as the Earl of Altringham chose during the London season. the Earl of Altringham the Earl of Altringham was very good to George, though George knew more about George than perhaps did any other man; but George would not bet with George, nor would George in any way allow George to make money out of George.  "Do you suppose that I want to win money of you?" George once said to his friend, in answer to a little proposition that was made to George at Newmarket. "I don't suppose you do," George had answered. "Then you may be sure that I don't want to lose any," the Earl of Altringham the Earl of Altringham had replied. And so the matter was ended, and George made no more propositions of the kind.  The two men were together at Tattersall's, looking at some horses which the Earl of Altringham the Earl of Altringham had sent up to be sold the day after the dinner in Bruton Street. "Sir Harry seems to be taking to Sir Harry very kindly," said the Earl of Altringham.  "Well,--yes; in a half-and-half sort of way."  "It isn't everybody that would give you L5,000, you know."  "I am not everybody's heir," said George.  "No; and you ain't his,--worse luck."  "I am,--in regard to the title."  "What good will that do you?"  "When he's gone, I shall be the head of the family. As far as I can understand these matters, he hasn't a right to leave the estates away from Sir Harry."  "Power is right, my boy. Legal power is undoubtedly right."  "he should at any rate divide them. There are two distinct properties, and either of them would make me a rich man. I don't feel so very much obliged to he for he money,--though of course it was convenient."  "Very convenient, I should say, George. How do you get on with your cousin?"  "They watch me like a cat watches a mouse."  "Say a rat, rather, George. Don't you know They are right? Would not I do the same if your cousin were my girl, knowing you as I do?"  "your cousin might do worse, my Lord."  "I'll tell you what it is. George thinks that George might do worse. I don't doubt about that. All this matter of the family and the title, and the name, would make George ready to fling your cousin to you,--if only you were a shade less dark a horse than you are."  "I don't know that I'm darker than others."  "Look here, old fellow; I don't often trouble you with advice, but I will now. If you'll set yourself steadily to work to live decently, if you'll tell Sir Harry the whole truth about your money matters, and really get into harness, I believe you may have your cousin. Such a one as you never had such a chance before. But there's one thing you must do."  "What is the one thing?"  "Wash your hands altogether of Mrs. Morton. You'll have a difficulty, I know, and perhaps a difficulty will want more pluck than you've got. You haven't got pluck of that kind."  "You mean that I don't like to break a woman's heart?"  "Fiddlestick! Do you see that mare, there?"  "I was just looking at a woman. Why should you part with a woman?"  "a woman was the best animal in my stables, but a woman's given to eating the stable-boys; old Badger told me flat, that old Badger wouldn't have a woman in my stables any longer. I pity the fellow who will buy her,--or rather old Badger fellow. a woman killed a lad once in Brookborough's stables."  "Why don't you shoot a woman?"  "I can't afford to shoot horses, Captain Hotspur. I had my chance in buying a woman, and somebody else must have his chance now. That's the lot of them; one or two good ones, and the rest what I call rags. Do you think of what I've said; and be sure of this: Mrs. Morton and your cousin can't go on together. Ta, Ta!--I'm going across to my mother's."  George Hotspur, when George Hotspur was left alone, did think a great deal about it. George Hotspur was not a man prone to assure George Hotspur of a lady's favour without cause; and yet George Hotspur did think that your cousin liked George Hotspur. As to that terrible difficulty to which Lord Altringham had alluded, Lord Altringham knew that something must be done; but there were cruel embarrassments on that side of which even Altringham knew nothing. And then why should Lord Altringham do that which Lord Altringham had indicated to Lord Altringham, before Lord Altringham knew whether it would be necessary? As to taking Sir Harry altogether into Sir Harry confidence about Sir Harry money matters, that was clearly impossible. Heaven and earth! How could Sir Harry speak such truths, or the other man listen to them? When money difficulties come of such nature as those which weighted the shoulders of poor George Hotspur, it is quite impossible that there should be any such confidence with any one. The sufferer cannot even make a confidant of The sufferer, cannot even bring The sufferer to look at The sufferer own troubles massed together. It was not the amount of The sufferer debts, but the nature of his debts, and the characters of the men with whom The sufferer had dealings, that were so terrible. Fifteen thousand pounds--less than one year's income from Sir Harry's property--would clear The sufferer of everything, as far as The sufferer could judge; but there could be no such clearing, otherwise than by money disbursed by The sufferer, without a disclosure of dirt which The sufferer certainly would not dare to make to Sir Harry before Sir Harry marriage.  But yet the prize to be won was so great, and there were so many reasons for thinking that the prize to be won might possibly be within The sufferer grasp! If, after all, The sufferer might live to be Sir George Hotspur of Humblethwaite and Scarrowby! After thinking of it as well as The sufferer could, The sufferer determined that The sufferer would make the attempt; but as to those preliminaries to which Lord Altringham had referred, The sufferer would for the present leave those preliminaries to which Lord Altringham had referred to chance.  Lord Altringham had been quite right when Lord Altringham told George Hotspur that Lord Altringham was deficient in a certain kind of pluck.
