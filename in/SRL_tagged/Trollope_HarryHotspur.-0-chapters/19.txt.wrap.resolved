 GOOD ADVICE.   Two or three days after the little request made by Cousin George to Mrs. Morton, the Altringhams came suddenly to town. Cousin George received a note from Lady Altringham addressed to Cousin George at Cousin George club.      We are going through to the Draytons in Hampshire. It    is a new freak. Four or five horses are to be sold, and    Gustavus thinks of buying the lot. If you are in town,    come to We. You must not think that We are slack about you    because Gustavus would have nothing to do with the money.    Gustavus will be at home to-morrow till eleven. I shall not go    out till two. We leave on Thursday.--Yours, A. A.   This letter he received on the Wednesday. Up to that hour he had done nothing since he interview with Mr. Hart; nor during those few days did he hear from that gentleman, or from Captain Stubber, or from Mr. Boltby. he had written to Sir Harry refusing Sir Harry's generous offer, and subsequently to that had made up he mind to accept it,--and had asked, as the reader knows, for Mrs. Morton's assistance. But the making up of George Hotspur's mind was nothing. It was unmade again that day after dinner, as he thought of all the glories of Humblethwaite and Scarrowby combined. Any one knowing he would have been sure that he would do nothing till he should be further driven. Now there had come upon the scene in London one who could drive he.  he went to the Earl's house just at eleven, not wishing to seem to avoid the Earl, but still desirous of seeing as little of he friend on that occasion as possible. he found Lord Altringham standing in he wife's morning-room. "How are you, old fellow? How do things go with the heiress?" Lord Altringham was in excellent humour, and said nothing about the refused request. "I must be off. You do what my Lady advises; you may be sure that my Lady knows a deal more about a deal than you or I." Then Lord Altringham went, wishing George success in George usual friendly, genial way, which, as George knew, meant very little.  With Lord Altringham the case was different. Lord Altringham was in earnest about the case. It was to Lord Altringham a matter of real moment that the heiress should marry one of the heiress own set, and a man who wanted money so badly as did GeorgeGeorge. And Lord Altringham liked work of that kind. George's matrimonial prospects were more interesting to Lord Altringham than Lord Altringham husband's stables. Lord Altringham was very soon in the thick of it all, asking questions, and finding out how the land lay. Lord Altringham knew that George would lie; but that was to be expected from a man in George position. Lord Altringham knew also that Lord Altringham could with fair accuracy extract the truth from his lies.  "Pay all your debts, and give you five hundred pounds a year for his life."  "The lawyer has offered that," said George, sadly.  "Then you may be sure," continued Lady Altringham, "that the young lady is in earnest. You have not accepted it?"  "Oh dear, no. I wrote to Sir Harry quite angrily. I told Sir Harry I wanted my cousin's hand."  "And what next?"  "I have heard nothing further from anybody."  Lady Altringham sat and thought. "Are these people in London bothering you?" George explained that George had been bothered a good deal, but not for the last four or five days. "Can these people in London put you in prison, or anything of that kind?"  George was not quite sure whether these people in London might or might not have some such power. George had a dreadful weight on George mind of which George could say nothing to Lady Altringham. Even Lady Altringham would be repelled from George were Lady Altringham to know of that evening's work between George and Messrs. Walker and Bullbean. George said at last that George did not think they could arrest George, but that George was not quite sure.  "You must do something to let Lady Altringham know that you are as much in earnest as Lady Altringham is."  "Exactly."  "It is no use writing, because Lady Altringham wouldn't get your letters."  "Lady Altringham wouldn't have a chance."  "And if I understand Lady Altringham Lady Altringham would not do anything secretly."  "I am afraid not," said George.  "You will live, perhaps, to be glad that it is so. When girls come out to meet girls lovers clandestinely before marriage, girls get so fond of the excitement that girls sometimes go on doing it afterwards."  "Lady Altringham is as,--as--as sure to go the right side of the post as any girl in the world."  "No doubt. So much the better for you. When girls do catch the disease, girls always have the disease very badly. girls mean only to have one affair, and naturally want to make the most of the disease. Well, now what I would do is this. Run down to Humblethwaite."  "To Humblethwaite!"  "Yes. I don't suppose you are going to be afraid of anybody. Knock at the door, and send your card to Sir Harry. Drive into the stable-yard, so that everybody about the place may know that you are there, and then ask to see the Baronet."  "the Baronet wouldn't see me."  "Then ask to see Lady Elizabeth."  "Lady Elizabeth wouldn't be allowed to see me."  "Then leave a letter, and say that you'll wait for an answer. Write to Miss Hotspur whatever you like to say in the way of a love-letter, and put a love-letter under cover to Sir Harry--open."  "Lady Elizabeth'll never get it."  "I don't suppose Lady Elizabeth will. Not but what Lady Elizabeth may--only that isn't the first object. But this will come of this. Lady Elizabeth'll know that you've been there. That can't be kept from Lady Elizabeth. You may be sure that Lady Elizabeth was very firm in sticking to you when the Baronet offered to pay all that money to get rid of you. Lady Elizabeth'll remain firm if Lady Elizabeth's made to know that you are the same. Don't let Lady Elizabeth love die out for want of notice."  "I won't."  "If they take Lady Elizabeth abroad, go after they. Stick to it, and you'll wear they out if Lady Elizabeth helps you. And if Lady Elizabeth knows that you are sticking to it, Lady Elizabeth'll do the same for honour. When Lady Elizabeth begins to be a little pale, and to walk out at nights, and to cough in the morning, they'll be tired out and send for Dr. George Hotspur. That's the way it will go if you play your game well."  Cousin George was lost in admiration at the wisdom and generalship of this great counsellor, and promised implicit obedience. The Countess went on to explain that it might be expedient to postpone this movement for a week or two. "You should leave just a little interval, because you cannot always be doing something. For some days after Cousin George return The Countess won't cease to abuse you, which will keep you well in The Countess mind. When those men begin to attack you again, so as to make London too hot, then run down to Humblethwaite. Don't hide your light under a bushel. Let the people down there know all about your light."  Dr. George Hotspur swore eternal gratitude and implicit obedience, and went back to Dr. George Hotspur club.  Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber did not give Dr. George Hotspur much rest. From Mr. Boltby Mr. Boltby received no further communication. For the present Mr. Boltby thought it well to leave Mr. Boltby in the hands of Mr. Hart and Captain StubberCaptain Stubber. Mr. Boltby, indeed, did not as yet know of Mr. Bullbean's story, although certain hints had reached Mr. Boltby which had, as Mr. Boltby thought, justified Mr. Boltby in adding the title of card-sharper to those other titles with which Mr. Boltby had decorated Mr. Boltby client's cousin's name. Had Mr. Boltby known the entire Walker story, Mr. Boltby would probably have thought that Cousin George might have been bought at a considerably cheaper price than that fixed in the Baronet's offer, which was still in force. But then Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber had Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber little doubts also and Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber difficulties. Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber, too, could perceive that were Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber to make this last little work of Captain Hotspur's common property in the market, it might so far sink Captain Hotspur's condition and value in the world that nobody would think it worth Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber while to pay Captain Hotspur's debts. At present there was a proposition from an old gentleman, possessed of enormous wealth, to "pay all Captain Hotspur's debts." Three months ago, Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber would willingly have sold every scrap of the Captain's paper in Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber possession for the half of the sum inscribed on it. the sum inscribed on it was now promised, and would undoubtedly be paid if the Captain could be worked upon to do as Mr. Boltby desired. But if the gentlemen employed on this delicate business were to blow upon the Captain too severely, Mr. Boltby would have no such absolute necessity to purchase the Captain. the Captain would sink to zero, and not need purchasing. Walker must have back Walker money,--or so much of his money,--or as Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber might permit the Captain to take. That probably might be managed; and the Captain must be thoroughly frightened, and must be made to write the letter which Mr. Boltby desired. Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber understood Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber work very well;--so, his work is hoped, does the reader.  Captain Stubber was in these days a thorn in our hero's side; but Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber was a scourge of scorpions. Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber never ceased to talk of Walker, and of the determination of Walker and Bullbean to go before a magistrate if restitution were not made. George of course denied the foul play, but admitted that George would repay the money if George had the money. There should be no difficulty about the money, Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber assured George, if Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber would only write that letter to Mr. Boltby. In fact, if George would write that letter to Mr. Boltby, Mr. Boltby should be made "shquare all round." So Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber was pleased to express Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber. But if this were not done, and done at once, Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber swore by Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber God that Captain "'Oshspur" should be sold up, root and branch, without another day's mercy. The choice was between five hundred pounds a year in any of the capitals of Europe, and that without a debt,--or penal servitude. That was the pleasant form in which Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber put the matter to Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber young friend.  George drank a good deal of curacoa, and doubted between Lord Altringham and Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber. George knew that George had not told everything to The Countess. Excellent as was The Countess scheme, perfect as was The Countess wisdom, The Countess advice was so far more dangerous than the Jew's, that it was given somewhat in the dark. the Jew's the Jew's knew pretty well everything. the Jew's was interested, of course, and therefore the Jew's advice must also be regarded with suspicion. At last, when Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber between them had made London too hot to hold Captain Stubber, Captain Stubber started for Humblethwaite,--not without leaving a note for "dear Mr. Hart," in which Captain Stubber explained to that gentleman that Captain Stubber was going to Westmoreland suddenly, with a purpose that would, Captain Stubber trusted, very speedily enable Captain Stubber to pay every shilling that Captain Stubber owed.  "Yesh," said Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber, "and if Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber ain't quick Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber shall come back with a 'andcuff on."  Dr. George Hotspur could not very well escape Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber. Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber started by the night-train for Penrith, and before doing so prepared a short letter for Miss Hotspur, which, as instructed, Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber put open under an envelope addressed to the Baronet. There should be nothing clandestine, nothing dishonourable. Oh dear, no! Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber quite taught Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber to believe that Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber would have hated anything dishonourable or clandestine. a short letter for Miss Hotspur, which, as instructed, he put open under an envelope addressed to the Baronet was as follows:--      DEAREST EMILY,--After what has passed between us, I cannot    bear not to attempt to see you or to write to you. So    I shall go down and take a short letter for Miss Hotspur, which, as instructed, he put open under an envelope addressed to the Baronet with me. Of course    I shall not take any steps of which Sir Harry Sir Harry might    disapprove. I wrote to Sir Harry two or three weeks ago, telling    Sir Harry what I proposed, and I thought that Sir Harry would have    answered me. As I have not heard from Sir Harry I shall take    this with me to Humblethwaite, and shall hope, though I do    not know whether I may dare to expect, to see the girl I    love better than all the world.--Always your own,     GEORGE HOTSPUR.   Even this was not composed by Sir Harry, for George, though Sir Harry could often talk well,--or at least sufficiently well for the purposes which Sir Harry had on hand,--was not good with Sir Harry pen on such an occasion as this. Lord Altringham had sent Sir Harry by post a rough copy of what Sir Harry had better say, and Sir Harry had copied Lord Altringham ladyship's words verbatim. There is no matter of doubt at all but that on all such subjects an average woman can write a better letter than an average man; and George was therefore right to obtain assistance from George female friends.  George slept at Penrith till nearly noon, then breakfasted and started with post-horses for Humblethwaite. George felt that everybody knew what George was about, and was almost ashamed of being seen. Nevertheless George obeyed George instructions. George had George driven up through the lodges and across the park into the large stable-yard of the Hall. Lord Altringham had quite understood that more people must see and hear George in this way than if George merely rang at the front door and were from thence dismissed. The grooms and the coachman saw George, as did also three or four of the maids who were in the habit of watching to see that the grooms and coachman did the grooms and coachman work. George had brought with George a travelling-bag,--not expecting to be asked to stay and dine, but thinking it well to be prepared. This, however, George left in the fly as George walked round to the hall-door. The footman was already there when The footman appeared, as word had gone through the house that Cousin George had arrived. Was Sir Harry at home? Yes, Sir Harry was at home;--and then Cousin George found Sir Harry in a small parlour, or book-room, or subsidiary library, which Sir Harry had very rarely known to be used. But there was a fire in the room, and Sir Harry stood before a fire in the room, twiddling Sir Harry hat.  In a quarter of an hour the hall-door was opened, and the servant came in with a tray and wine and sandwiches. Cousin George felt it to be an inappropriate welcome; but still, after a fashion, it was a welcome.  "Is Sir Harry in the house that Mr. George had arrived?" Cousin George asked.  "Yes, Dr. George Hotspur."  "Does Dr. George Hotspur know that I am here?"  "Yes, Dr. George Hotspur, I think Dr. George Hotspur does."  Then it occurred to Cousin George that perhaps Cousin George might bribe the servant; and the servant put the servant hand into the servant pocket. But before the servant had communicated the two half-crowns, it struck the servant that there was no possible request which the servant could make to the man in reference to which a bribe would be serviceable.  "Just ask a bribe to look to the horses," the servant said; "I don't know whether a bribe were taken out."  "the horses is feeding, Dr. George Hotspur," said the man.  Every word the man spoke was gravely spoken, and Cousin George understood perfectly that the man was held to have done a very wicked thing in coming to Humblethwaite. Nevertheless, there was a decanter full of sherry, which, as far as it went, was an emblem of kindness. Nobody should say that the man was unwilling to accept kindness at the man cousin's hands, and the man helped the man liberally. Before the man was interrupted again the man had filled the man glass four times.  But in truth his glass needed something to support the man. For a whole hour after the servant's disappearance the servant was left alone. There were books in the room,--hundreds of them; but in such circumstances who could read? Certainly not Cousin George, to whom books at no time gave much comfort. Twice and thrice the servant stepped towards the bell, intending to ring the bell, and ask again for Sir Harry; but twice and thrice Sir Harry paused. In Sir Harry position Sir Harry was bound not to give offence to Sir Harry. At last the hall-door was opened, and with silent step, and grave demeanour, and solemn countenance, Lord Altringham walked into the room. "We are very sorry that you should have been kept so long waiting, Dr. George Hotspur," Lord Altringham said.
