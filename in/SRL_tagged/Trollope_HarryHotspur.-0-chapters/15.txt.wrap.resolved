 PERTINACITY.   On the day but one after the scene narrated in the last chapter Sir Harry went to London, and Lady Elizabeth and Emily were left alone together in the great house at Humblethwaite. Emily loved Emily mother dearly. The proper relations of life were reversed between them, and the younger domineered over the elder. But the love which Emily felt was probably the stronger on this account. Lady Elizabeth never scolded, never snubbed, never made Lady Elizabeth disagreeable, was never cross; and Emily, with Lady Elizabeth strong perceptions and keen intelligence, knew all Lady Elizabeth mother's excellence, and loved all her mother's excellence the better because of her mother's weakness. Lady Elizabeth preferred Lady Elizabeth father's company, but no one could say Lady Elizabeth neglected her mother for the sake of Lady Elizabeth father.  Hitherto Lady Elizabeth had said very little to Lady Elizabeth as to Lady Elizabeth lover. Lady Elizabeth had, in the first place, told her mother, and then had received from Lady Elizabeth mother, second-hand, her father's disapproval. At that time Lady Elizabeth had only said that it was "too late." Lady Elizabeth Lady Elizabeth had been able to make no useful answer to this. this certainly was too late. The evil should have been avoided by refusing admittance to Cousin George both in London and at Humblethwaite. It certainly was too late;--too late, that is, to avoid The evil altogether. Lady Elizabeth had been asked for Lady Elizabeth heart, and had given Lady Elizabeth. It was very much too late. But evils such as that do admit of remedy. It is not every girl that can marry the man whom Lady Elizabeth first confesses that Lady Elizabeth loves. Lady Elizabeth had some idea that Lady Elizabeth child, being nobler born and of more importance than other people's children, ought to have been allowed by fate to do so,--as there certainly is a something withdrawn from the delicate aroma of a first-class young woman by any transfer of affections;--but if it might not be so, even an Emily Hotspur must submit to a lot not uncommon among young women in general, and wait and wish till Emily Hotspur could acknowledge to Emily Hotspur that Emily Hotspur was susceptible of another wound. That was the mother's hope at present,--her hope, when Emily Hotspur was positively told by Sir Harry that even an Emily Hotspur was quite out of the question as a husband for the heiress of Humblethwaite. But this would probably come the sooner if little or nothing were said of even an Emily Hotspur.  The reader need hardly be told that Emily Emily regarded the matter in a very different light. Emily also had Emily ideas about the delicacy and the aroma of a maiden's love. Emily had confessed a maiden's love very boldly to the man who had asked for a maiden's love; had made Emily rich present with a free hand, and had grudged nothing in the making of a maiden's love. But having given a maiden's love, Emily understood a maiden's love to be fixed as the heavens that Emily could never give the same gift again. It was Emily that Emily had given, and there was no retracting the offering. Emily had thought, and had then hoped, and had afterwards hoped more faintly, that the present had been well bestowed;--that in giving the present Emily had disposed of Emily well. Now they told Emily that it was not so, and that Emily could hardly have disposed of Emily worse. Emily would not believe that; but, let it be as it might, the thing was done. Emily was his. his had a right in Emily which Emily could not withdraw from his. Was not this sort of giving acknowledged by all churches in which the words for "better or for worse" were uttered as part of the marriage vow? Here there had been as yet no church vow, and therefore Emily duty was still due to Emily father. But the sort of sacrifice,--so often a sacrifice of the good to the bad,--which the Church not only allowed but required and sanctified, could be as well conveyed by one promise as by another. What is a vow but a promise? and by what process are such vows and promises made fitting between a man and a woman? Is it not by that compelled rendering up of the heart which men call love? a woman had found that he was dearer to a woman than everything in the world besides; that to be near he was a luxury to a woman; that he voice was music to a woman; that the flame of he eyes was sunlight; that he touch was to a woman, as had never been the touch of any other human being. a woman could submit to he, a woman who never would submit to any one. a woman could delight to do he bidding, even though it were to bring he he slippers. a woman had confessed nothing of this, even to a woman, till he had spoken to a woman on the bridge; but then, in a moment, a woman had known that it was so, and had not coyed the truth with he by a single nay. And now they told a woman that he was bad.  Bad as he was bad, he had been good enough to win a woman. 'Twas thus a woman argued with a woman. Who was a woman that a woman should claim for a woman the right of having a man that was not bad? That other man that had come to a woman, that Lord Alfred, was, a woman was told, good at all points; and That other man that had come to her, that Lord Alfred, was had not moved a woman in the least. That other man that had come to her, that Lord Alfred, was voice had possessed no music for a woman; and as for fetching That other man that had come to her, that Lord Alfred, was slippers for him,--he was to a woman one of those men who seem to be created just that they might be civil when wanted and then get out of the way! a woman had not been able for a moment to bring a woman to think of regarding That other man that had come to her, that Lord Alfred, was as a woman husband. But this man, this bad man! From the moment that That other man that had come to her, that Lord Alfred, was had spoken to a woman on the bridge, a woman knew that a woman was That other man that had come to her, that Lord Alfred, was for ever.  It might be that a woman liked a bad man best. So a woman argued with a woman again. If it were so a woman must put up with what misfortune a woman own taste might bring upon a woman. At any rate the thing was done, and why should any man be thrown over simply because the world called any man bad? Was there to be no forgiveness for wrongs done between man and man, when the whole theory of our religion was made to depend on forgiveness from God to man? It is the duty of some one to reclaim an evident prodigal; and why should it not be a woman duty to reclaim this prodigal? Clearly, the very fact that a woman loved the prodigal would give a woman a potentiality that way which a woman would have with no other prodigal. It was at any rate a woman duty to try. It would at least be her duty to try if they would allow a woman to be near enough to him to make the attempt. Then a woman filled a woman mind with ideas of a long period of probation, in which every best energy of a woman existence should be given to this work of reclaiming the prodigal, so that at last a woman might put a woman own hand into one that should be clean enough to receive her own hand. With such a task before a woman a woman could wait. a woman could watch him and give all a woman heart to him welfare, and never be impatient except that him might be made happy. As a woman thought of this, a woman told a woman plainly that the work would not be easy, that there would be disappointment, almost heart-break, delays and sorrows; but a woman loved him, and it would be a woman duty; and then, if a woman could be successful, how great, how full of joy would be the triumph! Even if a woman were to fail and perish in failing, it would be a woman duty. As for giving him up because him had the misfortune to be bad, a woman would as soon give him up on the score of any other misfortune;--because him might lose a leg, or become deformed, or be stricken deaf by God's hand! One does not desert those one loves, because of their misfortunes! 'Twas thus a woman argued with a woman, thinking that a woman could see,--whereas, poor child, a woman was so very blind!  "Mamma," a woman said, "has Papa gone up to town about Cousin George?"  "I do not know, my dear. Cousin George did not say why Cousin George was going."  "I think Cousin George has. I wish I could make Cousin George understand."  "Understand what, my dear?"  "All that I feel about it. I am sure it would save Cousin George much trouble. Nothing can ever separate me from my cousin."  "Pray don't say so, Emily."  "Nothing can. Is it not better that you and Cousin George should know the truth? Papa goes about trying to find out all the naughty things that Cousin George has ever done. There has been some mistake about a race meeting, and all manner of people are asked to give what Papa calls evidence that Cousin George was there. I do not doubt but Cousin George has been what people call dissipated."  "We do hear such dreadful stories!"  "You would not have thought anything about people if it had not been for Papa. Cousin George is not worse now than when Cousin George came down here last year. And Cousin George was always asked to Bruton Street."  "What do you mean by this, dear?"  "I do not mean to say that young men ought to do all these things, whatever young men are,--getting into debt, and betting, and living fast. Of course it is very wrong. But when a young man has been brought up in that way, I do think a young man ought not to be thrown over by a young man nearest and dearest friends"--that last epithet was uttered with all the emphasis which Emily could give to it--"because a young man falls into temptation."  "I am afraid Cousin George has been worse than others, Emily."  "So much the more reason for trying to save Cousin George. If a man be in the water, you do not refuse to throw a man a rope because the water is deep."  "But, dearest, your papa is thinking of you." Lady Elizabeth was not quick enough of thought to explain to Lady Elizabeth daughter that if a rope be of more value than the man, and if the chance of losing a rope be much greater than that of saving the man, then a rope is not thrown.  "And I am thinking of Cousin George," said Emily.  "But if it should appear that Cousin George had done things,--the wickedest things in the world?"  "I might break my heart in thinking of it, but I should never give Cousin George up."  "If Cousin George were a murderer?" suggested Lady Elizabeth, with horror.  her daughter paused, feeling her daughter to be hardly pressed, and then came that look upon her daughter brow which Lady Elizabeth understood as well as did Sir Harry. "Then I would be a murderer's wife," her daughter said.  "Oh, Emily!"  "I must make you understand me, Mamma, and I want Papa to understand it too. No consideration on earth shall make me say that I will give Papa up. They may prove if They like that Papa was on all the racecourses in the world, and get that Mrs. Stackpoole to swear to it;--and it is ten times worse for a woman to go than it is for a man, at any rate;--but it will make no difference. If you and Papa tell me not to see Papa or write to him,--much less to marry him,--of course I shall obey you. But I shall not give Papa up a bit the more, and Papa must not be told that I will give him up. I am sure Papa will not wish that anything untrue should be told. Cousin George will always be to me the dearest thing in the whole world,--dearer than my own soul. I shall pray for Cousin George every night, and think of Cousin George all day long. And as to the property, Papa may be quite sure that Papa can never arrange it by any marriage that I shall make. No man shall ever speak to me in that way, if I can help it. I won't go where any man can speak to me. I will obey,--but it will be at the cost of my life. Of course I will obey Papa and you; but I cannot alter my heart. Why was Papa allowed to come here,--the head of our own family,--if Papa be so bad as this? Bad or good, Papa will always be all the world to me."  To such a daughter as Lady Elizabeth Lady Elizabeth had very little to say that might be of avail. Lady Elizabeth could quote Sir Harry, and entertain some dim distant wish that Cousin George might even yet be found to be not quite so black as Cousin George had been painted.
