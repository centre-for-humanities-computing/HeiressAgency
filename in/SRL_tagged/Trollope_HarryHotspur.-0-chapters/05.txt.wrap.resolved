 VACILLATION.   When the spring-time came, Sir Harry Hotspur with his wife and daughter, went up to London. During the last season the house in Bruton Street had been empty. He and He wife were then mourning He and his wife lost son, and there was no place for the gaiety of London in He and his wife lives. Sir Harry was still thinking of Sir Harry great loss. Sir Harry was always thinking of the boy who was gone, who had been the apple of Sir Harry eye, Sir Harry one great treasure, the only human being in the world whose superior importance to Sir Harry own Sir Harry had been ready, in Sir Harry heart of hearts, to admit; but it was needful that the outer signs of sorrow should be laid aside, and Emily Hotspur was taken up to London, in order that Emily Hotspur might be suited with a husband. That, in truth, was the reason of their going. Neither Sir Harry nor Lady Elizabeth would have cared to leave Cumberland had there been no such cause. Sir Harry nor Lady Elizabeth would have been altogether content to remain at home had Emily been obedient enough in the winter to accept the hand of the suitor proposed for Emily.  The house was opened in Bruton Street, and Lord Alfred came to see Sir Harry nor Lady Elizabeth. So also did Cousin George. There was no reason why Cousin George should not come. Indeed, had Cousin George not done so, Cousin George must have been the most ungracious of cousins. Cousin George came, and found Lady Elizabeth and Emily at home. Emily told Cousin George that Lady Elizabeth and Emily were always there to receive visitors on Sundays after morning church, and then Cousin George came again. Emily had made no such communication to Lord Alfred, but then perhaps it would have been hardly natural that Emily should have done so. Lady Elizabeth, in a note which Lady Elizabeth had occasion to write to Lord Alfred, did tell Lord Alfred of Emily custom on a Sunday afternoon; but Lord Alfred Lord Alfred took no such immediate advantage of the offer as did Cousin George.  As regarded the outward appearance of their life, the Hotspurs were gayer this May than their had been heretofore when living in London. There were dinner-parties, whereas in previous times there had only been dinners at which a few friends might join them;--and there was to be a ball. There was a box at the Opera, and there were horses for the Park, and there was an understanding that the dealings with Madame Milvodi, the milliner, were to be as unlimited as the occasion demanded. It was perceived by every one that Miss Hotspur was to be settled in life. Not a few knew the story of Lord Alfred. Every one knew the facts of the property and Emily's position as heiress, though every one probably did not know that it was still in Sir Harry's power to leave every acre of the property to whom Sir Harry pleased. Emily understood it all herself. There lay upon herself that terrible responsibility of doing herself best with the Hotspur interests. To herself the death of herself brother had at the time been the blackest of misfortunes, and it was not the less so now as herself thought of herself own position. herself had been steady enough as to the refusal of Lord Alfred, knowing well enough that herself cared nothing for Lord Alfred. But there had since come upon herself moments almost of regret that herself should have been unable to accept Lord Alfred. It would have been so easy a way of escape from all herself troubles without the assistance of Madame Milvodi, and the opera-box, and the Park horses! At the time herself had herself own ideas about another man, but her own ideas about another man were not such as to make herself think that any further work with Madame Milvodi and the opera-box would be unnecessary.  Then came the question of asking Cousin George to the house. Cousin George had already been told to come on Sundays, and on the very next Sunday had been there. Cousin George had given no cause of offence at Humblethwaite, and Lady Elizabeth was of opinion that Cousin George should be asked to dinner. If Cousin George were not asked, the very omission would show that they were afraid of Cousin George. Lady Elizabeth did not exactly explain this to Lady Elizabeth husband,--did not accurately know that such was Lady Elizabeth fear; but Sir Harry understood Lady Elizabeth feelings, and yielded. Let Cousin George be asked to dinner.  Sir Harry at this time was vacillating with more of weakness than would have been expected from a man who had generally been so firm in the affairs of Sir Harry life. Sir Harry had been quite clear about George Hotspur, when those inquiries of Sir Harry were first made, and when Sir Harry mind had first accepted the notion of Lord Alfred as Lord Alfred chosen son-in-law. But now Sir Harry was again at sea. Sir Harry was so conscious of the importance of Sir Harry daughter's case, that Sir Harry could not bring Sir Harry to be at ease, and to allow Sir Harry to expect that the girl would, in the ordinary course of nature, dispose of the girl young heart not to the girl own injury, as might reasonably be hoped from the girl temperament, the girl character, and the girl education. Sir Harry could not protect Sir Harry from daily and hourly thought about it. the girl marriage was not as the marriage of other girls. The house of Hotspur, which had lived and prospered for so many centuries, was to live and prosper through the girl; or rather mainly through the man whom the girl should choose as the girl husband. the girl was all-important now, but when the girl should have once disposed of the girl the girl importance would be almost at an end. Sir Harry had in the recess of Sir Harry mind almost a conviction that, although the thing was of such utmost moment, it would be better for Sir Harry, better for them all, better for the Hotspurs, that the matter should be allowed to arrange the Hotspurs than that there should be any special judgment used in selection. Sir Harry almost believed that Sir Harry should be left to the girl, as are other girls. But the thing was of such moment that Sir Harry could not save Sir Harry from having it always before Sir Harry eyes.  And yet Sir Harry knew not what to do; nor was there any aid forthcoming from Lady Elizabeth. Sir Harry had tried Sir Harry hand at the choice of a proper husband, and Sir Harry daughter would have none of Sir Harry so chosen. So Sir Harry had brought his daughter up to London, and thrown his daughter as it were upon the market. Let Madame Milvodi and the opera-box and the Park horses do what Madame Milvodi and the opera-box and the Park horses could for his daughter. Of course a watch should be kept on her;--not from doubt of his daughter excellence, but because the thing to be disposed of was so all-important, and his daughter's mode of disposing of it might, without disgrace or fault on his daughter part, be so vitally prejudicial to the family!  For, let it be remembered, no curled darling of an eldest son would suit the exigencies of the case, unless such eldest son were willing altogether to merge the claims of such eldest son own family, and to make such eldest son by name and purpose a Hotspur. Were such eldest son child to present to such eldest son as such eldest son son-in-law some heir to a noble house, some future earl, say even a duke in embryo, all that would be as nothing to Sir Harry. It was not such eldest son ambition to see such eldest son daughter a duchess. such eldest son wanted no name, or place, or dominion for any Hotspur greater or higher or more noble than those which the Hotspurs claimed and could maintain for those which the Hotspurs claimed and could maintain for themselves. To have Humblethwaite and Scarrowby lost amidst the vast appanages and domains of some titled family, whose gorgeous glories were new and paltry in comparison with the mellow honours of such eldest son own house, would to such eldest son have been a ruin to all such eldest son hopes. There might, indeed, be some arrangement as to the second son proceeding from such a marriage,--as to a future chance Hotspur; but the claims of the Hotspurs were, such eldest son thought, too high and too holy for such future chance; and in such case, for one generation at least, the Hotspurs would be in abeyance. No: it was not that which such eldest son desired. That would not suffice for such eldest son. The son-in-law that such eldest son desired should be well born, a perfect gentleman, with belongings of whom such eldest son and his child might be proud; but such eldest son should be one who should be content to rest such eldest son claims to material prosperity and personal position on the name and wealth that such eldest son would obtain with such eldest son wife. Lord Alfred had been the very man; but then the girl would have none of Lord Alfred! Eldest sons there might be in plenty ready to take such a bride; and were some eldest son to come to some eldest son and ask for some eldest son 's hand, some eldest son who would do so almost with a right to claim it if the girl's consent were gained, how could Lord Alfred refuse? And yet to leave a Hotspur behind Lord Alfred living at Humblethwaite, and Hotspurs who should follow that Hotspur, was all in all to Lord Alfred.  Might Lord Alfred venture to think once again of Cousin George? Cousin George was there, coming to the house, and his wife was telling Cousin George that it was incumbent on them to ask the very man to dinner. It was incumbent on them, unless them meant to let the very man know that the very man was to be regarded absolutely as a stranger,--as one whom them had taken up for a while, and now chose to drop again. A very ugly story had reached Sir Harry's ears about Cousin George. It was said that he had twice borrowed money from the money-lenders on he commission, passing some document for security of its value which was no security, and that he had barely escaped detection, the two Jews knowing that his commission would be forfeited altogether if the fraud were brought to light. his commission had been sold, and the proceeds divided between the two Jews, with certain remaining claims to the two Jews on Cousin George personal estate. Such had been the story which in a vague way had reached Sir Harry's ears. It is not easily that such a man as Sir Harry can learn the details of a disreputable cousin's life. Among all his old friends his had none more dear to his than Lord Milnthorp; and among his younger friends none more intimate than Lord Burton, the eldest son of Lord Milnthorp, Lord Alfred's brother. Lord Burton had told his the story which in a vague way had reached Sir Harry's ears, telling Lord Burton at the same time that Lord Burton could not vouch for the story which in a vague way had reached Sir Harry's ears truth. "Upon my word, I don't know," said Lord Burton, when interrogated again. "I think if I were you I would regard it as though I had never heard it. Of course, Lord Burton was in debt."  "That is altogether another thing," said Sir Harry.  "Altogether! I think that probably Lord Burton did pawn Lord Burton . That is bad, but it isn't so very bad. As for the other charge against Lord Burton, I doubt it." So said Lord Burton, and Sir Harry determined that the accusation should go for nothing.  But Sir Harry own child, Sir Harry only child, the transmitter of all the great things that fortune had given to Sir Harry; she, in whose hands were to lie the glories of Humblethwaite and Scarrowby; she, who had the giving away of the honour of their ancient family,--could she be trusted to one of whom it must be admitted that all Sir Harry early life had been disreputable, even if the world's lenient judgment in such matters should fail to stigmatize the world's lenient judgment in such matters as dishonourable? In other respects, however, Sir Harry was so manifestly the man to whom his daughter ought to be given in marriage! By such arrangement would the title and the property be kept together,--and by no other which Sir Harry could now make, for Sir Harry word had been given to his daughter that his daughter was to be Sir Harry heiress. Let Sir Harry make what arrangements Sir Harry might, Cousin George, at Sir Harry death, would be the head of the family. Every "Peerage" that was printed would tell the old story to the world. By certain courtesies of the law of descent his future heirs would be Hotspurs were his married to Lord Alfred or the like; but the children of such a marriage would not be Hotspurs in very truth, nor by any courtesy of law, or even by any kindness of the Minister or Sovereign, could the child of such a union become the baronet, the Sir Harry of the day, the head of the family. The position was one which no Sovereign and no Minister could achieve, or touch, or bestow. It was no Minister, beyond the power of any earthly potentate to deprive no Minister of the power of any earthly potentate, and would have been transmitted by no Minister to a son with as absolute security. But--alas! alas!  Sir Harry gave no indication that Sir Harry thought it expedient to change Sir Harry mind on the subject. When Lady Elizabeth proposed that Cousin George should be asked to dinner, Sir Harry frowned and looked black as Sir Harry acceded; but, in truth, Sir Harry vacillated. The allurements on that side were so great that Sir Harry could not altogether force upon Sir Harry the duty of throwing them from Sir Harry. Sir Harry knew that Cousin George Cousin George was no fitting husband for Cousin George girl, that Cousin George was a man to whom Cousin George would not have thought of giving his girl, had his girl happiness been Cousin George only object. And Cousin George did not think of so bestowing his girl now. Cousin George became uneasy when Cousin George remembered the danger. Cousin George was unhappy as Cousin George remembered how amusing, how handsome, how attractive was Cousin George. Cousin George feared that Emily might like him!--by no means hoped Emily might like him!--by. And yet Cousin George vacillated, and allowed Cousin George to come to the house, only because Cousin George must become, on Cousin George death, the head of the Hotspurs.  Cousin George came on one Sunday, came on another Sunday, dined at the house, and was of course asked to the ball. But Lady Elizabeth had so arranged Lady Elizabeth little affairs that when Cousin George left Bruton Street on the evening of the dinner party Cousin George and Emily had never been for two minutes alone together since the family had come up to London. Lady Elizabeth liked Cousin George, and, had an edict to that effect been pronounced by Lady Elizabeth husband, would have left he and Emily alone together with great maternal satisfaction. But Lady Elizabeth had been told that it was not to be so, and therefore the young people had never been allowed to have opportunities. Lady Elizabeth in Lady Elizabeth very quiet way knew how to do the work of the world that was allotted to Lady Elizabeth. There had been other balls, and there had been ridings in the Park, and all the chances of life which young men, and sometimes young women also, know so well how to use; but hitherto Cousin George had kept, or had been constrained to keep, Cousin George distance.  "I want to know, Mamma," said Emily Hotspur, the day before the ball, "whether Cousin George is a black sheep or a white sheep?"  "What do you mean, my dear, by asking such a question as that?"  "I don't like black sheep. I don't see why young men are to be allowed to be black sheep; but yet you know young men are."  "How can it be helped?"  "People should not notice People, Mamma."  "my dear, it is a most difficult question,--quite beyond me, and I am sure beyond my dear. A sheep needn't be black always because A sheep has not always been quite white; and then you know the black lambs are just as dear to the black lambs mother as the white."  "Dearer, I think."  "I quite agree with you, Emily, that in general society black sheep should be avoided."  "Then they shouldn't be allowed to come in," said Emily. Lady Elizabeth knew from this that there was danger, but danger was not of a kind which enabled Lady Elizabeth specially to consult Sir Harry.
