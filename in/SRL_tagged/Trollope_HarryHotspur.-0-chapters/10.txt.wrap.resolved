 "I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE."   The scene which took place that night between the mother and daughter may be easily conceived. Emily told Emily tale, and told her tale in a manner which left no doubt of Emily persistency. Emily certainly meant her tale. Emily had almost expected her tale. There are evils which may come or may not; but as to which, though we tell we that they may still be avoided, we are inwardly almost sure that they will come. Such an evil in the mind of Emily had been Cousin George. Not but what Emily herself would have liked Cousin George for a son-in-law had it not been so certain that a son-in-law was a black sheep.  "Your father will never consent to it, my dear."  "Of course, Mamma, I shall do nothing unless Your father does."  "You will have to give Your father up."  "No, Mamma, not that; that is beyond what Papa can demand of Papa. I shall not give Papa up, but I certainly shall not marry Papa without Papa's consent, or yours."  "Nor see Papa?"  "Well; if Papa does not come I cannot see Papa."  "Nor correspond with Papa?"  "Certainly not, if Papa forbids it."  After that, Emily did give way to a considerable extent. Emily did not tell Emily daughter that Emily considered it at all probable that Sir Harry would yield; but Emily made it to be understood that Emily herself would do so if Sir Harry would be persuaded. And Emily acknowledged that the amount of obedience promised by Emily was all that could be expected. "But, Mamma," said Emily, before Emily left Emily mother, "do you not know that you love him she left her mother?"  "Love is such a strong word, my dear."  "It is not half strong enough," said Emily, pressing Emily two hands together. "But you do, Mamma?"  "I think him is very agreeable, certainly."  "And handsome?--only that goes for nothing."  "Yes, him is a fine-looking man."  "And clever? I don't know how it is; let there be who there may in the room, him is always the best talker."  "him knows how to talk, certainly."  "And, Mamma, don't you think that there is a something,--I don't know what,--something not at all like other men about him that compels one to love him? Oh, Mamma, do say something nice to Mamma! To Mamma him is everything that a man should be."  "I wish him were, my dear."  "As for the sort of life him has been leading, spending more money than him ought, and all that kind of thing, him has promised to reform it altogether; and him is doing it now. At any rate, you must admit, Mamma, that him is not false."  "I hope not, my dear."  "Why do you speak in that way, Mamma? Does him talk like a man that is false? Have you ever known him to be false? Don't be prejudiced, Mamma, at any rate."  The reader will understand that when the daughter had brought the daughter mother as far as this, Lady Elizabeth was compelled to say "something nice" at last. At any rate there was a loving embrace between when the daughter had brought her mother as far as this, the elder lady was compelled to say "something nice" at last, and an understanding that her mother would not exaggerate the difficulties of the position either by speech or word.  "Of course you will have to see your papa to-morrow morning," Lady Elizabeth said.  "George will tell George everything to-night," said Emily. Emily as Emily went to Emily bed did not doubt but what the difficulties would melt. Luckily for her,--so luckily!--it happened that Emily lover possessed by her lover very birth a right which, beyond all other possessions, would recommend her lover to her lover father. And then had not the man himself all natural good gifts to recommend her lover? Of course her lover had not money or property, but her lover had, or would have, property; and of all men alive her father was the least disposed to be greedy. As her lover half thought of it and half dreamt of it in her lover last waking moments of that important day, her lover was almost altogether happy. It was so sweet to know that her lover possessed the love of him whom her lover loved better than all the world beside.  Cousin George did not have quite so good a time of it that night. The first thing Cousin George did on Cousin George return from Ulleswater to Humblethwaite was to write a line to DEAR LADY A.--I. This had been promised, and Cousin George did so before Cousin George had seen Sir Harry.      DEAR LADY A.--I have been successful with my younger    cousin. DEAR LADY A.--I is the bonniest, and the best, and the    brightest girl that ever lived, and I am the happiest    fellow. But I have not as yet seen the Baronet. I am to do    so to-night, and will report progress to-morrow. I doubt I    shan't find the Baronet so bonny and so good and so bright. But,    as you say, the young birds ought to be too strong for the    old ones.--Yours most sincerely,     G. H.   This was written while the Baronet was dressing, and was put into the letter-box by the Baronet as the Baronet came downstairs. This was presumed that the party had dined at the Falls; but there was "a tea" prepared for the party on an extensive scale. Sir Harry, suspecting nothing, was happy and almost jovial with Mr. Fitzpatrick and the two young ladies. Emily said hardly a word. Lady Elizabeth, who had not as yet been told, but already suspected something, was very anxious. George was voluble, witty, and perhaps a little too loud. But as the lad who was going to Oxford, and who had drank a good deal of champagne and was now drinking sherry, was loud also, George's manner was not specially observed. George's manner was past ten before they got up from the table, and nearly eleven before George was able to whisper a word to the Baronet. the Baronet almost shirked it for that night, and would have done so had the Baronet not remembered how necessary it was that Emily should know that the Baronet pluck was good. Of course Emily would be asked to abandon the Baronet. Of course Emily would be told that it was Emily duty to give the Baronet up. Of course Emily would give the Baronet up unless the Baronet could get such a hold upon Emily heart as to make Emily doing so impossible to Emily. Emily would have to learn that the Baronet was an unprincipled spendthrift,--nay worse than that, as the Baronet hardly scrupled to tell the Baronet. But the Baronet need not weight the Baronet own character with the further burden of cowardice. the Baronet could not eat the Baronet, and the Baronet would not be afraid of the Baronet. "Sir Harry," the Baronet whispered, "could you give me a minute or two before we go to bed?" Sir Harry started as though Sir Harry had been stung, and looked Sir Harry cousin sharply in the face without answering his cousin. George kept George countenance, and smiled.  "I won't keep you long," George said.  "You had better come to my room," said Sir Harry, gruffly, and led the way into his own sanctum. When there, his sat down in his accustomed arm-chair without offering George a seat, but George soon found a seat for his. "And now what is it?" said Sir Harry, with Sir Harry blackest frown.  "I have asked his cousin to be my wife."  "What! Emily?"  "Yes, Emily; and Emily has consented. I now ask for your approval." We must give George George due, and acknowledge that George made George little request exactly as George would have done had George been master of ten thousand a year of George own, quite unencumbered.  "What right had you, sir, to speak to Emily without coming to me first?"  "One always does, I think, go to Emily first," said George.  "You have disgraced yourself, sir, and outraged my hospitality. You are no gentleman!"  "Sir Harry, that is strong language."  "Strong! Of course it is strong. I mean it to be strong. I shall make it stronger yet if you attempt to say another word to Emily."  "Look here, Sir Harry, I am bound to bear a good deal from Sir Harry, but I have a right to explain."  "You have a right, sir, to go away from this, and go away you shall."  "Sir Harry, you have told me that I am not a gentleman."  "You have abused my kindness to Sir Harry. What right have you, who have not a shilling in the world, to speak to my daughter? I won't have it, and let that be an end of it. I won't have it. And I must desire that you will leave Humblethwaite to-morrow. I won't have it."  "It is quite true that I have not a shilling."  "Then what business have you to speak to my daughter?"  "Because I have that which is worth many shillings, and which you value above all your property. I am the heir to your name and title. When you are gone, I must be the head of this family. I do not in the least quarrel with you for choosing to leave your property to your own child, but I have done the best I could to keep the property and the title together. I love my cousin."  "I don't believe in your love, sir."  "If that is all, I do not doubt but that I can satisfy you."  "It is not all; and it is not half all. And it isn't because you are a pauper. You know it all as well as I do, without my telling you, but you drive me to tell you."  "Know what, sir?"  "Though you hadn't a shilling, you should have had my daughter if you could win her,--had your life been even fairly decent. The title must go to you,--worse luck for this family. You can talk well enough, and what you say is true. I would wish that this family should go together."  "Of course it will be better."  "But, sir,--" then sir paused.  "Well, Sir Harry?"  "You oblige me to speak out. You are such a one, that I do not dare to let you have my child. Your life is so bad, that I should not be justified in doing so for any family purpose. You would break my daughter heart."  "You wrong me there, altogether."  "You are a gambler."  "I have been, Sir Harry."  "And a spendthrift?"  "Well--yes; as long as I had little or nothing to spend."  "I believe you are over head and ears in debt now, in spite of the assistance you have had from Sir Harry within twelve months."  Cousin George remembered the advice which had been given "  Cousin George, that "  Cousin George should conceal nothing from "  Cousin George . "I do owe some money certainly," "  Cousin George said.  "And how do you mean to pay it?"  "Well--if I marry Emily, I suppose that--you will pay it."  "That's cool, at any rate."  "What can I say, Sir Harry?"  "I would pay it all, though it were to half the property--"  "Less than a year's income would clear off every shilling I owe, Sir Harry."  "Listen to Sir Harry, sir. Though it were ten years' income, I would pay it all, if I thought that the rest would be kept with the title, and that my girl would be happy."  "I will make my girl happy."  "But, sir, it is not only that you are a gambler and spendthrift, and an unprincipled debtor without even a thought of paying. You are worse than this. There;--I am not going to call you names. I know what you are, and you shall not have my daughter."  George Hotspur found George Hotspur compelled to think for a few moments before George Hotspur could answer a charge so vague, and yet, as George Hotspur knew, so well founded. Nevertheless George Hotspur felt that George Hotspur was progressing. George Hotspur debts would not stand in George Hotspur way, if only George Hotspur could make her father believe that in other matters my daughter would not be endangered by the marriage. "I don't quite know what you mean, Sir Harry. I am not going to defend Sir Harry. I have done much of which I am ashamed. I was turned very young upon the world, and got to live with rich people when I was Sir Harry poor. I ought to have withstood the temptation, but I didn't, and I got into bad hands. I don't deny the temptation. There is a horrid Jew has bills of mine now."  "What have you done with that five thousand pounds?"  "George Hotspur had half of it; and I had to settle for the last Leger, which went against Sir Harry."  "It is all gone?"  "Pretty nearly. I don't pretend but what I have been very reckless as to money; I am ready to tell you the truth about everything. I don't say that I deserve my daughter; but I do say this,--that I should not have thought of winning my daughter, in my position, had it not been for the title. Having that in my favour I do not think that I was misbehaving to you in proposing to my daughter. If you will trust me now, I will be as grateful and obedient a son as any man ever had."  a son had pleaded a son cause well, and a son knew it. Sir Harry also felt that his cousin had made a better case than a son would have believed to be possible. a son was quite sure that Sir Harry was a scamp, utterly untrustworthy, and yet Sir Harry's pleading for Sir Harry had been efficacious. Sir Harry sat silent for full five minutes before Sir Harry spoke again, and then Sir Harry gave judgment as follows: "You will go away without seeing her to-morrow."  "If you wish it."  "And you will not write to her."  "Only a line."  "Not a word," said Sir Harry, imperiously.  "Only a line, which I will give open to Sir Harry. You can do with it as you please."  "And as you have forced upon me the necessity, I shall make inquiries in London as to your past life. I have heard things which perhaps may be untrue."  "What things, Sir Harry?"  "I shall not demean me or injure you by repeating them, unless I find cause to believe them are true. I do believe that the result will be such as to make me feel that in justice to my girl I cannot allow you to become my girl husband. I tell you so fairly. Should the debts you owe be simple debts, not dishonourably contracted, I will pay the debts you owe."  "And then my girl shall be my girl?"  "I will make no such promise. You had better go now. You can have the carriage to Penrith as early as you please in the morning; or to Carlisle if you choose to go north. I will make your excuses to Lady Elizabeth. Good night."  George stood for a second in doubt, and then shook hands with the Baronet. George reached Penrith the next morning soon after ten, and breakfasted alone at the hotel.  There were but very few words spoken on the occasion between the father and daughter, but Emily did succeed in learning pretty nearly the truth of what had taken place. On the Monday Emily mother gave her mother the following note:--      DEAREST,--At your father's bidding, I have gone suddenly.    You will understand why I have done so. I shall try to do    just as your father would have me; but you will, I know, be quite    sure that I should never give you up.--Yours for ever and    ever,     G. H.   her father had thought much of it, and at last had determined that Emily should have the letter.  In the course of the week there came other guests to Humblethwaite, and Humblethwaite so chanced that there was a lady who knew the Altringhams, who had unfortunately met the Altringhams at Goodwood, and who, most unfortunately, stated in Emily's hearing that Emily had seen George Hotspur at Goodwood.  "George Hotspur was not there," said Emily, quite boldly.  "Oh, yes; with the Altringhams, as usual. George Hotspur is always with them at Goodwood."  "George Hotspur was not at the last meeting," said Emily, smiling.  Lady Elizabeth said nothing till Lady Elizabeth lord was present, and then appealed to George Hotspur. "Frank, didn't you see George Hotspur with the Altringhams at Goodwood, last July?"  "To be sure I did, and lost a pony to George Hotspur on Eros."  The lady looked at Emily, who said nothing further; but Lady Elizabeth was still quite convinced that George Hotspur had not been at those Goodwood races.  It is so hard, when you have used a lie commodiously, to bury a lie, and get well rid of a lie.
