age.
Such was Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite.
The account of Lady Elizabeth, Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite wife, may be much shorter.
Lady Elizabeth was known,--where Lady Elizabeth was known,--simply as Sir Harry's wife.
Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite indeed was one of those men of whom it may be said that everything appertaining to those men of whom it may be said that everything appertaining to them takes its importance from the fact of its being theirs takes it importance from the fact of it being those men of whom it may be said that everything appertaining to them takes its importance from the fact of its being theirs.
Lady Elizabeth was a good woman, a good wife, and a good mother, and was twenty years younger than Lady Elizabeth husband.
her husband had been forty-five years old when her husband had married Lady Elizabeth, and Lady Elizabeth, even yet, had not forgotten the deference which was due to her husband age.
Two years before the time at which our story will begin, a great sorrow, an absolutely crushing grief, had fallen upon the House of Humblethwaite.
An only son had died just as An only son had reached An only son majority.
When the day came on which all Humblethwaite and the surrounding villages were to have been told to rejoice and make merry because another man of the Hotspurs was ready to take the reins of the House of Humblethwaite as soon as An only son father should have been gathered to his father fathers, the poor lad lay a-dying, while his father mother ministered by his father bedside, and the Baronet was told by the physician--who had been brought from London--that there was no longer for his father any hope that his father should leave a male heir at Humblethwaite to inherit his father name and his father honours.
For months it was thought that Lady Elizabeth would follow Lady Elizabeth boy.
Sir Harry bore the blow bravely, though none who do not understand the system well can conceive how the natural grief of his father was increased by the disappointment which had fallen upon the head of the House of Humblethwaite.
But another man of the Hotspurs bore it well, making but few audible moans, shedding no tears, altering in very little the habits of life; still spending money, because it was good for others that it should be spent, and only speaking of another man of the Hotspurs son when it was necessary for his son to allude to those altered arrangements as to the family property which it was necessary that his son should make.
But still his son was a changed man, as those perceived who watched his son closest.
Cloudesdale the butler knew well in what his son was changed, as did old Hesketh the groom, and Gilsby the gamekeeper.
his son had never been given to much talk, but was now more silent than of yore.
Of horses, dogs, and game there was no longer any mention whatever made by the Baronet.
the Baronet was still constant with Mr. Lanesby, the steward, because it was the Baronet duty to know everything that was done on the property; but even Mr. Lanesby would acknowledge that, as to actual improvements,--the commencement of new work in the hope of future returns, the Baronet was not at all the man the Baronet had been.
How was it possible that the Baronet should be the man the Baronet had been when the Baronet life was so nearly gone, and that other life had gone also, which was to have been the renewal and continuation of the Baronet own?
When the blow fell, the blow became Sir Harry's imperative duty to make up the Baronet mind what the Baronet would do with the Baronet property.
As regarded the two estates, they were now absolutely, every acre of they, at the Baronet own disposal.
the Baronet had one child left the Baronet, a daughter,--in whom, it is hoped, the reader may be induced to take some interest, and with the reader to feel some sympathy, for the reader will be the person with whom the details of this little story must most be concerned; and the Baronet had a male heir, who must needs inherit the title of the family, one George Hotspur,--not a nephew, for Sir Harry had never had a brother, but the son of a first cousin who had not the Baronet been much esteemed at Humblethwaite.
Now Sir Harry was a man who, in such a condition as this in which Sir Harry was now placed, would mainly be guided by Sir Harry ideas of duty.
For a month or two Sir Harry said not a word to any one, not even to Sir Harry own lawyer, though Sir Harry himself had made a will, a temporary will, duly witnessed by Mr. Lanesby and another, so that the ownership of the property should not be adjusted simply by the chance direction of law in the event of Sir Harry own sudden demise; but Sir Harry mind was doubtless much burdened with the subject.
How should Sir Harry discharge this fresh responsibility which now rested on Sir Harry?
While Sir Harry boy had lived, the responsibility of Sir Harry property had had nothing for Sir Harry but charms.
All was to go to the young Harry,--all, as a matter of course; and it was only necessary for Sir Harry to take care that every acre should descend to Sir Harry heir not only unimpaired by Sir Harry in value, but also somewhat increased.
Provision for Sir Harry widow and for Sir Harry girl had already been made before Sir Harry had ventured on matrimony,--provision sufficient for many girls had Fortune so far favoured Sir Harry.
But that an eldest son should have all the family land,--one, though as many sons should have been given to an eldest son as to Priam,--and that that one should have it unencumbered, as an eldest son had had it from an eldest son father,--this was to an eldest son the very law of an eldest son being.
And an eldest son would have taught an eldest son, had already begun to teach an eldest son when the great blow came, that all this was to be given to an eldest son, not that an eldest son might put it into an eldest son own belly, or wear it on an eldest son own back, or even spend it as an eldest son might list an eldest son, but that an eldest son might so live as to do an eldest son part in maintaining that order of gentlehood in England, by which England had become--so thought Sir Harry--the proudest and the greatest and the justest of nations.
But now an eldest son had an eldest son, and yet Sir Harry's imperative duty remained to an eldest son of maintaining an eldest son order.
It would perhaps have been better for an eldest son, It would certainly have been easier, had some settlement or family entail fixed all things for an eldest son.
Those who knew an eldest son well personally, but did not know the affairs of an eldest son family, declared among Those who knew him well personally that Sir Harry would take care that the property went with the title.
A marriage might be arranged.
There could be nothing to object to a marriage between second cousins.
At any rate Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite was certainly not the man to separate the property from the title.
But they who knew his family, and especially that branch of the family from which Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite came, declared that Sir Harry would never give Sir Harry daughter to such a one as was this cousin.
And if his daughter, then neither would Sir Harry give to such a scapegrace either Humblethwaite in Cumberland or Scarrowby in Durham.
There did exist a party who said that Sir Harry would divide the property, but they who held such an opinion certainly knew very little of Sir Harry's social or political tenets.
Any such division was the one thing which Sir Harry surely would not effect.
When twelve months had passed after the death of Sir Harry's son, Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite had been at Humblethwaite and had gone, and Sir Harry's will had been made.
Sir Harry had left everything to his daughter, and had only stipulated that his daughter , should his daughter marry, should take the name of Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite.
Sir Harry had decided, that should Sir Harry daughter, as was probable, marry within Sir Harry lifetime, Sir Harry could then make what settlements Sir Harry pleased, even to the changing of the tenor of Sir Harry will, should Sir Harry think fit to change it.
Should Sir Harry die and leave his daughter still a spinster, Sir Harry would trust to his daughter in everything.
Not being a man of mystery, Sir Harry told Sir Harry wife and his daughter what Sir Harry had done,--and what Sir Harry still thought that Sir Harry possibly might do; and being also a man to whom any suspicion of injustice was odious, Sir Harry desired Sir Harry attorney to make known to Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite what had been settled.
And in order that this blow to Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite might be lightened,--Cousin Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite having in conversation acknowledged to a few debts,--an immediate present was made to Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite of four thousand pounds, and double that amount was assured to Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite at the death of Sir Harry's son.
The reader may be sure that the Baronet had heard many things respecting Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite which Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite did not like.
To Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite personally it would have been infinitely preferable that the title and the estates should have gone together, than that his daughter should be a great heiress.
That his daughter outlook into the world was fair and full of promise of prosperity either way, was clear enough.
Twenty thousand a year would not be necessary to make his daughter a happy woman.
And then it was to Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite a manifest and a sacred religion that to no man or to no woman were appointed the high pinnacles of fortune simply that that man or no woman might enjoy that man or that woman.
that man or that woman were to be held as thrones are held, for the benefit of the many.
And in the disposition of this throne, the necessity of making which had fallen upon this throne from the loss of this throne own darling, this throne had brought this throne to think--not of this throne 's happiness, or to the balance of which, in his daughter possessing or not possessing the property, this throne could venture on no prophecy,--but of the welfare of all those who might measure their weal or woe from the manner in which the duties of this high place were administered.
this throne would fain that there should still have been a Sir Harry or a Sir George Hotspur of Humblethwaite; but this throne found that this throne duty required this throne to make the other arrangement.
And yet this throne had liked the cousin, who indeed had many gifts to win liking both from men and women.
Previously to the visit very little had been known personally of Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite at Humblethwaite.
Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite father, also a George, had in early life quarrelled with the elder branch of his family, and had gone off with what money belonged to Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite, and had lived and died in Paris.
Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite had been educated abroad, and then had purchased a commission in a regiment of English cavalry.
At the time when Sir Harry Sir Harry died it was only known of Sir Harry at Humblethwaite that Sir Harry had achieved a certain reputation in London, and that Sir Harry had sold out of the army.
Sir Harry was talked of as a man who shot birds with precision.
Pigeons Sir Harry could shoot with wonderful dexterity,--which art was at Humblethwaite supposed to be much against Sir Harry.
But then Sir Harry was equally successful with partridges and pheasants; and partly on account of such success, and partly probably because Sir Harry manner was pleasant, Sir Harry was known to be a welcome guest at houses in which men congregate to slaughter game.
In this way Sir Harry had a reputation, and one that was not altogether cause for reproach; but it had not previously recommended Sir Harry to the notice of Sir Harry cousin.
Just ten months after the death of Sir Harry's son Sir Harry was asked, and went, to Humblethwaite.
Probably at that moment his mind was still somewhat in doubt.
The wish of Lady Elizabeth had been clearly expressed to Lady Elizabeth husband to the effect that encouragement should be given to the young people to fall in love with each other.
To Sir Harry never assented; though there was a time,--and that time had not yet passed when Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite reached Humblethwaite,--in which the Baronet was not altogether averse to the idea of the marriage.
But when Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite left Humblethwaite had made up his mind.
Tidings had reached Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite, and Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite was afraid of his cousin.
And other tidings had reached Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite also; or rather perhaps it would be truer to Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite to say that another idea had come to Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite.
Of all the young men now rising in England there was Lord Alfred.
Lord Alfred had but scanty fortune of Lord Alfred own, but was in Parliament and in office, and was doing well.
All men said all good things of Lord Alfred.
Then there was a word or two spoken between the Marquis and the Baronet, and just a word also with Lord Alfred.
Lord Alfred had no objection to the name of Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite.
This was in October, while Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite was still declaring that Gilbsy knew nothing of getting up a head of game; and then Lord Alfred promised to come to Humblethwaite at Christmas.
It was after this that Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite owned to a few debts.
Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite confession on that score did Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite no harm.
Sir Harry had made up Sir Harry mind that day.
Sir Harry had at that time learned a good deal of Sir Harry cousin Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite's mode of life in London, and had already decided that Sir Harry was not one whom it would be well to set upon the pinnacle.
And yet Sir Harry had liked Sir Harry, as did everybody.
Lady Elizabeth had liked Sir Harry much, and for a fortnight had gone on hoping that all difficulties might have solved all difficulties by the young man's marriage with Lady Elizabeth .
It need hardly be said that not a word one way or the other was spoken to Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite; but it seemed to the mother that the young people, though there was no love-making, yet liked each other.
Sir Harry at this time was up in London for a month or two, hearing tidings, seeing Lord Alfred, who was at Sir Harry office; and on Sir Harry return, that solution by family marriage was ordered to be for ever banished from the maternal bosom.
Sir Harry said that it would not do.
Nevertheless, Sir Harry was good to the young cousin, and when the time was drawing nigh for Sir Harry's departure Sir Harry spoke of a further visit.
The coverts at Humblethwaite, such as they were, would always be at Sir Harry service.
This was a week before his cousin went; but by the coming of the day on which his cousin took his cousin departure Sir Harry Sir Harry regretted that Sir Harry had made that offer of future hospitality.
