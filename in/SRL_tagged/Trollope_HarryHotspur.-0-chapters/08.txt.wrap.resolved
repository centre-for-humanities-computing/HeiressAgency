 LADY ALTRINGHAM.   There was one more meeting between Cousin George and Emily Hotspur, before Sir Harry left London with Sir Harry wife and daughter. On the Sunday afternoon following the ball Sir Harry called in Bruton Street, and found Lord Alfred there. Sir Harry knew that Lord Alfred there had been refused, and felt it to be a matter of course that the suit would be pressed again. Nevertheless, Sir Harry was quite free from animosity to Lord Alfred there. Sir Harry could see at a glance that there was no danger for Sir Harry on that side. Lord Alfred there was talking to Lady Elizabeth when Lord Alfred there entered, and Emily was engaged with a bald-headed old gentleman with a little ribbon and a star. a bald-headed old gentleman soon departed, and then Cousin George, in some skilfully indirect way, took an opportunity of letting Emily know that a bald-headed old gentleman should not go to Goodwood this July.  "Not go to Goodwood?" said Emily, pretending to laugh. "It will be most unnatural, will It not? They'll hardly start the horses without you, I should think."  "They'll have to start They without me, at any rate." Of course Emily understood what a bald-headed old gentleman meant, and understood also why a bald-headed old gentleman had told Emily. But if a bald-headed old gentleman promise were true, so much good had been done,--and Emily sincerely believed that it was true. In what way could a bald-headed old gentleman make love to Emily better than by refraining from a bald-headed old gentleman evil ways for the sake of pleasing Emily? Other bald-headed old gentlemen and bewigged old ladies came in, and a bald-headed old gentleman had not time for another word. a bald-headed old gentleman bade Emily adieu, saying nothing now of a bald-headed old gentleman hope of meeting Emily in the autumn, and was very affectionate in a bald-headed old gentleman farewell to Lady Elizabeth. "I don't suppose I shall see Sir Harry before Sir Harry starts. Say 'good-bye' for Sir Harry."  "I will, George."  "I am so sorry you are going. It has been so jolly, coming in here of a Sunday, Lady Elizabeth, and you have been so good to Sir Harry. I wish Scarrowby was at the bottom of the sea."  "Sir Harry wouldn't like that at all."  "I dare say not. And as such places must be, I suppose such places ought to be looked after. Only why in June? Good-bye! We shall meet again some day." But not a word was said about Humblethwaite in September. Sir Harry did not choose to mention the prospect of Sir Harry autumn visit, and she did not dare to do so. Sir Harry had not renewed the offer, and she would not venture to do so in Sir Harry's absence.  June passed away,--as Junes do pass in London,--very gaily in appearance, very quickly in reality, with a huge outlay of money and an enormous amount of disappointment. Young ladies would not accept, and young men would not propose. Papas became cross and stingy, and mammas insinuated that daughters were misbehaving. daughters fought daughters own battles, and became tired in the fighting of daughters, and many a one had declared to daughters before July had come to an end that it was all vanity and vexation of spirit.  The Altringhams always went to Goodwood,--husband and wife. Goodwood and Ascot for Lady Altringham were festivals quite as sacred as were Epsom and Newmarket for the Earl. daughters looked forward to them all the year, learned all daughters could about the horses which were to run, was very anxious and energetic about daughters party, and, if all that was said was true, had daughters little book. her little book was an institution also that George Hotspur should be one of her party; and of all the arrangements usually made, it was not the one which daughters Ladyship could dispense with the easiest. George knew exactly what daughters liked to have done, and how. the Earl would take no trouble, and desired simply to be taken there and back and to find everything that was wanted the very moment it was needed. And in all such matters the Countess chose that the Earl the Earl should be indulged. But it was necessary to have some one who would look after something--who would direct the servants, and give the orders, and be responsible. George Hotspur did it all admirably, and on such occasions earned the hospitality which was given to George Hotspur throughout the year. At Goodwood George Hotspur was almost indispensable to Lady Altringham; but for this meeting Lady Altringham was willing to dispense with George Hotspur. "I tell you, George Hotspur, that you're not to go," Lady Altringham said to George Hotspur.  "Nonsense, Lady Altringham."  "What a child you are! Don't you know what depends on it?"  "it does not depend on that."  "It may. Every little helps. Didn't you promise Lady Altringham that you wouldn't?"  "Lady Altringham didn't take it in earnest."  "I tell you, you know nothing about a woman. a woman will take it very much in earnest if you break your word."  "a woman'll never know."  "a woman will. a woman'll learn it. A girl like that learns everything. Don't go; and let a woman know that you have not gone."  George Hotspur thought that George Hotspur might go, and yet let a woman know that George Hotspur had not gone. An accomplished and successful lie was to George Hotspur a thing beautiful in itself,--an event that had come off usefully, a piece of strategy that was evidence of skill, so much gained on the world at the least possible outlay, an investment from which had come profit without capital. Lady Altringham was very hard on George Hotspur, threatening George Hotspur at one time with the Earl's displeasure, and absolute refusal of George Hotspur company. But George Hotspur pleaded hard that George Hotspur book would be ruinous to George Hotspur if George Hotspur did not go; that this was a pursuit of such a kind that a man could not give it up all of a moment; that a man would take care that a man name was omitted from the printed list of Lady Altringham's party; and that a man ought to be allowed this last recreation. The Countess at last gave way, and George Hotspur did go to Goodwood.  With the success or failure of George Hotspur on that occasion our story is not concerned. George Hotspur was still more flush of cash than usual, having something left of George Hotspur cousin's generous present. At any rate, George Hotspur came to no signal ruin at the races, and left London for Castle Corry on the 10th of August without any known diminution to George Hotspur prospects. At that time the Hotspurs were at Humblethwaite with a party; but the Hotspurs had been already decided that George should not prepare to make George visit till September. George was to write from Castle Corry. All that had been arranged between George and The Countess, and from Castle Corry George did write:--      DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry was kind enough to say    last winter that I might come to Humblethwaite again    this autumn. Will you be able to take me in on the 2nd    September? our have about finished with Altringham's house,    and Lady A. has had enough of DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry. They remain here till    the end of this month. With kind regards to Sir Harry and    Emily,     Believe me, yours always,     GEORGE HOTSPUR.   Nothing could be simpler than this note, and yet every word of it had been weighed and dictated by Altringham. "That won't do at all. You mustn't seem to be so eager," she had said, when George showed she the letter as prepared by George. "Just write as you would do if you were coming here." Then she sat down, and made the copy for George.  There was very great doubt and there was much deliberation over that note at Humblethwaite. The invitation had doubtless been given, and DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry did not wish to turn against DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry own flesh and blood,--to deny admittance to DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry house to the man who was the heir to DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry title. Were DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry to do so, DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry must give some reason; DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry must declare some quarrel; DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry must say boldly that all intercourse between some quarrel was to be at an end; and DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry must inform Cousin George that this strong step was taken because Cousin George was a--blackguard! There was no other way of escape left. And then Cousin George had done nothing since the days of the London intimacies to warrant such treatment; Cousin George had at least done nothing to warrant such treatment at the hands of DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry. And yet DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry thoroughly wished that DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry cousin was at Jerusalem. Cousin George still vacillated, but Cousin George vacillation did not bring Cousin George nearer to his cousin's side of the case. Every little thing that Cousin George saw and heard made Cousin George know that his cousin was a man to whom Cousin George could not give Cousin George daughter even for the sake of the family, without abandoning Cousin George duty to Cousin George child. At this moment, while Cousin George was considering Cousin George's letter, it was quite clear to Cousin George that George should not be George son-in-law; and yet the fact that the property and the title might be brought together was not absent from George mind when George gave George final assent. "I don't suppose she cares for George," George said to George wife.  "his wife's not in love with George, if you mean that."  "What else should I mean?" George said, crossly.  "his wife may learn to be in love with George."  "his wife had better not. his wife must be told. George may come for a week. I won't have George here for longer. Write to George and say that we shall be happy to have George from the second to the ninth. Emily must be told that I disapprove of George, but that I can't avoid opening his house to George."  I disapprove of him, but that I can't avoid opening my house to him were the most severe words George had ever spoken about Cousin George, but then that occasion had become very critical. Lady Elizabeth's reply was as follows:--      MY DEAR COUSIN GEORGE,--Sir Sir Harry and I will be very happy    to have you on the second, as you propose, and hope you    will stay till the eleventh.     Yours sincerely,     ELIZABETH HOTSPUR.   George was to come on a Saturday, but Lady Elizabeth did not like to tell George to go on a Saturday, because of the following day. Where could the poor fellow be on the Sunday? Lady Elizabeth therefore stretched Lady Elizabeth invitation for two days beyond the period sanctioned by Sir Harry.  "It's not very gracious," said George, as George showed the note to Altringham.  "I don't like it the less on that account. It shows that they're afraid about Lady Elizabeth, and they wouldn't be afraid without cause."  "There is not much of that, I fancy."  "they oughtn't to have a chance against you,--not if you play your game well. Even in ordinary cases the fathers and mothers are beaten by the lovers nine times out of ten. It is only when the men are oafs and louts that the men are driven off. But with you, with your cousinship, and half-heirship, and all your practice, and the family likeness, and the rest of it, if you only take a little trouble--"  "I'll take any amount of trouble."  "No, you won't. You'll deny yourself nothing, and go through no ordeal that is disagreeable to yourself. I don't suppose your things are a bit better arranged in London than your things were in the spring." She looked at him as though waiting for an answer, but him was silent. "It's too late for anything of that kind now, but still you may do very much. Make up your mind to this, that you'll ask George Hotspur to be your wife before you leave--what's the name of the place?"  "I have quite made up my mind to that, Altringham."  "As to the manner of doing it, I don't suppose that I can teach you anything."  "I don't know about that."  "At any rate I shan't try. Only remember this. Get She to promise to be firm, and then go at once to DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry. Don't let there be an appearance of doubt in speaking to DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry. And if DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry tells you of the property,--angrily I mean,--then do you tell DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry of the title. Make DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry understand that you give as much as you get. I don't suppose DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry will yield at first. Why should DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry? You are not the very best young man about town, you know. But if you get the very best young man about town, DEAR LADY ELIZABETH,--Sir Harry must follow. the very best young man about town looks like one that would stick to it, if the very best young man about town once had said it."  Thus prompted George Hotspur went from Castle Corry to Humblethwaite. I wonder whether George Hotspur was aware of the extent of the friendship of George Hotspur friend, and whether George Hotspur ever considered why it was that such a woman should be so anxious to assist George Hotspur in making George Hotspur fortune, let it be at what cost it might to others! Altringham was not the least in love with George Hotspur, was bound to Altringham by no tie whatsoever, would suffer no loss in the world should Cousin George come to utter and incurable ruin; but Cousin George was a woman of energy, and, as Cousin George liked the man, Cousin George was zealous in Cousin George friendship.
