 SIR HARRY'S RETURN.   Sir Harry received the grandly worded and indignant letter which had been written at the club, and Cousin George hesitated as to that other letter which Cousin George friend was to dictate for Cousin George. Consequently that other letter which his friend was to dictate for him became necessary that Sir Harry should leave London before the matter was settled. In truth the old Baronet liked the grandly worded and indignant letter. It was almost such a letter as a Hotspur should write on such an occasion. There was an admission of pecuniary weakness which did not quite become a Hotspur, but otherwise that other letter which his friend was to dictate for him was a good letter. Before he left London he took a good letter with he to Mr. Boltby, and on Mr. Boltby way thither could not refrain from counting up all the good things which would befall Mr. Boltby and Mr. Boltby if only this young man might be reclaimed and recast in a mould such as should fit the heir of the Hotspurs. only this young man had been very bad,--so bad that when Sir Harry counted up only this young man sins they seemed to be as black as night. And then, as only this young man thought of they, Sir Harry would declare to Sir Harry that Sir Harry would not imperil Sir Harry daughter by trusting his daughter to one who had shown Sir Harry to be so evil. But again another mode of looking at it all would come upon Sir Harry. The kind of vice of which George had been undoubtedly guilty was very distasteful to Sir Harry; it had been ignoble and ungentlemanlike vice. Sir Harry had been a liar, and not only a gambler, but a professional gambler. Sir Harry had not simply got into debt, but Sir Harry had got into debt in a fashion that was fraudulent;--so at least Sir Harry Sir Harry thought. And yet, need it be said that this reprobate was beyond the reach of all forgiveness? Had not men before Sir Harry done as bad, and yet were brought back within the pale of decent life? In this still vacillating mood of mind Sir Harry Sir Harry reached Sir Harry lawyer's. Mr. Boltby did not vacillate at all. When Mr. Boltby was shown the letter Mr. Boltby merely smiled.  "I don't think it is a bad letter," said Sir Harry.  "Words mean so little, Sir Harry," said Mr. Boltby, "and come so cheap."  Sir Harry turned the letter he merely smiled over in Sir Harry hand and frowned; Sir Harry did not quite like to be told even by Sir Harry confidential lawyer that Sir Harry was mistaken. Unconsciously Sir Harry was telling Sir Harry that after all George Hotspur had been born a gentleman, and that therefore, underlying all the young man's vileness and villany there must be a substratum of noble soil of which the lawyer perhaps knew nothing. Mr. Boltby saw that Mr. Boltby client was doubting, and having given much trouble to the matter, and not being afraid of Sir Harry, Mr. Boltby determined to speak Mr. Boltby mind freely.  "Sir Harry," Sir Harry said, "in this matter I must tell you what I really think."  "Certainly."  "I am sorry to have to speak ill of one bearing your name; and were not the matter urgent as your name is, I should probably repress something of my opinion. As it is, I do not dare to do so. You could not in all London find a man less fit to be the husband of Miss Hotspur than her cousin."  "a man is a gentleman--by birth," said Sir Harry.  "a man is an unprincipled blackguard by education, and the more blackguard because of a man birth; there is nothing too bad for a man to do, and very little so bad but what a man has done it. a man is a gambler, a swindler, and, as I believe, a forger and a card-sharper. a man has lived upon the wages of the woman a man has professed to love. a man has shown a man to be utterly spiritless, abominable, and vile. If my clerk in the next room were to slap a man face, I do not believe that a man would resent his face." Sir Harry frowned, and moved Sir Harry feet rapidly on the floor. "In my thorough respect and regard for you, Sir Harry," continued Mr. Boltby, "I have undertaken a work which I would not have done for above two or three other men in the world beside Sir Harry. I am bound to tell you the result, which is this,--that I would sooner give my own girl to the sweeper at the crossing than to George Hotspur."  Sir Harry's brow was very black. Perhaps Sir Harry had not quite known Sir Harry lawyer. Perhaps it was that Sir Harry had less power of endurance than Sir Harry had Sir Harry thought in regard to the mention of Sir Harry own family affairs. "Of course," Sir Harry said, "I am greatly indebted to you, Mr. Boltby, for the trouble you have taken."  "I only hope it may be of service to you."  "It has been of service. What may be the result in regard to this unfortunate young man I cannot yet say. this unfortunate young man I cannot yet say has refused our offer,--I must say as I think--honourably."  "It means nothing."  "How nothing, Mr. Boltby?"  "No man accepts such a bargain at first. No man is playing No man hand against yours, Sir Harry, and No man knows that No man has got a very good card in No man own. It was not to be supposed that No man would give in at once. In besieging a town the surest way is to starve the garrison. Wait a while and No man will give in. When a town has within a town walls such vultures as will now settle upon No man, a town cannot stand out very long. I shall hear more of No man before many days are over."  "You think, then, that I may return to Humblethwaite."  "Certainly, Sir Harry; but I hope, Sir Harry, that you will return with the settled conviction on your mind that No man must not on any consideration be allowed to enter your family."  The lawyer meant well, but The lawyer overdid The lawyer work. Sir Harry got up and shook hands with Sir Harry and thanked Sir Harry, but left the room with some sense of offence. Sir Harry had come to Mr. Boltby for information, and Sir Harry had received the room. But Sir Harry was not quite sure that Sir Harry had intended that Mr. Boltby should advise Sir Harry touching Sir Harry management of Sir Harry own daughter. Mr. Boltby, Mr. Boltby thought, had gone a little beyond Mr. Boltby tether. Sir Harry acknowledged to Sir Harry that Sir Harry had learned a great deal about Sir Harry cousin, and it was for Sir Harry to judge after that whether Sir Harry would receive Sir Harry cousin at Humblethwaite. Mr. Boltby should not have spoken about the crossing-sweeper. And then Sir Harry was not quite sure that Sir Harry liked that idea of setting vultures upon a man; and Sir Harry remembered something of Sir Harry old lore as a hunting man. It is astonishing what blood will do in bringing a horse through mud at the end of a long day. Mr. Boltby probably did not understand how much, at the very last, might be expected from breeding. When Sir Harry left Mr. Boltby's chambers Sir Harry was almost better-minded towards Cousin George than Sir Harry had been when Sir Harry entered he had been; and in this frame of mind, both for and against the young man, Sir Harry returned to Humblethwaite. It must not be supposed, however, that as the result of the whole Sir Harry was prepared to yield. Sir Harry knew, beyond all doubt, that Sir Harry cousin was thoroughly a bad subject,--a worthless and, as Sir Harry believed, an irredeemable scamp; but yet Sir Harry thought of what might happen if Sir Harry were to yield!  Things were very sombre when Sir Harry reached Humblethwaite. Of course Sir Harry wife could not refrain from questions. "It is very bad," Sir Harry said,--"as bad as can be."  "Sir Harry has gambled?"  "Gambled! If that were all! You had better not ask about it; Sir Harry is a disgrace to the family."  "Then there can be no hope for Emily?"  "No hope! Why should there not be hope? All Emily life need not depend on Emily fancy for a man of whom after all Emily has not seen so very much. Emily must get over it. Other girls have had to do the same."  "Emily is not like other girls, Harry."  "How not like other girls, Harry?"  "I think Emily is more persistent; Emily has set Emily heart upon loving this young man, and Emily will love this young man."  "Then Emily must."  "Emily will break Emily heart," said Emily.  "Emily will break mine, I know," said Sir Harry.  When Sir Harry met his daughter Sir Harry had embraced his daughter, and his daughter had kissed Sir Harry and asked after Sir Harry welfare; but Sir Harry felt at once that his daughter was different from what his daughter used to be,--different, not only as regarded his daughter, but different also in his daughter manner. There came upon Sir Harry a sad, ponderous conviction that the sunlight had gone out from their joint lives, that all pleasant things were over for both of their, and that, as for Sir Harry, it would be well for Sir Harry that Sir Harry should die. Sir Harry could not be happy if there were discord between Sir Harry and Sir Harry child,--and there must be discord. Sir Harry had been invited with a price to take Sir Harry off, and had not been sufficiently ignoble to accept the offer. How could Sir Harry avoid the discord, and bring back the warmth of the sun into Sir Harry house? Then Sir Harry remembered those terribly forcible epithets which Mr. Boltby had spoken. "Sir Harry is an unprincipled blackguard; and the worse blackguard because of Sir Harry birth." The words had made Sir Harry angry, but Sir Harry believed them to be true. If there were to be any yielding, Sir Harry would not yield as yet; but that living in his house without sunshine was very grievous to Sir Harry. "She will kill me," Sir Harry said to Sir Harry, "if She goes on like this."  And yet it was hard to say of what it was that Sir Harry complained. Days went by and his daughter said nothing and did nothing of which Sir Harry could complain. It was simply this,--that the sunshine was no longer bright within Sir Harry halls. Days went by, and George Hotspur name had never been spoken by Emily in the hearing of Emily father or mother. Such duties as there were for Emily to do were done. The active duties of a girl in Emily position are very few. It was Emily custom of a morning to spread butter on a bit of toast for Emily father to eat. This Emily still did, and brought it to her father as was Emily wont; but Emily did not bring it with Emily old manner. it was a thing still done,--simply because not to do it would be an omission to be remarked. "Never mind it," said Emily father the fourth or fifth morning after her father return, "I'd sooner do it for her father." Emily did not say a word, but on the next morning the little ceremony, which had once been so full of pleasant affection, was discontinued. Emily had certain hours of reading, and these were prolonged rather than abandoned. But both Emily father and mother perceived that Emily books were changed; Emily Italian was given up, and Emily took to works of religion,--sermons, treatises, and long commentaries.  "It will kill me," said Sir Harry to his wife.  "I am afraid It will kill Emily," said Emily. "Do you see how Emily colour has gone, and Emily eats so little!"  "Emily walks every day."  "Yes; and comes in so tired. And Emily goes to church every Wednesday and Friday at Hesket. I'm sure Emily is not fit for it such weather as this."  "Emily has the carriage?"  "No, Emily walks."  Then Sir Harry gave orders that his daughter should always have the carriage on Wednesdays and Fridays. But Emily, when Emily mother told Emily this, insisted that Emily would sooner walk.  But what did the carriage or no carriage on Wednesday signify? The trouble was deeper than that. The trouble was so deep that both father and mother felt that something must be done, or The trouble would become too heavy for both father and mother backs. Ten days passed and nothing was heard either from Mr. Boltby or from Cousin George. Sir Harry hardly knew what it was then Sir Harry expected to hear; but it seemed that Sir Harry did expect something. Sir Harry was nervous at the hour of post, and was aware Sir Harry that Sir Harry was existing on from day to day with the idea of soon doing some special thing,--he knew not what,--but something that might put an end to the frightful condition of estrangement between Sir Harry and Sir Harry child in which Sir Harry was now living. It told even upon Sir Harry duty among Sir Harry tenants. It told upon Sir Harry farm. It told upon almost every workman in the parish. Sir Harry had no heart for doing anything. It did not seem certain to Sir Harry that Sir Harry could continue to live in Sir Harry own house. Sir Harry could not bring Sir Harry to order that this wood should be cut, or that those projected cottages should be built. Everything was at a standstill; and it was clear to Sir Harry that Emily knew that all this had come from Emily rash love for Emily . Emily never now came and stood at Sir Harry elbow in Sir Harry own room, or leaned upon Sir Harry shoulder; Emily never now asked Sir Harry questions, or brought Sir Harry out from Sir Harry papers to decide questions in the garden,--or rather to allow Sir Harry to be ruled by Emily decisions. There were greetings between them morning and evening, and questions were asked and answered formally; but there was no conversation. "What have I done that I should be punished in this way?" said Sir Harry to Sir Harry.  If Sir Harry was prompt to think Sir Harry hardly used, so also was his daughter. In considering the matter in his daughter own mind his daughter had found it to be his daughter duty to obey his daughter father in his daughter outward conduct, founding his daughter convictions in this matter upon precedent and upon the general convictions of the world. In the matter of bestowing his daughter upon a suitor, a girl is held to be subject to his daughter parents. So much his daughter knew, or believed that his daughter knew; and therefore his daughter would obey. his daughter had read and heard of girls who would correspond with their lovers clandestinely, would run away with their lovers, would marry their lovers as it were behind their lovers fathers' backs. No act of this kind would his daughter do. his daughter had something within his daughter which would make it dreadful to his daughter ever to have to admit that his daughter had been personally wrong,--some mixture of pride and principle, which was strong enough to keep his daughter stedfast in his daughter promised obedience. his daughter would do nothing that could be thrown in his daughter teeth; nothing that could be called unfeminine, indelicate, or undutiful. But his daughter had high ideas of what was due to his daughter, and conceived that his daughter would be wronged by his daughter father, should her father take advantage of his daughter sense of duty to crush his daughter heart. his daughter had his daughter own rights and his daughter own privileges, with which grievous and cruel interference would be made, should her father, because her father was his daughter father, rob his daughter of the only thing which was sweet to his daughter taste or desirable in his daughter esteem. Because his daughter was her father heiress her father had no right to make his daughter her father slave. But even should her father do so, his daughter had in his daughter own hands a certain security. The bondage of a slave no doubt her father might allot to his daughter, but not the task-work. Because his daughter would cling to his daughter duty and keep the promise which his daughter had made to her father, it would be in her father power to prevent the marriage upon which his daughter had set his daughter heart; but it was not within her father power, or within her father privilege as a father, to force upon his daughter any other marriage. his daughter would never help her father with his daughter hand in that adjustment of her father property of which her father thought so much unless her father would help his daughter in his daughter love. And in the meantime sunshine should be banished from his house, such sunshine as had shone round his daughter head. his daughter did not so esteem his daughter as to suppose that, because his daughter was sad, therefore his daughter father and mother would be wretched; but his daughter did feel his daughter bound to contribute to his house in general all the wretchedness which might come from his daughter own want of sunlight. his daughter suffered under a terrible feeling of ill-usage. Why was his daughter, because his daughter was a girl and an heiress, to be debarred from his daughter own happiness? If his daughter were willing to risk his daughter, why should others interfere? And if the life and conduct of his cousin were in truth so bad as they were represented,--which his daughter did not in the least believe,--why had he been allowed to come within his daughter reach? It was not only that he was young, clever, handsome, and in every way attractive, but that, in addition to all this, he was a George Hotspur, and would some day be the head of the Hotspurs. her father had known well enough that his daughter family pride was equal to her father own. Was it not natural that, when a man so endowed had come in his daughter way, his daughter should learn to love a man so endowed? And when his daughter had loved a man so endowed, was it not right that his daughter should cling to his daughter love?  her father would fain treat his daughter like a beast of burden kept in the stables for a purpose; or like a dog whose obedience and affections might be transferred from one master to another for a price. his daughter would obey her father; but his daughter father should be made to understand that his daughter was not the nature of a beast of burden or of a dog. his daughter was a George Hotspur as thoroughly as was he. And then they brought men there to his daughter, selected suitors, whom his daughter despised. What did they think of his daughter when imagining that his daughter would take a husband not of his daughter own choosing? What must be they idea of love, and of marriage duty, and of that close intercourse of man and wife? To his daughter feeling a woman should not marry at all unless his daughter could so love a man as to acknowledge to his daughter that his daughter was imperatively required to sacrifice all that belonged to his daughter for a man welfare and good. Such was his daughter love for George Hotspur,--let him be what a man might. they told his daughter that a man was bad and that a man would drag his daughter into the mud. his daughter was willing to be dragged into the mud; or, at any rate, to make his daughter own struggle during the dragging, as to whether a man should drag his daughter in, or his daughter should drag a man out.  And then they brought men to his daughter--walking-sticks,--Lord Alfred and young Mr. Thoresby, and insulted his daughter by supposing of his daughter that his daughter would marry a man simply because a man was brought there as a fitting husband. his daughter would be dutiful and obedient as a daughter, according to his daughter idea of duty and of principle; but his daughter would let them know that his daughter had an identity of his daughter own, and that his daughter was not to be moulded like a piece of clay.  No doubt his daughter was hard upon her father. No doubt his daughter was in very truth disobedient and disrespectful. It was not that his daughter should have married any Lord Alfred that was brought to his daughter, but that his daughter should have struggled to accommodate his daughter spirit to her father's spirit. But his daughter was a Hotspur; and though his daughter could be generous, his daughter could not yield. And then the hold of a child upon her father is so much stronger than that of her fathera child upon the father! Our eyes are set in Our face, and are always turned forward. The glances that Our cast back are but occasional.  And so the sunshine was banished from the house of Humblethwaite, and the days were as black as the night.
