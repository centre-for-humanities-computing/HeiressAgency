 THE NEW SMITHY.
Sir Harry was sitting alone in the library when the tidings were brought to Sir Harry that George Hotspur had reached Humblethwaite with a pair of post-horses from Penrith.
The old butler, Cloudesdale, brought Sir Harry the news, and Cloudesdale whispered the news into Sir Harry ears with solemn sorrow.
Cloudesdale was well aware that Cousin George was no credit to the house of Humblethwaite.
And much about the same time the information was brought to Lady Elizabeth by Lady Elizabeth housekeeper, and to Emily by Emily own maid.
It was by Cloudesdale's orders that Cousin George was shown into the small room near the hall; and Cousin George told Sir Harry what Sir Harry had done in a funereal whisper.
Lady Altringham had been quite right in Lady Altringham method of ensuring the general delivery of the information about the house.
Emily flew at once to Emily mother.
"Cousin George is here," Emily said.
Mrs. Quick, the housekeeper, was at that moment leaving the small room near the hall.
"So Quick tells me.
What can have brought Cousin George, my dear?"
"Why should Cousin George not come, Mamma?"
"Because your papa will not make Cousin George welcome to the house.
Oh, dear,--he knows that.
What are we to do?"
In a few minutes Quick came back again.
Sir Harry would be much obliged if Sir Harry ladyship would go to Sir Harry.
Then it was that the sandwiches and sherry were ordered.
It was a compromise on the part of Lady Elizabeth between Emily's prayer that some welcome might be shown, and Sir Harry's presumed determination that the banished man should continue to be regarded as banished.
"Take the banished man some kind of refreshment, Quick;--a glass of wine or something, you know."
Then Quick had cut the sandwiches with Quick own hand, and Cloudesdale had given the sherry.
"the banished man ain't eaten much, but the banished man's made it up with the wine," said Cloudesdale, when the tray was brought back again.
Lady Elizabeth went down to Lady Elizabeth husband, and there was a consultation.
Sir Harry was quite clear that Sir Harry would not now, on this day, admit Cousin George as a guest into Sir Harry house; nor would Sir Harry see Sir Harry.
To that conclusion Sir Harry came after Sir Harry wife had been with Sir Harry some time.
Sir Harry would not see Sir Harry, there, at Humblethwaite.
If Cousin George had anything to say that could not be said in a letter, a meeting might be arranged elsewhere.
Sir Harry confessed, however, that Sir Harry could not see that good results could come from any meeting whatsoever.
"The truth is, that I don't want to have anything more to do with Sir Harry," said Sir Harry.
That was all very well, but as Emily's wants in this respect were at variance with Emily father's, there was a difficulty.
Emily pleaded that some kind of civility, at least some mitigation of opposition, should be shown, for Emily's sake.
At last Emily was commissioned to go to Cousin George, to send Cousin George away from the house, and, if necessary, to make an appointment between Cousin George and Sir Harry at the Crown, at Penrith, for the morrow.
Nothing on earth should induce Sir Harry to see Cousin George anywhere on Sir Harry own premises.
As for any meeting between Cousin George George and Emily, that was, of course, out of the question,--and Sir Harry must go from Humblethwaite.
Such were the instructions with which Emily descended to the little room.
Cousin George came forward with the pleasantest smile to take Emily by the hand.
Cousin George was considerably relieved when Cousin George saw Emily, because of Emily Cousin George was not afraid.
"I do not at all mind waiting," Cousin George said.
"How is Sir Harry?"
"Quite well."
"And yourself?"
"Pretty well, thank you."
"And Emily?"
Emily knew that in answering Cousin George Emily ought to call Emily own daughter Miss Hotspur, but Emily lacked the courage.
"Emily is well too.
Sir Harry has thought it best that I should come to Emily and explain that just at present Sir Harry cannot ask you to Humblethwaite."
"I did not expect it."
"And Sir Harry had rather not see you himself,--at least not here."
Emily had not been instructed to propose a meeting.
Emily had been told rather to avoid a meeting if possible.
But, like some other undiplomatic ambassadors, in Emily desire to be civil, Emily ran at once to the extremity of the permitted concessions.
"If you have anything to say to Sir Harry--"  "I have, Emily; a great deal."
"And if you could write it--"  "I am so bad at writing."
"Then Sir Harry will go over and see you to-morrow at Penrith."
"That will be so very troublesome to Sir Harry!"
"You need not regard that.
At what hour shall Sir Harry come?"
Cousin George was profuse in declaring that Cousin George would be at Cousin George's disposal at any hour Sir Harry Sir Harry might select, from six in the morning throughout the day and night.
But might Cousin George not say a word to Emily?
At this proposition Emily shook Emily head vigorously.
It was quite out of the question.
Circumstanced as they all were at present, Sir Harry would not think of such a thing.
And then it would do no good.
Emily did not believe that Emily Emily would wish it.
At any rate there need be no further talk about it, as any such interview was at present quite impossible.
By all which arguments and refusals, and the tone in which they were pronounced, Cousin George was taught to perceive that, at any rate in the mind of Emily, the process of parental yielding had already commenced.
On all such occasions interviews are bad.
The teller of this story ventures to take the opportunity of recommending parents in such cases always to refuse interviews, not only between the young lady and the lover who is to be excluded, but also between parents in such cases and the lover.
The vacillating tone,--even when the resolve to suppress vacillation has been most determined,--is perceived and understood, and at once utilized, by the least argumentative of lovers, even by lovers who are obtuse.
The word "never" may be so pronounced as to make the young lady's twenty thousand pounds full present value for ten in the lover's pocket.
There should be no arguments, no letters, no interviews; and Lady Elizabeth's love should be starved by the absence of all other mention of the name, and by the imperturbable good humour on all other matters of those with whom Lady Elizabeth comes in contact in Lady Elizabeth own domestic circle.
If it be worth anything, it be worth anything won't be starved; but if starving to death be possible, that is the way to starve it be worth anything.
Lady Elizabeth was a bad ambassador; and Cousin George, when Cousin George took Cousin George leave, promising to be ready to meet Sir Harry at twelve on the morrow, could almost comfort Sir Harry with a prospect of success.
Sir Harry might be successful, if only Sir Harry could stave off the Walker and Bullbean portion of Mr. Hart's persecution!
For Sir Harry understood that the success of Sir Harry views at Humblethwaite must postpone the payment by Sir Harry of those moneys for which Mr. Hart and Captain Stubber were so unreasonably greedy.
Sir Harry would have dared to defy the greed, but for the Walker and Bullbean portion of the affair.
Sir Harry already knew that Sir Harry was in debt to these men; already knew with fair accuracy the amount of those debts.
Hart and Stubber could not make Sir Harry worse in Sir Harry's eyes than Sir Harry was already, unless the Walker and Bullbean story should be told with the purpose of destroying Sir Harry.
How Sir Harry did hate Walker and Bullbean and the memory of that evening;--and yet the money which now enabled Sir Harry to drink champagne at the Penrith Crown was poor Walker's money!
As Sir Harry was driven back to Penrith Sir Harry thought of all this, for some moments sadly, and at others almost with triumph.
Might not a letter to Hart, with perhaps a word of truth in a letter to Mr. Hart, do some good?
That evening, after Hart champagne, Hart wrote a letter:--      DEAR MR. HART,--Things are going uncommon well here, only    I hope you will do nothing to disturb just at present.
It _must_ come off, if a little time is given, and then    _every shilling_ will be paid.
A few pounds more or less    won't make any difference.
Do arrange this, and you'll    find I'll never forget how kind you have been.
I've been    at Humblethwaite to-day, and things are going quite    smooth.
Yours most sincerely,     GEORGE HOTSPUR.
Don't mention Walker's name, and everything shall be    settled just as you shall fix.
The Crown, Penrith, Thursday.
The moment a letter to Mr. Hart was written Hart rang the bell and gave a letter to Mr. Hart to the waiter.
Such was the valour of drink operating on Hart now, as it had done when Hart wrote that other letter to Sir Harry!
The drink made Hart brave to write, and to make attempts, and to dare consequences; but even whilst brave with drink, Hart knew that the morning's prudence would refuse the morning's prudence assent to such courage; and therefore, to save Hart from the effects of the morning's cowardice, Hart put a letter to Mr. Hart at once out of Hart own power of control.
After this fashion were arranged most of Cousin George affairs.
Before dinner on that day the evening of which he had passed with Walker, he had resolved that certain hints given to he by Mr. Bullbean should be of no avail to him;--not to that had Mr. Bullbean yet descended, nor would Mr. Bullbean so descend;--but with Mr. Bullbean brandy after dinner divine courage had come, and success had attended the brave.
As soon as he was awake on that morning after writing to Hart, he rang he bell to inquire whether that letter which he had given to the waiter at twelve o'clock last night were still in the house.
It was too late.
The letter in which so imprudent a mention had been made of Walker's name was already in the post.
"Never mind," said Cousin George to Cousin George; "None but the brave deserve the fair."
Then Cousin George turned round for another nap.
It was not much past nine, and Sir Harry would not be there before twelve.
In the mean time there had been hope also and doubt also at Humblethwaite.
Sir Harry was not surprised and hardly disappointed when Sir Harry was told that Sir Harry was to go to Penrith to see Cousin George.
The offer had been made by Sir Harry, and Sir Harry was sure that Sir Harry would not escape with less; and when Emily was told by Emily mother of the arrangement, Emily saw in The offer a way to the fulfilment of the prayer which Emily had made to Emily .
Emily would say nothing to Sir Harry that evening, leaving to Sir Harry the opportunity of speaking to Emily, should Sir Harry choose to do so.
But on the following morning Emily would repeat the prayer which she had made to her father.
On that evening not a word was said about Cousin George while Sir Harry and Lady Elizabeth were together with Sir Harry and Lady Elizabeth daughter.
Emily had made Emily plan, and Emily clung to her plan.
Emily was very gentle with Emily, sitting close to Emily as Emily played some pieces of music to her father in the evening, caressing Emily and looking lovingly into Emily eyes, as her father bade God bless Emily when Emily left her father for the night; but her father had determined to say nothing to encourage Emily.
her father was still minded that there could be no such encouragement; but her father doubted;--in her father heart of hearts her father doubted.
her father would still have bought off Cousin George by the sacrifice of half her father property, and yet her father doubted.
After all, there would be some consolation in that binding together of the name and the property.
"What will you say to her father?"
Emily asked Emily husband that night.
"Tell her husband to go away."
"Nothing more than that?"
"What more is there to say?
If her husband be willing to be bought, I will buy her husband.
I will pay her husband debts and give her husband an income."
"You think, then, there can be no hope?"
"Hope!--for whom?"
"For Emily."
"I hope to preserve her--from a--scoundrel."
And yet her husband had thought of the consolation!
Emily was very persistent in carrying out her plan.
Prayers at Humblethwaite were always read with admirable punctuality at a quarter-past nine, so that breakfast might be commenced at half-past.
Sir Harry every week-day was in Sir Harry own room for three-quarters of an hour before prayers.
All this was like clock-work at Humblethwaite.
There would always be some man or men with Sir Harry during these three-quarters of an hour,--a tenant, a gamekeeper, a groom, a gardener, or a bailiff.
But Emily calculated that if Emily made Emily appearance and held Emily ground, the tenant or the bailiff would give way, and that thus Emily would ensure a private interview with Emily .
Were Emily to wait till after breakfast, this would be difficult.
A very few minutes after the half-hour Emily knocked at the door and was admitted.
The village blacksmith was then suggesting a new smithy.
"Papa," said Emily, "if you would allow me half a minute--"  The village blacksmith and the bailiff, who was also present, withdrew, bowing to Emily, who gave to each of them a smile and a nod.
them were Emily old familiar friends, and them looked kindly at Emily.
Emily was to be them future lady; but was it not all important that them future lord should be a Hotspur?
Sir Harry had thought it not improbable that Sir Harry daughter would come to Sir Harry, but would have preferred to avoid the interview if possible.
Here it was, however, and could not be avoided.
"Papa," his daughter said, kissing Sir Harry, "you are going to Penrith to-day."
"Yes, my dear."
"To see Cousin George?"
"Yes, Emily."
"Will you remember what we were saying the other day;--what I said?"
"I will endeavour to do my duty as best I may," said Sir Harry, after a pause.
"I am sure you will, Papa;--and so do I. I do endeavour to do my duty.
Will you not try to help Papa;--and?"
"Certainly, I will try to help Papa;--and; for your sake rather than for Papa;--and own.
If I can help Papa;--and with money, by paying Papa;--and debts and giving Papa;--and means to live, I will do so."
"Papa, that is not what I mean."
"What else can I do?"
"Save Papa;--and from the evil of Papa;--and ways."
"I will try.
I would,--if I knew how,--even if only for the name's sake."
"For my sake also, Papa.
Papa, let we do it together; you and I and Mamma.
Let Papa;--and come here."
"It is impossible."
"Let Papa;--and come here," she said, as though disregarding Papa;--and refusal.
"You need not be afraid of she.
I know how much there is to do that will be very hard in doing before any,--any other arrangement can be talked about."
"I am not afraid of you, my child."
"Let Papa;--and come, then."
"No;--it would do no good.
Do you think Papa;--and would live here quietly?"
"Try Papa;--and."
"What would people say?"
"Never mind what people would say: Papa;--and is we cousin; Papa;--and is your heir.
Papa;--and is the person whom I love best in all the world.
Have you not a right to have Papa;--and here if you wish it?
I know what you are thinking of; but, Papa, there can never be anybody else;--never."
"Emily, you will kill me, I think."
"Papa, let we see if we cannot try.
And, oh, Papa, pray, pray let me see Papa;--and."
When she went away the bailiff and the blacksmith returned; but Sir Harry's power of resistance was gone, so that Sir Harry succumbed to the new smithy without a word.
