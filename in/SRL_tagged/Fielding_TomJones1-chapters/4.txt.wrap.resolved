a large Fortune; that a large Fortune had a good Heart, and no Family. Hence, doubtless, it will be concluded by many, that a large Fortune lived like an honest Man, owed no one a Shilling, took nothing but what was a large Fortune own, kept a good House, entertained a large Fortune Neighbors with a hearty Welcome at a large Fortune Table, and was charitable to the Poor, i. e. to those who had rather beg than work, by giving those who had rather beg than work the Offals from the Offals; that a large Fortune died immensely rich, and built an Hospital.  And true it is, that a large Fortune did many of these Things; but, had a large Fortune done nothing more, I should have left a large Fortune to have recorded a large Fortune own Merit on some fair Freestone over the Door of that Hospital. Matters of a much more extraordinary Kind are to be the Subject of this History, or I should grossly mispend my Time in writing so voluminous a Work; and you, my sagacious Friend, might, with equal Profit and Pleasure, travel through some Pages, which certain droll Authors have been facetiously pleased to call The History of England.  Mr. Allworthy had been absent a full Quarter of a Year in London, on some very particular Business, though I know not what it was; but judge of it Importance, by it having detained Mr. Allworthy so long from home, whence Mr. Allworthy had not been absent a Month at a Time during the Space of many Years. Mr. Allworthy came to Mr. Allworthy House very late in the Evening, and after a short Supper with Mr. Allworthy Sister, retired much fatigued to Mr. Allworthy Chamber. Here, having spent some Minutes on Mr. Allworthy Knees, a Custom which Mr. Allworthy never broke through on any Account, Mr. Allworthy was preparing to step into Bed, when, upon opening the Clothes, to Mr. Allworthy great Surprise, Mr. Allworthy beheld an Infant, wrapped up in some coarse Linen, in a sweet and profound Sleep, between Mr. Allworthy Sheets. Mr. Allworthy stood some Time lost in Astonishment at this Sight; but, as Goodnature was always the Ascendant in Mr. Allworthy Mind, Mr. Allworthy soon began to be touched with Sentiments of Compassion for the little Wretch before Mr. Allworthy. Mr. Allworthy then rang Mr. Allworthy Bell, and ordered an elderly Woman Servant to rise immediately and come to an elderly Woman Servant, and in the mean Time was so eager in contemplating the Beauty of Innocence, appearing in those lively Colors with which Infancy and Sleep always display it, that an elderly Woman Servant Thoughts were too much engaged to reflect that an elderly Woman Servant was in an elderly Woman Servant Shirt, when the Matron came in. the Matron had indeed given the Matron sufficient Time to dress an elderly Woman Servant; for out of Respect to an elderly Woman Servant, and Regard to Decency, the Matron had spent many Minutes in adjusting the Matron Hair at the Looking-glass, notwithstanding all the Hurry in which the Matron had been summoned by an elderly Woman Servant, and though the Matron Master, for ought the Matron knew, lay expiring in an Apoplexy, or in some other Fit.  It will not be wondered at, that a Creature, who had so strict a Regard to Decency in the Matron own Person, should be shocked at the least Deviation from it in another. the Matron therefore no sooner opened the Door, and saw her Master standing by the Bedside in her Master Shirt, with a Candle in her Master Hand, than the Matron started back in a most terrible Fright, and might perhaps have swooned away, had her Master not now recollected her Master being undrest, and put an End to the Matron Terrors, by desiring the Matron to stay without the Door till her Master had thrown some Clothes over her Master Back, and was become incapable of shocking the pure Eyes of Mrs. Deborah Wilkins, who, though in' the 52d Year of the Matron Age, vowed the Matron had never beheld a Man without a Man Coat. Sneerers and profane Wits may perhaps laugh at the Matron first Fright, yet my graver Reader, when her Master considers the Time of Night, the Summons from the Matron Bed, and the Situation in which the Matron found the Matron Master, will highly justify and applaud the Matron Conduct; unless the Prudence, which must be supposed to attend Maidens at that Period of Life at which Mrs. Deborah had arrived, should a little lessen her Master Admiration.  When Mrs. Deborah returned into the Room, and was acquainted by Mrs. Deborah with the finding the little Infant, Mrs. Deborah Consternation was rather greater than her Master had been; nor could Mrs. Deborah refrain from crying out with great Horror of Accent as well as Look, 'My good Sir! what is to be done?" Mr. Allworthy answered, Mr. Allworthy must take care of the Child that Evening, and in the Morning Mr. Allworthy would give Orders to provide Orders a Nurse, 'Yes, My good Sir,' says Mr. Allworthy,' and I hope your Worship will send out your Warrant to take up the Hussy Orders Mother (for Mr. Allworthy must be one of the Neighborhood) and I should be glad to see Mr. Allworthy committed to Bridewel, and whipped at the Cart's Tail. Indeed such wicked Sluts cannot be two severely punished. I Will warrant it is not Mr. Allworthy first, by Mr. Allworthy Impudence in laying it to your Worship.' In laying it to me, Deborah,' answered Mr. Allworthy,' 'I cannot think Mr. Allworthy has any such Design. I suppose Mr. Allworthy has only taken this Method to provide for Mr. Allworthy Child; and truly I am glad Mr. Allworthy has not done worse,' I don't know what is worse,' cries Deborah, than for such wicked Strumpets to lay their Sins at honest Men's Doors; and though your Worship knows your own Innocence, yet the World is censorious; and the World has been many an honest Man's Hap to pass for the Father of Children he never begot; and if your Worship should provide for the Child, it may make the People the apter to believe: Besides, why should your Worship provide for what the Parish is obliged to maintain? For my own Part, if it was an honest Man's Child indeed; but for my own Part, it goes against me to touch those misbegotton Wretches, whom I don't look upon as my Fellow Creatures. Faugh, how it stinks! it does not smell like a Christian. If I might be so bold to give my Advice, I would have it put in a Basket, and sent out and laid at the Church-Warden's Door. It is a good Night, only a little rainy and windy; and if it was well wrapped up, and put in a warm Basket, it is two to one but it lives 'till it is found in the Morning. But if it should not, we have discharged we Duty in taking proper care of it; and it is, perhaps, better for such Creatures to die in a state of Innocence, than to grow up and imitate their Mothers; for nothing better can be expected of their.'  There were some Strokes in this Speech which, perhaps, would have offended Mr. Allworthy, had Mr. Allworthy strictly attended to it; but Mr. Allworthy had now got one^ of Mr. Allworthy Fingers into the Infant's Hand, which by it gentle Pressure, seeming to implore Mr. Allworthy Assistance, had certainly out-pleaded the Eloquence of Mrs. Deborah, had it been ten times greater than it was. Mr. Allworthy now gave Mrs. Deborah positive Orders to take the Child to Mrs. Deborah own Bed, and to call up a Maidservant to provide a Maidservant Pap and other things against a Maidservant waked. Mr. Allworthy likewise ordered that proper Clothes should be procured for a Maidservant early in the Morning, and that a Maidservant should be brought to Mr. Allworthy as soon as Mr. Allworthy was stirring.  Such was the Discernment of Mrs. Wilkins, and such the Respect Mrs. Wilkins bore Mrs. Wilkins Master, under whom Mrs. Wilkins enjoyed a most excellent Place, that Mrs. Wilkins Scruples gave way to her Scruples peremptory Commands; and Mrs. Wilkins took the Child under Mrs. Wilkins Arms, without any apparent Disgust at the Illegality of the Child Birth; and declaring the Child was a sweet little Infant, walked off with the Child to Mrs. Wilkins .  Allworthy here betook Allworthy here to those pleasing Slumbers, which a Heart that hungers after Goodness is apt to enjoy, when thoroughly satisfied. As these are possibly sweeter than what are occasioned by any other hearty Meal, I should take more Pains to display these are possibly sweeter than what are occasioned by any other hearty Meal to the Reader, if I knew any Air to recommend Allworthy here to for the procuring such an Appetite.  CHAP. IV. the Reader's Neck brought into Danger by a Description, The Reader's Neck Escape and the great Condescension of Miss Bridget Allworthy.  THE Gothic Style of Building could produce nothing nobler than Miss Bridget Allworthy's House. There was an Air of Grandeur in it, that struck you with Awe, and rivaled the Beauties of the best Grecian Architecture; and it was as commodious within, as venerable without.  it stood on the South-east Side of a Hill, but nearer the Bottom than the Top of it, so as to be sheltered from the North-east by a Grove of old Oaks, which rose above it in a gradual Ascent of near half a Mile, and yet high enough to enjoy a most charming Prospect of the Valley beneath.  In the midst of the Grove was a fine Lawn sloping down toward Mr. Allworthy's House, near the Summit of which rose a plentiful Spring, gushing out of a Rock covered with Firs, and forming a constant Cascade of about thirty Foot, not carried down a regular Flight of Steps, but tumbling in a natural Fall over the broken and mossy Stones, till it came to the bottom of the Rock; then running off in a pebly Channel, that with many lesser Falls winded along, till it fell into a Lake at the Foot of a Hill, about a quarter of a Mile below Mr. Allworthy's House on the South Side, and which was seen from every Room in the Front. Out of this Lake, which filled the Center of a beautiful Plain, embellished with Groupes of Beeches and Elms, and fed with Sheep, issued a River, that for several Miles was seen to meander through an amazing Variety of Meadows and Woods, till Sheep emptied Sheep into the Sea, with a large Arm of which, and an Island beyond it, the prospect was closed.  On the right of the Valley opened another of less Extent, adorned with several Villages, and terminated by one of the Towers of an old ruined Abbey, grown over with Ivy, and Part of the Front which remained still entire.  The left Hand Scene presented the View of a fine Park, composed of very unequal Ground, and agreeably varied with all the Diversity that Hills, Lawns, Wood and Water, laid out with admirable Taste, but owing less to Art than to Nature, could give. Beyond this the Country gradually rose into a Ridge of wild Mountains, the Tops of which were above the Clouds.  It was now the Middle of May, and the Morning was remarkably serene, when Mr. Allworthy walked forth on the Terrace, where the Dawn opened every Minute that lovely Prospect we have before described to Mr. Allworthy Eye. And now having sent forth Streams of Light, which ascended the blue Firmament before Mr. Allworthy as Harbingers preceding Mr. Allworthy Pomp, in the full Blaze of Mr. Allworthy Majesty, rose the Sun; than which one Object alone in this lower Creation could be more glorious, and that Mr. Allworthy presented; a human Being replete with Benevolence, meditating in what manner Mr. Allworthy might render Mr. Allworthy most acceptable to Mr. Allworthy Creator, by doing most good to Mr. Allworthy Creatures.  the Reader, take care, I have unadvisedly led the Reader to the Top of as high a Hill as Mr. Allworthy's, and how to get the Reader down without breaking thy Neck, I do not well know. However, let us even venture to slide down together, for Miss Bridget rings Miss Bridget Bell, and Mr. Allworthy is summoned to Breakfast, where I must attend, and, if you please, shall be glad of your Company.  The usual Compliments having past between Mr. Allworthy and Miss Bridget, and the Tea being poured out, Mr. Allworthy summoned Mrs. Wilkins, and told Mr. Allworthy Sister Mr. Allworthy had a Present for his Sister; for which his Sister thanked Mr. Allworthy, imagining, I suppose, it had been a Gown or some Ornament for his Sister Person. Indeed, Mr. Allworthy very often made his Sister such Presents, and his Sister in Complaisance to Mr. Allworthy spent much time in adorning his Sister. I say, in Complaisance to Mr. Allworthy, because his Sister always expressed the greatest Contempt for Dress, and for those Ladies who made it those Ladies who made it their Study Study.  But if such was his Sister Expectation, how was his Sister disappointed, when Mrs. Wilkins, according to the Order his Sister had received from his Sister Master, produced the little Infant. Great Surprises, as has been observed, are apt to be silent, and so was Miss Bridget, 'till his Sister Brother began and told his Sister the whole Story, which as the Reader knows already, we shall not repeat.  Miss Bridget Miss Bridget had always expressed so great a regard for what the Ladies are pleased to call Virtue, and had Miss Bridget maintained such a Severity of Character, that it was expected, especially by Mrs. Wilkins, that Miss Bridget would have vented much Bitterness on this Occasion, and would have voted for sending the Child, as a kind of noxious Animal, immediately out of Mr. Allworthy's House; but on the contrary, Miss Bridget rather took the good-natured side of the question, intimated some Compassion for the helpless little Creature, and commended Miss Bridget Brother's Charity in what he had done.  Perhaps the Reader the Reader may account for this Behavior from Miss Bridget Condescension to Mr. Allworthy, when we have informed he, that the good Man had ended the good Man Narrative with owning a Resolution to take care of the Child, and to breed the good Man up as the good Man own; for to acknowledge the Truth, Miss Bridget was always ready to oblige Miss Bridget Brother, and very seldom, if ever, contradicted her Brother Sentiments; Miss Bridget would indeed sometimes make a few Observations, as, that Men were headstrong and must have Men own way, and would wish Miss Bridget had been blessed with an independent Fortune; but these were always vented in a low Voice, and at the most amounted only to what is called Muttering.  However, what Miss Bridget withheld from the little Infant, Miss Bridget bestowed with the utmost Profuseness on the poor unknown Mother, whom Miss Bridget called an impudent Slut, a wanton Hussy, an audacious Harlot, a wicked Jade, a vile Strumpet, with every other Appellation with which the Tongue of Virtue never fails to lash those who bring a Disgrace on the Sex.  A Consultation was now entered into, how to proceed in order to discover the Mother. A Scrutiny was first made into the Characters of the female Servants of Mr. Allworthy's House, who were all acquitted by Mrs. Wilkins, and with apparent Merit; for she had collected them she, and perhaps it would be difficult to find such another Set of Scare-crows.  The next Step was to examine among the Inhabitants of the Parish; and this was referred to Mrs. Wilkins, who was to enquire with all imaginable Diligence, and to make she Report in the Afternoon.  Matters being thus settled, Mr. Allworthy withdrew to Mr. Allworthy Study, as was Mr. Allworthy Custom, and left the Child to Mr. Allworthy Sister, who, at Mr. Allworthy Desire, had undertaken the Care of it.  CHAP. V. Containing a few common Matters, with a very uncommon Observation upon them.  WHEN her Master departed, Mrs. Deborah stood silent, expecting Mrs. Deborah Cue from Miss Bridget; for as to what had past before Mrs. Deborah Master, the prudent Housekeeper by no means relied upon it, as Mrs. Deborah had often known the Sentiments of the Lady in Mrs. Deborah 's Absence to differ greatly from those which Mrs. Deborah had expressed in her Brother Presence. Miss Bridget did not, however suffer Miss Bridget to continue long in this doubtful Situation; for having looked some time earnestly at the Child, as it lay asleep in the Lap of Mrs. Deborah, the Lady could not forbear giving it a hearty Kiss, at the same time declaring Miss Bridget wonderfully pleased with it Beauty and Innocence. Mrs. Deborah no sooner observed this, than Mrs. Deborah fell to squeezing and kissing with as great Raptures as sometimes inspire the sage Dame of forty and five toward a youthful and vigorous Bridegroom, crying out in a shrill Voice, 'O the dear little Creature, the dear, sweet, pretty Creature! well, I vow, it is as fine a Boy as ever was seen!'  These Exclamations continued 'till These Exclamations were interrupted by the Lady, who now proceeded to execute the Commission given Mrs. Deborah by Mrs. Deborah , and gave Orders for providing all Necessaries for the Child, appointing a very good Room in Mr. Allworthy's House for a very good Room in the House Nursery. Orders were indeed so liberal, that had it been a Child of Mrs. Deborah own, Mrs. Deborah could not have exceeded her own; but lest the virtuous the Reader may condemn Mrs. Deborah for showing too great Regard to a base-born Infant, to which all Charity is condemned by Law as irreligious, we think proper to observe, that Mrs. Deborah concluded the whole with saying, 'Since it was Mrs. Deborah Brother's Whim to adopt the little Brat, Mrs. Deborah supposed her Master must be treated with great Tenderness; for Mrs. Deborah part, Mrs. Deborah could not help thinking it was an Encouragement to Vice; but that Mrs. Deborah knew too much of the Obstinacy of Mankind to oppose any of their ridiculous Humors.'  With Reflections of this nature, Mrs. Deborah usually, as has been hinted, accompanied every Act of Compliance with Mrs. Deborah 's Inclinations; and surely nothing could more contribute to heighten the Merit of Compliance, than a Declaration that Mrs. Deborah knew at the same time the Folly and Unreasonableness of those Inclinations to which Mrs. Deborah submitted. Tacit Obedience implies no Force upon the Will, and consequently may be easily, and without any Pains preserved; but when a Wife, a Child, a Relation, or a Friend, performs what we desire, with Grumbling, and Reluctance, with Expressions of Dislike and Dissatisfaction, the manifest Difficulty which Dislike and Dissatisfaction undergo, must greatly enhance the Obligation.  As this is one of those deep Observations which very few Readers can be supposed capable of making Readers, I have thought proper to lend Readers my Assistance; but this is a Favor rarely to be expected in the Course of my Work. Indeed I shall seldom or never so indulge a Favor rarely to be expected in the Course of my Work, unless in such Instances as this, where nothing but the Inspiration with which we Writers are gifted, can possibly enable any one to make the Discovery.  CHAP. VI. Mrs. Deborah is introduced into the Parish, with a Simile. A short Account of Jenny Jones, with the Difficulties and Discouragements which may attend young Women in the Pursuit of Learning.  MRS. Mrs. Deborah, having disposed of the Child according to the Will of Mrs. Deborah , now prepared to visit those Habitations which were supposed to conceal the Child Mother.  Not otherwise than when a Kite, tremendous Bird, is beheld by the feathered Generation soaring aloft, and hovering over when a Kite, tremendous Bird, is beheld by the feathered Generation soaring aloft Heads, the amorous Dove, and every innocent little Bird spread wide the Alarm, and fly trembling to their Hiding-places. He proudly beats the Air, conscious of He Dignity, and meditates intended Mischief.  So when the Approach of Mrs. Deborah was proclaimed through the Street, all the Inhabitants ran trembling into all the Inhabitants Houses, each Matron dreading lest the Visit should fall to Matron Lot. Matron with stately Steps proudly advances over the Field, aloft Matron bears Matron towering Head, filled with Conceit of Matron own Pre-eminence, and Schemes to effect Matron intended Discovery.  the Reader will not, from a Simile, imagine these poor People had any Apprehension of the Design with which Mrs. Wilkins was now coming toward these poor People; but as the great Beauty of a Simile may possibly sleep these hundred Years, till some future Commentator shall take this Work in hand, I think proper to lend the Reader a little Assistance in this Place.  It is my Intention therefore to signify, that as it is the Nature of a Kite to devour little Birds, so is it the Nature of such Persons as Mrs. Wilkins, to insult and tyrannize over little People. This being indeed the Means which they use to recompense to they they extreme Servility and Condescension to they Superiors; for nothing can be more reasonable, than that Slaves and Flatterers should exact the same Taxes on all below them, which them themselves pay to all above them.  Whenever Mrs. Deborah had had Occasion to exert any extraordinary Condescension to Miss Bridget, and by that means had a little sowered Miss Bridget natural Disposition, it was usual with Miss Bridget to walk forth among these poor People, in order to refine Miss Bridget Temper, by venting, and, as it were, purging off all ill Humors; on which Account, Mrs. Deborah was by no means a welcome Visitant; to say the Truth, Mrs. Deborah was universally hated and dreaded by them all.  On Mrs. Deborah Arrival in this Place, Mrs. Deborah went immediately to the Habitation of an elderly Matron; to whom, as an elderly Matron an elderly Matron had the good Fortune to resemble Mrs. Deborah in the Comeliness of Mrs. Deborah Person, as well as in Mrs. Deborah Age, Mrs. Deborah had generally been more favorable than to any of the rest. To Mrs. Deborah Mrs. Deborah Mrs. Deborah imparted what had happened, and the Design upon which Mrs. Deborah was come thither that Morning. These two began presently to scrutinize the Characters of the several young Girls, who lived in any of those Houses, and at last fixed their strongest Suspicion on one Jenny Jones, who their both agreed was the likeliest Person to have committed this Fact.  Jenny Jones was no very comely Girl, either in Girl Face or Person; but Nature had somewhat compensated the Want of Beauty with what is generally more esteemed by those Ladies, whose Judgment is arrived at Years of perfect Maturity; for Girl had given Girl a very uncommon Share of Understanding. This Gift Jenny had a good deal improved by Erudition. This Gift Jenny had lived several Years a Servant with a Schoolmaster, who discovering a great Quickness of Parts in the Girl, and an extraordinary Desire of Learning, (for every leisure Hour This Gift Jenny was always found reading in the Books of the Scholars) had the Goodnature, or Folly, which the Reader pleases to call it, to instruct This Gift Jenny so far, that This Gift Jenny obtained a very competent Skill in the Latin Language, and was perhaps as good a Scholar as most of the young Men of Quality of the Age. This Advantage, however, like most others of an extraordinary Kind, was attended with some small Inconveniences: For as it is not to be wondered at, that a young Woman so well accomplished should have lIttle Relish for the Society of those whom Fortune had made a young Woman so well accomplished Equals, but whom Education had rendered so much a young Woman so well accomplished Inferiors; so is it Matter of no greater Astonishment, that this Superiority in Jenny, together with that Behavior which is its certain Consequence, should produce among the others some little Envy and ill will toward a young Woman so well accomplished; and these had perhaps secretly burnt in the Bosoms of a young Woman so well accomplished Neighbors, ever since a young Woman so well accomplished Return from a young Woman so well accomplished Service.  Their Envy did not however display Their Envy openly, till poor Jenny, to the Surprise of every Body, and to the Vexation of all the young Women in these Parts, had publicly shone forth on a Sunday in a new Silk Gown, with a laced Cap, and other proper Appendages to these.  The Flame, which had before lain in Embrio, now burst forth. poor Jenny had, by poor Jenny Learning, increased poor Jenny own Pride, which none of poor Jenny were kind enough to feed with the Honor poor Jenny seemed to demand; and now, instead of Respect and Adoration, poor Jenny gained nothing but Hatred and Abuse, by poor Jenny Finery. the Parish declared poor Jenny could not come honestly by such Things; and Parents, instead of wishing their Daughters the same, felicitated their that their Children had their not.  Hence perhaps it was, that Mrs. Deborah first mentioned the Name of this poor poor Jenny to Mrs. Wilkins; but there was another Circumstance that confirmed the latter in poor Jenny Suspicion: For poor Jenny had lately been often at Mr. Allworthy's House. poor Jenny had officiated as Nurse to Miss Bridget, in a Violent Fit of Illness, and had sat up many Nights with that Lady; besides which, poor Jenny had been seen there the very Day before Mr. Allworthy's Return, by Mrs. Wilkins, though that sagacious Person had not at first conceived any Suspicion of poor Jenny on that Account: For, as poor Jenny said, 'poor Jenny had always esteemed poor Jenny as a very sober Girl, (though indeed poor Jenny knew very little of poor Jenny) and had rather suspected some of those wanton Trollops, who gave themselves Airs, because, forsooth, themselves thought themselves handsome.'  poor Jenny was now summoned to appear in Person before Mrs. Deborah, which poor Jenny immediately did. When Mrs. Deborah, putting on the Gravity of a Judge, with somewhat more than a Judge Austerity, began an Oration with the Words 'You audacious Strumpet,' in which poor Jenny proceeded rather to pass Sentence on the Prisouer, than to accuse poor Jenny.  Though Mrs. Deborah was fully satisfied of the Guilt of poor Jenny, for the Reason above shown, it is possible Mr. Allworthy might have required some stronger Evidence to have convicted Mrs. Deborah; but Mrs. Deborah saved Mrs. Deborah Accusers any such Trouble, by freely confessing the whole Fact with which Mrs. Deborah was charged.  This Confession, though delivered rather in Terms of Contrition, as it appeared, did not at all mollify Mrs. Deborah, who now pronounced a second Judgment against Mrs. Deborah, in more opprobrious Language than before; nor had it any better Success with the Bystanders, who were now grown very numerous. Many of Mrs. Deborah, who now pronounced a second Judgment against her, in more opprobrious Language than before cried out, 'Mrs. Deborah, who now pronounced a second Judgment against her, in more opprobrious Language than before thought what a new Silk Gown would end in;' others speak sarcastically of her Learning. Not a single Female was present, but found some Means of expressing Female Abhorrence of poor Jenny; who bore all very patiently, except the Malice of one Woman, who reflected upon Female Person, and tossing upon Female Nose, said, 'The Man must have a good Stomach, who would give Silk Gowns for such Sort of Trumpery.' poor Jenny replied to this, with a Bitterness which might have surprised a judicious Person, who had observed the Tranquillity with which poor Jenny bore all the Affronts to poor Jenny Chastity; but poor Jenny Patience was tired out: For this is a Virtue which is very apt to be fatigued by Exercise.  Mrs. Deborah, having succeeded beyond Mrs. Deborah hopes in Mrs. Deborah Enquiry, returned with much Triumph, and at the appointed Hour made a faithful Report to Mr. Allworthy, who was much surprised at the Relation; for he had heard of the extraordinary Parts and Improvements of this Girl, whom he intended to have given in Marriage, together with a small Living, to a neighboring Curate. he Concern therefore upon this Occasion, was at least equal to the Satisfaction which appeared in Mrs. Deborah, and to many Readers may seem much more reasonable.  Miss Bridget blessed Miss Bridget, and said, 'For Miss Bridget Part, Miss Bridget should never hereafter entertain a good Opinion of any Woman:' For poor Jenny had likewise had the Happiness of being much in poor Jenny good Graces.  The prudent Housekeeper was again dispatched to bring the unhappy Culprit before Mr. Allworthy, in order, not, as it was hoped by some and expected by all, to be sent to the House of Correction; but to receive wholesome Admonition and Reproof, which those who relish that kind of Instructive Writing, may peruse in the next Chapter.  CHAP. VII. Containing such grave Matter, that the Reader cannot laugh once through the next Chapter, unless peradventure peradventure should laugh at the Author,  WHEN poor Jenny appeared, Mr. Allworthy took poor Jenny into Mr. Allworthy Study, and spoke to poor Jenny as follows.  'You know, Child, it is in my Power, as a Magistrate, to punish you very rigorously for what you have done; and you will perhaps be the more apt to fear I should execute that Power, because you have, in a manner, laid your' Sins at my Door.  'But perhaps this is one Reason which has determined me to act in a milder Manner with you: For, as no private Resentment should ever influence a Magistrate, I will be so far from considering your having deposited the Infant in Mr. Allworthy's House, as an Aggavation of your Offense, that I will suppose, in your Favor, this to have proceeded from a natural Affection to your Child; since you might have some Hopes to see it thus better provided for, than was in the Power of yourself, or it wicked Father, to provide for it. I should indeed have been highly offended with yourself, had you exposed the little Wretch in the manner of some inhuman Mothers, who seem no less to have abandoned Mothers Humanity, than to have parted with Mothers Chastity. It is the other Part of your Offense therefore upon which I intend to admonish you, I mean the Violation of your Chastity. A Crime, however lightly treated it may be by debauched Persons, very heinous in A Crime, and very dreadful in it' Consequences.  'The heinous Nature of this Offense must be apparent to every Christian, inasmuch as it is committed in the Defiance of the Laws of our Religion, and of the express Commands of him' who founded that Religion.  'And here its Consequences may well be argued to be dreadful; for what can be more so, than to incur the divine Displeasure, by the Breach of the Divine Commands; and that in an Instance, against which the highest Vengeance is specifically' denounced.  'But these Things, though too little, I am afraid, regarded, are so plain, that Mankind, however these Things may want to be reminded, can never need Information on this Head. A Hint therefore to awaken your Sense of this Matter shall suffice; for I would inspire you with Repentance,' and not drive you to Desperation.  'There are other Consequences, not indeed so dreadful or replete with Horror as this; and yet such, as if attentively considered, must, one would think, deter all, of your Sex at least, from' the Commission of this Crime.  'For by it you are rendered infamous, and driven, like Lepers of old, out of Society; at least from the Society of all but wicked and reprobate Persons; for no other will associate with you.  'If you have Fortunes, you are hereby rendered incapable of enjoying you have Fortunes; if you have none, you are disabled from acquiring any, nay almost of procuring your Sustenance; for no Persons of Character will receive you into no Persons of Character Houses. Thus you are often driven by Necessity itself into a State of Shame and Misery, which unavoidably ends in the Destruction of both Body' and Soul.  'Can any Pleasure compensate these Evils? Can any Temptation have Sophistry and Delusion strong enough to persuade you to so simple a Bargain? Or can any carnal Appetite so overpower your Reason, or so totally lay it asleep, as to prevent your flying with Affright and Terror from a Crime which carries such Punishment always' with it.  'How base and mean must that Woman be, how void of that Dignity of Mind, and decent Pride, without which we are not worthy the Name of human Creatures, who can bear to level herself with the lowest Animal, and to sacrifice all that is great and noble in herself, all herself Heavenly Part, to an Appetite which herself has in common with the vilest Branch of the Creation! For no Woman sure, will plead the Passion of Love for an Excuse. This would be to own herself the mere Tool and Bubble of The Man. Love, however barbarously we may corrupt and pervert Love meaning, as Love is a laudable, is a rational Passion, and can never be violent, but when reciprocal; for though the Scripture bids us love we Enemies, Love means not with that servent Love, which we naturally bear toward we Friends; much less that we should sacrifice to our Friends we Lives, and what ought to be dearer to we, we Innocence. Now in what Light, but in that of an Enemy, can a reasonable Woman regard the Man, who solicits a reasonable Woman to entail on a reasonable Woman all the Misery I have above described, and who would purchase to the Man, who solicits her to entail on herself all the Misery I have above described a short, trivial, contemptible Pleasure, so greatly at a reasonable Woman Expense! For by the Laws of Custom the whole Shame, with all the Laws of Custom the whole Shame dreadful Consequences, falls entirely upon a reasonable Woman. Can Love, which always seeks the good of the Laws of Custom the whole Shame Object, attempt to betray a Woman into a Bargain, where Woman is so greatly to be the Loser? If such Corrupter, therefore, should have the Impudence to pretend to real Affection for Affection, ought not the Woman to regard the Man, who solicits her to entail on herself all the Misery I have above described, not only as an Enemy, but as the worst of all Enemies; a false, designing, treacherous, pretended Friend, who intends not only to debauch the Woman Body, but' the Woman Understanding at the same Time?  Here poor Jenny expressing great Concern, Mr. Allworthy paused a Moment, and then proceeded: I have talked thus to you, Child, not to insult you for what is past, and irrevocable, but to caution and strengthen you for the future. Nor should I have taken this Trouble, but from some Opinion of your good Sense, notwithstanding the dreadful Slip you have made; and from some Hopes of your hearty Repentance, which are founded on the Openness and Sincerity of your Confession.  If these do not deceive me, I will take care to convey you from this Scene of your Shame, where you shall, by being unknown, 'avoid the Punishment which, as I have said, is allotted to your Crime in this World, and I hope by Repentance, you will avoid the much heavier Sentence denounced against it in the other. Be a good Girl the rest of your Days, and Want shall be no Motive to your going astray: And believe me, there is more Pleasure, even in this World, in an innocent and' virtuous Life, than in one debauched and vicious.  'As to your Child, let no Thoughts concerning it, molest you; I will provide for it in a better manner than you can ever hope. And now nothing remains, but that you inform me who was the wicked Man that seduced you; for my Anger against the wicked Man that seduced you will be much greater than you have experienced upon this Occasion.'  poor Jenny now lifted poor Jenny Eyes from the Ground, and with a modest Look, and decent Voice, thus began.  'To know you, Sir, and not love your Goodness, would be an Argument of total want of Sense or Goodness in any one. In me it would amount to the highest Ingratitude, not to feel, in the most sensible manner, the great Degree of Goodness you have been pleased to exert on this Occasion. As to my Concern for what is past, I know you will spare my Blushes the Repetition. My future Conduct will much better declare my Sentiments, than any Professions I can now make. I beg leave to assure you, Sir, that I take your Advice much kinder, than your generous Offer with which you concluded it. For as you are pleased to say, Sir, it is an Instance of your Opinion of my U understanding' -- Here her Tears flowing apace, her stopped a few Moments, and then proceeded thus, 'Indeed, Sir, your Kindness overcomes me; but I will endeavor to deserve this good Opinion; for if I have the Understanding you are so kindly pleased to allow me, such Advice cannot be thrown away upon me. I thank you, Sir, heartily, for your intended Kindness to my poor helpless Child; Sir is innocent, and I hope will live to be grateful for all the Favors you shall show Sir. But now, Sir, I must on my Knees entreat you, not to persist in asking me to declare the Father of my Infant. I promise you faithfully, you shall one Day know; but I am under the most solemn Ties and Engagements of Honor, as well as the most religious Vows and Protestations, to conceal his Name at this Time. And I know you too well to think you would desire I should sacrifice either my Honor or my Religion.'  Mr. Allworthy, whom the least Mention of these sacred Words was sufficient to stagger, hesitated a Moment before he replied, and then told he replied he replied had done wrong to enter into such Engagements to a Villain; but since he replied had, he could not insist on he replied breaking Mr. Allworthy, whom the least Mention of these sacred Words was sufficient to stagger. he said, it was not from a Motive of vain Curiosity he had enquired, but in order to punish the Fellow; at least, that he might not ignorantly confer Favors on the Undeserving.  As to these Points, poor Jenny satisfied he by the most solemn Assurances, that The Man was entirely out of The Man Reach, and was neither subject to The Man Power, nor in any probability of becoming an Object of The Man Goodness.  The Ingenuity of this Behavior, had gained poor Jenny so much Credit with The Man, that The Man easily believed what poor Jenny told The Man: For as poor Jenny had disdained to excuse poor Jenny by a Lie, and had ^azarded The Man farther Displeasure in poor Jenny present Situation, rather than poor Jenny would forfeit poor Jenny Honor, or Integrity, by betraying another, The Man had but little Apprehension that poor Jenny would be guilty of Falsehood toward The Man.  The Man therefore dismissed poor Jenny with Assurances, that The Man would very soon remove poor Jenny out of the Reach of that Obloquy poor Jenny had incurred, concluding with some additional Documents, in which The Man recommended Repentance, saying, "Consider, Child, 'there is one still to reconcile yourself to, whose Favor is of much greater Importance to you than mine.'  CHAP. VIII. A Dialogue between Mesdames Bridget, and Deborah; containing more Amusement, but less Instruction than the former.  WHEN Mr. Allworthy had retired to Mr. Allworthy Study with Jenny Jones, as has been seen, Mrs. Bridget, with the good Housekeeper, had betaken Mrs. Bridget, with the good Housekeeper to a Post next adjoining to the said Study; whence, through the Conveyance of a Keyhole, Mrs. Bridget, with the good Housekeeper sucked in at Mrs. Bridget, with the good Housekeeper Ears the Instructive Lecture delivered by Mr. Allworthy, together with the Answers of poor Jenny, and indeed every other Particular which passed in the last Chapter.  This Hole in poor Jenny Brother's Study Door, was indeed as well known to Mrs. Bridget, and had been as frequently applied to by Mrs. Bridget, as the famous Hole in the Wall was by Thisbe of old. This served to many good Purposes. For by such Means Mrs. Bridget became often acquainted with Mrs. Bridget Brothers Inclinations, without giving him the Trouble of repeating them to Mrs. Bridget. It is true, some Inconveniences attended this Intercourse, and Mrs. Bridget had sometimes Reason to cry out with Thisbe, in Shakespeare, 'O wicked, wicked Wall!' For as Mr. Allworthy was a Justice of Peace, certain Things occured in Examinations concerning the Bastards, and such like, which are apt to give great Offense to the chaste Ears of Virgins, especially when the Bastards approach the Age of forty, as was the Case of Mrs. Bridget. However, Mrs. Bridget had, on such Occasions, the Advantage of concealing Mrs. Bridget Blushes from the Eyes of Men, and De non apparentibus, et non existentibus eadem est ratio. In English: 'When a Woman is not seen to blush, a Woman does not blush at all.'  Both the good Women kept strict Silence durring the whole Scene between Mr. Allworthy and the Girl; but as soon as it was ended, and that Gentleman was out of hearing, Mrs. Bridget could not help exclaiming against the Clemency of Mrs. Bridget Master, and especially against the Clemency of her Master suffering Mrs. Bridget to conceal the Father of the Child, which Mrs. Bridget swore Mrs. Bridget would have out of Mrs. Bridget before the Sun set.  At these words Mrs. Bridget discomposed Mrs. Bridget Features with a Smile; (a Thing very unusual to Mrs. Bridget) Not that I would have my Reader imagine, that this was one of those wanton Smiles, which Homer would have you conceive came from Venus, when Homer calls Mrs. Bridget the laughter-loving Goddess; nor was it one of those Smiles, which Lady Seraphina shoots from the Stage-Box, and which Venus would quit Mrs. Bridget Immortality to be able to equal. No, this was rather one of those Smiles, which might be supposed to have come from the dimpled Cheecks of the august Tysiphone, or from one of the Misses Mrs. Bridget Sisters.  With such a Smile then, and with a Voice, sweet as the Evening Breeze of Boreas in the pleasant Month of November, Mrs. Bridget gently reproved the Curiosity of Mrs. Deborah, a Vice with which it seems the latter was too much tainted, and which the former inveighed against with great Bitterness, adding, 'that among all Mrs. Bridget Faults, Mrs. Bridget thanked Heaven, Mrs. Bridget Enemies could not accuse Mrs. Bridget of prying into the Affairs of other People.'  Mrs. Bridget then proceeded to commend the Honor and Spirit with which poor Jenny had acted. Mrs. Bridget said, Mrs. Bridget could not help agreeing with Mrs. Bridget , that there was some Merit in the Sincerity of Mrs. Bridget Confession, and in Mrs. Bridget Integrity to Mrs. Bridget Lover. That Mrs. Bridget had always thought Mrs. Bridget a very good Girl, and doubted not but Mrs. Bridget had been seduced by some Rascal, who had been infinitely more to blame than Mrs. Bridget, and very probably had prevailed with Mrs. Bridget by a Promise of Marriage, or some other treacherous Proceeding.  This Behavior of Mrs. Bridget greatly surprised Mrs. Bridget; for Mrs. Bridget seldom opened Mrs. Bridget Lips either to Mrs. Bridget Master or his Sister, 'till Mrs. Bridget had first sounded their Inclinations, with which Mrs. Bridget Sentiments were always strictly consonant. Here, however, Mrs. Bridget thought Mrs. Bridget might have launched forth with Safety; and the sagacious Reader will not perhaps accuse Mrs. Bridget of want of sufficient Forecast in so doing, but will rather admire with what wonderful Celerity Mrs. Bridget tacked about, when Mrs. Bridget found Mrs. Bridget steering a wrong Course.  'Nay Madam,' said this able Woman, and truly great Politician, 'I must own I cannot help admiring the Girl's Spirit, as well as your Ladyship. And, as your 'your Ladyship says, if your Ladyship was deceived by some wicked Man, the poor Wretch is to be pitied. And to be sure, as your Ladyship your Ladyship says, the Girl has always appeared like a good, honest, plain Mrs. Bridget, and not vain of the Girl Face, forsooth, as some wanton Husseys in' the Neighborhood are.  'You say true, Deborah, said Mrs. Bridget, if the Girl the Girl had been one of those vain Trollops, of which we have too many in the Parish, I should have condemned her Brother for his Lenity toward her Brother. I saw two Farmers Daughters at Church, the other Day, with bare Necks. I protest two Farmers Daughters at Church, the other Day shocked me. If Wenches will hang out Lures for Fellows, it is no matter what two Farmers Daughters at Church, the other Day suffer. I detest such Creatures; and it would be much better for such Creatures, that such Creatures Faces had been seamed with the Smallpox; but I must confess, I never saw any of this wanton Behavior in poor Jenny; some artful a Villain, I am convinced, has betrayed, nay perhaps forced poor Jenny; and I pity the poor Wretch with all my Heart.'  Mrs. Bridget approved all these Sentiments, and the Dialogue concluded with a general and bitter Invective against Beauty, and with many compassionate Considerations for all honest, plain Girls, who are deluded by the wicked Arts of deceitful Men.  CHAP. IX. Containing Matters which will surprise the Reader.  poor Jenny returned home well pleased with the Reception poor Jenny had met with from Mr. Allworthy, whose Indulgence to poor Jenny poor Jenny industrously made public; partly perhaps as a Sacrifice to poor Jenny own Pride, and partly from the more prudent Motive of reconciling poor Jenny Neighbors to poor Jenny, and silencing their Clamours.  But though this latter View; if poor Jenny indeed had this latter View, may appear reasonable enough, yet the Event did not answer poor Jenny Expectation; for when poor Jenny was convened before the Justice, and the Event, was universally apprehended, that the House of Correction would have been poor Jenny Fate; though some of the young Women cried out, 'it was good enough for poor Jenny,' and diverted some of the young Women cried out, ' with the Thoughts of poor Jenny beating Hemp in a Silk Gown; yet there were many others who began to pity poor Jenny Condition: But when it was known in what manner Mr. Allworthy had behaved, the Tide turned against poor Jenny. One said, ''I'll assure you, poor Jenny has had good Luck.' A second cried, 'See what it is to be a Favorite.' A third,' Ay, this comes of poor Jenny Learning.' Every Person made some malicious Comment or other, on the Occasion; and reflected on the Partiality of the Justice.  The Behavior of these People, may appear impolitic, and ungrateful to the Reader, who considers the Power, and the Benevolence of Mr. Allworthy: But as to his Power, his never used his Power; and as to his , his exerted so much, that his had thereby disobliged all his Neighbors: For it is a Secret well known to great Men, that by conferring an Obligation, they do not always procure a Friend, but are certain of creating many Enemies.  poor Jenny was, however, by the Care and Goodness of Mr. Allworthy, soon removed out of the Reach of Reproach; when Malice, being no longer able to vent the Reach of Reproach Rage on Rage, began to seek another Object of the Reach of Reproach Bitterness, and this was no less than Mr. Allworthy; for a Whisper soon went abroad, that Mr. Allworthy was the Father of the foundling Child.  This Supposition so well reconciled Mr. Allworthy Conduct to the general Opinion, that the general Opinion met with universal Assent; and the Outery against Mr. Allworthy Lenity soon began to take another Turn, and was changed into an Invective against Mr. Allworthy Cruelty to the Girl. Very grave and good Women exclaimed against Men who begot Children and then disowned Children. Nor were there wanting some, who, after the Departure of poor Jenny, insinuated, that poor Jenny was spirited away with a Design too black to be mentioned, and who gave frequent Hints, that a legal Inquiry ought to be made into the whole Matter, and that some People should be forced to produce the Girl.  These Calumnies might have probably produced ill Consequences (at the least might have occasioned some Trouble,) to a Person of a more doubtful and suspicious Character than Mr. Allworthy was blessed with; but in Mr. Allworthy Case These Calumnies had no such Effect; and, being heartily despised by Mr. Allworthy, These Calumnies served only to afford an innocent Amusement to the good Gossips of the Neighborhood.  But as we cannot possibly divine what Complexion we Reader may be of, and as it will be some Time before Mr. Allworthy will hear any more of poor Jenny, we think proper to give Mr. Allworthy a very early Intimation, that Mr. Allworthy was, and will hereafter appear to be, absolutely innocent of any criminal Intention whatever. Mr. Allworthy had indeed committed no other than an Error in Politics, by tempering Justice with Mercy, and by refusing to gratify the good natured Disposition of the Mob, Whenever this Word occurs in our Writing, this Word intends Persons without Virtue, or Sense, in all Stations, and many of the highest Rank are often meant by this Word. with an Object for their Compassion to work on in the Person of poor Jenny, whom, in order to pity, their desired to have seen sacrificed to Ruin and Infamy by a shameful correction in Bridewel.  So far from complying with this their Inclination, by which all Hopes of Reformation would have been abolished, and even the Gate shut against her, if her own Inclinations should ever hereafter lead her to choose the Road of Virtue, Mr. Allworhty rather chose to encourage the Girl to return thither by the only possible Means; for too true I am afraid it is, that many Women have become abandoned, and have sunk to the last Degree of Vice by being unable to retrieve the first Slip. This will be, I am afraid, always the Case while they remain among they former Acquaintance; it was therefore wisely done by Mr. Allworthy, to remove poor Jenny to a Place where poor Jenny might enjoy the Pleasure of Reputation, after having tasted the ill Consequences of losing the ill Consequences.  To this Place therefore, wherever it was, we will wish poor Jenny a good Journey, and for the present take leave of poor Jenny, and of the little Foundling poor Jenny Child, having Matters of much higher Importance to communicate to the Reader.  CHAP. X. The Hospitality of Allworthy; with a short Sketch of the Characters of two Brothers, a Doctor, and a Captain, who were entertained by that Gentleman.  NEITHER Mr. Allworthy's House, nor Mr. Allworthy Heart, were shut against any Part of Mankind, but NEITHER Mr. Allworthy's House, nor his Heart were both more particularly open to Men of Merit. To say the Truth, this was the only House in the Kingdom where you was sure to gain a Dinner by deserving it.  Above all others, Men of Genius and Learning shared this Place in his Favor; and in these his had much Discernment: For though his had missed the Advantage of a learned Education, yet being blessed with vast natural Abilities, his had so well profited by a vigorous, though late Application to Letters, and by much Conversation with Men of Eminence in this Way, that his was his a very competent Judge in most kind of Literature.  It is no Wonder that in an Age when this kind of Merit is so little in Fashion, and so slenderly provided for, that Persons possessed of it should very eagerly flock to a Place where they were sure of being received with great Complaisance; indeed where they might enjoy almost the same Advantages of a liberal Fortune as if they were entitled to it in they own Right; for Mr. Allworthy was not one of those generous Persons, who are ready most bountifully to bestow Meat, Drink, and Lodging on Men of Wit and Learning, for which they expect no other Return but Entertainment, Instruction, Flattery, and Subserviency; in a Word, that such Persons should be enrolled in the Number of Domestics, without wearing such Persons Master's Clothes, or receiving Wages.  On the contrary, every Person in this House was perfect Master of Person own Time: and as Person might at Person Pleasure satisfy all Person Appetites within the Restrictions only of Law, Virtue and Religion; so Person might, if Person Health required, or Person Inclination prompted Person to Temperance, or even to Abstinence, absent Person from any Meals, or retire from them whenever Person was so disposed, without even a Solicitation to the contrary: For indeed such Solicitations from Superiors always favor very strongly of Commands. But all here were free from such Impertinence, not only those, whose Company is in all other Places esteemed a Favor from their Equality of Fortune, but even those whose indigent Circumstances make such an eleemosynary Abode convenient to their, and who are therefore less welcome to a great Man's Table because their stand in need of it.  Among others of this Kind was Dr. Blifil, a Gentleman who had the Misfortune of losing the Advantage of great Talents by the Obstinacy of a Father, who would breed him to a Profession him disliked. In Obedience to this Obstinacy the Doctor had in the Doctor Youth been obliged to study Physic, or rather to say the Doctor studied Physic; for in reality Books of this Kind were almost the only ones with which the Doctor was unacquainted; and unfortunately for the Doctor, the Doctor was Master of almost every other Science but that by which the Doctor was to get the Doctor Bread; the Consequence of which was, that the Doctor at the Age of Forty had no Bread to eat.  Such a Person as this was certain to find a Welcome at Mr. Allworthy's Table, to whom Misfortunes were ever a Recommendation, when they were derived from the Folly or Villainy of others, and not of the unfortunate Person himself. Besides this negative Merit, the Doctor had one positive Recommendation. This was a great Appearance of Religion. Whether his Religion was real, or consisted only in Appearance, I shall not presume to say, as I am not possessed of any Touchstone, which can distinguish the true from the false.  If this Part of the Doctor Character pleased Mr. Allworthy, it delighted Miss Bridget. Miss Bridget engaged the Doctor in many religious Controversies; on which Occasions Miss Bridget constantly expressed great Satisfaction in the Doctor's Knowledge, and not much less in the Compliments which the Doctor frequently bestowed on Miss Bridget own. To say the Truth, Miss Bridget had read much English Divinity, and had puzzled more than one of the Neighboring Curates. Indeed Miss Bridget Conversation was so pure, Miss Bridget Looks so sage, and Miss Bridget whole Deportment so grave and solemn, that Miss Bridget seemed to deserve the Name of Saint equally with Miss Bridget Namesake, or with any other Female in the Roman Calendar.  As Sympathies of all Kinds are apt to beget Love, so Experience teaches us that none have a more direct Tendency this Way than those of a religious Kind between Persons of different Sexes. the Doctor found the Doctor so agreeable to Miss Bridget, that the Doctor now began to lament an unfortunate Accident which had happened to the Doctor aboutten Years before; namely, the Doctor Marriage with another Woman, who was not only still alive, but what was worse, known to be so by Mr. Allworthy. This was a fatal Bar to that Happiness which the Doctor otherwise saw sufficient Probability of obtaining with this young Lady; for as to criminal Indulgences, the Doctor certainly never thought of criminal Indulgences. This was owing either to the Doctor Religion, as is most probable, or to the Purity of the Doctor Passion, which was fixed on those Things, which Matrimony only, and not criminal Correspondence, could put the Doctor in Possession of, or could give the Doctor any Title to.  the Doctor had not long ruminated on these Matters before these Matters recurred to the Doctor Memory that the Doctor had a Brother who was under no such unhappy Incapacity. the Doctor the Doctor made no doubt would succeed; for the Doctor discerned, as the Doctor thought, an Inclination to Marriage in this young Lady; and the Reader perhaps, when the Doctor hears the Brother's Qualifications, will not blame the Confidence which the Doctor entertained of the Doctor Success.  This that Gentleman was about 35 Years of Age. This Gentleman was of a middle Size, and what is called well built. This Gentleman had a Scar on This Gentleman Forehead, which did not so much injure This Gentleman Beauty, as it denoted This Gentleman Valor (for This Gentleman was a half-pay Officer.) This Gentleman had good Teeth, and something affable, when This Gentleman pleased, in This Gentleman Smile; though naturally This Gentleman Countenance, as well as This Gentleman Air and Voice, had much of Roughness in it, yet This Gentleman could at any Time deposite this, and appear all Gentleness and good Humor. This Gentleman was not ungenteel, nor entirely void of Wit, and in This Gentleman had abounded in Spriteliness, which, though This Gentleman had lately put on a more serious Character, This Gentleman could, when This Gentleman pleased, resume.  This Gentleman had, as well as the Doctor, an Academic Education; for This Gentleman Father had, with the same Paternal Authority we have mentioned before, decreed This Gentleman for holy Orders; but as the old Gentleman died before This Gentleman was ordained, This Gentleman chose the Church Military, and preferred the King's Commission to the Bishop's.  This Gentleman had purchased the Post of Lieutenant of Dragoons, and afterward came to be a Captain; but having quarrelled with This Gentleman Colonel, was by This Gentleman Interest obliged to sell; from which Time This Gentleman had entirely rusticated This Gentleman, had betaken This Gentleman to studying the Scriptures, and was not a little suspected of an Inclination to Methodism.  It seemed therefore not unlikely that such a Person should succeed with a Lady of so Saint-like a Disposition, and whose Inclinations were no otherwise engaged than to the married State in general; but why the Doctor, who certainly had no great Friendship for his Brother, should for Friendship Sake think of making so ill a Return to the Hospitality of Allworthy, is a Matter not so easy to be accounted for.  Is it that some Natures delight in Evil, as others are thought to delight in Virtue? Or is there a Pleasure in being accessory to a Theft when we cannot commit it we? Or Lastly, (which Experience seems to make probably) have we a satisfaction in aggrandizing we Families, even though we have not the least Love or Respect for these Motives?  Whether any of these Motives operated on the Doctor we will not determine; but so the Fact was. He sent for He Brother, and easily found Means to introduce his Brother at Allworthy's as a Person who intended only a short Visit to He.  He had not been in this House a Week before the Doctor had Reason to felicitate He on He Discernment. He He was indeed as great a Master of the Art of Love as Ovid was formerly. He had besides received proper Hints from He Brother, which He failed not to improve to the best Advantage.  CHAP. XI. Containing many Rules, and some Examples, concerning falling in love: Descriptions of Beauty, and other more prudential Inducements to Matrimony.  IT has been observed by wise Men or Women, I forget which, that all Persons are doomed to be in Love once in all Persons Lives. No particular Season is, as I remember, assigned for this; but the Age at which Miss Bridget was arrived seems to He as proper a Period as any to be fixed on for this Purpose: this Purpose often indeed happens much earlier; but when this Purpose does not, I have observed, this Purpose seldom or never fails about this Time. Moreover, we may remark that at this Season Love is of a more serious and steady Nature than what some times shows itself in the younger Parts of Life. this Season Love is uncertain, capricious, and so foolish that we cannot always discover what this young Lady would be at; nay, it may almost be doubted, whether this young Lady always knows this this young Lady.  Now we are never at a Loss to discern this in Women about Forty; for as such grave, serious and experienced Ladies well know as such grave, serious and experienced Ladies own Meaning, so it is always very easy for a Man of the least Sagacity to discover this with the utmost Certainty.  Miss Bridget is an Example of all these Observations. Miss Bridget had not been many Times in He's Company before Miss Bridget was seized with this Passion. Nor did Miss Bridget go pining and moping about this House, like a puny foolish Miss Bridget, ignorant of Miss Bridget Distemper: Miss Bridget felt, Miss Bridget knew, and Miss Bridget enjoyed, the pleasing Sensation, of which, as Miss Bridget was certain it was not only innocent but laudable, Miss Bridget was neither afraid nor ashamed.  And to say the Truth, there is in all Points, great Difference between the reasonable Passion which Women at this Age conceive toward Men, and the idle and childish Liking of a Girl to a Boy, which is often fixed on the Outside only, and on Things of little Value and no Duration; as on Cherry Cheeks, small Lily-white Hands, slow-black Eyes, flowing Locks, downy Chins, dapper Shapes, nay sometimes on Charms more worthless than these, and less the Party's own; such are the outward Ornaments of the Person, and for which Men are beholden to the Tailor, the Laceman, the Perriwigmaker, the Hatter, and the Milliner, and not to Nature. Such a Passion Girls may well be ashamed, as Such a Passion Girls generally are, to own either to Such a Passion Girls or to others.  this Season Love was of another Kind. He owed nothing to any of these Fopmakers in He Dress, nor was He Person much more beholden to Nature. Both He Dress and Person were such as, had his Dress and Person appeared in an Assembly, or a Drawing Room, would have been the Contempt and Ridicule of all the fine Ladies there. The former of these was indeed neat, but plain, coarse, ill-fancied, and out of Fashion. As for the latter, we have expressly described it above. So far was the Skin on his Cheeks from being Cherry-coloured, that you could not discern what the natural Color of his Cheeks was, his Dress and Person being totally overgrown by a black Beard, which ascended to his Eyes. his Shape and Limbs were indeed exactly proportioned, but so large, that His Shape and Limbs denoted the Strength rather of a Ploughman than any other. his Shoulders were broad, beyond all Size, and the Calves of his Legs larger than those of a common Chairman. In short, his whole Person wanted all that Elegance and Beauty, which is the very reverse of clumsy Strength, and which so agreeably sets off most of our fine Gentlemen; being partly owing to Blood, viz. Blood made of rich Sauces and generous Wines, and partly to an early Town Education.  Though Miss Bridget was a Woman of the greatest Delicacy of Taste; yet such were the Charms of He's Conversation, that Miss Bridget totally overlooked the Defects of He Person. Miss Bridget imagined, and perhaps very wisely, that Miss Bridget should enjoy more agreeable Minutes with He, than with a much prettier Fellow; and forewent the Consideration of pleasing Miss Bridget Eyes, in order to procure Miss Bridget much more solid Satisfaction.  He no sooner perceived the Passion of Miss Bridget, in which Discovery He was very quick-sighted, than He faithfully returned it. The Lady, no more than Miss Bridget Lover, was remarkable for Beauty. I would attempt to draw Miss Bridget Picture; but this is done already by a more able Master, Mr. Hogarth himself, to whom Miss Bridget sat many Years ago, and had been lately exhibited by the old Gentleman the old Gentleman in the old Gentleman Print of a Winter's Morning, of which Miss Bridget was no improper Emblem, and may be seen walking (for walk Miss Bridget does in the Print) to Covent Garden Church, with a starved Footboy behind carrying Miss Bridget Prayer Book.  He likewise very wisely preferred the more solid Enjoyments He expected with this young Lady, to the fleeting Charms of Person. He was one of those wise Men, who regard Beauty in the other Sex as a very worthless and superficial Qualification; or, to speak more truly, who rather choose to possess every Convenience of Life with an ugly Woman, than a handsome one without any of those Conveniences. And having a very good Appitite, and but little Nicety, He fancied He should play He Part very well at the matrimonial Banquet, without the Sauce of Beauty.  To deal plainly with the Reader, the Captain, ever since He Arrival, at least from the Moment He had proposed the Match to He, long before He had discovered any flattering Symptoms in Miss Bridget, had been greatly enamoured; that is to say, of Mr. Allworthy's House and Gardens, and of Mr. Allworthy Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments; of all which He was so passionately fond, that He would most probably have contracted Marriage with them, had He been obliged to have taken the Witch of Endor into the Bargain.  As Mr. Allworthy therefore had declared to the Doctor, that Mr. Allworthy never intended to take a second Wife, as Mr. Allworthy Sister was Mr. Allworthy nearest Relation, and as the Docter had fished out that Mr. Allworthy Intentions were to make any Child of Child Child Heir, which indeed the Law, without Child Interposition, would have done for Child; the Doctor and Child thought it an Act of Benevolence to give Being to a human Creature, who would be so plentifully provided with the most essential Means of Happiness. The whole Thoughts therefore of both the Brothers, were how to engage the Affections of this young Lady.  But Fortune, who is a tender Parent, and often does more for Child favorite Offspring than either her favorite Offspring deserve or wish, had been so industrious for He, that whilst he was laying Schemes to excute he Purpose, this young Lady conceived the same Desires with he, and was on Child Side contriving how to give the Captain proper Encouragement, without appearing too forward; for Child was a strict Observer of all Rules of Decorum. In this, however, Child easily succeeded; for as He was always on the Look-out, no Glance, Gesture, or Word; escaped him.  The Satisfaction which He received from the kind Behavior of Miss Bridget, was not a little abated by He Apprehensions of Mr. Allworthy; for, notwithstanding He disinterested Professions, He imagined He would, when He came to act, follow the Example of the rest of the World, and refuse He Consent to a Match, so disadvantageous in point of Interest, to his Sister. From what Oracle He received this Opinion, I shall leave the Reader to determine; but, however He came by the Reader, the Reader strangely perplexed He how to regulate He Conduct so, as at once to convey He Affection to this young Lady, and to conceal the Reader from his Brother. He, at length, resolved to take all private Opportunities of making He Addresses; but in the Presence of Mr. Allworthy to be as reserved, and as much upon Mr. Allworthy Guard as was possible; and his Conduct was highly approved by his Brother.  Mr. Allworthy soon found Means to make his Addresses, in express Terms, to Mr. Allworthy Mistress, from whom Mr. Allworthy received an Answer in the proper Form; viz. The Answer which was first made some thousands of Years ago, and which has been handed down by Tradition from Mother to Daughter ever since. If I was to translate this into Latin, I should render I was to translate this into Latin by these two Words, Nolo Episcopari; a Phrase likewise of immemorial Use on another Occasion.  He, however He came by He Knowledge, perfectly well understood this young Lady; and very soon after repeated He Application with more Warmth and Earnestness than before, and was again, according to due Form, rejected; but as He had increased in the Eagerness of He Desires, so the Lady, with the same Propriety, decreased in the Violence of this young Lady Refusal.  Not to tire the Reader, by leading He through every Scene of this Courtship, (which, though in the Opinion of a certain great Author, it is the pleasantest Scene of Life to the Actor, is perhaps as dull and tiresome as any whatever to the Audience) He made He Advances in Form, the Citadel was defended in Form, and at length, in proper Form, surrendered at Discretion.  During this whole Time, which filled the Space of near a Month, He preserved great Distance of Behavior to He , in the Presence of his Brother, and the more He succeeded with this young Lady in private, the more reserved was He in public. And as for this young Lady, this young Lady had no sooner secured her Lover, than this young Lady behaved to He before Company with the highest Degree of Indifference; so that Mr. Allworthy must have had the Insight of the Devil (or perhaps some of Mr. Allworthy worse Qualities) to have entertained the least Suspicion of what was going forward.  CHAP. XII. Containing what the Reader may perhaps expect to find in the Reader.  IN all Bargains, whether to fight, or to Marry, or concerning any other such Business, little previous Ceremony is required, to bring the Matter to an Issue, when both Parties are really in earnest. This was the Case at present, and in less than a Month the Captain and this young Lady this young Lady were Man and Wife.  The great Concern now was to break the Matter to Mr. Allworthy; and this was undertaken by the Doctor.  One Day then as Mr. Allworthy was walking in Mr. Allworthy Garden, the Doctor came to Mr. Allworthy, and with great Gravity of Aspect, and all the Concern which the Doctor could possibly affect in the Doctor Countenance, said, 'I am come, the Doctor, to impart an Affair to you of the utmost Consequence; but how shall I mention to you, what almost distracts me to think of!' the Doctor then launched forth into the most bitter Invectives both against Men and Women; accusing the former of having no Attachment but to their Interest, and the latter of being so addicted to vicious Inclinations, that their could never be safely trusted with one of the other Sex. 'Could I, said they could never be safely trusted with one of the other Sex the Doctor, have suspected, that a Lady of such Prudence, such Judgment, such Learning, should indulge so indiscreet a Passion; or could I have imagined that his Brother -- why do I call the Doctor so? the Doctor is no longer a Brother of mine. -- '  'Indeed but the Doctor is, said Allworthy, and a Brother of mine too.' -- Bless me, the Doctor, said the Doctor, do you know an Affairan Affair? -- Look'ee, Mr. Blifil, answered the good Man, it has been my constant Maxim in Life, to make the best of all Matters which happen. his Sister, though many Years younger than his Sister, is at least old enough to be at the Age of Discretion. Had the good Man imposed on a Child, I should have been more averse to have forgiven the good Man; but a Woman upwards of thirty must certainly be supposed to know what will make Woman most happy. Woman has married a Gentleman, though perhaps not quite Woman Equal in Fortune; and if the good Man has any Perfections in Woman Eye, which can make up that Deficiency, I see no Reason why I should object to Woman Choice of Woman own Happiness; which I, no more than Woman, imagine to consist only in immense Wealth. I might, perhaps, from the many Declarations I have made, of complying with almost any Proposal, have expected to have been consulted on this Occasion; but these Matters are of a very delicate Nature, and the Scruples of Modesty perhaps are not to be overcome. As to his Brother, I have really no Anger against his Brother at all. his Brother has no Obligations to me, nor do I think his Brother was under any Necessity of asking my Consent, since the Woman is, as I have said, Sui Juris, and of a proper Age to be entirely answerable only to the Woman for the Woman Conduct.'  the Doctor repeated the Doctor Accusations against his Brother, accused Mr. Allworthy of too great Lenity and declared that Mr. Allworthy should never more be brought either to see, or to own Mr. Allworthy for Mr. Allworthy Relation. Mr. Allworthy then launched forth into a Panegyric on Allworthy's Goodness, into the highest Encomiums on Mr. Allworthy Friendship; and concluded, by saying, Mr. Allworthy should never forgive Mr. Allworthy for having put the Place which Mr. Allworthy bore in his Friendship, to a hazard.  Mr. Allworthy thus answered: 'Had I conceived any Displeasure against his Brother, I should never have carried that Resentment to the Innocent: But, I assure you, I have no such Displeasure. his Brother appears to me to be a Man of Sense and Honor. I do not disapprove the Taste of his Sister; nor will I doubt but that his Sister is equally the Object of Mr. Allworthy Inclinations. I have always thought Love the only Foundation of Happiness in a married State; as Love the only Foundation of Happiness in a married State can only produce that high and tender Friendship, which should always be the Cement of this Union; and, in my Opinion, all those Marriages which are contracted from other Motives, are greatly criminal; all those Marriages which are contracted from other Motives are a Profanation of a most holy Ceremony, and generally end in Disquiet and Misery: For surely we may call it a Profanation, to convert this most sacred Institution into a wicked sacrifice to Lust, or Avarice: And what better can be said of those Matches to which Men are induced merely by the Consideration of a' beautiful Person, or a great Fortune!  'To deny that Beauty is an agreeable Object to the Eye, and even worthy some Admiration, would be false and foolish. Beautiful is an Epithet often used in Scripture, and always mentioned with Honor. It was my own Fortune to marry a Woman, whom the World thought handsome, and I can truly say, I liked Woman the better on that Account. But, to make this the sole Consideration of Marriage, to lust after this so violently, as to overlook all Imperfections for this Sake, or to require this so absolutely as to reject and disdain Religion, Virtue, and Sense, which are Qualities, in their Nature, of much higher Perfection, because an Elegance of Person only is wanting; this is surely inconsistent either with a wise Man, or a good Christian. And it is, perhaps, being too charitable to conclude that such Persons mean any thing more by such Persons Marriage, than to please such Persons carnal Appetites, for the Satisfaction' of which we are taught it was not ordained.  'In the next Place, with respect to Fortune. Worldly Prudence perhaps exacts some Consideration on this Head; nor will I absolutely and altogether condemn it. As the World is constituted, the Demands of a married State, and the Care of Posterity, require some little Regard to what we call Circumstances. Yet this Provision is greatly increased beyond what is really necessary, by Folly and Vanity, which create abundantly more Wants than Nature. Equipage for the Wife, and large Fortunes for the Children, are by Custom enrolled in the List of Necessaries; and, to procure these, every thing truly solid and sweet, and virtuous, and religious,' are neglected and overlooked.  'And this in many Degrees; the last and greatest of which seems scarce distinguishable from Madness. I mean, where Persons of immense Fortunes contract Persons of immense Fortunes to those who are, and must be, disagreeable to those who are; to Fools and Knaves, in order to increase an Estate, already larger even than the Demands of Persons of immense Fortunes Pleasures. Surely such Persons, if such Persons will not be thought mad, must own, either that such Persons are incapable of tasting the sweets of the tenderest Friendship, or that such Persons sacrifice the greatest Happiness of which such Persons are capable to the vain, uncertain, and senseless Laws of vulgar Opinion, which owe as well such Persons Force, as such Persons Foundation, to Folly.'  Here Mr. Allworthy concluded Mr. Allworthy Sermon, to which Blifil had listened with the profoundest Attention, though it cost Mr. Allworthy some pains to prevent now and then a small Discomposure of Mr. Allworthy Muscles. Mr. Allworthy now praised every Period of what Mr. Allworthy had heard, with the warmth of a young Divine who has the Honor to dine with a Bishop the same Day in which Mr. Allworthy Lordship had mounted the Pulpit.  CHAP. XIII. Which concludes the first Book, with an Instance of Ingratitude, which we hope will appear unnatural.  THE Reader, from what has been said, may imagine that the Reconciliation (if indeed THE Reader could be so called) was only Matter of Form; we shall therefore pass THE Reader over, and hasten to what must surely be thought Matter of Substance.  the Doctor had acquainted his Brother with what had past between Mr. Allworthy and the Doctor; and added with a Smile. 'I promise you, I paid you off; nay, I absolutely desired the good Gentleman not to forgive you: For you know, after the good Gentleman had made a Declaration in your Favor, I might, with Safety, venture on such a Request with a Person of the good Gentleman Temper; and I was willing, as well for your Sake as for my own, to prevent the least Possibility of a Suspicion.'  Blifil took not the least Notice of this, at that Time; but Blifil afterward made a very notable Use of it.  One of the Maxims which the Devil, in a late Visit upon Earth, left to Blifil Disciples, is, when once you are got up, to kick the Stool from under you. In plain English, when you have made your Fortune by the good Offices of a Friend, you are advised to discard your Fortune as soon you can.  Whether Blifil acted by this Maxim, I will not positively determine; so far we may confidently say, that Blifil Actions may be fairly derived from this diabolical Principle; and indeed it is difficult to assign any other Motive to any other Motive: For no sooner was he possessed of Miss Bridget, and reconciled to Allworthy, than he began to show a Coldness to he Brother, which increased daily; till at length it grew into Rudeness, and became visible to every one.  the Doctor remonstrated to he privately concerning this Behavior, but could obtain no other Satisfaction than the following plain Declaration: 'If you dislike any thing in my Brother's House, he, you know you are at Liberty to quit the following plain Declaration.' This strange, cruel, and almost unaccountable Ingratitude in Blifil, absolutely broke the poor Doctor's Heart: For Ingratitude never so thoroughly pierces the human Breast, as when the human Breast proceeds from those in whose Behalf we have been guilty of Transgressions. Reflections on great and good Actions, however they are received or returned by those in whose Favor they are performed, always administer some Comfort to us; but what Consolation shall us receive under so biting a Calamity as the ungrateful Behavior of us Friend, when us wounded Conscience at the same Time flies in us Face, and upbraids us with having spotted it in the Service of one so worthless?  Mr. Allworthy spoke to Blifil in Mr. Allworthy 's Behalf, and desired to know what Offense the Doctor had committed; when the hard-hearted Villain had the Beseness to say, that Mr. Allworthy never should forgive Mr. Allworthy for the Injury which Mr. Allworthy had endeavored to do Mr. Allworthy in Mr. Allworthy Favor; which, Mr. Allworthy said, Mr. Allworthy had pumped out of Mr. Allworthy, and was such a cruelty, that it ought not to be forgiven.  Mr. Allworthy spoke in very high Terms upon this Declaration, which, Mr. Allworthy said, became not a human Creature. Mr. Allworthy expressed, indeed, so much Resentment against an unforgiving his Temper, that Blifil at last pretended to be convinced by Blifil Arguments, and outwardly professed to be reconciled.  As for the Bride, the Bride was now in the Bride Honeymoon, and so passionately fond of the Bride new Husband, that Husband never appeared, to the Bride, to be in the wrong; and Husband Displeasure against any Person, was a sufficient Reason for the Bride Dislike to the same.  The Captain, at Mr. Allworthy's Instance, was outwardly, as we have said, reconciled to Mr. Allworthy , yet the same Rancour remained in his Brother Heart; and his Brother found so many Opportunities of giving his Brother private Hints of this, that the House at last grew insupportable to the poor Doctor; and his Brother chose rather to submit to any Inconveniences which his Brother might encounter in the World, than longer to bear these cruel and ungrateful Insults, from a Brother for whom his Brother had done so much.  his Brother once intended to acquaint Mr. Allworthy with the whole; but his Brother could not bring his Brother to submit to the Confession, by which his Brother must take to his Brother Share so great a Portion of Guilt. Besides, by how much his Brother his Brother represented his Brother to be, so much the greater would his Brother own Offense appear to Mr. Allworthy, and so much the greater, had his Brother Reason to imagine, would be his Brother Resentment.  his Brother feigned, therefore, some Excuse of Business for his Brother Departure, and promised to return soon again; and took leave of his Brother with so welldissembled Content, that, as Blifil played Blifil Part to the same Perfection, Mr. Allworthy remained well satisfied with the Truth of the Reconciliation.  the Doctor went directly to London, where the Doctor died soon of a broken Heart; a Distemper which kills more than is generally imagined, and would have a fair Title to a Place in the Bill of Mortality, did the Bill of Mortality not differ in one Instance from all other Diseases, viz. That no Physician can cure it.  Now, upon the most diligent Enquiry into the former Lives of these two Brothers, I find, besides the cursed and hellish Maxim of Policy abovementioned, another Reason for Blifil's Conduct: The Captain, besides what we have before said of Blifil, was a Man of great Pride and Fierceness, and had always treated Blifil Brother, who was of a different Complexion, and greatly deficient in both these Qualities, with the utmost Air of Superiority. the Doctor, however, had much the larger Share of Learning, and was by many reputed to have the better Understanding. Blifil knew, and could not bear. For, though Envy is at best a very malignant Passion, yet is its Bitterness greatly heightened by mixing with Contempt toward the same Object; and very much afraid I am, that whenever an Obligation is joined to these two, Indignation, and not Gratitude, will be the Product of all three.  THE HISTORY OF the Foundling. BOOK II. Containing Scenes of matrimonial Felicity in different Degrees of Life; and various other Transactions during the first two Years after the Marriage between Blifil, and Miss Bridget Allworthy.  CHAP I. Showing what Kind of a History this is; what it is like, and what it is not like.  THOUGH we have properly enough entitled this we Work, a History, and not a Life; nor an Apology for a Life, as is more in Fashion; yet we intend in it rather to pursue the Method of those Writers who profess to disclose the Revolutions of Countries, than to imitate the painful and voluminous Historian, who to preserve the Regularity of Historian Series thinks Historian obliged to fill up as much Paper with the Detail of Months and Years in which nothing remarkable happened, as Historian employs upon those Aeras when the greatest Scenes have been transacted on the human Stage.  Such Histories as these do, in reality, very much resemble a News-Paper, which consists of just the same Number of Words, whether there be any News in it or not. Such Histories may likewise be compared to a Stage Coach, which performs constantly the same Course, empty as well as full. The Writer, indeed, seems to think The Writer obliged to keep even Pace with Time, whose Amanuensis The Writer is; and, like The Writer Master, travels as slowly through Centuries of monkish Dullness, when the World seems to have been asleep, as through that bright and busy Age so nobly distinguished by the excellent Latin Poet.  "Ad confligendum venientibus undique paenis; "Omnia cum belli trepido concussa tumultu "Horrida contremuere sub altis aetheris auris: "In dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum "Omnibus humanis esset, terraque marique." Of which, we wish we could give we Reader a more adequate Translation than that by Mr. Creech.  "When dreadful Carthage frighted Rome with Arms, "And all the World was shook with fierce Alarms; "Whilst undecided yet, which Part should fall, "Which Nation rise the glorious Lord of all. Now it is we purpose in the ensuing Pages, to pursue a contrary Method. When any extraordinary Scene presents any extraordinary Scene (as we trust will often be the Case) we shall spare no Pains nor Paper to open Paper at large to our Reader; but if whole Years should pass without producing any thing worthy his Notice, we shall not be afraid of a Chasm in our History; but shall hasten on to Matters of Consequence, and leave such Periods of Time totally unobserved.  These are indeed to be considered as Blanks in the grand Lottery of Time. We therefore who are the Registers of that Lottery, shall imitate those sagacious Persons who deal in that which is drawn at Guild Hall, and who never trouble the Public with the many Blanks those sagacious Persons who deal in that which is drawn at Guild Hall dispose of; but when a great Prize happens to be drawn, the Newspapers are presently filled with the Newspapers, and the World is sure to be informed at whose Office the Newspapers was sold: Indeed commonly two or three different Offices lay claim to the Honor of having disposed of the Newspapers; by which I suppose the Adventurers are given to understand that certain Brokers are in the Secrets of Fortune, and indeed of her Cabinet-Council.  My Reader then is not to be surprised, if in the Course of this Work, he shall find some Chapters very short, and others altogether as long; some that contain only the Time of a single Day, and others that comprise Years; in a word, if my History sometimes seems to stand still, and sometimes to fly. For all which I shall not look on her as accountable to any Court of Critical Jurisdiction whatever: For as I am, in reality, the Founder of a new Province of Writing, so I am at liberty to make what Laws I please therein. And these Laws, my Readers, whom I consider as my Subjects, are bound to believe in and to obey; with which that these Laws, my Readers, whom I consider as my Subjects may readily and cheerfully comply, I do hereby assure these Laws, my Readers, whom I consider as my Subjects that I shall principally regard these Laws, my Readers, whom I consider as my Subjects Ease and Advantage in all such Institutions: For I do not, like a jure divino Tyrant, imagine that I do not, like a jure divino Tyrant are my Slaves or my Commodity. I am, indeed, set over I do not, like a jure divino Tyrant for I do not, like a jure divino Tyrant own Good only, and was created for I do not, like a jure divino Tyrant Use, and not I do not, like a jure divino Tyrant for mine. Nor do I doubt, while I make I do not, like a jure divino Tyrant Interest the great Rule of my Writings, I do not, like a jure divino Tyrant will unanimously concur in supporting my Dignity, and in rendering me all the the Honor I shall deserve or desire.  CHAP. II. Religious Cautions against showing too much Favor to Bastards; and a great Discovery made by Mrs. Deborah Wilkins.  EIGHT Months after the Celebration of the Nuptials between Blifil and Miss Bridget Allworthy, a young Lady of great Beauty, Merit, and Fortune, was Miss Bridget, by reason of a Fright, delivered of a fine Boy. a fine Boy, was indeed, to all Appearance, perfect; but the Midwife discovered, the Midwife was born a Month before the Midwife full Time.  Though the Birth of an Heir of an Heir of his beloved Sister beloved Sister was a Circumstance of great Joy to Mr. Allworthy, yet it did not alienate an Heir of his beloved Sister Affections from the little Foundling, to whom an Heir of his beloved Sister had been Godfather, had given an Heir of his beloved Sister own Name of Thomas, and whom an Heir of his beloved Sister had hitherto seldom failed of visiting at least once a Day, in an Heir of his beloved Sister Nursery.  an Heir of his beloved Sister told his beloved Sisterhis beloved Sister, if his beloved Sister pleased, the newborn Infant should be bred up together with little Tommy, to which his beloved Sister consented, though with some little Reluctance: For his beloved Sister had truly a great Complaisance for his beloved Sister Brother; and hence his beloved Sister had always behaved toward the Foundling with rather more Kindness than Ladies of rigid Virtue can sometimes bring Ladies of rigid Virtue to show to these Children, who, however, innocent, may be truly called the living Monuments of Incontinence.  Blifil could not so easily bring Blifil to bear what Blifil condemned as a Fault in Mr. Allworthy. Blifil gave Blifil frequent Hints, that to adopt the Fruits of Sin, was to give countenance to it. Blifil quoted several Texts (for Blifil was well read in Scripture) such as, Blifil visits the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children; and, the Fathers have eaten sour Grapes, and the Children's Teeth are set on edge, etc. Whence Blifil argued the Legality of punishing the Crime of the Parent on the Bastard. Blifil said, 'Tho' the Law did not positively allow the destroying such base-born Children, yet Tho' the Law held the destroying such base-born Children to be the Children of no body; that the Church considered the destroying such base-born Children as the Children of no body; and that at the best, the destroying such base-born Children ought to be brought up to the lowest and vilest Offices of the Commonwealth.'  Mr. Allworthy answered to all this and much more which Blifil had urged on this Subject, 'That however guilty the Parents might be, the destroying such base-born Children were certainly innocent. That as to the Texts Mr. Allworthy had quoted, the former of the destroying such base-born Children was a particular denunciation against the Jews for the Sin of Idolatry, of relinquishing and hating the destroying such base-born Children heavenly King; and the latter was parabolically spoken, and rather intended to denote the certain and necessary Consequences of Sin, than any express Judgment against it. But to represent the Almighty as avenging the Sins of the Guilty on the Innocent, was indecent, if not blasphemous, as it was to represent him acting against the first Principles of natural Justice, and against the original Notions of Right and Wrong, which him himself had implanted in our Minds; by which our were to judge not only in all Matters which were not revealed, but even of the Truth of Revelation itself. he himself said, he himself knew many held the same Principles with the Captain on this Head; but he himself was he himself firmly convinced to the contrary, and would provide in the same Manner for this poor Infant, as if a legitimate Child had had the Fortune to have been found in the same Place.'  While Blifil was taking all Opportunities to press these and such like Arguments to remove the little Foundling from Mr. Allworthy's, of whose Fondness for he himself he himself began to be jealous, Mrs. Deborah had made a Discovery, which in its Event threatened at least to prove more fatal to poor Tommy, than all the Reasonings of Blifil.  Whether the insatiable Curiosity of this good Woman had carried this good Woman on to that Business, or, whether this good Woman did it to confirm this good Woman in the good Graces of Mrs. Blifil, who, notwithstanding he himself outward Behavior to the Foundling, frequently abused the Infant in private, and this good Woman Brother too for he himself Fondness to it, I will not determine; but this good Woman had now, as this good Woman conceived, fully detected the Father of the Foundling.  Now as this was a Discovery of great Consequence, it may be necessary to trace it from the Fountainhead. We shall therefore very minutel^ lay open those previous Matters by which it was produced; and for that Purpose, we shall be obliged to reveal all the Secrets of a little Family, with which my our Reader is at present entirely unacquainted and of which the Economy was so rare and extraordinary, that I fear the Economy will shock the utmost Credulity of many married Persons.  CHAP. III. The Description of a domestic Government founder upon Rules directly contrary to those of Aristotle  my Reader may please to remember my Reader has been informed that Jenny Jones had live some Years with a certain Schoolmaster, who had, at Jenny Jones earnest Desire, instructed Jenny Jones in Latin, in which, to do justice to Jenny Jones Genius, Jenny Jones had so improved Jenny Jones, that Jenny Jones was become a better Scholar than Jenny Jones Master.  Indeed, though this poor Man had undertaken a Profession to which Learning must be allowed necessary, this was the least of Man Commendations. Man was one of the best-natured Fellows in the World, and was at the same time Master of so much Pleasantry and Humor that Man was reputed the Wit of the Country; and all the neighboring Gentlemen were so desirous of Gentlemen Company, that as denying was not Man Talent, Man spent much Time at all the neighboring Houses, which Man might with more Emolument have spent in Man School.  It may be imagined, that a Gentleman so qualified, and so disposed, was in no danger of becoming formidable to the learned Seminaries of Eton or Westminster. To speak plainly, Man Scholars were divided into two Classes. In the upper of which was a young Gentleman, the Son of a neighboring 'Squire, who at the Age of Seventeen was just entered into his Syntaxis; and in the lower was a second Son of the same Gentleman, who, together with several Parish-boys, was learning to read and write.  The Stipend arising hence would hardly have indulged the Schoolmaster in the Luxuries of Life, had The Stipend arising hence not added to this Office those of Clerk and Barber, and had not Mr. Allworthy added to the whole an Annuity of Ten Pound, which the poor Man received every Christmas, and with which the poor Man was enabled to cheer the poor Man Heart during that sacred Festival.  Among the poor Man other Treasures, the Pedagogue had a Wife whom the Pedagogue had married out of Mr. Allworthy's Kitchen, for Wife Fortune, viz. Twenty Pound, which Wife had there amassed.  Wife was not very amiable in Wife Person. Whether Wife sat to my Friend Hogarth, or no, I will not determine; but Wife exactly resembled WifeWife . Wife was besides a professed Follower of that notable Sect founded by Xantippe of old; by means of which, Wife became more formidable in his School than Wife Husband; for to confess the Truth, Husband was never Master there, or any where else, in Wife Presence.  Though Wife Countenance did not denote much natural Sweetness of Temper, yet this was perhaps somewhat soured by a Circumstance which generally poisons matrimonial Felicity. For Children are rightly called the Pledges of Love; and Love her Husband, though Children had been married nine Years, had given Love no such Pledges; a Default for which he had no Excuse, either from Age or Health, being not yet thirty Years old, and, what Children call a jolly, brisk, young Man.  Hence arose another Evil which produced no little Uneasiness to the poor Pedagogue, of whom Love maintained so constant a Jealousy, that he durst hardly speak to one Woman in the Parish; for the least Degree of Civility, or even Correspondence with any Female, was sure to bring he Wife upon his Wife Back, and he own.  In order to guard his Wife against matrimonial Injuries in his Wife own House, as his Wife kept one Maid Servant, his Wife always took Care to choose his Wife out of that Order of Females, whose Faces are taken as a Kind of Security for their Virtue; of which Number Jenny Jones, as the Reader has been before informed, was one.  As the Face of this good Woman might be called pretty good Security of the beforementioned Kind, and as his Wife Behavior had been always extremely modest; which is the certain Consequence of Understanding in Woman; his Wife had passed above four Years at Mr. Partridge's, (for that was the Schoolmaster's Name) without creating the least Suspicion in his Wife . Nay, his Wife had been treated with uncommon Kindness, and his Wife Mistress had permitted Mr. Partridge to give his Wife those Instructions, which have been before commemorated.  But it is with Jealousy, as with the Gout. When such Distempers are in the Blood, there is never any Security against their breaking out; and that often on the slightest Occasions, and when least suspected.  Thus it happened to Mrs. Partridge, who had submitted four Years to his Wife 's teaching this good Woman, and had suffered his Wife often to neglect his Wife Work, in order to pursue his Wife Learning. For passing by one Day, as the Girl, was reading, and his Wife leaning over his Wife, his Wife, I know not for what Reason, suddenly started up from his Wife Chair; and this was the first Time that Suspicion ever entered into the Head of his Wife .  This did not, however, at that Time, discover This, but lay lurking in his Wife Mind, like a concealed Enemy, who waits for a Reinforcement of additional Strength, before he openly declares he, and proceeds upon hostile Operations; and such additional Stength soon arrived to corroborate his Wife Suspicion: For not long after, the Husband and Wife being at Dinner, her Master said to her Master Maid, Da mihi aliquid Potum; upon which the poor Girl smiled, perhaps at the Badness of Latin, and when Girl cast Mistress Eyes on Mistress, blushed, possibly with a Consciousness of having laughed at Mistress . Mr. Partridge, upon this, immediately fell into a Fury, and discharged the Trencher on which Mr. Partridge was eating, at the Head of poor Jenny, crying out, 'You impudent Whore, do you play Tricks with my Husband before my Face?' and, at the same Instant, rose from her Chair, with a Knife in Mr. Partridge Hand, with which, most probably, Mr. Partridge would have executed very tragical Vengeance, had not the poor Girl taken the Advantage of being nearer the Door than Mr. Partridge , and avoided a Furya Fury, by running away; for, as to the poor my Husband whether Surprise had rendered my Husband motionless, or Fear (which is full as probable) had restrained my Husband from venturing at any Opposition, my Husband sat staring and trembling in my Husband ; nor did my Husband once offer to move or speak, till my Husband his Wife returning from the Pursuit of Jenny, made some defensive Measures necessary for my Husband own Preservation; and my Husband likewise was obliged to retreat, after the Example of his Maid.  Wife was, no more than Othello, of a Disposition,  -- To make a Life of Jealousy, And follow still the Changes of the Moon With fresh Suspicions -- with Wife, as well as my Husband;  -- To be once in doubt Was once to be resolved -- Wife therefore ordered Jenny immediately to pack up Wife Alls, and be gone; for that Wife was determined Wife should not sleep that Night within Wife Walls.  Mr. Partridge had profited too much, by Experience, to interpose in a Matter of this Nature. Mr. Partridge therefore had Recourse to Mr. Partridge usual Recipe of Patience; for, though Mr. Partridge was not a great Adept in Latin, Mr. Partridge remembered and well understood the Advice contained in these Words:  -- Leve fit, quod been fertur Onus. In English: 'A Burden becomes lightest, when A Burden is well borne.'  Which Mr. Partridge had always in Mr. Partridge Mouth, and of which, to say the Truth, Mr. Partridge had often Occasion to experience the Truth.  Jenny offered to make Protestations of Jenny Innocence; but the Tempest was too high for Jenny to be heard. Jenny betook Jenny to the Business of Packing, for which a small Quantity of brown Paper sufficed; and, having received Jenny small Pittance of Wages, Jenny returned home.  The Schoolmaster and Schoolmaster Consort passed The Schoolmaster and his Consort Time unpleasantly enough that Evening; but something or other happened before the next Morning, which a little abated the Fury of Mr. Partridge; and Mr. Partridge at length admitted Jenny my Husband to make her Husband Excuse. To which Jenny gave the readier Belief, as her Husband had, instead of desiring Jenny to recall Jenny, professed a Satisfaction in Jenny being dismissed, saying, Jenny was grown of little Use as a Servant, spending all Jenny time in reading, and was become, moreover, very pert and obstinate: For indeed Jenny and Jenny had lately had frequent Disputes in Literature; in which, as has been said, Jenny was become greatly her Husband Superior. This, however, her Husband would by no means allow; and, as her Husband called Jenny persisting in the Right, Obstinacy, her Husband began to hate Jenny with no small Invetracy.  CHAP. IV. Containing one of the most bloody Battles, or rather Duels, that were ever recorded in Domestic History.  FOR the Reasons mentioned in the preceding Chapter, and some other matrimonial Concessions, well known to most Husbands; and which, like the Secrets of Free Masonry, should be divulged to none who are not Members of that honorable Fraternity, Mr. Partridge was pretty well satisfied, that Mr. Partridge had condemned Mr. Partridge without Cause, and endeavored, by Acts of Kindness, to make her Husband Amends for Mr. Partridge false Suspicion. Mr. Partridge Passions were indeed, equally violent, which every Way they inclined: for, as Mr. Partridge could be extremely angry, so could Mr. Partridge be altogether as fond.  But though Her Passions ordinarily succeeded each other, and scarce twenty-four Hours ever passed in which the Pedagogue was not, in some Degree, the Object of both; yet, on extraordinary Occasions, when the Passion of Anger had raged very high, the Remission was usually longer, and so was the Case at present; for Mr. Partridge continued longer in a State of Affability, after this Fit of Jealousy was ended, than Jealousy her Husband had ever known before: And had it not been for some little Exercises, which all the Followers of Xantippe are obliged to perform daily, Mr. Partridge would have enjoyed a perfect Serenity of several Months.  Perfect Calms at Sea are always suspected by the experienced Mariner to be the Forerunners of a Storm: And I know some Persons, who, without being generally the Devotees of Superstition, are apt to apprehend, that great and unusual Peace or Tranquillity, will be attended with its opposite: For which Reason the Ancients used, on such Occasions, to sacrifice to the Goddess Nemesis; a Deity who was thought by some Persons, who, without being generally the Devotees of Superstition, are apt to apprehend to look with an invidious Eye on human Felicity, and to have a peculiar Delight in overturning it.  As we are very far from believing in anysuch Heathen Goddess, or from encouraging any Superstition, so we wish Mr. John Fr --, or some other such Philosopher, would bestir himself a little, in order to find out the real Cause of this sudden Transition, from good to bad Fortune, which has been so often remarked, and of which we shall proceed to give an Instance; for it is our Province to relate ^acts, and our shall leave Causes to Persons of much higher Genius.  Mankind have always taken great Delight in knowing and descanting on the Actions of others. Hence there have been, in all Ages, and Nations, certain, Places set apart for public Rendezvous, where the curious might meet, and satisfy these mutual Curiosity. Among these, the Barbers Shops have justly bore the Pre-eminence. Among the Greeks, Barbers News was a proverbial Expression, and Horace, in one of Horace Epistles, makes honorable Mention of the Roman Barbers in the same Light.  Those of England are known to be no wise inferior to Those of England Greek or Roman Predecessors. You there see foreign Affairs discussed in a Manner little inferior to that with which they are handled in the Coffee-houses; and domestic Occurrences are much more largely and freely treated in the former, than in the latter. But this serves only for the Men. Now, whereas the Females of this Country, especially those of the lower Order, do associate themselves much more than those of other Nations, our Polity would be highly deficient, if themselves had not some Place set apart likewise for the Indulgence of themselves Curiosity, seeing themselves are in this no way inferior to the other half of the Species.  In enjoying, therefore, such Place of Rendezvous, the British Fair ought to esteem the British Fair more happy than any of the British Fair foreign Sisters; as I do not remember either to have read in History, to have seen in my Travels, any thing of the ^^e Kind.  This Place then is no other than the Chandler's Shop; the known Seat of all the News; or, as it is vulgarly called, Gossiping, in every Parish in England.  Mr. Partridge being one Day at this Assembly of Females, was asked by one of Mr. Partridge Neighbors, if Mr. Partridge had heard no News lately of Jenny Jones. To which Mr. Partridge answered in the Negative. Upon this, the other replied, with a Smile, that the Parish was very much obliged to Mr. Partridge for having turned Jenny away as Mr. Partridge did.  Mrs. Partridge, whose Jealousy, as the Reader well knows, was long since cured, and who had no other Quarrel to Quarrel Maid, answered boldly, Quarrel did not know any Obligation the Parish had to Quarrel on that Account, for Quarrel believed Jenny had scarce left Quarrel Equal behind Jenny.  'No truly, said the Gossip, I hope not, tho'I fancy we have Sluts enough too.' 'Then you have not heard, it seems, that Quarrel has been brought to bed of two Bastards; but as she has been brought to bed of two Bastards are not born here, my Husband, and the other Overseer, says we shall not be obliged to keep my Husband, and the other Overseer.'  'Two Bastards!' answered Mr. Partridge hastily, 'you surprise me. I don't know whether we must keep my Husband, and the other Overseer; but I am sure my Husband, and the other Overseer must have been begotten here, for the Wench has not been nine Months gone away.'  Nothing can be so quick and sudden as the Operations of the Mind, especially when Hope, or Fear; or Jealousy to which the two others are but Journeymen, set it to work. it occurred instantly to Mr. Partridge, that Jenny had scarce ever been out of Jenny own House, while Jenny lived with Jenny. The leaning over the Chair, the sudden starting up, the Latin, the Smile, and many other Things rushed upon Jenny all at once. The Satisfaction Jenny expressed in the Departure of Jenny, appeared now to be only dissembled; again, in the same Instant to be real, and yet to confirm Jenny , as proceeding from Satiety, and a hundred other bad Causes. In a Word, Jenny was convinced of Jenny 's Guilt, and immediately left this Assembly of Females in Confusion.  As fair Grimalkin, who, though the youngest of the Feline Family, degenerates not in Ferosity from the elder Branches of her own House, and, though, inferior in Strength, is equal in Fierceness to the noble Tiger himself, when a little Mouse, whom it has long tormented in Sport, escapes from Jenny Clutches for a while, frets, scolds, growls, swears; but if the Trunk, or Box, behind which the Mouse lay hid, be again removed, Jenny flies like Lightning on Jenny Prey, and with envenomed wrath, bites, scratches, mumbles and tears the little Animal.  Not with less Fury did Mr. Partridge fly on the Pedagogue. Mr. Partridge Tongue, Teeth, and Hands, fell all upon Hands at once. Hands Wig was in an Instant torn from His Wig Head, His Wig Shirt from His Wig Back, and from His Wig Face descended five Streams of Blood, denoting the Number of Claws with which Nature had unhappily armed the Enemy.  Mr. Partridge acted for some Time on the defensive only; indeed Mr. Partridge attempted only to guard his Face his Face with Mr. Partridge Hands; but as Mr. Partridge found that Mr. Partridge Antagonist abated nothing of Antagonist Rage, Mr. Partridge thought Antagonist might, at least, endeavor to disarm Antagonist, or rather to confine Antagonist Arms; in doing which, Antagonist Cap fell off in the Struggle, and Antagonist Hair being too short to reach Antagonist Shoulders, erected her Shoulders on Antagonist Head; Antagonist Stays likewise, which were laced through one single Hole at the Bottom, burst open, and Antagonist Breasts, which were much more redundant than her Hair, hung down below Antagonist middle; Antagonist his Face was likewise marked with the Blood of Antagonist ; Antagonist Teeth gnashed with Rage; and Fire, such as sparkles from a Smith's Forge, darted from Antagonist Eyes. So that, altogether, this Amazonian Heroine might have been an Object of Terror to a much bolder Man than Mr. Partridge.  Mr. Partridge had at length, the good Fortune, by getting Possession of her Arms, to render those Weapons, which Antagonist wore at the Ends of Antagonist Fingers, useless; which Antagonist no sooner perceived, than the Softness o^ Antagonist Sex prevailed over her RageRage, and Antagonist presently dissolved in Tears, which soon after concluded i^ a Fit.  That small Share of Sense which Mr. Partridge had hitherto preserved through this Scene of Fury of the Cause of which Mr. Partridge was hitherto ignorant, now utterly abandoned Mr. Partridge. Mr. Partridge ran instantly into the Street, hollowing out, that Mr. Partridge Wife was in the Agonies of Death, and beseeching the Neighbors to fly with the utmost Haste to his Wife Assistance. Several good Women obeyed Mr. Partridge Summons, who entering her own House, and applying the usual Remedies on such Occasions, Mr. Partridge was, all length, to the great Joy of Mr. Partridge , brought to Mr. Partridge.  As soon as Mr. Partridge had a little recollected Mr. Partridge Spirits and somewhat composed Mr. Partridge with a Cordial, Mr. Partridge began to inform the Company of the manifold Injuries Mr. Partridge had received from Mr. Partridge Husband; who, Mr. Partridge said, was not content to injure Mr. Partridge in Mr. Partridge Bed; but, upon Mr. Partridge upbraiding him with it, had treated Mr. Partridge in the cruelest Manner imaginable; had tore Mr. Partridge Cap and Hair from her Head, and Mr. Partridge Stays from Mr. Partridge Body, giving Mr. Partridge, at the same Time, several Blows, the Marks of which Mr. Partridge should carry to the Grave.  The poor Man, who bore on his Face his Face many ^ore visible Marks of the Indignaion of his , ^od in silent Astonishment at this Accusation; which the Reader will, I believe, bear Witness for ^^m, had greatly exceeded the Truth; for indeed Witness had not struck her once; and this Silence being ^^terpreted to be a Confession of the Charge, by the whole Court, they all began at once, una voce, to ^ebuke and revile Witness, repeating often, that none at a Coward ever struck a Woman.  Mr. Partridge bore all this patiently; but when is his Wife appealed to the Blood on his Wife , as an Evidence of Mr. Partridge Barbarity, Mr. Partridge could not help laying ^laim to Mr. Partridge own Blood, for so it really was: as ^e thought it very unnatural, that this should rise up (as we are taught that of a murdered Person often does) in Vengeance against Person.  To this Several good Women made no other Answer, man that it was Pity it had not come from his Heart, instead of his ; all declaring, that if all Husbands should lift Husbands his Hands against Husbands, Husbands would have Husbands Heart's Blood out of Husbands Bodies.  After much Admonition for what was past, and much good Advice to Mr. Partridge for Mr. Partridge future Behavior, the Company, at length, departed, and often the Husband and Wife to a personal Conference together, in which Mr. Partridge soon learned the Cause of all Mr. Partridge Sufferings.  CHAP. V. Containing much Matter to exercise the Judgment and Reflection of the Reader.
