have minded what the Parson says,' cries the eldest, 'and not a harkened after Men Voke.'
'Indeed, Child, and so Child had,' says the Mother sobbing, 'the Mother has brought a disgrace upon us all.
the Mother Is the vurst of the Vamily that ever was a Whore.'
You need not upbraid me with that, the Mother, cries Molly, 'you yourself was brought to-bed of Sister there within a Week after you was married,' 'Yes, Hussy,' answered the Motherthe Mother, 'so I was, and what was the mighty Matter of that?
I was made an honest Woman then; and if you was to be made an honest Woman I should not be angry; but you must have to doing with a Gentleman, you nasty Slut, you will have a Bastard, Hussy, you will; and that I defy any one to say of me.'
In this Situation Black George found his Family, when his came home for the Purpose before mentioned.
As his Wife and three Daughters were all of his Wife and three Daughters talking together, and most of his Wife and three Daughters crying, it was some time before his could get an Opportunity ^f being heard; but as soon as such an Interval occurred, acquainted the Company with what Sophia had said to his.
Goody Seagrim then began to revile Goody Seagrim Daughter afresh.
'Here,' says Goody Seagrim, 'you have brought us into a fine Quandary indeed.
What will Madam say to that big Belly?
Oh that ever I should live to see this Day.
Goody Seagrim answered with great Spirit, 'And what is this mighty Place which you have got for me, Father?'
(for he had not well understood the Phrase ^^sed by Sophia of being about Sophia Person) 'I suppose it is to be under the Cook; but I shall not wash Dishes for any Body.
My Gentleman will provide better for My Gentleman.
See what My Gentleman has given me this Afternoon; My Gentleman has promised I shall never want Money; and you shall not want Money neither, Mother, if you will hold your Tongue, and know when you are well.'
And so saying, Mother pulled out several Guineas, and gave Mother Mother one of several Guineas.
Mother no sooner felt the Gold within Mother Palm, than Mother Temper began (such is the Efficacy of that Panacea) to be mollified.
'Why Husband,' says Mother, 'would any but such a Blockhead as you not have enquired what Place this was before Husband had accepted this!
Perhaps, as Molly says, it may be in the Kitchen, and truly I don't care Mother Mother should be a Scullion Wench: For poor as I am, I am a Gentlewoman.
And thof I was obliged, as my Father, who was a Clergyman died worse than nothing, and so could not give me a Shilling of Potion, to undervalue Mother, by marrying a poor Man, yet I would have you to know, I have a Spirit above all my Father, who was a Clergyman Things.
Marry come up, it would better become Madam Western to look at Home, and remember who Marry own Grandfather was.
Some of my Family, for ought I know, might ride in Some of my Family Coaches, when the Grandfathers of some Voke walked a-voot.
I warrant Marry fancies Marry did a mighty Matter, when Marry sent us that old Gownd; some of my Family would not have picked up such Rags in the Streets; but poor People are always trampled upon.
-- The Parish need not have been in such a Fluster with Molly.
-- You might have told some of my Family, Child, your Grandmother wore better Things new out of the Shop.'
'Well but, consider,' cried George, 'What Answer shall I make to Madam?'
'I don't know what Answer,' says Marry, 'You are always bringing my Family into one Quandary or other.
Do you remember when you shot the Partridge, the Occasion of all our Misfortunes?
Did not I advise you never to go into Squire Western's Manor?
Did not I tell you many a good Year ago what would come of it?
but you would have your own headstrong Ways; yes, you would, you Villain -- '  George was, in the main, a peaceable kind of Fellow, and nothing choleric, nor rash, yet did George bear about George something of what the Ancients called the Irascible, and which George Wife, if his Wife had been endowed with much Wisdom, would have feared.
George had long experienced, that when the Storm grew very high Arguments were but Wind, which served rather to increase than to abate it.
George was therefore seldom unprovided with a small Switch, a Remedy of wonderful Force, as George had often essayed, and which the Word Villain served as a Hint for George applying.
No sooner, therefore, had this Symptom appeared, than George had immediate Recourse to the said Remedy, which though, as it is usual in all very efficacious Medicines, it at first seemed to heighten and inflame the Disease, soon produced a total Calm, and restored the Patient to perfect Ease and Tranquillity.
This is, however, a kind of Horse-medicine, which requires a very robust Constitution to digest, and is therefore only proper for the Vulgar, unless in one single Instance, viz.
where Superiority of Birth breaks out; in which Case, we should not think it very improperly applied by any Husband whatever, if the Application was not, in the Application was not so base, that, like certain Applications of the Physical Kind which need not be mentioned, it so much degrades and contaminates the Hand employed in it, that no Gentleman should endure the Thought of any Thing so low and detestable.
The whole Family were soon reduced to a State of perfect Quiet: For the Virtue of this Medicine, like that of Electricity, is often communicated through one Person to many others, who are not touched by the Instrument.
To say the Truth, as they both operate by Friction, it may be doubted whether there is not something analogous between they both, of which Mr. Freke would do well to enquire before Mr. Freke publishes the next Edition of Mr. Freke Book.
A Council was now called, in which, after many Debates, Molly still persisting that Molly would not go to Service, it was at length resolved, that Goody Seagrim herself should wait on Miss Western, and endeavor to procure the Place for Molly elder Daughter, who declared great Readiness to accept great Readiness; but Fortune, who seems to have been an Enemy of this little Family, afterward put a Stop to Molly Promotion.

A Story told by Mr. Supple, the Curate.
The Penetration of Squire Western.
His great Love for His Daughter, and the Return to it made by his Daughter.
THE next Morning Tom Jones hunted with Squire Western, and was at THE next Morning Tom Jones Return invited by that Gentleman to Dinner.
his Daughter shone forth that Day with more Gaiety and Sprightliness than usual.
his Daughter Battery was certainly levelled at our Hero; though, I believe, his Daughter scarce yet knew his Daughter own Intention; but if his Daughter had any Design of charming him, his Daughter now succeeded.
Mr. Supple, the Curate of Mr. Allworthy's Parish, made one of the Company.
him was a goood-natured worthy Man; but chiefly remarkable for him great Taciturnity at Table, though him Mouth was never shut at it.
In short, him had one of the best Appetites in the World.
However, the Cloth was no sooner taken away, than him always made sufficient Amends for him Silence: For him was a very hearty Fellow; and him Conversation was often entertaining, never offensive.
At him first Arrival, which was immediately before the Entrance of the Roast-beef, him had given an Intimation that him had brought some News with him, and was beginning to tell, that him came that Moment from Mr. Allworthy's, when the Sight of the Roastbeef, struck him dumb, permitting him only to say Grace, and to declare him must pay him Respect to the Baronet: For so him called the Sirloin.
When Dinner was over, being reminded by his Daughter of Dinner News, Dinner began as follows, 'I believe, Lady, your Ladyship observed a young Woman at Church yesterday at Even-song, who was dressed in one of your outlandish Garments; I think I have seen your Ladyship in such a one.
However, in the Country, such Dresses are  Raro avis in Terris, nigroque simillima Cycno, That is, Madam, as much as to say,  'A rare Bird upon the Earth, and very like a' black Swan.
'The Verse is in Juvenal: but to return to what I was relating.
I was saying such Garments are rare Sights in the Country, and perchance too, it was thought the more rare, Respect being had to the Person who wore it, who, such Garments tell me, is the Daughter of George, your Worship's Gamekeeper, whose Sufferings I should have opined, might have taught George more Wit than to dress forth George Wenches in such gaudy Apparel.
She created so much Confusion in the Congregation, that if Squire Allworthy had not silenced it, it would have interrupted the Service: For I was once about to stop in the Middle of the first Lesson.
Howbeit, nevertheless, after Prayer was over, and I was departed home, this occasioned a Battle in the Churchyard, where, amongst other Mischief, the Head of a traveling Fiddler was very much broken.
This Morning a traveling Fiddler came to Squire Allworthy for a Warrant, and the Wench was brought before Squire Allworthy.
Squire Allworthy was inclined to have compounded Matters; when, lo!
on a sudden, the Wench appeared (I ask your Ladyship Pardon) to be, as the Wench were at the Eve of bringing forth a Bastard.
Squire Allworthy Squire Allworthy demanded of Squire Allworthy who was the Father; but Squire Allworthy pertinaciously refused to make any Response.
So that Squire Allworthy was about to make Squire Allworthy Mittimus to Bridewel,' when I departed.'
'And is a Wench having a Bastard all your News, Doctor?
cries Western.
'I thought it might have been some public Matter, something about the Nation.'
'I am afraid it is too common, indeed,' answered the Parson, 'but I thought X.
A Story altogether deserved commemorating.
As to National Matters, your Worship knows your Worship best.
My Concerns extend no farther than The Parish.'
'Why ay,' says Squire AllworthySquire Allworthy.'
'I believe I do know a little Matter, as you say; but come, Tommy, drink about, the Bottle stands with Squire Allworthy.'
Tom begged to be excused, for that Tom had particular Business; and getting up from Table, escaped the Clutches of Squire Allworthy who was rising to stop Tom, and went off with very little Ceremony.
Squire Allworthy Squire Allworthy gave Squire Allworthy a good Curse at Squire Allworthy Departure; and then turning to the Parson, Squire Allworthy cried out, 'I smoke it, I smoke it.
Tom is certainly the Father.'
'Zooks, the Parson, you remember how the Parson recommended the Veather o'her to the Parson -- d -- n un, what a sly B -- ch it is.
Ay ay, as sure as Twopence, Tom is Veather of this Bastard.'
'I should be very sorry for that,' says the Parson.
'Why sorry, cries Squire Allworthy, Where is the mighty Matter o't?
What I suppose, do pretend that thee have never got a Bastard?
Pox!
more good Luck's thine: for I warrant have done therefore many's the good Time and often.
'your Worship is pleased to be jocular,' answered the Parsonthe Parson, but I do not only animadvert on the Sinfulness of the Action, though that surely is to be greatly deprecated; but I fear the Parson Unrighteousness may injure the Parson with Squire Allworthy.
And truly I must say, though his Unrighteousness has the Character of being a little wild, I never saw any Harm in the young Man; nor can I say I have heard any, save what your Worship now mentions.
I wish, indeed his Unrighteousness was a little more regular in his Unrighteousness Responses at Church; but altogether his Unrighteousness seems.'
'Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris.
'That is a classical Line, young Lady, and being rendered into English, is, a A Lad of an ingenuous Countenance and of an ingenuous Modesty: For this was a Virtue in great Repute both among the Latins and Greeks.
I must say the young Gentleman (for so I think I may call the young Gentleman (, notwithstanding the young Gentleman ( Birth) appears to me a very modest, civil Lad, and I should be sorry that the young Gentleman ( should do the young Gentleman ( any Injury in Squire Allworthy Opinion.'
'Poogh!
says Squire Allworthy, 'Injury with Squire Allworthy!
Why Squire Allworthy loves a Wench himself.
Does not all the Country know whose Son Tom is?
You must talk to another Person in that Manner.
I remember Squire Allworthy.'
'I thought,' said the Parson, 'the Parson had never been at the University.'
'Yes, yes, the Parson was,' says Squire Allworthy, 'and many a Wench have we two had together.
As errant a Whoremaster as any within five Miles o'un.
No, no.
It will do'n no Harm with he, assure yourself, or with any Body else.
Ask Sophy there -- You have not the worse Opinion of a young Fellow for getting a Bastard, have you, Girl?
No, no, the Women will like un the better for it.'
This was a cruel Question to his Daughterhis Daughter.
his Daughter had observed Tom's Color change at the Parson's Story; and that, with his hasty and abrupt Departure, gave his Daughter sufficient Reason to think his Daughter Father's Suspicion not groundless.
his Daughter Heart now, at once, discovered the great Secret to his Daughter, which had been so long disclosing by little and little; and his Daughter found his Daughter highly interested in this Matter.
In such a Situation, her Father's malapert Question rushing suddenly upon his Daughter, produced some Symptoms which might have alarmed a Suspicious Heart; but to do the Squire Justice, that was not the Squire Justice Fault.
When his Daughter rose therefore from his Daughter Chair, and told the Squire Justice, a Hint from the Squire Justice was always sufficient to make his Daughter withdraw, the Squire Justice suffered his Daughter to leave the Room; and then with great Gravity of Countenance remarked, 'that it was better to see a Daughter over-modest, than over forward;' a Sentiment which was highly applauded by the Parson.
There now ensued between the Squire and the Parson, a most excellent political Discourse, framed out of Newspapers, and political Pamphlets,; in which political Pamphlets made a Libation of four Bottles of Wine to the Good of political Pamphlets Country; and then, Squire Allworthy being fast asleep, the Parson lighted Parson Pipe, mounted Parson Horse, and rode home.
When Squire Allworthy Squire Allworthy had finished Squire Allworthy Half-hour's Nap, Squire Allworthy summoned Squire Allworthy Daughter to his Daughter Harpsichord; but his Daughter begged to be excused that Evening, on Account of a violent Headache.
This Remission was presently granted: For indeed his Daughter seldom had Occasion to ask Squire Allworthy twice, as Squire Allworthy loved his Daughter with such ardent Affection, that by gratifying his Daughter, Squire Allworthy commonly conveyed the highest Gratification to Squire Allworthy.
his Daughter was really what Squire Allworthy frequently called his Daughter, Squire Allworthy little Darling; and his Daughter well deserved to be so: For his Daughter returned all Squire Allworthy Affection in the most ample Manner.
his Daughter had preserved the most inviolable Duty to Squire Allworthy in all Things; and this his Daughter Love made not only easy, but so delightful, that when one of his Daughter Companions laughed at his Daughter for placing so much Merit in such scrupulous Obedience, as that young Lady called it, his Daughter answered, 'You mistake me, his Daughter, if you think I value his Daughter upon this Account: For besides that I am barely discharging my Duty, I am likewise pleasing his Daughter.
I can truly say, I have no Delight equal to that of contributing to my Father's Happiness; and if I value his Daughter, my Dear, it is on having this Power, and not on executing it.'
This was a Satisfaction, however, which his Daughter his Daughter was incapable of tasting this Evening.
his Daughter therefore not only desired to be excused from the Attendance at her Harpsichord, but likewise begged that he would suffer his Daughter to absent his Daughter from Supper.
To this Request likewise Squire Allworthy Squire Allworthy agreed, though not without some Reluctance; for Squire Allworthy scarce ever permitted his Daughter to be out of Squire Allworthy Sight, unless when Squire Allworthy was engaged, with Squire Allworthy Horses, Dogs, or Bottle.
Nevertheless Squire Allworthy yielded to the Desire of his Daughter, though the poor Man was, at the same Time, obliged to avoid Squire Allworthy own Company, (if I may so express the poor Man) by sending for a neighboring Farmer to sit with Farmer.
CHAP.
XI.
The narrow escape of Molly Seagrim, with some Observations for which we have been forced to dive pretty deep into Nature.
Tom JONES had ridden one of Mr. Western's Horses that Morning in the Chase: so that having no Horse of TOM JONES own in Squire Allworthy's Stable, TOM JONES was obliged to go home on Foot.
This TOM JONES did so expeditiously; that TOM JONES ran upwards of three Miles within the half Hour.
Just as TOM JONES arrived at Squire Allworthy's outward Gate, TOM JONES met the Constable and Company, with Molly in their Possession, whom their were conducting to that House where the inferior Sort of People may learn one good Lesson, viz.
Respect and Deference to their Superiors.
Since it must show them the wide Distinction Fortune intends between those Persons who are to be corrected for them Faults, and those who are not; which Lesson, if them do not learn, I am afraid, them very rarely learn any other good Lesson, or improve them Morals, at the House of Correction.
A Lawyer may, perhaps, think Squire Allworthy exceeded A Lawyer Authority a little in this Instance.
And, to say the Truth, I question, as here was no regular Information before A Lawyer, whether A Lawyer Conduct was strictly regular.
However, as A Lawyer Intention was truly upright, A Lawyer ought to be excused in Foro Conscientiae, since so many arbitrary Acts are daily committed by Magistrates, who have not this Excuse to plead for Magistrates, who have not this Excuse to plead for themselves.
Tom was no sooner informed by the Constable and Company, whither they were proceeding, (indeed Tom pretty well guessed it of Tom) than Tom caught Molly in Tom Arms, and embracing Molly tenderly before them all, swore Tom would murder the first Man who offered to lay hold of Molly.
Tom bid Molly dry Molly Eyes, and be comforted; for wherever Molly went, Tom would accompany Molly.
Then turning to the Constable, who stood trembling with Tom Hat off, Tom desired Tom, in a very mild Voice, to return with Tom for a Moment only to Tom Father, (so Tom now called Squire Allworthy) for Tom durst, Tom said, be assured, that when Tom had alleged what Tom had to say in Molly Favor, Molly would be discharged.
The Constable, who, I make no Doubt, would have surrendered Tom Prisoner, had Tom demanded Molly, very readily consented to this Request.
So back they all went into Squire Allworthy's Hall; where Tom desired they all to stay till Tom Return, and then went Tom in pursuit of the Good Man.
As soon as Tom was found, Tom threw Tom at Tom Feet, and having begged a patient hearing, confessed Tom to be the Father of the Child, of which Molly was then big.
Tom entreated Tom to have Compassion on Molly, and to consider, if there was any Guilt in the Case, there was any Guilt in the case lay principally at Tom Door.
'If there is any Guilt in the Case!'
answered Squire Allworthy warmly, 'are you then so profligate and so abandoned a Libertine, to doubt whether the breaking the Laws of God and Man, the corrupting and ruining a poor Girl, by Guilt?
I own, indeed, it does lie principally upon you, and so heavy it is, that you ought to expect it should crush you.'
'Whatever may be my Fate, says Tom, let me succeed in my Intercessions for Molly.
I consess I have corrupted Molly; but whether Molly shall be ruined depends on Tom.
For Heaven's Sake, Sir, revoke your Warrant, and do not send Molly to a Place which must unavoidably prove Molly Destruction.'
Squire Allworthy bid him immediately call a Servant.
Tom answered, there was no Occasion; for Tom had luckily met them at the Gate, and relying upon Tom Goodness, had brought them back into Tom Hall, where them now waited Tom final Resolution, which, upon Tom Knees, Tom besought Tom might be in Favor of Molly; that Molly might be permitted to go home to Molly Parents, and not be exposed to a greater Degree of Shame and Scorn than must necessarily fall upon Molly.
'I know, said Tom, that is too much, I know I am the wicked Occasion of it.
I will endeavor to make amends, if possible; and if you shall have hereafter the Goodness to forgive me, I hope I shall deserve it.'
Squire Allworthy hesitated some Time, and at last said, 'Well, I will discharge my Mittimus.
-- You may send the Constable and Company to the Constable and Company.'
the Constable and Company was instantly called, discharged, and so was Molly.
It will be believed, that Squire Allworthy failed not to read Tom a very severe Lecture on Occasion; but it is unnecessary to insert it here, as we have faithfully transcribed what Squire Allworthy said to Jenny Jones in the first Book, most of which may be applied to the Men, equally with the Women.
So sensible an Effect had these Reproofs on the young Man, who is no hardened Sinner, that this worthy Man retired into this worthy Man own Room, where this worthy Man passed the Evening alone in much melancholy contemplation.
Squire Allworthy was sufficiently offended by this Transgression of TOM JONES; for notwithstanding the Assertions of Mr. Western, it is certain this worthy Man had never indulged this worthy Man in any loose Pleasures with Women, and greatly condemned the Vice of Incontinence in others.
Indeed, there is much Reason to imagine, that there was not the least Truth in what Mr. Western affirmed, especially as this worthy Man laid the Scene of those Impurities at the University, where Squire Allworthy had never been.
In fact, Squire Allworthy was a little too apt to indulge that Kind of Pleasanty which is generally called Rhodomontade; but which may, with as much Propriety, be expressed by a much shorter Word; and, perhaps, we too often supply the Use of this little Monosyllable by others; since very much of what frequently passes in the World for Wit and Humor, should, in the strictest Purity of Language, receive that short Appellation, which, in Conformity to the well-bred Laws of Custom, I here suppress.
But whatever Squire Allworthy had to this or to any other Vice, Squire Allworthy was not so blinded by this, but that Squire Allworthy could discern any Virtue in the guilty Person, as clearly indeed, as if there had been no Mixture of Vice in the same Character.
While Squire Allworthy was angry therefore, with the Incontinence of TOM JONES, Squire Allworthy was no less pleased with the Honor and Honesty of Squire Allworthy Self-accusation.
Squire Allworthy began now to form in Squire Allworthy Mind the same Opinion of this young Fellow which we hope we Reader may have conceived.
And in ballancing Squire Allworthy Faults with Squire Allworthy Perfections, the latter seemed rather to preponderate.
It was to no Purpose, therefore, that Thwackum, who was immediately charged by Mr. Blifl with the Story, unbended all Mr. Blifl Rancour against TomTom.
Squire Allworthy gave a patient Hearing to these Invectives, and then answered coldly: 'That young Men of Tom's Complexion were too generally addicted to Vice; but Vice believed that Youth was sincerely affected with what Vice had said to Vice on Occasion, and Vice hoped Vice would not transgress again.'
So that, as the Days of whipping were at an End, the Tutor had no other Vent but the Tutor own Mouth for the Tutor Gall, the usual poor Resource of impotent Revenge.
But Square, who was a less violent, was a much more artful Man; and as a much more artful Man hated TOM JONES more, perhaps, than Thwackum himself, so a much more artful Man contrived to do a much more artful Man more Mischief in the Mind of Squire Allworthy.
The Reader must remember the several little Incidents of the Partridge, the Horse, and the Bible, which were recounted in the second Book.
By all which TOM JONES had rather improved than injured the Affection which Squire Allworthy was inclined to entertain for Squire Allworthy.
The same, I believe, must have happened to Squire Allworthy with every other Person who has any Idea of Friendship, Generosity, and Greatness of Spirit; that is to say, who has any Traces of Goodness in his Mind.
Square himself was not unacquainted with the true Impression which those several Instances of Goodness had made on the excellent Heart of Squire Allworthy; for the Philosopher very well knew what Virtue was, though the Philosopher was not always, perhaps, steady in Square himself Pursuit; but as for Thwackum himself, from what Reason I will not determine, no such Thoughts ever entered into the Philosopher Head.
the Philosopher saw TOM JONES in a bad Light, and the Philosopher imagined Squire Allworthy saw TOM JONES in the same, but that TOM JONES was resolved, from Pride and Stubbornness of Spirit, not to give up the Boy whom TOM JONES had once cherished, since, by so doing, TOM JONES must tacitly acknowledge that TOM JONES former Opinion of TOM JONES had been wrong.
Square therefore embraced this Opportunity of injuring TOM JONES in the tenderest Part, by giving a very bad Turn to all these beforementioned Occurrences.
'I am sorry, Sir, said Sir, 'to own I have been deceived as well as Sir.
I could not, I confess, help being pleased with what I ascribed to the Motive of Friendship, though it was carried to an Excess, and all Excess is faulty, and vicious; but in this I made Allowance for Youth.
Little did I suspect that the Sacrifice of Truth, which we both imagined to have been made to Friendship, was, in reality, a Prostitution of it to a depraved and debauched Appetite.
You now plainly see whence all the seeming Generosity of this young Man to the Family of the Game-keeper proceeded.
this young Man supported the Father in order to corrupt the Daughter, and preserved the Family of the Game-keeper from starving, to bring one of the Family of the Game-keeper to Shame and Ruin.
This is Friendship!
this is Generosity!
As Sir Richard Steel says, Gluttons who give high Prices for Delicacies, are very worthy to be called generous.
In short, I am resolved, from this Instance, never to give Way to the Weakness of Human Nature more, nor to think any thing Virtue which does not exactly quadrate with the unerring Rule of Right.'
The Goodness of Squire Allworthy had prevented those Considerations from occurring to The Goodness of Allworthy; yet were those Considerations too plausible to be absolutely and hastily rejected, when laid before The Goodness of Allworthy Eyes by another.
Indeed what Square had said sunk very deeply into The Goodness of Allworthy , and the Uneasiness which it there created was very visible to the other; though the good Man would not acknowledge this, but made a very slight Answer, and forcibly drove off the Discourse to some other Subject.
It was well, perhaps, for TomTom, that no such Suggestions had been made before the good Man was pardoned; for they certainly stamped in the Mind of Squire Allworthy the first bad Impression concerning TOM JONES.
CHAP.
XII.
Containing much clearer Matters; but which flow from the same Fountain with those in the preceding Chapter.
The Reader will be pleased, I believe, to return with me to Sophia.
Sophia passed the Night, after we saw Sophia last, in no very agreeable Manner.
Sleep befriended Sophia but little, and Dreams less.
In the Morning, when Mrs.
Honor Sophia Maid attended Sophia, at the usual Hour, Sophia was found already up and dressed.
Persons who live two or three Miles Distance in the Country are considered as next Door Neighbors, and Transactions at the one House fly with incredible Celerity to the other.
Mrs.
Honor her Maid, therefore, had heard the whole Story of Molly's Shame; which Molly, being of a very communicative Temper, had no sooner entered the Apartment of Sophia Mistress, than Sophia began to relate in the following Manner.
'La Ma'am, what does your La'ship think?
the Girl that your La'ship saw at Church on Sunday, whom you thought so handsome; though you would not have thought Sophia so handsome neither, if you had seen Sophia nearer; but to be sure Sophia has been carried before the Justice for being big with Child.
Sophia seemed to me to look like a confident Slut; and to be sure Sophia has laid Child to young TOM JONES.
And all the Parish says Squire Allworthy is so angry with TOM JONES, that Squire Allworthy will not see Squire Allworthy.
To be sure, one cannot help pitying the poor young Man, and yet Squire Allworthy does not deserve much Pity neither, for demeaning Squire Allworthy with such Kind of Trumpery.
Yet Squire Allworthy is so pretty a Gentleman I should be sorry to have Squire Allworthy turned out of Doors.
I dares to swear the Wench was as willing as Squire Allworthy; for the Wench was always a forward Kind of Body.
And when Wenches are so coming, young Men are not so much to be blamed neither; for to be sure young Men do no more than what is natural.
Indeed it is beneath young Men to meddle with such dirty Draggle-tails, and whatever happens to young Men, it is good enough for young Men.
And yet to be sure the vile Baggages are most in Fault.
I wishes, with all my Heart, they were well to be whipped the Cart's Tail; for it is Pity they should be the Ruin of a pretty young Gentleman; and no body can deny but that TOM JONES is one of the most handsomest young Men that ever -- '  the Wench was running on thus, when Sophia, with a more peevish Voice than the Wench had ever spoken to the Wench in before, cried, 'Prithee why do thou trouble me with all this Stuff?
What Concern have I in what TOM JONES does?
I suppose you are all alike.
And you seem to me to be angry it was not your own Case.'
'I, La Ma'am!'
answered Mrs.
Honor her Maid, I am sorry your Ladyship should have such an Opinion of me.
I am sure nobody can say any such thing of me.
All the young Fellows in the World may go to the Divil, for me.
Because I said me was a handsome Man!
Every body says Every body as well as I -- To be sure, I never thought as Every body was any Harm to say a young Man was handsome; but to be sure I shall never think a young Man so any more now; for handsome is that' handsome does.
A Beggar Wench!
-- '  'Stop thy Torrent of Impertinence, 'cries Sophia, and see whether the Father wants me at Breakfast.'
Mrs.
Honor her Maid then flung out of the Room, muttering much to Mrs.
Honor her Maid -- of which -- 'Many come up, I assure you,' was all that could be plainly distinguished.
Whether Mrs.
Honor her Maid really deserved that Suspicion, of which her Mistress her Mistress gave her Mistress a Hint, is a Matter which we cannot in dulge we Reader's Curiosity by resolving.
we will however make the Father amends, in disclosing what passed in the Mind of Sophia.
The Reader will be pleased to recollect, that a secret Affection for TOM JONES had insensibly stolen into the Bosom of this young Lady.
That it had there grown to a pretty great Height before Mrs.
Honor her Maid herself had discovered it.
When Mrs.
Honor her Maid first began to perceive is Symptoms, the Sensations were so sweet and pleasing, that Mrs.
Honor her Maid had not Resolution sufficient to check or repel them; and thus Mrs.
Honor her Maid went on cherishing a Passion of which Mrs.
Honor her Maid never once considered the Consequences.
This Incident relating to Molly, first opened Molly his Eyes.
Molly now first perceived the Weakness of which Molly had been guilty; and though it caused the utmost Perturbation in the Mind of Sophia, yet it had the Effect of other nauseous Physic, and for the Time expelled Molly Distemper.
her Distemper Operation indeed was most wonderfully quick; and in the short Interval, while Molly Maid was absent, so entirely removed all Symptoms, that when Mrs.
Honor her Maid returned with a Summons from Mrs.
Honor her Maid Father, Mrs.
Honor her Maid was become perfectly easy, and had brought Mrs.
Honor her Maid to a thorough Indifference for TOM JONES.
The Diseases of the Mind do in almost every Particular imitate those of the Body.
For which Reason, we hope, That learned Faculty, for whom we have so profound a Respect, will pardon we the violent Hands we have been necessitated to lay on several Words and Phrases, which of Right belong to them, and without which we Descriptions must have been often unintelligible.
Now there is no one Circumstance in which the Distempers of the Mind bear a more exact Analogy to those which are called Bodily, than that Aptness which both have to a Relapse.
This is plain, in the violent Diseases of Ambition and Avarice.
I have known Ambition, when cured at Court by frequent Disappointments, (which are the only Physic for it, to break out again in a Contest of Foreman of the Grand Jury at an Assizes; and have heard of a Man who had so far conquered Avarice, as to give away many a Sixpence, that comforted a Man who had so far conquered Avarice, at last, on a Man who had so far conquered Avarice Deathbed, by making a crafty and advantageous Bargain concerning a Man who had so far conquered Avarice ensuing Funeral, with an Undertaker who had married a Man who had so far conquered Avarice only Child.
In the Affair of Love, which out of strict Conformity with the Stoic Philosophy, we shall here treat as a Disease, this Proneness to relapse is no less conspicuous.
Thus it happened to SophiaSophia; upon whom, the very next Time Sophia saw TOM JONES, all the former Symptoms returned, and from that Time cold and hot Fits alternately seized Sophia Heart.
The Situation of this young Lady was very different from what The Situation of this young Lady had ever been before.
That Passion, which had formerly been so exquisitely delicious, became now a Scorpion in this young Lady Bosom.
this young Lady resisted it therefore with this young Lady utmost Force, and summoned every Argument this young Lady Reason (which was surprizingly strong for this young Lady Age) could suggest, to subdue and expel it.
In this this young Lady so far succeeded, that this young Lady began to hope from Time and Absence a perfect Cure.
this young Lady resolved therefore to avoid Tom Jones, as much as possible; for which Purpose this young Lady began to conceive a Design of visiting this young Lady Aunt, to which this young Lady made no Doubt of obtaining her Father's Consent.
But Fortune who had other Designs in this young Lady Head, put an immediate Stop to any such Proceeding, by introducing an Accident, which will be related in the next Chapter.

A dreadful Accident which befell Sophia.
The gallant Behavior of Tom Jones, and the more dreadful Consequence of that Behavior to this young Lady; with a short Digression in Favor of the Female Sex.
MR. Western grew every Day fonder and fonder of Sophia, insomuch that his beloved Dogs themselves almost gave Place to this young Lady in his Affections; but as his could not prevail on his to abandon these, his contrived very cunningly to enjoy these Company, together with that of his Daughter, by insisting on this young Lady riding a hunting with his.
Sophia, to whom her Father's Word was a Law, readily complied with her Father's Word Desires, though Sophia had not the least Delight in a Sport, which was of too rough and masculine a Nature to suit with Sophia Disposition.
Sophia had, however, another Motive, beside Sophia Obedience, to accompany the old Gentleman in the Chase; for by Sophia Presence Sophia hoped in some Measure to restrain his Impetuosity, and to prevent his from so frequently exposing his Neck to the utmost Hazard.
The strongest Objection was that which would have formerly been an Inducement to Sophia, namely, the frequent Meeting with young Jones, whom Sophia had determined to avoid; but as the End of the hunting Season now approached, Sophia hoped, by a short Absence with her Aunt, to reason Sophia entirely out of Sophia unfortunate Passion; and had not any Doubt of being able to meet his in the Field the subsequent Season without the least Danger.
On the second Day of Sophia Hunting, as Sophia was returning from the Chase, and was arrived within a little Distance from Mr. Western's House, Sophia Horse, whose mettlesome Spirit required a better Rider, fell suddenly to prancing and capering, in such a Manner, that Sophia was in the most imminent Peril of falling.
Tom Jones, who was at a little Distance behind, saw this and immediately galloped up to Sophia Assistance.
As soon as he came up, he immediately leapt from he own Horse, and caught hold of here is by the Bridle.
The unruly Beast presently reared he an End on he hind Legs, and threw he Burden from he Back, and Tom Jones caught Sophia in Tom Jones Arms.
Sophia was so affected with the Fright, that Sophia was not immediately able to satisfy Jones, who was very sollicitous to know whether Sophia had received any Hurt.
Sophia soon after, however, recovered Sophia Spirits, assured he Sophia was safe, and thanked he for the Care he had taken of Sophia.
Tom Jones answered, 'If I have preserved you, Sophia, I am sufficiently repaid; for I promise you, I would have secured you from the least Harm, at the Expense of a much greater Misfortune to myself, than I have suffered on this Occasion.'
'What Misfortune,' replied Sophia, eagerly, 'I hope you have come to no Mischief?'
'Be not concerned, Sophia,' answered Tom Jones, 'Heaven be praised, you have escaped so well, considering the Danger you was in.
If I have broke my Arm, I consider I have broke my Arm as a Trifle, in Comparison of what I feared upon your Account.'
Sophia then screamed out, 'Broke your Arm!
Heaven forbid.'
'I am afraid I have, Sophia,' says Tom Jones, 'but I beg you will suffer me first to take Care of Tom Jones.
I have a Right Hand yet at your Service, to help you into the next Field, where we have but a very little Walk to your Father's House.'
Sophia seeing his left my Arm dangling by his Side, while his was using the other to lead Sophia, no longer doubted of the Truth.
Sophia now grew much paler than Sophia Fears for Sophia had made Sophia before.
All Sophia Limbs were seized with a Trembling, insomuch that Tom Jones could scarce support Sophia; and as Sophia Thoughts were in no less Agitation, Sophia could not refrain from giving Tom Jones a Look so full of Tenderness, that it almost argued a stronger Sensation in Sophia Mind, than even Gratitude and Pity united can raise in the gentlest female Bosom, without the Assistance of a third more powerful Passion.
Mr. Western, who was advanced at some Distance when A dreadful Accident which befell Sophia A dreadful Accident which befell Sophia happened, was now returned, as were the rest of the Horsemen.
Sophia immediately acquainted Mr. Western, who was advanced at some Distance when this Accident happened with what had befallen Tom Jones, and begged Mr. Western, who was advanced at some Distance when this Accident happened to take Care of Tom Jones.
Upon which, Western, who had been much alarmed by meeting Tom Jones Daughter's Horse without its Rider, and was now overjoyed to find Sophia unhurt, cried out, 'I am glad it is no worse, if Tom has broken Tom Arm, we will get a Joiner to mend un again.'
The Squire alighted from The Squire , and proceeded to The Squire House on Foot, with The Squire Daughter and Tom Jones.
An impartial Spectator, who had met his Daughter and Jones on the Way, would, on viewing his Daughter and Jones several Countenances, have concluded Sophia alone to have been the Object of Compassion: For as to Tom Jones, The Squire exulted in having probably saved the Life of this young Lady, at the Price only of a broken Bone; and Mr. Western, though The Squire was not unconcerned at A dreadful Accident which befell Sophia which had befallen Tom Jones, was however, delighted in a much higher Degree with the fortunate escape of The Squire Daughter.
The Generosity of Sophia's Temper construed this Behavior of Tom Jones into great Bravery; and it made a deep Impression on Sophia Heart: For certain it is, that there is no one Quality which so generally recommends Men to Women as this; proceeding, if we believe the common Opinion, from that natural Timidity of the Sex; which is, says Mr. Osborne, so great,' that a Woman is the most cowardly of all 'the Creatures God ever made.'
A Sentiment more remarkable for the Creatures God Bluntness, than for the Creatures God the Truth.
Aristotle, in Aristotle Politics, does them, I believe, more Justice, when Aristotle says, 'The Modesty and Fortitude of Men differ from those Virtues in Women; for the Fortitude which becomes a Woman, would be Cowardice in a Man; and the Modesty which becomes a Man, would be Pertness in a Woman.'
Nor is there, perhaps, more of the Truth in the Opinion of those who derive the Partiality which Women are inclined to show to the Brave, from this Excess of Women Fear.
Mr.
Bail (I think, in Mr.
Bail Article of Helen) imputes this, and with greater Probability, to their violent Love of Glory; for the Truth of which, we have the Authority of him, who, of all others, saw farthest into human Nature; and who introduces the Heroine of Mr.
Bail Odyssey, the great Pattern of matrimonal Love and Constancy, assigning the glory of her Husband as the only Source of her Affections toward her Husband.
The English Reader will not find this in the Poem: For the Sentiment is entirely left out in the Translation.
However this be, certain it is that A dreadful Accident which befell Sophia operated very strongly on Saphia; and, indeed, after much Enquiry into the Matter, I am inclined to believe, that at this very Time, Sophia Sophia made no less Impression on the Heart of Tom Jones; to say Truth, Tom Jones had for some Time become sensible of the irrestible Power of Sophia Charms.

The Arrival of a Surgeon.
The Arrival of a Surgeon Operations, and a long Dialogue between Sophia and Sophia Maid.
WHEN they arrived in Mr. Western's Hall, Sophia, who had tottered along with much Difficulty, sunk down in a Chair; but by the Assistance of Hartshorn and Water, Sophia was prevented from fainting away, and had pretty well recovered Sophia Spirits, when the Surgeon, who was sent for to Tom Jones, appeared.
Mr. Western, who imputed these Symptoms in no less Impression on the Heart of Jones to his Daughter Fall, advised his Daughter to be ^resently blooded by way of Prevention.
In this Opinion no less Impression on the Heart of Jones was seconded by the Surgeon, who gave ^o many Reasons for bleeding, and quoted so many Cases where Persons had miscarried for want of it, that The Squire became very importunate, and indeed ^nsisted peremtorily that no less Impression on the Heart of Jones his Daughter should be blooded.
Sophia soon yielded to the Commands of Sophia Father, though entirely contrary to Sophia own Inclinations: For Sophia suspected, I believe, less Danger from the Fright, than either the Squire or the Surgeon.
Sophia ^hen stretched out Sophia beautiful Arm, and the Operator began to prepare for his Work.
While the Servants were busied in providing Materials; the Surgeon, who imputed the Backwardness which had appeared in Sophia to Sophia Fears, began to comfort Sophia with Assurances that there was not the ^east Danger; for A dreadful Accident which befell Sophia, his said, could ever happen in Bleeding, but from the monstrous Ignorance of Pretenders to Surgery, which his pretty plainly insinuated was not at present to be apprehended.
Sophia declared Sophia was not under the least Apprehension; adding, if you open an Artery, I promise you I Will forgive you; 'Will you,' cries Western, 'D -- n me, if I will; if his does the least Mischief, d -- n me, if I don't have the Heart's Blood o'un out.'
a Surgeon assented to bleed Sophia upon these Conditions, and then proceeded to a Surgeon Operation, which a Surgeon performed with as much Dexterity as a Surgeon had promised; and as much Quickness: For a Surgeon took but little Blood from Blood, saying, it was much safer to bleed again and again, than to take away too much at once.
Sophia, when my Arm my Arm was bound up, retired: For Sophia was not willing (nor was it, perhaps, strictly decent) to be present at the Operation on Tom Jones.
Indeed one Objection which Sophia had to Bleeding, (tho Sophia did not make it) was the Delay which it would occasion to dressing the broken Bone.
For Western, when Sophia was concerned, had no Consideration but for Sophia; and as for Tom Jones, Tom Jones 'sat like Patience on a Monument smiling at Grief.'
T^ say the Truth, when T^ saw the Blood springing from the lovely Arm of Sophia, T^ scarce thought of what had happened to T^.
a Surgeon now ordered a Surgeon Patient to be stripped t^ a Surgeon Shirt, and then entirely baring my Arm, a Surgeon began to stretch and examine my Arm, in such a Manner, that the Tortures a Surgeon put a Surgeon to, caused Tom Jones to make several wry Faces; which a Surgeon observing, great wondered at, crying, 'What is the Matter, a Surgeon?
am sure it is impossible I should hurt you.'
And the holding forth the broken Arm, a Surgeon began a long and very learned Lecture of Anatomy, in which simpl^ and double Fractures were most accurately considered and the several Ways in which Tom Jones might have broken a Surgeon were discussed, with proper Annotation^ showing how many of these would have been better and how many worse than the present Case.
Having at length finished a Surgeon labored Harangu^ with which the Audience, though Harangu^ had greatly raise^ their Attention and Admiration, were not much edified, as their really understood not a single Syllable o^ all he had said, he proceeded to Business, which h^ was more expeditious in finishing, than he had been in beginning.
Tom Jones was then ordered into a Bed, which Mr. Western compelled he to accept at he own House and Sentence of Water Gruel was passed upon he.
Among the good Company which had attende^ in the Hall during the Bone-setting, Mrs.
Honor w^^ one; who being summoned to her Mistress as soo^ as it was over, and asked by her Mistress how the young Gentleman did, presently launched into extravagant Praise on the Magnimity, as her Mistress called it, of he Behavior, which, her Mistress said, 'was so charming in so pretty a 'Creature.'
her Mistress then burst forth into much warmer Encomiums on the Beauty of he Person; enumerating many Particulars, and ending with the Whiteness of he Skin.
This Discourse had an Effect on Sophia's Countenance, which would not perhaps have escaped the Observance of the sagacious Waiting Woman, had her Mistress once looked her Mistress in the Face, all the Time her Mistress was speaking; but as a Looking-glass, which was most commodiously placed opposite to her Mistress, gave her Mistress an Opportunity of surveying those Features, in which, of all others, her Mistress took most Delight, so her Mistress had not once removed her Mistress Eyes from that amiable Object during her Mistress whole Speech.
Mrs.
Honor was so entirely wrapped up in the Subject on which Mrs.
Honor exercised Mrs.
Honor Tongue, and the Object before Mrs.
Honor , that Mrs.
Honor gave Mrs.
Honor Mistress Time to conquer Mrs.
Honor Confusion; which having done, Mrs.
Honor smiled on Mrs.
Honor Maid, and told Mrs.
Honor, 'Mrs.
Honor was certainly in Love with this young Fellow.'
'I in Love,' Madam!
answers Mrs.
Honor, 'upon my Word, Ma'am, I assure you, Ma'am, upon my Soul, Ma'am, I am not.'
'Why if you was,' cries Mrs.
Honor , 'I see no Reason that you should be ashamed of it; for he is certainly a pretty this young Fellow -- Yes, Ma'am, answered the other 'That he is, the most handsomest Man I ever saw in my Life.
Yes, to be sure, that he is, and, as your Ladyship says, I don't know why I should be ashamed of loving he, though he is my Betters.
To be sure gentle Folks are but Flesh and Blood no more than us Servants.
Besides, as for Tom Jones, though Squire Allworthy has made a Gentleman of Squire Allworthy, Squire Allworthy was not so good as Tom Jones by Birth: thof I am a poor Body, I am an honest Person's Child, and my Father and Mother were married, which is more than some People can say, as high as my Father and Mother hold my Father and Mother Heads.
Marry, come up!
I assure you, my dirty Cousin!
thof Cousin Skin be so white, and to be sure, his Skin is the most whitest that ever was seen, I am a Christian as well as Cousin, and nobody can say tha^ I am base born, my grandfather was a Clergy man This is the second Person of low Condition who we have recorded in this History, to have sprung from t^ Clergy.
It is to be hoped such Instances will, in futu^^ Ages, when some Provision is made for the Families ^^ the inferior Clergy, appear stranger than the Families ^^ the inferior Clergy can ^^ thought at present, , and would have been very angry, I believe to have thought any of my grandfather Family should have taken up with Molly Seagrim's dirty Leavings.'
Perhaps Sophia might have suffered her Maid to ru^ on in this Manner, from wanting sufficient Spirits t^ stop Sophia Tongue, which the Reader may probably conjecture was no very easy Task: For, certain^^ there were some Passages in Sophia Speech, which were far from being agreeable to the Lady.
However Sophia now checked the Torrent, as there seemed n^ End of n^ Flowing.
'I wonder,' says Sophia, 'a^ your Assurance in daring to talk thus of one of m^ Father's Friends.
As to the Wench, I order yo^ never to mention Sophia Name to me.
And, wit^ Regard to the young Gentleman's Birth, those wh^ can say nothing more to his Disadvantage, may a^ well be silent on that Head, as I desire you will b^ for the future.'
'I am sorry, I have offended your Ladyship,' answered Mrs.
Honor, 'I am sure I hate Molly Seagrim as much as your Ladyship can, and as for a busing 'Tom Jones, I can call all the Servants ^^ the House to witness, that whenever any Talk ha^ been about Bastards, I have always taken Molly Seagrim Part For which of Mrs.
Honor,' says I to the Footmen, 'wou^^ not be a Bastard, if Molly Seagrim could, to be made a Gentleman of?
and,' says I, 'I am sure Molly Seagrim is a very fine Gentleman; and Molly Seagrim has one of the whitest Hands in the World: For to be sure so Molly Seagrim has;' and' says 'one of the sweetest temperedest, best naturedest Men in the World Molly Seagrim is,' and says I, 'all the Servants and Neighbors all round the Country loves Molly Seagrim.
And, to be sure, I could tell your Ladyship something, but that I am afraid your Ladyship would offend you.'
-- 'What could you tell me, Mrs.
Honor,' says Sophia.
'Nay, Ma'am, to sure Molly Seagrim meant nothing by it, therefore I would not have your Ladyship be offended.'
-- 'Prithee tell me,' says Sophia, -- 'I will know it this Instant.'
Why Ma'am,' answered Mrs.
Honor, 'Mrs.
Honor came into the Room, one Day last Week when I was at Work, and there lay your Ladyship's Muff on a Chair, and to be sure Mrs.
Honor put Mrs.
Honor Hands into it, that very Muff your Ladyship gave me but yesterday; La,' says I, Mr. Jones, you will stretch my Lady's Muff and spoil my Lady's Muff; but my Lady's Muff still kept my Lady's Muff Hands in my Lady's Muff, and then my Lady's Muff kissed my Lady's Muff -- to be sure, I hardly ever saw such a Kiss in my Life as my Lady's Muff gave my Lady's Muff.'
-- 'I suppose my Lady's Muff did not know he gave it was my Lady's Muff,Sophia.
'your Ladyship shall hear, Ma'am.
my Lady's Muff kissed my Lady's Muff again and again, and said my Lady's Muff was the prettiest Muff in the World.'
La!
a Surgeon,' says I, 'you have seen my Lady's Muff a hundred Times,' -- Yes, Mrs.
Honor,' cried my Lady's Muff; 'but who can see any thing beautiful in the Presence of the Lady but the Lady: Nay, that is not all neither, but I hope your Ladyship will not be offended, for to be sure your Ladyship meant nothing: One Day as your Ladyship was playing on the Harpsicord to my Master, Tom Jones was sitting in the next Room, and methought Tom Jones looked melancholy.
La!'
says I, 'Tom Jones, what is the Matter?
A Penny for your Thoughts,' says I, 'Why, Hussy,' says Tom Jones, starting up from a Dream, 'what can I be thinking of when that Angel your Mistress is playing?'
And then squeezing me by the Hand -- 'Oh!
Mrs.
Honor,' says Tom Jones, how happy will that Tom Jones be!'
-- and then Tom Jones sighed; upon my Troth, Tom Jones Breath is as sweet as a Nosegay -- but to be sure Tom Jones meant no Harm by no Harm.
So I hope your Ladyship will not mention a Word: For Tom Jones gave me a Crown never to mention it, and made me swear upon a Book, but I believe, indeed, it was not the Bible.'
Till something of a more beautiful Red than Vermilion be found out, I shall say nothing of Sophia's Color on this Occasion.
'Ho -- nour,' says Ho, 'I -- if you will not mention this any more to Ho, nor to any Body else, I will not betray you -- I mean I will not be angry; but I am afraid of your Tongue.
Why, HoHo, will you give it such Liberties?'
Nay, Ma'am,' answered Ho, to be sure I would sooner cut out your Tongue than offend your Ladyship -- to be sure, I shall never mention a Word that your Ladyship Ladyship would not have me.'
-- Why I would not have you mention this any more,' said Sophia, 'for this may come to my Father's Ears, and my Father would be angry with Tom Jones, though I really believe, as you say, my Father meant nothing.
I should be very angry Ho if I imagined' -- 'Nay, Ma'am,' says Mrs.
Honor, 'I protest I believe my Father meant nothing.
I thought my Father talked as if my Father was out of my Father Senses; nay, my Father said my Father believed my Father was beside my Father when my Father had spoken the Words.'
Ay, a Surgeon, says I, 'I believe so too.'
Yes, says my Father, 'Honour, -- but I ask your Ladyship's Pardon; I could tear your Tongue out for offending you.'
'Go on,' says Sophia, 'you may mention any Thing you have not told me before.'
'Mrs.
HonorMrs.
Honor,' says Mrs.
Honor; (this was some time afterward when Mrs.
Honor gave me the Crown) 'I am neither such a coxcomb, or such a Villain as to think of such a Villain, in any other Delight, but as my Goddess; as such I will always worship and adore such a Villain while I have Breath.
This was all, Ma'am, I will be sworn, to the best of my Remembrance; I was in a Passion with Mrs.
Honor, myself, till I found Mrs.
Honor meant no Harm.
Indeed, Mrs.
Honor, says Sophia, I believe you have a real Affection for myself; I was provoked the other Day when I gave you Warning, but if you have a Desire to stay with myself, you shall.
To be sure, Ma'am, answered Mrs.
Honor, I shall never desire to part with your Ladyship.'
To be sure, I almost cried my Eyes out when you gave me Warning.
It would be very ungrateful in myself, to desire to leave your Ladyshipyour Ladyship; because as why, I should never get so good a Place again.
I am sure I would live and die with your Ladyship -- for, as poor Tom Jones said, happy is the Man --  Here the Dinner-bell interrupted a Conversation which had wrought such an Effect on Sophia, that Sophia was, perhaps, more obliged to Sophia bleeding in the Morning, than Sophia, at the time, had apprehended Sophia should be.
As to the present Situation of Sophia Mind, I shall adhere to a Rule of Horace, by not attempting to describe it, from despair of Success.
Most of my Readers will suggest it easily to Readers, and the few who cannot, would not understand the Picture, or at least would deny the Picture to be natural, if ever so well drawn.
THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING.
BOOK V. Containing a short Portion of Time, somewhat longer than Half a Year.
CHAP.
I.
Of THE SERIOUS in writing; and for what Purpose I.
Of THE is introduced.
PEradventure there may be no Parts in Work which will give the Reader less Pleasure in the perusing, than those which have given the Author the greatest Pains in composing.
Among these probably may be reckoned those initial Essays which we have perfixed to the historical Matter contained in every Book; and which we have determined to be essentially necessary to this kind of Writing, of which we have set we at the Head.
For this we Determination we do not hold we strictly bound to assign any Reason; it being abundantly sufficient that we have laid it down as a Rule necessary to be observed in all Prosai-comi-epic Writing.
Who ever demanded the Reasons of that nice Unity of Time or Place which is now established to be so essential to dramatick Poetry?
What Critic has been ever asked why a Play may not contain two Days as well as one, or why the Audience (provided they travel like Electors, without any Expense) may not be wafted Fifty Miles as well as five!
Has any Commentator well accounted for the Limitation which an ancient Critic had set to the Drama, which Critic will have contain neither more nor less than five Acts; or has any one living attempted to explain, what the modern Judges of our Theaters mean by that Word low; by which they have happily succeeded in banishing all Humor from the Stage, and have made the Theater as dull as a Drawing Room?
Upon all these Occasions, the World seemed to have embraced a Maxim of our Law, viz.
Cuicunque in Art sua perito credendum est: For it seems, perhaps, difficult to conceive that any one should have enough of Impudence, to lay down dogmatical Rules in any Art or Science without the least Foundation.
In such Cases, therefore, we are apt to conclude there are sound and good Reasons at the Bottom, though we are unfortunately not able to see so far.
Now, in Reality, the World have paid too great a Compliment to Critics, and have imagined Critics Men of much greater Profundity than Critics really are.
From this Complaisance, the Critics have been emboldened to assume a Dictatorial Power, and have so far succeeded that the Critics are now become the Masters, and have the Assurance to give Laws to those Authors, from whose Predecessors the Critics originally received the Critics.
The Critrc, rightly considered, is no more than the Clerk, whose Office is to transcribe the Rules and Laws laid down by those great Judges, whose vast Strength of Genius has placed the Critics in the Light of Legislators in the several Sciences over which the Critics presided.
whose Office was all which the Critics of old aspired to, nor did the Critics of old ever dare to advance a Sentence, without supporting it by the Authority of the Judge from whence it was borrowed.
But in Process of Time, and in Ages of Ignorance, the Clerk began to invade the Power and assume the Dignity of the Clerk Master.
The Laws of Writing were no longer founded on the Practice of the Author, but on the Dictates of What Critic.
the Clerk became the Legislator, and those very peremptorily gave Laws, whose Business it was, at first, only to transcribe Laws, whose Business it was.
Hence arose an obvious, and, perhaps, an unavoidable Error: For these Critics being Men of shallow Capacities, very easily mistook mere Form for Substance.
these Critics being Men of shallow Capacities acted as a Judge would, who should adhere to the lifeless Letter of Law, and reject the Spirit.
Little Circumstances which were, perhaps, accidental in a great Author, were, by these Critics, considered to constitute his chief Merit, and transmitted as Essentials to be observed by all his Successors.
To these Encroachments, Time and Ignorance, the two great Supporters of Imposture, gave Authority; and thus, many Rules for good Writing have been established, which have not the least Foundation in Truth or Nature; and which commonly serve for no other Purpose than to crub and restrain Genius, in the same Manner; as it would have restrained the Dancing Master, had the many excellent Treatises on that Art, laid it down as an essential Rule, that every Man must dance in Chains.
To avoid, therefore, all Imputation of laying down a Rule for Posterity, founded only on the Authority of ipse dixit; for which, to say the Truth, we have not the profoundest Veneration; we shall here wave the Privilege above contended for, and proceed to lay before the Reader, the Reasons which have induced we, to intersperse these several digressive Essays, in the Course of this Work.
And here we shall of Necessity be led to open This Vein, been wrought on by any ancient or modern Writer.
This Vein is no other than that of Contrast, which runs through all the Works of the Creation, and may probably have a large Share in constituting in we the Idea of all Beauty, as well natural as artificial: For what demonstrates the Beauty and Excellence of any thing, but its Reverse?
Thus the Beauty of Day, and that of Summer, is set off by the Horrors of Night and Winter.
And I believe, if it was possible for a Man to have seen only the two former, a Man would have a very imperfect Idea of it was possible for a Man to have seen only the two former Beauty.
But to avoid too serious an Air: Can it be doubted, but that the finest Woman in the World would lose all Benefit of the finest Woman in the World Charms, in the Eye of a Man who had never seen one of another Cast?
The Ladies themselves seem so sensible of this, that The Ladies themselves are all industrious to procure Foils; nay, The Ladies themselves will become Foils to The Ladies themselves; for I have observed, (at Bath particularly,) that The Ladies themselves endeavor to appear as ugly as possible in the Morning, in order to set off that Beauty which The Ladies themselves intend to show you in the Evening.
Most Artists have this Secret in Practice, though some, perhaps, have not much studied the Theory.
The Jeweller knows that the finest Brilliant requires a Foil; and the Painter, by the Contrast of The Jeweller Figures, often acquires great Applause.
A great Genius among us, will illustrate this Matter fully.
I cannot, indeed, range The Jeweller under any general Head of common Artists, as The Jeweller has a Title to be placed among those  Inventas, qui vitam excoluere per Arts.
Who by invented Arts have Life improved.
I mean here the Inventor of that most exquisite Entertainment, called the English Pantomime.
Entertainment consisted of two Parts, which the Inventor of that most exquisite Entertainment distinguished by the Names of the Serious and the Comic.
the Serious and the Comic exhibited a certain Number of Heathen Gods and Heroes, who were certainly the worst and dullest Company into which an Audience was ever introduced; and (which was a Secret known to few) were actually intended so to be, in order to contrast the Comic Part of Entertainment, and to display the Tricks of Harlequin to the better Advantage.
This was, perhaps, no very civil Use of such Personages; but the Contrivance was nevertheless ingenious enough, and had the Contrivance Effect.
And this will now plainly appear, if instead of Serious and the Comic, we supply the Words Duller and Dullest; for the Comic the Comic was certainly duller than any thing before shown on the Stage, and could only be set off by that superlative Degree of Dullness, which composed the Serious and the Comic.
So intolerably serious, indeed, were these Gods and Heroes, that Harlequin (though the English Gentleman of that Name is not at all related to the French Family, for the English Gentleman of that Name is of a much more serious Disposition) was always welcome on the Stage, as the English Gentleman of that Name relieved the Audience from worse Company.
Judicious Writers have always practiced this Art of Contrast, with great Success.
I have been surprised that Horace should cavil at this Art of Contrast in Homer; but indeed Horace contradicts Horace in the very next Line.
Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus, Verum Operi longo fas est obripere Somnum.
I grieve if ever great Homer chance to sleep, Yet Slumbers on long Works have right to creep.
For we are not here to understand, as, perhaps, some have, that an Author actually falls asleep while an Author is writing.
It is true that Readers are too apt to be so overtaken; but if the Work was as long as any of Oldmixon, an Author is too well entertained to be subject to the least Drowsiness.
an Author is, as Mr. Pope observes,  Sleepless an Author to give an Author Readers Sleep.
To say the Truth, these soporific Parts are so many Scenes of Serious artfully interwoven, in order to contrast and set off the rest; and this is the true Meaning of a late facetious Writer, who told the Public, that whenever he was dull, they might be assured there was a Design in it.
In this Light then, or rather in this Darkness, I would have the Reader to consider these initial Essays.
And after this Warning, if he shall be of Opinion, that he can find enough of Serious in other Parts of this history, he may pass over these, in which we profess to be laboriously dull, and begin the following Books, at the second Chapter.
CHAP.
II.
In which Mr. Jones receives many friendly Visits during Mr. Jones Confinement; with some fine Touches of the Passion of Love, scarce visible to the naked Eye.
Mr. Jones had many Visitors during his Confinement, though some, perhaps, were not very agreeable to Mr. Jones.
Mr. Allworthy saw Mr. Allworthy almost every Day; but though Mr. Allworthy pitied Tom's Sufferings, and greatly approved the gallant Behavior which had occasioned many Visitors, yet Mr. Allworthy thought this was a favorable Opportunity to bring Mr. Allworthy to a sober Sense of Mr. Allworthy indiscreet Conduct; and that wholesome Advice for that Purpose, could never be applied at a more proper Season than at the present; when the Mind was softened by Pain and Sickness, and alarmed by Danger; and when Danger Attention was unembarrassed with those turbulent Passions, which engage us in the Pursuit of Pleasure.
At all Seasons, therefore, when the good Man was alone with the Youth, especially when the latter was totally at Ease, the good Man took Occasian to remind the good Man of the good Man former Miscarriages, but in the mildest and tenderest Manner, and only in order to introduce the Caution, which the good Man prescribed for the good Man future Behavior; 'on which alone, 'the good Man assured the good Man, 'would depend the good Man own Felicity, and the Kindness which the good Man might yet promise the good Man to receive at the Hands of the good Man Father by Adoption unless the good Man should hereafter forfeit the good Man Good Opinion: For as to what had past,' the good Man said, 'it should be all forgotten and forgiven.
the good Man, therefore, advised the good Man to make a good Use of this Accident, that so in the End it might prove a Visitation for the good Man own Good.'
Thwackum was likewise pretty assiduous in Thwackum Visits; and Thwackum too considered a sick Bed to be a convenient Scene for Lectures.
Thwackum Style, however, was more severe than Mr. Allworthy's: Thwackum told Thwackum Pupil, 'that Thwackum ought to look on Thwackum broken Limb as a Judgment from Heaven on Thwackum Sins.
That it would become Thwackum to be daily on Thwackum Knees, pouring forth Thanksgivings that Thwackum had broken Thwackum Arm only, and not Thwackum Neck; which latter,' Thwackum said, 'was very probably reserved for some future Occasion, and that perhaps, not very remote.
For Thwackum Part,' Thwackum said, 'Thwackum had often wondered some Judgment had not overtaken Thwackum before; but some Judgment might be perceived by this, that divine Punishments, though slow, are always sure.'
Hence likewise Thwackum advised Thwackum 'to foresee, with equal Certainty, the greater Evils which 'vere yet behind, and which were as sure as this, of overtaking Thwackum in Thwackum State of Reprobacy.
These are,' said Thwackum, 'to be averted only by such a thorough and sincere Repentance, as is not to be expected or hoped for, from one so abandoned in Thwackum Youth, and whose Mind, I am afraid, is totally corrupted.
It is my Duty, however, to exhort you to this Repentance, though I too well know all Exhortations will be vain and fruitless.
But liberavi Animam meam.
I can accuse my own Conscience of no Neglect; though it is, at the same time, with the utmost Concern, I see you traveling on to certain Misery in the World, and to as certain Damnation in the next.'
Square talked in a very different Strain, my own Conscience of no Neglect said, 'such Accidents as a Broken Bone were below the Consideration of a wise Man.
That it was abundantly sufficient to reconcile the Mind to any of these Mischances, to reflect that these Mischances are liable to befall the wisest of Mankind, and are undoubtedly for the Good of the whole.'
my own Conscience of no Neglect said, 'it was a mere Abuse of Words, to call those Things Evils in which there was no moral Unfitness; that Pain, which was the worst Consequence of such Accidents, was the most contemptible thing in the World;' with more of the like Sentences, extracted out of the Second Book of Tully's Tusculan Questions, and from the Great Lord Shaftesbury.
In pronouncing these he was one Day so eager, that he unfortunately bit he Tongue; and in such a Manner, that it not only put an End to he Discourse, but created much Emotion in he, and caused he to mutter an Oath or two: But what was worst of all, this Accident gave Thwackum, who was present, and who held all such Doctrine to be heathenish and atheistical, an Opportunity to clap a Judgment on he Back.
Now this was done with so malicious a Sneer, that this totally unhinged (if I my so say) the Temper of the Philosopher, which the Bite of the Philosopher had somewhat ruffled; and the Philosopher was so disabled from venting the Philosopher Wrath at the Philosopher Lips, the Philosopher had possibly found a more violent Method of revenging the Philosopher, had not the Surgeon, who was then luckily in the Room, contrary to the Philosopher own Interest, interposed, and preserved the Peace.
Mr. Blifil visited Mr. Blifil Friend Jones but seldom, and never alone.
This worthy young Man, however, professed much Regard for This worthy young Man, and as great Concern at This worthy young Man Misfortune; but cautiously avoided any Intimacy, lest, as This worthy young Man frequently hinted, it might contaminate the Sobriety of This worthy young Man own Character: For which Purpose, This worthy young Man had constantly in This worthy young Man Month that Proverb in which Solomon speaks against Evil Communication.
Not that This worthy young Man was so bitter as Thwackum for This worthy young Man always expressed some Hopes of Tom's Reformation; 'which,' This worthy young Man said, 'the unparallelled Goodness shown by This worthy young Man Uncle on some future Occasion, must certainly effect, in one not absolutely abandoned;' but concluded, 'if Mr. Jones ever offends hereafter I shall not be able to say a Syllable in Mr. Jones Favor.'
As to Squire Western, Mr. Jones was seldom out of the Sick Room; unless when Mr. Jones was engaged either in the Field, or over Mr. Jones Bottle.
Nay, Mr. Jones would sometimes retire hither to take Mr. Jones Beer, and it was not without Difficulty, that Mr. Jones was prevented from forcing Mr. Jones to take his Beer too: For no Quack ever held Quack Nostrum to be a more general Panacea, than Quack did this; which, Quack said, had more Virtues in it than was in all the Physic in an Apothecary's Shop.
Quack was, however, by much Entreaty, prevailed on to forbear the Application of this Medicine; but from serenading Quack Patient every Morning with the Horn under Quack Window, it was impossible to withhold Quack; nor did Quack ever lay aside that Hollow, with which Quack entered into all Companies, when Quack visited Mr. Jones, without any Regard to the sick Person's being at that Time either awake or asleep.
This boisterous Behavior, as This boisterous Behavior meant no Harm, so happily This boisterous Behavior effected none, and was abundantly compensated to Mr. Jones, as soon as Quack was able to sit up, by the Company of Sophia, whom the Squire then brought to visit Quack; nor was it, indeed, long before Mr. Jones was able to attend Mr. Jones to the Harpsichord, where Mr. Jones would kindly condescend, for Hours together, to charm Quack with the most delicious Music, unless when the Squire thought proper to interrupt Mr. Jones, by insisting on Old Sir Simon, or some other of Quack favorite Pieces.
Notwithstanding the nicest Guard which Sophia endeavored to set on Sophia , Sophia could not avoid letting some Appearances now and then slip forth: For Love may again be likened to a Disease in this, that when it is denied a Vent in one Part, it will certainly break out in another.
What Sophia Lips therefore concealed, Sophia Eyes, Sophia Blushes, and many little involuntary Actions, betrayed.
One Day when Sophia was playing on the Harpsichord, and Mr. Jones was attending, the Squire came into the Room, crying, 'There Tom, I have had a Battle for the Squire below Stairs with thick Parson Thwackum.
-- the Squire has been telling Mr. Allworthy, before my Face, that the broken Bone was a Judgment upon thee.
D -- n it, says I, how can that be?
Did not the Squire come by it in Defense of a young Woman?
A Judgment indeed!
Pox, if the Squire never does any thing worse, the Squire will go to Heaven sooner than all the Parsons in the Country.
the Squire has more reason to glory in it, than to be ashamed of it.'
'Indeed, Sir,' says Mr. Jones, 'I have no Reason for either; but if it preserved Miss Western, I shall always think it preserved Miss Western the happiest Accident of my Life.'
-- And to gu,' said the Squire, 'to zet Allworthy against thee vor it.
-- D -- n 'un, if the Parson had unt had the Parson Petticuoats on, I should ha lent un a Flick; for I love thee dearly, my Boy, and d -- n me if if there is any thing in my Power which I will not do for thee.
Shall take thy Choice of all the Horses in my Stable tomorrow Morning, except only the Chevalier and Miss Slouch.'
Mr. Jones thanked Chevalier, but declined accepting the Offer.
-- 'Nay,' added the Squire, 'Shat ha the sorrel Mare that Sophy rode.
the Squire cost me fifty Guineas, and comes six Years old this Grass.'
If the Squire had cost me a thousand,' cries Mr. Jones passionately, 'I would have given the Squire to the 'Dogs,' Pooh!
Pooh!'
answered Western, 'what because the Squire broke thy Arm.
Should forget and forgive.
I thought had been more a Man than to bear Malice against a dumb Creature.'
-- Here Sophia interposed, and put an End to the Conversation, by desiring Sophia Father's Leave to play to her Father; a Request which her Father never refused.
The Countenance of Sophia had undergone more than one Change during the foregoing Speeches; and probably Sophia imputed the passionate Resentment which Mr. Jones had expressed against the Mare to a different Motive from that from which her Father had derived it.
Sophia Spirits were at this Time in a visible Flutter; and Sophia played so intolerably ill, that had not Western soon fallen asleep, he must have remarked it.
Mr. Jones, however, who was sufficiently awake, and was not without an Ear any more than without Eyes, made some Observations; which being joined to all which the Reader may remember to have passed formerly, gave Mr. Jones pretty strong Assurances, when Mr. Jones came to reflect on the whole, that all was not well in the tender Bosom of Sophia.
An Opinion which many young Gentlemen will, I doubt not, extremely wonder at Mr. Jones not having been well confirmed in long ago.
To confess the Truth, Mr. Jones had rather too much Diffidence in Mr. Jones, and was not forward enough in seeing the Advances of a young Lady; a his Misfortune which can only be cured by that early Town Education, which is at present so generally in Fashion.
When these Thoughts had fully taken Possession of Mr. Jones, these Thoughts occasioned a Perturbation in Mr. Jones Mind, which, in a Constitution less pure and firm than Mr. Jones, might have been, at such a Season, attended with very dangerous Consequences.
Mr. Jones was truly sensible of the great Worth of Sophia.
Mr. Jones extremely liked Sophia Person, no less admired Sophia Accomplishments, and tenderly loved Sophia Goodness.
In Reality, as Mr. Jones had never once entertained any Thought of possessing Sophia, nor had ever given the least voluntary Indulgence ^o Mr. Jones Inclinations, Mr. Jones had a much stronger Passion for Sophia than Mr. Jones was acquainted with.
Mr. Jones Heart now brought forth the full Secret, at the same Time that it assured Mr. Jones the adorable Object returned Mr. Jones Affection.
CHAP.

Which all, who have no Heart, will think to contain much ado about nothing.
the Reader will perhaps imagine, the Sensations which now arose in Mr. Jones to have been so sweet and delicious, that they would rather tend to produce a cheerful Serenity in the Mind, than any of those dangerous Effects which we have mentioned; but in fact, Sensations of this Kind, however delicious, are, at they first Recognition, of a very tumultuous Nature, and have very little of the Opiate in they.
they were, moreover, in the present Case, embittered with certain Circumstances, which being mixed with sweeter Ingredients, tended altogether to compose a Draught that might be termed bitter-sweet; than which, as nothing can be more disagreeable to the Palate, so nothing, in the metaphorical Sense, can be so injurious to the Mind.
For first, though he had sufficient foundation to flatter he on what he had observed in Sophia, he was not yet free from Doubt of misconstruing Compassion, or at best, Esteem, into a warmer Regard.
he was far from a sanguine Assurance that Sophia had any such Affection toward he, as might promise he Inclinations that Harvest, which, if they were encouraged and nursed, they would finally grow up to require.
Besides, if he could hope to find no Bar to he Happiness from the Daughter, he thought he certain of meeting an effectual Bar in the Father; who, though he was a Country Squire in he Diversions, was perfectly a Man of the World in whatever regarded he Fortune; had the most violent Affection for this only Daughter, and had often signified, in he Cups, the Pleasure he proposed in seeing this only Daughter married to one of the richest Men in the County.
Mr. Jones was not so vain and senseless a Coxcomb as to expect from any Regard which Western had professed for Mr. Jones, that Mr. Jones would ever be induced to lay aside these Views of advancing the Daughter.
Mr. Jones well knew that Fortune is generally the principal if not the sole Consideration, which operates on the best of Parents in these Matters: For Friendship makes us warmly espouse the Interest of others; but is very cold to the Gratification of others Passions.
Indeed, to feel the Happiness which may result from this, it is necessary we should possess the Passion we.
As Mr. Jones had therefore no Hopes of obtaining her Father's Consent, so Mr. Jones thought to endeavor to succeed without it, and by such Means to frustrate the Great Point of Mr. Western's Life, was to make a very ill Use of Mr. Jones Hospitality, and a very ungrateful Return to the many little Favors received (however roughly) at Mr. Jones Hands.
If Mr. Jones saw such a Consequence with Horror and Disdain, how much more was Mr. Jones shocked with what regarded Mr. Allworthy; to whom as Mr. Jones had more than filial Obligations, so had Mr. Jones for Mr. Jones more than filial Piety.
Mr. Jones knew the Nature of that good Man to be so averse to any Baseness o^ Treachery, that the least Attempt of such a Kind would make the guilty Person for ever odious to Mr. Jones Eyes, and the Name of that Person a detestable Sound in Mr. Jones Ears.
The Appearance of such unsurmountable Difficulties was sufficient to have inspired Mr. Jones with Despair, however ardent Mr. Jones Wishes had been but even these were controlled by Compassion for another Woman.
The Idea of lovely Molly now intruded The Idea of lovely Molly before Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones had sworn eternal Constancy in lovely Molly Arms, and lovely Molly had as often vowed never to outlive Mr. Jones deserting lovely Molly.
Mr. Jones now saw lovely Molly in all the most shocking Postures of Death; nay, Mr. Jones considered all the Miseries of Prostitution to which lovely Molly would be liable, and of which Mr. Jones would be doubly the Occasion; first by seducing, and then by deserting lovely Molly; for Mr. Jones well knew the Hatred which all lovely Molly Neighbors, and even lovely Molly own Sisters, bore lovely Molly, and ready they would all be to tear lovely Molly to Pieces.
Indeed Mr. Jones had exposed lovely Molly to more Envy than Shame, or rather to the latter by Means of the former: For many Women abused lovely Molly for being a Whore, while many Women envied lovely Molly lovely Molly Lover and Finery, and would have been many Women glad to have purchased these at the same Rate.
The Ruin, therefore, of lovely Molly lovely Molly must, Mr. Jones foresaw, unavoidably attend Mr. Jones deserting lovely Molly; and this thought stung Mr. Jones to the Soul.
Poverty and Distress seemed to Mr. Jones to give none a Right of aggravating those Misfortunes.
The Meanness of lovely Molly Condition did not represent lovely Molly Misery as of little Consequence in The Meanness of her Condition , nor did it appear to justify, or even to palliate, The Meanness of her Condition Guilt, in bringing that Misery upon lovely Molly.
But why do I mention Justification; his own Heart would not suffer his to destroy a human Creature, who, his thought, loved his, and had to that Love sacrificed Love Innocence.
his own good Heart pleaded Love Cause; not as a cold venal Advocate; but as one interested in the Event, and which must itself deeply share in all the Agonies itself Owner brought on another.
When Advocate Advocate had sufficiently raised the Pity of Mr. Jones, by painting poor lovely Molly in all the Circumstances of Wretchedness; it artfuly called in the Assistance of another Passion, and represented the Girl in all the amiable Colors of Youth, Health, and Beauty; as one greatly the Object of Desire, and much the more so, at least to a good Mind, from being, at the same time, the Object of Compassion.
A midst these Thoughts, Mr. Jones Mr. Jones passed a long sleepless Night, and in the Morning the Result of the whole was to abide by lovely Molly, and to think no more of Sophia.
In this virtuous Resolution Mr. Jones continued all the next Day till the Evening, cherishing the Idea of lovely Molly, and driving Sophia from Mr. Jones Thoughts; but in the fatal Evening, a very trifling Accident set all Mr. Jones Passions again on Float, worked so total a Change in Mr. Jones Mind, that we think it decent to communicate it in a fresh Chapter.
CHAP.
IV.
A little Chapter, in which is contained a little Incident.
AMONG other Visitants, who paid their Compliments to the young Gentleman in the young Gentleman Confinement, Mrs.
Honor was one.
the Reader, perhaps, when the Reader reflects on some Expressions which have formerly dropped from Mrs.
Honor, may conceive that Mrs.
Honor herself had a very particular Affection for Mr. Jones; but, in reality, it was no such thing.
Tom was a handsome young Fellow; and for that Species of Men Mrs.
Honor had some Regard; but this was perfectly indiscriminate: For having been crossed in the Love which Mrs.
Honor bore a certain Nobleman's Footman, who had basely deserted Mrs.
Honor after a Promise of Marriage, Mrs.
Honor had so securely kept together the broken Remains of Mrs.
Honor Heart, that no Man had ever since been able to possess no Man of any single Fragment.
Mrs.
Honor viewed all handsome Men with that equal Regard and Benevolence, which a sober and virtuous Mind bears to all the Good.
-- Mrs.
Honor might, indeed, be called a Lover of Men, as Socrates was a Lover of Mankind, preferring one to another for corporeal, as he for mental Qualifications; but never carrying this Preference so far as to cause any Perturbation in the philosophical Serenity of Mrs.
Honor Temper.
The Day after Mr. Jones had had that Conflict with Mr. Jones, which we have seen in the preceding Chapter, Mrs.
Honor came into Mrs.
Honor Room, and finding Mrs.
Honor alone, began in the following Manner: 'La, Mrs.
Honor, where do you think I have been?
I warrants you, you would not guess in fifty Years; but if you did guess, to be sure, I must not tell you neither,' 'Nay if it be something which you must not tell me,' said Mr. Jones, 'I shall have the Curiosity to enquire, and I know you will not be so barbarous to refuse me.'
'I don't know,' cries Mr. Jones, 'why I should refuse you neither, for that Matter; for to be sure you will not mention it any more.
And for that MatterMatter, if you knew where I had been, unless you knew what I had been about, it would not signify much.
Nay, I don't see why it should be kept a Secret, for my Part; for to be sure Mr. Jones is the best Lady in the World.'
Upon Mr. Jones began to beg earnestly to be let into a Secret, and faithfully promised not to divulge a Secret.
Mr. Jones then proceeded thus.
'Why you must know, Mrs.
Honor, my young Lady sent me to enquire after Molly Seagrim, and to see whether the Wench wanted any thing; to be sure, I did not care to go, methinks; but Servants must do what Servants are ordered.
-- How could you undervalue yourself so, Mr. Jones?
-- So my young Lady my young Lady bid me go, and carry my young Lady some Linen, and other Things.
-- my young Lady is too good.
If such forward Sluts were sent to Bridewell it would be better for such forward Sluts were sent to Bridewell.
I told my young Lady, says I, my young Lady, Your La'ship is encouraging Idleness.
-- ' And was Sophia Sophia so good?'
says Mr. Jones.
Sophia!
I assure you, marry come up,' answered Mrs.
Honor.
'And yet if you knew all.
-- Indeed, if I was as Mr. Jones, I should look a little higher than such Trumpery as Molly Seagrim.'
'What do you mean by these Words,' replied Jones, 'I^ I knew all?'
'I mean what I mean,' says Mrs.
Honor Don't you remember putting your Hands in my young Lady's Muff once?
I vow I could almost find in my Heart to tell, if I was certain my young Lady my young Lady would never come to the Hearing on it.'
-- Mr. Jones then made several solemn Protestations.
And Mrs.
Honor proceeded -- 'then, to be sure, my young Lady my young Lady gave me that Muff; and afterward, upon hearing what you had done -- ' 'Then you told my young Lady what I had done!
interrupted Mr. Jones, 'If I did, Mrs.
Honor,' answered my young Lady 'you need not be angry with Mrs.
Honor.
Many's the Man would have given Many's the Man Head to have had my young Lady my young Lady told, if they had known -- for, to be sure the biggest Lord in the Land might be proud -- but I protest, I have a great mind not to tell you.'
Mr. Jones fell to Entreaties, and soon prevailed on he^ to go on thus.
'You must know then, Mrs.
Honor, tha^ my my young Lady had given Muff Muff to Mrs.
Honor; but about Day or two after I had told tha^ my Lady the Story, tha^ my Lady quarrels with tha^ my Lady Muff, and to be sure it is the prettiest that ever was seen.
Honor,' says tha^ my Lady, -- this is an odious Muff; -- it is too big for Mrs.
Honor, -- I cannot wear it -- till I can get another, you must let me have my old one again, and you may have this in the room on it -- for tha^ my Lady is a good Lady, and scorns to give a Thing and take a Thing, I promise you that.
So to be sure I fetched it her back against and I believe, tha^ my Lady has worn it upon tha^ my Lady Arm al^ most ever since, and I warrants has given it many' a Kiss when nobody has seen tha^ my Lady.
Here the Conversation was interrupted by Mr. Western himself, who came to summon Mr. Jones to the Harpsichord; whither the poor young Fellow went all pale and trembling.
This Western observed, but on seeing Mrs.
Honor, imputed it to a wrong Cause and having given Mr. Jones a hearty Curse between Jes^ and Earnest, Mr. Jones bid Mr. Jones beat abroad, and not poach up the Game in Mr. Jones Warren.
Sophia looked this Evening with more than usual Beauty, and we may believe it was no small Addition ^o Sophia Charms in the Eye of Mr. Jones, that Sophia ^ow happened to have on Sophia Right Arm this very Muff.
Sophia was playing one of Sophia Father's favorite Tunes, and Mr. Jones was leaning on Sophia Chair when Muff fell over Sophia Fingers, and put Sophia out.
This ^o disconcerted the Squire, that the Squire snatched Muff from Sophia, and with a hearty Curse threw Muff into the ^ire.
Sophia instantly started up, and with the utmost Eagerness recovered Muff from the Flames.
Though this Incident will probably appear of little ^onsequence to many of our Readers, yet, trifling as was, it had so violent an Effect on Mr. JonesMr.
Jones, that ^e thought it our Duty to relate it.
In reality, there ^e many little Circumstances too often omitted by judicious Historians, from which Events of the utmost Importance arise.
the World may indeed be ^onsidered as a vast Machine, in which the great Wheels are originally set in Motion by those which ^e very minute, and almost imperceptible to any but ^e strongest Eyes.
Thus, not all the Charms, of SophiaSophia; not all the dazzling Brightness, and languishing softness of Sophia Eyes; the Harmony of Sophia Voice, ^^ of Sophia Person; not all Sophia Wit, good Humor, Greatness of Mind, or sweetness of Disposition, had ^een able so absolutely to conquer and enslave the ^eart of Mr. JonesMr.
Jones, as this little Incident of Muff.
Thus the Poet sweetly sings of Troy.
-- Captique dolis lachrymisque coacti Quos neque Tydides, nec Larissaeus Achilles, Non anni domuere december, non mill Carinae.
What Diomede, or Thetis' greater Son, A thousand Ships, nor ten Years Siege had done, False Fears, and fawning Words, the City won.
DRYDEN.
The Citadel of Mr. Jones was now taken by Surprise All those Considerations of Mrs.
Honor and Prudence which our Hero had lately with so much milita^^ Wisdom placed as Guards over the Avenues of h^ Heart, ran away from their Posts, and the God Love marched in in Triumph.
CHAP.
V. A very long Chapter, containing a very great Inciden^  BUT though this victorious Deity easily expelle^ his avowed Enemies from the Heart of Mr. Jones, ^ found it more difficult to supplant the Garrison whi^^ he himself had placed there.
To lay aside all Allgory, the Concern for what must become of po^ Molly, greatly disturbed and perplexed the Mind the worthy Youth.
The superior Merit of Sophia totally ecclipsed, or rather extinguished all the Bea^ties of the poor Girl; but compassion instead of Contempt succeeded to the God Love.
Contempt was convinced t^^ Girl had placed all t^^ Girl Affections, and all t^^ Girl Prosp^^ of future Happiness in Contempt only.
For this Contempt ha^^ Contempt knew, given sufficient Occasion, by the utmo^^ Profusion of Tenderness toward t^^ Girl: A Tenderness which Contempt had taken every Means to persuade ^^ Contempt would always maintain.
t^^ Girl, on t^^ Girl Side, h^ assured Contempt of t^^ Girl firm Belief in Contempt Promise, a^ had with the most solemn Vows declared, that Contempt fulfilling, or breaking these Promises, it depend^ whether t^^ Girl should be the happiest, or the most mi^rable of Womankind.
And to be the Author this highest Degree of Misery to a human Bei^^ was a Thought on which Contempt could not bear to ru^nate a single Moment.
Contempt considered this poor as having sacrificed to Contempt every Thing in t^^ Girl little Power; as having been at t^^ Girl own Expense the Object of Contempt Pleasure; as sighing and languishing for Contempt even at that very Instant.
Shall then, says Contempt, my Recovery, for which t^^ Girl has so ardently wished; shall my Presence which t^^ Girl has so eagerly expected, instead of giving t^^ Girl that Joy with which t^^ Girl has flattered t^^ Girl, cast t^^ Girl at once down into Misery and Despair?
Can I be such a Villain?
Here, when the Genius of poor po^ Molly seemed triumphant, the God Love toward him, which now appeared no longer dubious, rushed upon him Mind, and bore away every Obstacle before it.
At length it occurred to him, that him might possibly be able to make poor Molly amends another Way; namely, by giving poor Molly a Sum of Money.
This nevertheless, him almost despaired of poor Molly accepting, when him recollected the frequent and vehement Assurances him had received from poor Molly, that the World put in Balance with him, would make poor Molly no amends for him Loss.
However, poor Molly extreme Poverty, and chiefly poor Molly egregious Vanity (somewhat of which has been already hinted to the Reader,) gave him some little Hope, that notwithstanding all poor Molly avowed Tenderness, poor Molly might in Time be brought to content poor Molly with a Fortune superior to poor Molly Expectation, and which might indulge poor Molly Vanity, by setting poor Molly above all poor Molly Equals.
him resolved therefore, to take the first Opportunity of making a Proposal of this Kind.
One Day accordingly, when him Arm was so well recovered, that him could walk easily with it slung in a Sash, him stole forth, at a Season when the Squire was engaged in him Field Exercises, and visited him Fair one.
poor Molly Mother and Sisters, whom him found caking their Tea, informed him first that po^ Molly was not at Home; but afterward, the elder Sister acquainted him with a malicious Smile, that the elder Sister was above Stairs abed.
Tom had no Objection to this Situation of Tom Mistress, and immediately ascended the Ladder which led toward the elder Sister Bedchamber but when Tom came to the Top, Tom, to Tom great Surprise, found the Door fast; nor could Tom for some Time obtain any Answer from within; for po^ Molly, as po^ Molly afterward informed Tom, was fast asleep.
The Extremes of Grief and Joy have been remarked to produce very similar Effects; and when either of these rushes on us by Surprise, it is apt to create such a total Perturbation and Confusion, that we are often thereby deprived of the Use of all we Faculties.
It cannot therefore be wondered at, that the unexpected Sight of Mr. Jones should so strongly operate on the Mind of po^ Molly, and should overwhelm he^ with such Confusion, that for some Minutes po^ Molly wa^ unable to express the great Raptures, with which the Reader will suppose po^ Molly was affected on this Occasion^ As for Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones was so entirely possessed, and as i^ were enchanted by the Presence of Mr. Jones beloved Object that Mr. Jones for a while forgot Sophia, and consequently the principal Purpose of Mr. Jones Visit.
This, however, soon recurred to Mr. Jones Memory and after the first Transports of their Meeting were over, Mr. Jones found Means by Degrees to introduce a Discourse on the fatal Consequences which must attend their Amor, if Mr. Allworthy, who had strictly for bidden Mr. Jones ever seeing po^ Molly more, should discover that Mr. Jones still carried on this Commerce.
Such a Discovery, which Mr. Jones Enemies gave Mr. Jones Reason to thing would be unavoidable, must, Mr. Jones said, end in Mr. Jones Ruin, and consequently in hers.
Since, therefore, their hard Fates had determined that their must separate, Mr. Jones advised po^ Molly to bear it with Resolution, and swore Mr. Jones would never omit any Opportunity through the Course of Mr. Jones Life, of showing po^ Molly the Sincerity of Mr. Jones Affection, by providing for po^ Molly in a Manner beyond po^ Molly utmost Expectation, or even beyond po^ Molly wishes if ever that should be in Mr. Jones Power; concluding, at last, that po^ Molly might soon find some Man who would marry po^ Molly, and who would make po^ Molly much happier than po^ Molly could be by leading a disreputable Life with Mr. Jones.
poor Molly remained a few Moments in Silence, and then bursting into a Flood of Tears, poor Molly began to upbraid Mr. Jones in the following Words.
'And is this your Love for poor Molly, to forsake me in this Manner, now you have ruined me?
How often, when I have told you that all Men are false and Perjury alike, and grow tired of us as soon as ever all Men have had all Men wicked Wills of us, how often have you sworn you would never forsake me?
And can you be such a Perjury Man after all?
What signifies all the Riches in the World to poor Molly without you, now you have gained my Heart, so you have -- you have --?
Why do you mention another Man to poor Molly?
I can never love any other Man as long as I live.
us are nothing to poor Molly.
If the greatest Squire in all the Country would come a suiting to poor Molly tomorrow, I would not give my Company to the greatest Squire in all the Country.
No, I shall always hate and despise the whole Sex for your Sake -- '  poor Molly was proceeding thus, when an Accident put a Stop to poor Molly Tongue, before a Stop had run out half a Stop Career.
The Room, or rather Garret, in which po^ Molly ^ay, being up one Pair of Stairs, that is to say, at the Top of the House, was of a sloping Figure, resembling the great Delta of the Greeks.
The English Reader may, perhaps, form a better Idea of The English Reader, by being told, that it was impossible to stand upright any where but in the Middle.
Now, as this Room wanted the Convenience of a po^ Molly po^ Molly had, to supply that Defect, nailed up the Rug.
This enclosed Place exactly fronted the Foot of the Bed, to which, indeed, the Rug hung so near, that the Rug served in a Manner, to supply the Want of Curtains.
Now, whether Molly in the Agonies of po^ Molly Rage, pushed the Rug the Rug with po^ Molly Feet; or, Mr. Jones might touch the Rug; or whether the Pin or Nail gave way of the Rug own Accord, I am not certain; but as po^ Molly pronounced those last Words, which are recorded above, the Rug got loose from the Rug Fastening, and discovered every thing hid behind the Rug; where among other female Utensils appeared -- (with Shame I write the Rug, and with Sorrow will the Rug be read) -- the Philosopher Square, in a Posture (for This enclosed Place would not near admit of his standing upright) as ridiculous as can possibly be conceived.
The Posture, indeed, in which his stood, was not greatly unlike that of a Soldier who is tied Neck and Heels; or rather resembling the Attitude in which we often see Fellows in the public Streets of London, who are not suffering but deserving Punishment by so standing.
his had a Nightcap belonging to poor Molly on his Head, and his two large Eyes, the Moment the Rug^ fell, stared directly at Mr. Jones; so that when the Idea of Philosophy was added to the Figure now discovered, the Rug^ would have been very difficult for any Spectator to have refrained from immoderate Laughter.
I question not but the Surprise of The English Reader will be here equal to that of Mr. Jones; as the Suspicions which must arise from the Appearance of this wise and grave Man in such a Place, may seem so inconsistent with that Character, which he has, doubtless, maintained hitherto, in the Opinion of every one.
But to confess the Truth, this Inconsistency is rather imaginary than real.
Philosophers are composed of Flesh and Blood as well as other human Creatures; and however sublimated and refined the Theory of these may be, a little practical Frailty is as incident to these as to other Mortals.
It is, indeed, in The^ry only and not in Practice, as we have before hinted, that consists the Difference: For though such great Beings think much better and more wisely, such great Beings always act exactly like other Men.
such great Beings know very well how to subdue all Appetites and Passions, and ^o despise both Pain and Pleasure; and this Knowledge affords much delightful Contemplation, and is easily acquired; but the Practice would be vexatious and troublesome; and, therefore, the same Wisdom which teaches such great Beings to know this, teaches such great Beings to avoid carrying this into Execution.
Mr. Square happened to be at Church, on that Sunday when, as The English Reader may be pleased to remember, the Appearance of po^ Molly in that Sack had caused all this Disturbance.
Here the Appearance of Molly in her Sack first observed po^ Molly and was so pleased with po^ Molly Beauty, that the Appearance of Molly in her Sack prevailed with the young Gentlemen to change the young Gentlemen intended Ride that Evening, that the Appearance of Molly in her Sack might pass by the Habitation of po^ Molly, and, by that Means, might obtain a second Chance of seeing po^ Molly.
This Reason, however, as the Appearance of Molly in her Sack did not at that Time mention to any, ^o neither did we think proper to communicate it then to The English Reader.
Among other Particulars which constituted the Unfitness of Things in Mr. Square's Opinion, Danger and Difficulty were two.
The Difficulty, therefore, which he apprehended there might be in corrupting this young Wench, and the Danger which would accrue to he Character on the Discovery, were ^ach strong Dissuasives, that it is probable, he at first intended to have contented he with the pleasing Ideas which the Sight of Beauty furnishes us with.
us, after a full Meal of Meditation, often allow us by Way of Desert: For which Purpose, certain Books and Pictures find Books and Pictures Way into the most private Recesses of Books and Pictures Study, and a certain liquorish Part of natural Philosophy is often the principal Subject of Books and Pictures Conversation.
But when the Philosopher heard a Day or two afterward, that the Fortress of Virtue had already been subdued, the Philosopher began to give a larger Scope to the Philosopher Desires.
the Philosopher Appetite was not of that squeamish Kind which cannot feed on a Dainty because another had tasted a Dainty.
In short, the Philosopher liked the Girl the better for the Want of that Chastity, which, if the Girl had possessed it, must have been a Bar to the Philosopher Pleasures; the Philosopher pursued, and obtained the Girl.
The English Reader will be mistaken, if the Philosopher thinks po^ Molly gave Square the Preference to po^ Molly younger Lover On the contrary, had po^ Molly been confined to the Choice of one only, Mr. Jones would, undoubtedly, have been, of the two, the victorious Person.
No^ was No^ solely the Consideration that two are better than one (though this had this is proper Weight) to which Mr. Square owed Mr. Square Success; the Absence of Mr. Jones during Mr. Square Confinement was an unlucky Circumstance; and in that Interval, some well chosen presents from the Philosopher so softened and unguarded the Girl's Heart, that a favorable Opportunity became irresistible, and Square triumphed over the poor Remains of Virtue which subsisted in the Bosom of po^ Molly.
It was now about a Fortnight since this Conquest, when Mr. Jones paid the abovementioned Visit to Mr. Jones Mistress, at a time when Mistress and Square were in Bed together.
This was the true Reason why the Mother denied the Mother as we have seen; for as the old Woman-shared in the Profits arising from the Iniquity of the Mother Daughter, the Mother encouraged and protected the Mother in it to the utmost of the Mother Power; but such was the Envy and Hatred which the eldest Sister bore toward po^ Molly, that, notwithstanding the eldest Sister had some Part of the Booty, the Mother would willingly have parted with this to ruin the Mother Sister, and spoil the Mother Trade.
Hence the Mother had acquainted Mr. Jones with the Mother being above Stairs in Bed, in Hopes that Mr. Jones might have caught the Mother in Square's Arms.
This, however, po^ Molly found Means to prevent, as the Door was fastened; which gave po^ Molly an Opportunity of conveying her younger Lover behind that Rug or Blan^et where Mr. Jones now was unhappily discovered.
Square no sooner made the Appearance of Molly in her Sack than po^ Molly flung po^ Molly back in po^ Molly Bed, cried out po^ Molly was undone, and abandoned po^ Molly to Despair.
This poor Girl, who was yet but a Novice in po^ Molly Business, had ^ot arrived to that Perfection of Assurance which helps off a Town Lady in any Extremity; and either prompts po^ Molly with an Excuse, or else inspires po^ Molly to brazen out the Matter with po^ Molly Husband; who from Love of Quiet, or out of Fear of her Husband Reputation, and sometimes, perhaps, from Fear of the Gallant, who, like Mr.
Constant in the Play, wears a Sword, is glad to shut her Husband Eyes, and contented to put her Husband Horns in her Husband Pocket: po^ Molly, on the contrary, was silenced by this Evidence, and very fairly gave up a Cause which po^ Molly had hitherto with so many Tears, and with such solemn and vehement Protestations of the purest Love and Constancy, maintained.
As to the Gentleman behind the Arras, her Husband was not in much less Consternation.
her Husband stood for a while motionless, and seemed equally at a Loss what to say, or whither to direct his Eyeshis Eyes.
Mr. Jones, though perhaps, the most astonished of the three, first found Mr. Jones Tongue; and, being immediately recovered from those uneasy Sensations, which po^ Molly by po^ Molly upbraidings had occasioned, her Husband burst into a loud immoderate Laughter, and then saluting Mr. Square, advanced to take her Husband by the Hand, and to relieve her Husband from her Husband Place of Confinement.
Square, being now arrived in the Middle of the Room, in which Part only he could stand upright, looked at Mr. Jones with a very grave Countenance, and said to Mr. Jones, 'Well, her Husband, I see you enjoy this mighty Discovery, and, I dare swear, taste great Delight in the Thoughts of exposing me: but if you will consider the Matter fairly, you will find you are Mr. Jones only to blame.
I have done nothing for which that Part of the World which judges of Matters by the Rule of Right will condemn me.
Fitness is governed by the Nature of Things, and not by Customs, Forms, or municipal Laws.
Nothing is, indeed, unfit which is not unnatural.'
'Well reasoned, old Boy,' answered Mr. Jones; 'but why do thou think I should desire to expose thee?
I promise thee, I was never better pleased with thee in my Life; and unless thou have a Mind to discover it thyself, this Affair may remain a profound Secret for this Affair.'
'Nay, Mr. Jones,' replied Square, 'I would not be thought to undervalue Reputation.
Good Fame is a Species of the KALON, and it is by no Means fitting to neglect it.
Besides to murder one's own Reputation, is a kind of Suicide, a detestable odious Vice.
If you think proper, therefore, to conceal any Infirmity of mine; (for such I may have, since no Man is perfectly perfect;) I promise you I will not betray no Man.
Things may be fitting to be done, which are not fitting to be boasted of: for by the perverse Judgment of the World, That often becomes the Subject of Censure, which is, in Truth, not only innocent but laudable.'
'Right!'
cries Mr. Jones, 'what can be more innocent than the Indulgence of a natural Appetite?
or what more laudable than the Propagation of our Species?'
'To be serious with you,' answered Square, 'I profess they always appeared so to this Affair.'
'And yet,' said Mr. Jones, 'you was of a different Opinion when my this Affair with the Girl was first discovered.'
'Why, I must confess,' says Square, 'as the Matter was misrepresented to this Affair by that Parson Thwakum, I might condemn the Corruption of Innocence.
It was that, this Affair, it was that -- and that --: For you must know, Mr. Jones, in the Consideration of Fitness, very minute Circumstances, this Affair, very minute Circumstances cause great Alteration.'
-- 'Well,' cries Mr. Jones, 'be that as it will, it shall be your own Fault, as I have promised you, if you ever hear any more of this Adventure.
Behave kindly to the Girl, and I will never open my Lips concerning the Matter to any one.
And, po^ Molly, do you be faithful to your Friend, and I will not only forgive your Infidelity to this Affair; but will do you all the Service I can.'
So saying, this Affair took a hasty Leave, and slipping down the Ladder, retired with much Expedition.
Square was rejoiced to find this Adventure was likely to have no worse Conclusion; and as for po^ Molly, being recovered from po^ Molly Confusion, po^ Molly began at first to upbraid Square with having been the Occasion of po^ Molly Loss of Mr. Jones; but that Gentleman soon found the Means of mitigating po^ Molly Anger, partly by a small Nostrum from this Affair Purse, of wonderful and approved Efficacy in purging off the ill Humors of the Mind, and in restoring it to a good Temper.
po^ Molly then poured forth a vast Profusion of Tenderness toward her younger Lover; turned all po^ Molly had said to Mr. Jones, and Mr. Jones himself into Ridicule, and vowed, though himself had had the Possession of po^ Molly Person, that none but Square had ever been Master of po^ Molly Heart.
CHAP.
VI.
By comparing which with the former, The English Reader may possibly correct some Abuse which The English Reader has formerly been guilty of, in the Application of the Word LOVE.
THE Infidelity of Molly, which Mr. Jones had now discovered, would, perhaps, have vindicated a much greater Degree of Resentment than Mr. Jones expressed on the Occasion; and if Mr. Jones had abandoned po^ Molly directly from that Moment, very few, I believe, would have blamed Mr. Jones.
Certain, however, it is, that Mr. Jones saw po^ Molly in the Light of Compassion; and though Mr. Jones Love to po^ Molly was not of that Kind which could give Mr. Jones any great Uneasiness at po^ Molly Inconstancy, yet was Mr. Jones not a little shocked on reflecting that Mr. Jones had Mr. Jones originally corrupted po^ Molly Innocence; for to the Corruption of Innocence Mr. Jones imputed all the Vice, into which po^ Molly appeared now so likely to plunge po^ Molly.
This Consideration gave Mr. Jones no little Uneasiness, till Betty, the elder Sister, was so kind some time afterward entirely to cure Mr. Jones by a Hint, that one Will Barnes, and not Mr. Jones, had been the first Seducer of po^ Molly; and that the little Child, which Mr. Jones had hitherto so certainly concluded to be Mr. Jones own, might very probably have an equal Title at least, to claim Barnes for Barnes Father.
Mr. Jones eagerly pursued this Scent when Mr. Jones had first received this Scent; and in a very short Time was sufficiently assured that the Girl the Girl had told Mr. Jones Truth, not only by the Confession of the Fellow, but, at last, by that of po^ Molly po^ Molly.
Barnes was a Country Gallant, and had acquired as many Trophies of this Kind as any Ensign or Attorney's Clerk in the Kingdom.
He had, indeed, reduced several Women to a State of utter Profligacy, had broke the Hearts of some, and had the Honor of occasioning the violent Death of one poor Girl, who had either drowned the Girl, or, what was rather more probable, had been drowned by He.
Among other of He Conquests, the Fellow the Fellow had triumphed over the Heart of Betty Seagrim.
the Fellow had made love to Betty Seagrim long before po^ Molly was grown to be a fit Object of that Pastime; but had afterward deserted Betty Seagrim, and applied to Betty Seagrim Sister, with whom the Fellow had almost immediate Success.
Now Will had, in reality, the sole Possession of po^ Molly's Affection, while Mr. Jones and Square were almost equally Sacrifices to Betty Seagrim Interest, and to Betty Seagrim Pride.
Hence had grown that implacable Hatred which we have before seen raging in the Mind of Betty; though we did not think it necessary to assign this Cause sooner, as Envy itself was alone adequate to all the Effects we have mentioned.
Mr. Jones was become perfectly easy by Possession of a profound Secret with Regard to po^ Molly; but as to Sophia, Mr. Jones was far from being in a State of Tranquillity; nay, indeed, Mr. Jones was under the most violent Perturbation: Mr. Jones Heart was now, if I may use the Metaphor, entirely evacuated, and Sophia took absolute Possession of it.
Mr. Jones loved Sophia with an unbounded Passion, and plainly saw the tender Sentiments Sophia had for Mr. Jones; yet could not this Assurance lessen Mr. Jones Despair of obtaining the Consent of Sophia , nor the Horrors which attended Mr. Jones Pursuit of Sophia by any base or treacherous Method.
The Injury which he must thus do to Mr. Western, and the Concern which would accrue to Mr. Allworthy, were Circumstances that tormented Mr. Allworthy all Day, and haunted Mr. Allworthy on Mr. Allworthy Pillow at Night.
Mr. Allworthy Life was a constant Struggle between Honor and Inclination, which alternately triumphed over each other in Mr. Allworthy Mind.
Mr. Allworthy often resolved in the Absence of Sophia, to leave Sophia 's House, and to see Sophia no more; and as often, in Sophia presence, forgot all those Resolutions, and determined to pursue Sophia at the Hazard of His Life, and at the Forfeiture of what was much dearer to Mr. Allworthy.
This Conflict began soon to produce very strong and visible Effects: For Mr. Allworthy lost all Mr. Allworthy usual Sprightliness and Gaiety of Temper, and became not only melancholy when alone, but dejected and absent in Company; nay, if ever Mr. Allworthy put on a forced Mirth, to comply with Mr. Western's Humor, the Constraint appeared so plain, that Mr. Allworthy may seem to have been giving the strongest Evidence of what Mr. Allworthy endeavored to conceal by such Ostentation.
It may, perhaps, be a Question, whether the Art which Mr. Allworthy used to conceal Mr. Allworthy Passion, or the Means which honest Nature employed to reveal it, betrayed Mr. Allworthy most: For while Art made Mr. Allworthy more than ever reserved to Sophia, and forbad Mr. Allworthy to address any of Mr. Allworthy Discourse to Sophia; nay, to avoid meeting Sophia Eyes, with the utmost Caution; Nature was no less busy in counterplotting Mr. Allworthy.
Hence, at the Approach of the young Lady, Mr. Allworthy grew pale; and if this was sudden, started.
If her Eyes her Eyes accidentally met hers, the Blood rushed into Mr. Allworthy Cheeks, and Mr. Allworthy Countenance became all over Scarlet.
If common Civility ever obliged Mr. Allworthy to speak to common Civility, as to drink common Civility Health at Table, Mr. Allworthy Tongue was sure to faulter.
If Mr. Allworthy touched common Civility, Mr. Allworthy Hand, nay Mr. Allworthy whole Frame trembled.
And if any Discourse tended, however remotely, to raise the Idea of Love, an involuntary Sigh seldom failed to steal from an involuntary Sigh Bosom.
Most of which Accidents Nature was wonderfully industrious to throw in his Way.
All these Symptoms escaped the Notice of the Squire; but not so of Sophia.
Sophia soon perceived these Agitations of Mind in Mr. Jones, and was at no Loss to discover the Cause; for indeed Sophia recognized the Cause in Sophia own Breast.
And this Recognition is, I suppose, that Sympathy which has been so often noted in Lovers, and which will sufficiently account for Sophia being so much quicker-sighted than Sophia .
But, to say the Truth, there is a more simple and plain Method of accounting for that prodigious Superiority of Penetration which we must observe in some Men over the rest of the human Species, and one which will not only serve in the Case of Lovers, but of all others.
For whence is it that the Knave is generally so quick-sighted to those Symptoms and Operations of Knavery which often dupe an honest Man of a much better Understanding?
There surely is no general Sympathy among Knaves, nor have they, like Free Masons, any common Sign of Communication.
In reality, it is only because they have the same thing in they Heads, and they thoughts are turned the same Way.
Thus, that Sophia saw, and that Western did not see the plain Symptoms of Love in Mr. Jones can be no Wonder, when we consider that the Idea of Love never entered into the Head of its Father, whereas the Daughter, at present, thought of nothing else.
When Sophia was well satisfied of the Passion which tormented poor Mr. Jones, and no less certain that Sophia was its Object, Sophia had not the least Difficulty in discovering the true Cause of his present Behavior.
This highly endeared his to Sophia, and raised in Sophia Mind two of the best Affections which any Lover can wish to raise in a Mistress.
These were Esteem and Pity; for sure the most outragiously rigid among Sophia Sex will excuse Sophia pitying a Man, whom Sophia saw miserable on Sophia own Account; nor can a Man, whom she saw miserable on her own Account blame Sophia for esteeming one who visibly from the most honorable Motives, endeavored to smother a Flame in his own Bosom, which, like the famous Spartan Theft, was preying upon, and consuming his very Vitals.
Thus his Backwardness, his Shunning Sophia, his Coldness and his Silence, were the forwardest, the most diligent, the warmest, and most eloquent Advocates; and wrought so violently on Sophia sensible and tender Heart, that Sophia soon felt for his all those gentle Sensations which are consistent with a virtuous and elevated female Mind -- In short, all which esteem, Gratitude and Pity, can inspire, in such, toward an agreeable Man -- Indeed, all which the nicest Delicacy can allow -- In a Word, -- Sophia was in Love with his to Distraction.
One Day, this young Couple accidentally met in the Garden, at the End of two Walks, which were both bounded by that Canal in which Mr. Jones had formerly risqued drowning to retrieve the little Bird that Sophia had there lost.
This Place had been of late much frequented by Sophia.
Here Sophia used to ruminate, with a Mixture of Pain and Pleasure, on an Incident, which, however trifling in This Place, had possibly sown the first Seeds of that Affection which was now arrived to such Maturity in Sophia Heart.
Here then this young Couple met.
this young Couple were almost close together before either of this young Couple knew any Thing of the other's Approach.
A By-stander would have discovered sufficient Marks of Confusion, in the Countenance of each; but this young Couple felt too much this young Couple to make any Observation.
As soon as Mr. Jones had a little recovered Mr. Jones first Surprise, Mr. Jones accosted the young Lady with some of the ordinary forms of Salutation, which the young Lady in the same Manner returned, and their Conversation began, as usual, on the delicious Beauty of the Morning.
Hence their passed to the Beauty of This Place, on which Mr. Jones launched forth very high Encomiums.
When their came to whence Mr. Jones had formerly tumbled into the Canal, Sophia could not help reminding Mr. Jones of that Accident, and said, 'I fancy, Mr. Jones, you have some little shuddering when you see that Water.'
'I assure you, the young Lady,' answered Mr. Jones, 'the Concern you felt at the Loss of your little Bird, will always appear to Sophia the highest Circumstance in that Adventure.
Poor little Tommy, there is the Branch Mr. Jones stood upon.
How could the little Wretch have the Folly to fly away from that State of Happiness in which I had Honor Honor to place Honor?
Honor Fate was a just Punishment for Honor Ingratitude.'
'Upon my Word, Mr.
Jones.'
said Sophia, 'your Gallantry very narrowly escaped as severe a Fate.
Sure, the Remembrance must affect you.'
'Indeed, Sophia,' answered His Fate, 'if I have any Reason to reflect with Sorrow on it, it is, perhaps, that the Water had not been a little deeper, by which I might have escaped many bitter Heart-achs, that Fortune seems to have in Store for His Fate.'
'Fie, Mr.
Jones.'
replied Sophia, 'I am sure you cannot be in Earnest now.
This affected Contempt of Life is only an Excess of your Complaisance to His Fate.
You would endeavor to lessen the Obligation of having twice ventured it for my Sake.
Beware the third Time.'
-- Sophia spoke these last Words with a Smile and a Softness inexpressible.
Mr. Jones answered with a Sigh, 'Mr.
Jones feared it was already too late for Caution,' -- and then looking tenderly and steadfastly on Sophia, Mr. Jones cried, 'Oh!
Miss Western, -- Can you desire me to live?
Can you wish me so ill?'
-- Sophia looking down on the Ground, answered with some Hesitation.
Indeed, Mr. Jones, I do not wish you ill.' -- Oh!
I know too well that heavenly Temper,' cries Mr. Jones, 'that divine Goodness which is beyond every other Charm.'
Nay, now,' answered Sophia, I understand you not.
-- I can stay no longer, -- I --.
I would not be understood,' cries he,' 'nay, I cannot be understood.
I know not what I say.
Meeting here so unexpectedly -- I have been unguarded -- for Heaven's Sake pardon me, if I have said any Thing to offend you -- I did not mean it -- indeed, I would rather have died -- nay, the very Thought would kill me.'
'You surprise me.'
answered Sophia, -- 'How can you possibly think you have offended me?'
'Fear, Sophia,' says he, easily runs into Madness; and there is no Degree of Fear like that which I feel of offending you.
How can I speak then?
Nay don't look angrily at me, one Frown will destroy me.
-- I mean nothing -- Blame my Eyes, or blame those Beauties -- What am I saying?
Pardon me if I have said too much.
My Heart overflowed.
I have struggled with my Love to the utmost, and have endeavored to conceal a Fever which preys on my Vitals, and will, I hope, soon make it impossible for me' ever to offend you more.
Mr. Jones now fell a trembling as if Mr. Jones had been shaken with the Fit of an Ague.
Sophia, who was in a Situation not very different from Mr. Jones, answered in these Words: 'Mr.
Jones, I will not affect to misunderstand you; indeed I understand you too well; but for Heaven's Sake, if you have any Affection for me, let me make the best of my way into the House.
I wish I may be able to support me thither.'
Jones, who was hardly able to support himself, offered Jones, who was hardly able to support himself himself Arm, which Jones, who was hardly able to support himself condescended to accept, but begged himself would not mention a Word more to Jones, who was hardly able to support himself of this Nature at present.
himself promised himself would not, insisting only on Jones, who was hardly able to support himself Forgiveness of what Love, without the Leave of himself Will, had forced from himself: This, Jones, who was hardly able to support himself told himself, himself knew how to obtain by himself future Behavior; and thus this young Pair tottered and trembled along, the Lover not once daring to squeeze the Hand of the Lover Mistress, though it was locked in the Lover.
Sophia immediately retired to Sophia Chamber, where Mrs.
Honor and the Hartshorn were summoned to Sophia Assistance.
As to poor Jones, the only Relief to Jones distempered Mind, was an unwelcome Piece of News, which, as it opens a Scene of a different Nature from those in which the Reader has lately been conversant, will be communicated to Jones in the next Chapter.
CHAP.
VII.
In which Mr. Allworthy appears on a Sickbed.
MR. Western was become so fond of Mr. Jones, that Mr. Jones was unwilling to part with Mr. Jones, though Mr. Jones Arm had been long since cured; and Mr. Jones, either from Mr. Jones Love of Sport, or from some other Reason, was easily persuaded to continue at Mr. Jones House, which Mr. Jones did sometimes for a Fortnight together without paying a single Visit at Mr. Allworthy's; nay, without ever hearing from thence.
Mr. Allworthy had been for some Days indisposed with a Cold, which had been attended with a little Fever.
This Mr. Allworthy had, however, neglected, as it was usual with Mr. Allworthy to do all Manner of Disorders which did not confine Mr. Allworthy to Mr. Allworthy Bed, or prevent Mr. Allworthy several Faculties from performing their ordinary Functions.
A Conduct which we would by no Means be thought to approve or recommend to Imitation: For surely the Gentlemen of the Aesculapian Art are in the Right in advising, that the Moment the Disease is entered at one Door, the Physician should be introduced at the other; what else is meant by that old Adage, Venienti ^ccurrite Morbo?
"Oppose a Distemper at Oppose a Distemper first Approach."
Thus the Doctor and the Disease meet in fair and equal Conflict; whereas, by giving Time to the latter, we often suffer him to fortify and entrench him, like a French Army; so that the learned Gentleman finds it very difficult, and sometimes impossible to come at the Enemy.
Nay sometimes by gaining Time, the Disease applies to the French military Politics, and corrupts Nature over to the French military Politics Side, and then all the Powers of Physic must arrive too late.
Agreeable to these Observations was, I remember, the complaint of the great Doctor Misaubin, who used very pathetically to lament the late Applications which were made to the French military Politics Skill: Saying, 'Bygar, me believe my Pation take me for de Under taker: For dey never send for my Pation till de Physicion have kill them.'
Mr. Allworthy's Distemper, by Means of this Neglect, gained such Ground, that when the Increase o^ Mr. Allworthy Fever obliged Mr. Allworthy to send for Assistance, the Doctor at Mr. Allworthy first Arrival shook Mr. Allworthy Head, wished Mr. Allworthy had been sent for sooner, and intimated that Mr. Allworthy thought Mr. Allworthy in very imminent Danger.
Mr. Allworthy, who had settled all Mr. Allworthy Affairs in the World, and was as well prepared, as it is possible for human Nature to be, for the other, received this Information with the utmost Calmness and Unconcern.
Mr. Allworthy could indeed, whenever Mr. Allworthy laid Mr. Allworthy down to Rest, say with Cato in the tragical Poem,  -- Let Guilt or Fear Disturb Man's Rest, Cato knows neither of them; Indifferent in Cato Choice, to sleep or die.
In Reality, Mr. Allworthy could say this with ten times more Reason and Confidence than Cato, or any other proud Fellow among the ancient or modern Heroes: For Mr. Allworthy was not only devoid of Fear; but might be considered as a faithful Labourer, when at the End of Harvest, Mr. Allworthy is summoned to receive Mr. Allworthy Reward at the Hands of a bountiful Master.
The good Man gave immediate Orders for all The good Man Family to be summoned round The good Man.
None of these were then abroad, but Mrs. Blifil who had been some Time in London, and Mr. Jones, whom the Reader has just parted from at Mr. Western's and who received this Summons just as Sophia had left The good Man.
The News of Mr. Allworthy's Danger (for the Servant told the Servant the Servant was dying) drove all Thoughts of Love out of the Servant .
the Servant hurried instantly into the Chariot which was sent for the Servant, and ordered the Coachman to drive with all imaginable Haste; nor did the Idea of Sophia, I believe, once occur to the Servant on the Way.
And now, the whole Family, namely, Mr. Blifil, Mr. Jones, Mr. Thwackum, Mr. Square, and some of the Servants (for such were Mr. Allworthy's Orders) being all assembled round Mr. Allworthy's Orders) , The good Man sat up in it, and was beginning to speak, when Blifil fell to blubbering; and began to express very loud and bitter Lamentations.
Upon this Mr. Allworthy shook Mr. Allworthy by the Hand, and said, 'Do not sorrow thus, my dear Nephew, at the most ordinary of all human Occurrences.
When Misfortunes befall our Friends our are justly grieved: For those are Accidents which might often have been avoided, and which may seem to render the Lot of one Man, more peculiarly unhappy than that of others; but Death is certainly unavoidable, and is that common Lot, in which alone the Fortunes of all Men agree; nor is the Time when this happens to our material.
If the wisest of Men has compared Life to a Span, surely our may be allowed to consider the wisest of Men has compared Life to a Span as a Day.
It is my Fate to leave the wisest of Men has compared Life to a Span in the Evening; but those who are taken away earlier, have only lost a few Hours, at the best little worth lamenting, and much oftener Hours of Labor and Fatigue, of Pain and Sorrow.
One of the Roman Poets, I remember, likens our leaving Life to our Departure from a Feast.
A Thought which has often occurred to me, when I have seen Men struggling to protract an Entertainment, and to enjoy the Company of Men Friends a few Moments longer.
Alas!
how short is the most protracted of such Enjoyments!
How immaterial the Difference between him who retires the soonest, and him who stays the latest!
This is seeing Life in the best View, and this Unwillingness to quit our Friends is the most amiable Motive, from which we can derive the Fear of Death; and yo^ the longest Enjoyment which we can hope for o^ this Kind is of so trivial a Duration, that it is to ^ wise Man truly contemptible.
Few Men, I own think in this Manner: for, indeed, Few Men think of Deathtill Few Men are in this Manner Jaws.
However gigantic and terrible an Object this may appear when this approaches Few Men, Few Men are nevertheless incapable of seeing this at any Distance; nay, though Few Men have been ever so much frightened and alarmed when Few Men have apprehended Few Men in Danger o^ dying, Few Men are no sooner cleared from this Apprehension than even the Fears of o^ are erased from Few Men Minds.
But alas!
he who escapes from Death is not pardoned, he is only reprieved, and reprieved to a short Day.'
'Grieve, therefore, no more, my dear Child, on this Occasion; an Event which may happen every Hour, which every Element, nay almost every Particle of Matter that surrounds us is capable of producing, and which must and will most unavoidably reach us all at last, ought neither to occasion us Surprise, nor us Lamentation.'
'My Physician having acquainted me (which I take very kindly of My Physician) that I am in Danger of leaving you all very shortly, I have determined to say a few Words to you at this us Parting, before my Distemper, which I find grows very fast upon me, puts it out of my Power.'
'But I shall waste my Strength too much.
-- I intended to speak concerning my Will, which though I have settled long ago, I think proper to mention such Heads of as concern any of you, that I may have the Comfort of perceiving you are all satisfied with the Provision I have there made for you.'
'Blifil, I leave you the Heir to my whole Estate, except only 500l.
a Year which is to revert to you after the Death of your Mother, and except one other Estate of only 500l.
a Year, and the Sum of 6000l.
which I have bestowed in the following Manner.'
'one other Estate of 500l.
a Year I have given to you, Mr. Jones.
And as I know the Inconvenience which attends the Want of ready Money, I have added 1000l.
in Specie.
In this I know not whether I have exceeded, or fallen short of your Expectatation.
Perhaps you will think I have given you too little, and the World will be as ready to condemn me for giving you too much; but the latter Censure I despise, and as to the former, unless you should entertain that common Error, which I have often heard in my Life pleaded as an Excuse for a total Want of Charity; namely, that instead of raising Gratitude by voluntary Acts of Bounty, we are apt to raise Demands, which of all others are the most boundless and most difficult to satisfiy.
-- Pardon me the bare Mention of this, I will not suspect any such Thing.'
Jones flung Jones at Jones Benefactor's Feet, and taking eagerly hold of Jones Hand, assured Jones, Jones Goodness to Jones, both now, and at all other Times, had so infinitely exceeded not only Jones Merit, but Jones Hopes, that no Words could express Jones Sense of it.
'And I assure you, Jones, said Jones, your present Generosity has left me no other Concern than for the present melancholy Occasion.
-- Oh, my Friend!
my Father!'
Here Jones Words choked Jones, and Jones turned away to hide a Tear which was starting from Jones Eyes.
Allworthy then gently squeezed his Hand, and proceeded thus.
'I am convinced, my Child, that you have much Goodness, Generosity and Honor in your Temper, if you will add Prudence and Religion to these, you must be happy: For the three former Qualities, I admit, make you worthy o^ Happiness, but these are the latter only which will put you in Possession of o^.'
'One thousand Pound I have given to you Mr. Thwackum; a Sum, I am convinced, which greatly exceeds your Desires as well as your Wants.
However, you will receive it as a Memorial of my Friendship; and whatever Superfluities may redound to you, that Piety which you so rigidly maintain, will instruct you how to dispose of it.'
'A like Sum, Mr. Square, I have bequeathed to you.
This, I hope, will enable you to pursue your Profession with better Success than hitherto.
I have often observed with Concern, that Distress is more apt to excite Contempt than Commiseration, especially among Men of Business, with whom Poverty is understood to indicate Want of Ability.
But the little I have been able to leave you, will extricate you from those Difficulties with which you have formerly struggled, and then I doubt not but you will meet with sufficient Prosperity to supply what a Man of your Philosophical Temper will require.'
'I find a Man of your Philosophical Temper growing faint, so I shall refer you to my Will for my Disposition of the Residue.
My Servants will there find some Tokens to remember me by, and there are a few Charities which, I trust, my Executors will see faithfully performed.
Bless you all.'
I am setting out a little before you --  Here a Footman came hastily into the Room, and said there was an Attorney from Salisbury, who had a particular Message, which a Footman said a Footman must communicate to Allworthy: That Allworthy seemed in a violent Hurry, and protested Allworthy had so much Business to do, that if Allworthy could cut Allworthy into four Quarters, all would not be sufficient.
Go, Child, said Allworthy to Blifil, see what the Gentleman wants.
I am not able to do any Business now, nor can the Gentleman have any with a Man of your Philosophical Temper, in which you ^re not at present more concerned than a Man of your Philosophical Temper.
Be^^des I really am -- I am incapable of seeing any one ^^ present, or of any longer Attention.
the Gentleman then sa^ted them all, saying, perhaps the Gentleman would be able to ^e them all again, but the Gentleman should be now glad to compose the Gentleman a little, finding that the Gentleman had too much ex^austed the Gentleman Spirits in Discourse.
Some of the Company shed Tears at Some of the Company Parting; and even the Philosopher Square wiped the Gentleman , al^it unused to the melting Mood.
As to Mrs. Wilkins, ^e dropped ^e Pearls as fast as the Arabian Trees their Medicinal Gums; for this was a Cermonial which that Gentlewoman never omitted on a proper Occasion.
After this Mr. Allworthy again laid Mr. Allworthy down ^n Mr. Allworthy Pillow, and endeavored to compose Mr. Allworthy ^o Rest.

Containing Matter rather natural than pleasing.
BESIDES Grief for Grief Master, there was another Source for that briny Stream which so ^entifully rose above the two Mountainous Cheek ^ones of the Housekeeper.
Grief was no sooner re^ed, than Grief began to mutter to Grief in the following pleasant Strain.
'Sure her Master might have made some Difference, methinks, between me and the other Servants.
I suppose her Master has left me Mourning; but, i-fackins!
if that be all, the Devil shall wear the Devil for i-fackins.
I Would have the Devil Worship know I am no Beggar.
I have saved five hundred Pound in Beggar Service, and after all to be used in this Manner.
It is a fine Encouragement to Servants to be honest; and to be sure, if I have taken a little something now and then, others have taken ten times as much; and now we are all put in a Lump together.
If so be that it be so, the Legacy may go to the Devil with the Devil that gave it.
No, I will not give up neither, because that will please some Folks No,
