a large Fortune; that he had a good Heart, and no Family. Hence, doubtless, it will be concluded by many, that he lived like an honest Man, owed no one a Shilling, took nothing but what was his own, kept a good House, entertained his Neighbors with a hearty Welcome at his Table, and was charitable to the Poor, i. e. to those who had rather beg than work, by giving them the Offals from it; that he died immensely rich, and built an Hospital.  And true it is, that he did many of these Things; but, had he done nothing more, I should have left him to have recorded his own Merit on some fair Freestone over the Door of that Hospital. Matters of a much more extraordinary Kind are to be the Subject of this History, or I should grossly mispend my Time in writing so voluminous a Work; and you, my sagacious Friend, might, with equal Profit and Pleasure, travel through some Pages, which certain droll Authors have been facetiously pleased to call The History of England.  Mr. Allworthy had been absent a full Quarter of a Year in London, on some very particular Business, though I know not what it was; but judge of its Importance, by its having detained him so long from home, whence he had not been absent a Month at a Time during the Space of many Years. He came to his House very late in the Evening, and after a short Supper with his Sister, retired much fatigued to his Chamber. Here, having spent some Minutes on his Knees, a Custom which he never broke through on any Account, he was preparing to step into Bed, when, upon opening the Clothes, to his great Surprise, he beheld an Infant, wrapped up in some coarse Linen, in a sweet and profound Sleep, between his Sheets. He stood some Time lost in Astonishment at this Sight; but, as Goodnature was always the Ascendant in his Mind, he soon began to be touched with Sentiments of Compassion for the little Wretch before him. He then rang his Bell, and ordered an elderly Woman Servant to rise immediately and come to him, and in the mean Time was so eager in contemplating the Beauty of Innocence, appearing in those lively Colors with which Infancy and Sleep always display it, that his Thoughts were too much engaged to reflect that he was in his Shirt, when the Matron came in. She had indeed given her Master sufficient Time to dress himself; for out of Respect to him, and Regard to Decency, she had spent many Minutes in adjusting her Hair at the Looking-glass, notwithstanding all the Hurry in which she had been summoned by the Servant, and though her Master, for ought she knew, lay expiring in an Apoplexy, or in some other Fit.  It will not be wondered at, that a Creature, who had so strict a Regard to Decency in her own Person, should be shocked at the least Deviation from it in another. She therefore no sooner opened the Door, and saw her Master standing by the Bedside in his Shirt, with a Candle in his Hand, than she started back in a most terrible Fright, and might perhaps have swooned away, had he not now recollected his being undrest, and put an End to her Terrors, by desiring her to stay without the Door till he had thrown some Clothes over his Back, and was become incapable of shocking the pure Eyes of Mrs. Deborah Wilkins, who, though in' the 52d Year of her Age, vowed she had never beheld a Man without his Coat. Sneerers and profane Wits may perhaps laugh at her first Fright, yet my graver Reader, when he considers the Time of Night, the Summons from her Bed, and the Situation in which she found her Master, will highly justify and applaud her Conduct; unless the Prudence, which must be supposed to attend Maidens at that Period of Life at which Mrs. Deborah had arrived, should a little lessen his Admiration.  When Mrs. Deborah returned into the Room, and was acquainted by her Master with the finding the little Infant, her Consternation was rather greater than his had been; nor could she refrain from crying out with great Horror of Accent as well as Look, 'My good Sir! what is to be done?" Mr. Allworthy answered, she must take care of the Child that Evening, and in the Morning he would give Orders to provide it a Nurse, 'Yes, Sir,' says she,' and I hope your Worship will send out your Warrant to take up the Hussy its Mother (for she must be one of the Neighborhood) and I should be glad to see her committed to Bridewel, and whipped at the Cart's Tail. Indeed such wicked Sluts cannot be two severely punished. I Will warrant it is not her first, by her Impudence in laying it to your Worship.' In laying it to me, Deborah,' answered Allworthy,' 'I cannot think she has any such Design. I suppose she has only taken this Method to provide for her Child; and truly I am glad she has not done worse,' I don't know what is worse,' cries Deborah, than for such wicked Strumpets to lay their Sins at honest Men's Doors; and though your Worship knows your own Innocence, yet the World is censorious; and it has been many an honest Man's Hap to pass for the Father of Children he never begot; and if your Worship should provide for the Child, it may make the People the apter to believe: Besides, why should your Worship provide for what the Parish is obliged to maintain? For my own Part, if it was an honest Man's Child indeed; but for my own Part, it goes against me to touch those misbegotton Wretches, whom I don't look upon as my Fellow Creatures. Faugh, how it stinks! It does not smell like a Christian. If I might be so bold to give my Advice, I would have it put in a Basket, and sent out and laid at the Church-Warden's Door. It is a good Night, only a little rainy and windy; and if it was well wrapped up, and put in a warm Basket, it is two to one but it lives 'till it is found in the Morning. But if it should not, we have discharged our Duty in taking proper care of it; and it is, perhaps, better for such Creatures to die in a state of Innocence, than to grow up and imitate their Mothers; for nothing better can be expected of them.'  There were some Strokes in this Speech which, perhaps, would have offended Mr. Allworthy, had he strictly attended to it; but he had now got one^ of his Fingers into the Infant's Hand, which by its gentle Pressure, seeming to implore his Assistance, had certainly out-pleaded the Eloquence of Mrs. Deborah, had it been ten times greater than it was. He now gave Mrs. Deborah positive Orders to take the Child to her own Bed, and to call up a Maidservant to provide it Pap and other things against it waked. He likewise ordered that proper Clothes should be procured for it early in the Morning, and that it should be brought to himself as soon as he was stirring.  Such was the Discernment of Mrs. Wilkins, and such the Respect she bore her Master, under whom she enjoyed a most excellent Place, that her Scruples gave way to his peremptory Commands; and she took the Child under her Arms, without any apparent Disgust at the Illegality of its Birth; and declaring it was a sweet little Infant, walked off with it to her own Chamber.  Allworthy here betook himself to those pleasing Slumbers, which a Heart that hungers after Goodness is apt to enjoy, when thoroughly satisfied. As these are possibly sweeter than what are occasioned by any other hearty Meal, I should take more Pains to display them to the Reader, if I knew any Air to recommend him to for the procuring such an Appetite.  CHAP. IV. The Reader's Neck brought into Danger by a Description, his Escape and the great Condescension of Miss Bridget Allworthy.  THE Gothic Style of Building could produce nothing nobler than Mr. Allworthy's House. There was an Air of Grandeur in it, that struck you with Awe, and rivaled the Beauties of the best Grecian Architecture; and it was as commodious within, as venerable without.  It stood on the South-east Side of a Hill, but nearer the Bottom than the Top of it, so as to be sheltered from the North-east by a Grove of old Oaks, which rose above it in a gradual Ascent of near half a Mile, and yet high enough to enjoy a most charming Prospect of the Valley beneath.  In the midst of the Grove was a fine Lawn sloping down toward the House, near the Summit of which rose a plentiful Spring, gushing out of a Rock covered with Firs, and forming a constant Cascade of about thirty Foot, not carried down a regular Flight of Steps, but tumbling in a natural Fall over the broken and mossy Stones, till it came to the bottom of the Rock; then running off in a pebly Channel, that with many lesser Falls winded along, till it fell into a Lake at the Foot of the Hill, about a quarter of a Mile below the House on the South Side, and which was seen from every Room in the Front. Out of this Lake, which filled the Center of a beautiful Plain, embellished with Groupes of Beeches and Elms, and fed with Sheep, issued a River, that for several Miles was seen to meander through an amazing Variety of Meadows and Woods, till it emptied itself into the Sea, with a large Arm of which, and an Island beyond it, the prospect was closed.  On the right of this Valley opened another of less Extent, adorned with several Villages, and terminated by one of the Towers of an old ruined Abbey, grown over with Ivy, and Part of the Front which remained still entire.  The left Hand Scene presented the View of a fine Park, composed of very unequal Ground, and agreeably varied with all the Diversity that Hills, Lawns, Wood and Water, laid out with admirable Taste, but owing less to Art than to Nature, could give. Beyond this the Country gradually rose into a Ridge of wild Mountains, the Tops of which were above the Clouds.  It was now the Middle of May, and the Morning was remarkably serene, when Mr. Allworthy walked forth on the Terrace, where the Dawn opened every Minute that lovely Prospect we have before described to his Eye. And now having sent forth Streams of Light, which ascended the blue Firmament before him as Harbingers preceding his Pomp, in the full Blaze of his Majesty, rose the Sun; than which one Object alone in this lower Creation could be more glorious, and that Mr. Allworthy himself presented; a human Being replete with Benevolence, meditating in what manner he might render himself most acceptable to his Creator, by doing most good to his Creatures.  Reader, take care, I have unadvisedly led thee to the Top of as high a Hill as Mr. Allworthy's, and how to get thee down without breaking thy Neck, I do not well know. However, let us even venture to slide down together, for Miss Bridget rings her Bell, and Mr. Allworthy is summoned to Breakfast, where I must attend, and, if you please, shall be glad of your Company.  The usual Compliments having past between Mr. Allworthy and Miss Bridget, and the Tea being poured out, he summoned Mrs. Wilkins, and told his Sister he had a Present for her; for which she thanked him, imagining, I suppose, it had been a Gown or some Ornament for her Person. Indeed, he very often made her such Presents, and she in Complaisance to him spent much time in adorning herself. I say, in Complaisance to him, because she always expressed the greatest Contempt for Dress, and for those Ladies who made it their Study.  But if such was her Expectation, how was she disappointed, when Mrs. Wilkins, according to the Order she had received from her Master, produced the little Infant. Great Surprises, as has been observed, are apt to be silent, and so was Miss Bridget, 'till her Brother began and told her the whole Story, which as the Reader knows already, we shall not repeat.  Miss Bridget had always expressed so great a regard for what the Ladies are pleased to call Virtue, and had herself maintained such a Severity of Character, that it was expected, especially by Wilkins, that she would have vented much Bitterness on this Occasion, and would have voted for sending the Child, as a kind of noxious Animal, immediately out of the House; but on the contrary, she rather took the good-natured side of the question, intimated some Compassion for the helpless little Creature, and commended her Brother's Charity in what he had done.  Perhaps the Reader may account for this Behavior from her Condescension to Mr. Allworthy, when we have informed him, that the good Man had ended his Narrative with owning a Resolution to take care of the Child, and to breed him up as his own; for to acknowledge the Truth, she was always ready to oblige her Brother, and very seldom, if ever, contradicted his Sentiments; she would indeed sometimes make a few Observations, as, that Men were headstrong and must have their own way, and would wish she had been blessed with an independent Fortune; but these were always vented in a low Voice, and at the most amounted only to what is called Muttering.  However, what she withheld from the Infant, she bestowed with the utmost Profuseness on the poor unknown Mother, whom she called an impudent Slut, a wanton Hussy, an audacious Harlot, a wicked Jade, a vile Strumpet, with every other Appellation with which the Tongue of Virtue never fails to lash those who bring a Disgrace on the Sex.  A Consultation was now entered into, how to proceed in order to discover the Mother. A Scrutiny was first made into the Characters of the female Servants of the House, who were all acquitted by Mrs. Wilkins, and with apparent Merit; for she had collected them herself, and perhaps it would be difficult to find such another Set of Scare-crows.  The next Step was to examine among the Inhabitants of the Parish; and this was referred to Mrs. Wilkins, who was to enquire with all imaginable Diligence, and to make her Report in the Afternoon.  Matters being thus settled, Mr. Allworthy withdrew to his Study, as was his Custom, and left the Child to his Sister, who, at his Desire, had undertaken the Care of it.  CHAP. V. Containing a few common Matters, with a very uncommon Observation upon them.  WHEN her Master departed, Mrs. Deborah stood silent, expecting her Cue from Miss Bridget; for as to what had past before her Master, the prudent Housekeeper by no means relied upon it, as she had often known the Sentiments of the Lady in her Brother's Absence to differ greatly from those which she had expressed in his Presence. Miss Bridget did not, however suffer her to continue long in this doubtful Situation; for having looked some time earnestly at the Child, as it lay asleep in the Lap of Mrs. Deborah, the good Lady could not forbear giving it a hearty Kiss, at the same time declaring herself wonderfully pleased with its Beauty and Innocence. Mrs. Deborah no sooner observed this, than she fell to squeezing and kissing with as great Raptures as sometimes inspire the sage Dame of forty and five toward a youthful and vigorous Bridegroom, crying out in a shrill Voice, 'O the dear little Creature, the dear, sweet, pretty Creature! well, I vow, it is as fine a Boy as ever was seen!'  These Exclamations continued 'till they were interrupted by the Lady, who now proceeded to execute the Commission given her by her Brother, and gave Orders for providing all Necessaries for the Child, appointing a very good Room in the House for his Nursery. Her Orders were indeed so liberal, that had it been a Child of her own, she could not have exceeded them; but lest the virtuous Reader may condemn her for showing too great Regard to a base-born Infant, to which all Charity is condemned by Law as irreligious, we think proper to observe, that she concluded the whole with saying, 'Since it was her Brother's Whim to adopt the little Brat, she supposed little Master must be treated with great Tenderness; for her part, she could not help thinking it was an Encouragement to Vice; but that she knew too much of the Obstinacy of Mankind to oppose any of their ridiculous Humors.'  With Reflections of this nature, she usually, as has been hinted, accompanied every Act of Compliance with her Brother's Inclinations; and surely nothing could more contribute to heighten the Merit of this Compliance, than a Declaration that she knew at the same time the Folly and Unreasonableness of those Inclinations to which she submitted. Tacit Obedience implies no Force upon the Will, and consequently may be easily, and without any Pains preserved; but when a Wife, a Child, a Relation, or a Friend, performs what we desire, with Grumbling, and Reluctance, with Expressions of Dislike and Dissatisfaction, the manifest Difficulty which they undergo, must greatly enhance the Obligation.  As this is one of those deep Observations which very few Readers can be supposed capable of making themselves, I have thought proper to lend them my Assistance; but this is a Favor rarely to be expected in the Course of my Work. Indeed I shall seldom or never so indulge him, unless in such Instances as this, where nothing but the Inspiration with which we Writers are gifted, can possibly enable any one to make the Discovery.  CHAP. VI. Mrs. Deborah is introduced into the Parish, with a Simile. A short Account of Jenny Jones, with the Difficulties and Discouragements which may attend young Women in the Pursuit of Learning.  MRS. Deborah, having disposed of the Child according to the Will of her Master, now prepared to visit those Habitations which were supposed to conceal its Mother.  Not otherwise than when a Kite, tremendous Bird, is beheld by the feathered Generation soaring aloft, and hovering over their Heads, the amorous Dove, and every innocent little Bird spread wide the Alarm, and fly trembling to their Hiding-places. He proudly beats the Air, conscious of his Dignity, and meditates intended Mischief.  So when the Approach of Mrs. Deborah was proclaimed through the Street, all the Inhabitants ran trembling into their Houses, each Matron dreading lest the Visit should fall to her Lot. She with stately Steps proudly advances over the Field, aloft she bears her towering Head, filled with Conceit of her own Pre-eminence, and Schemes to effect her intended Discovery.  The sagacious Reader will not, from this Simile, imagine these poor People had any Apprehension of the Design with which Mrs. Wilkins was now coming toward them; but as the great Beauty of the Simile may possibly sleep these hundred Years, till some future Commentator shall take this Work in hand, I think proper to lend the Reader a little Assistance in this Place.  It is my Intention therefore to signify, that as it is the Nature of a Kite to devour little Birds, so is it the Nature of such Persons as Mrs. Wilkins, to insult and tyrannize over little People. This being indeed the Means which they use to recompense to themselves their extreme Servility and Condescension to their Superiors; for nothing can be more reasonable, than that Slaves and Flatterers should exact the same Taxes on all below them, which they themselves pay to all above them.  Whenever Mrs. Deborah had had Occasion to exert any extraordinary Condescension to Mrs. Bridget, and by that means had a little sowered her natural Disposition, it was usual with her to walk forth among these People, in order to refine her Temper, by venting, and, as it were, purging off all ill Humors; on which Account, she was by no means a welcome Visitant; to say the Truth, she was universally hated and dreaded by them all.  On her Arrival in this Place, she went immediately to the Habitation of an elderly Matron; to whom, as this Matron had the good Fortune to resemble herself in the Comeliness of her Person, as well as in her Age, she had generally been more favorable than to any of the rest. To this Woman she imparted what had happened, and the Design upon which she was come thither that Morning. These two began presently to scrutinize the Characters of the several young Girls, who lived in any of those Houses, and at last fixed their strongest Suspicion on one Jenny Jones, who they both agreed was the likeliest Person to have committed this Fact.  This Jenny Jones was no very comely Girl, either in her Face or Person; but Nature had somewhat compensated the Want of Beauty with what is generally more esteemed by those Ladies, whose Judgment is arrived at Years of perfect Maturity; for she had given her a very uncommon Share of Understanding. This Gift Jenny had a good deal improved by Erudition. She had lived several Years a Servant with a Schoolmaster, who discovering a great Quickness of Parts in the Girl, and an extraordinary Desire of Learning, (for every leisure Hour she was always found reading in the Books of the Scholars) had the Goodnature, or Folly, which the Reader pleases to call it, to instruct her so far, that she obtained a very competent Skill in the Latin Language, and was perhaps as good a Scholar as most of the young Men of Quality of the Age. This Advantage, however, like most others of an extraordinary Kind, was attended with some small Inconveniences: For as it is not to be wondered at, that a young Woman so well accomplished should have lIttle Relish for the Society of those whom Fortune had made her Equals, but whom Education had rendered so much her Inferiors; so is it Matter of no greater Astonishment, that this Superiority in Jenny, together with that Behavior which is its certain Consequence, should produce among the others some little Envy and ill will toward her; and these had perhaps secretly burnt in the Bosoms of her Neighbors, ever since her Return from her Service.  Their Envy did not however display itself openly, till poor Jenny, to the Surprise of every Body, and to the Vexation of all the young Women in these Parts, had publicly shone forth on a Sunday in a new Silk Gown, with a laced Cap, and other proper Appendages to these.  The Flame, which had before lain in Embrio, now burst forth. Jenny had, by her Learning, increased her own Pride, which none of her Neighbors were kind enough to feed with the Honor she seemed to demand; and now, instead of Respect and Adoration, she gained nothing but Hatred and Abuse, by her Finery. The whole Parish declared she could not come honestly by such Things; and Parents, instead of wishing their Daughters the same, felicitated themselves that their Children had them not.  Hence perhaps it was, that the good Woman first mentioned the Name of this poor Girl to Mrs. Wilkins; but there was another Circumstance that confirmed the latter in her Suspicion: For Jenny had lately been often at Mr. Allworthy's House. She had officiated as Nurse to Miss Bridget, in a Violent Fit of Illness, and had sat up many Nights with that Lady; besides which, she had been seen there the very Day before Mr. Allworthy's Return, by Mrs. Wilkins herself, though that sagacious Person had not at first conceived any Suspicion of her on that Account: For, as she herself said, 'She had always esteemed Jenny as a very sober Girl, (though indeed she knew very little of her) and had rather suspected some of those wanton Trollops, who gave themselves Airs, because, forsooth, they thought themselves handsome.'  Jenny was now summoned to appear in Person before Mrs. Deborah, which she immediately did. When Mrs. Deborah, putting on the Gravity of a Judge, with somewhat more than his Austerity, began an Oration with the Words 'You audacious Strumpet,' in which she proceeded rather to pass Sentence on the Prisouer, than to accuse her.  Though Mrs. Deborah was fully satisfied of the Guilt of Jenny, for the Reason above shown, it is possible Mr. Allworthy might have required some stronger Evidence to have convicted her; but she saved her Accusers any such Trouble, by freely confessing the whole Fact with which she was charged.  This Confession, though delivered rather in Terms of Contrition, as it appeared, did not at all mollify Mrs. Deborah, who now pronounced a second Judgment against her, in more opprobrious Language than before; nor had it any better Success with the Bystanders, who were now grown very numerous. Many of them cried out, 'They thought what Madam's Silk Gown would end in;' others speak sarcastically of her Learning. Not a single Female was present, but found some Means of expressing her Abhorrence of poor Jenny; who bore all very patiently, except the Malice of one Woman, who reflected upon her Person, and tossing upon her Nose, said, 'The Man must have a good Stomach, who would give Silk Gowns for such Sort of Trumpery.' Jenny replied to this, with a Bitterness which might have surprised a judicious Person, who had observed the Tranquillity with which she bore all the Affronts to her Chastity; but her Patience was tired out: For this is a Virtue which is very apt to be fatigued by Exercise.  Mrs. Deborah, having succeeded beyond her hopes in her Enquiry, returned with much Triumph, and at the appointed Hour made a faithful Report to Mr. Allworthy, who was much surprised at the Relation; for he had heard of the extraordinary Parts and Improvements of this Girl, whom he intended to have given in Marriage, together with a small Living, to a neighboring Curate. His Concern therefore upon this Occasion, was at least equal to the Satisfaction which appeared in Mrs. Deborah, and to many Readers may seem much more reasonable.  Mrs. Bridget blessed herself, and said, 'For her Part, she should never hereafter entertain a good Opinion of any Woman:' For Jenny had likewise had the Happiness of being much in her good Graces.  The prudent Housekeeper was again dispatched to bring the unhappy Culprit before Mr. Allworthy, in order, not, as it was hoped by some and expected by all, to be sent to the House of Correction; but to receive wholesome Admonition and Reproof, which those who relish that kind of Instructive Writing, may peruse in the next Chapter.  CHAP. VII. Containing such grave Matter, that the Reader cannot laugh once through the whole Chapter, unless peradventure he should laugh at the Author,  WHEN Jenny appeared, Mr. Allworthy took her into his Study, and spoke to her as follows.  'You know, Child, it is in my Power, as a Magistrate, to punish you very rigorously for what you have done; and you will perhaps be the more apt to fear I should execute that Power, because you have, in a manner, laid your' Sins at my Door.  'But perhaps this is one Reason which has determined me to act in a milder Manner with you: For, as no private Resentment should ever influence a Magistrate, I will be so far from considering your having deposited the Infant in my House, as an Aggavation of your Offense, that I will suppose, in your Favor, this to have proceeded from a natural Affection to your Child; since you might have some Hopes to see it thus better provided for, than was in the Power of yourself, or its wicked Father, to provide for it. I should indeed have been highly offended with you, had you exposed the little Wretch in the manner of some inhuman Mothers, who seem no less to have abandoned their Humanity, than to have parted with their Chastity. It is the other Part of your Offense therefore upon which I intend to admonish you, I mean the Violation of your Chastity. A Crime, however lightly treated it may be by debauched Persons, very heinous in itself, and very dreadful in its' Consequences.  'The heinous Nature of this Offense must be apparent to every Christian, inasmuch as it is committed in the Defiance of the Laws of our Religion, and of the express Commands of him' who founded that Religion.  'And here its Consequences may well be argued to be dreadful; for what can be more so, than to incur the divine Displeasure, by the Breach of the Divine Commands; and that in an Instance, against which the highest Vengeance is specifically' denounced.  'But these Things, though too little, I am afraid, regarded, are so plain, that Mankind, however they may want to be reminded, can never need Information on this Head. A Hint therefore to awaken your Sense of this Matter shall suffice; for I would inspire you with Repentance,' and not drive you to Desperation.  'There are other Consequences, not indeed so dreadful or replete with Horror as this; and yet such, as if attentively considered, must, one would think, deter all, of your Sex at least, from' the Commission of this Crime.  'For by it you are rendered infamous, and driven, like Lepers of old, out of Society; at least from the Society of all but wicked and reprobate Persons; for no other will associate with you.  'If you have Fortunes, you are hereby rendered incapable of enjoying them; if you have none, you are disabled from acquiring any, nay almost of procuring your Sustenance; for no Persons of Character will receive you into their Houses. Thus you are often driven by Necessity itself into a State of Shame and Misery, which unavoidably ends in the Destruction of both Body' and Soul.  'Can any Pleasure compensate these Evils? Can any Temptation have Sophistry and Delusion strong enough to persuade you to so simple a Bargain? Or can any carnal Appetite so overpower your Reason, or so totally lay it asleep, as to prevent your flying with Affright and Terror from a Crime which carries such Punishment always' with it.  'How base and mean must that Woman be, how void of that Dignity of Mind, and decent Pride, without which we are not worthy the Name of human Creatures, who can bear to level herself with the lowest Animal, and to sacrifice all that is great and noble in her, all her Heavenly Part, to an Appetite which she has in common with the vilest Branch of the Creation! For no Woman sure, will plead the Passion of Love for an Excuse. This would be to own herself the mere Tool and Bubble of the Man. Love, however barbarously we may corrupt and pervert its meaning, as it is a laudable, is a rational Passion, and can never be violent, but when reciprocal; for though the Scripture bids us love our Enemies, it means not with that servent Love, which we naturally bear toward our Friends; much less that we should sacrifice to them our Lives, and what ought to be dearer to us, our Innocence. Now in what Light, but in that of an Enemy, can a reasonable Woman regard the Man, who solicits her to entail on herself all the Misery I have above described, and who would purchase to himself a short, trivial, contemptible Pleasure, so greatly at her Expense! For by the Laws of Custom the whole Shame, with all its dreadful Consequences, falls entirely upon her. Can Love, which always seeks the good of its Object, attempt to betray a Woman into a Bargain, where she is so greatly to be the Loser? If such Corrupter, therefore, should have the Impudence to pretend to real Affection for her, ought not the Woman to regard him, not only as an Enemy, but as the worst of all Enemies; a false, designing, treacherous, pretended Friend, who intends not only to debauch her Body, but' her Understanding at the same Time?  Here Jenny expressing great Concern, Allworthy paused a Moment, and then proceeded: I have talked thus to you, Child, not to insult you for what is past, and irrevocable, but to caution and strengthen you for the future. Nor should I have taken this Trouble, but from some Opinion of your good Sense, notwithstanding the dreadful Slip you have made; and from some Hopes of your hearty Repentance, which are founded on the Openness and Sincerity of your Confession.  If these do not deceive me, I will take care to convey you from this Scene of your Shame, where you shall, by being unknown, 'avoid the Punishment which, as I have said, is allotted to your Crime in this World, and I hope by Repentance, you will avoid the much heavier Sentence denounced against it in the other. Be a good Girl the rest of your Days, and Want shall be no Motive to your going astray: And believe me, there is more Pleasure, even in this World, in an innocent and' virtuous Life, than in one debauched and vicious.  'As to your Child, let no Thoughts concerning it, molest you; I will provide for it in a better manner than you can ever hope. And now nothing remains, but that you inform me who was the wicked Man that seduced you; for my Anger against him will be much greater than you have experienced upon this Occasion.'  Jenny now lifted her Eyes from the Ground, and with a modest Look, and decent Voice, thus began.  'To know you, Sir, and not love your Goodness, would be an Argument of total want of Sense or Goodness in any one. In me it would amount to the highest Ingratitude, not to feel, in the most sensible manner, the great Degree of Goodness you have been pleased to exert on this Occasion. As to my Concern for what is past, I know you will spare my Blushes the Repetition. My future Conduct will much better declare my Sentiments, than any Professions I can now make. I beg leave to assure you, Sir, that I take your Advice much kinder, than your generous Offer with which you concluded it. For as you are pleased to say, Sir, it is an Instance of your Opinion of my U understanding' -- Here her Tears flowing apace, she stopped a few Moments, and then proceeded thus, 'Indeed, Sir, your Kindness overcomes me; but I will endeavor to deserve this good Opinion; for if I have the Understanding you are so kindly pleased to allow me, such Advice cannot be thrown away upon me. I thank you, Sir, heartily, for your intended Kindness to my poor helpless Child; he is innocent, and I hope will live to be grateful for all the Favors you shall show him. But now, Sir, I must on my Knees entreat you, not to persist in asking me to declare the Father of my Infant. I promise you faithfully, you shall one Day know; but I am under the most solemn Ties and Engagements of Honor, as well as the most religious Vows and Protestations, to conceal his Name at this Time. And I know you too well to think you would desire I should sacrifice either my Honor or my Religion.'  Mr. Allworthy, whom the least Mention of these sacred Words was sufficient to stagger, hesitated a Moment before he replied, and then told her she had done wrong to enter into such Engagements to a Villain; but since she had, he could not insist on her breaking them. He said, it was not from a Motive of vain Curiosity he had enquired, but in order to punish the Fellow; at least, that he might not ignorantly confer Favors on the Undeserving.  As to these Points, Jenny satisfied him by the most solemn Assurances, that the Man was entirely out of his Reach, and was neither subject to his Power, nor in any probability of becoming an Object of his Goodness.  The Ingenuity of this Behavior, had gained Jenny so much Credit with this worthy Man, that he easily believed what she told him: For as she had disdained to excuse herself by a Lie, and had ^azarded his farther Displeasure in her present Situation, rather than she would forfeit her Honor, or Integrity, by betraying another, he had but little Apprehension that she would be guilty of Falsehood toward himself.  He therefore dismissed her with Assurances, that he would very soon remove her out of the Reach of that Obloquy she had incurred, concluding with some additional Documents, in which he recommended Repentance, saying, "Consider, Child, 'there is one still to reconcile yourself to, whose Favor is of much greater Importance to you than mine.'  CHAP. VIII. A Dialogue between Mesdames Bridget, and Deborah; containing more Amusement, but less Instruction than the former.  WHEN Mr. Allworthy had retired to his Study with Jenny Jones, as has been seen, Mrs. Bridget, with the good Housekeeper, had betaken themselves to a Post next adjoining to the said Study; whence, through the Conveyance of a Keyhole, they sucked in at their Ears the Instructive Lecture delivered by Mr. Allworthy, together with the Answers of Jenny, and indeed every other Particular which passed in the last Chapter.  This Hole in her Brother's Study Door, was indeed as well known to Mrs. Bridget, and had been as frequently applied to by her, as the famous Hole in the Wall was by Thisbe of old. This served to many good Purposes. For by such Means Mrs. Bridget became often acquainted with her Brothers Inclinations, without giving him the Trouble of repeating them to her. It is true, some Inconveniences attended this Intercourse, and she had sometimes Reason to cry out with Thisbe, in Shakespeare, 'O wicked, wicked Wall!' For as Mr. Allworthy was a Justice of Peace, certain Things occured in Examinations concerning the Bastards, and such like, which are apt to give great Offense to the chaste Ears of Virgins, especially when they approach the Age of forty, as was the Case of Mrs. Bridget. However, she had, on such Occasions, the Advantage of concealing her Blushes from the Eyes of Men, and De non apparentibus, et non existentibus eadem est ratio. In English: 'When a Woman is not seen to blush, she does not blush at all.'  Both the good Women kept strict Silence durring the whole Scene between Mr. Allworthy and the Girl; but as soon as it was ended, and that Gentleman was out of hearing, Mrs. Deborah could not help exclaiming against the Clemency of her Master, and especially against his suffering her to conceal the Father of the Child, which she swore she would have out of her before the Sun set.  At these words Mrs. Bridget discomposed her Features with a Smile; (a Thing very unusual to her) Not that I would have my Reader imagine, that this was one of those wanton Smiles, which Homer would have you conceive came from Venus, when he calls her the laughter-loving Goddess; nor was it one of those Smiles, which Lady Seraphina shoots from the Stage-Box, and which Venus would quit her Immortality to be able to equal. No, this was rather one of those Smiles, which might be supposed to have come from the dimpled Cheecks of the august Tysiphone, or from one of the Misses her Sisters.  With such a Smile then, and with a Voice, sweet as the Evening Breeze of Boreas in the pleasant Month of November, Mrs. Bridget gently reproved the Curiosity of Mrs. Deborah, a Vice with which it seems the latter was too much tainted, and which the former inveighed against with great Bitterness, adding, 'that among all her Faults, she thanked Heaven, her Enemies could not accuse her of prying into the Affairs of other People.'  She then proceeded to commend the Honor and Spirit with which Jenny had acted. She said, she could not help agreeing with her Brother, that there was some Merit in the Sincerity of her Confession, and in her Integrity to her Lover. That she had always thought her a very good Girl, and doubted not but she had been seduced by some Rascal, who had been infinitely more to blame than herself, and very probably had prevailed with her by a Promise of Marriage, or some other treacherous Proceeding.  This Behavior of Mrs. Bridget greatly surprised Mrs. Deborah; for this well-bred Woman seldom opened her Lips either to her Master or his Sister, 'till she had first sounded their Inclinations, with which her Sentiments were always strictly consonant. Here, however, she thought she might have launched forth with Safety; and the sagacious Reader will not perhaps accuse her of want of sufficient Forecast in so doing, but will rather admire with what wonderful Celerity she tacked about, when she found herself steering a wrong Course.  'Nay Madam,' said this able Woman, and truly great Politician, 'I must own I cannot help admiring the Girl's Spirit, as well as your Ladyship. And, as your 'Ladyship says, if she was deceived by some wicked Man, the poor Wretch is to be pitied. And to be sure, as your Ladyship says, the Girl has always appeared like a good, honest, plain Girl, and not vain of her Face, forsooth, as some wanton Husseys in' the Neighborhood are.  'You say true, Deborah, said Mrs. Bridget, if the Girl had been one of those vain Trollops, of which we have too many in the Parish, I should have condemned my Brother for his Lenity toward her. I saw two Farmers Daughters at Church, the other Day, with bare Necks. I protest they shocked me. If Wenches will hang out Lures for Fellows, it is no matter what they suffer. I detest such Creatures; and it would be much better for them, that their Faces had been seamed with the Smallpox; but I must confess, I never saw any of this wanton Behavior in poor Jenny; some artful Villain, I am convinced, has betrayed, nay perhaps forced her; and I pity the poor Wretch with all my Heart.'  Mrs. Deborah approved all these Sentiments, and the Dialogue concluded with a general and bitter Invective against Beauty, and with many compassionate Considerations for all honest, plain Girls, who are deluded by the wicked Arts of deceitful Men.  CHAP. IX. Containing Matters which will surprise the Reader.  JENNY returned home well pleased with the Reception she had met with from Mr. Allworthy, whose Indulgence to her she industrously made public; partly perhaps as a Sacrifice to her own Pride, and partly from the more prudent Motive of reconciling her Neighbors to her, and silencing their Clamours.  But though this latter View; if she indeed had it, may appear reasonable enough, yet the Event did not answer her Expectation; for when she was convened before the Justice, and it, was universally apprehended, that the House of Correction would have been her Fate; though some of the young Women cried out, 'it was good enough for her,' and diverted themselves with the Thoughts of her beating Hemp in a Silk Gown; yet there were many others who began to pity her Condition: But when it was known in what manner Mr. Allworthy had behaved, the Tide turned against her. One said, ''I'll assure you, Madam has had good Luck.' A second cried, 'See what it is to be a Favorite.' A third,' Ay, this comes of her Learning.' Every Person made some malicious Comment or other, on the Occasion; and reflected on the Partiality of the Justice.  The Behavior of these People, may appear impolitic, and ungrateful to the Reader, who considers the Power, and the Benevolence of Mr. Allworthy: But as to his Power, he never used it; and as to his Benevolence, he exerted so much, that he had thereby disobliged all his Neighbors: For it is a Secret well known to great Men, that by conferring an Obligation, they do not always procure a Friend, but are certain of creating many Enemies.  Jenny was, however, by the Care and Goodness of Mr. Allworthy, soon removed out of the Reach of Reproach; when Malice, being no longer able to vent its Rage on her, began to seek another Object of its Bitterness, and this was no less than Mr. Allworthy himself; for a Whisper soon went abroad, that he himself was the Father of the foundling Child.  This Supposition so well reconciled his Conduct to the general Opinion, that it met with universal Assent; and the Outery against his Lenity soon began to take another Turn, and was changed into an Invective against his Cruelty to the poor Girl. Very grave and good Women exclaimed against Men who begot Children and then disowned them. Nor were there wanting some, who, after the Departure of Jenny, insinuated, that she was spirited away with a Design too black to be mentioned, and who gave frequent Hints, that a legal Inquiry ought to be made into the whole Matter, and that some People should be forced to produce the Girl.  These Calumnies might have probably produced ill Consequences (at the least might have occasioned some Trouble,) to a Person of a more doubtful and suspicious Character than Mr. Allworthy was blessed with; but in his Case they had no such Effect; and, being heartily despised by him, they served only to afford an innocent Amusement to the good Gossips of the Neighborhood.  But as we cannot possibly divine what Complexion our Reader may be of, and as it will be some Time before he will hear any more of Jenny, we think proper to give him a very early Intimation, that Mr. Allworthy was, and will hereafter appear to be, absolutely innocent of any criminal Intention whatever. He had indeed committed no other than an Error in Politics, by tempering Justice with Mercy, and by refusing to gratify the good natured Disposition of the Mob, Whenever this Word occurs in our Writing, it intends Persons without Virtue, or Sense, in all Stations, and many of the highest Rank are often meant by it. with an Object for their Compassion to work on in the Person of poor Jenny, whom, in order to pity, they desired to have seen sacrificed to Ruin and Infamy by a shameful correction in Bridewel.  So far from complying with this their Inclination, by which all Hopes of Reformation would have been abolished, and even the Gate shut against her, if her own Inclinations should ever hereafter lead her to choose the Road of Virtue, Mr. Allworhty rather chose to encourage the Girl to return thither by the only possible Means; for too true I am afraid it is, that many Women have become abandoned, and have sunk to the last Degree of Vice by being unable to retrieve the first Slip. This will be, I am afraid, always the Case while they remain among their former Acquaintance; it was therefore wisely done by Mr. Allworthy, to remove Jenny to a Place where she might enjoy the Pleasure of Reputation, after having tasted the ill Consequences of losing it.  To this Place therefore, wherever it was, we will wish her a good Journey, and for the present take leave of her, and of the little Foundling her Child, having Matters of much higher Importance to communicate to the Reader.  CHAP. X. The Hospitality of Allworthy; with a short Sketch of the Characters of two Brothers, a Doctor, and a Captain, who were entertained by that Gentleman.  NEITHER Mr. Allworthy's House, nor his Heart, were shut against any Part of Mankind, but they were both more particularly open to Men of Merit. To say the Truth, this was the only House in the Kingdom where you was sure to gain a Dinner by deserving it.  Above all others, Men of Genius and Learning shared the principal Place in his Favor; and in these he had much Discernment: For though he had missed the Advantage of a learned Education, yet being blessed with vast natural Abilities, he had so well profited by a vigorous, though late Application to Letters, and by much Conversation with Men of Eminence in this Way, that he was himself a very competent Judge in most kind of Literature.  It is no Wonder that in an Age when this kind of Merit is so little in Fashion, and so slenderly provided for, that Persons possessed of it should very eagerly flock to a Place where they were sure of being received with great Complaisance; indeed where they might enjoy almost the same Advantages of a liberal Fortune as if they were entitled to it in their own Right; for Mr. Allworthy was not one of those generous Persons, who are ready most bountifully to bestow Meat, Drink, and Lodging on Men of Wit and Learning, for which they expect no other Return but Entertainment, Instruction, Flattery, and Subserviency; in a Word, that such Persons should be enrolled in the Number of Domestics, without wearing their Master's Clothes, or receiving Wages.  On the contrary, every Person in this House was perfect Master of his own Time: and as he might at his Pleasure satisfy all his Appetites within the Restrictions only of Law, Virtue and Religion; so he might, if his Health required, or his Inclination prompted him to Temperance, or even to Abstinence, absent himself from any Meals, or retire from them whenever he was so disposed, without even a Solicitation to the contrary: For indeed such Solicitations from Superiors always favor very strongly of Commands. But all here were free from such Impertinence, not only those, whose Company is in all other Places esteemed a Favor from their Equality of Fortune, but even those whose indigent Circumstances make such an eleemosynary Abode convenient to them, and who are therefore less welcome to a great Man's Table because they stand in need of it.  Among others of this Kind was Dr. Blifil, a Gentleman who had the Misfortune of losing the Advantage of great Talents by the Obstinacy of a Father, who would breed him to a Profession he disliked. In Obedience to this Obstinacy the Doctor had in his Youth been obliged to study Physic, or rather to say he studied it; for in reality Books of this Kind were almost the only ones with which he was unacquainted; and unfortunately for him, the Doctor was Master of almost every other Science but that by which he was to get his Bread; the Consequence of which was, that the Doctor at the Age of Forty had no Bread to eat.  Such a Person as this was certain to find a Welcome at Mr. Allworthy's Table, to whom Misfortunes were ever a Recommendation, when they were derived from the Folly or Villainy of others, and not of the unfortunate Person himself. Besides this negative Merit, the Doctor had one positive Recommendation. This was a great Appearance of Religion. Whether his Religion was real, or consisted only in Appearance, I shall not presume to say, as I am not possessed of any Touchstone, which can distinguish the true from the false.  If this Part of his Character pleased Mr. Allworthy, it delighted Miss Bridget. She engaged him in many religious Controversies; on which Occasions she constantly expressed great Satisfaction in the Doctor's Knowledge, and not much less in the Compliments which he frequently bestowed on her own. To say the Truth, she had read much English Divinity, and had puzzled more than one of the Neighboring Curates. Indeed her Conversation was so pure, her Looks so sage, and her whole Deportment so grave and solemn, that she seemed to deserve the Name of Saint equally with her Namesake, or with any other Female in the Roman Calendar.  As Sympathies of all Kinds are apt to beget Love, so Experience teaches us that none have a more direct Tendency this Way than those of a religious Kind between Persons of different Sexes. The Doctor found himself so agreeable to Miss Bridget, that he now began to lament an unfortunate Accident which had happened to him aboutten Years before; namely, his Marriage with another Woman, who was not only still alive, but what was worse, known to be so by Mr. Allworthy. This was a fatal Bar to that Happiness which he otherwise saw sufficient Probability of obtaining with this young Lady; for as to criminal Indulgences, he certainly never thought of them. This was owing either to his Religion, as is most probable, or to the Purity of his Passion, which was fixed on those Things, which Matrimony only, and not criminal Correspondence, could put him in Possession of, or could give him any Title to.  He had not long ruminated on these Matters before it recurred to his Memory that he had a Brother who was under no such unhappy Incapacity. This Brother he made no doubt would succeed; for he discerned, as he thought, an Inclination to Marriage in the Lady; and the Reader perhaps, when he hears the Brother's Qualifications, will not blame the Confidence which he entertained of his Success.  This Gentleman was about 35 Years of Age. He was of a middle Size, and what is called well built. He had a Scar on his Forehead, which did not so much injure his Beauty, as it denoted his Valor (for he was a half-pay Officer.) He had good Teeth, and something affable, when he pleased, in his Smile; though naturally his Countenance, as well as his Air and Voice, had much of Roughness in it, yet he could at any Time deposite this, and appear all Gentleness and good Humor. He was not ungenteel, nor entirely void of Wit, and in his Youth had abounded in Spriteliness, which, though he had lately put on a more serious Character, he could, when he pleased, resume.  He had, as well as the Doctor, an Academic Education; for his Father had, with the same Paternal Authority we have mentioned before, decreed him for holy Orders; but as the old Gentleman died before he was ordained, he chose the Church Military, and preferred the King's Commission to the Bishop's.  He had purchased the Post of Lieutenant of Dragoons, and afterward came to be a Captain; but having quarrelled with his Colonel, was by his Interest obliged to sell; from which Time he had entirely rusticated himself, had betaken himself to studying the Scriptures, and was not a little suspected of an Inclination to Methodism.  It seemed therefore not unlikely that such a Person should succeed with a Lady of so Saint-like a Disposition, and whose Inclinations were no otherwise engaged than to the married State in general; but why the Doctor, who certainly had no great Friendship for his Brother, should for his Sake think of making so ill a Return to the Hospitality of Allworthy, is a Matter not so easy to be accounted for.  Is it that some Natures delight in Evil, as others are thought to delight in Virtue? Or is there a Pleasure in being accessory to a Theft when we cannot commit it ourselves? Or Lastly, (which Experience seems to make probably) have we a satisfaction in aggrandizing our Families, even though we have not the least Love or Respect for them?  Whether any of these Motives operated on the Doctor we will not determine; but so the Fact was. He sent for his Brother, and easily found Means to introduce him at Allworthy's as a Person who intended only a short Visit to himself.  The Captain had not been in the House a Week before the Doctor had Reason to felicitate himself on his Discernment. The Captain was indeed as great a Master of the Art of Love as Ovid was formerly. He had besides received proper Hints from his Brother, which he failed not to improve to the best Advantage.  CHAP. XI. Containing many Rules, and some Examples, concerning falling in love: Descriptions of Beauty, and other more prudential Inducements to Matrimony.  IT has been observed by wise Men or Women, I forget which, that all Persons are doomed to be in Love once in their Lives. No particular Season is, as I remember, assigned for this; but the Age at which Miss Bridget was arrived seems to me as proper a Period as any to be fixed on for this Purpose: It often indeed happens much earlier; but when it does not, I have observed, it seldom or never fails about this Time. Moreover, we may remark that at this Season Love is of a more serious and steady Nature than what some times shows itself in the younger Parts of Life. The Love of Girls is uncertain, capricious, and so foolish that we cannot always discover what the young Lady would be at; nay, it may almost be doubted, whether she always knows this herself.  Now we are never at a Loss to discern this in Women about Forty; for as such grave, serious and experienced Ladies well know their own Meaning, so it is always very easy for a Man of the least Sagacity to discover this with the utmost Certainty.  Miss Bridget is an Example of all these Observations. She had not been many Times in the Captain's Company before she was seized with this Passion. Nor did she go pining and moping about the House, like a puny foolish Girl, ignorant of her Distemper: She felt, she knew, and she enjoyed, the pleasing Sensation, of which, as she was certain it was not only innocent but laudable, she was neither afraid nor ashamed.  And to say the Truth, there is in all Points, great Difference between the reasonable Passion which Women at this Age conceive toward Men, and the idle and childish Liking of a Girl to a Boy, which is often fixed on the Outside only, and on Things of little Value and no Duration; as on Cherry Cheeks, small Lily-white Hands, slow-black Eyes, flowing Locks, downy Chins, dapper Shapes, nay sometimes on Charms more worthless than these, and less the Party's own; such are the outward Ornaments of the Person, and for which Men are beholden to the Tailor, the Laceman, the Perriwigmaker, the Hatter, and the Milliner, and not to Nature. Such a Passion Girls may well be ashamed, as they generally are, to own either to themselves or to others.  The Love of Miss Bridget was of another Kind. The Captain owed nothing to any of these Fopmakers in his Dress, nor was his Person much more beholden to Nature. Both his Dress and Person were such as, had they appeared in an Assembly, or a Drawing Room, would have been the Contempt and Ridicule of all the fine Ladies there. The former of these was indeed neat, but plain, coarse, ill-fancied, and out of Fashion. As for the latter, we have expressly described it above. So far was the Skin on his Cheeks from being Cherry-coloured, that you could not discern what the natural Color of his Cheeks was, they being totally overgrown by a black Beard, which ascended to his Eyes. His Shape and Limbs were indeed exactly proportioned, but so large, that they denoted the Strength rather of a Ploughman than any other. His Shoulders were broad, beyond all Size, and the Calves of his Legs larger than those of a common Chairman. In short, his whole Person wanted all that Elegance and Beauty, which is the very reverse of clumsy Strength, and which so agreeably sets off most of our fine Gentlemen; being partly owing to the high Blood of their Ancestors, viz. Blood made of rich Sauces and generous Wines, and partly to an early Town Education.  Though Miss Bridget was a Woman of the greatest Delicacy of Taste; yet such were the Charms of the Captain's Conversation, that she totally overlooked the Defects of his Person. She imagined, and perhaps very wisely, that she should enjoy more agreeable Minutes with the Captain, than with a much prettier Fellow; and forewent the Consideration of pleasing her Eyes, in order to procure herself much more solid Satisfaction.  The Captain no sooner perceived the Passion of Miss Bridget, in which Discovery he was very quick-sighted, than he faithfully returned it. The Lady, no more than her Lover, was remarkable for Beauty. I would attempt to draw her Picture; but this is done already by a more able Master, Mr. Hogarth himself, to whom she sat many Years ago, and had been lately exhibited by that Gentleman in his Print of a Winter's Morning, of which she was no improper Emblem, and may be seen walking (for walk she does in the Print) to Covent Garden Church, with a starved Footboy behind carrying her Prayer Book.  The Captain likewise very wisely preferred the more solid Enjoyments he expected with this Lady, to the fleeting Charms of Person. He was one of those wise Men, who regard Beauty in the other Sex as a very worthless and superficial Qualification; or, to speak more truly, who rather choose to possess every Convenience of Life with an ugly Woman, than a handsome one without any of those Conveniences. And having a very good Appitite, and but little Nicety, he fancied he should play his Part very well at the matrimonial Banquet, without the Sauce of Beauty.  To deal plainly with the Reader, the Captain, ever since his Arrival, at least from the Moment his Brother had proposed the Match to him, long before he had discovered any flattering Symptoms in Miss Bridget, had been greatly enamoured; that is to say, of Mr. Allworthy's House and Gardens, and of his Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments; of all which the Captain was so passionately fond, that he would most probably have contracted Marriage with them, had he been obliged to have taken the Witch of Endor into the Bargain.  As Mr. Allworthy therefore had declared to the Doctor, that he never intended to take a second Wife, as his Sister was his nearest Relation, and as the Docter had fished out that his Intentions were to make any Child of hers his Heir, which indeed the Law, without his Interposition, would have done for him; the Doctor and his Brother thought it an Act of Benevolence to give Being to a human Creature, who would be so plentifully provided with the most essential Means of Happiness. The whole Thoughts therefore of both the Brothers, were how to engage the Affections of this amiable Lady.  But Fortune, who is a tender Parent, and often does more for her favorite Offspring than either they deserve or wish, had been so industrious for the Captain, that whilst he was laying Schemes to excute his Purpose, the Lady conceived the same Desires with himself, and was on her Side contriving how to give the Captain proper Encouragement, without appearing too forward; for she was a strict Observer of all Rules of Decorum. In this, however, she easily succeeded; for as the Captain was always on the Look-out, no Glance, Gesture, or Word; escaped him.  The Satisfaction which the Captain received from the kind Behavior of Miss Bridget, was not a little abated by his Apprehensions of Mr. Allworthy; for, notwithstanding his disinterested Professions, the Captain imagined he would, when he came to act, follow the Example of the rest of the World, and refuse his Consent to a Match, so disadvantageous in point of Interest, to his Sister. From what Oracle he received this Opinion, I shall leave the Reader to determine; but, however he came by it, it strangely perplexed him how to regulate his Conduct so, as at once to convey his Affection to the Lady, and to conceal it from her Brother. He, at length, resolved to take all private Opportunities of making his Addresses; but in the Presence of Mr. Allworthy to be as reserved, and as much upon his Guard as was possible; and this Conduct was highly approved by the Brother.  He soon found Means to make his Addresses, in express Terms, to his Mistress, from whom he received an Answer in the proper Form; viz. The Answer which was first made some thousands of Years ago, and which has been handed down by Tradition from Mother to Daughter ever since. If I was to translate this into Latin, I should render it by these two Words, Nolo Episcopari; a Phrase likewise of immemorial Use on another Occasion.  The Captain, however he came by his Knowledge, perfectly well understood the Lady; and very soon after repeated his Application with more Warmth and Earnestness than before, and was again, according to due Form, rejected; but as he had increased in the Eagerness of his Desires, so the Lady, with the same Propriety, decreased in the Violence of her Refusal.  Not to tire the Reader, by leading him through every Scene of this Courtship, (which, though in the Opinion of a certain great Author, it is the pleasantest Scene of Life to the Actor, is perhaps as dull and tiresome as any whatever to the Audience) the Captain made his Advances in Form, the Citadel was defended in Form, and at length, in proper Form, surrendered at Discretion.  During this whole Time, which filled the Space of near a Month, the Captain preserved great Distance of Behavior to his Lady, in the Presence of the Brother, and the more he succeeded with her in private, the more reserved was he in public. And as for the Lady, she had no sooner secured her Lover, than she behaved to him before Company with the highest Degree of Indifference; so that Mr. Allworthy must have had the Insight of the Devil (or perhaps some of his worse Qualities) to have entertained the least Suspicion of what was going forward.  CHAP. XII. Containing what the Reader may perhaps expect to find in it.  IN all Bargains, whether to fight, or to Marry, or concerning any other such Business, little previous Ceremony is required, to bring the Matter to an Issue, when both Parties are really in earnest. This was the Case at present, and in less than a Month the Captain and his Lady were Man and Wife.  The great Concern now was to break the Matter to Mr. Allworthy; and this was undertaken by the Doctor.  One Day then as Allworthy was walking in his Garden, the Doctor came to him, and with great Gravity of Aspect, and all the Concern which he could possibly affect in his Countenance, said, 'I am come, Sir, to impart an Affair to you of the utmost Consequence; but how shall I mention to you, what almost distracts me to think of!' He then launched forth into the most bitter Invectives both against Men and Women; accusing the former of having no Attachment but to their Interest, and the latter of being so addicted to vicious Inclinations, that they could never be safely trusted with one of the other Sex. 'Could I, said he, Sir, have suspected, that a Lady of such Prudence, such Judgment, such Learning, should indulge so indiscreet a Passion; or could I have imagined that my Brother -- why do I call him so? He is no longer a Brother of mine. -- '  'Indeed but he is, said Allworthy, and a Brother of mine too.' -- Bless me, Sir, said the Doctor, do you know the shocking Affair? -- Look'ee, Mr. Blifil, answered the good Man, it has been my constant Maxim in Life, to make the best of all Matters which happen. My Sister, though many Years younger than me, is at least old enough to be at the Age of Discretion. Had he imposed on a Child, I should have been more averse to have forgiven him; but a Woman upwards of thirty must certainly be supposed to know what will make her most happy. She has married a Gentleman, though perhaps not quite her Equal in Fortune; and if he has any Perfections in her Eye, which can make up that Deficiency, I see no Reason why I should object to her Choice of her own Happiness; which I, no more than herself, imagine to consist only in immense Wealth. I might, perhaps, from the many Declarations I have made, of complying with almost any Proposal, have expected to have been consulted on this Occasion; but these Matters are of a very delicate Nature, and the Scruples of Modesty perhaps are not to be overcome. As to your Brother, I have really no Anger against him at all. He has no Obligations to me, nor do I think he was under any Necessity of asking my Consent, since the Woman is, as I have said, Sui Juris, and of a proper Age to be entirely answerable only to herself for her Conduct.'  The Doctor repeated his Accusations against his Brother, accused Mr. Allworthy of too great Lenity and declared that he should never more be brought either to see, or to own him for his Relation. He then launched forth into a Panegyric on Allworthy's Goodness, into the highest Encomiums on his Friendship; and concluded, by saying, he should never forgive his Brother for having put the Place which he bore in that Friendship, to a hazard.  Allworthy thus answered: 'Had I conceived any Displeasure against your Brother, I should never have carried that Resentment to the Innocent: But, I assure you, I have no such Displeasure. Your Brother appears to me to be a Man of Sense and Honor. I do not disapprove the Taste of my Sister; nor will I doubt but that she is equally the Object of his Inclinations. I have always thought Love the only Foundation of Happiness in a married State; as it can only produce that high and tender Friendship, which should always be the Cement of this Union; and, in my Opinion, all those Marriages which are contracted from other Motives, are greatly criminal; they are a Profanation of a most holy Ceremony, and generally end in Disquiet and Misery: For surely we may call it a Profanation, to convert this most sacred Institution into a wicked sacrifice to Lust, or Avarice: And what better can be said of those Matches to which Men are induced merely by the Consideration of a' beautiful Person, or a great Fortune!  'To deny that Beauty is an agreeable Object to the Eye, and even worthy some Admiration, would be false and foolish. Beautiful is an Epithet often used in Scripture, and always mentioned with Honor. It was my own Fortune to marry a Woman, whom the World thought handsome, and I can truly say, I liked her the better on that Account. But, to make this the sole Consideration of Marriage, to lust after it so violently, as to overlook all Imperfections for its Sake, or to require it so absolutely as to reject and disdain Religion, Virtue, and Sense, which are Qualities, in their Nature, of much higher Perfection, because an Elegance of Person only is wanting; this is surely inconsistent either with a wise Man, or a good Christian. And it is, perhaps, being too charitable to conclude that such Persons mean any thing more by their Marriage, than to please their carnal Appetites, for the Satisfaction' of which we are taught it was not ordained.  'In the next Place, with respect to Fortune. Worldly Prudence perhaps exacts some Consideration on this Head; nor will I absolutely and altogether condemn it. As the World is constituted, the Demands of a married State, and the Care of Posterity, require some little Regard to what we call Circumstances. Yet this Provision is greatly increased beyond what is really necessary, by Folly and Vanity, which create abundantly more Wants than Nature. Equipage for the Wife, and large Fortunes for the Children, are by Custom enrolled in the List of Necessaries; and, to procure these, every thing truly solid and sweet, and virtuous, and religious,' are neglected and overlooked.  'And this in many Degrees; the last and greatest of which seems scarce distinguishable from Madness. I mean, where Persons of immense Fortunes contract themselves to those who are, and must be, disagreeable to them; to Fools and Knaves, in order to increase an Estate, already larger even than the Demands of their Pleasures. Surely such Persons, if they will not be thought mad, must own, either that they are incapable of tasting the sweets of the tenderest Friendship, or that they sacrifice the greatest Happiness of which they are capable to the vain, uncertain, and senseless Laws of vulgar Opinion, which owe as well their Force, as their Foundation, to Folly.'  Here Allworthy concluded his Sermon, to which Blifil had listened with the profoundest Attention, though it cost him some pains to prevent now and then a small Discomposure of his Muscles. He now praised every Period of what he had heard, with the warmth of a young Divine who has the Honor to dine with a Bishop the same Day in which his Lordship had mounted the Pulpit.  CHAP. XIII. Which concludes the first Book, with an Instance of Ingratitude, which we hope will appear unnatural.  THE Reader, from what has been said, may imagine that the Reconciliation (if indeed it could be so called) was only Matter of Form; we shall therefore pass it over, and hasten to what must surely be thought Matter of Substance.  The Doctor had acquainted his Brother with what had past between Mr. Allworthy and him; and added with a Smile. 'I promise you, I paid you off; nay, I absolutely desired the good Gentleman not to forgive you: For you know, after he had made a Declaration in your Favor, I might, with Safety, venture on such a Request with a Person of his Temper; and I was willing, as well for your Sake as for my own, to prevent the least Possibility of a Suspicion.'  Captain Blifil took not the least Notice of this, at that Time; but he afterward made a very notable Use of it.  One of the Maxims which the Devil, in a late Visit upon Earth, left to his Disciples, is, when once you are got up, to kick the Stool from under you. In plain English, when you have made your Fortune by the good Offices of a Friend, you are advised to discard him as soon you can.  Whether the Captain acted by this Maxim, I will not positively determine; so far we may confidently say, that his Actions may be fairly derived from this diabolical Principle; and indeed it is difficult to assign any other Motive to them: For no sooner was he possessed of Miss Bridget, and reconciled to Allworthy, than he began to show a Coldness to his Brother, which increased daily; till at length it grew into Rudeness, and became visible to every one.  The Doctor remonstrated to him privately concerning this Behavior, but could obtain no other Satisfaction than the following plain Declaration: 'If you dislike any thing in my Brother's House, Sir, you know you are at Liberty to quit it.' This strange, cruel, and almost unaccountable Ingratitude in the Captain, absolutely broke the poor Doctor's Heart: For Ingratitude never so thoroughly pierces the human Breast, as when it proceeds from those in whose Behalf we have been guilty of Transgressions. Reflections on great and good Actions, however they are received or returned by those in whose Favor they are performed, always administer some Comfort to us; but what Consolation shall we receive under so biting a Calamity as the ungrateful Behavior of our Friend, when our wounded Conscience at the same Time flies in our Face, and upbraids us with having spotted it in the Service of one so worthless?  Mr. Allworthy himself spoke to the Captain in his Brother's Behalf, and desired to know what Offense the Doctor had committed; when the hard-hearted Villain had the Beseness to say, that he never should forgive him for the Injury which he had endeavored to do him in his Favor; which, he said, he had pumped out of him, and was such a cruelty, that it ought not to be forgiven.  Allworthy spoke in very high Terms upon this Declaration, which, he said, became not a human Creature. He expressed, indeed, so much Resentment against an unforgiving Temper, that the Captain at last pretended to be convinced by his Arguments, and outwardly professed to be reconciled.  As for the Bride, she was now in her Honeymoon, and so passionately fond of her new Husband, that he never appeared, to her, to be in the wrong; and his Displeasure against any Person, was a sufficient Reason for her Dislike to the same.  The Captain, at Mr. Allworthy's Instance, was outwardly, as we have said, reconciled to his Brother, yet the same Rancour remained in his Heart; and he found so many Opportunities of giving him private Hints of this, that the House at last grew insupportable to the poor Doctor; and he chose rather to submit to any Inconveniences which he might encounter in the World, than longer to bear these cruel and ungrateful Insults, from a Brother for whom he had done so much.  He once intended to acquaint Allworthy with the whole; but he could not bring himself to submit to the Confession, by which he must take to his Share so great a Portion of Guilt. Besides, by how much the worse Man he represented his Brother to be, so much the greater would his own Offense appear to Mr. Allworthy, and so much the greater, had he Reason to imagine, would be his Resentment.  He feigned, therefore, some Excuse of Business for his Departure, and promised to return soon again; and took leave of his Brother with so welldissembled Content, that, as the Captain played his Part to the same Perfection, Allworthy remained well satisfied with the Truth of the Reconciliation.  The Doctor went directly to London, where he died soon of a broken Heart; a Distemper which kills more than is generally imagined, and would have a fair Title to a Place in the Bill of Mortality, did it not differ in one Instance from all other Diseases, viz. That no Physician can cure it.  Now, upon the most diligent Enquiry into the former Lives of these two Brothers, I find, besides the cursed and hellish Maxim of Policy abovementioned, another Reason for the Captain's Conduct: The Captain, besides what we have before said of him, was a Man of great Pride and Fierceness, and had always treated his Brother, who was of a different Complexion, and greatly deficient in both these Qualities, with the utmost Air of Superiority. The Doctor, however, had much the larger Share of Learning, and was by many reputed to have the better Understanding. This the Captain knew, and could not bear. For, though Envy is at best a very malignant Passion, yet is its Bitterness greatly heightened by mixing with Contempt toward the same Object; and very much afraid I am, that whenever an Obligation is joined to these two, Indignation, and not Gratitude, will be the Product of all three.  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING. BOOK II. Containing Scenes of matrimonial Felicity in different Degrees of Life; and various other Transactions during the first two Years after the Marriage between Captain Blifil, and Miss Bridget Allworthy.  CHAP I. Showing what Kind of a History this is; what it is like, and what it is not like.  THOUGH we have properly enough entitled this our Work, a History, and not a Life; nor an Apology for a Life, as is more in Fashion; yet we intend in it rather to pursue the Method of those Writers who profess to disclose the Revolutions of Countries, than to imitate the painful and voluminous Historian, who to preserve the Regularity of his Series thinks himself obliged to fill up as much Paper with the Detail of Months and Years in which nothing remarkable happened, as he employs upon those Aeras when the greatest Scenes have been transacted on the human Stage.  Such Histories as these do, in reality, very much resemble a News-Paper, which consists of just the same Number of Words, whether there be any News in it or not. They may likewise be compared to a Stage Coach, which performs constantly the same Course, empty as well as full. The Writer, indeed, seems to think himself obliged to keep even Pace with Time, whose Amanuensis he is; and, like his Master, travels as slowly through Centuries of monkish Dullness, when the World seems to have been asleep, as through that bright and busy Age so nobly distinguished by the excellent Latin Poet.  "Ad confligendum venientibus undique paenis; "Omnia cum belli trepido concussa tumultu "Horrida contremuere sub altis aetheris auris: "In dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum "Omnibus humanis esset, terraque marique." Of which, we wish we could give our Reader a more adequate Translation than that by Mr. Creech.  "When dreadful Carthage frighted Rome with Arms, "And all the World was shook with fierce Alarms; "Whilst undecided yet, which Part should fall, "Which Nation rise the glorious Lord of all. Now it is our purpose in the ensuing Pages, to pursue a contrary Method. When any extraordinary Scene presents itself (as we trust will often be the Case) we shall spare no Pains nor Paper to open it at large to our Reader; but if whole Years should pass without producing any thing worthy his Notice, we shall not be afraid of a Chasm in our History; but shall hasten on to Matters of Consequence, and leave such Periods of Time totally unobserved.  These are indeed to be considered as Blanks in the grand Lottery of Time. We therefore who are the Registers of that Lottery, shall imitate those sagacious Persons who deal in that which is drawn at Guild Hall, and who never trouble the Public with the many Blanks they dispose of; but when a great Prize happens to be drawn, the Newspapers are presently filled with it, and the World is sure to be informed at whose Office it was sold: Indeed commonly two or three different Offices lay claim to the Honor of having disposed of it; by which I suppose the Adventurers are given to understand that certain Brokers are in the Secrets of Fortune, and indeed of her Cabinet-Council.  My Reader then is not to be surprised, if in the Course of this Work, he shall find some Chapters very short, and others altogether as long; some that contain only the Time of a single Day, and others that comprise Years; in a word, if my History sometimes seems to stand still, and sometimes to fly. For all which I shall not look on myself as accountable to any Court of Critical Jurisdiction whatever: For as I am, in reality, the Founder of a new Province of Writing, so I am at liberty to make what Laws I please therein. And these Laws, my Readers, whom I consider as my Subjects, are bound to believe in and to obey; with which that they may readily and cheerfully comply, I do hereby assure them that I shall principally regard their Ease and Advantage in all such Institutions: For I do not, like a jure divino Tyrant, imagine that they are my Slaves or my Commodity. I am, indeed, set over them for their own Good only, and was created for their Use, and not they for mine. Nor do I doubt, while I make their Interest the great Rule of my Writings, they will unanimously concur in supporting my Dignity, and in rendering me all the Honor I shall deserve or desire.  CHAP. II. Religious Cautions against showing too much Favor to Bastards; and a great Discovery made by Mrs. Deborah Wilkins.  EIGHT Months after the Celebration of the Nuptials between Captain Blifil and Miss Bridget Allworthy, a young Lady of great Beauty, Merit, and Fortune, was Miss Bridget, by reason of a Fright, delivered of a fine Boy. The Child, was indeed, to all Appearance, perfect; but the Midwife discovered, it was born a Month before its full Time.  Though the Birth of an Heir of his beloved Sister was a Circumstance of great Joy to Mr. Allworthy, yet it did not alienate his Affections from the little Foundling, to whom he had been Godfather, had given his own Name of Thomas, and whom he had hitherto seldom failed of visiting at least once a Day, in his Nursery.  He told his Sister, if she pleased, the newborn Infant should be bred up together with little Tommy, to which she consented, though with some little Reluctance: For she had truly a great Complaisance for her Brother; and hence she had always behaved toward the Foundling with rather more Kindness than Ladies of rigid Virtue can sometimes bring themselves to show to these Children, who, however, innocent, may be truly called the living Monuments of Incontinence.  The Captain could not so easily bring himself to bear what he condemned as a Fault in Mr. Allworthy. He gave him frequent Hints, that to adopt the Fruits of Sin, was to give countenance to it. He quoted several Texts (for he was well read in Scripture) such as, He visits the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children; and, the Fathers have eaten sour Grapes, and the Children's Teeth are set on edge, etc. Whence he argued the Legality of punishing the Crime of the Parent on the Bastard. He said, 'Tho' the Law did not positively allow the destroying such base-born Children, yet it held them to be the Children of no body; that the Church considered them as the Children of no body; and that at the best, they ought to be brought up to the lowest and vilest Offices of the Commonwealth.'  Mr. Allworthy answered to all this and much more which the Captain had urged on this Subject, 'That however guilty the Parents might be, the Children were certainly innocent. That as to the Texts he had quoted, the former of them was a particular denunciation against the Jews for the Sin of Idolatry, of relinquishing and hating their heavenly King; and the latter was parabolically spoken, and rather intended to denote the certain and necessary Consequences of Sin, than any express Judgment against it. But to represent the Almighty as avenging the Sins of the Guilty on the Innocent, was indecent, if not blasphemous, as it was to represent him acting against the first Principles of natural Justice, and against the original Notions of Right and Wrong, which he himself had implanted in our Minds; by which we were to judge not only in all Matters which were not revealed, but even of the Truth of Revelation itself. He said, he knew many held the same Principles with the Captain on this Head; but he was himself firmly convinced to the contrary, and would provide in the same Manner for this poor Infant, as if a legitimate Child had had the Fortune to have been found in the same Place.'  While the Captain was taking all Opportunities to press these and such like Arguments to remove the little Foundling from Mr. Allworthy's, of whose Fondness for him he began to be jealous, Mrs. Deborah had made a Discovery, which in its Event threatened at least to prove more fatal to poor Tommy, than all the Reasonings of the Captain.  Whether the insatiable Curiosity of this good Woman had carried her on to that Business, or, whether she did it to confirm herself in the good Graces of Mrs. Blifil, who, notwithstanding he outward Behavior to the Foundling, frequently abused the Infant in private, and her Brother too for his Fondness to it, I will not determine; but she had now, as she conceived, fully detected the Father of the Foundling.  Now as this was a Discovery of great Consequence, it may be necessary to trace it from the Fountainhead. We shall therefore very minutel^ lay open those previous Matters by which it was produced; and for that Purpose, we shall be obliged to reveal all the Secrets of a little Family, with which my Reader is at present entirely unacquainted and of which the Economy was so rare and extraordinary, that I fear it will shock the utmost Credulity of many married Persons.  CHAP. III. The Description of a domestic Government founder upon Rules directly contrary to those of Aristotle  MY Reader may please to remember he has been informed that Jenny Jones had live some Years with a certain Schoolmaster, who had, at her earnest Desire, instructed her in Latin, in which, to do justice to her Genius, she had so improved herself, that she was become a better Scholar than her Master.  Indeed, though this poor Man had undertaken a Profession to which Learning must be allowed necessary, this was the least of his Commendations. He was one of the best-natured Fellows in the World, and was at the same time Master of so much Pleasantry and Humor that he was reputed the Wit of the Country; and all the neighboring Gentlemen were so desirous of his Company, that as denying was not his Talent, he spent much Time at their Houses, which he might with more Emolument have spent in his School.  It may be imagined, that a Gentleman so qualified, and so disposed, was in no danger of becoming formidable to the learned Seminaries of Eton or Westminster. To speak plainly, his Scholars were divided into two Classes. In the upper of which was a young Gentleman, the Son of a neighboring 'Squire, who at the Age of Seventeen was just entered into his Syntaxis; and in the lower was a second Son of the same Gentleman, who, together with several Parish-boys, was learning to read and write.  The Stipend arising hence would hardly have indulged the Schoolmaster in the Luxuries of Life, had he not added to this Office those of Clerk and Barber, and had not Mr. Allworthy added to the whole an Annuity of Ten Pound, which the poor Man received every Christmas, and with which he was enabled to cheer his Heart during that sacred Festival.  Among his other Treasures, the Pedagogue had a Wife whom he had married out of Mr. Allworthy's Kitchen, for her Fortune, viz. Twenty Pound, which she had there amassed.  This Woman was not very amiable in her Person. Whether she sat to my Friend Hogarth, or no, I will not determine; but she exactly resembled the young Woman who is pouring out her Mistress's Tea in the third Picture of the Harlot's Progress. She was besides a professed Follower of that notable Sect founded by Xantippe of old; by means of which, she became more formidable in the School than her Husband; for to confess the Truth, he was never Master there, or any where else, in her Presence.  Though her Countenance did not denote much natural Sweetness of Temper, yet this was perhaps somewhat soured by a Circumstance which generally poisons matrimonial Felicity. For Children are rightly called the Pledges of Love; and her Husband, though they had been married nine Years, had given her no such Pledges; a Default for which he had no Excuse, either from Age or Health, being not yet thirty Years old, and, what they call a jolly, brisk, young Man.  Hence arose another Evil which produced no little Uneasiness to the poor Pedagogue, of whom she maintained so constant a Jealousy, that he durst hardly speak to one Woman in the Parish; for the least Degree of Civility, or even Correspondence with any Female, was sure to bring his Wife upon her Back, and his own.  In order to guard herself against matrimonial Injuries in her own House, as she kept one Maid Servant, she always took Care to choose her out of that Order of Females, whose Faces are taken as a Kind of Security for their Virtue; of which Number Jenny Jones, as the Reader has been before informed, was one.  As the Face of this young Woman might be called pretty good Security of the beforementioned Kind, and as her Behavior had been always extremely modest; which is the certain Consequence of Understanding in Woman; she had passed above four Years at Mr. Partridge's, (for that was the Schoolmaster's Name) without creating the least Suspicion in her Mistress. Nay, she had been treated with uncommon Kindness, and her Mistress had permitted Mr. Partridge to give her those Instructions, which have been before commemorated.  But it is with Jealousy, as with the Gout. When such Distempers are in the Blood, there is never any Security against their breaking out; and that often on the slightest Occasions, and when least suspected.  Thus it happened to Mrs. Partridge, who had submitted four Years to her Husband's teaching this young Woman, and had suffered her often to neglect her Work, in order to pursue her Learning. For passing by one Day, as the Girl, was reading, and her Master leaning over her, the Girl, I know not for what Reason, suddenly started up from her Chair; and this was the first Time that Suspicion ever entered into the Head of her Mistress.  This did not, however, at that Time, discover itself, but lay lurking in her Mind, like a concealed Enemy, who waits for a Reinforcement of additional Strength, before he openly declares himself, and proceeds upon hostile Operations; and such additional Stength soon arrived to corroborate her Suspicion: For not long after, the Husband and Wife being at Dinner, the Master said to his Maid, Da mihi aliquid Potum; upon which the poor Girl smiled, perhaps at the Badness of the Latin, and when her Mistress cast her Eyes on her, blushed, possibly with a Consciousness of having laughed at her Master. Mrs. Partridge, upon this, immediately fell into a Fury, and discharged the Trencher on which she was eating, at the Head of poor Jenny, crying out, 'You impudent Whore, do you play Tricks with my Husband before my Face?' and, at the same Instant, rose from her Chair, with a Knife in her Hand, with which, most probably, she would have executed very tragical Vengeance, had not the Girl taken the Advantage of being nearer the Door than her Mistress, and avoided her Fury, by running away; for, as to the poor Husband whether Surprise had rendered him motionless, or Fear (which is full as probable) had restrained him from venturing at any Opposition, he sat staring and trembling in his Chair; nor did he once offer to move or speak, till his Wife returning from the Pursuit of Jenny, made some defensive Measures necessary for his own Preservation; and he likewise was obliged to retreat, after the Example of the Maid.  This good Woman was, no more than Othello, of a Disposition,  -- To make a Life of Jealousy, And follow still the Changes of the Moon With fresh Suspicions -- with her, as well as him;  -- To be once in doubt Was once to be resolved -- she therefore ordered Jenny immediately to pack up her Alls, and be gone; for that she was determined she should not sleep that Night within her Walls.  Mr. Partridge had profited too much, by Experience, to interpose in a Matter of this Nature. He therefore had Recourse to his usual Recipe of Patience; for, though he was not a great Adept in Latin, he remembered and well understood the Advice contained in these Words:  -- Leve fit, quod been fertur Onus. In English: 'A Burden becomes lightest, when it is well borne.'  Which he had always in his Mouth, and of which, to say the Truth, he had often Occasion to experience the Truth.  Jenny offered to make Protestations of her Innocence; but the Tempest was too high for her to be heard. She betook herself to the Business of Packing, for which a small Quantity of brown Paper sufficed; and, having received her small Pittance of Wages, she returned home.  The Schoolmaster and his Consort passed their Time unpleasantly enough that Evening; but something or other happened before the next Morning, which a little abated the Fury of Mrs. Partridge; and she at length admitted her Husband to make his Excuse. To which she gave the readier Belief, as he had, instead of desiring her to recall Jenny, professed a Satisfaction in her being dismissed, saying, She was grown of little Use as a Servant, spending all her time in reading, and was become, moreover, very pert and obstinate: For indeed she and her Master had lately had frequent Disputes in Literature; in which, as has been said, she was become greatly his Superior. This, however, he would by no means allow; and, as he called her persisting in the Right, Obstinacy, he began to hate her with no small Invetracy.  CHAP. IV. Containing one of the most bloody Battles, or rather Duels, that were ever recorded in Domestic History.  FOR the Reasons mentioned in the preceding Chapter, and some other matrimonial Concessions, well known to most Husbands; and which, like the Secrets of Free Masonry, should be divulged to none who are not Members of that honorable Fraternity, Mrs. Partridge was pretty well satisfied, that she had condemned her Husband without Cause, and endeavored, by Acts of Kindness, to make him Amends for her false Suspicion. Her Passions were indeed, equally violent, which every Way they inclined: for, as she could be extremely angry, so could she be altogether as fond.  But though these Passions ordinarily succeeded each other, and scarce twenty-four Hours ever passed in which the Pedagogue was not, in some Degree, the Object of both; yet, on extraordinary Occasions, when the Passion of Anger had raged very high, the Remission was usually longer, and so was the Case at present; for she continued longer in a State of Affability, after this Fit of Jealousy was ended, than her Husband had ever known before: And had it not been for some little Exercises, which all the Followers of Xantippe are obliged to perform daily, Mr. Partridge would have enjoyed a perfect Serenity of several Months.  Perfect Calms at Sea are always suspected by the experienced Mariner to be the Forerunners of a Storm: And I know some Persons, who, without being generally the Devotees of Superstition, are apt to apprehend, that great and unusual Peace or Tranquillity, will be attended with its opposite: For which Reason the Ancients used, on such Occasions, to sacrifice to the Goddess Nemesis; a Deity who was thought by them to look with an invidious Eye on human Felicity, and to have a peculiar Delight in overturning it.  As we are very far from believing in anysuch Heathen Goddess, or from encouraging any Superstition, so we wish Mr. John Fr --, or some other such Philosopher, would bestir himself a little, in order to find out the real Cause of this sudden Transition, from good to bad Fortune, which has been so often remarked, and of which we shall proceed to give an Instance; for it is our Province to relate ^acts, and we shall leave Causes to Persons of much higher Genius.  Mankind have always taken great Delight in knowing and descanting on the Actions of others. Hence there have been, in all Ages, and Nations, certain, Places set apart for public Rendezvous, where the curious might meet, and satisfy their mutual Curiosity. Among these, the Barbers Shops have justly bore the Pre-eminence. Among the Greeks, Barbers News was a proverbial Expression, and Horace, in one of his Epistles, makes honorable Mention of the Roman Barbers in the same Light.  Those of England are known to be no wise inferior to their Greek or Roman Predecessors. You there see foreign Affairs discussed in a Manner little inferior to that with which they are handled in the Coffee-houses; and domestic Occurrences are much more largely and freely treated in the former, than in the latter. But this serves only for the Men. Now, whereas the Females of this Country, especially those of the lower Order, do associate themselves much more than those of other Nations, our Polity would be highly deficient, if they had not some Place set apart likewise for the Indulgence of their Curiosity, seeing they are in this no way inferior to the other half of the Species.  In enjoying, therefore, such Place of Rendezvous, the British Fair ought to esteem themselves more happy than any of their foreign Sisters; as I do not remember either to have read in History, to have seen in my Travels, any thing of the ^^e Kind.  This Place then is no other than the Chandler's Shop; the known Seat of all the News; or, as it is vulgarly called, Gossiping, in every Parish in England.  Mrs. Partridge being one Day at this Assembly of Females, was asked by one of her Neighbors, if she had heard no News lately of Jenny Jones. To which she answered in the Negative. Upon this, the other replied, with a Smile, that the Parish was very much obliged to her for having turned Jenny away as she did.  Mrs. Partridge, whose Jealousy, as the Reader well knows, was long since cured, and who had no other Quarrel to her Maid, answered boldly, She did not know any Obligation the Parish had to her on that Account, for she believed Jenny had scarce left her Equal behind her.  'No truly, said the Gossip, I hope not, tho'I fancy we have Sluts enough too.' 'Then you have not heard, it seems, that she has been brought to bed of two Bastards; but as they are not born here, my Husband, and the other Overseer, says we shall not be obliged to keep them.'  'Two Bastards!' answered Mrs. Partridge hastily, 'you surprise me. I don't know whether we must keep them; but I am sure they must have been begotten here, for the Wench has not been nine Months gone away.'  Nothing can be so quick and sudden as the Operations of the Mind, especially when Hope, or Fear; or Jealousy to which the two others are but Journeymen, set it to work. It occurred instantly to her, that Jenny had scarce ever been out of her own House, while she lived with her. The leaning over the Chair, the sudden starting up, the Latin, the Smile, and many other Things rushed upon her all at once. The Satisfaction her Husband expressed in the Departure of Jenny, appeared now to be only dissembled; again, in the same Instant to be real, and yet to confirm her Jealousy, as proceeding from Satiety, and a hundred other bad Causes. In a Word, she was convinced of her Husband's Guilt, and immediately left the Assembly in Confusion.  As fair Grimalkin, who, though the youngest of the Feline Family, degenerates not in Ferosity from the elder Branches of her House, and, though, inferior in Strength, is equal in Fierceness to the noble Tiger himself, when a little Mouse, whom it has long tormented in Sport, escapes from her Clutches for a while, frets, scolds, growls, swears; but if the Trunk, or Box, behind which the Mouse lay hid, be again removed, she flies like Lightning on her Prey, and with envenomed wrath, bites, scratches, mumbles and tears the little Animal.  Not with less Fury did Mrs. Partridge fly on the poor Pedagogue. Her Tongue, Teeth, and Hands, fell all upon him at once. His Wig was in an Instant torn from his Head, his Shirt from his Back, and from his Face descended five Streams of Blood, denoting the Number of Claws with which Nature had unhappily armed the Enemy.  Mr. Partridge acted for some Time on the defensive only; indeed he attempted only to guard his Face with his Hands; but as he found that his Antagonist abated nothing of her Rage, he thought she might, at least, endeavor to disarm her, or rather to confine her Arms; in doing which, her Cap fell off in the Struggle, and her Hair being too short to reach her Shoulders, erected itself on her Head; her Stays likewise, which were laced through one single Hole at the Bottom, burst open, and her Breasts, which were much more redundant than her Hair, hung down below her middle; her Face was likewise marked with the Blood of her Husband; her Teeth gnashed with Rage; and Fire, such as sparkles from a Smith's Forge, darted from her Eyes. So that, altogether, this Amazonian Heroine might have been an Object of Terror to a much bolder Man than Mr. Partridge.  He had at length, the good Fortune, by getting Possession of her Arms, to render those Weapons, which she wore at the Ends of her Fingers, useless; which she no sooner perceived, than the Softness o^ her Sex prevailed over her Rage, and she presently dissolved in Tears, which soon after concluded i^ a Fit.  That small Share of Sense which Mr. Partridge had hitherto preserved through this Scene of Fury of the Cause of which he was hitherto ignorant, now utterly abandoned him. He ran instantly into the Street, hollowing out, that his Wife was in the Agonies of Death, and beseeching the Neighbors to fly with the utmost Haste to her Assistance. Several good Women obeyed his Summons, who entering his House, and applying the usual Remedies on such Occasions, Mrs. Partridge was, all length, to the great Joy of her Husband, brought to herself.  As soon as she had a little recollected her Spirits and somewhat composed herself with a Cordial, she began to inform the Company of the manifold Injuries she had received from her Husband; who, she said, was not content to injure her in her Bed; but, upon her upbraiding him with it, had treated her in the cruelest Manner imaginable; had tore her Cap and Hair from her Head, and her Stays from her Body, giving her, at the same Time, several Blows, the Marks of which she should carry to the Grave.  The poor Man, who bore on his Face many ^ore visible Marks of the Indignaion of his Wife, ^od in silent Astonishment at this Accusation; which the Reader will, I believe, bear Witness for ^^m, had greatly exceeded the Truth; for indeed he had not struck her once; and this Silence being ^^terpreted to be a Confession of the Charge, by the whole Court, they all began at once, una voce, to ^ebuke and revile him, repeating often, that none at a Coward ever struck a Woman.  Mr. Partridge bore all this patiently; but when is Wife appealed to the Blood on her Face, as an Evidence of his Barbarity, he could not help laying ^laim to his own Blood, for so it really was: as ^e thought it very unnatural, that this should rise up (as we are taught that of a murdered Person often does) in Vengeance against him.  To this the Women made no other Answer, man that it was Pity it had not come from his Heart, instead of his Face; all declaring, that if their Husbands should lift their Hands against them, they would have their Heart's Blood out of their Bodies.  After much Admonition for what was past, and much good Advice to Mr. Partridge for his future Behavior, the Company, at length, departed, and often the Husband and Wife to a personal Conference together, in which Mr. Partridge soon learned the Cause of all his Sufferings.  CHAP. V. Containing much Matter to exercise the Judgment and Reflection of the Reader.
