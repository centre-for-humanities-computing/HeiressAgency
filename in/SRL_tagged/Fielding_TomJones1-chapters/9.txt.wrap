ever have a Morsel of Meat of mine, or a Farthing to buy it: If she will ha un, one Smock shall be her Portion. I Will sooner ge my Esteate to the zinking Fund, that it may be sent to Hannover to corrupt our Nation with.' I am heartily sorry,' cries Allworthy. 'Pox of your Sorrow,' says Western, 'it will do me Abundance of Good, when I have lost my only Child, my poor Sophy, that was the Joy of my Heart, and all the Hope and Comfort of my Age; but I am resolved I will turn her out of Doors, she shall beg and starve and rot in the Streets. Not one Hapenny, not a Hapenny shall she ever hae of mine. The Son of a Bitch was always good at finding a Hare sitting; an be rotted to'n, I little thought what Puss he was looking after; but it shall be the worst he ever vound in his Life. She shall be no better than Carrion; the Skin over is all he shall ha, and zu you may tell un.' 'I am in Amazement,' cries Alllworthy 'at what you tell me, after what passed between my Nephew and the young Lady no longer ago than Yesterday.' 'Yes, Sir,' answered Western, 'it was after what passed between your Nephew and she that the whole Matter came out. Mr. Blifil there was no sooner gone than the Son of a Whore came lurching about the House. Little did I think when I used to love him for a Sportsman, that he was all the while a poaching after my Daughter.' 'Why, truly,' says Allworthy, 'I could wish you had not given him so many Opportunities with her; and you will do me the Justice to acknowledge, that I have always been averse to his staying so much at your House, though I own I had no Suspicion of this Kind.' 'Why, Zounds!' cries Western, 'who could have thought it? What the Devil had she to do wi'n? He did not come there a courting to her, he came a hunting with me.' 'But was it possible,' says Allworthy, 'that you should never discern any Symptoms of Love between them, when you have seen them so often together? 'Never in my Life, as I hope to be saved,' cries Western. I never so much as see him kiss her in all my Life; and so far from courting her, he used rather to be more silent when she was in Company than at any other Time: And as for the Girl, she was always less civil to'n than to any young Man that came to the House. As to that Matter, I am not more easy to be deceived than another, I would not have you think I am Neighbor.' Allworthy could scarce refrain Laughter at this; but he resolved to do a Violence to himself: For he perfectly well knew Mankind, and had too much good Breeding and good Nature to offend the Squire in his present Circumstances. He then asked Western what he would have him do upon this Occasion. To which the other answered, 'That he would have him keep the Rascal away from his House, and that he would go and lock up the Wench: For he was resolved to make her marry Mr. Blifil in Spite of her Teeth.' He then shook Blifil by the Hand, and swore he would have no other Son-in-law. Presently after which he took his Leave, saying, his House was in such Disorder, that it was necessary for him to make Haste home, to take care his Daughter did not give him the Slip; and as for Jones, he swore if he caught him at his House, he would qualify him to run for the Gelding's Plate.  When Allworthy and Blifil were again left together, a long Silence ensued between them; all which Interval the young Gentleman filled up with Sighs, which proceeded partly from Disappointment, but more from Hatred: For the Success of Jones was much more grievous to him, than the Loss of Sophia.  At length his Uncle asked him what he was determined to do, and he answered in the following Words. 'Alas, Sir, can it be a Question what Step a Lover will take, when Reason and Passion point different Ways? I am afraid it is too certain he will, in that Dilemma, always follow the latter. Reason dictates to me, to quit all Thoughts of a Woman who places her Affections on another; my Passion bids me hope she may, in Time, change her Inclinations in my Favor. Here, however, I conceive an Objection may be raised, which if it could not fully be answered, would totally deter me from any further Pursuit. I mean the Injustice of endeavoring to supplant another, in a Heart of which he seems already in Possession; but the determined Resolution of Mr. Western shows, that in this Case, I shall by so doing, promote the Happiness of every Party; not only that of the Parent, who will thus be preserved from the highest Degree of Misery, but of both the others, who must be undone by this Match. The Lady, I am sure, will be undone in every Sense: For besides the Loss of most Part of her own Fortune, she will be married not only to a Beggar, but the little Fortune which her Father cannot withold from her, will be squandered on that Wench, with whom I know he yet converses -- Nay, that is a Trifle: For I know him to be one of the worst Men in the World: For had my dear Uncle known what I have hitherto endeavored to conceal, he must have long since abandoned so profligate a Wretch.' 'How,' said Allworthy, 'hath he done any Thing worse than I already know? Tell me, I beseech you.' 'No,' replied Blifil, 'it is now past, and perhaps he may have repented of it.' 'I command you on your Duty,' said Allworthy, to tell me what you mean.' 'You know, Sir,' says Blifil, 'I never disobeyed you: but I am sorry I mentioned it, since it may now look like Revenge, whereas, I thank Heaven, no such Motive ever entered my Heart; and if you oblige me to discover it, I must be his Petitioner to you for your Forgiveness.' 'I will have no Conditions,' answered Allworthy, 'I think I have shown Tenderness enough toward him, and more, perhaps, than you ought to thank me for.' 'More, indeed, I fear than he deserved,' cries Blifil, 'for in the very Day of your utmost Danger, when myself and all the Family were in Tears, he filled the House with Riot and Debauchery. He drank and sung and roared, and when I gave him a gentle Hint of the Indecency of his Actions, he fell into a violent Passion, swore many Oaths, called me Rascal, and struck me.' 'How!' cries Allworthy, 'did he dare to strike you?' 'I am sure,' cries Blifil, 'I have forgiven him that long ago. I wish I could so easily forget his Ingratitude to the best of Benefactors; and yet, even that, I hope you will forgive him, since he must have certainly been possessed with the Devil: For that very Evening, as Mr. Thwackum and myself were taking the Air in the Fields, and exulting in the good Symptoms which then first began to discover themselves, we unluckily saw him engaged with a Wench in a Manner not fit to be mentioned. Mr. Thwackum, with more Boldness than Prudence, advanced to rebuke him, (when I am sorry to say it,) he fell upon the worthy Man, and beat him so outragiously, that I wish he may have yet recovered the Bruises. Nor was I without my Share of the Effects of his Malice, while I endeavored to protect my Tutor: But that I have long forgiven, nay I prevailed with Mr. Thwackum to forgive him too, and not to inform you of a Secret which I feared might be fatal to him. And now, Sir, since I have unadvisedly dropped a Hint of this Matter, and your Commands have obliged me to discover the whole, let me intercede with you for him.' 'O Child,' said Allworthy, I know not whether I should blame or applaud your Goodness, in concealing such Villainy a Moment; but where is Mr. Thwackum? Not that I want any Confirmation of what you say; but I will examine all the Evidence of this Matter, to justify to the World the Example I am resolved to make of such a Monster.'  Thwackum was now sent for, and presently appeared. He corroborated every Circumstance which the other deposed. Nay, he produced the Record upon his Breast, where the Handwriting of Mr. Jones remained very legible in black and blue. He concluded with declaring to Mr. Allworthy, that he should have long since informed him of this Matter, had not Mr. Blifil, by the most earnest Interpositions, prevented him. 'He is, says he, an excellent Youth; though such Forgiveness of Enemies is carrying the Matter too far.'  In reality, Blifil had taken some Pains to prevail with the Parson, and to prevent the Discovery at that Time; for which he had many Reasons. He knew that the Minds of Men are apt to be softened and relaxed from their usual Severity by Sickness. Besides, he imagined that if the Story was told when the Fact was so recent, and the Physician about the House, who might have unravelled the real Truth, he should never be able to give it the malicious Turn which he intended. Again, he resolved to hoard up this Business, till the Indiscretion of Jones should afford some additional Complaints; for he thought the joint Weight of many Facts falling upon him together, would be the most likely to crush him; and he watched therefore some such Opportunity as that, with which Fortune had now kindly presented him. Lastly, by prevailing with Thwackum to conceal the Matter for a Time, he knew he should confirm an Opinion of his Friendship to Jones, which he had greatly labored to establish in Mr. Allworthy.  CHAP. XI. A short Chapter; but which contains sufficient Matter to affect the good-natured Reader.  IT was Mr. Allworthy's Custom never to punish any one, not even to turn away a Servant, in a Passion. He resolved, therefore, to delay his passing Sentence on Jones till the Afternoon.  The poor young Man attended at Dinner, as usual; but his Heart was too much loaded to suffer him to eat. His Grief was a good deal aggravated by the unkind Looks of Mr. Allworthy; whence he concluded that Western had discovered the whole Affair between him and Sophia: But as to Mr. Blifil's Story, he had not the least Apprehension; for of much the greater Part he was entirely innocent, and for the Residue, as he had forgiven and forgotten it himself, so he suspected no Remembrance on the other Side. When Dinner was over, and the Servants departed, Mr. Allworthy began to harangue. He set forth, in a long Speech, the many Iniquities of which Jones had been guilty, particularly those which this Day had brought to light, and concluded by telling him, 'that unless he could clear himself of the Charge, he was resolved to banish him from his Sight for ever.'  Many Disadvantages attended poor Jones in making his Defense; nay, indeed he hardly knew his Accusation: For as Mr. Allworthy, in recounting the Drunkenness, etc. while he lay ill, out of modesty sunk every thing that related particularly to himself, which indeed principally constituted the Crime, Jones could not deny the Charge. His Heart was, besides, almost broken already, and his Spirits were so sunk, that he could say nothing for himself; but acknowledged the whole, and, like a Criminal in Despair, threw himself upon Mercy; concluding, 'That though he must own himself guilty of many Follies and Inadvertencies, he hoped he had done nothing to deserve what would be to him the greatest Punishment in the World.'  Allworthy answered, 'that he had forgiven him too often already, in Compassion to his Youth, and in Hopes of his Amendment: That he now found he was an abandoned Reprobate, and such as it would be criminal in any one to support and encourage. Nay,' said Mr. Allworthy to him, 'your audacious Attempt to steal away the young Lady, calls upon me to justify my own Character in punishing you. The World, who have already censured the Regard I have for you, may think, with some Color at least of Justice, that I connive at so base and barbarous an Action. An Action of which you must have known my Abhorrence, and which, had you any Concern for my Ease and Honor, as well as for my Friendship, you would never have thought of undertaking. Fie upon it, young Man! indeed there is scarce any Punishment equal to your Crimes, and I can scarce think myself justifiable in what I am now going to bestow on you. However, as I have educated you like a Child of my own, I will not turn you naked into the World. When you open this Paper, therefore, you will find something which may enable you with Industry, to get an honest Livelihood; but if you employ it to worse Purposes, I shall not think myself obliged to supply you farther, being resolved, from this Day forward, to converse no more with you on any Account. I cannot avoid saying, There is no Part of your Conduct which I resent more than your ill Treatment of that good young Man (meaning Blifil) who had behaved with so much Tenderness and Honor toward you.'  These last Words were a Dose almost too bitter to be swallowed. A Flood of Tears now gushed from the Eyes of Jones, and every Faculty of Speech and Motion seemed to have deserted him. It was some Time before he was able to obey Allworthy's peremptory Commands of departing; which he at length did, having first kissed his Hands with a Passion difficult to be affected, and as difficult be described.  The Reader must be very weak, if when he considers the Light in which Jones then appeared to Mr. Allworthy, he should blame the Rigor of his Sentence. And yet all the Neighborhood, either from this Weakness, or from a worse Motive, condemned this Justice and Severity as the highest Cruelty. Nay, the very Persons who had before censured the good Man for the Kindness and Tenderness shown to a Bastard (his own, according to the general Opinion) now cried out as loudly against turning his own Child out of Doors. The Women especially were unanimous in taking the Part of Jones, and raised more Stories on the Occasion, than I have room, in this Chapter, to set down.  One Thing must not be omitted, that in their Censures on this Occasion, none ever mentioned the Sum contained in the Paper which Allworthy gave Jones, which was no less than Five hundred Pounds; but all agreed that he was sent away Pennyless, and some said, naked from the House of his inhuman Father.  CHAP. XII. Containing Love Letters, etc.  JONES was commanded to leave the House immediately, and told, that his Clothes and every thing else should be sent to him whithersoever he should order them.  He accordingly set out, and walked above a Mile, not regarding, and indeed scarce knowing whither he went. At length a little Brook obstructed his Passage, he threw himself down by the Side of it; nor could he help muttering with some little Indignation, 'Sure my Father will not deny me this Place to rest in?'  Here he presently fell into the most violent Agonies, tearing his Hair from his Head, and using most other Actions which generally accompany Fits of Madness, Rage, and Despair.  When he had in this Manner vented the first Emotions of Passion, he began to come a little to himself. His Grief now took another Turn, and discharged itself in a gentler Way, till he became at last cool enough to reason with his Passion, and to consider what Steps were proper to be taken in his deplorable Condition.  And now the great Doubt was how to act with regard to Sophia. The Thoughts of leaving her almost rent his Heart asunder; but the Consideration of reducing her to Ruin and Beggary still racked him, if possible, more; and if the violent Desire of possessing her Person could have suffered him to listen one Moment to the Alternative, still he was by no means certain of her Resolution to indulge his Wishes at so high an Expense. The Resentment of Mr. Allworthy, and the Injury he must do to his Quiet, argued strongly against this latter; and lastly, the apparent Impossibility of his Success, even if he would sacrifice all these Considerations to it, came to his Assistance; and thus Honor at last, backed with Despair, with Gratitude to his Benefactor, and with real Love to his Mistress, got the better of burning Desire, and he resolved rather to quit Sophia, than to pursue her to Ruin.  It is difficult for any who have not felt it, to conceive the glowing Warmth which filled his Breast, on the first Contemplation of this Victory over his Passion. Pride flattered him so agreeably, that his Mind perhaps enjoyed perfect Happiness; but this was only momentary, Sophia soon returned to his Imagination, and allayed the Joy of his Triumph with no less bitter Pangs than a good-natured General must feel when he surveys the bleeding Heaps, at the Price of whose Blood he has purchased his Laurels; for thousands of tender Ideas lay murdered before our Conqueror.  Being resolved, however, to pursue the Paths of this Giant Honor, as the gigantic Poet Lee calls it, he determined to write a farewell to Sophia; and accordingly proceeded to a House not far off, where, being furnished with Materials, he wrote as follows: MADAM, 'WHEN you reflect on the Situation in which I write, I am sure your Goodnature will pardon any Inconsistency or Absurdity which my Letter contains; for every thing here flows from a Heart so full, that no Language can express its Dictates.'  'I have resolved, Madam, to obey your Commands, in flying for ever from your dear, your lovely Sight. Cruel indeed those Commands are; but it is a Cruelty which proceeds from Fortune, not from my Sophia. Fortune has made it necessary, necessary to your Preservation, to forget there ever was such a Wretch as I am.'  'Believe me, I would not hint all my Sufferings to you, if I imagined they could possibly escape your Ears. I know the Goodness and Tenderness of your Heart, and would avoid giving you any of those Pains which you always feel for the Miserable. O let nothing which you shall hear of my hard Fortune cause a Moment's Concern; for after the Loss of you, every thing is to me a Trifle.'  'O my Sophia! it is hard to leave you; it is harder still to desire you to forget me; yet the sincerest Love obliges me to both. Pardon my conceiving that any Remembrances of me can give you Disquiet; but if I am so gloriously wretched, sacrifice me every Way to your Relief. Think I never loved you; or think truly how little I deserve you; and learn to scorn me for a Presumption which, can never be too severely punished. -- I am unable to say more -- May Guardian Angels protect you for ever.'     He was now searching his Pockets for his Wax, but found none, nor indeed any thing else, therein; for in Truth he had, in his frantic Disposition, tossed every thing from him, and, amongst the rest, his Pocketbook, which he had received from Mr. Allworthy, which he had never opened, and which now first occurred to his Memory.  The House supplied him with a Wafer for his present Purpose, with which having sealed his Letter, he returned hastily toward the Brook Side, in order to search for the Things which he had there lost. In his Way he met his old Friend Black George, who heartily condoled with him on his misfortune; for this had already reached his Ears, and indeed those of all the Neighbors.  Jones acquainted the Game-keeper with his Loss, and he as readily went back with him to the Brook, where they searched every Tuft of Grass in the Meadow, as well where Jones had not been, as where he had been; but all to no Purpose, for they found nothing: For indeed, though the Things were then in the Meadow, they omitted to search the only Place where they were deposited; to wit, in the Pockets of the said George; for he had just before found them, and being luckily apprized of their Value, had very carefully put them up for his own Use.  The Game-keeper having exerted as much Diligence in Quest of lost Goods, as if he had hoped to find them, desired Mr. Jones to recollect if he had been in no other Place; 'For sure,' 'said he, 'if you had lost them here so lately, the Things must have been here still; for this is a very unlikely Place for any one to pass by;' and indeed it was by great Accident that he himself had passed through the Field, in order to lay the Wires for Hares, with which he was to supply a Poulterer at Bath the next Morning.  Jones now gave over all Hopes of recovering his Loss, and almost all Thoughts concerning it, and turning to Black George, asked him earnestly, If he would do him the greatest Favor in the World.  'George answered, with some Hesitation, Sir, you know you may command me whatever is in my Power, and I heartily wish it was in my Power to do you any Service.' In fact, the Question staggared him; for he had, by selling Game, amassed a pretty good Sum of Money in Mr. Western's Service, and was afraid that Jones wanted to borrow some small Matter of him; but he was presently relieved from his Anxiety, by being desired to convey a Letter to Sophia, which with great Pleasure he promised to do. And indeed, I believe there are few Favors which he would not have gladly conferred on Mr. Jones; for he bore as much Gratitude toward him as he could, and was as honest as Men who love Money better than any other Thing in the Universe generally are.  Mrs. Honor was agreed by both to be the proper Means by which this Letter should pass to Sophia. They then separated; the Game-keeper returned home to Mr. Western's, and Jones walked to an Alehouse at half a Mile's Distance, to wait for his Messenger's Return.  George no sooner came home to his Master's House, than he met with Mrs. Honor; to whom, having first sounded her with a few previous Questions, he delivered the Letter for her Mistress, and received at the same Time another from her for Mr. Jones; which Honor told him she had carried all that Day in her Bosom, and began to despair of finding any Means of delivering it.  The Game-keeper returned hastily and joyfully to Jones, who having received Sophia's Letter from him, instantly withdrew, and eagerly breaking it open, read as follows:  SIR, 'IT is impossible to express what I have felt since I saw you. Your submitting, on my Account, to such cruel Insults from my Father, lays me under an Obligation I shall ever own. As you know his Temper, I beg you will, for my Sake, avoid him. I wish I had any Comfort to send you; but believe this, that nothing but the last Violence shall ever give my Hand or Heart where you would be sorry to see them bestowed.'   Jones read this Letter a hundred Times over, and kissed it a hundred Times as often. His Passion now brought all tender Desires back into his Mind. He repented that he had writ to Sophia in the Manner we have seen above; but he repented more that he had made use of the Interval of his Messenger's Absence to write and dispatch a Letter to Mr. Allworthy, in which he had faithfully promised and bound himself to quit all Thoughts of his Love. However, when his cool Reflections returned, he plainly perceived that his Case was neither mended nor altered by Sophia's Billet, unless to give him some little Glimpse of Hope from her Constancy, of some favorable Accident hereafter. He therefore resumed his Resolution, and taking leave of Black George, set forward to a Town about five Miles distant, whither he had desired Mr. Allworthy, unless he pleased to revoke his Sentence, to send his Things after him.  CHAP. XIII. The Behavior of Sophia on the present Occasion; which none of her Sex will blame, who are capable of behaving in the same Manner. And the Discussion of a knotty Point in the Court of Conscience.  SOPHIA had passed the last twenty-four Hours in no very desirable Manner. During a large Part of them she had been entertained by her Aunt, with Lectures of Prudence, recommending to her the Example of the polite World, where Women consider Matrimony, as Men do Offices of public Trust, only as the means of making their Fortunes, and of advancing themselves in the World. In commenting on which Text Mrs. Western had displayed her Eloquence several Hours.  These sagacious Lectures, though little suited either to the Taste or Inclination of Sophia, were, however, less irksome to her than her own Thoughts, that formed the Entertainment of the Night, during which she never once closed her Eyes.  But though she could neither sleep nor rest in her Bed, yet, having no Avocation from it, she was found there by her Father at his return from Allworthy's, which was not till past Ten o'Clock in the Morning. He went directly up to her Apartment, opened the Door, and seeing she was not up -- cried 'Oh! you are safe then, and I am resolved to keep you so' He then locked the Door and delivered the Key to Honor, having first given her the strictest Charge, with great Promises of Rewards for her Fidelity, and most dreadful Menaces of Punishment, in case she should betray her Trust.  Honor's Orders were not to suffer her Mistress to come out of her Room without the Authority of the Squire himself, and to admit none to her but him and her Aunt; but she was herself to attend her with whatever Sophia pleased, except only Pen, Ink, and Paper, of which she was forbidden the Use.  The Squire ordered his Daughter to dress herself and attend him at Dinner; which she obeyed; and having sat the usual Time, was conducted to her Prison.  In the Evening, the Jailer Honor brought her the Letter which she received from the Game-keeper. Sophia read it very attentively twice or thrice over, and then threw herself upon the Bed, and burst into a Flood of Tears. Mrs. Honor expressed great Astonishment at this Behavior in her Mistress; nor could she forbear very eagerly begging to know the Cause of this Passion. Sophia made her no Answer for some Time, and then starting suddenly up, caught her Maid by the Hand, and cried, 'O Honor! I am undone.' 'I wish the Letter had been burnt before I had brought it to your La'ship. I Am sure I thought it would have comforted your La'ship, or I would have seen it at the Devil before I would have touched it.' 'Honour, says Sophia, 'you are a good Girl, and it is vain to attempt concealing longer my Weakness from you; I have thrown away my Heart on a Man who has forsaken me.' And is Mr. Jones, answered the Maid, 'such a Perfidy Man?' 'He has taken his Leave of me' says Sophia, 'for ever in that Letter. Nay, he has desired me to forget him. Could he have desired that, if he had loved me? Could he have borne such a Thought? could he have written such a Word?' No certainly, Ma'am,' cries Honor, 'and to be sure, if the best Man in England was to desire me to forget him, I Would take him at his Word. Marry come up! I am sure your La'ship has done him too much Honor ever to think on him. A young Lady who may take her Choice of all the young Men in the County. And to be sure, if I may be so presumptious as to offer my poor Opinion, there is young Mr. Blifil, who besides that he is come of honest Parents, and will be one of the greatest Squires all hereabouts, he is to be sure, in my poor Opinion, a more handsomer, and a more politer Man by half; and besides, he is a young Gentleman of a sober Character, and may defy any of the Neighbors to say black is his Eye: He follows no dirty Trollops, nor can any Bastards be laid at his Door. Forget him indeed! I thank Heaven I myself am not so much at my last Prayers, as to suffer any Man to bid me forget him twice. If the best He that wears a Head was for to go for to offer for to say such an affronting Word to me, I would never give him my Company afterward, if there was another young Man in the Kingdom. And as I was a saying, to be sure, there is young Mr. Blifil, -- Name not his detested Name,' cries Sophia. 'Nay, Ma'am, says Honor, if your La'ship does not like him, there be more jolly handsome young Men that would court your La'ship, if they had but the least Encouragement. I don't believe there is arrow young Gentleman in this County, or the next to it, that if your La'ship was but to look as if you had a Mind to him, would not come about to make his Offers directly.' 'What a Wretch do thou imagine me,' cries Sophia, 'by affronting my Ears with such Stuff! I detest all Mankind.' 'Nay, to be sure, Ma'am,' answered Honor, 'your La'ship has had enough to give you a Surfeit of them. To be used ill by such a poor beggarly bastardly Fellow.' Hold your blasphemous Tongue,' cries Sophia, how dare you mention his Name with Disrespect before me? He use me ill? No, his poor bleeding Heart suffered more when he writ the cruel Words, than mine from reading them. O! he is all heroic Virtue, and Angelic Goodness. I am ashamed of the Weakness of my own Passion, for blaming what I ought to admire. -- O Honor! it is my good only which he consults. To my Interest he sacrifices both himself and me. -- The Apprehension of ruining me has driven him to Despair.' 'I am very glad, says Honor, 'to hear your La'ship takes that into your Consideration: for to be sure, it must be nothing less than Ruin, to give your Mind to one that is turned out of Doors, and is not worth a Farthing in the World. 'Turned out of Doors! cries Sophia hastily, 'how! what do thou mean? 'Why, to be sure, Ma'am, my Master no sooner told Squire Allworthy about Mr. Jones having offered to make Love to your 'Ladyship, than the Squire stripped him stark naked, and turned him out of Doors. 'Ha! says Sophia, have I been the cursed, wretched Cause of his Destruction? -- Turned naked out of Doors! Here, Honor, take all the Money I have; take the Rings from my Fingers. -- Here my Watch, carry him all. -- Go, find him immediately. For Heaven's Sake, Ma'am, answered Mrs. Honor, 'do but consider, if my Master should miss any of these Things, I should be made to Answer for them. Therefore let me beg your Ladyship not to part with your Watch and Jewels. Besides the Money, I think, is enough of all Conscience; and as for that, my Master can never know any thing of the Matter.' 'Here then,' cries Sophia, take every Farthing I am worth, find him out immediately and' give it him. Go, go, lose not a Moment.  Mrs. Honor departed according to Orders, and finding Black George below Stairs, delivered him the Purse which contained Sixteen Guineas, being indeed the whole Stock of Sophia: For though her Father was very liberal to her, she was much too generous herself to be rich.  Black George having received the Purse, set forward toward the Alehouse; but in the Way a Thought occurred to him, whether he should not detain this Money likewise. His Conscience, however, immediately started at this Suggestion, and began to upbraid him with Ingratitude to his Benefactor. To this his Avarice answered, 'That his Conscience should have considered that Matter before, when he deprived poor Jones of his 500l. That having quietly acquiesced in what was of so much greater Importance, it was absurd, if not downright Hypocrisy, to affect any Qualms at this Trifle.' In return to which, Conscience, like a good Lawyer, attempted to distinguish between an absolute Breach of Trust, as here where the Goods were delivered, and a bare Concealment of what was found, as in the former Case. Avarice presently treated this with Ridicule, called it a Distinction without a Difference, and absolutely insisted, that when once all Pretensions of Honor and Virtue were given up in any one Instance, that there was no Precedent for resorting to them upon a second Occasion. In short, poor Conscience had certainly been defeated in the Argument, had not Fear stepped in to her Assistance, and very strenuously urged, that the real Distinction between the two Actions, did not lie in the different Degrees of Honor, but of Safety: For that the secreting the 500l. was a Matter of very little Hazard; whereas the detaining the Sixteen Guineas was liable to the utmost Danger of Discovery.  By this friendly Aid of Fear, Conscience obtained a complete Victory in the Mind of Black George, and after making him a few Compliments on his Honesty, forced him to deliver the Money to Jones.  CHAP. XIV. A short Chapter, containing a short Dialogue between Squire Western and his Sister.  MRS. Western had been engaged abroad all that Day. The Squire met her at her Return home; and when she enquired after Sophia, he acquainted her that he had secured her safe enough. 'She is locked up in Chamber,' cries he, 'and Honor keeps the Key.' As his Looks were full of prodigious Wisdom and Sagacity when he gave his Sister this Information, it is probable he expected much Applause from her for what he had done; but how was he disappointed, when with a most disdainful Aspect, she cried, 'Sure Brother, you are the weakest of all Men. Why will you not confide in me for the Management of my Niece? Why will you interpose? You have now undone all that I have been spending my Breath in order to bring about. While I have been endeavoring to fill her Mind with Maxims of Prudence, you have been provoking her to reject them. English Women, Brother, I thank Heaven, are no Slaves. We are not to be locked up like the Spanish and Italian Wives. We have as good a Right to Liberty as yourselves. We are to be convinced by Reason and Persuasion only, and not governed by Force. I have seen the World, Brother, and know what Arguments to make Use of; and if your Folly had not prevented me, should have prevailed with her to form her Conduct by those Rules of Prudence and Discretion which I formerly taught her.' 'To be sure,' said the Squire,. I am always in the Wrong.' 'Brother,' answered the Lady, 'you are not in the Wrong, unless when you meddle with Matters beyond your Knowledge. You must agree, that I have seen most of the World; and happy had it been for my Niece, if she had not been taken from under my Care. It is by living at home with you that she has learnt romantic Notions of Love and Nonsense.' 'You don't imagine, I hope,' cries the Squire, 'that I have taught her any such Things.' Your Ignorance, Brother,' returned she, 'as the great Milton says, almost subdues my Patience.' The Reader may perhaps subdue his own Patience, if he searches for this in Milton. 'D -- n Milton,' answered the Squire, 'if he had the Impudence to say so to my Face, I Would lend him a Douse, thof he was never so great a Man. Patience! an you come to that, Sister, I have more Occasion of Patience, to be used like an overgrown Schoolboy as I am by' you. Do you think no one has any Understanding, unless he has been about at Court? Pox! the World is come to a fine Pass indeed, if we are all Fools, except a Parcel of Roundheads and Hannover Rats. Pox! I hope the Times are a coming that we shall make Fools of them, and every Man shall enjoy his own. That Is all, Sister, and every man shall enjoy his own.
