have minded what the Parson says,' cries the eldest, 'and not a harkened after Men Voke.' 'Indeed, Child, and so she had,' says the Mother sobbing, 'she has brought a disgrace upon us all. She Is the vurst of the Vamily that ever was a Whore.' You need not upbraid me with that, Mother, cries Molly, 'you yourself was brought to-bed of Sister there within a Week after you was married,' 'Yes, Hussy,' answered the enraged Mother, 'so I was, and what was the mighty Matter of that? I was made an honest Woman then; and if you was to be made an honest Woman I should not be angry; but you must have to doing with a Gentleman, you nasty Slut, you will have a Bastard, Hussy, you will; and that I defy any one to say of me.'  In this Situation Black George found his Family, when he came home for the Purpose before mentioned. As his Wife and three Daughters were all of them talking together, and most of them crying, it was some time before he could get an Opportunity ^f being heard; but as soon as such an Interval occurred, acquainted the Company with what Sophia had said to him.  Goody Seagrim then began to revile her Daughter afresh. 'Here,' says she, 'you have brought us into a fine Quandary indeed. What will Madam say to that big Belly? Oh that ever I should live to see this Day.  Molly answered with great Spirit, 'And what is this mighty Place which you have got for me, Father?' (for he had not well understood the Phrase ^^sed by Sophia of being about her Person) 'I suppose it is to be under the Cook; but I shall not wash Dishes for any Body. My Gentleman will provide better for me. See what he has given me this Afternoon; he has promised I shall never want Money; and you shall not want Money neither, Mother, if you will hold your Tongue, and know when you are well.' And so saying, she pulled out several Guineas, and gave her Mother one of them.  The good Woman no sooner felt the Gold within her Palm, than her Temper began (such is the Efficacy of that Panacea) to be mollified. 'Why Husband,' says she, 'would any but such a Blockhead as you not have enquired what Place this was before he had accepted it! Perhaps, as Molly says, it may be in the Kitchen, and truly I don't care my Daughter should be a Scullion Wench: For poor as I am, I am a Gentlewoman. And thof I was obliged, as my Father, who was a Clergyman died worse than nothing, and so could not give me a Shilling of Potion, to undervalue myself, by marrying a poor Man, yet I would have you to know, I have a Spirit above all them Things. Marry come up, it would better become Madam Western to look at Home, and remember who her own Grandfather was. Some of my Family, for ought I know, might ride in their Coaches, when the Grandfathers of some Voke walked a-voot. I warrant she fancies she did a mighty Matter, when she sent us that old Gownd; some of my Family would not have picked up such Rags in the Streets; but poor People are always trampled upon. -- The Parish need not have been in such a Fluster with Molly. -- You might have told them, Child, your Grandmother wore better Things new out of the Shop.'  'Well but, consider,' cried George, 'What Answer shall I make to Madam?' 'I don't know what Answer,' says she, 'You are always bringing your Family into one Quandary or other. Do you remember when you shot the Partridge, the Occasion of all our Misfortunes? Did not I advise you never to go into Squire Western's Manor? Did not I tell you many a good Year ago what would come of it? but you would have your own headstrong Ways; yes, you would, you Villain -- '  Black George was, in the main, a peaceable kind of Fellow, and nothing choleric, nor rash, yet did he bear about him something of what the Ancients called the Irascible, and which his Wife, if she had been endowed with much Wisdom, would have feared. He had long experienced, that when the Storm grew very high Arguments were but Wind, which served rather to increase than to abate it. He was therefore seldom unprovided with a small Switch, a Remedy of wonderful Force, as he had often essayed, and which the Word Villain served as a Hint for his applying.  No sooner, therefore, had this Symptom appeared, than he had immediate Recourse to the said Remedy, which though, as it is usual in all very efficacious Medicines, it at first seemed to heighten and inflame the Disease, soon produced a total Calm, and restored the Patient to perfect Ease and Tranquillity.  This is, however, a kind of Horse-medicine, which requires a very robust Constitution to digest, and is therefore only proper for the Vulgar, unless in one single Instance, viz. where Superiority of Birth breaks out; in which Case, we should not think it very improperly applied by any Husband whatever, if the Application was not, in itself so base, that, like certain Applications of the Physical Kind which need not be mentioned, it so much degrades and contaminates the Hand employed in it, that no Gentleman should endure the Thought of any Thing so low and detestable.  The whole Family were soon reduced to a State of perfect Quiet: For the Virtue of this Medicine, like that of Electricity, is often communicated through one Person to many others, who are not touched by the Instrument. To say the Truth, as they both operate by Friction, it may be doubted whether there is not something analogous between them, of which Mr. Freke would do well to enquire before he publishes the next Edition of his Book.  A Council was now called, in which, after many Debates, Molly still persisting that she would not go to Service, it was at length resolved, that Goody Seagrim herself should wait on Miss Western, and endeavor to procure the Place for her elder Daughter, who declared great Readiness to accept it; but Fortune, who seems to have been an Enemy of this little Family, afterward put a Stop to her Promotion.  CHAP. X. A Story told by Mr. Supple, the Curate. The Penetration of Squire Western. His great Love for his Daughter, and the Return to it made by her.  THE next Morning Tom Jones hunted with Mr. Western, and was at his Return invited by that Gentleman to Dinner.  The lovely Sophia shone forth that Day with more Gaiety and Sprightliness than usual. Her Battery was certainly levelled at our Hero; though, I believe, she herself scarce yet knew her own Intention; but if she had any Design of charming him, she now succeeded.  Mr. Supple, the Curate of Mr. Allworthy's Parish, made one of the Company. He was a goood-natured worthy Man; but chiefly remarkable for his great Taciturnity at Table, though his Mouth was never shut at it. In short, he had one of the best Appetites in the World. However, the Cloth was no sooner taken away, than he always made sufficient Amends for his Silence: For he was a very hearty Fellow; and his Conversation was often entertaining, never offensive.  At his first Arrival, which was immediately before the Entrance of the Roast-beef, he had given an Intimation that he had brought some News with him, and was beginning to tell, that he came that Moment from Mr. Allworthy's, when the Sight of the Roastbeef, struck him dumb, permitting him only to say Grace, and to declare he must pay his Respect to the Baronet: For so he called the Sirloin.  When Dinner was over, being reminded by Sophia of his News, he began as follows, 'I believe, Lady, your Ladyship observed a young Woman at Church yesterday at Even-song, who was dressed in one of your outlandish Garments; I think I have seen your Ladyship in such a one. However, in the Country, such Dresses are  Raro avis in Terris, nigroque simillima Cycno, That is, Madam, as much as to say,  'A rare Bird upon the Earth, and very like a' black Swan. 'The Verse is in Juvenal: but to return to what I was relating. I was saying such Garments are rare Sights in the Country, and perchance too, it was thought the more rare, Respect being had to the Person who wore it, who, they tell me, is the Daughter of Black George, your Worship's Gamekeeper, whose Sufferings I should have opined, might have taught him more Wit than to dress forth his Wenches in such gaudy Apparel. She created so much Confusion in the Congregation, that if Squire Allworthy had not silenced it, it would have interrupted the Service: For I was once about to stop in the Middle of the first Lesson. Howbeit, nevertheless, after Prayer was over, and I was departed home, this occasioned a Battle in the Churchyard, where, amongst other Mischief, the Head of a traveling Fiddler was very much broken. This Morning the Fiddler came to Squire Allworthy for a Warrant, and the Wench was brought before him. The Squire was inclined to have compounded Matters; when, lo! on a sudden, the Wench appeared (I ask your Ladyship Pardon) to be, as it were at the Eve of bringing forth a Bastard. The Squire demanded of her who was the Father; but she pertinaciously refused to make any Response. So that he was about to make her Mittimus to Bridewel,' when I departed.'  'And is a Wench having a Bastard all your News, Doctor? cries Western. 'I thought it might have been some public Matter, something about the Nation.'  'I am afraid it is too common, indeed,' answered the Parson, 'but I thought the whole Story altogether deserved commemorating. As to National Matters, your Worship knows them best. My Concerns extend no farther than my own Parish.'  'Why ay,' says the Squire.' 'I believe I do know a little Matter, as you say; but come, Tommy, drink about, the Bottle stands with you.'  Tom begged to be excused, for that he had particular Business; and getting up from Table, escaped the Clutches of the Squire who was rising to stop him, and went off with very little Ceremony.  The Squire gave him a good Curse at his Departure; and then turning to the Parson, he cried out, 'I smoke it, I smoke it. Tom is certainly the Father of this Bastard.' 'Zooks, Parson, you remember how he recommended the Veather o'her to me -- d -- n un, what a sly B -- ch it is. Ay ay, as sure as Twopence, Tom is Veather of the Bastard.'  'I should be very sorry for that,' says the Parson. 'Why sorry, cries the Squire, Where is the mighty Matter o't? What I suppose, do pretend that thee have never got a Bastard? Pox! more good Luck's thine: for I warrant have done therefore many's the good Time and often. 'Your Worship is pleased to be jocular,' answered the Parson, but I do not only animadvert on the Sinfulness of the Action, though that surely is to be greatly deprecated; but I fear his Unrighteousness may injure him with Mr. Allworthy. And truly I must say, though he has the Character of being a little wild, I never saw any Harm in the young Man; nor can I say I have heard any, save what your Worship now mentions. I wish, indeed he was a little more regular in his Responses at Church; but altogether he seems.'  'Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris. 'That is a classical Line, young Lady, and being rendered into English, is, a A Lad of an ingenuous Countenance and of an ingenuous Modesty: For this was a Virtue in great Repute both among the Latins and Greeks. I must say the young Gentleman (for so I think I may call him, notwithstanding his Birth) appears to me a very modest, civil Lad, and I should be sorry that he should do himself any Injury in Squire Allworthy's Opinion.'  'Poogh! says the Squire, 'Injury with Allworthy! Why Allworthy loves a Wench himself. Does not all the Country know whose Son Tom is? You must talk to another Person in that Manner. I remember Allworthy at College.'  'I thought,' said the Parson, 'he had never been at the University.'  'Yes, yes, he was,' says the Squire, 'and many a Wench have we two had together. As errant a Whoremaster as any within five Miles o'un. No, no. It will do'n no Harm with he, assure yourself, or with any Body else. Ask Sophy there -- You have not the worse Opinion of a young Fellow for getting a Bastard, have you, Girl? No, no, the Women will like un the better for it.'  This was a cruel Question to poor Sophia. She had observed Tom's Color change at the Parson's Story; and that, with his hasty and abrupt Departure, gave her sufficient Reason to think her Father's Suspicion not groundless. Her Heart now, at once, discovered the great Secret to her, which had been so long disclosing by little and little; and she found herself highly interested in this Matter. In such a Situation, her Father's malapert Question rushing suddenly upon her, produced some Symptoms which might have alarmed a Suspicious Heart; but to do the Squire Justice, that was not his Fault. When she rose therefore from her Chair, and told him, a Hint from him was always sufficient to make her withdraw, he suffered her to leave the Room; and then with great Gravity of Countenance remarked, 'that it was better to see a Daughter over-modest, than over forward;' a Sentiment which was highly applauded by the Parson.  There now ensued between the Squire and the Parson, a most excellent political Discourse, framed out of Newspapers, and political Pamphlets,; in which they made a Libation of four Bottles of Wine to the Good of their Country; and then, the Squire being fast asleep, the Parson lighted his Pipe, mounted his Horse, and rode home.  When the Squire had finished his Half-hour's Nap, he summoned his Daughter to her Harpsichord; but she begged to be excused that Evening, on Account of a violent Headache. This Remission was presently granted: For indeed she seldom had Occasion to ask him twice, as he loved her with such ardent Affection, that by gratifying her, he commonly conveyed the highest Gratification to himself. She was really what he frequently called her, his little Darling; and she well deserved to be so: For she returned all his Affection in the most ample Manner. She had preserved the most inviolable Duty to him in all Things; and this her Love made not only easy, but so delightful, that when one of her Companions laughed at her for placing so much Merit in such scrupulous Obedience, as that young Lady called it, Sophia answered, 'You mistake me, Madam, if you think I value myself upon this Account: For besides that I am barely discharging my Duty, I am likewise pleasing myself. I can truly say, I have no Delight equal to that of contributing to my Father's Happiness; and if I value myself, my Dear, it is on having this Power, and not on executing it.'  This was a Satisfaction, however, which poor Sophia was incapable of tasting this Evening. She therefore not only desired to be excused from the Attendance at the Harpsichord, but likewise begged that he would suffer her to absent herself from Supper. To this Request likewise the Squire agreed, though not without some Reluctance; for he scarce ever permitted her to be out of his Sight, unless when he was engaged, with his Horses, Dogs, or Bottle. Nevertheless he yielded to the Desire of his Daughter, though the poor Man was, at the same Time, obliged to avoid his own Company, (if I may so express myself) by sending for a neighboring Farmer to sit with him.  CHAP. XI. The narrow escape of Molly Seagrim, with some Observations for which we have been forced to dive pretty deep into Nature.  TOM JONES had ridden one of Mr. Western's Horses that Morning in the Chase: so that having no Horse of his own in the Squire's Stable, he was obliged to go home on Foot. This he did so expeditiously; that he ran upwards of three Miles within the half Hour.  Just as he arrived at Mr. Allworthy's outward Gate, he met the Constable and Company, with Molly in their Possession, whom they were conducting to that House where the inferior Sort of People may learn one good Lesson, viz. Respect and Deference to their Superiors. Since it must show them the wide Distinction Fortune intends between those Persons who are to be corrected for their Faults, and those who are not; which Lesson, if they do not learn, I am afraid, they very rarely learn any other good Lesson, or improve their Morals, at the House of Correction.  A Lawyer may, perhaps, think Mr. Allworthy exceeded his Authority a little in this Instance. And, to say the Truth, I question, as here was no regular Information before him, whether his Conduct was strictly regular. However, as his Intention was truly upright, he ought to be excused in Foro Conscientiae, since so many arbitrary Acts are daily committed by Magistrates, who have not this Excuse to plead for themselves.  Tom was no sooner informed by the Constable, whither they were proceeding, (indeed he pretty well guessed it of himself) than he caught Molly in his Arms, and embracing her tenderly before them all, swore he would murder the first Man who offered to lay hold of her. He bid her dry her Eyes, and be comforted; for wherever she went, he would accompany her. Then turning to the Constable, who stood trembling with his Hat off, he desired him, in a very mild Voice, to return with him for a Moment only to his Father, (so he now called Allworthy) for he durst, he said, be assured, that when he had alleged what he had to say in her Favor, the Girl would be discharged.  The Constable, who, I make no Doubt, would have surrendered his Prisoner, had Tom demanded her, very readily consented to this Request. So back they all went into Mr. Allworthy's Hall; where Tom desired them to stay till his Return, and then went himself in pursuit of the Good Man. As soon as he was found, Tom threw himself at his Feet, and having begged a patient hearing, confessed himself to be the Father of the Child, of which Molly was then big. He entreated him to have Compassion on the poor Girl, and to consider, if there was any Guilt in the case, it lay principally at his Door.  'If there is any Guilt in the Case!' answered Allworthy warmly, 'are you then so profligate and so abandoned a Libertine, to doubt whether the breaking the Laws of God and Man, the corrupting and ruining a poor Girl, by Guilt? I own, indeed, it does lie principally upon you, and so heavy it is, that you ought to expect it should crush you.'  'Whatever may be my Fate, says Tom, let me succeed in my Intercessions for the poor Girl. I consess I have corrupted her; but whether she shall be ruined depends on you. For Heaven's Sake, Sir, revoke your Warrant, and do not send her to a Place which must unavoidably prove her Destruction.'  Allworthy bid him immediately call a Servant. Tom answered, there was no Occasion; for he had luckily met them at the Gate, and relying upon his Goodness, had brought them back into his Hall, where they now waited his final Resolution, which, upon his Knees, he besought him might be in Favor of the Girl; that she might be permitted to go home to her Parents, and not be exposed to a greater Degree of Shame and Scorn than must necessarily fall upon her. 'I know, said he, that is too much, I know I am the wicked Occasion of it. I will endeavor to make amends, if possible; and if you shall have hereafter the Goodness to forgive me, I hope I shall deserve it.'  Allworthy hesitated some Time, and at last said, 'Well, I will discharge my Mittimus. -- You may send the Constable to me.' He was instantly called, discharged, and so was the Girl.  It will be believed, that Mr. Allworthy failed not to read Tom a very severe Lecture on this Occasion; but it is unnecessary to insert it here, as we have faithfully transcribed what he said to Jenny Jones in the first Book, most of which may be applied to the Men, equally with the Women. So sensible an Effect had these Reproofs on the young Man, who is no hardened Sinner, that he retired into his own Room, where he passed the Evening alone in much melancholy contemplation.  Allworthy was sufficiently offended by this Transgression of Jones; for notwithstanding the Assertions of Mr. Western, it is certain this worthy Man had never indulged himself in any loose Pleasures with Women, and greatly condemned the Vice of Incontinence in others. Indeed, there is much Reason to imagine, that there was not the least Truth in what Mr. Western affirmed, especially as he laid the Scene of those Impurities at the University, where Mr. Allworthy had never been. In fact, the good Squire was a little too apt to indulge that Kind of Pleasanty which is generally called Rhodomontade; but which may, with as much Propriety, be expressed by a much shorter Word; and, perhaps, we too often supply the Use of this little Monosyllable by others; since very much of what frequently passes in the World for Wit and Humor, should, in the strictest Purity of Language, receive that short Appellation, which, in Conformity to the well-bred Laws of Custom, I here suppress.  But whatever Detestation Mr. Allworthy had to this or to any other Vice, he was not so blinded by it, but that he could discern any Virtue in the guilty Person, as clearly indeed, as if there had been no Mixture of Vice in the same Character. While he was angry therefore, with the Incontinence of Jones, he was no less pleased with the Honor and Honesty of his Self-accusation. He began now to form in his Mind the same Opinion of this young Fellow which we hope our Reader may have conceived. And in ballancing his Faults with his Perfections, the latter seemed rather to preponderate.  It was to no Purpose, therefore, that Thwackum, who was immediately charged by Mr. Blifl with the Story, unbended all his Rancour against poor Tom. Allworthy gave a patient Hearing to these Invectives, and then answered coldly: 'That young Men of Tom's Complexion were too generally addicted to this Vice; but he believed that Youth was sincerely affected with what he had said to him on the Occasion, and he hoped he would not transgress again.' So that, as the Days of whipping were at an End, the Tutor had no other Vent but his own Mouth for his Gall, the usual poor Resource of impotent Revenge.  But Square, who was a less violent, was a much more artful Man; and as he hated Jones more, perhaps, than Thwackum himself, so he contrived to do him more Mischief in the Mind of Mr. Allworthy.  The Reader must remember the several little Incidents of the Partridge, the Horse, and the Bible, which were recounted in the second Book. By all which Jones had rather improved than injured the Affection which Mr. Allworthy was inclined to entertain for him. The same, I believe, must have happened to him with every other Person who has any Idea of Friendship, Generosity, and Greatness of Spirit; that is to say, who has any Traces of Goodness in his Mind.  Square himself was not unacquainted with the true Impression which those several Instances of Goodness had made on the excellent Heart of Allworthy; for the Philosopher very well knew what Virtue was, though he was not always, perhaps, steady in its Pursuit; but as for Thwackum, from what Reason I will not determine, no such Thoughts ever entered into his Head. He saw Jones in a bad Light, and he imagined Allworthy saw him in the same, but that he was resolved, from Pride and Stubbornness of Spirit, not to give up the Boy whom he had once cherished, since, by so doing, he must tacitly acknowledge that his former Opinion of him had been wrong.  Square therefore embraced this Opportunity of injuring Jones in the tenderest Part, by giving a very bad Turn to all these beforementioned Occurrences.  'I am sorry, Sir, said he, 'to own I have been deceived as well as yourself. I could not, I confess, help being pleased with what I ascribed to the Motive of Friendship, though it was carried to an Excess, and all Excess is faulty, and vicious; but in this I made Allowance for Youth. Little did I suspect that the Sacrifice of Truth, which we both imagined to have been made to Friendship, was, in reality, a Prostitution of it to a depraved and debauched Appetite. You now plainly see whence all the seeming Generosity of this young Man to the Family of the Game-keeper proceeded. He supported the Father in order to corrupt the Daughter, and preserved the Family from starving, to bring one of them to Shame and Ruin. This is Friendship! this is Generosity! As Sir Richard Steel says, Gluttons who give high Prices for Delicacies, are very worthy to be called generous. In short, I am resolved, from this Instance, never to give Way to the Weakness of Human Nature more, nor to think any thing Virtue which does not exactly quadrate with the unerring Rule of Right.'  The Goodness of Allworthy had prevented those Considerations from occurring to himself; yet were they too plausible to be absolutely and hastily rejected, when laid before his Eyes by another. Indeed what Square had said sunk very deeply into his Mind, and the Uneasiness which it there created was very visible to the other; though the good Man would not acknowledge this, but made a very slight Answer, and forcibly drove off the Discourse to some other Subject. It was well, perhaps, for poor Tom, that no such Suggestions had been made before he was pardoned; for they certainly stamped in the Mind of Allworthy the first bad Impression concerning Jones.  CHAP. XII. Containing much clearer Matters; but which flow from the same Fountain with those in the preceding Chapter.  THE Reader will be pleased, I believe, to return with me to Sophia. She passed the Night, after we saw her last, in no very agreeable Manner. Sleep befriended her but little, and Dreams less. In the Morning, when Mrs. Honor her Maid attended her, at the usual Hour, she was found already up and dressed.  Persons who live two or three Miles Distance in the Country are considered as next Door Neighbors, and Transactions at the one House fly with incredible Celerity to the other. Mrs. Honor, therefore, had heard the whole Story of Molly's Shame; which she, being of a very communicative Temper, had no sooner entered the Apartment of her Mistress, than she began to relate in the following Manner.  'La Ma'am, what does your La'ship think? the Girl that your La'ship saw at Church on Sunday, whom you thought so handsome; though you would not have thought her so handsome neither, if you had seen her nearer; but to be sure she has been carried before the Justice for being big with Child. She seemed to me to look like a confident Slut; and to be sure she has laid the Child to young Mr. Jones. And all the Parish says Mr. Allworthy is so angry with young Mr. Jones, that he will not see him. To be sure, one cannot help pitying the poor young Man, and yet he does not deserve much Pity neither, for demeaning himself with such Kind of Trumpery. Yet he is so pretty a Gentleman I should be sorry to have him turned out of Doors. I dares to swear the Wench was as willing as he; for she was always a forward Kind of Body. And when Wenches are so coming, young Men are not so much to be blamed neither; for to be sure they do no more than what is natural. Indeed it is beneath them to meddle with such dirty Draggle-tails, and whatever happens to them, it is good enough for them. And yet to be sure the vile Baggages are most in Fault. I wishes, with all my Heart, they were well to be whipped the Cart's Tail; for it is Pity they should be the Ruin of a pretty young Gentleman; and no body can deny but that Mr. Jones is one of the most handsomest young Men that ever -- '  She was running on thus, when Sophia, with a more peevish Voice than she had ever spoken to her in before, cried, 'Prithee why do thou trouble me with all this Stuff? What Concern have I in what Mr. Jones does? I suppose you are all alike. And you seem to me to be angry it was not your own Case.'  'I, Ma'am!' answered Mrs. Honor, I am sorry your Ladyship should have such an Opinion of me. I am sure nobody can say any such thing of me. All the young Fellows in the World may go to the Divil, for me. Because I said he was a handsome Man! Every body says it as well as I -- To be sure, I never thought as it was any Harm to say a young Man was handsome; but to be sure I shall never think him so any more now; for handsome is that' handsome does. A Beggar Wench! -- '  'Stop thy Torrent of Impertinence, 'cries Sophia, and see whether my Father wants me at Breakfast.'  Mrs. Honor then flung out of the Room, muttering much to herself -- of which -- 'Many come up, I assure you,' was all that could be plainly distinguished.  Whether Mrs. Honor really deserved that Suspicion, of which her Mistress gave her a Hint, is a Matter which we cannot in dulge our Reader's Curiosity by resolving. We will however make him amends, in disclosing what passed in the Mind of Sophia.  The Reader will be pleased to recollect, that a secret Affection for Mr. Jones had insensibly stolen into the Bosom of this young Lady. That it had there grown to a pretty great Height before she herself had discovered it. When she first began to perceive is Symptoms, the Sensations were so sweet and pleasing, that she had not Resolution sufficient to check or repel them; and thus she went on cherishing a Passion of which she never once considered the Consequences.  This Incident relating to Molly, first opened her Eyes. She now first perceived the Weakness of which she had been guilty; and though it caused the utmost Perturbation in her Mind, yet it had the Effect of other nauseous Physic, and for the Time expelled her Distemper. Its Operation indeed was most wonderfully quick; and in the short Interval, while her Maid was absent, so entirely removed all Symptoms, that when Mrs. Honor returned with a Summons from her Father, she was become perfectly easy, and had brought herself to a thorough Indifference for Mr. Jones.  The Diseases of the Mind do in almost every Particular imitate those of the Body. For which Reason, we hope, That learned Faculty, for whom we have so profound a Respect, will pardon us the violent Hands we have been necessitated to lay on several Words and Phrases, which of Right belong to them, and without which our Descriptions must have been often unintelligible.  Now there is no one Circumstance in which the Distempers of the Mind bear a more exact Analogy to those which are called Bodily, than that Aptness which both have to a Relapse. This is plain, in the violent Diseases of Ambition and Avarice. I have known Ambition, when cured at Court by frequent Disappointments, (which are the only Physic for it, to break out again in a Contest of Foreman of the Grand Jury at an Assizes; and have heard of a Man who had so far conquered Avarice, as to give away many a Sixpence, that comforted himself, at last, on his Deathbed, by making a crafty and advantageous Bargain concerning his ensuing Funeral, with an Undertaker who had married his only Child.  In the Affair of Love, which out of strict Conformity with the Stoic Philosophy, we shall here treat as a Disease, this Proneness to relapse is no less conspicuous. Thus it happened to poor Sophia; upon whom, the very next Time she saw young Jones, all the former Symptoms returned, and from that Time cold and hot Fits alternately seized her Heart.  The Situation of this young Lady was very different from what it had ever been before. That Passion, which had formerly been so exquisitely delicious, became now a Scorpion in her Bosom. She resisted it therefore with her utmost Force, and summoned every Argument her Reason (which was surprizingly strong for her Age) could suggest, to subdue and expel it. In this she so far succeeded, that she began to hope from Time and Absence a perfect Cure. She resolved therefore to avoid Tom Jones, as much as possible; for which Purpose she began to conceive a Design of visiting her Aunt, to which she made no Doubt of obtaining her Father's Consent.  But Fortune who had other Designs in her Head, put an immediate Stop to any such Proceeding, by introducing an Accident, which will be related in the next Chapter.  CHAP. XIII. A dreadful Accident which befell Sophia. The gallant Behavior of Jones, and the more dreadful Consequence of that Behavior to the young Lady; with a short Digression in Favor of the Female Sex.  MR. Western grew every Day fonder and fonder of Sophia, insomuch that his beloved Dogs themselves almost gave Place to her in his Affections; but as he could not prevail on himself to abandon these, he contrived very cunningly to enjoy their Company, together with that of his Daughter, by insisting on her riding a hunting with him.  Sophia, to whom her Father's Word was a Law, readily complied with his Desires, though she had not the least Delight in a Sport, which was of too rough and masculine a Nature to suit with her Disposition. She had, however, another Motive, beside her Obedience, to accompany the old Gentleman in the Chase; for by her Presence she hoped in some Measure to restrain his Impetuosity, and to prevent him from so frequently exposing his Neck to the utmost Hazard.  The strongest Objection was that which would have formerly been an Inducement to her, namely, the frequent Meeting with young Jones, whom she had determined to avoid; but as the End of the hunting Season now approached, she hoped, by a short Absence with her Aunt, to reason herself entirely out of her unfortunate Passion; and had not any Doubt of being able to meet him in the Field the subsequent Season without the least Danger.  On the second Day of her Hunting, as she was returning from the Chase, and was arrived within a little Distance from Mr. Western's House, her Horse, whose mettlesome Spirit required a better Rider, fell suddenly to prancing and capering, in such a Manner, that she was in the most imminent Peril of falling. Tom Jones, who was at a little Distance behind, saw this and immediately galloped up to her Assistance. As soon as he came up, he immediately leapt from his own Horse, and caught hold of here is by the Bridle. The unruly Beast presently reared himself an End on his hind Legs, and threw his Burden from his Back, and Jones caught her in his Arms.  She was so affected with the Fright, that she was not immediately able to satisfy Jones, who was very sollicitous to know whether she had received any Hurt. She soon after, however, recovered her Spirits, assured him she was safe, and thanked him for the Care he had taken of her. Jones answered, 'If I have preserved you, Madam, I am sufficiently repaid; for I promise you, I would have secured you from the least Harm, at the Expense of a much greater Misfortune to myself, than I have suffered on this Occasion.'  'What Misfortune,' replied Sophia, eagerly, 'I hope you have come to no Mischief?'  'Be not concerned, Madam,' answered Jones, 'Heaven be praised, you have escaped so well, considering the Danger you was in. If I have broke my Arm, I consider it as a Trifle, in Comparison of what I feared upon your Account.'  Sophia then screamed out, 'Broke your Arm! Heaven forbid.'  'I am afraid I have, Madam,' says Jones, 'but I beg you will suffer me first to take Care of you. I have a Right Hand yet at your Service, to help you into the next Field, where we have but a very little Walk to your Father's House.'  Sophia seeing his left Arm dangling by his Side, while he was using the other to lead her, no longer doubted of the Truth. She now grew much paler than her Fears for herself had made her before. All her Limbs were seized with a Trembling, insomuch that Jones could scarce support her; and as her Thoughts were in no less Agitation, she could not refrain from giving Jones a Look so full of Tenderness, that it almost argued a stronger Sensation in her Mind, than even Gratitude and Pity united can raise in the gentlest female Bosom, without the Assistance of a third more powerful Passion.  Mr. Western, who was advanced at some Distance when this Accident happened, was now returned, as were the rest of the Horsemen. Sophia immediately acquainted them with what had befallen Jones, and begged them to take Care of him. Upon which, Western, who had been much alarmed by meeting his Daughter's Horse without its Rider, and was now overjoyed to find her unhurt, cried out, 'I am glad it is no worse, if Tom has broken his Arm, we will get a Joiner to mend un again.'  The Squire alighted from his Horse, and proceeded to his House on Foot, with his Daughter and Jones. An impartial Spectator, who had met them on the Way, would, on viewing their several Countenances, have concluded Sophia alone to have been the Object of Compassion: For as to Jones, he exulted in having probably saved the Life of the young Lady, at the Price only of a broken Bone; and Mr. Western, though he was not unconcerned at the Accident which had befallen Jones, was however, delighted in a much higher Degree with the fortunate escape of his Daughter.  The Generosity of Sophia's Temper construed this Behavior of Jones into great Bravery; and it made a deep Impression on her Heart: For certain it is, that there is no one Quality which so generally recommends Men to Women as this; proceeding, if we believe the common Opinion, from that natural Timidity of the Sex; which is, says Mr. Osborne, so great,' that a Woman is the most cowardly of all 'the Creatures God ever made.' A Sentiment more remarkable for its Bluntness, than for its Truth. Aristotle, in his Politics, does them, I believe, more Justice, when he says, 'The Modesty and Fortitude of Men differ from those Virtues in Women; for the Fortitude which becomes a Woman, would be Cowardice in a Man; and the Modesty which becomes a Man, would be Pertness in a Woman.' Nor is there, perhaps, more of Truth in the Opinion of those who derive the Partiality which Women are inclined to show to the Brave, from this Excess of their Fear. Mr. Bail (I think, in his Article of Helen) imputes this, and with greater Probability, to their violent Love of Glory; for the Truth of which, we have the Authority of him, who, of all others, saw farthest into human Nature; and who introduces the Heroine of his Odyssey, the great Pattern of matrimonal Love and Constancy, assigning the glory of her Husband as the only Source of her Affections toward him. The English Reader will not find this in the Poem: For the Sentiment is entirely left out in the Translation.   However this be, certain it is that the Accident operated very strongly on Saphia; and, indeed, after much Enquiry into the Matter, I am inclined to believe, that at this very Time, the charming Sophia made no less Impression on the Heart of Jones; to say Truth, he had for some Time become sensible of the irrestible Power of her Charms.  CHAP. XIV. The Arrival of a Surgeon. His Operations, and a long Dialogue between Sophia and her Maid.  WHEN they arrived in Mr. Western's Hall, Sophia, who had tottered along with much Difficulty, sunk down in a Chair; but by the Assistance of Hartshorn and Water, she was prevented from fainting away, and had pretty well recovered her Spirits, when the Surgeon, who was sent for to Jones, appeared. Mr. Western, who imputed these Symptoms in his Daughter to her Fall, advised her to be ^resently blooded by way of Prevention. In this Opinion he was seconded by the Surgeon, who gave ^o many Reasons for bleeding, and quoted so many Cases where Persons had miscarried for want of it, that the Squire became very importunate, and indeed ^nsisted peremtorily that his Daughter should be blooded.  Sophia soon yielded to the Commands of her Father, though entirely contrary to her own Inclinations: For she suspected, I believe, less Danger from the Fright, than either the Squire or the Surgeon. She ^hen stretched out her beautiful Arm, and the Operator began to prepare for his Work.  While the Servants were busied in providing Materials; the Surgeon, who imputed the Backwardness which had appeared in Sophia to her Fears, began to comfort her with Assurances that there was not the ^east Danger; for no Accident, he said, could ever happen in Bleeding, but from the monstrous Ignorance of Pretenders to Surgery, which he pretty plainly insinuated was not at present to be apprehended. Sophia declared she was not under the least Apprehension; adding, if you open an Artery, I promise you I Will forgive you; 'Will you,' cries Western, 'D -- n me, if I will; if he does the least Mischief, d -- n me, if I don't have the Heart's Blood o'un out.' The Surgeon assented to bleed her upon these Conditions, and then proceeded to his Operation, which he performed with as much Dexterity as he had promised; and as much Quickness: For he took but little Blood from her, saying, it was much safer to bleed again and again, than to take away too much at once.  Sophia, when her Arm was bound up, retired: For she was not willing (nor was it, perhaps, strictly decent) to be present at the Operation on Jones. Indeed one Objection which she had to Bleeding, (tho she did not make it) was the Delay which it would occasion to dressing the broken Bone. For Western, when Sophia was concerned, had no Consideration but for her; and as for Jones himself, he 'sat like Patience on a Monument smiling at Grief.' T^ say the Truth, when he saw the Blood springing from the lovely Arm of Sophia, he scarce thought of what had happened to himself.  The Surgeon now ordered his Patient to be stripped t^ his Shirt, and then entirely baring the Arm, he began to stretch and examine it, in such a Manner, that the Tortures he put him to, caused Jones to make several wry Faces; which the Surgeon observing, great wondered at, crying, 'What is the Matter, Sir? am sure it is impossible I should hurt you.' And the holding forth the broken Arm, he began a long and very learned Lecture of Anatomy, in which simpl^ and double Fractures were most accurately considered and the several Ways in which Jones might have broken his Arm were discussed, with proper Annotation^ showing how many of these would have been better and how many worse than the present Case.  Having at length finished his labored Harangu^ with which the Audience, though it had greatly raise^ their Attention and Admiration, were not much edified, as they really understood not a single Syllable o^ all he had said, he proceeded to Business, which h^ was more expeditious in finishing, than he had been in beginning.  Jones was then ordered into a Bed, which Mr. Western compelled him to accept at his own House and Sentence of Water Gruel was passed upon him.  Among the good Company which had attende^ in the Hall during the Bone-setting, Mrs. Honor w^^ one; who being summoned to her Mistress as soo^ as it was over, and asked by her how the young Gentleman did, presently launched into extravagant Praise on the Magnimity, as she called it, of his Behavior, which, she said, 'was so charming in so pretty a 'Creature.' She then burst forth into much warmer Encomiums on the Beauty of his Person; enumerating many Particulars, and ending with the Whiteness of his Skin.  This Discourse had an Effect on Sophia's Countenance, which would not perhaps have escaped the Observance of the sagacious Waiting Woman, had she once looked her Mistress in the Face, all the Time she was speaking; but as a Looking-glass, which was most commodiously placed opposite to her, gave her an Opportunity of surveying those Features, in which, of all others, she took most Delight, so she had not once removed her Eyes from that amiable Object during her whole Speech.  Mrs. Honor was so entirely wrapped up in the Subject on which she exercised her Tongue, and the Object before her Eyes, that she gave her Mistress Time to conquer her Confusion; which having done, she smiled on her Maid, and told her, 'She was certainly in Love with this young Fellow.' 'I in Love,' Madam! answers she, 'upon my Word, Ma'am, I assure you, Ma'am, upon my Soul, Ma'am, I am not.' 'Why if you was,' cries her Mistress, 'I see no Reason that you should be ashamed of it; for he is certainly a pretty Fellow -- Yes, Ma'am, answered the other 'That he is, the most handsomest Man I ever saw in my Life. Yes, to be sure, that he is, and, as your Ladyship says, I don't know why I should be ashamed of loving him, though he is my Betters. To be sure gentle Folks are but Flesh and Blood no more than us Servants. Besides, as for Mr. Jones, though Squire Allworthy has made a Gentleman of him, he was not so good as myself by Birth: thof I am a poor Body, I am an honest Person's Child, and my Father and Mother were married, which is more than some People can say, as high as they hold their Heads. Marry, come up! I assure you, my dirty Cousin! thof his Skin be so white, and to be sure, it is the most whitest that ever was seen, I am a Christian as well as he, and nobody can say tha^ I am base born, my grandfather was a Clergy man This is the second Person of low Condition who we have recorded in this History, to have sprung from t^ Clergy. It is to be hoped such Instances will, in futu^^ Ages, when some Provision is made for the Families ^^ the inferior Clergy, appear stranger than they can ^^ thought at present, , and would have been very angry, I believe to have thought any of his Family should have taken up with Molly Seagrim's dirty Leavings.'  Perhaps Sophia might have suffered her Maid to ru^ on in this Manner, from wanting sufficient Spirits t^ stop her Tongue, which the Reader may probably conjecture was no very easy Task: For, certain^^ there were some Passages in her Speech, which were far from being agreeable to the Lady. However she now checked the Torrent, as there seemed n^ End of its Flowing. 'I wonder,' says she, 'a^ your Assurance in daring to talk thus of one of m^ Father's Friends. As to the Wench, I order yo^ never to mention her Name to me. And, wit^ Regard to the young Gentleman's Birth, those wh^ can say nothing more to his Disadvantage, may a^ well be silent on that Head, as I desire you will b^ for the future.'  'I am sorry, I have offended your Ladyship,' answered Mrs. Honor, 'I am sure I hate Molly Seagrim as much as your Ladyship can, and as for a busing 'Squire Jones, I can call all the Servants ^^ the House to witness, that whenever any Talk ha^ been about Bastards, I have always taken his Part For which of you,' says I to the Footmen, 'wou^^ not be a Bastard, if he could, to be made a Gentleman of? and,' says I, 'I am sure he is a very fine Gentleman; and he has one of the whitest Hands in the World: For to be sure so he has;' and' says 'one of the sweetest temperedest, best naturedest Men in the World he is,' and says I, 'all the Servants and Neighbors all round the Country loves him. And, to be sure, I could tell your Ladyship something, but that I am afraid it would offend you.' -- 'What could you tell me, Honor,' says Sophia. 'Nay, Ma'am, to sure he meant nothing by it, therefore I would not have your Ladyship be offended.' -- 'Prithee tell me,' says Sophia, -- 'I will know it this Instant.' Why Ma'am,' answered Mrs. Honor, 'he came into the Room, one Day last Week when I was at Work, and there lay your Ladyship's Muff on a Chair, and to be sure he put his Hands into it, that very Muff your Ladyship gave me but yesterday; La,' says I, Mr. Jones, you will stretch my Lady's Muff and spoil it; but he still kept his Hands in it, and then he kissed it -- to be sure, I hardly ever saw such a Kiss in my Life as he gave it.' -- 'I suppose he did not know it was mine,' replied Sophia. 'Your Ladyship shall hear, Ma'am. He kissed it again and again, and said it was the prettiest Muff in the World.' La! Sir,' says I, 'you have seen it a hundred Times,' -- Yes, Mrs. Honor,' cried he; 'but who can see any thing beautiful in the Presence of your Lady but herself: Nay, that is not all neither, but I hope your Ladyship will not be offended, for to be sure he meant nothing: One Day as your Ladyship was playing on the Harpsicord to my Master, Mr. Jones was sitting in the next Room, and methought he looked melancholy. La!' says I, 'Mr. Jones, what is the Matter? A Penny for your Thoughts,' says I, 'Why, Hussy,' says he, starting up from a Dream, 'what can I be thinking of when that Angel your Mistress is playing?' And then squeezing me by the Hand -- 'Oh! Mrs. Honor,' says he, how happy will that Man be!' -- and then he sighed; upon my Troth, his Breath is as sweet as a Nosegay -- but to be sure he meant no Harm by it. So I hope your Ladyship will not mention a Word: For he gave me a Crown never to mention it, and made me swear upon a Book, but I believe, indeed, it was not the Bible.'  Till something of a more beautiful Red than Vermilion be found out, I shall say nothing of Sophia's Color on this Occasion. 'Ho -- nour,' says she, 'I -- if you will not mention this any more to me, nor to any Body else, I will not betray you -- I mean I will not be angry; but I am afraid of your Tongue. Why, my Girl, will you give it such Liberties?' Nay, Ma'am,' answered she, to be sure I would sooner cut out my Tongue than offend your Ladyship -- to be sure, I shall never mention a Word that your Ladyship would not have me.' -- Why I would not have you mention this any more,' said Sophia, 'for it may come to my Father's Ears, and he would be angry with Mr. Jones, though I really believe, as you say, he meant nothing. I should be very angry myself if I imagined' -- 'Nay, Ma'am,' says Honor, 'I protest I believe he meant nothing. I thought he talked as if he was out of his Senses; nay, he said he believed he was beside himself when he had spoken the Words.' Ay, Sir, says I, 'I believe so too.' Yes, says he, 'Honour, -- but I ask your Ladyship's Pardon; I could tear my Tongue out for offending you.' 'Go on,' says Sophia, 'you may mention any Thing you have not told me before.' 'Yes, Honor,' says he; (this was some time afterward when he gave me the Crown) 'I am neither such a coxcomb, or such a Villain as to think of her, in any other Delight, but as my Goddess; as such I will always worship and adore her while I have Breath. This was all, Ma'am, I will be sworn, to the best of my Remembrance; I was in a Passion with him, myself, till I found he meant no Harm. Indeed, Honor, says Sophia, I believe you have a real Affection for me; I was provoked the other Day when I gave you Warning, but if you have a Desire to stay with me, you shall. To be sure, Ma'am, answered Mrs. Honor, I shall never desire to part with your Ladyship.' To be sure, I almost cried my Eyes out when you gave me Warning. It would be very ungrateful in me, to desire to leave your Ladyship; because as why, I should never get so good a Place again. I am sure I would live and die with your Ladyship -- for, as poor Mr. Jones said, happy is the Man --  Here the Dinner-bell interrupted a Conversation which had wrought such an Effect on Sophia, that she was, perhaps, more obliged to her bleeding in the Morning, than she, at the time, had apprehended she should be. As to the present Situation of her Mind, I shall adhere to a Rule of Horace, by not attempting to describe it, from despair of Success. Most of my Readers will suggest it easily to themselves, and the few who cannot, would not understand the Picture, or at least would deny it to be natural, if ever so well drawn.  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING. BOOK V. Containing a short Portion of Time, somewhat longer than Half a Year.  CHAP. I. Of THE SERIOUS in writing; and for what Purpose it is introduced.  PEradventure there may be no Parts in this prodigious Work which will give the Reader less Pleasure in the perusing, than those which have given the Author the greatest Pains in composing. Among these probably may be reckoned those initial Essays which we have perfixed to the historical Matter contained in every Book; and which we have determined to be essentially necessary to this kind of Writing, of which we have set ourselves at the Head.  For this our Determination we do not hold ourselves strictly bound to assign any Reason; it being abundantly sufficient that we have laid it down as a Rule necessary to be observed in all Prosai-comi-epic Writing. Who ever demanded the Reasons of that nice Unity of Time or Place which is now established to be so essential to dramatick Poetry? What Critic has been ever asked why a Play may not contain two Days as well as one, or why the Audience (provided they travel like Electors, without any Expense) may not be wafted Fifty Miles as well as five! Has any Commentator well accounted for the Limitation which an ancient Critic had set to the Drama, which he will have contain neither more nor less than five Acts; or has any one living attempted to explain, what the modern Judges of our Theaters mean by that Word low; by which they have happily succeeded in banishing all Humor from the Stage, and have made the Theater as dull as a Drawing Room? Upon all these Occasions, the World seemed to have embraced a Maxim of our Law, viz. Cuicunque in Art sua perito credendum est: For it seems, perhaps, difficult to conceive that any one should have enough of Impudence, to lay down dogmatical Rules in any Art or Science without the least Foundation. In such Cases, therefore, we are apt to conclude there are sound and good Reasons at the Bottom, though we are unfortunately not able to see so far.  Now, in Reality, the World have paid too great a Compliment to Critics, and have imagined them Men of much greater Profundity than they really are. From this Complaisance, the Critics have been emboldened to assume a Dictatorial Power, and have so far succeeded that they are now become the Masters, and have the Assurance to give Laws to those Authors, from whose Predecessors they originally received them.  The Critrc, rightly considered, is no more than the Clerk, whose Office is to transcribe the Rules and Laws laid down by those great Judges, whose vast Strength of Genius has placed them in the Light of Legislators in the several Sciences over which they presided. This Office was all which the Critics of old aspired to, nor did they ever dare to advance a Sentence, without supporting it by the Authority of the Judge from whence it was borrowed.  But in Process of Time, and in Ages of Ignorance, the Clerk began to invade the Power and assume the Dignity of his Master. The Laws of Writing were no longer founded on the Practice of the Author, but on the Dictates of the Critic. The Clerk became the Legislator, and those very peremptorily gave Laws, whose Business it was, at first, only to transcribe them.  Hence arose an obvious, and, perhaps, an unavoidable Error: For these Critics being Men of shallow Capacities, very easily mistook mere Form for Substance. They acted as a Judge would, who should adhere to the lifeless Letter of Law, and reject the Spirit. Little Circumstances which were, perhaps, accidental in a great Author, were, by these Critics, considered to constitute his chief Merit, and transmitted as Essentials to be observed by all his Successors. To these Encroachments, Time and Ignorance, the two great Supporters of Imposture, gave Authority; and thus, many Rules for good Writing have been established, which have not the least Foundation in Truth or Nature; and which commonly serve for no other Purpose than to crub and restrain Genius, in the same Manner; as it would have restrained the Dancing Master, had the many excellent Treatises on that Art, laid it down as an essential Rule, that every Man must dance in Chains.  To avoid, therefore, all Imputation of laying down a Rule for Posterity, founded only on the Authority of ipse dixit; for which, to say the Truth, we have not the profoundest Veneration; we shall here wave the Privilege above contended for, and proceed to lay before the Reader, the Reasons which have induced us, to intersperse these several digressive Essays, in the Course of this Work.  And here we shall of Necessity be led to open a new Vein of Knowledge, which, if it has been discovered, has not, to our Rememberance, been wrought on by any ancient or modern Writer. This Vein is no other than that of Contrast, which runs through all the Works of the Creation, and may probably have a large Share in constituting in us the Idea of all Beauty, as well natural as artificial: For what demonstrates the Beauty and Excellence of any thing, but its Reverse? Thus the Beauty of Day, and that of Summer, is set off by the Horrors of Night and Winter. And I believe, if it was possible for a Man to have seen only the two former, he would have a very imperfect Idea of their Beauty.  But to avoid too serious an Air: Can it be doubted, but that the finest Woman in the World would lose all Benefit of her Charms, in the Eye of a Man who had never seen one of another Cast? The Ladies themselves seem so sensible of this, that they are all industrious to procure Foils; nay, they will become Foils to themselves; for I have observed, (at Bath particularly,) that they endeavor to appear as ugly as possible in the Morning, in order to set off that Beauty which they intend to show you in the Evening.  Most Artists have this Secret in Practice, though some, perhaps, have not much studied the Theory. The Jeweller knows that the finest Brilliant requires a Foil; and the Painter, by the Contrast of his Figures, often acquires great Applause.  A great Genius among us, will illustrate this Matter fully. I cannot, indeed, range him under any general Head of common Artists, as he has a Title to be placed among those  Inventas, qui vitam excoluere per Arts. Who by invented Arts have Life improved. I mean here the Inventor of that most exquisite Entertainment, called the English Pantomime.  This Entertainment consisted of two Parts, which the Inventor distinguished by the Names of the Serious and the Comic. The Serious exhibited a certain Number of Heathen Gods and Heroes, who were certainly the worst and dullest Company into which an Audience was ever introduced; and (which was a Secret known to few) were actually intended so to be, in order to contrast the Comic Part of the Entertainment, and to display the Tricks of Harlequin to the better Advantage.  This was, perhaps, no very civil Use of such Personages; but the Contrivance was nevertheless ingenious enough, and had its Effect. And this will now plainly appear, if instead of Serious and Comic, we supply the Words Duller and Dullest; for the Comic was certainly duller than any thing before shown on the Stage, and could only be set off by that superlative Degree of Dullness, which composed the Serious. So intolerably serious, indeed, were these Gods and Heroes, that Harlequin (though the English Gentleman of that Name is not at all related to the French Family, for he is of a much more serious Disposition) was always welcome on the Stage, as he relieved the Audience from worse Company.  Judicious Writers have always practiced this Art of Contrast, with great Success. I have been surprised that Horace should cavil at this Art in Homer; but indeed he contradicts himself in the very next Line.  Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus, Verum Operi longo fas est obripere Somnum. I grieve if ever great Homer chance to sleep, Yet Slumbers on long Works have right to creep. For we are not here to understand, as, perhaps, some have, that an Author actually falls asleep while he is writing. It is true that Readers are too apt to be so overtaken; but if the Work was as long as any of Oldmixon, the Author himself is too well entertained to be subject to the least Drowsiness. He is, as Mr. Pope observes,  Sleepless himself to give his Readers Sleep. To say the Truth, these soporific Parts are so many Scenes of Serious artfully interwoven, in order to contrast and set off the rest; and this is the true Meaning of a late facetious Writer, who told the Public, that whenever he was dull, they might be assured there was a Design in it.  In this Light then, or rather in this Darkness, I would have the Reader to consider these initial Essays. And after this Warning, if he shall be of Opinion, that he can find enough of Serious in other Parts of this history, he may pass over these, in which we profess to be laboriously dull, and begin the following Books, at the second Chapter.  CHAP. II. In which Mr. Jones receives many friendly Visits during his Confinement; with some fine Touches of the Passion of Love, scarce visible to the naked Eye.  TOM JONES had many Visitors during his Confinement, though some, perhaps, were not very agreeable to him. Mr. Allworthy saw him almost every Day; but though he pitied Tom's Sufferings, and greatly approved the gallant Behavior which had occasioned them, yet he thought this was a favorable Opportunity to bring him to a sober Sense of his indiscreet Conduct; and that wholesome Advice for that Purpose, could never be applied at a more proper Season than at the present; when the Mind was softened by Pain and Sickness, and alarmed by Danger; and when its Attention was unembarrassed with those turbulent Passions, which engage us in the Pursuit of Pleasure.  At all Seasons, therefore, when the good Man was alone with the Youth, especially when the latter was totally at Ease, he took Occasian to remind him of his former Miscarriages, but in the mildest and tenderest Manner, and only in order to introduce the Caution, which he prescribed for his future Behavior; 'on which alone, 'he assured him, 'would depend his own Felicity, and the Kindness which he might yet promise himself to receive at the Hands of his Father by Adoption unless he should hereafter forfeit his Good Opinion: For as to what had past,' he said, 'it should be all forgotten and forgiven. He, therefore, advised him to make a good Use of this Accident, that so in the End it might prove a Visitation for his own Good.'  Thwackum was likewise pretty assiduous in his Visits; and he too considered a sick Bed to be a convenient Scene for Lectures. His Style, however, was more severe than Mr. Allworthy's: He told his Pupil, 'that he ought to look on his broken Limb as a Judgment from Heaven on his Sins. That it would become him to be daily on his Knees, pouring forth Thanksgivings that he had broken his Arm only, and not his Neck; which latter,' he said, 'was very probably reserved for some future Occasion, and that perhaps, not very remote. For his Part,' he said, 'he had often wondered some Judgment had not overtaken him before; but it might be perceived by this, that divine Punishments, though slow, are always sure.' Hence likewise he advised him 'to foresee, with equal Certainty, the greater Evils which 'vere yet behind, and which were as sure as this, of overtaking him in his State of Reprobacy. These are,' said he, 'to be averted only by such a thorough and sincere Repentance, as is not to be expected or hoped for, from one so abandoned in his Youth, and whose Mind, I am afraid, is totally corrupted. It is my Duty, however, to exhort you to this Repentance, though I too well know all Exhortations will be vain and fruitless. But liberavi Animam meam. I can accuse my own Conscience of no Neglect; though it is, at the same time, with the utmost Concern, I see you traveling on to certain Misery in this World, and to as certain Damnation in the next.'  Square talked in a very different Strain, He said, 'such Accidents as a Broken Bone were below the Consideration of a wise Man. That it was abundantly sufficient to reconcile the Mind to any of these Mischances, to reflect that they are liable to befall the wisest of Mankind, and are undoubtedly for the Good of the whole.' He said, 'it was a mere Abuse of Words, to call those Things Evils in which there was no moral Unfitness; that Pain, which was the worst Consequence of such Accidents, was the most contemptible thing in the World;' with more of the like Sentences, extracted out of the Second Book of Tully's Tusculan Questions, and from the Great Lord Shaftesbury. In pronouncing these he was one Day so eager, that he unfortunately bit his Tongue; and in such a Manner, that it not only put an End to his Discourse, but created much Emotion in him, and caused him to mutter an Oath or two: But what was worst of all, this Accident gave Thwackum, who was present, and who held all such Doctrine to be heathenish and atheistical, an Opportunity to clap a Judgment on his Back. Now this was done with so malicious a Sneer, that it totally unhinged (if I my so say) the Temper of the Philosopher, which the Bite of his Tongue had somewhat ruffled; and he was so disabled from venting his Wrath at his Lips, he had possibly found a more violent Method of revenging himself, had not the Surgeon, who was then luckily in the Room, contrary to his own Interest, interposed, and preserved the Peace.  Mr. Blifil visited his Friend Jones but seldom, and never alone. This worthy young Man, however, professed much Regard for him, and as great Concern at his Misfortune; but cautiously avoided any Intimacy, lest, as he frequently hinted, it might contaminate the Sobriety of his own Character: For which Purpose, he had constantly in his Month that Proverb in which Solomon speaks against Evil Communication. Not that he was so bitter as Thwackum for he always expressed some Hopes of Tom's Reformation; 'which,' he said, 'the unparallelled Goodness shown by his Uncle on this Occasion, must certainly effect, in one not absolutely abandoned;' but concluded, 'if Mr. Jones ever offends hereafter I shall not be able to say a Syllable in his Favor.'  As to Squire Western, he was seldom out of the Sick Room; unless when he was engaged either in the Field, or over his Bottle. Nay, he would sometimes retire hither to take his Beer, and it was not without Difficulty, that he was prevented from forcing Jones to take his Beer too: For no Quack ever held his Nostrum to be a more general Panacea, than he did this; which, he said, had more Virtues in it than was in all the Physic in an Apothecary's Shop. He was, however, by much Entreaty, prevailed on to forbear the Application of this Medicine; but from serenading his Patient every Morning with the Horn under his Window, it was impossible to withhold him; nor did he ever lay aside that Hollow, with which he entered into all Companies, when he visited Jones, without any Regard to the sick Person's being at that Time either awake or asleep.  This boisterous Behavior, as it meant no Harm, so happily it effected none, and was abundantly compensated to Jones, as soon as he was able to sit up, by the Company of Sophia, whom the Squire then brought to visit him; nor was it, indeed, long before Jones was able to attend her to the Harpsichord, where she would kindly condescend, for Hours together, to charm him with the most delicious Music, unless when the Squire thought proper to interrupt her, by insisting on Old Sir Simon, or some other of his favorite Pieces.  Notwithstanding the nicest Guard which Sophia endeavored to set on her Behavior, she could not avoid letting some Appearances now and then slip forth: For Love may again be likened to a Disease in this, that when it is denied a Vent in one Part, it will certainly break out in another. What her Lips therefore concealed, her Eyes, her Blushes, and many little involuntary Actions, betrayed.  One Day when Sophia was playing on the Harpsichord, and Jones was attending, the Squire came into the Room, crying, 'There Tom, I have had a Battle for thee below Stairs with thick Parson Thwackum. -- He has been telling Allworthy, before my Face, that the broken Bone was a Judgment upon thee. D -- n it, says I, how can that be? Did not he come by it in Defense of a young Woman? A Judgment indeed! Pox, if he never does any thing worse, he will go to Heaven sooner than all the Parsons in the Country. He has more reason to glory in it, than to be ashamed of it.' 'Indeed, Sir,' says Jones, 'I have no Reason for either; but if it preserved Miss Western, I shall always think it the happiest Accident of my Life.' -- And to gu,' said the Squire, 'to zet Allworthy against thee vor it. -- D -- n 'un, if the Parson had unt had his Petticuoats on, I should ha lent un a Flick; for I love thee dearly, my Boy, and d -- n me if if there is any thing in my Power which I will not do for thee. Shall take thy Choice of all the Horses in my Stable tomorrow Morning, except only the Chevalier and Miss Slouch.' Jones thanked him, but declined accepting the Offer. -- 'Nay,' added the Squire, 'Shat ha the sorrel Mare that Sophy rode. She cost me fifty Guineas, and comes six Years old this Grass.' If she had cost me a thousand,' cries Jones passionately, 'I would have given her to the 'Dogs,' Pooh! Pooh!' answered Western, 'what because she broke thy Arm. Should forget and forgive. I thought had been more a Man than to bear Malice against a dumb Creature.' -- Here Sophia interposed, and put an End to the Conversation, by desiring her Father's Leave to play to him; a Request which he never refused.  The Countenance of Sophia had undergone more than one Change during the foregoing Speeches; and probably she imputed the passionate Resentment which Jones had expressed against the Mare to a different Motive from that from which her Father had derived it. Her Spirits were at this Time in a visible Flutter; and she played so intolerably ill, that had not Western soon fallen asleep, he must have remarked it. Jones, however, who was sufficiently awake, and was not without an Ear any more than without Eyes, made some Observations; which being joined to all which the Reader may remember to have passed formerly, gave him pretty strong Assurances, when he came to reflect on the whole, that all was not well in the tender Bosom of Sophia. An Opinion which many young Gentlemen will, I doubt not, extremely wonder at his not having been well confirmed in long ago. To confess the Truth, he had rather too much Diffidence in himself, and was not forward enough in seeing the Advances of a young Lady; a Misfortune which can only be cured by that early Town Education, which is at present so generally in Fashion.  When these Thoughts had fully taken Possession of Jones, they occasioned a Perturbation in his Mind, which, in a Constitution less pure and firm than his, might have been, at such a Season, attended with very dangerous Consequences. He was truly sensible of the great Worth of Sophia. He extremely liked her Person, no less admired her Accomplishments, and tenderly loved her Goodness. In Reality, as he had never once entertained any Thought of possessing her, nor had ever given the least voluntary Indulgence ^o his Inclinations, he had a much stronger Passion for her than he himself was acquainted with. His Heart now brought forth the full Secret, at the same Time that it assured him the adorable Object returned his Affection.  CHAP. III. Which all, who have no Heart, will think to contain much ado about nothing.  THE Reader will perhaps imagine, the Sensations which now arose in Jones to have been so sweet and delicious, that they would rather tend to produce a cheerful Serenity in the Mind, than any of those dangerous Effects which we have mentioned; but in fact, Sensations of this Kind, however delicious, are, at their first Recognition, of a very tumultuous Nature, and have very little of the Opiate in them. They were, moreover, in the present Case, embittered with certain Circumstances, which being mixed with sweeter Ingredients, tended altogether to compose a Draught that might be termed bitter-sweet; than which, as nothing can be more disagreeable to the Palate, so nothing, in the metaphorical Sense, can be so injurious to the Mind.  For first, though he had sufficient foundation to flatter himself on what he had observed in Sophia, he was not yet free from Doubt of misconstruing Compassion, or at best, Esteem, into a warmer Regard. He was far from a sanguine Assurance that Sophia had any such Affection toward him, as might promise his Inclinations that Harvest, which, if they were encouraged and nursed, they would finally grow up to require. Besides, if he could hope to find no Bar to his Happiness from the Daughter, he thought himself certain of meeting an effectual Bar in the Father; who, though he was a Country Squire in his Diversions, was perfectly a Man of the World in whatever regarded his Fortune; had the most violent Affection for this only Daughter, and had often signified, in his Cups, the Pleasure he proposed in seeing her married to one of the richest Men in the County. Jones was not so vain and senseless a Coxcomb as to expect from any Regard which Western had professed for him, that he would ever be induced to lay aside these Views of advancing his Daughter. He well knew that Fortune is generally the principal if not the sole Consideration, which operates on the best of Parents in these Matters: For Friendship makes us warmly espouse the Interest of others; but is very cold to the Gratification of their Passions. Indeed, to feel the Happiness which may result from this, it is necessary we should possess the Passion ourselves. As he had therefore no Hopes of obtaining her Father's Consent, so he thought to endeavor to succeed without it, and by such Means to frustrate the Great Point of Mr. Western's Life, was to make a very ill Use of his Hospitality, and a very ungrateful Return to the many little Favors received (however roughly) at his Hands. If he saw such a Consequence with Horror and Disdain, how much more was he shocked with what regarded Mr. Allworthy; to whom as he had more than filial Obligations, so had he for him more than filial Piety. He knew the Nature of that good Man to be so averse to any Baseness o^ Treachery, that the least Attempt of such a Kind would make the guilty Person for ever odious to his Eyes, and the Name of that Person a detestable Sound in his Ears. The Appearance of such unsurmountable Difficulties was sufficient to have inspired him with Despair, however ardent his Wishes had been but even these were controlled by Compassion for another Woman. The Idea of lovely Molly now intruded itself before him. He had sworn eternal Constancy in her Arms, and she had as often vowed never to outlive his deserting her. He now saw her in all the most shocking Postures of Death; nay, he considered all the Miseries of Prostitution to which she would be liable, and of which he would be doubly the Occasion; first by seducing, and then by deserting her; for he well knew the Hatred which all her Neighbors, and even her own Sisters, bore her, and ready they would all be to tear her to Pieces. Indeed he had exposed her to more Envy than Shame, or rather to the latter by Means of the former: For many Women abused her for being a Whore, while they envied her her Lover and Finery, and would have been themselves glad to have purchased these at the same Rate. The Ruin, therefore, of the poor Girl must, he foresaw, unavoidably attend his deserting her; and this thought stung him to the Soul. Poverty and Distress seemed to him to give none a Right of aggravating those Misfortunes. The Meanness of her Condition did not represent her Misery as of little Consequence in his Eyes, nor did it appear to justify, or even to palliate, his Guilt, in bringing that Misery upon her. But why do I mention Justification; his own Heart would not suffer him to destroy a human Creature, who, he thought, loved him, and had to that Love sacrificed her Innocence. His own good Heart pleaded her Cause; not as a cold venal Advocate; but as one interested in the Event, and which must itself deeply share in all the Agonies its Owner brought on another.  When this cunning Advocate had sufficiently raised the Pity of Jones, by painting poor Molly in all the Circumstances of Wretchedness; it artfuly called in the Assistance of another Passion, and represented the Girl in all the amiable Colors of Youth, Health, and Beauty; as one greatly the Object of Desire, and much the more so, at least to a good Mind, from being, at the same time, the Object of Compassion.  A midst these Thoughts, poor Jones passed a long sleepless Night, and in the Morning the Result of the whole was to abide by Molly, and to think no more of Sophia.  In this virtuous Resolution he continued all the next Day till the Evening, cherishing the Idea of Molly, and driving Sophia from his Thoughts; but in the fatal Evening, a very trifling Accident set all his Passions again on Float, worked so total a Change in his Mind, that we think it decent to communicate it in a fresh Chapter.  CHAP. IV. A little Chapter, in which is contained a little Incident.  AMONG other Visitants, who paid their Compliments to the young Gentleman in his Confinement, Mrs. Honor was one. The Reader, perhaps, when he reflects on some Expressions which have formerly dropped from her, may conceive that she herself had a very particular Affection for Mr. Jones; but, in reality, it was no such thing. Tom was a handsome young Fellow; and for that Species of Men Mrs. Honor had some Regard; but this was perfectly indiscriminate: For having been crossed in the Love which she bore a certain Nobleman's Footman, who had basely deserted her after a Promise of Marriage, she had so securely kept together the broken Remains of her Heart, that no Man had ever since been able to possess himself of any single Fragment. She viewed all handsome Men with that equal Regard and Benevolence, which a sober and virtuous Mind bears to all the Good. -- She might, indeed, be called a Lover of Men, as Socrates was a Lover of Mankind, preferring one to another for corporeal, as he for mental Qualifications; but never carrying this Preference so far as to cause any Perturbation in the philosophical Serenity of her Temper.  The Day after Mr. Jones had had that Conflict with himself, which we have seen in the preceding Chapter, Mrs. Honor came into his Room, and finding him alone, began in the following Manner: 'La, Sir, where do you think I have been? I warrants you, you would not guess in fifty Years; but if you did guess, to be sure, I must not tell you neither,' 'Nay if it be something which you must not tell me,' said Jones, 'I shall have the Curiosity to enquire, and I know you will not be so barbarous to refuse me.' 'I don't know,' cries she, 'why I should refuse you neither, for that Matter; for to be sure you will not mention it any more. And for that Matter, if you knew where I had been, unless you knew what I had been about, it would not signify much. Nay, I don't see why it should be kept a Secret, for my Part; for to be sure she is the best Lady in the World.' Upon this Jones began to beg earnestly to be let into this Secret, and faithfully promised not to divulge it. She then proceeded thus. 'Why you must know, Sir, my young Lady sent me to enquire after Molly Seagrim, and to see whether the Wench wanted any thing; to be sure, I did not care to go, methinks; but Servants must do what they are ordered. -- How could you undervalue yourself so, Mr. Jones? -- So my Lady bid me go, and carry her some Linen, and other Things. -- She is too good. If such forward Sluts were sent to Bridewell it would be better for them. I told my Lady, says I, Madam, Your La'ship is encouraging Idleness. -- ' And was my Sophia so good?' says Jones. -- 'My Sophia! I assure you, marry come up,' answered Honor. 'And yet if you knew all. -- Indeed, if I was as Mr. Jones, I should look a little higher than such Trumpery as Molly Seagrim.' 'What do you mean by these Words,' replied Jones, 'I^ I knew all?' 'I mean what I mean,' says Honor Don't you remember putting your Hands in my Lady's Muff once? I vow I could almost find in my Heart to tell, if I was certain my Lady would never come to the Hearing on it.' -- Jones then made several solemn Protestations. And Honor proceeded -- 'then, to be sure, my Lady gave me that Muff; and afterward, upon hearing what you had done -- ' 'Then you told her what I had done! interrupted Jones, 'If I did, Sir,' answered she 'you need not be angry with me. Many's the Man would have given his Head to have had my Lady told, if they had known -- for, to be sure the biggest Lord in the Land might be proud -- but I protest, I have a great mind not to tell you.' Jones fell to Entreaties, and soon prevailed on he^ to go on thus. 'You must know then, Sir, tha^ my Lady had given this Muff to me; but about Day or two after I had told her the Story, she quarrels with her new Muff, and to be sure it is the prettiest that ever was seen. Honor,' says she, -- this is an odious Muff; -- it is too big for me, -- I cannot wear it -- till I can get another, you must let me have my old one again, and you may have this in the room on it -- for she is a good Lady, and scorns to give a Thing and take a Thing, I promise you that. So to be sure I fetched it her back against and I believe, she has worn it upon her Arm al^ most ever since, and I warrants has given it many' a Kiss when nobody has seen her.  Here the Conversation was interrupted by Mr. Western himself, who came to summon Jones to the Harpsichord; whither the poor young Fellow went all pale and trembling. This Western observed, but on seeing Mrs. Honor, imputed it to a wrong Cause and having given Jones a hearty Curse between Jes^ and Earnest, he bid him beat abroad, and not poach up the Game in his Warren.  Sophia looked this Evening with more than usual Beauty, and we may believe it was no small Addition ^o her Charms in the Eye of Mr. Jones, that she ^ow happened to have on her Right Arm this very Muff.  She was playing one of her Father's favorite Tunes, and he was leaning on her Chair when the Muff fell over her Fingers, and put her out. This ^o disconcerted the Squire, that he snatched the Muff from her, and with a hearty Curse threw it into the ^ire. Sophia instantly started up, and with the utmost Eagerness recovered it from the Flames.  Though this Incident will probably appear of little ^onsequence to many of our Readers, yet, trifling as was, it had so violent an Effect on poor Jones, that ^e thought it our Duty to relate it. In reality, there ^e many little Circumstances too often omitted by judicious Historians, from which Events of the utmost Importance arise. The World may indeed be ^onsidered as a vast Machine, in which the great Wheels are originally set in Motion by those which ^e very minute, and almost imperceptible to any but ^e strongest Eyes.  Thus, not all the Charms, of the incomparable Sophia; not all the dazzling Brightness, and languishing softness of her Eyes; the Harmony of her Voice, ^^ of her Person; not all her Wit, good Humor, Greatness of Mind, or sweetness of Disposition, had ^een able so absolutely to conquer and enslave the ^eart of poor Jones, as this little Incident of the Muff. Thus the Poet sweetly sings of Troy.  -- Captique dolis lachrymisque coacti Quos neque Tydides, nec Larissaeus Achilles, Non anni domuere december, non mill Carinae. What Diomede, or Thetis' greater Son, A thousand Ships, nor ten Years Siege had done, False Fears, and fawning Words, the City won. DRYDEN.  The Citadel of Jones was now taken by Surprise All those Considerations of Honor and Prudence which our Hero had lately with so much milita^^ Wisdom placed as Guards over the Avenues of h^ Heart, ran away from their Posts, and the God Love marched in in Triumph.  CHAP. V. A very long Chapter, containing a very great Inciden^  BUT though this victorious Deity easily expelle^ his avowed Enemies from the Heart of Jones, ^ found it more difficult to supplant the Garrison whi^^ he himself had placed there. To lay aside all Allgory, the Concern for what must become of po^ Molly, greatly disturbed and perplexed the Mind the worthy Youth. The superior Merit of Sophia totally ecclipsed, or rather extinguished all the Bea^ties of the poor Girl; but compassion instead of Contempt succeeded to Love. He was convinced t^^ Girl had placed all her Affections, and all her Prosp^^ of future Happiness in him only. For this he ha^^ he knew, given sufficient Occasion, by the utmo^^ Profusion of Tenderness toward her: A Tenderness which he had taken every Means to persuade ^^ he would always maintain. She, on her Side, h^ assured him of her firm Belief in his Promise, a^ had with the most solemn Vows declared, that his fulfilling, or breaking these Promises, it depend^ whether she should be the happiest, or the most mi^rable of Womankind. And to be the Author this highest Degree of Misery to a human Bei^^ was a Thought on which he could not bear to ru^nate a single Moment. He considered this poor as having sacrificed to him every Thing in her little Power; as having been at her own Expense the Object of his Pleasure; as sighing and languishing for him even at that very Instant. Shall then, says he, my Recovery, for which she has so ardently wished; shall my Presence which she has so eagerly expected, instead of giving her that Joy with which she has flattered herself, cast her at once down into Misery and Despair? Can I be such a Villain? Here, when the Genius of poor Molly seemed triumphant, the Love of Sophia toward him, which now appeared no longer dubious, rushed upon his Mind, and bore away every Obstacle before it.  At length it occurred to him, that he might possibly be able to make Molly amends another Way; namely, by giving her a Sum of Money. This nevertheless, he almost despaired of her accepting, when he recollected the frequent and vehement Assurances he had received from her, that the World put in Balance with him, would make her no amends for his Loss. However, her extreme Poverty, and chiefly her egregious Vanity (somewhat of which has been already hinted to the Reader,) gave him some little Hope, that notwithstanding all her avowed Tenderness, she might in Time be brought to content herself with a Fortune superior to her Expectation, and which might indulge her Vanity, by setting her above all her Equals. He resolved therefore, to take the first Opportunity of making a Proposal of this Kind.  One Day accordingly, when his Arm was so well recovered, that he could walk easily with it slung in a Sash, he stole forth, at a Season when the Squire was engaged in his Field Exercises, and visited his Fair one. Her Mother and Sisters, whom he found caking their Tea, informed him first that Molly was not at Home; but afterward, the elder Sister acquainted him with a malicious Smile, that she was above Stairs abed. Tom had no Objection to this Situation of his Mistress, and immediately ascended the Ladder which led toward her Bedchamber but when he came to the Top, he, to his great Surprise, found the Door fast; nor could he for some Time obtain any Answer from within; for Molly, as she herself afterward informed him, was fast asleep.  The Extremes of Grief and Joy have been remarked to produce very similar Effects; and when either of these rushes on us by Surprise, it is apt to create such a total Perturbation and Confusion, that we are often thereby deprived of the Use of all our Faculties. It cannot therefore be wondered at, that the unexpected Sight of Mr. Jones should so strongly operate on the Mind of Molly, and should overwhelm he^ with such Confusion, that for some Minutes she wa^ unable to express the great Raptures, with which the Reader will suppose she was affected on this Occasion^ As for Jones, he was so entirely possessed, and as i^ were enchanted by the Presence of his beloved Object that he for a while forgot Sophia, and consequently the principal Purpose of his Visit.  This, however, soon recurred to his Memory and after the first Transports of their Meeting were over, he found Means by Degrees to introduce a Discourse on the fatal Consequences which must attend their Amor, if Mr. Allworthy, who had strictly for bidden him ever seeing her more, should discover that he still carried on this Commerce. Such a Discovery, which his Enemies gave him Reason to thing would be unavoidable, must, he said, end in his Ruin, and consequently in hers. Since, therefore, their hard Fates had determined that they must separate, he advised her to bear it with Resolution, and swore he would never omit any Opportunity through the Course of his Life, of showing her the Sincerity of his Affection, by providing for her in a Manner beyond her utmost Expectation, or even beyond her wishes if ever that should be in his Power; concluding, at last, that she might soon find some Man who would marry her, and who would make her much happier than she could be by leading a disreputable Life with him.  Molly remained a few Moments in Silence, and then bursting into a Flood of Tears, she began to upbraid him in the following Words. 'And is this your Love for me, to forsake me in this Manner, now you have ruined me? How often, when I have told you that all Men are false and Perjury alike, and grow tired of us as soon as ever they have had their wicked Wills of us, how often have you sworn you would never forsake me? And can you be such a Perjury Man after all? What signifies all the Riches in the World to me without you, now you have gained my Heart, so you have -- you have --? Why do you mention another Man to me? I can never love any other Man as long as I live. All other Men are nothing to me. If the greatest Squire in all the Country would come a suiting to me tomorrow, I would not give my Company to him. No, I shall always hate and despise the whole Sex for your Sake -- '  She was proceeding thus, when an Accident put a Stop to her Tongue, before it had run out half its Career. The Room, or rather Garret, in which Molly ^ay, being up one Pair of Stairs, that is to say, at the Top of the House, was of a sloping Figure, resembling the great Delta of the Greeks. The English Reader may, perhaps, form a better Idea of it, by being told, that it was impossible to stand upright any where but in the Middle. Now, as this Room wanted the Convenience of a Closet, Molly had, to supply that Defect, nailed up an old Rug against the Rafters of the House, which enclosed a little Hole where her best Apparel, such as the Remains of that Sack which we have formerly mentioned, some Caps, and other Things with which she had lately provided herself, were hung up and secured from the Dust.  This enclosed Place exactly fronted the Foot of the Bed, to which, indeed, the Rug hung so near, that it served in a Manner, to supply the Want of Curtains. Now, whether Molly in the Agonies of her Rage, pushed this Rug with her Feet; or, Jones might touch it; or whether the Pin or Nail gave way of its own Accord, I am not certain; but as Molly pronounced those last Words, which are recorded above, the wicked Rug got loose from its Fastening, and discovered every thing hid behind it; where among other female Utensils appeared -- (with Shame I write it, and with Sorrow will it be read) -- the Philosopher Square, in a Posture (for the Place would not near admit of his standing upright) as ridiculous as can possibly be conceived.  The Posture, indeed, in which he stood, was not greatly unlike that of a Soldier who is tied Neck and Heels; or rather resembling the Attitude in which we often see Fellows in the public Streets of London, who are not suffering but deserving Punishment by so standing. He had a Nightcap belonging to Molly on his Head, and his two large Eyes, the Moment the Rug^ fell, stared directly at Jones; so that when the Idea of Philosophy was added to the Figure now discovered, it would have been very difficult for any Spectator to have refrained from immoderate Laughter.  I question not but the Surprise of the Reader will be here equal to that of Jones; as the Suspicions which must arise from the Appearance of this wise and grave Man in such a Place, may seem so inconsistent with that Character, which he has, doubtless, maintained hitherto, in the Opinion of every one.  But to confess the Truth, this Inconsistency is rather imaginary than real. Philosophers are composed of Flesh and Blood as well as other human Creatures; and however sublimated and refined the Theory of these may be, a little practical Frailty is as incident to them as to other Mortals. It is, indeed, in The^ry only and not in Practice, as we have before hinted, that consists the Difference: For though such great Beings think much better and more wisely, they always act exactly like other Men. They know very well how to subdue all Appetites and Passions, and ^o despise both Pain and Pleasure; and this Knowledge affords much delightful Contemplation, and is easily acquired; but the Practice would be vexatious and troublesome; and, therefore, the same Wisdom which teaches them to know this, teaches them to avoid carrying it into Execution.  Mr. Square happened to be at Church, on that Sunday when, as the Reader may be pleased to remember, the Appearance of Molly in her Sack had caused all this Disturbance. Here he first observed her and was so pleased with her Beauty, that he prevailed with the young Gentlemen to change their intended Ride that Evening, that he might pass by the Habitation of Molly, and, by that Means, might obtain a second Chance of seeing her. This Reason, however, as he did not at that Time mention to any, ^o neither did we think proper to communicate it then to the Reader.  Among other Particulars which constituted the Unfitness of Things in Mr. Square's Opinion, Danger and Difficulty were two. The Difficulty, therefore, which he apprehended there might be in corrupting this young Wench, and the Danger which would accrue to his Character on the Discovery, were ^ach strong Dissuasives, that it is probable, he at first intended to have contented himself with the pleasing Ideas which the Sight of Beauty furnishes us with. These the gravest Men, after a full Meal of Meditation, often allow themselves by Way of Desert: For which Purpose, certain Books and Pictures find their Way into the most private Recesses of their Study, and a certain liquorish Part of natural Philosophy is often the principal Subject of their Conversation.  But when the Philosopher heard a Day or two afterward, that the Fortress of Virtue had already been subdued, he began to give a larger Scope to his Desires. His Appetite was not of that squeamish Kind which cannot feed on a Dainty because another had tasted it. In short, he liked the Girl the better for the Want of that Chastity, which, if she had possessed it, must have been a Bar to his Pleasures; he pursued, and obtained her.  The Reader will be mistaken, if he thinks Molly gave Square the Preference to her younger Lover On the contrary, had she been confined to the Choice of one only, Tom Jones would, undoubtedly, have been, of the two, the victorious Person. No^ was it solely the Consideration that two are better than one (though this had it is proper Weight) to which Mr. Square owed his Success; the Absence of Jones during his Confinement was an unlucky Circumstance; and in that Interval, some well chosen presents from the Philosopher so softened and unguarded the Girl's Heart, that a favorable Opportunity became irresistible, and Square triumphed over the poor Remains of Virtue which subsisted in the Bosom of Molly.  It was now about a Fortnight since this Conquest, when Jones paid the abovementioned Visit to his Mistress, at a time when she and Square were in Bed together. This was the true Reason why the Mother denied her as we have seen; for as the old Woman-shared in the Profits arising from the Iniquity of her Daughter, she encouraged and protected her in it to the utmost of her Power; but such was the Envy and Hatred which the eldest Sister bore toward Molly, that, notwithstanding she had some Part of the Booty, she would willingly have parted with this to ruin her Sister, and spoil her Trade. Hence she had acquainted Jones with her being above Stairs in Bed, in Hopes that he might have caught her in Square's Arms. This, however, Molly found Means to prevent, as the Door was fastened; which gave her an Opportunity of conveying her Lover behind that Rug or Blan^et where he now was unhappily discovered.  Square no sooner made his Appearance than Molly flung herself back in her Bed, cried out she was undone, and abandoned herself to Despair. This poor Girl, who was yet but a Novice in her Business, had ^ot arrived to that Perfection of Assurance which helps off a Town Lady in any Extremity; and either prompts her with an Excuse, or else inspires her to brazen out the Matter with her Husband; who from Love of Quiet, or out of Fear of his Reputation, and sometimes, perhaps, from Fear of the Gallant, who, like Mr. Constant in the Play, wears a Sword, is glad to shut his Eyes, and contented to put his Horns in his Pocket: Molly, on the contrary, was silenced by this Evidence, and very fairly gave up a Cause which she had hitherto with so many Tears, and with such solemn and vehement Protestations of the purest Love and Constancy, maintained.  As to the Gentleman behind the Arras, he was not in much less Consternation. He stood for a while motionless, and seemed equally at a Loss what to say, or whither to direct his Eyes. Jones, though perhaps, the most astonished of the three, first found his Tongue; and, being immediately recovered from those uneasy Sensations, which Molly by her upbraidings had occasioned, he burst into a loud Laughter, and then saluting Mr. Square, advanced to take him by the Hand, and to relieve him from his Place of Confinement.  Square, being now arrived in the Middle of the Room, in which Part only he could stand upright, looked at Jones with a very grave Countenance, and said to him, 'Well, Sir, I see you enjoy this mighty Discovery, and, I dare swear, taste great Delight in the Thoughts of exposing me: but if you will consider the Matter fairly, you will find you are yourself only to blame. I have done nothing for which that Part of the World which judges of Matters by the Rule of Right will condemn me. Fitness is governed by the Nature of Things, and not by Customs, Forms, or municipal Laws. Nothing is, indeed, unfit which is not unnatural.' 'Well reasoned, old Boy,' answered Jones; 'but why do thou think I should desire to expose thee? I promise thee, I was never better pleased with thee in my Life; and unless thou have a Mind to discover it thyself, this Affair may remain a profound Secret for me.' 'Nay, Mr. Jones,' replied Square, 'I would not be thought to undervalue Reputation. Good Fame is a Species of the KALON, and it is by no Means fitting to neglect it. Besides to murder one's own Reputation, is a kind of Suicide, a detestable odious Vice. If you think proper, therefore, to conceal any Infirmity of mine; (for such I may have, since no Man is perfectly perfect;) I promise you I will not betray myself. Things may be fitting to be done, which are not fitting to be boasted of: for by the perverse Judgment of the World, That often becomes the Subject of Censure, which is, in Truth, not only innocent but laudable.' 'Right!' cries Jones, 'what can be more innocent than the Indulgence of a natural Appetite? or what more laudable than the Propagation of our Species?' 'To be serious with you,' answered Square, 'I profess they always appeared so to me.' 'And yet,' said Jones, 'you was of a different Opinion when my Affair with this Girl was first discovered.' 'Why, I must confess,' says Square, 'as the Matter was misrepresented to me by that Parson Thwakum, I might condemn the Corruption of Innocence. It was that, Sir, it was that -- and that --: For you must know, Mr. Jones, in the Consideration of Fitness, very minute Circumstances, Sir, very minute Circumstances cause great Alteration.' -- 'Well,' cries Jones, 'be that as it will, it shall be your own Fault, as I have promised you, if you ever hear any more of this Adventure. Behave kindly to the Girl, and I will never open my Lips concerning the Matter to any one. And, Molly, do you be faithful to your Friend, and I will not only forgive your Infidelity to me; but will do you all the Service I can.' So saying, he took a hasty Leave, and slipping down the Ladder, retired with much Expedition.  Square was rejoiced to find this Adventure was likely to have no worse Conclusion; and as for Molly, being recovered from her Confusion, she began at first to upbraid Square with having been the Occasion of her Loss of Jones; but that Gentleman soon found the Means of mitigating her Anger, partly by a small Nostrum from his Purse, of wonderful and approved Efficacy in purging off the ill Humors of the Mind, and in restoring it to a good Temper.  She then poured forth a vast Profusion of Tenderness toward her new Lover; turned all she had said to Jones, and Jones himself into Ridicule, and vowed, though he had had the Possession of her Person, that none but Square had ever been Master of her Heart.  CHAP. VI. By comparing which with the former, the Reader may possibly correct some Abuse which he has formerly been guilty of, in the Application of the Word LOVE.  THE Infidelity of Molly, which Jones had now discovered, would, perhaps, have vindicated a much greater Degree of Resentment than he expressed on the Occasion; and if he had abandoned her directly from that Moment, very few, I believe, would have blamed him.  Certain, however, it is, that he saw her in the Light of Compassion; and though his Love to her was not of that Kind which could give him any great Uneasiness at her Inconstancy, yet was he not a little shocked on reflecting that he had himself originally corrupted her Innocence; for to this Corruption he imputed all the Vice, into which she appeared now so likely to plunge herself.  This Consideration gave him no little Uneasiness, till Betty, the elder Sister, was so kind some time afterward entirely to cure him by a Hint, that one Will Barnes, and not himself, had been the first Seducer of Molly; and that the little Child, which he had hitherto so certainly concluded to be his own, might very probably have an equal Title at least, to claim Barnes for its Father.  Jones eagerly pursued this Scent when he had first received it; and in a very short Time was sufficiently assured that the Girl had told him Truth, not only by the Confession of the Fellow, but, at last, by that of Molly herself.  This Will Barnes was a Country Gallant, and had acquired as many Trophies of this Kind as any Ensign or Attorney's Clerk in the Kingdom. He had, indeed, reduced several Women to a State of utter Profligacy, had broke the Hearts of some, and had the Honor of occasioning the violent Death of one poor Girl, who had either drowned herself, or, what was rather more probable, had been drowned by him.  Among other of his Conquests, this Fellow had triumphed over the Heart of Betty Seagrim. He had made love to her long before Molly was grown to be a fit Object of that Pastime; but had afterward deserted her, and applied to her Sister, with whom he had almost immediate Success. Now Will had, in reality, the sole Possession of Molly's Affection, while Jones and Square were almost equally Sacrifices to her Interest, and to her Pride.  Hence had grown that implacable Hatred which we have before seen raging in the Mind of Betty; though we did not think it necessary to assign this Cause sooner, as Envy itself was alone adequate to all the Effects we have mentioned.  Jones was become perfectly easy by Possession of this Secret with Regard to Molly; but as to Sophia, he was far from being in a State of Tranquillity; nay, indeed, he was under the most violent Perturbation: His Heart was now, if I may use the Metaphor, entirely evacuated, and Sophia took absolute Possession of it. He loved her with an unbounded Passion, and plainly saw the tender Sentiments she had for him; yet could not this Assurance lessen his Despair of obtaining the Consent of her Father, nor the Horrors which attended his Pursuit of her by any base or treacherous Method.  The Injury which he must thus do to Mr. Western, and the Concern which would accrue to Mr. Allworthy, were Circumstances that tormented him all Day, and haunted him on his Pillow at Night. His Life was a constant Struggle between Honor and Inclination, which alternately triumphed over each other in his Mind. He often resolved in the Absence of Sophia, to leave her Father's House, and to see her no more; and as often, in her presence, forgot all those Resolutions, and determined to pursue her at the Hazard of his Life, and at the Forfeiture of what was much dearer to him.  This Conflict began soon to produce very strong and visible Effects: For he lost all his usual Sprightliness and Gaiety of Temper, and became not only melancholy when alone, but dejected and absent in Company; nay, if ever he put on a forced Mirth, to comply with Mr. Western's Humor, the Constraint appeared so plain, that he may seem to have been giving the strongest Evidence of what he endeavored to conceal by such Ostentation.  It may, perhaps, be a Question, whether the Art which he used to conceal his Passion, or the Means which honest Nature employed to reveal it, betrayed him most: For while Art made him more than ever reserved to Sophia, and forbad him to address any of his Discourse to her; nay, to avoid meeting her Eyes, with the utmost Caution; Nature was no less busy in counterplotting him. Hence, at the Approach of the young Lady, he grew pale; and if this was sudden, started. If his Eyes accidentally met hers, the Blood rushed into his Cheeks, and his Countenance became all over Scarlet. If common Civility ever obliged him to speak to her, as to drink her Health at Table, his Tongue was sure to faulter. If he touched her, his Hand, nay his whole Frame trembled. And if any Discourse tended, however remotely, to raise the Idea of Love, an involuntary Sigh seldom failed to steal from his Bosom. Most of which Accidents Nature was wonderfully industrious to throw in his Way.  All these Symptoms escaped the Notice of the Squire; but not so of Sophia. She soon perceived these Agitations of Mind in Jones, and was at no Loss to discover the Cause; for indeed she recognized it in her own Breast. And this Recognition is, I suppose, that Sympathy which has been so often noted in Lovers, and which will sufficiently account for her being so much quicker-sighted than her Father.  But, to say the Truth, there is a more simple and plain Method of accounting for that prodigious Superiority of Penetration which we must observe in some Men over the rest of the human Species, and one which will not only serve in the Case of Lovers, but of all others. For whence is it that the Knave is generally so quick-sighted to those Symptoms and Operations of Knavery which often dupe an honest Man of a much better Understanding? There surely is no general Sympathy among Knaves, nor have they, like Free Masons, any common Sign of Communication. In reality, it is only because they have the same thing in their Heads, and their thoughts are turned the same Way. Thus, that Sophia saw, and that Western did not see the plain Symptoms of Love in Jones can be no Wonder, when we consider that the Idea of Love never entered into the Head of the Father, whereas the Daughter, at present, thought of nothing else.  When Sophia was well satisfied of the Passion which tormented poor Jones, and no less certain that she herself was its Object, she had not the least Difficulty in discovering the true Cause of his present Behavior. This highly endeared him to her, and raised in her Mind two of the best Affections which any Lover can wish to raise in a Mistress. These were Esteem and Pity; for sure the most outragiously rigid among her Sex will excuse her pitying a Man, whom she saw miserable on her own Account; nor can they blame her for esteeming one who visibly from the most honorable Motives, endeavored to smother a Flame in his own Bosom, which, like the famous Spartan Theft, was preying upon, and consuming his very Vitals. Thus his Backwardness, his Shunning her, his Coldness and his Silence, were the forwardest, the most diligent, the warmest, and most eloquent Advocates; and wrought so violently on her sensible and tender Heart, that she soon felt for him all those gentle Sensations which are consistent with a virtuous and elevated female Mind -- In short, all which esteem, Gratitude and Pity, can inspire, in such, toward an agreeable Man -- Indeed, all which the nicest Delicacy can allow -- In a Word, -- she was in Love with him to Distraction.  One Day, this young Couple accidentally met in the Garden, at the End of two Walks, which were both bounded by that Canal in which Jones had formerly risqued drowning to retrieve the little Bird that Sophia had there lost.  This Place had been of late much frequented by Sophia. Here she used to ruminate, with a Mixture of Pain and Pleasure, on an Incident, which, however trifling in itself, had possibly sown the first Seeds of that Affection which was now arrived to such Maturity in her Heart.  Here then this young Couple met. They were almost close together before either of them knew any Thing of the other's Approach. A By-stander would have discovered sufficient Marks of Confusion, in the Countenance of each; but they felt too much themselves to make any Observation. As soon as Jones had a little recovered his first Surprise, he accosted the young Lady with some of the ordinary forms of Salutation, which she in the same Manner returned, and their Conversation began, as usual, on the delicious Beauty of the Morning. Hence they passed to the Beauty of the Place, on which Jones launched forth very high Encomiums. When they came to the Tree whence he had formerly tumbled into the Canal, Sophia could not help reminding him of that Accident, and said, 'I fancy, Mr. Jones, you have some little shuddering when you see that Water.' 'I assure you, Madam,' answered Jones, 'the Concern you felt at the Loss of your little Bird, will always appear to me the highest Circumstance in that Adventure. Poor little Tommy, there is the Branch he stood upon. How could the little Wretch have the Folly to fly away from that State of Happiness in which I had the Honor to place him? His Fate was a just Punishment for his Ingratitude.' 'Upon my Word, Mr. Jones.' said she, 'your Gallantry very narrowly escaped as severe a Fate. Sure, the Remembrance must affect you.' 'Indeed, Madam,' answered he, 'if I have any Reason to reflect with Sorrow on it, it is, perhaps, that the Water had not been a little deeper, by which I might have escaped many bitter Heart-achs, that Fortune seems to have in Store for me.' 'Fie, Mr. Jones.' replied Sophia, 'I am sure you cannot be in Earnest now. This affected Contempt of Life is only an Excess of your Complaisance to me. You would endeavor to lessen the Obligation of having twice ventured it for my Sake. Beware the third Time.' -- She spoke these last Words with a Smile and a Softness inexpressible. Jones answered with a Sigh, 'He feared it was already too late for Caution,' -- and then looking tenderly and steadfastly on her, he cried, 'Oh! Miss Western, -- Can you desire me to live? Can you wish me so ill?' -- Sophia looking down on the Ground, answered with some Hesitation. Indeed, Mr. Jones, I do not wish you ill.' -- Oh! I know too well that heavenly Temper,' cries Jones, 'that divine Goodness which is beyond every other Charm.' Nay, now,' answered she, I understand you not. -- I can stay no longer, -- I --. I would not be understood,' cries he,' 'nay, I cannot be understood. I know not what I say. Meeting here so unexpectedly -- I have been unguarded -- for Heaven's Sake pardon me, if I have said any Thing to offend you -- I did not mean it -- indeed, I would rather have died -- nay, the very Thought would kill me.' 'You surprise me.' answered she, -- 'How can you possibly think you have offended me?' 'Fear, Madam,' says he, easily runs into Madness; and there is no Degree of Fear like that which I feel of offending you. How can I speak then? Nay don't look angrily at me, one Frown will destroy me. -- I mean nothing -- Blame my Eyes, or blame those Beauties -- What am I saying? Pardon me if I have said too much. My Heart overflowed. I have struggled with my Love to the utmost, and have endeavored to conceal a Fever which preys on my Vitals, and will, I hope, soon make it impossible for me' ever to offend you more.  Mr. Jones now fell a trembling as if he had been shaken with the Fit of an Ague. Sophia, who was in a Situation not very different from his, answered in these Words: 'Mr. Jones, I will not affect to misunderstand you; indeed I understand you too well; but for Heaven's Sake, if you have any Affection for me, let me make the best of my way into the House. I wish I may be able to support myself thither.'  Jones, who was hardly able to support himself, offered her his Arm, which she condescended to accept, but begged he would not mention a Word more to her of this Nature at present. He promised he would not, insisting only on her Forgiveness of what Love, without the Leave of his Will, had forced from him: This, she told him, he knew how to obtain by his future Behavior; and thus this young Pair tottered and trembled along, the Lover not once daring to squeeze the Hand of his Mistress, though it was locked in his.  Sophia immediately retired to her Chamber, where Mrs. Honor and the Hartshorn were summoned to her Assistance. As to poor Jones, the only Relief to his distempered Mind, was an unwelcome Piece of News, which, as it opens a Scene of a different Nature from those in which the Reader has lately been conversant, will be communicated to him in the next Chapter.  CHAP. VII. In which Mr. Allworthy appears on a Sickbed.  MR. Western was become so fond of Jones, that he was unwilling to part with him, though his Arm had been long since cured; and Jones, either from his Love of Sport, or from some other Reason, was easily persuaded to continue at his House, which he did sometimes for a Fortnight together without paying a single Visit at Mr. Allworthy's; nay, without ever hearing from thence.  Mr. Allworthy had been for some Days indisposed with a Cold, which had been attended with a little Fever. This he had, however, neglected, as it was usual with him to do all Manner of Disorders which did not confine him to his Bed, or prevent his several Faculties from performing their ordinary Functions. A Conduct which we would by no Means be thought to approve or recommend to Imitation: For surely the Gentlemen of the Aesculapian Art are in the Right in advising, that the Moment the Disease is entered at one Door, the Physician should be introduced at the other; what else is meant by that old Adage, Venienti ^ccurrite Morbo? "Oppose a Distemper at its first Approach." Thus the Doctor and the Disease meet in fair and equal Conflict; whereas, by giving Time to the latter, we often suffer him to fortify and entrench himself, like a French Army; so that the learned Gentleman finds it very difficult, and sometimes impossible to come at the Enemy. Nay sometimes by gaining Time, the Disease applies to the French military Politics, and corrupts Nature over to his Side, and then all the Powers of Physic must arrive too late. Agreeable to these Observations was, I remember, the complaint of the great Doctor Misaubin, who used very pathetically to lament the late Applications which were made to his Skill: Saying, 'Bygar, me believe my Pation take me for de Under taker: For dey never send for me till de Physicion have kill them.'  Mr. Allworthy's Distemper, by Means of this Neglect, gained such Ground, that when the Increase o^ his Fever obliged him to send for Assistance, the Doctor at his first Arrival shook his Head, wished he had been sent for sooner, and intimated that he thought him in very imminent Danger. Mr. Allworthy, who had settled all his Affairs in the World, and was as well prepared, as it is possible for human Nature to be, for the other, received this Information with the utmost Calmness and Unconcern. He could indeed, whenever he laid himself down to Rest, say with Cato in the tragical Poem,  -- Let Guilt or Fear Disturb Man's Rest, Cato knows neither of them; Indifferent in his Choice, to sleep or die. In Reality, he could say this with ten times more Reason and Confidence than Cato, or any other proud Fellow among the ancient or modern Heroes: For he was not only devoid of Fear; but might be considered as a faithful Labourer, when at the End of Harvest, he is summoned to receive his Reward at the Hands of a bountiful Master.  The good Man gave immediate Orders for all his Family to be summoned round him. None of these were then abroad, but Mrs. Blifil who had been some Time in London, and Mr. Jones, whom the Reader has just parted from at Mr. Western's and who received this Summons just as Sophia had left him.  The News of Mr. Allworthy's Danger (for the Servant told him he was dying) drove all Thoughts of Love out of his Head. He hurried instantly into the Chariot which was sent for him, and ordered the Coachman to drive with all imaginable Haste; nor did the Idea of Sophia, I believe, once occur to him on the Way.  And now, the whole Family, namely, Mr. Blifil, Mr. Jones, Mr. Thwackum, Mr. Square, and some of the Servants (for such were Mr. Allworthy's Orders) being all assembled round his Bed, the good Man sat up in it, and was beginning to speak, when Blifil fell to blubbering; and began to express very loud and bitter Lamentations. Upon this Mr. Allworthy shook him by the Hand, and said, 'Do not sorrow thus, my dear Nephew, at the most ordinary of all human Occurrences. When Misfortunes befall our Friends we are justly grieved: For those are Accidents which might often have been avoided, and which may seem to render the Lot of one Man, more peculiarly unhappy than that of others; but Death is certainly unavoidable, and is that common Lot, in which alone the Fortunes of all Men agree; nor is the Time when this happens to us material. If the wisest of Men has compared Life to a Span, surely we may be allowed to consider it as a Day. It is my Fate to leave it in the Evening; but those who are taken away earlier, have only lost a few Hours, at the best little worth lamenting, and much oftener Hours of Labor and Fatigue, of Pain and Sorrow. One of the Roman Poets, I remember, likens our leaving Life to our Departure from a Feast. A Thought which has often occurred to me, when I have seen Men struggling to protract an Entertainment, and to enjoy the Company of their Friends a few Moments longer. Alas! how short is the most protracted of such Enjoyments! How immaterial the Difference between him who retires the soonest, and him who stays the latest! This is seeing Life in the best View, and this Unwillingness to quit our Friends is the most amiable Motive, from which we can derive the Fear of Death; and yo^ the longest Enjoyment which we can hope for o^ this Kind is of so trivial a Duration, that it is to ^ wise Man truly contemptible. Few Men, I own think in this Manner: for, indeed, few Men think of Death 'till they are in its Jaws. However gigantic and terrible an Object this may appear when it approaches them, they are nevertheless incapable of seeing it at any Distance; nay, though they have been ever so much frightened and alarmed when they have apprehended themselves in Danger o^ dying, they are no sooner cleared from this Apprehension than even the Fears of it are erased from their Minds. But alas! he who escapes from Death is not pardoned, he is only reprieved, and reprieved to a short Day.'  'Grieve, therefore, no more, my dear Child, on this Occasion; an Event which may happen every Hour, which every Element, nay almost every Particle of Matter that surrounds us is capable of producing, and which must and will most unavoidably reach us all at last, ought neither to occasion our Surprise, nor our Lamentation.'  'My Physician having acquainted me (which I take very kindly of him) that I am in Danger of leaving you all very shortly, I have determined to say a few Words to you at this our Parting, before my Distemper, which I find grows very fast upon me, puts it out of my Power.'  'But I shall waste my Strength too much. -- I intended to speak concerning my Will, which though I have settled long ago, I think proper to mention such Heads of as concern any of you, that I may have the Comfort of perceiving you are all satisfied with the Provision I have there made for you.'  'Nephew Blifil, I leave you the Heir to my whole Estate, except only 500l. a Year which is to revert to you after the Death of your Mother, and except one other Estate of 500l. a Year, and the Sum of 6000l. which I have bestowed in the following Manner.'  'The Estate of 500l. a Year I have given to you, Mr. Jones. And as I know the Inconvenience which attends the Want of ready Money, I have added 1000l. in Specie. In this I know not whether I have exceeded, or fallen short of your Expectatation. Perhaps you will think I have given you too little, and the World will be as ready to condemn me for giving you too much; but the latter Censure I despise, and as to the former, unless you should entertain that common Error, which I have often heard in my Life pleaded as an Excuse for a total Want of Charity; namely, that instead of raising Gratitude by voluntary Acts of Bounty, we are apt to raise Demands, which of all others are the most boundless and most difficult to satisfiy. -- Pardon me the bare Mention of this, I will not suspect any such Thing.'  Jones flung himself at his Benefactor's Feet, and taking eagerly hold of his Hand, assured him, his Goodness to him, both now, and at all other Times, had so infinitely exceeded not only his Merit, but his Hopes, that no Words could express his Sense of it. 'And I assure you, Sir, said he, your present Generosity has left me no other Concern than for the present melancholy Occasion. -- Oh, my Friend! my Father!' Here his Words choked him, and he turned away to hide a Tear which was starting from his Eyes.  Allworthy then gently squeezed his Hand, and proceeded thus. 'I am convinced, my Child, that you have much Goodness, Generosity and Honor in your Temper, if you will add Prudence and Religion to these, you must be happy: For the three former Qualities, I admit, make you worthy o^ Happiness, but they are the latter only which will put you in Possession of it.'  'One thousand Pound I have given to you Mr. Thwackum; a Sum, I am convinced, which greatly exceeds your Desires as well as your Wants. However, you will receive it as a Memorial of my Friendship; and whatever Superfluities may redound to you, that Piety which you so rigidly maintain, will instruct you how to dispose of it.'  'A like Sum, Mr. Square, I have bequeathed to you. This, I hope, will enable you to pursue your Profession with better Success than hitherto. I have often observed with Concern, that Distress is more apt to excite Contempt than Commiseration, especially among Men of Business, with whom Poverty is understood to indicate Want of Ability. But the little I have been able to leave you, will extricate you from those Difficulties with which you have formerly struggled, and then I doubt not but you will meet with sufficient Prosperity to supply what a Man of your Philosophical Temper will require.'  'I find myself growing faint, so I shall refer you to my Will for my Disposition of the Residue. My Servants will there find some Tokens to remember me by, and there are a few Charities which, I trust, my Executors will see faithfully performed. Bless you all.' I am setting out a little before you --  Here a Footman came hastily into the Room, and said there was an Attorney from Salisbury, who had a particular Message, which he said he must communicate to Mr. Allworthy himself: That he seemed in a violent Hurry, and protested he had so much Business to do, that if he could cut himself into four Quarters, all would not be sufficient.  Go, Child, said Allworthy to Blifil, see what the Gentleman wants. I am not able to do any Business now, nor can he have any with me, in which you ^re not at present more concerned than myself. Be^^des I really am -- I am incapable of seeing any one ^^ present, or of any longer Attention. He then sa^ted them all, saying, perhaps he would be able to ^e them again, but he should be now glad to compose himself a little, finding that he had too much ex^austed his Spirits in Discourse.  Some of the Company shed Tears at their Parting; and even the Philosopher Square wiped his Eyes, al^it unused to the melting Mood. As to Mrs. Wilkins, ^e dropped her Pearls as fast as the Arabian Trees their Medicinal Gums; for this was a Cermonial which that Gentlewoman never omitted on a proper Occasion.  After this Mr. Allworthy again laid himself down ^n his Pillow, and endeavored to compose himself ^o Rest.  CHAP. VIII. Containing Matter rather natural than pleasing.  BESIDES Grief for her Master, there was another Source for that briny Stream which so ^entifully rose above the two Mountainous Cheek ^ones of the Housekeeper. She was no sooner re^ed, than she began to mutter to herself in the following pleasant Strain. 'Sure Master might have made some Difference, methinks, between me and the other Servants. I suppose he has left me Mourning; but, i-fackins! if that be all, the Devil shall wear it for me. I Would have his Worship know I am no Beggar. I have saved five hundred Pound in his Service, and after all to be used in this Manner. It is a fine Encouragement to Servants to be honest; and to be sure, if I have taken a little something now and then, others have taken ten times as much; and now we are all put in a Lump together. If so be that it be so, the Legacy may go to the Devil with him that gave it. No, I will not give up neither, because that will please some Folks No,
