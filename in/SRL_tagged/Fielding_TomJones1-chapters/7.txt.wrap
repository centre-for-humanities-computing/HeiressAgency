it. This i^ my Reward for taking his Part so often, when a^ the Country have cried Shame of him for breeding up his Bastard in that Manner; but he is going now where he must pay for all. It would have be comed him better to have repented of his Sins o^ his Deathbed, than to glory in them, and give ^ way his Estate out of his own Family to a mis-be gotten Child. Found in his Bed, forsooth! A pre^ty Story! Ay, ay, those that hide know where ^ find. Lord forgive him, I warrant he has man more Bastards to answer for, if the Truth wa^ known. One Comfort is, they will all be know where he is a going now, 'The Servants will fi^^ some Token to remember me by.' Those we^^ the very Words, I shall never forget them, it was to live a thousand Years. Ay, ay, I shall remember you for huddling me among the Servant One would have thought he might have mention my Name as well as that of Square; but he is Gentleman forsooth, though he had not Clothes his Back when he came hither first. Marry co^^ up with such Gentlemen! though he has lived he^ these many Years, I don't believe there is arr^ Servant in the House ever saw the Color of ^ Money. The Devil shall wait upon such Gentlemen for me.' Much more of the like kind she muttered to herself; but this Taste shall suffice to the Reader.  Neither Thwackum nor Square were much bet^ satisfied with their Legacies. Though they breath not their Resentment so loud, yet from the Discont^ which appeared in their Countenances, as well from the following Dialogue, we collect that no g^ Pleasure reigned in their Minds.  About an Hour after they had left the sick Room, ^quare met Thwackum in the Hall, and accosted him ^us, 'Well, Sir, have you heard any News of your Friend since we parted from him? 'If you mean Mr. Allworthy,' answered Thwackum, 'I think you might rather give him the Appellation of your Friend: For he seems to me to have deserved that Title.' 'The Title is as good on your Side,' re^lied Square, 'for his Bounty, such as it is, has been equal to both.' 'I should not have mentioned it first,' cries Thwackum, 'but since you begin, I must inform you I am of a Different Opinion. There is a wide Distinction between voluntary Favors and Rewards. The Duty I have done in his Family, and the Care I have taken in the Education of his two Boys, are Services for which some Men might have expected a greater Return. I would not have you imagine I am therefore dissatisfied; for St. Paul has taught me to be content with the little I have. Had the Modicum been less, I should have known my Duty. But though the Scripture obliges me to remain contented, it does not enjoin me to shut my Eyes to my own Merit, nor restrain me from seeing, when I am injured by an unjust Comparison. Since you provoke me,' re^urned Square, 'that Injury is done to me: Nor did I ever imagine Mr. Allworthy had held my Friendship so light, as to put me in Balance with one who received his Wages: I know to what it is owing; it proceeds from those narrow Principles which you have been so long endeavoring to infuse into him, in Contempt of every Thing which is great and noble. The Beauty and Loveliness of Friendship is too strong for dim Eyes, nor can it be perceived by any other Medium, than that unerring Rule of Right which you have so often endeavored to ridicule, that you have perverted my Friend's Understanding.' 'I wish,' cries Thwackum, in a Rage, 'I wish for the Sake of his Soul, your damnabl^ Doctrines have not perverted his Faith. It is ^^ this, I impute his present Behavior so unbecoming a Christian. Who but an Athiest could think ^^ leaving the World without having first made up h^ Account? without confessing his Sins, and receiving that Absolution which he knew he had one ^^ the House duly authorized to give him? He w^^ feel the Want of these Necessaries when it is to late. When he is arrived at the Place where the^ is Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth. It is then ^^ will find in what mighty Stead that Heathen Goddess, that Virtue which you and all other Deists ^^ the Age adore, will stand him. He will then summon his Priest when there is none to be found, as will lament the Want of that Absolution, without which no Sinner can be safe.' 'If it be so materia^ says Square, Why don't you present it him ^^ 'your own Accord?' 'It has no Virtue,' cri^^ Thwackum, 'but to those who have sufficient Gra^^ to require it. But why do I talk thus to a Heath^ and an Unbeliever? It is you who have taught h^ this Lesson, for which you have been well-rewared in this World, as I doubt not your Disciple w^^ soon be in the other.' 'I know not what y^^ mean by my Reward,' said Square, 'but if you h^ at that pitiful Memorial of our Friendship, which ^^ has thought fit to bequeath me, I despise it, a^ nothing but the unfortunate Situation of my C^^cumstances should prevail on me to accept it.  The Physician now arrived, and began to enqu^ of the two Disputants, How we all did above Stair 'In a miserable Way,' answered Thwackum, '^^ is no more than I expected,' cries the Doctor but pray what Symptoms have appeared since left you? No good ones, I am afraid,' repl^ Thwackum, 'after what past at our Departure; think there were little Hopes.' The Bodily Phy^^cian, perhaps, misunderstood the Curer of Souls, and before they came to an Explanation, Mr. Blifil ^ame to them with a most melancholy Counte^ance, and acquainted them that he brought sad News: for that his Mother was dead at Salisbury. That she ^ad been seized on the Road home with the Gout ^n her Head and Stomach, which had carried her off ^n a few Hours. 'Good-lack-a-day,' says the Doc^or, 'One cannot answer for Events; but I wish I ^^ had been at Hand to have been called in. The ^^ Gout is a Distemper which is difficult to treat, yet ^^ I have been remarkably successful in it.' Thwackum and Square both condoled with Mr. Blifil for the Loss of his Mother, which the one advised him to ^ear like a Man, and the other like a Christian. The young Gentleman said, he knew very well we were all mortal, and he would endeavor to submit to his Loss, as well as he could. That he could not, however, help complaining a little against the peculiar Severity of his Fate, which brought the News of so great ^^ Calamity to him by Surprise, and that at a Time when he hourly expected the severest Blow he was ^apable of feeling from the Malice of Fortune. He did, the present Occasion would put to the Test those ^xcellent Rudiments, which he had learnt from Mr. Thwackum and Mr. Square, and it would be entirely owing to them, if he was enabled to survive such Misfortunes.  It was now debated whether Mr. Allworthy should be informed of the Death of his Sister: This the Doctor violent opposed, in which, I believe, the whole College will agree with him; but Mr. Blifil said he had received such positive and repeated Orders from his Uncle never to keep any Secret from him, for Fear of the Disquietude which it might give him, that he durst not think of Disobedience, whatever might be the Consequence. He said, for his Part, considering the religious and philosophic Temper o^ his Uncle, he could not agree with the Doctor in h^^ Apprehensions. He was therefore resolved to communicate it to him: For if his Uncle recovered (as h^ heartily prayed he might) he knew he would never forgive an Endeavor to keep a Secret of this Kind from him.  The Physician was forced to submit to these Resolutions which the two other learned Gentlemen very highly commended. So together moved Mr. Blifil and the Doctor toward the sick Room; when the Physician first entered, and approached the Be^ in order to feel his Patient's Pulse, which he had n^ sooner done, than he declared he was much better that the last Application had succeeded to a Miracle and had brought the Fever to intermit. So that, h^ said, there appeared now to be as little Danger as h^ had before apprehended there were Hopes.  To say the Truth, Mr. Alworthy's Situation ha^ never been so bad, as the great Caution of the Docto^ had represented it; but as a wise General never despises his Enemy, however inferior his Force man be, so neither does a wise Physician ever despise Distemper, however inconsiderable. As the forme^ preserves the same strict Discipline, places the sam^ Guards, and employs the same Scouts, though the Enemy be never so weak; so the latter maintains the sam^ Gravity of Countenance, and shakes his Head wi^^ the same significant Air, let the Distemper be never so trifling. And both, among many other goo^ ones, may assign this solid Reason for their Conduct that by these Means the greater Glory redounds ^ them if they gain the Victory, and the less Disgrac^ if by any unlucky Accident they should happen to b^ conquered.  Mr. Allworthy had no sooner lifted up his Eye and thanked Heaven for these Hopes of his Recovery than Mr. Blifil drew near with a very dejected Aspect a^ and having applied his Handkerchief to his Eye, either to wipe away his Tears, or as Ovid somewhere expresses himself on another Occasion, Si nullus erit, tamen excute nullum. 'If there be none, wipe away that none. he communicated to his Uncle what the Reader has been just before acquainted with.  Allworthy received the News with Concern, with Patience, and with Resignation. He dropped a tender Tear, then composed his Countenance, and at last cried, 'The Lord's Will be done in every Thing.'  He now enquired for the Messenger; but Blifil told him, it had been impossible to detain him a Moment; for he appeared by the great Hurry he was into have some Business of Importance on his Hands: That he complained of being hurried, and driven and torn out of his Life, and repeated many Times, that if he could divide himself into four Quarters, he knew how to dispose of every one.  Allworthy then desired Blifil to take Care of the Funeral. He said, he would have his Sister deposited in his own Chapel; and as to the Particulars, he left them to his own Discretion, only mentioning the Person whom he would have employed on this Occasion.  CHAP. IX. Which, among other Things, may serve as a Comment on that Saying of Aeschines, that DRUNKENNESS SHOWS THE MIND OF A MAN, AS A MIRROR REFLECTS HIS PERSON.  THE Reader may, perhaps, wonder at hearing nothing of Mr. Jones in the last Chapter. In fact, his Behavior was so different from that of the Persons there mentioned, that we chose not to confound his Name with theirs.  When the good Man had ended his Speech, Jones was the last who deserted the Room. Thence he retired to his own Apartment; to give Vent to h^ Concern; but the Restlessness of his Mind would not suffer him to remain long there; he slipped softly therefore, to Allworthy's Chamber Door, where ^^ listened a considerable Time without hearing and Kind of Motion within, unless a violent snoring, which at last his Fears misrepresented as Groans. This alarmed him, that he could not forbear entering the Room; where he found the Good Man in the Be^ in a sweet composed Sleep, and his Nurse snoring ^ the abovementioned hearty Manner, at the Bed's Fee^ He immediately took the only Method of silencin^ this thorough Bass, whose Music he feared might disturb Mr. Allworthy; and then sitting down by the Nurse, he remained motionless till Blifil and the Do^ter came in together, and waked the sick Man; order that the Doctor might feel his Pulse, and tha^ the other might communicate to him that Piece o^ News, which, had Jones been apprized of it, would have had great Difficulty of finding its Way to Mr^ Allworthy's Ear at such a Season.  When he first heard Blifil tell his Uncle this Story Jones could hardly contain the Wrath which kindle^ in him at the other's Indiscretion, especially as the Doctor shook his Head, and declared his Unwillingness to have the Matter mentioned to his Patient. But as his Passion did not so far deprive him of all Use of his Understanding, as to hide from him the Consequences which any violent Expressions toward Blifil might have on the Sick, this Apprehension stilled his Rage, at the present; and he grew afterward so satisfied with finding that his News had, in fact produced no Mischief, that he suffered his Anger to die in his own Bosom, without ever mentioning it to Blifil.  The Physician dined that Day at Mr. Allworthy's and having after Dinner visited his Patient, he returned to the Company, and told them, that he had not the Satisfaction to say, with Assurance; that his Patient was out of all Danger: That he had brought his Fever to a perfect Intermission, and doubted not by throwing in the Bark to prevent its return.  This Account so pleased Jones, and threw him into such immoderate Excess of Rapture, that he might be truly said to be drunk with Joy. An Intoxication which greatly forwards the Effects of Wine; and as he was very free too with the Bottle on this Occasion, (for he drank many Bumpers to the Doctor's Health, as well as to other Toasts) he became very soon literally drunk.  Jones had naturally violent animal Spirits. These being set on Float, and augmented by the Spirit of Wine, produced most extravagant Effects. He kissed the Doctor, and embraced him with the most passionate Endearments; swearing that, next to Mr. Allworthy himself, he loved him of all Men living.' 'Doctor,' added he, 'you deserve a Statue to be erected to you at the public Expense, for having preserved a Man, who is not only the Darling of all good Men who know him, but a Blessing to Society, the Glory of his Country, and an Honor to human Nature. D -- n me if I don't love him better than my own Soul.'  'More shame for you,' cries Thwackum. 'Though I think you have reason to love him, for he has provided very well for you. And, perhaps, it might have been better for some Folks, that he had not lived to see just Reason of revoking his Gift.'  Jones now looking on Thwackum with inconceivable Disdain, answered, 'And does thy mcan Soul imagine that any such Considerations could weigh with me? No, let the Earth open and swallow her own Dirt (if I had Millions of Acres I would say it) rather than swallow up my dear glorious Friend.'  Quis Desiderio sit Pudor aut modus Tam chari Capitis? 'What Modesty, or Measure, can set Bounds to our Desire of so dear a Friend!' The Word Desiderium here cannot be easily translated. It includes our Desire of enjoying our Friend again, and the Grief which attends that Desire.  The Doctor now interposed, and prevented the Effects of a Wrath which was kindling between Jones and Thwackum; after which the former gave a Loose to Mirth, sang two or three amorous Songs, and fell into every frantic Disorder which unbridled Joy is apt to inspire; but so far was he from any Disposition to quarrel, that he was ten times better humoured, if possible, than when he was sober.  To say Truth, nothing is more erroneous than the common Observation, That Men who are ill-natured and quarrelsome when they are drunk, are very worthy Persons when they are sober: For Drink, in reality, does not reverse Nature, or create Passions in Men, which did not exist in them before. It takes away the Guard of Reason, and consequently forces us to produce those Symptoms, which many, when sober, have Art enough to conceal. It heightens and inflames our Passions (generally indeed that Passion which is uppermost in our Mind) so that the angry Temper, the amorous, the generous, the good humoured, the avaricious, and all other Dispositions of Men, are in their Cups heightened and exposed.  And yet as no Nation produces so many drunken Quarrels, especially among the lower People, as England; (for, indeed, with them, to drink and to fight together are almost synonimous Terms;) I would not, methinks, have it thence concluded that the English are the worst-natured People alive. Perhaps the Love of Glory only is at the Bottom of this; so that the fair Conclusion seems to be, that our Countrymen have more of that Love, and more of Bravery, than any other Plebeians. And this the rather, as there is seldom any thing ungenerous, unfair, or ill-natured, exercised on those Occasions: Nay, it is common for the Combatants to express Good Will for each other, even at the Time of the Conflict; and as their drunken Mirth generally ends in a Battle, so do most of their Battles end in Friendship.  But to return to our History. Though Jones had shown no Design of giving Offense, yet Mr. Blifil was highly offended at a Behavior which was so inconsistent with the sober and prudent Reserve of his own Temper. He bore it too with the greater Impatience, as it appeared to him very indecent at this Season; 'when,' as he said, 'the House was a House of Mourning, on the Account of his dear Mother; and if it had pleased Heaven to give them some Prospect of Mr. Allworthy's Recovery, it would become them better to express the Exultations of their Hearts in Thanksgiving than in Drunkenness and Riots; which were properer Methods to increase the divine Wrath, than to avert it.' Thwackum, who had swallowed more Liquor than Jones, but without any ill Effect on his Brain, seconded the pious Harangue of Blifil; but Square for Reasons which the Reader may probably guess, was totally silent.  Wine had not so totally overpowered Jones, as to prevent his recollecting on Mr. Blifil's Loss, the Moment it was mentioned. As no Person, therefore, was more ready to confess and condemn his own Errors, he offered to shake Mr. Blifil by the Hand, and begged his Pardon, saying, 'His excessive Joy for Mr. Allworthy's Recovery had driven every other Thought out of his Mind.'  Blifil scornfully rejected his Hand; and, with much Indignation, answered, 'It was little to be wondered at, if tragical Spectacles made no Impressions on the Blind; but for his Part, he had the Misfortune to know who his Parents were, and consequently must be affected with their Loss.'  Jones, who, notwithstanding his good Humor, had some Mixture of the irascible in his Constitution, leaped hastily from his Chair, and catching hold of Blifil's Collar, cried out, 'D -- n you for a Rascal, do you insult me with the Misfortune of my Birth' He accompanied these Words with such rough Actions, that they soon got the better of Mr. Blifil's peaceable Temper; and a Scuffle immediately ensued, which might have produced Mischief, had it not been prevented by the Interposition of Thwackum and the Physician; for the Philosophy of Square rendered him superior to all Emotions, and he very calmly smoaked his Pipe, as was his Custom in all Broils, unless when he apprehended some Danger of having it broke in his Mouth.  The Combatants being now prevented from executing present Vengeance on each other, betook themselves to the common Resources of disappointed Rage, and vented their Wrath in Threats and Defiance. In this kind of Conflict, Fortune, which, in the personal Attack, seemed to incline to Jones, was now altogether as favorable to his Enemy.  A Truce, nevertheless was at length agreed on, by the Mediation of the neutral Parties, and the whole Company again sat down at the Table; where Jones being prevailed on to ask Pardon, and Blifil to give it, Peace was restored and every thing seemed in Statu quo.  But though the Quarrel was, in all Appearance, perfectly reconciled, the good humor which had been interrupted by it, was by no means restored. All Merriment was now at an End, and the subsequent Discourse consisted only of grave Relations of Matters of Fact, and of as grave Observations upon them. A Species of Conversation, in which, though there is much of Dignity and Instruction, there is but little Entertainment. As we presume, therefore, only to convey this last to the Reader, we shall pass by whatever was said, till the rest of the Company having, by Degrees, dropped off, left Square and the Physician only together; at which Time the Conversation was a little heightened by some Comments on what had happened between the two young Gentlemen; both of whom the Doctor declared to be no better than Scoundrels; to which Appellation the Philosopher, very sagaciously shaking his Head, agreed.  CHAP. X. Showing the Truth of many Observations of Ovid, and of other more grave Writers, who have proved, beyond Contradiction, that Wine is often the Forerunner of Incontinency.  JONES retired from the Company, in which we have seen him engaged, into the Fields, where he intended to cool himself by a Walk in the open Air, before he attended Mr. Allworthy. There, whilst he renewed those Meditations on his dear Sophia, which the dangerous Illness of his Friend and Benefactor had for some time interrupted, an Accident happened, which with Sorrow, we relate, and with Sorrow, doubtless, will it be read; however, that historic Truth to which we profess so inviolable an Attachment, obliges us to communicate it to Posterity.  It was now a pleasant Evening in the latter End of June, when our Hero was walking in a most delicious Grove, where the gentle Breezes fanning the Leaves, together with the sweet Trilling of a murmuring Stream, and the melodious Notes of Nightingales formed all together the most enchanting Harmony. In this Scene, so sweetly accommodated to Love, he meditated on his dear Sophia. While his wanton Fancy roved unbounded over all her Beauties, and his lively Imagination painted the charming Maid in various ravishing Forms his warm Heart melted with Tenderness, and at length throwing himself on the ground by the Side of a gentle murmuring Brook, he broke forth into the following Ejaculation.  'O Sophia, would Heaven give thee to my Arms, how blessed would be my Condition! Cursed be that Fortune which sets a Distance between us. Was I but possessed of thee, one only Suit of Rags thy whole Estate, is there a Man on Earth whom I would envy! How contemptible would the brightest Circassian Beauty, dressed in all the Jewels of the Indies, appear to my Eyes! But why do I mention another Woman? could I think my Eyes capable of looking at any other with Tenderness, these Hands should tear them from my Head. No, my Sophia, if cruel Fortune separates us for ever, my Soul shall dote on thee alone. The chastest Constancy will I ever preserve to thy Image. Though I should never have Possession of thy charming Person, still shall thou alone have Possession of my Thoughts, my Love, my Soul. Oh! my fond Heart is so wrapped in that tender Bosom, that the brightest Beauties would for me have no Charms, nor would a hermit be colder in their Embraces. Sophia, Sophia alone shall be mine. What Raptures are in that Name! I will engrave it on every Tree.'  At these Words he started up, and behold -- not his Sophia -- no, nor a Circassian Maid richly and elegantly attired for the Grand Signior's Seraglio. No; without a Gown, in a Shift that was somewhat of the coarsest, and none of the cleanest, bedewed likewise with some odoriferous Effluvia, the Produce of the Day's Labor, with a Pitch-fork in her Hand, Molly Seagrim approached. Our Hero had his Penknife in his Hand, which he had drawn for the beforementioned Purpose, of carving on the Bark; when the Girl coming near him cried out with a Smile, 'You don't intend to kill me, Squire I hope!' 'Why should you think I would kill you?' answered Jones. 'Nay,' replied she, 'after your cruel Usage of me when I saw you last, killing me would, perhaps, be too great Kindness for me to expect.'  Here ensued a Parley, which, as I do not think myself obliged to relate, I shall omit. It is sufficient that it lasted a full Quarter of an Hour, at the Conclusion of which they retired into the thickest Part of the Grove.  Some of my Readers may be inclined to think this Event unnatural. However, the Fact is true; and, perhaps, may be sufficiently accounted for, by suggesting that Jones probably thought one Woman better than none, and Molly as probably imagined two Men to be better than one. Besides the before mentioned Motive assigned to the present Behavior of Jones, the Reader will be likewise pleased to recollect in his Favor, that he was not at this Time perfect Master of that wonderful Power of Reason, which so well enables grave and wise Men to subdue their unruly Passions, and to decline any of these prohibited Amusements. Wine now had totally subdued this Power in Jones. He was, indeed, in a Condition, in which if Reason had interposed, though only to advise, she might have received the Answer which one Cleostratus gave many Years ago to a silly Fellow, who asked him if he was not ashamed to be drunk? 'Are not you,' said Cleostratus, 'ashamed to admonish a drunken Man?' -- To say the Truth, in a Court of Justice, Drunkenness must not be an Excuse, yet in a Court of Conscience it is greatly so; and therefore Aristotle, who commends the Laws of Pittacus, by which drunken Men received double Punishment for their Crimes, allows there is more of Policy than Justice in that Law. Now, if there are any Transgressions pardonable from Drunkenness, they are certainly such as Mr. Jones was at present guilty of; on which Head I could pour forth a vast Profusion of Learning, if I imagined it would either entertain my Reader, or teach him any Thing more than he knows already. For his Sake, therefore, I shall keep my Learning to myself, and return to my History.  It has been observed, that Fortune seldom does* Things by Halves. To say Truth, there is no^ End to her Freaks whenever she is disposed to gratify or displease. No sooner had our Hero retired with his Dido, but Speluncam Blifil, Dux et Divinus eandem Deveniunt. -- the Parson and the young 'Squire, who were taking a serious Walk, arrived at the Style which leads into the Grove, and the latter caught a View of the Lovers, just as they were sinking out of Sight.  Blifil knew Jones very well, though he was at above a hundred Yards Distance, and he was as positive to the Sex of his Companion, though not to the individual Person. He started; blessed himself, and uttered a very solemn Ejaculation.  Thwackum expressed some Surprise at these sudden Emotions, and asked the Reason of them. To which Blifil answered, 'he was certain he had seen a Fellow and Wench retire together among the Bushes, which he doubted not was with some wicked Purpose.' As to the Name of Jones, he thought proper to conceal it, and why he did so must be left to the Judgment of the sagacious Reader: For we never choose to assign Motives to the Actions of Men, when there is any possibility of our being mistaken.  The Parson, who was not only strictly chaste in his own Person; but a great Enemy to the opposite Vice in all others, fired at this Information. He desired Mr. Blifil to conduct him immediately to the Place, which as he approached, he breathed forth Vengeance mixed with Lamentations; nor did he refrain from casting some oblique Reflections on Mr^ Allworthy; insinuating that the Wickedness of the Country was principally owing to the Encouragement he had given to Vice, by having exerted such Kindness to a Bastard, and by having mitigated that just and wholesome Rigor of the Law, which allots a very severe Punishment to loose Wenches.  The Way, through which our Hunters were to pass in pursuit of their Game, was so beset with Briars, that it greatly obstructed their Walk, and caused, besides, such a rustling that Jones had sufficient Warning of their Arrival, before they could surprise him; nay, indeed, so incapable was Thwackum of concealing his Indignation, and such Vengeance did he mutter forth every Step he took, that this alone must have abundantly satisfied Jones, that he was (to use the Language of Sportsmen) found sitting.  CHAP. XI. In which a Simile in Mr. Pope 's Period of a Mile, introduces as bloody a Battle as can possibly be fought, without the Assistance of Steel or cold Iron.  AS in the Season of RUTTING (an uncouth Phrase, by which the Vulgar denote that gentle Dalliance, which in the This is an ambiguous Phrase, and may mean either a Forest well clothed with Wood, or well stripped of it. well-wooded Forest of Hampshire, passes between Lovers of the Ferine Kind) if while the lofty chrested Stag meditates the amorous Sport, a Couple of Puppies, or any other Beasts of hostile Note, should wander so near the Temple of Venus Ferina, that the fair Hind should shrink from the Place, touched with that somewhat, either of Fear or Frolic, of Nicety or Skittishness, with which Nature has bedecked all Females, or has, at least, instructed them how themselves to put on; lest, through the Indelicacy of Males, the Samean Mysteries should be pryed into by unhallowed Eyes: For at the celebration of these Rites, the female Priestess cries out with her in Virgil (who was then probably hard at Work on such Celebration)  -- Procul, O procul este, profani; Proclamat Vates, totoque absistite Luco. -- Far hence be Souls profane, The Sibyl cried, and from the Grove abstain. DRYDEN.  If, I say, while these sacred Rites, which are in common to Genus omne Animantium, are in Agitation between the Stag and his Mistress, any hostile Beasts should venture too near, on the first Hint given by the frighted Hind, fierce and tremendous rushes forth the Stag to the Entrance of the Thicket; there stands he Sentinel over his Love, stamps the Ground with his Foot, and with his Horns brandished aloft in Air, proudly provokes the apprehended Foe to Combat.  Thus, and more terrible, when he perceived the Enemy's Approach, leaped forth our Hero. Many a Step advanced he forwards, in order to conceal the trembling Hind, and, if possible, to secure her Retreat. And now Thwackum having first darted some livid Lightning from his fiery Eyes, began to thunder forth, 'Fie upon it! Fie upon it! Mr. Jones. Is it possible you should be the Person!' 'You see,' answered Jones, 'it is possible I should be here.' 'And who,' said Thwackum, 'is that wicked Slut with you?' 'If I have any wicked Slut with me,' cries Jones, it is possible I shall not let you know who she is.' 'I command you to tell me immediately,' says Thwackum, 'and I would not have you imagine young Man, that your Age, though it has somewhat abridged the Purpose of Tuition, has totally taken away the Authority of the Master. The Relation of the Master and Scholar is indelible, as indeed, all other Relations are: For they all derive their Original from Heaven. I would have you think yourself, therefore, as much obliged to obey me now, as when I taught you your first Rudiments.' 'I believe you would,' cries Jones, 'but that will not happen, unless you had the same Birchen Argument to convince me.' 'Then I must tell you plainly,' said Thwackum, 'I am resolved to discover the wicked Wretch.' 'And I must tell you plainly,' returned Jones, 'I am resolved you shall not.' Thwackum then offered to advance, and Jones laid hold of his Arms; which Mr. Blifil endeavored to rescue, declaring 'he would not see his old Master insulted.'  Jones now finding himself engaged with two, thought it necessary to rid himself of one of his Antagonists as soon as possible. He therefore, applied to the weakest first; and letting the Parson go, he directed a Blow at the young Squire's Breast, which luckily taking Place, reduced him to measure his Length on the Ground.  Thwackum was so intent on the Discovery, that the Moment he found himself at Liberty, he stepped forward directly into the Fern, without any great Consideration of what might, in the mean Time, befall his Friend; but he had advanced a very few Paces into the Thicket, before Jones having defeated Blifil, overtook the Parson, and dragged him backward by the Skirt of his Coat.  This Parson had been a Champion in his Youth, and had won much Honor by his Fist, both at School and at the University. He had now, indeed, for a great Number of Years, declined the practice of that noble Art; yet was his Courage full as strong as his Faith, and his Body no less strong than either. He was moreover, as the Reader may, perhaps, have conceived, somewhat irascible in his Nature. When he looked back, therefore, and saw his Friend stretched out on the Ground, and found himself at the same Time so roughly handled by one who had formerly been only passive in all Conflicts between them, (a Circumstance which highly aggravated the whole) his Patience at length gave Way; he threw himself into a Posture of Offense, and collecting all his Force, attacked Jones in the Front, with as much Impetuosity as he had formerly attacked him in the Rear.  Our Hero received the Enemy's Attack with the most undaunted Intrepidity, and his Bosom resounded with the Blow. This he presently returned with no less Violence, aiming likewise at the Parson's Breast; but he dexterously drove down the Fist of Jones, so that it reached only his Belly, where two Pounds of Beef and as many of Pudding were then deposited, and whence consequently no hollow Sound could proceed. Many lusty Blows, much more pleasant as well as easy to have seen, than to read or describe, were given on both Sides; at last a violent Fall in which Jones had thrown his Knees into Thwackum's Breast, so weakened the latter, that Victory had been no longer dubious, had not Blifil, who had now recovered his Strength, again renewed the Fight, and, by engaging with Jones, given the Parson a Moment's Time to shake his Ears, and to regain his Breath.  And now both together attacked our Hero, whose Blows did not retain that Force with which they had fallen at first; so weakened was he by his Combat with Thwackum: For though the Pedagogue chose rather to play Solos on the human Instrument, and had been lately used to those only, yet he still retained enough of his ancient Knowledge to perform his Part very well in a Duet.  The Victory, according to modern Custom, was like to be decided by Numbers, when on a sudden, a fourth Pair of Fists appeared in the Battle, and immediately paid their Compliments to the Parson; the Owner of them, at the same Time, crying out,' Are not you ashamed and be d -- nd to you, to fall two of you upon one?  The Battle, which was of the Kind, that for Distinction's Sake is called ROYAL, now raged with the utmost Violence during a few Minutes; till Blifil being a second Time laid sprawling by Jones, Thwachum condescended to apply for Quarter to his new Antagonist, who was now found to be Mr. Western himself: For in the Heat of the Action none of the Combatants had recognized him.  In Fact, that honest 'Squire, happening in his Afternoon's Walk with some Company, to pass through the Field where the bloody Battle was fought, and having concluded from seeing three Men engaged, that two of them must be on a Side, he hastened from his Companions, and with more Gallantry than Policy, espoused the Cause of the weaker Party. By which generous Proceeding, he very probably prevented Mr. Jones from becoming a Victim to the Wrath of Thwackum, and to the pious Friendship which Blifil bore his old Master: For besides the Disadvantage of such Odds, Jones had not yet sufficiently recovered the former Strength of his broken Arm. This Reinforcement, however, soon put an End to the Action, and Jones with his Ally obtained the Victory.  CHAP. XII. In which is seen a more moving Spectacle, than all the Blood in the Bodies of Thwackum and Blifil and of twenty other such, is capable of producing.  THE rest of Mr. Western's Company were now come up, being just at the Instant when the Action was over. These were the honest Clergyman, whom we have formerly seen at Mr. Western's Table, Mrs. Western the Aunt of Sophia; and lastly, the lovely Sophia herself.  At this Time, the following was the Aspect of the bloody Field. In one Place, lay on the Ground, all pale and almost breathless, the vanquished Blifil. Near him stood the Conqueror Jones, almost covered with Blood, part of which was naturally his own, and part had been lately the Property of the Reverend Mr. Thwackum. In a third Place stood the said Thwackum, like King Porus, sullenly submitting to the Conqueror. The last Figure in the Piece was Western the Great, most gloriously forbearing the vanquished Foe.  Blifil, in whom there was little Sign of Life, was at first the principal Object of the Concern of every one, and particularly of Mrs. Western, who had drawn from her Pocket a Bottle of Hartshorn, and was herself about to apply it to his Nostrils; when on a sudden the Attention of the whole Company was diverted from poor Blifil, whose Spirit, if it had any such Design, might have now taken an Opportunity of stealing off to the other World, without any Ceremony.  For now a more melancholy as more lovely Object lay motionless before them. This was no other than the charming Sophia herself, who, from the Sight of Blood, or from Fear of her Father, or from some other Reason, had fallen down in a Swoon, before any one could get to her Assistance.  Mrs. Western first saw her, and screamed. Immediately two or three Voices cried out, 'Miss Western is dead.' Hartshorn, Water; every Remedy was called for, almost at one and the same Instant.  The Reader may remember, that in our Description of this Grove, we mentioned a murmuring Brook, which Brook did not come there, as such gentle Streams flow through vulgar Romances, with no other Purpose than to murmur. No; Fortune had decreed to enoble this little Brook with a higher Honor than any of those which wash the Plains of Arcadia, ever deserved.  Jones was rubbing Blifil's Temples: For he began to fear he had given him a Blow too much, when the Words Miss Western and Death rushed at once on his Ear. He started up, left Blifil to his Fate, and flew to Sophia, whom, while all the rest were running against each other backward and forward looking for Water in the dry Paths, he caught up in his Arms, and then ran away with her over the Field to the Rivulet abovementioned: where, plunging himself into the Water, he contrived to besprinkle her Face, Head, and Neck very plentifully.  Happy was it for Sophia, that the same Confusion which prevented her other Friends from serving her, prevented them likewise from obstructing Jones. He had carried her half ways before they knew what he was doing, and he had actually restored her to Life before they reached the Waterside: She stretched out her Arms, opened her Eyes and cried, 'Oh, Heavens!' just as her Father, Aunt and the Parson came up.  Jones, who had hitherto held this lovely Burden in his Arms, now relinquished his Hold; but gave her at the same Instant a tender Caress, which, had her Senses been then perfectly restored, could not have escaped her Observation. As she expressed, therefore no Displeasure at this Freedom, we suppose she was not sufficiently recovered from her Swoon at the Time.  This tragical Scene was now converted into a sudden Scene of Joy. In this, our Hero was most certainly, the principal Character: For he probably felt more extatic Delight in having saved Sophia, than she herself received from being saved; so neither were the Congratulations paid to her, equal to what were conferred on Jones, especially by Mr. Western himself, who, after having once or twice embraced his Daughter, fell to hugging and kissing Jones. He called him the preserver of Sophia, and declared there was nothing except her, or his Estate, which he would not give him; but upon Recollection, he afterward excepted his Fox-hounds, the Chevalier, and Miss Slouch (for so he called his favorite Mare.)  All Fears for Sophia being now removed, Jones became the Object of the 'Squire's Consideration. 'Come, my Lad,' says Western, 'D'off thy Quoat and wash thy Feace: For at in a devilish Pickle, I promise thee. Come, come, wash thyself, and shat go Huome with me; and well zee to vind thee another Quoat.'  Jones immediately complied; threw off his Coat, went down to the Water, and washed both his Face and Bosom: For the latter was as much exposed, and as bloody as the former: But though the Water could clear off the Blood, it could not remove the Black and blue Marks which Thwackum had imprinted on both his Face and Breast, and which, being discerned by Sophia, drew from her a Sigh, and a look full of inexpressible Tenderness.  Jones received this full in his Eyes, and it had infinitely a stronger Effect on him than all the Contusions which he had received before. An Effect, however, widely different; for so soft and balmy was it, that, had all his former Blows been Stabs, it would for some Minutes have prevented his feeling their Smart.  The Company now moved backwards, and soon arrived where Thwackum had got Mr. Blifil again on his Legs. Here we cannot suppress a pious Wish, that all Quarrels were to be decided by those Weapons only, with which Nature, knowing what is proper for us, has supplied us; and that cold Iron was to be used in digging no Bowels, but those of the Earth. Then would War, the Pastime of Monarchs, be almost inoffensive, and Battles between great Armies might be fought at the particular Desire of several Ladies of Quality; who together with the Kings themselves, might be actual Spectators of the Conflict. Then might the Field be this Moment well strewed with human Carcasses, and the next, ^he dead Men, or infinitely the greatest Part of them, ^ight get up, like Mr. Bayes's Troops, and march if either at the Sound of a Drum or a Fiddle, as could be previously agreed on.  I would avoid, if possible, treating this Matter lu^^crously, lest grave Men and Politicians, whom I now to be offended at a Jest, may cry Pish at it; ^ot, in reality, might not a Battle be as well decided ^^y the greater Number of broken Heads, bloody ^oses, and black Eyes, as by the greater Heaps of ^^angled and murdered human Bodies? Might not Towns be contended for in the same Manner? Indeed, this may be too detrimental a Scheme to the French Interest, since they would lose the Advantage ^^ey have over other Nations, in the Superiority of ^^eir Engineers: But when I consider the Gallantry and Generosity of that People, I am persuaded they ^ould never decline putting themselves upon a Par with their Adversary; or, as the Phrase is, making themselves his Match.  But such Reformations are rather to be wished ^an hoped for; I shall content myself, therefore, with this short Hint, and return to my Narrative.  Western began now to enquire into the original Rise ^f this Quarrel. To which neither Blifil nor Jones ^ave any Answer; but Thwackum said surlily, 'I believe, the Cause is not far off; if you beat the Bushes well you may find her.' 'Find her!' re^lied Western, 'what have you been fighting for a Wench?' 'Ask the Gentleman in his Wastecoat there,' said Thwackum, 'he best knows.' 'Nay, then,' cries Western, 'it is a Wench certainly -- Ah, Tom, Tom; thou art a liquorish Dog -- but come, Gentlemen, be all Friends, and go home with me, and make final Peace over a Bottle.' 'I ask your Pardon, Sir,' says Thwackum, 'it is n^ such slight Matter for a Man of my Character to be thus injuriously treated, and buffetted by a Boy only because I would have done my Duty, in endeavoring to detect and bring to Justice a wanton Harlot; but, indeed, the principal Fault lies in Mr. Allworthy and yourself: For, if you put the Laws in Execution, as you ought to do, you would soon ri^^ the Country of these Vermin.'  'I would as soon rid the Country of Foxes,' cries Western. 'I think we ought to encourage the recruiting those Numbers which we are every Day losing in the War: But where is she? -- Prithee, Tom, show me.' He then began to beat about, in the same Language, and in the same Manner, as if he had been beating for a Hare, and at last cried out, 'Soho! Puss is not far off. Here Is her Form, upon my Soul; I believe I may cry stole away.' And indeed so he might, for he had now discovered the Place whence the poor Girl had, at the Beginning of the Fray, stolen away, upon as many Feet as a Hare generally uses in traveling.  Sophia now desired her Father to return home; saying, she found herself very faint, and apprehended a Relapse. The Squire immediately complied with his Daughter's Request (for he was the fondest of Parents). He earnestly endeavored to prevail with the whole Company to go and sup with him; but Blifil and Thwackum absolutely refused; the former saying, There were more Reasons than he could then mention, why he must decline this Honor; and the latter declaring (perhaps rightly) that it was not proper for a Person of his Function to be seen at any Place in his present Condition.  Jones was incapable of refusing the Pleasure of being with his Sophia. So on he marched with Squire Western and his Ladies, the Parson bringing up the Rear. This had, indeed, offered to tarry with his Brother Thwackum, professing, his Regard for the Cloth would not permit him to depart; but Thwackum would not accept the Favor, and, with no great Civility, pushed him after Mr. Western.  Thus ended this bloody Fray; and thus shall end the fifth Book of this History.  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING BOOK VI. Containing about three Weeks.  CHAP. I. Of Love.  IN our last Book we have been obliged to deal pretty much with the Passion of Love; and, in our succeeding Book, shall be forced to handle this Subject still more largely. It may not therefore, in this Place, be improper to apply ourselves to the Examination of that modern Doctrine, by which certain Philosophers, among many other wonderful Discoveries, pretend to have found out, that there is no such Passion in the human Breast.  Whether these Philosophers be the same with that surprising Sect, who are honorably mentioned by the late Dr. Swift; as having, by the mere Force of Genius alone, without the least Assistance of any Kind of Learning, or even Reading, discovered that profound and invaluable Secret, That there was no G --: or whether they are not rather she same with those who, some Years since, very much alarmed the World, by showing that there were no such things as virtue or Goodness really existing in Human Nature, and who deduced our best Actions from Pride, I will not here presume to determine. In reality, I am inclined to suspect, that all these several Finders of Truth are the very identical Men, who are by others called the Finders of Gold. The Method used in both these Searches after Truth and after Gold, being, indeed, one and the same, viz. the searching, rummaging, and examining into a nasty Place; indeed, in the former Instances, into the nastiest of all Places, ABAD MIND.  But though, in this Particular, and perhaps in their Success, the Truth-finder, and the Gold-finder, may very properly be compared together; yet in Modesty, surely, there can be no Comparison between the two; for who ever heard of a Gold-finder that had the Impudence or Folly to assert, from the ill Success of his Search, that there was no such thing as Gold in the World? Whereas the Truth-finder, having raked out that Jakes his own Mind, and being there capable of tracing no Ray of Divinity, nor any thing virtuous, or good, or lovely, or loving, very fairly, honestly, and logically concludes, that no such things exist in the whole Creation.  To avoid, however, all Contention, if possible, with these Philosophers, if they will be called so; and to show our own Disposition to accommodate Matters peaceably between us, we shall here make them some Concessions, which may possibly put an End to the Dispute.  First, we will grant that many Minds, and perhaps those of the Philosophers, are entirely free from the least Traces of such a Passion.  Secondly, That what is commonly called Love, namely, the Desire of satisfying a voracious Appetite with a certain Quantity of delicate white human Flesh, is by no Means that Passion for which I here contend. This is indeed more properly Hunger^ and as no Glutton is ashamed to apply the Word Love to his Appetite, and to say he LOVES such and such Dishes; so may the Lover of this Kind with equal Propriety say, he HUNGERS after such and such Women.  Thirdly, I will grant, which I believe will be a most acceptable Concession, that this Love for which I am an Advocate, though it satisfies itself in a much more delicate Manner, does nevertheless seek its own Satisfaction as much as the grossest of all our Appetites.  And, Lastly, That this Love when it operates toward one of a different Sex, is very apt, toward its complete Gratification, to call in the Aid of that Hunger which I have mentioned above; and which it is so far from abating, that it heightens all its Delights to a Degree scarce imaginable by those who have never been susceptible of any other Emotions, than what have proceeded from Appetite alone.  In return to all these Concessions, I desire of the Philosophers to grant, that there is in some (I believe in many) human Breasts, a kind and benevolent Disposition, which is gratified by contributing to the Happiness of others. That in this Gratification alone, as in Friendship, in parental and filial Affection, and indeed in general Philanthropy, there is a great and exquisite Delight. That if we will not call such Disposition Love, we have no Name for it. That though the Pleasures arising from such pure Love may be hightened and sweetened by the Assistance of amorous Desires, yet the former can subsist alone, nor are they destroyed by the Intervention of the latter. Lastly, That Esteem and Gratitude are the proper Motives to Love, as Youth and Beauty are to Desire, and therefore though such Desire may naturally cease, when Age or Sickness overtake its Object, yet these ^an have no Effect on Love, nor ever shake or remove from a good Mind, that Sensation or Passion which ^ath Gratitude and Esteem for its Basis.  To deny the Existence of a Passion of which we often see manifest Iustances, seems to be very strange and absurd; and can indeed proceed only from that self-Admonition which we have mentioned above: But how unfair is this? Does the Man who recog^izes in his own Heart no Traces of Avarice or Ambition, conclude therefore, that there are no such Passions in Human Nature? Why will we not modestly observe the same Rule in judging of the Good, as well as the Evil of others; Or why, in any Case, will ^^e, as Shakespeare phrases it, 'put the World in our own Person?'  Predominant Vanity is, I am afraid, too much concerned here. This is one Instance of that Adulation which we bestow on our own Minds, and this almost universally. For there is scarce any Man, how much soever he may despise the Character of a Flatterer, but will condescend in the meanest Manner to flatter himself.  To those, therefore, I apply for the Truth of the above Observations, whose own Minds can bear Testimony to what I have advanced.  Examine your Heart, my good Reader, and resolve whether you do believe these Matters with me. If you do, you may now proceed to their Exemplification in the following Pages; if you do not, you have, I assure you, already read more than you have understood; and it would be wiser to pursue your Business, or your Pleasures (such as they are) than to throw away any more of your Time in reading what you can neither taste nor comprehend. To treat of the Effects of Love to you, must be as absurd as to discourse on Colors to a Man born blind; since possibly your Idea of Love may be as absurd as that which we are told such blind Man once entertained of the Color Red: that Color seemed to him to be very much like the Sound of a Trumpet; and Love probably may in your Opinion, very greatly resemble a Dish o^ Soup, or a Sir-loin of Roast-Beef.  CHAP. II. The Character of Mrs. Western. Her great Learning and Knowledge of the World, and an Instand of the deep Penetration which she derived from those Advantages.  THE Reader has seen Mr. Western, his Sister and Daughter, with young Jones, and the Parson, going together to Mr. Western's House, where the greater Part of the Company spent the Evening with much Joy and Festivity. Sophia was indeed the only grave Person: For as to Jones, though Love had now gotten entire Possession of his Heart, yet the pleasing Reflection on Mr. Allworthy's Recovery, and the Presence of his Mistress, joined to some tender Looks which she now and then could not refrain from giving him, so elevated our Hero, that he joined the Mirth of the other three, who were perhaps as good humoured People as any in the World.  Sophia retained the same Gravity of Countenance the next Morning at Breakfast; whence she retired likewise earlier than usual, leaving her Father and Aunt together. The Squire took no Notice of this Change in his Daughter's Disposition. To say the Truth, though he was somewhat of a Politician, and had been twice a Candidate in the Country Interest at an Election, he was a Man of no great Observation. His Sister was a Lady of a different Turn. She had lived about the Court, and had seen the World. Hence she had acquired all that Knowledge which the said World usually communicates; and was a perfect Mistress of Manners, Customs, Ceremonies, and Fashions; nor did her Erudition stop here. She had considerably improved her Mind by Study; she had not only ^ead all the modern Plays, Operas, Oratorios, Poems and Romances; in all which she was a Critic; but ^ad gone through Rapin's History of England, Echard's Roman History, and many French Memoires pour ser^ir a l' Histoire; to these she had added most of the political Pamphlets and Journals, published within the last twenty Years. From which she had attained every competent Skill in Politics, and could discourse very learnedly on the Affairs of Europe. She was moreover excellently well skilled in the Doctrine of Amor, and knew better than any body who and who were together: A Knowledge which she the more easily attained, as her Pursuit of it was never diverted by any Affairs of her own; for either she had no Inclinations, or these had never been solicited; which last is indeed very probable: For her masculine Person, which was near six Foot high, added to her Manner and Learning, possibly prevented the other Sex from regarding her, notwithstanding her Petticoats, in the Light of a Woman. However, as she had considered the Matter scientifically, she perfectly well knew, though she had never practiced them, all the Arts which fine Ladies use when they desire to give Encouragement, or to conceal Liking, with all the long Appendage of Smiles, Ogles, Glances, etc. as they are at present practiced in the Beau-monde. To sum the whole, no Species of Disguise or Affectation had escaped her Notice; but as to the plain simple Workings of honest Nature, as she had never seen any such, she could know but little of them.  By means of this wonderful Sagacity, Mrs. Western had now, as she thought, made a Discovery of something in the Mind of Sophia. The first Hint of this she took from the Behavior of the young Lady in the field of Battle; and the Suspicion which she then conceived, was greatly corroborated by some Observations which she had made that Evening, and the next Morning. However, being greatly cautious to avoid being found in a Mistake, she carried the Secret a whole Fortnight in her Bosom, giving only some oblique Hints, by Simperings, Winks, Nods and now and then dropping an obscure Word, which indeed sufficiently alarmed Sophia, but did not at all affect her Brother.  Being at length, however, thoroughly satisfied of the Truth of her Observation, she took an Opportunity, one Morning, when she was alone with her Brother, to interrupt one of his Whistles in the following Manner.  'Pray, Brother, have you not observed something very extraordinary in my Niece lately?' 'No, not I,' answered Western; 'Is any thing the Matter with the Girl? I think there is,' replies she, 'and something of much Consequence too.' 'Why she does not complain of any Thing', cries Western, 'and she has had the Small Pox.' 'Brother,' returned she, 'Girls are liable to other Distempers besides the Small Pox, and sometimes possibly to much worse.' Here Western interrupted her with much Earnestness, and begged her, if any thing ailed his Daughter, to acquaint him immediately, adding, 'she knew he loved her more than his own Soul, and that he would send to the World's End for the best Physician to her.' 'Nay, nay, answered she, smiling, 'the Distemper is not so terrible; but I believe, Brother, you are convinced I know the World, and I promise you I was never more deceived in my Life, if my Niece be not most desperately in Love.' 'How! in Love,' cries Western, in a Passion, 'in Love without acquainting me!
