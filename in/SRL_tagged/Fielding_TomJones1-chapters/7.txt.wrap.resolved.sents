This i^ my Reward for taking my Reward Part so often, when a^ the Country have cried Shame of my Reward for breeding up my Reward Bastard in that Manner; but my Reward is going now where my Reward must pay for all.
It would have be comed my Reward better to have repented of my Reward Sins o^ my Reward Deathbed, than to glory in them, and give ^ way my Reward Estate out of my Reward own Family to a mis-be gotten Child.

Marry co^^ up with such Gentlemen!

The Devil shall wait upon such Gentlemen for the Servant.'
Much more of the like kind she muttered to she; but this Taste shall suffice to the Reader.
Neither Thwackum nor Square were much bet^ satisfied with Thwackum nor Square Legacies.
Though Thwackum nor Square breath not Thwackum nor Square Resentment so loud, yet from the Discont^ which appeared in Thwackum nor Square Countenances, as well from the following Dialogue, we collect that no g^ Pleasure reigned in Thwackum nor Square Minds.
About an Hour after Thwackum nor Square had left the sick Room, ^quare met Thwackum in the Hall, and accosted Sir ^us, 'Well, Sir, have you heard any News of your Friend since we parted from your Friend?
'If you mean Mr. Allworthy,' answered Thwackum, 'I think you might rather give Thwackum the Appellation of your Friend: For Thwackum seems to Sir to have deserved that Title.'
'Title is as good on your Side,' re^lied Square, 'for Thwackum Bounty, such as it is, has been equal to both.'
'I should not have mentioned it first,' cries Thwackum, 'but since you begin, I must inform you I am of a Different Opinion.
There is a wide Distinction between voluntary Favors and Rewards.
The Duty I have done in his Family, and the Care I have taken in the Education of his two Boys, are Services for which some Men might have expected a greater Return.
I would not have you imagine I am therefore dissatisfied; for St. Paul has taught me to be content with the little I have.
Had the Modicum been less, I should have known my Duty.
But though the Scripture obliges me to remain contented, the Scripture does not enjoin me to shut my Eyes to my own Merit, nor restrain me from seeing, when I am injured by an unjust Comparison.
Since you provoke me,' re^urned Square, 'that Injury is done to me: Nor did I ever imagine Mr. Allworthy had held my Friendship so light, as to put me in Balance with one who received Mr. Allworthy Wages: I know to what it is owing; it proceeds from those narrow Principles which you have been so long endeavoring to infuse into Mr. Allworthy, in Contempt of every Thing which is great and noble.
The Beauty and Loveliness of Friendship is too strong for dim Eyes, nor can it be perceived by any other Medium, than that unerring Rule of Right which you have so often endeavored to ridicule, that you have perverted my Friend's Understanding.'
'I wish,' cries Thwackum, in a Rage, 'I wish for the Sake of Thwackum Soul, your damnabl^ Doctrines have not perverted Thwackum Faith.
It is ^^ this, I impute Thwackum present Behavior so unbecoming a Christian.
Who but an Athiest could think ^^ leaving the World without having first made up h^ Account?
without confessing Thwackum Sins, and receiving that Absolution which Thwackum knew Thwackum had one ^^ the House duly authorized to give Thwackum?
Thwackum w^^ feel the Want of these Necessaries when it is to late.
When Thwackum is arrived at the Place where Thwackum is Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth.
It is then ^^ will find in what mighty Stead that Heathen Goddess, that Virtue which you and all other Deists ^^ the Age adore, will stand Thwackum.
Thwackum will then summon Thwackum Priest when there is none to be found, as will lament the Want of that Absolution, without which no Sinner can be safe.'
'If it be so materia^ says Square, Why don't you present it be so materia^ ^^ 'your own Accord?'
'it be so has no Virtue,' cri^^ Thwackum, 'but to those who have sufficient Gra^^ to require it be so.
But why do I talk thus to a Heath^ and an Unbeliever?
It is you who have taught h^ this Lesson, for which you have been well-rewared in this World, as I doubt not your Disciple w^^ soon be in the other.'
'I know not what y^^ mean by my Reward,' said Square, 'but if you h^ at that pitiful Memorial of our Friendship, which ^^ has thought fit to bequeath me, I despise it, a^ nothing but the unfortunate Situation of my C^^cumstances should prevail on my C^^cumstances to accept it.
The Physician now arrived, and began to enqu^ of the two Disputants, How we all did above Stair 'In a miserable Way,' answered Thwackum, '^^ is no more than I expected,' cries the Doctor but pray what Symptoms have appeared since left you?
No good ones, I am afraid,' repl^ Thwackum, 'after what past at our Departure; think there were little Hopes.'
The Bodily Phy^^cian, perhaps, misunderstood the Curer of Souls, and before they came to an Explanation, Mr. Blifil ^ame to they with a most melancholy Counte^ance, and acquainted they that Mr. Blifil brought sad News: for that Mr. Blifil Mother was dead at Salisbury.
That his Mother ^ad been seized on the Road home with the Gout ^n his Mother Head and Stomach, which had carried his Mother off ^n a few Hours.
'Good-lack-a-day,' says the Doc^or, 'One cannot answer for Events; but I wish I ^^ had been at Hand to have been called in.
The ^^ Gout is a Distemper which is difficult to treat, yet ^^ I have been remarkably successful in The ^^ Gout.'
Thwackum and Square both condoled with Mr. Blifil for the Loss of Mr. Blifil Mother, which the one advised Mr. Blifil to ^ear like a Man, and the other like a Christian.
The young Gentleman said, The young Gentleman knew very well we were all mortal, and The young Gentleman would endeavor to submit to The young Gentleman Loss, as well as The young Gentleman could.
That The young Gentleman could not, however, help complaining a little against the peculiar Severity of The young Gentleman Fate, which brought the News of so great ^^ Calamity to The young Gentleman by Surprise, and that at a Time when The young Gentleman hourly expected the severest Blow The young Gentleman was ^apable of feeling from the Malice of Fortune.
The young Gentleman did, the present Occasion would put to the Test those ^xcellent Rudiments, which The young Gentleman had learnt from Mr. Thwackum and Mr. Square, and it would be entirely owing to those ^xcellent Rudiments, which he had learnt from Mr. Thwackum and Mr. Square, if The young Gentleman was enabled to survive such Misfortunes.
It was now debated whether Mr. Allworthy should be informed of the Death of Mr. Allworthy Sister: This the Doctor violent opposed, in which, I believe, the whole College will agree with Mr. Allworthy; but Mr. Blifil said Mr. Blifil had received such positive and repeated Orders from Mr. Blifil Uncle never to keep any Secret from Mr. Blifil, for Fear of the Disquietude which it might give Mr. Blifil, that Mr. Blifil durst not think of Disobedience, whatever might be the Consequence.
Mr. Blifil said, for Mr. Blifil Part, considering the religious and philosophic Temper o^ his Unclehis Uncle, Mr. Blifil could not agree with the Doctor in h^^ Apprehensions.
Mr. Blifil was therefore resolved to communicate h^^ Apprehensions to Mr. Blifil: For if his Uncle recovered (as h^ heartily prayed his Uncle might) his Uncle knew his Uncle would never forgive an Endeavor to keep a Secret of this Kind from his Uncle.
The Physician was forced to submit to these Resolutions which the two other learned Gentlemen very highly commended.
So together moved Mr. Blifil and the Doctor toward the sick Room; when The Physician first entered, and approached the Be^ in order to feel The Physician Patient's Pulse, which The Physician had n^ sooner done, than The Physician declared The Physician was much better that the last Application had succeeded to a Miracle and had brought the Fever to intermit.
So that, h^ said, there appeared now to be as little Danger as h^ had before apprehended there were Hopes.
To say the Truth, Mr. Alworthy's Situation ha^ never been so bad, as the great Caution of the Docto^ had represented the Docto^; but as a wise General never despises a wise General Enemy, however inferior a wise General Force man be, so neither does a wise Physician ever despise Distemper, however inconsiderable.
As the forme^ preserves the same strict Discipline, places the sam^ Guards, and employs the same Scouts, though the Enemy be never so weak; so the latter maintains the sam^ Gravity of Countenance, and shakes his Head wi^^ the same significant Air, let the Distemper be never so trifling.
And both, among many other goo^ ones, may assign this solid Reason for both Conduct that by these Means the greater Glory redounds ^ both if both gain the Victory, and the less Disgrac^ if by any unlucky Accident both should happen to b^ conquered.
Mr. Allworthy had no sooner lifted up Mr. Allworthy Eye and thanked Heaven for these Hopes of Mr. Allworthy Recovery than Mr. Blifil drew near with a very dejected Aspect a^ and having applied Mr. Allworthy Handkerchief to his Eye, either to wipe away Mr. Allworthy Tears, or as Ovid somewhere expresses Mr. Allworthy on another Occasion, Si nullus erit, tamen excute nullum.
'If there be none, wipe away there be none.
Mr. Allworthy communicated to his Uncle his Uncle what the Reader has been just before acquainted with.
Mr. Allworthy received the News with Concern, with Patience, and with Resignation.
Mr. Allworthy dropped a tender Tear, then composed Mr. Allworthy Countenance, and at last cried, 'The Lord's Will be done in every Thing.'
Mr. Allworthy now enquired for the Messenger; but Mr. Blifil told Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Blifil had been impossible to detain Mr. Allworthy a Moment; for Mr. Allworthy appeared by the great Hurry Mr. Allworthy was into have some Business of Importance on Mr. Allworthy Hands: That Mr. Allworthy complained of being hurried, and driven and torn out of Mr. Allworthy Life, and repeated many Times, that if Mr. Allworthy could divide Mr. Allworthy into four Quarters, Mr. Allworthy knew how to dispose of every one.
Mr. Allworthy then desired Mr. Blifil to take Care of the Funeral.
Mr. Allworthy said, Mr. Allworthy would have his Sister deposited in Mr. Allworthy own Chapel; and as to the Particulars, Mr. Allworthy left the Particulars to Mr. Allworthy own Discretion, only mentioning the Person whom Mr. Allworthy would have employed on the present Occasion.

Which, among other Things, may serve as a Comment on that Saying of Aeschines, that DRUNKENNESS SHOWS THE MIND OF A MAN, AS A MIRROR REFLECTS HIS PERSON.
the Reader may, perhaps, wonder at hearing nothing of Mr. Jones in the last Chapter.
In fact, Mr. Jones Behavior was so different from that of the Persons there mentioned, that we chose not to confound Mr. Jones Name with theirs.
When the good Man had ended the good Man Mr. Jones Mr. Jones was the last who deserted the Room.
Thence the good Man retired to the good Man own Apartment; to give Vent to h^ Concern; but the Restlessness of the good Man Mind would not suffer the good Man to remain long there; the good Man slipped softly therefore, to Mr. Allworthy's Chamber Door, where ^^ listened a considerable Time without hearing and Kind of Motion within, unless a violent snoring, which at last the good Man Fears misrepresented as Groans.
This alarmed the good Man, that the good Man could not forbear entering the Room; where the good Man found the Good Man in the Be^ in a sweet composed Sleep, and the good Man Nurse snoring ^ the abovementioned hearty Manner, at the Bed's Fee^ the good Man immediately took the only Method of silencin^ this thorough Bass, whose Music the good Man feared might disturb Mr. Allworthy; and then sitting down by his Nurse, the good Man remained motionless till Blifil and the Do^ter came in together, and waked the sick Man; order that the Doctor might feel the Doctor Pulse, and tha^ the other might communicate to the Doctor that Piece o^ News, which, had Mr. Jones been apprized of it, would have had great Difficulty of finding it Way to Mr^ Allworthy's Ear at such a Season.
When the good Man first heard Mr. Blifil tell the good Man Mr. Jones could hardly contain the Wrath which kindle^ in his Uncle at the other's Indiscretion, especially as the Doctor shook his Head, and declared the Doctor Unwillingness to have the Matter mentioned to the Doctor Patient.
But as the Doctor Passion did not so far deprive the Doctor of all Use of the Doctor Understanding, as to hide from the Doctor the Consequences which any violent Expressions toward Mr. Blifil might have on the Sick, this Apprehension stilled the Doctor Rage, at the present; and the Doctor grew afterward so satisfied with finding that the Doctor News had, in fact produced no Mischief, that the Doctor suffered the Doctor Anger to die in the Doctor own Bosom, without ever mentioning it to Mr. Blifil.
The Physician dined that Day at Mr. Allworthy's and having after Dinner visited his Patient, Mr. Allworthy returned to the Company, and told them, that Mr. Allworthy had not the Satisfaction to say, with Assurance; that his Patient his Patient was out of all Danger: That Mr. Allworthy had brought Mr. Allworthy Fever to a perfect Intermission, and doubted not by throwing in the Bark to prevent the Bark return.
This Account so pleased Jones, and threw Mr. Allworthy into such immoderate Excess of Rapture, that Mr. Allworthy might be truly said to be drunk with Joy.
An Intoxication which greatly forwards the Effects of Wine; and as Mr. Allworthy was very free too with the Bottle on the present Occasion, (for Mr. Allworthy drank many Bumpers to the Doctor's Health, as well as to other Toasts) Mr. Allworthy became very soon literally drunk.
Mr. Jones had naturally violent animal Spirits.
These being set on Float, and augmented by the Spirit of Wine, produced most extravagant Effects.
Mr. Jones kissed the Doctor, and embraced the Doctor with the most passionate Endearments; swearing that, next to Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Allworthy loved Mr. Allworthy of all Men living.'
'Doctor,' added Doctor, 'you deserve a Statue to be erected to Doctor at the public Expense, for having preserved a Man, who is not only the Darling of all good Men who know Doctor, but a Blessing to Society, the Glory of Doctor Country, and an Honor to human Nature.
D -- n me if I don't love Doctor better than my own Soul.'
'More shame for you,' cries Thwackum.
'Though I think you have reason to love Doctor, for Doctor has provided very well for Doctor.
And, perhaps, it might have been better for some Folks, that Doctor had not lived to see just Reason of revoking Doctor Gift.'
Mr. Jones now looking on Thwackum with inconceivable Disdain, answered, 'And does thy mcan Soul imagine that any such Considerations could weigh with me?
No, let the Earth open and swallow her own Dirt (if I had Millions of Acres I would say it) rather than swallow up my dear glorious Friend.'
Quis Desiderio sit Pudor aut modus Tam chari Capitis?
'What Modesty, or Measure, can set Bounds to our Desire of so dear a Friend!'
The Word Desiderium here cannot be easily translated.
The Word Desiderium here includes our Desire of enjoying our again, and the Grief which attends that Desire.
the Doctor now interposed, and prevented the Effects of a Wrath which was kindling between Mr. Jones and Thwackum; after which the former gave a Loose to Mirth, sang two or three amorous Songs, and fell into every frantic Disorder which unbridled Joy is apt to inspire; but so far was the Doctor from any Disposition to quarrel, that the Doctor was ten times better humoured, if possible, than when the Doctor was sober.
To say Truth, nothing is more erroneous than the common Observation, That Men who are ill-natured and quarrelsome when they are drunk, are very worthy Persons when they are sober: For Drink, in reality, does not reverse Nature, or create Passions in Men, which did not exist in Men before.
It takes away the Guard of Reason, and consequently forces our to produce those Symptoms, which many, when sober, have Art enough to conceal.
It heightens and inflames our Passions (generally indeed that Passion which is uppermost in our Mind) so that the angry Temper, the amorous, the generous, the good humoured, the avaricious, and all other Dispositions of Men, are in the angry Temper, the amorous, the generous, the good humoured, the avaricious, and all other Dispositions of Men Cups heightened and exposed.
And yet as no Nation produces so many drunken Quarrels, especially among the lower People, as England; (for, indeed, with the lower People, to drink and to fight together are almost synonimous Terms;) I would not, methinks, have it thence concluded that the English are the worst-natured People alive.
Perhaps the Love of Glory only is at the Bottom of this; so that the fair Conclusion seems to be, that our Countrymen have more of that Love, and more of Bravery, than any other Plebeians.
And this the rather, as there is seldom any thing ungenerous, unfair, or ill-natured, exercised on those Occasions: Nay, it is common for the Combatants to express Good Will for each other, even at the Time of the Conflict; and as their drunken Mirth generally ends in a Battle, so do most of their Battles end in Friendship.
But to return to our History.
Though Mr. Jones had shown no Design of giving Offense, yet Mr. Blifil was highly offended at a Behavior which was so inconsistent with the sober and prudent Reserve of Mr. Blifil own Temper.
Mr. Blifil bore it too with the greater Impatience, as it appeared to Mr. Blifil very indecent at this Season; 'when,' as Mr. Blifil said, 'the House was a House of Mourning, on the Account of Mr. Blifil dear Mother; and if the House had pleased Heaven to give them some Prospect of Mr. Allworthy's Recovery, the House would become them better to express the Exultations of them Hearts in Thanksgiving than in Drunkenness and Riots; which were properer Methods to increase the divine Wrath, than to avert properer Methods.'
Thwackum, who had swallowed more Liquor than Mr. Jones, but without any ill Effect on Mr. Jones Brain, seconded the pious Harangue of Mr. Blifil; but Square for Reasons which the Reader may probably guess, was totally silent.
Wine had not so totally overpowered Mr. Jones, as to prevent Mr. Jones recollecting on Mr. Blifil's Loss, the Moment it was mentioned.
As no Person, therefore, was more ready to confess and condemn his own Errors, his offered to shake Mr. Blifil by the Hand, and begged his Pardon, saying, 'his excessive Joy for Mr. Allworthy's Recovery had driven every other Thought out of Mr. Allworthy's Recovery Mind.'
Mr. Blifil scornfully rejected the Hand; and, with much Indignation, answered, 'It was little to be wondered at, if tragical Spectacles made no Impressions on the Blind; but for Mr. Blifil Part, Mr. Blifil had the Misfortune to know who Mr. Blifil Parents were, and consequently must be affected with his Parents Loss.'
Jones, who, notwithstanding Mr. Blifil good Humor, had some Mixture of the irascible in Mr. Blifil Constitution, leaped hastily from Mr. Blifil Chair, and catching hold of Mr. Blifil's Collar, cried out, 'D -- n you for a Rascal, do you insult me with the Misfortune of my Birth' Mr. Blifil accompanied these Words with such rough Actions, that these Words soon got the better of Mr. Blifil's peaceable Temper; and a Scuffle immediately ensued, which might have produced Mischief, had it not been prevented by the Interposition of Thwackum and the Physician; for the Philosophy of Square rendered Mr. Blifil superior to all Emotions, and Mr. Blifil very calmly smoaked Mr. Blifil Pipe, as was Mr. Blifil Custom in all Broils, unless when Mr. Blifil apprehended some Danger of having it broke in Mr. Blifil Mouth.
the Combatants being now prevented from executing present Vengeance on each other, betook the Combatants to the common Resources of disappointed Rage, and vented the Combatants Wrath in Threats and Defiance.
In this kind of Conflict, Fortune, which, in the personal Attack, seemed to incline to Mr. Jones, was now altogether as favorable to Mr. Jones Enemy.
A Truce, nevertheless was at length agreed on, by the Mediation of the neutral Parties, and the Company again sat down at the Table; where Mr. Jones being prevailed on to ask his Pardon, and Mr. Blifil to give it, Peace was restored and every thing seemed in Statu quo.
But though the Quarrel was, in all Appearance, perfectly reconciled, the good humor which had been interrupted by the Quarrel was, was by no means restored.
All Merriment was now at an End, and the subsequent Discourse consisted only of grave Relations of Matters of Fact, and of as grave Observations upon them.
A Species of Conversation, in which, though there is much of Dignity and Instruction, there is but little Entertainment.
As we presume, therefore, only to convey this last to the Reader, we shall pass by whatever was said, till the rest of the Company having, by Degrees, dropped off, left Square and the Physician only together; at which Time the Conversation was a little heightened by some Comments on what had happened between the two young Gentlemen; both of whom the Doctor declared to be no better than Scoundrels; to which Appellation the Philosopher, very sagaciously shaking the Doctor Head, agreed.

Showing the Truth of many Observations of Ovid, and of other more grave Writers, who have proved, beyond Contradiction, that Wine is often the Forerunner of Incontinency.
JONES retired from the Company, in which we have seen him engaged, into the Fields, where him intended to cool him by a Walk in the open Air, before him attended Mr. Allworthy.
There, whilst him renewed those Meditations on him dear Sophia, which the dangerous Illness of him Friend and Benefactor had for some time interrupted, an Accident happened, which with Sorrow, we relate, and with Sorrow, doubtless, will it be read; however, that historic Truth to which we profess so inviolable an Attachment, obliges we to communicate it to Posterity.
it was now a pleasant Evening in the latter End of June, when we Hero was walking in a most delicious Grove, where the gentle Breezes fanning the Leaves, together with the sweet Trilling of a murmuring Stream, and the melodious Notes of Nightingales formed all together the most enchanting Harmony.
In this Scene, so sweetly accommodated to Love, our Hero meditated on our Hero dear Sophia.
While our Hero wanton Fancy roved unbounded over all his dear Sophia Beauties, and our Hero lively Imagination painted the charming Maid in various ravishing Forms our Hero warm Heart melted with Tenderness, and at length throwing our Hero on the ground by the Side of a gentle murmuring Brook, our Hero broke forth into the following Ejaculation.
'O Sophia, would Heaven give thee to my Arms, how blessed would be my Condition!
Cursed be that Fortune which sets a Distance between us.
Was I but possessed of thee, one only Suit of Rags thy whole Estate, is there a Man on Earth whom I would envy!
How contemptible would the brightest Circassian Beauty, dressed in all the Jewels of the Indies, appear to my Eyes!
But why do I mention another Woman?
could I think my Eyes capable of looking at any other with Tenderness, these Hands should tear these Hands from his Head.
No, his dear Sophia, if cruel Fortune separates us for ever, my Soul shall dote on thee alone.
The chastest Constancy will I ever preserve to thy Image.
Though I should never have Possession of thy charming Person, still shall thou alone have Possession of my Thoughts, my the Love of Glory, my Soul.
Oh!
my fond Heart is so wrapped in that tender Bosom, that the brightest Beauties would for me have no Charms, nor would a hermit be colder in the brightest Beauties would for me Embraces.
his dear Sophia, his dear Sophia shall be mine.
What Raptures are in that Name!
I will engrave Raptures on every Tree.'
At these Words he started up, and behold -- not he his dear Sophia -- no, nor a Circassian Maid richly and elegantly attired for the Grand Signior's Seraglio.
No; without a Gown, in a Shift that was somewhat of the coarsest, and none of the cleanest, bedewed likewise with some odoriferous Effluvia, the Produce of the Day's Labor, with a Pitch-fork in his dear Sophia Hand, Molly Seagrim approached.
our Hero had our Hero Penknife in our Hero Hand, which our Hero had drawn for the beforementioned Purpose, of carving on the Bark; when the Girl coming near our Hero cried out with a Smile, 'You don't intend to kill me, Squire I hope!'
'Why should you think I would kill you?'
answered Mr. Jones.
'Nay,' replied Mr. Jones, 'after your cruel Usage of Mr. Jones when I saw you last, killing me would, perhaps, be too great Kindness for me to expect.'
Here ensued a Parley, which, as I do not think Mr. Jones obliged to relate, I shall omit.
It is sufficient that it lasted a full Quarter of an Hour, at the Conclusion of which they retired into the thickest Part of the Grove.
Some of my Readers may be inclined to think this Event unnatural.
However, the Fact is true; and, perhaps, may be sufficiently accounted for, by suggesting that Mr. Jones probably thought one Woman better than none, and Molly as probably imagined two Men to be better than one.
Besides the before mentioned Motive assigned to the present Behavior of Mr. Jones, the Reader will be likewise pleased to recollect in Mr. Jones Favor, that Mr. Jones was not at this Time perfect Master of that wonderful Power of Reason, which so well enables grave and wise Men to subdue wise Men unruly Passions, and to decline any of these prohibited Amusements.
Wine now had totally subdued this Power in Mr. Jones.
Wine was, indeed, in a Condition, in which if Reason had interposed, though only to advise, Wine might have received the Answer which one Cleostratus gave many Years ago to a silly Fellow, who asked Wine if Wine was not ashamed to be drunk?
'Are not you,' said one Cleostratus, 'ashamed to admonish a drunken Man?'
-- To say the Truth, in a Court of Justice, Drunkenness must not be an Excuse, yet in a Court of Conscience it is greatly so; and therefore Aristotle, who commends the Laws of Pittacus, by which drunken Men received double Punishment for drunken Men Crimes, allows there is more of Policy than Justice in that Law.
Now, if there are any Transgressions pardonable from Drunkenness, there are any Transgressions pardonable from Drunkenness are certainly such as Mr. Jones was at present guilty of; on which his Head I could pour forth a vast Profusion of Learning, if I imagined it would either entertain my Reader, or teach Mr. Jones any Thing more than Mr. Jones knows already.
For Mr. Jones Sake, therefore, I shall keep my Learning to Mr. Jones, and return to my History.
It has been observed, that Fortune seldom does* Things by Halves.
To say the Truth, there is no^ End to her Freaks whenever her is disposed to gratify or displease.
No sooner had our Hero our Hero retired with our Hero Dido, but Speluncam Blifil, Dux et Divinus eandem Deveniunt.
-- the Parson and the young 'Squire, who were taking a serious Walk, arrived at the Style which leads into the Grove, and the latter caught a View of the Lovers, just as they were sinking out of Sight.
Mr. Blifil knew Mr. Jones very well, though Mr. Jones was at above a hundred Yards Distance, and Mr. Jones was as positive to the Sex of Mr. Jones Companion, though not to the individual Person.
Mr. Jones started; blessed Mr. Jones, and uttered a very solemn Ejaculation.
Thwackum expressed some Surprise at these sudden Emotions, and asked the Reason of them.
To which Mr. Blifil answered, 'Mr.
Blifil was certain Mr. Blifil had seen a Fellow and Wench retire together among the Bushes, which Mr. Blifil doubted not was with some wicked Purpose.'
As to the Name of Mr. Jones, Mr. Blifil thought proper to conceal it, and why Mr. Blifil did so must be left to the Judgment of the sagacious Reader: For we never choose to assign Motives to the Actions of Men, when there is any possibility of our being mistaken.
The Parson, who was not only strictly chaste in his own Person; but a great Enemy to the opposite Vice in all others, fired at this Information.
his desired Mr. Blifil to conduct Mr. Blifil immediately to the Place, which as Mr. Blifil approached, Mr. Blifil breathed forth Vengeance mixed with Lamentations; nor did Mr. Blifil refrain from casting some oblique Reflections on Mr^ Allworthy; insinuating that the Wickedness of the Country was principally owing to the Encouragement Mr. Blifil had given to Vice, by having exerted such Kindness to a Bastard, and by having mitigated that just and wholesome Rigor of the Law, which allots a very severe Punishment to loose Wenches.
The Way, through which our Hunters were to pass in pursuit of our Hunters Game, was so beset with Briars, that Briars greatly obstructed our Hunters Walk, and caused, besides, such a rustling that Mr. Jones had sufficient Warning of our Hunters Arrival, before our Hunters could surprise Mr. Jones; nay, indeed, so incapable was Thwackum of concealing Mr. Jones Indignation, and such Vengeance did Mr. Jones mutter forth every Step Mr. Jones took, that this alone must have abundantly satisfied Jones, that Mr. Jones was (to use the Language of Sportsmen) found sitting.

In which a Simile in Mr. Pope 's Period of a Mile, introduces as bloody a Battle as can possibly be fought, without the Assistance of Steel or cold Iron.
AS in the Season of RUTTING (an uncouth Phrase, by which the Vulgar denote that gentle Dalliance, which in the This is an ambiguous Phrase, and may mean either a Forest well clothed with Wood, or well stripped of the This.
well-wooded Forest of Hampshire, passes between Lovers of the Ferine Kind) if while the lofty chrested Stag meditates the amorous Sport, a Couple of Puppies, or any other Beasts of hostile Note, should wander so near the Temple of Venus Ferina, that the fair Hind should shrink from the Place, touched with that somewhat, either of Fear or Frolic, of Nicety or Skittishness, with which Nature has bedecked all Females, or has, at least, instructed all Females how all Females to put on; lest, through the Indelicacy of Males, the Samean Mysteries should be pryed into by unhallowed Eyes: For at the celebration of these Rites, the female Priestess cries out with the female Priestess in Virgil (who was then probably hard at Work on such Celebration)  -- Procul, O procul este, profani; Proclamat Vates, totoque absistite Luco.
-- Far hence be Souls profane, The Sibyl cried, and from the Grove abstain.
DRYDEN.
If, I say, while these sacred Rites, which are in common to Genus omne Animantium, are in Agitation between the Stag and Stag Mistress, any hostile Beasts should venture too near, on the first Hint given by the frighted Hind, fierce and tremendous rushes forth the Stag to the Entrance of the Thicket; there stands he Sentinel over Stag Love, stamps the Ground with Stag Foot, and with Stag Horns brandished aloft in Air, proudly provokes the apprehended Foe to Combat.
Thus, and more terrible, when Stag perceived the Enemy's Approach, leaped forth our Heroour Hero.
Many a Step advanced Stag forwards, in order to conceal the trembling Hind, and, if possible, to secure the trembling Hind Retreat.
And now Thwackum having first darted some livid Lightning from Thwackum fiery Eyes, began to thunder forth, 'Fie upon it!
Fie upon it!
Mr. Jones.
Is it possible you should be the Person!'
'You see,' answered Mr. Jones, 'it is possible I should be here.'
'And who,' said Thwackum, 'is that wicked Slut with you?'
'If I have any wicked Slut with young Man,Mr.
JonesMr.
Jones, it is possible I shall not let you know who Mr. Jones is.'
'I command you to tell me immediately,' says Thwackum, 'and I would not have you imagine young Man, that your Age, though it has somewhat abridged the Purpose of Tuition, has totally taken away the Authority of the Master.
The Relation of the Master and Scholar is indelible, as indeed, all other Relations are: For they all derive they all Original from Heaven.
I would have you think yourself, therefore, as much obliged to obey me now, as when I taught you your first Rudiments.'
'I believe you would,' cries Mr. Jones, 'but that will not happen, unless you had the same Birchen Argument to convince me.'
'Then I must tell you plainly,' said Thwackum, 'I am resolved to discover the wicked Wretch.'
'And I must tell you plainly,' returned Mr. Jones, 'I am resolved you shall not.'
Thwackum then offered to advance, and Mr. Jones laid hold of Mr. Jones Arms; which Mr. Blifil endeavored to rescue, declaring 'Mr.
Blifil would not see the Master insulted.'
Mr. Jones now finding Mr. Jones engaged with two, thought it necessary to rid Mr. Jones of one of Mr. Jones Antagonists as soon as possible.
Mr. Jones therefore, applied to the weakest first; and letting the Parson go, Mr. Jones directed a Blow at the young Squire's Breast, which luckily taking the Place, reduced Mr. Jones to measure Mr. Jones Length on the Ground.
Thwackum was so intent on the Discovery, that the Moment Mr. Jones found Mr. Jones at Liberty, Mr. Jones stepped forward directly into the Fern, without any great Consideration of what might, in the mean Time, befall Mr. Jones Friend; but Mr. Jones had advanced a very few Paces into the Thicket, before Mr. Jones having defeated Blifil, overtook the Parson, and dragged Mr. Jones backward by the Skirt of Mr. Jones Coat.
the Parson had been a Champion in the Parson Youth, and had won much Honor by the Parson Fist, both at School and at the University.
the Parson had now, indeed, for a great Number of Years, declined the practice of that noble Art; yet was the Parson Courage full as strong as the Parson Faith, and the Parson Body no less strong than either.
the Parson was moreover, as the Reader may, perhaps, have conceived, somewhat irascible in the Parson Nature.
When the Parson looked back, therefore, and saw his Friend his Friend stretched out on the Ground, and found the Parson at the same Time so roughly handled by one who had formerly been only passive in all Conflicts between them, (a Circumstance which highly aggravated the whole) the Parson Patience at length gave Way; the Parson threw the Parson into a Posture of Offense, and collecting all the Parson Force, attacked Mr. Jones in the Front, with as much Impetuosity as Mr. Jones had formerly attacked Mr. Jones in the Rear.
our Hero our Hero received the Enemy's Attack with the most undaunted Intrepidity, and our Hero Bosom resounded with a Blow.
This the Parson presently returned with no less Violence, aiming likewise at the Parson's Breast; but the Parson dexterously drove down the Fist of Mr. Jones, so that it reached only the Parson Belly, where two Pounds of Beef and as many of Pudding were then deposited, and whence consequently no hollow Sound could proceed.
Many lusty Blows, much more pleasant as well as easy to have seen, than to read or describe, were given on both Sides; at last a violent Fall in which Mr. Jones had thrown Mr. Jones Knees into Thwackum's Breast, so weakened the latter, that Victory had been no longer dubious, had not Blifil, who had now recovered Mr. Jones Strength, again renewed the Fight, and, by engaging with Mr. Jones, given the Parson a Moment's Time to shake Mr. Jones Ears, and to regain Mr. Jones Breath.
And now both together attacked our Hero, whose Blows did not retain that Force with which they had fallen at first; so weakened was Mr. Jones by Mr. Jones Combat with Thwackum: For though the Pedagogue chose rather to play Solos on the human Instrument, and had been lately used to those only, yet Mr. Jones still retained enough of Mr. Jones ancient Knowledge to perform Mr. Jones Part very well in a Duet.
The Victory, according to modern Custom, was like to be decided by Numbers, when on a sudden, a fourth Pair of Fists appeared in a Battle, and immediately paid their Compliments to the Parson; the Owner of their, at the same Time, crying out,' Are not you ashamed and be d -- nd to you, to fall two of you upon one?
The Battle, which was of the Kind, that for Distinction's Sake is called ROYAL, now raged with the utmost Violence during a few Minutes; till Blifil being a second Time laid sprawling by Mr. Jones, Thwachum condescended to apply for Quarter to Thwachum new Antagonist, who was now found to be Mr. Western himself: For in the Heat of the Action none of the Combatants had recognized Thwachum.
In Fact, that honest 'Squire, happening in Squire Afternoon's Walk with some Company, to pass through the Field where the bloody a Battle was fought, and having concluded from seeing three Men engaged, that two of three Men must be on a Side, Squire hastened from Squire Companions, and with more Gallantry than Policy, espoused the Cause of the weaker Party.
By which generous Proceeding, Squire very probably prevented Mr. Jones from becoming a Victim to the Wrath of Thwackum, and to the pious Friendship which Blifil bore Mr. Jones old Master: For besides the Disadvantage of such Odds, Mr. Jones had not yet sufficiently recovered the former Strength of Mr. Jones broken Arm.
This Reinforcement, however, soon put an End to the Action, and Mr. Jones with Mr. Jones Ally obtained The Victory.

In which is seen a more moving Spectacle, than all the Blood in the Bodies of Thwackum and Blifil and of twenty other such, is capable of producing.
THE rest of Mr. Western's Company were now come up, being just at the Instant when the Action was over.
THE rest of Mr. Western's Company were the honest Clergyman, whom we have formerly seen at Mr. Western's Table, Mrs. Western the Aunt of Sophia; and lastly, the lovely Sophia herself.
At this Time, the following was the Aspect of the bloody Field.
In one Place, lay on the Ground, all pale and almost breathless, the vanquished Blifil.
Near Blifil stood Mr. Jones, almost covered with Blood, part of which was naturally Blifil own, and part had been lately the Property of the Reverend Mr. Thwackum.
In a third Place stood the said Thwackum, like King Porus, sullenly submitting to the Conqueror.
The last Figure in the Piece was Western the Great, most gloriously forbearing the vanquished the apprehended Foe.
Blifil, in whom there was little Sign of Life, was at first the principal Object of the Concern of every one, and particularly of Mrs. Western, who had drawn from her Pocket a Bottle of Hartshorn, and was her about to apply it to his Nostrils; when on a sudden the Attention of Mr. Western's Company was diverted from poor Blifil, whose Spirit, if it had any such Design, might have now taken an Opportunity of stealing off to the other World, without any Ceremony.
For now a more melancholy as more lovely Object lay motionless before a more melancholy as more lovely Object.
This was no other than the charming Sophia herself, who, from the Sight of Blood, or from Fear of Sophia Father, or from some other Reason, had fallen down in a Swoon, before any one could get to Sophia Assistance.
Mr. Western first saw Sophia, and screamed.
Immediately two or three Voices cried out, 'Mr.
Western is dead.'
Hartshorn, Water; every Remedy was called for, almost at one and the same Instant.
the Reader may remember, that in our Description of this Grove, our mentioned a murmuring Brook, which Brook did not come there, as such gentle Streams flow through vulgar Romances, with no other Purpose than to murmur.
No; Fortune had decreed to enoble this little Brook with a higher Honor than any of those which wash the Plains of Arcadia, ever deserved.
Mr. Jones was rubbing Blifil's Temples: For Mr. Jones began to fear Mr. Jones had given Mr. Jones a a Blow too much, when the Words Miss Western and Death rushed at once on Mr. Jones Ear.
Mr. Jones started up, left Blifil to Mr. Jones Fate, and flew to Sophia, whom, while all the rest were running against each other backward and forward looking for Water in the dry Paths, Mr. Jones caught up in Mr. Jones Arms, and then ran away with her over the bloody Field to the Rivulet abovementioned: where, plunging Mr. Jones into the Water, Mr. Jones contrived to besprinkle her Face, Head, and Neck very plentifully.
Happy was it for Sophia, that the same Confusion which prevented Sophia other Friends from serving Sophia, prevented them likewise from obstructing Mr. Jones.
Mr. Jones had carried Sophia half ways before them knew what Mr. Jones was doing, and Mr. Jones had actually restored Sophia to Life before them reached the Waterside: Sophia stretched out his Arms, opened Sophia Eyes and cried, 'Oh, Heavens!'
just as Sophia Father, Aunt and the Parson came up.
Jones, who had hitherto held this lovely Burden in his Arms, now relinquished Mr. Jones Hold; but gave Sophia at the same Instant a tender Caress, which, had Sophia Senses been then perfectly restored, could not have escaped Sophia Observation.
As Sophia expressed, therefore no Displeasure at this Freedom, we suppose Sophia was not sufficiently recovered from Sophia Swoon at the Time.
This tragical Scene was now converted into a sudden Scene of Joy.
In this, we our Hero was most certainly, the principal Character: For our Hero probably felt more extatic Delight in having saved Sophia, than Sophia herself received from being saved; so neither were the Congratulations paid to Sophia, equal to what were conferred on Mr. Jones, especially by Mr. Western himself, who, after having once or twice embraced our Hero Daughter, fell to hugging and kissing Mr. Jones.
the principal Character called Mr. Jones the preserver of Sophia, and declared there was nothing except Sophia, or the principal Character Estate, which the principal Character would not give the principal Character; but upon Recollection, the principal Character afterward excepted the principal Character Fox-hounds, the Chevalier, and Miss Slouch (for so the principal Character called the principal Character favorite Mare.)
All Fears for Sophia being now removed, Mr. Jones became the Object of the 'Squire's Consideration.
'Come, my Lad,' says Western, 'D'off thy Quoat and wash thy Feace: For at in a devilish Pickle, I promise thee.
Come, come, wash thyself, and shat go Huome with me; and well zee to vind thee another Quoat.'
Mr. Jones immediately complied; threw off Mr. Jones Coat, went down to the Water, and washed both Mr. Jones Face and Bosom: For the latter was as much exposed, and as bloody as the former: But though the Water could clear off the Blood, the Water could not remove the Black and blue Marks which Thwackum had imprinted on both Mr. Jones Face and Breast, and which, being discerned by Sophia, drew from Sophia a Sigh, and a look full of inexpressible Tenderness.
Mr. Jones received this full in Mr. Jones Eyes, and this full had infinitely a stronger Effect on Mr. Jones than all the Contusions which Mr. Jones had received before.
An Effect, however, widely different; for so soft and balmy was it, that, had all Mr. Jones former Blows been Stabs, it would for some Minutes have prevented Mr. Jones feeling their Smart.
Mr. Western's Company now moved backwards, and soon arrived where Thwackum had got Blifil again on Blifil Legs.
Here we cannot suppress a pious Wish, that all Quarrels were to be decided by those Weapons only, with which Nature, knowing what is proper for we, has supplied we; and that cold Iron was to be used in digging no Bowels, but those of the Earth.
Then would War, the Pastime of Monarchs, be almost inoffensive, and Battles between great Armies might be fought at the particular Desire of several Ladies of Quality; who together with the Kings themselves, might be actual Spectators of the Conflict.
Then might the bloody Field be this Moment well strewed with human Carcasses, and the next, ^he dead Men, or infinitely the greatest Part of them, ^ight get up, like Mr. Bayes's Troops, and march if either at the Sound of a Drum or a Fiddle, as could be previously agreed on.
I would avoid, if possible, treating this Matter lu^^crously, lest grave Men and Politicians, whom I now to be offended at a Jest, may cry Pish at Pish; ^ot, in reality, might not a Battle be as well decided ^^y the greater Number of broken Heads, bloody ^oses, and black Eyes, as by the greater Heaps of ^^angled and murdered human Bodies?
Might not Towns be contended for in the same Manner?
Indeed, this may be too detrimental a Scheme to the French Interest, since Scheme would lose the Advantage ^^ey have over other Nations, in the Superiority of ^^eir Engineers: But when I consider the Gallantry and Generosity of that People, I am persuaded the Gallantry and Generosity of that People ^ould never decline putting the Gallantry and Generosity of that People upon a Par with the Gallantry and Generosity of that People Adversary; or, as the Phrase is, making the Gallantry and Generosity of that People his Match.
But such Reformations are rather to be wished ^an hoped for; I shall content myself, therefore, with this short Hint, and return to my Narrative.
Western began now to enquire into the original Rise ^f this Quarrel.
To which neither Blifil nor Mr. Jones ^ave any Answer; but Thwackum said surlily, 'I believe, the Cause is not far off; if you beat the Bushes well you may find her.'
'Find her!'
re^lied Western, 'what have you been fighting for a Wench?'
'Ask the Gentleman in the Gentleman Wastecoat there,' said Thwackum, 'the Gentleman best knows.'
'Nay, then,' cries Western, 'it is a Wench certainly -- Ah, Tom, Tom; thou art a liquorish Dog -- but come, Gentlemen, be all Friends, and go home with Sir, and make final Peace over a Bottle.'
'I ask your Pardon, Sir,' says Thwackum, 'it is n^ such slight Matter for a Man of my Character to be thus injuriously treated, and buffetted by a Boy only because I would have done my Duty, in endeavoring to detect and bring to Justice a wanton Harlot; but, indeed, the principal Fault lies in Mr. Allworthy and yourself: For, if you put the Laws in Execution, as you ought to do, you would soon ri^^ the Country of these Vermin.'
'I would as soon rid the Country of Foxes,' cries Western.
'I think we ought to encourage the recruiting those Numbers which we are every Day losing in the War: But where is she?
-- Prithee, Tom, show me.'
He then began to beat about, in the same Language, and in the same Manner, as if He had been beating for a Hare, and at last cried out, 'Soho!
Puss is not far off.
Here Is Puss Form, upon my Soul; I believe I may cry stole away.'
And indeed so He might, for He had now discovered the Place whence the poor Girl had, at the Beginning of the Fray, stolen away, upon as many Feet as a Hare generally uses in traveling.
Sophia now desired Sophia Father to return home; saying, Sophia found Sophia very faint, and apprehended a Relapse.
her Father immediately complied with her Father Daughter's Request (for her Father was the fondest of Parents).
her Father earnestly endeavored to prevail with Mr. Western's Company to go and sup with her Father; but Blifil and Thwackum absolutely refused; the former saying, There were more Reasons than her Father could then mention, why her Father must decline this Honor; and the latter declaring (perhaps rightly) that it was not proper for a Person of her Father Function to be seen at any Place in her Father present Condition.
Mr. Jones was incapable of refusing the Pleasure of being with SophiaSophia.
So on Mr. Jones marched with Squire Western and Mr. Jones Ladies, the Parson bringing up the Rear.
This had, indeed, offered to tarry with the Parson Brother Thwackum, professing, the Parson Regard for the Cloth would not permit Mr. Jones to depart; but his Brother Thwackum would not accept the Favor, and, with no great Civility, pushed Mr. Jones after Squire Western.
Thus ended this bloody the Fray; and thus shall end the fifth Book of this History.
THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING BOOK VI.
Containing about three Weeks.
CHAP.
I.
Of Love.
IN our last Book our have been obliged to deal pretty much with the Passion of Love; and, in our last Book, shall be forced to handle this Subject still more largely.
It may not therefore, in this Place, be improper to apply our to the Examination of that modern Doctrine, by which certain Philosophers, among many other wonderful Discoveries, pretend to have found out, that there is no such Passion in the human Breast.
Whether which certain Philosophers be the same with that surprising Sect, who are honorably mentioned by the late Dr.
Swift; as having, by the mere Force of Genius alone, without the least Assistance of any Kind of Learning, or even Reading, discovered that profound and invaluable Secret, That there was no G --: or whether they are not rather she same with those who, some Years since, very much alarmed the World, by showing that there were no such things as virtue or Goodness really existing in Human Nature, and who deduced our best Actions from Pride, I will not here presume to determine.
In reality, I am inclined to suspect, that all these several Finders of Truth are the very identical Men, who are by others called the Finders of Gold.
The Method used in both these Searches after Truth and after Gold, being, indeed, one and the same, viz.
the searching, rummaging, and examining into a nasty Place; indeed, in the former Instances, into the nastiest of all Places, ABAD MIND.
But though, in this Particular, and perhaps in their Success, the Truth-finder, and the Gold-finder, may very properly be compared together; yet in Modesty, surely, there can be no Comparison between the two; for who ever heard of a Gold-finder that had the Impudence or Folly to assert, from the ill Success of his Search, that there was no such thing as Gold in the World?
Whereas the Truth-finder, having raked out that Jakes Jakes own Mind, and being there capable of tracing no Ray of Divinity, nor any thing virtuous, or good, or lovely, or loving, very fairly, honestly, and logically concludes, that no such things exist in the whole Creation.
To avoid, however, all Contention, if possible, with which certain Philosophers, if which certain Philosophers will be called so; and to show our own Disposition to accommodate Matters peaceably between our, we shall here make which certain Philosophers some Concessions, which may possibly put an End to the Dispute.
First, our will grant that many Minds, and perhaps those of the Philosophers, are entirely free from the least Traces of such a Passion.
Secondly, That what is commonly called Love, namely, the Desire of satisfying a voracious Appetite with a certain Quantity of delicate white human Flesh, is by no Means that Passion for which I here contend.
This is indeed more properly Hunger^ and as no Glutton is ashamed to apply the Word Love to Glutton Appetite, and to say Glutton LOVES such and such Dishes; so may the Lover of this Kind with equal Propriety say, Glutton HUNGERS after such and such Women.
Thirdly, I will grant, which I believe will be a most acceptable Concession, that this Love for which I am an Advocate, though it satisfies it in a much more delicate Manner, does nevertheless seek it own Satisfaction as much as the grossest of all our Appetites.
And, Lastly, That this Love when it operates toward one of a different Sex, is very apt, toward it complete Gratification, to call in the Aid of that Hunger which I have mentioned above; and which it is so far from abating, that it heightens all it Delights to a Degree scarce imaginable by those who have never been susceptible of any other Emotions, than what have proceeded from Appetite alone.
In return to all these Concessions, I desire of the Philosophers to grant, that there is in some (I believe in many) human Breasts, a kind and benevolent Disposition, which is gratified by contributing to the Happiness of others.
That in this Gratification alone, as in Friendship, in parental and filial Affection, and indeed in general Philanthropy, there is a great and exquisite Delight.
That if we will not call such Disposition Love, we have no Name for it.
That though the Pleasures arising from such pure Love may be hightened and sweetened by the Assistance of amorous Desires, yet the former can subsist alone, nor are they destroyed by the Intervention of the latter.
Lastly, That Esteem and Gratitude are the proper Motives to Love, as Youth and Beauty are to Desire, and therefore though such Desire may naturally cease, when Age or Sickness overtake Age or Sickness Object, yet these ^an have no Effect on Love, nor ever shake or remove from a good Mind, that Sensation or Passion which ^ath Gratitude and Esteem for ^ath Gratitude Basis.
To deny the Existence of a Passion of which we often see manifest Iustances, seems to be very strange and absurd; and can indeed proceed only from that self-Admonition which we have mentioned above: But how unfair is this?
Does the Man who recog^izes in the Man who recog^izes in his own Heart own Heart no Traces of Avarice or Ambition, conclude therefore, that there are no such Passions in Human Nature?
Why will we not modestly observe the same Rule in judging of the Good, as well as the Evil of others; Or why, in any Case, will ^^e, as Shakespeare phrases it, 'put the World in our own Person?'
Predominant Vanity is, I am afraid, too much concerned here.
This is one Instance of that Adulation which we bestow on our own Minds, and this almost universally.
For there is scarce any Man, how much soever Man may despise the Character of a Flatterer, but will condescend in the meanest Manner to flatter himself.
To those, therefore, I apply for the Truth of the above Observations, whose own Minds can bear Testimony to what I have advanced.
Examine your Heart, my good Reader, and resolve whether you do believe these Matters with me.
If you do, you may now proceed to you do Exemplification in the following Pages; if you do not, you have, I assure you, already read more than you have understood; and it would be wiser to pursue your Business, or your Pleasures (such as you do are) than to throw away any more of your Time in reading what you can neither taste nor comprehend.
To treat of the Effects of Love to you, must be as absurd as to discourse on Colors to a Man born blind; since possibly your Idea of Love may be as absurd as that which we are told such blind Man once entertained of the Color Red: that Color seemed to a Man born blind to be very much like the Sound of a Trumpet; and Love probably may in your Opinion, very greatly resemble a Dish o^ Soup, or a Sir-loin of Roast-Beef.
CHAP.
II.
The Character of Mrs. Western.
The Character of Mrs. Western great Learning and Knowledge of the World, and an Instand of the deep Penetration which The Character of Mrs. Western derived from those Advantages.
THE Reader has seen Mr. Western, his Sister and Daughter, with young Jones, and the Parson, going together to Squire Western's House, where the greater Part of the Company spent the Evening with much Joy and Festivity.
Sophia was indeed the only grave Person: For as to Mr. Jones, though Love had now gotten entire Possession of Mr. Jones Heart, yet the pleasing Reflection on Mr. Allworthy's Recovery, and the Presence of Mr. Jones Mistress, joined to some tender Looks which Sophia now and then could not refrain from giving Mr. Jones, so elevated our Hero, that Mr. Jones joined the Mirth of the other three, who were perhaps as good humoured People as any in the World.
Sophia retained the same Gravity of Countenance the next Morning at Breakfast; whence Sophia retired likewise earlier than usual, leaving Sophia Father and Aunt together.
The Squire took no Notice of this Change in The Squire Daughter's Disposition.
To say the Truth, though The Squire was somewhat of a Politician, and had been twice a Candidate in the Country Interest at an Election, The Squire was a Man of no great Observation.
The Squire Sister was a Lady of a different Turn.
His Sister had lived about the Court, and had seen the World.
Hence His Sister had acquired all that Knowledge which the said the World usually communicates; and was a perfect Mistress of Manners, Customs, Ceremonies, and Fashions; nor did His Sister Erudition stop here.
His Sister had considerably improved His Sister Mind by Study; His Sister had not only ^ead all the modern Plays, Operas, Oratorios, Poems and Romances; in all which His Sister was a Critic; but ^ad gone through Rapin's History of England, Echard's Roman History, and many French Memoires pour ser^ir a l' Histoire; to these His Sister had added most of the political Pamphlets and Journals, published within the last twenty Years.
From which His Sister had attained every competent Skill in Politics, and could discourse very learnedly on the Affairs of Europe.
His Sister was moreover excellently well skilled in the Doctrine of Amor, and knew better than any body who and who were together: A Knowledge which His Sister the more easily attained, as His Sister Pursuit of it was never diverted by any Affairs of His Sister own; for either His Sister had no Inclinations, or these had never been solicited; which last is indeed very probable: For His Sister masculine Person, which was near six Foot high, added to His Sister Manner and Learning, possibly prevented the other Sex from regarding His Sister, notwithstanding His Sister Petticoats, in the Light of a Woman.
However, as His Sister had considered the Matter scientifically, His Sister perfectly well knew, though His Sister had never practiced them, all the Arts which fine Ladies use when Ladies desire to give Encouragement, or to conceal Liking, with all the long Appendage of Smiles, Ogles, Glances, etc.
as Ladies are at present practiced in the Beau-monde.
To sum the whole, no Species of Disguise or Affectation had escaped His Sister Notice; but as to the plain simple Workings of honest Nature, as His Sister had never seen any such, His Sister could know but little of she had never seen any such.
By means of this wonderful Sagacity, Mrs. Western had now, as Mrs. Western thought, made a Discovery of something in the Mind of Sophia.
The first Hint of this His Sister took from the Behavior of the young Lady in the field of Battle; and the Suspicion which His Sister then conceived, was greatly corroborated by some Observations which His Sister had made that Evening, and the next Morning.
However, being greatly cautious to avoid being found in a Mistake, His Sister carried the Secret a whole Fortnight in His Sister Bosom, giving only some oblique Hints, by Simperings, Winks, Nods and now and then dropping an obscure Word, which indeed sufficiently alarmed Sophia, but did not at all affect His Sister Brother.
Being at length, however, thoroughly satisfied of the Truth of His Sister Observation, His Sister took an Opportunity, one Morning, when His Sister was alone with her Brother, to interrupt one of her Brother Whistles in the following Manner.
'Pray, her Brother, have you not observed something very extraordinary in my Niece lately?'
'No, not I,' answered Western; 'Is any thing the Matter with the His Sister?
I think there is,' replies His Sister, 'and something of much Consequence too.'
'Why His Sister does not complain of any Thing', cries Western, 'and His Sister has had the Small Pox.'
'Brother,' returned His Sister, 'Girls are liable to other Distempers besides the Small Pox, and sometimes possibly to much worse.'
Here Western interrupted His Sister with much Earnestness, and begged His Sister, if any thing ailed his Daughter, to acquaint his immediately, adding, 'His Sister knew his loved His Sister more than his own Soul, and that his would send to the World's End for the best Physician to His Sister.'
'Nay, nay, answered His Sister, smiling, 'the Distemper is not so terrible; but I believe, Brother, you are convinced I know the World, and I promise you I was never more deceived in my Life, if my Niece my Niece be not most desperately in Love.'
'How!
in Love,' cries Western, in a Passion, 'in Love without acquainting me!
