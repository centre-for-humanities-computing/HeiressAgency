Containing as much of the Birth of A FOUNDLING as is necessary or proper to acquaint the Reader with in the Beginning of this History.  CHAP I. The Introduction to the Work, or Bill of Fare to the Feast.  AN Author ought to consider AN Author, not as a Gentleman who gives a private or eleemosynary Treat, but rather as one who keeps a public Ordinary, at which all Persons are welcome for all Persons Money. In the former Case, it is well known, that the Entertainer provides what Fare the Entertainer pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly disagreeable to the Taste of the Entertainer Company, they must not find any Fault; nay, on the contrary, Good-Breeding forces they outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is set before they. Now the contrary of this happens to the Master of an Ordinary. Men who pay for what they eat, will insist on gratifying they Palates, however nice and even whimsical these may prove; and if every Thing is not agreeable to these Taste, will challenge a Right to censure, to abuse, and to d -- m these Dinner without control.  To prevent therefore giving Offense to their Customers by any such Disappointment, it has been usual, with the honest and well-meaning Host, to provide a Bill of Fare, which all Persons may peruse at all Persons first Entrance into the House; and, having thence acquainted all Persons with the Entertainment which all Persons may expect, may either stay and regale with what is provided for all Persons, or may depart to some other Ordinary better accommodated to all Persons Taste.  As we do not disdain to borrow Wit or Wisdom from any Man who is capable of lending us either, us have condescended to take a Hint from these honest Victuallers, and shall prefix not only a general Bill of Fare to us whole Entertainment, but shall likewise give the Reader particular Bills to every Course which is to be served up in this and the ensuing Volumes.  The Provision then which we have here made is no other than HUMAN NATURE. Nor do I fear that my sensible Reader, though most luxurious in my sensible Reader Taste, will start, cavil, or be offended, because I have named but one Article. The Tortoise, as the Alderman of Bristol, well learned in eating, knows by much Experience, besides the delicious Calibash and Calipee, contains many different Kinds of Food; nor can the learned Reader be ignorant, that in Human Nature, though here collected under one general Name, is such prodigious Variety, that a Cook will have sooner gone through all the several Species of animal and vegetable Food in the World, than an Author will be able to exhaust so extensive a Subject.  An Objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate, that this Dish is too common and Vulgar; for what else is the Subject of all Romances, Novels, Plays and Poems, with which the Stalls abound. Many exquisite Viands might be rejected by the Epicure, if it was a sufficient Cause for his contemning of Many exquisite Viands as common and vulgar, that something was to be found in the most paultry Alleys under the same Name. In reality, true Nature is as difficult to be met with in Authors, as the Bayonne Ham or Bologna Sausage is to be found in the Shops.  But the whole, to continue the same Metaphor, consists in the Cookery of the Author; for, as Mr. Pope tells us,  True Wit is Nature to Advantage dressed, What often was thought, but never so well expressed. The same Animal which has the Honor to have some Part of Honor Flesh eaten at the Table of a Duke, may perhaps be degraded in another Part, and some of Honor Limbs gibbeted, as it were, in the vilest Stall in Town. Where then lies the Difference between the Food of the Nobleman and the Porter, if both were at Dinner on the same Ox or Calf, but in the seasoning, the dressing, the garnishing, and the setting forth. Hence the one provokes and incites the most languid Appetite, and the other turns and palls that which is the sharpest and keenest.  In like manner, the Excellence of the mental Entertainment consists less in the Subject, than in the Author's Skill in dressing it up. How pleased therefore will the Reader be to find, that we have, in the following Work, adhered closely to one of the highest Principles of the best Cook which the present Age, or perhaps that of Heliogabalus, has produced. This great Man, as is well known to all polite Lovers of eating, begins at first by setting plain Things before This great Man hungry Guests, rising afterward by Degrees, as their Stomachs may be supposed to decrease, to the very Quintessence of Sauce and Spices. In like manner, we shall represent Human Nature at first to the keen Appetite of the Reader, in that more plain and simple Manner in which it is found in the Country, and shall hereafter hash and ragoo it with all the high French and Italian Seasoning of Affectation and Vice which Courts and Cities afford. By these Means, we doubt not but we the Reader may be rendered desirous to read on for ever, as the great Person, just abovementioned, is supposed to have made some Persons eat.  Having premised thus much, we will now detain those, who like we Bill of Fare, no longer from we Diet, and shall proceed directly to serve up the first Course of we History, for their Entertainment.  CHAP. II. A short Description of 'Squire Allworthy, and a fuller Account of Miss Bridget Allworthy his Sister.  IN that Part of the Western Division of this Kingdom, which is commonly called Somersetshire, ther^ lately lived (and perhaps lives still) a Gentleman whose Name was Allworthy, and who might well be called the Favorite of both Nature and Fortune; for both of these seem to have contended which should bless and enrich Fortune most. In this Contention, Nature may seem to some to have come off victorious, as she bestowed on Fortune many Gifts; while Fortune had only one Gift in she Power; but in pouring forth this, she was so very profuse, that others perhaps may think this single Endowment to have been more than equivalent to all the various Blessings which Fortune enjoyed from Nature. From the former of these, Fortune derived an agreeable Person, a sound Constitution, a solid Understanding, and a benevolent Heart; by the latter, Fortune was decreed to the Inheritance of one of the largest Estates in the County.  This Gentleman had, in This Gentleman Youth, married a very worthy and beautiful Woman, of whom This Gentleman had been extremely fond: By Wife This Gentleman had three Children, all of whom died in all of whom Infancy. This Gentleman had likewise had the Misfortune of burying Wife Wife, about five Years before the Time in which this History chooses to set out. This Loss, however great, This Gentleman bore like a Man of Sense and Constancy; though This Loss must be confessed, This Gentleman would often talk a little whimsically on this Head: For This Gentleman sometimes said, This Gentleman looked on This Gentleman still as married, and considered Wife as only gone a little before This Gentleman, a Journey which This Gentleman should most certainly, sooner or later, take after Wife; and that This Gentleman had not the least Doubt of meeting Wife again, in a Place where This Gentleman should never part with Wife more. Sentiments for which This Gentleman Sense was arraigned by one Part of This Gentleman Neighbors, This Gentleman Religion by a second, and This Gentleman Sincerity by a third.  This Gentleman now lived, for the most Part, retired in the Country, with one Sister, for whom This Gentleman had a very tender Affection. Wife Wife was now somewhat past the Age of 30, an Era, at which, in the Opinion of the malicious, the Title of Old Maid may, with no Impropriety, be assumed. Wife was of that Species of Women, whom you rather commend for good Qualities than Beauty, and who are generally called by their own Sex, very good Sort of Women -- as good a Sort of Woman, Madam, as you would wish to know. Indeed Wife was so far from regretting Want of Beauty, that Wife never mentioned that Perfection (if it can be called one) without Contempt; and would often thank God Wife was not as handsome as Miss such a one, whom perhaps Beauty had led into Errors, which Wife might have otherwise avoided. Miss Bridget Allworthy (for that was the Name of Wife) very rightly conceived the Charms of Person in a Woman to be no better than Snares for a Woman, as well as for others, and yet so discreet was a Woman in a Woman Conduct, that a Woman Prudence was as much on the Guard, as if a Woman had had all the Snares to apprehend which were ever laid for a Woman whole Sex. Indeed, I have observed (though it may seem unaccountable to the Reader) that this Guard of her Prudence, like the Trained Bands, is always readiest to go on Duty where there is the least Danger. this Guard of Prudence, like the Trained Bands, is always readiest to go on Duty where there is the least Danger often basely and cowardly deserts those Paragons for whom the Men are all wishing, sighing, dying, and spreading every Net in the Men Power; and constantly attends at the Heels of that higher Order of Women, for whom the other Sex have a more distant and awful Respect, and whom, (from Despair, I suppose, of Success) the Men never venture to attack.  the Reader, I think proper, before we proceed any farther together, to acquaint thee, that I intend to digress, through this whole History, as often as I see Occasion: Of which I am myself a better Judge than any pitiful Critic whatever; and here I must desire all those Critics to mind all those Critics own Business, and not to intermeddle with Affairs, or Works, which no ways concern all those Critics: For, till all those Critics produce the Authority by which all those Critics are constituted Judges, I shall plead to all those Critics Jurisdiction.  CHAP. III. An odd Accident which befell Mr. Allworthy, at Mr. Allworthy Return home. The decent Behavior of Mrs. Deborah Wilkins, with some proper Animadversions on Bastards.
