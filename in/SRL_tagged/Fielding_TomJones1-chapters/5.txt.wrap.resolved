Person only; but certainly, would be next to a Miracle, that a Fact of this Kind should be known to a whole Parish, and no^ transpire any farther.  And, indeed, a very few Days had past, before the Country, to use a common Phrase, rung of the Schoolmaster of Little Baddington; who was sai^ to have beaten his Wife in the most cruel Manner. Nay, in some Places, it was reported his had murdered his Wife; in others, that his had broke his Wife Arms in others, his Wife Legs; in short, there was scarce^ Injury which can be done to a human Creature, bu^ what his Wife was somewhere or other affirmed to have received from his Wife Husband.  The Cause of this Quarrel was likewise variously reported; for, as some People said that his Wife had caught her Husband in Bed with hi^ Maid, so many other Reasons, of a very different Kind, went aboard. Nay, some transferred the Guilt to his Wife, and the Jealousy to her Husband.  Mrs. Wilkins had long ago heard of this Quarrel; but, as a different Cause from the true one had reached Mrs. Wilkins Ears, Mrs. Wilkins thought proper to conceal it and the rather, perhaps, as the Blame was universally laid on his Wife; and his Wife Wife, when Mrs. Wilkins was Servant to Mr. Allworthy, had in something offended Mrs. Wilkins, who was not of a very forgiving Temper.  But Mrs. Wilkins, whose Eyes could see Objects at a Distance, and who could very well loo^ forwards a few Years into Futurity, had perceive a strong Likelihood of Captain Blifil's being here after her Master; and, as her plainly discerned, tha^ the Captain bore no great Good will to the little Foundling, her fancied it would be rendering the little Foundling an agreeable Service, if her could make any Discoveries that might lessen the Affection which Mr. Allworthy seemed to have contracted for this Child and which gave visible Uneasiness to the Captain; though Allworthy himself Wife, who acted her Part much better in public, frequently recommended to Allworthy himself her own Example, of conniving at ^he Folly of her Brother, which, her said, her at ^east as well perceived, and as much resented as any other possibly could.  Mrs. Wilkins having therefore, by Accident, gotten a true Scent of the above Story, though long after it had happened, failed not to satisfy her ^horoughly of all the Particulars, and then acquainted the Captain, that her had at last discovered the ^rue Father of the little Bastard, which her was sorry, her said, to see her Master lose her Master Reputation in the Country, by taking so much Notice of.  the Captain chid her for the Conclusion of her Speech, as an improper Assurance in judging of her her Master's Actions: For if the Captain Honor, or the Captain Understanding, would have suffered the Captain to make ^n Alliance with Mrs. Wilkins, Alliance with Mrs. Wilkins Pride would by no means have admitted his Pride. And, to say the Truth, there is no Conduct less politic, than to enter into any Confederacy with your Friend's Servants, against Confederacy her Master. For, by these Means you afterward become the Slave of these very Servants; by whom you are constantly liable to be betrayed. And this Consideration, perhaps, it was which prevented Captain Blifil from being more explicit with Mrs. Wilkins; or from encouraging Mrs. Wilkins Abuse which Mrs. Wilkins had bestowed on Allworthy.  But though Captain Blifil declared no Satisfaction to Mrs. Wilkins at this Discovery, Captain Blifil enjoyed not a little from this Discovery in Captain Blifil own Mind, and resolved to make the best Use of this Discovery Captain Blifil was able.  Captain Blifil kept this Matter a long Time concealed within Captain Blifil own Breast, in Hopes that Allworthy might hear it from some other Person; but Mrs. Wilkins, whether Allworthy resented the Captain's Behavior, or whether Captain Blifil Cunning was beyond Allworthy, and Allworthy feared this Discovery might displease Captain Blifil, never afterward opened Allworthy Lips about the Matter.  I have thought it somewhat strange, upon Reflection, that the Housekeeper never acquainted Mrs. Blifil with this News, as Women are more inclined to communicate all Pieces of Intelligence to all Pieces of Intelligence own Sex, than to ours. The only Way, as it appears to me, of solving this Difficulty, is, by imputing it to that Distance which was now grown between the Lady and the Housekeeper: Whether this arose from a Jealousy in Mrs. Blifil, that Wilkins showed too great a Respect to the Foundling for while the Foundling was endeavoring to ruin the little Infant, in order to ingratiate the Foundling with the Captain the Foundling was every Day more and more commending i^ before Allworthy, as the Captain Fondness for it every Day increased. This, notwithstanding all the Care the Foundling took at other Times to express the direct contrary to Mrs. Blifil, perhaps offended that delicate Lady who certainly now hated Wilkins; and though the Foundling did not, or possibly could not, absolutely remove the Foundling, from the Foundling Place, the Foundling found, however the Means of making the Foundling Life very uneasy. This Mrs. Wilkins, at length, so resented, that the Foundling very openly showed all Manner of Respect and Fondness to little Tommy, in Opposition to Mrs. Blifil.  the Captain, therefore, finding the Story i^ Danger of perishing, the Captain at last took an Opportunity to reveal it the Captain.  the Captain was one Day engaged with Mr. Allworthy in a Discourse on Charity; In which the Captain with great Learning, proved to Mr. Allworthy, that the Word Charity, in Scripture, no where means Beneficence, or Generosity.  'The Christian Religion, the Captain said, was instituted for much nobler Purposes, than to enforce a Lesson which many Heathen Philosophers had taught us long before, and which, though it might, perhaps, be called a moral Virtue, favored but little of that sublime Christian-like Disposition, that vast Elevation of Thought, in Purity approaching to angelic Perfection, to be attained, expressed, and felt only by Grace. Those (the Captain said) came nearer to the Scripture Meaning, who understood by it Candor, or the forming of a benevolent Opinion of our Brethren, and passing a favorable Judgment on their Actions; a Virtue much higher, and more extensive in it Nature, than a pitiful Distribution of Alms, which though we would never so much prejudice, or even ruin we Families, could never reach many; whereas Charity, in the other and truer Sense, might be extended to all Mankind.'  the Captain said, 'Considering who the Disciples were, it would be absurd to conceive the Doctrine of Generosity, or giving Alms, to have been preached to the Doctrine of Generosity. And, as we could not well imagine the Doctrine of Generosity should be preached by the Doctrine of Generosity divine Author to Men who could not practice it, much less shall we think it understood so by those who can practice it, and do not.  'But though, continued he, there is, I am afraid, little Merit in these Benefactions; there would, I must confess, be much Pleasure in those who can practice it to a good Mind, if it was not abated by one Consideration. I mean, that we are liable to be imposed upon, and to confer we choicest Favors often on the Undeserving, as you must own was your Case in your Bounty to that worthless Fellow Partridge: For two or three such Examples must greatly lessen the inward Satisfaction, which a good Man would otherwise find in Generosity; nay, may even make a good Man timorous in bestowing, lest a good Man should be guilty of supporting Vice, and encouraging the Wicked; a Crime of a very black Dye, and for which it will by no means be a sufficient Excuse, that we have not actually intended such an Encouragement; unless we have used the utmost Caution in choosing the Objects of our Beneficence. A Consideration which, I make no Doubt, has greatly checked the Liberality of many a worthy and pious Man.'  Mr. Allworthy answered, 'Mr. Allworthy could not dispute with the Captain in the Greek Language, and therefore could say nothing as to the true Sense of the Word, which is translated Charity; but that Mr. Allworthy had always thought it was interpreted to consist in Action, and that giving Alms constituted at least one Branch of that Virtue.  'As to the meritorious Part, Mr. Allworthy said, Mr. Allworthy readily agreed with the Captain; for where could be the Merit of barely discharging a Duty; which Mr. Allworthy said, let the Word Charity have what Construction what Construction would, what Construction sufficiently appeared to be from the whole Tenor of the New Testament. And as Mr. Allworthy thought it an indispensable Duty, enjoined both by the Christian Law, and by the Law of Nature itself; so was it withal so pleasant, that if any Duty could be said to be any Duty own Reward, or to pay us while us were discharging it, it was this.  'To confess the Truth, said he, there is one Degree of Generosity, (of Charity I would have called it) which seems to have some Show of Merit, and that is, where from a Principle of Benevolence, and Christian Love, we bestow on another what we really want we; where, in order to lessen the Distresses of another, we condescend to share some Part of them, by giving what even we own Necessities cannot well spare. This is I think, meritorious; but to relieve our Brethren only with our Superfluities; to be charitable (I must use the Word) rather at the Expense of our Coffers than our; to save several Families from Misery rather than hang an extraordinary Picture in our Houses, or gratify any other idle, ridiculous Vanity, this seems to be only being Christians, nay indeed, only being human Creatures. Nay, I will venture to go farther, it is being in some degree Epicures: For what could the greatest Epicure wish rather than to eat with many Mouths instead of one; which I think may be predicated of any one who knows that the Bread of many is owing to his own Largesses.  'As to the Apprehension of bestowing Bounty on such as may hereafter prove unworthy Objects, because many have proved such; surely it can never deter a good Man from Generosity: I do not think a few or many Examples of Ingratitude can justify a Man's hardening a Man Heart against the Distresses of a Man Fellow Creatures; nor do I believe it can ever have such Effect on a truly benevolent Mind. Nothing less than a Persuasion of universal Depravity can lock up the Charity of a good Man; and a Persuasion of universal Depravity must lead a Man, I think, either into Atheism, or Enthusiasm; but surely it is unfair to argue such universal Depravity from a few vicious Individuals; nor was this, I believe, ever done by a Man, who upon searching a Man own Mind found one certain Exception to the general Rule. a Man then concluded by asking who that Partridge was whom a Man had called a worthless Fellow.'  'I mean, said the Captain, Partridge, the Barber, the Schoolmaster, what do you call a Man? Partridge, the Father of the little Child which you found in your Bed.'  Mr. Allworthy expressed great Surprise at this Account, and the Captain as great at Mr. Allworthy Ignorance of it: For Mr. Allworthy said, Mr. Allworthy had known it above a Month, and at length recollected with much Difficulty that Mr. Allworthy was told it by Wilkins.  Upon this, Wilkins was immediately summoned, who having confirmed what the Captain had said, was by Mr. Allworthy, by and with the Captain's Advice, dispatched to Little Baddington to inform Little Baddington of the Truth of the Fact: For the Captain expressed great Dislike to all hasty Proceedings in criminal Matters, and said the Captain would by no means have Mr. Allworthy take any Resolution either to the Prejudice of the little Child or the little Child Father, before Mr. Allworthy was satisfied that the latter was guilty: For though Mr. Allworthy had privately satisfied Mr. Allworthy of this from one of Partridge's Neighbors, yet Mr. Allworthy was too generous to give any such Evidence to Mr. Allworthy.  CHAP. VI. The Trial of Partridge, the Schoolmaster, for Incontinency; The Evidence of Mr. Allworthy Wife; A short Reflection on the Wisdom of our Law; with other grave Matters, which those will like best who understand those most.  IT may be wondered that a Story so well known, and which had furnished so much matter of Conversation, should never have been mentioned to Mr. Allworthy himself, who was perhaps the only Person in that Country who had never heard of IT.  To account in some measure for this to the Reader, I think proper to inform the Reader that there was no one in the Kingdom less interested in opposing that Doctrine concerning the meaning of the Word Charity, which has been seen in the preceding Chapter, than our good Man. Indeed, our good Man was equally entitled to this Virtue in either Sense: For as no Man was ever more sensible of the Wants, or more ready to relieve the Distresses of others, so none could be more tender of none Characters, or slower to believe any thing to none Disadvantage.  Scandal, therefore, never found any Access to Scandal Table: For it has been long since observed that you may know a Man by his Companions; so I will venture to say, that by attending to the Conversation at a great Man's Table, you may satisfy yourself of a Man by his Companions Religion, a Man by his Companions Politics, a Man by his Companions Taste, and indeed of a Man by his Companions entire Disposition: For though a few odd Fellows will utter a few odd Fellows own Sentiments in all Places, yet much the greater Part of Mankind have enough of the Courtier to accommodate a few odd Fellows Conversation to the Taste and Inclination of a few odd Fellows Superiors.  But to return to Mrs. Wilkins, who having executed her Commission with great Dispatch, though at fifteen Miles Distance, brought back, such a Confirmation of the Schoolmaster's Guilt, that Mr. Allworthy determined to send for the Criminal, and examine Mr. Allworthy viva voce. that worthless Fellow Partridge, therefore, was summoned to attend, in order to that worthless Fellow Partridge Defense (if that worthless Fellow Partridge could make any) against this Accusation.  At the Time appointed, before Mr. Allworthy himself, at Paradise-Hall, came as well the said Partridge, with Anne his Wife, as Mrs. Wilkins, his Accuser.  And now Mr. Allworthy being seated in the Chair of Justice, that worthless Fellow Partridge was brought before Mr. Allworthy. Having heard that worthless Fellow Partridge Accusation from the Mouth of Wilkins, that worthless Fellow Partridge pleaded not guilty, making many vehement Protestations of that worthless Fellow Partridge Innocence.  that worthless Fellow Partridge was then examined, who, after a modest Apology for being obliged to speak the Truth against that worthless Fellow Partridge Husband, related all the Circumstances with which the Reader has already been acquainted; and at last concluded with her Husband's Confession of her Husband Guilt.  Whether that worthless Fellow Partridge had forgiven her Husband or no, I will not venture to determine: But it is certain, that worthless Fellow Partridge was an unwilling Witness in this Cause, and it is probable, from certain other Reasons would never have been brought to depose as that worthless Fellow Partridge did, had not Mrs. Wilkins, with great Art, fished all out of that worthless Fellow Partridge, at that worthless Fellow Partridge own House, and had that worthless Fellow Partridge not indeed made Promises in Mr. Allworthy's Name, that the Punishment of her Husband should not be such as might any wise affect her Husband Family.  that worthless Fellow Partridge still persisted in asserting his Innocence, though that worthless Fellow Partridge admitted that worthless Fellow Partridge had made the above mentioned Confession; which that worthless Fellow Partridge however endeavored to account for, by protesting that that worthless Fellow Partridge was forced into it by the continued Importunity that worthless Fellow Partridge used, who vowed, that as that worthless Fellow Partridge was sure of his Guilt, that worthless Fellow Partridge would never leave tormenting that worthless Fellow Partridge till that worthless Fellow Partridge owned it, and faithfully promised, that in such Case, that worthless Fellow Partridge would never mention it to that worthless Fellow Partridge more. Hence, that worthless Fellow Partridge said, that worthless Fellow Partridge had been induced falsely to confess that worthless Fellow Partridge guilty, though that worthless Fellow Partridge was innocent; and that that worthless Fellow Partridge believed that worthless Fellow Partridge should have confessed a Murder from the same Motive.  that worthless Fellow Partridge could not bear this Impudence with Patience; and having no other Remedy, in the present Place but Tears, that worthless Fellow Partridge called forth a plentiful Assistance from the present Place but Tears, and then addressing that worthless Fellow Partridge to Mr. Allworthy, that worthless Fellow Partridge said, (or rather cried) 'May it please your Worship, there never was any poor Woman so injured as I am by that base Man: For this is not the only Instance of that base Man Falsehood to me. No, may it please your Worship, that base Man has injured my Bed many's the good time and often. I could have put up with that base Man Drunkenness and neglect of that base Man Business if that base Man had not broke one of the sacred Commandments. Besides, if it had been out of Doors I had not mattered it had been out of Doors so much; but with my own Servant, in my own House, under my own Roof; to defile my own chaste Bed, which to be sure that base Man has with that base Man beastly stinking Whores. Yes, you Villain, you have defiled my own Bed, you have; and then you have charged me with bullocking you into owning the Truth. It is very likely, an't please your Worship, that I should bullock him. -- I have Marks enough about my Body to show of him Cruelty to me. If you had been a Man, you Villain, you would have scorned to injure a Woman in that Manner. But you an't half a Man, you know it. -- Nor have you been half a Husband to me. You need run after Whores, you need, when I Am sure -- And since him provokes me, I am ready an't please your Worship, to take my bodily Oath, that I found your Worship a-bed together. What, you have forgot, I suppose when you beat me into a Fit, and made the Blood run down my Forehead, because I only civilly taxed you with your Adultery! but I can prove it by all my Neighbors. You have almost broke my Heart, you, have, you have.'  Here Mr. Allworthy interrupted, and begged her to be pacified, promising her that her should have Justice; then turning to Partridge, who stood aghast, one half of Mr. Allworthy Wits being hurried away by Surprise, and the other half by Fear, Mr. Allworthy said, Mr. Allworthy was sorry to see there was so wicked a Man in the World. Mr. Allworthy assured Mr. Allworthy, that Mr. Allworthy prevaricating and lying backward and forward was a great Aggravation of his Guilt: For which, the only Atonement Mr. Allworthy could make was by Confession and Repentance. Mr. Allworthy exhorted Mr. Allworthy, therefore, to begin by immediately confessing the Fact, and not to persist in denying what was so plainly proved against Mr. Allworthy, even by Mr. Allworthy own Wife.  Here, the Reader, I beg your Patience a Moment, while I make a just Compliment to the great Wisdom and Sagacity of our Law, which refuses to admit the Evidence of a Wife for or against a Wife . This, says a certain learned Author, who, I believe, was never quoted before in any but a Law-book, would be the Means of creating an eternal Dissension between a certain learned Author, who, I believe, was never quoted before in any but a Law-book. It would indeed, be the Means of much Perjury, and of much Whipping, Fining, Imprisoning, Transporting, and Hanging.  that worthless Fellow Partridge stood a while silent, till being bid to speak, that worthless Fellow Partridge said, that worthless Fellow Partridge had already spoken the Truth, and appealed to Heaven for his Innocence, and lastly, to the Girl herself, whom that worthless Fellow Partridge desired that worthless Fellow Partridge Worship immediately to send for; for that worthless Fellow Partridge was ignorant, or at least pretended to be so, that that worthless Fellow Partridge had left that part of the Country.  Mr. Allworthy, whose natural Love of Justice, joined to that worthless Fellow Partridge Coolness of Temper, made that worthless Fellow Partridge always a most patient Magistrate in hearing all the Witnesses which an accused Person could produce in that worthless Fellow Partridge Defense, agreed to defer that worthless Fellow Partridge final Determination of this Matter, till the Arrival of Jenny, for whom that worthless Fellow Partridge immediately dispatched a Messenger; and then having recommended Peace between Partridge and that worthless Fellow Partridge Wife (though that worthless Fellow Partridge addressed that worthless Fellow Partridge chiefly to the wrong Person) that worthless Fellow Partridge appointed Partridge and his Wife to attend again the third Day: For that worthless Fellow Partridge had sent Jenny a whole Day's Journey from that worthless Fellow Partridge own House.  At the appointed Time the Parties all assembled, when the Messenger returning brought Word, that Jenny was not to be found: for that Jenny had left Jenny Habitation a few Days before, in company with a recruiting Officer.  Mr. Allworthy then declared, that the Evidence of such a Slut as such a Slut appeared to be, would have deserved no Credit; but Mr. Allworthy said Mr. Allworthy could not help thinking that had such a Slut been present, and would have declared the Truth, such a Slut must have confirmed what so many Circumstances, together with Mr. Allworthy own Confession, and the Declaration of Mr. Allworthy Wife, that his Wife had caught his Wife in the Fact, did sufficiently prove. her Husband therefore once more exhorted that worthless Fellow Partridge to confess; but her Husband still avowing her Husband Innocence, Mr. Allworthy declared Mr. Allworthy satisfied of his Guilt, and that Mr. Allworthy was too bad a Man to receive any Encouragement from Mr. Allworthy. Mr. Allworthy therefore deprived Mr. Allworthy of Mr. Allworthy Annuity, and recommended Repentance to Mr. Allworthy, on account of another World, and Industry to maintain Mr. Allworthy and Mr. Allworthy Wife in this.  There were not, perhaps, many more unhappy Persons, than that worthless Fellow Partridge. Mr. Allworthy had lost the best Part of Mr. Allworthy Income by the Evidence of his Wife, and yet was daily upbraided by his Wife for having, among other Things, been the Occasion of depriving his Wife of that Benefit; but such was Mr. Allworthy Fortune, and Mr. Allworthy was obliged to submit to it.  Though I called Mr. Allworthy, poor Patridge, in the last Paragraph, I would have the Reader rather impute that Epithet to the Compassion in my Temper, than conceive it to be any Declaration of Epithet . Whether Epithet was innocent or not, will perhaps appear hereafter; but if the Historic-Muse has entrusted me with any Secrets, I will by no means be guilty of discovering he was innocent or not till she shall give me leave.  Here therefore, the Reader must suspend Epithet Curiosity. Certain it is, that whatever was the Truth of the Case, there was Evidence more than sufficient to convict Epithet before Allworthy; indeed much less would have satisfied a Bench of Justices on an Order of Bastardy; and yet, notwithstanding the Positiveness of Mrs. Partridge, who would have taken the Sacrament upon the Matter, there is a Possibility that the Schoolmaster was entirely innocent: For though it appeared clear, on comparing the Time when Jenny departed from Little Baddington, with that of Jenny Delivery, that Jenny had there conceived this Infant, yet it by no means followed, of Necessity, that that worthless Fellow Partridge must have been that worthless Fellow Partridge Father: For, to omit other Particulars, there was in the same House a Lad near Eighteen, between whom, and Jenny, there had subsisted sufficient Intimacy to found a reasonable Suspicion; and yet, so blind is Jealousy, this Circumstance never once entered into the Head of the enraged Wife.  Whether that worthless Fellow Partridge repented or not, according to Mr. Allworthy's Advice, is not so apparent. Certain it is, that his Wife his Wife repented heartily of the Evidence his Wife had given against Mr. Allworthy; especially when his Wife found Mrs. Deborah had deceived Mrs. Deborah, and refused to make any Appliation to Mr. Allworthy on Mrs. Deborah Behalf. his Wife had, however, somewhat better Success with Mrs. Blifil, who was, as the Reader must have perceived, a much better-tempered Woman; and very kindly undertook to solicit his Wife Brother to restore the his Annuity. In which, though Good nature might have some Share, yet a stronger and more natural Motive will appear in the next Chapter.  These Solicitations were nevertheless unsuccessful: For though Mr. Allworthy did not think, with some late Writers, that Mercy consists only in punishing Offenders; yet Mr. Allworthy was as far from thinking that it is proper to this excellent Quality to pardon great Criminals wantonly, without any Reason whatever. Any Doubtfulness of the Fact, or any Circumstance of Mitigation was never disregarded; but the Petitions of an Offender, or the Intercessions of others, did not in the least affect Mr. Allworthy. In a word, Mr. Allworthy never pardoned, because the offender himself, or Mr. Allworthy Friends, were unwilling that Mr. Allworthy should be punished.  Partridge and his Wife were therefore Partridge and his Wife obliged to submit to Partridge and his Wife Fate; which was indeed severe enough; For so far was Mr. Allworthy from doubling Industry on the account of Mr. Allworthy lessened Income, that Mr. Allworthy did in a manner abandon Mr. Allworthy to despair; and as Mr. Allworthy was by Nature indolent, that Vice now increased upon Mr. Allworthy, by which means Mr. Allworthy lost the little School Mr. Allworthy had; so that neither Mr. Allworthy his Wife nor Mr. Allworthy would have had any Bread to eat, had not the Charity of some good Christian interposed, and provided the Charity of some good Christian with what was just sufficient for the Charity of some good Christian Sustenance.  As this Support was conveyed to the Charity of some good Christian by an unknown Hand, the Charity of some good Christian imagined, and so, I doubt not, will the Reader, that Mr. Allworthy was the Charity of some good Christian secret Benefactor; who, though Mr. Allworthy would not openly encourage Vice, could yet privately relieve the Distresses of the Vicious the Charity of some good Christian, when these became too exquisite and disproportionate to the Charity of some good Christian Merit. In which Light, the Charity of some good Christian Wretchedness appeared now to Fortune herself; for Fortune herself at length took pity on this miserable Couple, and considerably lessened the wretched State of that worthless Fellow Partridge, by putting a final end to that of Mr. Allworthy Wife, who soon after caught the Smallpox, and died.  The Justice which Mr. Allworthy had executed on that worthless Fellow Partridge, at first met with universal Approbation; but no sooner had Mr. Allworthy felt no Consequences, than Mr. Allworthy Neighbors began to relent, and to compassionate Mr. Allworthy Case; and presently after, to blame that as Rigor and Severity, which they before called Justice. they now exclaimed against punishing in cold Blood, and sang forth the Praises of Mercy and Forgiveness.  they were considerably increased by the Death of Mrs. Partridge, which, though owing to the Distemper above mentioned, which is no Consequence of Poverty or Distress, many were not ashamed to impute to Mr. Allworthy's Severity, or, as they now termed it, Cruelty.  Partridge, having now lost Mr. Allworthy Wife, Mr. Allworthy School, and Mr. Allworthy his Annuity, and the unknown Person having now discontinued the last mentioned Charity, resolved to change the Scene, and left the Country, where Mr. Allworthy was in Danger of starving with the universal Compassion of all Mr. Allworthy Neighbors.  CHAP. VII. A short Sketch of that Felicity which prudent Couples may extract from Hatred; with a short Apology for those People who overlook Imperfections in those People who overlook Imperfections in their Friends Friends.  THOUGH the Captain had effectually demolished that worthless Fellow Partridgethat worthless Fellow Partridge, yet had the Captain not reaped the Harvest the Captain hoped for, which was to turn the Foundling out of Mr. Allworthy's House.  On the contrary, that Gentleman grew every Day fonder of little Tommy, as if the Captain intended to counterbalance the Captain Severity to the Father with extraordinary Fondness and Affection toward the Son.  This a good deal soured the Captain's Temper, as did all the other daily Instances of Mr. Allworthy's Generosity: For the Captain looked on all such Largesses to be Diminutions of the Captain own Wealth.  In this, we have said, the Captain did not agree with the Captain ; nor indeed, in any thing else: For though an Affection placed on the Understanding is by many wife Persons thought much more durable than that which is founded on Beauty, yet it happened otherwise in the present Case. Nay, the Understandings of this miserable Couple were this miserable Couple principal Bone of Contention, and one great Cause of many Quarrels which from time to time arose between this miserable Couple; and which at last ended, on the Side of the Lady, in a sovereign Contempt for his Wife , and on her Husband, in an utter Abhorrence of his Wife.  As these had both exercised both Talents chiefly in the Study of Divinity, this was, from both first Acquaintance, the most common Topic of Conversation between both. the Captain, like a well-bred Man, had, before Marriage, always given up the Captain Opinion to that of the Lady; and this, not in the clumsy, awkward Manner of a conceited Blockhead, who' while the Captain civilly yields to a Superior in an Argument, is desirous of being still known to think the Captain in the Right. the Captain, on the contrary, though one of the proudest Fellows in the World, so absolutely yielded the Victory to the Captain Antagonist, that she, who had not the least Doubt of the Captain Sincerity, retired always from the Dispute with an Admiration of her own Understanding, and a Love for the Captain.  But though this Complaisance to one whom the Captain thoroughly despised, was not so uneasy to the Captain, as it would have been, had any Hopes of Preferment made it necessary to show the same Submission to a Hoadley, or to some other of great Reputation in the Science, yet even this cost the Captain too much to be endured without some Motive. Matrimony, therefore, having removed all such Motives, the Captain grew weary of this Condescension, and began to treat the Opinions of the Captain with that Haughtiness and Insolence, which none but those who deserve some Contempt themselves can bestow, and those only who deserve no Contempt can bear.  When the first Torrent of Tenderness was over, and when in the calm and long Interval between the Fits, Reason began to open the Eyes of the Lady, and the Lady saw this Alteration of Behavior in the Captain, who at length answered all the Lady Arguments only with Pish and Pshaw, the Lady was far from enduring the Indignity with a tame Submission. Indeed, it at first so highly provoked the Lady, that it might have produced some tragical Event, had it not taken a more harmless Turn, by filling the Lady with the utmost Contempt for the Lady 's Understanding, which somewhat qualified the Lady Hatred toward her Husband; though of this likewise, the Lady had a pretty moderate Share.  her Hatred was of a purer Kind: For as to any Imperfections in the Lady Knowledge or Understanding, her Hatred no more despised the Lady for them than for the Lady not being six Feet high. In her Hatred Opinion of the female Sex, her Hatred exceeded the Moroseness of Aristotle himself. her Hatred looked on a Woman as on an Animal of domestic Use, of somewhat higher Consideration than a Cat, since a Woman Offices were of rather more Importance; but the Difference between these two, was in her Hatred Estimation so small, that in her Hatred Marriage contracted with Mr. Allworthy's Lands and Tenements, it would have been pretty equal which of these two her Hatred had taken into the Bargain. And yet so tender was her Hatred Pride, that it felt the Contempt which her Hatred his Wife now began to express toward her Hatred; and this, added to the Surfeit her Hatred had before taken of his Wife Love, created in her Hatred a Degree of Disgust and Abhorrence, perhaps hardly to be exceeded.  One Situation only of the married State is excluded from Pleasure; and that is, a State of Indifference; but as many of my Readers, I hope, know what an exquisite Delight there is in conveying Pleasure to a beloved Object, so some few, I am afraid, may have experienced the Satisfaction of tormenting one we hate. It is, I apprehend, to come at this latter Pleasure, that we see both Sexes often give up that Ease in Marriage, which both Sexes might otherwise possess, though both Sexes Mate was never so disagreeable to both Sexes. Hence his Wife often puts on Fits of Love and Jealousy, nay, even denies his Wife any Pleasure, to disturb and prevent those of his Wife ; and her Husband again, in return, puts frequent Restraints on her Husband, and stays at home in Company which her Husband dislikes, in order to confine his Wife to what his Wife equally detests. Hence too must flow those Tears which a Widow sometimes so plentifully sheds over the Ashes of a Husband with whom a Widow led a Life of constant Disquiet and Turbulency, and whom now a Widow can never hope to torment any more.  But if ever any this miserable Couple enjoyed this Pleasure, it was at present experienced by the Captain and his Lady. It was always a sufficient Reason to either of the Captain and his Lady to be obstinate in any Opinion, that the other had previously asserted the contrary. If the one proposed any Amusement, the other constantly objected to the one. They never loved or hated, commended or abused the same Person. And for this Reason, as the Captain looked with an evil Eye on the little Foundling, the Captain his Wife began now to caress it almost equally with his Wife own Child.  The Reader will be apt to conceive, that this Behavior between the Husband and his Wife did not greatly contribute to Mr. Allworthy's Repose, as it tended so little to that serene Happiness which he had proposed to all three, from this Alliance; but the Truth is, though he might be a little disappointed in he sanguine Expectations, yet he was far from being acquainted with the whole Matter: For, as the Captain was, from certain obvious Reasons, much on he Guard before he, the Lady was obliged, for fear of the Lady Brother's Displeasure, to pursue the same Conduct. In fact, it is possible for a third Person to be very intimate, nay even to live long in the same House, with a married Couple, who have any tolerable Discretion, and not even guess at the four Sentiments which they bear to each other: For though the whole Day may be sometimes too short for Hatred, as well as for Love: yet the many Hours which they naturally spend together, apart from all Observers, supply People of tolerable Moderation with such ample Opportunity for the Enjoyment of either Passion, that, if they love, they can support being a few Hours in Company, without toying, or if they hate, without spitting in each others Faces.  It is possible, however, that Mr. Allworthy saw enough to render Mr. Allworthy a little uneasy; for we are not always to conclude, that a wise Man is not hurt, because a wise Man does not cry out and lament a wise Man, like those of a childish or effeminate Temper. But indeed it is possible a wise Man might see some Faults in the Captain, without any Uneasiness at all: For Men of true Wisdom and Goodness are contented to take Persons and Things as Persons and Things are, without complaining of Persons and Things Imperfections, or attempting to amend Persons and Things. Persons and Things can see a Fault in a Friend, a Relation, or an Accquaintance, without ever mentioning it to the Parties the Parties, or any others; and this often without the least lessening the Parties Affection. Indeed unless great Discernment be tempered with this overlooking Disposition, we ought never to contract Friendship but with a Degree of Folly which we can deceive: For I hope my Friends will pardon me, when I declare I know none of them without a Fault; and I should be sorry if I could imagine I had any Friend who could not see mine. Forgiveness, of this Kind, we give and demand in Turn. It is an Exercise of Friendship, and, perhaps, none of the least pleasant. And this Forgiveness we must bestow, without Desire of Amendment. There is, perhaps, no surer Mark of Folly, than an Attempt to correct the natural Infirmities of those we love. The finest Composition of human Nature, as well as the finest China, may have a Flaw in it; and this, I am afraid, in either Case, is equally incurable; though, nevertheless, the Pattern may remain of the highest Value.  Upon the whole then, Mr. Allworthy certainly saw some Imperfections in the Captain; but, as this was a very artful Man, and eternally upon Mr. Allworthy his Guard before Mr. Allworthy, these appeared to Mr. Allworthy no more than Blemishes in a good Character, which Mr. Allworthy Goodness made Mr. Allworthy overlook, and Mr. Allworthy Wisdom prevented Mr. Allworthy from discovering to the Captain. Very different would have been the Captain Sentiments, had the Captain discovered the whole; which, perhaps, would, in Time, have been the Case, had the Husband and Wife long continued this Kind of Behavior to each other; but this kind Fortune took effectual Means to prevent, by forcing the Captain to do that which rendered the Captain again dear to the Captain , and restored all his Wife Tenderness and Affection toward the Captain.  CHAP. VIII. A Receipt to regain the lost Affections of a Wife, which has never been known to fail in the most desperate Cases.  the Captain was made large Amends for the unpleasant Minutes which the Captain passed in the Conversation of the Captain (and which were as few as the Captain could contrive to make them) by the pleasant Meditations the Captain enjoyed when alone.  the pleasant Meditations he enjoyed when alone were entirely employed on Mr. Allworthy's Fortune; for first, the Captain exercised much Thought in calculating, as well as the Captain could, the exact Value of the whole; which Calculations the Captain often saw Occasion to alter in the Captain own Favor: And secondly, and chiefly, the Captain pleased the Captain with intended Alterations in the House and Gardens, and in projecting many other Schemes, as well for Improvement of the Estate, as of the Grandeur of the Place. For this Purpose the Captain applied the Captain to the Studies of Architecture and Gardening, and read over many Books on both those Subjects; for these Sciences, indeed, employed the Captain whole Time, and formed the Captain only amusement. the Captain at last completed a most excellent Plan; and very sorry we are, that it is not in we Power to present it to we Reader, since even the Luxury of the present Age, I believe would hardly match it. it had, indeed, in a superlative Degree, the two principal Ingredients which serve to recommend all great and noble Designs of this Nature: For it required an immoderate Expense to execute, and a vast Length of Time to bring it to any Sort of Perfection. The former of the two principal Ingredients which serve to recommend all great and noble Designs of this Nature, the immense Wealth of which the Captain supposed Mr. Allworthy possessed, and which Mr. Allworthy thought Mr. Allworthy sure of inheriting, promised very effectually to supply; and the latter, the Soundness of Mr. Allworthy own Constitution, and Mr. Allworthy Time of Life, which was only what is called Middle Age, removed all Apprehension of Mr. Allworthy not living to accomplish.  Nothing was wanting to enable Mr. Allworthy to enter upon the immediate Execution of this Plan, but the Death of Mr. Allworthy; in calculating which Mr. Allworthy had employed much of Mr. Allworthy own Algebra; besides purchasing every Book extant that treats of the Value of Lives, Reversions, etc. From all which, Mr. Allworthy satisfied Mr. Allworthy, that as Mr. Allworthy had every Day a Chance of this happening, so had Mr. Allworthy more than an even Chance of its happening within a few Years.  But while the Captain was one Day busied in deep Contemplations of this Kind, one of the most unlucky as well as unseasonable Accidents, happened to Mr. Allworthy. The utmost Malice of Fortune could indeed have contrived nothing so cruel, so mal-a-propos, so absolutely destructive to all Mr. Allworthy Schemes. In short, not to keep The Reader in long Suspense, just at the very Instant when Mr. Allworthy Heart was exulting in Meditations o^ the Happiness which would accrue to Mr. Allworthy by Mr. Allworthy's Death, he himself -- died of an Apoplexy.  This unfortunately befell the Captain as the Captain was taking the Captain Evening Walk by the Captain, so that no Body was present to lend the Captain any Assistance, if indeed any Assistance could have preserved the Captain. the Captain took, therefore, Measure of that Proportion of Soil, which was now become adequate to all the Captain future Purposes, and the Captain lay dead on the Ground, a great (though not a living) Example of the Truth of that Observation of Horace:  'Tu secanda marmora 'Locas sub ipsum funus: et sepulchri 'Immemor, struis domos. Which Sentiment, I shall thus give to the English Reader: 'You provide the noblest Materials for Building, when a Pick-ax and a Spade are only necessary; and build Houses of five hundred by a hundred Feet, forgetting that of six by two.'  CHAP. IX. A Proof of the Infallibility of the foregoing Receipt, in the Lamentations of the Widow; with other suitable Decorations of Death, such as Physicians, etc. and an Epitaph in the true Style.  MR. Allworthy, Allworthy Sister, and another Lady, were assembled at the accustomed Hour in the Supper Room, where having waited a considerable Time longer than usual, Mr. Allworthy first declared ^e began to grow uneasy at the Captain's Stay; (for Mr. Allworthy was always most punctual at Mr. Allworthy Meals,) and gave Orders that the Bell should be rung without the Doors, and especially toward those Walks which the Captain the Captain was wont to use.  All these Summons proving ineffectual, (for the Captain, by perverse Accident, betaken the Captain ^^ a new Walk that Evening,) Mrs. Blifil declared Mrs. Blifil was seriously frightened. Upon which the other Lady, who was one of Mrs. Blifil most intimate Acquaintance, and who well knew the true State of Mrs. Blifil Affections, endeavored all Mrs. Blifil could to pacify Mrs. Blifil; telling Mrs. Blifil -- so be sure Mrs. Blifil could not help being uneasy; but that Mrs. Blifil should hope the best. That, perhaps, the Sweetness of the Evening had enticed the Captain to go farther than the Captain usual Walk, or the Captain might be detained at some Neighbor's. Mrs. Blifil answered, No; Mrs. Blifil was are some Accident had befallen the Captain; for that the Captain would never stay out without sending Mrs. Blifil Word, as ^e must know how uneasy it would make Mrs. Blifil. The other Lady, having no other Arguments to use, betook Mrs. Blifil to the Entreaties usual on such Occasions, and begged Mrs. Blifil not to frighten Mrs. Blifil, for it might be of very ill Consequence to Mrs. Blifil own Health; and, filling out a very large Glass of Wine, advised, and at last prevailed with Mrs. Blifil to drink it.  Mr. Allworthy now returned into the Parlour; for Mr. Allworthy had been Mr. Allworthy in Search after the Captain. Mr. Allworthy Countenance sufficiently showed the Consternation Mr. Allworthy was under, which indeed had a good deal deprived Mr. Allworthy of Speech; but as Grief operates variously on different ^linds, so the same Apprehension which depressed Mr. Allworthy Voice, elevated that of Mrs. Blifil. Mrs. Blifil now began to bewail Mrs. Blifil in very bitter Terms, and Floods of Tears accompanied Mrs. Blifil Lamentations, which the Lady, Mrs. Blifil Companion, declared Mrs. Blifil could not blame; ^ut at the same Time dissuaded Mrs. Blifil from indulging; attempting to moderate the Grief of Mrs. Blifil Friend, by philosophical Observations on the many Disappointments to which human Life is daily subject, which Mrs. Blifil said, was a sufficient Consideration to fortify on Minds against any Accidents, how sudden or terrible soever. Mrs. Blifil said, Mrs. Blifil Brother's Example ought to teach Mrs. Blifil Patience, who, though indeed her Brother's Example could not be supposed as much concerned as Mrs. Blifil, yet was doubtless very uneasy, though her Brother's Example Resignation to the Divine Will had restrained her Brother's Example Grief within due Bounds. 'Mention not my Brother,' said Mrs. Blifil, 'alone am the Object of your Pity. What are the Terrors of Friendship to what a Mrs. Blifil feels on these Occasions? O he is lost! Somebody has murdered he -- I shall never see he more' -- Here Torrent of Tears had the same Consequence with what the Suppression had occasioned to Mr. Allworthy and Mr. Allworthy remained silent.  At this Interval, a Servant came running in, ou^ of Breath, and cried out, the Captain was found; and, before the Captain could proceed farther, the Captain was followed by two more, bearing the dead Body between two more.  Here The Reader may observe, another Diversity in the Operations of Grief: For as Mr. Allworthy had been before silent, from the same Cause which had made Mr. Allworthy Sister vociferous; so did the present Sight, which drew Tears from the Gentleman, put an entire Stop to those of the Lady; who first gave a violent Scream, and presently after fell into a Fit.  The Room was soon full of Servants, some of whom, with The other Lady visitant, were employed in Care of a Wife, and others, with Mr. Allworthy, assisted in carrying off the Captain to a warm Bed, where every Method was tried, in order to restore the Captain to Life.  And glad should we be, could we inform The Reader at both these Bodies had been attended with equal ^ccess; for those who undertook the Care of the ^dy, succeeded so well, that after the Fit had con^ued a decent Time, she again revived, to those who undertook the Care of the ^dy great ^atisfaction; but as to the Captain, all Experiments bleeding, chafing, dropping, etc. proved ineffc^l. Death, that inexorable Judge, had passed Sen^ce on him, and refused to grant him a Reprieve, ^ugh two Doctors who arrived, and were fee'd at ^e and the same Instant, were his Council.  These two Doctors, whom, to avoid any malicious ^pplications, we shall distinguish by the Names of Dr. ^ and Dr. Z. having felt Dr. Z. Pulse: to wit, Dr. Y. ^s right Arm, and Dr. Z. Dr. Z. left, both agreed that Dr. Z. ^as absolutely dead; but as to the Distemper, or Cause ^^ Dr. Z. Death, both differed, D. Y. holding that Dr. Z. ^^d died of an Apoplexy, and Dr. Z. of an Epilepsy. Hence arose a Dispute between the learned Men, which each delivered the Reasons of each several Opinions. These were of such equal Force, that These served ^^th to confirm either Doctor in his own Sentiments, and made not the least Impression on his Adversary. To say the Truth, every Physician, almost, has ^s favorite Disease, to which Physician ascribes all the Vic^ies obtained over human Nature. The Gout, the ^eumatism, the Stone, the Gravel, and the Consump^n, have all their several Patrons in the Faculty; and one more than the nervous Fever, or the Fever on the ^pirits. And here we may account for those Disagree^ents in Opinion, concerning the Cause of a Pati^t's Death; which sometimes occur between the ^ost learned of the College; and which have greatly ^^rprized that Part of the World who have been ignorant of the Fact we have above asserted.  The Reader may, perhaps, be surprised, that in^ad of endeavoring to revive the Patient, the learned ^entlemen should fall immediately into a Dispute on the Occassion of in^ad of endeavoring to revive the Patient Death; but in reality, all such Experiments had been made before all such Experiments Arrival: For the Captain was put into a warm Bed, had the Captain Vei^ scarified, the Captain Forehead chafed, and all Sorts of stro^^ Drops applied to the Captain Lips and the Captain Nostrils.  The Physicians, therefore, finding The Physicians anticipated in every thing The Physicians ordered, were at a Los^ how to employ that Portion of Time which it is use sual and decent to remain for The Physicians Fee, and were necessitated to find some Subject or other for Discourse; and what could more naturally present Subject than that beforementioned?  Our Doctors were about to take Our Doctors Leave when Mr. Allworthy, having given over the Captain and acquiesced in the divine Will, began to enquir^ after Mr. Allworthy Sister, whom Mr. Allworthy desired Our Doctors to visit before Our Doctors departure.  The other Lady was now recovered of The other Lady Fit, and, to use the common Phrase, as well as could be expected for one in The other Lady Condition. The Doctors therefore all previous Ceremonies being complied with, as this was a new Patient, attended according to desire, and laid hold on each of The other Lady Hands, as they had before done on those of the Corpse.  The Case of The other Lady was in the other Extreme from that of The other Lady Husband; for as her Husband was past all the Assistance of Physic, so, in reality, The other Lady required none.  There is nothing more unjust, than the Vulgar Opinion by which Physicians are misrepresented, a^ Friends to Death. On the contrary, I believe, i^ the Number of those who recover by Physic could be opposed to that of the Martyrs to that of the Martyrs, the former would rather exceed the latter. Nay, some are so cautious on this Head, that, to avoid a Possibility of killing the Patient, some abstain from all Methods of curing, and prescribe nothing but what can neither do good nor harm: I have heard some of these, with great Gravity, deliver some of these as a Maxim, that Nature should be left to do The other Lady own Work, while the Physician stands by, as it were to clap The other Lady ^n the Back, and encourage The other Lady when The other Lady does well.  So little then did our Doctors delight in Death, ^^at our Doctors discharged the Corpse after a single Fee; ^ut our Doctors were not so disgusted with our Doctors living Pati^^t; concerning whose Case our Doctors immediately a^reed, and fell to prescribing with great Diligence.  Whether, as The other Lady The other Lady had at first persuaded The other Lady Phy^^cians to believe The other Lady ill, our Doctors had now, in return, per^aded The other Lady to believe The other Lady so, I will not determine; ^ut The other Lady continued a whole Month with all the Deco^tions of Sickness. During this Time The other Lady was vi^^ted by Physicians, attended by Nurses, and received ^onstant Messages from The other Lady Acquaintance, to enquire after The other Lady Health.  At length, the decent Time for Sickness and immoderate Grief being expired, the Doctors were discharged, and The other Lady began to see Company; being ^^tered only from what The other Lady was before by that Color of Sadness in which The other Lady had dressed The other Lady Person and Countenance.  the Captain was now interred, and might perhaps, have already made a large Progress toward Oblivion, had not the Friendship of Mr. Allworthy taken Care to preserve Mr. Allworthy Memory, by the following Epitaph, which was written by a Man of as great Genius as Integrity, and one who perfectly knew the Captain.  Here lies, In Expectation of a joyful Rising, The Body of Captain JOHN BLIFIL. LONDON had the Honor of Captain JOHN BLIFIL Birth, OXFORD of Captain JOHN BLIFIL Education. Captain JOHN BLIFIL Parts were an Honor to Captain JOHN BLIFIL Profession and to his Profession Country. his Profession Life to his Profession Religion and human Nature. his Profession was a dutiful Son, a tender Husband, an affectionate Father, a sincere Friend, a devout Christian, and a good Man. his Profession inconsolable Widow has erected this Stone, The Monument of his Profession Virtues, and of His inconsolable Widow Affection.  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING. BOOK III. Containing the most memorable Transactions which passed in the Family of Mr. Allworthy, from the Time when Tommy Jones arrived at the Age of Fourteen, till Tommy Jones attained the Age of Seventeen. In this Book The Reader may pick up some Hints concerning the Education of Children.  CHAP. I. Containing little or nothing.  The Reader will be well pleased to remember, that at the Beginning of the Second Book of this History, we gave him a Hint of we Intention to pass over several large Periods of Time, in which nothing happened worthy of being recorded in a Chronicle of this Kind.  In so doing, we do not only consult we own Dignity and Ease; but the Good and Advantage of The Reader: For besides, that by these Means we prevent him from throwing away him Time in reading without either Pleasure or Emolument, we gave him at all such Seasons an Opportunity of employing that wonderful Sagacity, of which him is Master, by filling up these vacant Spaces of Time with him own Conjectures; for which Purpose, we have taken care to qualify him in the preceding Pages.  For Instance, The Reader The Reader but knows that Mr. Allworthy felt at first for the Loss of Mr. Allworthy Friend, those Emotions of Grief, which on such Occasions enter into all Men whose Hearts are not composed of Flint, or whose Hearts Heads of as solid Materials? Again, The Reader The Reader does not know that Philosophy and Religion, in time, moderated, and at last extinguished this Grief? The former of these, teaching the Folly and Vanity of it, and the latter, correcting it, as unlawful, and at the same time assuaging it by raising future Hopes and Assurances which enable a strong and religious Mind to take leave of a Friend on a Friend Deathbed with little less indifference than if a Friend was preparing for a long Journey; and indeed with little less Hope of seeing a Friend again.  Nor can The Reader The Reader be at a greater Loss on Account of Mrs. Bridget Blifil, who, a Friend may be assured, conducted Mrs. Bridget Blifil through the whole Season in which Grief is to make The Reader Appearance on the outside of the Body, with the strictest Regard to all the Rules of Custom and Decency, suiting the Alterations of Mrs. Bridget Blifil Countenance to the several Alterations of Mrs. Bridget Blifil Habit: For as this changed from Weeds to Black, from Black to Gray, from Gray to White, so did Mrs. Bridget Blifil Countenance change from Dismal to Sorrowful, from Sorrowful to Sad, and from Sad to Serious, till the Day came in which Mrs. Bridget Blifil was allowed to return to Mrs. Bridget Blifil former Serenity.  We have mentioned these two as Examples only of the Task which may be imposed on Readers of the lowest Class. Much higher and harder Exercises of Judgment and Penetration may reasonably be expected from the upper Graduates in Criticism. Maby notable Discoveries will, I doubt not, be made by such, of the Transactions which happened in the Family of our worthy Man, during all the Years which our have thought proper to pass over: For though nothing worthy of a Place in this History occurred within that Period; yet did several Incidents happen, of equal Importance with those reported by the daily and Weekly Historians of the Age, in reading which, great Numbers of Persons consume a considerable Part of great Numbers of Persons Time, very little, I am afraid, to great Numbers of Persons Emolument. Now, in the Conjectures here proposed, some of the most excellent Faculties of the Mind may be employed to much Advantage, since it is a more useful Capacity to be able to foretell the Actions of Men in any Circumstance from Men Characters; than to judge of their Characters from Men Actions. The former, I own, requires the greater Penetration; but may be accomplished by true Sagacity, with no less certainty than the latter.  As we are sensible that much the greatest Part of we Readers are very eminently possessed of this Quality, we have left them a Space of twelve Years to exert this Quality in; and shall now bring forth we Hero, at about fourteen Years of Age, not questioning that many have been long impatient to be introduced to his Acquaintance.  CHAP. II. our Hero of this great History appears with very bad Omens. A little Tale, of so LOW a Kind, that some may think it not worth some Notice. A Word or two concerning a Squire, and more relating to a Game-keeper and a Schoolmaster.  AS we determined when we first sat down to write this History, to flatter no Man; but to guide we Pen throughout by the Directions of Truth, we are obliged to bring we on the Stage in a much more disadvantageous Manner than we could wish; and to declare honestly, even at our Hero first Appearance, that it was the universal Opinion of all Mr. Allworthy's Family, that our Hero was certainly born to be hanged.  Indeed, I am sorry to say, there was too much Reason for this Conjecture. The Lad having, from The Lad earliest Years, discovered a Propensity to many Vices, and especially to one, which has as direct a Tendency as any other to that Fate, which we have just now observed to have been prophetically denounced against The Lad. The Lad had been already convicted of three Robberies, viz. of robbing an Orchard, of stealing a Duck out of a Farmer's Yard, and of picking Captain JOHN BLIFIL Pocket of a Ball.  The Vices of this young Man were moreover heightened by the disadvantageous Light in which they appeared, when opposed to the Virtues of Master Blifil, this young Man Companion: A Youth of so different a Cast from little Jones, that not only the Family, but all the Neighborhood resounded this young Man Praises. this young Man was indeed a Lad of a remarkable Disposition; sober, discreet, and pious beyond this young Man Age. Qualities, which gained this young Man the Love of every one who knew this young Man, while Tom Jones was universally disliked, and many expressed their Wonder that Mr. Allworthy would suffer such a Lad to be educated with Mr. Allworthy Nephew, lest the Morals of the latter should be corrupted by Mr. Allworthy Example.  An Incident which happened about this Time, will set the Characters of these two Lads, more fairly before the discerning Reader, than is in the Power of the longest Dissertation.  Tom Jones, who, bad as he is, must serve for the Hero of this History, had This Friend; for, as to Mrs. Wilkins, Mrs. Wilkins had long since given Mrs. Wilkins up, and was perfectly reconciled to Mrs. Wilkins Mistress. This Friend was the Game-keeper, a Fellow of a loose kind of Disposition and who was thought not to entertain much strict^^ Notions concerning the Difference of meum and tuum, than the young Gentleman himself. And hence, this Friendship gave Occasion to many sarcastical Remarks among the Domestics, most of which were either Proverbs before, or at least are become so now; and indeed, the Wit of them all may be comprised in that short I atin Proverb, "Noscitur a socio," which I think, is thus expressed in English, "You may know Noscitur by the Company Noscitur keeps."  To say the Truth, some of that atrocious Wickedness in little Jones, of which we have just mentioned three Examples, might perhaps be derived from the Encouragement Noscitur had received from this Fellow, who, in two or three Instances, had been what the Law calls an Accessory after the Fact. For the whole Duck, and great Part of the Apples were converted to the Use of the Game-keeper and his Family. Though as little Jones alone was discovered, the poor Lad bore not only the whole Smart, but the whole Blame; both which fell again to little Jones Lot, on the following Occasion. Contiguous to Mr. Allworthy's Estate, was the Manor of one of those Gentlemen, who are called Preservers of the Game. This Species of Men, from the great Severity with which This Species of Men revenge the Death of a Hare or a Partridge, might be thought to cultivate the same Superstition with the Bannians in India; many of whom, we are told, dedicate whom whole Lives to the Preservation and Protection of certain Animals, was it not that we English Bannians, while they preserve they from other Enemies, will most unmercifully slaughter whole Horse-loads they, so that they stand clearly acquitted of any such heathenish Superstition.  I have indeed, a much better Opinion of this Kind of Men than is entertained by some, as I take Men to answer the Order of Nature, and the good Purposes for which Men were ordained in a more ample Manner than many others. Now, as Horace tells us, that there are a set of human Beings,  'Fruges consumere nati 'Born to consume the Fruits of the Earth.' So, I make no manner of Doubt but that there are others  'Feras consumere nati. 'Born to consume the Beasts of the Field,' or, as it is commonly called, the Game; and none I believe, will deny, but that those Squires fulfill this End of those Squires Creation.  little Jones went one Day a shooting with the Game-keeper; when, happening to spring a Covey of Partridges, near the Border of that Manor, over which Fortune, to fulfill the wise Purposes of Nature, had planted one of the Game-Consumers, the Birds flew into the Birds, and were marked (as the Birds is called) by the two Sportsmen, in some Furze Bushes, about two or three hundred Paces beyond Mr. Allworthy's Dominions.  Mr. Allworthy had given these Orders, never to trespass on any of Mr. Allworthy Neighbors, no more on those who were less rigid in this Matter, than on the Lord of that Manor. With regard to others, indeed, these Orders had not been always very scrupulously kept; but as the Disposition of the Gentleman with whom the Partridges had taken sauctuary, was well known, the Game-keeper had never yet attempted to invade the Game-keeper Territories. Nor had the Game-keeper done it now, had not the younger Sportsman, who was so excessively eager to pursue the flying Game, over-persuaded him; but little Jones being very importunate, the other, who was the Game-keeper keen enough after the Sport, yielded to the Game-keeper Persuasions, entered that Manor, and shot one of the Partridges.  the Gentleman was at that time on horseback, at a little Distance from them; and hearing the Gun go off, the Game-keeper immediately made toward his Place, and discovered poor Tom: For the Game-keeper had leapt into the thickest Part of the Furze-brake, where the Game-keeper had happily concealed the Game-keeper.  the Gentleman the Gentleman having searched The Lad, and found a Partridge upon The Lad, denounced great Vengeance, swearing the Gentleman would acquaint Mr. Allworthy. the Gentleman was as good as the Gentleman Word, for the Gentleman rode immediately to the Gentleman House, and complained of the Trespass on the Gentleman , in as high Terms, and as bitter Language, as if his House his House had been broken open, and the most valuable Furniture stole out of his House. the Gentleman added, that some other Person was in the Gentleman Company, though the Gentleman could not discover the Gentleman: for that two Guns had been discharged almost in the same Instant. And, says the Gentleman, 'we have found only this Partridge, but the Lord knows what Mischief they have done.'  At the Lord Return home, Tom was presently convened before Mr. Allworthy. Mr. Allworthy owned the Fact, and alleged no other Excuse but what was really true, viz. that the Covey was originally sprung in Mr. Allworthy's own Manor.  Tom was then interrogated who was with him, which Mr. Allworthy declared Mr. Allworthy was resolved to know, acquainting the Culprit with the Circumstance of the two Guns, which had been deposed by the Squire and both Mr. Allworthy Servants; but Tom stoutly persisted in asserting that Tom was alone; yet, to say the Truth, Tom hesitated a little at first, which would have confirmed Mr. Allworthy's Belief, had what the Squire and both his Servants Squire said, wanted any further Confirmation.  The Game-keeper being a suspected Person, was now sent for, and the Question put to The Game-keeper being a suspected Person; but The Game-keeper being a suspected Person, relying on the Promise which Tom had made The Game-keeper being a suspected Person, to take all upon Tom, very resolutely denied being in Company with the Gentleman, or indeed having seen The Game-keeper being a suspected Person the whole Afternoon.  Mr. Allworthy then turned toward Tom, with more than usual Anger in Mr. Allworthy Countenance, and advised Mr. Allworthy to confess who was with Mr. Allworthy; repeating, that Mr. Allworthy was resolved to know. The Lad, however, still maintained The Lad Resolution, and was dismissed with much Wrath by Mr. Allworthy, who told Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Allworthy should have to the next Morning to consider of it, when Mr. Allworthy should be questioned by another Person and in another Manner.  little Jones spent a very melancholy Night, and the more so, as Mr. Allworthy was without Mr. Allworthy usual Companion: for Master Blifil was gone abroad on a visit with Mr. Allworthy Mother. Fear of the Punishment Mr. Allworthy was to suffer was on the following Occasion Mr. Allworthy least Evil; Mr. Allworthy chief Anxiety being, lest Mr. Allworthy Constancy should fail Mr. Allworthy, and Mr. Allworthy should be brought to betray the Game-keeper, whose Ruin Mr. Allworthy knew must now be the Consequence.  Nor did the Game-keeper pass the Game-keeper Time much better. the Game-keeper had the same Apprehensions with the Youth; for whose Honor the Game-keeper had likewise a much tenderer Regard than for the Game-keeper Skin.  In the Morning, when Tom attended the Reverend Mr. Thwackum, the Person to whom Mr. Allworthy had committed the Instruction of the two Boys, the Game-keeper had the same Questions put to the Game-keeper by that Gentleman, which the Game-keeper had been asked the Evening before, to which the Game-keeper returned the same Answers. The Consequence of this was, so severe a Whipping, that this possibly fell little short of the Torture with which Confessions are in some Countries extorted from Criminals.  Tom bore Tom Punishment with great Resolution; and though Tom Master asked Tom between every Stroke, whether Tom would not confess, Tom was contented to be flead rather than betray Tom Friend, or break the Promise Tom had made.  the Game-keeper was now relieved from the Game-keeper Anxiety, and Mr. Allworthy began to be concerned at Tom's Sufferings: For, besides that Mr. Thwackum, being highly enraged that Mr. Allworthy was not able to make the Boy say what Mr. Allworthy pleased, had carried Mr. Allworthy Severity much beyond the good Man's Intention, this latter began now to suspect that the Squire had been mistaken; which the Squire Extreme Eagerness and Anger seemed to make probable; and as for what his Servants had said in Confirmation of his Servants Master's Account, the Squire laid no great Stress upon that. Now, as Cruelty and Injustice were two Ideas, of which Mr. Allworthy could by no Means support the Consciousness a single Moment, Mr. Allworthy sent for Tom, and after many kind and Friendly Exhortations, said, 'I am convinced, my dear Child, that my Suspicions have wronged you; I am sorry that you have been so severely punished on their Master's Account.' -- And at last gave the Squire a little Horse to make the Squire amends; again repeating the Squire Sorrow for what had past.  Tom's Guilt now flew in Tom Face more than any Severity could make it. Tom could more easily bear the Lashes of Thwackum, than the Generosity of Allworthy. The Tears burst from Tom Eyes, and Tom fell upon Tom Knees, crying, 'Oh! Tom, you are too good to Tom. Indeed, you are. Indeed, I don't deserve it.' And at that very Instant, from the Fullness of Tom Heart, had almost betrayed the Secret; but the good Genius of the Game-keeper suggested to Tom what might be the Consequence to the Fellow, and this Consideration sealed Tom Lips.  Thwackum did all Thwackum could to dissuade Mr. Allworthy from showing any Compassion or Kindness to the Boy, saying, 'Thwackum had persisted in an Untruth;' and gave some Hints, that a second Whipping might probably bring the Matter to Light.  But Mr. Allworthy absolutely refused to consent to the Experiment. Mr. Allworthy said, the Boy had suffered enough already, for concealing the Truth, even if the Boy was guilty, seeing that the Boy could have no Motive but a mistaken Point of whose Honor for so doing.  whose Honor! cried Thwackum, with some Warmth, mere Stubborness and Obstinacy! Can whose Honor teach any one to tell a Lie, or can any whose Honor exist independent of Religion?  This Discourse happened at Table when Dinner was just ended; and there were present Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Thwackum, and a third Gentleman who entered into the Debate, and whom, before we proceed any farther, we shall briefly introduce to we Reader's Acquaintance.  CHAP. III. The Character of Mr. Square the Philosopher, and of Mr. Thwackum the Divine; with a Dispute concerning --  THE Name of this Gentleman who had then resided some time at Mr. Allworthy's House, was Mr. Square. Mr. Allworthy natural Parts were not of the first Rate, but Mr. Allworthy had greatly improved His natural Parts by a learn Education. Mr. Allworthy was deeply read in the Ancients, and a professed Master of all the Works of Plato and Aristotle. Upon which great Models Mr. Allworthy had principally formed Mr. Allworthy, sometimes according with the Opinion of the one, and sometimes with that of the other. In Morals Mr. Allworthy was a professed Platonist, and in Religion Mr. Allworthy inclined to be an Aristotelian.  But though Mr. Allworthy had, as we have said, formed Mr. Allworthy Morals on the Platonic Model, yet Mr. Allworthy perfectly agreed with the Opinion of Aristotle, in considering that great Man rather in the Quality of a Philosopher or a Speculatist, than as a Legislator. This Sentiment Mr. Allworthy carried a great way; indeed, so far, as to regard all Virtue as Matter of Theory only. This, it is true, Mr. Allworthy never affirmed, as I have heard, to any one; and yet upon the least attention to Mr. Allworthy Conduct, I cannot help thinking, it was Mr. Allworthy real Opinion, as it will perfectly reconcile some Contradictions which might otherwise appear in Mr. Allworthy Character.  This Gentleman and Thwackum scarce ever met without a Disputation; for This Gentleman and Mr. Thwackum Tenets were, indeed, diametrically opposite to each other. Square held human Nature to be the Perfection of all Virtue, and that Vice was a Deviation from our Nature in the same Manner as Deformity of Body is. Thwackum, on the contrary, maintained that the human Mind, since the fall, was nothing but a Sink of Iniquity, till purified and redeemed by Grace. In one Point only they agreed, which was, in all they Discourses on Morality never to mention the Word Goodness. The favorite Phrase of the former, was the natural Beauty of Virtue; that of the latter, was the divine Power of Grace. The former measured all Actions by the unalterable Rule of Right, and the eternal Fitness of Things; the latter decided all Matters by Authority; but, in doing this, he always used the Scriptures and their Commentators, as the Lawyer does the Lawyer Coke upon Lyttleton, where the Comment is of equal Authority with the Text.  After this short Introduction, the Reader will be pleased to remember, that the Parson had concluded Parson Speech with a triumphant Question, to which Parson had apprehended no Answer; viz. Can any whose Honor exist independent on Religion?  To this Square answered, that it was impossible to discourse philosophically concerning Words, till their Meaning was first established; that there were scarce any two Words of a more vague and uncertain Signification, than the two Parson had mentioned: For that there were almost as many different Opinions concerning whose Honor as concerning Religion. 'But, says Parson, if by whose Honor you mean the true natural Beauty of Virtue, I will maintain the true natural Beauty of Virtue may exist independent of any Religion whatever. Nay (added he) you yourself will allow the true natural Beauty of Virtue may exist independent of all but one; so will a Mohammedan, a Jew, and all the Maintainers of all the different Sects in the World.'  Thwackum replied, This was arguing with the usual Malice of all the Enemies to the true Church. Thwackum said, Thwackum doubted not but that all the Infidels and Heretics in the World would, if all the Infidels and Heretics in the World could, confine Honor to all the Infidels and Heretics in the World own absurd Errors, and damnable Deceptions; 'But whose Honor, says Thwackum, is not therefore manifold, because there are many absurd Opinions about it; nor is Religion manifold, because there are various Sects and Heresies in the World. When I mention Religion, I mean the Christian Religion; and not only the Christian Religion, but the Protestant Religion; and not only the Protestant Religion, but the Church of England. And, when I mention whose Honor, I mean that Mode of divine Grace which is not only consistent with, but dependent upon, this Religion; and is consistent with, and dependent upon, no other. Now to say that the whose Honor I here mean, and which was, I thought, all the whose Honor I could be supposed to mean, will uphold, much less dictate, an Untruth, is to assert an Absurdity too shocking to be conceived.'  'I purposely avoided,' says this Square, 'drawing a Conclusion which I thought evident from what I have said; but if you perceived it, I am sure you have not attempted to answer it. However, to drop the Article of Religion, I think it is plain, from what you have said, that we have different Ideas of whose Honor; or why do we not agree in the same Terms of it Explanation? I have asserted, that true whose Honor and true Virtue are almost synonimous Terms, and true Honor and true Virtue are both founded on the unalterable Rule of Right, and the eternal Fitness of Things; to which an Untruth being absolutely repugnant and contrary, it is certain that all the Honor cannot support an Untruth. In this, therefore, I think we are agreed; but that all the Honor, can be said to be founded on Religion, to which it is antecedent, if by Religion be meant any positive Law -- 'I agree,' answered Thwackum, with great 'Warmth, 'with a Man who asserts whose Honor to be antecedent to Religion! -- Mr. Allworthy, did I agree --?  Mr. Allworthy was proceeding, when Mr. Allworthy interposed, telling both very coldly, both had both mistaken Mr. Allworthy Meaning; for that Mr. Allworthy had said nothing of all the Honor. -- It is possible, however, Mr. Allworthy would not have easily quieted the Disputants, who were growing equally warm, had not another Matter now fallen out, which put a final End to the Conversation at present.  CHAP. IV. Containing a necessary Apology for the Author; and a childish Incident, which perhaps requires an Apology likewise.  BEFORE I proceed farther, I shall beg leave to obviate some Misconstructions, into which the Zeal of some few Readers may lead some few Readers; for I would not willingly give Offense to any, especially to Men who are warm in the Cause of Virtue or Religion.  I hope, therefore, no Man will, by the grossest Misunderstanding, or Perversion, of my Meaning, misrepresent me, as endeavoring to cast any Ridicule on the greatest Perfections of Human Nature; and which do, indeed, alone purify and ennoble the Heart of Man, and raise Man above the Brute Creation. This, the Reader, I will venture to say, (and by how much the better Man you are yourself, by so much the more will you be inclined to believe me) that I would rather have buried the Sentiments of these two Persons in eternal Oblivion, than have done any Injury to either of these glorious Causes.  On the contrary, it is with a View to their Service that I have taken upon me to record the Lives and Actions of two of their false and pretended Champions. A treacherous Friend is the most dangerous Enemy; and I will say boldly, that both Religion and Virtue have received more real Discredit from Hypocrites, than the wittiest Profligates or Infidels could ever cast upon them: Nay farther, as these two, in these two Purity, are rightly called the Bands of civil Society, and are indeed the greatest of Blessings; so when poisoned and corrupted with Fraud, Pretense and Affection, them have become the worst of civil Curses, and have enabled Men to perpetrate the most cruel Mischiefs to them own Species.  Indeed, I doubt not but this Ridicule will in general be allowed; my chief Apprehensions is, as many true and just Sentiments often came from the Mouths of these Persons, lest the whole should be taken together, and I should be conceived to ridicule all alike. Now the Reader will be pleased to consider, that as neither of Men were Fools, Men could not be supposed to have holden none but wrong Principles, and to have uttered nothing but Absurdities; what Injustice, therefore, must I have done to Men Characters, had I selected only what was bad, and how horridly wretched and maimed must Men Arguments have appeared!  Upon the whole, it is not Religion or Virtue, but the Want of Religion or Virtue which is here exposed. Had not Thwackum too much neglected Virtue, and Square Religion, in the Composition of their several Systems; and had not both utterly discarded all natural Goodness of Heart, both had never been represented as the Objects of Derision in this History; in which we will now proceed.  This Matter, then, which put an end to the Debate mentioned in the last Chapter, was no other than a Quarrel between Master Blifil and Tom Jones, the Consequence of which had been a Bloody Nose to the former; for though Master Blifil, notwithstanding Master Blifil was the younger, was in Size above the other's Match, yet Tom was much Master Blifil Superior at the noble Art of Boxing.  Tom, however, cautiously avoided all Engagements with that Youth: For besides that Tommy Jones was an inoffensive Lad amidst all Tommy Jones Roguery, and really loved Blifil; Thwackum being always the Second of the latter, would have been sufficient to deter Thwackum.  But well says a certain Author, No Man is wise at all Hours; it is therefore no Wonder that a Boy is not so. A Difference arising at Play between the two Lads, Blifil called Tom a Beggarly Bastard. Upon which the lattter, who was somewhat passionate in Blifil Disposition, immediately caused that Phenomenon in the Face of the former, which we have above remembered.  Master Blifil now, with his Blood running from his Nose, and the Tears galloping after from his Eyes, appeared before his Uncle, and Thwackum. In which Court an Indictment of Assault, Batterry, and wounding, was instantly preserred against Tom; who in Tom Excuse only pleaded the Provocation, which was indeed all the Matter that Blifil had omitted.  It is indeed possible, that this Circumstances might have escaped his Memory; for, in his Reply, his positively insisted, that his made Use of no such Appellation; adding, 'Heaven forbid such naughty Words should ever come out of his Mouth.'  Tom, though against all Form of Law, rejoined in Affirmance of the Words. Upon which Blifil said, 'It is no Wonder. Those who will tell one Fib, will hardly stick at another. If I had told my Master such a wicked Fib as you have done, I should be ashamed to show my Face.'  'What Fib, Child,' cries Thwackum pretty eagerly?  'Why Thwackum told you that Nobody was with Thwackum a shooting when Thwackum killed the Partridge; but Thwackum knows, (here Thwackum burst into a Flood of Tears) yes, Thwackum knows; for Thwackum confessed it to me, that Black Jack the Game-keeper was there. Nay, Thwackum said, -- Yes you did, -- deny it if you can, That you would not have confessed the Truth, though my Master had cut you to Pieces.'  At this the Fire flashed from Thwackum's Eyes; and Thwackum cried out in Triumph: 'Oh ho! This is your mistaken Notion of whose Honor! This is the Boy who was not to be whipped again!' But Mr. Allworthy, with a more gentle Aspect, turned toward the Lad, and said, 'Is this true, Child? How came you to persist so obstinately in a Falsehood?'  Tom said, 'Tom scorned a Lie as much as any one; but Tom thought Tom whose Honor engaged Tom to act as Tom did; for Tom had promised the poor Fellow to conceal Tom; which,' Tom said, 'Tom thought Tom farther obliged to, as the Game-keeper had begged Tom not to go into the Gentleman's Manor, and had at last gone Tom in Compliance with Tom Persuasions.' Tom said, this was the whole Truth of the Matter, and Tom would take Tom Oath of it; and concluded with very passionately begging Mr. Allworthy, 'to have Compassion on the poor Fellow's Family, especially as he himself had been only guilty, and the other had been very difficultly prevailed on to what Tom did.' 'Indeed Sir,' said Indeed Sir, 'it could hardly be called a Lie that I told; for the poor Fellow Fellow was entirely innocent of the whole Matter. I should have gone alone after the Birds; nay, I did go at first, and Tom only followed me to prevent more Mischief. Do, pray, Indeed Sir, let me be punished, take my little Horse away again; but pray, Indeed Sir, forgive poor George.'  Mr. Allworthy hesitated a few Moments, and then dismissed the Boys, advising the Boys to live more friendly and peaceably together.  CHAP. V. The Opinion of the Divine and the Philosopher concerning the two Boys; with some Reasons for the two Boys Opinions, and other Matters.  IT is probable, that by disclosing this Secret, which had been communicated in the utmost Confidence to him, young Blifil preserved young Blifil Companion from a good Lashing: For the Offense of the bloody Nose would have been of the bloody Nose sufficient Cause for Thwackum to have proceeded to Correction; but now this was totally absorbed, in the Consideration of the other Matter; and with Regard to this, Mr. Allworthy declared privately, Mr. Allworthy thought a Boy deserved Reward rather than Punishment; so that Thwackum's Hand was withheld by a general Pardon.  Thwackum, whose Meditations were full of Birch, exclaimed against this weak, and, as Mr. Allworthy said Mr. Allworthy would venture to call it, wicked Lenity. To remit the Punishment of such Crimes was, Mr. Allworthy said, to encourage such Crimes. Mr. Allworthy enlarged much on the Correction of Children, and quoted many Texts from Solomon, and others; which being to be found in so many other Books, shall not be found here. Mr. Allworthy then applied Mr. Allworthy to the Vice of Lying, on which Head Mr. Allworthy was altogether as learned as Mr. Allworthy had been on the other.  Square said, Mr. Allworthy had been endeavoring to reconcile the Behavior of Tom with Mr. Allworthy Idea of perfect Virtue; but could not. Mr. Allworthy owned there was something which at first Sight appeared like Fortitude in the Action, but as Fortitude was a Virtue, and Falsehood a Vice, they could by no means agree or unite together. Mr. Allworthy added, that as this was in some measure to confound Virtue and Vice, it might be worth Thwackum's Considerations, whether a larger Castigation might not be laid on, upon that Account.  As both these learned Men concurred in censuring Tommy Jones, so were both these learned Men concurred in censuring Jones no less unanimous in applauding Blifil. To bring Truth to light, was by the Parson asserted to be the Duty of every religious Man; and by the Philosopher this was declared to be highly conformable with the Rule of Right, and the eternal and unalterable Fitness of Things.  All this, however, weighed very little with Mr. Allworthy. Mr. Allworthy could not be prevailed on to sign the Warrant for the Execution of Tommy Jones. There was something within Mr. Allworthy own Breast with which the invincible Fidelity which that Youth had preserved, corresponded much better than it had done with the Religion of Thwackum, or with the Virtue of Square. Mr. Allworthy therefore strictly ordered the former of both these learned Men concurred in censuring Jones to abstain from laying violent Hands on Tom for what had past. The Pedagogue was obliged to obey those Orders; but not without great Reluctance, and frequent Mutterings, that a Boy would be certainly spoiled.  Toward the Game-keeper a Boy behaved with more Severity. a Boy presently summoned that poor Fellow before a Boy, and after many bitter Remonstrances, paid a Boy a Boy Wages, and dismissed a Boy from a Boy Service; for Mr. Allworthy rightly observed that there was great Difference between being guilty of a Falsehood to excuse yourself, and to excuse another. a Boy likewise urged, as the principal Motive to a Boy inflexible Severity against this Man, that a Boy had basely suffered Tom Jones to undergo so heavy a Punishment for a Boy Sake, whereas a Boy ought to have prevented it by making the Discovery himself.  When this Story became public, many people differed from Square and Thwackum, in judging the Conduct of the two Lads on the Occasion. Blifil was generally called a sneaking Rascal, a poor-spirited Wretch; with other Epithets of the like Kind; whilst Tom was honored with the Appellations of a brave Lad, a Jolly Dog, and an honest Fellow. Indeed a Boy Behavior to poor George much ingratiated a Boy with all the Servants; for though that Fellow was before universally disliked, yet Fellow was no sooner turned away than Fellow was as universally pitied; and the Friendship and Gallantry of Tom Jones was celebrated by them all with the highest Applause; and them all condemned Blifil, as openly as them all durst, without incurring the Danger of offending Fellow Mother. For all this, however, Tom Tom smarted in the Flesh; for though Thwackum had been inhibited to exercise Thwackum Arm on the foregoing Account; yet, as the Proverb says, It is easy to find a Stick, etc. So was it easy to find a Rod; and, indeed, the not being able to find one was the only thing which could have kept Thwackum any long Time from chastising poor Tommy Jones.  Had the bare Delight in the Sport been the only Inducement to The Pedagogue, it is probable, Blifil would likewise have had Blifil Share; but though Mr. Allworthy had given Mr. Allworthy frequent Orders to make no Difference between the Lads, yet was Thwackum altogether as kind and gentle to this Youth, as Mr. Allworthy was harsh, nay even barbarous, to the other. To say the Truth, Blifil had greatly gained Blifil Master's Affections; partly by the profound Respect Blifil always showed Blifil Person, but much more by the decent Reverence with which Blifil received Blifil Doctrine; for Blifil had got by Heart, and frequently repeated Blifil Phrases, and maintained all Blifil Master's religious Principles with a Zeal which was surprising in one so young, and which greatly endeared Blifil to the worthy Preceptor.  Tom Jones, on the other hand, was not only deficient in outward Tokens of Respect, often forgetting to pull off Tom Jones Hat, or to bow at Tom Jones Master's Approach; but was altogether as unmindful both of his Master's Precepts and Example. Tom Jones was indeed a thoughtless, giddy Youth, with little Sobriety in Tom Jones Manners, and less in Tom Jones Countenance; and would often very impudently and indecently laugh at Tom Jones for his Behavior to Black George.  Square and Thwackum had the same Reason for Square and Thwackum Preference of the former Lad; for Tom Jones showed no more Regard to the learned Discourses which this Gentleman would sometimes throw away upon this Gentleman, than to those of Thwackum. Square and Thwackum once ventured to make a Jest of the Rule of Right; and at another Time said, Square and Thwackum believed there was no Rule in the World capable of making such a Man as Square and Thwackum Father, (for so Mr. Allworthy suffered Mr. Allworthy to be called.)  Blifil, on the contrary, had Address enough at sixteen to recommend Mr. Allworthy at one and the same Time to both these Opposites. With one Mr. Allworthy was all Religion, with the other Mr. Allworthy was all Virtue. And when both were present, Mr. Allworthy was profoundly silent, which both interpreted in Mr. Allworthy Favor and both own.  Nor was Blifil contented with flattering both both these learned Men concurred in censuring Jones to both these learned Men concurred in censuring Jones Faces; Mr. Allworthy took frequent Occasions of praising both these learned Men concurred in censuring Jones behind both these learned Men concurred in censuring Jones Backs to Mr. Allworthy; before whom, when both these learned Men concurred in censuring Jones were alone together, and when Mr. Allworthy Uncle commended any religious or virtuous Sentiment (for many such came constantly from his Uncle) his Uncle seldom failed to ascribe it to the good Instructions his Uncle had received from either Thwackum or Square: For his Uncle knew his Uncle his Uncle repeated all such Compliments to the Persons for whose Use they were meant; and his Uncle found by Experience the great Impressions which they made on the Philosopher, as well as on the Divine: For, to say the Truth, there is no kind of Flattery so irresistible as this, at second Hand.  this Gentleman, moreover, soon perceived how extremely grateful all those Panegyricks on this Gentleman Instructors were to Mr. Allworthy, as they so loudly resounded the Praise of that singular Plan of Education which this Gentleman had laid down: For this worthy Man having observed the imperfect Institution of our public Schools, and the many Vices which Boys were there liable to learn, had resolved to educate Mr. Allworthy Nephew, as well as the other Lad, whom Mr. Allworthy had in a Manner adopted, in Mr. Allworthy own House; where Mr. Allworthy thought they Morals would escape all that Danger of being corrupted, to which they would be unavoidably exposed in any public School or University.  Having therefore determined to commit Boys to the Tuition of a private Tutor, Thwackum was recommended to Thwackum for that Office, by a very particular Friend, of whose Understanding Mr. Allworthy had a great Opinion, and in whose Integrity Thwackum placed much Confidence. Thwackum was Fellow of a College, where Thwackum almost entirely resided; and had a great Ruputation for Learning, Religion and Sobriety of Manners. And these were doubtless the Qualifications by which Mr. Allworthy's Friend had been induced to recommend Mr. Allworthy's Friend; though indeed Mr. Allworthy's Friend had some Obligations to Thwackum's Family, who were the most considerable Persons in a Borough which that this Gentleman represented in Parliament.  Thwackum, at Thwackum first Arrival, was extremely agreeable to Mr. Allworthy; and indeed Thwackum perfectly answered the Character which had been given of Thwackum. Upon longer Acquaintance, however, and more intimate Conversation, this worthy Man saw Infirmities in the Tutor, which this worthy Man could have wished this worthy Man to have been without; though as those seemed greatly overballanced by this worthy Man good Qualities, those seemed did not incline Mr. Allworthy to part with Mr. Allworthy; nor would those seemed indeed have justified such a Proceeding: For the Reader is greatly mistaken, if this worthy Man conceives that Thwackum appeared to Mr. Allworthy in the same Light as Mr. Allworthy does to Mr. Allworthy in this History; and Mr. Allworthy is as much deceived, if Mr. Allworthy imagines, that the most intimate Acquaintenance which Mr. Allworthy could have had with that Divine, would have informed Mr. Allworthy of those Things which we, from we Inspiration, are enabled to open and discover. Of Readers who from such Conceits as these, condemn the Wisdom or Penetration of Mr. Allworthy, I shall not scruple to say, that they make a very bad and ungrateful Use of that Knowledge which we have communicated to they.  These apparent Errors in the Doctrine of Thwackum, served greatly to palliate the contrary Errors in that of Square, which our good Man no less saw and condemned. our good Man thought indeed that the different Exuberancies of both these learned Men concurred in censuring Jones, would correct both these learned Men concurred in censuring Jones different Imperfections; and that from both, especially with our good Man Assistance, the two Lads would derive sufficient Precepts of true Religion and Virtue. If the Event happened contrary to our good Man Expectations, this possibly proceeded from some Fault in the Plan itself; which the Reader has my Leave to discover, if our good Man can. For we do not pretend to introduce any infallible Characters into this History; where we hope nothing will be found which never has yet been seen in human Nature.  To return therefore; the Reader will not, I think, wonder that the different Behavior of the two Lads above commemorated, produced the different Effects, of which our good Man has already seen some Instance; and besides this, there was another Reason for the Conduct of the Philosopher and The Pedagogue; but this being Matter of great Importance, we shall reveal this in the next Chapter.  CHAP. VI. Containing a better Reason still for the beforementioned Opinions.  IT is to be known then, that those two learned Personages, who have lately made a considerable Figure on the Theater of this History, had from their ^^rst Arrival at Mr. Allworthy's House, taken so great ^n Affection, the one to ^n Affection Virtue, the other to ^n Affection Religion, that they had meditated the closest Alliance with ^n Affection.  For this Purpose they had cast they Eyes on that ^air Widow, whom, though we have not for some Time made any mention of her, the Reader, we trust, has not forgot. Blifil was indeed the Object to which they both aspired.  It may seem remarkable that of four Persons whom we have commemorated at Mr. Allworthy's House; three of four Persons whom we have commemorated at Mr. Allworthy's House should fix four Persons whom we have commemorated at Mr. Allworthy's House Inclinations on a Lady who was never greatly celebrated for Blifil Beauty, and who was, moreover, now a little descended into the Vale of Years; but in reality, Bosom Friends, and intimate Acquaintance, have a kind of natural Propensity to particular Females at the House of a Friend; viz. to his Grandmother, Mother, Sister, Daughter, Aunt, Neice and Cousin, when they are rich, and to his Wife, Sister, Daughter, Neice, Cousin, Mistress or Servant Maid, if they should be handsome.  We would not, however, have We the Reader imagine, that Persons of such Characters as were supported by Thwackum and Square, would undertake a Matter of this Kind, which has been a little censured by some rigid Moralists, before some rigid Moralists had thoroughly examined it, and considered whether it was (as Shakespeare phrases it) 'Stuff, of the Conscience' or no. Thwackum was encouraged to the Undertaking, by reflecting, that to court your Neighbor's Sister is no where forbidden, and Thwackum knew it was a Rule in the Construction of all Laws, that "Expressum facit cessare Tacitum," the Sense of which is, 'When a Lawgiver sets down plainly Thwackum whole Meaning, we are prevented from making Thwackum mean what we please we.' As some Instances of Women, therefore, are mentioned in the divine Law, which forbids us to covet our Neighbors Goods, and that of a Sister omitted, Thwackum concluded it to be lawful. And as to Square, who was in Thwackum Person what is called a jolly Fellow, or a Widow's Man, Thwackum easily reconciled Thwackum Choice to the eternal Fitness of Things.  Now, as both these Gentlemen were industrious in taking every Opportunity of recommending both these Gentlemen to the Widow, both these Gentlemen apprehended one certain Method was, by giving her Son the constant Preference to the other Lad; and as both these Gentlemen conceived the Kindness and Affection which Mr. Allworthy showed the latter, must be highly disagreeable to her, both these Gentlemen doubted not but the laying hold on all Occasions to degrade and villify her Son, would be highly pleasing to her; who, as her hated the Boy, must love all those who did the Boy any hurt. In this Thwackum had the Advantage; for while Square could only scarify the poor Lad's Reputation, Thwackum could flea Thwackum Skin; and indeed Thwackum considered every Lash Thwackum gave Thwackum as a Compliment paid to Thwackum Mistress; so that Thwackum could with the utmost Propriety repeat this old flogging Line, "Castigo te non quod odio habeam, sed quod AMEM; I chastise thee not out of Hatred, but out of Love." And this indeed Thwackum often had in Thwackum Mouth, or rather, according to the old Phrase, never more properly applied, at Thwackum Fingers Ends.  For this Reason principally, the two Gentlemen concurred, as the two Gentlemen have seen above, in the two Gentlemen Opinion concerning the two Lads; this being indeed almost the only Instance of the two Gentlemen concurring on any Point: For besides the Difference of the two Gentlemen Principles, the two Gentlemen had the two Gentlemen long ago strongly suspected each others Design, and hated one another with no little Degree of Inveteracy.  This mutual Animosity was a good deal increased by This mutual Animosity alternate Successes: For Blifil knew what This mutual Animosity would be at long before This mutual Animosity imagined it; or indeed intended Blifil should: For This mutual Animosity proceeded with great Caution lest Blifil should be offended, and acquaint Mr. Allworthy; but This mutual Animosity had no Reason for any such Fear. Blifil was well enough pleased with a Passion of which Blifil intended none should have any Fruits but Blifil. And the only Fruits Blifil designed for Blifil were Flattery and Courtship; for which Purpose, Blifil soothed them by Turns, and a long Time equally. Blifil was indeed rather inclined to favor the Parson's Principles; but Square's Person was more agreeable to Blifil Eye; for he was a comely Man; whereas The Pedagogue did in Countenance very nearly resemble that Gentleman, who in the Harlot's Progress is seen correcting the Ladies in Bridewel.  Whether Blifil had been surfeited with the Sweets of Marriage, or disgusted by Blifil Bitters, or from what other Cause its Bitters proceeded, I will not determine; but Blifil could never be brought to listen to any second Proposals. However, Blifil at last conversed with Square, with such a Degree of Intimacy, that malicious Tongues began to whisper Things of Blifil, to which, as well for the Sake of the Lady, as that Tongues were highly disagreeable to the Rule of Right, and the Fitness of Things, we will give no Credit; and therefore shall not blot we Paper with Tongues. The Pedagogue, it is certain, whipped on without getting a Step nearer to The Pedagogue Journey's End.  Indeed The Pedagogue had committed a great Error, and that Square discovered much sooner than The Pedagogue. Mrs. Blifl (as perhaps the Readers may have formerly guessed) was not over and above pleased with the Behavior of Mrs. Blifl (as perhaps the Readers may have formerly guessed) Husband; nay to be honest, Mrs. Blifl (as perhaps the Readers may have formerly guessed) absolutely hated her Husband, till her Husband Death at last a little reconciled her Husband to Mrs. Blifl (as perhaps the Readers may have formerly guessed) Affections. It will not be therefore greatly wondered at, if Mrs. Blifl (as perhaps the Readers may have formerly guessed) had not the most violent Regard to the Offspring Mrs. Blifl (as perhaps the Readers may have formerly guessed) had by her Husband. And, in fact, her Husband had so little of Regard, that in her Husband Infancy Mrs. Blifl (as perhaps the Readers may have formerly guessed) seldom saw Mrs. Blifl (as perhaps the Readers may have formerly guessed) Son, or took any Notice of her Son; and hence Mrs. Blifl (as perhaps the Readers may have formerly guessed) acquiesced, after a little Reluctance, in all the Favors which Mr. Allworthy showered on the Foundling; whom the good Man called the good Man own Boy, and in all Things put on an entire Equality with Blifil. This Acquiescence in Blifil was considered by the Neighbors, and by the Family, as a Mark of her Condescension to her Brother's Humor, and her was imagined by all others, as well as Thwackum and Square, to hate the Foundling in her Heart; nay, the more Civility her showed him, the more the conceived her detested him, and the surer Schemes her was laying for him Ruin: For as the thought it her Interest to hate him, it her Interest was very difficul for her to persuade them her did not.  Thwackum was the more confirmed in Thwackum Opinion, as her had more than once caused Thwackum to whip Tom Jones, when Mr. Allworthy, who was an Enemy to this Exercise, was abroad; whereas her had never given any such Orders concerning young Blifil. And this had likewise imposed upon Square. In reality, though her certainly hated her own Son; of which, however monstrous it appears, I am assured her is not a singular Instance, her appeared, notwithstanding all her outward Compliance, to be in her Heart sufficiently displeased with all the Favor shown by Mr. Allworthy to the Foundling. her frequently complained of this behind her Brother's Back, and very sharply censured her Brother for her Brother's Back, both to Thwackum and Square; nay, her would throw her Brother's Back in the Teeth of Allworthy himself, when a little Quarrel or Miff, as her Brother's Back is vulgarly called, arose between both.  However, when Tom grew up, and gave Tokens of that Gallantry of Temper which greatly recommends Men to Women, this Disinclination which her had discovered to Tom when a Child, by Degrees abated, and at last her so evidently demonstrated her Affection to Tom to be much stronger than what her bore her own Son, that it was impossible to mistake her any longer. her was so desirous of often seeing Tom, and discovered such Satisfaction and Delight in Tom Company, that before Tom was eighteen Years old, Tom was become a Rival to both Square and Thwackum; and what is worse, the whole Country began to talk as loudly of her Inclination to Tom, as they had before done of that which her had shown to Square; on which Account the Philosopher conceived the most ^mplacable Hatred for our poor Hero.  CHAP. VII. In which the Author himself makes the Author himself Appearance on the Stage.  THOUGH Mr. Allworthy was not of Mr. Allworthy hasty to see Things in a Disadvantageous Light, and was a Stranger to the public Voice, which seldom reaches to a Brother or a Husband, though it rings in the Ears of all the Neighborhood; yet was this Affection of Blifil to Tom, and the Preference which Blifil too visibly gave Mr. Allworthy to Blifil own Son, of the utmost Disadvantage to that Youth.  For such was the Compassion which inhabited Mr. Allworthy's Mind, that nothing but the Steel of Justice could ever subdue the Steel of Justice. To be unfortunate in any Respect was sufficient, if there was no Demerit to counterpoise it, to turn the Scale of that good Man's Pity, and to engage that good Man Friendship, and that good Man Benefaction.  When therefore that good Man plainly saw Blifil was absolutely detested (for that that good Man was) by that good Man own Mother, that good Man began, on that Account only, to look with an Eye of Compassion upon that good Man; and what the Effects of Compassion are in good and benevolent Minds, I need not here explain to most of my Readers.  Henceforward, Henceforward saw every Appearance of Virtue in the Youth through the magnifying End, and viewed all Henceforward Faults with the Glass inverted, so that they became scarce perceptible. And this perhaps the amiable Temper of Pity may make commendable; but the next Step the Weakness of human Nature alone must excuse: For Henceforward no sooner perceived that Preference which Blifil gave to Tom, than that poor Youth, (however innocent) began to sink in Henceforward her Affections as Henceforward rose in hers. This, it is true, would of it alone never have been able to eradicate Jones from Jones Bosom; but it was greatly injurious to Jones, and prepared Mr. Allworthy's Mind, for those Impressions, which afterward produced the mighty Event, that will be contained hereafter in this History; and to which, it must be confessed, the unfortunate Lad, by Jones own Wantonness, Wildness, and want of Caution, too much contributed.  In recording some Instances of these, we shall, if rightly understood, afford a very useful Lesson to those well-disposed Youths, who shall hereafter be our Readers: For they may here find that Goodness of Heart, and Openness of Temper, though these may give they great Comfort within, and administer to an honest Pride in they own Minds, will by no Means, alas! do they Business in the World. Prudence and Circumspection are necessary even to the best of Men. Prudence and Circumspection are indeed as it were a Guard to Virtue, without which Virtue can never be safe. It is not enough tha^ your Designs, nay that your Actions are intrinsically good, you must take Care Care shall appear so. If you^ Inside be never so beautiful, you must preserve a fai^ Outside also. This must be constantly looked to, o^ Malice and Envy will take Care to blacken it so, tha^ the Sagacity and Goodness of an Allworthy will not be able to see through it, and to discern the Beauties within. Let this, my younger Readers, be you^ constant Maxim, That no Man can be good enough to enable no Man to neglect the Rules of Prudence; not will Virtue herself look beautiful, unless Virtue herself be be+ decked with the outward Ornaments of Decency and Decorum. And this Precept, my worthy Disciples, if you read with due Attention, you will, I hope, find sufficiently enforced by Examples in the following Pages.  I ask Pardon for this short Appearance, by way of Chorus on the Stage. It is in Reality for my own Sake, that while I am discovering the Rocks on which Innocence and Goodness often split, I may not be misunderstood to recommend the very Means to my worthy Readers, by which I intend to show them them will be undone. And this as I could not prevail on any of my Actors to speak, I was obliged to declare my self.  CHAP. VIII. A childish Incident, in which, however, is seen a good natured Disposition in Tom Jones.  THE Reader may remember, that Mr. Allworthy gave Tom Jones a little Horse, as a kind of smart Money for the Punishment, which Mr. Allworthy imagined Mr. Allworthy had suffered innocently.  This Horse Tom kept above half a Year, and then rode This Horse Tom to a neighboring Fair, and sold This Horse Tom.  At This Horse Tom Return, being questioned by Thwackum, what This Horse Tom had done with the Money for which This Horse Tom was sold, This Horse Tom frankly declared This Horse Tom would not tell This Horse Tom.  Oho! says Thwackum, you will not! then I will have it out of your Br -- h; that being the Place to which This Horse Tom always applied for Information, on every doubtful Occasion.  Tom was now mounted on the Back of a Footman, and every Thing prepared for Execution, when Mr. Allworthy entering the Room, gave the Criminal a Reprieve, and took Mr. Allworthy with Mr. Allworthy into another Apartment; where Mr. Allworthy being only present with Tom, Mr. Allworthy put the same Question to Mr. Allworthy which Thwackum had before asked Mr. Allworthy.  Tom answered, Tom could in Duty refuse Tom nothing; but as for that tyrannical Rascal, Tom would never make Tom any other Answer than with a Cudgel, with which Tom hoped soon to be able to pay Tom for all Tom Barbarities.  Mr. Allworthy very severely reprimanded the Lad, for Mr. Allworthy indecent and disrespectful Expressions concerning Mr. Allworthy Master; but much more for Mr. Allworthy avowing an Intention of Revenge. Mr. Allworthy threatened Mr. Allworthy with the entire Loss of Mr. Allworthy Favor, if Mr. Allworthy ever heard such another Word from Mr. Allworthy Mouth; for Mr. Allworthy said, Mr. Allworthy would never support or befriend a Reprobate. By these and the like Declarations, Mr. Allworthy extorted some Compunction from Tom, in which that Youth was not over sincere: For Mr. Allworthy really meditated some Return for all the smarting Favors Mr. Allworthy had received at the Hands of the Pedagogue. Mr. Allworthy was, however, brought by Mr. Allworthy to express a Concern for Mr. Allworthy Resentment against Thwackum; and then the good Man, after some wholesome Admonition, permitted Mr. Allworthy to proceed, which Mr. Allworthy did, as follows.  'Indeed, my dear Sir, I love and honor you more than all the World; I know the great Obligations I have to you, and should detest Mr. Allworthy, if I thought my Heart was capable of Ingratitude. Could the little Horse you gave me speak, I am sure the little Horse could tell you how fond I was of your Present: For I had more Pleasure in feeding the little Horse, than in riding the little Horse. Indeed, my dear Sir, it went to my Heart to part with my dear Sir; nor would I have sold my dear Sir upon any other Account in the World than what I did. You yourself, my dear Sir, I am convinced in my Case, would have done the same: For none ever so sensibly felt the Misfortunes of others. What would you feel, my dear Sir, if you thought my dear Sir the Occasion of none? -- Indeed, my dear Sir, there was never any Misery like none. -- Like whose, Child," says Mr. Allworthy, what do you mean? Oh, my dear Sir,' answered Tom, your poor Game-keeper, with all Tom large Family, ever since your discarding Tom, have been perishing with all the Miseries of Cold and Hunger. I could not bear to see these poor Wretches naked and starving, and at the same Time know my dear Sir to have been the Occasion of all their Sufferings. -- I could not bear it, my dear Sir, upon my Soul, I could not." (here the Tears run down my dear Sir Cheeks, and my dear Sir thus proceeded) 'It was to save them from absolute Destruction, I parted with your dear Present, notwithstanding all the Value I had for your dear Present. -- I sold This Horse Tom for them, and them have every Farthing of the Money.'  Mr. Allworthy now stood silent for some Moments, and before Mr. Allworthy spoke, the Tears started from Mr. Allworthy Eyes. Mr. Allworthy at length dismissed Tom with a gentle Rebuke, advising Tom for the future to apply to Tom in Cases of Distress, rather than to use extraordinary Means of relieving them Tom.  This Affair was afterward the Subject of much Debate between Thwackum and Square. Thwackum held, that this was flying in Mr. Allworthy's Face, who had intended to punish the Fellow for the Fellow Disobedience. Thwackum said, in some Instances, what the World called Charity appeared to Thwackum to be opposing the Will of the Almighty, which had marked some particular Persons for Destruction; and that this was in like manner acting in Opposition to Mr. Allworthy; concluding, as usual, with a hearty Recommendation of Birch.  Square argued strongly, on the other Side, in Opposition perhaps to Thwackum, or in Compliance with Mr. Allworthy, who seemed very much to approve what Jones had done. As to what Jones urged on this Occasion, as I am convinced most of my Readers will be much abler Advocates for poor Jones, it would be impertinent to relate it. Indeed it was not difficult to reconcile to the Rule of Right, an Action which it would have been impossible to deduce from the Rule of Wrong.  CHAP. IX. Containing an Incident of a more heinous Kind, with the Comments of Thwackum and Square.  IT has been observed by some Man of much greater Reputation for Wisdom than myself, that Misfortunes seldom come single. An Instance of this may, I believe, be seen in those Gentlemen who have the Misfortune to have any of their Rogueries detected: For here Discovery seldom stops till the whole is come out. Thus it happened to Tom; who was no sooner pardoned for selling This Horse Tom, than he was discovered to have some time before sold a fine Bible which Mr. Allworthy gave he, the Money arising from which Sale he had disposed in the same Manner. This Bible Master Blifil had purchased, though he had already such another of he own, partly out of respect for the Book, and partly out of Friendship to Tom, being unwilling that Bible should be sold out of the Family at half Price. This Bible Master Blifil therefore deposited the said half Price himself; for This Bible Master Blifil was a very prudent Lad, and so careful of This Bible Master Blifil Money, that This Bible Master Blifil had laid up almost every Penny which This Bible Master Blifil had received from Mr. Allworthy.  Some People have been noted to be able to read in no Book but Some People own. On the contrary, from the Time when Master Blifil was first possessed of Bible, Master Blifil never used any other. Nay, Master Blifil was seen reading in it much oftener than Master Blifil had before been in Master Blifil own. Now, as Master Blifil frequently asked Thwackum to explain difficult Passages to Master Blifil, that Gentleman unfortunately took Notice of Tom's Name, which was written in many Parts of the Book. This brought on an Enquiry, which obliged Master Blifil to discover the whole Matter.  Thwackum was resolved, a Crime of this Kind, which Thwackum called Sacrilege, should not go unpunished. Thwackum therefore proceeded immediately to Castigation; and not contented with that, Thwackum acquainted Mr. Allworthy, at their next Meeting, with this monstrous Crime, as it appeared to Thwackum; inveighing against Tom in the most bitter Terms, and likening Thwackum to the Buyers and Sellers who were driven out of the Temple.  Square saw this Matter in a very different Light. Thwackum said, Thwackum could not perceive any higher Crime in selling one Book, than in selling another. That to sell Bibles was strictly lawful by all Laws both divine and human, and consequently there was no Unfitness in it. Thwackum told Thwackum that Thwackum great Concern on this Occasion brought to Thwackum Mind the Story of a very devout Woman, who out of pure Regard to Religion, stole Tillotson's Sermons from a Lady of her Acquaintance.  This Story caused a vast Quantity of Blood to rush into the Parson's Face, which of itself was none of the palest; and he was going to reply with great Warmth and Anger, had not Mrs. Blifil, who was present at this Debate, interposed. That Lady declared That Lady absolutely of Mr. Square's Side. That Lady argued, indeed, very learnedly in Support of Mr. Square's Side Opinion; and concluded with saying, If Tom had been guilty of any Fault, That Lady must confess That Lady own Son appeared to be equally culpable; for that That Lady could see no Difference between the Buyer and the Seller; both of whom were alike to be driven out of the Temple.  Master Blifil having declared Master Blifil Opinion, put an End to the Debate. Square's Triumph would almost have stopped his Words, had his needed them; and Thwackum, besides that, for Reasons beforementioned, his durst not venture at disobliging the Lady, was almost choked with Indignation. As to Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Allworthy said, Since the Boy had been already punished, the Boy would not deliver the Boy Sentiments on this Occasion; and whether the Boy was, or was not angry with the Lad, I must leave to the Reader's own Conjecture.  Soon after this, an Action was brought against the Game-keeper by 'Squire Western (the Gentleman in whose Manor the Partridge was killed) for Depredations of the like Kind. This was a most unfortunate Circumstance for the Fellow, as it not only of it threatened the Fellow Ruin, but actually prevented Mr. Allworthy from restoring Mr. Allworthy to Mr. Allworthy Favor: For as that Gentleman was walking out one Evening with Master Blifil and young Jones, the latter slily drew Gentleman to the Habitation of Black George; where the Family of that poor Wretch, namely, Gentleman Wife and Children, were found in all the Misery with which Cold, Hunger, and Nakedness, can affect human Creatures: For as to the Money they had received from Jones, former Debts had consumed almost the whole.  Such a Scene as this could not fail of affecting the Heart of Mr. Allworthy. Mr. Allworthy immediately gave the Mother a couple of Guineas, with which Mr. Allworthy bid the Mother cloth the Mother Children. the Mother burst into the Tears at this Goodness, and while the Mother was thanking Mr. Allworthy, could not refrain from expressing the Mother Gratitude to Tom; who had, the Mother said, long preserved both the Mother and hers from starving. We have not, says the Mother, had a Morsel to eat, nor have these poor Children had a Rag to put on, but what his Goodness has bestowed on We: For indeed, besides the Horse and Bible, Tom had sacrificed a Nightgown and other Things to the Use of this distressed Family.  On these poor Children Return home, Tom made use of all Tom Eloquence to display the Wretchedness of these People, and the Penitence of Black George himself, and in this Tom succeeded so well, that Mr. Allworthy said Mr. Allworthy thought the Man had suffered enough for what was past; that the Man would forgive the Man, and think of some Means of providing for the Man and the Man Family.  Jones was so delighted with this News, that though it was dark when they returned home, Jones could not help going back a Mile in a Shower of Rain to acquaint the poor Woman with the glad Tidings; but, like other hasty Divulgers of News, Jones only brought on Jones the Trouble of contradicting it: For the Ill-fortune of Black George made use of the very Opportunity of the Ill-fortune of Black George Friend's Absence to overturn all again.  CHAP. X. In which Master Blifil and Jones appear in different Lights.  Master Blifil fell very short of Master Blifil Companion in the amiable Quality of Mercy; but Master Blifil as greatly exceeded Master Blifil in one of a much higher Kind, namely, in Justice: In which Master Blifil followed both the Precepts and example of Thwackum and Square; for though they would both make frequent Use of the Word Mercy, yet it was plain, that in reality Square held it to be inconsistent with the Rule of Right; and Thwackum was for doing Justice, and leaving Mercy to Heaven. The two Gentlemen did indeed somewhat differ in his Opinion concerning the Objects of this sublime Virtue; by which Thwackum would probably have destroyed one half of Mankind, and Square the other half.  Master Blifil then, though he had kept Silence in the Presence of Jones, yet when he had better considered the Matter, he could by no Means endure the Thought of suffering he Uncle to confer Favors on the Undeserving. he therefore resolved immediately to acquaint he with the Fact which we have above slightly hinted to the Readers. The Truth of which was as follows:  The Game-keeper, about a Year after he was dismissed from Mr. Allworthy's Service, and before Tom's selling the Horse, being in Want of Bread, either to fill Tom own Mouth, or those of his Family, as Tom passed through a Field belonging to Mr. Western, espied a Hare sitting in a Hare Form. a Hare basely and barbarously knocked on the Head, against the Laws of the Land, and no less against the Laws of Sportsmen.  The Higler to whom a Hare was sold, being unfortunately taken many Months after with a Quantity of Game upon The Higler to whom the Hare was sold, was obliged to make The Higler to whom the Hare was sold Peace with the 'Squire by becoming Evidence against some Poacher. And now Black George was pitched upon by Black George as being a Person already obnoxious to Mr. Western, and one of no good Fame in the Country. Black George was, besides, the best Sacrifice the Higler could make, as Black George had supplied Black George with no Game since; and by this Means the Witness had an Opportunity of screening Black George better Customers: For the 'Squire, being charmed with the Power of Punishing Black George, whom a single Transgression was sufficient to ruin, made no further Enquiry.  Had this Fact been truly laid before Mr. Allworthy, this Fact might probably have done the Game-keeper very little Mischief. But there is no Zeal blinder than that which is inspired with the Love of Justice against Offenders. Master Blifil had forgot the Distance of the Time. Master Blifil varied likewise in the Manner of the Fact; and, by the hasty Addition of the single Letter S, Master Blifil considerably altered This Story; for Master Blifil said that Black George had wired Hares. These Alterations might probably have been set right, had not Master Blifil unluckily insisted on a Promise of Secrecy from Mr. Allworthy, before Master Blifil revealed the Matter to Master Blifil; but by that Means, the poor Game-keeper was condemned, without having any Opportunity to defend the poor Game-keeper: For as the Fact of killing the Hare, and of the Action brought, were certainly true, Mr. Allworthy had no Doubt concerning the rest.  Short-lived then was the Joy of these poor People; for Mr. Allworthy the next Morning declared Mr. Allworthy had fresh Reason, without assigning it, for Mr. Allworthy Anger, and strictly forbad Tom to mention Black George any more; though as for his Family, Black George said, Black George would endeavor to keep them from starving; but as to the Fellow, Black George would leave Mr. Allworthy to the Laws, which nothing could keep Mr. Allworthy from breaking.  Tom could by no Means divine what had incensed Mr. Allworthy: For of Master Blifil Master Blifil had not the least Suspicion. However, as Master Blifil Friendship was to be tired out by no Disappointments, Master Blifil now determined to try another Method of preserving the poor Game-keeper from Ruin.  Jones was lately grown very intimate with Mr. Western. Jones had so greatly recommended Jones to that Gentleman, by leaping over five-barred Gates, and by other Acts of Sportmanship, that the 'Squire the 'Squire had declared Tom would certainly make a great Man, if Jones had but sufficient Encouragement. Jones often wished Jones had Jones a Son with such Parts; and one Day very solemnly asserted at a drinking Bout, that Tom should hunt a Pack of Hounds for a thousand Pound of Jones Money with any Huntsman in the whole County.  By such kind of Talents Jones had so ingratiated Jones with the 'Squire, that Jones was a most welcome Guest at Jones Table, and a favorite Companion in Jones Sport: Every Thing which the 'Squire the 'Squire held most dear, to wit, Jones Guns, Dogs, and Horses, were now as much at the Command of Jones, as if they had been Jones own. Jones resolved therefore to make use of this Favor on Behalf of Jones Friend Black George, whom Jones hoped to introduce into Mr. Western's Family in the same Capacity in which Jones had before served Mr. Allworthy.  The Reader, if Jones considers that Jones the Fellow was already obnoxious to Mr. Western, and if Jones considers farther the weighty Business by which that that Gentleman's Displeasure had been incurred, will perhaps condemn this as a foolish and desperate Undertaking; but if Jones should not totally condemn Jones Jones on that Account, Jones will greatly applaud Jones for strengthening Jones with all imaginable Interest on so arduous an Occasion.  For this Purpose then Tom applied to Mr. Western's Daughter, a young Lady of about seventeen Years of Age, whom her Father, next after those necessary Implements of Sport just before mentioned, loved and esteemed above all the World. Now as her had some Influence on the 'Squire, so Tom had some Influence on her. But this being the intended Heroine of this Work, a Lady with whom we are we greatly in Love, and with whom many of we Readers will probably be in Love too before we part, it is by no Means proper her should make her Appearance at the End of a Book.  THE HISTORY OF A FOUNDLING. BOOK IV. Containing the Time of a Year.  CHAP. I. Containing four Pages of Paper.  AS Truth distinguishes our Writings from those idle Romances which are filled with Monsters, the Productions, not of nature, but of distempered Brains; and which have been therefore recommended by an eminent Critic to the sole Use of the Pastry-Cook: So, on the other hand, we would avoid any Resemblance to that Kind of History which a celebrated Poet seems to think is no less calculated for the Emolument of the Brewer, as the reading of it should be always attended with a Tankard of good Ale.  While -- History with her Comrade Ale, Sooths the sad Series of her serious Tale. For as this is the Liquor of modern Historians, nay, perhaps their Muse, if we may believe the Opinion of Butler, who attributes inspiration to Ale, it ought likewise to be the Potation of we may believe the Opinion of Butler, who attributes inspiration to Ale Readers; since every a Book ought to be read with the same Spirit, and in the same manner, as it is writ. Thus the famous Author of Hurlothrumbo told a learned Bishop, that the Reason Bishop Lordship could not taste the Excellence of Bishop Piece, was that Bishop did not read it with a Fiddle in Bishop Hand; which Instrument Bishop himself always had in Bishop own, when Bishop composed it.  That our Work, therefore, might be in no Danger of being likened to the Labors of these Historians, our have taken every Occasion of interspersing through the whole sundry Similies, Descriptions, and other kind of poetical Embellishments. These are indeed, designed to supply the Place of the said Ale, and to refresh the Mind, whenever those Slumbers which in a long Work are apt to invade The Reader as well the Writer, shall begin to creep upon the Writer. Without Interruptions of this Kind, the best Narrative of plain Matter of Fact must overpower every The Reader; for nothing but the everlasting Watchfulness, which Homer has ascribed to Jove himself, can be Proof against a News Paper of many Volumes.  We shall leave to The Reader to determine with what Judgment We have chosen the several Occasions for inserting these ornamental Parts of We Work. Surely it will be allowed that none could be more proper than the present; where We are about to introduce a considerable Character on the Scene; no less, indeed, than the Heroine of this Heroic, Historical, Prosaic Poem. Here, therefore, We have thought proper to prepare the Mind of The Reader for Prosaic Poem Reception, by filling it with every pleasing Image, which we can draw from the Face of Nature. And for this Method we plead many Precedents. First, this is an Art well known to, and much practiced by, our Tragic Poets; who seldom fail to prepare their Audience for the Reception of their principal Characters.  Thus the Hero is always introduced with a flourish of Drums and Trumpets, in order to rouse a martial Spirit in the Audience, and to accommodate their Ears to Bombast and Fustian, which Mr. Lock's blind Man would not have grossly erred in likening to the Sound of a Trumpet. Again, when Lovers are coming forth, soft Music often conducts Lovers on the Stage, either to sooth the Audience with all the Softness of the tender Passion, or to lull or prepare Lovers for that gentle Slumber in which Lovers will most probably be composed by the ensuing Scene.  And not only the Poets, but the Masters of these Poets, the Managers of Play Houses, seem to be in this Secret; for, besides the aforesaid Kettle Drums, etc. which denote the Hero's Approach, the Hero is generaly ushered on the Stage by a large Troop of half a dozen Scene-shifters; and how necessary these are imagined to the Hero Appearance, may be concluded from the following Theatrical Story.  King Pyrrhus was at Dinner at an Alehouse bordering on the Theater, when King Pyrrhus was summoned to go on the Stage. The Hero, being unwilling to quit King Pyrrhus Shoulder of Mutton, and as unwilling to draw on King Pyrrhus the Indignation of Mr. Wilks, (King Pyrrhus Brother Manager) for making the Audience wait, had bribed these King Pyrrhus Harbingers to be out of the Way. While Mr. Wilks, therefore, was thundering out, 'Where are the Carpenters to walk on before King Pyrrhus,' that Monarch very quietly eat King Pyrrhus Mutton, and the Audience, however impatient, were obliged to entertain the Carpenters with Music in King Pyrrhus Absence.  To be plain, I much question whether the Politician, who has generally a good Nose, has not scented out somewhat of the Utility of this Practice. I am convinced that awful Magistrate my Lord Mayor contracts a good deal of that Reverence which attends awful Magistrate my Lord Mayor through the Year, by the several Pageants who precede awful Magistrate my Lord Mayor Pomp. Nay, I must confess, that even I myself, who am not remarkably liable to be captivated with Show, have yielded not a little to the Impressions of much preceding State. When I have seen a Man strutting in a Procession, after others whose Business has been only to walk before a Man, I have conceived a higher Notion of a Man Dignity, than I have felt on seeing a Man in a common Situation. But there is one Instance which comes exactly up to my Purpose. This is the Custom of sending on a Basket-woman, who is to precede the Pomp at a Coronation, and to strew the Stage with Flowers, before the great Personages begin the great Personages Procession. The Ancients would certainly have invoked the Goddess Flora for this Purpose, and The Ancients would have been no Difficulty for their Priests or Politicians to have persuaded the People of the real Presence of the Deity, though a plain Mortal had personated her, and performed her Office. But we have no such Design of imposing on we , and therefore those who object to the Heathen Theology, may, if those who object to the Heathen Theology please, change we Goddess into the abovementioned Basket-woman. we Intention, in short, is to introduce we Heroine with the utmost Solemnity in we Power, with an Elevation of Style, and all other Circumstances proper to raise the Veneration of we Reader. Indeed we would, for certain Causes, advise those of we Male Readers who have any Hearts, to read no farther, were we not well assured, that how amiable soever the Picture of our Heroine will appear, as it is really a Copy from Nature, many of our fair Country-women will be found worthy to satisfy any Passion, and to answer any Idea of Female Perfection, which we Pencil will be able to raise.  And now, without any further Preface, we proceed to we next Chapter.  CHAP. II. A short Hint of what we can do in the Sublime, and a Description of Miss Sophia Western.  HUshed be every ruder Breath. May the Heathen Ruler of the Winds confine in Iron Chains the boisterous Limbs of noisy Boreas, and the sharp-pointed Nose of bitter-biting Eurus. Do thou, sweet Zephyrus, rising from thy fragrant Bed, mount the Western Sky, and lead on those delicious Gales, the Charms of which call forth the lovely Flora from the lovely Flora Chamber, perfumed with pearly Dews, when on the first of June, the lovely Flora Birthday, the blooming Maid in loose Attire, gently trips it over the verdant Mead, where every Flower rises to do the lovely Flora Homage, till the whole Field becomes enamelled, and Colors contend with Sweets which shall ravish the lovely Flora most.  So charming may show now appear; and you the feathered Choristers of Nature, whose sweetest Notes not even Handel can excel, tune your melodious Throats, to celebrate the lovely Flora Appearance. From Love proceeds your Music, and to Love it returns. Awaken therefore that gentle Passion in every Swain: for lo! adorned with all the Charms in which Nature can array Swain; bedecked with Beauty, Youth, Sprightliness, Innocence, Modesty, and Tenderness, breathing Sweetness from Swain rosy Lips, and darting Brightness from Swain sparkling Eyes, the lovely Sophia comes.  The Reader, perhaps thou have seen the Statue of the Venus de Medicis. Perhaps too, thou have seen the Gallery of Beauties at Hampton Court. Thou may remember each bright Churchill of the Gallaxy, and all the Toasts of the Kit-Cat. Or if each bright Churchill of the Gallaxy, and all the Toasts of the Kit-Cat Reign was before thy Times, at least thou have seen each bright Churchill of the Gallaxy, and all the Toasts of the Kit-Cat Daughters, the no less dazzling Beauties of the present Age; whose Names, should we here insert, we apprehended each bright Churchill of the Gallaxy, and all the Toasts of the Kit-Cat would fill the whole Volume.  Now if thou have seen all these, be not afraid of the rude Answer which Lord Rochester once gave to a Man, who had seen many Things. No. If thou have seen all these without knowing what Beauty is, thou have no Eyes; if without feeling no Eyes Power, thou have no Heart.  Yet is it possible, my Friend, that thou may have seen all these without being able to form an exact Idea of the lovely Sophia: for the lovely Sophia did not exactly resemble any of all these. the lovely Sophia was most like the Picture of Lady Renelagh; and I have heard more still to the famous Duchess of Mazarine: but most of all, the lovely Sophia resembled one whose Image never can depart from my Breast, and whom, if thou do remember, thou have then, my Friend, an adequate Idea of the lovely Sophia.  But lest this should not have been thy Fortune, we will endeavor with we utmost Skill to describe this Paragon, though we are sensible that we highest Abilities are very inadequate to the Task.  the lovely Sophia, the only Daughter of Mr. Western, was a middle-sized Woman; but rather inclining to tall. the lovely Sophia Shape was not only exact, but extremely delicate; and the nice Proportion of the lovely Sophia Arms promised the truest Symmetry in the lovely Sophia Limbs. the lovely Sophia Hair, which was black, was so luxuriant, that it reached the lovely Sophia Middle, before the lovely Sophia cut it, to comply with the modern Fashion; and it was now curled so gracefully in the lovely Sophia Neck, that few would believe it to be the lovely Sophia own. If Envy could find any Part of Envy Face which demanded less Commendation than the rest, it might possibly think Envy Forehead might have been higher without Prejudice to Envy. Envy Eyebrows were full, even, and arched beyond the Power of Art to imitate. Envy black Eyes had a Luster in them, which all Envy Softness could not extinguish. Envy Nose was exactly regular, and Envy Mouth, in which were two Rows of Ivory, exactly answered Sir John Suckling's Description in those Lines.  Envy were red, and one was thin, Compared to that was next Envy Chin. Some Be had stung Be newly. Envy Cheeks, were of the oval Kind; and in Her Cheeks right Her Cheeks had a Dimple which the least Smile discovered. Her Cheeks her Chin had certainly her Chin Share in forming the Beauty of Her Cheeks ; but it was difficult to say it was either large or small, though perhaps it was rather of the former kind. Her Cheeks Complexion had rather more of the Lilly than of the Rose; but when Exercise, or Modesty, increased Her Cheeks natural Color, no Vermilion could equal no Vermilion. Then one might indeed cry out with the celebrated Dr. Done.  -- Her Cheeks pure and eloquent Blood Spoke in Her Cheeks, and so distinctly wrought, That one might almost say Her Cheeks Body thought. Her Cheeks was long and finely turned; and here, if I was not afraid of offending Her Cheeks Delicacy, I might justly say, the highest Beauties of the Venus de Medicis were outdone. Here was Whiteness which no Lillies, Ivory, nor Alabaster could match. The finest Cambric might indeed be supposed from Envy to cover that Bosom, which was much whiter than The finest Cambric, -- It was indeed,  Nitor splendens Pario marmore purius. "A Gloss shining beyond the purest Brightness of Parian Marble."  Such was the Outside of the lovely Sophia; nor was this beautiful Frame disgraced by an Inhabitant unworthy of it. the lovely Sophia Mind was every way equal to the lovely Sophia Person; nay, the latter borrowed some Charms from the former: For when the lovely Sophia smiled, the Sweetness of the lovely Sophia Temper diffused that Glory over the lovely Sophia Countenance, which no Regularity of Features can give. But as there are no Perfections of the Mind which do not discover themselves, in that perfect Intimacy, to which we intend to introduce we Reader, with this charming young Creature; so it is needless to mention themselves here: Nay, it is a Kind of tacit Affront to our Reader's Understanding, and may also rob him of that Pleasure which him will receive in forming him own Judgment of her Character.  It may however, be proper to say, that whatever mental Accomplishments her had derived from Nature, they were somewhat improved and cultivated by Art: for her had been educated under the Care of an Aunt, who was a Lady of great Discretion, and was thoroughly acquainted with the World, having lived in her Youth about the Court, whence her had retired some Years since into the Country. By her Conversation and Instructions, the lovely Sophia was perfectly wellbred, though perhaps the lovely Sophia wanted a little of that Ease in the lovely Sophia Behavior, which is to be acquired only by Habit, and living within what is called the polite Circle. But this, to say the Truth, is often too dearly purchased; and though it has Charms so inexpressible, that the French, perhaps, among other Qualities, mean to express this, when they declare they know not what it is, yet it Absence is well compensated by Innocence; nor can good Sense, and a natural Gentility ever stand in need of a natural Gentility.  CHAP. III. Wherein the History goes back to commemorate a trifling Incident that happened some Years since; but which, trifling as it was, had some future Consequences.  the lovely Sophia the lovely Sophia was now in the lovely Sophia eighteenth Year, when the lovely Sophia is introduced into the History. the lovely Sophia Father, as has been said, was fonder of the lovely Sophia than of any other human Creature. To the lovely Sophia, therefore, Tom Jones applied, in order to engage the lovely Sophia Interest on the Behalf of Tom Jones Friend the Game-keeper.  But before we proceed to this Business, a short Re^apitulation of some previous Matters may be necessary.  Though the different Tempers of Mr. Allworthy, and of Mr. Western did not admit of a very intimate Correspondence, yet the different Tempers of Mr. Allworthy, and of Mr. Western lived upon what is called a ^ecent Footing together; by which Means the young People of both Families had been acquainted from the young People of both Families Infancy; and as the different Tempers of Mr. Allworthy, and of Mr. Western were all near of the same Age, had been frequent Play-mates together.  The Gaiety of Tom's Temper suited better with the lovely Sophia, than the grave and sober Disposition of Master Blifil. And the Preference which the lovely Sophia gave the former of these, would often appear so plainly, that a Lad of a more passionate Turn than Master Blifil was, might have shown some Displeasure at Master Blifil.  As he did not, however, outwardly express any such Disgust, it would be an ill Office in us to pay a Visit to the inmost Recesses of he Mind, as some scandalous People search into the most secret Affairs of some scandalous People Friends, and often pry into some scandalous People Closets and Cupboards, only to discover some scandalous People Poverty and Meanness to the World.  However, as Persons who suspect they have given others Cause of Offense, are apt to conclude they are offended; so the lovely Sophia imputed an Action of Master Blifil, to Master Blifil Anger, which the superior Sagacity of Thwackum and Square discerned to have arisen from a much better Principle.  Tom Jones, when very young, had presented the lovely Sophia with a little Bird, which Tom Jones had taken from the Nest, had nursed up, and taught to sing.  Of this Bird, the lovely Sophia, then about thirteen Years old, was so extremely fond, that the lovely Sophia chief Business was to feed and tend her chief Business, and the lovely Sophia chief Pleasure to play with her chief Business. By these Means little Tommy, for so the Bird was called, was become so tame, that the Bird would feed out of the Hand of the Bird Mistress, would perch up on the lovely Sophia Finger, and lie contented in the lovely Sophia Bosom, where it seemed almost sensible of the Bird own Happiness; tho the lovely Sophia always kept a small String about the Bird Leg, no would ever trust the Bird with the Liberty of flying away.  One Day, when Mr. Allworthy and his whole Family, dined at Mr. Western's, Master Blifil, being in the Garden with the lovely Sophia, and observing the extreme Fondness that the lovely Sophia showed for the Bird, desired the lovely Sophia to trust the Bird for a Moment in his Hands. the lovely Sophia presently complied with the young Gentleman's Request, and after some previous Caution, delivered his the lovely Sophia the Bird; of which his was no sooner in Possession, than his slipped the String from the String , and tossed the String into the Air.  The foolish Animal no sooner perceived The foolish Animal at Liberty, than forgetting all the Favors The foolish Animal had received from the lovely Sophia, The foolish Animal flew directly from the lovely Sophia, and perched on a Bough at some Distance.  the lovely Sophia, seeing the Bird the Bird gone, sereamed out so loud, that Tom Jones, who was at a little Distance, immediately ran to the lovely Sophia Assistance.  He was no sooner informed of what had happened, than He cursed Master Blifil for a pitiful, malicious Rascal, and then immediately stripping off He Coat, He applied He to climbing the Tree to which the Bird escaped.  Tom had almost recovered Tom little Namesake, when the Branch on which it was perched, and that hung over a Canal, broke, and the poor Lad plumped over Head and Ears into the Water.  the lovely Sophia's Concern now changed Sophia's Concern Object. And as the lovely Sophia apprehended the Boy's Life was in Danger, the lovely Sophia screamed ten times louder than before; and indeed Master Blifil now seconded the lovely Sophia with all the Vociferation in Master Blifil Power.  The company who were sitting in a Room next the Garden, were instantly alarmed, and came all forth; but just as The company who were sitting in a Room next the Garden reached the Canal, Tom, (for ^he the Water was luckily pretty shallow in that Part) ^rrived safely on shore.  Thwackum fell violently on poor Tom, who stood dropping and shivering before Thwackum, when Mr. Allworthy desired Mr. Allworthy to have Patience, and turning to ^aster Blifil, said, Pray, Child, what is the Reason ^f all this Disturbance?  Master Blifil answered, 'Indeed, Uncle, I am very sorry for what I have done; I have been unhappily the Occasion of it all. I had Miss Sophia's Bird in my Hand, and thinking the poor Creature languished for Liberty, I own, I could not forbear giving the poor Creature what the poor Creature desired: for I always thought there was something very cruel in confining any Thing. It seemed to me against the Law of Nature, by which every Thing has a right to Liberty; nay, it is even unchristian; for it is not doing what we would be done by: But if I had imagined the lovely Sophia the lovely Sophia would have been so much concerned at I had imagined Miss Sophia, I am sure I would never have done I had imagined Miss Sophia; nay, if I had known what would have happened to the Bird; for when Master Jones, who climbed up the Tree to which the Bird escaped after I had imagined Miss Sophia, fell into the Water, the Bird took a second Flight, and presently a nasty Hawk carried I had imagined Miss Sophia away. Poor Sophia, who now first heard of the lovely Sophia little Tommy's Fate; for the lovely Sophia Concern for Tom Jones had pre^ented the lovely Sophia perceiving I had imagined Miss Sophia when I had imagined Miss Sophia happened, shed a Shower of Tears. Mr. Allworthy endeavored to assuage, promising the lovely Sophia a much finer the Bird; but Mr. Allworthy declared the lovely Sophia would never have another. Her Father chid the lovely Sophia for crying so for a foolish the Bird; but could not help telling Master Blifil, if Mr. Allworthy was a Son of Mr. Allworthy, Mr. Allworthy Backside should be well flayed.  the lovely Sophia now returned to the lovely Sophia Chamber, the two ^oung Gentlemen were sent home, and the rest of the Company returned to the two ^oung Gentlemen Bottle; where a Conversation ensued on the Subject of the Bird, so curious that we think it deserves a Chapter by it.  CHAP. IV. Containing such very deep and grave Matters, the some Readers, perhaps, may not relish it.  SQUARE had no sooner lighted Sir Pipe, that addressing Sir to Allworthy, Sir thus began 'Sir, I cannot help congratulating you on your Nephew; who, at an Age when few Lads have any Ideas but of sensible Objects, is arrived at a Capacity of distinguishing Right from Wrong. To confine any thing, seems to Sir against the Law of Nature, by which every thing has a Right to Liberty. These were his Words; and the Impression These have made on Sir is never to be eradicated. Ca^ any Man have a higher Notion of the Rule of Right and the Eternal Fitness of Things. I cannot help promising Sir from such a Dawn, that the Meridian of this Youth will be equal to that of either the elder or the younger Brutus.'  Here Thwackum hastily interrupted, and spilling some of Thwackum Wine, and swallowing the rest with great Eagerness, answered, 'From another Expression h^ made use of, I hope h^ will resemble much better Men. The Law of Nature is a Jargon of Words which means nothing. I know not of any such Law, nor of any Right which can be derive^ from it. To do as we would be done by, is indeed a Christian Motive, as the Boy well expressed a Christian Motive, and I am glad to find my Instructions have born so good Fruit.'  'If Vanity was a thing fit (says Square) I might indulge some on the same Occasion; for whence h^ can only have learnt whence h^ Notions of Right or Wrong I think is pretty apparent. If there be no Law o^ Nature, there is no Right nor Wrong.'  'How! (says the Parson) do you then banish Revelation? Am I talking with a Deist or an Atheist?' 'Drink about, (says Western) Pox of your Laws, of Nature. I don't know what you mean either of you, by Right and Wrong. To take away the Bird was wrong in my Opinion; and Mr. Allworthy may do as Mr. Allworthy pleases; but to encourage Boys in such Practices, is to breed Boys up to the Gallows.'  Mr. Allworthy answered, 'that Mr. Allworthy was sorry for what your Nephew had done; but could not consent to punish Nephew, as Nephew acted rather from a generous than unworthy Motive.' Mr. Allworthy said, 'if the Boy had stolen the Bird, none would have been more ready to vote for a severe Chastisement than the Boy; but it was plain that was not the Boy Design:' And, indeed, was as apparent to the Boy, that the Boy could have no other View but what the Boy had the Boy confessed. (For as to that malicious Purpose which the lovely Sophia suspected, that malicious Purpose which Sophia suspected never once entered into the Head of Mr. Allworthy). the Boy, at length, concluded with again blaming the Action as inconsiderate, and which, the Boy said, was only pardonable in a Child.  SQUARE had delivered the Boy Opinion so openly, that ^f the Boy was now silent, the Boy must submit to have the Boy Judgment censured. the Boy said, therefore, with some Warmth, 'that Mr. Allworthy had too much respect to the dirty Consideration of Property. That in passing our Judgments on great and mighty Actions, all private Regards should be laid aside; for by adhering to those narrow Rules, the younger Brutus had been condemned of Ingratitude, and the elder of Parricide.'  And if they had been hanged too for those 'Crimes,' cried Thwackum, 'they would have had no more than they Deserts. A couple of heathenish Villains! Heaven be praised, our have no Brutus'-now-a-days. I wish, SQUARE, you would desist from filling the Minds of my Pupils with such Antichristian Stuff: For the Consequence must be, while the Consequence are under my Care, the Consequence being well scourged out of the Consequence again. There is Tom Tom almost spoiled already. I overheard Tom the other Day disputing with Master Blifil, that there was not Merit in Faith without Works. I know that is one of your Tenets, and I suppose Tom had it from you.'  'Don't accuse me of spoiling Tom,' says Square who taught Tom to laugh at whatever is virtuous and decent, and fit and right in the Nature of Things. Tom is your own Scholar, and I disclaim Tom. No, no, Master Blifil is my Boy. Young as Master Blifil is, tha^ Lad's Notions of moral Rectitude I defy you eve^ to eradicate.'  Thwackum put on a contemptuous Sneer at this and replied, 'Ay, ay, I will venture Thwackum with you. Thwackum is too well grounded for all your philosophical Cant to hurt. No, no, I have taken Care to instill such Principles into Thwackum. -- '  'And I have instilled Principles into Thwackum too cries Square. 'What but the sublime Idea of Virtue could inspire a human Mind with the generous Thought of giving Liberty. And I repeat to yo^ again, if it was a fit thing to be proud, I might claim the Honor of having infused that Idea -- '  'And if Pride was not forbidden,' said ThwackumI might boast of Mr. Counselor.'  'So between you both,' says the Squire, 'the your Gentleman has been taught to rob the Bird. I find I must take Care of my Partridg^ Mew. I shall have some virtuous, religious Man or other ^^t all my Partridges at Liberty.' The slapping a Gentleman of the Law, who was pres^n^ on the Back. Thwackum cried out, 'What say you to this, Mr. Counselor? Is not this against Law?'  The Lawyer, with great Gravity, delivered Thwackum as follows:  'If the Case be put of a Partridge, there can be no Doubt but an Action would lie: For though this be ferae Naturae, yet being reclaimed, Property vests; but being the Case of a Singing Bird, though reclaimed, as it is a Thing of base Nature, it must be considered as nullius in Bonis. In the Case of a Singing Bird, therefore, I conceive the Plaintiff must be nonsuited; and I should disadvise the bringing any such Action.'  'Well, (says the Squire) if it be nullus Bonus, let us drink about, and talk a little of the State of the Nation, or some such Discourse that we all understand; for I am sure I don't understand a Word of this. It may be Learning and Sense for aught I know; but you shall never persuade me into It. Pox! you have neither of you mentioned a Word of that poor Lad who deserves to be commended. To venture breaking his Neck to oblige my Girl, was a generous spirited Action; I have Learning enough to see that. D -- n me, here is Tom's Health, I shall love the Boy for it the longest Day I have to live.'  Thus was this Debate interrupted; but this Debate would ^robably have been soon resumed, had not Mr. Allworthy presently called for Mr. Allworthy Coach, and carried off ^he two Combatants.  Such was the Conclusion of this Adventure of the Bird, and the Dialogue occasioned by it, which we ^ould not help recounting to our Reader, though it ^appened some Years before the Stage, or Period of Time, at which our History is now arrived.  CHAP. V. Containing Matter accommodated to every Taste.  PARVA leves capiunt Animos, 'Small Things affect light Minds,' was the Sentiment of a great Master of the Passion of Love. And certain it is, that from this Day Sophia began to have some little Kindness for Tom Jones, and no little Aversion for Tom Jones Companion.  Many Accidents from time to time improved both these Passions in this Day Sophia Breast; which, without our recounting, the Reader may well conclude, from what our have before hinted of the different Tempers of these Lads, and how much the one suited with this Day Sophia own Inclinations more than the other. To say the Truth, Sophia, when very young, discerned that Tom, though an idle, thoughtless, rattling Rascal, was nobody's Enemy but Enemy own; and that Master Blifil, though a prudent, discreet, sober young Gentleman, was at the same Time strongly attached to the Interest only of one single Person; and who that single Person was, the Reader will be able to divine without any Assistance of ours.  These two Characters are not always received in the World with the different Regard which seems severally due to either; and which one would imagine Mankind, from self-interest, should show toward These two Characters. But perhaps there may be a political Reason for it: In finding one of a truly benevolent Disposition, Men may very reasonably suppose, Men have found a Treasure, and be desirous of keeping a Treasure, like all other good Things, to Men. Hence Men may imagine, that to trumpet forth the Praises of such a Person, would, in the vulgar Phrase, be crying Roastmeat; and calling in Partakers of what Men intend to apply solely to Men own Use. If this Reason does not satisfy the Reader, I know no other Means of accounting for the little Respect which I have commonly seen paid to a Character which really does great Honor to Human Nature, and is productive of the highest Good to Society. But it was otherwise with the lovely Sophia. the lovely Sophia honored Tom Jones, and scorned Master Blifil, almost as soon as the lovely Sophia knew the Meaning of those two Words.  the lovely Sophia had been absent upwards of three Years with the lovely Sophia Aunt; during all which Time the lovely Sophia had seldom seen either of these young Gentlemen. the lovely Sophia dined, however, once together with her Aunt, at Mr. Allworthy's. This was a few Days after the Adventure of the Partridge, before commemorated. the lovely Sophia heard the whole Story at Table, where the lovely Sophia said nothing; nor indeed could her Aunt get many Words from the lovely Sophia, as the lovely Sophia returned home; but the lovely Sophia Maid, when undressing the lovely Sophia, happening to say, 'Well, Miss, I suppose you have seen young Master Blifil to Day.' the lovely Sophia answered with much Passion, 'I hate the Name of Master Blifil, as I do whatever is base and treacherous; and I wonder Mr. Allworthy would suffer that old barbarous Schoolmaster to punish a poor Boy so cruelly for what was only the Effect of Mr. Allworthy Goodnature.' the lovely Sophia then recounted the Story to the lovely Sophia Maid, and concluded with Saying -- 'Don't you think Saying -- ' is a Boy of a noble Spirit?'  This young Lady was now returned to Lady Father; who gave Lady the Command of his House, and placed Lady at the upper End of his Table, where Tom (who from his great Love of Hunting was become a great Favorite of the Squire) often dined. Young Men of open, generous Dispositions are naturally inclined to Gallantry, which, if generous Dispositions have good understandings, as was in reality Tom's Case, exerts Tom's Case in an obliging, complaisant Behavior to all Women in general. This greatly distinguished Tom from the boisterous Brutality of mere Country Squires on the one hand; and from the solemn, and somewhat fullen, Deportment of Master Blifil on the other: And Master Blifil began now, at Nineteen, to have the Name of a pretty Fellow among all the Women in the Neighborhood.  Tom behaved to the lovely Sophia with no Particularity, unless, perhaps, by showing the lovely Sophia a higher Respect than Tom paid to any other. This Distinction the lovely Sophia Beauty, Fortune, Sense, and amiable Carriage, seemed to demand; but as to Design upon the lovely Sophia Person Tom had none; for which we shall at present suffer the Reader to condemn Tom of Stupidity; but perhaps we shall be able indifferently well to account for the Reader hereafter.  the lovely Sophia, with the highest Degree of Innocence and Modesty, had a remarkable Sprightliness in the lovely Sophia Temper. This was so greatly increased whenever the lovely Sophia was in Company with Tom, that, had he not been very young and thoughtless, he must have observed it; or had not Mr. Western's Thoughts been generally either in the Field, the Stable, or the Dog-kennel, it might have, perhaps, created some Jealousy in he; but so far was the your Gentleman from entertaining any such Suspicions, that he gave Tom every Opportunity with Tom Daughter which any Lover could have wished. And Tom Tom innocently improved to better Advantage, by following only the Dictates of his natural Gallantry and goodnature, than his might, perhaps, have done, had his had the deepest Designs on the young Lady.  But, indeed, the deepest Designs on the young Lady can occasion little Wonder that this Matter escaped the Observation of others, since poor the lovely Sophia herself never remarked it, and poor Sophia herself Heart was irretrivably lost before poor Sophia herself suspected it was in Danger.  Matters were in this Situation, when Tom one Afternoon finding the lovely Sophia alone, began, after a short Apology, with a very serious Face, to acquaint the lovely Sophia, that Tom had a Favor to ask of the lovely Sophia, which Tom hoped the lovely Sophia Goodness would comply with.  Though neither the young Man's Behavior, nor indeed the young Man Manner of opening this Business, were such as could give poor Sophia herself any just Cause of suspecting the young Man intended to make Love to poor Sophia herself; yet, whether Nature whispered something into poor Sophia herself Ear, or from what Cause it arose I will not determine, certain it is, some Idea of that Kind must have intruded some Idea of that Kind; for poor Sophia herself Color forsook poor Sophia herself Cheeks, poor Sophia herself Limbs trembled, and poor Sophia herself Tongue would have faultered, had Tom stopped for an Answer: But Tom soon relieved poor Sophia herself from poor Sophia herself Perplexity, by proceeding to inform poor Sophia herself of Tom Request, which was to solicit poor Sophia herself Interest on Behalf of the Game-keeper, whose own Ruin, and that of a large Family, must be, Tom said, the Consequence of Mr. Western's pursuing Tom Action against Tom.  the lovely Sophia presently recovered the lovely Sophia Confusion, and with a Smile full of Sweetness, said, 'Is this the mighty Favor you asked with so much Gravity. I will do it with all my Heart. I really pity the poor Fellow, and no longer ago than Yesterday sent a small Matter to Fellow Wife.' a small Matter Matter was one of his Wife Gowns, some Linen, and ten Shillings in Money, of which Tom had heard, and it had, in reality, put this Solicitation into Tom Head.  Our Youth, now emboldened with Tom Success, resolved to push a small Matter farther; and ventured even to beg the lovely Sophia Recommendation of Tom to the lovely Sophia Father's Service; protesting that Tom thought Tom one of the honestest Fellows in the Country, and extremely well qualified for the Place of a Game-keeper, which luckily then happened to be vacant.  the lovely Sophia answered; 'Well, I will undertake this too; but I cannot promise you as much Success as in the former Part, which I assure you I will not quit my Father without obtaining. However, I will do what I can for the poor FellowFellow, for I sincerely look upon the poor Fellow and the poor Fellow Family as Objects of great Compassion.' -- 'And now, the poor Fellow, I must ask' you a Favor. -- '  'A Favor, Madam, (cries Tom) if you knew the Pleasure you have given me in the Hopes of receiving a Command from you, you would think by mentioning it you must confer the greatest Favor on me; for by this dear Hand I would sacrifice my Life to oblige you.'  me then snatched this dear Hand, and eagerly kissed this dear Hand, which was the first Time me Lips had ever touched the lovely Sophia. The Blood, which before had forsaken the lovely Sophia Cheeks, now made the lovely Sophia sufficient Amends, by rushing all over the lovely Sophia Face and Neck with such Violence, that The Blood, which before had forsaken her Cheeks became all of a scarlet Color. the lovely Sophia now first felt a Sensation to which the lovely Sophia had been before a Stranger, and which, when the lovely Sophia had Leisure to reflect on it, began to acquaint the lovely Sophia with some Secrets, which the Reader, if he does not already guess them, will know in due Time.  the lovely Sophia, as soon as the lovely Sophia could speak (which was not instantly) informed he, that the Favor the lovely Sophia had to desire of he, was not to lead her Father through so many Dangers in Hunting; for that, from what the lovely Sophia had heard, the lovely Sophia was terribly frightened every Time the Favor she had to desire of him, was not to lead her Father through so many Dangers in Hunting went out together, and expected some Day or other to see her Father brought Home with broken Limbs. the lovely Sophia therefore begged he, for the lovely Sophia Sake, to be more cautious; and, as he well knew Mr. Western would follow he, not to ride so madly, nor to take those dangerous Leaps for the future.  Tom faithfully promised to obey the lovely Sophia Commands; and after thanking the lovely Sophia for the lovely Sophia kind Compliance with Tom Request, took Tom Leave, and departed highly charmed with his Success.  the lovely Sophia was charmed too; but in a very different Way. the lovely Sophia Sensations, however, the Reader's Heart, (if he or the lovely Sophia have any) will better represent than I can, if I had as many Mouths as ever Poet wished for, to eat, I suppose, those many Dainties with which he was so plentifully provided.  It was Mr. Western's Custom every Afternoon, as soon as Mr. Western's Custom was drunk, to hear Mr. Western's Custom play on the Harpsichord: for Mr. Western's Custom was a great Lover of Music, and perhaps, had Mr. Western's Custom lived in Town, might have passed for a Connoisseur: for Mr. Western's Custom always excepted against the finest Compositions of Mr. Handel. Mr. Western's Custom never relished any Music but what was light and airy; and indeed Mr. Western's Custom most favorite Tunes, were Old Sir Simon the King, St. George, Mr. Western's Custom was for England, Bobbing Joan, and some others.  Mr. Western's Custom his Daughter though his Daughter was a perfect Mistress of Music, and would never willingly have played any but Mr. Handel's, was so devoted to her Father's Pleasure, that his Daughter learnt all those Tunes to oblige Mr. Western's Custom. However, his Daughter would now and then endeavor to lead Mr. Western's Custom into his Daughter our own Taste, and when Mr. Western's Custom required the Repetition of Mr. Western's Custom Ballads, would answer with a 'Nay, dear Sir,' and would often beg Mr. Western's Custom to suffer his Daughter to play something else.  This Evening, however, when the your Gentleman was retired from the your Gentleman Bottle, his Daughter played all the your Gentleman Favorites three Times over, without any Solicitation. This so pleased the good Squire, that Squire started from Squire Couch, gave Squire Daughter a Kiss, and swore his Daughter a Kiss Hand was greatly improved. his Daughter a Kiss took this Opportunity to execute his Daughter a Kiss promise to Tom, in which his Daughter a Kiss succeeded so well, that the Squire declared, if his Daughter a Kiss would give the Squire declared the other Bout of old Sir Simon, the Squire declared would give the Game-keeper the Squire declared Deputation the next Morning. old Sir Simon was played again and again, till the Charms of Music soothed Mr. Western to sleep. In the lovely Sophia did not fail to remind old Sir Simon of old Sir Simon Engagement, and old Sir Simon Attorney was immediately sent for, ordered to stop any further proceedings in the Action, and to make out his Deputation.  Tom's Success in this Affair soon began to ring over the Country, and various were the Censures past upon it. Some greatly applauded it as an Act of good Nature, others sneering, and saying, 'No Wonder that one idle the poor Fellow should love another.' Young Blifil was greatly enraged at Young Blifil. Young Blifil had long hated Black George in the same Proportion as the poor Fellow delighted in the poor Fellow; not for any offense which the poor Fellow had ever received, but from the poor Fellow great Love to Religion and Virtue: For Black George had the Reputation of a loose kind of the poor Fellow. Young Blifil therefore represented this as flying in Mr. Allworthy's Face; and declared with great Concern, that it was impossible to find any other Motive for doing Good to such a Wretch.  Thwackum and Square likewise sung to the same Tune: They were now (especially the latter) become greatly jealous of young Jones with the Widow: For young Jones now approached the Age of Twenty, was really a fine young Fellow; and that Lady, by Lady Encouragements to young Jones, seemed daily more and more to think young Jones so.  Allworthy was not, however, moved with They Malice. Allworthy declared Allworthy very well satisfied with what the poor Fellow had done. Allworthy said, the Perseverance and Integrity of Allworthy Friendship was highly commendable, and Allworthy wished Allworthy could see more frequent Instances of that Virtue.  But Fortune who seldom greatly relishes such Sparks as TomTom, perhaps, because they do not pay more ardent Addresses to her, gave now a very different Turn to all Allworthy Actions, and showed they to Allworthy in a Light far less agreeable than that Gentleman's Goodness had hitherto seen they in.  CHAP. VI. An Apology for the Insensibility of the poor Fellow, to all the Charms of the lovely Sophiathe lovely Sophia; in which possibly we may, in a considerable Degree, lower the poor Fellow Character in the Estimation of those Men of Wit and Gallantry, who approve the Heroes in most of our modern Comedies.  THERE are two Sorts of People, who I am afraid, have already conceived some Contempt for my Hero, on Account of my Hero Behavior to the lovely Sophia. The former of these will blame my Hero Prudence in neglecting an Opportunity to possess my Hero of Mr. Western's Fortune; and the latter will no less despise my Hero for my Hero Backwardness to so fine a Girl, who seemed ready to fly into my Hero Arms, if my Hero would open them to receive the lovely Sophia.  Now, though I shall not perhaps be able absolutely to acquit my Hero of either of these Charges; (for Want of his Prudence admits of no Excuse; and what I shall produce against the latter Charge, will, I apprehend, be scarce satisfactory;) yet as Evidence may sometimes be offered in Mitigation, I shall set forth the plain Matter of Fact, and leave the whole to the Reader's Determination.  the poor Fellow had somewhat about the poor Fellow, which, though I think Writers are not thoroughly agreed in the Reader's Determination Name, does certainly inhabit some human Breasts; whose Use is not so properly to distinguish Right from Wrong, as to prompt and incite some human Breasts; whose Use is not so properly to distinguish Right from Wrong, as to prompt and incite them to the former, and to restrain and withold them from the latter to the former, and to restrain and withold some human Breasts; whose Use is not so properly to distinguish Right from Wrong, as to prompt and incite them to the former, and to restrain and withold them from the latter from the latter.  This Somewhat may be indeed resembled to the famous Trunk-maker in the Playhouse: for whenever the Person who is possessed of the famous Trunk-maker in the Playhouse does what is right, no ravished or friendly Spectator is so eager, or so loud in the poor Fellow Applause; on the contrary, when the poor Fellow does wrong, no Critic is so apt to hiss and explode the poor Fellow.  To give a higher Idea of the Principle I mean, as well as one more familiar to the present Age; it may be considered as sitting on it Throne in the Mind, like the LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR of this Kingdom in his Court; where it presides, governs, directs, judges, acquits and condemns according to Merit and Justice; with a Knowledge which nothing escapes, a Penetration which nothing can deceive, and an Integrity which nothing can corrupt.  the Principle may perhaps be said to constitute the most essential Barrier between us, and our Neighbors the Brutes; for if there be some in the human Shape, who are not under any such Dominion, I choose rather to consider some in the human Shape, who are not under any such Dominion as Deserters from us to us Neighbors; among whom some in the human Shape, who are not under any such Dominion will have the Fate of Deserters, and not be placed in the first Rank.  us , whether my Hero derived it from Thwackum or Square I will not determine, was very strongly under the Guidance of the Principle: for though my Hero did not always act rightly, yet my Hero never did otherwise without feeling and suffering for it. It was this which taught my Hero, that to repay the Civilities and little Friendships of Hospitality by robbing the House where you have received the Civilities and little Friendships of Hospitality, is to be the basest and meanest of Thieves. my Hero did not think the Baseness of this Offense lessened by the Height of the Injury committed; on the contrary, if to steal another's Plate deserved Death and Infamy, it seemed to my Hero difficult to assign a Punishment adequate to the robbing a Man of my Hero whole Fortune, and of my Hero Child into the Bargain.  the Principle therefore prevented my Hero from any Thought of making my Hero Fortune by such Means (for this, as I have said, is an active Principle, and does not content this with Knowledge or Belief only.) Had my Hero been greatly enamoured of the lovely Sophia, my Hero possibly might have thought otherwise; but give me Leave to say, there is great Difference between running away with a Man's Daughter from the Motive of his great Love to Religion and Virtue, and doing the same Thing from the Motive of Theft.  Now though the your Gentleman was not insensible of the Charms of the lovely Sophia; though the your Gentleman greatly liked the lovely Sophia Beauty, and esteemed all the lovely Sophia other Qualifications, the lovely Sophia had made, however, no deep Impression on my Hero Heart: For which, as it renders my Hero liable to the Charge of Stupidity, or at least of Want of Taste, we shall now proceed to account.  The Truth then is, The Truth was in the Possession of this Woman. Here I question not, but the Reader will be surprised at our long Taciturnity as to this Matter; and at no less Loss to divine who this Woman was; since our have hitherto not dropped a Hint of any one likely to be a Rival to the lovely Sophia: For as to Young Blifil, though our have been obliged to mention some Suspicions of Young Blifil Affection for Tom, our have not hitherto given the least Latitude for imagining that Tom had any for Young Blifil; and, indeed, I am sorry to say it, but the Youth of both Sexes are too apt to be deficient in both Sexes Gratitude, for that Regard with which Persons more advanced in Years are sometimes so kind to honor both Sexes.  That the Reader may be no longer in Suspense, the Reader will be pleased to remember, that we have often mentioned the Family of George Seagrim, commonly called Black George, the Game-keeper, which consisted at present of a Wife and five Children.  The second of five Children was a Daughter, whose Name was Molly, and who was esteemed one of the handsomest Girls in the whole Country.  Congreve well says, There is in true Beauty something which vulgar Souls cannot admire; so can no Dirt or Rags hide this Something from those Souls which are not of the vulgar Stamp.  true Beauty made, however, no Impression on Tom, till true Beauty grew toward the Age of Sixteen, when Tom, who was near three Years older, began first to cast the Eyes of Affection upon true Beauty. And this Affection he had fixed on this Girl long before he could bring he to attempt the Possession of this Girl Person: for though he Constitution urged he greatly to this, he Principles no less forcibly restrained he. To debauch a young Woman, however low a young Woman Condition was, appeared to he a very heinous Crime; and the Good Will he bore the Father, with the Compassion he had for he Family, very strongly corroborated all such sober Reflections; so that he once resolved to get the better of he Inclinations, and he actually abstained three whole Months without ever going to Seagrim's House, or seeing he Daughter.  Now though Molly was, as we have said, generally thought a very fine Girl, and in reality Molly was so, yet Molly was not of the most amiable Kind. It had indeed very little of Feminine in It, and would at least have become a Man as well as a Woman; for, to say the Truth, Youth and florid Health had a very considerable Share in the Composition.  Nor was Molly Mind more effeminate than Molly Person. As this was tall and robust, so was that bold and forward. So little had Molly of Modesty, that the poor Fellow had more Regard for Molly Virtue than Molly Molly. And as most probably Molly liked Tom as well as Tom liked Molly, so when Molly perceived his Backwardness, Molly grew proportionably forward; and when Molly saw Tom had entirely deserted the House, Molly found Means of throwing Molly in Tom Way, and behaved in such a Manner, that the Youth must have had very much, or very little of my Hero, if Molly Endeavors had proved unsuccessful. In a Word, Molly soon triumphed over all the virtuous Resolutions of the poor Fellow: For though Molly behaved at last with all decent Reluctance, yet I rather choose to attribute the Triumph to Molly, Since, in Fact, it was Molly Design which succeeded.  In the Conduct of this Matter, Molly so well played Molly Part, that the poor Fellow attributed the Conquest entirely to the poor Fellow, and considered the young Woman as one who had yielded to the violent Attacks of the poor Fellow Passion. the poor Fellow likewise imputed Molly yielding, to the ungovernable Force of Molly Love toward the poor Fellow; and this the Reader will allow to have been a very natural and probable Supposition, as we have more than once mentioned the uncommon Comeliness of the poor Fellow Person: And indeed the poor Fellow was one of the handsomest young Fellows in the World.  As there are some Minds whose Affections, like Master Blifl's, are solely placed on one single Person, whose Interest and indulgence alone they consider on every Occasion; regarding the Good and Ill of all others as merely indifferent, any farther than as they contribute to the Pleasure or Advantage of that Person: So there is a different Temper of Mind which borrows a Degree of Virtue even from Self-love; such can never receive any kind of Satisfaction from another, without loving the Creature to whom that Satisfaction is owing, and without making its Wellbeing in some sort necessary to they own Ease.  Of this latter Species was my Hero. my Hero considered this Girl as one whose Happiness or Misery my Hero had caused to be dependent on my Hero. this Girl was still the Object of Desire, though greater Beauty, or a fresher Object, might have been more so; but the little Abatement which Fruition had occasioned to this, was highly overballanced by the Considerations of the Affection which this Girl visibly bore my Hero, and of the Situation into which my Hero had brought this Girl. The former of these created Gratitude, the latter Compassion; and both together with my Hero Desire for this Girl Person, raised in my Hero a Passion, which might, without any great Violence to the Word, be called Love; though, perhaps, it was at first not very judiciously placed.  This then was the true Reason of that Insensibility which my Hero had shown of the Charms of Sophia, and of that Behavior in the lovely Sophia, which might have been reasonable enough interpreted as an Encouragement to my Hero Addresses: For as my Hero could not think of abandoning my Hero Molly, poor and destitute as Molly was, so no more could my Hero entertain a Notion of betraying such a Creature as the lovely Sophia. And surely, had my Hero given the least Encouragement to any his Passion for that young Lady, my Hero must have been absolutely guilty of one or other of those Crimes; either of which would, in my Opinion, have very justly subjected my Hero to that Fate, which at my Hero first Introduction into this History, I mentioned to have been generally predicted as my Hero certain Destiny.  CHAP. VII. Being the shortest Chapter in this Book.  Molly first perceived the Alteration in the Shape of Molly, and in order to hide the Alteration in the Shape of Molly from Molly Neighbors, Molly foolishly clothed Molly in that Sack which Sophia had sent Molly. Though indeed that that young Lady that young Lady had little Apprehension, that this Woman would have been weak enough to let any of this Woman Daughters wear it in that Form.  Molly was charmed with the first Opportunity Molly had ever had of showing Molly to Advantage; for though Molly could very well bear to contemplate Molly in the Glass, even when dressed in Rags; and though Molly had in that Dress conquered the Heart of the poor Fellow, and perhaps of some others; yet Molly thought the Addition of Finery would much improve Molly Charms, and extend Molly Conquests.  Molly, therefore, having dressed Molly out in that Sack which Sophia had sent her, with a new laced Cap, and some other Ornaments which Tom had given Molly, repairs to Church with Molly Fan in Molly Hand the very next Sunday. The Great are deceived, if The Great imagine The Great have appropriated Ambition and Vanity to The Great. These noble Qualities flourish as notably in a Country Church, and Churchyard, as in the Drawing Room, or in the Closet. Schemes have indeed been laid in the Vestry, which would hardly disgrace the Conclave. Here is a Ministry, and here is an Opposition. Here are Plots and Circumventions, Parties and Factions, equal to those which are to be found in Courts.  Nor are the Women here less practiced in the highest Feminine Arts than the Women here less practiced in the highest Feminine Arts than their fair Superiors in Quality and Fortune fair Superiors in Quality and Fortune. Here are prudes and Coquettes. Here are Dressing and Ogling, Falsehood, Envy, Malice, Scandal; in short, every Thing which is common to the most splendid Assembly, or politest Circle. Let those of high Life, therefore, no longer despise the Ignorance of those of high Life Inferiors; nor the Vulgar any longer rail at the Vices of those of high Life Betters.  Molly had seated Molly some time before Molly was known by her Neighbors; and a Whisper ran through the whole Congregation, 'Who is Molly?' But when Molly was discovered, such sneering, gigling, tittering, and laughing, ensued among the Women, that Mr. Allworthy was obliged to exert Mr. Allworthy Authority to preserve any Decency among them.  CHAP. VIII. A Battle sung by the Muse in the Homerican Style, and which none but the classical Reader can taste.  MR. Western had an Estate in this Parish; and as his House stood at little greater Distance from a Country Church than from his own, his very often came to divine Service here; and both his and the charming Sophia happened to be present at this Time.  Sophia was much pleased with the Beauty of the Girl, whom Sophia pitied for Sophia Simplicity, in having dressed Sophia in that Manner, as Sophia saw the Envy which it had occasioned among Sophia Equals. Sophia no sooner came home, than Sophia sent for the Game-keeper, and ordered the Game-keeper to bring the Game-keeper Daughter to Sophia; saying, Sophia would provide for Sophia in the Family, and might possibly place the Girl about Sophia own Person, when Sophia own Maid, who was now going away, had left Sophia.  Poor Seagrim was thunderstruck at this; for Poor Seagrim was no Stranger to the Fault in the Shape of Poor Seagrim . Poor Seagrim answered, in a stammering Voice, 'That Poor Seagrim was afraid Molly would be too awkward to wait on Molly Ladyship, as Molly had never been at Service.' 'No matter for that,' says Sophia, 'Sophia will soon improve. I am pleased with the Girl, and am resolved to try the Girl.'  Black George now repaired to Black George Wife, on whose prudent Council Black George depended to extricate Black George out of this Dilemma; but when Black George came thither, Black George found Black George in some Confusion. So great Envy had that Sack which Sophia had sent her occasioned, that when Mr. Allworthy and the other Gentry were gone from Church, the Rage which had hitherto been confined, burst into an Uproar, and having vented itself at first in opprobrious Words, Laughs, Hisses, and Gestures, betook itself at last to certain missile Weapons; which, though from their plastic Nature their threatened neither the Loss of Life or of Limb, were however sufficiently dreadful to a well-dressed Lady. Molly had too much Spirit to bear this Treatment tamely. Having therefore -- But hold, as we are diffident of we own Abilities, let we here invite a superior Power to we Assistance.  Ye Muses then, whoever you are, who love to sing Battles, and principally thou, who whileom did recount the Slaughter in those Fields where Hudibras and Trulla fought, if thou were not starved with thy Friend Butler, assist me on this great Occasion. All things are not in the Power of all.  As a vast Herd of Cows in a rich Farmer's Yard, if, while they are milked, they hear they Calves at a Distance lamenting the Robbery which is then committing, roar and bellow: So roared forth the Somersetshire Mob an Hallaloo, made up of almost as many Squawls, Screams, and other different Sounds, as there were Persons, or indeed Passions, among Persons: Some were inspired by Rage, others alarmed by Fear, and others had nothing in others Heads but the Love of Fun; but chiefly Envy, the Sister of Satan, and his constant Companion, rushed among the Crowd, and blew up the Fury of the Women; who no sooner came up to Molly, than Some pelted Molly with Dirt and Rubbish.  Molly, having endeavored in vain to make a handsome Retreat, faced about; and laying hold of ragged Bess, who advanced in the Front of the Enemy, Molly at one Blow felled Molly to the Ground. The whole Army of the Enemy (though near a hundred in Number) seeing the Fate of their General, gave back many Paces, and retired behind a new-dug Grave; for the Churchyard was the Field of Battle, where there was to be a Funeral that very Evening. Molly pursued Molly Victory, and catching up a Skull which lay on the Side of the Grave, discharged the Grave with such Fury, that having hit a Tailor on the Head, the two Skulls sent equally forth a hollow Sound at the two Skulls Meeting, and a Tailor took presently measure of a Tailor Length on the Ground, where the two Skulls lay side by side, and it was doubtful which was the most valuable of the two. Molly then taking a Thigh Bone in her Hand, fell in among the flying Ranks, and dealing Molly Blows with great Liberality neither Side, overthrew the Carcass of many a mighty Hero and Heroine.  Recount, O Muse, the Names of those who fell on this fatal Day. First Jemmy Tweedle felt on First Jemmy Tweedle hinder Head the direful Bone. First Jemmy Tweedle the pleasant Bank of sweetly winding Stower had nourished, where Stower first learnt the vocal Art, with which, wandering up and down at Wakes and Fairs, Stower cheered the rural Nymphs and Swains, when upon the Green when upon the Green interweave the sprightly Dance; while Stower stood fidling and jumping to Stower own Music. How little now avails Stower Fiddle? Stower thumps the verdant Floor with Stower Carcass. Next old Echepole, the Sowgelder, received a Blow in Stower Forehead from our Amazonian Heroine, and immediately fell to the Ground. Stower was a swinging fat Fellow, and fell with almost as much Noise as a House. Stower Tobacco-box dropped at the same Time from Stower Pocket, which Molly took up as lawful Spoils. Then Kate of the Mill tumbled unfortunately over a Tombstone, which catching hold of Kate ungartered Stocking, inverted the Order of Nature, and gave Kate Heels the Superiority to Kate . Betty Pippin, with young Roger Kate Lover, fell both to the Ground. Where, O perverse Fate, Kate salutes the Earth, and he the Sky. Tom Freckle, the Smith's Son, was the next Victim to Kate Rage. he was an ingenious Workman, and made excellent Pattins; nay the very Pattin with which he was knocked down was he own Workmanship. Had he been at that Time singing Psalms in a Country Church, he would have avoided a broken Head. Miss Crow, the Daughter of a Farmer; John Giddish, himself a Farmer; Nan Slouch, Esther Codling, Will Spray, Tom Bennet; the three Misses Potter, whose Father keeps the Sign of the Red Lion. Betty Chambermaid, Jack Ostler, and many others of inferior Note, lay rolling among the Graves.  Not that the strenuous Arm of Molly reached all these; for many of all these in all these Flight overthrew each other.  But now Fortune fearing she had acted out of he, and had inclined too long to the same Side, especially as it was the right Side, hastily turned about: For now Goody Brown, whom Zekiel Brown cares^es in Zekiel Brown Arms; nor Zekiel Brown alone, but half the Parish besides; so famous was she in the Fields of Venus, nor indeed less in those of Mars. The Trophies of both these, Zekiel Brown always bore about on Zekiel Brown Head and Face; for if ever the Head did by its Horns display the amorous Glories of a Wife, Zekiel's did; nor did Zekiel Brown well-scratched Face less denote she Talents (or rather Talons) of a different Kind.  No longer bore this Amazon the shameful Flight of she Party. she stopped short, and calling aloud to all who fled, spoke as follows: 'Ye Somersetshire Men, or rather ye Somersetshire Women, are ye not ashamed, thus to fly from a single Woman; but if no other will oppose she, I myself and Joan Top here will have the Honor of the Victory.' Having thus said, she flew at Molly Seagrim, and easily wrenched a Thigh Bone from she , at the same Time clawing off she Cap from she . Then laying hold of the Hair of Molly, with her Hand, Molly attacked Molly so furiously in the Face with the Right, that the Blood soon began to trickle from Molly Nose. Molly was not idle this while. Molly soon removed the Clout from the Head, and then fastening on the Hair of Molly with one Hand, with the other Molly caused the same bloody Stream to issue forth from the Nostril of the Enemy.  When each of the Combatants had bore off sufficient Spoils of Hair from the Head, Rage Rage was against each of the Combatants Garments. In this Attack their Garments exerted so much Violence, that in a very few Minutes, their Garments were their Garments naked to the middle.  It is lucky for the Women, that the Seat of Fistycuff-War is not the same with the Women as among Men; but though the Women may seem a little to deviate from the Women Sex, when the Women go forth to Battle, yet I have observed the Women never so far forget it, as to assail the Bosom, of each other; where a few Blows would be fatal to most of the Women. This, I know, some derive from some being of a more bloody Inclination than the Males. On which Account some apply to the Nose, as to the Part whence Blood may most easily be drawn; but this seems a far-fetched, as well as illnatured Supposition.  Goody Brown had great Advantage of Molly in this Particular; for the former had indeed no Breasts, Molly Bosom (if it may be so called) as well in Color as in many other Properties, exactly resembling an ancient Piece of Parchment, upon which any one might have drummed a considerable while, without doing Molly any great Damage.  Molly, besides Molly present unhappy Condition, was differently formed in those Parts, and might, perhaps, have attempted the Envy of Goody Brown to give a Molly fatal Blow, had not the lucky Arrival of Tom Jones at this Instant put an immediate End to the bloody Scene.  This Accident was luckily owing to Mr. Square; for Mr. Square, Master Blifil, and Tom Jones, had mounted he, Master Blifil, and Jones Horses, after a Country Church, to take the Air, and had ridden about a Quarter of a Mile, when Square, changing Mr. Square Mind, (not idly, but for a Reason which we shall unfold as soon as we have Leisure) desired the young Gentlemen to ride with Mr. Square another Way than the young Gentlemen had at first purposed. This Motion being complied with, brought the young Gentlemen of Necessity back again to the Churchyard.  Master Blifil, who rode first, seeing such a Mob assembled, and two Women in the Posture in which we left the Combatants, stopped his Horse to enquire what was the Matter. A Country Fellow, scratching A Country Fellow , answered a broken Head; 'I don't know Measter un't I; an't please your Honor, here has been a Vight, I think, between Goody Brown and Mol Seagrim.' 'Who, who, cries Tom?' but without waiting for an Answer, having discovered the Feathres of Tom through all the Discomposure in which they now were, Tom hastily alighted, turned ^is his Horse loose, and leaping over the Wall, ran to the Feathres of his Molly. the Feathres of his Molly now, first bursting into Tears, told Tom how ^arbarously the Feathres of his Molly had been treated. Upon which, forgetting the Sex of Goody Brown, or perhaps not ^nowing the Sex of Goody Brown, in Tom Rage; for, in reality, the Feathres of his Molly had no ^eminine Appearance, but a Petticoat, which Tom might ^ot observe, Tom gave the Feathres of his Molly a Lash or two with Tom Horsewhip; and then flying at the Mob, who were all accused by Molly, Tom dealt Tom Blows so profusely in all Sides, that unless I would again invoke the ^luse, (which the good-natured Reader may think a ^^ttle too hard upon the Feathres of his Molly, as the Feathres of his Molly has so lately been violently sweated) it would be impossible for me to re^ount the Horsewhipping of that Day.  Having scoured the whole Coast of the Enemy, as well as any of Homer's Heroes ever did, or as Don Quixotte, or any Knight Errand in the World could ^ave done, Knight Errand returned to Molly, whom Knight Errand found in a Condition, which must give both me and my Reader Pain, was it to be described here. Tom raved like Madman, beat Tom Breast, tore Tom Hair, stamped ^n the Ground, and vowed the utmost Vengeance on all who had been concerned. Tom then pulled off Tom Coat, and buttoned his Coat round his Coat, put Tom Hat upon ^er Head, wiped the Blood from his Coat Face as well as ^e could with Tom Handkerchief, and called out to the Servant to ride as fast as possible for a Side-saddle, or Pillion, that the Servant might carry his Coat safe home.  Master Blifil objected to the sending away the Servant, as they had only one with they; but as Square seconded the Order of Tom Jones, Master Blifil was obliged to comply.  the Servant the Servant returned in a very short Time with ^he Pillion, and Molly, having collected Molly Rags as well Molly could, was placed behind the Servant. In which Manner Molly was carried home, Square, Blifil and Jones, attending.  Here Tom Jones, having received the Servant , given Molly a sly Kiss, and whispered Molly that the Servant would return i^ the Evening, quitted the Servant , and rode on after the Servant Companions.  CHAP. IX. Containing Matters of no very peaceable Color.  MOLLY had no sooner apparelled Molly in Molly accustomed Rags, than Molly Sisters began to fall violently upon Molly; particularly Molly elder Sister, who told Molly Molly was well enough served. 'How had Molly the Assurance to wear a Gown which young Madam Western had given to Mother! If one of us was to wear it, I think,' says Molly, 'I myself have the best Right; but I warrant you think it belongs to your Beauty. I suppose you think yourself more handsomer than any of us.' 'Hand Molly down the Bit of Glass from over the Cupboard,' cries another,
