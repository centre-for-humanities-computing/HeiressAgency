ever have a Morsel of Meat of mine, or a Farthing to buy it: If Farthing will ha un, one Smock shall be Farthing Portion. I Will sooner ge my Esteate to the zinking Fund, that it may be sent to Hannover to corrupt our Nation with.' I am heartily sorry,' cries Allworthy. 'Pox of your Sorrow,' says Western, 'it will do me Abundance of Good, when I have lost my only Child, my poor Sophy, that was the Joy of my Heart, and all the Hope and Comfort of my Age; but I am resolved I will turn Comfort out of Doors, Comfort shall beg and starve and rot in the Streets. Not one Hapenny, not a Hapenny shall Comfort ever hae of mine. The Son of a Bitch was always good at finding a Hare sitting; an be rotted to'n, I little thought what Puss Puss was looking after; but to'n shall be the worst Puss ever vound in Puss Life. Puss shall be no better than Carrion; the Skin over is all Carrion shall ha, and zu you may tell un.' 'I am in Amazement,' cries Alllworthy 'at what you tell me, after what passed between my Nephew and the young Lady no longer ago than Yesterday.' 'Yes, Sir,' answered Western, 'it was after what passed between my Nephew and the young Lady the young Lady that the whole Matter came out. Mr. Blifil there was no sooner gone than The Son of a Bitch came lurching about the House. Little did I think when I used to love The Son of a Bitch for a Sportsman, that The Son of a Bitch was all the while a poaching after my Daughter.' 'Why, truly,' says Allworthy, 'I could wish you had not given The Son of a Bitch so many Opportunities with Allworthy; and you will do me the Justice to acknowledge, that I have always been averse to The Son of a Bitch staying so much at the House, though I own I had no Suspicion of this Kind.' 'Why, Zounds!' cries Western, 'who could have thought it? What the Devil had Allworthy to do wi'n? the Devil did not come there a courting to Allworthy, the Devil came a hunting with the Devil.' 'But was it possible,' says Allworthy, 'that you should never discern any Symptoms of Love between Allworthy, ', when you have seen Allworthy, ' so often together? 'Never in my Life, as I hope to be saved,' cries Western. I never so much as see the Devil kiss Allworthy in all my Life; and so far from courting Allworthy, the Devil used rather to be more silent when Allworthy was in Company than at any other Time: And as for Allworthy, Allworthy was always less civil to'n than to any young Man that came to the House. As to that Matter, I am not more easy to be deceived than another, I would not have you think I am Neighbor.' Allworthy could scarce refrain Laughter at this; but Allworthy resolved to do a Violence to Allworthy: For Allworthy perfectly well knew Mankind, and had too much good Breeding and good Nature to offend the Squire in the Squire present Circumstances. Allworthy then asked Western what Allworthy would have Allworthy do upon this Occasion. To which the other answered, 'That Allworthy would have Allworthy keep the Rascal away from Allworthy , and that Allworthy would go and lock up the Wench: For Allworthy was resolved to make Allworthy marry Mr. Blifil in Spite of Allworthy Teeth.' Allworthy then shook Mr. Blifil by the Hand, and swore Allworthy would have no other Son-in-law. Presently after which Allworthy took Allworthy Leave, saying, Allworthy was in such Disorder, that it was necessary for Allworthy to make Haste home, to take care Allworthy Daughter did not give Allworthy the Slip; and as for Jones, Allworthy swore if Allworthy caught Allworthy at Allworthy , Allworthy would qualify Allworthy to run for the Gelding's Plate.  When Allworthy and Blifil were again left together, a long Silence ensued between Allworthy and Blifil; all which Interval the young Gentleman filled up with Sighs, which proceeded partly from Disappointment, but more from Hatred: For the Success of Jones was much more grievous to Jones, than the Loss of Sophia.  At length Jones Uncle asked Jones what Jones was determined to do, and Jones answered in the following Words. 'Alas, Jones, can it be a Question what Step a Lover will take, when Reason and Passion point different Ways? I am afraid it is too certain Step a Lover will, in that Dilemma, always follow the latter. Reason dictates to me, to quit all Thoughts of a Woman who places a Woman who places her Affections on another Affections on another; my Passion bids me hope a Woman who places her Affections on another may, in Time, change a Woman who places her Affections on another Inclinations in my Favor. Here, however, I conceive an Objection may be raised, which if it could not fully be answered, would totally deter me from any further Pursuit. I mean the Injustice of endeavoring to supplant another, in a Heart of which he seems already in Possession; but the determined Resolution of Mr. Western shows, that in this Case, I shall by so doing, promote the Happiness of every Party; not only that of the Parent, who will thus be preserved from the highest Degree of Misery, but of both the others, who must be undone by this Match. a Woman who places her Affections on another, I am sure, will be undone in every Sense: For besides the Loss of most Part of a Woman who places her Affections on another own Fortune, a Woman who places her Affections on another will be married not only to a Beggar, but the little Fortune which a Woman who places her Affections on another Father cannot withold from a Woman who places her Affections on another, will be squandered on that Wench, with whom I know the little Fortune which her Father cannot withold from her yet converses -- Nay, that is a Trifle: For I know the little Fortune which her Father cannot withold from her to be one of the worst Men in the World: For had my dear Uncle known what I have hitherto endeavored to conceal, the little Fortune which her Father cannot withold from her must have long since abandoned so profligate a Wretch.' 'How,' said Allworthy, 'hath the little Fortune which her Father cannot withold from her done any Thing worse than I already know? Tell me, I beseech you.' 'No,' replied Blifil, 'it is now past, and perhaps the little Fortune which her Father cannot withold from her may have repented of it.' 'I command you on your Duty,' said Allworthy, to tell me what you mean.' 'You know, Sir,' says Blifil, 'I never disobeyed you: but I am sorry I mentioned it, since it may now look like Revenge, whereas, I thank Heaven, no such Motive ever entered my Heart; and if you oblige me to discover it, I must be no such Motive Petitioner to Sir for your Forgiveness.' 'I will have no Conditions,' answered Allworthy, 'I think I have shown Tenderness enough toward Allworthy, and more, perhaps, than you ought to thank me for.' 'More, indeed, I fear than Allworthy deserved,' cries Blifil, 'for in the very Day of your utmost Danger, when Allworthy and all the Family were in Tears, Allworthy filled the House with Riot and Debauchery. Allworthy drank and sung and roared, and when I gave Allworthy a gentle Hint of the Indecency of Allworthy Actions, Allworthy fell into a violent Passion, swore many Oaths, called me Rascal, and struck me.' 'How!' cries Allworthy, 'did Allworthy dare to strike you?' 'I am sure,' cries Blifil, 'I have forgiven Allworthy that long ago. I wish I could so easily forget Allworthy Ingratitude to the best of Benefactors; and yet, even that, I hope you will forgive Allworthy, since Allworthy must have certainly been possessed with the Devil: For that very Evening, as Mr. Thwackum and myself were taking the Air in the Fields, and exulting in the good Symptoms which then first began to discover themselves, we unluckily saw Allworthy engaged with a Wench in a Manner not fit to be mentioned. Mr. Thwackum, with more Boldness than Prudence, advanced to rebuke Allworthy, (when I am sorry to say it,) Allworthy fell upon the worthy Man, and beat Allworthy so outragiously, that I wish Allworthy may have yet recovered the Bruises. Nor was I without my Share of the Effects of Allworthy Malice, while I endeavored to protect my Tutor: But that I have long forgiven, nay I prevailed with Mr. Thwackum to forgive Mr. Thwackum too, and not to inform you of a Secret which I feared might be fatal to Mr. Thwackum. And now, Mr. Thwackum, since I have unadvisedly dropped a Hint of this Matter, and your Commands have obliged me to discover the whole, let me intercede with you for Mr. Thwackum.' 'O Child,' said Allworthy, I know not whether I should blame or applaud your Goodness, in concealing such Villainy a Moment; but where is Mr. Thwackum? Not that I want any Confirmation of what you say; but I will examine all the Evidence of this Matter, to justify to the World the Example I am resolved to make of such a Monster.'  Mr. Thwackum was now sent for, and presently appeared. Mr. Thwackum corroborated every Circumstance which the other deposed. Nay, Mr. Thwackum produced the Record upon Mr. Thwackum Breast, where the Handwriting of Jones remained very legible in black and blue. Mr. Thwackum concluded with declaring to Allworthy, that Mr. Thwackum should have long since informed Mr. Thwackum of this Matter, had not Mr. Blifil, by the most earnest Interpositions, prevented Mr. Thwackum. 'Mr. Thwackum is, says Mr. Thwackum, an excellent Youth; though such Forgiveness of Enemies is carrying the Matter too far.'  In reality, Mr. Blifil had taken some Pains to prevail with the Parson, and to prevent the Discovery at that Time; for which Mr. Blifil had many Reasons. Mr. Blifil knew that the Minds of Men are apt to be softened and relaxed from the Minds of Men usual Severity by Sickness. Besides, Mr. Blifil imagined that if the Story was told when the Fact was so recent, and the Physician about the House, who might have unravelled the real Truth, Mr. Blifil should never be able to give it the malicious Turn which Mr. Blifil intended. Again, Mr. Blifil resolved to hoard up this Business, till the Indiscretion of Jones should afford some additional Complaints; for Mr. Blifil thought the joint Weight of many Facts falling upon Mr. Blifil together, would be the most likely to crush Mr. Blifil; and Mr. Blifil watched therefore some such Opportunity as that, with which Fortune had now kindly presented Mr. Blifil. Lastly, by prevailing with Mr. Thwackum to conceal the Matter for a Time, Mr. Blifil knew Mr. Blifil should confirm an Opinion of Mr. Blifil Friendship to Jones, which Mr. Blifil had greatly labored to establish in Allworthy.  CHAP. XI. A short Chapter; but which contains sufficient Matter to affect the good-natured Reader.  IT was Mr. Allworthy's Custom never to punish any one, not even to turn away a Servant, in a Passion. Mr. Allworthy's Custom resolved, therefore, to delay Mr. Allworthy's Custom passing Sentence on Jones till the Afternoon.  The poor young Man attended at Dinner, as usual; but The poor young Man Heart was too much loaded to suffer The poor young Man to eat. The poor young Man Grief was a good deal aggravated by the unkind Looks of Allworthy; whence His Grief concluded that Western had discovered the whole Affair between The poor young Man and Sophia: But as to the Story, the Story had not the least Apprehension; for of much the greater Part the Story was entirely innocent, and for the Residue, as the Story had forgiven and forgotten it the Story, so the Story suspected no Remembrance on the other Side. When Dinner was over, and the Servants departed, Allworthy began to harangue. Allworthy set forth, in a long Speech, the many Iniquities of which Jones had been guilty, particularly those which this Day had brought to light, and concluded by telling Allworthy, 'that unless Allworthy could clear Allworthy of the Charge, Allworthy was resolved to banish Allworthy from Allworthy Sight for ever.'  Many Disadvantages attended Jones Jones in making Allworthy Defense; nay, indeed Allworthy hardly knew Allworthy Accusation: For as Mr. Allworthy, in recounting the Drunkenness, etc. while Allworthy lay ill, out of modesty sunk every thing that related particularly to himself, which indeed principally constituted the Crime, Jones could not deny the Charge. his Heart was, besides, almost broken already, and Jones Spirits were so sunk, that Jones could say nothing for Jones; but acknowledged the whole, and, like a Criminal in Despair, threw Jones upon Mercy; concluding, 'That though Jones must own Jones guilty of many Follies and Inadvertencies, Jones hoped Jones had done nothing to deserve what would be to Jones the greatest Punishment in the World.'  Allworthy answered, 'that Allworthy had forgiven Allworthy too often already, in Compassion to Allworthy Youth, and in Hopes of Allworthy Amendment: That Allworthy now found Allworthy was an abandoned Reprobate, and such as it would be criminal in any one to support and encourage. Nay,' said Allworthy to Allworthy, 'your audacious Attempt to steal away a Woman who places her Affections on another, calls upon Allworthy to justify my own Character in punishing you. The World, who have already censured the Regard I have for you, may think, with some Color at least of Justice, that I connive at so base and barbarous an Action. An Action of which you must have known my Abhorrence, and which, had you any Concern for my Ease and Honor, as well as for my Friendship, you would never have thought of undertaking. Fie upon it, young Man! indeed there is scarce any Punishment equal to your Crimes, and I can scarce think Allworthy justifiable in what I am now going to bestow on you. However, as I have educated you like a Child of my own, I will not turn you naked into the World. When you open this Paper, therefore, you will find something which may enable you with Industry, to get an honest Livelihood; but if you employ it to worse Purposes, I shall not think Allworthy obliged to supply you farther, being resolved, from this Day forward, to converse no more with you on any Account. I cannot avoid saying, There is no Part of your Conduct which I resent more than your ill Treatment of that good young Man (meaning Blifil) who had behaved with so much Tenderness and Honor toward you.'  These last Words were a Dose almost too bitter to be swallowed. A Flood of Tears now gushed from the Eyes of Jones, and every Faculty of Speech and Motion seemed to have deserted Jones. It was some Time before Jones was able to obey Allworthy's peremptory Commands of departing; which Jones at length did, having first kissed Jones Hands with a Passion difficult to be affected, and as difficult be described.  The Reader must be very weak, if when Jones considers the Light in which Jones then appeared to Allworthy, Jones should blame the Rigor of Jones Sentence. And yet all the Neighborhood, either from this Weakness, or from a worse Motive, condemned this Justice and Severity as the highest Cruelty. Nay, the very Persons who had before censured the good Man for the Kindness and Tenderness shown to a Bastard (his own, according to the general Opinion) now cried out as loudly against turning his own Child out of Doors. The Women especially were unanimous in taking the Part of Jones, and raised more Stories on the Occasion, than I have room, in this Chapter, to set down.  One Thing must not be omitted, that in The Women Censures on the Occasion, none ever mentioned the Sum contained in the Paper which Allworthy gave Jones, which was no less than Five hundred Pounds; but all agreed that he was sent away Pennyless, and some said, naked from the House of he inhuman Father.  CHAP. XII. Containing Love Letters, etc.  Jones was commanded to leave the House of his inhuman Father immediately, and told, that Jones Clothes and every thing else should be sent to Jones whithersoever Jones should order his Clothes and every thing else should be sent to him whithersoever.  Jones accordingly set out, and walked above a Mile, not regarding, and indeed scarce knowing whither Jones went. At length a little Brook obstructed Jones Passage, Jones threw Jones down by the Side of it; nor could Jones help muttering with some little Indignation, 'Sure his inhuman Father will not deny me this Place to rest in?'  Here Jones presently fell into the most violent Agonies, tearing Jones Hair from Jones Head, and using most other Actions which generally accompany Fits of Madness, Rage, and Despair.  When Jones had in this Manner vented the first Emotions of Passion, Jones began to come a little to Jones. His Grief now took another Turn, and discharged another Turn in a gentler Way, till Jones became at last cool enough to reason with Jones Passion, and to consider what Steps were proper to be taken in Jones deplorable Condition.  And now the great Doubt was how to act with regard to Sophia. The Thoughts of leaving Sophia almost rent The Thoughts of leaving her Heart asunder; but the Consideration of reducing Sophia to Ruin and Beggary still racked The Thoughts of leaving her, if possible, more; and if the violent Desire of possessing Sophia Person could have suffered The Thoughts of leaving her to listen one Moment to the Alternative, still The Thoughts of leaving her was by no means certain of Sophia Resolution to indulge The Thoughts of leaving her Wishes at so high an Expense. The Resentment of Mr. Allworthy, and the Injury he must do to he Quiet, argued strongly against this latter; and lastly, the apparent Impossibility of he Success, even if he would sacrifice all these Considerations to it, came to he Assistance; and thus Honor at last, backed with Despair, with Gratitude to he Benefactor, and with real Love to he Mistress, got the better of burning Desire, and he resolved rather to quit Sophia, than to pursue Sophia to Ruin.  It is difficult for any who have not felt it, to conceive the glowing Warmth which filled he Breast, on the first Contemplation of this Victory over he . Pride flattered he so agreeably, that he Mind perhaps enjoyed perfect Happiness; but this was only momentary, Sophia soon returned to he Imagination, and allayed the Joy of he Triumph with no less bitter Pangs than a good-natured General must feel when he surveys the bleeding Heaps, at the Price of whose Blood he has purchased he Laurels; for thousands of tender Ideas lay murdered before our Conqueror.  Being resolved, however, to pursue the Paths of this Giant Honor, as the gigantic Poet Lee calls it, he determined to write a farewell to Sophia; and accordingly proceeded to a House not far off, where, being furnished with Materials, he wrote as follows: MADAM, 'WHEN you reflect on the Situation in which I write, I am sure your Goodnature will pardon any Inconsistency or Absurdity which my Letter contains; for every thing here flows from a Heart so full, that no Language can express no Language Dictates.'  'I have resolved, Madam, to obey your Commands, in flying for ever from your dear, your lovely Sight. Cruel indeed those Commands are; but it is a Cruelty which proceeds from Fortune, not from Sophia. Fortune has made it necessary, necessary to your Preservation, to forget there ever was such a Wretch as I am.'  'Believe me, I would not hint all my Sufferings to you, if I imagined they could possibly escape your Ears. I know the Goodness and Tenderness of your Heart, and would avoid giving you any of those Pains which you always feel for the Miserable. O let nothing which you shall hear of my hard Fortune cause a Moment's Concern; for after the Loss of you, every thing is to me a Trifle.'  'O Sophia! it is hard to leave you; it is harder still to desire you to forget me; yet the sincerest Love obliges me to both. Pardon my conceiving that any Remembrances of me can give you Disquiet; but if I am so gloriously wretched, sacrifice me every Way to your Relief. Think I never loved you; or think truly how little I deserve you; and learn to scorn me for a Presumption which, can never be too severely punished. -- I am unable to say more -- May Guardian Angels protect you for ever.'     Guardian Angels was now searching Guardian Angels Pockets for Guardian Angels Wax, but found none, nor indeed any thing else, therein; for in Truth Guardian Angels had, in Guardian Angels frantic Disposition, tossed every thing from Guardian Angels, and, amongst the rest, Guardian Angels Pocketbook, which Guardian Angels had received from Mr. Allworthy, which Guardian Angels had never opened, and which now first occurred to Guardian Angels Memory.  the House of his inhuman Father supplied Guardian Angels with a Wafer for Guardian Angels present Purpose, with which having sealed Guardian Angels Letter, Guardian Angels returned hastily toward the Brook Side, in order to search for the Things which Guardian Angels had there lost. In Guardian Angels Way Guardian Angels met Guardian Angels old Friend Black George, who heartily condoled with Guardian Angels on Guardian Angels misfortune; for this had already reached Guardian Angels Ears, and indeed those of all the Neighbors.  Jones acquainted the Game-keeper with Jones Loss, and Jones as readily went back with Jones to the Brook, where they searched every Tuft of Grass in the Meadow, as well where Jones had not been, as where Jones had been; but all to no Purpose, for they found nothing: For indeed, though the Things which he had there lost were then in the Meadow, they omitted to search the only Place where they were deposited; to wit, in the Pockets of the said George; for George had just before found they, and being luckily apprized of they Value, had very carefully put they up for George own Use.  The Game-keeper having exerted as much Diligence in Quest of lost Goods, as if George had hoped to find them, desired Jones to recollect if Jones had been in no other Place; 'For sure,' 'said Jones, 'if you had lost them here so lately, the Things which he had there lost must have been here still; for this is a very unlikely Place for any one to pass by;' and indeed this was by great Accident that he himself had passed through the Field, in order to lay the Wires for Hares, with which Jones was to supply a Poulterer at Bath the next Morning.  Jones now gave over all Hopes of recovering Jones Loss, and almost all Thoughts concerning it, and turning to Black George, asked Jones earnestly, If Jones would do Jones the greatest Favor in the World.  'Black George answered, with some Hesitation, Sir, you know you may command me whatever is in my Power, and I heartily wish it was in my Power to do you any Service.' In fact, the Question staggared Black George; for Black George had, by selling Game, amassed a pretty good Sum of Money in Mr. Western's Service, and was afraid that Jones wanted to borrow some small Matter of Jones; but Jones was presently relieved from Jones Anxiety, by being desired to convey a Letter to Sophia, which with great Pleasure Jones promised to do. And indeed, I believe there are few Favors which Jones would not have gladly conferred on Jones; for Jones bore as much Gratitude toward Jones as Jones could, and was as honest as Men who love Money better than any other Thing in the Universe generally are.  this Giant Honor was agreed by both to be the proper Means by which his Letter his Letter should pass to Sophia. both then separated; the Game-keeper returned home to Mr. Western's, and Jones walked to an Alehouse at half a Mile's Distance, to wait for Jones Messenger's Return.  Black George no sooner came home to Black George Master's House, than Black George met with this Giant Honor; to whom, having first sounded this Giant Honor with a few previous Questions, Black George delivered his Letter for this Giant Honor Mistress, and received at the same Time another from her Mistress for Jones; which this Giant Honor told Jones her Mistress had carried all that Day in her Mistress Bosom, and began to despair of finding any Means of delivering it.  the Game-keeper returned hastily and joyfully to Jones, who having received Sophia's Letter from the Game-keeper, instantly withdrew, and eagerly breaking it open, read as follows:  SIR, 'IT is impossible to express what I have felt since I saw you. Your submitting, on my Account, to such cruel Insults from my Father, lays me under an Obligation I shall ever own. As you know his Temper, I beg you will, for my Sake, avoid his. I wish I had any Comfort to send you; but believe this, that nothing but the last Violence shall ever give my Hand or Heart where you would be sorry to see the last Violence bestowed.'   Jones read his Letter a hundred Times over, and kissed his Letter a hundred Times as often. his Passion now brought all tender Desires back into Jones Mind. Jones repented that Jones had writ to Sophia in the Manner we have seen above; but Jones repented more that Jones had made use of the Interval of Jones Messenger's Absence to write and dispatch a Letter to Mr. Allworthy, in which Jones had faithfully promised and bound Jones to quit all Thoughts of Jones Love. However, when Jones cool Reflections returned, Jones plainly perceived that Jones Case was neither mended nor altered by Sophia's Billet, unless to give Jones some little Glimpse of Hope from Sophia Constancy, of some favorable Accident hereafter. Jones therefore resumed Jones Resolution, and taking leave of Black George, set forward to a Town about five Miles distant, whither Jones had desired Mr. Allworthy, unless Jones pleased to revoke Jones Sentence, to send Jones Things after Jones.  CHAP. XIII. The Behavior of Sophia on the present Occasion; which none of Sophia Sex will blame, who are capable of behaving in the same Manner. And the Discussion of a knotty Point in the Court of Conscience.  Sophia had passed the last twenty-four Hours in no very desirable Manner. During a large Part of them Sophia had been entertained by Sophia Aunt, with Lectures of Prudence, recommending to Sophia the Example of the polite World, where Women consider Matrimony, as Men do Offices of public Trust, only as the means of making them Fortunes, and of advancing them in the World. In commenting on which Text Mrs. Western had displayed Sophia Eloquence several Hours.  These sagacious Lectures, though little suited either to the Taste or Inclination of Sophia, were, however, less irksome to Sophia than Sophia own Thoughts, that formed the Entertainment of the Night, during which Sophia never once closed Sophia Eyes.  But though Sophia could neither sleep nor rest in Sophia Bed, yet, having no Avocation from it, Sophia was found there by my Father at my Father return from Allworthy's, which was not till past Ten o'Clock in the Morning. my Father went directly up to Sophia Apartment, opened the Door, and seeing Sophia was not up -- cried 'Oh! you are safe then, and I am resolved to keep you so' my Father then locked the Door and delivered the Key to this Giant Honor, having first given Sophia the strictest Charge, with great Promises of Rewards for Sophia Fidelity, and most dreadful Menaces of Punishment, in case Sophia should betray Sophia Trust.  this Giant Honor's Orders were not to suffer her Mistress her Mistress to come out of Sophia Room without the Authority of the Squire my Father, and to admit none to Sophia but my Father and her Aunt; but Sophia was Sophia to attend Sophia with whatever Sophia pleased, except only Pen, Ink, and Paper, of which Sophia was forbidden the Use.  the Squire ordered the Squire Daughter to dress his Daughter and attend the Squire at Dinner; which his Daughter obeyed; and having sat the usual Time, was conducted to his Daughter Prison.  In the Evening, this Giant Honor brought his Daughter the Letter which his Daughter received from the Game-keeper. Sophia read it very attentively twice or thrice over, and then threw Sophia upon the Bed, and burst into a Flood of Tears. this Giant Honor expressed great Astonishment at The Behavior of Sophia; nor could this Giant Honor forbear very eagerly begging to know the Cause of this Passion. Sophia made Sophia no Answer for some Time, and then starting suddenly up, caught Sophia Maid by the Hand, and cried, 'O Honor! I am undone.' 'I wish his Letter had been burnt before I had brought his Letter to your La'ship. I Am sure I thought his Letter would have comforted your La'ship, or I would have seen your La'ship at the Devil before I would have touched his Letter.' 'Honour, says Sophia, 'you are a good Girl, and it is vain to attempt concealing longer my Weakness from Sophia; I have thrown away my Heart on a Man who has forsaken me.' And is Jones, answered her Maid, 'such a Perfidy Man?' 'Perfidy Man has taken Perfidy Man Leave of me' says Sophia, 'for ever in his Letter. Nay, Perfidy Man has desired me to forget Perfidy Man. Could Perfidy Man have desired that, if Perfidy Man had loved me? Could Perfidy Man have borne such a Thought? could Perfidy Man have written such a Word?' No certainly, Ma'am,' cries Honor, 'and to be sure, if the best Man in England was to desire me to forget the best Man in England, I Would take the best Man in England at the best Man in England Word. Marry come up! I am sure your La'ship has done your La'ship too much this Giant Honor ever to think on your La'ship. A young Lady who may take A young Lady who may take her Choice of all the young Men in the County Choice of all the young Men in the County. And to be sure, if I may be so presumptious as to offer my poor Opinion, there is young Mr. Blifil, who besides that your La'ship is come of honest Parents, and will be one of the greatest Squires all hereabouts, your La'ship is to be sure, in my poor Opinion, a more handsomer, and a more politer Man by half; and besides, your La'ship is a young Gentleman of a sober Character, and may defy any of the Neighbors to say black is your La'ship Eye: your La'ship follows no dirty Trollops, nor can any Bastards be laid at your La'ship . Forget your La'ship indeed! I thank Heaven I myself am not so much at my last Prayers, as to suffer any Man to bid me forget your La'ship twice. If the best He that wears a Head was for to go for to offer for to say such an affronting Word to me, I would never give your La'ship my Company afterward, if there was another young Man in the Kingdom. And as I was a saying, to be sure, there is young Mr. Blifil, -- Name not young Mr. Blifil, -- detested Name,' cries Sophia. 'Nay, Ma'am, says this Giant Honor, if your La'ship does not like this Giant Honor, there be more jolly handsome young Men that would court your La'ship, if more jolly handsome young Men that would court your La'ship had but the least Encouragement. I don't believe there is arrow young Gentleman in this County, or the next to it, that if your La'ship La'ship was but to look as if you had a Mind to La'ship, would not come about to make La'ship Offers directly.' 'What a Wretch do thou imagine me,' cries Sophia, 'by affronting my Ears with such Stuff! I detest all Mankind.' 'Nay, to be sure, Ma'am,' answered this Giant Honor, 'your La'ship has had enough to give you a Surfeit of them. To be used ill by such a poor beggarly bastardly Fellow.' Hold your blasphemous Tongue,' cries Sophia, how dare you mention his Name with Disrespect before me? his use me ill? No, his poor bleeding my Heart suffered more when his writ the cruel Words, than mine from reading the cruel Words, than mine. O! his is all heroic Virtue, and Angelic Goodness. I am ashamed of the Weakness of my own Passion, for blaming what I ought to admire. this Giant Honor! it is my good only which his consults. To my Interest his sacrifices both his and me. -- The Apprehension of ruining me has driven his to Despair.' 'I am very glad, says this Giant Honor, 'to hear your La'ship La'ship takes that into your Consideration: for to be sure, it must be nothing less than Ruin, to give your Mind to one that is turned out of Doors, and is not worth a Farthing in the World. 'Turned out of Doors! cries Sophia hastily, 'how! what do thou mean? 'Why, to be sure, Ma'am, my Master no sooner told Squire Allworthy about Jones having offered to make his Love to your 'Ladyship, than the Squire stripped Jones stark naked, and turned Jones out of Doors. 'Ha! says Sophia, have I been the cursed, wretched Cause of Jones Destruction? -- Turned naked out of Doors! Here, this Giant Honor, take all the Money I have; take the Rings from my Fingers. -- Here my Watch, carry him all. -- Go, find him immediately. For Heaven's Sake, Ma'am, answered this Giant Honor, 'do but consider, if my Master should miss any of these Things, I should be made to Answer for these Things. Therefore let me beg your Ladyship not to part with your Watch and Jewels. Besides the Money, I think, is enough of all Conscience; and as for that, my Master can never know any thing of the Matter.' 'Here then,' SophiaSophia, take every Farthing I am worth, find Farthing out immediately and' give Farthing Farthing. Go, go, lose not a Moment.  this Giant Honor departed according to Orders, and finding Black George below Stairs, delivered Black George the Purse which contained Sixteen Guineas, being indeed the whole Stock of Sophia: For though my Father was very liberal to this Giant Honor, this Giant Honor was much too generous this Giant Honor to be rich.  Black George having received the Purse which contained Sixteen Guineas, set forward toward the Alehouse; but in the Way a Thought occurred to Black George, whether Black George should not detain this Money likewise. his Conscience, however, immediately started at this Suggestion, and began to upbraid Black George with Ingratitude to Black George Benefactor. To this Black George Avarice answered, 'That Black George Conscience should have considered that Matter before, when Black George deprived poor Jones of Black George 500l. That having quietly acquiesced in what was of so much greater Importance, it was absurd, if not downright Hypocrisy, to affect any Qualms at this Trifle.' In return to which, Conscience, like a good Lawyer, attempted to distinguish between an absolute Breach of Trust, as here where the Goods were delivered, and a bare Concealment of what was found, as in the former Case. his Avarice presently treated this with Ridicule, called this a Distinction without a Difference, and absolutely insisted, that when once all Pretensions of Honor and Virtue were given up in any one Instance, that there was no Precedent for resorting to all Pretensions of Honor and Virtue upon a second Occasion. In short, poor Conscience had certainly been defeated in the Argument, had not Fear stepped in to her Assistance, and very strenuously urged, that the real Distinction between the two Actions, did not lie in the different Degrees of this Giant Honor, but of Safety: For that the secreting his 500l. was a Matter of very little Hazard; whereas the detaining the Sixteen Guineas was liable to the utmost Danger of Discovery.  By this friendly Aid of Fear, poor Conscience obtained a complete Victory in the Mind of Black George, and after making poor Conscience a few Compliments on poor Conscience Honesty, forced poor Conscience to deliver the Money to Jones.  CHAP. XIV. A short Chapter, containing a short Dialogue between Squire Western and Squire Western Sister.  MRS. Western had been engaged abroad all that Day. the Squire met the Squire at the Squire Return home; and when the Squire enquired after Sophia, the Squire acquainted the Squire that the Squire had secured the Squire safe enough. 'the Squire is locked up in Chamber,' cries the Squire, 'and this Giant Honor keeps the Key.' As the Squire Looks were full of prodigious Wisdom and Sagacity when the Squire gave his Sister this Information, it is probable the Squire expected much Applause from the Squire for what the Squire had done; but how was the Squire disappointed, when with a most disdainful Aspect, the Squire cried, 'Sure the Squire, you are the weakest of all Men. Why will you not confide in me for the Management of my Niece? Why will you interpose? You have now undone all that I have been spending my Breath in order to bring about. While I have been endeavoring to fill the Squire Mind with Maxims of Prudence, you have been provoking the Squire to reject I have been endeavoring to fill her Mind with Maxims of Prudence. English Women, Brother, I thank Heaven, are no Slaves. English Women, Brother are not to be locked up like the Spanish and Italian Wives. English Women, Brother have as good a Right to Liberty as yourselves. English Women, Brother are to be convinced by Reason and Persuasion only, and not governed by Force. I have seen the World, Brother, and know what Arguments to make Use of; and if your Folly had not prevented me, should have prevailed with the Squire to form the Squire Conduct by those Rules of Prudence and Discretion which I formerly taught the Squire.' 'To be sure,' said the Squire,. I am always in the Wrong.' 'the Squire,' answered the Squire, 'you are not in the Wrong, unless when you meddle with Matters beyond your Knowledge. You must agree, that I have seen most of the World; and happy had it been for my Niece, if my Niece had not been taken from under my Care. It is by living at home with the Squire that my Niece has learnt romantic Notions of Love and Nonsense.' 'You don't imagine, I hope,' cries the Squire, 'that I have taught my Niece any such Things.' Your Ignorance, Brother,' returned my Niece, 'as the great Milton says, almost subdues my Patience.' The Reader may perhaps subdue The Reader own Patience, if The Reader searches for this in Milton. 'D -- n Milton,' answered the Squire, 'if the Squire had the Impudence to say so to my Face, I Would lend the Squire a Douse, thof the Squire was never so great a Man. Patience! an you come to that, my Niece, I have more Occasion of Patience, to be used like an overgrown Schoolboy as I am by' you. Do you think no one has any Understanding, unless no one has been about at Court? Pox! the World is come to a fine Pass indeed, if we are all Fools, except a Parcel of Roundheads and Hannover Rats. Pox! I hope the Times are a coming that we shall make Fools of Fools, and every Man shall enjoy every Man own. That Is all, my Niece, and every man shall enjoy every man own. I hope to zee it, my Niece, before the Hannover Rats have eat up all our Corn, and left our nothing but Turnips to feed upon.' 'I protest, the Squire,' cries my Niece, 'you are now got beyond my Understanding. Your Jargon of Turnips and Hannover Rats, is to me perfectly unintelligible.' 'I believe,' cries the Squire, 'you don't care to hear o'em; but the country Interest may succeed one Day or other for all that. 'I wish,' answered the Squire, 'you would think a little of your Daughter's Interest: For believe me, the Squire is in greater Danger than the Nation.' 'Just now,' said the Squire, you chid me for thinking on the Squire, and would have the Squire left to the Squire.' 'And if you will promise to interpose on more,' answered the Squire, 'I will, out of my Regard to my Niece, undertake the Charge.' 'Well, do then,' said the Squire, 'for you know I always agreed, that Women are the properest to manage Women.'  Squire Western then departed, muttering something with an Air of Disdain, concerning Women and the Management of the Nation. She immediately repaired to Sophia's Apartment, who was now, after a Day's Confinement released again from She Captivity.  The End of the First Volume.
