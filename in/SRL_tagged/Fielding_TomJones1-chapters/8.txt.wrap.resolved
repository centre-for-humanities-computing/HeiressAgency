Farthing. Is all my Kindness vor'ur, and vondness o'ur come to this, to fall in Love without asking me Leave!' 'But you will not,' answered Mrs. Western, 'turn this Daughter, whom you love better than your own Soul, out of Doors, before you know whether you shall approve her Choice. Suppose her should have fixed on the very Person whom you yourself would wish, I'hope you would not be angry then.' 'No, no,' cries Western, 'that would make a Differrence. If her marries the Man I would have her, her may love whom her pleases, I shall not trouble my Head about that.' 'That is spoken,' answered her, 'like a sensible Man, but I believe the very Person, her has chosen, would be the very Person you would choose for her. I will disclaim all Knowledge of the World if it is not so; and I believe, Brother, you will allow I have some.' 'Why lookee, Sister,' said Western, 'I do believe you have as much as any Woman; and to be sure those are Women's Matters. You know I don't love to hear you talk about Politics, those belong to us, and Petticoats should not meddle: But come, Who is the Man?' 'Marry!' said Marry, 'you may find the Man out Marry, if you please. You who are so great a Politician can be at no great Loss. The Judgment which can penetrate into the Cabinets of Princes, and discover the secret Springs which move the great State Wheels in all the political Machines of Europe, must surely, with very little Difficulty find out what passes in the rude uninformed Mind of a Girl.' 'Sister,' cries the Squire, 'I have often warned you not to talk the Court Gibberish to the Squire. I tell you, I don't understand the Lingo; but I can read a Journal, or the London Evening Post. Perhaps indeed, there may be now and tan a Verse which I cannot make much of, because half the Letters are left out; yet I know very well what is meant by that, and that us Affairs don't go so well as they should do, because of Bribery and Corruption. I pity your Country Ignorance from my Heart,' cries the Lady, 'Do you?' answered Western, 'and I pity your Town Learning, I had rather be any Thing than a Courtier, and a Presbytcrian, and a Hanoverian too, as some People, I believe, are.' 'If you mean me,' answered the Lady, 'you know I am a Woman, Brother; and it signifies nothing what I am. Besides -- I do know you are a Woman,' cries the Squire, and the Squire well for thee, that at one; if had been a Man, I promise thee I had lent thee a Flick long ago.' 'Ay there,' said the Lady, 'in that a Flick lies all your fancied Superiority. Your Bodies, and not your Brains, are stronger than ours. Believe me, it is well for you that you are able to beat ours, or such is the Superiority of ours Understanding, ours should make all of you what the brave, and wise, and witty, and polite are already, -- ours Slaves.' I am glad I know your Mind,' answered the Squire, but ours'll talk more of this Matter another Time. At present, do tell me what Man it is you mean about my Daughter.' 'Hold a Moment,' said my Daughter, while I digest that sovereign Contempt I have for your Sex; or else I ought to be too angry with my Daughter. There -- I have made a Shift to gulp it down. And now, good politic Sir, what think you of Mr. Blifil? Did my Daughter not faint away on seeing Mr. Blifil lie breathless on the Ground? Did my Daughter not, after Mr. Blifil was recovered, turn pale again the Moment we came up to that Part of the Field where Mr. Blifil stood? And pray what else should be the Occasion of all my Daughter Melancholy that Night at Supper, the next Morning, and indeed ever since?' "Fore George!' cries the Squire, 'now you mind me on it, I remember it all. It is certainly so, and I am glad on it with all my Heart. I knew Sophy was a good my Daughter, and would not fall in Love to make me angry. I was never more rejoiced in my Life: For nothing can lie so handy together as our two Estates. I had this Matter in my Head some Time ago; for certainly our two Estates are in a Manner joined together in Matrimony already, and it would be a thousand Pities to part our two Estates. It is true indeed, there be larger Estates in the Kingdom, but not in this County, and I had rather bate something, than marry my Daughter among Stangers and Foreigners. Besides most of zuch great Estates be in the Hands of Lords, and I hate the very Name of themmun. Well but, Sister, what would you advise me to do: For I tell you Women know these Matters better than we do?' 'O, your humble Servant, Sir,' answered the Lady, 'we are obliged to the Lady for allowing we a Capacity in any Thing. Since you are pleased then, most politic Sir, to ask my Advice, I think you may propose the Match to Allworthy Sister. There is no Indecorum in the Proposal's coming from the Parent of either Side. King Alcinous, in Mr. Pope's Odyssey, offers King Alcinous Daughter to Ulysses. I need not caution so Politic a Person not to say that his Daughter his Daughter is in Love; that would indeed be against all Rules.' 'Well,' said the Squire,' 'I will propose the Squire; but I shall certainly lend un a Flick, if the Squire refuse me.' Fear not,' cries Mrs. Western, 'the Match is too advantageous to be refused.' 'I don't know that,' answered the Squire, 'Allworthy is a queer B -- ch, and Money has no Effect of un.' 'Brother,' said the Lady, your Politics astonish me. Are you really to be imposed on by Professions? Do you think Allworthy has more Contempt for Money than other Men, because Allworthy professes more. Such Credulity would better become one of us weak Women, than that wise Sex which Heaven has formed for Politicians. Indeed, Brother, you would make a fine Plenipo to negotiate with the French. They would soon persuade you, that They take Towns out of mere defensive Principles.' 'Sister,' answered the Squire, with much Scorn, Let your Friends at Court answer for the Towns taken; as you are a Woman, I shall lay no Blame upon Sister: For I suppose they are wiser than to trust Women with Secrets.' He accompanied this with so sarcastical a Laugh, that Mrs. Western could bear no longer. Mrs. Western had been all this Time fretted in a tender Part (for Mrs. Western was indeed very deeply skilled in these Matters, and very violent in them) and therefore burst forth in a Rage, declared Mrs. Western Brother to be both a Clown and a Blockhead, and that Mrs. Western would stay no longer in her Brother House.  the Squire, though perhaps, the Squire had never read Machiavel, was, however, in many Points, a perfect Politician. the Squire strongly held all those wise Tenets, which are so well inculcated in that Politico-Peripatetic School of Exchange-Alley. the Squire knew the just Value and only Use of Meney, viz. to lay it up. the Squire was likewise well skilled in the exact Value of Reversions, Expectations, etc. and had often considered the Amount of the Squire Sister's Fortune, and the Chance which the Squire or the Squire Posterity had of inheriting it. This the Squire was infinitely too wise to sacrifice to a trifling Resentment. When the Squire found, therefore, the Squire had carried Matters too far, the Squire began to think of reconciling them; which was no very difficult Task, as the Lady had great Affection for the Lady Brother, and still greater for the Lady Niece; and though too susceptible of an Affront offered to the Lady Skill in Politics, on which the Lady much valued the Lady, was a Woman of a very extraordinary good and sweet Disposition.  Having first, therefore, laid violent Hands on the Horses, for whose Escape from the Stable no Place but the Window was left open; the Squire next applied the Squire to his Sister, softened and soothed his Sister, by unsaying all the Squire had said, and by Assertions directly contrary to those which had incensed his Sister. Lastly, the Squire summoned the Eloquence of Sophia to the Squire Assistance, who, besides a most graceful and winning Address, had the Advantage of being heard with great Favor and Partiality by Sophia Aunt.  The Result of the whole was a kind Smile from Mrs. Western, who said, 'Brother, you are absolutely a perfect Croat: but as those have those Use in the Army of the Empress Queen, so you likewise have some good in Brother. I will therefore once more sign a Treaty of Peace with Brother, and see that you do not infringe it on your Side; at least, as you are so excellent a Politician, I may expect you will keep your Leagues like the French, till your Interest calls upon you to break the French.'  CHAP. III. Containing two Defiances to the Critics.  the Squire having settled Matters with his Sisterhis Sister, as we have seen in the last Chapter, was so greatly impatient to communicate the Proposal to Allworthy, that Mrs. Western had the utmost Difficulty to prevent the Squire from visiting that Gentleman in the Squire Sickness, for this Purpose.  Allworthy had been engaged to dine with Mrs. Western at the Time when Allworthy was taken ill. Allworthy was, therefore, no sooner discharged out of the Custody of Physic, but Allworthy thought (as was usual with Allworthy on all Occasions, both the highest and the lowest) of fulfilling Allworthy Engagement.  In the Interval between the Time of the Dialogue in the last Chapter, and this Day of public Entertainment, Sophia had, from certain obscure Hints thrown out by her Aunt, collected some Apprehensions that the Lady suspected Sophia Passion for Jones. Sophia now resolved to take this Opportunity of wiping out all such Suspicion, and for that Purpose to put an entire Constraint on Sophia Behavior.  First, Sophia endeavored to conceal a throbbing melancholy Heart with the utmost Sprightliness in Sophia Countenance, and the highest Gayety in Sophia Manner. Secondly, Sophia addressed Sophia whole Discourse to Mr. Blifil, and took not the least Notice of poor Jones the whole Day.  the Squire the Squire was so delighted with the Conduct of the Squire , that the Squire scarce eat any Dinner, and spent almost the Squire whole Time in watching Opportunities of conveying Signs of the Squire Approbation by Winks and Nods to his Sister; who was not at first altogether so pleased with what Sophia saw as was Sophia Brother.  In Sophia Sophia so greatly overacted Sophia Part, that her Aunt her Aunt was at first staggered, and began to suspect some Affectation in Sophia ; but as Sophia was Sophia a Woman of Great Art, so Sophia soon attributed this to extreme Art in Sophia. Sophia remembered the many Hints Sophia had given Sophia Neice concerning Sophia being in Love, and imagined the Lady had taken this Way to rally Sophia out of Sophia Opinion, by an overacted Civility; a Notion that was corroborated by the excessive Gaiety with which the whole was accompanied. We cannot here avoid remarking that this Conjecture would have been better founded, had Sophia lived ten Years in the Air of Grosvenor square, where young Ladies do learn a wonderful Knack of rallying and playing with that Passion, which is a mighty serious Thing in the Woods and Groves a hundred Miles Distant from London.  To say the Truth, in discovering the Deceit of others, it matters much that our own Art be wound up, if I may use the Expression, in the same Key with theirs: For very artful Men sometimes miscarry by fancying others wiser, or in other Words, greater Knaves than theirs really are. As this Observation is pretty deep, I will illustrate this Observation by the following short Story. Three Countrymen were pursuing a Wiltshire Thief through Brentford. The simplest of Three Countrymen seeing the Wiltshire House written under a Sign, advised his Companions to enter the Wiltshire House, for there most probably Three Countrymen would find Three Countrymen Countryman. The second, who was wiser, laughed at this Simplicity; but the third, who was wiser still, answered, 'Let us go in, however, for Countryman may think us should not suspect Countryman of going amongst Countryman .' Three Countrymen accordingly went in and searched the Wiltshire House, and by that Means missed overtaking the Thief, who was, at that Time, but a little ways before Three Countrymen; and who, as they all knew, but had never once reflected, could not read.  The Reader will pardon a Digression in which so invaluable a Secret is communicated, since every Gamester will agree how necessary it is to know exactly the Play of another, in order to countermine him. This will, moreover, afford a Reason why the wiser Man, as is often seen, is the Bubble of the weaker, and why many simple and innocent Characters are so generally misunderstood and misrepresented; but what is most material, this will account for the Deceit which Sophia put on her Aunt.  Dinner being ended, and the Company retired into the Garden, Mr. Western, who was thoroughly convinced of the certainty of what his Sister his Sister had told his, took Allworthy aside, and very bluntly proposed a Match between Sophia and young Mr. Blifil.  Allworthy was not one of those Men, whose Hearts flutter at any unexpected and sudden Tidings of worldly profit. Allworthy Mind was, indeed, tempered with that Philosophy which becomes a Man and a Christian. Allworthy affected no absolute Superiority to all Pleasure and Pain, to all Joy and Grief; but was not at the same time to be discomposed and ruffled by every accidental Blast; by every Smile or Frown of Fortune. Allworthy received therefore, Mrs. Western's Proposal without any visible Emotion, or without any Alteration of Countenance. Allworthy said, the Alliance was such as Allworthy sincerely wished; then launched forth into a very just Encomium on the Lady's Merit; acknowledged the Offer to be advantageous in Point of Fortune; and after thanking Mrs. Western for the good Opinion Allworthy had professed of Allworthy Nephew, concluded, that if the young People liked each other, Allworthy should be very desirous to complete the Affair.  Western was a little disappointed at Allworthy's Answer; which was not so warm as Allworthy expected. Allworthy treated the Doubt whether the young People might like one another with great Contempt; saying, 'That Parents were the best Judges of proper Matches for Parents Children; that, for Allworthy Part, Allworthy should insist on the most resigned Obedience from Allworthy Daughter; and if any young Fellow could refuse such a Bedfellow, Fellow was Fellow humble Servant, and hoped there was no Harm done.'  Allworthy endeavored to soften this Resentment by many Elogium's on Sophia; declaring, Allworthy had no doubt but that Mr. Blifil would very gladly receive the Offer; but all was ineffectual, Allworthy could obtain no other Answer from the Squire but -- 'I say no more -- I humbly Hope there is no Harm done -- that is all.' Which Words Allworthy repeated, at least, a hundred Times before they parted.  Allworthy was too well acquainted with Allworthy Neighbor to be offended at this Behavior; and though Allworthy was so averse to the Rigor which some Parents exercise on some Parents Children in the Article of Marriage, that Allworthy had resolved never to force Allworthy Nephew's Inclinations, Allworthy was nevertheless much pleased with the prospect of this Union: For the whole Country resounded the Praises of Sophia, and Allworthy had Allworthy greatly admired the uncommon Endowments of both Neighbor Mind and Person. To which, I believe this Union may add, the Consideration of Neighbor vast Fortune, which, though Allworthy was too sober to be intoxicated with, Allworthy was too sensible to despise.  And here, in Defiance of all the barking Critics in the World, I must and will introduce a Digression concerning true Wisdom, of which Allworthy was in Reality as great a Pattern as Allworthy was of Goodness.  True Wisdom then, notwithstanding all which Mr. Hogarth's poor Poet may have writ against Riches, and in Spite of all which any rich, well-fed Divine may have preached against Pleasure, consists not in the contempt of either of these. A Man may have as much Wisdom in the Possession of an affluent Fortune, as any Beggar in the Streets; or may enjoy a handsome Wife or a hearty Friend, and still remain as wise as any sour Popish Recluse, who buries all his social Faculties, and starves his Belly while his well lashes his Back.  To say Truth, A Man is the likeliest to possess all worldly Blessings in an eminent Degree: For as that Moderation which Wisdom prescribes is the surest Way to useful Wealth; so can it alone qualify us to taste many Pleasures. A Man gratifies every Appetite and every Passion, while the Fool sacrifices all the rest to pall and satiate one.  It may be objected, that very wise Men have been notoriously avaricious. I answer, not in that Instance. It may likewise be said, that the wisest Men have been in the wisest Men Youth, immoderately fond of Pleasure. I answer the wisest Men were not wise then.  Wisdom in short, whose Lessons have been represented as so hard to learn by those who never were at her School, teaches us only to extend a simple Maxim universally known and followed even in the lowest Life, a little farther than that Life carries it. And this is not to buy at too dear a Price.  Now, whoever takes Maxim Maxim abroad with Maxim into the grand Market of the World, and constantly applies it to Honors, to Riches, to pleasures, and to every other Commodity which that Market affords, is, I will venture to affirm, a wise Man; and must be so acknowledged in the worldly Sense of the Word: For Maxim makes the best of Bargains, since in Reality Maxim purchases every Thing at the Price only of a little Trouble, and carries home all the good Things I have mentioned, while Maxim keeps Maxim Health, Maxim Innocence, and Maxim Reputation, the common Prices which are paid for his Health, his Innocence, and his Reputation, the common Prices which are paid for them by others, entire and to himself by others, entire and to Maxim.  From this Moderation, likewise, Maxim learns two other Lessons, which complete Maxim Character. First, never to be intoxicated when Maxim has made the best Bargain, nor dejected when the Market is empty, or when the Market Commodities are too dear for Maxim Purchase.  But I must remember on what Subject I am writing, and not trespass too far on the Patience of a good-natured Critic. Here therefore I put an End to the Chapter.  CHAP. IV. Containing sundry curious Matters.  AS soon as Allworthy returned home, Allworthy took Mr. Blifil apart, and after some Preface, communicated to Mr. Blifil the Proposal which had been made by Mr. Western, and, at the same Time, informed Mr. Blifil how agreeable this Match would be to Mr. Blifil.  The Charms of Sophia had not made the least Impression on Mr. Blifil; not that The Charms of Sophia Heart was pre-engaged; neither was The Charms of Sophia totally insensible of Beauty, or had any Aversion to Women; but The Charms of Sophia Appetites were, by Nature, so moderate, that The Charms of Sophia was easily able by Philosophy, or by Study, or by some other Method, to subdue some other Method; and as to that Passion which we have treated of in the first Chapter of this Book, The Charms of Sophia had not the least Tincture of the in The Charms of Sophia whole Composition.  But though The Charms of Sophia was so entirely free from that mixed Passion, of which we there treated, and of which the Virtues and Beauty of Sophia formed so notable an Object; yet was The Charms of Sophia altogether as well furnished with some other Passions, that promised some other Passions very full gratification in the young Lady's Fortune. Such were Avarice and Ambition, which divided the Dominion of The Charms of Sophia between some other Passions. The Charms of Sophia had more than once considered the Possession of the young Lady's Fortune as a very desirable Thing, and had entertained some distant Views concerning it: But The Charms of Sophia own Youth and that of the young Lady, and indeed principally a Reflection that Mr. Western might marry again, and have more Children, had restrained The Charms of Sophia from too hasty or eager a Pursuit.  This last and most material Objection was now in great Measure removed, as the Proposal came from Mr. Western himself. Blifil therefore after a very short Hesitation, answered Allworthy, that Matrimony was a Subject on which Allworthy had not yet thought: But that Allworthy was so sensible of Allworthy friendly and fatherly Care, that Allworthy should in all Things submit Allworthy to Allworthy Pleasure.  Allworthy was naturally a Man of Spirit, and Allworthy present Gravity arose from true Wisdom and Philosophy, not from any original Phlegm in Allworthy Disposition: For Allworthy had possessed much Fire in Allworthy Youth, and had married a beautiful Woman for Love. Allworthy was not, therefore, greatly pleased with this cold Answer of his Nephew; nor could Allworthy help launching forth into the Praises of Sophia, and expressing some Wonder that the Heart of a young Man could be impregnable to the force of such Charms, unless it was guarded by some prior Affection.  Mr. Blifil assured Allworthy Mr. Blifil had no such Guard; and then proceeded to discourse so wisely and religiously on Love and Marriage, that Mr. Blifil would have stopped the Mouth of a Parent much less devoutly inclined than was Mr. Blifil Uncle. In the End, A Man was satisfied, that A Man his Nephew, far from having any Objections to Sophia, had that Esteem for Sophia, which in sober and virtuous Minds is the sure Foundation of Friendship and Love. And as A Man doubted not but the Lover would, in a little Time, become altogether as agreeable to A Man Mistress, the Lover foresaw great Happiness arising to all Parties by so proper and desirable a this Union. With Mr. Blifil's Consent, therefore, Mr. Blifil wrote the next Morning to Mr. Western, acquainting Mr. Blifil that his Nephew his Nephew had very thankfully and gladly received the Proposal, and would be ready to wait on the young Lady, whenever the young Lady should be pleased to accept Mr. Blifil Visit.  Western was much pleased with this Letter, and immediately returned an Answer; in which, without having mentioned a Word to Word Daughter, Word appointed that very Afternoon for opening the Scene of Courtship.  As soon as Word had dispatched this Messenger, Word went in Quest of Word Sister, whom Word found reading and expounding the Gazette to Parson Supple. To this Exposition Word was obliged to attend near a Quarter of an Hour, though with great Violence to Word natural Impetuosity, before Word was suffered to speak. At length, however, Word found an Opportunity of acquainting the Lady, that Word had Business of great Consequence to impart to her; to which her answered, 'Brother, I am entirely at your Service. Things look so well in the North that I was never in a better Humor.'  The Parson then withdrawing, Western acquainted her with all which had passed, and desired her to communicate the Affair to Sophia, which her readily and cheerfully undertook; though perhaps her Brother was a little obliged to that agreeable Northern Aspect which had so delighted her, that her Brother heard no Comment on her Brother Proceedings: for they were certainly somewhat too hasty and violent.  CHAP. V. In which is related what passed between Sophia and Sophia Aunt.  Sophia was in Sophia Chamber reading when her Aunt came in. The Moment Sophia saw Mr. Western, Sophia shut this Book with so much Eagerness, that the young Lady could not forbear asking Sophia, What this Book that was which Sophia seemed so much afraid of showing. 'Upon my Word, Madam,' answered Sophia, 'it is this Book this Book which I am neither ashamed nor afraid to own I have read. It is the Production of a young Lady of Fashion, whose good Understanding, I think, does Honor to Sophia Sex, and whose good Heart is an Honor to Human Nature.' Mr. Western then took up this Book, and immediately after threw this Book down, saying -- 'Yes, the Author is of a very good Family; but the Author is not much among People one knows. I have never read it; for the best Judges say, there is not much in it.'' I dare not, the Author, set up my own Opinion, says Sophia, 'against the best Judges; but there appears to Sophia a great deal of human Nature it; and in many Parts, so much true Tenderness and Delicacy, that it has cost me many a Tear.' 'Ay, and do you love to cry then?' says her Aunther Aunt. 'I love a tender Sensation,' answered her Aunt, and would pay the Price of a Tear for it at any Time.' Well, but show me,' said her Aunther Aunt, 'what you was reading when I came in; there was something very tender in that, I believe, and very loving too.' You blush, Sophia. Ah! Sophia, you should read Books, which would teach you a little Hypocrisy, which would instruct you how to hide your Thoughts a little better.' 'I hope, the Author,' answered Sophia, 'I have no Thoughts which I ought to be ashamed of discovering.' 'Ashamed! no,' cries her Aunt, 'I don't think you have any Thoughts which you ought to be ashamed of, and yet, Sophia, you blushed just now when I mentioned the Word Loving. Dear Sophy, be assured you have not one Thought which I am not well acquainted with; as well, Sophia, as the French are with our Motions, long before our put them in Execution. Did you think, Sophia, because you have been able to impose upon your Father, that you could impose upon me? Do you imagine I did not know the Reason of your over-acting all that Friendship for Mr. Blifil yesterday? I have seen a little too much of the World, to be so deceived. Nay, nay, do not blush again. I tell you it is a Passion you need not be ashamed of. -- it is a Passion I myself approve, and have already brought your Father into the Approbation of. Indeed, I solely consider your Inclination; for I would always have that gratified, if possible, though one may sacrifice higher Prospects. Come, I have News which will delight your very Soul. Make me your Confident, and I will undertake you shall be happy to the very Extent of your Wishes.' 'La, Madam,' says Sophia, looking more foolishly than ever Sophia did in Sophia Life, 'I know not what to say -- Why, the Author, should you suspect?' -- 'Nay, no Dishonesty,' returned Mr. Western. 'Consider, you are speaking to one of your own Sex, to her Aunt, and I hope you are convinced you speak to a Friend. Consider, you are only revealing to me what I know already, and what I plainly saw yesterday, through that most artful of all Disguises, which you had put on, and which must have deceived any one who had not perfectly known the World. Lastly consider it is a Passion which I highly approve.' 'La, Madam,' says Sophia, 'you come upon one so unawares, and on a sudden. To be sure, the Author, I am not blind -- and certainly if it be a Fault to see all human Perfections assembled together -- But is it possible my Father and you, Madam, can see with my Eyes? I tell you,' answered her Aunther Aunt, 'we do entirely approve; and this very afternoon your Father has appointed for you to receive your Lover.' 'My Father, this Afternoon!' cries Sophia, with the Blood starting from Sophia Face. -- 'Yes, Sophia,' said her Aunt, 'this Afternoon. You know the Impetuosity of my Brother's Temper. I acquainted the Impetuosity of my Brother's Temper with the Passion which I first discovered in you that Evening when you fainted away in the Field. I saw that Evening in your Fainting. I saw that Evening immediately upon your Recovery. I saw that Evening that Evening at Supper, and the next Morning at Breakfast: (you know, Sophia, I have seen the World). Well, I no sooner acquainted my Brother; but my Brother immediately wanted to propose it to Allworthy. my Brother proposed it Yesterday, Allworthy consented, (as to be sure Allworthy must with Joy) and this Afternoon, I tell you, you are to put on all your best Airs.' this Afternoon!' cries Sophia. 'her Aunt, you frighten me out of my Senses.' 'O, my Dear,' said her Aunt, 'you will soon come to her Aunt again; for her Aunt is a charming young Fellow, that is the Truth on it.' 'Nay, I will own,' says Sophia, I know none with such Perfections. So brave, and yet so gentle; so witty, yet so inoffensive, so humane, so civil, so genteel, so handsome! What signifies his being base born, when compared with such Qualifications as these?' Base born! what do you mean,' said Mr. Jones!' Sophia turned instantly pale ^t this Name, and faintly repeated it. Upon which ^he her Aunt cried, 'Mr. Blifil, ay Mr. Blifil, of whom else have we been talking?' 'Good Heaven,' an^wered Sophia, ready to sink, 'of Mr. Jones, I thought; I am sure I know no other who deserves -- ' 'I protest,' cries her Aunt, 'you frighten me in your Turn. Is it Mr. Jones, and not Mr. Blifil, who is the Object of your Affection?' 'Mr. Blifil!' repeated Sophia. 'Sure it is impossible you can be in earnest; if you are, I am the most miserable Woman alive.' Mr. Western now stood a few Moments silent, while Sparks of fiery Rage flashed from Mr. Western Eyes. At length, collecting all Mr. Western Force of Voice, Mr. Western thundered forth in the following articulate Sounds:  'And is it possible you can think of disgracing your Family by allying yourself to a Bastard? Can the Blood of the Westerns submit to such Contamination! If you have not Sense sufficient to restrain such monstrous Inclinations, I thought the Pride of our Family would have prevented you from giving' the least Encouragement to so base an Affection; 'much less did I imagine you would ever have had the Assurance to own the Assurance to my Face.'  'the Author,' answered Sophia, trembling, 'what I have said you have extorted from me. I do not remember to have ever mentioned the Name of Mr. Jones, with Approbation, to any one before; nor should I now, had I not conceived Approbation had had your Approbation. Whatever were my Thoughts of that poor unhappy young Man, I intended to have carried them with me to my Grave -- To my Grave where now, I find, I am only to seek Repose.' -- Here Sophia sunk down in Sophia Chair, drowned in Sophia Tears, and, in all the moving Silence of unutterable Grief, presented a Spectacle which must have affected almost the hardest Heart.  All this tender Sorrow, however, raised no Compassion in her Aunt. On the contrary, Sophia now fell into the most violent fiery Rage -- 'And I would rather', Sophia cried, in a most vehement Voice, 'follow you to my Grave, than I would see you disgrace yourself and your Family by such a Match. O Heavens! could I have ever suspected that I should live to hear a Niece of mine declare a Passion for such a Fellow? You are the first -- yes, Mr. Western, you are the first of your Name who ever entertained so grovelling a Thought. A Family so noted' for the Prudence of A Family Women, -- Here A Family run on a full Quarter of an Hour, till having exhausted A Family Breath rather than A Family fiery Rage, A Family concluded with threatening to go immediately and acquaint A Family Brother.  Sophia then threw Sophia at Sophia Feet, and laying hold of Sophia Hands. 'begged Sophia, with her Tears, to conceal what Sophia had drawn from Sophia; urging the Violence of your Father's Temper, and protesting that no Inclinations of Sophia should ever prevail with Sophia to do any thing which might offend your Father.'  Mr. Western stood a Moment looking at Sophia, and then having recollected Sophia, said, that 'on one Consideration only Sophia would keep the Secret from Sophia Brother; and this was, that Sophia should promise to entertain Mr. Blifil that very Afternoon as Sophia Lover, and to regard Mr. Blifil as the Person who was to be Sophia Husband.'  Sophia was too much in her Aunt's Power to deny Sophia any thing positively; Sophia was obliged to promise that Sophia would see Mr. Blifil, and be as civil to Mr. Blifil as possible; but begged her Aunt that the Match might not be hurried on. Sophia said, 'Mr. Blifil was by no means agreeable to Sophia, and Sophia hoped your Father would be prevailed on not to make Sophia the most wretched of Women.'  Mr. Western assured Mr. Western, 'that the Match was entirely agreed upon, and that nothing could or should prevent the Match.' 'I must own,' said Sophia, 'I looked on the Match as on a Matter of Indifference; nay, perhaps, had some Scruples about it before, which were actually got over by my thinking it highly agreeable to your own Inclinations; but now I regard it as the most eligible Thing in the World; nor shall there be, if I can prevent it, a Moment of Time lost on the Occasion.'  Sophia replied, 'Delay at least, the Author, I may expect from both your Goodness and my Father's. Surely you will give me Time to endeavor to get the better of so strong a Disinclination as I have at present to this Person.'  her Aunt answered, 'her Aunt knew too much of the World to be so deceived; that as her Aunt was sensible another Man had her Aunt Affections, her Aunt would persuade Mr. Western to hasten the Match as much as possible. It would be bad Politics indeed, added her Aunt, to protract a Siege when the Enemy's Army is at Hand, and in Danger of relieving it. No, no, Sophy, said her Aunt, as I am convinced you have a violent Passion, which you can never satisfy with Honor, I will do all I can to put Honor Honor out of the Care of your Family: For when you are married those Matters will belong only to the Consideration of your Husband. I hope, Sophia, you will always have Prudence enough to act as becomes you; but if you should not, Marriage has saved many a Woman from Ruin.'  Sophia well understood what her Aunt menat; but did not think proper to make her Aunt an Answer. However, Sophia took a Resolution to see Mr. Blifil, and to behave to Mr. Blifil as civilly as Sophia could: For on that Condition only Sophia obtained a Promise from her Aunt her Aunt to keep secret the Liking which Sophia ill Fortune, rather than any Scheme of Mr. Western, had unhappily drawn from Sophia.  CHAP. VI. Containing a Dialogue between Sophia and Mrs. Honor, which may a little relieve those tender Affections which the foregoing Scene may have raised in the Mind of a good-natured Reader.  MRS. Western having obtained that Promise from MRS Niece which we have seen in the last Chapter, withdrew, and presently after arrived Mrs. Honor. MRS was at Work in a neighboring Apartment, and had been summoned to the Keyhole by some Vociferation in the preceding Dialogue, where MRS had continued during the remaining Part of the Keyhole. At MRS Entry into the Room, MRS found Sophia standing motionless, with her Tears trickling from her Eyesher Eyes. Upon which MRS immediately ordered a proper Quantity of her Tears into MRS her Eyes, and then began, 'O Gemini, my dear Lady, what is the Matter? Nothing,' cries Sophia. 'Nothing! dear Madam,' answers Mrs. Honor, 'you must not tell me that, when your Ladyship is in this Taking, and when there has been such a Preamble between your Ladyship and Madam Western.' 'Don't teaze me,' cries Sophia, 'I tell you nothing is the Matter. -- Good Heavens; Why was I born! -- Nay, the Author,' says Mrs. Honor, 'you shall never persuade me, that your La'ship can lament yourself so for nothing. To be sure, I am but a Servant; but to be sure I have been always faithful to your Ladyship, and to be sure I would serve your La'ship with my Life.' 'Mrs. Honor,' says Sophia it is not in thy Power to be of any Service to Mrs. Honor. I am irretrievably undone.' 'Heaven forbid,' answered the Waiting woman; 'but if I cannot be of any Service to the Waiting woman, pray tell me, the Author, it will be some Comfort to Mrs. Honor to know; Pray, dear Ma'am, tell me what is the Matter.' 'your Father,' cries Sophia, 'is going to marry me to this wicked Man I both despise and hate.' O, dear Ma'am,' answered the other, 'Who is this wicked Man? for to be sure this wicked Man is very bad, or your La'ship would not despise this wicked Man.' 'this wicked Man Name is Poison to my Tongue, replied Sophia,' 'thou wilt know it too soon.' Indeed, to confess the Truth, the Waiting woman knew it already, and therefore was not very inquisitive as to that Point. the Waiting woman then proceeded thus: 'I don't pretend to give your La'ship Advice, whereof your La'ship knows much better than I can pretend to, being but a Servant; but i-fackins! no Father in England should marry me against my Consent. And to be sure, the Squire is so good, that if the Squire did but know your La'ship La'ship despises and hates the young Man, to be sure the Squire would not desire you to marry the Squire. And if your La'ship your La'ship would but give me Leave to tell my Master so -- To be sure, it would be more properer to come from your own Mouth; but as your La'ship La'ship does not care to foul your Tongue with your Tongue nasty Name.' 'You are mistaken, Honor,' says Sophia, 'your Father was determined before your Father ever thought fit to mention it to your Father.' 'More Shame for your Father,' cries Honor, 'you are to go to Bed to your Father, and not Master. And thof a Man may be a very proper Man, yet every Woman may not think a Man handsome alike. I am sure my Master would never act in this Manner of my Master own Head. I wish some People would trouble some People only with what belongs to some People; some People would not, I believe, like to be served so, if it was some People own Case: For though I am a Maid, I can easily believe as how all Men are not equally agreeable. And what signifies your La'ship having so great a Fortune, if you cannot please yourself with this wicked Man you think most handsomest? Well, I say nothing, but to be sure it is Pity some Folks had not been better born; nay, as for that Matter, I should not mind it my self: But then there is not so much Money, and what of that, your La'ship has Money enough for both; and where can your La'ship your La'ship bestow your Fortune better? For to be sure every one must allow, that he is the most handsomest, charmingest, finest, tallest, properest Man in the World.' 'What do you mean by running on in this Manner to me?' cries Sophia, with a very grave Countenance. 'Have I ever given any Encouragement for these Liberties? Nay, Ma'am, I ask Pardon, I meant no Harm,' answered Sophia, 'but to be sure the poor Gentleman has run in his own Head ever since. I saw the poor Gentleman this Morning. -- To be sure, if your Ladyship had but seen the poor Gentleman just now, you must have pitied the poor Gentleman. GentlemanGentleman! I wishes some Misfortune has not happened to the poor Gentleman: For the poor Gentleman has been walking about with the poor Gentleman Arms across, and looking so melancholy all this Morning; I vow and protest his Arms made me almost cry to see the poor Gentleman.' 'To see whom? says Sophia. 'Poor Mr. Jones,' answered Honor. 'See the poor Gentleman! Why, where did you see the poor Gentleman?' cries Sophia. 'By the Canal, Ma'am,' says Honor. 'There the poor Gentleman has been walking all this Morning, and at last there the poor Gentleman laid the poor Gentleman down; I believe the poor Gentleman lies there still. To be sure, if it had not been for my Modesty, being a Maid as I am, I should have gone and spoke to the poor Gentleman. Do, Ma'am, let me go and see, only for a Fancy, whether the poor Gentleman is there still.'' 'Pugh!' says Sophia, 'There! no, no, what should the poor Gentleman do there? the poor Gentleman is gone before this Time to be sure. Besides, why -- what -- why should you go to see? -- Besides, I want you for something else. Go, fetch me my Hat and Gloves. I shall walk with my Aunt in the Grove before Dinner.' Honor did immediately as my Aunt was bid, and Sophia put Sophia Hat on; when looking in the Glass, Sophia fancied the Ribbon with which her Hat her Hat was tied, did not become Sophia, and so sent my Aunt back again for a Ribbon of a different Color; and then giving Mrs. Honor repeated Charges not to leave Mrs. Honor Work on any Account, as Mrs. Honor said it was in violent Haste, and must be finished that very Day, Mrs. Honor muttered something more about going to the Grove, and then sallied out the contrary Way, and walked as fast as Mrs. Honor tender trembling Limbs could carry Mrs. Honor, directly toward the Canal.  Poor Mr. Jones had been there, as Mrs. Honor had told Mrs. Honor: Poor Mr. Jones had indeed spent two Hours there that Morning in melancholy Contemplation on Poor Mr. Jones , and had gone out from the Garden at one Door, the Moment Mrs. Honor entered the Moment at another. So that those unlucky Minutes which had been spent in changing the Ribbons, had prevented the Lovers from Meeting at this Time. A most unfortunate Accident, from which my fair Readers will not fail to draw a very wholesome Lesson. And here I strictly forbid all May Critics to intermeddle with a Circumstance, which I have recounted only for the Sake of the Ladies, and upon whichthey only are at Liberty to comment.  CHAP. VII. A Picture of formal Courtship in Miniature, as it always ought to be drawn, and a Scene of a tenderer Kind, painted at full Length.  IT was well remarked by one, (and perhaps by more) that Misfortunes do not come single. This wise Maxim was now verified by Sophia, who was not only disappointed of seeing the Man she loved; but had the Vexation of being obliged to dress she out, in order to receive a Visit from the Man she hated.  That Afternoon, Mr. Western, for the first Time, acquainted Mr. Western Daughter with Mr. Western Intention; telling his Daughter, Mr. Western knew very well that his Daughter had heard his Intention before from his Daughter . Sophia looked very grave upon this, nor could Sophia prevent a few Pearls from stealing into her Eyesher Eyes. 'Come, come,' says Western, 'none of your Maidenish Airs; I know all; I assure you,' Sophia has told me all.'  'Is it possible,' says Sophia, 'that my Aunt can have betrayed me already?' 'Ay, ay,' says Western, betrayed you! ay. Why, you betrayed yourself yesterday at Dinner. You showed your Fancy very plainly, I think. But you young Girls never know what you would be at. So you cry because I am going to marry you to the Man you are in Love with! Your Mother, I remember, whimpered and whined just in the same Manner; but it was all over within twenty-four Hours after we were married: Mr. Blifil is a brisk young Man, and will soon put an End to your Squeamishness. Come, cheer up, cheer up, I expect un every Minute.'  Sophia was now convinced that her Aunt my Aunt had behaved honorably to Sophia; and Sophia determined to go through that disagreeable Afternoon with as much Resolution as possible, and without giving the least Suspicion in the World to Sophia Father.  Mr. Blifil soon arrived; and Mr. Western soon after withdrawing, left the young Couple together.  Here a long Silence of near a Quarter of an Hour ensued: For the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation had all that unbecoming Modesty which consists in Bashfulness. the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation often attempted to speak, and as often suppressed the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation Words just at the very Point of Utterance. At last out they broke in a Torrent of far-fetched and high-strained Compliments, which were answered, on her Side, by downcast Looks, half Bows and civil Monosyllables. Blifil from the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation Inexperience in the Ways of Women, and from the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation Conceit of the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation, took this Behavior for a modest Assent to the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation Courtship; and when to shorten a Scene which her could no longer support, Sophia rose up and left the Room, the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation imputed that too, merely to Bashfulness, and comforted the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation, that the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation should have enough of her Company.  the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation was indeed perfectly well satisfied with the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation prospect of Success: For as to that entire and absolute Possession of the Heart of the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation Mistress, which romantic Lovers require, the very Idea of it never entered the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation Head. her Fortune and Person were the sole Object of the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation Wishes, of which the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation made no Doubt soon to obtain the absolute Property; as Mr. Western's Mind was so earnestly bent on the Match; and as the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation well knew the strict Obedience which Sophia was always ready to pay to her Father's Will, and the greater still which her Father would exact, if there was Occasion. This Authority, therefore, together with the Charms which the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation fancied in the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation own Person and Conversation, could not fail, the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation thought, of succeeding with a young Lady, whose Inclinations, were, the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation doubted not, entirely disengaged.  Of Poor Mr. Jones the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation certainly had not even the least Jealousy; and I have often thought it wonderful that the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation had not. Perhaps the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation imagined the Character which Poor Mr. Jones bore all over the Country, (how justly let the Reader determine) of being one of the wildest Fellows in England, might render the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation odious to a Lady of the most exemplary Modesty. Perhaps the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation Suspicions might be laid asleep by the Behavior of Sophia, and of Poor Mr. Jones himself, when they were all in Company together. Lastly, and indeed principally, the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation was well assured there was not another Self in the Case. the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation fancied that the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation knew Poor Mr. Jones at the Bottom, and had in Reality a great Contempt for the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation Understanding, for not being more attached to the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation own Interest. the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation had no Apprehension that Poor Mr. Jones was in Love with Sophia; and as for any lucrative Motives, the Gentleman who was to begin the Conversation imagined they would sway very little with so silly a Fellow. Blifil, moreover, thought the Affair of Molly Seagrim still went on, and indeed believed the Affair of Molly Seagrim would end in Marriage: For Poor Mr. Jones really loved Poor Mr. Jones from Poor Mr. Jones Childhood, and kept no Secret from Poor Mr. Jones, till Poor Mr. Jones Behavior on the Sickness of Mr. Allworthy had entirely alienated Mr. Allworthy Heart; and it was by means of the Quarrel which had ensued on this Occasion, and which was not yet reconciled, that Mr. Blifil knew nothing of the Alteration which had happened in the Affection which Poor Mr. Jones had formerly bore toward Molly.  From these Reasons, therefore, Mr. Blifil saw no Far to Mr. Blifil Success with Sophia. Mr. Blifil concluded, his Behavior on the Sickness of Mr. Allworthy was like that of all other young Ladies on ^ first visit from a Lover, and it had indeed entirely answered Mr. Blifil Expectations.  Mr. Western took Care to way-lay the Lover at his Exit from his Mistress. his found his so elevated with his , so enamoured with his , and so satisfied with his Daughter Reception of his, that the old Gentleman began to caper and dance about his Hall, and by many other antic Actions, to express the Extravagance of his Joy: For his had not the least Command over any of his Passions; and that which had at any Time the Ascendant in his Mind, hurried his to the wildest Excesses.  As soon as Blifil was departed, which was not till after many hearty Kisses and embraces bestowed on his by Western, the good Squire went in Quest of Squire Daughter, whom the good Squire no sooner found than the good Squire poured forth the most Extravagant Raptures, bidding Kisses choose what Clothes and Jewels Kisses pleased; and declaring that the good Squire had no other Use for Fortune but to make Kisses happy. the good Squire then caressed Kisses again and again with the utmost Profusion of Fondness, called Kisses by the most endearing Names, and protested Kisses was the good Squire only Joy on Earth.  Sophia perceiving her Father in this Fit of Affection, which Sophia did not absolutely know the Reason of (for Fits of Fondness were not unusual to the good Squire, though this was rather more violent than ordinary) thought Sophia should never have a better Opportunity of disclosing Sophia than at present; as far at least, as regarded Mr. Blifil; and Sophia too well foresaw the Necessity which Sophia should soon be under of coming to a full Explanation. After having thanked the Squire, therefore for all Squire Professions of Kindness, Sophia added, with a Look full of inexpressible Softness, 'And is it possible my Papa can be so good to place all my Papa Joy in my Papa Sophy's Happiness?' which Western having confirmed by a great Oath, and a Kiss; Sophia then laid hold of my Papa Hand, and falling on Sophia Knees, after many warm and passionate Declarations of Affection and Duty, Sophia begged my Papa 'not to make Sophia the most miserable Creature on Earth, by forcing Sophia to marry a Man whom Sophia detested. This I entreat of you, dear Sir,' said Sophia, 'for your Sake as well as my own, since you are so very kind to tell me your Happiness depends on Sophia.' How! what!' says Western, staring wildly.' 'O Sir,' continued Sophia, 'not only your poor Sophy's Happiness; Sophia very Life, Sophia Being depends upon your granting Sophia Request. I cannot live with Mr. Blifil. To force me into this Marriage, would be killing me.' 'You cannot live with Mr. Blifil!' says Western. 'No, upon my Soul I cannot, answered Sophia. Then die and be d -- ned,' cries he, spurning Sophia from he. 'Oh! Sir,' cries Sophia, catching hold of the Skirt of he Coat, 'take Pity on he, I beseech you. Don't look and say such cruel -- Can you be unmoved while you see your Sophy in this dreadful Condition? Can the best of Father's break my Heart? Will he kill me by the most painful, cruel, lingering Death?' Pooh! Pooh!' cries the Squire, all Stuff and Nonsense, all Maidenish Tricks. Kill you indeed! Will this Marriage kill you?' -- 'Oh dear Sir,' answered Sophia, such a this Marriage is worse than Death -- such a Marriage is not even indifferent, I hate and detest such a Marriage. -- If you detest un never so much,' cries Western, 'you shall ha'un.' This such a Marriage bound by an Oath too shocking to repeat, and after many violent Asseverations, concluded in these Words. 'I am resolved upon the Match, and unless you consent to it, I will not give you a Groat, not a single Farthing; no, though I saw you expiring with Famine in the Street, I would not relieve you with a Morsel of Bread. This is my fixed Resolution, and so I leave you to consider on a Morsel of Bread.' such a Marriage then broke from her with such Violence, that her Face dashed against the Floor, and such a Marriage burst directly out of the Room, leaving poor Sophia prostrate on the Ground.  When Western came into his Hall, such a Marriage there found Poor Mr. Jones; who seeing such a Marriage Friend looking wild, and pale, and almost Breathless, could not forbear enquiring the Reason of all these melacholy Appearances. Upon which the good Squire immediately acquainted such a Marriage with the whole Matter, concluding with bitter denunciations against Sophia, and very pathetic Lamentations of the Misery of all Fathers who are so unfortunate to have Daughters.  Jones, to whom all the Resolutions which had been taken in Favor of Mr. Blifil were yet a Secret, was almost struck dead with this Relation; but recovering his Spirits a little, mere Despair, as his afterward said, inspired his to mention a Matter to Mr. Western, which seemed to require more impudence than a human Forehead was ever gifted with. his desired Leave to go to Sophia, that his might endeavor to obtain Sophia Concurrence with her Father's Inclinations.  If the good Squire had been as quick-sighted, as the good Squire was remarkable for the contrary, Passion might at present very well have blinded the good Squire. the good Squire thanked Poor Mr. Jones for offering to undertake the Office, and said, 'Go, go, prithee, try what can do;' and then swore many execrable Oaths that many execrable Oaths would turn many execrable Oaths out of Doors unless many execrable Oaths consented to the Match.  CHAP. VIII. The Meeting between Poor Mr. Jones and Sophia.  Poor Mr. Jones departed instantly in Quest of Sophia, whom Poor Mr. Jones found just risen from the Ground where her Father had left Poor Mr. Jones, with the Tears trickling from Poor Mr. Jones Eyes, and Poor Mr. Jones Blood running from Poor Mr. Jones Lips. Poor Mr. Jones presently ran to Poor Mr. Jones, and with a Voice full at once of Tenderness and Terror, cried, 'O my Sophia, what means this dreadful Sight!' -- Poor Mr. Jones looked softly at Poor Mr. Jones for a Moment before Poor Mr. Jones spoke, and then said, 'Poor Mr. Jones, for Heaven's Sake, how came you here? -- Leave me, I beseech you, this Moment.' 'Do not,' says Poor Mr. Jones, 'impose so harsh a Command upon Poor Mr. Jones -- my Heart bleeds faster than her Lipsher Lips. O Sophia, how easily could I drain my Veins to preserve one Drop of that dear Blood.' 'I have too many Obligations to you already,' answered Poor Mr. Jones, 'for sure' you meant too many Obligations such -- Here Poor Mr. Jones looked at Poor Mr. Jones tenderly almost a Minute, and then bursting into an an Agony, cried, -- 'O Mr. Jones, -- why did you save my Life? -- my Death would have been happier for us both -- 'Happier for us both!' cried Poor Mr. Jones, Could Racks or Wheels kill me so painfully as Sophia's! -- I cannot bear the dreadful Sound -- Do I live but for Sophia?' -- Both Poor Mr. Jones Voice and look were full of inexpressible Tenderness when Poor Mr. Jones spoke these Words, and at the same Time Poor Mr. Jones laid gently hold on Sophia Hand, which Sophia did not withdraw from Poor Mr. Jones; to say the Truth, Sophia hardly knew what Sophia did or suffered. A few Moments now passed in Silence between those Lovers, while her Eyes were eagerly fixed on Sophia, and Sophia declining toward the Ground; and at last Sophia recovered Strength enough to desire Poor Mr. Jones again to leave Sophia; for that Sophia certain Ruin would be the Consequence of those Lovers being found together; adding, -- 'O Mr. Jones, you know not, you know not what passed this cruel Afternoon.' I know all, my Sophia,' answered Poor Mr. Jones; her Father has told me all, and her Father has sent me hither to all, my Sophia.' her Father sent you to all, my Sophia!' replied Sophia, 'sure you dream.' Would to Heaven,' cries Poor Mr. Jones, 'it was but a Dream. O Sophia, her Father has sent me to all, my Sophia, to be an Advocate for my odious Rival, to solicit you in Advocate Favor -- I took any Means to get Access to all, my Sophia -- O speak to all, my Sophia, Sophia, comfort my bleeding Heart. Sure no one ever loved, ever doated like all, my Sophia. Do not unkindly withold this dear, this soft, this gentle Hand -- One Moment, perhaps, tears you for ever from all, my Sophia -- Nothing less than this cruel Occasion could, I believe, have ever conquered the Respect and Awe, with which you have inspired me.' Sophia stood a Moment silent and covered with Confusion, then lifting up her Eyes gently toward Confusion, Sophia cried, 'What would Poor Mr. Jones have me say?' 'O do but promise,' cries Poor Mr. Jones, that you never will give yourself to Blifil,' 'Name not,' answered Sophia, 'the detested Sound. Be assured I never will give Poor Mr. Jones what it is in my Power to withold from Poor Mr. Jones.' 'Now then,' cries Poor Mr. Jones, 'while you are so perfectly kind, go a little farther, and add that I may hope.' -- 'Alass,' says Sophia, 'Poor Mr. Jones, whither will you drive me? What Hope have I to bestow? You know my Father's Intentions.' -- 'But I know,' answered my Father's Intentions, 'your Compliance with them cannot be compelled.' What,' says Sophia, 'must be the dreadful Consequence of my Disobedience? My own Ruin is my least Concern. I cannot bear the Thoughts of being the Cause of her Father's Misery.' He is He the Cause,' cries Jones, 'by exacting a Power over you which Nature has not given He. Think on the Misery I am to suffer, if I am to lose you, and see on which Side Pity will turn the Balance.' 'Think of it!' replied Sophia, 'can you imagine I do not feel the Ruin which I must bring on you, should I comply with your Desire -- It is that Thought which gives me Resolution to bid you fly from me for ever, and avoid your own Destruction.' I fear no Destruction,' cries Thought which gives me Resolution to bid you fly from me for ever, 'but the Loss of Sophia; if you would save me from the most bitter Agonies, recall that cruel Sentence -- Indeed, I can never part with you, indeed I cannot.'  The Lovers stood both silent and trembling, Sophia being unable to withdraw Sophia Hand from Poor Mr. Jones, and Poor Mr. Jones almost as unable to hold it; when the Scene, which I believe some of my Readers will think had lasted long enough, was interrupted by one of so different a Nature, that we shall reserve the Relation of it for a different Chrpter.  CHAP. IX. Being of a much more tempestuous Kind than the former.  BEFORE we proceed with what happened to we , it may be proper to recount what had past in his Hall, during The Lovers tender Interview.  Soon after Poor Mr. Jones had left Mr. Western in the Manner abovementioned, Soon after Jones had left Mr. Western in the Manner abovementioned Sister came to Soon after Jones had left Mr. Western in the Manner abovementioned; and was presently informed of all that had past between his Sister Brother and Sophia, relating to Blifil.  This Behavior in his Sister Neice, his Sister construed to an absolute Breach of the Condition, on which his Sister had engaged to keep his Sister Love for Poor Mr. Jones a Secret. his Sister considered his Sister, therefore, at full Liberty to reveal all his Sister knew to the Squire, which his Sister did immediately in the most explicit Terms, and without any Ceremony or Preface.  The Idea of a Marriage between Poor Mr. Jones and Poor Mr. Jones Daughter, had never once entered into the good Squire's Head, either in the warmest Minutes of Poor Mr. Jones Affection toward that young Man, or from Suspicion, or on any other Occasion. Poor Mr. Jones did indeed consider a Parity of Fortune and Circumstances, to be physically as necessary an Ingredient in Marriage, as Difference of Sexes, or any other Essential; and had no more Apprehension of Poor Mr. Jones Daughter's falling in Love with a poor Man, than with any Animal of a different Species.  Poor Mr. Jones became, therefore, like one Thunderstruck at his Sister's Relation. Poor Mr. Jones was, at first, incapable of making any Answer, having been almost deprived of Poor Mr. Jones Breath by the Violence of the Surprise. This, however, soon returned, and as is usual in other Cases after an Intermission, with redoubled Force and Fury.  The first Use he made of the Power of Speech, after he Recovery from the sudden Effects of he Astonishment, was to discharge a round Volley of Oaths and Imprecations. After which he proceeded hastily to the Apartment, where he expected to find the Lovers, and murmured, or indeed, rather roared forth Intentions of Revenge every Step he went.  As when two Doves, or two Wood-pigeons, or as when Strephon and Phillis (for that comes nearest to the Mark) are retired into some pleasant solitary Grove, to enjoy the delightful Conversation of Love; that bashful Boy who cannot speak in public, and is never a good Companion to more than two at a Time. Here, while every Object is serene, should a hoarse Thunder burst suddenly through the shattered Clouds, and rumbling roll along the Sky, the frightened Maid starts from the mossy Bank or verdant Turf; the pale Livery of Death succeeds the red Regimentals in which Love had before dressed Love Cheeks; Fear shakes Love whole Frame, and Love Lover scarce supports Love trembling, tottering Limbs.  Or as when two Gentlemen, Strangers to the wondrous Wit of the Place, are cracking a Bottle together at some Inn or Tavern at Salisbury, if the great Dowdy who acts the Part of a Madman, as well as some of his Setters-on do that of a Fool, should rattle his Chains, and dreadfully hum forth the grumbling Catch along the Gallery; the frighted Strangers stand aghast, scared at the horrid Sound, the frighted Strangers seek some Place of Shelter from the approaching Danger, and if the well-barred Windows did admit the frighted Strangers Exit, would venture the frighted Strangers Necks to escape the threatening Fury now coming upon their Necks.  So trembled poor Sophia, so turned poor Sophia pale at the Noise of poor Sophia Father, who in a Voice most dreadful to hear, came on swearing, cursing and vowing the Destruction of Poor Mr. Jones. To say the Truth, I believe the Youth himself would, from some prudent Considerations, have preferred another Place of Abode at this Time, had the Youth himself Terror on Sophia's Account given the Youth himself Liberty to reflect a Moment on what any otherways concerned the Youth himself, than as the Youth himself Love made the Youth himself partake whatever affected Love.  And now the good Squire having burst open the Door, beheld an Object which instantly suspended all the good Squire Fury against Poor Mr. Jones; this was the ghastly Appearance of Sophia, who had fainted away in Sophia Lover's Arms. This tragical Sight Mr. Western no sooner beheld, than all the good Squire Rage forsook the good Squire, the good Squire roared for Help with the good Squire utmost Violence; ran first to his Daughter, then back to the Door, calling for Water, and then back again to Sophia, never considering in whose Arms Sophia then was, nor, perhaps, once recollecting that there was such a Person in the World as Poor Mr. Jones: For, indeed, I believe, the present Circumstances of his Daughter were now the sole consideration which employed the good Squire Thoughts.  Mrs. Western and a great Number of Servants soon came to the Assistance of Sophia, with Water, Cordials, and every Thing necessary on those Occasions. These were applied with such Success, that Sophia in a very few Minutes began to recover, and all the Symptoms of Life to return. Upon which Sophia was presently led off by Sophia own Maid and Mrs. Western; nor did that his Sister depart without leaving some wholesome Admonitions with Sophia Brother, on the dreadful Effects of her Brother Passion, or, as his Sister pleased to call it, Madness.  the good Squire, perhaps, did not understand this goo Advice, as the good Squire was delivered in obscure Hints, Shrugs, and Notes of Admiration; at least, if her Brother did understand it, her Brother profited very little by it: For no sooner was her Brother cured of her Brother immediate Fears for her Brother , than her Brother relapsed into her Brother former Frenzy, which must have produced an immediate Battle with Poor Mr. Jones, had not Parson Supple, who was a very strong Man, been present, and by mere Force restrained the good Squire the good Squire from Acts of Hostility.  poor Sophia was departed, Poor Mr. Jones advanced in a very suppliant Manner to Mr. Western, whom the Parson held in the Parson Arms, and begged Poor Mr. Jones to be pacified; for that while Poor Mr. Jones continued in such a Passion it would be impossible to give Poor Mr. Jones any Satisfaction.  'I wull have satisfaction of thee,' answered the good Squire, 'so doff thy Clothes. At unt half a Man, 'and I Will lick thee as well as wast ever licked in thy Life.' Hethen bespattered the Youth with Abundance of that Language, which passes between Country Gentlemen who embrace opposite Sides of the Question; with frequent Applications to Poor Mr. Jones to salute that Part which is generally introduced into all Controversies, that arise among the lower Orders of the English Gentry, at Horse-races, Cock-matches, and other public Places. Allusions to this Part are likewise often made for the Sake of the Jest. And here, I believe, the Wit is generally misunderstood. In Reality, the Wit lies in desiring another to kiss your A -- for having just before threatened to kick his: For I have observed very accurately, that no one ever desires you to kick that which belongs to himself, nor offers to kiss this Part in another.  It may likewise seem surprising, that in the many thousand kind Invitations of this Sort, which every one who has conversed with Country Gentlemen, must have heard, no one, I believe, has ever seen a single Instance where the Desire has been complied with. A great Instance of their Want of Politeness: For in Town, nothing can be more common than for the finest Country Gentlemen to perform Ceremony every Day to their Superiors, without having that Favor once requested of their.  To all such Wit, Poor Mr. Jones very calmly answered, 'their Want of Politeness, this Usage, may, perhaps, cancel every other Obligation you have conferred on their Want of Politeness; but there is one you can never cancel; nor will I be provoked by your Abuse, to lift my Hand against the Father of Sophia.'  At these Words, the good Squire the good Squire grew still more outrageous than before; so that the Parson begged Poor Mr. Jones to retire, saying, 'You behold, Sir, how the good Squire waxes Wroth at your abode here; therefore, let me pray you not to tarry any longer. the good Squire Anger is too much kindled for you to commune with the good Squire at present. You had better, therefore, conclude your Visit, and refer what Matter you have to urge in your Behalf, to some other Opportunity.'  Poor Mr. Jones accepted this goo Advice with Thanks, and immediately departed. the good Squire now regained the Liberty of the good Squire Hands, and so much Temper as to express some Satisfaction in the Restraint which had been laid upon the good Squire; declaring that the good Squire should certainly have beat the good Squire Brains out; and adding, 'It would have vexed one confoundedly to have been hanged for such a Rascal.'  the Parson now began to triumph in the Success of the Parson Peacemaking Endeavors, and proceeded to read a Lecture against Anger, which might, perhaps, rather have tended to raise than to quiet that Passion in some hasty Minds. This Lecture the Parson enriched with many valuable Quotations from the Ancients, particularly from Seneca; who has, indeed, so well handled this Passion, that none but a very angry Man can read Man without great Pleasure and Profit. The Doctor concluded The Doctor Harangue with the famous Story of Alexander and Clytus; but as I find that entered in my Commonplace under Title Drunkenness, I shall not insert it here.  the good Squire the good Squire took no Notice of this Story, nor, perhaps, of any Thing the good Squire said: For the good Squire interrupted the good Squire before the good Squire had finished by calling for a Tankard of Beer; observing (which is, perhaps, as true as any Observation on this Fever of the Mind) that Anger makes a Man dry.  No sooner had the good Squire the good Squire swallowed a large Draught than the good Squire renewed the Discourse on Poor Mr. Jones, and declared a Resolution of going the next Morning early to acquaint Mr. Allworthy. Mr. Allworthy Friend would have dissuaded Mr. Allworthy from this, from the mere Motive of Goodnature; but Mr. Allworthy Dissuasion had no other Effect, than to produce a large Volley of Oaths and Curses, which greatly shocked the pious Ears of Supple; but his Dissuasion did not dare to remonstrate against a Privilege, which the good Squire the good Squire claimed as a freeborn Englishman. To say Truth, the Parson the Parson submitted to please the Parson Palate at the good Squire's Table, at the Expense of suffering this Violence now and then to the Parson Ears. the Parson contented the Parson with thinking the Parson did not promote this evil Practice, and that the good Squire the good Squire would not swear an Oath the less if the Parson never entered within the Parson Gates. However, though the Parson was not guilty of ill Manners by rebuking a Gentleman in a Gentleman own House, a Gentleman paid a Gentleman off obliquely in the Pulpit; which had not, indeed, the good Effect of working a Reformation in the good Squire a Gentleman, yet it so far operated on a Gentleman Conscience, that a Gentleman put the Laws very severely in Execution against others, and the Magistrate was the only Person in the Parish who could swear with Impunity.  CHAP. X. In which This tragical Sight Mr. Western visits Mr. Allworthy.  MR. Mr. Allworthy was now retired from Breakfast with Mr. Allworthy Nephew, well satisfied with the Report of the young Gentleman's successful Visit to Sophia (for Mr. Allworthy greatly desired the Match, more on Account of his Sister's Character than of his Sister Riches) when This tragical Sight Mr. Western broke abrubtly in upon them, and without any Ceremony began as follows.  'There, you have done a fine Piece of Work truly. You have brought up your Bastard to a fine Purpose; not that I believe you have had any Hand in it neither, that is, as a Man may say, designedly; but there is a fine Kettle of Fish made o't up at our House.' 'What can be the Matter, Mr. Western? said Mr. Allworthy. O Matter enough of all Conscience; his Sister has fallen in Love with your Bastard, that is all, but I will not ge his Sister a Hapenny, not the Twentieth Part of a Brass Farthing. I always thought what would come of breeding up a your Bastard like a Gentleman, and letting un come about to Volk's Houses. Its well vor un I could not get at un, I Would a licked un, I Would a spoiled his Caterwauling,
