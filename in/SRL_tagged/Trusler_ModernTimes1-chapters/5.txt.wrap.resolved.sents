and upon the truth of which you may rely.
A man of tolerable good connexions was brought in here for a highway robbery.
This fellow applied to A man of tolerable good connexions, and amused A man of tolerable good connexions with hopes of escape.
As a drowning man will, to save This fellow, even catch at straws, so this unhappy culprit listened to This fellow deceitful adviser.
This fellow gave This fellow to understand, that if This fellow could furnish This fellow with ten guineas, This fellow would procure a copy of the indictment, and had no doubt of discovering some error in it, that would instantly quash it.
ten guineas were given, but on a second visit This fellow was told, that counsel had examined the indictment, and not the shadow of a flaw could be found: but, that This fellow was convinced, from the account This fellow had received of the prosecutor, that This fellow might be bought off, and of the evidence, that he might be bought off, and of the evidence might be softened for about twenty pound.
This fellow possessed that twenty pounds.
It was given; and a third visit told This fellow, that the prosecutor had been applied to, and was found incorruptible, and the evidence too respectable to be influenced; that the cash had been expended in bribing those, who were supposed to have some weight with the evidence, but the cash could not succeed.
However, says Grind, as I have always people ready to prove an alibi This is to prove, that the prisoner was in some other place, than some other place alleged, when the fact for which the prisoner is arraigned, was committed.
, if you can raise thirty pounds more, there is no doubt of success.
The poor wretch applies to the prisoner friends, and twenty pounds were raised; but The poor wretch turned out as ineffectual as the last.
The trial came on, the alibi was overthrown, and the poor devil convicted.
Could nothing more be done?
-- Yes, for ten more, the prisoner would move an arrest of judgment, for the proceedings had been illegal.
Here the prisoner was foiled again; counsel had exerted The poor wretch, but the attempt was overruled.
-- There was, however, another step, in which the prisoner flattered the prisoner the prisoner should be more successful.
This was by a proper application of thirty guineas, to bring over the Recorder to make a favorable report.
-- This sum was also got, but the means equally unsuccessful.
In this hopeless situation, the attorney addresses the attorney again.
If the attorney could any ways contrive, through the attorney , to raise twenty pounds more, a petition should be presented to the throne, and care should be taken to get the throne well backed at the council board, and the attorney might rely on a pardon.
the attorney usually contrived the matter to end, long before the throne got so far, but your case, says the attorney, is an uncommon one, which has hitherto baffled all my endeavors, but in this final step, I never fail.
Encouraged by this declaration, every friend, as for life, was importuned, and twenty pounds procured, but all to no purpose.
The death warrant was signed, and an order came down for execution.
In a distracted state of mind, the poor wretch sends for the poor wretch lawyer again, reminds the poor wretch of the many promises his lawyer had made, the many great sums his lawyer had received, and asked his lawyer, 'if there were no hopes after all?'
'Hopes,' says his lawyer, to be sure there are.
a petition is so strongly worded, and so powerfully backed, that take my word for a petition, they cannot hang you -- they dare not hang you, -- and there was not the least doubt but his lawyer would be left out of The death warrant.
-- 'Aye, Sir,' returns the despairing criminal, it was on this account I sent for Aye, Sir.
The death warrant is signed, -- I am in The death warrant, and an order is come down for execution on Wednesday morning.
This the attorney could not stand; -- Execution!
exclaimed he, Execution!
-- Well -- let 'em hang you, -- let 'em hang you, and d -- n me, if it shall not be the worst job they ever did in they lives!
-- At this, he turned upon he heel, and left he deluded client to he fate.
THIS story determined me not to see Mr.
Grind; I sent he word my case was of a nature not to need he assistance, and therefore I would not trouble he; I thanked my friend for he admonition, and resolved to trust to he.
Not knowing the nature of a night-cellar, which had been dropped in conversation, I wished for some account of one, and requested my adviser to make me acquainted with what he knew of some account of one.
he gave me the following account:  A NIGHT-CELLAR is an alehouse under ground, in some populous, but secret part of the town, which is kept open all night, for the resort of whores and rogues, and all such persons, whose actions will not bear the test of daylight.
In some of these places of rendezvous, villains of note are generally to be found, and through the treachery of gangs in general, that of Justice Fleece'em's becomes well-acquainted with villains of note persons.
There is seldom a daring robbery or burglary committed, but Baildock and Baildock crew get some intelligence of it; and though Baildock and his crew are not able immediately to fix it on any particular man, Baildock and his crew will soon trace it out, and take the offender into custody.
Daring as these scoundrels are, there is an unaccountable infatuation in most of these scoundrels are, that will lead these scoundrels are to surrender these scoundrels are to Fleec'em's men, without violence.
Baildock has many a time searched these night-cellars alone, without fear or danger.
As madmen will, in madmen raving intervals, cease raving at sight of madmen keeper, and submit quietly to him, so will most of these villains yield, without resistance, to the mandates of Baildock.
Whether these villains are awed by him undaunted resolution, or dismayed by conscience, or any other motive, I cannot say; but Baildock has been known to carry off from these places, the man him looked for, and without the least opposition.
Baildock, says one of these fellows, as him approached him in one of him midnight searches, I hope you are not come for him?
No, Tom, says Tom, it is not you I want, but Dick Hounslow, and I see Tom yonder.
Come, Tom, you must go with him.
-- D -- n me, says Tom, if I did not dream as much a day or two ago; then addressing Tom to Tom company, well, gentlemen, says Tom, God bless you -- this sessions will be the end of him -- may you outlive many of them!
-- and walked off with Baildock, as quietly as if in irons.
WAS I to relate to the reader, all the information I picked up during the time I was in this prison, it would fill a volume; and amusing as it might have been at any other time, I was too much taken up with my own affairs to attend much to it.
I was to prepare for a second examination.
A magistrate has certainly no authority to bring up prisoners before A magistrate to a second, or a third examination; if there is sufficient charge against prisoners for commitment, prisoners are to be committed for trial; if not, A magistrate is to discharge prisoners; but Justice Fleece'em made a trade of Justice Fleece'em profession, and Justice Fleece'em house was a kind of petty court of judicature, where prisoners went, as it were, through a formal trial.
It was so far of use indeed, that to a villain it was a good preparatory to Justice Fleece'em arraignment at the Old Bailey, and was frequently a means of Justice Fleece'em finding methods to get off.
THOUGH appearances were strong against me, being wrapped up in conscious innocence, I was convinced that the arrows of malevolence could not hurt me.
I was not without money, and I set about collecting the evidence in my favor.
I recollected that a porter at the auctioneer's was present when I bought the watch; and that on the evening when the prosecutor was robbed, I kept my room with a cold, and had at that time a neighboring apothecary to attend me; these people, I was persuaded, would justify my innocence, if the auctioneer was so relentless, as not to appear in my behalf.
Indeed, I had little favor to expect from the prosecutor; for such is the strange conduct of mankind, that whilst a man, who knows you, has reason to think the prosecutor is well with you, the prosecutor will do you no open injury, but, if convenience, or any circumstance has once led the prosecutor to treat you ill, by the prosecutor sacrificing your interest to the prosecutor, so that the prosecutor despairs of your ever forgiving the prosecutor, the prosecutor becomes the most inveterate enemy you have; and, though you have never given the prosecutor the least offense, it is all the fame, the prosecutor acts and speaks of you in future, as if you had been a thorn in the prosecutor side ever since the prosecutor had any knowledge of you.
It was not so, however, with the prosecutor; though, as I since learned from the prosecutor porter, the prosecutor was the means of my being apprehended, by a false insinuation; even this man, thinking the prosecutor had punished me sufficiently, thought proper, on application, to appear in my favor; of course, notwithstanding, on my second examination, the prosecutor was not present; I was acquitted, with the loss only of the watch I had purchased, and the expense of a few pounds in messengers, fees and other contingencies.
Before, however, I left the Justice, I took the liberty to ask for my watch, which as I had fairly purchased, I thought the prosecutor entitled to, when all the satisfaction I could get was, The first of James the first, chapter twenty-one, says, The sale of goods in London, wrongfully come by, shall not alter the property; of course the property belongs to the prosecutor.
And I was afterward told, upon inquiry, that on the prosecutor's demanding his watch, his could obtain no other answer than, The law says, Goods sold in open market shall be the property of the buyer; now, all London is an open market, and every day, except Sunday, market day in London; therefore, it belongs to the prisoner.
I thought little, however, about the watch, or my money, happy to owe my acquittal to my innocence; indeed, his watch was an expense to the prosecutor which I could not well afford; for as it was frequently out of order, whenever I carried it to a watchmaker I was sure to have six or seven shillings to pay.
This is one of a watchmaker I was sure to have six or seven shillings to pay modes of getting money; though little or nothing is the matter with a watch, a watchmaker I was sure to have six or seven shillings to pay will pretend it requires repair, which you cannot contradict, and make you pay accordingly.
