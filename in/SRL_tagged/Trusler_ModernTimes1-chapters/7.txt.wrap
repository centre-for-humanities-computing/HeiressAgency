THE next place I got, and this through the means of an acquaintance, was that of an amanuensis to a clergyman. He was a man of some fortune, and like most clergymen of fortune, too indolent to write his own sermons. So he was in possession of the church, he cared little what became of the congregation. He was the younger son of a good family, had a chapel in London, a fellowship at Cambridge, and an annuity of 200 l. a year; sufficient together to enable him to keep a pair of horses. When in town he wore a large grizzel wig, a pair of square-toed shoes, in short dressed like, and had all the formality of, a Presbyterian; though a young man, he screwed up his face into a primitive form, and would scarce suffer a smile upon his countenance; and there was such an affected severity in his manner, that you would have taken him for a saint; but when in the country, he was a buck of the first head, wore a smart bob wig, leather breeches, and was always in boots: he had but a small stock of sermons, and I was engaged, for a few months, to provide him with a greater. Having purchased a set of manuscripts, which he could not well read, my business was to transcribe them, and now and then throw in a passage or two which he occasionally penned on a slip of paper, as his leisure moments from hunting, drinking, and the card-table would admit. Indeed, I frequently helped him out, very often adding some passages of my own; so that he would often say I should make a very good parson. He was once, when at Cambridge, called upon to preach in the morning at St. Mary's, before the university, and not having a proper sermon upon the occasion, nor being able to compose or to compile one, was under a thousand anxieties; for he studied appearances more than most young men in the church. At last a circumstance happened, that relieved him from his pain. While in Cambridge, we dwelt in college; and it so happened, that a fellow of the same community who lived in the adjoining rooms, was appointed to preach at the same church in the afternoon. This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master, delivered his sermon aloud every morning before his glass in his own room, in order to acquit himself well on the day of exhibition; and as the partition between the two apartments was only a wainscot, I could distinctly hear every word: accordingly, with my master's consent, I took down his sermon verbatim, and he preached it in the morning. This being unknown to the other gentleman, the same discourse was delivered in the afternoon. Though he who penned it labored to have it believed that he was the author of it, it did not avail, the mystery was not unravelled, my master had all the credit, and the afternoon preacher was considered only as a purloiner of the copy.  HAVING furnished my master with about four dozen of sermons, which he called a pretty good stock, he proposed to discharge me, and took some pains to recommend me to a friend, as a very useful hand in the divinity way; but his friend was of another cast, he always composed his sermons himself; persuaded no one could do them so well, though when composed, few could understand them, from the variety of new words he used, and much fewer liked them. He used to console himself however with observing, that he really pitied his congregation for the vexation they must feel, at hearing so many fine things of which they were neither the writer nor the speaker. It is said, that those who are bit by a mad animal partake of its nature and insanity. If this be the case, I am persuaded this friend of my master's had been bit by a bookworm, for he was literally literary mad. See him when you would, he was never without a book, and when at home was almost overwhelmed with them. Every new publication he purchased, it be in what language it would; for though he was master of but one, he fancied himself well read in all, and always prided himself in having had the first copy wet from the press. Often have I seen him in his study, almost buried in volumes. They lay all round him and his table, piled high upon the floor, and as he would never suffer a servant to dust them, for fear of derangement, and was too much occupied in little thoughts to do it himself, they were covered with dust. Here he would sometimes bury himself whole days in little more than re-arranging them, and would be almost lost in a cloud of dust. He said, that in the English language there was a paucity of expression that required to be abundified, and he labored to repair this defect. He called himself a nealogist, or a former of new words. Whenever he received a present, he returned his civilities and thanked his friend for his prevenient politeness; and when he sent his old black waistcoat to be new dipped, he requested the dyer to re-nigrisy it. There was not an author abroad with whom he did not court a correspondence, nor any scribbler at home whom he did not pester with his visits. He would show a card from Rousseau, and a letter from Voltaire, as a medallist would exhibit a Cromwell's silver penny, or an Otho. As I shall have occasion to speak of this man again, I shall drop the subject now, with saying, that, as during my stay with my master, I found out the art of making sermons, and as no enquiry is ever made before a man officiates as a clergyman, whether he be really in orders or not; flattering myself I should make as conscientious a priest as the generality of parsons are; and being so little of a Roman catholic, as not to conceive, that the laying on of hands by a bishop, can confer grace, any more than that a few words mumbled over a piece of bread, can make any alteration in its nature, I determined to take no other place, but to start forward in the profession myself; and, as this thought struck me soon after I commenced an amanuensis, I wrote two copies of every sermon I was directed to transcribe, and kept one for my own use. These amounted in the end to some dozens; accordingly, being furnished with all the requisites of a modern parson, namely, a few sermons, an iron gray suit, and a stock of impudence; as soon as I quitted my master, I applied to Mr. Snuffle, in Paternoster Row, for employ.  THIS gentleman was formerly a parish clerk, but growing tired with saying amen for twenty pounds a year, he has found out a new method of being serviceable to himself, under the idea of being useful to the clergy. As there are register offices for a variety of respectable wants, for houses, servants, whores, etc, so this is a register office for parsons, a kind of divinity-shop in the city of London for hiring of preachers, readers, and so on, by the day or the week as occasion requires. For this purpose, he keeps a list of unemployed clergy, of all ages and characters, to suit certain congregations; some for example, attend much to the voice and to the action, and as they never take their eyes from the preacher during the whole sermon, they wish for something tolerable to look at. These he would furnish with a smart prig preacher of twenty-five, who would keep them awake by an exertion of the voice, and a display of the arms; to others, who do not like to be taught by boys, and had rather doze away a heavy hour or two, which the law will not suffer them to employ in their respective occupations, and who go to church more to keep up appearances, than from any spirit of devotion, he would provide a monotonist of sixty. For such men, like the tale-tellers in Scotland, have a happy knack of composing a congregation into a comfortable nap.  FROM this list he selects his preachers, and lets them out for a stipulated sum, according to the duty they are to perform, taking for himself as agent, ten per cent. and one shilling extra for those he accommodates with a gown and cassack. The following is a copy of his printed list of prices.  s. d. For reading and preaching on Sundays, morning or evening 10 6 For preaching only. 7 6 For reading prayers only 5 0 For administering the sacrament 5 0 For assisting at ditto 1 0 For reading prayers on a week day, morning or evening 1 0 For ditto on a Litany day 1 6 For ditto on a festival 2 6 For burying a corpse, christening a child, or praying by a sick person 1 0 For churching a woman during service 6  I THINK I cannot explain the nature of this undertaking better, than by giving my readers te substance of a dialogue between Mr. Snuffle and a very ingenious friend of mine, who once applied to him, and which on his death bed he thought proper to leave to the world.  " Curate. "MR. Snuffle your servant."   " Mr. Snuffle. "Doctor, yours."   "Curate," I suppose, Mr. Snuffle, you can guess my errand. I am going out of town tomorrow, for a fortnight, and shall want a supply, and at the same time, Master Snuffle, I come to inform you, I shall from this day commence agent and patient, and intend to hire and be hired; so, as I am likely to be a pretty considerable dealer, and am, besides, an old acquaintance, hope you will give me the turn of the scale. So put me down in your list immediately.   Mr. Snuffle (pulling out his list). IT shall be done, Sir. And a most respectable list it is, I assure you; I have just got a fresh cargo of Scotch divines, piping hot from Edinburgh, besides the old corpse -- my collection ends with, -- let me see -- fourteen schoolmasters, five doctors of divinity, two of them justices of the peace, two reviewers, three political writers, two bible-makers, (mind the climax --) and a king's chaplain.   Curate. All men of erudition, I suppose?   Mr. Snuffle. Excellent scholars, -- charming preachers, I assure you, but -- enter nous, not one of them worth a sixpence in the world. -- But to your business --   Curate. Aye, Mr Snuffle, -- I must have a good voice for Wednesdays and Fridays, and one of your best orators for Sunday next: you know my congregation is a little delicate.   Mr. Snuffle. Then you must have a young man. My young gentlemen, I assure you, are all cushion-thumpers -- none of your dreaming chaps -- if there is the least grain of dust in a pulpit cushion, I Will be sworn they will beat it out -- (looking over his list) here is Parson Rawbones, one of my athletic, able-bodied divines; it is not long since he knocked down a clerk in the desk, for interrupting him in the middle of a collect (and it was only for telling him he was reading the wrong one) this you know showed him to be a man of spirit, and kept up the dignity of the cloth. No parson, let me tell you, is respected now, that is not a boxing one. But I doubt whether he will do for you, for he is a north countryman, and has got a burr in his throat; he will never pass at your end of the town: I shall sport him, however, at a day lecture, or an early sacrament.   Curate. You are so facetious, Mr. Snuffle. But pray find me somebody, for I am in haste.   Mr. Snuffle. If you had wanted a whiner or bawler for a charity sermon, I could help you to the best beggar in England, an arrant pickpocket for the middle aisle. Beats your M -- r's, and your H -- n's, our of the pit, a doctor of divinity too, and a justice of the peace; but he wont do for you, for the dog's over head and ears in debt, and daren't stir out on a weekday for fear of the bailiffs; -- but here -- I have him for you, Young Gallop, the quickest reader in London. He Will give Dr. Drawl to the Te deum, and overtake him before he comes to the thanksgiving! -- A very proper man for this season of the year! -- an excellent reader for a cold day! -- and a rare hand at a collect! -- But you must tip him more than half a guinea for the morning's duty. -- Let me tell you, Sir, I am a good friend to the inferior clergy, and have done more for them (and that is a bold word) than the whole bench of bishops. I believe I may safely say, I have raised the price of lungs at least cent per cent; I knew the time, and so did you, when a well-cassocked divine was glad to read prayers on a holliday for a shilling; old C -- never had more in his life; now, Sir, I never let a tit go out my stable (you will pardon my jocularity) upon such an occasion, under half a crown.   IT is to these, and such like indignities, to which the clergy are obliged to submit, that the function owes it is degradation. Having received the best of educations, and flattering myself I had equal abilities in compiling and delivering a discourse with the best of them, I persuaded myself that, whilst I kept my own secret, I could do no great harm. I could pass an examination; and of course, could have taken orders if I pleased, and, as a late Bishop of Chester would never ordain a man till be had officiated as a deacon for three years, to see how he took to the profession, I conceived there could be no harm in my putting myself upon a similar trial.  HAVING then applied to this same Mr Snuffle, he soon found me employ, and as I acquitted myself to his satisfaction, and in a manner that did him credit, I never was idle; but an ill-judged parsimony of mine overturned the bucket presently. I was employed to read prayers on a weekday in a large parish, for which I had my shilling, but being called, at that time, on more important business, to the other end of the town, I appointed a deputy, and gave him half my fees, but he was so out of spirits at being obliged to officiate, at a price so degrading to the profession, and so derogatory to the honor of the cloth, that he did not exert himself sufficiently to be heard, and on the clerk's hinting to him, after service, that he feared the congregation did not hear him, his answer was, How do you think, friend, I am paid? I presume, replies the clerk, the usual compliment. "Not so, Sir," returns the parson, I am paid but half price, and I therefore only read my half-best. This story was carried to Mr. Snuffle; and, for attempting to take the bread out of his mouth, I was immediately struck off his list.  I, AT this time, got intelligence, that a certain Viscount in the west, having married a woman of low family, who had a maiden sister, proposed to give any clergyman, that would take her to wife, a living in his disposal, then vacant, of five hundred pounds a year. I determined to look after this living, for though I was not in orders, as I have observed before, being sufficiently qualified, I could easily have been ordained; the necessary testimonials I made no doubt of procuring. This lady lived at a market town in the neighborhood of Oxford: I accordingly inquired of the man who drove the stage-coach between that town and London, whether there was an assembly at that place, he told me there was, and promised to bring me word, the next time he came up, on what day the next assembly was to be. This information being procured, I hired an elegant post-chaise for the journey, and took a friend with me, for whom I borrowed a smart livery, and who followed as my servant on horseback. I let this friend into my scheme, and promising him a reward if I succeeded, gave him his instructions; which were, to pass me for a man of good family and fortune. Thus, with two of my best sermons in my pocket, I set off for the place I was bound to, and arrived there on a Friday evening, five days, as the coachman told me, before the assembly day. Having sent for the landlord of the house where I was, I inquired, who served the church? he told me, a young gentleman from Oxford. My reason, friend, says I, for asking, is, that I am a clergyman, and mean to pass a few days here, and, if I thought it would be agreeable to your minister, I would ease him of his duty on Sunday. His reply was: I have no doubt Sir, but he would he very glad of the offer; it is a long way to Oxford, and the roads, from the late rains, very bad. Tomorrow is market day there, and as several of our farmers will be going, if you think proper to write a letter, I will send it. This letter was written, and the answer, such as I wished. On Sunday I preached; and, from the great attention that was paid me on all sides, I conceive that I acquitted myself with eclat; but the object of my journey, however, was, unfortunately for me, not at church. As I came down from the pulpit, an elderly lady, after paying me some compliments on my sermon, asked me, if I made nay stay in that town? On my answering in the affirmative, she told me her name, and requested my company to dinner. I waited on her, and found her the gossip of the place. From her I acquired every information I wished, and might, if I pleased, have learned the history of every family in the neighborhood. Among other information, however, I found to my mortification, that the assembly was not to be so soon as I expected, by a fortnight.  ON my return to my quarters, I begged the landlord's company, and among other things, asked him, who was mayor of the town, and what kind of a man he was; he informed me, that he was a respectable tradesman, a person of property, and a good-natured well-bred man. This account so met my wishes, that I called for paper, and wrote the following card, to be dispatched the next morning.  THE gentleman who preached yesterday, presents his compliments to Mr. Mayor, and, if he will give him leave, will do himself the honor to drink tea with him this afternoon.  THE answer returned was:  MR. Mayor's compliments to the gentleman who preached, and shall be proud of the honor of his company.  WHEN evening came, I ordered my carriage, (for this, and the tongue of my servant gave me no small credit) waited on the Mayor, and was politely received. His house was full of well-dressed men and women, collected, no doubt, for the pleasure of reconnoitering me. Conceiving some apology necessary for this self-invitation, I addressed him thus before all the company: This abrupt introduction of myself, Mr. Mayor, may require some apology; I am here upon a little excursion, and as being at an inn is irksome, where I have not the happiness of being acquainted, I make it a rule to introduce myself, as I have done here, to the politest families in the town where I am. The gentlemen smiled applause, the ladies tittered behind their fans; but I had the satisfaction to find myself very well-received. Indeed, I wanted no further introduction any where; when the company present found I came down for the assembly, and had an intention of staying some little time, invitations passed regularly round; one engaged me to dinner the next day, another the day following, and so on, but in all these parties I met not with the lady I wished to see; she being considered as beneath the company I was then in. The Mayor, I found, was a pleasant man, and Jack among the maids. He was pleased to say, that as I had come down to honor their assembly, of which he was the founder, he was truly concerned to think the day was so far distant, as to fear the losing me; in order, therefore, that I might not be disappointed, he would convene the ladies, and have a dance at the inn where I was. He returned my visit, however, the next morning, and with a melancholy countenance, told me, the girls were of late grown so squeamish, that they objected to dancing at a public house; and that, as their assembly was in its infancy, he could not permit them the use of the town hall, left the neighboring gentry should, on hearing of this dance, be displeased that they had not notice of it; but that if I would do them the honor to stay over the next Sunday, he would advertise it in the Oxford Gazette on the ensuing Saturday, and, on my account, would fix the assembly on the Thursday following, which was a week sooner than the stated time. I of course acknowledged myself obliged, and agreed to it. Not having yet met, nor being likely to meet, in the company I was with, the lady I was in search of, I excused myself from a party one afternoon, purposely to wait upon her. She lived with her mother, a widow; determining, therefore, to introduce myself, I wrote a card to the mother, similar to the one I sent to the Mayor, and she returned he compliments, saying, as she presumed I had some business with her, she should be glad to see me. I went there in my carriage, and saw the old lady, but Miss was not with her; however, she made her appearance with the tea-table, and expressed a concern that she was not at church last Sunday, as she should have heard, by all accounts, a very excellent sermon, and very gracefully delivered. I entered into the chit-chat of the town, the proposed dance, and the politeness of the Mayor; told her, the assembly was to be the Thursday following, and hoped she would be there; her reply was, She never had been at the assembly, nor did she know she should be admitted, for the ladies of that place did not think her good enough to mix with them. At this the mother fired, and said, her daughter was as good as the best, and she was a fool to keep away; I favored the idea, and encouraged her to go, and told her, that if she would do me the honor to dance with me, I should be proud of her as a partner, and would conduct her there and back. Should I go, says she, I shall have no objections to dance with you, but that is uncertain. So far introduced, I improved the acquaintance; called on her a day or two before the assembly; prevailed on her to accompany me there, and danced with her; and, we became so familiar before the close of the evening, that I told her I was enamoured with her, and solicited permission to pay my addresses to her. With a great deal of candor and goodnature, she acknowledged herself obliged to me for the preference I had shown to her before other ladies, but assured me, she was engaged, and to a brother clergyman; to whom she is since married.  FINDING my plan here abortive, I quitted the place, and returned to London, having been absent from it near three weeks; and, being in daily apprehension of its being found out that I was not in orders, and dreading the demand of the man of whom I had the carriage and horses, which amounted to near twenty pounds, and which I was unable to pay, I retired from my profession, and concealed myself under a different character.  WHEN I reflected upon my conduct, and the deceptions I used, I held myself in detestation; but I soon reconciled it to myself by the plea of necessity, and the collateral one of meaning well; for had I obtained that young lady's consent, and had a promise of the living as a portion, I would have embraced a clerical life, and, I am bold to say, would have acted in that life with honor and probity. As it is, I was reserved for a different situation. There is a fatality, I am convinced, in the lives of all men, that works wonderfully for their good; and, unless it be constantly counteracted, will gain ground gradually to its consummation.  AS I set out with making useful remarks on the various passages in my life, for the improvement and entertainment of my readers; I cannot omit dwelling a little longer on the clerical profession, and observing, that though it is followers draw the many indignities they meet with too often upon themselves, yet their poverty and distressed situation, are frequently the occasions of it. The idea of bringing up a son a gentleman has spoiled many a good tradesman, and has thrown many upon the church whom she is unable to maintain. Lectureships have been considered as a tolerable provision for those who are not provided with livings or curacies; but the establishment of lectureships, if we believe the same ingenious gentleman, who has favored the world with his conference with Mr. Snuffle, has contributed in a great measure to bring upon the whole body of the clergy, that contempt into which they are now fallen. The choice of a lecturer is generally vested in the parishioners at large, as they are paid by a voluntary contribution. These parishioners for the most part, consist of ordinary tradesmen, sometimes very low mechanics, persons not always of the most refined manners, or most delicate sensations. I had not been three weeks in London, says this gentleman, but strolling one Sunday afternoon into a church in the city, I heard the clerk, after service, by order of the vestry, declare the lectureship vacant, and invite the clergy, however dignified or distinguished, to be candidates for it, and to give in their names by the ensuing Sunday. Having no clerical provision, I no sooner heard this church-serjeant beating up for recruits, than I immediately resolved to enlist; and accordingly waited on the worshipful Stentor abovementioned, who took down my name and place of abode. On my desiring him, at the same time, to acquaint me with the best method of proceeding, which I was an utter stranger to, he advised me, as a friend, to apply, as speedily as possible, to Mr. Bluemould, a cheesemonger in Rotten Lane, who was then first churchwarden, a leading man in the vestry, and a person, he assured me, on whom the election would, in a great measure, depend. I took honest Amen's advice, and by nine the next morning (not, I must own, without some reluctance), dressed myself as well as I could, and waited on Mr. Churchwarden. As soon as he saw me enter the shop in my canonicals (for I had hired an excellent new gown and cassock, behind St. Clement's, on the occasion) he made me a low bow, gave me the title of Doctor, and, imagining, no doubt, that I was come to bespeak cheeses for the country, begged to know my honor's commands; to which I replied, in an humble tone, and looking extremely disconcerted, that I came to wait on him on account of the lectureship of the parish, and begged the favor of his vote and interest. You would have smiled to have seen the sudden alteration of his features and behavior: he dropped all the tradesman's obsequiousness, and in a moment assumed the magisterial air and dignity of the churchwarden; turned aside to a woman who was just then asking for a pound of Cheshire cheese, and, without addressing himself to me, cried out, 'This is the fourth parson I have had with me today upon the same errand;' then staring me full in the face, Well, young man,' says he, 'you intend to be a candidate for this same lecture; you are all to mount the nostrum I suppose, and merit will carry it; for my part, I promise nobody; but remember, I tell you before hand, I am for voice and action, so mind your hits.' When he had said this, he immediately turned upon his heel, and went into the counting house. I took my leave in an awkward manner, as you may suppose, being not a little chagrined at his insolence, and as I went out of the shop, overheard his lady observing, from behind the counter, that I was a pretty sprig of divinity, but looked a little sheepish, and had not half the courage of the gentleman that had been recommended to her husband by Mr. Squintum.  THESE are some of the mortifications lectures are subject to; and then as to their pay, and the manner in which they are paid, it adds still further to the contempt they lie under. The churchwardens of a parish once waited on a quaker, a tin-man within their limits, with the lecturer's book, and solicited his contribution toward the support of the afternoon sermon. "Thou know, friend," says he, that we give nothing to thy clergy. 'I admit that,' returns one of the churchwardens, but he is a worthy gentleman, and a good preacher, and you would say so if you heard him; I hope, therefore, as our parish is small, and we cannot make up any great sum, that you will add to it for the sake of your neighbors. The quaker repeated his words as before, and they were leaving his shop when he called them back, with Hark'ye, friend; though I told thee we quakers never give any thing toward the support of thy clergy, yet, as mayhap he may want light, -- I Will gee'un a lantern.  "The lecturer's box," continues my friend, generally goes about with the rest of the parish beggars, a little before Christmas, and every body throws in their charity (for it is always considered in that light) as they think proper. Were I to mention how many paltry excuses are made to evade this little annual tribute, by the mean and sordid; how very little is given even by the most generous, and what an inconsiderable sum the whole generally amounts to, the recital would not afford my readers much entertainment, and for aught I know, might give them some real concern. A lecturer, it is true, is licensed by the bishop, and of course cannot be removed; but notwithstanding this, he is far from independent: if he shows any marks of displeasure, or does not please his congregation, he feels it at the next collection; and when they are tired of him, they withhold their subscriptions, and (as they call it) starve him out.  "You cannot imagine" proceeds my friend, with what an envious eye we poor lecturers have often looked over a waiter's book at a coffee-house, where I have seen such a collection of guineas and half-guineas, as made my mouth water. To give less than a crown would be to the last degree ungenteel, for the immense trouble of handing a dish of coffee, or a newspaper; whilst the poor divine, who has toiled in the ministry for a twelvemonth, and half worn out a pair of excellent lungs in the unprofitable service, shall think himself well rewarded with the noble donation of half a crown.  I know a little too much of the world, to expect that a parson should be paid like a first-rate player, a pimp, or a lord of the treasury, whose incomes I believe are nearly equal, but I cannot help thinking, that a labourer in the vineyard is as well worthy his hire, as a journeyman carpenter or mason, and has as good a right to two pound two, on a Sunday, as they have on a Saturday night; and yet not one in an hundred is paid in that proportion.  To illustrate my subject, I will give my readers another story; there is nothing like a little painting from the life on these occasions. Suppose yourself then an eyewitness of the following scene, which passed not long since in the neighborhood of Covent Garden.  Enter Twist the churchwarden, accompanied by the overseer, into the shop of Mr. Prim the mercer. Prim. Well Mr Twist, what are your commands with me?   Twist. We are come to wait on your honor with the lecturer's book; Sir, (reads) a voluntary contribution of the inhabitants of the parish of St. Paul, Covent Garden -- for the support of --.   Prim. Well well, you need not read any farther; what is it?   Twist. "Whatever you please, Sir.   Prim. Aye, here is another load, another burden; dy'e think I am made of gold? There Is the poor's rate, the doctor's rate, the window rates, the devil's in the rates I think! -- However, I cannot refuse you; -- but I Will not give another year. -- Here, Buckram, reach me half a crown out of the till. Your servant, Madam. -- (a lady comes out of the back parlour, walks through the shop, and gets into a chair) -- Aye, there is another tax, a guinea for two box tickets, as sure as the benefit comes round, for my wife and daughter, besides chair hire.   Twist (shaking his head). O Master Prim, Master Prim! Had not you better now have given us a guinea for the Doctor and his four children, and reserved your half-crown for the lady, who, if I may judge from her garb, does not want it half so much as the poor parson? But you will be in the fashion, so give us your mite. Set down Mr. Prim two shillings and sixpence.   SUCH is the force of example, the influence of fashion, that a constant church-goer, and one perhaps who fancies himself a very good christian, shall throw away one pound one, with all the pleasure imaginable for an evening's entertainment at the theater, and at the same time grudge half a crown for two and fifty discourses from the pulpit; which, if he turns to his arithmetic book, he will see amounts to about three farthings a sermon -- and a sober citizen too, -- as Lady Townly says, -- Fie, Fie!  IN short, such are the mortifications, to which the inferior clergy are exposed, that if I had a son to bring up, and could not give him either a fortune or a good living, I would sooner make a coal-heaver of him than a parson.
