DR. SLASHEM, the vicar's brother in law, to whom I was recommended, received me at his door with apparent civility, but soon gave me to understand that he had reckoned without his host, when he proposed taking an assistant. His school was but of late establishment, two scholars had lest him the day before, and he had no greater number than he could attend to himself; however, out of respect to his brother, he would contrive to give me house-room, till I could find a situation to my liking, and as he understood I was not able to afford great things, provided I would occasionally assist him in school hours, I should not pay for my lodging and board more than fifteen shillings a week. -- I was not so young but I could see the drift of this gentleman's civility; instead of paying me for my assistance, as I expected, I was to pay for my board and lodging, and give him my labor gratis; however, being a stranger in that part of the world, and not knowing where to go, I dissembled in my turn, told him how much I thought myself obliged to him, and accepted his friendly offer. He introduced me to his family, which consisted of a wife, a daughter about seventeen, rather pretty than otherwise, and ten boys between the ages of nine and fourteen. Mrs. Slashem was some years younger than the Doctor, and seemed to look upon her daughter with a jealous eye, and as one who told her she was growing in years. Miss, in her turn, was of a forward cast, and thought she had more right to be noticed than her mother, who was a married woman, and in her time had had her share of admirers: in short, I no sooner entered, than I discovered that both had shot their arrows at me at once. "Biddy," says Mrs. Slashem, I wish you would get down stairs, you stare at the young man as if you never saw a young man before. Ah, get down, you young baggage, says the doctor, and get us something nice for supper. Miss slammed the door after her, but not without giving me to understand by her looks, that she was angry at being sent out of the room. Mrs. Slashem, primming up her mouth, and adjusting her features into an affected form of reserved politeness, hoped I would excuse the awkwardness of her girl, who had seen but little of the world, and had rather out-grown her age; for though in size she resembled a woman, she was, in fact, little more than a child. Indeed, my dear, replies the Doctor, you wrong the girl, for you was married at her age. If I was, retorts the wife angrily, and bridling up, I hope I had more discretion, and more of the woman in me. "Discretion," returns the Doctor, I will say nothing about, but as to the woman, I will admit that you had always enough of that; giving me a wink with his left eye. But come, the young man, I dare say, will be glad of a little refreshment, if you will be kind enough to provide it. For, as we had come a long day's journey, I began to wish for supper, though it was but eight o'clock. Mrs. Slashem retired to provide for our repast, and get the boys to bed, and of course left me and the Doctor together. He then gave me a long detail of the difficulties he had met with in establishing his school. I told him, that no doubt his character had recommended him, and that as he came to be better known, his number of scholars would increase. Character, my good friend, says he, is the least recommendation; parents, nowadays, will put their children out where they have the most taught for the least money. In order to get a good price, schoolmasters are reduced to artifice. Good God! -- Artifice; exclaimed I, can artifice avail where children should be kept strangers to deceit? You misunderstand me, Sir, replies the Doctor, I mean artifice in the establishment of a school. I Will explain it to you, it may be of use to you in life, if you propose to follow the same profession. -- Parents have an idea, that the fewer scholars a man has, the better he can attend to them, and then, of course, he can demand a better price. A man taking only four boys, may expect fifty pounds a year for each, whereas if he takes fourteen, he will find it difficult to get more than twenty. After a man has got one or two to begin with, that he may not be supposed to want scholars, he gives out, that he will take no greater number than four, -- then, he has room for two more: -- he procures them: -- he then finds he can attend to ten, to which number he will confine himself; but that is only till he can get another ten; so that he never stops till in fact he can get no more. In short, he gave me to understand, that by such means, and by a little extra attention and tenderness to those boys as were the children of wealthy parents, who have it frequently in their power to recommend others, it is, that men establish a school sooner than by any other method. Indeed, I found it was his invariable practice to wink at the faults of the boys of opulent, parents, and keep up the strictest discipline with others it being necessary to punish some as an example to the rest: when a poor man's son, charged, perhaps, with robbing the garden, has endeavored to exculpate himself, by discovering the offender, and laying the blame, justly, on his more wealthy, but guilty schoolmate, I have known the Doctor exclaim, It is a barefaced lie, -- Master Goldwire is the son of a gentleman, and above a base act, and I Will punish you for the false assertion. -- Then, as to the annual price of schooling; twenty pounds a year, the Doctor told me, (which, indeed, was the price he had with his scholars) was but small pay; however, what with the profits derived from selling the children toys, fruit, pens, paper, and other articles, at two hundred per cent. gain, getting from each boy half a guinea or a guinea at Christmas, under the idea of presents to the servants, taking their pocket money on their return from the holidays, under a pretense of keeping it for them, and giving them only part of it again; charging in their bills occasionally a pair of shoes, a copy-book, and the like, more than they have had; by such sundry emoluments he made out pretty well. And on my seeming to disapprove of such conduct by my looks, he told me, there was no doing otherwise. It was the annual price of board and schooling to which parents chiefly attended. To be asked thirty pounds a year would frighten them, but under a notion of paying but twenty, the considerations he had mentioned, would draw and additional twenty from them without a murmur: then says he again, we can get a guinea a quarter for dancing, as much for drawing, and fifteen shillings, perhaps, for writing, when in fact we pay to the different masters only half the price we charge. If it was not for these arts and contrivances, a school master had better be a hackney coachman, and drive mules rather than boys. In short, I found from the doctrine of the pedlar, the stage-coachman, and this worthy friend of mine, that to live in the world a man must not be too honest. On the same plan of reasoning, the doctor would have kept me for his assistant; for he expected as much of me, as if he had paid me a salary of thirty pounds a year. I was determined, however, to get from this place as soon as I could; for my remaining stock would not admit of my paying fifteen shillings a week for my board. I had been now a fortnight in the family before I thought of removing, and to do justice to Mrs. Slashem and her daughter, they did every thing in their power to make my time pass agreeably. The mother, in order to have my company abroad, would frequently desire the Doctor to spare me, as it was proper where she was going to have an escort, and miss would frequently steal up into my room when I was alone, play about me, and entertain me with the secret anecdotes of the family; from her I learned that her papa was no doctor, but had assumed the title in order to give credit to the school; that her mama had constantly a gentleman came to see her at school hours, when her papa was at the top of the house with the boys: in short, she told me how much her mama hated her papa, and how much she detested them both, and that she would give the world if any one would take her out of the house; that she did not care where she went, if she was but from home; that her mama treated her as a girl, when she knew she was as much a woman as herself, and that she was going in eighteen, and was determined not to be a great while longer in leading strings. The assiduous attention of the mother would perhaps have been far from disagreeable to me, if miss had been out of my reach; but Mrs. Slashem had insisted, a day or two after my arrival, that I should be made free of the village we lived in, according to the ancient ceremonial of the place; which was, to be sworn upon the horns, not to eat brown bread if I could get white, unless I liked brown better; not to put up with the maid when I could h^^e the mistress, unless I liked the maid better, and so on: and as oaths are not merely confined to the letter, but extend to the spirit of them, I conceived I was equally sworn not to put up with the mother, if I could have the daughter, unless I liked the mother better. Indeed, such was the favor I was in with both, that I was scarcely left to my choice, and a dread of the chapter of accidents, was one principal motive for my wishing myself away. The censorious reader may perhaps suppose, that, as a young man bordering upon twenty, I was no anchorite, and that I was not sufficient master of philosophy, to withstand a temptation thrown industriously in my way; in short, he may suppose -- what he will, -- and as I profess myself a member of the reformed church, and the necessity of auricular confession to be no part of my faith, I shall take the liberty to leave him to his conjectures, and only say, that for more reasons than one, I wished myself in any situation but where I was. I had an opportunity of seeing the newspapers, and I looked carefully to the advertisements, hoping to meet with something that might suit me. My circumstances would not admit of my being very nice in my choice, for though I had near nineteen pounds in my pocket on my arrival at Highgate, after I had paid the coachman and the expenses of the last day's journey; that nineteen, from a triffling present or two to Miss, a few out-door treats to her mother in our afternoon walks, and what I should have to pay for my board and washing, go as soon as I would, would be reduced to little more than ten pounds. This, and a wish for an easy place, determined me, if I could not do better, even to put on a livery, rather than run myself into difficulties, and to wait for a turn of fortune to befriend me. I did not communicate my design to the family, as circumstances had made it necessary to conceal myself from them, but told them I had a friend in London who promised to look out for a situation to place me in; and under a pretense of going to this friend, I had an opportunity of applying, as many advertisements directed me. To a Wanted a smart young man to attend in the shop of an apothecary, I applied, and found it was to open and sweep the shop, pound in the mortar, carry out medicines, and apply glisters; this would not do; it was a laborious employ, and to labor I had not been accustomed. The next advertisement that struck me was, Wanted a man of good figure, in an easy genteel office, with good encouragement: here I enquired, and found there had been a variety of applicants, most men wishing for easy places and good pay. This was no other than to stand all day at the door of one of those auctioneers, who are constantly selling things made up purposely to take in the ignorant and incautious, and with a vociferous voice to call out to every person that passes, Walk in, Sir, walk in gentlemen -- selling by auction. The abilities for this office were little more than a good pair of lungs, and the pay was two shillings a day; as the situation, however, was by no means a concealed one, I readily declined it. The next was more likely to answer my purpose: Wanted a person of good address and gentleman-like appearance, to attend a few hours a day in a respectable employ, for which a good salary would be given. The reader will naturally say, I had no small share of vanity, to attend only to such advertisements as required smartness, good-figure, address, and gentlemanlike appearance; but when he is told that both Mrs. Slashem and Miss had constantly given me to understand, that I was possessed of those qualities, he will not wonder at my believing it. This advertisement succeeded; it was not to stand at the door of one of these auctions, but to act as a decoy during the time of selling, and lead persons on to bid their money. I was to attend from eleven to three in the week days, and my pay was to be eighteen shillings a week. I accepted the place and was to be initiated into my office the week following. Accordingly, I took a lodging in the neighborhood, a two pair of stairs room in the shop of a tradesman, for which I was to pay six shillings a week, and I was determined to make the remaining twelve answer every other purpose. Happy in this engagement, I acquainted the Doctor, that I should now be no longer troublesome to him, that I was going to America in a merchan'ts family, as tutor to his son, a lad of twelve years of age, for which I was to have a handsome salary. Though I had not been six weeks with the Doctor, I found it difficult to get away. He had conceived an affection for me, and rather than part with me, would take half a guinea a week. Mrs. Slashem used all her rhetoric to persuade me to continue, and Miss Slashem all her charms; but nothing would do. I had my private reasons for leaving them, and on my promise to correspond with Miss, as occasion should offer, I was suffered to depart in peace. I had been brought up with proper notions of right and wrong, and could scarce reconcile this deception to my way of thinking, but when I considered the plea of necessity, and that self-preservation was the first law of nature, I was easily led to justify the proceeding. I was master of my own actions, and had not by a promise, made to any of the parties, forfeited a right of disposing of myself as I thought proper.
