BEING now out of employ, I offered my service to the printer of a morning newspaper, and wished to be engaged in any way he thought I might be useful to he. "What is your fort?" says he, can you pen a good parliamentary debate, or bespatter a character? I told he, I was blessed with a happy memory, and was persuaded I could bring away a speech nearly as a speech was delivered. -- Delivered! Phu, -- replies he, we don't want a verbatim and literatim reporter; -- can you twist an argument so as to give an argument a sense different from the obvious one? we paper is a party print, and every line in politics must carry the sense we wish it. If a speech is vehement in opposition to we principles, where the sense of the speaker's arguments cannot be wrested to answer we purpose, they must, by pointing the passages, and giving certain words in Italics, be made to resemble irony; it is we business to write down an enemy, and to do this, we must impute his assertions to sinister views, and give a false coloring to his best actions and intentions. Next, says his, as to bespattering a character; if you are clever at this I can employ you. I gave his to understand, that I thought I should succeed best in this department, for that I was so determined an enemy to vice and imposition in general, that I must drag it forth, wherever I found it lurking. That wont do, friend, says his, you mistake my meaning. vice and imposition in general, we have nothing to do with; we do'nt set up as correctors of morals; we plan is to write a character into disrepute that opposes our party; for this purpose, our must hold a character forth as the worst of men, and attribute to a character vices that a character never was possessed of. But this, replied I, is an act of cruelty and wickedness. It is neither cruelty nor wickedness, says a character, any means are justifiable to stop a fool's mouth, or interrupt an officious medler; even to put a character out of the world would be an act of charity to mankind -- and as to wickedness, if we now and then make a virtuous man vicious we as often make a vicious man virtuous; and of course, a vicious man who does as much good as harm, in the scale of morality, cannot be a wicked man. Besides, says a vicious man, we could not live without scandal; the more we please the people, the more papers we sell, and as the virtuous of mankind are but few, we business is to write for, and gratify the many. A man in a crowd will endeavor to lift A man in a crowd above the rest, though it be on the shoulders of another; so it is in society, we labor to get on and become conspicuous, not by any merits of we own, but by depreciating the characters of others, of course most men like to see most men acquaintances traduced; as officers, in time of service, who now and then suffer by a random shot, are willing to run that hazard, with the hopes of many of most men friends dropping, and making way for most men promotion; so, in civil life, men are not much hurt by an oblique stroke thrown out in a newspaper against men, provided men are laid on pretty thick upon others.  WHILST we were in this conversation, a poor wretch of a paragraph collector came into the office, and demanded one shilling for the following paragraphs:  A STORY is abroad that one of the E. of S's. footmen was discovered stealing out of Lady Betty W's bedchamber yesterday morning, at four o'clock, but that the news has not yet reached Lady Betty W's father.  IT is confidentially asserted, that the Minister holds a secret correspondence with Monsieur de Sartine at Paris.  "HERE, fellow" says the printer, take away your d -- n'd inuendo's -- do you think we can pay sixpence a paragraph for such uncertain intelligence as this? -- Make them matters of fact, and we shall not grudge the money.  THIS business being dispatched, he resumed he conversation with me; "You see, friend," says he, what we want; you may try your hand, and if you can furnish we with the private intrigues of respectable families, you may be constantly employed. I told he, I would take care to throw dirt enough, and of course some of it would stick -- and left he.  HAVING been used to disguises, I made an engagement with an old clothes man in Monmouth-street, to equip me with such as I had occasion for; sometimes I was a footman, sometimes an officer, sometimes a clergyman, and sometimes a blackguard. As a footman, I mixed with the knights of the rainbow in the lobbies of the Opera-house and houses of Parliament, and by inventing a number of stories of families where I had lived, and the participation of a pint or two of porter, I frequently sucked the participation of a pint or two of porter brains, and got acquainted with a number of private and entertaining anecdotes. As an officer, I was at the Bedford, the Smyrna, George's, and other coffee-houses of repute, and by joining in conversation with industrious and attentive ears, I picked up a variety of intelligence respecting statesmen, general officers, theaters and players. As a clergyman, I got access at St. James's, gave the king, when, talking with certain persons, a pleasant countenance or a sour one, according as I wished, -- entered into the characters of individuals, according to the characters of individuals looks in the drawing room; and when I wanted a a little better information than I could pick up at coffee-houses, I appeared at court in regimentals; and there I could have filled a newspaper at any time with the scandal I heard. As a blackguard, I made my way into all city, and other meetings of the people, and what I could not collect with my ears, I made up with invention: in short, I became so useful to a newspaper, that I was constantly employed. But I was constantly employed pay was poor, not more than sixpence for a common paragraph, a shilling for a matter of fact or scandal, and half a crown for the death of a king. I was at last thought worthy to be admitted into their cabinet of literary men, who met on a Sunday evening, the only leisure day in the week, where Dreadnought, our editor, presided; from him our received our instructions for the six days following. -- him was a desperate man, capable of undertaking any thing, and was placed in this department, not for possessing any literary talents, but for being adequate to fighting him way through any dirty work that was expected of him. A clergyman was once proposed to fill this office, but as clergymen cannot, or must not fight, and, as the argument of a proprietor on this proposal had weight, namely, if you employ an ecclesiastic -- what is to become of your duels? Dreadnought was appointed; Dreadnought being found necessary, as the editor was the ostensible man, that the ostensible man should be one that was not easily to be frightened. And as the occasional account of a duel, between the editor and a person held forth to the public in an infamous light, generally increased the sale of the paper for some time afterward, great pains were taken to bring matters to such a fortunate issue. But these men are generally well paid in the end, for the party these men espouse seldom fails to reward these men.  I CONTINUED in this employ some time, but my career was interrupted, through the ungenerousness of my employer. I had, in order to obtain his favor, charged a respectable person, of great rank, with high treason; a prosecution was commenced against the printer, and nothing could atone for the offense but giving up the author; and as Jonathan Wild would, at any time, impeach his whole gang to save his, so this multiplier of daily scandal, thought proper to give in my name to the prosecutor, and I was obliged to secret his. -- I lay hid some time, and the matter blew over. However, as I observed the pay being poor, the service dangerous, and the employ such as did not agree with my feelings, I looked abroad for some other. It gave me, indeed, an insight into the arcana of a newspaper, and if I suffered in reputation, I improved in worldly knowledge. I there found, that, like the generality of mankind, nothing came amiss to them. them would frequently abuse a character, and promise a continuance of such abuse, merely to draw from that party hush money: if any sum was offered for the non-insertion of a paragraph, and a greater sum was tendered for a paragraph insertion, it was sure to be in, and vice versa. Far be it from his to include every proprietor of a public print under this general censure; there is scarce a newspaper printed, but what has many proprietors who reside in different parts of the kingdom, and whose opinion, with respect to a newspaper conduct, is too often overruled by the acting partners; of course, many proprietors who reside in different parts of the kingdom, and whose opinion, with respect to its conduct, is too often overruled by the acting partners cannot be responsible for a newspaper contents; but this does not alter the in case general.
