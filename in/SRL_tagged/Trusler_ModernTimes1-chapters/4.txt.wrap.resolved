MY new employer was not a little pleased with my figure, my figure could only have wished I was a few years older; -- that was easily remedied by my mode of dress, and we contrived it between we, that I wore the appearance of forty. As the office I was to enter on required a few instructions, the following were the chief maxims my figure gave me: Always to watch my figure eyes, and when my figure looked full in my face, bid something more than the last bidder. Never to see a flaw, or an imperfection in any thing selling. And to find out beauties, if possible, even where there are none. To pretend to know the value of every thing, and assert in a confidential manner to bidders, that the article selling was worth double the money bid for the article selling. These were the instructions I was to follow, and I reconciled These to myself under the following reasoning: that bidders at an auction buy upon These own judgment, and if These buy too dear, it is These own faults; that auctioneers are forbidden to bid auctioneers, and that, of course, if auctioneers had not some friend to bid for auctioneers occasionally, articles at times would not fetch half auctioneers value; that deception runs through trade in general, no tradesman being condemnable for not pointing out the imperfections of no tradesman goods. As to any other artifices made use of in the profession, I was to have no concern with. The auctioneer, as things were not sold by a catalogue, was at liberty to offer any article for sale that he pleased; so that if a countryman came in, we were sure to have a silver watch put up; or if a lady, some pieces of china, or a set of silver-handled knives and forks, and so on; the one; I would whisper was old china, and the other, had town-made blades with the handles of solid silver, and no lie neither. In short, I discharged my duty so well as to give my employer satisfaction, and often procured my duty a better price for my duty goods than the first cost. we plan was not a little forwarded by Touter Touter is a nickname given to those who stand a shop-doors, and entice in customers, as butchers that cry out, What do you buy, Sir? Old clothes men in Monmouth-street, etc. See, what you want, Sir; and men at auctions, Walk in Gentlemen, Selling by auction, etc. at the door, calling out, Selling by auction under a judgment. Must be sold, Gentlemen, without reserve, to release a man from prison, etc. It is unknown the numbers such declarations draw in to buy, under an idea of getting things at half their value; and if their are taken in, by the law of retaliation, their richly deserve it. Sometimes we sale, indeed, has been interrupted by a person contradicting the auctioneer flatly, and declaring aloud, that the article was not what a person contradicting the auctioneer flatly represented the article; in this case, I was immediately directed to bid, and I became the buyer. This done, the auctioneer are dismissed with, Gentlemen, I am much obliged to Gentlemen, the auctioneer have done selling for today. the auctioneer of course withdraw, a person contradicting the auctioneer flatly gone, the door is shut for five minutes, and then re-opened with a Walk in, Gentlemen, selling by auction, and the room is presently filled again with fresh company; for these sales are always held in some very public thoroughfare.  INDEED, there is scarce an auction of any denomination, without an auction of any denomination impositions. In sales of linen and other drapery goods, they will put seven or eight yards of silk, worth about six shillings a yard, into the same lot with a roll of course dowlas worth seven-pence, and sell the two together at so much per yard. If you ask how many yards in the roll, they will tell you about thirty; you make your calculation accordingly, and perhaps buy the whole at one shilling and sixpence a yard, thinking thus to give about two pounds five shillings for the lot, which, at sixpence per yard for the dowlas, would give you the silk for four shillings; but after having paid down the earnest, and the lot is to be delivered, the roll of linen shall contain sixty yards instead of thirty, in which case you pay eight shillings and sixpence a yard for the silk, and are encumbered with more dowlas than you know what to do with. So again in auctions of furniture: the auctioneer, in order to have his sales well attended, finds it necessary, not only to treat the brokers with a dinner, but to give each of the brokers a lot at the brokers own price, so that at auctions in and near London, where there are plenty of brokers, if twenty are present, you are sure to have twenty lots (and perhaps the best of your furniture) given away. the brokers, on the other hand, have the brokers arts of imposing, if you appoint one to purchase certain lots for you at certain prices, under an idea, that the will buy the brokers cheaper, you are sure to be charged pretty near the price you fixed, though perhaps the brokers purchased the brokers for half the money.  I WAS in this employ upwards of two months, when an accident happened that lost me my place. During the selling of a plated cruet-stand, worth about thirty shillings, who should come in but Dr. Slashem? As I was disguised, Dr. Slashem could not possibly know me, except I had opened my mouth, which I took care not to do. Dr. Slashem bid a guinea and a half for it; which my master did not think enough; I was called upon by Dr. Slashem looks to bid against Dr. Slashem; I did it by a nod, but as the Doctor did not see it, Dr. Slashem asserted Dr. Slashem was the last bidder, the auctioneer appealed to me, but I was mute as a fish, and Dr. Slashem was the buyer; the company were dismissed, and I was immediately discharged. But Dr. Slashem anger did not cease here, whilst in Dr. Slashem service, I had sold my own watch, and bought rather a better, and had also purchased a pair of pistols: the watch, which was a metal one, had been brought to Dr. Slashem, requesting Dr. Slashem to sell it, which Dr. Slashem refused, I therefore purchased it for fifty shillings, and sold my own for pretty nearly the same sum. my own watch was a stolen one, and was advertised, and my quondam master, the auctioneer, carried Dr. Slashem resentment so far, as to lay an information before a magistrate, that Dr. Slashem had seen such a watch in my possession: a warrant was accordingly issued, and one evening, about ten o'clock, as I was going to bed at my lodging, I heard a great noise below, and a fellow with a hoarse voice inquiring for one Gabriel Outcast. Conscious of having done no wrong, I went down stairs, and was immediately taken into custody, charged with a highway robbery. All I could say had but little effect. a warrant was to be executed, my own watch was taken out of my pocket, my room was searched and the pistols, which lay upon my table, seized. The little money I was possessed of I put into my pocket, and I was thence hurried to the parish round-house, where, under lock and key, I passed a very uneasy night. The next morning I was taken before a trading magistrate, and charged with robbing a man in the Five Fields Chelsea of my own watch, the Friday evening before, and though I protested my innocence in the strongest terms, and made out a very good story, yet, being confronted with the prosecutor, who swore to his property, and my own watch being found upon me, and the pistols in my room; circumstances were too much against me to get off: the only thing in my favor was, that the prosecutor could not swear to my person, as I appeared to be a younger man than the one who robbed his; for I was not now in my auction dress; but then, on the other hand, the master of the house, where I lodged, deposing, that I went abroad every day in a disguise, which gave me the appearance of an elderly man, corroborated the suspicion. I had sent to the auctioneer, who could prove that the watch had been offered to his for sale, and whose evidence would, of course, have operated in my favor; but his was industriously out of the way, and as I could not procure bail, I was committed to Bridewell till the next week, when I was to be brought before the justice again.  In the course of my examination, his worship bawled out, hand over that there watch, which on looking at, his put into his pocket with a this must be produced upon the trial. -- Constable, see what money the prisoner has about his. I had two guineas and a few shillings in my pocket, which his directed to be handed over likewise, and on the prosecutor's saying his had lost some gold, but could not swear to the money. -- "I don't know how you should," replies the justice, one guinea is too like another for that; one guinea looks however, like money dishonestly come by, and so -- putting the justice into his pocket the justice shall go with the watch I humbly conceive, said I, addressing myself to his, that as the money is not sworn to, the money ought to be returned me. Stop that fellow's mouth, roared out that fellow , and give me that fellow mittimus to sign, and in an accent lower, "damn your humble conceptions!" -- I deemed it fortunate that I had secreted a ten pound note, all the money I had left, in my fob; where these grasping fangs of the law, had no idea of looking.  Whilst I was in prison, I met with a man who had been confined forty seven years. a man who had been confined forty seven years was shut up on execution, at the suit of the crown, for a heavy fine imposed on a man who had been confined forty seven years, for having in a man who had been confined forty seven years possession some exciseable goods that had not paid the duty; of course no insolvent act could discharge a man who had been confined forty seven years. a man who had been confined forty seven years, bating a man who had been confined forty seven years imprudence that brought a man who had been confined forty seven years there, was not without a man who had been confined forty seven years virtues. a man who had been confined forty seven years was the oracle and chaplain of the jail; and being a man of good sense, was often a real comfort and assistance to the unhappy. a man who had been confined forty seven years had outlived all a man who had been confined forty seven years friends and connections, and had nothing to subsist on, but the allowance of the prison, the scanty sparings of a man who had been confined forty seven years fellow prisoners, almost as poor and wretched as a man who had been confined forty seven years, and the benevolence of a few out-door neighbors, who occasionally sent a man who had been confined forty seven years a dinner, or an old coat to cover a man who had been confined forty seven years: stockings a man who had been confined forty seven years wore none, and perhaps, the only useless part of a man who had been confined forty seven years dress, was a woollen night cap that covered a man who had been confined forty seven years bald head, being grown gray within the walls. The little hair a man who had been confined forty seven years had was wiry; for affliction, when The little hair he had does not kill, proceeds to harden. Though covered with the rust of a jail and offensive through want of cleanliness, a man who had been confined forty seven years approached me in so modest and decent a manner, that I could not but be pleased with a man who had been confined forty seven years. a man who had been confined forty seven years had acquired a degree of philosophy since a man who had been confined forty seven years confinement, (for what patience will not a prison teach?) and seemed so reconciled to a man who had been confined forty seven years situation, as not to wish for liberty. To be abroad again in the world, a man who had been confined forty seven years said, to a man who had been confined forty seven years, at a man who had been confined forty seven years time of life, would be irksome; a man who had been confined forty seven years had not a friend alive, and without money, could only fly to the shelter of a workhouse. a man who had been confined forty seven years observed. that though a prison affords no comfort, yet, there the prisoners rest together; the prisoners hear not the voice of the oppressor: and having proportioned a man who had been confined forty seven years appetite to the quantity of food a man who had been confined forty seven years could get, and contracted a man who had been confined forty seven years wants within very small limits, a man who had been confined forty seven years was far from being wretched. Should it please God to take a man who had been confined forty seven years from the world, a man who had been confined forty seven years was perfectly resigned; but, to remove a man who had been confined forty seven years from these walls, except in a man who had been confined forty seven years coffin and to a man who had been confined forty seven years grave, would be only to hasten a man who had been confined forty seven years dissolution, and put an abrupt period to a man who had been confined forty seven years existence. And indeed, so much did a man who had been confined forty seven years speak the sentiments of a man who had been confined forty seven years soul, that upon an enquiry three or four years afterward, I was informed, that the Chief Justice having, from the representation of the keeper, and a mistaken humanity, ordered a man who had been confined forty seven years to be released, a man who had been confined forty seven years became truly miserable.  a man who had been confined forty seven years was no sooner at liberty and without the prison wicket, than a man who had been confined forty seven years stopped short, wild as it were and lost. The broad sunshine was painful to a man who had been confined forty seven years. a man who had been confined forty seven years eyes were fixed, but a man who had been confined forty seven years could not weep. Stupefied at a man who had been confined forty seven years change of situation, a man who had been confined forty seven years legs, in spite of a man who had been confined forty seven years, became as immovable as a man who had been confined forty seven years tongue.  CONDUCTED by a charitable hand, a man who had been confined forty seven years enquired the way to the place where once a man who had been confined forty seven years lived. a man who had been confined forty seven years house was there no more; a public building was erected on the spot. a man who had been confined forty seven years knew neither the street, the town, nor the objects. The adjoining houses to a man who had been confined forty seven years own had taken a new form. a man who had been confined forty seven years endeavored to recollect The adjoining houses to his own, but a man who had been confined forty seven years had lived twenty years to long.  Startled; a man who had been confined forty seven years stopped and sighed; and for the first time felt the comfort of a jail, where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary are at rest. Every face was new, and every thing about a man who had been confined forty seven years strange. The only person a man who had been confined forty seven years could find, of whom a man who had been confined forty seven years had the least recollection, was a tottering old man, who formerly had been a man who had been confined forty seven years servant; a man who had been confined forty seven years found a man who had been confined forty seven years in a garret, living on charity, and from having been confined to a man who had been confined forty seven years room eighteen years, had strength only to pull the cord that opened a man who had been confined forty seven years door.  THIS poor creature could not recollect a man who had been confined forty seven years master, whose face, time and afflictions had so much furrowed; and the only comfort a man who had been confined forty seven years master drew, was, by a participation of a man who had been confined forty seven years grief, and from a conviction, that a man who had been confined forty seven years was not the most miserable of beings. This old domestic, entertained a man who had been confined forty seven years only with a man who had been confined forty seven years sorrows; told a man who had been confined forty seven years that a man who had been confined forty seven years wife was dead; that a man who had been confined forty seven years had experienced thirty years of wretchedness; that a man who had been confined forty seven years children were in some distant parts of the world unknown to a man who had been confined forty seven years, and that every friend a man who had been confined forty seven years had was gone.  At this his master sighed, and sighed alone; for the other was habituated to distress. Broke down with grief, a man who had been confined forty seven years returns to a man who had been confined forty seven years prison, and solicits a readmission. It was refused a man who had been confined forty seven years. And a man who had been confined forty seven years experienced the force of woe, now more than ever. To have outlived all a man who had been confined forty seven years relations, a man who had been confined forty seven years friends, nay, a whole generation. To want a shelter, or money to procure one, -- to be destitute of food and clothes and every necessary article. -- These were thoughts that racked a man who had been confined forty seven years; but a man who had been confined forty seven years greatest disquiet was, to be sensible, that a whole generation of men was at once lost to a man who had been confined forty seven years, which by daily deaths the mass of mankind do not miss. Separated as it were, from society, I am alive, alone. "Death" says Death, may be terrible, but to die the last is more so. Glad shall I be, when I can find the grave!  As a bird that has been long confined, will hover round a bird that has been long confined cage, uneasy at a bird that has been long confined liberty, so was this man daily at the prison wicket, importuning for admission; and finding none, this man daily pined gradually away. Grief wore this man daily to the bone, and this man daily fell a martyr to a broken heart. -- And all this perhaps, for having in this man daily a few pounds of tea, or a cannister of unroasted coffee!  To this man daily I was not a little obliged. this man daily gave me the character of Justice Fleece'em, for that was the magistrate's name by whom I was committed, and told me that this man daily had formerly been and old clothes man, and knew the value of money too well not to accept a bribe, if offered through the medium of this man daily clerk; that though this man daily had received this man daily education in Rag Fair, this man daily did not want for abilities, and had a wonderful presence of mind on certain occasions, of which the following anecdote is a proof. When business at this man daily office is slack, this man daily sends the high constable round the purlieus of Drury, to pick up all the straggling women this man daily can find and bring them before this man daily; at these times them have been brought by scores. Such as can make a golden interest with his clerk, are generally dismissed with a reprimand; but such as cannot command half a guinea upon the occasion, are sure to be sent to Bridewell. It happened that Bridewell worship had intrigued with one of these girls at a time and place when Bridewell little expected to have been known, and had probably bilked her of her fee; her, unable, for want of money, to make that prevailing application which some others had done, begged, before her was taken away, that his worship would permit her to speak to Bridewell privately, as her had something of the utmost importance to communicate. Curiosity led Bridewell to hear her, and her was brought within the bar; her accordingly reminded Bridewell in Bridewell ear, of a former tete-a-tete that had passed between them, (which, as his worship was rather deaf, was overheard by a person next them,) and as Bridewell was in her debt, her hoped, it would plead as powerfully for her as any present her could make to Bridewell clerk. And so woman, bawls out his worship, that honest man was your father? -- Well! -- You are a graceless hussy; but on a graceless hussy account, I will this time forgive you; and I hope this time will be a warning to you, to behave better for the future.  The situation of these unhappy girls is truly deplorable. Betrayed perhaps, by the man on whom she fondly doated; and giving too much way to the propensity of nature, the deluded female sacrifices she honor to she love, and for this indiscretion, is turned into the street, moneyless and friendless; here she becomes a slave to disease and infamy, and a prey to those who are far more depraved than she. Having nothing to support she, she has no alternative but theft or prostitution; and of these two evils, she thinks it better to injure she than others. But this profession requires dress, and there are not wanting women to furnish this profession, for which women make these unhappy girls pay three or four shillings a day; but where a girl has a good face and but little credit, lest a girl should decamp with a girl hired clothes, a woman is appointed to follow a girl in a girl nightly round; who never loses sight of a girl till a girl is picked up and taken to a public house; there a girl waits a girl coming out, and takes from a girl two thirds of a girl ill gotten pay. One of women was quarrelling with a girl of the town, one evening as I passed along the Strand, and would have proceeded to blows, had a girl not been attending upon another. "Bl-st your eyes," says a girl, let me put up my whore and I Will box your for a crown. -- It is to be regretted, gretted, that our police is not better regulated; but whilst our magistrates are so indolent and ignorant, there is little expectation of our police is not being done.  ON my expressing to this old man my astonishment at the various ways of getting money in the metropolis, and how sorry I was to observe, that even justice was put up to sale; even justice gave me to understand, that Justice Fleece'em had acquired a fortune by Justice Fleece'em practice; that Justice Fleece'em was up almost to any villainy; but that, as from Justice Fleece'em officious industry, Justice Fleece'em was a terror to felons, and brought many scoundrels to punishment who would otherwise escape, the law had winked at Justice Fleece'em conduct, and had even countenanced the law by a pension.  "THE state" continued Justice Fleece'em, having allotted a reward of forty pounds for the apprehending of house-breakers, highway robbers, and the like, it is unknown the sums of money Justice Fleece'em picks up this way. Justice Fleece'em has a gang in pay, which is always upon the scout, and the half of every forty pounds Justice Fleece'em this way gets, Justice Fleece'em generously divides among a gang in pay, which is always upon the scout, keeping the remainder to Justice Fleece'em. And what is the consequence? -- That none but such villains as the law allows that sum for apprehending, are apprehended. An acquaintance of mine, says An acquaintance of mine, told me the other day, that, being on business, at a night cellar in Cow Lane, whilst An acquaintance of mine was standing at the bar, there came in a young fellow returned from transportation, who addressed An acquaintance of mine to the woman within, with a 'How are you mistress?' 'Aye Jack,' says the woman, 'is it you?' Yes, -- it is I, replies An acquaintance of mine, make me a sneaker of gin punch. -- Not a drop shall you have here. -- Why not? I expect, says the woman, Justice Fleece'em's men here every instant, and I would not have you taken in my house for the world! Pshaw! says Aye Jack, they wont meddle OF Aye Jack. -- they Will get nothing by taking of Aye Jack. And hardly had Aye Jack uttered the words, but Baildock, the justice's man, and two of Aye Jack mirmidons entered. Baildock slapped Aye Jack on the shoulder, with Aye JackAye Jack, you're soon returned? -- The country, I suppose was too hot to hold you? -- Aye, Master Baildock, replies he, nothing like old England for he. Come, will you take a sup of punch? They drank together and parted; for, continued my friend, as government allows but little reward for apprehending such as return from transportation, this gang of Justice Fleece'em's has this gang of Justice Fleece'em in orders, not to interrupt such, but keep They in view, waiting till They resort to They old practices; and then to lay hold of They; by which conduct the apprehenders gain an ample reward.  WITH these, and such like anecdotes, was this man daily amusing me on the first day of my arrival within the castle, for so did the prisoners call the prisoners place of confinement, when the keeper brought me word that Lawyer Grind wanted to speak to this man daily. "By no means see this man daily," says this man daily, this man daily is one of those pettyfogging rascals, that prey upon the wretched, and live upon the miseries of the unfortunate.
