I WAS now once more master of myself, and had an employment to seek; but was very low in cash, so low, that I could not remain long out of place. I had recourse again to the newspapers, and applied as the following advertisement directed me: Wanted a smart young man as footman to a lady. a lady lived in a well-furnished house, in a genteel street at the west end of the town; I went in the morning, and was introduced to a lady whilst at a lady breakfast. A^ I was pretty well dressed, and came into the room perhaps in a manner different from what footmen in general do, a lady rose from a lady seat, and when I told a lady I waited on a lady in consequence of a lady advertisement, a lady seemed rather confused, and said, a lady presumed, that either I did not apply for myself, or that a lady place would be below my acceptance, for that a lady servant must wear a livery. I told a lady, an overthrow in life had humbled my mind, and reconciled an overthrow in life to any situation that was not dishonest or laborious, and that as to wearing the livery of a lady, it was what my superiors would be proud of. a lady seemed to smile at my answer, and doubt my sincerity, and freely acknowledged that my manner and language would do credit to a gentleman. a lady asked me if I had ever lived in the capacity of a servant? I told a lady, I had, and should be happy to be here is. A very few words further passed between us, a lady condescended to say, a lady was so pleased with my appearance that a lady should inquire no further about me, I carried too much honesty in my face to need any other recommendation. a lady said, a lady had engaged a servant, but that a lady would put a servant off, and take me in a servant stead; that a lady place was not a fatiguing one, it was little more than to wait upon a lady, and that if I would accept of it with eighteen guineas a year, and a livery, I might come as soon as I pleased. I bowed an assent, and told a lady, I would attend a lady the Monday following. a lady gave me a direction to a lady tailor, in order to get a new livery, and desired I would make my first appearance in it. -- a new livery was white, faced and lined with pale blue, silver buttons and epaulet, with a waistcoat of the color of the facings, laced with silver, blue plush breeches, and silver laced hat; and her tailor having made it smart, and to fit me exactly, paid me the compliment to say, that I rather graced a new livery, than the livery me, and among all the servants he had dressed, he had never seen one that became he clothes so well. It is rather an awkward task to be under the necessity of sounding one's own praise, but as the reader can hear nothing of one who writes he own life, but from the mouth of he who guides the pen, and as he may wish to have some little description of my person, the following is the simplest account I can give. I was, at the time I am now speaking of, a strait well-made man, five feet nine inches high, of a middling size, neither too corpulent nor too thin, just turned of twenty, dark hair, and a great deal of it, had a good set of teeth, and if glasses told truth, a speaking countenance, and a penetrating eye. I was given to understand, that I had a graceful figure, an insinuating address, and the manner of a gentleman; with these perfections and accomplishments, and the education I had received, with a good flow of spirits, and sanguine health, it must have been wonderful had I not pushed on through life as well as I have done. I must own that whenever I fell, it was through the impetuosity of passions, the heedlessness of youth, or want of worldly knowledge. I set out with very few expectations, and fewer friends; but I had philosophy enough to acquire a certain degree of fortitude, and was determined to be a cosmopolite, and take the world as it goes.  HAVING arranged my little matters at the house where I lodged, I dressed my hair in the most fashionable manner, which from custom I was expert at, put on a ruffled shirt, silk stockings, and a pair of Artois buckles; and when I surveyed myself in the glass, dressed as I was in my new clothes, I thought myself a complete coxcomb: however, as I flattered myself, from the livery my mistress gave, and my mistress being pleased with my appearance, my mistress would not like me the worse for that; I sent my trunk to my mistress by a porter on the Monday I had promised to go, and followed my trunk soon after myself.  my mistress was a woman about forty years of age, that seemed to have been handsome in my mistress youth; my mistress figure was rather her figure bon point, and my mistress passed for a widow under the name of Duplex. On my coming to my mistress , my mistress sent for myself up stairs, and I could perceive, was not a little pleased with the figure I made. my mistress told me that I became my livery exceedingly well, that my mistress kept a boy to clean shoes and knives, and that all my mistress expected of myself, was to wait at table, and attend upon my mistress. Having inquired my name, "Gabriel," says my mistress, you seem to be a young man of uncommon good sense, I presume I need not tell you, that servants should carry nothing out of the families servants live with, nor see any thing servants ought not to see. If you attend to this, and are industrious and civil, you will find me exceedingly good to you.  I HAD not been a fortnight in the house where I lodged before I discovered that my mistress was one of those convenient obliging women, who administered to the pleasures of others. my mistress was not, is the true sense of the word, a procuress, nor did my mistress keep ladies of easy virtue under the roof with my mistress; but my mistress was rather in the style of a private bagnio, where men of fortune might find an asylum with men of fortune ladies, for an hour, a night, or a week, as it suited men of fortune. my mistress had not the least conception of my finding this out, the parties that came, having always passed for my mistress friends, and my fellow servants, who had not my penetration, were kept in the dark. I might, if I pleased, have continued long in the service of my mistress, had not an event taken place which gave birth to a variety of future embarrassments in the course of my life. my mistress was particularly kind to me, and would familiarly converse with me all the time I was waiting on my mistress. my mistress took some pains to draw me aside from the narrow path of rectitude, and gave me many broad hints of the favors my mistress had in store for me. my mistress would frequently ring the bell and call me to my mistress toilet, even before my mistress had well adjusted my mistress dress; ask my opinion of female beauty, and often desire me to tell my mistress, whether my mistress handkerchief was put on to advantage. "Gabriel," says my mistress one day to me, leering under my mistress hat, -- You cannot have been in many places; pretty young fellows like you, are soon taken out of servitude. You shall not wear a livery long, but shall be groom of my bedchamber. -- What say you Gabriel? Should you like such an office? -- I plainly saw at what my mistress directed my mistress artillery; but my mistress was a woman that did not please me, and I will be honest enough to own, that aversion had more weight with me than principle. my mistress was at all times very inquisitive about my family and connexions, and was very importunate to know where I acquired those accomplishments, my mistress was pleased to say I possessed; but, as I did not mean to continue longer with my mistress than I could help, I was reserved in my answers, and respectful, though very distant, in my replies. my mistress told me, my mistress expected a young lady from the country in a day or two, to be with my mistress some time; that a family difference would oblige my mistress to leave home, and that my mistress being with my mistress was to be a secret; of course, if I could keep a close mouth, I should be amply rewarded; and that I was by no means to communicate to my fellow servants, any thing I might hear or see above stairs. I replied, that my mistress might rely on my fidelity, with which my mistress seemed satisfied. I was the more displeased with my mistress, as I conceived my mistress to be of a profession, the most destructive to female virtue, and the greatest bane to domestic happiness of any existing. The pride of many an honest family had been overthrown, I understood, by my mistress; and many a virtuous girl had owed my mistress ruin to my mistress officiousness. That there are many of my mistress stamp in the great metropolis is too evident to be doubted, and that they are not made public examples of, is very much to be lamented! The young lady my mistress mentioned, was brought to our house one morning, by a gentleman in a hackney coach. my mistress appeared to be about seventeen, and was one of the prettiest young women, I think, I ever beheld; with such a sweetness of expression and such a virgin modesty about my mistress, as attracted all my attention, and made me instantly conceive something treacherous in my mistress story. a gentleman in a hackney coach, seemed to be a man of fashion about thirty years of age, and I could see, that on his introducing my mistress to my mistress, my mistress had never seen my mistress before. The affair appeared to me mysterious, I felt me, some how or other interested in my mistress cause, and was determined, if my mistress was incautiously seduced into our house, to watch my mistress virtue with as much care and assiduity, as if my mistress had been my sister. a gentleman in a hackney coach dined with my mistress, staid the greatest part of the day, but left my mistress in the evening. a gentleman in a hackney coach continued a gentleman in a hackney coach visits, in like manner, the next day and the day after, and during the times I was waiting on them, I could discover nothing more than that industrious attention, which polite men generally pay to the object of them affections. my mistress seemed to take a more than common notice of me, and observed to my mistress, which I overheard, when in the next room, that my mistress was persuaded from my manner, that I must have been brought up a gentleman. Things went on pretty smooth for two or three days, when my mistress took an opportunity to go out, and left Things to Things. Things drank tea alone, and I waited at tea, and nothing happened to increase my suspicions till about nine in the evening, when I heard a clattering of the chairs, and Things voices rather louder than ordinary. This put me upon the watch, and presently I heard my mistress scream with all my mistress powers. I instantly flew up stairs, darted into the next room, and found my mistress fainting on the sopha, and he in a situation better conceived than described, but very declaratory of he wicked intentions. On seeing me enter the next room, he seized me by the collar, with Rascal, who sent for you? Get out of the next room this instant or I Will be the death of you; catching hold of he sword, which he drew. I told he my mistress seemed to need protection, and I would defend my mistress with my life. The poor young creature, that moment recovering my mistress senses, begged of me, for God's sake, to continue with my mistress, and save my mistress from ruin. a gentleman in a hackney coach, on the other hand, in the utmost rage and pushing me from a gentleman in a hackney coach, insisted on my leaving the next room or a gentleman in a hackney coach would run me through the body; and finding me determined not to obey a gentleman in a hackney coach injunctions, unarmed as I was, a gentleman in a hackney coach made a lunge at me, which having parried with my hand, I closed in upon a gentleman in a hackney coach and disarmed a gentleman in a hackney coach. my mistress screamed and fainted again, and my mistress ravisher took up her hat, hurried down stairs, and made the best of my mistress way out of our house. my mistress was no sooner gone, than I assisted my mistress with some hartshorn, which I found on the mantle-piece, and brought my mistress to my mistress speech. Seeing my mistress free from my mistress violator, my mistress called me, my mistress deliverer, thanked me, in the warmest terms, for standing forth in my mistress defense, and hoped I was not hurt; for when my mistress saw my mistress draw my mistress sword, my mistress expected nothing less than my murder. I told my mistress I was no way hurt but to see my mistress so ill-treated, that my mistress had endeavored to run his sword through me, but, that from some knowledge I had of the use of that weapon, I had escaped the threatened mischief, and had disarmed my mistress; that my mistress had left me in possession of his sword and was gone, and that I esteemed me singularly happy in having been my mistress protector. my mistress rose from the sopha, walked across the next room to a chair, and begged me by no means to leave my mistress, but to sit down and concert some means with my mistress, of getting my mistress out of that house, which, from many circumstances my mistress suspected to be of no reputation. my mistress told me, that my mistress was the daughter of a private gentleman of good family and fortune, that my mistress name was Wildman, that the person who had so treated my mistress, was a man of rank who had solicited my mistress hand in marriage; but a man of rank who had solicited her hand in marriage father being alive, and a man of rank who had solicited her hand in marriage not being able to make a sufficient settlement on my mistress, his father had opposed the match; that this gentleman, however, having gained my mistress affections, my mistress had been so imprudent as to leave my mistress home, and come here with a man of rank who had solicited her hand in marriage, as into the house of a friend; where she was the daughter of a private gentleman of good family and fortune, that her name was Wildman, that the person who had so treated her, was a man of rank who had solicited her hand in marriage were privately to be married and wait the reconciliation of his father; that under a variety of frivolous pretenses a man of rank who had solicited her hand in marriage had delayed the ceremony and my mistress now saw the drift of a man of rank who had solicited her hand in marriage base intentions; that a man of rank who had solicited her hand in marriage conduct had at once obliterated every spark of my mistress attachment, and that, if possible, my mistress now hated a man of rank who had solicited her hand in marriage more than ever my mistress loved a man of rank who had solicited her hand in marriage. This being her story, my mistress asked me what I thought my mistress had best do? I told my mistress frankly, that I thought the sooner my mistress was out of our house the better, for reasons, if my mistress pleased, I would hereafter give my mistress; that as my mistress seemed determined not to pursue the motives that led my mistress to leave his father's house, namely, that of giving my mistress hand to a man who had such designing views upon my mistress honor, I would by all means advise my mistress to return, acknowledge my mistress indiscretion to his father, and as his father would now, from what had passed, have no reason to dread my mistress elopement with the same person in future, I flattered my mistress his father would readily forgive my mistress. This advice my mistress immediately closed with, and was anxious to leave our house before my mistress returned; I encouraged the step, told my mistress, if my mistress thought proper, I would fetch a coach from the stand, at the end of the street, and attend my mistress home. my mistress agreed to this; I called a coach, handed my mistress into this, in the presence of two of the maidservants who were standing in the passage, and having privately told the coachman, to drive to Berkley-square where his father lived; I got up behind and a coach drove from the door.  WHEN we were got two or three streets length from our house, my mistress stopped a coach, and begged to speak to my mistress. It was to direct me to knock but a single rap at the door, and to tell the servant that opened it, that my mistress wished his father not to know of my mistress return, till my mistress had seen my mistress mother. When we reached our house, I obeyed my mistress directions; my mistress parted with my mistress at the door, but desired me not to say who my mistress was, nor where I had left my mistress; and if I could get out in the morning, that I would be with my mistress between eleven and twelve. On my return home I found my mistress was above, and that my mistress was extremely angry with the steps I had taken. As soon as my mistress heard I was in our house, the bell was rung, and I appeared before my mistress. "Gabriel," says my mistress, with warmth, what is this you have done? -- Where have you left my mistress? I gave my mistress a particular account of every thing that I knew had happened in my mistress absence; and as I had determined to quit my mistress service, I gave my mistress to understand, that my mistress had a great deal to answer for; that from the story my mistress had told me, prior to my mistress's coming to our house, I was convinced that my mistress was privy to the scheme laid for my mistress destruction, and that I esteemed my mistress particularly fortunate in being the cause of our house prevention. Where have you carried my mistress to? says my mistress. -- That Ma'am, replied I, I am not at liberty to divulge; my mistress is, I trust, in safe hands, and out of the way of any similar danger. Harkye, Gabriel, says my mistress, you may possibly think yourself exceedingly clever, but I must tell you that you are a very impudent fellow, to take any such liberties in a house where you are only a servant. But I deserve it, in taking you without a character; the only thing that vexes me is, that I should have been at any expense for so worthless a scoundrel. However, strip and turn out, you shall not lay another night under my roof. my mistress, replied I, was you to reflect a moment, you would be careful not to irritate one that has you so much in his power; if it was not for the means it has afforded me of rescuing a deluded young lady from the violence of a ravisher, I should regret the hour of coming within your doors; as it is, my mistress, I esteem my mistress happy in having entered your service, and shall think my mistress equally so, in quitting your service. I am directed to ask you for the small trunk belonging to the lady, which if you think proper to deliver, your service may save a further enquiry into your conduct, and I shall then leave your clothes and take my own. Oh! I might have your service, my mistress said, my mistress wanted nothing belonging to the minx, nor ever desired to hear of either of us again! Accordingly having got my mistress trunk, I called a coach, put off my mistress finery, dressed my mistress in your clothes, took leave of my fellow servants and made the best of my way to my former lodging, where, though late at night, I found an admission.  THE next morning I waited on Miss Wildman, at the appointed time, who, appearing in a morning dress, seemed lovely in the extreme; and I had the pleasure to receive, from Miss Wildman angelic tongue, Miss Wildman grateful thanks, for Miss Wildman miraculous preservation. Miss Wildman told me, Miss Wildman was still more obliged to my mistress for the advice I had given Miss Wildman, which had reconciled Miss Wildman to the best of parents, and without which Miss Wildman should have forfeited that love Miss Wildman never was so sensible of till now. Miss Wildman asked me "what reception I had met with from my mistress on my return?" I related every particular, and told Miss Wildman I had brought away Miss Wildman : and though I had lost my place, I did not fear getting another, having done no otherwise than as justice and duty had compelled me. Miss Wildman gave me to understand that Miss Wildman wished to see me, and begged I would stay in the servants hall, till his father had an opportuity of speaking with my mistress. I was no sooner at liberty, but my fellow servants flocked about my mistress, and thanked me by my fellow servants looks, as well as words, for restoring to my fellow servants my fellow servants lost young lady; my fellow servants told me how much Miss Wildman was beloved by the whole family and how much my fellow servants feared my fellow servants master would never more have received Miss Wildman; but my fellow servants were joyfully disappointed; that Miss Wildman contrition for Miss Wildman conduct, had wrought Miss Wildman reconciliation so effectually, that my fellow servants believed Miss Wildman father and mother loved Miss Wildman now more affectionately than ever.  Miss Wildman soon sent for my mistress up, and with tears in Miss Wildman eyes, thanked me for having been the deliverer of Miss Wildman child; Miss Wildman said, Miss Wildman had seen, Miss Wildman believed, Miss Wildman indiscretion, had repented of Miss Wildman conduct, and of course, was more endeared to Miss Wildman than ever: Miss Wildman told me, Miss Wildman had acquainted Miss Wildman with so much of the story, as Miss Wildman senses permitted Miss Wildman to be witness of; and Miss Wildman would be glad to hear the remainder from Miss Wildman. I related it to Miss Wildman in the manner it happened, and when I had finished the tale, Miss Wildman, with a degree of enraptured enthusiasm, flew to Miss Wildman and embraced me; blubbered out the sentiments of a grateful heart for the kindness I had done both Miss Wildman and Miss Wildman, and assured me Miss Wildman would be a friend to Miss Wildman for ever. There was a gallantry, Miss Wildman said, and greatness in my conduct, that would do honor to the first of characters, and as Miss Wildman heard I had lost my place in the cause, Miss Wildman would take me into Miss Wildman service, and I should be immediately about Miss Wildman person. Miss Wildman put into my hand a fifty pound bank-note and told me Miss Wildman would give me one every year, whilst I thought proper to continue with Miss Wildman. Poor as I was, I modestly refused a fifty pound bank-note, saying, I was amply gratified in having merited Miss Wildman good wishes and Miss Wildman daughter's: but Miss Wildman replied, fifty pounds Miss Wildman hoped would not hurt me, and insisted on my taking it. Miss Wildman then told me, Miss Wildman could employ Miss Wildman present valet, at an estate Miss Wildman had in the country, and I might come to Miss Wildman when I thought proper; I accepted Miss Wildman proposal, and replied, that, if agreeable to Miss Wildman, I would attend Miss Wildman the next day. Matters being thus adjusted, I returned to my lodging, and prepared to removemy little baggage the next morning; but curiosity leading me to enquire at Mrs. Duplex's, whether the gentleman had called or sent for the gentleman sword, or whether my fellow servants had heard my fellow servants say any thing concerning me, I called there in the evening, under a pretense of returning a cork-screw I had inadvertently taken away in my pocket, and was admitted privately into the kitchen; where I was soon told, that the gentleman had been there for his sword, and that both the gentleman and my mistress had vowed vengeance against me, whenever both he and my mistress could find me. I smiled at both he and my mistress menaces and left our house as secretly as I entered our house.  CHAP VIII. THE next day put me in possession of my new place, to which I was the more eager to go, as THE next day would give me an opportunity of occasionally seeing Miss Wildman, an attachment to whom, I found, maugre the great distance between us, grew insensibly upon me; and dangerous and fruitless as the thought might be, I could not but indulge it. I called to my remembrance, that, in the course of my reading, far more unlikely things had come to pass than what I coveted. She had now no penchant for any man; the late object of She affections, from his villainous conduct, was become odious to She; She had noticed me, even before the late accident happened, in a very favorable light; -- She seemed endowed with an uncommon share of sensibility: -- She owed me attention -- She owed me gratitude; -- and She called me She protector and deliverer. -- On the other hand, -- I was conscious in having been bred up a gentleman -- of having had a liberal education -- of having good connexions and being allied to a good family and fortune; for my father's uncle, though he would do nothing for me, was possessed of an estate of four thousand pounds a year, and there were only two persons, the children of my father's elder brother, between me and an estate of four thousand pounds a year, and only two persons, the children of my father's elder brother, between me and that estate unmarried. -- With such chimerical, such fugitive notions, did I now and then amuse me. I was determined, however, not to offend the whole family I was in; but to watch and wait patiently for that critical moment, if ever it should arrive, that might give a more favorable turn to my pretensions. Our family consisted of my master, my mistress, and Our family daughter, who were Roman Catholics, and of a great num-of servants; and it seemed a very happy one, when I first became a part of it; but, as I was a favorite up stairs, I soon became obnoxious below. I studied, all I could, to conciliate the affections of my fellow servants, but that demon Jealousy, which seldom takes possession of the human mind, but it makes it see things through a false medium, and gives a different color to transactions, than what they naturally bear; this jealousy poisoned all they tempers, and every thing they did for me was more than I deserved: my shoes and buckles were not half cleaned; the knife I was to eat with did not cut; the bread I was helped to, was dry; the bear flat, and as I was generally attending upon my master, at the usual time of breakfast, in the house-keeper's room; when I came down to eat mine, the muffins were gone, the water was cold, and the cream was slopped. In short, there seemed to be a conspiracy against me, and for no fault of mine that I was conscious of; I was too much of a gentleman for a servant; I wanted two or three to wait upon me, and I studied nothing but dress, affected airs and fine language. -- I bore all this very patiently, for what will not a person bear with a favorite object in view? I imputed their conduct to ignorance and low-breeding, and prided me in returning good for evil. My master, who ufed always to converse with me, when I was dressing, would treat me more as a friend than as a servant, and with a degree of concern, would often complain to me of the conduct of a servant people below; at which times I always took pains to excuse his people below faults, and explain away his people below errors; but this availed me but little, his people below were not sensible of my good wishes toward his people below; and hated, me merely because I was beloved by his people below master and mistress. All I could do, in the present situation of things, was to make a friend of Miss Wildman's maid, and which I aimed at for more reasons than one; as it would facilitate my intercourse with Miss Wildman , and Miss Wildman was disposed to get me my breakfast, which was my best meal, in Miss Wildman own room. Miss Wildman was a good-natured woman, about thirty years of age, and greatly in Miss Wildman young lady's favor. Through Miss Wildman, I learned that Miss Wildman Miss Wildman had expressed the highest regard for me, and wished for an opportunity of being of use to me: Miss Wildman had frequently observed to Miss Wildman's maid, as Miss Wildman had done to Mrs. Duplex, that I had the manner of a gentleman, and was sure, though in the situation of a servant, I had received a gentleman's education, and that Miss Wildman father and mother were of the same opinion; for that her father and mother had never remarked in any servant her father and mother had men with, that good sense, that gallantry, that respectful attention, and that insinuating address that marked my character; and that Miss Wildman was anxious to know my history. Through this same channel I made Miss Wildman acquainted with every thing concerning me; of which the reader is too well informed to need a repetition here; and as far as I dared to do, I made Charlotte understand, which was the name of Miss Wildman's maid, that though I ventured my life in the defense of Miss Wildman , and was too much Miss Wildman friend, to wish Miss Wildman in any perilous situation again, yet I should rejoice in a second opportunity of convincing Miss Wildman how much I had Miss Wildman safety at heart. This I foresaw would be carried to Miss Wildman, for Charlotte had too much of the waiting-maid about Miss Wildman, not to take pleasure in carrying tales backwards and forwards. Had I been butler in the whole family, I should have had frequent opportunities of being in Miss Wildman presence; but, in the capacity of Miss Wildman father's valet, I seldom could see Miss Wildman. Now and then Miss Wildman would come into Miss Wildman maid's room, whilst we were at breakfast, and sit and chat with we. The first time I saw Miss Wildman upon this occasion, I rose respectfully from my seat, at which Miss Wildman seemed hurt. "Gabriel," says Miss Wildman, I am much obliged to Charlotte for Miss Wildman Attention to you; any respect Miss Wildman shows you will be gratefully acknowledged by me; for to you I am indebted for every thing. I humbly told Miss Wildman Miss Wildman rated my services too high; for, independent of any protection due to suffering innocence, such merits as Miss Wildman Miss Wildman could boast of, laid the strongest claim to every necessary interference. Miss Wildman told me, that Miss Wildman frequently came into her maid's room to speak with Miss Wildman; but, if it disturbed me, or put me the least out of my way, Miss Wildman would never enter it again: and it was Miss Wildman request in future, that I should not notice Miss Wildman coming in. I replied, that as a command of here is, I should obey it. At these occasional interviews, Miss Wildman would be affable and familiar, and once Miss Wildman condescended to tell me, that Lord B. who was the son of the Earl of A. and who had treated Miss Wildman so ill, had made several applications for leave to renew his addresses to Miss Wildman; but Miss Wildman was determined never to listen to his more. Miss Wildman heart, Miss Wildman said, was Miss Wildman own again, and Miss Wildman hoped, Miss Wildman should have sufficient discernment and resolution never to bestow it more upon a worthless objects. Charlotte, says Miss Wildman, one day, to Miss Wildman maid, (for Charlotte told it me again) was I mistress of my own fortune, I don't know but I would bestow it upon Gabriel: Gabriel appears to be a young man of such nice honor, and such virtuous sentiments, as would be an ornament to any line of life, Gabriel may be thrown into. I assure you, Miss Wildman, says, Charlotte, it would not be ill bestowed, for Gabriel is the son of a gentleman, has had the best of educations, and, though now in the capacity of a servant, has an estate of four thousand pounds a year in expectation. In short, she made she acquainted with many parts of my history, such as I had let she into.  IT was a practice with me in every scene of life into which I was thrown, to acquire all the information I could, respecting that scene; here then I learned the fatigue and absurdity of a fashionable life, and the tiresome round of dissipation attending IT. my master, in one of my master conversable moments, told me, there was no satisfaction in the visits men of fashion paid to each other, and that my master had cut Cut is a fashionable term for, given he had cut Cut up. he had cut Cut long since. Visits among the great, my master said, were merely ceremonial, and rather troublesome than otherwise; my master had visited a man for seven years together, and never once had seen a man. Indeed, I heard me, a gentleman once say to a lady, who rated a man for not calling oftener to see a gentleman, It is your ladyship's fault entirely. -- I would come oftener, if you would not let me in. Nay, visiting is allowed to be so much a ceremony, that I have been told of a lady, who, having omitted to tell a gentleman porter, that a gentleman did not choose to be seen, put a gentleman head out of window, and called out to a gentleman visitant, on knocking at the door, "I am not at home." Frequently has my master told me, that in the younger part of my master life, my master and my master lady received so many invitations on the same day, that he and his lady have been obliged to divide he and his lady, and go from one house to another, showing he and his lady each at two or three places on the same evening; and on my asking whether it would not have been better to have omitted going to more places than one? my master replied, No, nothing but illness (if in town) is an excuse for non-attendance; if an invitation is once or twice unaccepted, party will be asked no more, John, our porter, has entertained me, frequently for a long time together, with visiting relations. my master told me, when ladies have so many visits to return, that ladies cannot personally pay ladies, it is not an unusual thing to send the empty chair, which stopping at the end of the street, the footman steps forward to one house, knocks gently at the door, and asks her porter confidentially, if his lady sees company; if answered in the negative, her porter knocks hard, beckons to the chairmen to come up and leaves a card; if answered in the affirmative, no notice is taken, but the chairmen proceed to another house. To avoid, however, this troublesome piece of business; gentlemen will now leave gentlemen names at the door, without enquiring for my master, or attempting to go in; and ladies will send gentlemen servants to do the same; and the delivery of such card shall be construed as a visit made and returned. And what is all this but farce and tiresome ceremony? the end of visiting is social intercourse and friendly converse; but this mode of visiting, destroys the end of visiting. A modern visitant seems to dread the meeting of a private friend, as if A modern visitant was fearful A modern visitant conduct should be enquired into and censured; and, as if A modern visitant abhorred the necessity of saying a civil thing to A modern visitant acquaintance. Whatever these people may think, such conduct is disgraceful, and must arise from want of abilities to join in general topics, or from fearing reflection, as owls fear the daylight.  END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.
