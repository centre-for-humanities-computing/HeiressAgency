DR. SLASHEM, the vicar's brother in law, to whom I was recommended, received me at his door with apparent civility, but soon gave me to understand that his had reckoned without his host, when his proposed taking an assistant. his school was but of late establishment, two scholars had lest his the day before, and his had no greater number than his could attend to his; however, out of respect to his brother, his would contrive to give me house-room, till I could find a situation to my liking, and as his understood I was not able to afford great things, provided I would occasionally assist his in school hours, I should not pay for my lodging and board more than fifteen shillings a week. -- I was not so young but I could see the drift of this gentleman's civility; instead of paying me for my assistance, as I expected, I was to pay for my board and lodging, and give my board my labor gratis; however, being a stranger in that part of the world, and not knowing where to go, I dissembled in my turn, told my board how much I thought my board obliged to my board, and accepted my board friendly offer. my board introduced me to my board family, which consisted of a wife, a daughter about seventeen, rather pretty than otherwise, and ten boys between the ages of nine and fourteen. Mrs. Slashem was some years younger than the Doctor, and seemed to look upon Mrs. Slashem daughter with a jealous eye, and as one who told her daughter her daughter was growing in years. her daughter, in her daughter turn, was of a forward cast, and thought her daughter had more right to be noticed than her daughter mother, who was a married woman, and in her daughter time had had her daughter share of admirers: in short, I no sooner entered, than I discovered that both had shot both arrows at my board at once. "Biddy," says Mrs. Slashem, I wish you would get down stairs, you stare at the young man as if you never saw a young man before. Ah, get down, you young baggage, says the Doctor, and get us something nice for supper. her daughter slammed the door after her daughter, but not without giving me to understand by her daughter looks, that her daughter was angry at being sent out of the room. Mrs. Slashem, primming up Mrs. Slashem mouth, and adjusting Mrs. Slashem features into an affected form of reserved politeness, hoped I would excuse the awkwardness of Mrs. Slashem girl, who had seen but little of the world, and had rather out-grown Mrs. Slashem age; for though in size her daughter resembled a woman, her daughter was, in fact, little more than a child. Indeed, my dear, replies the Doctor, you wrong her daughter, for you was married at her daughter age. If I was, retorts Mrs. Slashem angrily, and bridling up, I hope I had more discretion, and more of her daughter in Mrs. Slashem. "Discretion," returns the Doctor, I will say nothing about, but as to her daughter, I will admit that you had always enough of that; giving me a wink with the Doctor left eye. But come, the young man, I dare say, will be glad of a little refreshment, if you will be kind enough to provide it. For, as we had come a long day's journey, I began to wish for supper, though it was but eight o'clock. Mrs. Slashem retired to provide for our repast, and get the boys to bed, and of course left me and the Doctor together. the Doctor then gave me a long detail of the difficulties the Doctor had met with in establishing the Doctor school. I told the Doctor, that no doubt the Doctor character had recommended the Doctor, and that as the Doctor came to be better known, the Doctor number of scholars would increase. Character, my good friend, says the Doctor, is the least recommendation; parents, nowadays, will put parents children out where parents have the most taught for the least money. In order to get a good price, schoolmasters are reduced to artifice. Good God! -- Artifice; exclaimed I, can artifice avail where children should be kept strangers to deceit? You misunderstand me, Sir, replies the Doctor, I mean artifice in the establishment of a school. I Will explain it to you, it may be of use to you in life, if you propose to follow the same profession. -- Parents have an idea, that the fewer scholars a man has, the better a man can attend to Parents, and then, of course, a man can demand a better price. A man taking only four boys, may expect fifty pounds a year for each, whereas if A man taking only four boys takes fourteen, A man taking only four boys will find it difficult to get more than twenty. After a man has got one or two to begin with, that a man may not be supposed to want scholars, a man gives out, that a man will take no greater number than four, -- then, a man has room for two more: -- a man procures two more: -- a man then finds a man can attend to ten, to which number a man will confine a man; but that is only till a man can get another ten; so that a man never stops till in fact a man can get no more. In short, a man gave me to understand, that by such means, and by a little extra attention and tenderness to those boys as were the children of wealthy parents, who have it frequently in their power to recommend others, it is, that men establish a school sooner than by any other method. Indeed, I found it was a man invariable practice to wink at the faults of the boys of opulent, parents, and keep up the strictest discipline with others it being necessary to punish some as an example to the rest: when a poor man's son, charged, perhaps, with robbing the garden, has endeavored to exculpate a man, by discovering the offender, and laying the blame, justly, on a man more wealthy, but guilty schoolmate, I have known the Doctor exclaim, It is a barefaced lie, -- Master Goldwire is the son of a gentleman, and above a base act, and I Will punish you for the false assertion. -- Then, as to the annual price of schooling; twenty pounds a year, the Doctor told me, (which, indeed, was the price the Doctor had with the Doctor scholars) was but small pay; however, what with the profits derived from selling the children toys, fruit, pens, paper, and other articles, at two hundred per cent. gain, getting from each boy half a guinea or a guinea at Christmas, under the idea of presents to the servants, taking the servants pocket money on the servants return from the holidays, under a pretense of keeping it for the servants, and giving the servants only part of it again; charging in the servants bills occasionally a pair of shoes, a copy-book, and the like, more than the servants have had; by such sundry emoluments he made out pretty well. And on my seeming to disapprove of such conduct by my looks, he told me, there was no doing otherwise. It was the annual price of board and schooling to which parents chiefly attended. To be asked thirty pounds a year would frighten the annual price of board and schooling to which parents chiefly attended, but under a notion of paying but twenty, the considerations he had mentioned, would draw and additional twenty from the annual price of board and schooling to which parents chiefly attended without a murmur: then says he again, we can get a guinea a quarter for dancing, as much for drawing, and fifteen shillings, perhaps, for writing, when in fact we pay to the different masters only half the price we charge. If it was not for these arts and contrivances, a school master had better be a hackney coachman, and drive mules rather than boys. In short, I found from the doctrine of the pedlar, the stage-coachman, and this worthy friend of mine, that to live in the world a man must not be too honest. On the same plan of reasoning, the Doctor would have kept me for the Doctor assistant; for the Doctor expected as much of me, as if the Doctor had paid me a salary of thirty pounds a year. I was determined, however, to get from this place as soon as I could; for my remaining stock would not admit of my paying fifteen shillings a week for my board. I had been now a fortnight in the family before I thought of removing, and to do justice to Mrs. Slashem and Slashem daughter, Mrs. Slashem and her daughter did every thing in Mrs. Slashem and her daughter power to make my time pass agreeably. The mother, in order to have my company abroad, would frequently desire the Doctor to spare me, as it was proper where The mother was going to have an escort, and miss would frequently steal up into my room when I was alone, play about me, and entertain me with the secret anecdotes of the family; from The mother I learned that The mother papa was no doctor, but had assumed the title in order to give credit to the school; that The mother mama had constantly a gentleman came to see The mother at school hours, when her papa was at the top of the house with the boys: in short, The mother told me how much her mama hated her papa, and how much The mother detested them both, and that The mother would give the world if any one would take The mother out of the house; that The mother did not care where The mother went, if The mother was but from home; that her mama treated her mama as a girl, when The mother knew The mother was as much a woman as The mother, and that The mother was going in eighteen, and was determined not to be a great while longer in leading strings. The assiduous attention of The mother would perhaps have been far from disagreeable to me, if her daughter had been out of my reach; but Mrs. Slashem had insisted, a day or two after my arrival, that I should be made free of the village we lived in, according to the ancient ceremonial of the place; which was, to be sworn upon the horns, not to eat brown bread if I could get white, unless I liked brown better; not to put up with the maid when I could h^^e the mistress, unless I liked the maid better, and so on: and as oaths are not merely confined to the letter, but extend to the spirit of oaths, I conceived I was equally sworn not to put up with The mother, if I could have the daughter, unless I liked The mother better. Indeed, such was the favor I was in with both, that I was scarcely left to my choice, and a dread of the chapter of accidents, was one principal motive for my wishing me away. The censorious reader may perhaps suppose, that, as a young man bordering upon twenty, I was no anchorite, and that I was not sufficient master of philosophy, to withstand a temptation thrown industriously in my way; in short, The censorious reader may suppose -- what The censorious reader will, -- and as I profess me a member of the reformed church, and the necessity of auricular confession to be no part of my faith, I shall take the liberty to leave The censorious reader to The censorious reader conjectures, and only say, that for more reasons than one, I wished me in any situation but where I was. I had an opportunity of seeing the newspapers, and I looked carefully to the advertisements, hoping to meet with something that might suit me. My circumstances would not admit of my being very nice in my choice, for though I had near nineteen pounds in my pocket on my arrival at Highgate, after I had paid the coachman and the expenses of the last day's journey; that nineteen, from a triffling present or two to Miss, a few out-door treats to Miss mother in our afternoon walks, and what I should have to pay for my board and washing, go as soon as I would, would be reduced to little more than ten pounds. This, and a wish for an easy place, determined me, if I could not do better, even to put on a livery, rather than run me into difficulties, and to wait for a turn of fortune to befriend me. I did not communicate my design to the family, as circumstances had made my design necessary to conceal me from the family, but told the family I had a friend in London who promised to look out for a situation to place me in; and under a pretense of going to a friend in London who promised to look out for a situation to place me in, I had an opportunity of applying, as many advertisements directed me. To a Wanted a smart young man to attend in the shop of an apothecary, I applied, and found it was to open and sweep the shop of an apothecary, pound in the mortar, carry out medicines, and apply glisters; this would not do; this was a laborious employ, and to labor I had not been accustomed. The next advertisement that struck me was, Wanted a man of good figure, in an easy genteel office, with good encouragement: here I enquired, and found there had been a variety of applicants, most men wishing for easy places and good pay. This was no other than to stand all day at the door of one of those auctioneers, who are constantly selling things made up purposely to take in the ignorant and incautious, and with a vociferous voice to call out to every person that passes, Walk in, Sir, walk in gentlemen -- selling by auction. The abilities for an easy genteel office were little more than a good pair of lungs, and the pay was two shillings a day; as the situation, however, was by no means a concealed one, I readily declined an easy genteel office. The next was more likely to answer my purpose: Wanted a person of good address and gentleman-like appearance, to attend a few hours a day in a respectable employ, for which a good salary would be given. The reader will naturally say, I had no small share of vanity, to attend only to such advertisements as required smartness, good-figure, address, and gentlemanlike appearance; but when he is told that both Mrs. Slashem and Miss had constantly given me to understand, that I was possessed of those qualities, he will not wonder at my believing it. The next advertisement that struck me succeeded; The next advertisement that struck me was not to stand at the door of one of these auctions, but to act as a decoy during the time of selling, and lead persons on to bid persons on money. I was to attend from eleven to three in the week days, and my pay was to be eighteen shillings a week. I accepted this place and was to be initiated into an easy genteel office a week following. Accordingly, I took a lodging in the neighborhood, a two pair of stairs room in the shop of a tradesman, for which I was to pay six shillings a week, and I was determined to make the remaining twelve answer every other purpose. Happy in this engagement, I acquainted the Doctor, that I should now be no longer troublesome to the Doctor, that I was going to America in a merchan'ts family, as tutor to the Doctor son, a lad of twelve years of age, for which I was to have a handsome salary. Though I had not been six weeks with the Doctor, I found it difficult to get away. the Doctor had conceived an affection for me, and rather than part with me, would take half a guinea a week. Mrs. Slashem used all Mrs. Slashem rhetoric to persuade me to continue, and Miss Slashem all Mrs. Slashem charms; but nothing would do. I had my private reasons for leaving them, and on my promise to correspond with Miss, as occasion should offer, I was suffered to depart in peace. I had been brought up with proper notions of right and wrong, and could scarce reconcile this deception to my way of thinking, but when I considered the plea of necessity, and that self-preservation was the first law of nature, I was easily led to justify the proceeding. I was master of my own actions, and had not by a promise, made to any of the parties, forfeited a right of disposing of me as I thought proper.
