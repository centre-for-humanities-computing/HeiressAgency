MY new employer was not a little pleased with my figure, he could only have wished I was a few years older; -- that was easily remedied by my mode of dress, and we contrived it between us, that I wore the appearance of forty. As the office I was to enter on required a few instructions, the following were the chief maxims he gave me: Always to watch his eyes, and when he looked full in my face, bid something more than the last bidder. Never to see a flaw, or an imperfection in any thing selling. And to find out beauties, if possible, even where there are none. To pretend to know the value of every thing, and assert in a confidential manner to bidders, that the article selling was worth double the money bid for it. These were the instructions I was to follow, and I reconciled them to myself under the following reasoning: that bidders at an auction buy upon their own judgment, and if they buy too dear, it is their own faults; that auctioneers are forbidden to bid themselves, and that, of course, if they had not some friend to bid for them occasionally, articles at times would not fetch half their value; that deception runs through trade in general, no tradesman being condemnable for not pointing out the imperfections of his goods. As to any other artifices made use of in the profession, I was to have no concern with. The auctioneer, as things were not sold by a catalogue, was at liberty to offer any article for sale that he pleased; so that if a countryman came in, we were sure to have a silver watch put up; or if a lady, some pieces of china, or a set of silver-handled knives and forks, and so on; the one; I would whisper was old china, and the other, had town-made blades with the handles of solid silver, and no lie neither. In short, I discharged my duty so well as to give my employer satisfaction, and often procured him a better price for his goods than the first cost. Our plan was not a little forwarded by the touter Touter is a nickname given to those who stand a shop-doors, and entice in customers, as butchers that cry out, What do you buy, Sir? Old clothes men in Monmouth-street, etc. See, what you want, Sir; and men at auctions, Walk in gentlemen, Selling by auction, etc. at the door, calling out, Selling by auction under a judgment. Must be sold, Gentlemen, without reserve, to release a man from prison, etc. It is unknown the numbers such declarations draw in to buy, under an idea of getting things at half their value; and if they are taken in, by the law of retaliation, they richly deserve it. Sometimes our sale, indeed, has been interrupted by a person contradicting the auctioneer flatly, and declaring aloud, that the article was not what he represented it; in this case, I was immediately directed to bid, and I became the buyer. This done, the company are dismissed with, Gentlemen, I am much obliged to you, we have done selling for today. The company of course withdraw, the obnoxious person gone, the street door is shut for five minutes, and then re-opened with a Walk in, Gentlemen, selling by auction, and the room is presently filled again with fresh company; for these sales are always held in some very public thoroughfare.  INDEED, there is scarce an auction of any denomination, without its impositions. In sales of linen and other drapery goods, they will put seven or eight yards of silk, worth about six shillings a yard, into the same lot with a roll of course dowlas worth seven-pence, and sell the two together at so much per yard. If you ask how many yards in the roll, they will tell you about thirty; you make your calculation accordingly, and perhaps buy the whole at one shilling and sixpence a yard, thinking thus to give about two pounds five shillings for the lot, which, at sixpence per yard for the dowlas, would give you the silk for four shillings; but after having paid down the earnest, and the lot is to be delivered, the roll of linen shall contain sixty yards instead of thirty, in which case you pay eight shillings and sixpence a yard for the silk, and are encumbered with more dowlas than you know what to do with. So again in auctions of furniture: the auctioneer, in order to have his sales well attended, finds it necessary, not only to treat the brokers with a dinner, but to give each of them a lot at their own price, so that at auctions in and near London, where there are plenty of brokers, if twenty are present, you are sure to have twenty lots (and perhaps the best of your furniture) given away. The brokers, on the other hand, have their arts of imposing, if you appoint one to purchase certain lots for you at certain prices, under an idea, that the will buy them cheaper, you are sure to be charged pretty near the price you fixed, though perhaps they purchased them for half the money.  I WAS in this employ upwards of two months, when an accident happened that lost me my place. During the selling of a plated cruet-stand, worth about thirty shillings, who should come in but Dr. Slashem? As I was disguised, he could not possibly know me, except I had opened my mouth, which I took care not to do. He bid a guinea and a half for it; which my master did not think enough; I was called upon by his looks to bid against him; I did it by a nod, but as the Doctor did not see it, he asserted he was the last bidder, the auctioneer appealed to me, but I was mute as a fish, and Slashem was the buyer; the company were dismissed, and I was immediately discharged. But his anger did not cease here, whilst in his service, I had sold my own watch, and bought rather a better, and had also purchased a pair of pistols: the watch, which was a metal one, had been brought to him, requesting him to sell it, which he refused, I therefore purchased it for fifty shillings, and sold my own for pretty nearly the same sum. This watch was a stolen one, and was advertised, and my quondam master, the auctioneer, carried his resentment so far, as to lay an information before a magistrate, that he had seen such a watch in my possession: a warrant was accordingly issued, and one evening, about ten o'clock, as I was going to bed at my lodging, I heard a great noise below, and a fellow with a hoarse voice inquiring for one Gabriel Outcast. Conscious of having done no wrong, I went down stairs, and was immediately taken into custody, charged with a highway robbery. All I could say had but little effect. The warrant was to be executed, the watch was taken out of my pocket, my room was searched and the pistols, which lay upon my table, seized. The little money I was possessed of I put into my pocket, and I was thence hurried to the parish round-house, where, under lock and key, I passed a very uneasy night. The next morning I was taken before a trading magistrate, and charged with robbing a man in the Five Fields Chelsea of his watch, the Friday evening before, and though I protested my innocence in the strongest terms, and made out a very good story, yet, being confronted with the prosecutor, who swore to his property, and the identical watch being found upon me, and the pistols in my room; circumstances were too much against me to get off: the only thing in my favor was, that the prosecutor could not swear to my person, as I appeared to be a younger man than the one who robbed him; for I was not now in my auction dress; but then, on the other hand, the master of the house, where I lodged, deposing, that I went abroad every day in a disguise, which gave me the appearance of an elderly man, corroborated the suspicion. I had sent to the auctioneer, who could prove that the watch had been offered to him for sale, and whose evidence would, of course, have operated in my favor; but he was industriously out of the way, and as I could not procure bail, I was committed to Bridewell till the next week, when I was to be brought before the justice again.  In the course of my examination, his worship bawled out, hand over that there watch, which on looking at, he put into his pocket with a this must be produced upon the trial. -- Constable, see what money the prisoner has about him. I had two guineas and a few shillings in my pocket, which he directed to be handed over likewise, and on the prosecutor's saying he had lost some gold, but could not swear to the money. -- "I don't know how you should," replies the justice, one guinea is too like another for that; it looks however, like money dishonestly come by, and so -- putting it into his pocket it shall go with the watch I humbly conceive, said I, addressing myself to him, that as the money is not sworn to, it ought to be returned me. Stop that fellow's mouth, roared out his worship, and give me his mittimus to sign, and in an accent lower, "damn your humble conceptions!" -- I deemed it fortunate that I had secreted a ten pound note, all the money I had left, in my fob; where these grasping fangs of the law, had no idea of looking.  Whilst I was in prison, I met with a man who had been confined forty seven years. He was shut up on execution, at the suit of the crown, for a heavy fine imposed on him, for having in his possession some exciseable goods that had not paid the duty; of course no insolvent act could discharge him. This man, bating his imprudence that brought him there, was not without his virtues. He was the oracle and chaplain of the jail; and being a man of good sense, was often a real comfort and assistance to the unhappy. He had outlived all his friends and connections, and had nothing to subsist on, but the allowance of the prison, the scanty sparings of his fellow prisoners, almost as poor and wretched as himself, and the benevolence of a few out-door neighbors, who occasionally sent him a dinner, or an old coat to cover him: stockings he wore none, and perhaps, the only useless part of his dress, was a woollen night cap that covered his bald head, being grown gray within the walls. The little hair he had was wiry; for affliction, when it does not kill, proceeds to harden. Though covered with the rust of a jail and offensive through want of cleanliness, this old man approached me in so modest and decent a manner, that I could not but be pleased with him. He had acquired a degree of philosophy since his confinement, (for what patience will not a prison teach?) and seemed so reconciled to his situation, as not to wish for liberty. To be abroad again in the world, he said, to him, at his time of life, would be irksome; he had not a friend alive, and without money, could only fly to the shelter of a workhouse. He observed. that though a prison affords no comfort, yet, there the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor: and having proportioned his appetite to the quantity of food he could get, and contracted his wants within very small limits, he was far from being wretched. Should it please God to take him from the world, he was perfectly resigned; but, to remove him from these walls, except in his coffin and to his grave, would be only to hasten his dissolution, and put an abrupt period to his existence. And indeed, so much did he speak the sentiments of his soul, that upon an enquiry three or four years afterward, I was informed, that the Chief Justice having, from the representation of the keeper, and a mistaken humanity, ordered him to be released, he became truly miserable.  He was no sooner at liberty and without the prison wicket, than he stopped short, wild as it were and lost. The broad sunshine was painful to him. His eyes were fixed, but he could not weep. Stupefied at his change of situation, his legs, in spite of him, became as immovable as his tongue.  CONDUCTED by a charitable hand, he enquired the way to the place where once he lived. His house was there no more; a public building was erected on the spot. He knew neither the street, the town, nor the objects. The adjoining houses to his own had taken a new form. He endeavored to recollect them, but he had lived twenty years to long.  Startled; he stopped and sighed; and for the first time felt the comfort of a jail, where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary are at rest. Every face was new, and every thing about him strange. The only person he could find, of whom he had the least recollection, was a tottering old man, who formerly had been his servant; he found him in a garret, living on charity, and from having been confined to his room eighteen years, had strength only to pull the cord that opened his door.  THIS poor creature could not recollect his master, whose face, time and afflictions had so much furrowed; and the only comfort his master drew, was, by a participation of his grief, and from a conviction, that he was not the most miserable of beings. This old domestic, entertained him only with his sorrows; told him that his wife was dead; that he had experienced thirty years of wretchedness; that his children were in some distant parts of the world unknown to him, and that every friend he had was gone.  At this the master sighed, and sighed alone; for the other was habituated to distress. Broke down with grief, he returns to his prison, and solicits a readmission. It was refused him. And he experienced the force of woe, now more than ever. To have outlived all his relations, his friends, nay, a whole generation. To want a shelter, or money to procure one, -- to be destitute of food and clothes and every necessary article. -- These were thoughts that racked him; but his greatest disquiet was, to be sensible, that a whole generation of men was at once lost to him, which by daily deaths the mass of mankind do not miss. Separated as it were, from society, I am alive, alone. "Death" says he, may be terrible, but to die the last is more so. Glad shall I be, when I can find the grave!  As a bird that has been long confined, will hover round its cage, uneasy at its liberty, so was this man daily at the prison wicket, importuning for admission; and finding none, he pined gradually away. Grief wore him to the bone, and he fell a martyr to a broken heart. -- And all this perhaps, for having in his house a few pounds of tea, or a cannister of unroasted coffee!  To this man I was not a little obliged. He gave me the character of Justice Fleece'em, for that was the magistrate's name by whom I was committed, and told me that he had formerly been and old clothes man, and knew the value of money too well not to accept a bribe, if offered through the medium of his clerk; that though he had received his education in Rag Fair, he did not want for abilities, and had a wonderful presence of mind on certain occasions, of which the following anecdote is a proof. When business at his office is slack, he sends the high constable round the purlieus of Drury, to pick up all the straggling women he can find and bring them before him; at these times they have been brought by scores. Such as can make a golden interest with his clerk, are generally dismissed with a reprimand; but such as cannot command half a guinea upon the occasion, are sure to be sent to Bridewell. It happened that his worship had intrigued with one of these girls at a time and place when he little expected to have been known, and had probably bilked her of her fee; she, unable, for want of money, to make that prevailing application which some others had done, begged, before she was taken away, that his worship would permit her to speak to him privately, as she had something of the utmost importance to communicate. Curiosity led him to hear her, and she was brought within the bar; she accordingly reminded him in his ear, of a former tete-a-tete that had passed between them, (which, as his worship was rather deaf, was overheard by a person next them,) and as he was in her debt, she hoped, it would plead as powerfully for her as any present she could make to his clerk. And so woman, bawls out his worship, that honest man was your father? -- Well! -- You are a graceless hussy; but on his account, I will this time forgive you; and I hope it will be a warning to you, to behave better for the future.  The situation of these unhappy girls is truly deplorable. Betrayed perhaps, by the man on whom she fondly doated; and giving too much way to the propensity of nature, the deluded female sacrifices her honor to her love, and for this indiscretion, is turned into the street, moneyless and friendless; here she becomes a slave to disease and infamy, and a prey to those who are far more depraved than herself. Having nothing to support her, she has no alternative but theft or prostitution; and of these two evils, she thinks it better to injure herself than others. But this profession requires dress, and there are not wanting women to furnish it, for which they make these girls pay three or four shillings a day; but where a girl has a good face and but little credit, lest she should decamp with her hired clothes, a woman is appointed to follow her in her nightly round; who never loses sight of her till she is picked up and taken to a public house; there she waits her coming out, and takes from her two thirds of her ill gotten pay. One of these women was quarrelling with a girl of the town, one evening as I passed along the Strand, and would have proceeded to blows, had she not been attending upon another. "Bl-st your eyes," says she, let me put up my whore and I Will box your for a crown. -- It is to be regretted, gretted, that our police is not better regulated; but whilst our magistrates are so indolent and ignorant, there is little expectation of its being done.  ON my expressing to this old man my astonishment at the various ways of getting money in the metropolis, and how sorry I was to observe, that even justice was put up to sale; he gave me to understand, that Justice Fleece'em had acquired a fortune by his practice; that he was up almost to any villainy; but that, as from his officious industry, he was a terror to felons, and brought many scoundrels to punishment who would otherwise escape, the law had winked at his conduct, and had even countenanced it by a pension.  "THE state" continued he, having allotted a reward of forty pounds for the apprehending of house-breakers, highway robbers, and the like, it is unknown the sums of money he picks up this way. He has a gang in pay, which is always upon the scout, and the half of every forty pounds he this way gets, he generously divides among them, keeping the remainder to himself. And what is the consequence? -- That none but such villains as the law allows that sum for apprehending, are apprehended. An acquaintance of mine, says he, told me the other day, that, being on business, at a night cellar in Cow Lane, whilst he was standing at the bar, there came in a young fellow returned from transportation, who addressed himself to the woman within, with a 'How are you mistress?' 'Aye Jack,' says she, 'is it you?' Yes, -- it is I, replies he, make me a sneaker of gin punch. -- Not a drop shall you have here. -- Why not? I expect, says she, Justice Fleece'em's men here every instant, and I would not have you taken in my house for the world! Pshaw! says Jack, they wont meddle OF me. -- They Will get nothing by taking of me. And hardly had he uttered the words, but Baildock, the justice's man, and two of his mirmidons entered. Baildock slapped him on the shoulder, with So Jack, you're soon returned? -- The country, I suppose was too hot to hold you? -- Aye, Master Baildock, replies he, nothing like old England for me. Come, will you take a sup of punch? They drank together and parted; for, continued my friend, as government allows but little reward for apprehending such as return from transportation, this gang of Justice Fleece'em's has it in orders, not to interrupt such, but keep them in view, waiting till they resort to their old practices; and then to lay hold of them; by which conduct the apprehenders gain an ample reward.  WITH these, and such like anecdotes, was this man amusing me on the first day of my arrival within the castle, for so did the prisoners call their place of confinement, when the keeper brought me word that Lawyer Grind wanted to speak to me. "By no means see him," says he, he is one of those pettyfogging rascals, that prey upon the wretched, and live upon the miseries of the unfortunate.
