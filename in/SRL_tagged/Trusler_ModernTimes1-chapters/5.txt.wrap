and upon the truth of which you may rely. A man of tolerable good connexions was brought in here for a highway robbery. This fellow applied to him, and amused him with hopes of escape. As a drowning man will, to save himself, even catch at straws, so this unhappy culprit listened to his deceitful adviser. He gave him to understand, that if he could furnish him with ten guineas, he would procure a copy of the indictment, and had no doubt of discovering some error in it, that would instantly quash it. The ten guineas were given, but on a second visit he was told, that counsel had examined the indictment, and not the shadow of a flaw could be found: but, that he was convinced, from the account he had received of the prosecutor, that he might be bought off, and of the evidence, that they might be softened for about twenty pound. He possessed that twenty pounds. It was given; and a third visit told him, that the prosecutor had been applied to, and was found incorruptible, and the evidence too respectable to be influenced; that the cash had been expended in bribing those, who were supposed to have some weight with the evidence, but they could not succeed. However, says Grind, as I have always people ready to prove an alibi This is to prove, that the prisoner was in some other place, than the place alleged, when the fact for which he is arraigned, was committed. , if you can raise thirty pounds more, there is no doubt of success. The poor wretch applies to his friends, and these thirty pounds were raised; but they turned out as ineffectual as the last. The trial came on, the alibi was overthrown, and the poor devil convicted. Could nothing more be done? -- Yes, for ten more, he would move an arrest of judgment, for the proceedings had been illegal. Here he was foiled again; counsel had exerted themselves, but the attempt was overruled. -- There was, however, another step, in which he flattered himself he should be more successful. This was by a proper application of thirty guineas, to bring over the Recorder to make a favorable report. -- This sum was also got, but the means equally unsuccessful. In this hopeless situation, the attorney addresses him again. If he could any ways contrive, through his friends, to raise twenty pounds more, a petition should be presented to the throne, and care should be taken to get it well backed at the council board, and he might rely on a pardon. He usually contrived the matter to end, long before it got so far, but your case, says he, is an uncommon one, which has hitherto baffled all my endeavors, but in this final step, I never fail. Encouraged by this declaration, every friend, as for life, was importuned, and this last twenty pounds procured, but all to no purpose. The death warrant was signed, and an order came down for execution. In a distracted state of mind, the poor wretch sends for his lawyer again, reminds him of the many promises he had made, the many great sums he had received, and asked him, 'if there were no hopes after all?' 'Hopes,' says he, to be sure there are. The petition is so strongly worded, and so powerfully backed, that take my word for it, they cannot hang you -- they dare not hang you, -- and there was not the least doubt but he would be left out of the death warrant. -- 'Aye, Sir,' returns the despairing criminal, it was on this account I sent for you. The death warrant is signed, -- I am in that warrant, and an order is come down for execution on Wednesday morning. This the attorney could not stand; -- Execution! exclaimed he, Execution! -- Well -- let 'em hang you, -- let 'em hang you, and d -- n me, if it shall not be the worst job they ever did in their lives! -- At this, he turned upon his heel, and left his deluded client to his fate.  THIS story determined me not to see Mr. Grind; I sent him word my case was of a nature not to need his assistance, and therefore I would not trouble him; I thanked my friend for his admonition, and resolved to trust to myself. Not knowing the nature of a night-cellar, which had been dropped in conversation, I wished for some account of one, and requested my adviser to make me acquainted with what he knew of them. He gave me the following account:  A NIGHT-CELLAR is an alehouse under ground, in some populous, but secret part of the town, which is kept open all night, for the resort of whores and rogues, and all such persons, whose actions will not bear the test of daylight. In some of these places of rendezvous, villains of note are generally to be found, and through the treachery of gangs in general, that of Justice Fleece'em's becomes well-acquainted with their persons. There is seldom a daring robbery or burglary committed, but Baildock and his crew get some intelligence of it; and though they are not able immediately to fix it on any particular man, they will soon trace it out, and take the offender into custody. Daring as these scoundrels are, there is an unaccountable infatuation in most of them, that will lead them to surrender themselves to Fleec'em's men, without violence. Baildock has many a time searched these night-cellars alone, without fear or danger. As madmen will, in their raving intervals, cease raving at sight of their keeper, and submit quietly to him, so will most of these villains yield, without resistance, to the mandates of Baildock. Whether they are awed by his undaunted resolution, or dismayed by conscience, or any other motive, I cannot say; but Baildock has been known to carry off from these places, the man he looked for, and without the least opposition. Master Baildock, says one of these fellows, as he approached him in one of his midnight searches, I hope you are not come for I? No, Tom, says he, it is not you I want, but Dick Hounslow, and I see him yonder. Come, Dick, you must go with me. -- D -- n me, says Dick, if I did not dream as much a day or two ago; then addressing himself to his company, well, gentlemen, says he, God bless you -- this sessions will be the end of me -- may you outlive many of them! -- and walked off with Baildock, as quietly as if in irons.  WAS I to relate to the reader, all the information I picked up during the time I was in this prison, it would fill a volume; and amusing as it might have been at any other time, I was too much taken up with my own affairs to attend much to it. I was to prepare for a second examination. A magistrate has certainly no authority to bring up prisoners before him to a second, or a third examination; if there is sufficient charge against them for commitment, they are to be committed for trial; if not, he is to discharge them; but Justice Fleece'em made a trade of his profession, and his house was a kind of petty court of judicature, where prisoners went, as it were, through a formal trial. It was so far of use indeed, that to a villain it was a good preparatory to his arraignment at the Old Bailey, and was frequently a means of his finding methods to get off.  THOUGH appearances were strong against me, being wrapped up in conscious innocence, I was convinced that the arrows of malevolence could not hurt me. I was not without money, and I set about collecting the evidence in my favor. I recollected that a porter at the auctioneer's was present when I bought the watch; and that on the evening when the prosecutor was robbed, I kept my room with a cold, and had at that time a neighboring apothecary to attend me; these people, I was persuaded, would justify my innocence, if the auctioneer was so relentless, as not to appear in my behalf. Indeed, I had little favor to expect from him; for such is the strange conduct of mankind, that whilst a man, who knows you, has reason to think he is well with you, he will do you no open injury, but, if convenience, or any circumstance has once led him to treat you ill, by his sacrificing your interest to his, so that he despairs of your ever forgiving him, he becomes the most inveterate enemy you have; and, though you have never given him the least offense, it is all the fame, he acts and speaks of you in future, as if you had been a thorn in his side ever since he had any knowledge of you. It was not so, however, with this man; though, as I since learned from his porter, he was the means of my being apprehended, by a false insinuation; even this man, thinking he had punished me sufficiently, thought proper, on application, to appear in my favor; of course, notwithstanding, on my second examination, the prosecutor was not present; I was acquitted, with the loss only of the watch I had purchased, and the expense of a few pounds in messengers, fees and other contingencies. Before, however, I left the Justice, I took the liberty to ask for my watch, which as I had fairly purchased, I thought myself entitled to, when all the satisfaction I could get was, The first of James the first, chapter twenty-one, says, The sale of goods in London, wrongfully come by, shall not alter the property; of course it belongs to the prosecutor. And I was afterward told, upon inquiry, that on the prosecutor's demanding his watch, he could obtain no other answer than, The law says, Goods sold in open market shall be the property of the buyer; now, all London is an open market, and every day, except Sunday, market day in London; therefore, it belongs to the prisoner. I thought little, however, about the watch, or my money, happy to owe my acquittal to my innocence; indeed, my watch was an expense to me which I could not well afford; for as it was frequently out of order, whenever I carried it to a watchmaker I was sure to have six or seven shillings to pay. This is one of their modes of getting money; though little or nothing is the matter with a watch, they will pretend it requires repair, which you cannot contradict, and make you pay accordingly.
