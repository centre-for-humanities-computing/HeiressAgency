THE next place I got, and this through the means of an acquaintance, was that of an amanuensis to a clergyman. a clergyman was a man of some fortune, and like most clergymen of fortune, too indolent to write a clergyman own sermons. So a clergyman was in possession of the church, a clergyman cared little what became of the congregation. a clergyman was the younger son of a good family, had a chapel in London, a fellowship at Cambridge, and an annuity of 200 l. a year; sufficient together to enable a clergyman to keep a pair of horses. When in town a clergyman wore a large grizzel wig, a pair of square-toed shoes, in short dressed like, and had all the formality of, a Presbyterian; though a young man, a clergyman screwed up a clergyman face into a primitive form, and would scarce suffer a smile upon a clergyman countenance; and there was such an affected severity in a clergyman manner, that you would have taken a clergyman for a saint; but when in the country, a clergyman was a buck of the first head, wore a smart bob wig, leather breeches, and was always in boots: a clergyman had but a small stock of sermons, and I was engaged, for a few months, to provide a clergyman with a greater. Having purchased a set of manuscripts, which a clergyman could not well read, my business was to transcribe a set of manuscripts, which he could not well read, and now and then throw in a passage or two which a clergyman occasionally penned on a slip of paper, as a clergyman leisure moments from hunting, drinking, and the card-table would admit. Indeed, I frequently helped a clergyman out, very often adding some passages of my own; so that a clergyman would often say I should make a very good parson. a clergyman was once, when at Cambridge, called upon to preach in the morning at St. Mary's, before the university, and not having a proper sermon upon the occasion, nor being able to compose or to compile one, was under a thousand anxieties; for a clergyman studied appearances more than most young men in the church. At last a circumstance happened, that relieved a clergyman from a clergyman pain. While in Cambridge, we dwelt in college; and it so happened, that a fellow of the same community who lived in the adjoining rooms, was appointed to preach at the same church in the afternoon. This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master, delivered This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master sermon aloud every morning before This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master glass in This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master own room, in order to acquit This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master well on the day of exhibition; and as the partition between the two apartments was only a wainscot, I could distinctly hear every word: accordingly, with my master's consent, I took down This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master sermon verbatim, and This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master preached his sermon verbatim in the morning. This being unknown to the other gentleman, the same discourse was delivered in the afternoon. Though This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master who penned it labored to have it believed that This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master was the author of it, it did not avail, the mystery was not unravelled, my master had all the credit, and the afternoon preacher was considered only as a purloiner of the copy.  HAVING furnished my master with about four dozen of sermons, which This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master called a pretty good stock, This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master proposed to discharge me, and took some pains to recommend me to a friend, as a very useful hand in the divinity way; but a friend was of another cast, This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master always composed This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master sermons himself; persuaded no one could do his sermons himself so well, though when composed, few could understand his sermons himself, from the variety of new words This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master used, and much fewer liked his sermons himself. This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master used to console This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master however with observing, that This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master really pitied This young gentleman, who was a very good writer, and who took a great deal more pains than my master congregation for the vexation they must feel, at hearing so many fine things of which they were neither the writer nor the speaker. It is said, that those who are bit by a mad animal partake of It nature and insanity. If this be the case, I am persuaded a friend's had been bit by a bookworm, for a friend was literally literary mad. See a friend when you would, a friend was never without a book, and when at home was almost overwhelmed with them. Every new publication a friend purchased, it be in what language it would; for though a friend was master of but one, a friend fancied a friend well read in all, and always prided a friend in having had the first copy wet from the press. Often have I seen a friend in a friend study, almost buried in volumes. They lay all round a friend and a friend table, piled high upon the floor, and as a friend would never suffer a servant to dust them, for fear of derangement, and was too much occupied in little thoughts to do it a friend, They were covered with dust. Here a friend would sometimes bury a friend whole days in little more than re-arranging They, and would be almost lost in a cloud of dust. a friend said, that in the English language there was a paucity of expression that required to be abundified, and a friend labored to repair this defect. a friend called a friend a nealogist, or a former of new words. Whenever a friend received a present, a friend returned a friend civilities and thanked a friend friend for a friend prevenient politeness; and when a friend sent a friend old black waistcoat to be new dipped, a friend requested the dyer to re-nigrisy the dyer. There was not an author abroad with whom a friend did not court a correspondence, nor any scribbler at home whom a friend did not pester with a friend visits. a friend would show a card from Rousseau, and a letter from Voltaire, as a medallist would exhibit a Cromwell's silver penny, or an Otho. As I shall have occasion to speak of a friend again, I shall drop the subject now, with saying, that, as during my stay with my master, I found out the art of making sermons, and as no enquiry is ever made before a man officiates as a clergyman, whether a friend be really in orders or not; flattering myself I should make as conscientious a priest as the generality of parsons are; and being so little of a Roman catholic, as not to conceive, that the laying on of hands by a bishop, can confer grace, any more than that a few words mumbled over a piece of bread, can make any alteration in its nature, I determined to take no other place, but to start forward in the profession myself; and, as this thought struck me soon after I commenced an amanuensis, I wrote two copies of every sermon I was directed to transcribe, and kept one for my own use. These amounted in the end to some dozens; accordingly, being furnished with all the requisites of a modern parson, namely, a few sermons, an iron gray suit, and a stock of impudence; as soon as I quitted my master, I applied to Mr. Snuffle, in Paternoster Row, for employ.  THIS gentleman was formerly a parish clerk, but growing tired with saying amen for twenty pounds a year, THIS gentleman has found out a new method of being serviceable to THIS gentleman, under the idea of being useful to the clergy. As there are register offices for a variety of respectable wants, for houses, servants, whores, etc, so this is a register office for parsons, a kind of divinity-shop in the city of London for hiring of preachers, readers, and so on, by the day or the week as occasion requires. For this purpose, THIS gentleman keeps a list of unemployed clergy, of all ages and characters, to suit certain congregations; some for example, attend much to the voice and to the action, and as they never take they eyes from the preacher during the whole sermon, they wish for something tolerable to look at. These THIS gentleman would furnish with a smart prig preacher of twenty-five, who would keep they awake by an exertion of the voice, and a display of the arms; to others, who do not like to be taught by boys, and had rather doze away a heavy hour or two, which the law will not suffer they to employ in they respective occupations, and who go to church more to keep up appearances, than from any spirit of devotion, THIS gentleman would provide a monotonist of sixty. For such men, like the tale-tellers in Scotland, have a happy knack of composing a congregation into a comfortable nap.  FROM this list THIS gentleman selects THIS gentleman preachers, and lets his preachers out for a stipulated sum, according to the duty his preachers are to perform, taking for THIS gentleman as agent, ten per cent. and one shilling extra for those THIS gentleman accommodates with a gown and cassack. The following is a copy of THIS gentleman printed list of prices.  s. d.

" Curate. "MR. Snuffle your servant."   " Mr. Snuffle. "Doctor, yours."   "Curate," I suppose, " Mr. Snuffle, you can guess my errand. I am going out of town tomorrow, for a fortnight, and shall want a supply, and at the same time, " Mr. Snuffle, I come to inform you, I shall from this day commence agent and patient, and intend to hire and be hired; so, as I am likely to be a pretty considerable dealer, and am, besides, an old acquaintance, hope you will give me the turn of the scale. So put me down in your list immediately.   " Mr. Snufflepulling out " Mr. Snuffle list). IT shall be done, " Mr. Snuffle. And a most respectable list IT is, I assure you; I have just got a fresh cargo of Scotch divines, piping hot from Edinburgh, besides a corpse -- my collection ends with, -- let me see -- fourteen schoolmasters, five doctors of divinity, two of five doctors of divinity justices of the peace, two reviewers, three political writers, two bible-makers, (mind the climax --) and a king's chaplain.   " Curate. All men of erudition, I suppose?   " Mr. Snuffle. Excellent scholars, -- charming preachers, I assure you, but -- enter nous, not one of Excellent scholars, -- charming preachers worth a sixpence in the world. -- But to " Curate. Aye, Mr Snuffle, -- I must have a good voice for Wednesdays and Fridays, and one of your best orators for Sunday next: you know my congregation is a little delicate.   " Mr. Snuffle. Then you must have a young man. My young gentlemen, I assure you, are all cushion-thumpers -- none of your dreaming chaps -- if there is the least grain of dust in a pulpit cushion, I Will be sworn My young gentlemen will beat there is the least grain of dust in a pulpit cushion out -- (looking over his list) here is Parson Rawbones, one of my athletic, able-bodied divines; it is not long since his knocked down a clerk in the desk, for interrupting his in the middle of a collect (and it was only for telling his his was reading the wrong one) this you know showed his to be a man of spirit, and kept up the dignity of the cloth. No parson, let me tell you, is respected now, that is not a boxing one. But I doubt whether No parson will do for No parson, for No parson is a north countryman, and has got a burr in No parson throat; No parson will never pass at your end of the town: I shall sport No parson, however, at a day lecture, or an early sacrament.   " Curate. You are so facetious, " Mr. Snuffle. But pray find me somebody, for I am in haste.   " Mr. Snuffle. If you had wanted a whiner or bawler for a charity sermon, I could help you to the best beggar in England, an arrant pickpocket for the middle aisle.

I believe I may safely say, I have raised the price of lungs at least cent per cent; I knew the time, and so did you, when a well-cassocked divine was glad to read prayers on a holliday for a shilling; old C -- never had more in old C -- life; now, " Mr. Snuffle, I never let a tit go out my stable (you will pardon my jocularity) upon such an occasion, under half a crown.   IT is to these, and such like indignities, to which the clergy are obliged to submit, that the function owes the function is degradation. Having received the best of educations, and flattering " Mr. Snuffle I had equal abilities in compiling and delivering a discourse with the best of them, I persuaded " Mr. Snuffle that, whilst I kept my own secret, I could do no great harm. I could pass an examination; and of course, could have taken orders if I pleased, and, as a late Bishop of Chester would never ordain a man till be had officiated as a deacon for three years, to see how he took to the profession, I conceived there could be no harm in my putting " Mr. Snuffle upon a similar trial.  HAVING then applied to this same Mr Snuffle, he soon found me employ, and as I acquitted " Mr. Snuffle to he satisfaction, and in a manner that did he credit, I never was idle; but an ill-judged parsimony of mine overturned the bucket presently. I was employed to read prayers on a weekday in a large parish, for which I had my shilling, but being called, at that time, on more important business, to the other end of the town, I appointed a deputy, and gave a deputy half my fees, but a deputy was so out of spirits at being obliged to officiate, at a price so degrading to the profession, and so derogatory to the honor of the cloth, that a deputy did not exert a deputy sufficiently to be heard, and on the clerk's hinting to a deputy, after service, that a deputy feared my congregation did not hear a deputy, a deputy answer was, How do you think, friend, I am paid? I presume, replies the clerk, the usual compliment. "Not so, " Mr. Snuffle," returns No parson, I am paid but half price, and I therefore only read my half-best. This story was carried to " Mr. Snuffle; and, for attempting to take the bread out of " Mr. Snuffle mouth, I was immediately struck off " Mr. Snuffle list.  I, AT this time, got intelligence, that a certain Viscount in the west, having married a woman of low family, who had a maiden sister, proposed to give any clergyman, that would take a maiden sister to wife, a living in any clergyman disposal, then vacant, of five hundred pounds a year. I determined to look after a certain Viscount in the west, having married a woman of low family, who had a maiden sister, proposed to give any clergyman, that would take her to wife, a living in his disposal, then vacant, of five hundred pounds a year, for though I was not in orders, as I have observed before, being sufficiently qualified, I could easily have been ordained; the necessary testimonials I made no doubt of procuring. a maiden sister lived at a market town in the neighborhood of Oxford: I accordingly inquired of the man who drove the stage-coach between that town and London, whether there was an assembly at that place, a maiden sister told me there was, and promised to bring me word, the next time a maiden sister came up, on what day an assembly was to be. This information being procured, I hired an elegant post-chaise for the journey, and took a friend with me, for whom I borrowed a smart livery, and who followed as my servant on horseback. I let a friend into my scheme, and promising a friend a reward if I succeeded, gave a friend a friend instructions; which were, to pass me for a man of good family and fortune. Thus, with two of my best sermons in my pocket, I set off for the place I was bound to, and arrived there on a Friday evening, five days, as the coachman told me, before the assembly day. Having sent for the landlord of the house where I was, I inquired, who served the church? he told me, a young gentleman from Oxford. My reason, friend, says I, for asking, is, that I am a clergyman, and mean to pass a few days here, and, if I thought it would be agreeable to your minister, I would ease your minister of your minister on Sunday. your minister reply was: I have no doubt " Mr. Snuffle, but " Mr. Snuffle would " Mr. Snuffle very glad of the offer; it is a long way to Oxford, and the roads, from the late rains, very bad. Tomorrow is market day there, and as several of our farmers will be going, if you think proper to write a letter, I will send a letter. a letter was written, and the answer, such as I wished. On Sunday I preached; and, from the great attention that was paid me on all sides, I conceive that I acquitted myself with eclat; but the object of my journey, however, was, unfortunately for me, not at church. As I came down from the pulpit, an elderly lady, after paying me some compliments on my sermon, asked me, if I made nay stay in the town? On my answering in the affirmative, an elderly lady told me an elderly lady name, and requested my company to dinner. I waited on an elderly lady, and found an elderly lady the gossip of the place. From an elderly lady I acquired every information I wished, and might, if I pleased, have learned the history of every family in the neighborhood. Among other information, however, I found to my mortification, that an assembly was not to be so soon as I expected, by a fortnight.  ON my return to my quarters, I begged my company, and among other things, asked him, who was mayor of the town, and what kind of a man him was; him informed me, that him was a respectable tradesman, a person of property, and a good-natured well-bred man. he was a respectable tradesman, a person of property, and a good-natured well-bred man so met my wishes, that I called for paper, and wrote the following card, to be dispatched the next morning.  THE gentleman who preached yesterday, presents THE gentleman who preached yesterday compliments to Mr. Mayor, and, if THE gentleman who preached yesterday will give THE gentleman who preached yesterday leave, will do THE gentleman who preached yesterday the honor to drink tea with THE gentleman who preached yesterday this afternoon.  THE answer returned was:  MR. Mayor's compliments to the gentleman who preached, and shall be proud of the honor of Mayor company.  WHEN evening came, I ordered my carriage, (for this, and the tongue of my servant gave me no small credit) waited on Mr. Mayor, and was politely received. my servant house was full of well-dressed men and women, collected, no doubt, for the pleasure of reconnoitering me. Conceiving some apology necessary for this self-invitation, I addressed my servant thus before all the company: This abrupt introduction of myself, Mr. Mayor, may require some apology; I am here upon a little excursion, and as being at an inn is irksome, where I have not the happiness of being acquainted, I make being at an inn a rule to introduce myself, as I have done here, to the politest families in the town where I am. The gentlemen smiled applause, the ladies tittered behind The gentlemen fans; but I had the satisfaction to find myself very well-received. Indeed, I wanted no further introduction any where; when the company present found I came down for an assembly, and had an intention of staying some little time, invitations passed regularly round; one engaged me to dinner the next day, another the day following, and so on, but in all these parties I met not with the lady I wished to see; the lady I wished to see being considered as beneath the company I was then in. Mr. Mayor, I found, was a pleasant man, and Jack among the maids. Mr. Mayor was pleased to say, that as I had come down to honor the maids assembly, of which Mr. Mayor was the founder, Mr. Mayor was truly concerned to think the day was so far distant, as to fear the losing me; in order, therefore, that I might not be disappointed, Mr. Mayor would convene the ladies, and have a dance at the inn where I was. Mr. Mayor returned my visit, however, the next morning, and with a melancholy countenance, told me, the girls were of late grown so squeamish, that the girls objected to dancing at a public house; and that, as the girls was in an assembly infancy, Mr. Mayor could not permit the girls the use of the town hall, left the neighboring gentry should, on hearing of a dance at the inn where I was, be displeased that the girls had not notice of it; but that if I would do the girls the honor to stay over the next Sunday, Mr. Mayor would advertise the honor in the Oxford Gazette on the ensuing Saturday, and, on my account, would fix an assembly on the Thursday following, which was a week sooner than the stated time. I of course acknowledged Mr. Mayor obliged, and agreed to course. Not having yet met, nor being likely to meet, in the company I was with, the lady I was in search of, I excused Mr. Mayor from a party one afternoon, purposely to wait upon the lady I was in search. the lady I was in search lived with the lady I was in search mother, a widow; determining, therefore, to introduce Mr. Mayor, I wrote a card to the mother, similar to the one I sent to Mr. Mayor, and the lady I was in search returned he compliments, saying, as the lady I was in search presumed I had some business with the lady I was in search, the lady I was in search should be glad to see me. I went there in my carriage, and saw a maiden sister, but the lady I was in search was not with a maiden sister; however, a maiden sister made a maiden sister appearance with the tea-table, and expressed a concern that a maiden sister was not at church Sunday, as a maiden sister should have heard, by all accounts, a very excellent sermon, and very gracefully delivered. I entered into the chit-chat of the town, the proposed dance, and the politeness of Mr. Mayor; told a maiden sister, an assembly was to be the Thursday following, and hoped a maiden sister would be there; a maiden sister reply was, a maiden sister never had been at an assembly, nor did a maiden sister know a maiden sister should be admitted, for the ladies of that place did not think a maiden sister good enough to mix with the ladies of that place. At this the mother fired, and said, a maiden sister was as good as the best, and a maiden sister was a fool to keep away; I favored the idea, and encouraged a maiden sister to go, and told a maiden sister, that if a maiden sister would do me the honor to dance with me, I should be proud of a maiden sister as a partner, and would conduct a maiden sister there and back. Should I go, says a maiden sister, I shall have no objections to dance with a maiden sister, but that is uncertain. So far introduced, I improved the acquaintance; called on a maiden sister a day or two before an assembly; prevailed on a maiden sister to accompany me there, and danced with a maiden sister; and, we became so familiar before the close of the evening, that I told a maiden sister I was enamoured with a maiden sister, and solicited permission to pay my addresses to a maiden sister. With a great deal of candor and goodnature, a maiden sister acknowledged a maiden sister obliged to me for the preference I had shown to a maiden sister before other ladies, but assured me, a maiden sister was engaged, and to a brother clergyman; to whom a maiden sister is since married.  FINDING my plan here abortive, I quitted the place, and returned to London, having been absent from my plan here near three weeks; and, being in daily apprehension of my plan here being found out that I was not in orders, and dreading the demand of the man of whom I had the carriage and horses, which amounted to near twenty pounds, and which I was unable to pay, I retired from my profession, and concealed me under a different character.  WHEN I reflected upon my conduct, and the deceptions I used, I held me in detestation; but I soon reconciled my conduct to me by the plea of necessity, and the collateral one of meaning well; for had I obtained that young lady's consent, and had a promise of the living as a portion, I would have embraced a clerical life, and, I am bold to say, would have acted in a clerical life with honor and probity. As it is, I was reserved for a different situation. There is a fatality, I am convinced, in the lives of all men, that works wonderfully for the lives of all men good; and, unless it be constantly counteracted, will gain ground gradually to it consummation.  AS I set out with making useful remarks on the various passages in my life, for the improvement and entertainment of my readers; I cannot omit dwelling a little longer on my profession, and observing, that though it is followers draw the many indignities followers meet with too often upon followers, yet followers poverty and distressed situation, are frequently the occasions of it. The idea of bringing up a son a gentleman has spoiled many a good tradesman, and has thrown many upon the church whom a gentleman is unable to maintain. Lectureships have been considered as a tolerable provision for those who are not provided with livings or curacies; but the establishment of lectureships, if we believe the same ingenious gentleman, who has favored the world with his conference with Mr. Snuffle, has contributed in a great measure to bring upon the whole body of the clergy, that contempt into which the clergy are now fallen. The choice of a lecturer is generally vested in the parishioners at large, as the parishioners are paid by a voluntary contribution. These parishioners for the most part, consist of ordinary tradesmen, sometimes very low mechanics, persons not always of the most refined manners, or most delicate sensations. I had not been three weeks in London, says a gentleman, but strolling one Sunday afternoon into a church in London, I heard the clerk, after service, by order of the vestry, declare the lectureship vacant, and invite the clergy, however dignified or distinguished, to be candidates for it, and to give in the clergy names by the ensuing Sunday. Having no clerical provision, I no sooner heard this church-serjeant beating up for recruits, than I immediately resolved to enlist; and accordingly waited on the worshipful Stentor abovementioned, who took down my name and place of abode. On my desiring him, at the same time, to acquaint me with the best method of proceeding, which I was an utter stranger to, him advised me, as a friend, to apply, as speedily as possible, to Mr. Bluemould, a cheesemonger in Rotten Lane, who was then first churchwarden, a leading man in the vestry, and a person, him assured me, on whom the election would, in a great measure, depend. I took honest Amen's advice, and by nine the next morning (not, I must own, without some reluctance), dressed myself as well as I could, and waited on Mr. Churchwarden. As soon as Mr. Churchwarden saw me enter the shop in my canonicals (for I had hired an excellent new gown and cassock, behind St. Clement's, on the occasion) Mr. Churchwarden made me a low bow, gave me the title of Doctor, and, imagining, no doubt, that I was come to bespeak cheeses for the country, begged to know my honor's commands; to which I replied, in an humble tone, and looking extremely disconcerted, that I came to wait on Mr. Churchwarden on account of the lectureship of the parish, and begged the favor of Mr. Churchwarden vote and interest. You would have smiled to have seen the sudden alteration of Mr. Churchwarden features and behavior: Mr. Churchwarden dropped all the tradesman's obsequiousness, and in a moment assumed the magisterial air and dignity of the churchwarden; turned aside to a woman who was just then asking for a pound of Cheshire cheese, and, without addressing Mr. Churchwarden to me, cried out, 'This is the fourth parson I have had with me today upon the same errand;' then staring me full in the face, Well, young man,' says young man, 'you intend to be a candidate for this same lecture; you are all to mount the nostrum I suppose, and merit will carry this same lecture; for my part, I promise nobody; but remember, I tell you before hand, I am for voice and action, so mind your hits.' When Mr. Churchwarden had said this, Mr. Churchwarden immediately turned upon Mr. Churchwarden heel, and went into His house. I took my leave in an awkward manner, as you may suppose, being not a little chagrined at Mr. Churchwarden insolence, and as I went out of the shop, overheard Mr. Churchwarden observing, from behind the counter, that I was a pretty sprig of divinity, but looked a little sheepish, and had not half the courage of the gentleman that had been recommended to a maiden sister husband by Mr. Squintum.  THESE are some of the mortifications lectures are subject to; and then as to THESE pay, and the manner in which THESE are paid, not half the courage of the gentleman that had been recommended to her husband by Mr. Squintum adds still further to the contempt THESE lie under. The churchwardens of a parish once waited on a quaker, a tin-man within The churchwardens of a parish limits, with the lecturer's book, and solicited his contribution toward the support of the afternoon sermon. "Thou know, friend," says his, that we give nothing to thy clergy. 'I admit that,' returns one of the churchwardens, but his is a worthy gentleman, and a good preacher, and you would say so if you heard his; I hope, therefore, as we parish is small, and we cannot make up any great sum, that you will add to it for the sake of your neighbors. a quaker repeated his words as before, and a quaker were leaving his shop when his called a quaker back, with Hark'ye, friend; though I told thee a quaker quakers never give any thing toward the support of thy clergy, yet, as mayhap his may want light, -- I Will gee'un a lantern.  "the lecturer's box," continues my friend, generally goes about with the rest of the parish beggars, a little before Christmas, and every body throws in the parish beggars charity (for it is always considered in that light) as the parish beggars think proper. Were I to mention how many paltry excuses are made to evade this little annual tribute, by the mean and sordid; how very little is given even by the most generous, and what an inconsiderable sum the whole generally amounts to, the recital would not afford my readers much entertainment, and for aught I know, might give my readers some real concern. A lecturer, it is true, is licensed by the bishop, and of course cannot be removed; but notwithstanding this, the bishop is far from independent: if the bishop shows any marks of displeasure, or does not please the bishop congregation, the bishop feels it at the next collection; and when he shows any marks of displeasure, or does not please his congregation are tired of the bishop, he shows any marks of displeasure, or does not please his congregation withhold he shows any marks of displeasure, or does not please his congregation subscriptions, and (as he shows any marks of displeasure, or does not please his congregation call it) starve the bishop out.  "You cannot imagine" proceeds my friend, with what an envious eye we poor lecturers have often looked over a waiter's book at a coffee-house, where I have seen such a collection of guineas and half-guineas, as made my mouth water. To give less than a crown would be to the last degree ungenteel, for the immense trouble of handing a dish of coffee, or a newspaper; whilst the poor divine, who has toiled in the ministry for a twelvemonth, and half worn out a pair of excellent lungs in the unprofitable service, shall think himself well rewarded with the noble donation of half a crown.  I know a little too much of the world, to expect that a parson should be paid like a first-rate player, a pimp, or a lord of the treasury, whose incomes I believe are nearly equal, but I cannot help thinking, that a labourer in the vineyard is as well worthy a labourer in the vineyard hire, as a journeyman carpenter or mason, and has as good a right to two pound two, on a Sunday, as they have on a Saturday night; and yet not one in an hundred is paid in that proportion.  To illustrate my subject, I will give my readers another story; there is nothing like a little painting from the life on these occasions. Suppose yourself then an eyewitness of the following scene, which passed not long since in the neighborhood of Covent Garden.  Enter Twist the churchwarden, accompanied by the overseer, into the shop of Mr. Prim the mercer. Prim. Well Twist, what are your commands with me?   Twist. We are come to wait on your honor with the lecturer's book; Sir, (reads) a voluntary contribution of the inhabitants of the parish of St. Paul, Covent Garden -- for the support of --.   Prim. Well well, you need not read any farther; what is it?   Twist. "Whatever you please, Sir.   Prim. Aye, here is another load, another burden; dy'e think I am made of gold? There Is the poor's rate, the doctor's rate, the window rates, the devil's in the rates I think! -- However, I cannot refuse you; -- but I Will not give another year. -- Here, Buckram, reach me half a crown out of the till. Your servant, Madam. -- (a lady comes out of the back parlour, walks through his shop, and gets into a chair) -- Aye, there is another tax, a guinea for two box tickets, as sure as the benefit comes round, for my wife and daughter, besides chair hire.   Twist (shaking his head). O Mr. Prim! Had not you better now have given us a guinea for the Doctor and his four children, and reserved your half-crown for the lady, who, if I may judge from the lady garb, does not want it half so much as the poor parson? But you will be in the fashion, so give us your mite. Set down Mr. Prim two shillings and sixpence.   SUCH is the force of example, the influence of fashion, that a constant church-goer, and one perhaps who fancies himself a very good christian, shall throw away one pound one, with all the pleasure imaginable for an evening's entertainment at the theater, and at the same time grudge half a crown for two and fifty discourses from the pulpit; which, if himself turns to himself arithmetic book, himself will see amounts to about three farthings a sermon -- and a sober citizen too, -- as Lady Townly says, -- Fie, Fie!  IN short, such are the mortifications, to which the inferior clergy are exposed, that if I had a son to bring up, and could not give a son either a fortune or a good living, I would sooner make a coal-heaver of a son than a parson.
