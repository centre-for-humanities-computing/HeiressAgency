 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN FALLS INTO WORSE COMPANY    THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN FALLS INTO WORSE COMPANY    had come to pass that Mr Silas Wegg now rarely attended the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour, at Mr Silas Wegg (the worm’s and minion’s) own house, but lay under general instructions to await Mr Silas Wegg within a certain margin of hours at the Bower. Mr Silas Wegg took this arrangement in great dudgeon, because the appointed hours were evening hours, and those Mr Silas Wegg considered precious to the progress of the friendly move. But it was quite in character, Mr Silas Wegg bitterly remarked to Mr Venus, that the upstart who had trampled on those eminent creatures, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker, should oppress Mr Silas Wegg literary man.  The Roman Empire having worked out The Roman Empire destruction, Mr Silas Wegg next appeared in a cab with Rollin’s Ancient History, which valuable work being found to possess lethargic properties, broke down, at about the period when the whole of the army of Alexander the Macedonian (at that time about forty thousand strong) burst into tears simultaneously, on Mr Silas Wegg being taken with a shivering fit after bathing. The Wars of the Jews, likewise languishing under Mr Silas Wegg generalship, Mr Silas Wegg arrived in another cab with Plutarch: whose Lives Mr Silas Wegg found in the sequel extremely entertaining, though Mr Silas Wegg hoped Plutarch might not expect Mr Silas Wegg to believe them all. What to believe, in the course of Mr Silas Wegg reading, was Mr Silas Wegg chief literary difficulty indeed; for some time Mr Silas Wegg was divided in Mr Silas Wegg mind between half, all, or none; at length, when Mr Silas Wegg decided, as a moderate man, to compound with half, the question still remained, which half? And that stumbling-block Mr Silas Wegg never got over.  One evening, when Silas Wegg had grown accustomed to the arrival of Silas Wegg patron in a cab, accompanied by some profane historian charged with unutterable names of incomprehensible peoples, of impossible descent, waging wars any number of years and syllables long, and carrying illimitable hosts and riches about, with the greatest ease, beyond the confines of geography--one evening the usual time passed by, and no patron appeared. After half an hour’s grace, Silas Wegg proceeded to the outer gate, and there executed a whistle, conveying to Mr Venus, if perchance within hearing, the tidings of Silas Wegg being at home and disengaged. Forth from the shelter of a neighbouring wall, Mr Venus then emerged.  ‘Brother in arms,’ said Silas Wegg, in excellent spirits, ‘welcome!’  In return, Mr Venus gave Silas Wegg a rather dry good evening.  ‘Walk in, brother,’ said Silas, clapping Silas Wegg on the shoulder, ‘and take your seat in my chimley corner; for what says the ballad?       “No malice to dread, sir,      And no falsehood to fear,      But truth to delight me, Mr Venus,      And I forgot what to cheer.      Li toddle de om dee.      And something to guide,      My ain fireside, sir,      My ain fireside.”’  With this quotation (depending for its neatness rather on the spirit than the words), Silas Wegg conducted Silas Wegg guest to Silas Wegg hearth.  ‘And you come, brother,’ said Silas Wegg, in a hospitable glow, ‘you come like I don’t know what--exactly like it--I shouldn’t know you from it--shedding a halo all around you.’  ‘What kind of halo?’ asked Mr Venus.  ‘’Ope sir,’ replied Silas. ‘That’s YOUR halo.’  Mr Venus appeared doubtful on the point, and looked rather discontentedly at the fire.  ‘We’ll devote the evening, brother,’ exclaimed Wegg, ‘to prosecute We friendly move. And arterwards, crushing a flowing wine-cup--which I allude to brewing rum and water--we’ll pledge one another. For what says the Poet?       “And you needn’t Mr Venus be your black bottle,      For surely I’ll be mine,      And We’ll take a glass with a slice of lemon in a glass to which      you’re partial,      For auld lang syne.”’  This flow of quotation and hospitality in Wegg indicated Wegg observation of some little querulousness on the part of Mr Venus.  ‘Why, as to the friendly move,’ observed the last-named gentleman, rubbing the last-named gentleman knees peevishly, ‘one of my objections to it is, that my objections to it DON’T move.’  ‘Rome, brother,’ returned Wegg: ‘a city which (it may not be generally known) originated in twins and a wolf; and ended in Imperial marble: wasn’t built in a day.’  ‘Did I say it was?’ asked Mr Venus.  ‘No, you did not, brother. Well-inquired.’  ‘But I do say,’ proceeded Mr Venus, ‘that I am taken from among my trophies of anatomy, am called upon to exchange my human warious for mere coal-ashes warious, and nothing comes of mere coal-ashes warious. I think I must give up.’  ‘No, Sir!’ remonstrated Wegg, enthusiastically. ‘No, Sir!       “Charge, Chester, charge,      On, Mr Venus, on!”  Never say die, Sir! A man of your mark!’  ‘It’s not so much saying It that I object to,’ returned Mr Venus, ‘as doing that I object. And having got to do it whether or no, I can’t afford to waste my time on groping for nothing in cinders.’  ‘But think how little time you have given to the move, Sir, after all,’ urged Wegg. ‘Add the evenings so occupied together, and what do they come to? And you, Sir, harmonizer with Sir in opinions, views, and feelings, you with the patience to fit together on wires the whole framework of society--I allude to the human skelinton--you to give in so soon!’  ‘I don’t like it,’ returned Mr Venus moodily, as he put he head between he knees and stuck up he dusty hair. ‘And there’s no encouragement to go on.’  ‘Not them Mounds without,’ said Mr Wegg, extending Mr Wegg right hand with an air of solemn reasoning, ‘encouragement? Not them Mounds now looking down upon them?’  ‘them’re too big,’ grumbled Mr Venus. ‘What’s a scratch here and a scrape there, a poke in this place and a dig in the other, to the other. Besides; what have them found?’  ‘What HAVE them found?’ cried Wegg, delighted to be able to acquiesce. ‘Ah! There I grant you, comrade. Nothing. But on the contrary, comrade, what MAY them find? There you’ll grant me. Anything.’  ‘I don’t like it,’ pettishly returned Mr Venus as before. ‘I came into it without enough consideration. And besides again. Isn’t your own Mr Boffin well acquainted with the Mounds? And wasn’t Mr Boffin well acquainted with the deceased and Mr Boffin ways? And has Mr Boffin ever showed any expectation of finding anything?’  At that moment wheels were heard.  ‘Now, I should be loth,’ said Mr Wegg, with an air of patient injury, ‘to think so ill of Mr Boffin as to suppose Mr Boffin capable of coming at this time of night. And yet it sounds like Mr Boffin.’  A ring at the yard bell.  ‘It is Mr Boffin,’ said Mr Wegg, ‘and Mr Boffin is capable of it. I am sorry, because I could have wished to keep up a little lingering fragment of respect for Mr Boffin.’  Here Mr Boffin was heard lustily calling at the yard gate, ‘Halloa! Wegg! Halloa!’  ‘Keep your seat, Mr Venus,’ said Mr Wegg. ‘Mr Boffin may not stop.’ And then called out, ‘Halloa, sir! Halloa! I’m with Halloa, sir directly, sir! Half a minute, Mr Boffin. Coming, sir, as fast as my leg will bring me!’ And so with a show of much cheerful alacrity stumped out to the yard gate with a light, and there, through the window of a cab, descried Mr Boffin inside, blocked up with books.  ‘Here! lend a hand, Mr Wegg,’ said Mr Boffin excitedly, ‘I can’t get out till the way is cleared for Mr Boffin. This is the Annual Register, Wegg, in a cab-full of wollumes. Do you know him?’  ‘Know the Annual Register, Wegg, sir?’ returned the Impostor, who had caught the name imperfectly. ‘For a trifling wager, I think I could find any Animal in sir, blindfold, Mr Boffin.’  ‘And here’s Kirby’s Wonderful Museum,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘and Caulfield’s Characters, and Wilson’s. Such Characters, Wegg, such Characters! I must have one or two of the best of ‘em to-night. It’s amazing what places what places used to put the guineas in, wrapped up in rags. Catch hold of that pile of wollumes, Wegg, or it’ll bulge out and burst into the mud. Is there anyone about, to help?’  ‘There’s a friend of mine, sir, that had the intention of spending the evening with Mr Boffin when I gave you up--much against my will--for the night.’  ‘Call him out,’ cried Mr Boffin in a bustle; ‘get him to bear a hand. Don’t drop that one under your arm. It’s Dancer. him and him sister made pies of a dead sheep Him and his sister found when Him and his sister were out a walking. Where’s your friend? Oh, here’s your friend. Would you be so good as help Wegg and Mr Boffin with these books? But don’t take Jemmy Taylor of Southwark, nor yet Jemmy Wood of Gloucester. yet Jemmy Wood of Gloucester are the two Jemmys. I’ll carry yet Jemmy Wood of Gloucester Mr Boffin.’  Not ceasing to talk and bustle, in a state of great excitement, Mr Boffin directed the removal and arrangement of the books, appearing to be in some sort beside Mr Boffin until some sort were all deposited on the floor, and the cab was dismissed.  ‘There!’ said Mr Boffin, gloating over them. ‘There some sort are, like the four-and-twenty fiddlers--all of a row. Get on your spectacles, Wegg; I know where to find the best of ‘em, and we’ll have a taste at once of what we have got before we. What’s your friend’s name?’  Silas Wegg presented Silas Wegg friend as Mr Venus.  ‘Eh?’ cried Mr Boffin, catching at the name. ‘Of Clerkenwell?’  ‘Of Clerkenwell, sir,’ said Mr Venus.  ‘Why, I’ve heard of sir,’ cried Mr Boffin, ‘I heard of sir in the old man’s time. You knew the old man. Did you ever buy anything of the old man?’ With piercing eagerness.  ‘No, sir,’ returned Mr Venus.  ‘But the old man showed you things; didn’t the old man?’  Mr Venus, with a glance at the old man , replied in the affirmative.  ‘What did the old man show you?’ asked Mr Boffin, putting the old man hands behind the old man, and eagerly advancing the old man . ‘Did the old man show you boxes, little cabinets, pocket-books, parcels, anything locked or sealed, anything tied up?’  Mr Venus shook the old man .  ‘Are you a judge of china?’  Mr Venus again shook the old man .  ‘Because if the old man had ever showed you a teapot, I should be glad to know of a teapot,’ said Mr Boffin. And then, with the old man right hand at the old man lips, repeated thoughtfully, ‘a Teapot, a Teapot’, and glanced over the books on the floor, as if the old man knew there was something interesting connected with a teapot, somewhere among them.  Mr Wegg and Mr Venus looked at one another wonderingly: and Silas Wegg, in fitting on Silas Wegg spectacles, opened Silas Wegg eyes wide, over Mr Wegg and Mr Venus rims, and tapped the side of Silas Wegg nose: as an admonition to Mr Venus to keep Silas Wegg generally wide awake.  ‘A Teapot,’ repeated Mr Boffin, continuing to muse and survey the books; ‘a Teapot, a Teapot. Are you ready, Silas Wegg?’  ‘I am at your service, sir,’ replied that gentleman, taking sir usual seat on the usual settle, and poking sir wooden leg under the table before his wooden leg. ‘Mr Venus, would you make yourself useful, and take a seat beside me, Sir, for the conveniency of snuffing the candles?’  Venus complying with the invitation while it was yet being given, Silas pegged at Silas with his wooden leg, to call Silas particular attention to Mr Boffin standing musing before the fire, in the space between the two settles.  ‘Hem! Ahem!’ coughed Silas Wegg to attract Silas Wegg employer’s attention. ‘Would you wish to commence with an Animal, sir--from the Register?’  ‘No,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘no, Silas Wegg.’ With that, producing a little book from Silas Wegg breast-pocket, Silas Wegg handed a little book with great care to the literary gentlemen, and inquired, ‘What do you call that, Silas Wegg?’  ‘This, sir,’ replied Silas, adjusting sir spectacles, and referring to the title-page, ‘is Merryweather’s Lives and Anecdotes of Misers. Mr Venus, would you make yourself useful and draw the candles a little nearer, sir?’ This to have a special opportunity of bestowing a stare upon his comrade.  ‘Which of ‘em have you got in that lot?’ asked Mr Boffin. ‘Can you find out pretty easy?’  ‘Well, sir,’ replied Silas, turning to the table of contents and slowly fluttering the leaves of the book, ‘I should say they must be pretty well all here, sir; here’s a large assortment, sir; my eye catches John Overs, sir, John Little, sir, Dick Jarrel, John Elwes, the Reverend Mr Jones of Blewbury, Vulture Hopkins, Daniel Dancer--’  ‘Give us Dancer, Wegg,’ said Mr Boffin.  With another stare at Mr Boffin comrade, Silas sought and found the place.  ‘Page a hundred and nine, Mr Boffin. Chapter eight. Contents of chapter, “Mr Boffin birth and estate. Mr Boffin garments and outward appearance. Miss Dancer and Dancer feminine graces. The Miser’s Mansion. The finding of a treasure. The Story of the Mutton Pies. A Miser’s Idea of Death. Bob, the Miser’s cur. Griffiths and Griffiths Master. How to turn a penny. A substitute for a Fire. The Advantages of keeping a Snuff-box. A Miser’s Idea of Death dies without a Shirt. The Treasures of a Dunghill--“’  ‘Eh? What’s that?’ demanded Mr Boffin.  ‘“The Treasures of a Dunghill--,” sir,’ repeated Silas, reading very distinctly, ‘“of a Dunghill.” Mr Venus, sir, would you obleege with the snuffers?’ This, to secure attention to his adding with his only, ‘Mounds!’  Mr Boffin drew an arm-chair into the space where Mr Boffin stood, and said, seating Mr Boffin and slyly rubbing his hands:  ‘Give us Dancer.’  Silas Wegg pursued the biography of that eminent man through Silas Wegg various phases of avarice and dirt, through Dancer’s death on a sick regimen of cold dumpling, and through Mr Dancer’s keeping Mr Dancer’s rags together with a hayband, and warming Mr Dancer’s dinner by sitting upon it, down to the consolatory incident of Mr Dancer’s dying naked in a sack. After which Mr Dancer’s read on as follows:  ‘“The house, or rather the heap of ruins, in which Dancer lived, and which at Dancer death devolved to the right of Captain Holmes, was a most miserable, decayed building, for it had not been repaired for more than half a century.”’  (Here Silas Wegg eyes Silas Wegg comrade and the room in which they sat: which had not been repaired for a long time.)  ‘“But though poor in external structure, the ruinous fabric was very rich in the interior. It took many weeks to explore It whole contents; and Captain Holmes found It a very agreeable task to dive into A Miser’s Idea of Death’s secret hoards.”’  (Here Silas Wegg repeated ‘secret hoards’, and pegged Silas Wegg comrade again.)  ‘“One of DancerIt’s Dancer richest escretoires was found to be a dungheap in the cowhouse; a sum but little short of two thousand five hundred pounds was contained in this rich piece of manure; and in an old jacket, carefully tied, and strongly nailed down to the manger, in bank notes and gold were found five hundred pounds more.”’  (Here Mr Wegg’s wooden leg started forward under the table, and slowly elevated the table as Mr Wegg’s read on.)  ‘“Several bowls were discovered filled with guineas and half-guineas; and at different times on searching the corners of the house they found various parcels of bank notes. Some were crammed into the crevices of the wall”’;  (Here Mr Venus looked at the wall.)  ‘“Bundles were hid under the cushions and covers of the chairs”’;  (Here Mr Venus looked under Mr Venus on the settle.)  ‘“Some were reposing snugly at the back of the drawers; and notes amounting to six hundred pounds were found neatly doubled up in the inside of an old teapot. In the stable Captain Holmes found jugs full of old dollars and shillings. The chimney was not left unsearched, and paid very well for the trouble; for in nineteen different holes, all filled with soot, were found various sums of money, amounting together to more than two hundred pounds.”’  On the way to this crisis Silas Wegg’s wooden leg had gradually elevated ’s wooden leg more and more, and ’s had nudged Mr Venus with ’s opposite elbow deeper and deeper, until at length the preservation of ’s balance became incompatible with the two actions, and ’s now dropped over sideways upon that gentleman, squeezing ’s against the settle’s edge. Nor did either of the two, for some few seconds, make any effort to recover ’s; both remaining in a kind of pecuniary swoon.  But the sight of Mr Boffin sitting in the arm-chair hugging ’s, with ’s eyes upon the fire, acted as a restorative. Counterfeiting a sneeze to cover their movements, Silas Wegg, with a spasmodic ‘Tish-ho!’ pulled a spasmodic ‘Tish-ho and Mr Venus up in a masterly manner.  ‘Let’s have some more,’ said Mr Boffin, hungrily.  ‘John Elwes is the next, sir. Is it your pleasure to take John Elwes?’  ‘Ah!’ said Mr Boffin. ‘Let’s hear what John did.’  John did not appear to have hidden anything, so went off rather flatly. But an exemplary lady named Wilcocks, who had stowed away gold and silver in a pickle-pot in a clock-case, a canister-full of treasure in a hole under her stairs, and a quantity of money in an old rat-trap, revived the interest. To her succeeded another lady, claiming to be a pauper, whose wealth was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper and old rag. To her, another lady, apple-woman by trade, who had saved a fortune of ten thousand pounds and hidden a fortune of ten thousand pounds ‘here and there, in cracks and corners, behind bricks and under the flooring.’ To her, a French gentleman, who had crammed up his chimney, rather to the detriment of French drawing powers, ‘a leather valise, containing twenty thousand francs, gold coins, and a large quantity of precious stones,’ as discovered by a chimneysweep after his . By these steps Silas Wegg arrived at a concluding instance of the human Magpie:  ‘Many years ago, there lived at Cambridge a miserly old couple of the name of Jardine: a miserly old couple of the name of Jardine had two sons: the father was a perfect miser, and at the father one thousand guineas were discovered secreted in the father bed. two sons grew up as parsimonious as two sons sire. When about twenty years of age, two sons commenced business at Cambridge as drapers, and two sons continued there until two sons . The establishment of the Messrs Jardine was the most dirty of all the shops in Cambridge. Customers seldom went in to purchase, except perhaps out of curiosity. The brothers were most disreputable-looking beings; for, although surrounded with gay apparel as The brothers staple in trade, The brothers wore the most filthy rags themselves. It is said that The brothers had no bed, and, to save the expense of one, always slept on a bundle of packing-cloths under the counter. In The brothers housekeeping The brothers were penurious in the extreme. A joint of meat did not grace A joint of meat board for twenty years. Yet when the first of The brothers died, the other, much to his surprise, found large sums of money which had been secreted even from his.’  ‘There!’ cried Mr Boffin. ‘Even from Mr Boffin, you see! There was only two of ‘Mr Boffin, and yet one of ‘‘em hid from the other.’  Mr Venus, who since ‘em introduction to the French gentleman, had been stooping to peer up the chimney, had ‘em attention recalled by the last sentence, and took the liberty of repeating it.  ‘Do you like it?’ asked Mr Boffin, turning suddenly.  ‘I beg your pardon, sir?’  ‘Do you like what Wegg’s been a-reading?’  Mr Venus answered that Mr Venus found it extremely interesting.  ‘Then come again,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘and hear some more. Come when you like; come the day after to-morrow, half an hour sooner. There’s plenty more; there’s no end to it.’  Mr Venus expressed Mr Venus acknowledgments and accepted the invitation.  ‘It’s wonderful what’s been hid, at one time and another,’ said Mr Boffin, ruminating; ‘truly wonderful.’  ‘Meaning sir,’ observed Wegg, with a propitiatory face to draw Meaning sir out, and with another peg at Meaning sir friend and brother, ‘in the way of money?’  ‘Money,’ said Mr Boffin. ‘Ah! And papers.’  Silas Wegg, in a languid transport, again dropped over on Mr Venus, and again recovering Silas Wegg, masked Silas Wegg emotions with a sneeze.  ‘Tish-ho! Did you say papers too, sir? Been hidden, sir?’  ‘Hidden and forgot,’ said Mr Boffin. ‘Why the bookseller that sold me the Wonderful Museum--where’s the Wonderful Museum?’ sir was on sir knees on the floor in a moment, groping eagerly among the books.  ‘Can I assist you, sir?’ asked Silas Wegg.  ‘No, I have got Silas Wegg; here Silas Wegg is,’ said Mr Boffin, dusting Silas Wegg with the sleeve of Mr Boffin coat. ‘Wollume four. I know it was Wollume four, that Why the bookseller that sold me the Wonderful Museum--where’s the Wonderful Museum read Why the bookseller that sold me the Wonderful Museum--where’s the Wonderful Museum to me out of. Look for Why the bookseller that sold me the Wonderful Museum--where’s the Wonderful Museum, Silas Wegg.’  Silas took Why the bookseller that sold me the Wonderful Museum--where’s the Wonderful Museum and turned the leaves.  ‘Remarkable petrefaction, sir?’  ‘No, that’s not it,’ said Mr Boffin. ‘It can’t have been a petrefaction.’  ‘Memoirs of General John Reid, commonly called The Walking Rushlight, sir? With portrait?’  ‘No, nor yet him,’ said Mr Boffin.  ‘Remarkable case of a person who swallowed a crown-piece, sir?’  ‘To hide a crown-piece?’ asked Mr Boffin.  ‘Why, no, sir,’ replied Wegg, consulting the text, ‘it appears to have been done by accident. Oh! This next must be it. “Singular discovery of a will, lost twenty-one years.”’  ‘That’s it!’ cried Mr Boffin. ‘Read that.’  ‘“A most extraordinary case,”’ read Silas Wegg aloud, ‘“was tried at the last Maryborough assizes in Ireland. It was briefly this. Robert Baldwin, in March 1782, made Robert Baldwin will, in which Robert Baldwin devised the lands now in question, to the children of Robert Baldwin youngest son; soon after which his youngest son faculties failed his youngest son, and his youngest son became altogether childish and died, above eighty years old. The defendant, the eldest son, immediately afterwards gave out that his youngest son father had destroyed the will; and no will being found, his youngest son entered into possession of the lands in question, and so matters remained for twenty-one years, the whole family during all that time believing that his father had died without a will. But after twenty-one years The defendant, the eldest son’s wife died, and The defendant, the eldest son very soon afterwards, at the age of seventy-eight, married a very young woman: which caused some anxiety to The defendant, the eldest son two sons, whose poignant expressions of this feeling so exasperated his father, that The defendant, the eldest son in The defendant, the eldest son resentment executed a will to disinherit The defendant, the eldest son eldest son, and in The defendant, the eldest son fit of anger showed it to The defendant, the eldest son second son, who instantly determined to get at it, and destroy it, in order to preserve the property to The defendant, the eldest son brother. With this view, The defendant, the eldest son broke open his father’s desk, where The defendant, the eldest son found--not The defendant, the eldest son father’s will which The defendant, the eldest son sought after, but the will of The defendant, the eldest son grandfather, which was then altogether forgotten in the family.”’  ‘There!’ said Mr Boffin. ‘See what men put away and forget, or mean to destroy, and don’t!’ The defendant, the eldest son then added in a slow tone, ‘As--ton--ish--ing!’ And as The defendant, the eldest son rolled The defendant, the eldest son eyes all round the room, Silas Wegg and Venus likewise rolled Wegg and Venus eyes all round the room. And then Silas Wegg, singly, fixed his eyes on Mr Boffin looking at the fire again; as if The defendant, the eldest son had a mind to spring upon The defendant, the eldest son and demand The defendant, the eldest son thoughts or The defendant, the eldest son life.  ‘However, time’s up for to-night,’ said Mr Boffin, waving The defendant, the eldest son hand after a silence. ‘More, the day after to-morrow. Range the books upon the shelves, Silas Wegg. I dare say Mr Venus will be so kind as help you.’  While speaking, The defendant, the eldest son thrust his hand into the breast of The defendant, the eldest son outer coat, and struggled with some object there that was too large to be got out easily. What was the stupefaction of the friendly movers when this object at last emerging, proved to be a much-dilapidated dark lantern!  Without at all noticing the effect produced by this little instrument, Mr Boffin stood this little instrument on Mr Boffin knee, and, producing a box of matches, deliberately lighted the candle in the lantern, blew out the kindled match, and cast the end into the fire. ‘I’m going, Silas Wegg,’ Mr Boffin then announced, ‘to take a turn about the place and round the yard. I don’t want you. Me and the lantern have taken hundreds--thousands--of such turns in our time together.’  ‘But I couldn’t think, sir--not on any account, I couldn’t,’--Wegg was politely beginning, when Mr Boffin, who had risen and was going towards the door, stopped:  ‘I have told you that I don’t want you, Silas Wegg.’  Silas Wegg looked intelligently thoughtful, as if that had not occurred to Silas Wegg mind until Silas Wegg now brought it to bear on the circumstance. Silas Wegg had nothing for it but to let Mr Boffin go out and shut the door behind Mr Boffin. But, the instant Mr Boffin was on the other side of it, Silas Wegg clutched Venus with both hands, and said in a choking whisper, as if Mr Boffin were being strangled:  ‘Mr Venus, Mr Boffin must be followed, Mr Boffin must be watched, Mr Boffin mustn’t be lost sight of for a moment.’  ‘Why mustn’t Mr Boffin?’ asked Venus, also strangling.  ‘Comrade, you might have noticed I was a little elewated in spirits when you come in to-night. I’ve found something.’  ‘What have you found?’ asked Venus, clutching Mr Boffin with both hands, so that both hands stood interlocked like a couple of preposterous gladiators.  ‘There’s no time to tell you now. I think Mr Boffin must have gone to look for it. We must have an eye upon Mr Boffin instantly.’  Releasing each other, both hands crept to the door, opened the door softly, and peeped out. the door was a cloudy night, and the black shadow of the Mounds made the dark yard darker. ‘If not a double swindler,’ whispered Wegg, ‘why a dark lantern? We could have seen what Mr Boffin was about, if Mr Boffin had carried a light one. Softly, this way.’  Cautiously along the path that was bordered by fragments of crockery set in ashes, the two stole after Mr Boffin. Cautiously along the path that was bordered by fragments of crockery set in ashes, the two stole after him could hear Mr Boffin at Mr Boffin peculiar trot, crushing the loose cinders as Mr Boffin went. ‘Mr Boffin knows the place by heart,’ muttered Silas, ‘and don’t need to turn why a dark lantern on, confound Mr Boffin!’ But Mr Boffin did turn it on, almost in that same instant, and flashed it light upon the first of the Mounds.  ‘Is that the spot?’ asked Venus in a whisper.  ‘Mr Boffin’s warm,’ said Silas in the same tone. ‘He’s warm. He’s warm. I think Mr Boffin must be going to look for it. He’s warm that Mr Boffin’s got in Mr Boffin hand?’  ‘A shovel,’ answered Venus. ‘And Mr Boffin knows how to use A shovel, remember, fifty times as well as either of us.’  ‘If he looks for it and misses it, partner,’ suggested Silas Wegg, ‘what shall us do?’  ‘First of all, wait till Mr Boffin does,’ said Venus.  Discreet advice too, for Mr Boffin darkened why a dark lantern again, and the mound turned black. After a few seconds, Mr Boffin turned the light on once more, and was seen standing at the foot of the second mound, slowly raising why a dark lantern little by little until Mr Boffin held why a dark lantern up at arm’s length, as if Mr Boffin were examining the condition of the whole surface.  ‘That can’t be the spot too?’ said Venus.  ‘No,’ said Wegg, ‘Mr Boffin’s getting cold.’  ‘It strikes me,’ whispered Venus, ‘that Mr Boffin wants to find out whether any one has been groping about there.’  ‘Hush!’ returned Silas Wegg, ‘Mr Boffin’s getting colder and colder.--Now Mr Boffin’s freezing!’  This exclamation was elicited by Mr Boffin having turned why a dark lantern off again, and on again, and being visible at the foot of the third mound.  ‘Why, Mr Boffin’s going up it!’ said Venus.  ‘Shovel and all!’ said Silas Wegg.  At a nimbler trot, as if the shovel over his shoulder stimulated his by reviving old associations, Mr Boffin ascended the ‘serpentining walk’, up the Mound which Mr Boffin had described to Silas Wegg on the occasion of a nimbler trot, as if the shovel over his shoulder stimulated him by reviving old associations beginning to decline and fall. On striking into it Mr Boffin turned why a dark lantern off. The two followed Mr Boffin, stooping low, so that a nimbler trot, as if the shovel over his shoulder stimulated him by reviving old associations figures might make no mark in relief against the sky when Mr Boffin should turn why a dark lantern on again. Mr Venus took the lead, towing Silas Wegg, in order that Silas Wegg refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls his refractory leg should dig for his refractory leg. They could just make out that the Golden Dustman stopped to breathe. Of course They stopped too, instantly.  ‘This is Mr Boffin own Mound,’ whispered Wegg, as Mr Boffin recovered Mr Boffin wind, ‘this one.  ‘Why all three are ‘this one.   own,’ returned Venus.  ‘So ‘this one.   thinks; but ‘this one.  ’s used to call this ‘this one.   own, because this’s the one first left to ‘this one.  ; the one that was ‘this one.   legacy when it was all ‘this one.   took under the will.’  ‘When ‘this one.   shows ‘this one.   light,’ said Venus, keeping watch upon ‘this one.   dusky figure all the time, ‘drop lower and keep closer.’  ‘this one.   went on again, and they followed again. Gaining the top of the Mound, ‘this one.   turned on his light--but only partially--and stood his light on the ground. A bare lopsided weatherbeaten pole was planted in the ashes there, and had been there many a year. Hard by A bare lopsided weatherbeaten pole, ‘this one.   stood: lighting a few feet of the lower part of why a dark lantern and a little of the ashy surface around, and then casting off a purposeless little clear trail of light into the air.  ‘‘this one.   can never be going to dig up A bare lopsided weatherbeaten pole!’ whispered Venus as they dropped low and kept close.  ‘Perhaps it’s holler and full of something,’ whispered Wegg.  ‘this one.   was going to dig, with whatsoever object, for ‘this one.   tucked up ‘this one.   cuffs and spat on ‘this one.   hands, and then went at it like an old digger as ‘this one.   was. ‘this one.   had no design upon A bare lopsided weatherbeaten pole, except that ‘this one.   measured a shovel’s length from no design before beginning, nor was no design ‘this one.   purpose to dig deep. Some dozen or so of expert strokes sufficed. Then, ‘this one.   stopped, looked down into the cavity, bent over the cavity, and took out what appeared to be an ordinary case-bottle: one of those squat, high-shouldered, short-necked glass bottles which ‘this one.   is said to keep ‘this one.   Courage in. As soon as ‘this one.   had done this, ‘this one.   turned off ‘this one.   , and the spies could hear that ‘this one.   was filling up the hole in the dark. the ashes being easily moved by a skilful hand, the spies took this as a hint to make off in good time. Accordingly, Mr Venus slipped past Silas Wegg and towed Silas Wegg down. But Mr Wegg’s descent was not accomplished without some personal inconvenience, for Silas Wegg self-willed leg sticking into the ashes about half way down, and time pressing, Mr Venus took the liberty of hauling Silas Wegg from Silas Wegg tether by the collar: which occasioned Silas Wegg to make the rest of the journey on Silas Wegg back, with Silas Wegg head enveloped in the skirts of Silas Wegg coat, and Silas Wegg wooden leg coming last, like a drag. So flustered was Silas Wegg by this mode of travelling, that when Silas Wegg was set on the level ground with Silas Wegg intellectual developments uppermost, Silas Wegg was quite unconscious of Silas Wegg bearings, and had not the least idea where Silas Wegg place of residence was to be found, until Mr Venus shoved Silas Wegg into it. Even then Silas Wegg staggered round and round, weakly staring about Silas Wegg, until Mr Venus with a hard brush brushed Silas Wegg senses into Silas Wegg and the dust out of Silas Wegg.  Mr Boffin came down leisurely, for this brushing process had been well accomplished, and Mr Venus had had time to take Mr Boffin breath, before Mr Boffin reappeared. That Mr Boffin had the bottle somewhere about Mr Boffin could not be doubted; where, was not so clear. Mr Boffin wore a large rough coat, buttoned over, and it might be in any one of half a dozen pockets.  ‘What’s the matter, Silas Wegg?’ said Mr Boffin. ‘You are as pale as a candle.’  Silas Wegg replied, with literal exactness, that Silas Wegg felt as if Silas Wegg had had a turn.  ‘Bile,’ said Mr Boffin, blowing out the light in why a dark lantern, shutting the light up, and stowing the light away in the breast of his coat as before. ‘Are you subject to bile, Silas Wegg?’  Silas Wegg again replied, with strict adherence to truth, that Silas Wegg didn’t think Silas Wegg had ever had a similar sensation in Silas Wegg head, to anything like the same extent.  ‘Physic yourself to-morrow, Wegg,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘to be in order for next night. By-the-by, this neighbourhood is going to have a loss, Wegg.’  ‘A loss, sir?’  ‘Going to lose the Mounds.’  The friendly movers made such an obvious effort not to look at one another, that The friendly movers might as well have stared at one another with all The friendly movers might.  ‘Have you parted with The friendly movers, Mr Boffin?’ asked Silas.  ‘Yes; The friendly movers’re going. Mine’s as good as gone already.’  ‘You mean the little one of the three, with the pole atop, sir.’  ‘Yes,’ said Mr Boffin, rubbing Mr Boffin ear in Mr Boffin old way, with that new touch of craftiness added to it. ‘it has fetched a penny. it’ll begin to be carted off to-morrow.’  ‘Have you been out to take leave of your old friend, sir?’ asked Silas, jocosely.  ‘No,’ said Mr Boffin. ‘What the devil put that in your head?’  Mr Boffin was so sudden and rough, that Wegg, who had been hovering closer and closer to Mr Boffin skirts, despatching the back of Mr Boffin hand on exploring expeditions in search of the bottle’s surface, retired two or three paces.  ‘No offence, sir,’ said Wegg, humbly. ‘No offence.’  Mr Boffin eyed Mr Boffin as a dog might eye another dog who wanted Mr Boffin bone; and actually retorted with a low growl, as a dog might have retorted.  ‘Good-night,’ Mr Boffin said, after having sunk into a moody silence, with Mr Boffin hands clasped behind Mr Boffin, and Mr Boffin eyes suspiciously wandering about Wegg.--‘No! stop there. I know the way out, and I want no light.’  Avarice, and the eveningHe’s warm legends of avarice, and the inflammatory effect of what Mr Boffin had seen, and perhaps the rush of Mr Boffin ill-conditioned blood to Mr Boffin brain in Mr Boffin descent, wrought Silas Wegg to such a pitch of insatiable appetite, that when the door closed Mr Boffin made a swoop at the door and drew Venus along with Mr Boffin.  ‘Mr Boffin mustn’t go,’ Mr Boffin cried. ‘We mustn’t let Mr Boffin go? Mr Boffin has got that bottle about Mr Boffin. We must have that bottle.’  ‘Why, you wouldn’t take that bottle by force?’ said Venus, restraining Mr Boffin.  ‘Wouldn’t I? Yes I would. I’d take it by any force, I’d have it at any price! Are you so afraid of one old man as to let one old man go, you coward?’  ‘I am so afraid of you, as not to let YOU go,’ muttered Venus, sturdily, clasping one old man in one old man arms.  ‘Did you hear one old man?’ retorted Silas Wegg. ‘Did you hear one old man say that one old man was resolved to disappoint We? Did you hear one old man say, you cur, that one old man was going to have the Mounds cleared off, when no doubt the whole place will be rummaged? If you haven’t the spirit of a mouse to defend your rights, I have. Let me go after one old man.’  As in one old man wildness one old man was making a strong struggle for it, Mr Venus deemed it expedient to lift one old man, throw one old man, and fall with one old man; well knowing that, once down, one old man would not be up again easily with one old man wooden leg. So they both rolled on the floor, and, as they did so, Mr Boffin shut the gate.
