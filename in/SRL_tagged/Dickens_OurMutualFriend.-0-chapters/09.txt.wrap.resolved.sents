 MR AND MRS BOFFIN IN CONSULTATION   Betaking himself straight homeward, Mr Boffin, without further let or hindrance, arrived at the Bower, and gave MRS BOFFIN (in a walking dress of black velvet and feathers, like a mourning coach-horse) an account of all he had said and done since breakfast.
‘This brings us round, my dear,’ he then pursued, ‘to the question us left unfinished: namely, whether there’s to be any new go-in for Fashion.’  ‘Now, I’ll tell you what I want, Noddy,’ said MRS BOFFIN, smoothing MRS BOFFIN dress with an air of immense enjoyment, ‘I want Society.’  ‘Fashionable Society, my dear?’  ‘Yes!’ cried MRS BOFFIN, laughing with the glee of a child.
‘Yes!
It’s no good my being kept here like Wax-Work; is It now?’  ‘People have to pay to see Wax-Work, my dear,’ returned her husband, ‘whereas (though you’d be cheap at the same money) the neighbours is welcome to see YOU for nothing.’  ‘But it don’t answer,’ said MRS BOFFINMRS BOFFIN.
‘When we worked like the neighbours, we suited one another.
Now we have left work off; we have left off suiting one another.’  ‘What, do you think of beginning work again?’ MRS BOFFIN hinted.
‘Out of the question!
we have come into a great fortune, and we must do what’s right by a great fortune; we must act up to it.’  Mr Boffin, who had a deep respect for his wife’s intuitive wisdom, replied, though rather pensively: ‘I suppose we must.’  ‘Itwhat’s never been acted up to yet, and, consequently, no good has come of It,’ said MRS BOFFIN.
‘True, to the present time,MRS BOFFIN MRS BOFFIN assented, with MRS BOFFIN former pensiveness, as MRS BOFFIN took MRS BOFFIN seat upon MRS BOFFIN settle.
‘I hope good may be coming of it in the future time.
Towards which, what’s your views, old lady?’  Mrs Boffin, a smiling creature, broad of figure and simple of nature, with her hands folded in her lap, and with buxom creases in her throat, proceeded to expound her views.
‘I say, a good house in a good neighbourhood, good things about us, good living, and good society.
I say, live like us means, without extravagance, and be happy.’  ‘Yes.
I say be happy, too,’ assented MRS BOFFINMRS BOFFIN.
‘Lor-a-mussy!’ exclaimed MRS BOFFIN, laughing and clapping her hands, and gaily rocking MRS BOFFIN to and fro, ‘when I think of me in a light yellow chariot and pair, with silver boxes to the wheels--’  ‘Oh!
you was thinking of that, was you, my dear?’  ‘Yes!’ cried the delighted creature.
‘And with a footman up behind, with a bar across, to keep a footman legs from being poled!
And with a coachman up in front, sinking down into a seat big enough for three of a footman, all covered with upholstery in green and white!
And with two bay horses tossing two bay horses heads and stepping higher than two bay horses trot long-ways!
And with you and me leaning back inside, as grand as ninepence!
Oh-h-h-h My!
Ha ha ha ha ha!’  MRS BOFFIN clapped her hands again, rocked MRS BOFFIN again, beat MRS BOFFIN feet upon the floor, and wiped the tears of laughter from MRS BOFFIN eyes.
‘And what, my old lady,’ inquired Mr Boffin, when MRS BOFFIN also had sympathetically laughed: ‘what’s your views on the subject of the Bower?’  ‘Shut the subject of the Bower up.
Don’t part with the subject of the Bower, but put somebody in the subject of the Bower, to keep the subject of the Bower.’  ‘Any other views?’  ‘Noddy,’ said MRS BOFFIN, coming from MRS BOFFIN fashionable sofa to MRS BOFFIN side on the plain settle, and hooking MRS BOFFIN comfortable arm through MRS BOFFIN, ‘Next I think--and I really have been thinking early and late--of the disappointed girl; the disappointed girl that was so cruelly disappointed, you know, both of the disappointed girl husband and his riches.
Don’t you think we might do something for the disappointed girl?
Have the disappointed girl to live with we?
Or something of that sort?’  ‘Ne-ver once thought of the way of doing it!’ cried MRS BOFFIN, smiting the table in MRS BOFFIN admiration.
‘What a thinking steam-ingein this old lady is.
And this old lady don’t know how this old lady does a thinking steam-ingein.
Neither does a thinking steam-ingein!’  MRS BOFFIN pulled MRS BOFFIN nearest ear, in acknowledgment of this piece of philosophy, and then said, gradually toning down to a motherly strain: ‘Last, and not least, I have taken a fancy.
You remember dear little John Harmon, before dear little John Harmon went to school?
Over yonder across the yard, at we fire?
Now that he is past all benefit of the money, and it’s come to we, I should like to find some orphan child, and take the boy and adopt some orphan child and give some orphan child John’s name, and provide for some orphan child.
Somehow, it would make me easier, I fancy.
Say it’s only a whim--’  ‘But I don’t say so,’ interposed her husband.
‘No, but deary, if you did--’  ‘I should be a Beast if I did,’ her husband interposed again.
‘That’s as much as to say you agree?
Good and kind of you, and like you, deary!
And don’t you begin to find it pleasant now,’ said Mrs Boffin, once more radiant in her comely way from head to foot, and once more smoothing her dress with immense enjoyment, ‘don’t you begin to find it pleasant already, to think that a child will be made brighter, and better, and happier, because of that poor sad child that day?
And isn’t it pleasant to know that the good will be done with the poor sad child’s own money?’  ‘Yes; and it’s pleasant to know that you are Mrs Boffin,’ said Mrs Boffin husband, ‘and it’s been a pleasant thing to know this many and many a year!’ It was ruin to Mrs Boffin’s aspirations, but, having so spoken, Mrs Boffin’s aspirations sat side by side, a hopelessly Unfashionable pair.
These two ignorant and unpolished people had guided These two ignorant and unpolished people so far on in These two ignorant and unpolished people journey of life, by a religious sense of duty and desire to do right.
Ten thousand weaknesses and absurdities might have been detected in the breasts of both; ten thousand vanities additional, possibly, in the breast of the woman.
But the hard wrathful and sordid nature that had wrung as much work out of Ten thousand weaknesses and absurdities might have been detected in the breasts of both; ten thousand vanities additional, possibly, in the breast of the woman as could be got in Ten thousand weaknesses and absurdities might have been detected in the breasts of both; ten thousand vanities additional, possibly, in the breast of the woman best days, for as little money as could be paid to hurry on Ten thousand weaknesses and absurdities might have been detected in the breasts of both; ten thousand vanities additional, possibly, in the breast of the woman worst, had never been so warped but that it knew Ten thousand weaknesses and absurdities might have been detected in the breasts of both; ten thousand vanities additional, possibly, in the breast of the woman moral straightness and respected it.
In its own despite, in a constant conflict with its and them, its had done so.
And this is the eternal law.
For, Evil often stops short at its and dies with the doer of its; but Good, never.
Through his most inveterate purposes, the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail had known these two faithful servants to be honest and true.
While the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail raged at these two faithful servants and reviled these two faithful servants for opposing the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail with the speech of the honest and true, it had scratched the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail stony heart, and the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail had perceived the powerlessness of all the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail wealth to buy these two faithful servants if the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail had addressed the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail to the attempt.
So, even while the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail was their griping taskmaster and never gave their a good word, the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail had written their names down in the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail will.
So, even while it was the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail daily declaration that the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail mistrusted all mankind--and sorely indeed the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail did mistrust all who bore any resemblance to the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail--the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail was as certain that these two people, surviving the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail, would be trustworthy in all things from the greatest to the least, as the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail was that the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail must surely die.
Mr and Mrs Boffin, sitting side by side, with Fashion withdrawn to an immeasurable distance, fell to discussing how Mr and Mrs Boffin, sitting side by side, with Fashion withdrawn to an immeasurable distance could best find Mr and Mrs Boffin, sitting side by side, with Fashion withdrawn to an immeasurable distance orphan.
Mrs Boffin suggested advertisement in the newspapers, requesting orphans answering annexed description to apply at the Bower on a certain day; but Mrs Boffin wisely apprehending obstruction of the neighbouring thoroughfares by orphan swarms, this course was negatived.
Mrs Boffin next suggested application to these two people clergyman for a likely orphan.
Mrs Boffin thinking better of this scheme, these two people resolved to call upon the reverend gentleman at once, and to take the same opportunity of making acquaintance with Miss Bella Wilfer.
In order that these visits might be visits of state, Mrs Boffin equipage was ordered out.
This consisted of a long hammer-headed old horse, formerly used in the business, attached to a four-wheeled chaise of the same period, which had long been exclusively used by the Harmony Jail poultry as the favourite laying-place of several discreet hens.
An unwonted application of corn to the horse, and of paint and varnish to the carriage, when both fell in as a part of the Boffin legacy, had made what Mrs Boffin considered a neat turn-out of the whole; and a driver being added, in the person of a long hammer-headed young man who was a very good match for the horse, left nothing to be desired.
a long hammer-headed young man who was a very good match for the horse, too, had been formerly used in the business, but was now entombed by an honest jobbing tailor of the Bower district in a perfect Sepulchre of coat and gaiters, sealed with ponderous buttons.
Behind this domestic, Mr and Mrs Boffin took Mr and Mrs Boffin seats in the back compartment of the vehicle: which was sufficiently commodious, but had an undignified and alarming tendency, in getting over a rough crossing, to hiccup itself away from the front compartment.
On Mr and Mrs Boffin being descried emerging from the gates of the Bower, the neighbourhood turned out at door and window to salute the Boffins.
Among those who were ever and again left behind, staring after the equipage, were many youthful spirits, who hailed it in stentorian tones with such congratulations as ‘Nod-dy Bof-fin!’ ‘Bof-finwhat’s mon-ey!’ ‘Down with the dust, Bof-fin!’ and other similar compliments.
other similar compliments, the hammer-headed young man took in such ill part that the hammer-headed young man often impaired the majesty of the progress by pulling up short, and making as though the hammer-headed young man would alight to exterminate the offenders; a purpose from which the hammer-headed young man only allowed the hammer-headed young man to be dissuaded after long and lively arguments with the hammer-headed young man employers.
At length the Bower district was left behind, and the peaceful dwelling of the Reverend Frank Milvey was gained.
the Reverend Frank Milveythe Reverend Frank Milvey abode was a very modest abode, because the Reverend Frank Milvey income was a very modest income.
the Reverend Frank Milvey was officially accessible to every blundering old woman who had incoherence to bestow upon the Reverend Frank Milvey, and readily received the Boffins.
the Reverend Frank Milvey was quite a young man, expensively educated and wretchedly paid, with quite a young wife and half a dozen quite young children.
the Reverend Frank Milvey was under the necessity of teaching and translating from the classics, to eke out the Reverend Frank Milvey scanty means, yet was generally expected to have more time to spare than the idlest person in the parish, and more money than the richest.
the Reverend Frank Milvey accepted the needless inequalities and inconsistencies of the Reverend Frank Milvey life, with a kind of conventional submission that was almost slavish; and any daring layman who would have adjusted such burdens as the Reverend Frank Milvey, more decently and graciously, would have had small help from the Reverend Frank Milvey.
With a ready patient face and manner, and yet with a latent smile that showed a quick enough observation of Mrs Boffin’s dress, Mr Milvey, in Mrs Boffin’s little book-room--charged with sounds and cries as though the six children above were coming down through the ceiling, and the roasting leg of mutton below were coming up through the floor--listened to Mrs Boffin statement of Mrs Boffin want of an orphan.
‘I think,’ said Mr Milvey, ‘that you have never had a child of your own, Mr and MRS BOFFIN?’  Never.
‘But, like the Kings and Queens in the Fairy Tales, I suppose you have wished for one?’  In a general way, yes.
the Reverend Frank Milvey smiled again, as the Reverend Frank Milvey remarked to the Reverend Frank Milvey ‘the Kings and Queens in the Fairy Tales were always wishing for children.’ It occurring to the Reverend Frank Milvey, perhaps, that if the Kings and Queens in the Fairy Tales had been Curates, the Kings and Queens in the Fairy Tales wishes might have tended in the opposite direction.
‘I think,’ the Reverend Frank Milvey pursued, ‘we had better take the Reverend Frank Milvey into we Council.
the Reverend Frank Milvey is indispensable to the Reverend Frank Milvey.
If you please, I’ll call the Reverend Frank Milvey.’  So, the Reverend Frank Milvey called, ‘Margaretta, my dear!’ and the Reverend Frank Milvey came down.
A pretty, bright little woman, something worn by anxiety, who had repressed many pretty tastes and bright fancies, and substituted in their stead, schools, soup, flannel, coals, and all the week-day cares and Sunday coughs of a large population, young and old.
As gallantly had the Reverend Frank Milvey repressed much in the Reverend Frank Milvey that naturally belonged to the Reverend Frank Milvey old studies and old fellow-students, and taken up among the poor and his old studies and old fellow-students children with the hard crumbs of life.
‘Mr and Mrs Boffin, my dear, whose good fortune you have heard of.’  the Reverend Frank Milvey, with the most unaffected grace in the world, congratulated Mrs Milvey, with the most unaffected grace in the world, and was glad to see Mrs Milvey, with the most unaffected grace in the world.
Yet her engaging face, being an open as well as a perceptive one, was not without her husband’s latent smile.
‘Mrs Boffin wishes to adopt a little boy, my dear.’  the Reverend Frank Milvey, looking rather alarmed, the Reverend Frank Milvey husband added:  ‘An orphan, my dear.’  ‘Oh!’ said Mrs Milvey, reassured for Mrs Milvey own little boys.
‘And I was thinking, Margaretta, that perhaps old Mrs Goody’s grandchild might answer the purpose.
‘Oh my DEAR Frank!
I DON’T think that would do!’  ‘No?’  ‘Oh NO!’  Mrs BoffinMrs Boffin, feeling Mrs Boffin incumbent on Mrs Boffin to take part in the conversation, and being charmed with the emphatic little wife and Mrs Boffin ready interest, here offered Mrs Boffin acknowledgments and inquired what there was against Mrs Boffin?
‘I DON’T think,’ said Mrs Milvey, glancing at the Reverend Frank, ‘--and I believe her husband will agree with I DON’T when her husband considers it again--that you could possibly keep that orphan clean from snuff.
Because her husband grandmother takes so MANY ounces, and drops so MANY ounces over her husband.’  ‘But her husband would not be living with his grandmother then, Margaretta,’ said the Reverend Frank Milvey.
‘No, the Reverend Frank, but it would be impossible to keep the Reverend Frank from Mrs Boffinhouse; and the MORE there was to eat and drink there, the oftener the Reverend Frank would go.
And the Reverend Frank IS an inconvenient woman.
I HOPE itwhat’s not uncharitable to remember that last Christmas Eve the Reverend Frank drank eleven cups of tea, and grumbled all the time.
And the Reverend Frank is NOT a grateful woman, the Reverend Frank.
You recollect the Reverend Frank addressing a crowd outside Mrs Boffin’s house, about the Reverend Frank wrongs, when, one night after we had gone to bed, the Reverend Frank brought back the petticoat of new flannel that had been given the Reverend Frank, because it was too short.’  ‘That’s true,’ said the Reverend Frank Milvey.
‘I don’t think that would do.
Would little Harrison--’  ‘Oh, the Reverend Frank!’ remonstrated the Reverend Frank emphatic wife.
‘the Reverend Frank has no grandmother, my dear.’  ‘No, but I DON’T think Mrs Boffin would like an orphan who squints so MUCH.’  ‘That’s true again,’ said the Reverend Frank Milvey, becoming haggard with perplexity.
‘If a little girl would do--’  ‘But, my DEAR Frank, Mrs Boffin wants a boy.’  ‘That’s true again,’ said the Reverend Frank Milvey.
‘Tom Bocker is a nice boy’ (thoughtfully).
‘But I DOUBT, the Reverend Frank,the Reverend Frank Milvey the Reverend Frank Milvey hinted, after a little hesitation, ‘if Mrs Boffin wants an orphan QUITE nineteen, who drives a cart and waters the roads.’  the Reverend Frank Milvey referred the point to Mrs Boffin in a look; on that smiling lady’s shaking Mrs Boffin black velvet bonnet and bows, the Reverend Frank Milvey remarked, in lower spirits, ‘that’s true again.’  ‘I am sure,’ said Mrs Boffin, concerned at giving so much trouble, ‘that if I had known you would have taken so much pains, sir--and you too, ma’ am--I don’t think I would have come.’  ‘PRAY don’t say that!’ urged the Reverend Frank Milvey.
‘No, don’t say that,’ assented the Reverend Frank Milvey, ‘because we are so much obliged to you for giving we the preference.’ Which the Reverend Frank Milvey confirmed; and really the kind, conscientious couple spoke, as if conscientious couple kept some profitable orphan warehouse and were personally patronized.
‘But it is a responsible trust,’ added the Reverend Frank Milvey, ‘and difficult to discharge.
At the same time, we are naturally very unwilling to lose the chance you so kindly give we, and if you could afford we a day or two to look about us,--you know, Margaretta, we might carefully examine the workhouse, and the Infant School, and the Bower district.’  ‘To be SURE!’ said the emphatic little wife.
‘we have orphans, I know,’ pursued Mr Milvey, quite with the air as if Mr Milvey might have added, ‘in stock,’ and quite as anxiously as if there were great competition in the business and Mr Milvey were afraid of losing an order, ‘over at the clay-pits; but over at the clay-pits are employed by relations or friends, and I am afraid it would come at last to a transaction in the way of barter.
And even if you exchanged blankets for the child--or books and firing--it would be impossible to prevent the child--or books and firing being turned into liquor.’  Accordingly, it was resolved that Mr and the Reverend Frank Milvey should search for an orphan likely to suit, and as free as possible from the foregoing objections, and should communicate again with Mrs Boffin.
Then, Mrs Boffin took the liberty of mentioning to the Reverend Frank Milvey that if the Reverend Frank Milvey would do the Reverend Frank Milvey the kindness to be perpetually the Reverend Frank Milvey banker to the extent of ‘a twenty-pound note or so,’ to be expended without any reference to the Reverend Frank Milvey, the Reverend Frank Milvey would be heartily obliged.
At this, both the Reverend Frank Milvey and the Reverend Frank Milvey were quite as much pleased as if Mr Milvey and Mrs Milvey had no wants of Mr Milvey and Mrs Milvey own, but only knew what poverty was, in the persons of other people; and so the interview terminated with satisfaction and good opinion on all sides.
‘Now, old lady,’ said Mrs Boffin, as they resumed they seats behind the hammer-headed horse and man: ‘having made a very agreeable visit there, we’ll try Wilfer’s.’  It appeared, on their drawing up at the family gate, that to try Wilfer’s was a thing more easily projected than done, on account of the extreme difficulty of getting into that establishment; three pulls at the bell producing no external result; though each was attended by audible sounds of scampering and rushing within.
At the fourth tug--vindictively administered by the hammer-headed young man--Miss Lavinia appeared, emerging from the house in an accidental manner, with a bonnet and parasol, as designing to take a contemplative walk.
old lady was astonished to find visitors at the family gate, and expressed old lady feelings in appropriate action.
‘Here’s Mr and MRS BOFFIN!’ growled the hammer-headed young man through the bars of the family gate, and at the same time shaking it, as if the hammer-headed young man were on view in a Menagerie; ‘they’ve been here half an hour.’  ‘Who did you say?’ asked Miss Lavinia.
‘Mr and MRS BOFFIN’ returned the young man, rising into a roar.
Miss Lavinia tripped up the steps to the house-door, tripped down the steps with the key, tripped across the little garden, and opened the family gate.
‘Please to walk in,’ said Miss Lavinia, haughtily.
‘Our servant is out.’  Mr and Mrs BOFFIN complying, and pausing in the little hall until Miss Lavinia came up to show them where to go next, perceived three pairs of listening legs upon the stairs above.
Mrs Wilfer’s legs, Miss Bella’s legs, Mr George Sampson’s legs.
‘Mr and Mrs BOFFIN, I think?’ said Lavinia, in a warning voice.
Strained attention on the part of Mrs Wilfer’s legs, of Miss Bella’s legs, of Mr George Sampson’s legs.
‘Yes, Miss.’  ‘If you’ll step this way--down these stairs--I’ll let Ma know.’ Excited flight of Mrs Wilfer’s legs, of Miss Bella’s legs, of Mr George Sampson’s legs.
After waiting some quarter of an hour alone in the family sitting-room, which presented traces of having been so hastily arranged after a meal, that one might have doubted whether it was made tidy for visitors, or cleared for blindman’s buff, Mr and MRS BOFFIN became aware of the entrance of Mrs Wilfer’s, majestically faint, and with a condescending stitch in MRS BOFFIN side: which was MRS BOFFIN company manner.
‘Pardon me,’ said Mrs Wilfer, after the first salutations, and as soon as MRS BOFFIN had adjusted the handkerchief under MRS BOFFIN chin, and waved MRS BOFFIN gloved hands, ‘to what am I indebted for this honour?’  ‘To make short of this honour, ma’am,’ returned Mrs Boffin, ‘perhaps you may be acquainted with the names of me and Mrs Boffin, as having come into a certain property.’  ‘I have heard, sir,’ returned Mrs Wilfer’s, with a dignified bend of Mrs Wilfer’s head, ‘of such being the case.’  ‘And I dare say, ma’am,’ pursued Mrs Boffin, while Mrs Boffin added confirmatory nods and smiles, ‘you are not very much inclined to take kindly to us?’  ‘Pardon me,’ said Mrs Wilfer’s.
‘’Twere unjust to visit upon Mr and Mrs Boffin, a calamity which was doubtless a dispensation.’ These words were rendered the more effective by a serenely heroic expression of suffering.
‘Thatwhat’s fairly meant, I am sure,’ remarked the honest Mr Boffin; ‘Mrs Boffin and me, ma’am, are plain people, and us don’t want to pretend to anything, nor yet to go round and round at anything because therewhat’s always a straight way to everything.
Consequently, us make this call to say, that us shall be glad to have the honour and pleasure of your daughterwhat’s acquaintance, and that us shall be rejoiced if your daughter’s will come to consider us house in the light of your daughter’s home equally with this.
In short, us want to cheer your daughter’s, and to give your daughter’s the opportunity of sharing such pleasures as us are a going to take us.
us want to brisk your daughter’s up, and brisk your daughter’s about, and give your daughter’s a change.’  ‘That’s it!’ said Mrs Boffin.
‘Lor!
Letwhat’s be comfortable.’  Mrs Wilfer’s bent Mrs Wilfer’s head in a distant manner to Mrs Wilfer’s lady visitor, and with majestic monotony replied to the gentleman:  ‘Pardon me.
I have several daughters.
Which of several daughters am I to understand is thus favoured by the kind intentions of Mrs Boffin and old lady?’  ‘Don’t you see?’ Mrs Boffin put in.
‘Naturally, Miss Bella, you know.’  ‘Oh-h!’ said Mrs Wilfer’s, with a severely unconvinced look.
‘your daughter’s is accessible and shall speak for your daughter’s.’ Then opening the door a little way, simultaneously with a sound of scuttling outside the door, old lady made the proclamation, ‘Send your daughter’s your daughter’s to old lady!’ which proclamation, though grandly formal, and one might almost say heraldic, to hear, was in fact enunciated with your daughter’s maternal eyes reproachfully glaring on that young lady in the flesh--and in so much of it that your daughter’s was retiring with difficulty into the small closet under the stairs, apprehensive of the emergence of Mr and Mrs Boffin.
‘The avocations of R. W., my husband,Mrs Wilfer’s Mrs Wilfer’s explained, on resuming Mrs Wilfer’s seat, ‘keep Mrs Wilfer’s fully engaged in the City at this time of the day, or Mrs Wilfer’s would have had the honour of participating in your reception beneath our humble roof.’  ‘Very pleasant premises!’ said Mrs Boffin, cheerfully.
‘Pardon me, sir,’ returned Mrs Wilfer, correcting him, ‘it is the abode of conscious though independent Poverty.’  Finding it rather difficult to pursue the conversation down this road, Mr and Mrs BOFFIN sat staring at mid-air, and Mrs Wilfer’s sat silently giving Mr and Mrs BOFFIN to understand that every breath Mrs Wilfer’s drew required to be drawn with a self-denial rarely paralleled in history, until your daughter’s your daughter’s appeared: whom Mrs Wilfer’s presented, and to whom Mrs Wilfer’s explained the purpose of the visitors.
‘I am much obliged to you, I am sure,’ said Miss your daughter’s, coldly shaking your daughter’s curls, ‘but I doubt if I have the inclination to go out at all.’  ‘your daughter’s Mrs Wilfer’s admonished Mrs Wilfer’s; ‘your daughter’s, you must conquer this.’  ‘Yes, do what Ma Ma says, and conquer it, my dear,’ urged Mrs Boffin, ‘because we shall be so glad to have you, and because you are much too pretty to keep yourself shut up.’ With that, the pleasant creature gave your daughter’s a kiss, and patted your daughter’s on your daughter’s dimpled shoulders; Mrs Wilfer’s sitting stiffly by, like a functionary presiding over an interview previous to an execution.
‘We are going to move into a nice house,’ said Mrs Boffin, who was woman enough to compromise Mrs Boffin on that point, when Mrs Boffin couldn’t very well contest it; ‘and We are going to set up a nice carriage, and We’ll go everywhere and see everything.
And you mustn’t,’ seating your daughter’s beside your daughter’s, and patting your daughter’s hand, ‘you mustn’t feel a dislike to We to begin with, because We couldn’t help it, you know, my dear.’  With the natural tendency of youth to yield to candour and sweet temper, your daughter’s your daughter’s was so touched by the simplicity of this address that your daughter’s frankly returned Mrs Boffin’s kiss.
Not at all to the satisfaction of that good woman of the world, your daughter’s mother, who sought to hold the advantageous ground of obliging the Boffins instead of being obliged.
‘My youngest daughter, Lavinia,’ said Mrs Wilfer, glad to make a diversion, as old lady reappeared.
‘Mr George Sampson, a friend of the family.’  The friend of the family was in that stage of tender passion which bound The friend of the family to regard everybody else as the foe of the family.
The friend of the family put the round head of The friend of the family cane in The friend of the family mouth, like a stopper, when The friend of the family sat down.
As if The friend of the family felt The friend of the family full to the throat with affronting sentiments.
And The friend of the family eyed the Boffins with implacable eyes.
‘If you like to bring your sister with you when you come to stay with us,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘of course us shall be glad.
The better you please you, your daughter’s, the better you’ll please us.’  ‘Oh, my consent is of no consequence at all, I suppose?’ cried Miss Lavinia.
‘Lavvy,’ said Lavvy sister, in a low voice, ‘have the goodness to be seen and not heard.’  ‘No, I won’t,’ replied Miss LaviniaMiss Lavinia.
‘I’m not a child, to be taken notice of by strangers.’  ‘You ARE a child.’  ‘I’m not a child, and I won’t be taken notice of.
“Bring your sister,”  indeed!’  ‘Miss Lavinia!’ said Mrs Wilfer’s.
‘Hold!
I will not allow you to utter in my presence the absurd suspicion that any strangers--I care not what any strangers names--can patronize my child.
Do you dare to suppose, you ridiculous girl, that Mr and Mrs BOFFIN would enter these doors upon a patronizing errand; or, if Mr and Mrs BOFFIN did, would remain within these doors, only for one single instant, while your mother had the strength yet remaining in your mother vital frame to request these doors to depart?
You little know your mother if you presume to think so.’  ‘It’s all very fine,Miss Lavinia Miss Lavinia began to grumble, when Mrs Wilfer’s repeated:  ‘Hold!
I will not allow this.
Do you not know what is due to guests?
Do you not comprehend that in presuming to hint that this lady and gentleman could have any idea of patronizing any member of your family--I care not which--you accuse this lady and gentleman of an impertinence little less than insane?’  ‘Never mind me and Mrs Boffin, ma’am,’ said Mr Boffin, smilingly: ‘we don’t care.’  ‘Pardon me, but I do,’ returned Mrs Wilfer’s.
Miss Lavinia Miss Lavinia laughed a short laugh as Miss Lavinia muttered, ‘Yes, to be sure.’  ‘And I require my audacious child,’ proceeded Mrs Wilfer’s, with a withering look at Miss Lavinia youngest, on whom it had not the slightest effect, ‘to please to be just to Miss Lavinia sister Bella; to remember that her sister Bella is much sought after; and that when her sister Bella accepts an attention, her sister Bella considers her sister Bella to be conferring qui-i-ite as much honour,’--this with an indignant shiver,--‘as her sister Bella receives.’  But, here your daughter’s your daughter’s repudiated, and said quietly, ‘I can speak for your daughter’s; you know, ma.
You needn’t bring ME in, please.’  ‘And it’s all very well aiming at others through convenient me,’ said the irrepressible Lavinia, spitefully; ‘but I should like to ask George Sampson what George Sampson says to it.’  ‘George Sampson,’ proclaimed Mrs Wilfer’s, seeing that young gentleman take young gentleman stopper out, and so darkly fixing young gentleman with young gentleman eyes as that young gentleman put it in again: ‘George Sampson, as a friend of this family and a frequenter of this house, is, I am persuaded, far too well-bred to interpose on such an invitation.’  This exaltation of the young gentleman moved the conscientious Mrs Boffin to repentance for having done Mrs Boffin an injustice in Mrs Boffin mind, and consequently to saying that Mrs Boffin and Mrs Boffin would at any time be glad to see Mrs Boffin; an attention which Mrs Boffin handsomely acknowledged by replying, with his stopper unremoved, ‘Much obliged to you, but I’m always engaged, day and night.’  However, your daughter’s compensating for all drawbacks by responding to the advances of the Boffins in an engaging way, that easy pair were on the whole well satisfied, and proposed to the said your daughter’s that as soon as easy pair should be in a condition to receive your daughter’s in a manner suitable to easy pair desires, Mrs Boffin should return with notice of the fact.
This arrangement Mrs Wilfer’s sanctioned with a stately inclination of Mrs Wilfer’s head and wave of Mrs Wilfer’s gloves, as who should say, ‘Your demerits shall be overlooked, and you shall be mercifully gratified, poor people.’  ‘By-the-bye, ma’am,’ said Mrs Boffin, turning back as Mrs Boffin was going, ‘you have a lodger?’  ‘A gentleman,Mrs Wilfer’s Mrs Wilfer’s answered, qualifying the low expression, ‘undoubtedly occupies our first floor.’  ‘I may call Mrs Wilfer’s our Mutual Friend,’ said Mrs Boffin.
‘What sort of a fellow IS Our Mutual Friend, now?
Do you like Mrs Wilfer’s?’  ‘Mrs Boffin is very punctual, very quiet, a very eligible inmate.’  ‘Because,Mrs Boffin explained, ‘you must know that I’m not particularly well acquainted with our Mutual Friend, for I have only seen Mrs Wilfer’s once.
You give a good account of Mrs Wilfer’s.
Is Mrs Wilfer’s at home?’  ‘Mrs Boffin is at home,’ said Mrs Wilfer’s; ‘indeed,’ pointing through the window, ‘there Mrs Boffin stands at the garden gate.
Waiting for you, perhaps?’  ‘Perhaps so,’ replied Mrs Boffin.
‘Saw me come in, maybe.’  your daughter’s had closely attended to this short dialogue.
Accompanying Mrs Boffin to the garden gate, your daughter’s as closely watched what followed.
‘How are you, sir, how are you?’ said Mrs Boffin.
‘This is Mrs Boffin.
Mrs Boffin, that I told you of; my dear.’  your daughter’s gave sir good day, and sir bestirred sir and helped your daughter’s to your daughter’s seat, and the like, with a ready hand.
‘Good-bye for the present, your daughter’s,’ said Mrs Boffin, calling out a hearty parting.
‘We shall meet again soon!
And then I hope I shall have my little John Harmon to show you.’  Mr Rokesmith, who was at the wheel adjusting the skirts of your daughter’s dress, suddenly looked behind sir, and around sir, and then looked up at your daughter’s, with a face so pale that Mrs Boffin cried:  ‘Gracious!’ And after a moment, ‘What’s the matter, sir?’  ‘How can you show your daughter’s the Dead?’ returned Mrs Boffin.
‘It’s only an adopted child.
One I have told your daughter’s of.
One I’m going to give the name to!’  ‘You took me by surprise,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘and it sounded like an omen, that you should speak of showing the Dead to one so young and blooming.’  Now, your daughter’s suspected by this time that Mrs Boffin admired your daughter’s.
Whether the knowledge (for it was rather that than suspicion) caused your daughter’s to incline to Mrs Boffin a little more, or a little less, than your daughter’s had done at first; whether the knowledge (for it was rather that than suspicion) rendered your daughter’s eager to find out more about Mrs Boffin, because your daughter’s sought to establish reason for your daughter’s distrust, or because your daughter’s sought to free Mrs Boffin from the knowledge (for it was rather that than suspicion); was as yet dark to your daughter’s own heart.
But at most times Mrs Boffin occupied a great amount of your daughter’s attention, and your daughter’s had set her attention closely on this incident.
That Mrs Boffin knew it as well as your daughter’s, your daughter’s knew as well as Mrs Boffin, when they were left together standing on the path by the garden gate.
‘Those are worthy people, Mrs Wilfer’s.’  ‘Do you know Those well?’ asked your daughter’s.
Mrs Boffin smiled, reproaching your daughter’s, and your daughter’s coloured, reproaching your daughter’s--both, with the knowledge that your daughter’s had meant to entrap Mrs Boffin into an answer not true--when Mrs Boffin said ‘I know OF Those.’  ‘Truly, Mrs Boffin told us Mrs Boffin had seen you but once.’  ‘Truly, I supposed Mrs Boffin did.’  your daughter’s was nervous now, and would have been glad to recall your daughter’s question.
‘You thought it strange that, feeling much interested in you, I should start at what sounded like a proposal to bring you into contact with the murdered man who lies in Mrs Boffin grave.
I might have known--of course in a moment should have known--that it could not have that meaning.
But my interest remains.’  Re-entering the family-room in a meditative state, your daughter’s your daughter’s was received by Miss Lavinia with:  ‘There, your daughter’s!
At last I hope you have got your wishes realized--by your Boffins.
You’ll be rich enough now--with your Boffinsyour Boffins.
You can have as much flirting as you like--at your Boffinsyour Boffins.
But you won’t take ME to your Boffinsyour Boffins, I can tell you--you and your your Boffins too!’  ‘If,’ quoth Mr George Sampson, moodily pulling Mr George Sampson stopper out, ‘Miss your daughter’s’s Mr Boffin comes any more of Mr George Sampson nonsense to ME, I only wish Mr George Sampson to understand, as betwixt man and man, that Mr George Sampson does it at Mr George Sampson per--’ and was going to say peril; but Miss Lavinia, having no confidence in Mr George Sampson mental powers, and feeling Mr George Sampson oration to have no definite application to any circumstances, jerked his stopper in again, with a sharpness that made Mr George Sampson eyes water.
And now Mrs Wilfer’sMrs Wilfer’s, having used Mrs Wilfer’s youngest daughter as a lay-figure for the edification of these Boffins, became bland to her youngest daughter, and proceeded to develop her youngest daughter last instance of force of character, which was still in reserve.
This was, to illuminate the family with her youngest daughter remarkable powers as a physiognomist; powers that terrified R. W. when ever let loose, as being always fraught with gloom and evil which no inferior prescience was aware of.
And Mrs Wilfer’s Mrs Wilfer’s now did, be Mrs Wilfer’s observed, in jealousy of these Boffins, in the very same moments when her youngest daughter was already reflecting how her youngest daughter would flourish these very same Boffins and the state they kept, over the heads of her youngest daughter Boffinless friends.
‘Of their manners,’ said Mrs Wilfer’s, ‘I say nothing.
Of their appearance, I say nothing.
Of the disinterestedness of their intentions towards your daughter’s, I say nothing.
But the craft, the secrecy, the dark deep underhanded plotting, written in Mrs Boffin countenance, make me shudder.’  As an incontrovertible proof that those baleful attributes were all there, Mrs Wilfer’s shuddered on the spot.
