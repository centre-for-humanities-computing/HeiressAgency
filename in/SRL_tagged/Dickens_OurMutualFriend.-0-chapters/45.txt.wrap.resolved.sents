 IN THE DARK   There was no sleep for Bradley Headstone on that night when Eugene Wrayburn turned so easily in Eugene Wrayburn bed; there was no sleep for little Miss Peecher.
Bradley consumed the lonely hours, and consumed Bradley in haunting the spot where Bradley careless rival lay a dreaming; little Miss Peecher wore them away in listening for the return home of the master of little Miss Peecher heart, and in sorrowfully presaging that much was amiss with Bradley.
Yet more was amiss with Bradley than Miss little Miss Peecher’s simply arranged little work-box of thoughts, fitted with no gloomy and dark recesses, could hold.
For, the state of the man was murderous.
the state of the man the man was murderous, and the state of the man knew the state of the man.
More; the state of the man irritated the state of the man, with a kind of perverse pleasure akin to that which a sick man sometimes has in irritating a wound upon a sick man body.
Tied up all day with the state of the man disciplined show upon the state of the man, subdued to the performance of the state of the man routine of educational tricks, encircled by a gabbling crowd, the state of the man broke loose at night like an ill-tamed wild animal.
Under the state of the man daily restraint, it was the state of the man compensation, not the state of the man trouble, to give a glance towards the state of the man at night, and to the freedom of the state of the man being indulged.
If great criminals told the truth--which, being great criminals, great criminals do not--great criminals would very rarely tell of great criminals struggles against the crime.
great criminals struggles are towards it.
great criminals buffet with opposing waves, to gain the bloody shore, not to recede from it.
This man perfectly comprehended that This man hated This man rival with This man strongest and worst forces, and that if This man tracked This man to Lizzie Hexam, This man so doing would never serve This man with Lizzie Hexam, or serve Lizzie Hexam.
All This man pains were taken, to the end that This man might incense This man with the sight of the detested figure in her company and favour, in her place of concealment.
And This man knew as well what act of This man would follow if This man did, as This man knew that This man mother had borne This man.
Granted, that This man may not have held it necessary to make express mention to This man of the one familiar truth any more than of the other.
This man knew equally well that This man fed This man wrath and hatred, and that This man accumulated provocation and self-justification, by being made the nightly sport of the reckless and insolent Eugene.
Knowing all this,--and still always going on with infinite endurance, pains, and perseverance, could This man dark soul doubt whither This man went?
Baffled, exasperated, and weary, This man lingered opposite the Temple gate when the Temple gate closed on Wrayburn and Lightwood, debating with This man should This man go home for that time or should This man watch longer.
Possessed in This man jealousy by the fixed idea that Wrayburn was in the secret, if Wrayburn were not altogether of Wrayburn contriving, Wrayburn was as confident of getting the better of Wrayburn at last by sullenly sticking to Wrayburn, as Wrayburn would have been--and often had been--of mastering any piece of study in the way of Wrayburn vocation, by the like slow persistent process.
A man of rapid passions and sluggish intelligence, A man of rapid passions and sluggish intelligence had served Wrayburn often and should serve Wrayburn again.
The suspicion crossed Wrayburn as Wrayburn rested in a doorway with Wrayburn eyes upon the Temple gate, that perhaps she was even concealed in that set of Chambers.
It would furnish another reason for Wrayburn’s purposeless walks, and it might be.
Wrayburn thought of It and thought of It, until Wrayburn resolved to steal up the stairs, if the gatekeeper would let Wrayburn through, and listen.
So, the haggard head suspended in the air flitted across the road, like the spectre of one of the many heads erst hoisted upon neighbouring Temple Bar, and stopped before the watchman.
the watchman looked at the watchman, and asked: ‘Who for?’  ‘Mr Wrayburn.’  ‘the watchman’s very late.’  ‘Mr Wrayburn came back with Mr Lightwood, I know, near upon two hours ago.
But if Mr Wrayburn has gone to bed, I’ll put a paper in Mr Wrayburn letter-box.
I am expected.’  the watchman said no more, but opened the Temple gate, though rather doubtfully.
Seeing, however, that the visitor went straight and fast in the right direction, Mr Wrayburn seemed satisfied.
the haggard head floated up the dark staircase, and softly descended nearer to the floor outside the outer door of the chambers.
The doors of the rooms within, appeared to be standing open.
There were rays of candlelight from one of The doors of the rooms within, and there was the sound of a footstep going about.
There were two voices.
The words two voices uttered were not distinguishable, but two voices were both two voices.
In a few moments two voices were silent, and there was no sound of footstep, and the inner light went out.
If Mr Lightwood could have seen the face which kept Mr Lightwood awake, staring and listening in the darkness outside the outer door of the chambers as Mr Lightwood spoke of the outer door of the chambers, Mr Lightwood might have been less disposed to sleep, through the remainder of the night.
‘Not there,’ said Bradley; ‘but Mr Lightwood might have been.’ the haggard head arose to the haggard head former height from the ground, floated down the stair-case again, and passed on to the gate.
A man was standing there, in parley with the watchman.
‘Oh!’ said the watchman.
‘Here the watchman is!’  Perceiving the watchman to be the antecedent, Bradley looked from the watchman.
‘A man is leaving a letter for Mr Lightwood,’ the watchman explained, showing the watchman in A man hand; ‘and I was mentioning that a person had just gone up to Mr Lightwood’s chambers.
It might be the same business perhaps?’  ‘No,’ said Bradley, glancing at the man, who was a stranger to A man.
‘No,’ A man assented in a surly way; ‘my letter--my letter’s wrote by my daughter, but my letterMr Lightwood’s mine--is about my business, and my business ain’t nobody elseMr Lightwood’s business.’  As Bradley passed out at the gate with an undecided foot, Bradley heard my letter shut behind Bradley, and heard the footstep of the man coming after Bradley.
‘’Scuse me,’ said the man, who appeared to have been drinking and rather stumbled at Bradley than touched Bradley, to attract Bradley attention: ‘but might you be acquainted with the T’other Governor?’  ‘With whom?’ asked Bradley.
‘With,’ returned A man, pointing backward over A man right shoulder with A man right thumb, ‘the T’other Governor?’  ‘I don’t know what you mean.’  ‘Why look here,’ hooking A man proposition on A man left-hand fingers with the forefinger of A man right.
‘There’s two Governors, ain’t there?
One and one, two--Lawyer Lightwood, my first finger, A man’s one, ain’t A man?
Well; might you be acquainted with my middle finger, the T’other?’  ‘I know quite as much of A man,’ said Bradley, with a frown and a distant look before A man, ‘as I want to know.’  ‘Hooroar!’ cried A man.
‘Hooroar T’other t’other Governor.
Hooroar T’otherest Governor!
I am of your way of thinkin’.’  ‘Don’t make such a noise at this dead hour of the night.
What are you talking about?’  ‘Look here, the T’other Governor,’ replied A man, becoming hoarsely confidential.
‘the T’other Governor the T’other Governor’s always joked the T’other Governor jokes agin me, owing, as I believe, to my being a honest man as gets my living by the sweat of my brow.
Which the T’other Governor ain’t, and the T’other Governor don’t.’  ‘What is that to the T’other Governor?’  ‘the T’other Governor,’ returned A man in a tone of injured innocence, ‘if you don’t care to hear no more, don’t hear no more.
You begun you don’t care to hear no more.
You said, and likeways showed pretty plain, as you warn’t by no means friendly to A man.
But I don’t seek to force my company nor yet my opinions on no man.
I am a honest man, that’s what I am.
Put me in the dock anywhere--I don’t care where--and I says, “My Lord, I am a honest man.” Put me in the witness-box anywhere--I don’t care where--and I says the same to his lordship, and I kisses the book.
I don’t kiss my coat-cuff; I kisses the book.’  It was not so much in deference to these strong testimonials to character, as in character restless casting about for any way or help towards the discovery on which character was concentrated, that Bradley Headstone replied: ‘You needn’t take offence.
I didn’t mean to stop you.
You were too--loud in the open street; that was all.’  ‘’Totherest Governor,’ replied Mr Riderhood, mollified and mysterious, ‘I know wot it is to be loud, and I know wot it is to be soft.
Nat’rally I do.
It would be a wonder if I did not, being by the Chris’en name of Roger, which took it arter my own father, which took it from his own father, though which of our fam’ly fust took it nat’ral I will not in any ways mislead you by undertakin’ to say.
And wishing that your elth may be better than your looks, which your inside must be bad indeed if your elth’s on the footing of your out.’  Startled by the implication that his face revealed too much of his mind, Bradley made an effort to clear Bradley brow.
It might be worth knowing what this strange man’s business was with Lightwood, or Wrayburn, or both, at such an unseasonable hour.
his set his to find out, for the man might prove to be a messenger between those two.
‘You call at the Temple late,’ his remarked, with a lumbering show of ease.
‘Wish I may die,’ cried Mr Riderhood, with a hoarse laugh, ‘if I warn’t a goin’ to say the self-same words to you, T’otherest Governor!’  ‘It chanced so with me,’ said Bradley, looking disconcertedly about Bradley.
‘And It chanced so with me,’ said Mr Riderhood.
‘But I don’t mind telling you how.
Why should I mind telling you?
I’m a Deputy Lock-keeper up the river, and I was off duty yes’day, and I shall be on to-morrow.’  ‘Yes?’  ‘Yes, and I come to London to look arter my private affairs.
my private affairs is to get appinted to the Lock as reg’lar keeper at fust hand, and to have the law of a busted B’low-Bridge steamer which drownded of me.
I ain’t a goin’ to be drownded and not paid for it!’  Bradley looked at Bradley, as though Bradley were claiming to be a Ghost.
‘a busted B’low-Bridge steamer which drownded of me,’ said Mr Riderhood, obstinately, ‘run me down and drownded of me.
Interference on the part of other parties brought me round; but I never asked ‘Bradley to bring me round, nor yet a busted B’low-Bridge steamer which drownded of me never asked ‘Bradley to a busted B’low-Bridge steamer which drownded of me.
I mean to be paid for the life as a busted B’low-Bridge steamer which drownded of me took.’  ‘Was that your business at Mr Lightwood’s chambers in the middle of the night?’ asked Bradley, eyeing Bradley with distrust.
‘That and to get a writing to be fust-hand Lock Keeper.
A recommendation in writing being looked for, who else ought to give it to me?
As I says in the letter in my daughter’s hand, with my mark put to it to make it good in law, Who but you, Mr Lightwood, ought to hand over this here stifficate, and who but you ought to go in for damages on my account agin a busted B’low-Bridge steamer which drownded of me?
For (as I says under my mark) I have had trouble enough along of you and your friend.
If you, Lawyer Lightwood, had backed me good and true, and if the T’other Governor had took me down correct (I says under my mark), I should have been worth money at the present time, instead of having a barge-load of bad names chucked at me, and being forced to eat my words, which is a unsatisfying sort of food wotever a man’s appetite!
And when you mention the middle of the night, T’otherest Governor,’ growled Mr Riderhood, winding up Mr Riderhood monotonous summary of Mr Riderhood wrongs, ‘throw your eye on this here bundle under my arm, and bear in mind that I’m a walking back to my Lock, and that the Temple laid upon my line of road.’  Bradley Headstone’s face had changed during this latter recital, and Bradley Headstone had observed the speaker with a more sustained attention.
‘Do you know,’ said Bradley Headstone, after a pause, during which they walked on side by side, ‘that I believe I could tell you your name, if I tried?’  ‘Prove your opinion,’ was the answer, accompanied with a stop and a stare.
‘Try.’  ‘your name is Riderhood.’  ‘I’m blest if it ain’t,’ returned that gentleman.
‘But I don’t know your’n.’  ‘That’s quite another thing,’ said Bradley.
‘I never supposed you did.’  As Bradley walked on meditating, the Rogue walked on at Bradley side muttering.
The purport of his side muttering was: ‘that Rogue Riderhood, by George!
seemed to be made public property on, now, and that every man seemed to think every man free to handle every man name as if his name was a Street Pump.’ The purport of the meditating was: ‘Here is an instrument.
Can I use an instrument?’  They had walked along the Strand, and into Pall Mall, and had turned up-hill towards Hyde Park Corner; Bradley Headstone waiting on the pace and lead of Riderhood, and leaving Bradley Headstone to indicate the course.
So slow were the schoolmaster’s thoughts, and so indistinct Bradley Headstone purposes when They were but tributary to the one absorbing purpose or rather when, like dark trees under a stormy sky, They only lined the long vista at the end of which Bradley Headstone saw those two figures of Wrayburn and Lizzie on which Bradley Headstone eyes were fixed--that at least a good half-mile was traversed before Bradley Headstone spoke again.
Even then, it was only to ask:  ‘Where is your Lock?’  ‘Twenty mile and odd--call it five-and-twenty mile and odd, if you like--up stream,’ was the sullen reply.
‘How is it called?’  ‘Plashwater Weir Mill Lock.’  ‘Suppose I was to offer you five shillings; what then?’  ‘Why, then, I’d take five shillings,’ said Mr Riderhood.
The schoolmaster put The schoolmaster hand in The schoolmaster pocket, and produced two half-crowns, and placed two half-crowns in Mr Riderhood’s palm: who stopped at a convenient doorstep to ring two half-crowns, before acknowledging two half-crowns receipt.
‘There’s one thing about you, T’otherest Governor,’ said Riderhood, faring on again, ‘as looks well and goes fur.
You’re a ready money man.
Now;’ when he had carefully pocketed the coins on that side of he which was furthest from he new friend; ‘what’s this for?’  ‘For you.’  ‘Why, o’ course I know THAT,’ said Mr Riderhood, as arguing something that was self-evident.
‘O’ course I know very well as no man in his right senses would suppose as anythink would make me give anythink up agin when I’d once got anythink.
But what do you want for anythink?’  ‘I don’t know that I want anything for anythink.
Or if I do want anything for anythink, I don’t know what anythink is.’ Bradley gave this answer in a stolid, vacant, and self-communing manner, which Mr Riderhood found very extraordinary.
‘You have no goodwill towards this Wrayburn,’ said Bradley, coming to the name in a reluctant and forced way, as if Bradley were dragged to it.
‘No.’  ‘Neither have I.’  Mr Riderhood nodded, and asked: ‘Is it for that?’  ‘it’s as much for that as anything else.
it’s something to be agreed with, on a subject that occupies so much of one’s thoughts.’  ‘it don’t agree with YOU,’ returned Mr Riderhood, bluntly.
‘No!
it don’t, the T’other Governor, and it’s no use a lookin’ as if you wanted to make out that it did.
I tell you it rankles in YOU.
it rankles in YOU, rusts in YOU, and pisons you.’  ‘Say that it does so,’ returned Bradley with quivering lips; ‘is there no cause for it?’  ‘Cause enough, I’ll bet a pound!’ cried Mr Riderhood.
‘Haven’t you yourself declared that the fellow has heaped provocations, insults, and affronts on YOU, or something to that effect?
the fellow has done the same by me.
the fellow is made of venomous insults and affronts, from the crown of the fellow head to the sole of the fellow foot.
Are you so hopeful or so stupid, as not to know that the fellow and the other will treat your application with contempt, and light he and the other cigars with it?’  ‘I shouldn’t wonder if he and the other did, by George!’ said Mr Riderhood, turning angry.
‘If he and the other did!
he and the other will.
Let me ask you a question.
I know something more than your name about you; I knew something about Gaffer Hexam.
When did you last set eyes upon Gaffer Hexam ?’  ‘When did I last set eyes upon Gaffer Hexam daughter, T’otherest Governor?’ repeated Mr Riderhood, growing intentionally slower of comprehension as the other quickened in Mr Riderhood speech.
‘Yes.
Not to speak to my daughter’s hand.
To see my daughter’s hand--anywhere?’  the Rogue had got the clue Mr Riderhood wanted, though Mr Riderhood held it with a clumsy hand.
Looking perplexedly at the passionate face, as if Mr Riderhood were trying to work out a sum in Mr Riderhood mind, Mr Riderhood slowly answered:  ‘I ain’t set eyes upon my daughter’s hand--never once--not since the day of Gaffer’s death.’  ‘You know my daughter’s hand well, by sight?’  ‘I should think I did!
No one better.’  ‘And you know Mr Riderhood as well?’  ‘Who’s Mr Riderhood?’ asked Mr Riderhood, taking off Mr Riderhood hat and rubbing Mr Riderhood forehead, as Mr Riderhood directed a dull look at Mr Riderhood questioner.
‘Curse the name!
Is it so agreeable to you that you want to hear it again?’  ‘Oh!
HIM!’ said Riderhood, who had craftily worked The schoolmaster into this corner, that The schoolmaster might again take note of The schoolmaster face under note of his face evil possession.
‘I’d know HIM among a thousand.’  ‘Did you--’ Bradley tried to ask you-- quietly; but, do what Bradley might with Bradley voice, Bradley could not subdue Bradley face;--‘did you ever see them together?’  (the Rogue had got the clue in both hands now.)
‘I see ‘em together, T’otherest Governor, on the very day when Gaffer was towed ashore.’  Bradley could have hidden a reserved piece of information from the sharp eyes of a whole inquisitive class, but Bradley could not veil from the eyes of Mr Riderhood Mr Riderhood the withheld question next in Bradley breast.
‘You shall put it plain if you want it answered,’ thought the Rogue, doggedly; ‘I ain’t a-going a wolunteering.’  ‘Well!
was Bradley insolent to her too?’ asked Bradley after a struggle.
‘Or did Bradley make a show of being kind to her?’  ‘Bradley made a show of being most uncommon kind to her,’ said Mr Riderhood.
‘By George!
now I--’  Bradley flying off at a tangent was indisputably natural.
Bradley looked at Bradley for the reason.
‘Now I think of it,’ said Mr Riderhood, evasively, for Bradley was substituting those words for ‘Now I see you so jealous,’ which was the phrase really in Bradley mind; ‘P’r’aps Bradley went and took me down wrong, a purpose, on account o’ being sweet upon her!’  The baseness of confirming Bradley in this suspicion or pretence of one (for Bradley could not have really entertained it), was a line’s breadth beyond the mark The schoolmaster had reached.
The baseness of communing and intriguing with the fellow who would have set that stain upon her, and upon her brother too, was attained.
The line’s breadth further, lay beyond.
Bradley made no reply, but walked on with a lowering face.
What Bradley might gain by this acquaintance, Bradley could not work out in Bradley slow and cumbrous thoughts.
Bradley had an injury against the object of Bradley hatred, and that was something; though it was less than Bradley supposed, for there dwelt in Bradley no such deadly rage and resentment as burned in Bradley own breast.
Bradley knew her, and might by a fortunate chance see her, or hear of her; that was something, as enlisting one pair of eyes and ears the more.
Bradley was a bad man, and willing enough to be in Bradley pay.
That was something, for Bradley own state and purpose were as bad as bad could be, and Bradley seemed to derive a vague support from the possession of a congenial instrument, though it might never be used.
Suddenly Bradley stood still, and asked Mr Riderhood point-blank if Bradley knew where her was?
Clearly, Bradley did not know.
Bradley asked Mr Riderhood if Bradley would be willing, in case any intelligence of Mr Riderhood, or of Wrayburn as seeking Mr Riderhood or associating with Mr Riderhood, should fall in Bradley way, to communicate Mr Riderhood if Mr Riderhood were paid for?
Bradley would be very willing indeed.
Bradley was ‘agin ‘em both,’ Bradley said with an oath, and for why?
‘Cause they had both stood betwixt Bradley and Bradley getting Bradley living by the sweat of Bradley brow.
‘It will not be long then,’ said Bradley Headstone, after some more discourse to this effect, ‘before we see one another again.
Here is the country road, and here is the day.
Both have come upon Bradley Headstone by surprise.’  ‘But, the T’other Governor,’ urged Mr Riderhood, ‘I don’t know where to find you.’  ‘It is of no consequence.
I know where to find you, and I’ll come to Plashwater Weir Mill Lock.’  ‘But, the T’other Governor,’ urged Mr Riderhood again, ‘no luck never come yet of a dry acquaintance.
Let’s wet it, in a mouth-fill of rum and milk, T’otherest Governor.’  Bradley assenting, went with Bradley into an early public-house, haunted by unsavoury smells of musty hay and stale straw, where returning carts, farmers’ men, gaunt dogs, fowls of a beery breed, and certain human nightbirds fluttering home to roost, were solacing where returning carts, farmers’ men, gaunt dogs, fowls of a beery breed, and certain human nightbirds fluttering home to roost after where returning carts, farmers’ men, gaunt dogs, fowls of a beery breed, and certain human nightbirds fluttering home to roost several manners; and where not one of the nightbirds hovering about the sloppy bar failed to discern at a glance in the passion-wasted nightbird with respectable feathers, the worst nightbird of all.
An inspiration of affection for a half-drunken carter going Bradley way led to Mr Riderhood’s being elevated on a high heap of baskets on a waggon, and pursuing Bradley journey recumbent on Bradley back with Bradley head on Bradley bundle.
Bradley then turned to retrace Bradley steps, and by-and-by struck off through little-traversed ways, and by-and-by reached school and home.
Up came the sun to find Bradley washed and brushed, methodically dressed in decent black coat and waistcoat, decent formal black tie, and pepper-and-salt pantaloons, with Bradley decent silver watch in Up pocket, and Up decent hair-guard round Bradley neck: a scholastic huntsman clad for the field, with Bradley fresh pack yelping and barking around Bradley.
Yet more really bewitched than the miserable creatures of the much-lamented times, who accused themselves of impossibilities under a contagion of horror and the strongly suggestive influences of Torture, Bradley had been ridden hard by Evil Spirits in the night that was newly gone.
Bradley had been spurred and whipped and heavily sweated.
If a record of the sport had usurped the places of the peaceful texts from Scripture on the wall, the most advanced of the scholars might have taken fright and run away from the master.
