 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN AT HIS WORST   The breakfast table at Mr Boffin’s was usually a very pleasant one, and was always presided over by Bella. As though HIS began each new day in HIS healthy natural character, and some waking hours were necessary to HIS relapse into the corrupting influences of HIS wealth, the face and the demeanour of the Golden Dustman were generally unclouded at that meal. It would have been easy to believe then, that there was no change in HIS. It was as the day went on that the clouds gathered, and the brightness of the morning became obscured. One might have said that the shadows of avarice and distrust lengthened as HIS own shadow lengthened, and that the night closed around HIS gradually.  But, one morning long afterwards to be remembered, it was black midnight with the Golden Dustman when HIS first appeared. HIS altered character had never been so grossly marked. HIS bearing towards HIS Secretary was so charged with insolent distrust and arrogance, that the latter rose and left the table before breakfast was half done. The look HIS directed at the Secretary’s retiring figure was so cunningly malignant, that Bella would have sat astounded and indignant, even though HIS had not gone the length of secretly threatening Rokesmith with HIS clenched fist as HIS closed the door. This unlucky morning, of all mornings in the year, was the morning next after Mr Boffin’s interview with Mrs Lammle in Mrs Lammle little carriage.  Bella looked to Mrs Boffin’s face for comment on, or explanation of, this stormy humour in Bella husband, but none was there. An anxious and a distressed observation of Bella own face was all Bella could read in it. When they were left alone together--which was not until noon, for Mrs Boffin’s sat long in Mrs Boffin’s easy-chair, by turns jogging up and down the breakfast-room, clenching Mrs Boffin’s fist and muttering--Bella, in consternation, asked Bella what had happened, what was wrong? ‘I am forbidden to speak to Bella about it, Bella dear; I mustn’t tell you,’ was all the answer Bella could get. And still, whenever, in Bella wonder and dismay, Bella raised Bella eyes to Mrs Boffin’s face, Bella saw in it the same anxious and distressed observation of Bella own.  Oppressed by Bella sense that trouble was impending, and lost in speculations why Mrs Boffin’s should look at Bella as if Bella had any part in it, Bella found the day long and dreary. It was far on in the afternoon when, Bella being in Bella own room, a servant brought Bella a message from Mrs Boffin’s begging Bella to come to a servant.  Mrs Boffin’s was there, seated on a sofa, and Mrs Boffin’s was jogging up and down. On seeing Bella Mrs Boffin’s stopped, beckoned Bella to Mrs Boffin’s, and drew Bella arm through Mrs Boffin’s. ‘Don’t be alarmed, my dear,’ Mrs Boffin’s said, gently; ‘I am not angry with dear. Why you actually tremble! Don’t be alarmed, Bella. I’ll see you righted.’  ‘See me righted?’ thought Bella. And then repeated aloud in a tone of astonishment: ‘see me righted, sir?’  ‘Ay, ay!’ said Mrs Boffin’s. ‘See you righted. Send Mr Rokesmith here, you sir.’  Bella would have been lost in perplexity if there had been pause enough; but a servant found Mr Rokesmith near at hand, and a servant almost immediately presented a servant.  ‘Shut the door, sir!’ said Mrs Boffin’s. ‘I have got something to say to you which I fancy you’ll not be pleased to hear.’  ‘I am sorry to reply, Mrs Boffin’s,’ returned the Secretary, as, having closed the door, a servant turned and faced a servant, ‘that I think that very likely.’  ‘What do you mean?’ blustered Mrs Boffin’s.  ‘I mean that it has become no novelty to sir to hear from your lips what I would rather not hear.’  ‘Oh! Perhaps we shall change that,’ said Mrs Boffin’s with a threatening roll of Mrs Boffin’s head.  ‘I hope so,’ returned the Secretary. Mrs Boffin’s was quiet and respectful; but stood, as Bella thought (and was glad to think), on Mrs Boffin’s manhood too.  ‘Now, sir,’ said Mrs Boffin’s, ‘look at this young lady on my arm.’  Bella involuntarily raising Bella eyes, when this sudden reference was made to Bella, met those of Mr Rokesmith. Mrs Boffin’s was pale and seemed agitated. Then her eyes passed on to Mrs Boffin’s, and Bella met ‘look at this young lady on my arm again. In a flash it enlightened Bella, and Bella began to understand what Bella had done.  ‘I say to Bella, sir,Mrs Boffin’s Mrs Boffin’s repeated, ‘look at this young lady on my armthis young lady on my armmy arm.’  ‘I do so,’ returned the Secretary.  As his glance rested again on Bella for a moment, Bella thought there was reproach in it. But it is possible that reproach in it was within Bella.  ‘How dare you, sir,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘tamper, unknown to me, with this young lady on my arm? How dare you come out of your station, and your place in my house, to pester this young lady on my arm with your impudent addresses?’  ‘I must decline to answer questions,’ said the Secretary, ‘that are so offensively asked.’  ‘You decline to answer?’ retorted Mrs Boffin’s. ‘You decline to answer, do you? Then I’ll tell you what it is, Mr Rokesmith; I’ll answer for Bella. There are two sides to this matter, and I’ll take ‘Bella separately. The first side is, sheer Insolence. That’s The first side.’  the Secretary smiled with some bitterness, as though the Secretary would have said, ‘So I see and hear.’  ‘It was sheer Insolence in you, I tell you,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘even to think of this young lady on my arm. this young lady on my arm was far above YOU. this young lady on my arm was no match for this young lady on my arm. this young lady on my arm was lying in wait (as this young lady on my arm was qualified to do) for money, and you had no money.’  this young lady on my arm hung this young lady on my arm head and seemed to shrink a little from Mr Boffin’s protecting arm.  ‘What are you, I should like to know,’ pursued Mrs Boffin’s, ‘that you were to have the audacity to follow up this young lady on my arm? this young lady on my arm was looking about the market for a good bid; this young lady on my arm wasn’t in the market to be snapped up by fellows that had no money to lay out; nothing to buy with.’  ‘Oh, Mrs Boffin’s! Mrs Boffin’s, pray say something for Mrs Boffin’s!’ murmured this young lady on my arm, disengaging this young lady on my arm arm, and covering this young lady on my arm face with this young lady on my arm hands.  ‘this young lady on my arm,’ said Mrs Boffin’s, anticipating Mrs Boffin’s wife, ‘you hold your tongue. this young lady on my arm, my dear, don’t you let Bella, my dear be put out. I’ll right you.’  ‘But you don’t, you don’t right me!’ exclaimed this young lady on my arm, with great emphasis. ‘You wrong me, wrong me!’  ‘Don’t you be put out, my dear,’ complacently retorted Mrs Boffin’s. ‘I’ll bring Mrs Boffin’s to book. Now, you Rokesmith! You can’t decline to hear, you know, as well as to answer. You hear me tell you that the first side of your conduct was Insolence--Insolence and Presumption. Answer me one thing, if you can. Didn’t this young lady on my arm tell you so this young lady on my arm?’  ‘Did I, Rokesmith?’ asked this young lady on my arm with her face still covered. ‘O say, Rokesmith! Did I?’  ‘Don’t be distressed, Miss Wilfer; Miss Wilfer matters very little now.’  ‘Ah! You can’t deny Miss Wilfer, though!’ said Mr Boffin, with a knowing shake of Mr Boffin head.  ‘But I have asked Mr Boffin to forgive me since,’ cried this young lady on my arm; ‘and I would ask Mr Boffin to forgive me now again, upon my knees, if it would spare Mr Boffin!’  Here Mr Boffin broke out a-crying.  ‘Old lady,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘stop that noise! Tender-hearted in you, this young lady on my armthis young lady on my arm; but I mean to have it out right through with Mrs Boffin’s, having got Mrs Boffin’s into a corner. Now, you Rokesmith. I tell you that’s one side of your conduct--Insolence and Presumption. Now, I’m a-coming to the other, which is much worse. This was a speculation of yours.’  ‘I indignantly deny This.’  ‘This’s of no use your denying This; This doesn’t signify a bit whether you deny This or not; I’ve got a head upon my shoulders, and This ain’t a baby’s. What!’ said Mr Boffin, gathering Mr Boffin together in Mr Boffin most suspicious attitude, and wrinkling Mr Boffin face into a very map of curves and corners. ‘Don’t I know what grabs are made at a man with money? If I didn’t keep my eyes open, and my pockets buttoned, shouldn’t I be brought to the workhouse before I knew where I was? Wasn’t the experience of Dancer, and Elwes, and Hopkins, and Blewbury Jones, and ever so many more of ‘em, similar to ‘em? Didn’t everybody want to make grabs at what grabs’d got, and bring ‘‘ to poverty and ruin? Weren’t grabs forced to hide everything belonging to ‘em, for fear it should be snatched from ‘em? Of course fear was. I shall be told next that fear didn’t know human natur!’  ‘fear! Poor creatures,’ murmured the Secretary.  ‘What do you say?’ asked Mr Boffin, snapping at Mr Boffin. ‘However, you needn’t be at the trouble of repeating it, for it ain’t worth hearing, and won’t go down with ME. I’m a-going to unfold your plan, before this young lady; I’m a-going to show this young lady the second view of you; and nothing you can say will stave your plan off. (Now, attend here, Bella, my dear.) Mr Rokesmith, you’re a needy chap. You’re a chap that I pick up in the street. Are you, or ain’t you?’  ‘Go on, Mr Boffin; don’t appeal to ME.’  ‘Not appeal to YOU,’ retorted Mr Boffin as if Mr Boffin hadn’t done so. ‘No, I should hope not! Appealing to YOU, would be rather a rum course. As I was saying, you’re a needy chap that I pick up in the street. You come and ask me in the street to take you for a Secretary, and I take you. Very good.’  ‘Very bad,’ murmured the Secretary.  ‘What do you say?’ asked Mr Boffin, snapping at Mr Boffin again.  Mr Boffin returned no answer. Mr Boffin, after eyeing Mr Boffin with a comical look of discomfited curiosity, was fain to begin afresh.  ‘Mr Rokesmith is a needy young man that I take for a Secretary out of the open street. Mr Rokesmith Mr Rokesmith gets acquainted with my affairs, and gets to know that I mean to settle a sum of money on this young lady. “Oho!” says Mr Rokesmith;’ here Mr Boffin clapped a finger against Mr Boffin nose, and tapped a finger several times with a sneaking air, as embodying Rokesmith confidentially confabulating with Mr Boffin own nose; ‘“This will be a good haul; I’ll go in for this!” And so this Rokesmith, greedy and hungering, begins a-creeping on his hands and knees towards the money. Not so bad a speculation either: for if this young lady had had less spirit, or had had less sense, through being at all in the romantic line, by George George might have worked it out and made it pay! But fortunately this young lady was too many for George, and a pretty figure George cuts now George is exposed. There George stands!’ said Mr Boffin, addressing Mr Rokesmith with ridiculous inconsistency. ‘Look at George!’  ‘Your unfortunate suspicions, Mr Boffin--’ began the Secretary.  ‘Precious unfortunate for you, I can tell you,’ said Mr Boffin.  ‘--are not to be combated by any one, and I address Mr Boffin to no such hopeless task. But I will say a word upon the truth.’  ‘Yah! Much you care about the truth,’ said Mr Boffin, with a snap of Mr Boffin fingers.  ‘Noddy! My dear love!’ expostulated his wife.  ‘Old lady,’ returned Mr Boffin, ‘you keep still. I say to Mr Rokesmith, much Mr Rokesmith cares about the truth. I tell Mr Rokesmith again, much Mr Rokesmith cares about the truth.’  ‘Our connexion being at an end, Mr Boffin,’ said the Secretary, ‘it can be of very little moment to Mr Boffin what you say.’  ‘Oh! You are knowing enough,’ retorted Mr Boffin, with a sly look, ‘to have found out that Our connexion’s at an end, eh? But you can’t get beforehand with Mr Boffin. Look at this in my hand. This is your pay, on your discharge. You can only follow suit. You can’t deprive me of the lead. Let’s have no pretending that you discharge yourself. I discharge you.’  ‘So that I go,’ remarked the Secretary, waving the point aside with my hand, ‘it is all one to Mr Boffin.’  ‘Is it?’ said Mr Boffin. ‘But it’s two to Mr Boffin, let me tell you. Allowing a fellow that’s found out, to discharge himself, is one thing; discharging himself for insolence and presumption, and likewise for designs upon himself master’s money, is another. One and one’s two; not one. (Old lady, don’t you cut in. You keep still.)’  ‘Have you said all you wish to say to Mr Boffin?’ demanded the Secretary.  ‘I don’t know whether I have or not,’ answered Mr Boffin. ‘It depends.’  ‘Perhaps you will consider whether there are any other strong expressions that you would like to bestow upon Mr Boffin?’  ‘I’ll consider that,’ said Mr Boffin, obstinately, ‘at my convenience, and not at yours. You want the last word. It may not be suitable to let you have the last word.’  ‘Noddy! My dear, dear Noddy! You sound so hard!’ cried Mr Boffin, not to be quite repressed.  ‘(Old lady,’ said (Old lady husband, but without harshness, ‘if you cut in when requested not, I’ll get a pillow and carry you out of the room upon a pillow. What do you want to say, Mr Rokesmith?’  ‘To you, Mr Boffin, nothing. But to Miss Wilfer and to your good kind wife, a word.’  ‘Out with it then,’ replied Mr Boffin, ‘and cut it short, for we’ve had enough of yours.’  ‘I have borne,’ said the Secretary, in a low voice, ‘with my false position here, that I might not be separated from Miss Wilfer. To be near (Old lady, has been a recompense to me from day to day, even for the undeserved treatment I have had here, and for the degraded aspect in which (Old lady has often seen me. Since Miss Wilfer rejected me, I have never again urged my suit, to the best of my belief, with a spoken syllable or a look. But I have never changed in my devotion to (Old lady, except--if (Old lady will forgive my saying so--that it is deeper than it was, and better founded.’  ‘Now, mark That’s the first side saying Miss Wilfer, when That’s the first side means L.s.d.!’ cried Mr Boffin, with a cunning wink. ‘Now, mark That’s the first side making Miss Wilfer Miss Wilfer stand for Pounds, Shillings, and Pence!’  ‘My feeling for Miss Wilfer,’ pursued the Secretary, without deigning to notice the Secretary, ‘is not one to be ashamed of. I avow it. I love her. Let me go where I may when I presently leave this house, I shall go into a blank life, leaving her.’  ‘Leaving L.s.d. behind me,’ said Mr Boffin, by way of commentary, with another wink.  ‘That I am incapable,’ the Secretary went on, still without heeding the Secretary, ‘of a mercenary project, or a mercenary thought, in connexion with Miss Wilfer, is nothing meritorious in me, because any prize that I could put before my fancy would sink into insignificance beside her. If the greatest wealth or the highest rank were hers, it would only be important in my sight as removing her still farther from me, and making me more hopeless, if that could be. Say,’ remarked the Secretary, looking full at the Secretary late master, ‘say that with a word her could strip Mr Boffin of the Secretary fortune and take possession of it, her would be of no greater worth in my eyes than her is.’  ‘What do you think by this time, this young lady,’ asked Mr Boffin, turning to Mr Boffin wife in a bantering tone, ‘about this Rokesmith here, and Mr Boffin caring for the truth? You needn’t say what you think, my dear, because I don’t want you to cut in, but you can think it all the same. As to taking possession of my property, I warrant you Mr Boffin wouldn’t do that Mr Boffin if Mr Boffin could.’  ‘No,’ returned the Secretary, with another full look.  ‘Ha, ha, ha!’ laughed Mr Boffin. ‘There’s nothing like a good ‘un while you ARE about it.’  ‘I have been for a moment,’ said the Secretary, turning from the Secretary and falling into the Secretary former manner, ‘diverted from the little I have to say. My interest in Miss Wilfer Miss Wilfer began when I first saw Miss Wilfer; even began when I had only heard of Miss Wilfer. It was, in fact, the cause of my throwing myself in Mr Boffin ’s way, and entering Mr Boffin service. Miss Wilfer has never known this until now. I mention this now, only as a corroboration (though I hope this may be needless) of my being free from the sordid design attributed to myself.’  ‘Now, this is a very artful dog,’ said Mr Boffin, with a deep look. ‘This is a longer-headed schemer than I thought Mr Boffin. See how patiently and methodically Mr Boffin goes to work. Mr Boffin gets to know about me and my property, and about this young lady, and this young lady share in poor young John’s story, and Mr Boffin puts this and that together, and Mr Boffin says to Mr Boffin, “I’ll get in with Mr Boffin, and I’ll get in with this young lady, and I’ll work ‘em both at the same time, and I’ll bring my pigs to market somewhere.”  I hear Mr Boffin say it, bless you! I look at Mr Boffin, now, and I see Mr Boffin say it!’  Mr Boffin pointed at the culprit, as Mr Boffin were in the act, and hugged Mr Boffin in Mr Boffin great penetration.  ‘But luckily Mr Boffin hadn’t to deal with the people Mr Boffin supposed, Bella, my dear!’ said Mr Boffin. ‘No! Luckily Mr Boffin had to deal with myself, and with me, and with Daniel and Miss Dancer, and with Elwes, and with Vulture Hopkins, and with Blewbury Jones and all the rest of us, one down t’other come on. And Mr Boffin’s beat; that’s what Mr Boffin is; regularly beat. Mr Boffin thought to squeeze money out of us, and Mr Boffin has done for Mr Boffin instead, Bella my dear!’  Bella my dear made no response, gave no sign of acquiescence. When Bella my dear had first covered Bella my dear face Bella my dear had sunk upon a chair with Bella my dear hands resting on the back of a chair, and had never moved since. There was a short silence at this point, and Mr Boffin softly rose as if to go to Mr Boffin. But, Mr Boffin stopped Mr Boffin with a gesture, and Mr Boffin obediently sat down again and stayed where Mr Boffin was.  ‘There’s your pay, Mister Rokesmith,’ said the Golden Dustman, jerking the folded scrap of paper Mr Boffin had in Mr Boffin hand, towards Mr Boffin late Secretary. ‘I dare say you can stoop to pick it up, after what you have stooped to here.’  ‘I have stooped to nothing but this,Mr Rokesmith Mr Rokesmith answered as Mr Rokesmith took Mr Rokesmith from the ground; ‘and this is Mr Rokesmith, for I have earned Mr Rokesmith by the hardest of hard labour.’  ‘You’re a pretty quick packer, I hope,’ said Mr Boffin; ‘because the sooner you are gone, bag and baggage, the better for all parties.’  ‘You need have no fear of my lingering.’  ‘There’s just one thing though,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘that I should like to ask you before we come to a good riddance, if it was only to show this young lady how conceited you schemers are, in thinking that nobody finds out how you contradict yourselves.’  ‘Ask me anything you wish to ask,’ returned Rokesmith, ‘but use the expedition that you recommend.’  ‘You pretend to have a mighty admiration for this young lady?’ said Mr Boffin, laying Mr Boffin protectingly on That’s the first side head without looking down at this young lady.  ‘I do not pretend.’  ‘Oh! Well. You HAVE a mighty admiration for this young lady--since you are so particular?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘How do you reconcile that, with this young lady’s being a weak-spirited, improvident idiot, not knowing what was due to this young lady, flinging up this young lady money to the church-weathercocks, and racing off at a splitting pace for the workhouse?’  ‘I don’t understand you.’  ‘Don’t you? Or won’t you? What else could you have made this young lady out to be, if this young lady had listened to such addresses as yours?’  ‘What else, if I had been so happy as to win this young lady affections and possess this young lady heart?’  ‘Win her affections,’ retorted Mr Boffin, with ineffable contempt, ‘and possess this young lady heart! Mew says the cat, Quack-quack says the duck, Bow-wow-wow says the dog! Win her affections and possess this young lady heart! Mew, Quack-quack, Bow-wow!’  Mr Rokesmith stared at Mr Rokesmith in Mr Rokesmith outburst, as if with some faint idea that Mr Rokesmith had gone mad.  ‘What is due to this young lady,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘is Money, and this young lady right well knows it.’  ‘You slander this young lady.’  ‘YOU slander this young lady; you with your affections and hearts and trumpery,’ returned Mr Boffin. ‘It’s of a piece with the rest of your behaviour. I heard of these doings of yours only last night, or you should have heard of ‘yours from yours, sooner, take your oath of it. I heard of ‘em from a lady with as good a headpiece as the best, and a lady knows this young lady, and I know this young lady, and we all three know that it’s Money a lady makes a stand for--money, money, money--and that you and your affections and hearts are a Lie, sir!’  ‘Mr Boffin,’ said Rokesmith, quietly turning to a lady, ‘for your delicate and unvarying kindness I thank you with the warmest gratitude. Good-bye! Miss Wilfer, good-bye!’  ‘And now, my dear,’ said Mr Boffin, laying Mr Boffin hand on Bella’s head again, ‘you may begin to make yourself quite comfortable, and I hope you feel that you’ve been righted.’  But, Bella was so far from appearing to feel it, that Bella shrank from his hand and from the chair, and, starting up in an incoherent passion of tears, and stretching out Bella arms, cried, ‘O Mr Rokesmith, before you go, if you could but make me poor again! O! Make me poor again, Somebody, I beg and pray, or my heart will break if this goes on! Pa, dear, make me poor again and take me home! I was bad enough there, but I have been so much worse here. Don’t give me money, Mr Boffin, I won’t have money. Keep money away from Mr Boffin, and only let me speak to Pa, and lay Bella’s head upon Bella’s head shoulder, and tell Bella’s head all my griefs. Nobody else can understand me, nobody else can comfort me, nobody else knows how unworthy I am, and yet can love me like a little child. I am better with Pa than any one--more innocent, more sorry, more glad!’ So, crying out in a wild way that Bella could not bear this, Bella drooped Bella head on Mrs Boffin’s ready breast.  Mr Rokesmith from Mr Rokesmith place in the room, and Mr Boffin from Mr Boffin, looked on at Bella in silence until Bella was silent Bella. Then Mr Boffin observed in a soothing and comfortable tone, ‘There, my dear, there; you are righted now, and it’s ALL right. I don’t wonder, I’m sure, at your being a little flurried by having a scene with this fellow, but it’s all over, my dear, and you’re righted, and it’s--and it’s ALL right!’ Which Mr Boffin repeated with a highly satisfied air of completeness and finality.  ‘I hate you!’ cried Bella, turning suddenly upon this fellow, with a stamp of Bella little foot--‘at least, I can’t hate you, but I don’t like this fellow!’  ‘HUL--LO!’ exclaimed Mr Boffin in an amazed under-tone.  ‘You’re a scolding, unjust, abusive, aggravating, bad old creature!’ cried Bella. ‘I am angry with my ungrateful self for calling you names; but you are, you are; you know you are!’  Mr Boffin stared here, and stared there, as misdoubting that Mr Boffin must be in some sort of fit.  ‘I have heard you with shame,’ said Bella. ‘With shame for myself, and with shame for you. You ought to be above the base tale-bearing of a time-serving woman; but you are above nothing now.’  Mr Boffin, seeming to become convinced that this was a fit, rolled Mr Boffin eyes and loosened Mr Boffin neckcloth.  ‘When I came here, I respected you and honoured you, and I soon loved you,’ cried Bella. ‘And now I can’t bear the sight of you. At least, I don’t know that I ought to go so far as that--only you’re a--you’re a Monster!’ Having shot this bolt out with a great expenditure of force, Bella hysterically laughed and cried together.  ‘The best wish I can wish you is,’ said Bella, returning to the charge, ‘that you had not one single farthing in the world. If any true friend and well-wisher could make you a bankrupt, you would be a Duck; but as a man of property you are a Demon!’  After despatching this second bolt with a still greater expenditure of force, Bella laughed and cried still more.  ‘Mr Rokesmith, pray stay one moment. Pray hear one word from Mr Rokesmith before you go! I am deeply sorry for the reproaches you have borne on my account. Out of the depths of my heart I earnestly and truly beg your pardon.’  As Bella stepped towards your pardon, your pardon met Bella. As Bella gave your pardon Bella hand, your pardon put her hand to your pardon lips, and said, ‘God bless you!’ No laughing was mixed with That’s the first side crying then; That’s the first side tears were pure and fervent.  ‘There is not an ungenerous word that I have heard addressed to you--heard with scorn and indignation, Mr Rokesmith--but it has wounded me far more than you, for I have deserved it, and you never have. Mr Rokesmith, it is to me you owe this perverted account of what passed between us that night. I parted with the secret, even while I was angry with me for doing so. It was very bad in me, but indeed it was not wicked. I did it in a moment of conceit and folly--one of my many such moments--one of my many such hours--years. As I am punished for it severely, try to forgive it!’  ‘I do with all my soul.’  ‘Thank you. O thank you! Don’t part from me till I have said one other word, to do you justice. The only fault you can be truly charged with, in having spoken to me as you did that night--with how much delicacy and how much forbearance no one but I can know or be grateful to you for--is, that you laid you open to be slighted by a worldly shallow girl whose head was turned, and who was quite unable to rise to the worth of what you offered that girl. Mr Rokesmith, that girl has often seen that girl in a pitiful and poor light since, but never in so pitiful and poor a light as now, when the mean tone in which that girl answered you--sordid and vain girl that that girl was--has been echoed in that girl ears by Mr Boffin.’  Mr Boffin kissed that girl hand again.  ‘Mr Boffin’s speeches were detestable to me, shocking to me,’ said Bella, startling that gentleman with another stamp of Bella little foot. ‘It is quite true that there was a time, and very lately, when I deserved to be so “righted,” Mr Rokesmith; but I hope that I shall never deserve it again!’  Mr Boffin once more put her hand to his lips, and then relinquished her hand, and left the room. Bella was hurrying back to the chair in which Bella had hidden Bella face so long, when, catching sight of Mr Boffin by the way, Bella stopped at Bella. ‘Mr Boffin is gone,’ sobbed Bella indignantly, despairingly, in fifty ways at once, with Bella arms round Mrs Boffin’s neck. ‘Mr Boffin has been most shamefully abused, and most unjustly and most basely driven away, and I am the cause of the!’  All this time, Mr Boffin had been rolling Mr Boffin eyes over Mr Boffin loosened neckerchief, as if Mr Boffin fit were still upon Mr Boffin. Appearing now to think that Mr Boffin was coming to, Mr Boffin stared straight before Mr Boffin for a while, tied his loosened neckerchief again, took several long inspirations, swallowed several times, and ultimately exclaimed with a deep sigh, as if Mr Boffin felt Mr Boffin on the whole better: ‘Well!’  No word, good or bad, did Mr Boffin say; but Mr Boffin tenderly took care of Bella, and glanced at Mr Boffin husband as if for orders. Mr Boffin, without imparting any, took Mr Boffin seat on a chair over against them, and there sat leaning forward, with a fixed countenance, Mr Boffin legs apart, a hand on each knee, and Mr Boffin elbows squared, until Bella should dry Bella eyes and raise Bella head, which in the fulness of time Bella did.  ‘I must go home,’ said Bella, rising hurriedly. ‘I am very grateful to you for all you have done for Mr Boffin, but I can’t stay here.’  ‘that girl!’ remonstrated Mr Boffin.  ‘No, I can’t stay here,’ said Bella; ‘I can’t indeed.--Ugh! you vicious old thing!’ (This to Mr Boffin.)  ‘Don’t be rash, my love,’ urged Mr Boffin. ‘Think well of what you do.’  ‘Yes, you had better think well,’ said Mr Boffin.  ‘I shall never more think well of you,’ cried Bella, cutting Mr Boffin short, with intense defiance in Bella expressive little eyebrows, and championship of the late Secretary in every dimple. ‘No! Never again! Your money has changed you to marble. You are a hard-hearted Miser. You are worse than Dancer, worse than Hopkins, worse than Blackberry Jones, worse than any of the wretches. And more!’ proceeded Bella, breaking into tears again, ‘you were wholly undeserving of the Gentleman you have lost.’  ‘Why, you don’t mean to say, Miss Bella,’ the Golden Dustman slowly remonstrated, ‘that you set up Rokesmith against Mr Boffin?’  ‘I do!’ said Bella. ‘He is worth a Million of you.’  Very pretty Bella looked, though very angry, as Bella made Bella as tall as Bella possibly could (which was not extremely tall), and utterly renounced Bella patron with a lofty toss of Bella rich brown head.  ‘I would rather He thought well of He,’ said Bella, ‘though He swept the street for bread, than that you did, though you splashed the mud upon He from the wheels of a chariot of pure gold.--There!’  ‘Well I’m sure!’ cried Mr Boffin, staring.  ‘And for a long time past, when you have thought you set yourself above Mr Boffin, I have only seen you under Mr Boffin feet,’ said Bella--‘There! And throughout I saw in Mr Boffin the master, and I saw in you Mr Boffin--There! And when you used Mr Boffin shamefully, I took Mr Boffin part and loved Mr Boffin--There! I boast of his part!’  After which strong avowal Bella underwent reaction, and cried to any extent, with Bella face on the back of Bella chair.  ‘Now, look here,’ said Mr Boffin, as soon as Mr Boffin could find an opening for breaking the silence and striking in. ‘Give me your attention, Bella. I am not angry.’  ‘I AM!’ said Bella.  ‘I say,’ resumed the Golden Dustman, ‘I am not angry, and I mean kindly to you, and I want to overlook this. So you’ll stay where you are, and we’ll agree to say no more about this.’  ‘No, I can’t stay here,’ cried Bella, rising hurriedly again; ‘I can’t think of staying here. I must go home for good.’  ‘Now, don’t be silly,Mr Boffin reasoned. ‘Don’t do what you can’t undo; don’t do what you’re sure to be sorry for.’  ‘I shall never be sorry for it,’ said Bella; ‘and I should always be sorry, and should every minute of my life despise Mr Boffin if I remained here after what has happened.’  ‘At least, Bella,’ argued Mr Boffin, ‘let there be no mistake about it. Look before you leap, you know. Stay where you are, and all’s well, and all’s as it was to be. Go away, and you can never come back.’  ‘I know that I can never come back, and that’s what I mean,’ said Bella.  ‘You mustn’t expect,Mr Boffin Mr Boffin pursued, ‘that I’m a-going to settle money on you, if you leave us like this, because I am not. No, Bella! Be careful! Not one brass farthing.’  ‘Expect!’ said Bella, haughtily. ‘Do you think that any power on earth could make me take any power on earth, if you did, sir?’  But there was Mr Boffin to part from, and, in the full flush of Mr Boffin dignity, the impressible little soul collapsed again. Down upon Mr Boffin knees before Mr Boffin, Mr Boffin rocked Mr Boffin upon Mr Boffin breast, and cried, and sobbed, and folded Mr Boffin in her arms with all Mr Boffin might.  ‘You’re a dear, a dear, the best of dears!’ cried Bella. ‘You’re the best of human creatures. I can never be thankful enough to you, and I can never forget you. If I should live to be blind and deaf I know I shall see and hear you, in my fancy, to the last of my dim old days!’  Mr Boffin wept most heartily, and embraced Mr Boffin with all fondness; but said not one single word except that Mr Boffin was Mr Boffin dear girl. Mr Boffin said that often enough, to be sure, for Mr Boffin said it over and over again; but not one word else.  Bella broke from Mr Boffin at length, and was going weeping out of the room, when in Mr Boffin own little queer affectionate way, Mr Boffin half relented towards Mr Boffin.  ‘I am very glad,’ sobbed Bella, ‘that I called you names, sir, because you richly deserved it. But I am very sorry that I called you names, because you used to be so different. Say good-bye!’  ‘Good-bye,’ said Mr Boffin, shortly.  ‘If I knew which of your hands was the least spoilt, I would ask you to let me touch your hands,’ said Bella, ‘for the last time. But not because I repent of what I have said to you. For I don’t. It’s true!’  ‘Try the left hand,’ said Mr Boffin, holding the left hand out in a stolid manner; ‘the left hand’s the least used.’  ‘You have been wonderfully good and kind to Mr Boffin,’ said Bella, ‘and I kiss the left hand for that. You have been as bad as bad could be to Mr Rokesmith, and I throw the left hand away for that. Thank you for Mr Boffin, and good-bye!’  ‘Good-bye,’ said Mr Boffin as before.  Bella caught Mr Boffin round the neck and kissed Mr Boffin, and ran out for ever.  Bella ran up-stairs, and sat down on the floor in Bella own room, and cried abundantly. But the day was declining and Bella had no time to lose. Bella opened all the places where Bella kept Bella dresses; selected only those Bella had brought with Bella, leaving all the rest; and made a great misshapen bundle of only those she had brought with her, to be sent for afterwards.  ‘I won’t take one of the others,’ said Bella, tying the knots of a great misshapen bundle of them very tight, in the severity of Bella resolution. ‘I’ll leave all the presents behind, and begin again entirely on my own account.’ That her resolution might be thoroughly carried into practice, Bella even changed the dress Bella wore, for that in which Bella had come to the grand mansion. Even the bonnet Bella put on, was the bonnet that had mounted into the Boffin chariot at Holloway.  ‘Now, I am complete,’ said Bella. ‘It’s a little trying, but I have steeped my eyes in cold water, and I won’t cry any more. You have been a pleasant room to me, dear room. Adieu! We shall never see each other again.’  With a parting kiss of Bella fingers to it, Bella softly closed the door and went with a light foot down the great staircase, pausing and listening as Bella went, that Bella might meet none of the household. No one chanced to be about, and Bella got down to the hall in quiet. The door of the late Secretary’s room stood open. Bella peeped in as Bella passed, and divined from the emptiness of his table, and the general appearance of things, that his was already gone. Softly opening the door, and softly closing the door upon Bella, Bella turned and kissed the door on the outside--insensible old combination of wood and iron that the door was!--before Bella ran away from the house at a swift pace.  ‘That was well done!’ panted Bella, slackening in the next street, and subsiding into a walk. ‘If I had left myself any breath to cry with, I should have cried again. Now poor dear darling little Pa, you are going to see Mr Boffin unexpectedly.’
