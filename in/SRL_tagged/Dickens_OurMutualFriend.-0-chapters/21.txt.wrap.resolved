 CUPID PROMPTED   To use the cold language of the world, Mrs Alfred Lammle rapidly improved the acquaintance of Miss Podsnap. To use the warm language of Mrs Lammle, Mrs Lammle and Mrs Lammle sweet Georgiana soon became one: in heart, in mind, in sentiment, in soul.  Whenever Georgiana could escape from the thraldom of Podsnappery; could throw off the bedclothes of the custard-coloured phaeton, and get up; could shrink out of the range of Georgiana mother’s rocking, and (so to speak) rescue Georgiana poor little frosty toes from being rocked over; Georgiana repaired to Georgiana friend, Mrs Alfred Lammle. Miss Podsnap by no means objected. As a consciously ‘splendid woman,’ accustomed to overhear Georgiana so denominated by elderly osteologists pursuing their studies in dinner society, Miss Podsnap could dispense with Georgiana daughter. Miss Podsnap, for Miss Podsnap part, on being informed where Georgiana was, swelled with patronage of the Lammles. That they, when unable to lay hold of Miss Podsnap, should respectfully grasp at the hem of Miss Podsnap mantle; that they, when they could not bask in the glory of Miss Podsnap the sun, should take up with the pale reflected light of the watery young moon her daughter; appeared quite natural, becoming, and proper. It gave Miss Podsnap a better opinion of the discretion of the Lammles than Miss Podsnap had heretofore held, as showing that they appreciated the value of the connexion. So, Georgiana repairing to Georgiana friend, Miss Podsnap went out to dinner, and to dinner, and yet to dinner, arm in arm with Mrs Podsnap: settling Miss Podsnap obstinate head in Miss Podsnap cravat and shirt-collar, much as if Miss Podsnap were performing on the Pandean pipes, in Miss Podsnap own honour, the triumphal march, See Mrs Podsnap comes, Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!  It was a trait in Miss Podsnap’s character (and in one form or other it will be generally seen to pervade the depths and shallows of Podsnappery), that Miss Podsnap could not endure a hint of disparagement of any friend or acquaintance of Miss Podsnap. ‘How dare you?’ Miss Podsnap would seem to say, in such a case. ‘What do you mean? I have licensed this person. this person has taken out MY certificate. Through this person you strike at me, Podsnap the Great. And it is not that I particularly care for the person’s dignity, but that I do most particularly care for Podsnap’s.’ Hence, if any one in his presence had presumed to doubt the responsibility of the Lammles, his would have been mightily huffed. Not that any one did, for Veneering, M.P., was always the authority for their being very rich, and perhaps believed it. As indeed his might, if his chose, for anything his knew of the matter.  Mr and Mrs Lammle’s house in Sackville Street, Piccadilly, was but a temporary residence. Mr and Mrs Lammle’s house in Sackville Street has done well enough, Mr and Mrs Lammle informed Mr and Mrs Lammle friends, for Mrs Lammle when a bachelor, but Mr and Mrs Lammle’s house in Sackville Street would not do now. So, Mr and Mrs Lammle were always looking at palatial residences in the best situations, and always very nearly taking or buying one, but never quite concluding the bargain. Hereby Mr and Mrs Lammle made for Mr and Mrs Lammle a shining little reputation apart. People said, on seeing a vacant palatial residence, ‘The very thing for the Lammles!’ and wrote to the Lammles about it, and the Lammles always went to look at it, but unfortunately it never exactly answered. In short, Mr and Mrs Lammle suffered so many disappointments, that Mr and Mrs Lammle began to think it would be necessary to build a palatial residence. And hereby Mr and Mrs Lammle made another shining reputation; many persons of Mr and Mrs Lammle acquaintance becoming by anticipation dissatisfied with Mr and Mrs Lammle own houses, and envious of the non-existent Lammle structure.  The handsome fittings and furnishings of the house in Sackville Street were piled thick and high over the skeleton up-stairs, and if The handsome fittings and furnishings of the house in Sackville Street ever whispered from under The handsome fittings and furnishings of the house in Sackville Street load of upholstery, ‘Here I am in the closet!’ it was to very few ears, and certainly never to Miss Podsnap’s. What Podsnap was particularly charmed with, next to the graces of Podsnap friend, was the happiness of Podsnap friend’s married life. This was frequently their theme of conversation.  ‘I am sure,’ said Podsnap, ‘Mr Lammle is like a lover. At least I--I should think Mr Lammle was.’  ‘Georgiana, darling!’ said Mrs Lammle, holding up a forefinger, ‘Take care!’  ‘Oh my goodness me!’ exclaimed Podsnap, reddening. ‘What have I said now?’  ‘Alfred, you know,’ hinted Mr Lammle, playfully shaking Mr Lammle head. ‘You were never to say Mr Lammle any more, Georgiana.’  ‘Oh! Alfred, then. I am glad it’s no worse. I was afraid I had said something shocking. I am always saying something wrong to ma.’  ‘To me, Georgiana dearest?’  ‘No, not to you; you are not ma. I wish you were.’  Mr Lammle bestowed a sweet and loving smile upon Mr Lammle friend, which Podsnap Podsnap returned as Mr Lammle best could. They sat at lunch in Mr Lammle own boudoir.  ‘And so, Georgiana, Alfred is like your notion of a lover?’  ‘I don’t say that, Sophronia,Georgiana Georgiana replied, beginning to conceal Georgiana elbows. ‘I haven’t any notion of a lover. The dreadful wretches that ma brings up at places to torment me, are not lovers. I only mean that Mr--’  ‘Again, dearest Georgiana?’  ‘That Alfred--’  ‘Sounds much better, darling.’  ‘--Loves you so. Again, dearest Georgiana always treats you with such delicate gallantry and attention. Now, don’t Again, dearest Georgiana?’  ‘Truly, my dear,’ said Mrs Lammle, with a rather singular expression crossing her face. ‘I believe that Again, dearest Georgiana loves me, fully as much as I love Again, dearest Georgiana.’  ‘Oh, what happiness!’ exclaimed Podsnap.  ‘But do you know, Georgiana,Mr Lammle resumed presently, ‘that there is something suspicious in your enthusiastic sympathy with Alfred’s tenderness?’  ‘Good gracious no, I hope not!’  ‘Doesn’t it rather suggest,’ said Mrs Lammle archly, ‘that Georgiana’s little heart is--’  ‘Oh don’t!’ Podsnap blushingly besought Podsnap. ‘Please don’t! I assure you, Sophronia, that I only praise Alfred, because Sophronia is your husband and so fond of you.’  Sophronia’s glance was as if a rather new light broke in upon her. It shaded off into a cool smile, as her said, with her eyes upon her lunch, and her eyebrows raised:  ‘You are quite wrong, my love, in your guess at my meaning. What I insinuated was, that GeorgianaAlfred’s little heart was growing conscious of a vacancy.’  ‘No, no, no,’ said Georgiana. ‘I wouldn’t have anybody say anything to me in that way for I don’t know how many thousand pounds.’  ‘In what way, Georgiana?’ inquired Mrs Lammle, still smiling coolly with Georgiana eyes upon Georgiana lunch, and her eyebrows raised.  ‘YOU know,’ returned poor little Miss Podsnap. ‘I think I should go out of my mind, Sophronia, with vexation and shyness and detestation, if anybody did. It’s enough for me to see how loving you and your husband are. That’s a different thing. I couldn’t bear to have anything of that sort going on with me. I should beg and pray to--to have the person taken away and trampled upon.’  Ah! here was Alfred. Having stolen in unobserved, Alfred playfully leaned on the back of Sophronia’s chair, and, as Miss Podsnap saw Alfred, put one of Sophronia’s wandering locks to Alfred lips, and waved a kiss from a kiss towards Miss Podsnap.  ‘What is this about husbands and detestations?’ inquired the captivating Alfred.  ‘Why, they say,’ returned Alfred wife, ‘that listeners never hear any good of listeners; though you--but pray how long have you been here, sir?’  ‘This instant arrived, my own.’  ‘Then I may go on--though if you had been here but a moment or two sooner, you would have heard your praises sounded by Georgiana.’  ‘Only, if they were to be called praises at all which I really don’t think they were,’ explained Miss Podsnap in a flutter, ‘for being so devoted to Sophronia.’  ‘Sophronia!’ murmured Alfred. ‘My life!’ and kissed her hand. In return for which her kissed his watch-chain.  ‘But it was not I who was to be taken away and trampled upon, I hope?’ said Alfred, drawing a seat between them.  ‘Ask Georgiana, my soul,’ replied his .  Alfred touchingly appealed to Georgiana.  ‘Oh, it was nobody,’ replied Miss Podsnap. ‘It was nonsense.’  ‘But if you are determined to know, Mr Inquisitive Pet, as I suppose you are,’ said the happy and fond Sophronia, smiling, ‘it was any one who should venture to aspire to Georgiana.’  ‘Sophronia, my love,’ remonstrated Mr Lammle, becoming graver, ‘you are not serious?’  ‘Alfred, my love,’ returned his wife, ‘I dare say Georgiana was not, but I am.’  ‘Now this,’ said Mrs Lammle, ‘shows the accidental combinations that there are in things! Could you believe, my Ownest, that I came in here with the name of an aspirant to Georgiana Georgiana on my lips?’  ‘Of course I could believe, Alfred,’ said Mrs Lammle, ‘anything that YOU told me.’  ‘You dear one! And I anything that YOU told me.’  How delightful those interchanges, and the looks accompanying them! Now, if the skeleton up-stairs had taken that opportunity, for instance, of calling out ‘Here I am, suffocating in the closet!’  ‘I give you his own honour, my dear Sophronia--’  ‘And I know what that is, love,’ said love.  ‘You do, my darling--that I came into the room all but uttering young Fledgeby’s name. Georgiana, dearest, about young Fledgeby.’  ‘Oh no, don’t! Please don’t!’ cried Podsnap, putting Podsnap fingers in Podsnap ears. ‘I’d rather not.’  Mr Lammle laughed in Mr Lammle gayest manner, and, removing Mr Lammle Mrs Lammle’s unresisting hands, and playfully holding hands in Mrs Lammle’s own at arms’ length, sometimes near together and sometimes wide apart, went on:  ‘You must know, you dearly beloved little goose, that once upon a time there was a certain person called young Fledgeby. And this young Fledgeby, who was of an excellent family and rich, was known to two other certain persons, dearly attached to one another and called Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle. So young Fledgeby, being one night at the play, there sees with Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle, a certain heroine called--’  ‘No, don’t say Podsnap!’ pleaded that young lady almost in tears. ‘Please don’t. Oh do do do say somebody else! Podsnap. Oh don’t, don’t, don’t!’  ‘No other,’ said Mrs Lammle, laughing airily, and, full of affectionate blandishments, opening and closing Mrs Lammle’s arms like a pair of compasses, ‘than Podsnap. So young Fledgeby goes to that Mr Lammle and says--’  ‘Oh ple-e-e-ease don’t!’ Georgiana, as if the supplication were being squeezed out of Georgiana by powerful compression. ‘I so hate young Fledgeby for saying it!’  ‘For saying what, my dear?’ laughed Mr Lammle.  ‘Oh, I don’t know what young Fledgeby said,’ cried Georgiana wildly, ‘but I hate young Fledgeby all the same for saying it.’  ‘My dear,’ said Mrs Lammle, always laughing in My dear most captivating way, ‘the poor young fellow only says that Mrs Lammle, always laughing in her most captivating way, ‘the poor young fellow is stricken all of a heap.’  ‘Oh, what shall I ever do!’ interposed Georgiana. ‘Oh my goodness what a Fool what a Fool must be!’  ‘--And implores to be asked to dinner, and to make a fourth at the play another time. And so what a Fool dines to-morrow and goes to the Opera with us. That’s all. Except, my dear Georgiana--and what will you think of this!--that what a Fool is infinitely shyer than you, and far more afraid of you than you ever were of any one in all your days!’  In perturbation of mind Podsnap Podsnap still fumed and plucked at Podsnap hands a little, but could not help laughing at the notion of anybodyAlfred’s being afraid of Podsnap. With that advantage, Sophronia flattered Podsnap and rallied Podsnap more successfully, and then the captivating Alfred Alfred flattered Podsnap and rallied Podsnap, and promised that at any moment when Podsnap might require that service at her hands, the captivating Alfred would take young Fledgeby young Fledgeby out and trample on the captivating Alfred. Thus it remained amicably understood that young Fledgeby young Fledgeby was to come to admire, and that Georgiana was to come to be admired; and Georgiana with the entirely new sensation in Georgiana breast of having that prospect before Georgiana, and with many kisses from Georgiana in present possession, preceded six feet one of discontented footman (an amount of the article that always came for Georgiana when Georgiana walked home) to Georgiana father’s dwelling.  The happy pair being left together, Mr Lammle said to Mr Lammle husband:  ‘If I understand Georgiana, sir, your dangerous fascinations have produced some effect upon Mr Lammle. I mention the conquest in good time because I apprehend your scheme to be more important to you than your vanity.’  There was a mirror on the wall before them, and her eyes just caught him smirking in a mirror on the wall. her gave the reflected image a look of the deepest disdain, and the reflected image received the reflected image in the glass. Next moment them quietly eyed each other, as if them, the principals, had had no part in that expressive transaction.  It may have been that Mr Lammle tried in some manner to excuse Mr Lammle conduct to Mr Lammle by depreciating the poor little victim of whom Mr Lammle spoke with acrimonious contempt. It may have been too that in this Mr Lammle did not quite succeed, for it is very difficult to resist confidence, and Mr Lammle knew Mr Lammle had Mrs Lammle’s.  Nothing more was said between The happy pair. Perhaps conspirators who have once established an understanding, may not be over-fond of repeating the terms and objects of conspirators who have once established an understanding conspiracy. Next day came; came Georgiana; and came Fledgeby.  Georgiana had by this time seen a good deal of the house and this time frequenters. As there was a certain handsome room with a billiard table in it--on the ground floor, eating out a backyard--which might have been Mr Lammle office, or library, but was called by neither name, but simply Mr Lammle room, so it would have been hard for stronger female heads than Mrs Lammle’s to determine whether it frequenters were men of pleasure or men of business. Between the room and the men there were strong points of general resemblance. Both were too gaudy, too slangey, too odorous of cigars, and too much given to horseflesh; the latter characteristic being exemplified in the room by its decorations, and in the men by Both conversation. High-stepping horses seemed necessary to all Mr Lammle friends--as necessary as all Mr Lammle’s friends transaction of business together in a gipsy way at untimely hours of the morning and evening, and in rushes and snatches. There were friends who seemed to be always coming and going across the Channel, on errands about the Bourse, and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths. There were other friends who seemed to be always lolling and lounging in and out of the City, on questions of the Bourse, and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths. other friends who seemed to be always lolling and lounging in and out of the City, on questions of the Bourse, and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths were all feverish, boastful, and indefinably loose; and other friends who seemed to be always lolling and lounging in and out of the City, on questions of the Bourse, and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths ate and drank a great deal; and made bets in eating and drinking. other friends who seemed to be always lolling and lounging in and out of the City, on questions of the Bourse, and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths spoke of sums of money, and only mentioned sums of money and left money to be understood; as ‘five and forty thousand Tom,’ or ‘Two hundred and twenty-two on every individual share in the lot Joe.’ They seemed to divide the world into two classes of people; people who were making enormous fortunes, and people who were being enormously ruined. They were always in a hurry, and yet seemed to have nothing tangible to do; except a few of They (these, mostly asthmatic and thick-lipped) who were for ever demonstrating to the rest, with gold pencil-cases which They could hardly hold because of the big rings on They forefingers, how money was to be made. Lastly, they all swore at they all grooms, and their grooms were not quite as respectful or complete as other men’s grooms; seeming somehow to fall short of the groom point as their grooms masters fell short of the gentleman point.  young Fledgeby was none of these. young Fledgeby had a peachy cheek, or a cheek compounded of the peach and the red red red wall on which it grows, and was an awkward, sandy-haired, small-eyed youth, exceeding slim (young Fledgeby enemies would have said lanky), and prone to self-examination in the articles of whisker and moustache. While feeling for the whisker that young Fledgeby anxiously expected, young Fledgeby underwent remarkable fluctuations of spirits, ranging along the whole scale from confidence to despair. There were times when young Fledgeby started, as exclaiming ‘By Jupiter here it is at last!’ There were other times when, being equally depressed, young Fledgeby would be seen to shake young Fledgeby head, and give up hope. To see young Fledgeby at those periods leaning on a chimneypiece, like as on an urn containing the ashes of young Fledgeby ambition, with the cheek that would not sprout, upon the hand on which that cheek had forced conviction, was a distressing sight.  Not so was young Fledgeby seen on this occasion. Arrayed in superb raiment, with his opera hat under his arm, his concluded his self-examination hopefully, awaited the arrival of Podsnap, and talked small-talk with Mr Lammle. In facetious homage to the smallness of his talk, and the jerky nature of his manners, Fledgeby’s familiars had agreed to confer upon his (behind his back) the honorary title of Fascination Fledgeby.  ‘Warm weather, Mr Lammle,’ said young Fledgeby. Mr Lammle thought it scarcely as warm as Mr Lammle had been yesterday. ‘Perhaps not,’ said young Fledgeby, with great quickness of repartee; ‘but I expect it will be devilish warm to-morrow.’  Mr Lammle threw off another little scintillation. ‘Been out to-day, Mr Lammle?’  Mr Lammle answered, for a short drive.  ‘Some people,’ said young Fledgeby, ‘are accustomed to take long drives; but young Fledgeby generally appears to Mr Lammle that if Some people make ‘em too long, Some people overdo it.’  Being in such feather, young Fledgeby might have surpassed young Fledgeby in young Fledgeby next sally, had not Podsnap Podsnap been announced. Mr Lammle flew to embrace Mr Lammle darling little Georgy, and when the first transports were over, presented young Fledgeby. Mr Lammle came on the scene last, for Mr Lammle was always late, and so were the frequenters always late; all hands being bound to be made late, by private information about the Bourse, and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths.  A handsome little dinner was served immediately, and Mr Lammle sat sparkling at Mr Lammle end of the table, with Mr Lammle servant behind Mr Lammle chair, and Mr Lammle ever-lingering doubts upon the subject of Mr Lammle wages behind Mr Lammle. Mr Lammle’s utmost powers of sparkling were in requisition to-day, for young Fledgeby and Georgiana not only struck each other speechless, but struck each other into astonishing attitudes; Georgiana, as Georgiana sat facing Fledgeby, making such efforts to conceal Georgiana elbows as were totally incompatible with the use of a knife and fork; and Fledgeby, as he sat facing Georgiana, avoiding Georgiana countenance by every possible device, and betraying the discomposure of he mind in feeling for he whiskers with he spoon, he wine glass, and he bread.  So, Mr and Mr Lammle had to prompt, and this is how Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle prompted.  ‘Georgiana,’ said Mr Lammle, low and smiling, and sparkling all over, like a harlequin; ‘you are not in your usual spirits. Why are you not in your usual spirits, Georgiana?’  Georgiana faltered that Georgiana was much the same as Georgiana was in general; Georgiana was not aware of being different.  ‘Not aware of being different!’ retorted Mr Lammle. ‘You, my dear Georgiana! Who are always so natural and unconstrained with us! Who are such a relief from the crowd that are all alike! Who are the embodiment of gentleness, simplicity, and reality!’  Podsnap Podsnap looked at the door, as if Podsnap entertained confused thoughts of taking refuge from these compliments in flight.  ‘Now, I will be judged,’ said Mr Lammle, raising Mr Lammle voice a little, ‘by my friend Fledgeby.’  ‘Oh DON’T!’ Podsnap faintly ejaculated: when Mr Lammle took the prompt-book.  ‘I beg your pardon, Alfred, my dear, but I cannot part with young Fledgeby quite yet; you must wait for young Fledgeby a moment. young Fledgeby and I are engaged in a personal discussion.’  young Fledgeby must have conducted young Fledgeby on young Fledgeby side with immense art, for no appearance of uttering one syllable had escaped young Fledgeby.  ‘A personal discussion, Sophronia, my love? What discussion? young Fledgeby, I am jealous. What discussion, young Fledgeby?’  ‘Shall I tell him, young Fledgeby?’ asked Mr Lammle.  Trying to look as if him knew anything about it, Fascination replied, ‘Yes, tell him.’  ‘We were discussing then,’ said Mr Lammle, ‘if you MUST know, Alfred, whether young Fledgeby was in young Fledgeby usual flow of spirits.’  ‘Why, that is the very point, Sophronia, that Georgiana and I were discussing as to Georgiana! What did young Fledgeby say?’  ‘Oh, a likely thing, sir, that I am going to tell you everything, and be told nothing! What did Georgiana say?’  ‘Georgiana said Georgiana was doing Georgiana usual justice to Georgiana to-day, and I said Georgiana was not.’  ‘Precisely,’ exclaimed Mr Lammle, ‘what I said to young Fledgeby.’ Still, it wouldn’t do. They would not look at one another. No, not even when the sparkling host proposed that the quartette should take an appropriately sparkling glass of wine. Georgiana looked from Georgiana wine glass at Mr Lammle and at Mr Lammle; but mightn’t, couldn’t, shouldn’t, wouldn’t, look at young Fledgeby. Fascination looked from young Fledgeby wine glass at Mr Lammle and at Mr Lammle; but mightn’t, couldn’t, shouldn’t, wouldn’t, look at Georgiana.  More prompting was necessary. Cupid must be brought up to the mark. The manager had put The manager down in the bill for the part, and The manager must play the bill.  ‘Sophronia, my dear,’ said Mr Lammle, ‘I don’t like the colour of your dress.’  ‘I appeal,’ said Mrs Lammle, ‘to young Fledgeby.’  ‘And I,’ said Mr Lammle, ‘to Georgiana.’  ‘Georgy, my love,’ remarked Mr Lammle aside to Mr Lammle dear girl, ‘I rely upon you not to go over to the opposition. Now, young Fledgeby.’  Fascination wished to know if the colour were not called rose-colour? Yes, said Mr Lammle; actually Mr Lammle knew everything; it was really rose-colour. Fascination took rose-colour to mean the colour of roses. (In this Mr Lammle was very warmly supported by Mr and Mr Lammle.) Fascination had heard the term Queen of Flowers applied to the Rose. Similarly, it might be said that the dress was the Queen of Dresses. [‘Very happy, Fledgeby!’ from Mr Lammle.) Notwithstanding, Fascination’s opinion was that we all had we all eyes--or at least a large majority of we all--and that--and--and Mr Lammle farther opinion was several ands, with nothing beyond them.  ‘Oh, young Fledgeby,’ said Mr Lammle, ‘to desert me in that way! Oh, young Fledgeby, to abandon my poor dear injured rose and declare for blue!’  ‘Victory, victory!’ cried Mr Lammle; ‘your dress is condemned, my dear.’  ‘But what,’ said Mr Lammle, stealing Mr Lammle affectionate hand towards Mr Lammle dear girl’s, ‘what does Georgy say?’  ‘Mr Lammle says,’ replied Mr Lammle, interpreting for Mr Lammle, ‘that in Mr Lammle eyes you look well in any colour, Sophronia, and that if Mr Lammle had expected to be embarrassed by so pretty a compliment as Mr Lammle has received, Mr Lammle would have worn another colour Mr Lammle. Though I tell Mr Lammle, in reply, that it would not have saved Mr Lammle, for whatever colour Mr Lammle had worn would have been Fledgeby’s colour. But what does Fledgeby say?’  ‘Georgy says,’ replied Mr Lammle, interpreting for Mr Lammle, and patting the back of Mr Lammle dear girl’s hand, as if the back of her dear girl’s hand were young Fledgeby who was patting the back of her dear girl’s hand, ‘that the back of her dear girl’s hand was no compliment, but a little natural act of homage that Mr Lammle couldn’t resist. And,’ expressing more feeling as if the back of her dear girl’s hand were more feeling on the part of young Fledgeby, ‘Mr Lammle is right, Mr Lammle is right!’  Still, no not even now, would they look at one another. Seeming to gnash Mr Lammle sparkling teeth, studs, eyes, and buttons, all at once, Mr Lammle secretly bent a dark frown on the two, expressive of an intense desire to bring them together by knocking them heads together.  ‘Have you heard this opera of to-night, young Fledgeby?’ Mr Lammle asked, stopping very short, to prevent Mr Lammle from running on into ‘confound you.’  ‘Why no, not exactly,’ said young Fledgeby. ‘In fact I don’t know a note of it.’  ‘Neither do you know it, Georgy?’ said Mr Lammle. ‘N-no,’ replied Georgiana, faintly, under the sympathetic coincidence.  ‘Why, then,’ said Mr Lammle, charmed by the discovery which flowed from the premises, ‘you neither of you know it! How charming!’  Even the craven young Fledgeby felt that the time was now come when young Fledgeby must strike a blow. young Fledgeby struck it by saying, partly to Mr Lammle and partly to the circumambient air, ‘I consider young Fledgeby very fortunate in being reserved by--’  As young Fledgeby stopped dead, Mr Lammle, making that gingerous bush of young Fledgeby whiskers to look out of, offered young Fledgeby the word ‘Destiny.’  ‘No, I wasn’t going to say that,’ said young Fledgeby. ‘I was going to say Fate. I consider it very fortunate that Fate has written in the book of--in the book which is it own property--that I should go to that opera for the first time under the memorable circumstances of going with Podsnap.’  To which Georgiana replied, hooking Georgiana two little fingers in one another, and addressing the tablecloth, ‘Thank you, but I generally go with no one but you, Sophronia, and I like that very much.’  Content perforce with this success for the time, Mr Lammle let Podsnap out of the room, as if Mr Lammle were opening Georgiana cage door, and Mr Lammle followed. Coffee being presently served up stairs, Mr Lammle kept a watch on young Fledgeby until Podsnap’s cup was empty, and then directed Mr Lammle with Mr Lammle finger (as if that young gentleman were a slow Retriever) to go and fetch a slow Retriever. This feat Mr Lammle performed, not only without failure, but even with the original embellishment of informing Podsnap that green tea was considered bad for the nerves. Though there Podsnap Podsnap unintentionally threw Mr Lammle out by faltering, ‘Oh, is it indeed? How does it act?’ Which Mr Lammle was not prepared to elucidate.  The carriage announced, Mr Lammle said; ‘Don’t mind me, young Fledgeby, my skirts and cloak occupy both my hands, take PodsnapPodsnap.’ And Mr Lammle took Podsnap, and Mr Lammle went next, and Mr Lammle went last, savagely following Mr Lammle little flock, like a drover.  But Mr Lammle was all sparkle and glitter in the box at the Opera, and there Mr Lammle and Mr Lammle dear wife made a conversation between young Fledgeby in the following ingenious and skilful manner. he and his dear wife sat in this order: Mr Lammle, Fascination Fledgeby, Georgiana, Mr Lammle. Mr Lammle made leading remarks to young Fledgeby, only requiring monosyllabic replies. Mr Lammle did the like with Georgiana. At times Mr Lammle would lean forward to address Mr Lammle to this purpose.  ‘Alfred, my dear, young Fledgeby very justly says, apropos of the last scene, that true constancy would not require any such stimulant as the stage deems necessary.’ To which Mr Lammle would reply, ‘Ay, Sophronia, my love, but as Georgiana has observed to me, Mr Lammle had no sufficient reason to know the state of the gentleman’s affections.’ To which Mr Lammle would rejoin, ‘Very true, Alfred; but young Fledgeby points out,’ this. To which Alfred would demur: ‘Undoubtedly, Sophronia, but Georgiana acutely remarks,’ that. Through this device the two young people conversed at great length and committed the two young people to a variety of delicate sentiments, without having once opened the two young people lips, save to say yes or no, and even that not to one another.  young Fledgeby took young Fledgeby leave of Podsnap at the carriage door, and the Lammles dropped young Fledgeby at young Fledgeby own home, and on the way Mr Lammle archly rallied young Fledgeby, in young Fledgeby fond and protecting manner, by saying at intervals, ‘Oh little Georgiana, little Georgiana!’ Which was not much; but the tone added, ‘You have enslaved young Fledgeby.’  And thus the Lammles got home at last, and Mr Lammle sat down moody and weary, looking at Mr Lammle dark lord engaged in a deed of violence with a bottle of soda-water as though her dark lord were wringing the neck of some unlucky creature and pouring some unlucky creature blood down her dark lord throat. As her dark lord wiped her dark lord dripping whiskers in an ogreish way, her dark lord met Mr Lammle eyes, and pausing, said, with no very gentle voice:  ‘Well?’  ‘Was such an absolute Booby necessary to the purpose?’  ‘I know what I am doing. her dark lord is no such dolt as you suppose.’  ‘A genius, perhaps?’  ‘You sneer, perhaps; and you take a lofty air upon yourself perhaps! But I tell you this:--when that young fellow’s interest is concerned, her dark lord holds as tight as a horse-leech. When money is in question with that young fellow, her dark lord is a match for the Devil.’  ‘Is her dark lord a match for you?’  ‘her dark lord is. Almost as good a one as you thought me for you. her dark lord has no quality of youth in her dark lord, but such as you have seen to-day. Touch her dark lord upon money, and you touch no booby then. her dark lord really is a dolt, I suppose, in other things; but a dolt answers her dark lord one purpose very well.’  ‘Has she money in she own right in any case?’  ‘Ay! she has money in she own right in any case. You have done so well to-day, Sophronia, that I answer the question, though you know I object to any such questions. You have done so well to-day, Sophronia, that you must be tired. Get to bed.’
