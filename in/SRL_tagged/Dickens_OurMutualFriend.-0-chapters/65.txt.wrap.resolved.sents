 CHECKMATE TO THE FRIENDLY MOVE   Mr Wegg had so timed Mr Wegg taking possession of Mr Wegg rightful name and Mr Wegg London house, that the event befel on the very day when the last waggon-load of the last Mound was driven out at the gates of Boffin’s Bower.
As it jolted away, Mr Wegg felt that the last load was correspondingly removed from Mr Wegg mind, and hailed the auspicious season when that black sheep, Boffin, was to be closely sheared.
Over the whole slow process of levelling the Mounds, Silas had kept watch with rapacious eyes.
But, eyes no less rapacious had watched the growth of the Mounds in years bygone, and had vigilantly sifted the dust of which they were composed.
No valuables turned up.
How should there be any, seeing that the old hard jailer of Harmony Jail had coined every waif and stray into money, long before?
Though disappointed by this bare result, Mr Wegg felt too sensibly relieved by the close of the labour, to grumble to any great extent.
A foreman-representative of the dust contractors, purchasers of the Mounds, had worn Mr Wegg down to skin and bone.
This supervisor of the proceedings, asserting Mr Wegg employers’ rights to cart off by daylight, nightlight, torchlight, when his employers would, must have been the death of Silas if the work had lasted much longer.
Seeming never to need sleep Mr Wegg, Mr Wegg would reappear, with a tied-up broken head, in fantail hat and velveteen smalls, like an accursed goblin, at the most unholy and untimely hours.
Tired out by keeping close ward over a long day’s work in fog and rain, Silas would have just crawled to bed and be dozing, when a horrid shake and rumble under Silas pillow would announce an approaching train of carts, escorted by this Demon of Unrest, to fall to work again.
At another time, Silas would be rumbled up out of Silas soundest sleep, in the dead of the night; at another, would be kept at Silas post eight-and-forty hours on end.
The more Silas persecutor besought Silas not to trouble Silas to turn out, the more suspicious was the crafty Wegg that indications had been observed of something hidden somewhere, and that attempts were on foot to circumvent Silas.
So continually broken was Silas rest through these means, that Silas led the life of having wagered to keep ten thousand dog-watches in ten thousand hours, and looked piteously upon Silas as always getting up and yet never going to bed.
So gaunt and haggard had Silas grown at last, that Silas wooden leg showed disproportionate, and presented a thriving appearance in contrast with the rest of Silas plagued body, which might almost have been termed chubby.
However, Wegg’s comfort was, that all Silas disagreeables were now over, and that Silas was immediately coming into Silas property.
Of late, the grindstone did undoubtedly appear to have been whirling at Silas own nose rather than Boffin’s, but Boffin’s nose was now to be sharpened fine.
Thus far, the crafty Wegg had let the crafty Wegg dusty friend off lightly, having been baulked in that amiable design of frequently dining with the crafty Wegg, by the machinations of the sleepless dustman.
the crafty Wegg had been constrained to depute Mr Venus to keep their dusty friend, Boffin, under inspection, while the crafty Wegg himself turned lank and lean at the Bower.
To Mr Venus’s museum the crafty Wegg repaired when at length the Mounds were down and gone.
It being evening, the crafty Wegg found that gentleman, as the crafty Wegg expected, seated over the crafty Wegg fire; but did not find the crafty Wegg, as he expected, floating the crafty Wegg powerful mind in tea.
‘Why, you smell rather comfortable here!’ said Wegg, seeming to take it ill, and stopping and sniffing as the crafty Wegg entered.
‘I AM rather comfortable, sir,’ said Mr Venus.
‘You don’t use lemon in your business, do you?’ asked the crafty Wegg, sniffing again.
‘No, the crafty Wegg,’ said Mr Venus.
‘When I use it at all, I mostly use it in cobblers’ punch.’  ‘What do you call cobblers’ punch?’ demanded the crafty Wegg, in a worse humour than before.
‘It’s difficult to impart the receipt for It, sir,’ returned Mr Venus, ‘because, however particular you may be in allotting your materials, so much will still depend upon the individual gifts, and there being a feeling thrown into It.
But the groundwork is gin.’  ‘In a Dutch bottle?’ said the crafty Wegg gloomily, as he sat he down.
‘Very good, sir, very good!’ cried Mr Venus.
‘Will you partake, sir?’  ‘Will I partake?’ returned the crafty Wegg very surlily.
‘Why, of course I will!
WILL a man partake, as has been tormented out of a man five senses by an everlasting dustman with a man head tied up!
WILL a man, too!
As if a man wouldn’t!’  ‘Don’t let it put you out, the crafty Wegg.
You don’t seem in your usual spirits.’  ‘If you come to that, you don’t seem in your usual spirits,’ growled the crafty Wegg.
‘You seem to be setting up for lively.’  This circumstance appeared, in his then state of mind, to give the crafty Wegg uncommon offence.
‘And you’ve been having your hair cut!’ said Wegg, missing the usual dusty shock.
‘Yes, the crafty Wegg.
But don’t let that put you out, either.’  ‘And I am blest if you ain’t getting fat!’ said Wegg, with culminating discontent.
‘What are you going to do next?’  ‘Well, the crafty Wegg,’ said Mr Venus, smiling in a sprightly manner, ‘I suspect you could hardly guess what I am going to do next.’  ‘I don’t want to guess,’ retorted the crafty Wegg.
‘All I’ve got to say is, that it’s well for you that the diwision of labour has been what the diwision of labour has been.
the diwision of labour’s well for you to have had so light a part in this business, when mine has been so heavy.
You haven’t had YOUR rest broke, I’ll be bound.’  ‘Not at all, sir,’ said Mr Venus.
‘Never rested so well in all my life, I thank you.’  ‘Ah!’ grumbled Wegg, ‘you should have been me.
If you had been me, and had been fretted out of your bed, and your sleep, and your meals, and your mind, for a stretch of months together, you’d have been out of condition and out of sorts.’  ‘Certainly, it has trained you down, the crafty Wegg,’ said Mr Venus, contemplating the crafty Wegg figure with an artist’s eye.
‘Trained you down very low, it has!
So weazen and yellow is the kivering upon your bones, that one might almost fancy you had come to give a look-in upon the French gentleman in the corner, instead of me.’  Mr Wegg, glancing in great dudgeon towards the French gentleman’s corner, seemed to notice something new there, which induced him to glance at the opposite corner, and then to put on him glasses and stare at all the nooks and corners of the dim shop in succession.
‘Why, you’ve been having the place cleaned up!’ him exclaimed.
‘Yes, the crafty Wegg.
By the hand of adorable woman.’  ‘Then what you’re going to do next, I suppose, is to get married?’  ‘That’s it, sir.’  Silas took off Silas glasses again--finding Silas too intensely disgusted by the sprightly appearance of Silas friend and partner to bear a magnified view of Silas and made the inquiry:  ‘To the old party?’  ‘the crafty Wegg!’ said Venus, with a sudden flush of wrath.
‘The lady in question is not a old party.’  ‘I meant,’ exclaimed the crafty Wegg, testily, ‘to the old party as formerly objected?’  ‘the crafty Wegg,’ said Venus, ‘in a case of so much delicacy, I must trouble you to say what you mean.
There are strings that must not be played upon.
Sir!
Not sounded, unless in the most respectful and tuneful manner.
Of such melodious strings is Miss Pleasant Riderhood formed.’  ‘Then it IS the lady as formerly objected?’ said the crafty Wegg.
‘Sir,’ returned Venus with dignity, ‘I accept the altered phrase.
the altered phrase is the lady as formerly objected.’  ‘When is it to come off?’ asked Silas.
‘the crafty Wegg,’ said Venus, with another flush.
‘I cannot permit the altered phrase to be put in the form of a Fight.
I must temperately but firmly call upon you, Sir, to amend that question.’  ‘When is the lady,the crafty Wegg reluctantly demanded, constraining the crafty Wegg ill temper in remembrance of the partnership and the crafty Wegg stock in trade, ‘a going to give the lady ‘and where the lady has already given the lady ‘art?’  ‘Sir,’ returned Venus, ‘I again accept the altered phrase, and with pleasure.
the lady is a going to give the lady ‘and where the lady has already given the lady ‘art, next Monday.’  ‘Then the lady’s objection has been met?’ said Silas.
‘the crafty Wegg,’ said Venus, ‘as I did name to you, I think, on a former occasion, if not on former occasions--’  ‘On former occasions,’ interrupted Wegg.
‘--What,’ pursued Venus, ‘what the nature of the ladythe lady’s objection was, I may impart, without violating any of the tender confidences since sprung up between the lady and myself, how it has been met, through the kind interference of two good friends of mine: one, previously acquainted with the lady: and one, not.
The pint was thrown out, Sir, by two good friends of mine when two good friends of mine did me the great service of waiting on the lady to try if a union betwixt the lady and me could not be brought to bear--the pint, I say, was thrown out by two good friends of mine, Sir, whether if, after marriage, I confined myself to the articulation of men, children, and the lower animals, The pint might not relieve the lady’s mind of the lady feeling respecting being as a lady--regarded in a bony light.
It was a happy thought, sir, and It took root.’  ‘It would seem, Mr Venus,’ observed Wegg, with a touch of distrust, ‘that you are flush of friends?’  ‘Pretty well, Sir,’ that gentleman answered, in a tone of placid mystery.
‘So-so, Sir.
Pretty well.’  ‘However,’ said Mr Wegg, after eyeing Mr Wegg with another touch of distrust, ‘I wish you joy.
One man spends One man fortune in one way, and another in another.
You are going to try matrimony.
I mean to try travelling.’  ‘Indeed, the crafty Wegg?’  ‘Change of air, sea-scenery, and my natural rest, I hope may bring me round after the persecutions I have undergone from the dustman with his head tied up, which I just now mentioned.
The tough job being ended and the Mounds laid low, the hour is come for Boffin to stump up.
Would ten to-morrow morning suit you, partner, for finally bringing Boffin’s nose to the grindstone?’  Ten to-morrow morning would quite suit Mr Venus for that excellent purpose.
‘You have had him well under inspection, I hope?’ said Silas.
Mr Venus had had him under inspection pretty well every day.
‘Suppose you was just to step round to-night then, and give him orders from me--I say from me, because him knows I won’t be played with--to be ready with him papers, him accounts, and him cash, at that time in the morning?’ said Mr Wegg.
‘And as a matter of form, which will be agreeable to your own feelings, before we go out (for I’ll walk with you part of the way, though my leg gives under me with weariness), letthe lady’s have a look at the stock in trade.’  Mr Venus produced it, and it was perfectly correct; Mr Venus undertook to produce it again in the morning, and to keep tryst with Mr Wegg on Boffin’s doorstep as the clock struck ten.
At a certain point of the road between Clerkenwell and Boffin’s house (the crafty Wegg expressly insisted that there should be no prefix to the Golden Dustman’s name) the partners separated for the night.
It was a very bad night; to which succeeded a very bad morning.
The streets were so unusually slushy, muddy, and miserable, in the morning, that the crafty Wegg rode to the scene of action; arguing that a man who was, as it were, going to the Bank to draw out a handsome property, could well afford that trifling expense.
Mr Venus was punctual, and the crafty Wegg undertook to knock at Door, and conduct the conference.
Door knocked at.
Door opened.
‘MR Boffin?’  The servant replied that MR Boffin was at home.
‘The servant’ll do,’ said the crafty Wegg, ‘though it ain’t what I call The servant.’  The servant inquired if they had any appointment?
‘Now, I tell you what, young fellow,’ said the crafty Wegg, ‘I won’t have it.
This won’t do for The servant.
I don’t want menials.
I want Boffin.’  They were shown into a waiting-room, where the crafty Wegg wore the crafty Wegg hat, and whistled, and with the crafty Wegg forefinger stirred up a clock that stood upon the chimneypiece, until the crafty Wegg made it strike.
In a few minutes They were shown upstairs into what used to be Boffin’s room; which, besides the door of entrance, had folding-doors in it, to make it one of a suite of rooms when occasion required.
Here, Boffin was seated at a library-table, and here the crafty Wegg, having imperiously motioned The servant to withdraw, drew up a chair and seated The servant, in his hat, close beside The servant.
Here, also, the crafty Wegg instantly underwent the remarkable experience of having his hat twitched off the crafty Wegg head and thrown out of a window, which was opened and shut for the purpose.
‘Be careful what insolent liberties you take in that gentlemanthe lady’s presence,’ said the owner of the hand which had done this, ‘or I will throw you after this.’  the crafty Wegg involuntarily clapped the hand to his , and stared at the Secretary.
For, it was his addressed his with a severe countenance, and who had come in quietly by the folding-doors.
‘Oh!’ said Wegg, as soon as his recovered his suspended power of speech.
‘Very good!
I gave directions for YOU to be dismissed.
And you ain’t gone, ain’t you?
Oh!
We’ll look into this presently.
Very good!’  ‘No, nor I ain’t gone,’ said another voice.
Somebody else had come in quietly by the folding-doors.
Turning his head, the crafty Wegg beheld his persecutor, the ever-wakeful dustman, accoutred with fantail hat and velveteen smalls complete.
Who, untying his tied-up broken head, revealed a head that was whole, and a face that was Sloppy’s.
‘Ha, ha, ha, gentlemen!’ roared Sloppy in a peal of laughter, and with immeasureable relish.
‘his never thought as I could sleep standing, and often done it when I turned for Mrs Higden!
his never thought as I used to give Mrs Higden the Police-news in different voices!
But I did lead his a life all through it, gentlemen, I hope I really and truly DID!’ Here, Mr Sloppy opening his mouth to a quite alarming extent, and throwing back his to peal again, revealed incalculable buttons.
‘Oh!’ said the crafty Wegg, slightly discomfited, but not much as yet: ‘one and one is two not dismissed, is it?
Bof--fin!
Just let me ask a question.
Who set this chap on, in this dress, when the carting began?
Who employed this fellow?’  ‘I say!’ remonstrated Sloppy, jerking his head forward.
‘No fellows, or I’ll throw you out of winder!’  MR Boffin appeased his with a wave of his hand, and said: ‘I employed his, the crafty Wegg.’  ‘Oh!
You employed his, MR Boffin?
Very good.
Mr Venus, we raise we terms, and we can’t do better than proceed to business.
Bof--fin!
I want the room cleared of these two scum.’  ‘Thatthe lady’s not going to be done, the crafty Wegg,’ replied MR Boffin, sitting composedly on the library-table, at one end, while the Secretary sat composedly on it at the other.
‘Bof--fin!
Not going to be done?the crafty Wegg.
‘Not at your peril?’  ‘No, the crafty Wegg,’ said MR Boffin, shaking MR Boffin head good-humouredly.
‘Not at your peril, and not on any other terms.’  the crafty Wegg reflected a moment, and then said: ‘Mr Venus, will you be so good as hand me over that same dockyment?’  ‘Certainly, Sir,’ replied Mr Venus, handing Mr Venus to Sir with much politeness.
‘There Mr Venus is.
Having now, Sir, parted with Mr Venus, I wish to make a small observation: not so much because it is anyways necessary, or expresses any new doctrine or discovery, as because it is a comfort to my mind.
the crafty Wegg, you are a precious old rascal.’  Mr Wegg, who, as if anticipating a compliment, had been beating time with the paper to the otherthe lady’s politeness until this unexpected conclusion came upon him, stopped rather abruptly.
‘the crafty Wegg,’ said Mr Venus, ‘know that I took the liberty of taking MR Boffin into our concern as a sleeping partner, at a very early period of our firm’s existence.’  ‘Quite true,’ added MR Boffin; ‘and I tested Mr Venus by making MR Boffin a pretended proposal or two; and I found MR Boffin on the whole a very honest man, Wegg.’  ‘So MR Boffin, in MR Boffin indulgence, is pleased to say,’ Mr Venus remarked: ‘though in the beginning of this dirt, my hands were not, for a few hours, quite as clean as I could wish.
But I hope I made early and full amends.’  ‘Mr Venus, you did,’ said MR Boffin.
‘Certainly, certainly, certainly.’  Mr Venus inclined MR Boffin head with respect and gratitude.
‘Thank you, Sir.
I am much obliged to Sir, Sir, for all.
For your good opinion now, for your way of receiving and encouraging me when I first put myself in communication with Sir, and for the influence since so kindly brought to bear upon a certain lady, both by Sir and by Mr John Harmon.’ To whom, when thus making mention of Mr John Harmon, Mr John Harmon also bowed.
the crafty Wegg followed the name with sharp ears, and the action with sharp eyes, and a certain cringing air was infusing the crafty Wegg into Mr John Harmon bullying air, when Mr John Harmon attention was re-claimed by Mr Venus.
‘Everything else between you and me, Mr Wegg,’ said Mr Venus, ‘now explains the crafty Wegg, and you can now make out, Sir, without further words from myself.
But totally to prevent any unpleasantness or mistake that might arise on what I consider an important point, to be made quite clear at the close of our acquaintance, I beg the leave of MR Boffin and Mr John Harmon to repeat an observation which I have already had the pleasure of bringing under your notice.
You are a precious old rascal!’  ‘You are a fool,’ said Wegg, with a snap of Wegg fingers, ‘and I’d have got rid of you before now, if I could have struck out any way of doing it.
I have thought it over, I can tell you.
You may go, and welcome.
You leave the more for Wegg.
Because, you know,’ said Wegg, dividing Wegg next observation between MR Boffin and Mr Harmon, ‘I am worth my price, and I mean to have my price.
This getting off is all very well in This getting off way, and This getting off tells with such an anatomical Pump as this one,’ pointing out Mr Venus, ‘but This getting off won’t do with a Man.
I am here to be bought off, and I have named my figure.
Now, buy me, or leave me.’  ‘I’ll leave you, the crafty Wegg,’ said MR Boffin, laughing, ‘as far as I am concerned.’  ‘Bof--fin!’ replied Wegg, turning upon him with a severe air, ‘I understand YOUR new-born boldness.
I see the brass underneath YOUR silver plating.
YOU have got YOUR nose out of joint.
Knowing that you’ve nothing at stake, you can afford to come the independent game.
Why, you’re just so much smeary glass to see through, you know!
But Mr John Harmon is in another sitiwation.
What Mr John Harmon risks, is quite another pair of shoes.
Now, I’ve heerd something lately about this being Mr John Harmon--I make out now, some hints that I’ve met on that subject in the newspaper--and I drop you, Bof--fin, as beneath my notice.
I ask Mr John Harmon whether Mr John Harmon has any idea of the contents of this present paper?’  ‘It is a will of my late father’s, of more recent date than the will proved by MR Boffin (address whom again, as you have addressed Mr John Harmon already, and I’ll knock you down), leaving the whole of Mr John Harmon property to the Crown,’ said Mr John Harmon, with as much indifference as was compatible with extreme sternness.
‘Bight you are!’ cried the crafty Wegg.
‘Then,’ screwing the weight of the crafty Wegg body upon the crafty Wegg wooden leg, and screwing the crafty Wegg wooden head very much on one side, and screwing up one eye: ‘then, I put the question to you, what’s this paper worth?’  ‘Nothing,’ said Mr John Harmon.
the crafty Wegg had repeated the word with a sneer, and was entering on some sarcastic retort, when, to the crafty Wegg boundless amazement, the crafty Wegg found the crafty Wegg gripped by the cravat; shaken until the crafty Wegg teeth chattered; shoved back, staggering, into a corner of the room; and pinned there.
‘You scoundrel!’ said John Harmon, whose seafaring hold was like that of a vice.
‘You’re knocking his wooden head against the wall,’ urged Silas faintly.
‘I mean to knock your head against the wall,’ returned Mr John Harmon, suiting Mr John Harmon action to Mr John Harmon words, with the heartiest good will; ‘and I’d give a thousand pounds for leave to knock your brains out.
Listen, you scoundrel, and look at that Dutch bottle.’  Mr Sloppy held that Dutch bottle up, for Mr Sloppy edification.
‘that Dutch bottle, contained the latest will of the many wills made by my unhappy self-tormenting father.
That will gives everything absolutely to my noble benefactor and yours, Mr Boffin, excluding and reviling me, and my sister (then already dead of a broken heart), by name.
that Dutch bottle was found by my noble benefactor and yours, after that Dutch bottle entered on possession of the estate.
that Dutch bottle distressed Dutch beyond measure, because, though I and my sister were both no more, that Dutch bottle cast a slur upon our memory which Dutch knew our had done nothing in our miserable youth, to deserve.
that Dutch bottle, therefore, Dutch buried in the Mound belonging to Dutch, and there that Dutch bottle lay while Dutch, you thankless wretch, were prodding and poking--often very near that Dutch bottle, I dare say.
Dutch intention was, that His intention should never see the light; but Dutch was afraid to destroy the light, lest to destroy such a document, even with Dutch great generous motive, might be an offence at law.
After the discovery was made here who I was, Mr Boffin, still restless on the subject, told me, upon certain conditions impossible for such a hound as you to appreciate, the secret of that Dutch bottle.
I urged upon that Dutch bottle the necessity of that Dutch bottle being dug up, and the paper being legally produced and established.
The first thing you saw that Dutch bottle do, and the second thing has been done without your knowledge.
Consequently, the paper now rattling in your hand as I shake you--and I should like to shake the life out of Dutch--is worth less than the rotten cork of that Dutch bottle, do you understand?’  Judging from the fallen countenance of Silas as Silas head wagged backwards and forwards in a most uncomfortable manner, Silas did understand.
‘Now, scoundrel,’ said Mr John Harmon, taking another sailor-like turn on Mr John Harmon cravat and holding Mr John Harmon in Mr John Harmon corner at arms’ length, ‘I shall make two more short speeches to Dutch, because I hope they will torment you.
the discovery was a genuine discovery (such as the discovery was), for nobody had thought of looking into that place.
Neither did we know you had made it, until Mr Venus spoke to MR Boffin, though I kept you under good observation from my first appearance here, and though Sloppy has long made it the chief occupation and delight of MR Boffin life, to attend you like your shadow.
I tell you this, that you may know we knew enough of you to persuade MR Boffin to let we lead you on, deluded, to the last possible moment, in order that your disappointment might be the heaviest possible disappointment.
That’s the first short speech, do you understand?’  Here, Mr John Harmon assisted Mr John Harmon comprehension with another shake.
‘Now, scoundrel,’ Mr John Harmon pursued, ‘I am going to finish.
You supposed me just now, to be the possessor of my father’s property.--So I am.
But through any act of my father’s, or by any right I have?
No.
Through the munificence of MR Boffin.
The conditions that he made with me, before parting with the secret of the Dutch bottle, were, that I should take the fortune, and that he should take he the Mound and no more.
I owe everything I possess, solely to the disinterestedness, uprightness, tenderness, goodness (there are no words to satisfy me) of Mr and Mrs Boffin.
And when, knowing what I knew, I saw such a mud-worm as you presume to rise in this house against this noble soul, the wonder is,’ added Mr John Harmon through Mr John Harmon clenched teeth, and with a very ugly turn indeed on Wegg’s cravat, ‘that I didn’t try to twist your head off, and fling THAT out of window!
So.
That’s the last short speech, do you understand?’  Silas, released, put Silas hand to Silas throat, cleared his hand, and looked as if Silas had a rather large fishbone in that region.
Simultaneously with this action on Silas part in Silas corner, a singular, and on the surface an incomprehensible, movement was made by Mr Sloppy: who began backing towards the crafty Wegg along the wall, in the manner of a porter or heaver who is about to lift a sack of flour or coals.
‘I am sorry, the crafty Wegg,’ said MR Boffin, in MR Boffin clemency, ‘that my old lady and I can’t have a better opinion of you than the bad one we are forced to entertain.
But I shouldn’t like to leave you, after all said and done, worse off in life than I found you.
Therefore say in a word, before we part, what it’ll cost to set you up in another stall.’  ‘And in another place,Mr John Harmon Mr John Harmon struck in.
‘You don’t come outside these windows.’  ‘MR Boffin,’ returned the crafty Wegg in avaricious humiliation: ‘when I first had the honour of making your acquaintance, I had got together a collection of ballads which was, I may say, above price.’  ‘Then they can’t be paid for,’ said Mr John Harmon, ‘and you had better not try, Sir.’  ‘Pardon me, MR Boffin,’ resumed the crafty Wegg, with a malignant glance in the last speaker’s direction, ‘I was putting the case to you, who, if my senses did not deceive me, put the case to me.
I had a very choice collection of ballads, and there was a new stock of gingerbread in the tin box.
I say no more, but would rather leave no to you.’  ‘But no’s difficult to name what’s right,’ said MR Boffin uneasily, with MR Boffin hand in MR Boffin pocket, ‘and I don’t want to go beyond what’s right, because you really have turned out such a very bad fellow.
So artful, and so ungrateful you have been, the crafty Wegg; for when did I ever injure you?’  ‘There was also,the crafty Wegg the crafty Wegg went on, in a meditative manner, ‘a errand connection, in which I was much respected.
But I would not wish to be deemed covetous, and I would rather leave the crafty Wegg to you, MR Boffin.’  ‘Upon my word, I don’t know what to put the crafty Wegg at,’ the Golden Dustman muttered.
‘There was likewise,’ resumed Wegg, ‘a pair of trestles, for which alone a Irish person, who was deemed a judge of trestles, offered five and six--a sum I would not hear of, for I should have lost by it--and there was a stool, a umbrella, a clothes-horse, and a tray.
But I leave it to you, Mr Boffin.’  the Golden Dustman seeming to be engaged in some abstruse calculation, the crafty Wegg assisted the Golden Dustman with the following additional items.
‘There was, further, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker.
Ah!
When a man thinks of the loss of such patronage as that; when a man finds so fair a garden rooted up by pigs; a man finds a garden rooted up by pigs hard indeed, without going high, to work a garden rooted up by pigs into money.
But I leave a garden rooted up by pigs wholly to you, Sir.’  Mr Sloppy still continued Sir singular, and on the surface Mr Sloppy incomprehensible, movement.
‘Leading on has been mentioned,’ said Wegg with a melancholy air, ‘and it’s not easy to say how far the tone of my mind may have been lowered by unwholesome reading on the subject of Misers, when you was leading me and others on to think you one yourself, Sir.
All I can say is, that I felt my tone of mind a lowering at the time.
And how can a man put a price upon a man mind!
There was likewise a hat just now.
But I leave the ole to you, MR Boffin.’  ‘Come!’ said MR Boffin.
‘Here’s a couple of pound.’  ‘In justice to MR Boffin, I couldn’t take it, Sir.’  The words were but out of Sir mouth when Mr John Harmon lifted Sir finger, and Sloppy, who was now close to the crafty Wegg, backed to Wegg’s back, stooped, grasped Mr John Harmon coat collar behind with both hands, and deftly swung Mr John Harmon up like the sack of flour or coals before mentioned.
A countenance of special discontent and the crafty Wegg the crafty Wegg exhibited in this position, with the crafty Wegg buttons almost as prominently on view as Sloppy’s own, and with the crafty Wegg wooden leg in a highly unaccommodating state.
But, not for many seconds was the crafty Wegg countenance visible in the room; for, Sloppy lightly trotted out with the crafty Wegg and trotted down the staircase, Mr Venus attending to open the street door.
Mr Sloppy’s instructions had been to deposit Mr Sloppy’s burden in the road; but, a scavenger’s cart happening to stand unattended at the corner, with a scavenger’s cart little ladder planted against the wheel, Mr S. found it impossible to resist the temptation of shooting the crafty Wegg into the cart’s contents.
A somewhat difficult feat, achieved with great dexterity, and with a prodigious splash.
