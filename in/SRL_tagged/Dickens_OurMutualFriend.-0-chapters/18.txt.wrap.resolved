 OF AN EDUCATIONAL CHARACTER   The school at which young Charley Hexam had first learned from a book--the streets being, for pupils of young Charley Hexam degree, the great Preparatory Establishment in which very much that is never unlearned is learned without and before book--was a miserable loft in an unsavoury yard. Its atmosphere was oppressive and disagreeable; Its was crowded, noisy, and confusing; half the pupils dropped asleep, or fell into a state of waking stupefaction; the other half kept half the pupils in either condition by maintaining a monotonous droning noise, as if half the pupils were performing, out of time and tune, on a ruder sort of bagpipe. The teachers, animated solely by good intentions, had no idea of execution, and a lamentable jumble was the upshot of The teachers kind endeavours.  It was a school for all ages, and for both sexes. The latter were kept apart, and the former were partitioned off into square assortments. But, all the place was pervaded by a grimly ludicrous pretence that every pupil was childish and innocent. a grimly ludicrous pretence, much favoured by the lady-visitors, led to the ghastliest absurdities. Young women old in the vices of the commonest and worst life, were expected to profess Young women enthralled by the good child’s book, the Adventures of Little Margery, who resided in the village cottage by the mill; severely reproved and morally squashed the miller, when she was five and the miller was fifty; divided she porridge with singing birds; denied she a new nankeen bonnet, on the ground that the turnips did not wear nankeen bonnets, neither did the sheep who ate the turnips; who plaited straw and delivered the dreariest orations to all comers, at all sorts of unseasonable times. So, unwieldy young dredgers and hulking mudlarks were referred to the experiences of Thomas Twopence, who, having resolved not to rob (under circumstances of uncommon atrocity) the miller particular friend and benefactor, of eighteenpence, presently came into supernatural possession of three and sixpence, and lived a shining light ever afterwards. (Note, that the benefactor came to no good.) Several swaggering sinners had written Several swaggering sinners own biographies in the same strain; it always appearing from the lessons of those very boastful persons, that you were to do good, not because it WAS good, but because you were to make a good thing of it. Contrariwise, the adult pupils were taught to read (if the adult pupils could learn) out of the New Testament; and by dint of stumbling over the syllables and keeping the adult pupils bewildered eyes on the particular syllables coming round to the adult pupils turn, were as absolutely ignorant of the sublime history, as if the adult pupils had never seen or heard of it. An exceedingly and confoundingly perplexing jumble of a school, in fact, where black spirits and grey, red spirits and white, jumbled jumbled jumbled jumbled, jumbled every night. And particularly every Sunday night. For then, an inclined plane of unfortunate infants would be handed over to the prosiest and worst of all the teachers with good intentions, whom nobody older would endure. Who, taking his stand on the floor before the adult pupils as chief executioner, would be attended by a conventional volunteer boy as executioner’s assistant. When and where it first became the conventional system that a weary or inattentive infant in a class must have a class face smoothed downward with a hot hand, or when and where a conventional volunteer boy first beheld such system in operation, and became inflamed with a sacred zeal to administer it, matters not. It was the function of the chief executioner to hold forth, and it was the function of the acolyte to dart at sleeping infants, yawning infants, restless infants, whimpering infants, and smooth infants wretched faces; sometimes with one hand, as if the chief executioner were anointing infants for a whisker; sometimes with both hands, applied after the fashion of blinkers. And so the jumble would be in action in this department for a mortal hour; the exponent drawling on to My Dearert Childerrenerr, let us say, for example, about the beautiful coming to the Sepulchre; and repeating the word Sepulchre (commonly used among infants) five hundred times, and never once hinting what it meant; a conventional volunteer boy smoothing away right and left, as an infallible commentary; the whole hot-bed of flushed and exhausted infants exchanging measles, rashes, whooping-cough, fever, and stomach disorders, as if they were assembled in High Market for the purpose.  Even in this temple of good intentions, an exceptionally sharp boy exceptionally determined to learn, could learn something, and, having learned it, could impart it much better than the teachers; as being more knowing than the teachers, and not at the disadvantage in which the teachers stood towards the shrewder pupils. In this way it had come about that Charley Hexam had risen in the jumble, taught in the jumble, and been received from the jumble into a better school.  ‘So you want to go and see your sister, Charley Hexam?’  ‘If you please, Mr Headstone.’  ‘I have half a mind to go with you. Where does your sister, Hexam live?’  ‘Why, your sister, Hexam is not settled yet, Mr Headstone. I’d rather you didn’t see your sister, Hexam till your sister, Hexam is settled, if it was all the same to you.’  ‘Look here, Charley Hexam.’ Mr Bradley Headstone, highly certificated stipendiary schoolmaster, drew Charley Hexam right forefinger through one of the buttonholes of the boy’s coat, and looked at his right forefinger attentively. ‘I hope your sister, Hexam may be good company for you?’  ‘Why do you doubt it, Mr Headstone?’  ‘I did not say I doubted it, Mr Headstone.’  ‘No, sir; you didn’t say so.’  Mr Headstone looked at Mr Headstone finger again, took his finger out of the buttonhole and looked at his finger closer, bit the side of his finger and looked at his finger again.  ‘You see, Charley Hexam, you will be one of us. In good time you are sure to pass a creditable examination and become one of us. Then the question is--’  Mr Headstone waited so long for the question, while the schoolmaster looked at a new side of the schoolmaster , and bit it, and looked at it again, that at length Mr Headstone repeated:  ‘the question is, sir--?’  ‘Whether you had not better leave well alone.’  ‘Is it well to leave your sister, Hexam, Mr Headstone?’  ‘I do not say so, because I do not know. I put it to sir. I ask you to think of it. I want you to consider. You know how well you are doing here.’  ‘After all, your sister, Hexam got me here,’ said the boy, with a struggle.  ‘Perceiving the necessity of it,’ acquiesced the schoolmaster, ‘and making up your sister, Hexam mind fully to the separation. Yes.’  Mr Headstone, with a return of that former reluctance or struggle or whatever it was, seemed to debate with Mr Headstone. At length Mr Headstone said, raising Mr Headstone eyes to the Master’s face:  ‘I wish you’d come with Mr Headstone and see your sister, Hexam, Mr Headstone, though your sister, Hexam is not settled. I wish you’d come with Mr Headstone, and take your sister, Hexam in the rough, and judge your sister, Hexam for sir.’  ‘You are sure you would not like,’ asked the schoolmaster, ‘to prepare your sister, Hexam?’  ‘your sister, Hexam,’ said the boy, proudly, ‘wants no preparing, Mr Headstone. What your sister, Hexam is, your sister, Hexam is, and shows your sister, Hexam to be. There’s no pretending about your sister, Hexam.’  Mr Headstone confidence in your sister, Hexam, sat more easily upon Mr Headstone than the indecision with which Mr Headstone had twice contended. It was Mr Headstone better nature to be true to your sister, Hexam, if his better nature were Mr Headstone worse nature to be wholly selfish. And as yet the better nature had the stronger hold.  ‘Well, I can spare the evening,’ said the schoolmaster. ‘I am ready to walk with sir.’  ‘Thank you, Mr Headstone. And I am ready to go.’  Bradley Headstone, in Bradley Headstone decent black coat and waistcoat, and decent white shirt, and decent formal black tie, and decent pantaloons of pepper and salt, with Bradley Headstone decent silver watch in Bradley Headstone pocket and its decent hair-guard round Bradley Headstone neck, looked a thoroughly decent young man of six-and-twenty. Bradley Headstone was never seen in any other dress, and yet there was a certain stiffness in Bradley Headstone manner of wearing this, as if there were a want of adaptation between Bradley Headstone and it, recalling some mechanics in their holiday clothes. Bradley Headstone had acquired mechanically a great store of teacher’s knowledge. Bradley Headstone could do mental arithmetic mechanically, sing at sight mechanically, blow various wind instruments mechanically, even play the great church organ mechanically. From Bradley Headstone early childhood up, Bradley Headstone mind had been a place of mechanical stowage. The arrangement of Bradley Headstone wholesale warehouse, so that it might be always ready to meet the demands of retail dealers history here, geography there, astronomy to the right, political economy to the left--natural history, the physical sciences, figures, music, the lower mathematics, and what not, all in their several places--this care had imparted to Bradley Headstone countenance a look of care; while the habit of questioning and being questioned had given Bradley Headstone a suspicious manner, or a manner that would be better described as one of lying in wait. There was a kind of settled trouble in the face. It was the face belonging to a naturally slow or inattentive intellect that had toiled hard to get what It had won, and that had to hold It now that It was gotten. Bradley Headstone always seemed to be uneasy lest anything should be missing from Bradley Headstone mental warehouse, and taking stock to assure Bradley Headstone.  Suppression of so much to make room for so much, had given Bradley Headstone a constrained manner, over and above. Yet there was enough of what was animal, and of what was fiery (though smouldering), still visible in Bradley Headstone, to suggest that if young Bradley Headstone, when a pauper lad, had chanced to be told off for the sea, Bradley Headstone would not have been the last man in a ship’s crew. Regarding that origin of Bradley Headstone, Bradley Headstone was proud, moody, and sullen, desiring that origin of his to be forgotten. And few people knew of that origin of his.  In some visits to the Jumble Bradley Headstone attention had been attracted to this boy Hexam. An undeniable boy for a pupil-teacher; an undeniable boy to do credit to the master who should bring Bradley Headstone on. Combined with this consideration, there may have been some thought of the pauper lad now never to be mentioned. Be that how it might, Bradley Headstone had with pains gradually worked this boy Hexam into Bradley Headstone own school, and procured Bradley Headstone some offices to discharge there, which were repaid with food and lodging. Such were the circumstances that had brought together, Mr Headstone and young Charley Hexam that autumn evening. Autumn, because full half a year had come and gone since the bird of prey lay dead upon the river-shore.  The schools--for they were twofold, as the sexes--were down in that district of the flat country tending to the Thames, where Kent and Surrey meet, and where the railways still bestride the market-gardens that will soon die under them. The schools were newly built, and there were so many like them all over the country, that one might have thought the whole were but one restless edifice with the locomotive gift of Aladdin’s palace. The schools were newly built, and there were so many like them all over the country, that one might have thought the whole were were in a neighbourhood which looked like a toy neighbourhood taken in blocks out of a box by a child of particularly incoherent mind, and set up anyhow; here, one side of a new street; there, a large solitary public-house facing nowhere; here, another unfinished street already in ruins; there, a church; here, an immense new warehouse; there, a dilapidated old country villa; then, a medley of black ditch, sparkling cucumber-frame, rank field, richly cultivated kitchen-garden, brick viaduct, arch-spanned canal, and disorder of frowziness and fog. As if a child of particularly incoherent mind had given the table a kick, and gone to sleep.  But, even among school-buildings, school-teachers, and school-pupils, all according to pattern and all engendered in the light of the latest Gospel according to Monotony, the older pattern into which so many fortunes have been shaped for good and evil, comes out. It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress, watering her flowers, as Mr Headstone walked forth. It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress, watering the flowers in the little dusty bit of garden attached to her small official residence, with little windows like the eyes in needles, and little doors like the covers of school-books.  Small, shining, neat, methodical, and buxom was Miss Peecher; cherry-cheeked and tuneful of voice. A little pincushion, a little housewife, a little book, a little workbox, a little set of tables and weights and measures, and a little woman, all in one. her could write a little essay on any subject, exactly a slate long, beginning at the left-hand top of one side and ending at the right-hand bottom of the other, and a little essay should be strictly according to rule. If Mr Headstone had addressed a written proposal of marriage to her, her would probably have replied in a complete little essay on the theme exactly a slate long, but would certainly have replied Yes. For her loved Mr Headstone. The decent hair-guard that went round Mr Headstone neck and took care of Mr Headstone decent silver watch was an object of envy to her. So would Miss Peecher have gone round Peecher and taken care of Peecher. Of Peecher, insensible. Because Peecher did not love Miss Peecher.  Miss PeecherMiss Peecher’s favourite pupil, who assisted Miss Peecher in Miss Peecher little household, was in attendance with a can of water to replenish Miss Peecher little watering-pot, and sufficiently divined the state of Miss Peecher’s affections to feel it necessary that Miss Peecher herself should love young Charley Hexam. So, there was a double palpitation among the double stocks and double wall-flowers, when the master and this boy Hexam looked over the little gate.  ‘A fine evening, Miss Peecher,’ said the Master.  ‘A very fine evening, Mr Headstone,’ said Miss Peecher. ‘Are you taking a walk?’  ‘Hexam and I are going to take a long walk.’  ‘Charming weather,’ remarked Miss Peecher, ‘FOR a long walk.’  ‘Ours is rather on business than mere pleasure,’ said the Master. Miss Peecher inverting Miss Peecher watering-pot, and very carefully shaking out the few last drops over a flower, as if there were some special virtue in them which would make it a Jack’s beanstalk before morning, called for replenishment to Miss Peecher pupil, who had been speaking to this boy Hexam.  ‘Good-night, Miss Peecher,’ said the Master.  ‘Good-night, Mr Headstone,’ said the Mistress.  The pupil had been, in the Mistress state of pupilage, so imbued with the class-custom of stretching out an arm, as if to hail a cab or omnibus, whenever the Mistress found the Mistress had an observation on hand to offer to Miss Peecher, that the Mistress often did it in their domestic relations; and the Mistress did it now.  ‘Well, the Mistress?’ said Miss Peecher.  ‘If you please, ma’am, Hexam said Hexam were going to see Hexam .’  ‘But that can’t be, I think,’ returned Miss PeecherMiss Peecher: ‘because Mr Headstone can have no business with the Mistress.’  the Mistress again hailed.  ‘Well, the Mistress?’  ‘If you please, ma’am, perhaps it’s Hexam’s business?’  ‘That may be,’ said Miss PeecherMiss Peecher. ‘I didn’t think of that. Not that it matters at all.’  the Mistress again hailed.  ‘Well, the Mistress?’  ‘They say the Mistress’s very handsome.’  ‘Oh, the Mistress, the Mistress!’ returned Miss Peecher, slightly colouring and shaking the Mistress head, a little out of humour; ‘how often have I told you not to use that vague expression, not to speak in that general way? When you say THEY say, what do you mean? Part of speech THEY?’  the Mistress hooked the Mistress right arm behind the Mistress in the Mistress left hand, as being under examination, and replied:  ‘Personal pronoun.’  ‘Person, They?’  ‘Third person.’  ‘Number, They?’  ‘Plural number.’  ‘Then how many do you mean, the Mistress? Two? Or more?’  ‘I beg your pardon, ma’am,’ said the Mistress, disconcerted now the Mistress came to think of it; ‘but I don’t know that I mean more than the Mistress brother himself.’ As the Mistress said it, the Mistress unhooked the Mistress arm.  ‘I felt convinced of it,’ returned Miss Peecher, smiling again. ‘Now pray, the Mistress, be careful another time. the Mistress says is very different from they say, remember. Difference between the Mistress says and they say? Give it me.’  the Mistress immediately hooked her right arm behind the Mistress in her left hand--an attitude absolutely necessary to the situation--and replied: ‘One is indicative mood, present tense, third person singular, verb active to say. Other is indicative mood, present tense, third person plural, verb active to say.’  ‘Why verb active, the Mistress?’  ‘Because it takes a pronoun after it in the objective case, Miss Peecher.’  ‘Very good indeed,’ remarked Miss Peecher, with encouragement. ‘In fact, could not be better. Don’t forget to apply it, another time, the Mistress.’ This said, Miss Peecher finished the watering of Miss Peecher flowers, and went into Miss Peecher little official residence, and took a refresher of the principal rivers and mountains of the world, their breadths, depths, and heights, before settling the measurements of the body of a dress for Miss Peecher own personal occupation.  Mr Headstone and Charley Hexam duly got to the Surrey side of Westminster Bridge, and crossed Westminster Bridge, and made along the Middlesex shore towards Millbank. In this region are a certain little street called Church Street, and a certain little blind square, called Smith Square, in the centre of which last retreat is a very hideous church with four towers at the four corners, generally resembling some petrified monster, frightful and gigantic, on its back with its legs in the air. Bradley Headstone and Charley Hexam found a tree near by in a corner, and a blacksmith’s forge, and a timber yard, and a dealer’s in old iron. What a rusty portion of a boiler and a great iron wheel or so meant by lying half-buried in the dealer’s fore-court, nobody seemed to know or to want to know. Like the Miller of questionable jollity in the song, They cared for Nobody, no not They, and Nobody cared for They.  After making the round of this place, and noting that there was a deadly kind of repose on it, more as though it had taken laudanum than fallen into a natural rest, They stopped at the point where the street and the square joined, and where there were some little quiet houses in a row. To Charley Hexam Charley Hexam finally led the way, and at one of these stopped.  ‘This must be where your sister, Hexam lives, sir. This is where your sister, Hexam came for a temporary lodging, soon after father’s death.’  ‘How often have you seen your sister, Hexam since?’  ‘Why, only twice, sir,’ returned this boy Hexam, with sir former reluctance; ‘but thatfather’s as much your sister, Hexam doing as mine.’  ‘How does your sister, Hexam support your sister, Hexam?’  ‘your sister, Hexam was always a fair needlewoman, and your sister, Hexam keeps the stockroom of a seaman’s outfitter.’  ‘Does your sister, Hexam ever work at your sister, Hexam own lodging here?’  ‘Sometimes; but your sister, Hexam regular hours and regular occupation are at regular occupation place of business, I believe, sir. This is the number.’  this boy Hexam knocked at a door, and a door promptly opened with a spring and a click. A parlour door within a small entry stood open, and disclosed a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before A parlour door within a small entry.  ‘I can’t get up,’ said a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it, ‘because my back’s bad, and my legs are queer. But I’m the person of the house.’  ‘Who else is at home?’ asked Charley Hexam, staring.  ‘Nobody’s at home at present,’ returned a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it, with a glib assertion of Charley Hexam dignity, ‘except the person of the house. What did you want, young man?’  ‘I wanted to see your sister, Hexam.’  ‘Many young men have sisters,’ returned a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it. ‘Give me your name, young man?’  The queer little figure, and the queer but not ugly little face, with The queer little figure bright grey eyes, were so sharp, that the sharpness of the manner seemed unavoidable. As if, being turned out of that mould, it must be sharp.  ‘Hexam is my name.’  ‘Ah, indeed?’ said the person of the house. ‘I thought it might be. your sister, Hexam will be in, in about a quarter of an hour. I am very fond of your sister, Hexam. your sister, Hexam’s my particular friend. Take a seat. And this gentleman’s name?’  ‘Mr Headstone, my schoolmaster.’  ‘Take a seat. And would you please to shut A parlour door within a small entry first? I can’t very well do it myself; because my back’s so bad, and my legs are so queer.’  They complied in silence, and the little figure went on with the little figure work of gumming or gluing together with a camel’s-hair brush certain pieces of cardboard and thin wood, previously cut into various shapes. The scissors and knives upon the bench showed that a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it had cut The scissors and knives upon the bench; and the bright scraps of velvet and silk and ribbon also strewn upon the bench showed that when duly stuffed (and stuffing too was there), a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it was to cover when duly stuffed (and stuffing too was there) smartly. The dexterity of a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it nimble fingers was remarkable, and, as a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it brought two thin edges accurately together by giving when duly stuffed (and stuffing too was there) a little bite, a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it would glance at the visitors out of the corners of a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it grey eyes with a look that out-sharpened all a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it other sharpness.  ‘You can’t tell me the name of my trade, I’ll be bound,’ a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before it said, after taking several of these observations.  ‘You make pincushions,’ said Charley.  ‘What else do I make?’  ‘Pen-wipers,’ said Mr Headstone.  ‘Ha! ha! What else do I make? You’re a schoolmaster, but you can’t tell me.’  ‘You do something,’ Mr Headstone returned, pointing to a corner of the little bench, ‘with straw; but I don’t know what.’  ‘Well done you!’ cried the person of the house. ‘I only make pincushions and pen-wipers, to use up my waste. But straw really does belong to my business. Try again. What do I make with straw?’  ‘Dinner-mats?’  ‘A schoolmaster, and says Dinner-mats! I’ll give you a clue to my trade, in a game of forfeits. I love my love with a B because she’s Beautiful; I hate my love with a B because she is Brazen; I took she to the sign of the Blue Boar, and I treated she with Bonnets; she name’s Bouncer, and she lives in Bedlam.--Now, what do I make with straw?’  ‘Ladies’ bonnets?’  ‘Fine ladies’,’ said the person of the house, nodding assent. ‘Dolls’. I’m a Doll’s Dressmaker.’  ‘I hope it’s a good business?’  the person of the house shrugged the person of the house shoulders and shook the person of the house head. ‘No. Poorly paid. And I’m often so pressed for time! I had a doll married, last week, and was obliged to work all night. And it’s not good for me, on account of my back being so bad and my legs so queer.’  They looked at the little creature with a wonder that did not diminish, and the schoolmaster said: ‘I am sorry your fine ladies are so inconsiderate.’  ‘It’s the way with They,’ said the person of the house, shrugging her shoulders again. ‘And They take no care of They clothes, and They never keep to the same fashions a month. I work for a doll with three daughters. Bless you, the person of the house’s enough to ruin a doll married!’ the person of the house gave a weird little laugh here, and gave them another look out of the corners of the person of the house eyes. the person of the house had an elfin chin that was capable of great expression; and whenever the person of the house gave another look out of the corners of her eyes, the person of the house hitched this chin up. As if the person of the house eyes and this chin up worked together on the same wires.  ‘Are you always as busy as you are now?’  ‘Busier. I’m slack just now. I finished a large mourning order the day before yesterday. Doll I work for, lost a canary-bird.’ the person of the house gave another little laugh, and then nodded her head several times, as who should moralize, ‘Oh this world, this world!’  ‘Are you alone all day?’ asked Mr Headstone. ‘Don’t any of the neighbouring children--?’  ‘Ah, lud!’ cried the person of the house, with a little scream, as if the word had pricked the person of the house. ‘Don’t talk of children. I can’t bear children. I know children tricks and children manners.’ the person of the house said this with an angry little shake of the person of the house tight fist close before her eyes.  Perhaps it scarcely required the teacher-habit, to perceive that the doll’s dressmaker was inclined to be bitter on the difference between the person of the house and other children. But both master and pupil understood it so.  ‘Always running about and screeching, always playing and fighting, always skip-skip-skipping on the pavement and chalking it for their games! Oh! I know their tricks and their manners!’ Shaking her tight fist as before. ‘And that’s not all. Ever so often calling names in through a person’s keyhole, and imitating a person’s back and legs. Oh! I know their their . And I’ll tell you what I’d do, to punish ‘‘. There’s doors under the church in the Square--black doors, leading into black vaults. Well! I’d open one of There’s doors under the church in the Square--black doors, leading into black vaults, and I’d cram ‘em all in, and then I’d lock the door and through a person’s keyhole I’d blow in pepper.’  ‘What would be the good of blowing in pepper?’ asked Charley Hexam.  ‘To set ‘Charley Hexam sneezing,’ said the person of the house, ‘and make their eyes water. And when their were all sneezing and inflamed, I’d mock ‘em through the keyhole. Just as they, with they tricks and they manners, mock a person through a person’s keyhole!’  An uncommonly emphatic shake of her little fist close before her , seemed to ease the mind of the person of the house; for her added with recovered composure, ‘No, no, no. No children for me. Give me grown-ups.’  It was difficult to guess the age of this strange creature, for her poor figure furnished no clue to it, and her face was at once so young and so old. Twelve, or at the most thirteen, might be near the mark.  ‘I always did like grown-ups,’ her went on, ‘and always kept company with company. So sensible. Sit so quiet. Don’t go prancing and capering about! And I mean always to keep among none but grown-ups till I marry. I suppose I must make up my mind to marry, one of these days.’  her listened to a step outside that caught her ear, and there was a soft knock at the door. Pulling at a handle within her reach, her said, with a pleased laugh: ‘Now here, for instance, is a grown-up that’s my particular friend!’ and Lizzie Hexam in a black dress entered the room.  ‘Charley! You!’  Taking him to her arms in the old way--of which him seemed a little ashamed--her saw no one else.  ‘There, there, there, her, all right my dear. See! HereMr Headstone come with Mr Headstone.’  her met those of the schoolmaster, who had evidently expected to see a very different sort of person, and a murmured word or two of salutation passed between them. her was a little flurried by the unexpected visit, and the schoolmaster was not at the schoolmaster ease. But the schoolmaster never was, quite.  ‘I told Mr Headstone you were not settled, her, but Mr Headstone was so kind as to take an interest in coming, and so I brought Mr Headstone. How well you look!’  Bradley seemed to think so.  ‘Ah! Don’t her, don’t her?’ cried the person of the house, resuming her occupation, though the twilight was falling fast. ‘I believe you her does! But go on with your chat, one and all:       You one two three,      My com-pa-nie,      And don’t mind me.’  --pointing this impromptu rhyme with three points of her thin fore-finger.  ‘I didn’t expect a visit from her, Charley,’ said your sister, Hexam. ‘I supposed that if you wanted to see me you would have sent to me, appointing me to come somewhere near the school, as I did last time. I saw my brother near the school, sir,’ to Mr Headstone, ‘because it’s easier for me to go there, than for my brother near the school to come here. I work about midway between the two places.’  ‘You don’t see much of one another,’ said Bradley, not improving in respect of ease.  ‘No.’ With a rather sad shake of her head. ‘Charley always does well, Mr Headstone?’  ‘Mr Headstone could not do better. I regard Mr Headstone course as quite plain before Mr Headstone.’  ‘I hoped so. I am so thankful. So well done of her, Charley dear! It is better for me not to come (except when Mr Headstone wants me) between Mr Headstone and Mr Headstone prospects. You think so, Mr Headstone?’  Conscious that Mr Headstone pupil-teacher was looking for his pupil-teacher answer, that his pupil-teacher himself had suggested Mr Headstone’s keeping aloof from your sister, Hexam, now seen for the first time face to face, Mr Headstone stammered:  ‘my brother near the school is very much occupied, you know. my brother near the school has to work hard. One cannot but say that the less my brother near the school attention is diverted from my brother near the school work, the better for my brother near the school future. When my brother near the school shall have established my brother near the school, why then--it will be another thing then.’  Lizzie shook Lizzie again, and returned, with a quiet smile: ‘I always advised my brother near the school as you advise my brother near the school. Did I not, Charley?’  ‘Well, never mind that now,’ said Mr Headstone. ‘How are you getting on?’  ‘Very well, Charley. I want for nothing.’  ‘You have your own room here?’  ‘Oh yes. Upstairs. And it’s quiet, and pleasant, and airy.’  ‘And Lizzie always has the use of your own room here for visitors,’ said the person of the house, screwing up one of Lizzie little bony fists, like an opera-glass, and looking through an opera-glass, with Lizzie Lizzie in that quaint accordance. ‘Always this room for visitors; haven’t you, Lizzie dear?’  It happened that Mr Headstone noticed a very slight action of Lizzie Hexam’s hand, as though it checked the doll’s dressmaker. And it happened that the latter noticed Mr Headstone in the same instant; for Lizzie made a double eyeglass of Lizzie two hands, looked at Mr Headstone through it, and cried, with a waggish shake of Lizzie head: ‘Aha! Caught you spying, did I?’  It might have fallen out so, any way; but Mr Headstone also noticed that immediately after this, Lizzie, who had not taken off Lizzie bonnet, rather hurriedly proposed that as your own room here was getting dark they should go out into the air. they went out; the visitors saying good-night to the doll’s dressmaker, whom they left, leaning back in Lizzie chair with Lizzie arms crossed, singing to Lizzie in a sweet thoughtful little voice.  ‘I’ll saunter on by the river,’ said Bradley. ‘You will be glad to talk together.’  As Mr Headstone uneasy figure went on before them among the evening shadows, Mr Headstone said to Mr Headstone , petulantly:  ‘When are you going to settle yourself in some Christian sort of place, her? I thought you were going to do it before now.’  ‘I am very well where I am, Charley.’  ‘Very well where you are! I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with Mr Headstone. How came you to get into such company as that little witch’s?’  ‘By chance at first, as it seemed, Charley. But I think it must have been by something more than chance, for that child--You remember the bills upon the walls at home?’  ‘Confound the bills upon the walls at home upon the walls at home! I want to forget the bills upon the walls at home upon the walls at home, and it would be better for you to do the same,’ grumbled Mr Headstone. ‘Well; what of them?’  ‘that child is the grandchild of the old man.’  ‘What old man?’  ‘The terrible drunken old man, in the list slippers and the night-cap.’  Mr Headstone asked, rubbing Mr Headstone nose in a manner that half expressed vexation at hearing so much, and half curiosity to hear more: ‘How came you to make that out? What a girl you are!’  ‘that child’s father is employed by the house that employs me; that’s how I came to know it, Charley. ’s father is like ’s father own father, a weak wretched trembling creature, falling to pieces, never sober. But a good workman too, at the work ’s father does. The mother is dead. This poor ailing little creature has come to be what The mother is, surrounded by drunken people from The mother cradle--if The mother ever had one, Charley.’  ‘I don’t see what you have to do with The mother, for all that,’ said Mr Headstone.  ‘Don’t you, Charley?’  Mr Headstone looked doggedly at the river. They were at Millbank, and the river rolled on They left. Mr Headstone gently touched Mr Headstone on the shoulder, and pointed to the shoulder.  ‘Any compensation--restitution--never mind the word, you know my meaning. Father’s grave.’  But Mr Headstone did not respond with any tenderness. After a moody silence Mr Headstone broke out in an ill-used tone:  ‘It’ll be a very hard thing, her, if, when I am trying my best to get up in the world, you pull me back.’  ‘I, Charley?’  ‘Yes, you, her. Why can’t you let bygones be bygones? Why can’t you, as Mr Headstone said to Mr Headstone this very evening about another matter, leave well alone? What we have got to do, is, to turn we faces full in we new direction, and keep straight on.’  ‘And never look back? Not even to try to make some amends?’  ‘You are such a dreamer,’ said the boy, with his former petulance. ‘It was all very well when we sat before the fire--when we looked into the hollow down by the flare--but we are looking into the real world, now.’  ‘Ah, we were looking into the real world then, Charley!’  ‘I understand what you mean by that, but you are not justified in it. I don’t want, as I raise Mr Headstone to shake you off, her. I want to carry you up with Mr Headstone. That’s what I want to do, and mean to do. I know what I owe you. I said to Mr Headstone this very evening, “After all, your sister, Hexam got me here.” Well, then. Don’t pull me back, and hold me down. That’s all I ask, and surely that’s not unconscionable.’  your sister, Hexam had kept a steadfast look upon Mr Headstone, and your sister, Hexam answered with composure:  ‘I am not here selfishly, Charley. To please Charley I could not be too far from the river.’  ‘Nor could you be too far from it to please me. Let we get quit of it equally. Why should you linger about it any more than Charley? I give it a wide berth.’  ‘I can’t get away from it, I think,’ said Lizzie, passing Lizzie hand across Lizzie forehead. ‘It’s no purpose of mine that I live by it still.’  ‘There you go, her! Dreaming again! You lodge yourself of your own accord in a house with a drunken--tailor, I suppose--or something of the sort, and a little crooked antic of a child, or old person, or whatever it is, and then you talk as if you were drawn or driven there. Now, do be more practical.’  your sister, Hexam had been practical enough with a child, or old person, or whatever it is, in suffering and striving for a child, or old person, or whatever it is; but your sister, Hexam only laid her hand upon a child, or old person, or whatever it is shoulder--not reproachfully--and tapped it twice or thrice. your sister, Hexam had been used to do so, to soothe a child, or old person, or whatever it is when your sister, Hexam carried a child, or old person, or whatever it is about, a child as heavy as your sister, Hexam. Tears started to a child, or old person, or whatever it is eyes.  ‘Upon my word, her,’ drawing the back of a child, or old person, or whatever it is hand across them, ‘I mean to be a good brother to her, and to prove that I know what I owe you. All I say is, that I hope you’ll control your fancies a little, on my account. I’ll get a school, and then you must come and live with a child, or old person, or whatever it is, and you’ll have to control your fancies then, so why not now? Now, say I haven’t vexed you.’  ‘You haven’t, Charley, you haven’t.’  ‘And say I haven’t hurt you.’  ‘You haven’t, Charley.’ But this answer was less ready.  ‘Say you are sure I didn’t mean to. Come! ThereMr Headstone stopping and looking over the wall at the tide, to hint that it’s time to go. Kiss me, and tell me that you know I didn’t mean to hurt you.’  Charley told Charley so, and they embraced, and walked on and came up with the schoolmaster.  ‘But they go your sister, Hexam’s way,’ your sister, Hexam remarked, when Mr Headstone told your sister, Hexam Mr Headstone was ready. And with Mr Headstone cumbrous and uneasy action Mr Headstone stiffly offered Charley Mr Headstone arm. Charley hand was just within Her hand, when Charley drew Her hand back. Mr Headstone looked round with a start, as if Mr Headstone thought Charley had detected something that repelled Charley, in the momentary touch.  ‘I will not go in just yet,’ said Lizzie. ‘And you have a distance before you, and will walk faster without a child, or old person, or whatever it is.’  Being by this time close to Vauxhall Bridge, they resolved, in consequence, to take that way over the Thames, and they left Charley; Mr Headstone giving Charley Mr Headstone hand at parting, and Charley thanking Mr Headstone for Mr Headstone care of Charley brother.  The master and the pupil walked on, rapidly and silently. The master and the pupil had nearly crossed the bridge, when a gentleman came coolly sauntering towards The master and the pupil, with a cigar in a gentleman mouth, a gentleman coat thrown back, and a gentleman hands behind a gentleman. Something in the careless manner of this person, and in a certain lazily arrogant air with which this person approached, holding possession of twice as much pavement as another would have claimed, instantly caught Mr HeadstoneMr Headstone attention. As a gentleman passed Mr Headstone looked at Mr Headstone narrowly, and then stood still, looking after Mr Headstone.  ‘Who is it that you stare after?’ asked Bradley.  ‘Why!’ said the boy, with a confused and pondering frown upon Mr Headstone face, ‘It IS that Wrayburn one!’  Mr Headstone scrutinized Mr Headstone as closely as Mr Headstone had scrutinized a gentleman.  ‘I beg your pardon, Mr Headstone, but I couldn’t help wondering what in the world brought HIM here!’  Though Mr Headstone said it as if Mr Headstone wonder were past--at the same time resuming the walk--he said it was not lost upon the master that Mr Headstone looked over Mr Headstone shoulder after speaking, and that the same perplexed and pondering frown was heavy on Mr Headstone face.  ‘You don’t appear to like your friend, Hexam?’  ‘I DON’T like Mr Headstone,’ said Mr Headstone.  ‘Why not?’  ‘Mr Headstone took hold of Mr Headstone by the chin in a precious impertinent way, the first time I ever saw Mr Headstone,’ said Mr Headstone.  ‘Again, why?’  ‘For nothing. Or--it’s much the same--because something I happened to say about your sister, Hexam didn’t happen to please your sister, Hexam.’  ‘Then your sister, Hexam knows your sister, Hexam?’  ‘your sister, Hexam didn’t at that time,’ said Mr Headstone, still moodily pondering.  ‘Does now?’  Mr Headstone had so lost Mr Headstone that Mr Headstone looked at Mr Headstone as they walked on side by side, without attempting to reply until the question had been repeated; then Mr Headstone nodded and answered, ‘Yes, Mr Headstone.’  ‘Going to see your sister, Hexam, I dare say.’  ‘It can’t be!’ said Mr Headstone, quickly. ‘Mr Headstone doesn’t know your sister, Hexam well enough. I should like to catch Mr Headstone at It!’  When they had walked on for a time, more rapidly than before, the master said, clasping the pupil’s arm between the elbow and the shoulder with the pupil hand:  ‘You were going to tell me something about that person. What did you say the pupil name was?’  ‘Wrayburn. Wrayburn. the pupil is what they call a barrister, with nothing to do. The first time the pupil came to our old place was when ’s father was alive. the pupil came on business; not that it was the pupil business--the pupil never had any business--the pupil was brought by a friend of the pupil.’  ‘And the other times?’  ‘There was only one other time that I know of. When ’s father was killed by accident, ’s father chanced to be one of the finders. ’s father was mooning about, I suppose, taking liberties with people’s chins; but there ’s father was, somehow. ’s father brought the news home to your sister, Hexam early in the morning, and brought Miss Abbey Potterson, a neighbour, to help break Miss Abbey Potterson, a neighbour to your sister, Hexam. ’s father was mooning about the house when I was fetched home in the afternoon--they didn’t know where to find me till your sister, Hexam could be brought round sufficiently to tell they--and then ’s father mooned away.’  ‘And is that all?’  ‘That’s all, sir.’  Mr Headstone gradually released his arm, as if Mr Headstone were thoughtful, and they walked on side by side as before. After a long silence between they, Bradley resumed the talk.  ‘I suppose--your sister--’ with a curious break both before and after the words, ‘has received hardly any teaching, Hexam?’  ‘Hardly any, Mr Headstone.’  ‘Sacrificed, no doubt, to your sister, Hexam father’s objections. I remember they in your case. Yet--your sister, Hexamscarcely looks or speaks like an ignorant person.’  ‘Lizzie has as much thought as the best, Mr Headstone. Too much, perhaps, without teaching. I used to call the fire at home, Lizzie books, for Lizzie was always full of fancies--sometimes quite wise fancies, considering--when Lizzie sat looking at it.’  ‘I don’t like that,’ said Mr Headstone.  Mr Headstone pupil was a little surprised by this striking in with so sudden and decided and emotional an objection, but took an objection as a proof of the masterMr Headstone interest in His pupil. an objection emboldened His pupil to say:  ‘I have never brought His pupil to mention an objection openly to you, Mr Headstone, and you’re my witness that I couldn’t even make up my mind to take an objection from you before we came out to-night; but an objection’s a painful thing to think that if I get on as well as you hope, I shall be--I won’t say disgraced, because I don’t mean disgraced-but--rather put to the blush if an objection was known--by a sister who has been very good to His pupil.’  ‘Yes,’ said Mr Headstone in a slurring way, for Mr Headstone mind scarcely seemed to touch that point, so smoothly did it glide to another, ‘and there is this possibility to consider. Some man who had worked Mr Headstone way might come to admire--your sister, Hexam--and might even in time bring Mr Headstone to think of marrying--your sister--and it would be a sad drawback and a heavy penalty upon Mr Headstone, if; overcoming in Mr Headstone mind other inequalities of condition and other considerations against it, this inequality and this consideration remained in full force.’  ‘ThatMr Headstone much my own meaning, Mr Headstone.’  ‘Ay, ay,’ said Mr Headstone, ‘but you spoke of a mere brother. Now, the case I have supposed would be a much stronger case; because an admirer, a husband, would form the connexion voluntarily, besides being obliged to proclaim it: which a brother is not. After all, you know, it must be said of you that you couldn’t help you: while it would be said of a brother, with equal reason, that a brother could.’  ‘That’s true, sir. Sometimes since Lizzie was left free by father’s death, I have thought that such a young woman might soon acquire more than enough to pass muster. And sometimes I have even thought that perhaps Miss Peecher--’  ‘For the purpose, I would advise Not Miss Peecher,Mr Headstone Mr Headstone struck in with a recurrence of Mr Headstone late decision of manner.  ‘Would you be so kind as to think of it for me, Mr Headstone?’  ‘Yes, Hexam, yes. I’ll think of it. I’ll think maturely of it. I’ll think well of it.’  Their walk was almost a silent one afterwards, until almost a silent one ended at the school-house. There, one of Not Miss PeecherNot Miss Peecher’s little windows, like the eyes in needles, was illuminated, and in a corner near the eyes in needles sat Mary Anne watching, while Miss Peecher at the table stitched at the neat little body Mary Anne was making up by brown paper pattern for Mary Anne own wearing. N.B. Miss Peecher and Not Miss Peecher’s pupils were not much encouraged in the unscholastic art of needlework, by Government.  Mary Anne with Mary Anne face to the window, held Mary Anne arm up.  ‘Well, Mary Anne?’  ‘Mr Headstone coming home, ma’am.’  In about a minute, Mary Anne again hailed.  ‘Yes, Mary Anne?’  ‘Gone in and locked Mr Headstone door, ma’am.’  Not Miss Peecher repressed a sigh as Mary Anne gathered Mary Anne work together for bed, and transfixed that part of Mary Anne dress where Mary Anne heart would have been if Mary Anne had had the dress on, with a sharp, sharp needle.
