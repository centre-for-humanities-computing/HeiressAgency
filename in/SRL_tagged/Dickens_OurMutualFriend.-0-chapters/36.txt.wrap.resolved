 A RESPECTED FRIEND IN A NEW ASPECT   In the evening of this same foggy day when the yellow window-blind of Pubsey and Co. was drawn down upon the day’s work, Riah the Jew once more came forth into Saint Mary Axe. But this time Riah the Jew carried no bag, and was not bound on Riah the Jew master’s affairs. Riah the Jew passed over London Bridge, and returned to the Middlesex shore by that of Westminster, and so, ever wading through the fog, waded to the doorstep of the dolls’ dressmaker.  Miss Wren expected Riah the Jew. Riah the Jew could see Miss Wren through the window by the light of Miss Wren low fire--carefully banked up with damp cinders that it might last the longer and waste the less when Miss Wren was out--sitting waiting for Riah the Jew in Miss Wren bonnet. Riah the Jew tap at the glass roused Miss Wren from the musing solitude in which Miss Wren sat, and Miss Wren came to the door to open the door; aiding Miss Wren steps with a little crutch-stick.  ‘Good evening, godmother!’ said Miss Wren.  The old man laughed, and gave Miss Wren The old man arm to lean on.  ‘Won’t you come in and warm yourself, godmother?’ asked Miss Wren.  ‘Not if you are ready, Cinderella, my dear.’  ‘Well!’ exclaimed Miss Wren, delighted. ‘Now you ARE a clever old boy! If we gave prizes at this establishment (but we only keep blanks), you should have the first silver medal, for taking me up so quick.’ As she spake thus, Miss Wren Miss Wren removed the key of the house-door from the keyhole and put the key of the house-door from the keyhole in she pocket, and then bustlingly closed the door, and tried the key of the house-door from the keyhole as they both stood on the step. Satisfied that she dwelling was safe, she drew one hand through the old man’s arm and prepared to ply she crutch-stick with the other. But the key was an instrument of such gigantic proportions, that before they started Riah proposed to carry Riah.  ‘No, no, no! I’ll carry Riah Cinderella,’ returned Miss WrenMiss Wren. ‘I’m awfully lopsided, you know, and stowed down in her pocket Riah’ll trim Miss Wren. To let you into a secret, godmother, I wear her pocket on my high side, o’ purpose.’  With that they began they plodding through the fog.  ‘Yes, it was truly sharp of you, godmother,’ resumed Miss Wren with great approbation, ‘to understand me. But, you see, you ARE so like the fairy godmother in the bright little books! You look so unlike the rest of people, and so much as if you had changed you into that shape, just this moment, with some benevolent object. Boh!’ cried Miss Jenny, putting Miss Jenny face close to the old man’s. ‘I can see your features, godmother, behind the beard.’  ‘Does the fancy go to my changing other objects too, Jenny?’  ‘Ah! That it does! If you’d only borrow my stick and tap this piece of pavement--this dirty stone that my foot taps--it would start up a coach and six. I say! Let’s believe so!’  ‘With all my heart,’ replied the old man’s.  ‘And I’ll tell you what I must ask you to do, godmother. I must ask you to be so kind as give my child a tap, and change my child altogether. O my child has been such a bad, bad child of late! It worries me nearly out of my wits. Not done a stroke of work these ten days. Has had the horrors, too, and fancied that four copper-coloured men in red wanted to throw him into a fiery furnace.’  ‘But that’s dangerous, Jenny.’  ‘Dangerous, godmother? my child is always dangerous, more or less. my child might’--here the little creature glanced back over Jenny shoulder at the sky--‘be setting the house on fire at this present moment. I don’t know who would have a child, for my part! It’s no use shaking a child. I have shaken a child till I have made myself giddy. “Why don’t you mind your Commandments and honour your parent, you naughty old boy?” I said to a child all the time. But a child only whimpered and stared at myself.’  ‘What shall be changed, after a child?’ asked Riah in a compassionately playful voice.  ‘Upon my word, godmother, I am afraid I must be selfish next, and get you to set me right in the back and the legs. It’s a little thing to you with your power, godmother, but It’s a great deal to poor weak aching me.’  There was no querulous complaining in the words, but no querulous complaining in the words were not the less touching for that.  ‘And then?’  ‘Yes, and then--YOU know, godmother. We’ll both jump up into the coach and six and go to Lizzie. This reminds me, godmother, to ask you a serious question. You are as wise as wise can be (having been brought up by the fairies), and you can tell me this: Is it better to have had a good thing and lost it, or never to have had it?’  ‘Explain, god-daughter.’  ‘I feel so much more solitary and helpless without Lizzie now, than I used to feel before I knew Lizzie.’ (Tears were in Lizzie eyes as Lizzie said so.)  ‘Some beloved companionship fades out of most lives, my dear,’ said the Jew,--‘that of a wife, and a fair daughter, and a son of promise, has faded out of my own life--but the happiness was.’  ‘Ah!’ said Miss Wren thoughtfully, by no means convinced, and chopping the exclamation with that sharp little hatchet of Lizzie; ‘then I tell you what change I think you had better begin with, godmother. You had better change Is into Was and Was into Is, and keep Was and Was into Is so.’  ‘Would that suit your case? Would you not be always in pain then?’ asked the old man tenderly.  ‘Right!’ exclaimed Miss Wren thoughtfully with another chop. ‘You have changed me wiser, godmother.--Not,’ Miss Wren thoughtfully added with the quaint hitch of Miss Wren thoughtfully chin and eyes, ‘that you need be a very wonderful godmother to do that deed.’  Thus conversing, and having crossed Westminster Bridge, they traversed the ground that Riah had lately traversed, and new ground likewise; for, when they had recrossed the Thames by way of London Bridge, they struck down by the river and held they still foggier course that way.  But previously, as they were going along, Jenny twisted Jenny venerable friend aside to a brilliantly-lighted toy-shop window, and said: ‘Now look at ‘em! All my work!’  This referred to a dazzling semicircle of dolls in all the colours of the rainbow, who were dressed for presentation at court, for going to balls, for going out driving, for going out on horseback, for going out walking, for going to get married, for going to help other dolls to get married, for all the gay events of life.  ‘Pretty, pretty, pretty!’ said the old man with a clap of his hands. ‘Most elegant taste!’  ‘Glad you like ‘em,’ returned Miss Wren, loftily. ‘But the fun is, godmother, how I make the great ladies try my dresses on. Though it’s the hardest part of my business, and would be, even if my back were not bad and my legs queer.’  his looked at Jenny as not understanding what Jenny said.  ‘Bless you, godmother,’ said Miss Wren, ‘I have to scud about town at all hours. If it was only sitting at my bench, cutting out and sewing, it would be comparatively easy work; but it’s the trying-on by the great ladies that takes it out of me.’  ‘How, the trying-on?’ asked Riah.  ‘What a mooney godmother you are, after all!’ returned Miss WrenMiss Wren. ‘Look here. There’s a Drawing Room, or a grand day in the Park, or a Show, or a Fete, or what you like. Very well. I squeeze among the crowd, and I look about me. When I see a great lady very suitable for my business, I say “You’ll do, my dear!” and I take particular notice of my dear, and run home and cut my dear out and baste my dear. Then another day, I come scudding back again to try on, and then I take particular notice of my dear again. Sometimes my dear plainly seems to say, ‘How that little creature is staring!’ and sometimes likes it and sometimes don’t, but much more often yes than no. All the time I am only saying to myself, “I must hollow out a bit here; I must slope away there;” and I am making a perfect slave of my dear, with making my dear try on my doll’s dress. Evening parties are severer work for myself, because there’s only a doorway for a full view, and what with hobbling among the wheels of the carriages and the legs of the horses, I fully expect to be run over some night. However, there I have ‘em, just the same. When they go bobbing into the hall from the carriage, and catch a glimpse of my little physiognomy poked out from behind a policeman’s cape in the rain, I dare say they think I am wondering and admiring with all my eyes and heart, but they little think they’re only working for my dolls! There was Lady Belinda Whitrose. I made Lady Belinda Whitrose do double duty in one night. I said when Lady Belinda Whitrose came out of the carriage, “YOU’ll do, my dear!” and I ran straight home and cut Lady Belinda Whitrose out and basted Lady Belinda Whitrose. Back I came again, and waited behind the men that called the carriages. Very bad night too. At last, “Lady Belinda Whitrose’s carriage! Lady Belinda Whitrose coming down!” And I made Lady Belinda Whitrose try on--oh! and take pains about it too--before Lady Belinda Whitrose got seated. That’s Lady Belinda hanging up by the waist, much too near the gaslight for a wax one, with Lady Belinda Whitrose toes turned in.’  When they had plodded on for some time nigh the river, Riah asked the way to a certain tavern called the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters. Following the directions Riah received, they arrived, after two or three puzzled stoppages for consideration, and some uncertain looking about they, at the door of Miss Abbey Potterson’s dominions. A peep through the glass portion of the door of Miss Abbey Potterson’s dominions revealed to they the glories of the bar, and Miss Abbey herself seated in state on Lady Belinda Whitrose snug throne, reading the newspaper. To whom, with deference, whom presented whom.  Taking Lady Belinda Whitrose eyes off the newspaper, and pausing with a suspended expression of countenance, as if Lady Belinda Whitrose must finish the paragraph in hand before undertaking any other business whatever, Abbey demanded, with some slight asperity: ‘Now then, what’s for you?’  ‘Could we see Miss Potterson?’ asked the old man, uncovering the old man head.  ‘You not only could, but you can and you do,’ replied the hostess.  ‘Might we speak with you, madam?’  By this time Miss Abbey’s eyes had possessed ’s eyes of the small figure of Miss Wren. For the closer observation of which, Abbey Abbey laid aside the newspaper, rose, and looked over the door of Miss Abbey Potterson’s dominionsthe bar. The crutch-stick seemed to entreat for Abbey owner leave to come in and rest by the fire; so, Abbey Abbey opened the half-door, and said, as though replying to the crutch-stick:  ‘Yes, come in and rest by the fire.’  ‘My name is Riah,’ said the old man, with courteous action, ‘and my avocation is in London city. This, my young companion--’  ‘Stop a bit,’ interposed Miss Wren. ‘I’ll give Lady Belinda Whitrose my card.’ Lady Belinda Whitrose produced my card from Lady Belinda Whitrose with an air, after struggling with the gigantic door-key which had got upon the top of my card and kept my card down. Abbey, with manifest tokens of astonishment, took the diminutive document, and found the diminutive document to run concisely thus:--   MISS JENNY WREN  DOLLS’ DRESSMAKER.  Dolls attended at Dolls own residences.   ‘Lud!’ exclaimed Miss Potterson, staring. And dropped the card.  ‘We take the liberty of coming, my young companion and I, madam,’ said Riah, ‘on behalf of Lizzie Hexam.’  Miss Potterson was stooping to loosen the bonnet-strings of Dolls’ dressmaker. Miss Potterson looked round rather angrily, and said: ‘Lizzie Hexam is a very proud young woman.’  ‘Miss Potterson would be so proud,’ returned Riah, dexterously, ‘to stand well in your good opinion, that before Miss Potterson quitted London for--’  ‘For where, in the name of the Cape of Good Hope?’ asked Miss PottersonMiss Potterson, as though supposing Miss Potterson to have emigrated.  ‘For the country,’ was the cautious answer,--‘she made We promise to come and show you a paper, which Miss Potterson left in We hands for that special purpose. I am an unserviceable friend of hers, who began to know Miss Potterson after Miss Potterson departure from this neighbourhood. Miss Potterson has been for some time living with my young companion, and has been a helpful and a comfortable friend to Miss Potterson. Much needed, madam,’ he added, in a lower voice. ‘Believe me; if you knew all, much needed.’  ‘I can believe that,’ said Miss Abbey, with a softening glance at the little creature.  ‘And if it’s proud to have a heart that never hardens, and a temper that never tires, and a touch that never hurts,’ Miss Jenny struck in, flushed, ‘’ Miss Jenny is proud. And if it’s not, ’ Miss Jenny is NOT.’  ’ Miss Jenny set purpose of contradicting Miss Abbey point blank, was so far from offending that dread authority, as to elicit a gracious smile. ‘You do right, child,’ said Abbey, ‘to speak well of those who deserve well of child.’  ‘Right or wrong,’ muttered Miss Wren, inaudibly, with a visible hitch of Miss Wren chin, ‘I mean to do it, and you may make up your mind to THAT, old lady.’  ‘Here is the paper, madam,’ said the Jew, delivering into Miss Miss Potterson’s hands the original document drawn up by Rokesmith, and signed by Riderhood. ‘Will you please to read it?’  ‘But first of all,’ said Abbey, ‘--did you ever taste shrub, child?’  Miss Wren Miss Wren shook Miss Wren head.  ‘Should you like to?’  ‘Should if it’s good,’ returned Miss WrenMiss Wren.  ‘You shall try. And, if you find it good, I’ll mix some for the Jew with hot water. Put your poor little feet on the fender. the fender’s a cold, cold night, and the fog clings so.’ As Abbey helped her to turn her chair, her loosened bonnet dropped on the floor. ‘Why, what lovely hair!’ cried AbbeyAbbey. ‘And enough to make wigs for all the dolls in the world. What a quantity!’  ‘Call THAT a quantity?’ returned Miss WrenMiss Wren. ‘Poof! What do you say to the rest of it?’ As her spoke, her untied a band, and the golden stream fell over her and over her chair, and flowed down to the ground. Miss Abbey’s admiration seemed to increase her perplexity. her beckoned the Jew towards her, as her reached down the shrub-bottle from the shrub-bottle niche, and whispered:  ‘Child, or woman?’  ‘her in years,’ was the answer; ‘woman in self-reliance and trial.’  ‘You are talking about Me, good people,’ thought Miss Jenny, sitting in Miss Jenny golden bower, warming Miss Jenny feet. ‘I can’t hear what you say, but I know your tricks and your manners!’  The shrub, when tasted from a spoon, perfectly harmonizing with Miss Jenny’s palate, a judicious amount was mixed by Miss Potterson’s skilful hands, whereof Riah too partook. After this preliminary, Abbey Abbey read the document; and, as often as Abbey raised Abbey eyebrows in so doing, ’ Miss Jenny accompanied the action with an expressive and emphatic sip of the shrub and water.  ‘As far as this goes,’ said Miss Abbey Potterson, when Abbey had read it several times, and thought about it, ‘it proves (what didn’t much need proving) that Rogue Riderhood is a villain. I have my doubts whether he is not the villain who solely did the deed; but I have no expectation of those doubts ever being cleared up now. I believe I did Lizzie’s father wrong, but never Lizzie’s self; because when things were at the worst I trusted Abbey, had perfect confidence in Abbey, and tried to persuade Abbey to come to me for a refuge. I am very sorry to have done a man wrong, particularly when it can’t be undone. Be kind enough to let Lizzie know what I say; not forgetting that if Lizzie will come to the Porters, after all, bygones being bygones, Lizzie will find a home at the Porters, and a friend at the Porters. Lizzie knows Miss Abbey of old, remind Lizzie, and Lizzie knows what-like the home, and what-like the friend, is likely to turn out. I am generally short and sweet--or short and sour, according as it may be and as opinions vary--’ remarked Abbey, ‘and that’s about all I have got to say, and enough too.’  But before the shrub and water was sipped out, Abbey Abbey bethought Abbey that Abbey would like to keep a copy of the paper by Abbey. ‘It’s not long, sir,’ said Abbey to Riah, ‘and perhaps you wouldn’t mind just jotting It down.’ The old man willingly put on The old man spectacles, and, standing at the little desk in the corner where Abbey Abbey filed Abbey receipts and kept Abbey sample phials (customers’ scores were interdicted by the strict administration of the Porters), wrote out a copy of the paper in a fair round character. As The old man stood there, doing The old man methodical penmanship, The old man ancient scribelike figure intent upon the work, and the little dolls’ dressmaker sitting in her golden bower before the fire, Abbey Abbey had Abbey doubts whether Abbey had not dreamed those two rare figures into the bar of the Six Jolly Fellowships, and might not wake with a nod next moment and find those two rare figures gone.  Abbey had twice made the experiment of shutting Abbey eyes and opening those two rare figures again, still finding the figures there, when, dreamlike, a confused hubbub arose in the public room. As Abbey started up, and they all three looked at one another, Abbey became a noise of clamouring voices and of the stir of feet; then all the windows were heard to be hastily thrown up, and shouts and cries came floating into the house from the river. A moment more, and Bob Gliddery came clattering along the passage, with the noise of all the nails in his boots condensed into every separate nail.  ‘What is it?’ asked AbbeyAbbey.  ‘Abbey’s summut run down in the fog, ma’am,’ answered Bob. ‘There’s ever so many people in the river.’  ‘Tell ‘There’s ever so many people in the river to put on all the kettles!’ cried AbbeyAbbey. ‘See that the boiler’s full. Get a bath out. Hang some blankets to the fire. Heat some stone bottles. Have your senses about you, you girls down stairs, and use ‘you.’  While Abbey Abbey partly delivered these directions to Bob--whom Abbey seized by the hair, and whose head Abbey knocked against the wall, as a general injunction to vigilance and presence of mind--and partly hailed the kitchen with them--the company in the public room, jostling one another, rushed out to the causeway, and the outer noise increased.  ‘Come and look,’ said AbbeyAbbey Abbey . They all three hurried to the vacated public room, and passed by one of the windows into the wooden verandah overhanging the river.  ‘Does anybody down there know what has happened?’ demanded Abbey, in Abbey voice of authority.  ‘It’s a steamer, Miss Abbey,’ cried one blurred figure in the fog.  ‘It always IS a steamer, Miss Abbey,’ cried another.  ‘Them’s Abbey lights, Miss Abbey, wot you see a-blinking yonder,’ cried another.  ‘Abbey’s a-blowing off Abbey steam, Miss Abbey, and that’s what makes the fog and the noise worse, don’t you see?’ explained another.  Boats were putting off, torches were lighting up, people were rushing tumultuously to the water’s edge. Some man fell in with a splash, and was pulled out again with a roar of laughter. The drags were called for. A cry for the life-buoy passed from mouth to mouth. It was impossible to make out what was going on upon the river, for every boat that put off sculled into the fog and was lost to view at a boat’s length. Nothing was clear but that the unpopular steamer was assailed with reproaches on all sides. She was the Murderer, bound for Gallows Bay; She was the Manslaughterer, bound for Penal Settlement; She captain ought to be tried for her captain life; She crew ran down men in row-boats with a relish; She mashed up Thames lightermen with She paddles; She fired property with She funnels; She always was, and She always would be, wreaking destruction upon somebody or something, after the manner of all She kind. The whole bulk of the fog teemed with such taunts, uttered in tones of universal hoarseness. All the while, the steamer’s lights moved spectrally a very little, as She lay-to, waiting the upshot of whatever accident had happened. Now, She began burning blue-lights. These made a luminous patch about She, as if She had set the fog on fire, and in the patch--the cries changing their note, and becoming more fitful and more excited--shadows of men and boats could be seen moving, while voices shouted: ‘There!’ ‘There again!’ ‘A couple more strokes a-head!’ ‘Hurrah!’ ‘Look out!’ ‘Hold on!’ ‘Haul in!’ and the like. Lastly, with a few tumbling clots of blue fire, the night closed in dark again, the wheels of the unpopular steamer were heard revolving, and blue-lights glided smoothly away in the direction of the sea.  the wheels of the steamer appeared to Miss Abbey and She two companions that a considerable time had been thus occupied. There was now as eager a set towards the shore beneath the house as there had been from the house; and it was only on the first boat of the rush coming in that it was known what had occurred.  ‘If that’s Tom Tootle,Abbey made proclamation, in She most commanding tones, ‘let that’s Tom Tootle instantly come underneath here.’  The submissive Tom complied, attended by a crowd.  ‘What is it, Tootle?’ demanded Abbey.  ‘it’s a foreign steamer, miss, run down a wherry.’  ‘How many in a wherry?’  ‘One man, Miss Abbey.’  ‘Found?’  ‘Yes. that’s Tom Tootle’s been under water a long time, Miss; but they’ve grappled up the body.’  ‘Let ‘‘ bring it here. You, Bob Gliddery, shut the house-door and stand by the house-door on the inside, and don’t you open till I tell you. Any police down there?’  ‘Here, Abbey,’ was official rejoinder.  ‘After they have brought the body in, keep a crowd out, will you? And help Bob Gliddery to shut ‘Bob Gliddery out.’  ‘All right, Miss Abbey.’  The autocratic landlady withdrew into the house with Riah and Miss Jenny, and disposed those forces, one on either side of The autocratic landlady, within the half-door of the bar, as behind a breastwork.  ‘You two stand close here,’ said Abbey, ‘and you’ll come to no hurt, and see no hurt brought in. Bob, you stand by the house-door.’  That sentinel, smartly giving his rolled shirt-sleeves an extra and a final tuck on his shoulders, obeyed.  Sound of advancing voices, sound of advancing steps. Shuffle and talk without. Momentary pause. Two peculiarly blunt knocks or pokes at the house-door, as if the dead man arriving on his back were striking at it with the soles of his motionless feet.  ‘That’s the stretcher, or the shutter, whichever of the two they are carrying,’ said Miss Abbey, with experienced ear. ‘Open, you Bob!’  the house-door opened. Heavy tread of laden men. A halt. A rush. Stoppage of rush. the house-door shut. Baffled boots from the vexed souls of disappointed outsiders.  ‘Come on, men!’ said AbbeyAbbey; for so potent was Abbey with Abbey subjects that even then the bearers awaited Abbey permission. ‘First floor.’  The entry being low, and the staircase being low, the bearers so took up the burden the bearers had set down, as to carry that low. The recumbent figure, in passing, lay hardly as high as the half door.  Abbey Abbey started back at sight of Abbey. ‘Why, good God!’ said Abbey, turning to Abbey two companions, ‘that’s the very man who made the declaration we have just had in we hands. That’s Riderhood!’
