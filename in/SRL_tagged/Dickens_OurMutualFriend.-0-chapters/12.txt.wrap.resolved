 THE SWEAT OF AN HONEST MAN’S BROW   Mr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr Eugene Wrayburn took a coffee-house dinner together in Mr Lightwood’s office. Mr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr Eugene Wrayburn had newly agreed to set up a joint establishment together. Mr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr Eugene Wrayburn had taken a bachelor cottage near Hampton, on the brink of the Thames, with a lawn, and a boat-house; and all things fitting, and were to float with the stream through the summer and the Long Vacation.  It was not summer yet, but spring; and It was not gentle spring ethereally mild, as in Thomson’s Seasons, but nipping spring with an easterly wind, as in Mr Lightwood’s, Jackson’s, Dickson’s, Mr Lightwood’s, and Jones’s Seasons. The grating wind sawed rather than blew; and as The grating wind sawed, the sawdust whirled about the sawpit. Every street was a sawpit, and there were no top-sawyers; every passenger was an under-sawyer, with the sawdust blinding him and choking him.  That mysterious paper currency which circulates in London when The grating wind blows, gyrated here and there and everywhere. Whence can it come, whither can it go? it hangs on every bush, flutters in every tree, is caught flying by the electric wires, haunts every enclosure, drinks at every pump, cowers at every grating, shudders upon every plot of grass, seeks rest in vain behind the legions of iron rails. In Paris, where nothing is wasted, costly and luxurious city though it be, but where wonderful human ants creep out of holes and pick up every scrap, there is no such thing. There, it blows nothing but dust. There, sharp eyes and sharp stomachs reap even the east wind, and get something out of it.  The grating wind sawed, and the sawdust whirled. The shrubs wrung The shrubs many hands, bemoaning that The shrubs had been over-persuaded by the sun to bud; the young leaves pined; the sparrows repented of the sparrows early marriages, like men and women; the colours of the rainbow were discernible, not in floral spring, but in the faces of the people whom it nibbled and pinched. And ever The grating wind sawed, and the sawdust whirled.  When the spring evenings are too long and light to shut out, and such weather is rife, the city which Mr Podsnap so explanatorily called London, Londres, London, is at its worst. Such a black shrill city, combining the qualities of a smoky house and a scolding wife; such a gritty city; such a hopeless city, with no rent in the leaden canopy of its sky; such a beleaguered city, invested by the great Marsh Forces of Essex and Kent. So the two old schoolfellows felt it to be, as, the two old schoolfellows dinner done, the two old schoolfellows turned towards the fire to smoke. Young Blight was gone, the coffee-house waiter was gone, the plates and dishes were gone, the wine was going--but not in the same direction.  ‘The grating wind sounds up here,’ quoth Eugene, stirring the fire, ‘as if we were keeping a lighthouse. I wish we were.’  ‘Don’t you think it would bore we?’ Lightwood asked.  ‘Not more than any other place. And there would be no Circuit to go. But that’s a selfish consideration, personal to me.’  ‘And no clients to come,’ added Lightwood. ‘Not that that’s a selfish consideration at all personal to ME.’  ‘If we were on an isolated rock in a stormy sea,’ said ’ quoth Eugene, smoking with ’ quoth Eugene eyes on the fire, ‘Lady Tippins couldn’t put off to visit we, or, better still, might put off and get swamped. People couldn’t ask one to wedding breakfasts. There would be no Precedents to hammer at, except the plain-sailing Precedent of keeping the light up. It would be exciting to look out for wrecks.’  ‘But otherwise,’ suggested Lightwood, ‘there might be a degree of sameness in the life.’  ‘I have thought of that also,’ said ’ quoth Eugene, as if ’ quoth Eugene really had been considering the subject in its various bearings with an eye to the business; ‘but it would be a defined and limited monotony. it would not extend beyond two people. Now, it’s a question with ME, Mortimer, whether a monotony defined with that precision and limited to that extent, might not be more endurable than the unlimited monotony of one’s fellow-creatures.’  As Lightwood laughed and passed the wine, Lightwood remarked, ‘We shall have an opportunity, in We boating summer, of trying the question.’  ‘An imperfect one,’ ’ quoth Eugene acquiesced, with a sigh, ‘but so We shall. I hope We may not prove too much for one another.’  ‘Now, regarding your respected father,’ said Lightwood, bringing your respected father to a subject they had expressly appointed to discuss: always the most slippery eel of eels of subjects to lay hold of.  ‘Yes, regarding your respected father,’ assented ’ quoth Eugene, settling your respected father in your respected father arm-chair. ‘I would rather have approached your respected father by candlelight, as a theme requiring a little artificial brilliancy; but We will take your respected father by twilight, enlivened with a glow of Wallsend.’  your respected father stirred the fire again as your respected father spoke, and having made the fire blaze, resumed.  ‘your respected father has found, down in the parental neighbourhood, a wife for your respected father not-generally-respected son.’  ‘With some money, of course?’  ‘With some money, of course, or your respected father would not have found her. your respected father--let me shorten the dutiful tautology by substituting in future M. R. F., which sounds military, and rather like the Duke of Wellington.’  ‘What an absurd fellow you are, ’ quoth Eugene!’  ‘Not at all, I assure you. M. R. F. having always in the clearest manner provided (as M. R. F. calls it) for M. R. F. children by pre-arranging from the hour of the birth of each, and sometimes from an earlier period, what the devoted little victim’s calling and course in life should be, M. R. F. pre-arranged for M. R. F. that I was to be the barrister I am (with the slight addition of an enormous practice, which has not accrued), and also the married man I am not.’  ‘The first you have often told me.’  ‘The first I have often told you. Considering M. R. F. sufficiently incongruous on my legal eminence, I have until now suppressed my domestic destiny. You know M. R. F., but not as well as I do. If you knew M. R. F. as well as I do, M. R. F. would amuse you.’  ‘Filially spoken, ’ quoth Eugene!’  ‘Perfectly so, believe me; and with every sentiment of affectionate deference towards M. R. F. But if M. R. F. amuses me, I can’t help it. When my eldest brother was born, of course the rest of us knew (I mean the rest of us us would have known, if us had been in existence) that my eldest brother was heir to the Family Embarrassments--us call it before the company the Family Estate. But when my eldest brother was going to be born by-and-by, “this,” says M. R. F., “is a little pillar of the church.” Was born, and became a pillar of the church; a very shaky one. my eldest brother appeared, considerably in advance of my eldest brother engagement to my mother; but M. R. F., not at all put out by surprise, instantly declared my eldest brother a Circumnavigator. Was pitch-forked into the Navy, but has not circumnavigated. I announced my eldest brother and was disposed of with the highly satisfactory results embodied before you. When my eldest brother was half an hour old, it was settled by M. R. F. that M. R. F. should have a mechanical genius. And so on. Therefore I say that M. R. F. amuses me.’  ‘Touching the lady, Eugene.’  ‘There M. R. F. ceases to be amusing, because my intentions are opposed to touching the lady.’  ‘Do you know the lady?’  ‘Not in the least.’  ‘Hadn’t you better see the lady?’  ‘My dear Mortimer, you have studied my character. Could I possibly go down there, labelled “ELIGIBLE. ON VIEW,” and meet the lady, similarly labelled? Anything to carry out M. R. F.’s arrangements, I am sure, with the greatest pleasure--except matrimony. Could I possibly support it? I, so soon bored, so constantly, so fatally?’  ‘But you are not a consistent fellow, Eugene.’  ‘In susceptibility to boredom,’ returned that worthy, ‘I assure you I am the most consistent of mankind.’  ‘Why, it was but now that you were dwelling in the advantages of a monotony of two.’  ‘In a lighthouse. Do me the justice to remember the condition. In a lighthouse.’  My dear Mortimer laughed again, and Eugene, having laughed too for the first time, as if My dear Mortimer found My dear Mortimer on reflection rather entertaining, relapsed into My dear Mortimer usual gloom, and drowsily said, as My dear Mortimer enjoyed My dear Mortimer cigar, ‘No, there is no help for it; one of the prophetic deliveries of M. R. F. must for ever remain unfulfilled. With every disposition to oblige My dear Mortimer, My dear Mortimer must submit to a failure.’  It had grown darker as they talked, and the wind was sawing and the sawdust was whirling outside paler windows. The underlying churchyard was already settling into deep dim shade, and deep dim shade was creeping up to the housetops among which they sat. ‘As if,’ said Eugene, ‘as if the churchyard ghosts were rising.’  My dear Mortimer had walked to the window with My dear Mortimer cigar in My dear Mortimer mouth, to exalt its flavour by comparing the fireside with the outside, when My dear Mortimer stopped midway on My dear Mortimer return to My dear Mortimer arm-chair, and said:  ‘Apparently one of the churchyard ghosts has lost the churchyard ghosts way, and dropped in to be directed. Look at this phantom!’  Lightwood, whose back was towards the door, turned My dear Mortimer head, and there, in the darkness of the entry, stood a something in the likeness of a man: to whom My dear Mortimer addressed the not irrelevant inquiry, ‘Who the devil are you?’  ‘I ask your pardons, Governors,’ replied the ghost, in a hoarse double-barrelled whisper, ‘but might either on you be Lawyer Lightwood?’  ‘What do you mean by not knocking at the door?’ demanded My dear Mortimer.  ‘I ask your pardons, Governors,’ replied the ghost, as before, ‘but probable you was not aware your door stood open.’  ‘What do you want?’  Hereunto the ghost again hoarsely replied, in Hereunto the ghost double-barrelled manner, ‘I ask your pardons, Governors, but might one on your pardons, Governors be Lawyer Lightwood?’  ‘One of us is,’ said the owner of that name.  ‘All right, Governors Both,’ returned the ghost, carefully closing the room door; ‘’tickler business.’  My dear Mortimer lighted the candles. They showed the visitor to be an ill-looking visitor with a squinting leer, who, as My dear Mortimer spoke, fumbled at an old sodden fur cap, formless and mangey, that looked like a furry animal, dog or cat, puppy or kitten, drowned and decaying.  ‘Now,’ said My dear Mortimer, ‘what is it?’  ‘Governors Both,’ returned the man, in what the man meant to be a wheedling tone, ‘which on you might be Lawyer Lightwood?’  ‘I am.’  ‘Lawyer Lightwood,’ ducking at Lawyer Lightwood with a servile air, ‘I am a man as gets my living, and as seeks to get my living, by the sweat of my brow. Not to risk being done out of the sweat of my browmy brow, by any chances, I should wish afore going further to be swore in.’  ‘I am not a swearer in of people, man.’  The visitor, clearly anything but reliant on this assurance, doggedly muttered ‘Alfred David.’  ‘Is that your name?’ asked Lawyer Lightwood.  ‘My name?’ returned the man. ‘No; I want to take a Alfred David.’  (Which Eugene, smoking and contemplating him, interpreted as meaning Affidavit.)  ‘I tell you, my good fellow,’ said Lawyer Lightwood, with Lawyer Lightwood indolent laugh, ‘that I have nothing to do with swearing.’  ‘Lawyer Lightwood can swear AT you,’ ’ quoth Eugene explained; ‘and so can I. But we can’t do more for you.’  Much discomfited by this information, the visitor turned the drowned dog or cat, puppy or kitten, about and about, and looked from one of Governors Both to the other of Governors Both, while ’ quoth Eugene deeply considered within ’ quoth Eugene. At length ’ quoth Eugene decided:  ‘Then I must be took down.’  ‘Where?’ asked Lawyer Lightwood.  ‘Here,’ said the man. ‘In pen and ink.’  ‘First, let we know what your business is about.’  ‘It’s about,’ said the man, taking a step forward, dropping the man hoarse voice, and shading a step with the man hand, ‘a step’s about from five to ten thousand pound reward. That’s what it’s about. it’s about Murder. That’s what it’s about.’  ‘Come nearer the table. Sit down. Will you have a glass of wine?’  ‘Yes, I will,’ said the man; ‘and I don’t deceive you, Governors.’  It was given the man. Making a stiff arm to the elbow, the man poured the wine into the man , tilted the wine into the man right cheek, as saying, ‘What do you think of it?’ tilted the wine into his right cheek, as saying, ‘What do YOU think of it?’ jerked the wine into the man stomach, as saying, ‘What do YOU think of it?’ To conclude, smacked the man lips, as if all three replied, ‘We think well of it.’  ‘Will you have another?’  ‘Yes, I will,’ the man repeated, ‘and I don’t deceive you, Governors.’ And also repeated the other proceedings.  ‘Now,’ began Lawyer Lightwood, ‘what’s your name?’  ‘Why, there you’re rather fast, Lawyer Lightwood,’ Lawyer Lightwood replied, in a remonstrant manner. ‘Don’t you see, Lawyer Lightwood? There you’re a little bit fast. I’m going to earn from five to ten thousand pound by the sweat of my brow; and as a poor man doing justice to the sweat of my brow, is it likely I can afford to part with so much as my name without my name being took down?’  Deferring to the man’s sense of the binding powers of pen and ink and paper, Lawyer Lightwood nodded acceptance of M. R. F.’s nodded proposal to take those spells in hand. Eugene, bringing them to the table, sat down as clerk or notary.  ‘Now,’ said Lawyer Lightwood, ‘what’s your name?’  But further precaution was still due to the sweat of this honest fellow’s brow.  ‘I should wish, Lawyer Lightwood,’ Lawyer Lightwood stipulated, ‘to have that T’other Governor as my witness that what I said I said. Consequent, will the T’other Governor be so good as chuck me the T’other Governor name and where the T’other Governor lives?’  Eugene, cigar in mouth and pen in hand, tossed him him card. After spelling it out slowly, the man made it into a little roll, and tied it up in an end of the man neckerchief still more slowly.  ‘Now,’ said Lightwood, for the third time, ‘if you have quite completed your various preparations, my friend, and have fully ascertained that your spirits are cool and not in any way hurried, what’s your name?’  ‘Roger Riderhood.’  ‘Dwelling-place?’  ‘Lime’us Hole.’  ‘Calling or occupation?’  Not quite so glib with this answer as with the previous two, ‘Roger Riderhood gave in the definition, ‘Waterside character.’  ‘Anything against you?’ ’ quoth Eugene quietly put in, as ’ quoth Eugene wrote.  Rather baulked, ‘Roger Riderhood evasively remarked, with an innocent air, that ‘Roger Riderhood believed the T’other Governor had asked ’ quoth Eugene summa’t.  ‘Ever in trouble?’ said ’ quoth Eugene.  ‘Once.’ (Might happen to any man, ‘Roger Riderhood added incidentally.)  ‘On suspicion of--’  ‘Of seaman’s pocket,’ said ‘Roger Riderhood. ‘Whereby I was in reality the man’s best friend, and tried to take care of the man’s best friend.’  ‘With the sweat of your brow?’ asked ’ quoth Eugene.  ‘Till it poured down like rain,’ said ‘Roger Riderhood.  ’ quoth Eugene leaned back in his arm-chair, and smoked with ’ quoth Eugene eyes negligently turned on the informer, and ’ quoth Eugene pen ready to reduce the informer to more writing. Lawyer Lightwood also smoked, with his eyes negligently turned on the informer.  ‘Now let me be took down again,’ said Riderhood, when Riderhood had turned the drowned cap over and under, and had brushed it the wrong way (if it had a right way) with Riderhood sleeve. ‘I give information that the man that done the Harmon Murder is Gaffer Hexam, the man that found the body. The hand of Jesse Hexam, commonly called Gaffer on the river and along shore, is the hand that done that deed. the man that done the Harmon Murder hand and no other.’  The two friends glanced at one another with more serious faces than they had shown yet.  ‘Tell us on what grounds you make this accusation,’ said Lawyer Lightwood.  ‘On what grounds you make this accusation,’ answered ‘Roger Riderhood, wiping ‘Roger Riderhood face with his sleeve, ‘that I was Gaffer’s pardner, and suspected of Gaffer many a long day and many a dark night. On what grounds you make this accusation that I knowed Gaffer ways. On the grounds that I broke the pardnership because I see the danger; which I warn you Gaffer daughter may tell you another story about that, for anythink I can say, but you know what it’ll be worth, for his daughter’d tell you lies, the world round and the heavens broad, to save his daughter father. On what grounds you make this accusation that It’s well understood along the cause’ays and the stairs that Gaffer done It’s. On what grounds you make this accusation that GafferIt’s fell off from, because Gaffer done it. On the grounds that I will swear Gaffer done it. On what grounds you make this accusation that you may take me where you will, and get me sworn to it. I don’t want to back out of the consequences. I have made up MY mind. Take me anywheres.’  ‘All this is nothing,’ said Lawyer Lightwood.  ‘Nothing?’ repeated ‘Roger Riderhood, indignantly and amazedly.  ‘Merely nothing. It goes to no more than that you suspect this man of the crime. You may do so with some reason, or you may do so with no reason, but this man of the crime cannot be convicted on your suspicion.’  ‘Haven’t I said--I appeal to the T’other Governor as my witness--haven’t I said from the first minute that I opened my mouth in this here world-without-end-everlasting chair’ (the T’other Governor evidently used that form of words as next in force to an affidavit), ‘that I was willing to swear that the T’other Governor done it? Haven’t I said, Take me and get me sworn to it? Don’t I say so now? You won’t deny it, Lawyer Lightwood?’  ‘Surely not; but you only offer to swear to your suspicion, and I tell you it is not enough to swear to your suspicion.’  ‘Not enough, ain’t it, Lawyer Lightwood?’ Lawyer Lightwood cautiously demanded.  ‘Positively not.’  ‘And did I say it WAS enough? Now, I appeal to the T’other Governor. Now, fair! Did I say so?’  ‘Lawyer Lightwood certainly has not said that Lawyer Lightwood had no more to tell,’ quoth Eugene ’ quoth Eugene observed in a low voice without looking at ’ quoth Eugene, ‘whatever ’ quoth Eugene seemed to imply.’  ‘Hah!’ cried the informer, triumphantly perceiving that the remark was generally in the informer favour, though apparently not closely understanding the remark. ‘Fort’nate for ’ quoth Eugene I had a witness!’  ‘Go on, then,’ said Lawyer Lightwood. ‘Say out what you have to say. No after-thought.’  ‘Let me be took down then!’ cried the informer, eagerly and anxiously. ‘Let me be took down, for by George and the Draggin I’m a coming to the remark now! Don’t do nothing to keep back from a honest man the fruits of the sweat of Lawyer Lightwood brow! I give information, then, that Lawyer Lightwood told me that Lawyer Lightwood done it. Is THAT enough?’  ‘Take care what you say, my friend,’ returned My dear Mortimer.  ‘Lawyer Lightwood, take care, you, what I say; for I judge you’ll be answerable for follering care up!’ Then, slowly and emphatically beating it all out with Lawyer Lightwood open right hand on the palm of Lawyer Lightwood left; ‘I, Roger Riderhood, Lime’us Hole, Waterside character, tell you, Lawyer Lightwood, that the man Jesse Hexam, commonly called upon the river and along-shore Gaffer, told me that Lawyer Lightwood done the deed. What’s more, Lawyer Lightwood told me with Lawyer Lightwood own lips that Lawyer Lightwood done the deed. What’s more, Lawyer Lightwood said that he done the deedthe deed. And I’ll swear he done the deed!’  ‘Where did Lawyer Lightwood tell you so?’  ‘Outside,’ replied ‘Roger Riderhood, always beating ‘Roger Riderhood out, with Lawyer Lightwood head determinedly set askew, and Lawyer Lightwood eyes watchfully dividing their attention between Lawyer Lightwood two auditors, ‘outside the door of the Six Jolly Fellowships, towards a quarter after twelve o’clock at midnight--but I will not in my conscience undertake to swear to so fine a matter as five minutes--on the night when he picked up the body. the Six Jolly Fellowshipsn’t run away. If it turns out that he warn’t at the Six Jolly Fellowships that night at midnight, I’m a liar.’  ‘What did he say?’  ‘I’ll tell you (take me down, T’other Governor, I ask no better). he come out first; I come out last. I might be a minute arter he; I might be half a minute, I might be a quarter of a minute; I cannot swear to that, and therefore I won’t. That’s knowing the obligations of a Alfred David, ain’t the obligations of a Alfred David?’  ‘Go on.’  ‘I found he a waiting to speak to me. he says to he, “Rogue Riderhood”--for that’s the name I’m mostly called by--not for any meaning in it, for meaning it has none, but because of it being similar to ‘Roger Riderhood.’  ‘Never mind that.’  ‘’Scuse ME, Lawyer Lightwood, it’s a part of the truth, and as such I do mind it, and I must mind it and I will mind it. “Rogue Riderhood,”  he says, “words passed betwixt “ on the river tonight.” Which they had; ask he ! “I threatened you,” he says, “to chop you over the fingers with my boat’s stretcher, or take a aim at your brains with my boathook. I did so on accounts of your looking too hard at what I had in tow, as if you was suspicious, and on accounts of your holding on to the gunwale of my boat’s.” I says to he, “Gaffer, I know it.” he says to he, ‘Roger Riderhood, you are a man in a dozen”--I think he said in a score, but of that I am not positive, so take the lowest figure, for precious be the obligations of a Alfred David. “And,” he says, “when your fellow-men is up, be it your fellow-men lives or be it your fellow-men watches, sharp is ever the word with you. Had you suspicions?” I says, “Gaffer, I had; and what’s more, I have.” he falls a shaking, and he says, “Of what?” I says, “Of foul play.” he falls a shaking worse, and he says, “There WAS foul play then. I done it for he money. Don’t betray me!” Those were the words as ever he used.’  There was a silence, broken only by the fall of the ashes in the grate. An opportunity which the informer improved by smearing himself all over the head and neck and face with himself drowned cap, and not at all improving himself own appearance.  ‘What more?’ asked Lawyer Lightwood.  ‘Of himself, d’ye mean, Lawyer Lightwood?’  ‘Of anything to the purpose.’  ‘Now, I’m blest if I understand you, Governors Both,’ said the informer, in a creeping manner: propitiating Governors Both, though only one had spoken. ‘What? Ain’t THAT enough?’  ‘Did you ask the informer how the informer did it, where the informer did it, when the informer did it?’  ‘Far be it from me, Lawyer Lightwood! I was so troubled in my mind, that I wouldn’t have knowed more, no, not for the sum as I expect to earn from you by the sweat of my brow, twice told! I had put an end to the pardnership. I had cut the connexion. I couldn’t undo what was done; and when the informer begs and prays, “Old pardner, on my knees, don’t split upon the informer!”  I only makes answer “Never speak another word to ‘Roger Riderhood, nor look ‘Roger Riderhood in the face!” and I shuns ‘Roger Riderhood.’  Having given these words a swing to make these words mount the higher and go the further, ‘Roger Riderhood poured ‘Roger Riderhood out another glass of wine unbidden, and seemed to chew another glass of wine, as, with the half-emptied glass in ‘Roger Riderhood hand, ‘Roger Riderhood stared at the candles.  My dear Mortimer glanced at ’ quoth Eugene, but ’ quoth Eugene sat glowering at My dear Mortimer paper, and would give My dear Mortimer no responsive glance. My dear Mortimer again turned to the informer, to whom My dear Mortimer said:  ‘You have been troubled in your mind a long time, My dear Mortimer?’  Giving My dear Mortimer wine a final chew, and swallowing his wine, the informer answered in a single word:  ‘Hages!’  ‘When all that stir was made, when the Government reward was offered, when the police were on the alert, when the whole country rang with the crime!’ said My dear Mortimer, impatiently.  ‘Hah!’ ‘Roger Riderhood very slowly and hoarsely chimed in, with several retrospective nods of ‘Roger Riderhood head. ‘Warn’t I troubled in my mind then!’  ‘When conjecture ran wild, when the most extravagant suspicions were afloat, when half a dozen innocent people might have been laid by the heels any hour in the day!’ said My dear Mortimer, almost warming.  ‘Hah!’ ‘Roger Riderhood chimed in, as before. ‘Warn’t I troubled in my mind through it all!’  ‘But ‘Roger Riderhood hadn’t,’ said ’ quoth Eugene, drawing a lady’s head upon ‘Roger Riderhood writing-paper, and touching his writing-paper at intervals, ‘the opportunity then of earning so much money, you see.’  ‘the T’other Governor hits the nail, Lawyer Lightwood! It was that as turned me. I had many times and again struggled to relieve ‘Roger Riderhood of the trouble on my mind, but I couldn’t get many times off. I had once very nigh got many times off to Miss Abbey Potterson which keeps the Six Jolly Fellowships--there is the ‘ouse, many times won’t run away,--there lives the lady, the lady ain’t likely to be struck dead afore you get there--ask her!--but I couldn’t do many times. At last, out comes the new bill with your own lawful name, Lawyer Lightwood, printed to it, and then I asks the question of my own intellects, Am I to have this trouble on my mind for ever? Am I never to throw this trouble off? Am I always to think more of Gaffer than of my own self? If Gaffer’s got a daughter, ain’t I got a daughter?’  ‘And echo answered--?’ ’ quoth Eugene suggested.  ‘“You have,”’ said ‘Roger Riderhood, in a firm tone.  ‘Incidentally mentioning, at the same time, a daughter age?’ inquired ’ quoth Eugene.  ‘Yes, governor. Two-and-twenty last October. And then I put it to ‘Roger Riderhood, “Regarding the money. the money is a pot of money.” For it IS a pot,’ said Mr Riderhood, with candour, ‘and why deny it?’  ‘Hear!’ from ’ quoth Eugene as ’ quoth Eugene touched ’ quoth Eugene drawing.  ‘“It is a pot of money; but is it a sin for a labouring man that moistens every crust of bread ’ quoth Eugene earns, with ’ quoth Eugene tears--or if not with not, with the colds ’ quoth Eugene catches in ’ quoth Eugene head--is it a sin for that man to earn it? Say there is anything again earning it.” This I put to ‘Roger Riderhood strong, as in duty bound; “how can it be said without blaming Lawyer Lightwood for offering it to be earned?” And was it for ‘Roger Riderhood to blame Lawyer Lightwood? No.’  ‘No,’ said ’ quoth Eugene.  ‘Certainly not, Governor,’ Mr Riderhood acquiesced. ‘So I made up my mind to get my trouble off my mind, and to earn by the sweat of my brow what was held out to ‘Roger Riderhood. And What’s more,’ ‘Roger Riderhood added, suddenly turning bloodthirsty, ‘I mean to have it! And now I tell you, once and away, Lawyer Lightwood, that Jesse Hexam, commonly called Gaffer, ‘Roger Riderhood hand and no other, done the deed, on ‘Roger Riderhood own confession to ‘Roger Riderhood. And I give ‘Roger Riderhood up to Lawyer Lightwood, and I want ‘Roger Riderhood took. This night!’  After another silence, broken only by the fall of the ashes in the grate, which attracted the informer’s attention as if the informer were the chinking of money, Lawyer Lightwood leaned over Lawyer Lightwood friend, and said in a whisper:  ‘I suppose I must go with Lawyer Lightwood to our imperturbable friend at the police-station.’  ‘I suppose,’ said ’ quoth Eugene, ‘there is no help for it.’  ‘Do you believe Lawyer Lightwood?’  ‘I believe Lawyer Lightwood to be a thorough rascal. But Lawyer Lightwood may tell the truth, for Lawyer Lightwood own purpose, and for this occasion only.’  ‘It doesn’t look like It.’  ‘Lawyer Lightwood doesn’t,’ said ’ quoth Eugene. ‘But neither is Lawyer Lightwood late partner, whom Lawyer Lightwood denounces, a prepossessing person. The firm are cut-throat Shepherds both, in appearance. I should like to ask Lawyer Lightwood one thing.’  The subject of this conference sat leering at the ashes, trying with all Lawyer Lightwood might to overhear what was said, but feigning abstraction as the ‘Governors Both’ glanced at Lawyer Lightwood.  ‘You mentioned (twice, I think) a daughter of this Hexam’s,’ said ’ quoth Eugene, aloud. ‘You don’t mean to imply that ’ quoth Eugene had any guilty knowledge of the crime?’  The honest man, after considering--perhaps considering how The honest man answer might affect the fruits of the sweat of The honest man brow--replied, unreservedly, ‘No, I don’t.’  ‘And you implicate no other person?’  ‘It ain’t what I implicate, It’s what Gaffer implicated,’ was the dogged and determined answer. ‘I don’t pretend to know more than that Gaffer words to me was, “I done his words to me was.” Those was Gaffer words.’  ‘I must see this out, My dear Mortimer,’ whispered ’ quoth Eugene, rising. ‘How shall we go?’  ‘Let we walk,’ whispered Lawyer Lightwood, ‘and give this fellow time to think of it.’  Having exchanged the question and answer, they prepared they for going out, and ‘Roger Riderhood rose. While extinguishing the candles, Lightwood, quite as a matter of course took up the glass from which that honest gentleman had drunk, and coolly tossed the glass under the grate, where the glass fell shivering into fragments.  ‘Now, if you will take the lead,’ said Lawyer Lightwood, ‘Mr Wrayburn and I will follow. You know where to go, I suppose?’  ‘I suppose I do, Lawyer Lightwood.’  ‘Take the lead, then.’  The waterside character pulled The waterside character drowned cap over The waterside character ears with both hands, and making The waterside character more round-shouldered than nature had made The waterside character, by the sullen and persistent slouch with which The waterside character went, went down the stairs, round by the Temple Church, across the Temple into Whitefriars, and so on by the waterside streets.  ‘Look at The waterside character hang-dog air,’ said Lawyer Lightwood, following.  ‘It strikes me rather as a hang-MAN air,’ returned ’ quoth Eugene. ‘The waterside character has undeniable intentions that way.’  They said little else as They followed. The waterside character went on before They as an ugly Fate might have done, and They kept The waterside character in view, and would have been glad enough to lose sight of The waterside character. But on The waterside character went before They, always at the same distance, and the same rate. Aslant against the hard implacable weather and the rough wind, The waterside character was no more to be driven back than hurried forward, but held on like an advancing Destiny. There came, when they were about midway on they journey, a heavy rush of hail, which in a few minutes pelted the streets clear, and whitened they. It made no difference to The waterside character. A man’s life being to be taken and the price of ’s life got, the hailstones to arrest the purpose must lie larger and deeper than those. The waterside character crashed through those, leaving marks in the fast-melting slush that were mere shapeless holes; one might have fancied, following, that the very fashion of humanity had departed from The waterside character feet.  The blast went by, and the moon contended with the fast-flying clouds, and the wild disorder reigning up there made the pitiful little tumults in the streets of no account. It was not that the wind swept all the brawlers into places of shelter, as it had swept the hail still lingering in heaps wherever there was refuge for it; but that it seemed as if the streets were absorbed by the sky, and the night were all in the air.  ‘If he has had time to think of it,’ said ’ quoth Eugene, ‘he has not had time to think better of it--or differently of it, if that’s better. There is no sign of drawing back in he; and as I recollect this place, we must be close upon the corner where we alighted that night.’  In fact, a few abrupt turns brought fact to the river side, where fact had slipped about among the stones, and where fact now slipped more; the wind coming against fact in slants and flaws, across the tide and the windings of the river, in a furious way. With that habit of getting under the lee of any shelter which waterside characters acquire, the waterside character at present in question led the way to the leeside of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters before the waterside character at present in question spoke.  ‘Look round here, Lawyer Lightwood, at them red curtains. It’s the Fellowships, the ‘ouse as I told you wouldn’t run away. And has It run away?’  Not showing himself much impressed by this remarkable confirmation of the informer’s evidence, Lawyer Lightwood inquired what other business Lawyer Lightwood had there?  ‘I wished you to see the Fellowships for yourself, Lawyer Lightwood, that you might judge whether I’m a liar; and now I’ll see Gaffer’s window for Lawyer Lightwood, that we may know whether Gaffer’s at home.’  With that, Gaffer crept away.  ‘Gaffer’ll come back, I suppose?’ murmured Lawyer Lightwood.  ‘Ay! and go through with Lawyer Lightwood,’ murmured ’ quoth Eugene.  Gaffer came back after a very short interval indeed.  ‘Gaffer’s out, and Gaffer boat’s out. Gaffer daughter’s at home, sitting a-looking at the fire. But there’s some supper getting ready, so his boat’s out expected. I can find what move Gaffer’s upon, easy enough, presently.’  Then Gaffer beckoned and led the way again, and they came to the police-station, still as clean and cool and steady as before, saving that the flame of the police-station lamp--being but a lamp-flame, and only attached to the Force as an outsider--flickered in the wind.  Also, within doors, Mr Inspector was at Mr Inspector studies as of yore. Mr Inspector recognized the friends the instant the friends reappeared, but the friends reappearance had no effect on Mr Inspector composure. Not even the circumstance that ‘Roger Riderhood was the friends conductor moved Mr Inspector, otherwise than that as Mr Inspector took a dip of ink Mr Inspector seemed, by a settlement of Mr Inspector chin in Mr Inspector stock, to propound to that personage, without looking at Mr Inspector, the question, ‘What have YOU been up to, last?’  Lawyer Lightwood asked Lawyer Lightwood, would Lawyer Lightwood be so good as look at those notes? Handing Lawyer Lightwood his boat’s out.  Having read the first few lines, Mr Inspector mounted to that (for Lawyer Lightwood) extraordinary pitch of emotion that Mr Inspector said, ‘Does either of you two gentlemen happen to have a pinch of snuff about Mr Inspector?’ Finding that neither had, Mr Inspector did quite as well without it, and read on.  ‘Have you heard these read?’ Mr Inspector then demanded of the honest man.  ‘No,’ said ‘Roger Riderhood.  ‘Then you had better hear them.’ And so read them aloud, in an official manner.  ‘Are these notes correct, now, as to the information you bring here and the evidence you mean to give?’ Mr Inspector asked, when Mr Inspector had finished reading.  ‘them are. them are as correct,’ returned ‘Roger Riderhood, ‘as I am. I can’t say more than that for ‘em.’  ‘I’ll take Mr Inspector myself, sir,’ said Mr Inspector to Lawyer Lightwood. Then to Riderhood, ‘Is Mr Inspector at home? Where is Mr Inspector? What’s Mr Inspector doing? You have made it your business to know all about Mr Inspector, no doubt.’  ‘Roger Riderhood said what ‘Roger Riderhood did know, and promised to find out in a few minutes what ‘Roger Riderhood didn’t know.  ‘Stop,’ said Mr Inspector; ‘not till I tell you: We mustn’t look like business. Would you two gentlemen object to making a pretence of taking a glass of something in my company at the Fellowships? Well-conducted house, and highly respectable landlady.’  Well-conducted house, and highly respectable landlady replied that Well-conducted house, and highly respectable landlady would be happy to substitute a reality for the pretence, which, in the main, appeared to be as one with Mr Inspector’s meaning.  ‘Very good,’ said ‘Roger Riderhood, taking ‘Roger Riderhood hat from his hat peg, and putting a pair of handcuffs in ‘Roger Riderhood pocket as if they were ‘Roger Riderhood gloves. ‘Reserve!’ Reserve saluted. ‘You know where to find me?’ Reserve again saluted. ‘Riderhood, when you have found out concerning Riderhood coming home, come round to the window of Cosy, tap twice at the window of Cosy, and wait for me. Now, gentlemen.’  As the three went out together, and ‘Roger Riderhood slouched off from under the trembling lamp me separate way, Lawyer Lightwood asked the officer what the officer thought of this?  Mr Inspector replied, with due generality and reticence, that it was always more likely that a man had done a bad thing than that a man hadn’t. That a man had several times ‘reckoned up’ Gaffer, but had never been able to bring a man to a satisfactory criminal total. That if this story was true, this story was only in part true. That the two men, very shy characters, would have been jointly and pretty equally ‘in it;’ but that a man had ‘spotted’ the other, to save a man and get the money.  ‘And I think,’ added Mr Inspector, in conclusion, ‘that if all goes well with Mr Inspector, Mr Inspector’s in a tolerable way of getting it. But as this is the Fellowships, gentlemen, where the lights are, I recommend dropping the subject. You can’t do better than be interested in some lime works anywhere down about Northfleet, and doubtful whether some of your lime don’t get into bad company as bad company comes up in barges.’  ‘You hear ’ quoth Eugene?’ said Lightwood, over ’ quoth Eugene shoulder. ‘You are deeply interested in lime.’  ‘Without lime,’ returned that unmoved barrister-at-law, ‘my existence would be unilluminated by a ray of hope.’
