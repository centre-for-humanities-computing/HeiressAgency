 A DISMAL SWAMP   And now, in the blooming summer days, behold Mr and Mrs Boffin established in the eminently aristocratic family mansion, and behold all manner of crawling, creeping, fluttering, and buzzing creatures, attracted by the gold dust of the Golden Dustman!
Foremost among those leaving cards at the eminently aristocratic door before it is quite painted, are the Veneerings: out of breath, one might imagine, from the impetuosity of their rush to the eminently aristocratic steps.
One copper-plate Mrs Veneering, two copper-plate Mr Veneerings, and a connubial copper-plate Mr and Mrs Veneering, requesting the honour of Mr and Mrs Boffin’s company at dinner with the utmost Analytical solemnities.
The enchanting Lady Tippins leaves a card.
Twemlow leaves cards.
A tall custard-coloured phaeton tooling up in a solemn manner leaves four cards, to wit, a couple of Mr Podsnaps, a Mrs Podsnap, and a Miss Podsnap.
All the world and his wife and daughter leave cards.
Sometimes his wife and daughter has so many daughters, that his wife and daughter card reads rather like a Miscellaneous Lot at an Auction; comprising Mrs Tapkins, Miss Tapkins, Miss Frederica Tapkins, Miss Antonina Tapkins, Miss Malvina Tapkins, and Miss Euphemia Tapkins; at the same time, The enchanting Lady Tippins leaves the card of Mrs Henry George Alfred Swoshle, NEE Tapkins; also, a card, Mrs Tapkins at Home, Wednesdays, Music, Portland Place.
Miss Bella Wilfer becomes an inmate, for an indefinite period, of the eminently aristocratic dwelling.
Mrs Boffin bears Miss Bella away to Mrs Boffin Milliner’s and Dressmaker’s, and Mrs Boffin gets beautifully dressed.
The Veneerings find with swift remorse that they have omitted to invite Miss Bella WilferMiss Bella Wilfer.
One Mrs Veneering and one Mr and Mrs Veneering requesting that additional honour, instantly do penance in white cardboard on the hall table.
Mrs Tapkins likewise discovers Mrs Tapkins omission, and with promptitude repairs her omission; for Mrs Tapkins; for Miss Tapkins, for Miss Frederica Tapkins, for Miss Antonina Tapkins, for Miss Malvina Tapkins, and for Miss Euphemia Tapkins.
Likewise, for Mrs Tapkins.
Likewise, for Mrs Tapkins at Home, Wednesdays, Music, Portland Place.
Tradesmen’s books hunger, and tradesmen’s mouths water, for the gold dust of the Golden Dustman.
As Mrs Boffin and Miss Wilfer drive out, or as Mr Boffin walks out at Mr Boffin jog-trot pace, the fishmonger pulls off Mr Boffin hat with an air of reverence founded on conviction.
Mr Boffin men cleanse His men fingers on His men woollen aprons before presuming to touch His men foreheads to Mr Boffin or Lady.
The gaping salmon and the golden mullet lying on the slab seem to turn up The gaping salmon and the golden mullet lying on the slab eyes sideways, as The gaping salmon and the golden mullet lying on the slab would turn up The gaping salmon and the golden mullet lying on the slab hands if The gaping salmon and the golden mullet lying on the slab had any, in worshipping admiration.
The butcher, though a portly and a prosperous man, doesn’t know what to do with The butcher; so anxious is The butcher to express humility when discovered by the passing Boffins taking the air in a mutton grove.
Presents are made to the Boffin servants, and bland strangers with business-cards meeting said servants in the street, offer hypothetical corruption.
As, ‘Supposing I was to be favoured with an order from Mr Boffin, my dear friend, it would be worth my while’--to do a certain thing that I hope might not prove wholly disagreeable to your feelings.
But no one knows so well as the Secretary, who opens and reads the letters, what a set is made at the man marked by a stroke of notoriety.
Oh the varieties of dust for ocular use, offered in exchange for the gold dust of the Golden Dustman!
Fifty-seven churches to be erected with half-crowns, forty-two parsonage houses to be repaired with shillings, seven-and-twenty organs to be built with halfpence, twelve hundred children to be brought up on postage stamps.
Not that a half-crown, shilling, halfpenny, or postage stamp, would be particularly acceptable from Mr Boffin, but that it is so obvious Mr Boffin is the man to make up the deficiency.
And then the charities, my Christian brother!
And mostly in difficulties, yet mostly lavish, too, in the expensive articles of print and paper.
Large fat private double letter, sealed with ducal coronet.
‘Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire.
My Dear Sir,--Having consented to preside at the forthcoming Annual Dinner of the Family Party Fund, and feeling deeply impressed with the immense usefulness of that noble Institution and the great importance of My Dear Sir,--Having being supported by a List of Stewards that shall prove to the public the interest taken in My Dear Sir,--Having by popular and distinguished men, I have undertaken to ask you to become a Steward on that occasion.
Soliciting your favourable reply before the 14th instant, I am, My Dear Sir, Your faithful Servant, LINSEED.
P.S.
The a Steward’s fee is limited to three Guineas.’ Friendly this, on the part of the Duke of Linseed (and thoughtful in the postscript), only lithographed by the hundred and presenting but a pale individuality of an address to Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, in quite another hand.
It takes two noble Earls and a Viscount, combined, to inform Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, in an equally flattering manner, that an estimable lady in the West of England has offered to present a purse containing twenty pounds, to the Society for Granting Annuities to Unassuming Members of the Middle Classes, if twenty individuals will previously present purses of one hundred pounds each.
And those benevolent noblemen very kindly point out that if Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, should wish to present two or more purses, it will not be inconsistent with the design of the estimable lady in the West of EnglandEngland, provided each purse be coupled with the name of some member of his honoured and respected family.
These are the corporate beggars.
But there are, besides, the individual beggars; and how does the heart of the Secretary fail his when his has to cope with the individual beggars!
And the individual beggars must be coped with to some extent, because the individual beggars enclose documents (the individual beggars call the individual beggars scraps documents; but the individual beggars are, as to papers deserving the name, what minced veal is to a calf), the non-return of which would be the individual beggars ruin.
That is say, the individual beggars are utterly ruined now, but the individual beggars would be more utterly ruined then.
Among these correspondents are several daughters of general officers, long accustomed to every luxury of life (except spelling), who little thought, when these correspondents gallant fathers waged war in the Peninsula, that these correspondents would ever have to appeal to those whom Providence, in Providence inscrutable wisdom, has blessed with untold gold, and from among whom these correspondents select the name of Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, for a maiden effort in this wise, understanding that he has such a heart as never was.
The Secretary learns, too, that confidence between man and wife would seem to obtain but rarely when virtue is in distress, so numerous are the wives who take up man and wife pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of man and wife devoted husbands, who would never permit it; while, on the other hand, so numerous are the husbands who take up man and wife pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of man and wife devoted wives, who would instantly go out of man and wife senses if man and wife had the least suspicion of the circumstance.
There are the inspired beggars, too.
the inspired beggars were sitting, only yesterday evening, musing over a fragment of candle which must soon go out and leave the inspired beggars in the dark for the rest of the inspired beggars nights, when surely some Angel whispered the name of Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, to Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire souls, imparting rays of hope, nay confidence, to which Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire had long been strangers!
Akin to Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire are the suggestively-befriended beggars.
Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire were partaking of a cold potato and water by the flickering and gloomy light of a lucifer-match, in Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire lodgings (rent considerably in arrear, and heartless landlady threatening expulsion ‘like a dog’ into the streets), when a gifted friend happening to look in, said, ‘Write immediately to Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire,’ and would take no denial.
There are the nobly independent beggars too.
the nobly independent beggars, in the days of the nobly independent beggars abundance, ever regarded gold as dross, and have not yet got over that only impediment in the way of the nobly independent beggars amassing wealth, but the nobly independent beggars want no dross from Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire; No, Mr Boffin; the world may term it pride, paltry pride if you will, but paltry pride wouldn’t take it if you offered it; a loan, sir--for fourteen weeks to the day, interest calculated at the rate of five per cent per annum, to be bestowed upon any charitable institution you may name--is all paltry pride want of you, and if you have the meanness to refuse it, count on being despised by these great spirits.
There are the beggars of punctual business-habits too.
the beggars of punctual business-habits will make an end of the beggars of punctual business-habits at a quarter to one P.M. on Tuesday, if no Post-office order is in the interim received from Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire; arriving after a quarter to one P.M. on Tuesday, it need not be sent, as the beggars of punctual business-habits will then (having made an exact memorandum of the heartless circumstances) be ‘cold in death.’ There are the beggars on horseback too, in another sense from the sense of the proverb.
These are mounted and ready to start on the highway to affluence.
The goal is before These, the road is in the best condition, These spurs are on, the steed is willing, but, at the last moment, for want of some special thing--a clock, a violin, an astronomical telescope, an electrifying machine--These must dismount for ever, unless These receive its equivalent in money from Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire.
Less given to detail are the beggars who make sporting ventures.
These, usually to be addressed in reply under initials at a country post-office, inquire in feminine hands, Dare one who cannot disclose herself to Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, but whose name might startle Nicodemus Boffin were whose name revealed, solicit the immediate advance of two hundred pounds from unexpected riches exercising their noblest privilege in the trust of a common humanity?
In such a Dismal Swamp does the new house stand, and through whose name does The Secretary daily struggle breast-high.
Not to mention all the people alive who have made inventions that won’t act, and all the jobbers who job in all the jobberies jobbed; though these may be regarded as the Alligators of the Dismal Swamp, and are always lying by to drag the Golden Dustman under.
But the old house.
There are no designs against the Golden Dustman?
There are no fish of the shark tribe in the Bower waters?
Perhaps not.
Still, Wegg is established there, and would seem, judged by Wegg secret proceedings, to cherish a notion of making a discovery.
For, when a man with a wooden leg lies prone on a man with a wooden leg stomach to peep under bedsteads; and hops up ladders, like some extinct bird, to survey the tops of presses and cupboards; and provides a man with a wooden leg an iron rod which a man with a wooden leg is always poking and prodding into dust-mounds; the probability is that a man with a wooden leg expects to find something.
