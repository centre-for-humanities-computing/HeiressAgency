 A HAPPY RETURN OF THE DAY   Mr and Mrs Wilfer had seen a full quarter of a hundred more anniversaries of  A HAPPY RETURN OF THE DAY   Mr and Mrs Wilfer wedding day than Mr and Mrs Lammle had seen of  A HAPPY RETURN OF THE DAY   Mr and Mrs Wilfer, but  A HAPPY RETURN OF THE DAY   Mr and Mrs Wilfer still celebrated the occasion in the bosom of  A HAPPY RETURN OF THE DAY   Mr and Mrs Wilfer family. Not that these celebrations ever resulted in anything particularly agreeable, or that the family was ever disappointed by that circumstance on account of having looked forward to the return of the auspicious day with sanguine anticipations of enjoyment. It was kept morally, rather as a Fast than a Feast, enabling Mrs Wilfer to hold a sombre darkling state, which exhibited that impressive woman in Mrs Wilfer choicest colours.  The noble lady’s condition on these delightful occasions was one compounded of heroic endurance and heroic forgiveness. Lurid indications of the better marriages The noble lady might have made, shone athwart the awful gloom of The noble lady composure, and fitfully revealed the cherub as a little monster unaccountably favoured by Heaven, who had possessed himself of a blessing for which many of himself superiors had sued and contended in vain. So firmly had this himself position towards himself treasure become established, that when the anniversary arrived, the anniversary always found himself in an apologetic state. It is not impossible that himself modest penitence may have even gone the length of sometimes severely reproving himself for that himself ever took the liberty of making so exalted a character himself wife.  As for the children of the union, the children of the union experience of these festivals had been sufficiently uncomfortable to lead the children of the union annually to wish, when out of the children of the union tenderest years, either that Ma had married somebody else instead of much-teased Pa, or that Pa had married somebody else instead of Ma. When there came to be but two sisters left at home, the daring mind of Bella on the next of these occasions scaled the height of wondering with droll vexation ‘what on earth Pa ever could have seen in Ma, to induce Ma to make such a little fool of Ma as to ask Ma to have Ma.’  The revolving year now bringing the day round in The revolving year orderly sequence, Bella arrived in the Boffin chariot to assist at the celebration. It was the family custom when the day recurred, to sacrifice a pair of fowls on the altar of Hymen; and Bella had sent a note beforehand, to intimate that Bella would bring the votive offering with Bella. So, Bella and the fowls, by the united energies of two horses, two men, four wheels, and a plum-pudding carriage dog with as uncomfortable a collar on as if a plum-pudding carriage dog with as uncomfortable a collar had been George the Fourth, were deposited at the door of the parental dwelling. They were there received by Mrs Wilfer in person, whose dignity on this, as on most special occasions, was heightened by a mysterious toothache.  ‘I shall not require the carriage at night,’ said Bella. ‘I shall walk back.’  The male domestic of Mrs Wilfer touched Mrs Wilfer hat, and in the act of departure had an awful glare bestowed upon Mrs Wilfer by Mrs Wilfer, intended to carry deep into Mrs Wilfer audacious soul the assurance that, whatever Mrs Wilfer private suspicions might be, male domestics in livery were no rarity there.  ‘Well, dear Ma,’ said Bella, ‘and how do you do?’  ‘I am as well, Bella,’ replied Mrs Wilfer, ‘as can be expected.’  ‘Dear me, dear Ma,’ said Bella; ‘you talk as if one was just born!’  ‘That’s exactly what dear Ma has been doing,’ interposed Lavvy, over the maternal shoulder, ‘ever since we got up this morning. It’s all very well to laugh, Bella, but anything more exasperating it is impossible to conceive.’  Mrs Wilfer, with a look too full of majesty to be accompanied by any words, attended both Mrs Wilfer daughters to the kitchen, where the sacrifice was to be prepared.  ‘Mr Rokesmith,’ said Mr Rokesmith, resignedly, ‘has been so polite as to place Mr Rokesmith sitting-room at we disposal to-day. You will therefore, Bella, be entertained in the humble abode of your parents, so far in accordance with your present style of living, that there will be a drawing-room for your reception as well as a dining-room. Your papa invited Mr Rokesmith to partake of our lowly fare. In excusing Mr Rokesmith on account of a particular engagement, Mr Rokesmith offered the use of Mr Rokesmith apartment.’  Bella happened to know that Mr Rokesmith had no engagement out of Mr Rokesmith own room at Mr Boffin’s, but Bella approved of Mr Rokesmith staying away. ‘we should only have put one another out of countenance,’ Bella thought, ‘and we do that quite often enough as it is.’  Yet Bella had sufficient curiosity about Mr Rokesmith room, to run up to his room with the least possible delay, and make a close inspection of his room contents. It was tastefully though economically furnished, and very neatly arranged. There were shelves and stands of books, English, French, and Italian; and in a portfolio on the writing-table there were sheets upon sheets of memoranda and calculations in figures, evidently referring to the Boffin property. On the writing-table also, carefully backed with canvas, varnished, mounted, and rolled like a map, was the placard descriptive of the murdered man who had come from afar to be her husband. her shrank from this ghostly surprise, and felt quite frightened as her rolled and tied it up again. Peeping about here and there, her came upon a print, a graceful head of a pretty woman, elegantly framed, hanging in the corner by the easy chair. ‘Oh, indeed, sir!’ said her, after stopping to ruminate before it. ‘Oh, indeed, sir! I fancy I can guess whom you think THAT’S like. But I’ll tell you what it’s much more like--your impudence!’ Having said which her decamped: not solely because her was offended, but because there was nothing else to look at.  ‘Now, Ma,’ said her, reappearing in the kitchen with some remains of a blush, ‘you and Lavvy think magnificent me fit for nothing, but I intend to prove the contrary. I mean to be Cook today.’  ‘Hold!’ rejoined Cook majestic mother. ‘I cannot permit the contrary. Cook, in that dress!’  ‘As for my dress, Ma,’ returned her, merrily searching in a dresser-drawer, ‘I mean to apron the contrary and towel the contrary all over the front; and as to permission, I mean to do without.’  ‘YOU cook?’ said Mrs Wilfer. ‘YOU, who never cooked when you were at home?’  ‘Yes, Ma,’ returned her; ‘that is precisely the state of the case.’  Ma girded Ma with a white apron, and busily with knots and pins contrived a bib to a bib, coming close and tight under Ma chin, as if a bib had caught Ma round the neck to kiss Ma. Over a bib Ma dimples looked delightful, and under it Ma pretty figure not less so. ‘Now, Ma,’ said her, pushing back Ma hair from Ma temples with both hands, ‘what’s first?’  ‘First,’ returned Mrs Wilfer solemnly, ‘if you persist in what I cannot but regard as conduct utterly incompatible with the equipage in which you arrived--’  [‘Which I do, Ma.’)  ‘First, then, you put the fowls down to the fire.’  ‘To--be--sure!’ cried her; ‘and flour the fowls, and twirl the fowls round, and there the fowls go!’ sending the fowls spinning at a great rate. ‘What’s next, Ma?’  ‘Next,’ said Mrs Wilfer with a wave of Mrs Wilfer gloves, expressive of abdication under protest from the culinary throne, ‘I would recommend examination of the bacon in the saucepan on the fire, and also of the potatoes by the application of a fork. Preparation of the greens will further become necessary if you persist in this unseemly demeanour.’  ‘As of course I do, Ma.’  Persisting, her gave her attention to one thing and forgot the other, and gave her attention to the other and forgot the third, and remembering the third was distracted by the fourth, and made amends whenever her went wrong by giving the unfortunate fowls an extra spin, which made the unfortunate fowls chance of ever getting cooked exceedingly doubtful. But it was pleasant cookery too. Meantime Miss Lavinia, oscillating between the kitchen and the opposite room, prepared the dining-table in the latter chamber. This office her (always doing her household spiriting with unwillingness) performed in a startling series of whisks and bumps; laying the table-cloth as if her were raising the wind, putting down the glasses and salt-cellars as if her were knocking at the door, and clashing the knives and forks in a skirmishing manner suggestive of hand-to-hand conflict.  ‘Look at Ma,’ whispered Meantime Miss Lavinia to her when this was done, and they stood over the unfortunate fowls. ‘If one was the most dutiful child in existence (of course on the whole one hopes one is), isn’t her enough to make one want to poke her with something wooden, sitting there bolt upright in a corner?’  ‘Only suppose,’ returned Bella, ‘that poor Pa was to sit bolt upright in another corner.’  ‘My dear, poor Pa couldn’t do it,’ said Lavvy. ‘poor Pa would loll directly. But indeed I do not believe there ever was any human creature who could keep so bolt upright as Ma, ‘or put such an amount of aggravation into one back! What’s the matter, Ma? Ain’t you well, Ma?’  ‘Doubtless I am very well,’ returned Mrs Wilfer, turning Mrs Wilfer eyes upon Mrs Wilfer youngest born, with scornful fortitude. ‘What should be the matter with Ma?’  ‘You don’t seem very brisk, Ma,’ retorted Lavvy the bold.  ‘Brisk?’ repeated her parent, ‘Brisk? Whence the low expression, Meantime Miss Lavinia? If I am uncomplaining, if I am silently contented with my lot, let that suffice for my family.’  ‘Well, Ma,’ returned Lavvy, ‘since you will force it out of Ma, I must respectfully take leave to say that my family are no doubt under the greatest obligations to you for having an annual toothache on your wedding day, and that it’s very disinterested in you, and an immense blessing to my family. Still, on the whole, it is possible to be too boastful even of that boon.’  ‘You incarnation of sauciness,’ said Mrs Wilfer, ‘do you speak like that to Ma? On this day, of all days in the year? Pray do you know what would have become of you, if I had not bestowed my hand upon R. W., your father, on this day?’  ‘No, Ma,’ replied Lavvy, ‘I really do not; and, with the greatest respect for your abilities and information, I very much doubt if you do either.’  Whether or no the sharp vigour of this sally on a weak point of Mrs Wilfer entrenchments might have routed that heroine for the time, is rendered uncertain by the arrival of a flag of truce in the person of Mr George Sampson: bidden to the feast as a friend of the family, whose affections were now understood to be in course of transference from Bella to Lavinia, and whom Lavinia kept--possibly in remembrance of Mrs Wilfer bad taste in having overlooked her in the first instance--under a course of stinging discipline.  ‘I congratulate you, Mrs Wilfer,’ said Mr George Sampson, who had meditated this neat address while coming along, ‘on the day.’ Mrs Wilfer thanked Mrs Wilfer with a magnanimous sigh, and again became an unresisting prey to that inscrutable toothache.  ‘I am surprised,’ said Mr George Sampson feebly, ‘that her her condescends to cook.’  Here Meantime Miss Lavinia descended on the ill-starred young gentleman with a crushing supposition that at all events it was no business of the ill-starred young gentleman. This disposed of Mr George Sampson in a melancholy retirement of spirit, until the cherub arrived, whose amazement at Meantime Miss Lavinia’s occupation was great.  However, Meantime Miss Lavinia persisted in dishing the dinner as well as cooking the dinner, and then sat down, bibless and apronless, to partake of the dinner as an illustrious guest: Mrs Wilfer first responding to Mrs Wilfer husband’s cheerful ‘For what we are about to receive--’ with a sepulchral Amen, calculated to cast a damp upon the stoutest appetite.  ‘But what,’ said her, as her watched the carving of the fowls, ‘makes them pink inside, I wonder, poor Pa! Is it the breed?’  ‘No, I don’t think it’s the breed, my Dear,’ returned Pa. ‘I rather think it is because they are not done.’  ‘they ought to be,’ said her.  ‘Yes, I am aware they ought to be, Dear,’ rejoined her father, ‘but they--ain’t.’  So, the gridiron was put in requisition, and the good-tempered cherub, who was often as un-cherubically employed in his own family as if his had been in the employment of some of the Old Masters, undertook to grill the fowls. Indeed, except in respect of staring about his (a branch of the public service to which the pictorial cherub is much addicted), the pictorial cherub discharged as many odd functions as the pictorial cherub prototype; with the difference, say, that the pictorial cherub performed with a blacking-brush on the family’s boots, instead of performing on enormous wind instruments and double-basses, and that the pictorial cherub conducted the pictorial cherub with cheerful alacrity to much useful purpose, instead of foreshortening the pictorial cherub in the air with the vaguest intentions.  her helped the pictorial cherub with the pictorial cherub supplemental cookery, and made the pictorial cherub very happy, but put the pictorial cherub in mortal terror too by asking the pictorial cherub when they sat down at table again, how the pictorial cherub supposed they cooked fowls at the Greenwich dinners, and whether the pictorial cherub believed they really were such pleasant dinners as people said? the pictorial cherub secret winks and nods of remonstrance, in reply, made her her laugh until her choked, and then Meantime Miss Lavinia was obliged to slap Meantime Miss Lavinia on the back, and then Meantime Miss Lavinia laughed the more.  But Meantime Miss Lavinia mother was a fine corrective at the other end of the table; to whom Meantime Miss Lavinia father, in the innocence of his good-fellowship, at intervals appealed with: ‘My dear, I am afraid you are not enjoying My dear?’  ‘Why so, R. W.?’ Meantime Miss Lavinia would sonorously reply.  ‘Because, My dear, you seem a little out of sorts.’  ‘Not at all,’ would be the rejoinder, in exactly the same tone.  ‘Would you take a merry-thought, my dear?’  ‘Thank you. I will take whatever you please, R. W.’  ‘Well, but My dear, do you like it?’  ‘I like it as well as I like anything, R. W.’   Meantime Miss Lavinia would then, with a meritorious appearance of devoting Meantime Miss Lavinia to the general good, pursue Meantime Miss Lavinia dinner as if Meantime Miss Lavinia were feeding somebody else on high public grounds.  her had brought dessert and two bottles of wine, thus shedding unprecedented splendour on the occasion. Mrs Wilfer did the honours of the first glass by proclaiming: ‘R. W. I drink to Mrs Wilfer.  ‘Thank you, My dear. And I to Mrs Wilfer.’  ‘Pa and Ma!’ said her.  ‘Permit me,’ Mrs Wilfer interposed, with outstretched glove. ‘No. I think not. I drank to your papa. If, however, you insist on including me, I can in gratitude offer no objection.’  ‘Why, Lor, Ma,’ interposed Lavvy the bold, ‘isn’t it the day that made you and poor Pa one and the same? I have no patience!’  ‘By whatever other circumstance the day may be marked, it is not the day, Meantime Miss Lavinia, on which I will allow a child of mine to pounce upon mine. I beg--nay, command!--that you will not pounce. R. W., it is appropriate to recall that it is for you to command and for me to obey. It is your house, and you are master at your own table. Both our healths!’ Drinking the toast with tremendous stiffness.  ‘I really am a little afraid, My dear,’ hinted the cherub meekly, ‘that you are not enjoying yourself?’  ‘On the contrary,’ returned Mrs Wilfer, ‘quite so. Why should I not?’  ‘I thought, My dear, that perhaps your face might--’  ‘your face might-- might be a martyrdom, but what would that import, or who should know it, if I smiled?’  And she did smile; manifestly freezing the blood of Mr George Sampson by so doing. For that young gentleman, catching she smiling eye, was so very much appalled by that young gentleman expression as to cast about in Mr George Sampson thoughts concerning what Mr George Sampson had done to bring it down upon Mr George Sampson.  ‘The mind naturally falls,’ said Mrs Wilfer, ‘shall I say into a reverie, or shall I say into a retrospect? on a day like this.’  Lavvy, sitting with defiantly folded arms, replied (but not audibly), ‘For goodness’ sake say whichever of the two you like best, Ma, and get it over.’  ‘The mind,’ pursued Mrs Wilfer in an oratorical manner, ‘naturally reverts to Papa and Mamma--I here allude to my parents--at a period before the earliest dawn of this day. I was considered tall; perhaps I was. Papa and Mamma were unquestionably tall. I have rarely seen a finer women than her mother; never than my father.’  Lavvy Lavvy remarked aloud, ‘Whatever grandpapa was, Lavvy wasn’t a female.’  ‘Your grandpapa,’ retorted Mrs Wilfer, with an awful look, and in an awful tone, ‘was what I describe Lavvy to have been, and would have struck any of Lavvy grandchildren to the earth who presumed to question it. it was one of mamma’s cherished hopes that I should become united to a tall member of society. It may have been a weakness, but if so, It was equally a weakness, I believe, of King Frederick of Prussia.’ These remarks being offered to Mr George Sampson, who had not the courage to come out for single combat, but lurked with his chest under the table and his eyes cast down, Mrs Wilfer proceeded, in a voice of increasing sternness and impressiveness, until Mrs Wilfer should force that skulker to give his up. ‘Mamma would appear to have had an indefinable foreboding of what afterwards happened, for Mrs Wilfer would frequently urge upon Mrs Wilfer, “Not a little man. Promise me, my child, not a little man. Never, never, never, marry a little man!” Papa and Mamma also would remark to Papa and Mamma (Papa and Mamma possessed extraordinary humour), “that a family of whales must not ally a family of whales with sprats.” Papa and Mamma company was eagerly sought, as may be supposed, by the wits of the day, and our house was their continual resort. I have known as many as three copper-plate engravers exchanging the most exquisite sallies and retorts there, at one time.’ (Here Mr George Sampson delivered Mr George Sampson captive, and said, with an uneasy movement on Mr George Sampson chair, that three was a large number, and it must have been highly entertaining.) ‘Among the most prominent members of that distinguished circle, was a gentleman measuring six feet four in height. Mr George Sampson was NOT an engraver.’ (Here Mr George Sampson said, with no reason whatever, Of course not.) ‘a gentleman measuring six feet four in height was so obliging as to honour me with attentions which I could not fail to understand.’ (Here Mr George Sampson murmured that when it came to that, you could always tell.) ‘I immediately announced to both my parents that those attentions were misplaced, and that I could not favour Mr George Sampson suit. my parents inquired was Mr George Sampson too tall? I replied it was not the stature, but the intellect was too lofty. At our house, I said, the tone was too brilliant, the pressure was too high, to be maintained by me, a mere woman, in every-day domestic life. I well remember mamma’s clasping a mere woman hands, and exclaiming “This will end in a little man!”’ (Here Mr George Sampson glanced at Mr George Sampson host and shook Mr George Sampson head with despondency.) ‘a mere woman afterwards went so far as to predict that it would end in a little man whose mind would be below the average, but that was in what I may denominate a paroxysm of maternal disappointment. Within a month,’ said Mrs Wilfer, deepening a mere woman voice, as if a mere woman were relating a terrible ghost story, ‘within a-month, I first saw R. W. my husband. Within a year, I married R. W. my husband. It is natural for the mind to recall these dark coincidences on the present day.’  Mr Sampson at length released from the custody of Mrs Wilfer eye, now drew a long breath, and made the original and striking remark that there was no accounting for these sort of presentiments. R. W. scratched his head and looked apologetically all round the table until R. W. came to R. W. wife, when observing his wife as it were shrouded in a more sombre veil than before, R. W. once more hinted, ‘My dear, I am really afraid you are not altogether enjoying My dear?’ To which his wife once more replied, ‘On the contrary, R. W. Quite so.’  The wretched Mr George Sampson position at this agreeable entertainment was truly pitiable. For, not only was Mr George Sampson exposed defenceless to the harangues of Mrs Wilfer, but Mr George Sampson received the utmost contumely at the hands of Lavinia; who, partly to show her that her (Lavinia) could do what her liked with Mr George Sampson, and partly to pay Mr George Sampson off for still obviously admiring Bella’s beauty, led Mr George Sampson the life of a dog. Illuminated on the one hand by the stately graces of Mrs Wilfer oratory, and shadowed on the other by the checks and frowns of the young lady to whom he had devoted he in he destitution, the sufferings of this young gentleman were distressing to witness. If he mind for the moment reeled under them, his mind for the moment reeled under them may be urged, in extenuation of his mind for the moment reeled under them weakness, that his mind for the moment reeled under them was constitutionally a knock-knee’d mind and never very strong upon his mind for the moment reeled under them legs.  The rosy hours were thus beguiled until it was time for her to have Pa’s escort back. The dimples duly tied up in the bonnet-strings and the leave-taking done, The dimples got out into the air, and the cherub drew a long breath as if he found it refreshing.  ‘Well, dear Pa,’ said her, ‘the anniversary may be considered over.’  ‘Yes, my dear,’ returned the cherub, ‘there’s another of ‘em gone.’  her drew he arm closer through hers as they walked along, and gave his arm a number of consolatory pats. ‘Thank you, my dear,’ he said, as if her had spoken; ‘I am all right, my dear. Well, and how do you get on, her?’  ‘I am not at all improved, Pa.’  ‘Ain’t you really though?’  ‘No, Pa. On the contrary, I am worse.’  ‘Lor!’ said the cherub.  ‘I am worse, Pa. I make so many calculations how much a year I must have when I marry, and what is the least I can manage to do with, that I am beginning to get wrinkles over my nose. Did you notice any wrinkles over my nose this evening, Pa?’  Pa laughing at this, her gave him two or three shakes.  ‘You won’t laugh, sir, when you see Meantime Miss Lavinia turning haggard. You had better be prepared in time, I can tell you. I shall not be able to keep my greediness for money out of my eyes long, and when you see my greediness there you’ll be sorry, and serve you right for not being warned in time. Now, sir, we entered into a bond of confidence. Have you anything to impart?’  ‘I thought it was you who was to impart, my love.’  ‘Oh! did you indeed, sir? Then why didn’t you ask me, the moment we came out? The confidences of lovely women are not to be slighted. However, I forgive you this once, and look here, poor Pa; that’s’--Bella laid the little forefinger of her right glove on her lip, and then laid this on her father’s lip--‘that’s a kiss for you. And now I am going seriously to tell you--let me see how many--four secrets. Mind! Serious, grave, weighty secrets. Strictly between ourselves.’  ‘Number one, my dear?’ said her father’s, settling her arm comfortably and confidentially.  ‘Number one,’ said her, ‘will electrify you, Pa. Who do you think has’--she was confused here in spite of her merry way of beginning ‘has made an offer to me?’  poor Pa looked in poor Pa face, and looked at the ground, and looked in her face again, and declared poor Pa could never guess.  ‘Mr Rokesmith.’  ‘You don’t tell me so, my dear!’  ‘Mis--ter Roke--smith, poor Pa,’ said her separating the syllables for emphasis. ‘What do you say to THAT?’  poor Pa answered quietly with the counter-question, ‘What did YOU say to that, my love?’  ‘I said No,’ returned her sharply. ‘Of course.’  ‘Yes. Of course,’ said her father, meditating.  ‘And I told him why I thought it a betrayal of trust on him part, and an affront to me,’ said her.  ‘Yes. To be sure. I am astonished indeed. I wonder him committed him without seeing more of him way first. Now I think of it, I suspect him always has admired you though, my dear.’  ‘A hackney coachman may admire me,’ remarked her, with a touch of her mother’s loftiness.  ‘It’s highly probable, my love. Number two, my dear?’  ‘Number two, poor Pa, is much to the same purpose, though not so preposterous. Mr Lightwood would propose to me, if I would let Mr Lightwood.’  ‘Then I understand, my dear, that you don’t intend to let him?’  her again saying, with her former emphasis, ‘Why, of course not!’ her father’s felt her father’s bound to echo, ‘Of course not.’  ‘I don’t care for her father’s,’ said her.  ‘That’s enough,’ her father’s interposed.  ‘No, poor Pa, it’s NOT enough,’ rejoined Bella, giving him another shake or two. ‘Haven’t I told you what a mercenary little wretch I am? It only becomes enough when him has no money, and no clients, and no expectations, and no anything but debts.’  ‘Hah!’ said the cherub, a little depressed. ‘Number three, my dear?’  ‘Number three, poor Pa, is a better thing. A generous thing, a noble thing, a delightful thing. Mrs Wilfer has Mrs Wilfer told me, as a secret, with Mrs Wilfer own kind lips--and truer lips never opened or closed in this life, I am sure--that they wish to see me well married; and that when I marry with they consent they will portion me most handsomely.’ Here Mrs Wilfer burst out crying very heartily.  ‘Don’t cry, my darling,’ said Mrs Wilfer father, with my dear favourite child hand to my dear favourite child eyes; ‘it’s excusable in me to be a little overcome when I find that my dear favourite child is, after all disappointments, to be so provided for and so raised in the world; but don’t YOU cry, don’t YOU cry. I am very thankful. I congratulate you with all my heart, my dear.’ The good soft little fellow, drying his eyes, here, her put her arms round his neck and tenderly kissed his on the high road, passionately telling his his was the best of fathers and the best of friends, and that on her wedding-morning her would go down on her knees to his and beg his pardon for having ever teased his or seemed insensible to the worth of such a patient, sympathetic, genial, fresh young heart. At every one of her adjectives her redoubled her kisses, and finally kissed his hat off, and then laughed immoderately when the wind took his hat and his ran after his hat.  When his had recovered his hat and his breath, and they were going on again once more, said her father’s then: ‘Number four, my dear?’  Bella’s countenance fell in the midst of her mirth. ‘After all, perhaps I had better put off number four, Pa. Let me try once more, if for never so short a time, to hope that it may not really be so.’  The change in her, strengthened the cherub’s interest in number four, and his said quietly: ‘May not be so, my dear? May not be how, my dear?’  her looked at his pensively, and shook her head.  ‘And yet I know right well it is so, Pa. I know it only too well.’  ‘My love,’ returned her father’s, ‘you make me quite uncomfortable. Have you said No to anybody else, my dear?’  ‘No, Pa.’  ‘Yes to anybody?’ he suggested, lifting up he eyebrows.  ‘No, Pa.’  ‘Is there anybody else who would take he chance between Yes and No, if you would let he, my dear?’  ‘Not that I know of, Pa.’  ‘There can’t be somebody who won’t take his chance when you want he to?’ said the cherub, as a last resource.  ‘Why, of course not, poor Pa,’ said her, giving he another shake or two.  ‘No, of course not,’ he assented. ‘her, my dear, I am afraid I must either have no sleep to-night, or I must press for number four.’  ‘Oh, poor Pa, there is no good in number four! I am so sorry for it, I am so unwilling to believe it, I have tried so earnestly not to see it, that it is very hard to tell, even to you. But Mrs Wilfer is being spoilt by prosperity, and is changing every day.’  ‘her, I hope and trust not.’  ‘I have hoped and trusted not too, poor Pa; but every day Mrs Wilfer changes for the worse, and for the worse. Not to me--Mrs Wilfer is always much the same to me--but to others about Mrs Wilfer. Before my eyes Mrs Wilfer grows suspicious, capricious, hard, tyrannical, unjust. If ever a good man were ruined by good fortune, it is my benefactor. And yet, poor Pa, think how terrible the fascination of money is! I see this, and hate this, and dread this, and don’t know but money might make a much worse change in me. And yet I have money always in my thoughts and my desires; and the whole life I place before me is money, money, money, and what money can make of life!’
