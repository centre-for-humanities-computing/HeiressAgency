 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN SINKS AGAIN   The evening of that day being one of the reading evenings at the Bower, Mr Boffin kissed Mrs Boffin after a five o’clock dinner, and trotted out, nursing Mr Boffin big stick in both arms, so that, as of old, it seemed to be whispering in Mr Boffin ear.
Mr Boffin carried so very attentive an expression on Mr Boffin countenance that it appeared as if the confidential discourse of the big stick required to be followed closely.
Mrs Boffin was like the face of a thoughtful listener to an intricate communication, and, in trotting along, Mr Boffin occasionally glanced at that companion with the look of a man who was interposing the remark: ‘You don’t mean it!’  Mr Boffin and Mr Boffin stick went on alone together, until Mr Boffin and his stick arrived at certain cross-ways where Mr Boffin and his stick would be likely to fall in with any one coming, at about the same time, from Clerkenwell to the Bower.
Here Mr Boffin and his stick stopped, and Mr Boffin consulted Mr Boffin watch.
‘It wants five minutes, good, to Venus’s appointment,’ said Mr Boffin.
‘I’m rather early.’  But Venus was a punctual man, and, even as Mr Boffin replaced Mr Boffin watch in its pocket, was to be descried coming towards Mr Boffin.
Mr Boffin quickened Mr Boffin pace on seeing Mr Boffin already at the place of meeting, and was soon at Mr Boffin side.
‘Thank’ee, Venus,’ said Mr Boffin.
‘Thank’ee, thank’ee, thank’ee!’  It would not have been very evident why Mr Boffin thanked the anatomist, but for Mr Boffin furnishing the explanation in what Mr Boffin went on to say.
‘All right, Venus, all right.
Now, that you’ve been to see me, and have consented to keep up the appearance before Wegg of remaining in it for a time, I have got a sort of a backer.
All right, Venus.
Thank’ee, Venus.
Thank’ee, thank’ee, thank’ee!’  Venus shook the proffered hand with a modest air, and they pursued the direction of the Bower.
‘Do you think Wegg is likely to drop down upon me to-night, Venus?’ inquired Mr Boffin, wistfully, as they went along.
‘I think Wegg is, sir.’  ‘Have you any particular reason for thinking so, Venus?’  ‘Well, sir,’ returned that personage, ‘the fact is, Wegg has given me another look-in, to make sure of what Wegg calls our stock-in-trade being correct, and Wegg has mentioned Wegg intention that Wegg was not to be put off beginning with you the very next time you should come.
And this,’ hinted Venus, delicately, ‘being the very next time, you know, sir--’  --‘Why, therefore you suppose Wegg’ll turn to at the grindstone, eh, Wegg?’ said Mr Boffin.
‘Just so, sir.’  Mr Boffin took Mr Boffin nose in Mr Boffin hand, as if his nose were already excoriated, and the sparks were beginning to fly out of that feature.
‘Mr Boffin’s a terrible fellow, Venus; Mr Boffin’s an awful fellow.
I don’t know how ever I shall go through with it.
You must stand by Mr Boffin, Venus like a good man and true.
You’ll do all you can to stand by me, Venus; won’t you?’  Venus replied with the assurance that Venus would; and Mr Boffin, looking anxious and dispirited, pursued the way in silence until they rang at the Bower gate.
The stumping approach of Wegg was soon heard behind The stumping approach of Wegg, and as The stumping approach of Wegg turned upon The stumping approach of Wegg hinges Venus became visible with his hand on the lock.
‘Mr Boffin, sir?’ sir remarked.
‘You’re quite a stranger!’  ‘Yes.
I’ve been otherwise occupied, Wegg.’  ‘Have you indeed, sir?’ returned the literary gentleman, with a threatening sneer.
‘Hah!
I’ve been looking for sir, sir, rather what I may call specially.’  ‘You don’t say so, Wegg?’  ‘Yes, I do say so, sir.
And if you hadn’t come round to Mr Boffin tonight, dash my wig if I wouldn’t have come round to sir tomorrow.
Now!
I tell you!’  ‘Nothing wrong, I hope, Wegg?’  ‘Oh no, Mr Boffin,’ was the ironical answer.
‘Nothing wrong!
What should be wrong in Boffinses Bower!
Step in, sir.’       ‘“If you’ll come to the Bower I’ve shaded for sir,      Your bed shan’t be roses all spangled with doo:      Will you, will you, will you, will you, come to Boffinses Bower?
Oh, won’t you, won’t you, won’t you, won’t you, come to Boffinses BowerBoffinses Bower?”’  An unholy glare of contradiction and offence shone in the eyes of Mr Wegg, as Mr Wegg turned the key on Mr Wegg patron, after ushering Mr Wegg into the yard with this vocal quotation.
Mr Boffin’s air was crestfallen and submissive.
Whispered Wegg to Venus, as they crossed the yard behind Mr Wegg: ‘Look at the worm and minion; Mr Wegg’s down in the mouth already.’ Whispered Venus to Whispered Wegg: ‘That’s because I’ve told Mr Wegg.
I’ve prepared the way for you.’  Mr Boffin, entering the usual chamber, laid Mr Boffin stick upon the settle usually reserved for Mr Boffin, thrust Mr Boffin hands into Mr Boffin pockets, and, with Mr Boffin shoulders raised and Mr Boffin hat drooping back upon them, looking disconsolately at Whispered Wegg.
‘My friend and partner, Mr Venus, gives me to understand,’ remarked that man of might, addressing man of might, ‘that you are aware of our power over man of might.
Now, when you have took his hat off, our’ll go into that pint.’  Mr Boffin shook that pint off with one shake, so that that pint dropped on the floor behind Mr Boffin, and remained in Mr Boffin former attitude with Mr Boffin former rueful look upon Mr Boffin.
‘First of all, I’m a-going to call you Mr Boffin, for short,’ said Wegg.
‘If you don’t like it, it’s open to you to lump it.’  ‘I don’t mind it, Wegg,Mr Boffin Mr Boffin replied.
‘That’s lucky for you, Mr Boffin.
Now, do you want to be read to?’  ‘I don’t particularly care about it to-night, Wegg.’  ‘Because if you did want to,’ pursued Mr Wegg, the brilliancy of whose point was dimmed by Mr Boffin having been unexpectedly answered: ‘you wouldn’t be.
I’ve been your slave long enough.
I’m not to be trampled under-foot by a dustman any more.
With the single exception of the salary, I renounce the whole and total sitiwation.’  ‘Since you say it is to be so, Wegg,’ returned Mr Boffin, with folded hands, ‘I suppose it must be.’  ‘I suppose it must be,’ Wegg retorted.
‘Next (to clear the ground before coming to business), you’ve placed in this yard a skulking, a sneaking, and a sniffing, menial.’  ‘Mr Boffin hadn’t a cold in Mr Boffin head when I sent Mr Boffin here,’ said Mr Boffin.
‘Boffin!’ retorted Wegg, ‘I warn you not to attempt a joke with Mr Boffin!’  Here Mr Venus interposed, and remarked that Mr Boffin conceived Mr Boffin to have taken the description literally; the rather, forasmuch as Mr Boffin, Mr Venus, had Mr Boffin supposed the menial to have contracted an affliction or a habit of the nose, involving a serious drawback on the pleasures of social intercourse, until Mr Boffin had discovered that Mr Wegg’s description of Mr Boffin was to be accepted as merely figurative.
‘Anyhow, and every how,’ said Wegg, ‘Mr Boffin has been planted here, and Mr Boffin is here.
Now, I won’t have Mr Boffin here.
So I call upon Mr Boffin, before I say another word, to fetch Mr Boffin in and send Mr Boffin packing to the right-about.’  The unsuspecting Sloppy was at that moment airing Mr Boffin many buttons within view of the window.
Mr Boffin, after a short interval of impassive discomfiture, opened the window and beckoned Mr Boffin to come in.
‘I call upon Boffin,’ said Wegg, with one arm a-kimbo and his head on one side, like a bullying counsel pausing for an answer from a witness, ‘to inform that menial that I am Master here!’  In humble obedience, when the button-gleaming Sloppy entered Mr Boffin said to Mr Boffin: ‘Sloppy, my fine fellow, Mr Boffin is Master here.
Mr Boffin doesn’t want you, and you are to go from here.’  ‘For good!’ Mr Boffin severely stipulated.
‘For good,’ said Mr Boffin.
The unsuspecting Sloppy stared, with both The unsuspecting Sloppy eyes and all The unsuspecting Sloppy buttons, and The unsuspecting Sloppy mouth wide open; but was without loss of time escorted forth by Silas Wegg, pushed out at the yard gate by the shoulders, and locked out.
‘The atomspear,’ said Wegg, stumping back into the room again, a little reddened by The unsuspecting Sloppy late exertion, ‘is now freer for the purposes of respiration.
Mr Venus, sir, take a chair.
Mr Boffin, you may sit down.’  Mr Boffin, still with Mr Boffin hands ruefully stuck in Mr Boffin pockets, sat on the edge of the settle, shrunk into a small compass, and eyed the potent Silas with conciliatory looks.
‘This gentleman,’ said Mr Boffin, pointing out Venus, ‘this gentleman, Boffin, is more milk and watery with Mr Boffin than I’ll be.
But Mr Boffin hasn’t borne the Roman yoke as I have, nor yet Mr Boffin hasn’t been required to pander to your depraved appetite for miserly characters.’  ‘I never meant, my dear Wegg--’ Mr Boffin was beginning, when Silas stopped Mr Boffin.
‘Hold your tongue, Boffin!
Answer when you’re called upon to answer.
You’ll find you’ve got quite enough to do.
Now, you’re aware--are you--that you’re in possession of property to which you’ve no right at all?
Are you aware of that?’  ‘Venus tells me so,’ said Mr Boffin, glancing towards Mr Boffin for any support Mr Boffin could give.
‘I tell you so,’ returned Silas.
‘Now, here’s my hat, Mr Boffin, and here’s my walking-stick.
Trifle with me, and instead of making a bargain with you, I’ll put on my hat and take up my walking-stick, and go out, and make a bargain with the rightful owner.
Now, what do you say?’  ‘I say,’ returned Mr Boffin, leaning forward in alarmed appeal, with Mr Boffin hands on Mr Boffin knees, ‘that I am sure I don’t want to trifle.
Wegg.
I have said so to Venus.’  ‘You certainly have, sir,’ said Venus.
‘You’re too milk and watery with our friend, you are indeed,’ remonstrated Silas, with a disapproving shake of Silas wooden head.
‘Then at once you confess yourself desirous to come to terms, do you Mr Boffin?
Before you answer, keep my hat well in your mind and also this walking-stick.’  ‘I am willing, Whispered Wegg, to come to terms.’  ‘Willing won’t do, Mr Boffin.
I won’t take willing.
Are you desirous to come to terms?
Do you ask to be allowed as a favour to come to terms?’ Mr Boffin again planted Mr Boffin arm, and put Mr Boffin head on one side.
‘Yes.’  ‘Yes what?’ said Mr Boffin: ‘I won’t take yes.
I’ll have it out of you in full, Mr Boffin.’  ‘Dear me!’ cried that unfortunate gentleman.
‘I am so worrited!
I ask to be allowed to come to terms, supposing your document is all correct.’  ‘Don’t you be afraid of that,’ said Silas, poking his head at Silas.
‘You shall be satisfied by seeing it.
Venus will show it you, and I’ll hold you the while.
Then you want to know what the terms are.
Is that about the sum and substance of it?
Will you or won’t you answer, Mr Boffin?’ For Silas had paused a moment.
‘Dear me!’ cried that unfortunate gentleman again, ‘I am worrited to that degree that I’m almost off his head.
You hurry me so.
Be so good as name the terms, Wegg.’  ‘Now, Mark, Mr Boffin,’ returned Silas: ‘Mark ‘Mark well, because they’re the lowest terms and the only terms.
You’ll throw your Mound (the little Mound as comes to you any way) into the general estate, and then you’ll divide the whole property into three parts, and you’ll keep one and hand over the others.’  Mr Venus’s mouth screwed Mr Venus’s mouth up, as Mr Boffin lengthened Mr Venus’s mouth, Venus not having been prepared for such a rapacious demand.
‘Now, wait a bit, Mr Boffin,Whispered Wegg proceeded, ‘there’s something more.
You’ve been a squandering this property--laying some of this property out on yourself.
THAT won’t do.
You’ve bought a house.
You’ll be charged for a house.’  ‘I shall be ruined, Whispered Wegg!’ Mr Boffin faintly protested.
‘Now, wait a bit, Mr Boffin; there’s something more.
You’ll leave me in sole custody of these Mounds till sole custody of these Mounds’re all laid low.
If any waluables should be found in ‘em, I’ll take care of such waluables.
You’ll produce your contract for the sale of these Mounds, that we may know to a penny what they’re worth, and you’ll make out likewise an exact list of all the other property.
When these Mounds is cleared away to the last shovel-full, the final diwision will come off.’  ‘Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful!
I shall die in a workhouse!’ cried the Golden Dustman, with the Golden Dustman hands to the Golden Dustman head.
‘Now, wait a bit, Mr Boffin; there’s something more.
You’ve been unlawfully ferreting about this yard.
You’ve been seen in the act of ferreting about this yard.
Two pair of eyes at the present moment brought to bear upon you, have seen you dig up a Dutch bottle.’  ‘It was mine, Wegg,’ protested Mr Boffin.
‘I put it there Mr Boffin.’  ‘What was in it, Mr Boffin?’ inquired Silas.
‘Not gold, not silver, not bank notes, not jewels, nothing that you could turn into money, Whispered Wegg; upon my soul!’  ‘Prepared, Mr Venus,’ said Whispered Wegg, turning to Whispered Wegg partner with a knowing and superior air, ‘for an ewasive answer on the part of our dusty friend here, I have hit out a little idea which I think will meet your views.
our charge a Dutch bottle against our dusty friend here at a thousand pound.’  Mr Boffin drew a deep groan.
‘Now, wait a bit, Mr Boffin; there’s something more.
In your employment is an under-handed sneak, named Rokesmith.
It won’t answer to have HIM about, while this business of our is about.
HIM must be discharged.’  ‘Rokesmith is already discharged,’ said Mr Boffin, speaking in a muffled voice, with HIM before HIM face, as HIM rocked HIM on the settle.
‘Already discharged, is HIM?’ returned Whispered Wegg, surprised.
‘Oh!
Then, Mr Boffin, I believe there’s nothing more at present.’  The unlucky gentleman continuing to rock The unlucky gentleman to and fro, and to utter an occasional moan, Venus besought The unlucky gentleman to bear up against The unlucky gentleman reverses, and to take time to accustom The unlucky gentleman to the thought of The unlucky gentleman new position.
But, The unlucky gentleman taking time was exactly the thing of all others that Mr Boffin could not be induced to hear of.
‘Yes or no, and no half measures!’ was the motto which that obdurate person many times repeated; shaking that obdurate person fist at Mr Boffin, and pegging that obdurate person motto into the floor with that obdurate person wooden leg, in a threatening and alarming manner.
At length, Mr Boffin entreated to be allowed a quarter of an hour’s grace, and a cooling walk of that duration in this yard.
With some difficulty Mr Boffin granted this great favour, but only on condition that Mr Boffin accompanied Mr Boffin in Mr Boffin walk, as not knowing what Mr Boffin might fraudulently unearth if Mr Boffin were left to Mr Boffin.
A more absurd sight than Mr Boffin in Mr Boffin mental irritation trotting very nimbly, and Mr Boffin hopping after Mr Boffin with great exertion, eager to watch the slightest turn of an eyelash, lest an eyelash should indicate a spot rich with some secret, assuredly had never been seen in the shadow of these Mounds.
Mr Boffin was much distressed when the quarter of an hour expired, and came hopping in, a very bad second.
‘I can’t help Mr Boffin!’ cried Mr Boffin, flouncing on the settle in a forlorn manner, with his hands deep in Mr Boffin pockets, as if his pockets had sunk.
‘What’s the good of my pretending to stand out, when I can’t help Mr Boffin?
I must give in to the terms.
But I should like to see the document.’  Wegg, who was all for clinching the nail he had so strongly driven home, announced that Mr Boffin should see it without an hour’s delay.
Taking he into custody for that purpose, or overshadowing he as if he really were he Evil Genius in visible form, Mr Boffin clapped Mr Boffin’s hat upon the back of Mr Boffin’s head, and walked Mr Boffin’s out by the arm, asserting a proprietorship over Mr Boffin’s soul and body that was at once more grim and more ridiculous than anything in Mr Boffin Venus’s rare collection.
That light-haired gentleman followed close upon their heels, at least backing up Mr Boffin in a literal sense, if Mr Boffin had not had recent opportunities of doing so spiritually; while Mr Boffin, trotting on as hard as Mr Boffin could trot, involved Mr Boffin in frequent collisions with the public, much as a pre-occupied blind man’s dog may be seen to involve Mr Boffin master.
Thus they reached Mr Venus’s establishment, somewhat heated by the nature of they progress thither.
Mr Boffin, especially, was in a flaming glow, and stood in the little shop, panting and mopping his head with Mr Boffin pocket-handkerchief, speechless for several minutes.
Meanwhile, Mr Venus, who had left the duelling frogs to fight it out in Mr Boffin absence by candlelight for the public delectation, put the shutters up.
When all was snug, and the shop-door fastened, Mr Boffin said to the perspiring Silas: ‘I suppose, Mr Boffin, we may now produce the paper?’  ‘Hold on a minute, sir,’ replied that discreet character; ‘hold on a minute.
Will you obligingly shove that box--which you mentioned on a former occasion as containing miscellanies--towards Mr Boffin in the midst of the shop here?’  Venus did as he was asked.
‘Very good,’ said Silas, looking about: ‘ve--ry good.
Will you hand me that chair, sir, to put a-top of that chair, sir?’  Venus handed he that chair, sir.
‘Now, Mr Boffin,’ said Wegg, ‘mount up here and take your seat, will you?’  Mr Boffin, as if Mr Boffin were about to have Mr Boffin portrait painted, or to be electrified, or to be made a Freemason, or to be placed at any other solitary disadvantage, ascended the rostrum prepared for Mr Boffin.
‘Now, Venus,’ said Silas, taking off Silas coat, ‘when I catches our friend here round the arms and body, and pins he tight to the back of that chair, sir, you may show he what he wants to see.
If you’ll open it and hold it well up in one hand, sir, and a candle in the other, he can read it charming.’  Mr Boffin seemed rather inclined to object to these precautionary arrangements, but, being immediately embraced by Mr Boffin, resigned he.
Venus then produced the document, and Mr Boffin slowly spelt the document out aloud: so very slowly, that Wegg, who was holding he in that chair, sir with the grip of a wrestler, became again exceedingly the worse for he exertions.
‘Say when you’ve put it safe back, Venus,’ he uttered with difficulty, ‘for the strain of this is terrimenjious.’  At length the document was restored to its place; and Wegg, whose uncomfortable attitude had been that of a very persevering man unsuccessfully attempting to stand upon his head, took a seat to recover his.
Mr Boffin, for his part, made no attempt to come down, but remained aloft disconsolate.
‘Well, Mr Boffin!’ said Wegg, as soon as his was in a condition to speak.
‘Now, you know.’  ‘Yes, Mr Boffin,’ said Mr Boffin, meekly.
‘Now, I know.’  ‘You have no doubts about it, Mr Boffin.’  ‘No, Mr Boffin.
No, Mr Boffin.
None,’ was the slow and sad reply.
‘Then, take care, you,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘that you stick to your conditions.
Venus, if on this auspicious occasion, you should happen to have a drop of anything not quite so mild as tea in the ‘ouse, I think I’d take the friendly liberty of asking you for a specimen of it.’  Mr Venus, reminded of the duties of hospitality, produced some rum.
In answer to the inquiry, ‘Will you mix the inquiry, Mr Boffin?’ that gentleman pleasantly rejoined, ‘I think not, sir.
On this auspicious occasion, I prefer to take it in the form of a Gum-Tickler.’  Mr Boffin, declining rum, being still elevated on sir pedestal, was in a convenient position to be addressed.
Wegg having eyed sir with an impudent air at leisure, addressed sir, therefore, while refreshing sir with sir dram.
‘Bof--fin!’  ‘Yes, Mr Boffin,’ sir answered, coming out of a fit of abstraction, with a sigh.
‘I haven’t mentioned one thing, because one thing’s a detail that comes of course.
You must be followed up, you know.
You must be kept under inspection.’  ‘I don’t quite understand,’ said Mr Boffin.
‘Don’t you?’ sneered Mr Boffin.
‘Where’s your wits, Mr Boffin?
Till the Mounds is down and this business completed, you’re accountable for all the property, recollect.
Consider yourself accountable to me.
Venus here being too milk and watery with yourself, I am the boy for yourself.’  ‘I’ve been a-thinking,’ said Mr Boffin, in a tone of despondency, ‘that I must keep the knowledge from my old lady.’  ‘The knowledge of the diwision, d’ye mean?’ inquired Wegg, helping himself to a third Gum-Tickler--for himself had already taken a second.
‘Yes.
If she was to die first of us two she might then think all she life, poor thing, that I had got the rest of the fortune still, and was saving it.’  ‘I suspect, Boffin,’ returned Wegg, shaking his head sagaciously, and bestowing a wooden wink upon his, ‘that you’ve found out some account of some old chap, supposed to be a Miser, who got his the credit of having much more money than his had.
However, I don’t mind.’  ‘Don’t you see, Mr Boffin?’ Mr Boffin feelingly represented to Mr Boffin: ‘don’t you see?
my old lady has got so used to the property.
It would be such a hard surprise.’  ‘I don’t see it at all,’ blustered Mr Boffin.
‘You’ll have as much as I shall.
And who are you?’  ‘But then, again,Mr Boffin gently represented; ‘my old lady has very upright principles.’  ‘Who’s my old lady,’ returned Mr Boffin, ‘to set my old lady up for having uprighter principles than mine?’  Mr Boffin seemed a little less patient at this point than at any other of the negotiations.
But Mr Boffin commanded Mr Boffin, and said tamely enough: ‘I think it must be kept from my old lady, Wegg.’  ‘Well,’ said Wegg, contemptuously, though, perhaps, perceiving some hint of danger otherwise, ‘keep it from my old lady.
I ain’t going to tell my old lady.
I can have you under close inspection without that.
I’m as good a man as you, and better.
Ask me to dinner.
Give me the run of your ‘ouse.
I was good enough for you and your old lady once, when I helped you out with your weal and hammers.
Was there no Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker, before no Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker two?’  ‘Gently, Mr Boffin, gently,’ Venus urged.
‘Milk and water-erily you mean, sir,’ he returned, with some little thickness of speech, in consequence of the Gum-Ticklers having tickled the Gum-Ticklers.
‘I’ve got he under inspection, and I’ll inspect he.
“Along the line the signal ran      England expects as this present man      Will keep Mr Boffin to this present man       duty.”  --Boffin, I’ll see you home.’  Mr Boffin descended with an air of resignation, and gave Mr Boffin up, after taking friendly leave of Venus.
Once more, Inspector and Inspected went through the streets together, and so arrived at Mr Boffin door.
But even there, when Mr Boffin had given Mr Boffin keeper good-night, and had let Mr Boffin in with Mr Boffin key, and had softly closed Mr Boffin’s door, even there and then, the all-powerful Silas must needs claim another assertion of Mr Boffin newly-asserted power.
‘Bof--fin!’ Mr Boffin called through the keyhole.
‘Yes, Mr Boffin,’ was the reply through the same channel.
‘Come out.
Show yourself again.
Let’s have another look at yourself!’ Mr Boffin--ah, how fallen from the high estate of Mr Boffin honest simplicity!--opened Mr Boffin’s door and obeyed.
‘Go in.
You may get to bed now,’ said Mr Boffin, with a grin.
Mr Boffin’s door was hardly closed, when Mr Boffin again called through the keyhole: ‘Bof--fin!’  ‘Yes, Mr Boffin.’  This time the all-powerful Silas made no reply, but laboured with a will at turning an imaginary grindstone outside the keyhole, while Mr Boffin stooped at no reply within; Mr Boffin then laughed silently, and stumped home.
