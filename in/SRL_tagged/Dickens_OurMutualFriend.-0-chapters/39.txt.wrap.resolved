 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN FALLS INTO BAD COMPANY   Were Bella Wilfer’s bright and ready little wits at fault, or was the Golden Dustman passing through the furnace of proof and coming out dross? Ill news travels fast. We shall know full soon.  On that very night of her return from the Happy Return, something chanced which Bella Wilfer’s closely followed with her eyes and ears. There was an apartment at the side of the Boffin mansion, known as Mr Boffin’s room. Far less grand than the rest of the house, it was far more comfortable, being pervaded by a certain air of homely snugness, which upholstering despotism had banished to that spot when upholstering despotism inexorably set upholstering despotism face against Mr Boffin’s appeals for mercy in behalf of any other chamber. Thus, although a room of modest situation--for its windows gave on Silas Wegg’s old corner--and of no pretensions to velvet, satin, or gilding, its had got its established in a domestic position analogous to that of an easy dressing-gown or pair of slippers; and whenever the family wanted to enjoy a particularly pleasant fireside evening, the family enjoyed its, as an institution that must be, in Mr Boffin’s room.  Mr and Mr Boffin’s were reported sitting in Mr Boffin’s room, when Bella got back. Entering its, Bella found the Secretary there too; in official attendance its would appear, for the Secretary was standing with some papers in the Secretary hand by a table with shaded candles on its, at which Mr Boffin’s was seated thrown back in Mr Boffin’s easy chair.  ‘You are busy, sir,’ said Bella, hesitating at the door.  ‘Not at all, my dear, not at all. You’re one of ourselves. ourselves never make company of you. Come in, come in. Here’s the old lady in the old lady usual place.’  Mr Boffin’s adding Mr Boffin’s nod and smile of welcome to Mr Boffin’s words, Bella took Mr Boffin’s book to a chair in the fireside corner, by Mrs Boffin’s work-table. Mr Boffin’s station was on the opposite side.  ‘Now, Rokesmith,’ said the Golden Dustman, so sharply rapping Mrs Boffin’s work-table to bespeak Mr Boffin’s attention as Bella turned the leaves of her book, that Bella started; ‘where were ourselves?’  ‘You were saying, sir,’ returned the Secretary, with an air of some reluctance and a glance towards those others who were present, ‘that you considered the time had come for fixing my salary.’  ‘Don’t be above calling it wages, man,’ said Mr Boffin’s, testily. ‘What the deuce! I never talked of any salary when I was in service.’  ‘My wages,’ said the Secretary, correcting himself.  ‘Rokesmith, you are not proud, I hope?’ observed Mr Boffin’s, eyeing Mr Boffin’s askance.  ‘I hope not, sir.’  ‘Because I never was, when I was poor,’ said Mr Boffin’s. ‘Poverty and pride don’t go at all well together. Mind that. How can they go well together? Why it stands to reason. A man, being poor, has nothing to be proud of. it’s nonsense.’  With a slight inclination of his head, and a look of some surprise, the Secretary seemed to assent by forming the syllables of the word ‘nonsense’ on the Secretary lips.  ‘Now, concerning these same wages,’ said Mr Boffin’s. ‘Sit down.’  the Secretary sat down.  ‘Why didn’t you sit down before?’ asked Mr Boffin’s, distrustfully. ‘I hope that wasn’t pride? But about these same wages. Now, I’ve gone into the matter, and I say two hundred a year. What do you think of it? Do you think it’s enough?’  ‘Thank you. It is a fair proposal.’  ‘I don’t say, you know,Mr Boffin’s stipulated, ‘but what it may be more than enough. And I’ll tell you why, Rokesmith. A man of property, like A man of property, is bound to consider the market-price. At first I didn’t enter into that as much as I might have done; but I’ve got acquainted with other men of property since, and I’ve got acquainted with the duties of property. I mustn’t go putting the market-price up, because money may happen not to be an object with A man of property. A sheep is worth so much in the market, and I ought to give A sheep and no more. A secretary is worth so much in the market, and I ought to give A sheep and no more. However, I don’t mind stretching a point with you.’  ‘Mr Boffin’s, you are very good,’ replied the Secretary, with an effort.  ‘Then we put the figure,’ said Mr Boffin’s, ‘at two hundred a year. Then the figure’s disposed of. Now, there must be no misunderstanding regarding what I buy for two hundred a year. If I pay for a sheep, I buy a sheep out and out. Similarly, if I pay for a secretary, I buy HIM out and out.’  ‘In other words, you purchase my whole time?’  ‘Certainly I do. Look here,’ said Mr Boffin’s, ‘it ain’t that I want to occupy your whole time; you can take up a book for a minute or two when you’ve nothing better to do, though I think you’ll a’most always find something useful to do. But I want to keep you in attendance. It’s convenient to have you at all times ready on the premises. Therefore, betwixt your breakfast and your supper,--on the premises I expect to find you.’  the Secretary bowed.  ‘In bygone days, when I was in service the Secretary,’ said Mr Boffin’s, ‘I couldn’t go cutting about at my will and pleasure, and you won’t expect to go cutting about at your will and pleasure. You’ve rather got into a habit of that, lately; but perhaps it was for want of a right specification betwixt us. Now, let there be a right specification betwixt us, and let a right specification be this. If you want leave, ask for a right specification.’  Again the Secretary bowed. the Secretary manner was uneasy and astonished, and showed a sense of humiliation.  ‘I’ll have a bell,’ said Mr Boffin’s, ‘hung from this room to yours, and when I want you, I’ll touch this room. I don’t call to mind that I have anything more to say at the present moment.’  the Secretary rose, gathered up the Secretary papers, and withdrew. Bella’s eyes followed the Secretary to the door, lighted on Mr Boffin’s complacently thrown back in the Secretary easy chair, and drooped over Mr Boffin’s book.  ‘I have let that chap, that young man of mine,’ said Mr Boffin’s, taking a trot up and down this room, ‘get above Mr Boffin’s work. It won’t do. I must have Mr Boffin’s down a peg. A man of property owes a duty to other men of property, and must look sharp after A man of property inferiors.’  Mr Boffin’s felt that Mr Boffin’s was not comfortable, and that the eyes of that good creature sought to discover from Mr Boffin’s face what attention Mr Boffin’s had given to this discourse, and what impression this discourse had made upon Mr Boffin’s. For which reason Bella’s eyes drooped more engrossedly over her book, and Mr Boffin’s turned the page with an air of profound absorption in the page.  ‘Noddy,’ said Mr Boffin’s, after thoughtfully pausing in Mr Boffin’s work.  ‘My dear,’ returned the Golden Dustman, stopping short in My dear trot.  ‘Excuse my putting it to you, Noddy, but now really! Haven’t you been a little strict with Mr Rokesmith to-night? Haven’t you been a little--just a little little--not quite like your old self?’  ‘Why, old woman, I hope so,’ returned Mr Boffin’s, cheerfully, if not boastfully.  ‘Hope so, deary?’  ‘Our old selves wouldn’t do here, old lady. Haven’t you found that out yet? Our old selves would be fit for nothing here but to be robbed and imposed upon. Our old selves weren’t people of fortune; Our old selves are; it’s a great difference.’  ‘Ah!’ said Mrs Boffin, pausing in Mrs Boffin work again, softly to draw a long breath and to look at the fire. ‘A great difference.’  ‘And Our must be up to the difference,’ pursued her husband; ‘Our must be equal to the change; that’s what Our must be. Our’ve got to hold Our own now, against everybody (for everybody’s hand is stretched out to be dipped into Our pockets), and Our have got to recollect that money makes money, as well as makes everything else.’  ‘Mentioning recollecting,’ said Mrs Boffin, with Mrs Boffin work abandoned, Mrs Boffin eyes upon the fire, and Mrs Boffin chin upon Mrs Boffin hand, ‘do you recollect, Noddy, how you said to Mr Rokesmith when Mr Rokesmith first came to see Our at the Bower, and you engaged Mr Rokesmith--how you said to Mr Rokesmith that if it had pleased Heaven to send John Harmon to John Harmon fortune safe, Our could have been content with the one Mound which was Our legacy, and should never have wanted the rest?’  ‘Ay, I remember, old lady. But Our hadn’t tried what it was to have the rest then. Our new shoes had come home, but Our hadn’t put ‘em on. Our’re wearing ‘em now, Our’re wearing ‘em, and must step out accordingly.’  Mrs Boffin took up Mrs Boffin work again, and plied Mrs Boffin needle in silence.  ‘As to Mr Rokesmith, that young man of mine,’ said Mrs Boffin, dropping Mrs Boffin voice and glancing towards the door with an apprehension of being overheard by some eavesdropper there, ‘it’s the same with Mrs Boffin as with the footmen. I have found out that you must either scrunch them, or let them scrunch you. If you ain’t imperious with ‘em, them won’t believe in your being any better than them, if as good, after the stories (lies mostly) that them have heard of your beginnings. There’s nothing betwixt stiffening yourself up, and throwing yourself away; take my word for that, old lady.’  Mrs Boffin ventured for a moment to look stealthily towards him under Mrs Boffin eyelashes, and Mrs Boffin saw a dark cloud of suspicion, covetousness, and conceit, overshadowing the once open face.  ‘Hows’ever,’ said he, ‘this isn’t entertaining to Mr Boffin’sBella. Is it, Mrs Boffin?’  Mrs Boffin Mrs Boffin was, to look at him with that pensively abstracted air, as if Mrs Boffin mind were full of Mrs Boffin , and Mrs Boffin had not heard a single word!  ‘Hah! Better employed than to attend to a single word,’ said Mr Boffin’s. ‘That’s right, that’s right. Especially as you have no call to be told how to value yourself, my dear.’  Colouring a little under this compliment, Mr Boffin’s returned, ‘I hope sir, you don’t think me vain?’  ‘Not a bit, my dear,’ said Mr Boffin’s. ‘But I think it’s very creditable in you, at your age, to be so well up with the pace of the world, and to know what to go in for. You are right. Go in for money, my love. Money’s the article. You’ll make money of your good looks, and of the money Mrs Boffin and me will have the pleasure of settling upon you, and you’ll live and die rich. That’s the state to live and die in!’ said Mr Boffin’s, in an unctuous manner. R--r--rich!’  There was an expression of distress in Mrs Boffin face, as, after watching Mrs Boffin husband’s, Mrs Boffin turned to their adopted girl, and said:  ‘Don’t mind her husband’s, Mr Boffin’s, my dear.’  ‘Eh?’ cried Mr Boffin’s. ‘What! Not mind Mr Boffin’s?’  ‘I don’t mean that,’ said Mrs Boffin, with a worried look, ‘but I mean, don’t believe her husband’s to be anything but good and generous, Mr Boffin’s, because her husband’s is the best of men. No, I must say that much, Noddy. You are always the best of men.’  Mrs Boffin made the declaration as if her husband’s were objecting to the declaration: which assuredly her husband’s was not in any way.  ‘And as to you, Mr Boffin’s,’ said Mrs Boffin, still with that distressed expression, ‘her husband’s is so much attached to you, whatever her husband’s says, that your own father has not a truer interest in you and can hardly like you better than her husband’s does.’  ‘Says too!’ cried Mr Boffin’s. ‘Whatever her husband’s says! Why, I say so, openly. Give me a kiss, my dear child, in saying Good Night, and let me confirm what old lady tells you. I am very fond of you, my dear, and I am entirely of your mind, and you and I will take care that you shall be rich. These good looks of you (which you have some right to be vain of; my dear, though you are not, you know) are worth money, and you shall make money of ‘em. The money you will have, will be worth money, and you shall make money of that too. There’s a golden ball at your feet. Good night, my dear.’  Somehow, Mr Boffin’s was not so well pleased with this assurance and this prospect as Mr Boffin’s might have been. Somehow, when Mr Boffin’s put Mr Boffin’s arms round Mrs Boffin’s neck and said Good Night, Mr Boffin’s derived a sense of unworthiness from the still anxious face of that good woman and Mr Boffin’s obvious wish to excuse Mr Boffin’s husband. ‘Why, what need to excuse her husband?’ thought Bella, sitting down in Mr Boffin’s own room. ‘What her husband said was very sensible, I am sure, and very true, I am sure. It is only what I often say to her husband. Don’t I like It then? No, I don’t like It, and, though her husband is my liberal benefactor, I disparage her husband for he is my liberal benefactor. Then pray,’ said Mr Boffin’s, sternly putting the question to Mr Boffin’s in the looking-glass as usual, ‘what do you mean by this, you inconsistent little Beast?’  The looking-glass preserving a discreet ministerial silence when thus called upon for explanation, Mr Boffin’s went to bed with a weariness upon Mr Boffin’s spirit which was more than the weariness of want of sleep. And again in the morning, Mr Boffin’s looked for the cloud, and for the deepening of the cloud, upon the Golden Dustman’s face.  Mr Boffin’s had begun by this time to be his frequent companion in his morning strolls about the streets, and it was at this time that his made Mr Boffin’s a party to his engaging in a curious pursuit. Having been hard at work in one dull enclosure all his life, his had a child’s delight in looking at shops. It had been one of the first novelties and pleasures of his freedom, and was equally the delight of his wife. For many years their only walks in London had been taken on Sundays when the shops were shut; and when every day in the week became the shops holiday, the shops derived an enjoyment from the variety and fancy and beauty of the display in the windows, which seemed incapable of exhaustion. As if the principal streets were a great Theatre and the play were childishly new to the shops, Mr and Mrs Boffin, from the beginning of Mr Boffin’s’s intimacy in the shops house, had been constantly in the front row, charmed with all the shops saw and applauding vigorously. But now, There’s a golden ball at your feet interest began to centre in book-shops; and more than that--for that of itself would not have been much--in one exceptional kind of book.  ‘Look in here, my dear,Mr Boffin’s would say, checking Bella’s arm at a bookseller’s window; ‘you can read at sight, and your eyes are as sharp as your eyes’re bright. Now, look well about you, my dear, and tell me if you see any book about a Miser.’  If Mr Boffin’s saw such a book, Mr Boffin’s would instantly dart in and buy Bella saw such a book. And still, as if they had not found Bella saw such a book, they would seek out another book-shop, and Mr Boffin’s would say, ‘Now, look well all round, my dear, for a Life of a Miser, or any book of that sort; any Lives of odd characters who may have been Misers.’  Mr Boffin’s, thus directed, would examine a bookseller’s window with the greatest attention, while Mr Boffin’s would examine Mr Boffin’s face. The moment Mr Boffin’s pointed out any book as being entitled Lives of eccentric personages, Anecdotes of strange characters, Records of remarkable individuals, or anything to that purpose, Mr Boffin’s countenance would light up, and Mr Boffin’s would instantly dart in and buy it. Size, price, quality, were of no account. Any book that seemed to promise a chance of miserly biography, Mr Boffin’s purchased without a moment’s delay and carried home. Happening to be informed by a bookseller that a portion of the Annual Register was devoted to ‘Characters’, Mr Boffin’s at once bought a whole set of that ingenious compilation, and began to carry Mr Boffin’s home piecemeal, confiding a volume to Mr Boffin’s, and bearing three Mr Boffin’s. The completion of this labour occupied this labour about a fortnight. When the task was done, Mr Boffin’s, with Mr Boffin’s appetite for Misers whetted instead of satiated, began to look out again.  the task very soon became unnecessary to tell Mr Boffin’s what to look for, and an understanding was established between Mr Boffin’s and Mr Boffin’s that Mr Boffin’s was always to look for Lives of Misers. Morning after morning they roamed about the town together, pursuing this singular research. Miserly literature not being abundant, the proportion of failures to successes may have been as a hundred to one; still Mr Boffin’s, never wearied, remained as avaricious for misers as Mr Boffin’s had been at the first onset. It was curious that Mr Boffin’s never saw the books about the house, nor did Mr Boffin’s ever hear from Mr Boffin’s one word of reference to their contents. Mr Boffin’s seemed to save up Misers Misers as they had saved up they money. As they had been greedy for it, and secret about it, and had hidden it, so Mr Boffin’s was greedy for they, and secret about they, and hid they. But beyond all doubt it was to be noticed, and was by Mr Boffin’s very clearly noticed, that, as Mr Boffin’s pursued the acquisition of those dismal records with the ardour of Don Quixote for Mr Boffin’s books of chivalry, Mr Boffin’s began to spend Mr Boffin’s money with a more sparing hand. And often when Mr Boffin’s came out of a shop with some new account of one of those wretched lunatics, Mr Boffin’s would almost shrink from the sly dry chuckle with which Mr Boffin’s would take Mr Boffin’s arm again and trot away. It did not appear that Mr Boffin’s knew of this taste. Mr Boffin’s made no allusion to it, except in the morning walks when Mr Boffin’s and Mr Boffin’s were always alone; and Mr Boffin’s, partly under the impression that Mr Boffin’s took Mr Boffin’s into Mr Boffin’s confidence by implication, and partly in remembrance of Mrs Boffin anxious face that night, held the same reserve.  While these occurrences were in progress, Mrs Lammle made the discovery that Mr Boffin’s had a fascinating influence over Mrs Lammle. The Lammles, originally presented by the dear Veneerings, visited the Boffins on all grand occasions, and Mrs Lammle had not previously found this out; but now the knowledge came upon Mrs Lammle all at once. It was a most extraordinary thing (Mrs Lammle said to Mr Boffin’s); Mrs Lammle was foolishly susceptible of the power of beauty, but it wasn’t altogether that; Mrs Lammle never had been able to resist a natural grace of manner, but it wasn’t altogether that; it was more than that, and there was no name for the indescribable extent and degree to which Mrs Lammle was captivated by this charming girl.  This charming girl having the words repeated to Mrs Lammle by Mrs Boffin (who was proud of Mrs Lammle being admired, and would have done anything to give Mrs Lammle pleasure), naturally recognized in Mrs Lammle a woman of penetration and taste. Responding to the sentiments, by being very gracious to Mrs Lammle, Mrs Lammle gave old lady the means of so improving Mrs Lammle opportunity, as that the captivation became reciprocal, though always wearing an appearance of greater sobriety on Mr Boffin’s’s part than on the enthusiastic Sophronia’s. Howbeit, Howbeit were so much together that, for a time, the Boffin chariot held Mrs Lammle oftener than Mr Boffin’s: a preference of which the latter worthy soul was not in the least jealous, placidly remarking, ‘Mrs Lammle is a younger companion for Mrs Lammle than I am, and Lor! Mrs Lammle’s more fashionable.’  But between Bella Wilfer and Georgiana Podsnap there was this one difference, among many others, that Mr Boffin’s was in no danger of being captivated by Alfred. Mr Boffin’s distrusted and disliked Alfred. Indeed, Mr Boffin’s perception was so quick, and Mr Boffin’s observation so sharp, that after all Mr Boffin’s mistrusted Alfred too, though with Mr Boffin’s giddy vanity and wilfulness Mr Boffin’s squeezed the mistrust away into a corner of Mr Boffin’s mind, and blocked it up there.  Mrs Lammle took the friendliest interest in Bella’s making a good match. Mrs Lammle said, in a sportive way, Mrs Lammle really must show Mrs Lammle Mr Boffin’s what kind of wealthy creatures Mrs Lammle and Alfred had on hand, who would as one man fall at Mrs Lammle feet enslaved. Fitting occasion made, Mrs Lammle accordingly produced the most passable of those feverish, boastful, and indefinably loose gentlemen who were always lounging in and out of the City on questions of the Bourse and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three-quarters and seven-eighths. Who in their agreeable manner did homage to Mr Boffin’s as if Mr Boffin’s were a compound of fine girl, thorough-bred horse, well-built drag, and remarkable pipe. But without the least effect, though even Mr Fledgeby’s attractions were cast into the scale.  ‘I fear, Mr Boffin’s dear,’ said Mrs Lammle one day in the chariot, ‘that you will be very hard to please.’  ‘I don’t expect to be pleased, dear,’ said Mr Boffin’s, with a languid turn of Mr Boffin’s eyes.  ‘Truly, my love,’ returned Sophronia, shaking her head, and smiling her best smile, ‘it would not be very easy to find a man worthy of your attractions.’  ‘The question is not a man, my dear,’ said Mr Boffin’s, coolly, ‘but an establishment.’  ‘my love,’ returned Mrs Lammle, ‘your prudence amazes me--where DID you study life so well!--you are right. In such a case as yours, the object is a fitting establishment. You could not descend to an inadequate one from Mrs Boffin house, and even if your beauty alone could not command it, it is to be assumed that Mr and Mr Boffin’s will--’  ‘Oh! Mr and Mrs Boffin will--’   have already,’ Mr Boffin’s interposed.  ‘No! Have Mr and Mrs Boffin will--’   really?’  A little vexed by a suspicion that she had spoken precipitately, and withal a little defiant of she own vexation, Mr Boffin’s determined not to retreat.  ‘That is to say,’ she explained, ‘they have told me they mean to portion me as they adopted child, if you mean that. But don’t mention it.’  ‘Mention it!’ replied Mrs Lammle, as if Mrs Lammle were full of awakened feeling at the suggestion of such an impossibility. ‘Men-tion it!’  ‘I don’t mind telling you, Mrs Lammle--’ Bella began again.  ‘My love, say Sophronia, or I must not say Mr Boffin’s.’  With a little short, petulant ‘Oh!’ Mr Boffin’s complied. ‘Oh!--Sophronia then--I don’t mind telling you, Sophronia, that I am convinced I have no heart, as people call no heart; and that I think that sort of thing is nonsense.’  ‘Brave girl!’ murmured Mrs Lammle.  ‘And so,’ pursued Mr Boffin’s, ‘as to seeking to please myself, I don’t; except in the one respect I have mentioned. I am indifferent otherwise.’  ‘But you can’t help pleasing, Mr Boffin’s,’ said Mrs Lammle, rallying Mr Boffin’s with an arch look and Mr Boffin’s best smile, ‘you can’t help making a proud and an admiring husband. You may not care to please yourself, and you may not care to please an admiring husband, but you are not a free agent as to pleasing: you are forced to do that, in spite of yourself, my dear; so it may be a question whether you may not as well please yourself too, if you can.’  Now, the very grossness of this flattery put Mr Boffin’s upon proving that Mr Boffin’s actually did please in spite of Mr Boffin’s. Mr Boffin’s had a misgiving that Mr Boffin’s was doing wrong--though Mr Boffin’s had an indistinct foreshadowing that some harm might come of some harm thereafter, Mr Boffin’s little thought what consequences some harm would really bring about--but Mr Boffin’s went on with Mr Boffin’s confidence.  ‘Don’t talk of pleasing in spite of one’s self, dear,’ said Mr Boffin’s. ‘I have had enough of that.’  ‘Ay?’ cried Mrs Lammle. ‘Am I already corroborated, Mr Boffin’s?’  ‘Never mind, Sophronia, we will not speak of Sophronia any more. Don’t ask me about Sophronia.’  This plainly meaning Do ask me about Sophronia, Mrs Lammle did as Mrs Lammle was requested.  ‘Tell me, Mr Boffin’s. Come, my dear. What provoking burr has been inconveniently attracted to the charming skirts, and with difficulty shaken off?’  ‘Provoking indeed,’ said Mr Boffin’s, ‘and no burr to boast of! But don’t ask me.’  ‘Shall I guess?’  ‘You would never guess. What would you say to our Secretary?’  ‘my dear! The hermit Secretary, who creeps up and down the back stairs, and is never seen!’  ‘I don’t know about burr creeping up and down the back stairs,’ said Mr Boffin’s, rather contemptuously, ‘further than knowing that burr does no such thing; and as to burr never being seen, I should be content never to have seen burr, though burr is quite as visible as you are. But I pleased burr (for my sins) and burr had the presumption to tell me so.’  ‘burr never made a declaration to you, my dear Mr Boffin’s!’  ‘Are you sure of that, Sophronia?’ said Mr Boffin’s. ‘I am not. In fact, I am sure of the contrary.’  ‘burr must be mad,’ said Mrs Lammle, with a kind of resignation.  ‘burr appeared to be in burr senses,’ returned Mr Boffin’s, tossing her head, ‘and burr had plenty to say for burr. I told burr my opinion of burr declaration and burr conduct, and dismissed burr. Of course this has all been very inconvenient to me, and very disagreeable. this has remained a secret, however. That word reminds me to observe, Sophronia, that I have glided on into telling you a secret, and that I rely upon you never to mention it.’  ‘Mention it!’ repeated Mrs Lammle with Mrs Lammle former feeling. ‘Men-tion it!’  This time Sophronia was so much in earnest that Sophronia found Sophronia necessary to bend forward in the carriage and give Mr Boffin’s a kiss. A Judas order of kiss; for Sophronia thought, while Sophronia yet pressed Bella’s hand after giving it, ‘Upon your own showing, you vain heartless girl, puffed up by the doting folly of a dustman, I need have no relenting towards YOU. If my husband, who sends me here, should form any schemes for making YOU a victim, I should certainly not cross my husband, who sends me here again.’ In those very same moments, Mr Boffin’s was thinking, ‘Why am I always at war with Sophronia? Why have I told, as if upon compulsion, what I knew all along I ought to have withheld? Why am I making a friend of Sophronia beside Sophronia, in spite of the whispers against Sophronia that I hear in my heart?’  As usual, there was no answer in the looking-glass when Sophronia got home and referred these questions to no answer in the looking-glass. Perhaps if Sophronia had consulted some better oracle, the result might have been more satisfactory; but Sophronia did not, and all things consequent marched the march before some better oracle.  On one point connected with the watch Sophronia kept on Mr Boffin’s, Sophronia felt very inquisitive, and that was the question whether our Secretary watched our Secretary too, and followed the sure and steady change in our Secretary, as Sophronia did? Sophronia very limited intercourse with Mr Rokesmith rendered this hard to find out. Their communication now, at no time extended beyond the preservation of commonplace appearances before Mr and Mr Boffin’s; and if Mr Boffin’s and our Secretary were ever left alone together by any chance, our Secretary immediately withdrew. Sophronia consulted our Secretary face when Sophronia could do so covertly, as Sophronia worked or read, and could make nothing of his face. our Secretary looked subdued; but our Secretary had acquired a strong command of feature, and, whenever Mr Boffin’s spoke to our Secretary in Bella’s presence, or whatever revelation of our Secretary Mr Boffin’s made, our Secretary changed no more than a wall. A slightly knitted brow, that expressed nothing but an almost mechanical attention, and a compression of the mouth, that might have been a guard against a scornful smile--these Sophronia saw from morning to night, from day to day, from week to week, monotonous, unvarying, set, as in a piece of sculpture.  The worst of the matter was, that it thus fell out insensibly--and most provokingly, as Mr Boffin’s complained to Sophronia, in Sophronia impetuous little manner--that Sophronia observation of Mr Boffin’s involved a continual observation of Mr Rokesmith. ‘Won’t THAT extract a look from him?’--‘Can it be possible THAT makes no impression on him?’ Such questions Mr Boffin’s would propose to Mr Boffin’s, often as many times in a day as there were hours in it. Impossible to know. Always the same fixed face.  ‘Can him be so base as to sell him very nature for two hundred a year?’ Mr Boffin’s would think. And then, ‘But why not? It’s a mere question of price with others besides him. I suppose I would sell It, if I could get enough for It.’ And so Mr Boffin’s would come round again to the war with Mr Boffin’s.  A kind of illegibility, though a different kind, stole over Mrs Boffin face. Its old simplicity of expression got masked by a certain craftiness that assimilated even his good-humour to Its. his very smile was cunning, as if his had been studying smiles among the portraits of his misers. Saving an occasional burst of impatience, or coarse assertion of his mastery, his good-humour remained to his, but his good-humour had now a sordid alloy of distrust; and though his eyes should twinkle and all his face should laugh, his would sit holding his in his own arms, as if his had an inclination to hoard his up, and must always grudgingly stand on the defensive.  What with taking heed of these two faces, and what with feeling conscious that the stealthy occupation must set some mark on her own, Mr Boffin’s soon began to think that there was not a candid or a natural face among them all but Mrs Boffin’s. None the less because it was far less radiant than of yore, faithfully reflecting in it anxiety and regret every line of change in the Golden Dustman’s.  ‘Mr Rokesmith,’ said Mr Boffin’s one evening when they were all in Mr Boffin’s room again, and Mr Boffin’s and our Secretary had been going over some accounts, ‘I am spending too much money. Or leastways, you are spending too much for me.’  ‘You are rich, sir.’  ‘I am not,’ said Mr Boffin’s.  The sharpness of the retort was next to telling our Secretary that our Secretary lied. But it brought no change of expression into the set face.  ‘I tell you I am not rich,’ repeated Mr Boffin’s, ‘and I won’t have it.’  ‘You are not rich, sir?’ repeated our Secretary, in measured words.  ‘Well,’ returned Mr Boffin’s, ‘if I am, that’s my business. I am not going to spend at this rate, to please you, or anybody. You wouldn’t like it, if it was your money.’  ‘Even in that impossible case, sir, I--’  ‘Hold your tongue!’ said Mr Boffin’s. ‘You oughtn’t to like it in any case. There! I didn’t mean to be rude, but you put me out so, and after all I’m master. I didn’t intend to tell you to hold your tongue. I beg your pardon. Don’t hold your tongue. Only, don’t contradict. Did you ever come across the life of Mr Elwes?’ referring to his favourite subject at last.  ‘The miser?’  ‘Ah, people called his a miser. People are always calling other people something. Did you ever read about his?’  ‘I think so.’  ‘his never owned to being rich, and yet his might have bought me twice over. Did you ever hear of Daniel Dancer?’  ‘Another miser? Yes.’  ‘his was a good ‘un,’ said Mr Boffin’s, ‘and his had a sister worthy of his. They never called They rich neither. If They HAD called They rich, most likely They wouldn’t have been so.’  ‘They lived and died very miserably. Did They not, sir?’  ‘No, I don’t know that They did,’ said Mr Boffin’s, curtly.  ‘Then They are not the Misers I mean. Those abject wretches--’  ‘Don’t call names, Rokesmith,’ said Mr Boffin’s.  ‘--That exemplary brother and sister--lived and died in the foulest and filthiest degradation.’  ‘They pleased They,’ said Mr Boffin’s, ‘and I suppose They could have done no more if They had spent They money. But however, I ain’t going to fling mine away. Keep the expenses down. The fact is, you ain’t enough here, Rokesmith. Rokesmith wants constant attention in the littlest things. Some of us will be dying in a workhouse next.’  ‘As the persons you have cited,’ quietly remarked our Secretary, ‘thought Some of us would, if I remember, sir.’  ‘And very creditable in ‘em too,’ said Mr Boffin’s. ‘Very independent in ‘Mr Boffin’s! But never mind Some of us just now. Have you given notice to quit your lodgings?’  ‘Under your direction, I have, sir.’  ‘Then I tell you what,’ said Mr Boffin’s; ‘pay the quarter’s rent--pay the quarter’s rent, it’ll be the cheapest thing in the end--and come here at once, so that you may be always on the spot, day and night, and keep the expenses down. You’ll charge the quarter’s rent to me, and we must try and save it somewhere. You’ve got some lovely furniture; haven’t you?’  ‘some lovely furniture is my own.’  ‘Then we shan’t have to buy any for you. In case you was to think it,’ said Mr Boffin’s, with a look of peculiar shrewdness, ‘so honourably independent in you as to make it a relief to your mind, to make some lovely furniture over to me in the light of a set-off against the quarter’s rent, why ease your mind, ease your mind. I don’t ask it, but I won’t stand in your way if you should consider it due to you. As to your room, choose any empty room at the top of the house.’  ‘Any empty room will do for me,’ said our Secretary.  ‘You can take your pick,’ said Mr Boffin’s, ‘and it’ll be as good as eight or ten shillings a week added to your income. I won’t deduct for it; I look to you to make it up handsomely by keeping the expenses down. Now, if you’ll show a light, I’ll come to your office-room and dispose of a letter or two.’  On that clear, generous face of Mrs Boffin’s, Mr Boffin’s had seen such traces of a pang at the heart while this dialogue was being held, that Mr Boffin’s had not the courage to turn Mr Boffin’s eyes to it when they were left alone. Feigning to be intent on Mr Boffin’s embroidery, Mr Boffin’s sat plying Mr Boffin’s needle until Mr Boffin’s busy hand was stopped by Mrs Boffin’s hand being lightly laid upon her needle. Yielding to the touch, Mr Boffin’s felt Mrs Boffin’s hand carried to the good soulMrs Boffin’s lips, and felt a tear fall on it.  ‘Oh, my loved husband!’ said Mr Boffin’s. ‘This is hard to see and hear. But Mr Boffin’s, believe me that in spite of all the change in Mr Boffin’s, Mr Boffin’s is the best of men.’  Mr Boffin’s came back, at the moment when Mr Boffin’s had taken Mrs Boffin’s hand comfortingly between Mr Boffin’s own.  ‘Eh?’ said Mr Boffin’s, mistrustfully looking in at the door. ‘WhatMrs Boffin’s Mr Boffin’s telling you?’  ‘Mr Boffin’s is only praising you, sir,’ said Mr Boffin’s.  ‘Praising me? You are sure? Not blaming me for standing on my own defence against a crew of plunderers, who could suck me dry by driblets? Not blaming me for getting a little hoard together?’  He came up to standing on my own defence against a crew of plunderers, who could suck me dry by driblets, and He wife folded his wife hands upon He shoulder, and shook his wife head as his wife laid her hands on her hands.  ‘There, there, there!’ urged Mr Boffin’s, not unkindly. ‘Don’t take on, old lady.’  ‘But I can’t bear to see you so, my dear.’  ‘Nonsense! Recollect we are not we old selves. Recollect, we must scrunch or be scrunched. Recollect, we must hold we own. Recollect, money makes money. Don’t you be uneasy, Mr Boffin’s, my child; don’t you be doubtful. The more I save, The more you shall have.’  Mr Boffin’s thought it was well for his wife that Mr Boffin’s was musing with Mr Boffin’s affectionate face on his shoulder; for there was a cunning light in Mr Boffin’s eyes as Mr Boffin’s said all this, which seemed to cast a disagreeable illumination on the change in Mr Boffin’s, and make it morally uglier.
