 THE WHOLE CASE SO FAR   Bradley Headstone held fast by that other interview Bradley Headstone was to have with Lizzie Hexam.
In stipulating for it, Bradley Headstone had been impelled by a feeling little short of desperation, and the feeling abided by Bradley Headstone.
It was very soon after Bradley Headstone interview with the Secretary, that Bradley Headstone and Lizzie Hexam set out one leaden evening, not unnoticed by Miss Peecher, to have this desperate interview accomplished.
‘That dolls’ dressmaker,’ said Bradley, ‘is favourable neither to me nor to you, Hexam.’  ‘A pert crooked little chit, Mr Headstone!
I knew she would put she in the way, if she could, and would be sure to strike in with something impertinent.
It was on that account that I proposed our going to the City to-night and meeting my sister.’  ‘So I supposed,’ said Bradley, getting Bradley gloves on Bradley nervous hands as Bradley walked.
‘So I supposed.’  ‘Nobody but my sister,’ pursued Charley, ‘would have found out such an extraordinary companion.
my sister has done such an extraordinary companion in a ridiculous fancy of giving my sister up to another.
my sister told me so, that night when our went there.’  ‘Why should my sister give my sister up to ’ dressmaker?’ asked Bradley.
‘Oh!’ said the boy, colouring.
‘One of my sister romantic ideas!
I tried to convince my sister so, but I didn’t succeed.
However, what our have got to do, is, to succeed to-night, Mr Headstone, and then all the rest follows.’  ‘You are still sanguine, Hexam.’  ‘Certainly I am, sir.
Why, our have everything on our side.’  ‘Except my sister, perhaps,’ thought Bradley.
But Bradley only gloomily thought it, and said nothing.
‘everything on our sideour side,’ repeated Bradley with boyish confidence.
‘Respectability, an excellent connexion for me, common sense, everything!’  ‘To be sure, my sister has always shown my sister a devoted sister,’ said Bradley, willing to sustain my sister on even that low ground of hope.
‘Naturally, Mr Headstone, I have a good deal of influence with my sister.
And now that you have honoured me with your confidence and spoken to me first, I say again, our have everything on our sideour side.’  And Bradley thought again, ‘Except my sister, perhaps.’  A grey dusty withered evening in the City has not a hopeful aspect.
The closed warehouses and offices have an air of death about The closed warehouses and offices, and the national dread of colour has an air of mourning.
The towers and steeples of the many house-encompassed churches, dark and dingy as the sky that seems descending on the many house-encompassed churches, dark and dingy, are no relief to the general gloom; a sun-dial on a church-wall has the look, in a church-wall useless black shade, of having failed in a church-wall business enterprise and stopped payment for ever; melancholy waifs and strays of housekeepers and porter sweep melancholy waifs and strays of papers and pins into the kennels, and other more melancholy waifs and strays explore them, searching and stooping and poking for anything to sell.
The set of humanity outward from the City is as a set of prisoners departing from gaol, and dismal Newgate seems quite as fit a stronghold for the mighty Lord Mayor as the mighty Lord Mayor own state-dwelling.
On such an evening, when the city grit gets into the hair and eyes and skin, and when the fallen leaves of the few unhappy city trees grind down in corners under wheels of wind, the schoolmaster and the pupil emerged upon the Leadenhall Street region, spying eastward for Lizzie.
Being something too soon in their arrival, their lurked at a corner, waiting for Lizzie to appear.
The best-looking among us will not look very well, lurking at a corner, and Bradley came out of that disadvantage very poorly indeed.
‘Here Lizzie comes, Mr Headstone!
Let us go forward and meet Lizzie.’  As they advanced, Lizzie saw they coming, and seemed rather troubled.
But Lizzie greeted Lizzie brother with the usual warmth, and touched the extended hand of Bradley.
‘Why, where are you going, Charley, dear?’ Lizzie asked her brother then.
‘Nowhere.
us came on purpose to meet you.’  ‘To meet me, Charley?’  ‘Yes.
us are going to walk with Charley.
But don’t let us take the great leading streets where every one walks, and us can’t hear us speak.
Let us go by the quiet backways.
Here’s a large paved court by this church, and quiet, too.
Let us go up here.’  ‘But it’s not in the way, Charley.’  ‘Yes it is,’ said the boy, petulantly.
‘It’s in my way, and my way is yours.’  Lizzie had not released his hand, and, still holding his hand, looked at his with a kind of appeal.
his avoided Lizzie eyes, under pretence of saying, ‘Come along, Mr Headstone.’ Bradley walked at Bradley side--not at hers--and the brother and sister walked hand in hand.
The court brought the brother and sister to a churchyard; a paved square court, with a raised bank of earth about breast high, in the middle, enclosed by iron rails.
Here, conveniently and healthfully elevated above the level of the living, were the dead, and the tombstones; some of the latter droopingly inclined from the perpendicular, as if the brother and sister were ashamed of the lies the brother and sister told.
the brother and sister paced the whole of this place once, in a constrained and uncomfortable manner, when the boy stopped and said:  ‘Lizzie, Mr Headstone has something to say to Lizzie.
I don’t wish to be an interruption either to the boy or to Lizzie, and so I’ll go and take a little stroll and come back.
I know in a general way what Mr Headstone intends to say, and I very highly approve of it, as I hope--and indeed I do not doubt--you will.
I needn’t tell you, Lizzie, that I am under great obligations to Mr Headstone, and that I am very anxious for Mr Headstone to succeed in all Mr Headstone undertakes.
As I hope--and as, indeed, I don’t doubt--you must be.’  ‘Charley,’ returned his sister, detaining his hand as his withdrew his hand, ‘I think you had better stay.
I think Mr Headstone had better not say what Mr Headstone thinks of saying.’  ‘Why, how do you know what it is?’ returned the boy.
‘Perhaps I don’t, but--’  ‘Perhaps you don’t?
No, Lizzie, I should think not.
If you knew what it was, you would give me a very different answer.
There; let go; be sensible.
I wonder you don’t remember that Mr Headstone is looking on.’  Lizzie allowed Mr Headstone to separate Mr Headstone from Lizzie, and Mr Headstone, after saying, ‘Now Lizzie, be a rational girl and a good sister,’ walked away.
Lizzie remained standing alone with Mr Headstone, and it was not until Lizzie raised Lizzie eyes, that Mr Headstone spoke.
‘I said,’ Mr Headstone began, ‘when I saw you last, that there was something unexplained, which might perhaps influence you.
I have come this evening to explain this evening.
I hope you will not judge of me by my hesitating manner when I speak to Lizzie.
You see me at my greatest disadvantage.
It is most unfortunate for me that I wish you to see me at my best, and that I know you see me at my worst.’  Lizzie moved slowly on when Mr Headstone paused, and Mr Headstone moved slowly on beside Lizzie.
‘It seems egotistical to begin by saying so much about Mr Headstone,’ Mr Headstone resumed, ‘but whatever I say to Lizzie seems, even in my own ears, below what I want to say, and different from what I want to say.
I can’t help it.
So it is.
You are the ruin of me.’  Lizzie started at the passionate sound of the last words, and at the passionate action of Mr Headstone hands, with which they were accompanied.
‘Yes!
you are the ruin--the ruin--the ruin--of me.
I have no resources in me, I have no confidence in me, I have no government of me when you are near me or in my thoughts.
And you are always in my thoughts now.
I have never been quit of Lizzie since I first saw you.
Oh, that was a wretched day for me!
That was a wretched, miserable day!’  A touch of pity for him mingled with her dislike of him, and her said: ‘Mr Headstone, I am grieved to have done you any harm, but I have never meant any harm.’  ‘There!’ him cried, despairingly.
‘Now, I seem to have reproached you, instead of revealing to you the state of my own mind!
Bear with him.
I am always wrong when you are in question.
It is my doom.’  Struggling with him, and by times looking up at the deserted windows of the houses as if there could be anything written in their grimy panes that would help him, him paced the whole pavement at her side, before him spoke again.
‘I must try to give expression to what is in my mind; it shall and must be spoken.
Though you see me so confounded--though you strike me so helpless--I ask you to believe that there are many people who think well of him; that there are some people who highly esteem me; that I have in my way won a Station which is considered worth winning.’  ‘Surely, Mr Headstone, I do believe it.
Surely I have always known it from Charley.’  ‘I ask you to believe that if I were to offer my home such as it is, my station such as it is, my affections such as such are, to any one of the best considered, and best qualified, and most distinguished, among the young women engaged in my calling, such would probably be accepted.
Even readily accepted.’  ‘I do not doubt it,’ said Lizzie, with Lizzie eyes upon the ground.
‘I have sometimes had it in my thoughts to make that offer and to settle down as many men of my class do: I on the one side of a school, my wife on the other, both of us interested in the same work.’  ‘Why have you not done so?’ asked Lizzie Hexam.
‘Why do you not do so?’  ‘Far better that I never did!
The only one grain of comfort I have had these many weeks,’ he said, always speaking passionately, and, when most emphatic, repeating that former action of he hands, which was like flinging he heart’s blood down before Lizzie in drops upon the pavement-stones; ‘the only one grain of comfort I have had these many weeks is, that I never did.
For if I had, and if the same spell had come upon he for my ruin, I know I should have broken that tie asunder as if the same spell had come upon me for my ruin had been thread.’  Lizzie glanced at he with a glance of fear, and a shrinking gesture.
he answered, as if Lizzie had spoken.
‘No!
It would not have been voluntary on my part, any more than It is voluntary in he to be here now.
You draw me to he.
If I were shut up in a strong prison, you would draw me out.
I should break through a church-wall to come to he.
If I were lying on a sick bed, you would draw me up--to stagger to your feet and fall there.’  The wild energy of the man, now quite let loose, was absolutely terrible.
the man stopped and laid the man upon a piece of the coping of the burial-ground enclosure, as if the man would have dislodged the stone.
‘No man knows till the time comes, what depths are within No man.
To some men it never comes; let some men rest and be thankful!
To he, you brought it; on he, you forced it; and the bottom of this raging sea,’ striking No man upon the breast, ‘has been heaved up ever since.’  ‘Mr Headstone, I have heard enough.
Let me stop you here.
It will be better for Mr Headstone and better for he.
Let us find her brother.’  ‘Not yet.
It shall and must be spoken.
I have been in torments ever since I stopped short of It before.
You are alarmed.
It is another of my miseries that I cannot speak to Mr Headstone or speak of Mr Headstone without stumbling at every syllable, unless I let the check go altogether and run mad.
Here is a man lighting the lamps.
a man lighting the lamps will be gone directly.
I entreat of Mr Headstone let us walk round this place again.
You have no reason to look alarmed; I can restrain he, and I will.’  She yielded to the entreaty--how could She do otherwise!--and they paced the stones in silence.
One by one the lights leaped up making the cold grey church tower more remote, and the lights were alone again.
He said no more until the lights had regained the spot where He had broken off; there, He again stood still, and again grasped the stone.
In saying what He said then, He never looked at She; but looked at it and wrenched at it.
‘You know what I am going to say.
I love you.
What other men may mean when other men use that expression, I cannot tell; what I mean is, that I am under the influence of some tremendous attraction which I have resisted in vain, and which overmasters me.
You could draw me to fire, you could draw me to water, you could draw me to the gallows, you could draw me to any death, you could draw me to anything I have most avoided, you could draw me to any exposure and disgrace.
This and the confusion of my thoughts, so that I am fit for nothing, is what I mean by your being the ruin of me.
But if you would return a favourable answer to my offer of me in marriage, you could draw me to any good--every good--with equal force.
My circumstances are quite easy, and you would want for nothing.
My reputation stands quite high, and would be a shield for yours.
If you saw me at my work, able to do you saw me at my work well and respected in you saw me at my work, you might even come to take a sort of pride in me;--I would try hard that you should.
Whatever considerations I may have thought of against my offer of myself in marriage, I have conquered, and I make my offer of myself in marriage with all my heart.
Your brother favours me to the utmost, and it is likely that we might live and work together; anyhow, it is certain that Your brother would have my best influence and support.
I don’t know what I could say more if I tried.
I might only weaken what is ill enough said as it is.
I only add that if it is any claim on you to be in earnest, I am in thorough earnest, dreadful earnest.’  The powdered mortar from under the stone at which he wrenched, rattled on the pavement to confirm he words.
‘Mr Headstone--’  ‘Stop!
I implore you, before you answer me, to walk round this place once more.
this place will give you a minute’s time to think, and me a minute’s time to get some fortitude together.’  Again she yielded to the entreaty, and again they came back to the same place, and again he worked at the stone.
‘Is it,’ he said, with he attention apparently engrossed by it, ‘yes, or no?’  ‘Mr Headstone, I thank you sincerely, I thank you gratefully, and hope you may find a worthy wife before long and be very happy.
But it is no.’  ‘Is no short time necessary for reflection; no weeks or days?’ he asked, in the same half-suffocated way.
‘None whatever.’  ‘Are you quite decided, and is there no chance of any change in my favour?’  ‘I am quite decided, Mr Headstone, and I am bound to answer I am certain there is none.’  ‘Then,’ said he, suddenly changing he tone and turning to a worthy wife, and bringing he clenched hand down upon the stone with a force that laid the knuckles raw and bleeding; ‘then I hope that I may never kill he!’  The dark look of hatred and revenge with which the words broke from he livid lips, and with which he stood holding out he smeared hand as if his smeared hand held some weapon and had just struck a mortal blow, made her so afraid of he that her turned to run away.
But he caught her by the arm.
‘Mr Headstone, let me go.
Mr Headstone, I must call for help!’  ‘It is I who should call for help,’ he said; ‘you don’t know yet how much I need it.’  The working of he face as her shrank from it, glancing round for her and uncertain what to do, might have extorted a cry from her in another instant; but all at once he sternly stopped it and fixed it, as if Death itself had done so.
‘There!
You see I have recovered he.
Hear me out.’  With much of the dignity of courage, as her recalled her self-reliant life and her right to be free from accountability to this man, her released her arm from this man grasp and stood looking full at this man.
her had never been so handsome, in this man eyes.
A shade came over them while this man looked back at her, as if her drew the very light out of them to her.
‘This time, at least, I will leave nothing unsaid,’ this man went on, folding this man hands before this man, clearly to prevent this man being betrayed into any impetuous gesture; ‘this last time at least I will not be tortured with after-thoughts of a lost opportunity.
Mr Eugene Wrayburn.’  ‘Was it of this man you spoke in your ungovernable rage and violence?’ Lizzie Hexam demanded with spirit.
this man bit this man lip, and looked at her, and said never a word.
‘Was it Mr Eugene Wrayburn that you threatened?’  this man bit his lip again, and looked at her, and said never a word.
‘You asked me to hear you out, and you will not speak.
Let me find her brother.’  ‘Stay!
I threatened no one.’  her look dropped for an instant to this man bleeding hand.
this man lifted no one to this man mouth, wiped no one on this man sleeve, and again folded no one over the other.
‘Mr Eugene Wrayburn,’ Mr Eugene Wrayburn repeated.
‘Why do you mention that name again and again, Mr Headstone?’  ‘Because it is the text of the little I have left to say.
Observe!
There are no threats in it.
If I utter a threat, stop me, and fasten a threat upon me.
Mr Eugene Wrayburn.’  A worse threat than was conveyed in Mr Eugene Wrayburn manner of uttering the name, could hardly have escaped Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
‘Mr Eugene Wrayburn haunts you.
You accept favours from Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
You are willing enough to listen to Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
I know it, as well as Mr Eugene Wrayburn does.’  ‘Mr Eugene Wrayburn has been considerate and good to me, sir,’ said Lizzie, proudly, ‘in connexion with Death itself and with the memory of my poor father.’  ‘No doubt.
He is of course a very considerate and a very good man, Mr Eugene Wrayburn.’  ‘He is nothing to you, I think,’ said Lizzie, with an indignation Lizzie could not repress.
‘Oh yes, He is.
There you mistake.
He is much to me.’  ‘What can He be to you?’  ‘He can be a rival to me among other things,’ said Bradley.
‘Mr Headstone,’ returned Lizzie, with a burning face, ‘it is cowardly in you to speak to me in this way.
But it makes me able to tell you that I do not like you, and that I never have liked you from the first, and that no other living creature has anything to do with the effect you have produced upon me for you.’  He head bent for a moment, as if under a weight, and He then looked up again, moistening He lips.
‘I was going on with the little I had left to say.
I knew all this about Mr Eugene Wrayburn, all the while you were drawing me to Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
I strove against the knowledge, but quite in vain.
It made no difference in me.
With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind, I went on.
With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mindmy mind, I spoke to Mr Eugene Wrayburn just now.
With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mindmy mind, I have been set aside and I have been cast out.’  ‘If you give those names to my thanking you for your proposal and declining your proposal, is your proposal my fault, Mr Headstone?’ said Lizzie, compassionating the bitter struggle Mr Headstone could not conceal, almost as much as Lizzie was repelled and alarmed by it.
‘I am not complaining,’ Mr Headstone returned, ‘I am only stating the case.
I had to wrestle with my self-respect when I submitted to be drawn to you in spite of Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
You may imagine how low my self-respect lies now.’  Lizzie was hurt and angry; but repressed Lizzie in consideration of Mr Headstone suffering, and of Mr Headstone being Lizzie brother’s friend.
‘And it lies under Mr Headstone feet,’ said Bradley, unfolding his hands in spite of Mr Headstone, and fiercely motioning with them both towards the stones of the pavement.
‘Remember that!
It lies under that fellow’s feet, and Mr Headstone treads upon It and exults above It.’  ‘Mr Headstone does not!’ said Lizzie.
‘Mr Headstone does!’ said Bradley.
‘I have stood before Mr Headstone face to face, and Mr Headstone crushed me down in the dirt of Mr Headstone contempt, and walked over Mr Headstone.
Why?
Because Mr Headstone knew with triumph what was in store for me to-night.’  ‘O, Mr Headstone, you talk quite wildly.’  ‘Quite collectedly.
I know what I say too well.
Now I have said all.
I have used no threat, remember; I have done no more than show you how the case stands;--how the case stands, so far.’  At this moment Your brother sauntered into view close by.
her darted to Your brother, and caught Your brother by the hand.
Bradley followed, and laid the hand on the boy’s opposite shoulder.
‘Charley Hexam, I am going home.
I must walk home by Mr Headstone to-night, and get shut up in my room without being spoken to.
Give me half an hour’s start, and let me be, till you find me at my work in the morning.
I shall be at my work in the morning in the morning just as usual.’  Clasping his hands, Mr Headstone uttered a short unearthly broken cry, and went Mr Headstone way.
The brother and sister were left looking at one another near a lamp in the solitary churchyard, and the boy’s face clouded and darkened, as the boy’s said in a rough tone: ‘What is the meaning of this?
What have you done to my best friend?
Out with the truth!’  ‘Charley!’ said sister.
‘Speak a little more considerately!’  ‘I am not in the humour for consideration, or for nonsense of any sort,’ replied the boy’s.
‘What have you been doing?
Why has Mr Headstone gone from us in that way?’  ‘Mr Headstone asked me--you know Mr Headstone asked me--to be Mr Headstone wife, Charley.’  ‘Well?’ said the boy, impatiently.
‘And I was obliged to tell Mr Headstone that I could not be Mr Headstone wife.’  ‘You were obliged to tell Mr Headstone,’ repeated the boy’s angrily, between Mr Headstone teeth, and rudely pushing his wife away.
‘You were obliged to tell the boy’s!
Do you know that the boy’s is worth fifty of Mr Headstone?’  ‘It may easily be so, Charley, but I cannot marry the boy’s.’  ‘You mean that you are conscious that you can’t appreciate the boy’s, and don’t deserve the boy’s, I suppose?’  ‘I mean that I do not like the boy’s, Charley, and that I will never marry the boy’s.’  ‘Upon my soul,’ exclaimed the boy’s, ‘you are a nice picture of a sister!
Upon my soul, you are a pretty piece of disinterestedness!
And so all my endeavours to cancel the past and to raise myself in the world, and to raise you with myself, are to be beaten down by YOUR low whims; are YOUR low whims?’  ‘I will not reproach you, Charley.’  ‘Hear his wife!’ exclaimed the boy’s, looking round at the darkness.
‘his wife won’t reproach me!
his wife does his wife best to destroy my fortunes and his wife own, and his wife won’t reproach me!
Why, you’ll tell me, next, that you won’t reproach Mr Headstone for coming out of the sphere to which Mr Headstone is an ornament, and putting Mr Headstone at YOUR feet, to be rejected by Mr Headstone!’  ‘No, Charley; I will only tell you, as I told Mr Headstone, that I thank Mr Headstone for doing so, that I am sorry Mr Headstone did so, and that I hope Mr Headstone will do much better, and be happy.’  Some touch of compunction smote the boy’s’s hardening heart as the boy’s looked upon her, the boy’s patient little nurse in infancy, the boy’s patient friend, adviser, and reclaimer in boyhood, the self-forgetting sister who had done everything for the boy’s.
the boy’s tone relented, and the boy’s drew her through the boy’s.
‘Now, come, her; don’t let us quarrel: let us be reasonable and talk this over like The brother and sister.
Will you listen to her?’  ‘Oh, Charley!’ her replied through her starting tears; ‘do I not listen to her, and hear many hard things!’  ‘Then I am sorry.
There, her!
I am unfeignedly sorry.
Only you do put me out so.
Now see.
Mr Headstone is perfectly devoted to her.
Mr Headstone has told me in the strongest manner that Mr Headstone has never been Mr Headstone old self for one single minute since I first brought Mr Headstone to see you.
Miss Peecher, our schoolmistress--pretty and young, and all that--is known to be very much attached to Mr Headstone, and Mr Headstone won’t so much as look at her or hear of her.
Now, Mr Headstone devotion to her must be a disinterested one; mustn’t it?
If Mr Headstone married Miss Peecher, Mr Headstone would be a great deal better off in all worldly respects, than in marrying you.
Well then; Mr Headstone has nothing to get by it, has Mr Headstone?’  ‘Nothing, Heaven knows!’  ‘Very well then,’ said the boy; ‘that’s something in the boy favour, and a great thing.
Then I come in.
Mr Headstone has always got me on, and Mr Headstone has a good deal in Mr Headstone power, and of course if Mr Headstone was my brother-in-law Mr Headstone wouldn’t get me on less, but would get me on more.
Mr Headstone comes and confides in me, in a very delicate way, and says, “I hope my marrying your sister would be agreeable to you, Hexam, and useful to you?” I say, “There’s nothing in the world, Mr Headstone, that I could be better pleased with.Mr Headstone Mr Headstone says, “Then I may rely upon your intimate knowledge of Mr Headstone for your good word with your sister, Hexam?”  And I say, “Certainly, Mr Headstone, and naturally I have a good deal of influence with Mr Headstone.” So I have; haven’t I, her?’  ‘Yes, Charley.’  ‘Well said!
Now, you see, we begin to get on, the moment we begin to be really talking it over, like brother and sister.
Very well.
Then YOU come in.
As Mr Headstone ’s wife you would be occupying a most respectable station, and you would be holding a far better place in society than you hold now, and you would at length get quit of the river-side and the old disagreeables belonging to it, and you would be rid for good of dolls’ dressmakers and dolls drunken fathers, and the like of that.
Not that I want to disparage Miss Jenny Wren: I dare say Miss Jenny Wren is all very well in Miss Jenny Wren way; but Miss Jenny Wren way is not your way as Mr Headstone wife.
Now, you see, her, on all three accounts--on Mr Headstone’s, on mine, on her--nothing could be better or more desirable.’  mine, on yours were walking slowly as the boy’s spoke, and here the boy’s stood still, to see what effect the boy’s had made.
the boy’s sister’s eyes were fixed upon the boy’s; but as mine, on yours showed no yielding, and as His sister’s eyes remained silent, the boy’s walked His sister’s eyes on again.
There was some discomfiture in the boy’s tone as the boy’s resumed, though the boy’s tried to conceal some discomfiture.
‘Having so much influence with her, her, as I have, perhaps I should have done better to have had a little chat with her in the first instance, before Mr Headstone spoke for Mr Headstone.
But really all this in his favour seemed so plain and undeniable, and I knew you to have always been so reasonable and sensible, that I didn’t consider his favour worth while.
Very likely that was a mistake of mine.
However, his favour’s soon set right.
All that need be done to set his favour right, is for you to tell me at once that I may go home and tell Mr Headstone that what has taken place is not final, and that it will all come round by-and-by.’  Mr Headstone stopped again.
The pale face looked anxiously and lovingly at Mr Headstone, but The pale face shook The pale face head.
‘Can’t you speak?’ said Mr Headstone sharply.
‘I am very unwilling to speak, Charley.
If I must, I must.
I cannot authorize you to say any such thing to Mr Headstone: I cannot allow you to say any such thing to Mr Headstone.
Nothing remains to be said to Mr Headstone from Mr Headstone, after what I have said for good and all, to-night.’  ‘And The pale face,’ cried Mr Headstone, contemptuously throwing The pale face off again, ‘calls The pale face a sister!’  ‘Charley, dear, that is the second time that you have almost struck me.
Don’t be hurt by my words.
I don’t mean--Heaven forbid!--that you intended it; but you hardly know with what a sudden swing you removed yourself from Mr Headstone.’  ‘However!’ said Mr Headstone, taking no heed of the remonstrance, and pursuing Mr Headstone own mortified disappointment, ‘I know what this means, and you shall not disgrace me.’  ‘It means what I have told you, Charley, and nothing more.’  ‘That’s not true,’ said the boy in a violent tone, ‘and you know itThat’s not true.
it means your precious Mr Eugene Wrayburn; that’s what it means.’  CharleyCharley!
If you remember any old days of ours together, forbear!’  ‘But you shall not disgrace me,’ doggedly pursued Mr Headstone.
‘I am determined that after I have climbed up out of the mire, you shall not pull me down.
You can’t disgrace me if I have nothing to do with you, and I will have nothing to do with you for the future.’  CharleyCharley!
On many a night like this, and many a worse night, I have sat on the stones of the street, hushing you in my arms.
Unsay those words without even saying you are sorry for those words, and my arms are open to you still, and so is my heart.’  ‘I’ll not unsay those words.
I’ll say those words again.
You are an inveterately bad girl, and a false sister, and I have done with you.
For ever, I have done with you!’  He threw up He ungrateful and ungracious hand as if it set up a barrier between his ungrateful and ungracious hand, and flung He upon He heel and left her.
her remained impassive on the same spot, silent and motionless, until the striking of the church clock roused her, and her turned away.
But then, with the breaking up of her immobility came the breaking up of the waters that the cold heart of Mr Headstone had frozen.
And ‘O that I were lying here with the dead!’ and ‘O Charley, Charley, that this should be the end of our pictures in the fire!’ were all the words her said, as her laid her face in her hands on the stone coping.
A figure passed by, and passed on, but stopped and looked round at her.
It was the figure of an old man with a bowed head, wearing a large brimmed low-crowned hat, and a long-skirted coat.
After hesitating a little, the figure of an old man with a bowed head turned back, and, advancing with an air of gentleness and compassion, said:  ‘Pardon me, young woman, for speaking to you, but you are under some distress of mind.
I cannot pass upon my way and leave you weeping here alone, as if there was nothing in the place.
Can I help you?
Can I do anything to give you comfort?’  her raised her head at the sound of these kind words, and answered gladly, ‘O, Mr Riah, is it you?’  ‘her,’ said the old man, ‘I stand amazed!
I spoke as to a stranger.
Take my arm, take my arm.
What grieves you?
Who has done this?
Poor girl, poor girl!’  ‘My brother has quarrelled with me,’ sobbed Lizzie, ‘and renounced me.’  ‘My brother is a thankless dog,’ said the Jew, angrily.
‘Let My brother go.
Shake the dust from thy feet and let My brother go.
Come, her!
Come home with me--it is but across the road--and take a little time to recover your peace and to make your eyes seemly, and then I will bear you company through the streets.
For it is past your usual time, and will soon be late, and the way is long, and there is much company out of doors to-night.’  her accepted the support My brother offered her, and they slowly passed out of the churchyard.
they were in the act of emerging into the main thoroughfare, when another figure loitering discontentedly by, and looking up the street and down it, and all about, started and exclaimed, ‘Lizzie!
why, where have you been?
Why, what’s the matter?’  As Eugene Wrayburn thus addressed Eugene Wrayburn, Eugene Wrayburn drew closer to the Jew, and bent Eugene Wrayburn .
the Jew having taken in the whole of Eugene at one sharp glance, cast the Jew eyes upon the ground, and stood mute.
‘Lizzie, what is the matter?’  ‘Eugene Wrayburn, I cannot tell you now.
I cannot tell you to-night, if I ever can tell you.
Pray leave me.’  ‘But, Lizzie, I came expressly to join you.
I came to walk home with Lizzie, having dined at a coffee-house in this neighbourhood and knowing your hour.
And I have been lingering about,’ added Eugene, ‘like a bailiff; or,’ with a look at Riah, ‘an old clothesman.’  the Jew lifted up his eyes, and took in Eugene once more, at another glance.
‘Mr Wrayburn, pray, pray, leave me with this protector.
And one thing more.
Pray, pray be careful of Lizzie.’  ‘Mysteries of Udolpho!’ said Eugene, with a look of wonder.
‘May I be excused for asking, in the elderly gentleman’s presence, who is this protector?’  ‘A trustworthy friend,’ said Lizzie.
‘I will relieve this protector of this protector trust,’ returned Eugene.
‘But you must tell me, Lizzie, what is the matter?’  ‘Lizzie brother is the matter,’ said the old man, lifting up Her brother again.
‘Her brother?’ returned Eugene, with airy contempt.
‘Our is not worth a thought, far less a tear.
What has Our done?’  the old man lifted up the old man again, with one grave look at Wrayburn, and one grave glance at Lizzie, as Lizzie stood looking down.
Both were so full of meaning that Eugene Eugene was checked in Eugene light career, and subsided into a thoughtful ‘Humph!’  With an air of perfect patience the old man, remaining mute and keeping his eyes cast down, stood, retaining Lizzie’s arm, as though in Eugene habit of passive endurance, it would be all one to Eugene if Eugene had stood there motionless all night.
‘If Mr Aaron,’ said Eugene, who soon found this fatiguing, ‘will be good enough to relinquish Mr Aaron charge to me, Mr Aaron will be quite free for any engagement Mr Aaron may have at the Synagogue.
Mr Aaron, will you have the kindness?’  But the old man stood stock still.
‘Good evening, Mr Aaron,’ said Eugene, politely; ‘we need not detain you.’ Then turning to Lizzie, ‘Is we friend Mr Aaron a little deaf?’  ‘My hearing is very good, Christian gentleman,’ replied the old man, calmly; ‘but I will hear only one voice to-night, desiring me to leave this damsel before I have conveyed this damsel to this damsel home.
If this damsel requests it, I will do it.
I will do it for no one else.’  ‘May I ask why so, Mr Aaron?’ said Eugene, quite undisturbed in Eugene ease.
‘Excuse me.
If this damsel asks me, I will tell this damsel,’ replied the old man.
‘I will tell no one else.’  ‘I do not ask you,’ said Lizzie, ‘and I beg you to take me home.
Eugene Wrayburn, I have had a bitter trial to-night, and I hope you will not think me ungrateful, or mysterious, or changeable.
I am neither; I am wretched.
Pray remember what I said to Eugene Wrayburn.
Pray, pray, take care.’  ‘My dear Lizzie,’ the old man returned, in a low voice, bending over this damsel on the other side; ‘of what?
Of whom?’  ‘Of any one you have lately seen and made angry.’  the old man snapped the old man fingers and laughed.
‘Come,’ said the old man, ‘since no better may be, Mr Aaron and I will divide this trust, and see you home together.
Mr Aaron on that side; I on this.
If perfectly agreeable to Mr Aaron, the escort will now proceed.’  the old man knew the old man power over this damsel.
the old man knew that this damsel would not insist upon the old man leaving this damsel.
the old man knew that, this damsel fears for the old man being aroused, this damsel would be uneasy if the old man were out of this damsel sight.
For all the old man seeming levity and carelessness, the old man knew whatever the old man chose to know of the thoughts of this damsel heart.
And going on at that side, so gaily, regardless of all that had been urged against the old man; so superior in the old man sallies and self-possession to the gloomy constraint of this damsel suitor and the selfish petulance of this damsel ; so faithful to this damsel, as it seemed, when this damsel own stock was faithless; what an immense advantage, what an overpowering influence, were the old man that night!
Add to the rest, poor girl, that this damsel had heard the old man vilified for this damsel sake, and that this damsel had suffered for the old man, and where the wonder that the old man occasional tones of serious interest (setting off the old man carelessness, as if his carelessness were assumed to calm this damsel), that the old man lightest touch, the old man lightest look, the old man very presence beside this damsel in the dark common street, were like glimpses of an enchanted world, which it was natural for jealousy and malice and all meanness to be unable to bear the brightness of, and to gird at as bad spirits might.
Nothing more being said of repairing to Riah’s, Nothing more went direct to Lizzie’s lodging.
A little short of the house-door she parted from Nothing more, and went in alone.
‘Mr Aaron,’ said Eugene, when they were left together in the street, ‘with many thanks for your company, it remains for Mr Aaron unwillingly to say Farewell.’  ‘Mr Aaron,’ returned the other, ‘I give you good night, and I wish that you were not so thoughtless.’  ‘Mr Aaron,’ returned Eugene, ‘I give you good night, and I wish (for you are a little dull) that you were not so thoughtful.’  But now, that Mr Aaron part was played out for the evening, and when in turning Mr Aaron back upon the Jew Mr Aaron came off the stage, Mr Aaron was thoughtful Mr Aaron.
‘How did Lightwood’s catechism run?’ Mr Aaron murmured, as Mr Aaron stopped to light Mr Aaron cigar.
‘What is to come of it?
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
We shall soon know now.
Ah!’ with a heavy sigh.
a heavy sigh was repeated as if by an echo, an hour afterwards, when Riah, who had been sitting on some dark steps in a corner over against the house, arose and went his patient way; stealing through the streets in his ancient dress, like the ghost of a departed Time.
