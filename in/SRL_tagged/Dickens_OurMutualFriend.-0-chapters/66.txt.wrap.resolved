 WHAT WAS CAUGHT IN THE TRAPS THAT WERE SET   How Bradley Headstone had been racked and riven in Bradley Headstone mind since the quiet evening when by the river-side Bradley Headstone had risen, as Bradley Headstone were, out of the ashes of the Bargeman, none but Bradley Headstone could have told. Not even Bradley Headstone could have told, for such misery can only be felt.  First, Bradley Headstone had to bear the combined weight of the knowledge of what Bradley Headstone had done, of that haunting reproach that Bradley Headstone might have done it so much better, and of the dread of discovery. This was load enough to crush Bradley Headstone, and Bradley Headstone laboured under it day and night. It was as heavy on Bradley Headstone in Bradley Headstone scanty sleep, as in Bradley Headstone red-eyed waking hours. It bore Bradley Headstone down with a dread unchanging monotony, in which there was not a moment’s variety. The overweighted beast of burden, or the overweighted slave, can for certain instants shift the physical load, and find some slight respite even in enforcing additional pain upon such a set of muscles or such a limb. Not even that poor mockery of relief could Bradley Headstone obtain, under the steady pressure of the infernal atmosphere into which Bradley Headstone had entered.  Time went by, and no visible suspicion dogged Bradley Headstone; Time went by, and in such public accounts of the attack as were renewed at intervals, Bradley Headstone began to see Mr Lightwood (who acted as lawyer for the injured man) straying further from the fact, going wider of the issue, and evidently slackening in Bradley Headstone zeal. By degrees, a glimmering of the cause of this began to break on Bradley’s sight. Then came the chance meeting with Mr Milvey at the railway station (where Mr Milvey often lingered in Mr Milvey leisure hours, as a place where any fresh news of Mr Milvey deed would be circulated, or any placard referring to his deed would be posted), and then Mr Milvey saw in the light what Mr Milvey had brought about.  For, then Mr Milvey saw that through Mr Milvey desperate attempt to separate those two for ever, Mr Milvey had been made the means of uniting them. That Mr Milvey had dipped Mr Milvey hands in blood, to mark Mr Milvey a miserable fool and tool. That Eugene Wrayburn, for Mr Milvey wife’s sake, set Mr Milvey aside and left Mr Milvey to crawl along Mr Milvey blasted course. Mr Milvey thought of Fate, or Providence, or be the directing Power what it might, as having put a fraud upon Mr Milvey--overreached Mr Milvey--and in Mr Milvey impotent mad rage bit, and tore, and had Mr Milvey fit.  New assurance of the truth came upon Mr Milvey in the next few following days, when New assurance of the truth was put forth how the wounded man had been married on the wounded man bed, and to whom, and how, though always in a dangerous condition, the wounded man was a shade better. Bradley would far rather have been seized for the wounded man murder, than Bradley would have read that passage, knowing Bradley spared, and knowing why.  But, not to be still further defrauded and overreached--which Bradley would be, if implicated by Riderhood, and punished by the law for Bradley abject failure, as though the law had been a success--Bradley kept close in Bradley school during the day, ventured out warily at night, and went no more to the railway station. Bradley examined the advertisements in the newspapers for any sign that Riderhood acted on Bradley hinted threat of so summoning Bradley to renew their acquaintance, but found none. Having paid Bradley handsomely for the support and accommodation Bradley had had at the Lock House, and knowing Bradley to be a very ignorant man who could not write, Bradley began to doubt whether Bradley was to be feared at all, or whether they need ever meet again.  All this time, Bradley mind was never off the rack, and Bradley raging sense of having been made to fling Bradley across the chasm which divided those two, and bridge it over for their coming together, never cooled down. This horrible condition brought on other fits. Bradley could not have said how many, or when; but Bradley saw in the faces of Bradley pupils that they had seen Bradley in that state, and that they were possessed by a dread of Bradley relapsing.  One winter day when a slight fall of snow was feathering the sills and frames of the schoolroom windows, Bradley stood at Bradley black board, crayon in hand, about to commence with a class; when, reading in the countenances of those boys that there was something wrong, and that those boys seemed in alarm for Bradley, Bradley turned Bradley eyes to the door towards which those boys faced. Bradley then saw a slouching man of forbidding appearance standing in the midst of the school, with a bundle under Bradley arm; and saw that it was Riderhood.  Bradley sat down on a stool which one of Bradley boys put for Bradley, and Bradley had a passing knowledge that Bradley was in danger of falling, and that Bradley face was becoming distorted. But, the fit went off for that time, and Bradley wiped Bradley mouth, and stood up again.  ‘Beg your pardon, governor! By your leave!’ said Riderhood, knuckling Bradley forehead, with a chuckle and a leer. ‘What place may this be?’  ‘This is a school.’  ‘Where young folks learns wot’s right?’ said Riderhood, gravely nodding. ‘Beg your pardon, governor! By your leave! But who teaches the school?’  ‘I do.’  ‘You’re the master, are you, learned governor?’  ‘Yes. I am the master.’  ‘And a lovely thing it must be,’ said Riderhood, ‘fur to learn young folks wot’s right, and fur to know wot THEY know wot you do it. Beg your pardon, learned governor! By your leave!--That there black board; wot’s it for?’  ‘It is for drawing on, or writing on.’  ‘Is it though!’ said Riderhood. ‘Who’d have thought it, from the looks on it! WOULD you be so kind as write your name upon it, learned governor?’ (In a wheedling tone.)  Bradley hesitated for a moment; but placed Bradley usual signature, enlarged, upon the board.  ‘I ain’t a learned character myself,’ said Riderhood, surveying the class, ‘but I do admire learning in others. I should dearly like to hear these here young folks read that there name off, from the writing.’  The arms of the class went up. At the miserable master’s nod, the shrill chorus arose: ‘Bradley Headstone!’  ‘No?’ cried Riderhood. ‘You don’t mean it? Bradley Headstone! Why, that’s in a churchyard. Hooroar for another turn!’  Another tossing of arms, another nod, and another shrill chorus:  ‘Bradley Headstone!’  ‘I’ve got it now!’ said Riderhood, after attentively listening, and internally repeating: Bradley. I see. Chris’en name, Bradley sim’lar to Roger which is my own. Eh? Fam’ly name, Headstone, sim’lar to Riderhood which is my own. Eh?’  Shrill chorus. ‘Yes!’  ‘Might you be acquainted, learned governor,’ said Riderhood, ‘with a person of about your own heighth and breadth, and wot ‘ud pull down in a scale about your own weight, answering to a name sounding summat like Totherest?’  With a desperation in him that made him perfectly quiet, though him jaw was heavily squared; with him eyes upon Riderhood; and with traces of quickened breathing in him nostrils; the schoolmaster replied, in a suppressed voice, after a pause: ‘I think I know the man you mean.’  ‘I thought you knowed the man I mean, learned governor. I want the man you mean.’  With a half glance around the man you mean at the man you mean pupils, Bradley returned:  ‘Do you suppose the man you mean is here?’  ‘Begging your pardon, learned governor, and by your leave,’ said Riderhood, with a laugh, ‘how could I suppose the man you mean’s here, when there’s nobody here but you, and me, and these young lambs wot you’re a learning on? But the man you mean is most excellent company, that man, and I want the man you mean to come and see me at my Lock, up the river.’  ‘I’ll tell the man you mean so.’  ‘D’ye think the man you mean’ll come?’ asked Riderhood.  ‘I am sure the man you mean will.’  ‘Having got your word for the man you mean,’ said Riderhood, ‘I shall count upon the man you mean. P’raps you’d so fur obleege me, learned governor, as tell the man you mean that if the man you mean don’t come precious soon, I’ll look the man you mean up.’  ‘the man you mean shall know it.’  ‘Thankee. As I says a while ago,’ pursued Riderhood, changing the man you mean hoarse tone and leering round upon the class again, ‘though not a learned character my own self, I do admire learning in others, to be sure! Being here and having met with your kind attention, Master, might I, afore I go, ask a question of these here young lambs of yourn?’  ‘If it is in the way of school,’ said Bradley, always sustaining Bradley dark look at the other, and speaking in Bradley suppressed voice, ‘you may.’  ‘Oh! It’s in the way of school!’ cried Riderhood. ‘I’ll pound it, Master, to be in the way of school. Wot’s the diwisions of water, my lambs? wot sorts of water is there on the land?’  Shrill chorus: ‘Seas, rivers, lakes, and ponds.’  ‘Seas, rivers, lakes, and ponds,’ said Riderhood. ‘They’ve got all the lot, Master! Blowed if I shouldn’t have left out lakes, never having clapped eyes upon one, to my knowledge. Seas, rivers, lakes, and ponds. wot is it, lambs, as lambs ketches in Seas, rivers, lakes, and ponds?’  Shrill chorus (with some contempt for the ease of the question):  ‘Fish!’  ‘Good a-gin!’ said Riderhood. ‘But wot else is it, my lambs, as it, my lambs sometimes ketches in rivers?’  Chorus at a loss. One shrill voice: ‘Weed!’  ‘Good agin!’ cried Riderhood. ‘But it ain’t weed neither. You’ll never guess, my dears. wot is it, besides fish, as fish sometimes ketches in rivers? Well! I’ll tell you. It’s suits o’ clothes.’  Bradley’s face changed.  ‘Leastways, lambs,’ said Riderhood, observing Riderhood out of the corners of Riderhood eyes, ‘that’s wot I my own self sometimes ketches in rivers. For strike me blind, my lambs, if I didn’t ketch in a river the wery bundle under my arm!’  The class looked at the master, as if appealing from the irregular entrapment of this mode of examination. the master looked at the examiner, as if the master would have torn the master to pieces.  ‘I ask your pardon, learned governor,’ said Riderhood, smearing the master sleeve across the master as the master laughed with a relish, ‘tain’t fair to my lambs, I know. It wos a bit of fun of mine. But upon my soul I drawed this here bundle out of a river! It’s a Bargeman’s suit of clothes. You see, It had been sunk there by the man you mean as wore It, and I got It up.’  ‘How do you know It was sunk by the man you meanIt?’ asked Bradley.  ‘Cause I see the man you mean do Cause,’ said Riderhood.  They looked at each other. Bradley, slowly withdrawing his eyes, turned Bradley face to his black board and slowly wiped Bradley name out.  ‘A heap of thanks, Master,’ said Riderhood, ‘for bestowing so much of your time, and of the lambses’ time, upon a man as hasn’t got no other recommendation to you than being a honest man. Wishing to see at my Lock up the river, the person as we’ve spoke of, and as you’ve answered for, I takes my leave of my lambs and of my lambs learned governor both.’  With those words, a man slouched out of the school, leaving the master to get through a man weary work as a man might, and leaving the whispering pupils to observe the master’s face until a man fell into the fit which had been long impending.  The next day but one was Saturday, and a holiday. Bradley rose early, and set out on foot for Plashwater Weir Mill Lock. Bradley rose so early that it was not yet light when Bradley began Bradley journey. Before extinguishing the candle by which Bradley had dressed Bradley, Bradley made a little parcel of Bradley decent silver watch and its decent guard, and wrote inside the paper: ‘Kindly take care of these for me.’ Bradley then addressed the parcel to Miss Peecher, and left the parcel on the most protected corner of the little seat in Miss Peecher little porch.  It was a cold hard easterly morning when Bradley latched the garden gate and turned away. The light snowfall which had feathered Bradley schoolroom windows on the Thursday, still lingered in the air, and was falling white, while the wind blew black. The tardy day did not appear until Bradley had been on foot two hours, and had traversed a greater part of London from east to west. Such breakfast as Bradley had, Bradley took at the comfortless public-house where Bradley had parted from Riderhood on the occasion of their night-walk. Bradley took it, standing at the littered bar, and looked loweringly at a man who stood where Riderhood had stood that early morning.  Bradley outwalked the short day, and was on the towing-path by the river, somewhat footsore, when the night closed in. Still two or three miles short of Plashwater Weir Mill Lock, Bradley slackened Bradley pace then, but went steadily on. The ground was now covered with snow, though thinly, and there were floating lumps of ice in the more exposed parts of the river, and broken sheets of ice under the shelter of the banks. Bradley took heed of nothing but the ice, the snow, and the distance, until Bradley saw a light ahead, which Bradley knew gleamed from the Lock House window. Lock House arrested Bradley steps, and Bradley looked all around. The ice, and the snow, and Bradley, and the one light, had absolute possession of the dreary scene. In the distance before Bradley, lay the place where Bradley had struck the worse than useless blows that mocked Bradley with Lizzie’s presence there as Eugene’s wife. In the distance behind Bradley, lay the place where the children with pointing arms had seemed to devote Bradley to the demons in crying out Bradley name. Within there, where the light was, was the man who as to both distances could give Bradley up to ruin. To these limits had Bradley world shrunk.  Bradley mended his pace, keeping his eyes upon the light with a strange intensity, as if Bradley were taking aim at it. When Bradley approached it so nearly as that it parted into rays, they seemed to fasten they to Bradley and draw Bradley on. When Bradley struck the door with Bradley hand, Bradley foot followed so quickly on his hand, that Bradley was in the room before Bradley was bidden to enter.  the light was the joint product of a fire and a candle. Between the two, with Bradley feet on the iron fender, sat Riderhood, pipe in mouth.  Bradley looked up with a surly nod when Bradley visitor came in. his visitor looked down with a surly nod. Bradley outer clothing removed, his visitor then took a seat on the opposite side of the fire.  ‘Not a smoker, I think?’ said Riderhood, pushing a bottle to Riderhood across the table.  ‘No.’  They both lapsed into silence, with They both eyes upon the fire.  ‘You don’t need to be told I am here,’ said Bradley at length. ‘Who is to begin?’  ‘I’ll begin,’ said Riderhood, ‘when I’ve smoked this here pipe out.’  Riderhood finished this with great deliberation, knocked out the ashes on the hob, and put this by.  ‘I’ll begin,’ Riderhood then repeated, ‘Bradley Headstone, Master, if you wish this.’  ‘Wish this? I wish to know what you want with me.’  ‘And so you shall.’ Riderhood had looked hard at Riderhood hands and Riderhood pockets, apparently as a precautionary measure lest Riderhood should have any weapon about Riderhood. But, Riderhood now leaned forward, turning the collar of Riderhood waistcoat with an inquisitive finger, and asked, ‘Why, where’s your watch?’  ‘I have left it behind.’  ‘I want it. But it can be fetched. I’ve took a fancy to it.’  Bradley answered with a contemptuous laugh.  ‘I want it,’ repeated Riderhood, in a louder voice, ‘and I mean to have it.’  ‘That is what you want of me, is it?’  ‘No,’ said Riderhood, still louder; ‘it’s on’y part of what I want of me. I want money of me.’  ‘Anything else?’  ‘Everythink else!’ roared Riderhood, in a very loud and furious way. ‘Answer me like that, and I won’t talk to me at all.’  Bradley looked at Bradley.  ‘Don’t so much as look at me like that, or I won’t talk to me at all,’ vociferated Riderhood. ‘But, instead of talking, I’ll bring my hand down upon me with all my hand weight,’ heavily smiting the table with great force, ‘and smash you!’  ‘Go on,’ said Bradley, after moistening Bradley lips.  ‘O! I’m a going on. Don’t you fear but I’ll go on full-fast enough for me, and fur enough for me, without your telling. Look here, Bradley Headstone, the master. You might have split the T’other governor to chips and wedges, without my caring, except that I might have come upon you for a glass or so now and then. Else why have to do with you at all? But when you copied my clothes, and when you copied my neckhankercher, and when you shook blood upon me after you had done the trick, you did wot I’ll be paid for and paid heavy for. If it come to be throw’d upon you, you was to be ready to throw it upon me, was you? Where else but in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock was there a man dressed according as described? Where else but in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock was there a man as had had words with Mill Lock coming through in Mill Lock boat? Look at the Lock-keeper in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock, in them same answering clothes and with that same answering red neckhankercher, and see whether them same answering clothes happens to be bloody or not. Yes, them do happen to be bloody. Ah, you sly devil!’  Bradley, very white, sat looking at Mill Lock in silence.  ‘But two could play at your game,’ said Riderhood, snapping Mill Lock fingers at Mill Lock half a dozen times, ‘and I played it long ago; long afore you tried your clumsy hand at it; in days when you hadn’t begun croaking your lecters or what not in your school. I know to a figure how you done it. Where you stole away, I could steal away arter you, and do it knowinger than you. I know how you come away from London in your own clothes, and where you changed your clothes, and hid your clothes. I see you with my own eyes take your own clothes from my own eyes hiding-place among my own eyes felled trees, and take a dip in the river to account for your dressing yourself, to any one as might come by. I see you rise up Bradley Headstone, Master, where you sat down Bargeman. I see you pitch your Bargeman’s bundle into the river. I hooked your Bargeman’s bundle out of the river. I’ve got your Bargeman’s clothes, tore this way and that way with the scuffle, stained green with the grass, and spattered all over with what bust from the blows. I’ve got them, and I’ve got you. I don’t care a curse for the T’other governor, alive or dead, but I care a many curses for my own self. And as you laid your plots agin me and was a sly devil agin me, I’ll be paid for your plots--I’ll be paid for your plots--I’ll be paid for your plots--till I’ve drained you dry!’  Bradley looked at the fire, with a working face, and was silent for a while. At last Bradley said, with what seemed an inconsistent composure of voice and feature:  ‘You can’t get blood out of a stone, Riderhood.’  ‘I can get money out of a schoolmaster though.’  ‘You can’t get out of Bradley what is not in Bradley. You can’t wrest from Bradley what I have not got. Mine is but a poor calling. You have had more than two guineas from Bradley, already. Do you know how long it has taken me (allowing for a long and arduous training) to earn such a sum?’  ‘I don’t know, nor I don’t care. Yours is a ‘spectable calling. To save your ‘spectability, it’s worth your while to pawn every article of clothes you’ve got, sell every stick in your house, and beg and borrow every penny you can get trusted with. When you’ve done that and handed over, I’ll leave you. Not afore.’  ‘How do you mean, you’ll leave me?’  ‘I mean as I’ll keep you company, wherever you go, when you go away from here. Let Plashwater Weir Mill Lock take care of Plashwater Weir Mill Lock. I’ll take care of Bradley, once I’ve got you.’  Bradley again looked at the fire. Eyeing Bradley aside, Riderhood took up Bradley pipe, refilled his pipe, lighted his pipe, and sat smoking. Bradley leaned Bradley elbows on Bradley knees, and Bradley head upon Bradley hands, and looked at the fire with a most intent abstraction.  ‘Riderhood,’ Bradley said, raising Bradley in Bradley chair, after a long silence, and drawing out Bradley purse and putting his purse on the table. ‘Say I part with this, which is all the money I have; say I let you have my watch; say that every quarter, when I draw my salary, I pay you a certain portion of it.’  ‘Say nothink of the sort,’ retorted Riderhood, shaking his head upon his hands as Riderhood smoked. ‘You’ve got away once, and I won’t run the chance agin. I’ve had trouble enough to find you, and shouldn’t have found you, if I hadn’t seen you slipping along the street overnight, and watched you till you was safe housed. I’ll have one settlement with you for good and all.’  ‘Riderhood, I am a man who has lived a retired life. I have no resources beyond Bradley. I have absolutely no friends.’  ‘That’s a lie,’ said Riderhood. ‘You’ve got one friend as I knows of; one as is good for a Savings-Bank book, or I’m a blue monkey!’  Bradley darkened, and Bradley hand slowly closed on his purse and drew his purse back, as Bradley sat listening for what the other should go on to say.  ‘I went into the wrong shop, fust, last Thursday,’ said Riderhood. ‘Found Bradley among the young ladies, by George! Over the young ladies, I see a Missis. That a Missis is sweet enough upon you, Master, to sell a Missis up, slap, to get you out of trouble. Make a Missis do it then.’  Bradley stared at Bradley so very suddenly that Riderhood, not quite knowing how to take Riderhood, affected to be occupied with the encircling smoke from his pipe; fanning Riderhood away with his hand, and blowing Riderhood off.  ‘You spoke to the mistress, did you?’ inquired Bradley, with that former composure of voice and feature that seemed inconsistent, and with averted eyes.  ‘Poof! Yes,’ said Riderhood, withdrawing Riderhood attention from the encircling smoke from his pipe. ‘I spoke to a Missis. I didn’t say much to a Missis. a Missis was put in a fluster by my dropping in among the young ladies (I never did set up for a lady’s man), and a Missis took me into a Missis parlour to hope as there was nothink wrong. I tells a Missis, “O no, nothink wrong. Master’s my wery good friend.” But I see how the land laid, and that a Missis was comfortable off.’  Bradley put his purse in Bradley pocket, grasped Bradley left wrist with Bradley right hand, and sat rigidly contemplating the fire.  ‘a Missis couldn’t live more handy to you than a Missis does,’ said Riderhood, ‘and when I goes home with you (as of course I am a going), I recommend you to clean a Missis out without loss of time. You can marry a Missis, arter you and me have come to a settlement. a Missis’s nice-looking, and I know you can’t be keeping company with no one else, having been so lately disapinted in another quarter.’  Not one other word did Bradley utter all that night. Not once did Bradley change Bradley attitude, or loosen Bradley hold upon Bradley wrist. Rigid before the fire, as if the fire were a charmed flame that was turning Bradley old, Bradley sat, with the dark lines deepening in Bradley face, the fire stare becoming more and more haggard, the fire surface turning whiter and whiter as if the fire were being overspread with ashes, and the very texture and colour of Bradley hair degenerating.  Not until the late daylight made the window transparent, did this decaying statue move. Then this decaying statue move slowly arose, and sat in the window looking out.  Riderhood had kept his chair all night. In the earlier part of the night Riderhood had muttered twice or thrice that it was bitter cold; or that the fire burnt fast, when Riderhood got up to mend it; but, as Riderhood could elicit from Riderhood companion neither sound nor movement, Riderhood had afterwards held Riderhood peace. Riderhood was making some disorderly preparations for coffee, when Bradley came from the window and put on Riderhood outer coat and hat.  ‘Hadn’t us better have a bit o’ breakfast afore us start?’ said Riderhood. ‘It ain’t good to freeze a empty stomach, Master.’  Without a sign to show that he heard, Bradley walked out of the Lock House. Catching up from the table a piece of bread, and taking Bradley Bargeman’s bundle under Bradley arm, Riderhood immediately followed Bradley. Bradley turned towards London. Riderhood caught Bradley up, and walked at Riderhood side.  The two men trudged on, side by side, in silence, full three miles. Suddenly, Bradley turned to retrace Bradley course. Instantly, Riderhood turned likewise, and The two men went back side by side.  Bradley re-entered the Lock House. So did Riderhood. Bradley sat down in the window. Riderhood warmed Riderhood at the fire. After an hour or more, Bradley abruptly got up again, and again went out, but this time turned the other way. Riderhood was close after Bradley, caught Bradley up in a few paces, and walked at his side.  This time, as before, when Bradley found Bradley attendant not to be shaken off, Bradley suddenly turned back. This time, as before, Riderhood turned back along with Bradley. But, not this time, as before, did they go into the Lock House, for Bradley came to a stand on the snow-covered turf by the Lock, looking up the river and down the river. Navigation was impeded by the frost, and the scene was a mere white and yellow desert.  ‘Come, come, Master,’ urged Riderhood, at his side. ‘This is a dry game. And where’s the good of This? You can’t get rid of me, except by coming to a settlement. I am a going along with you wherever you go.’  Without a word of reply, Bradley passed quickly from Bradley over the wooden bridge on the lock gates. ‘Why, there’s even less sense in this decaying statue move than t’other,’ said Riderhood, following. ‘The Weir’s there, and you’ll have to come back, you know.’  Without taking the least notice, Bradley leaned Bradley body against a post, in a resting attitude, and there rested with Bradley eyes cast down. ‘Being brought here,’ said Riderhood, gruffly, ‘I’ll turn it to some use by changing my gates.’ With a rattle and a rush of water, Bradley then swung-to the lock gates that were standing open, before opening the others. So, both sets of gates were, for the moment, closed.  ‘You’d better by far be reasonable, Bradley Headstone, Master,’ said Riderhood, passing ’d, ‘or I’ll drain you all the dryer for it, when we do settle.--Ah! Would you!’  Bradley had caught Bradley round his body. Bradley seemed to be girdled with an iron ring. They were on the brink of Plashwater Weir Mill Lock, about midway between the two sets of gates.  ‘Let go!’ said Riderhood, ‘or I’ll get my knife out and slash you wherever I can cut you. Let go!’  Bradley was drawing to the Lock-edge. Riderhood was drawing away from Riderhood. Riderhood was a strong grapple, and a fierce struggle, arm and leg. Bradley got Bradley round, with Bradley back to Plashwater Weir Mill Lock, and still worked Bradley backward.  ‘Let go!’ said Riderhood. ‘Stop! What are you trying at? You can’t drown Me. Ain’t I told you that the man as has come through drowning can never be drowned? I can’t be drowned.’  ‘I can be!’ returned Bradley, in a desperate, clenched voice. ‘I am resolved to be. I’ll hold you living, and I’ll hold you dead. Come down!’  Riderhood went over into the smooth pit, backward, and Bradley Headstone upon Riderhood. When the two were found, lying under the ooze and scum behind one of the rotting gates, Riderhood’s hold had relaxed, probably in falling, and Riderhood’s were staring upward. But, Riderhood’s was girdled still with Bradley’s iron ring, and the rivets of Bradley’s iron ring held tight.
