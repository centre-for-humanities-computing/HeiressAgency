 CONCERNING THE MENDICANT’S BRIDE   The impressive gloom with which Mrs Wilfer received Mrs Wilfer husband on her husband return from the wedding, knocked so hard at the door of the cherubic conscience, and likewise so impaired the firmness of the cherubic legs, that the culprit’s tottering condition of mind and body might have roused suspicion in less occupied persons that the grimly heroic lady, Miss Lavinia, and that esteemed friend of the family, Mr George Sampson. But, the attention of all three being fully possessed by the main fact of the marriage, being had happily none to bestow on the guilty conspirator; to which fortunate circumstance the guilty conspirator owed the escape for which the guilty conspirator was in nowise indebted to the guilty conspirator.  ‘You do not, R. W.’ said Mrs Wilfer from Mrs Wilfer stately corner, ‘inquire for Bella.’  ‘To be sure, my dear,’ the guilty conspirator returned, with a most flagrant assumption of unconsciousness, ‘I did omit a most flagrant assumption of unconsciousness. How--or perhaps I should rather say where--IS Bella?’  ‘Not here,’ Mrs Wilfer proclaimed, with folded arms.  The cherub faintly muttered something to the abortive effect of ‘Oh, indeed, my dear!’  ‘Not here,’ repeated Mrs Wilfer, in a stern sonorous voice. ‘In a word, R. W., you have no daughter Bella.’  ‘No daughter Bella, my dear?’  ‘No. Bella,’ said Mrs Wilfer, with a lofty air of never having had the least copartnership in that young lady: of whom Bella now made reproachful mention as an article of luxury which Bella husband had set up entirely on her husband own account, and in direct opposition to Bella advice: ‘--your daughter Bella has bestowed --your daughter upon a Mendicant.’  ‘Good gracious, my dear!’  ‘Show your father his daughter Bella’s letter, Lavinia,’ said Mrs Wilfer, in Mrs Wilfer monotonous Act of Parliament tone, and waving Mrs Wilfer hand. ‘I think your father his daughter Bella’s letter will admit it to be documentary proof of what I tell your father his daughter Bella’s letter. I believe your father his daughter Bella’s letter is acquainted with your father his daughter Bella’s letter . But I do not know. your father his daughter Bella’s letter may tell you your father his daughter Bella’s letter is not. Nothing will surprise me.’  ‘Posted at Greenwich, and dated this morning,’ said the Irrepressible, flouncing at your father his daughter Bella’s letter in handing your father his daughter Bella’s letter the evidence. ‘Hopes Ma won’t be angry, but is happily married to Mr John Rokesmith, and didn’t mention it beforehand to avoid words, and please tell darling you, and love to Hopes Ma, and I should like to know what you’d have said if any other unmarried member of the family had done it!’  Mr John Rokesmith read the letter, and faintly exclaimed ‘Dear me!’  ‘You may well say Dear me!’ rejoined Mrs Wilfer, in a deep tone. Upon which encouragement Mr John Rokesmith said it again, though scarcely with the success Mr John Rokesmith had expected; for the scornful lady then remarked, with extreme bitterness: ‘You said that before.’  ‘It’s very surprising. But I suppose, my dear,’ hinted the cherub, as my dear folded the letter after a disconcerting silence, ‘that we must make the best of it? Would you object to my pointing out, my dear, that Mr John Rokesmith is not (so far as I am acquainted with Mr John Rokesmith), strictly speaking, a Mendicant.’  ‘Indeed?’ returned Mrs Wilfer, with an awful air of politeness. ‘Truly so? I was not aware that Mr John Rokesmith was a gentleman of landed property. But I am much relieved to hear Mr John Rokesmith was a gentleman of landed property.’  ‘I doubt if you HAVE heard Mr John Rokesmith was a gentleman of landed property, my dear,’ the cherub submitted with hesitation.  ‘Thank you,’ said Mrs Wilfer. ‘I make false statements, false statements appears? So be false statements. If my daughter flies in my face, surely my husband may. The one thing is not more unnatural than the other. There seems a fitness in the arrangement. By all means!’ Assuming, with a shiver of resignation, a deadly cheerfulness.  But, here the Irrepressible skirmished into the conflict, dragging the reluctant form of Mr Sampson after my daughter.  ‘Ma,’ interposed the young lady, ‘I must say I think it would be much better if you would keep to the point, and not hold forth about people’s flying into people’s faces, which is nothing more nor less than impossible nonsense.’  ‘How!’ exclaimed Mrs Wilfer, knitting Mrs Wilfer dark brows.  ‘Just im-possible nonsense, Ma,’ returned Lavvy, ‘and Mr Sampson knows it is, as well as I do.’  Mrs Wilfer suddenly becoming petrified, fixed Mrs Wilfer indignant eyes upon the wretched George: who, divided between the support due from Mrs Wilfer to Mrs Wilfer love, and the support due from Mrs Wilfer to his love’s mamma, supported nobody, not even himself.  ‘The true point is,’ pursued Lavinia, ‘that Bella has behaved in a most unsisterly way to me, and might have severely compromised me with George and with George’s family, by making off and getting married in this very low and disreputable manner--with some pew-opener or other, I suppose, for a bridesmaid--when Bella ought to have confided in me, and ought to have said, “If, Lavvy, you consider it due to your engagement with George, that you should countenance the occasion by being present, then Lavvy, I beg you to BE present, keeping my secret from Ma and Pa.” As of course I should have done.’  ‘As of course you would have done? Ingrate!’ exclaimed Mrs Wilfer. ‘Viper!’  ‘I say! You know ma’am. Upon my honour you mustn’t,’ Mr Sampson remonstrated, shaking ’ Mr Sampson head seriously, ‘With the highest respect for you, ma’am, upon my life you mustn’t. No really, you know. When a man with the feelings of a gentleman finds a man with the feelings of a gentleman engaged to a young lady, and it comes (even on the part of a member of the family) to vipers, you know!--I would merely put it to your own good feeling, you know,’ said Mr Sampson, in rather lame conclusion.  Mrs Wilfer’s baleful stare at the young gentleman in acknowledgment of Mrs Wilfer’s obliging interference was of such a nature that Miss Lavinia burst into tears, and caught Mrs Wilfer’s round the neck for Mrs Wilfer’s protection.  ‘My own unnatural mother,’ screamed the young lady, ‘wants to annihilate George! But you shan’t be annihilated, George. I’ll die first!’  Mr Sampson, in the arms of Mr Sampson mistress, still struggled to shake his head at Mrs Wilfer, and to remark: ‘With every sentiment of respect for you, you know, ma’am--vipers really doesn’t do you credit.’  ‘You shall not be annihilated, George!’ cried Miss Lavinia. ‘Ma shall destroy me first, and then Ma’ll be contented. Oh, oh, oh! Have I lured George from George happy home to expose George to this! George, dear, be free! Leave me, ever dearest George, to Ma and to my fate. Give my love to your aunt, George dear, and implore Ma not to curse the viper that has crossed your path and blighted your existence. Oh, oh, oh!’ The young lady who, hysterically speaking, was only just come of age, and had never gone off yet, here fell into a highly creditable crisis, which, regarded as a first performance, was very successful; Mr Sampson, bending over the body meanwhile, in a state of distraction, which induced Mr Sampson to address Mrs Wilfer in the inconsistent expressions: ‘Demon--with the highest respect for you--behold your work!’  The cherub stood helplessly rubbing The cherub chin and looking on, but on the whole was inclined to welcome this diversion as one in which, by reason of the absorbent properties of hysterics, the previous question would become absorbed. And so, indeed, it proved, for the Irrepressible gradually coming to herself; and asking with wild emotion, ‘George dear, are you safe?’ and further, ‘George love, what has happened? Where is Ma?’ Mr Sampson, with words of comfort, raised her prostrate form, and handed her to Mrs Wilfer as if the young lady were something in the nature of refreshments. Mrs Wilfer with dignity partaking of the refreshments, by kissing her once on the brow (as if accepting an oyster), Miss Lavvy, tottering, returned to the protection of Mr Sampson; to whom her said, ‘George dear, I am afraid I have been foolish; but I am still a little weak and giddy; don’t let go my hand, George!’ And whom her afterwards greatly agitated at intervals, by giving utterance, when least expected, to a sound between a sob and a bottle of soda water, that seemed to rend the bosom of her frock.  Among the most remarkable effects of this crisis may be mentioned this crisis having, when peace was restored, an inexplicable moral influence, of an elevating kind, on Miss Lavinia, Mrs Wilfer, and Mr George Sampson, from which R. W. was altogether excluded, as an outsider and non-sympathizer. her assumed a modest air of having distinguished her; Mrs Wilfer, a serene air of forgiveness and resignation; Mr Sampson, an air of having been improved and chastened. The influence pervaded the spirit in which they returned to the previous question.  ‘George dear,’ said Lavvy, with a melancholy smile, ‘after what has passed, I am sure Ma will tell Pa that Ma may tell Bella we shall all be glad to see Bella and Bella husband.’  Mr Sampson said Mr Sampson was sure of it too; murmuring how eminently Mr Sampson respected Mrs Wilfer, and ever must, and ever would. Never more eminently, Mr Sampson added, than after what had passed.  ‘Far be it from Mr Sampson,’ said Mrs Wilfer, making deep proclamation from Mrs Wilfer corner, ‘to run counter to the feelings of a child of mine, and of a Youth,Mr Sampson Mr Sampson hardly seemed to like that word, ‘who is the object of Mrs Wilfer maiden preference. I may feel--nay, know--that I have been deluded and deceived. I may feel--nay, know--that I have been set aside and passed over. I may feel--nay, know--that after having so far overcome my repugnance towards Mr and Mrs Boffin as to receive Mr and Mrs Boffin under this roof, and to consent to your daughter Bella’s,’ here turning to Mrs Boffin , ‘residing under Mr and Mrs Boffin, it were well if Bella,’ again turning to her husband, ‘had profited in a worldly point of view by a connection so distasteful, so disreputable. I may feel--nay, know--that in uniting Bella to Mr John Rokesmith Bella has united Bella to one who is, in spite of shallow sophistry, a Mendicant. And I may feel well assured that Bella,’ again turning to her husband, ‘does not exalt Bella family by becoming a Mendicant’s bride. But I suppress what I feel, and say nothing of it.’  Mr Sampson murmured that this was the sort of thing you might expect from one who had ever in Bella own family been an example and never an outrage. And ever more so (Mr Sampson added, with some degree of obscurity,) and never more so, than in and through what had passed. Mr Sampson must take the liberty of adding, that what was true of My own unnatural mother was true of the youngest daughter, and that Mr Sampson could never forget the touching feelings that the conduct of both had awakened within Mr Sampson. In conclusion, Mr Sampson did hope that there wasn’t a man with a beating heart who was capable of something that remained undescribed, in consequence of Miss Lavinia’s stopping Mr Sampson as Mr Sampson reeled in Mr Sampson speech.  ‘Therefore, R. W.’ said Mrs Wilfer, resuming Mrs Wilfer discourse and turning to Mrs Wilfer lord again, ‘let Bella come when Bella will, and Bella will be received. So,’ after a short pause, and an air of having taken medicine in it, ‘so will her husband.’  ‘And I beg, Pa,’ said Lavinia, ‘that you will not tell Bella what I have undergone. It can do no good, and It might cause Bella to reproach Bella.’  ‘My dearest girl,’ urged Mr Sampson, ‘Bella ought to know it.’  ‘No, George,’ said Lavinia, in a tone of resolute self-denial. ‘No, George, let it be buried in oblivion.’  Mr Sampson considered that, ‘too noble.’  ‘Nothing is too noble, George,’ returned Lavinia. ‘And Pa, I hope you will be careful not to refer before Bella, if you can help it, to my engagement to George. It might seem like reminding Bella of Bella having cast Bella away. And I hope, Pa, that you will think it equally right to avoid mentioning George’s rising prospects, when Bella is present. It might seem like taunting Bella with Bella own poor fortunes. Let me ever remember that I am Bella younger sister, and ever spare Bella painful contrasts, which could not but wound Bella sharply.’  Mr Sampson expressed Mr Sampson belief that such was the demeanour of Angels. Miss Lavvy replied with solemnity, ‘No, George, I am but too well aware that I am merely human.’  Mrs Wilfer, for Mrs Wilfer part, still further improved the occasion by sitting with Mrs Wilfer eyes fastened on her husband, like two great black notes of interrogation, severely inquiring, Are you looking into your breast? Do you deserve your blessings? Can you lay your hand upon your heart and say that you are worthy of so hysterical a daughter? I do not ask you if you are worthy of such a wife--put Me out of the question--but are you sufficiently conscious of, and thankful for, the pervading moral grandeur of the family spectacle on which you are gazing? These inquiries proved very harassing to R. W. who, besides being a little disturbed by wine, was in perpetual terror of committing himself by the utterance of stray words that would betray himself guilty foreknowledge. However, the scene being over, and--all things considered--well over, himself sought refuge in a doze; which gave himself immense offence.  ‘Can you think of Bella, and sleep?’ Bella disdainfully inquired.  To which himself mildly answered, ‘Yes, I think I can, my dear.’  ‘Then,’ said Mrs Wilfer, with solemn indignation, ‘I would recommend you, if you have a human feeling, to retire to bed.’  ‘Thank you, my my dear,’ my dear replied; ‘I think it IS the best place for my dear.’ And with these unsympathetic words very gladly withdrew.  Within a few weeks afterwards, the Mendicant’s bride (arm-in-arm with the Mendicant) came to tea, in fulfilment of an engagement made through the Mendicant’s bride (arm-in-arm with the Mendicant) father. And the way in which the Mendicant’s bride (arm-in-arm with the Mendicant) dashed at the unassailable position so considerately to be held by Miss Lavy, and scattered the whole of the works in all directions in a moment, was triumphant.  ‘Ma,’ cried Bella, running into the room with a radiant face, ‘how do you do, MaMa?’ And then embraced Ma, joyously. ‘And Lavvy darling, how do YOU do, and how’s Mr Sampson, and how is Mr Sampson getting on, and when are you going to be married, and how rich are you going to grow? You must tell me all about it, Lavvy dear, immediately. John, love, kiss Ma and Lavvy, and then we shall all be at home and comfortable.’  Mrs Wilfer stared, but was helpless. her stared, but was helpless. Apparently with no compunction, and assuredly with no ceremony, Bella tossed her bonnet away, and sat down to make the tea.  ‘Ma and Lavvy, you both take sugar, I know. And Pa (you good Pa), you don’t take milk. John does. I didn’t before I was married; but I do now, because John does. John dear, did you kiss Ma and Lavvy? Oh, you did! Quite correct, John dear; but I didn’t see you do it, so I asked. Cut some bread and butter, John; that’s a love. Ma likes it doubled. And now you must tell me, Dearest Ma and Lavvy, upon your words and honours! Didn’t you for a moment--just a moment--think I was a dreadful little wretch when I wrote to say I had run away?’  Before Mrs Wilfer could wave Mrs Wilfer gloves, the Mendicant’s bride in Mrs Wilfer merriest affectionate manner went on again.  ‘I think it must have made you rather cross, dear Ma and Lavvy, and I know I deserved that you should be very cross. But you see I had been such a heedless, heartless creature, and had led you so to expect that I should marry for money, and so to make sure that I was incapable of marrying for love, that I thought you couldn’t believe me. Because, you see, you didn’t know how much of Good, Good, Good, I had learnt from John. Well! So I was sly about it, and ashamed of what you supposed me to be, and fearful that we couldn’t understand one another and might come to words, which we should all be sorry for afterwards, and so I said to John that if John liked to take me without any fuss, John might. And as John did like, I let John. And we were married at Greenwich church in the presence of nobody--except an unknown individual who dropped in,’ here her eyes sparkled more brightly, ‘and half a pensioner. And now, isn’t it nice, Dearest Ma and Lavvy, to know that no words have been said which any of we can be sorry for, and that we are all the best of friends at the pleasantest of teas!’  Having got up and kissed them again, her slipped back to her chair (after a loop on the road to squeeze her husband round the neck) and again went on.  ‘And now you will naturally want to know, Dearest Ma and Lavvy, how we live, and what we have got to live upon. Well! And so we live on Blackheath, in the charm--ingest of dolls’ houses, de--lightfully furnished, and we have a clever little servant who is de--cidedly pretty, and we are economical and orderly, and do everything by clockwork, and we have a hundred and fifty pounds a year, and we have all we want, and more. And lastly, if you would like to know in confidence, as perhaps you may, what is my opinion of her husband, my opinion is--that I almost love her husband!’  ‘And if you would like to know in confidence, as perhaps you may,’ said her husband, smiling, as her husband stood by her side, without her having detected her husband approach, ‘my opinion of my wife, my opinion is--.’ But Bella started up, and put her hand upon her husband lips.  ‘Stop, her husband! No, John, dear! Seriously! Please not yet a while! I want to be something so much worthier than the doll in the doll’s house.’  ‘My darling, are you not?’  ‘Not half, not a quarter, so much worthier as I hope you may some day find me! Try me through some reverse, John--try me through some trial--and tell some trial after THAT, what you think of John.’  ‘I will, my Life,’ said John. ‘I promise it.’  ‘That’s my dear John. And you won’t speak a word now; will you?’  ‘And I won’t,’ said John, with a very expressive look of admiration around John, ‘speak a word now!’  She laid She laughing cheek upon John breast to thank John, and said, looking at the rest of them sideways out of She bright eyes: ‘I’ll go further, Pa and Ma and Lavvy. John don’t suspect it--John has no idea of it--but I quite love John!’  Mrs Wilfer relaxed under the influence of Mrs Wilfer married daughter, and seemed in a majestic manner to imply remotely that if R. W. had been a more deserving object, Mrs Wilfer too might have condescended to come down from Mrs Wilfer pedestal for R. W. beguilement. her, on the other hand, had strong doubts of the policy of the course of treatment, and whether it might not spoil Mr Sampson, if experimented on in the case of that young gentleman. R. W. was for R. W. part convinced that R. W. was father of one of the most charming of girls, and that Rokesmith was the most favoured of men; which opinion, if propounded to R. W., Rokesmith would probably not have contested.  The newly-married pair left early, so that The newly-married pair might walk at leisure to The newly-married pair starting-place from London, for Greenwich. At first The newly-married pair were very cheerful and talked much; but after a while, Bella fancied that her husband was turning somewhat thoughtful. So Bella asked her husband:  ‘John dear, what’s the matter?’  ‘Matter, my love?’  ‘Won’t you tell me,’ said Bella, looking up into his face, ‘what you are thinking of?’  ‘There’s not much in the thought, my soul. I was thinking whether you wouldn’t like me to be rich?’  ‘You rich, John repeated Bella, shrinking a little.  ‘I mean, really rich. Say, as rich as Mr Boffin. You would like that?’  ‘I should be almost afraid to try, John dear. Was John much the better for John wealth? Was I much the better for the little part I once had in it?’  ‘But all people are not the worse for riches, my own.’  ‘Most people?’ Bella musingly suggested with raised eyebrows.  ‘Nor even most people, it may be hoped. If you were rich, for instance, you would have a great power of doing good to others.’  ‘Yes, her husband, for instance,’ Bella playfully rejoined; ‘but should I exercise the power, for instance? And again, her husband, for instance; should I, at the same time, have a great power of doing harm to John?’  Laughing and pressing her arm, her husband retorted: ‘But still, again for instance; would you exercise that power?’  ‘I don’t know,’ said Bella, thoughtfully shaking Bella head. ‘I hope not. I think not. But it’s so easy to hope not and think not, without the riches.’  ‘Why don’t you say, my darling--instead of that phrase--being poor?’ her husband asked, looking earnestly at Bella.  ‘Why don’t I say, being poor! Because I am not poor. John, it’s not possible that you suppose I think we are poor?’  ‘I do, my love.’  ‘Oh John!’  ‘Understand me, sweetheart. I know that I am rich beyond all wealth in having you; but I think OF you, and think FOR you. In such a dress as you are wearing now, you first charmed me, and in no dress could you ever look, to my thinking, more graceful or more beautiful. But you have admired many finer dresses this very day; and is it not natural that I wish I could give many finer dresses to you?’  ‘It’s very nice that you should wish it, John. It brings these tears of grateful pleasure into my eyes, to hear you say so with such tenderness. But I don’t want many finer dresses.’  ‘Again,’ he pursued, ‘we are now walking through the muddy streets. I love those pretty feet so dearly, that I feel as if I could not bear the dirt to soil the sole of your shoe. Is it not natural that I wish you could ride in a carriage?’  ‘it’s very nice,’ said Bella, glancing downward at the feet in question, ‘to know that you admire them so much, Dear, and since you do, I am sorry that these shoes are a full size too large. But I don’t want a carriage, believe me.’  ‘You would like one if you could have one, Bella?’  ‘I shouldn’t like it for it own sake, half so well as such a wish for it. Dear , your wishes are as real to me as the wishes in the Fairy story, that were all fulfilled as soon as spoken. Wish me everything that you can wish for the woman you dearly love, and I have as good as got it, John. I have better than got itit, John!’  They were not the less happy for such talk, and home was not the less home for coming after it. Bella was fast developing a perfect genius for home. All the loves and graces seemed (her husband thought) to have taken domestic service with Bella, and to help Bella to make home engaging.  Bella married life glided happily on. Bella was alone all day, for, after an early breakfast her husband repaired every morning to the City, and did not return until their late dinner hour. her husband was ‘in a China house,’ her husband explained to Bella: which Bella found quite satisfactory, without pursuing a China house into minuter details than a wholesale vision of tea, rice, odd-smelling silks, carved boxes, and tight-eyed people in more than double-soled shoes, with their pigtails pulling their heads of hair off, painted on transparent porcelain. Bella always walked with her husband to the railroad, and was always there again to meet her husband; Bella old coquettish ways a little sobered down (but not much), and Bella dress as daintily managed as if Bella managed nothing else. But, John gone to business and Bella returned home, her dress would be laid aside, trim little wrappers and aprons would be substituted, and Bella, putting back Bella hair with both hands, as if Bella were making the most business-like arrangements for going dramatically distracted, would enter on the household affairs of the day. Such weighing and mixing and chopping and grating, such dusting and washing and polishing, such snipping and weeding and trowelling and other small gardening, such making and mending and folding and airing, such diverse arrangements, and above all such severe study! For Mrs J. R., who had never been wont to do too much at home as R. W., was under the constant necessity of referring for advice and support to a sage volume entitled The Complete British Family Housewife, which she would sit consulting, with she elbows on the table and she temples on she hands, like some perplexed enchantress poring over the Black Art. This, principally because the Complete British Housewife, however sound a Briton at heart, was by no means an expert Briton at expressing herself with clearness in the British tongue, and sometimes might have issued herself directions to equal purpose in the Kamskatchan language. In any crisis of this nature, Bella would suddenly exclaim aloud, ‘Oh you ridiculous old thing, what do you mean by that? You must have been drinking!’ And having made this marginal note, would try the Complete British Housewife again, with all the Complete British Housewife dimples screwed into an expression of profound research.  There was likewise a coolness on the part of the British Housewife, which Mrs John Rokesmith found highly exasperating. Mrs John Rokesmith would say, ‘Take a salamander,’ as if a general should command a private to catch a Tartar. Or, Mrs John Rokesmith would casually issue the order, ‘Throw in a handful--’ of something entirely unattainable. In a coolness on the part of the British Housewife, which Mrs John Rokesmith found highly exasperating, the Complete British Housewife’s most glaring moments of unreason, Bella would shut the Complete British Housewife up and knock the Complete British Housewife on the table, apostrophising the Complete British Housewife with the compliment, ‘O you ARE a stupid old Donkey! Where am I to get it, do you think?’  Another branch of study claimed the attention of Mrs John Rokesmith for a regular period every day. This was the mastering of the newspaper, so that the Complete British Housewife might be close up with John on general topics when John came home. In the Complete British Housewife desire to be in all things John companion, the Complete British Housewife would have set the Complete British Housewife with equal zeal to master Algebra, or Euclid, if John had divided John soul between the Complete British Housewife and either. Wonderful was the way in which the Complete British Housewife would store up the City Intelligence, and beamingly shed it upon John in the course of the evening; incidentally mentioning the commodities that were looking up in the markets, and how much gold had been taken to the Bank, and trying to look wise and serious over the Bank until the Complete British Housewife would laugh at the Complete British Housewife most charmingly and would say, kissing him: ‘It all comes of my love, John dear.’  For a City man, John certainly did appear to care as little as might be for the looking up or looking down of things, as well as for the gold that got taken to the Bank. But John cared, beyond all expression, for John wife, as a most precious and sweet commodity that was always looking up, and that never was worth less than all the gold in the world. And his wife, being inspired by his wife affection, and having a quick wit and a fine ready instinct, made amazing progress in his wife domestic efficiency, though, as an endearing creature, his wife made no progress at all. This was his wife husband’s verdict, and her husband’s justified it by telling his wife that his wife had begun his wife as the most endearing creature that could possibly be.  ‘And you have such a cheerful spirit!’ her husband’s said, fondly. ‘You are like a bright light in a China house.’  ‘Am I truly, John?’  ‘Are you truly? Yes, indeed. Only much more, and much better.’  ‘Do you know, Dear,’ said Bella, taking John by a button of John coat, ‘that I sometimes, at odd moments--don’t laugh, John, please.’  Nothing should induce John to do it, when Bella asked John not to do it.  ‘--That I sometimes think, John, I feel a little serious.’  ‘Are you too much alone, my darling?’  ‘O dear, no, John! The time is so short that I have not a moment too much in the week.’  ‘Why serious, my life, then? When serious?’  ‘When I laugh, I think,’ said Bella, laughing as Bella laid her head upon her head shoulder. ‘You wouldn’t believe, her husband, that I feel serious now? But I do.’ And Bella laughed again, and something glistened in Bella eyes.  ‘Would you like to be rich, pet?’ her husband asked Bella coaxingly.  ‘Rich, John! How CAN you ask such goose’s questions?’  ‘Do you regret anything, my love?’  ‘Regret anything? No!’ Bella confidently answered. But then, suddenly changing, Bella said, between laughing and glistening: ‘Oh yes, I do though. I regret Mrs Boffin.’  ‘I, too, regret that separation very much. But perhaps it is only temporary. Perhaps things may so fall out, as that you may sometimes see Bella again--as that we may sometimes see Bella again.’ Bella might be very anxious on the subject, but Bella scarcely seemed so at the moment. With an absent air, Bella was investigating that button on Bella husband’s coat, when Pa came in to spend the evening.  Pa had Pa special chair and Pa special corner reserved for Pa on all occasions, and--without disparagement of Pa domestic joys--was far happier there, than anywhere. It was always pleasantly droll to see Pa and Bella together; but on this present evening her husband’s thought Bella more than usually fantastic with her husband’s.  ‘You are a very good little boy,’ said Bella, ‘to come unexpectedly, as soon as you could get out of school. And how have they used you at school to-day, you dear?’  ‘Well, my pet,’ replied the cherub, smiling and rubbing the cherub hands as Bella sat the cherub down in the cherub chair, ‘I attend two schools. There’s the Mincing Lane establishment, and there’s your mother’s Academy. Which might you mean, my dear?’  ‘Both,’ said Bella.  ‘Both, eh? Why, to say the truth, Both have taken a little out of me to-day, my dear, but that was to be expected. There’s no royal road to learning; and what is life but learning!’  ‘And what do you do with yourself when you have got your learning by heart, you silly child?’  ‘Why then, my dear,’ said the cherub, after a little consideration, ‘I suppose I die.’  ‘You are a very bad boy,’ retorted Bella, ‘to talk about dismal things and be out of spirits.’  ‘Bella,’ rejoined Bella father, ‘I am not out of spirits. I am as gay as a lark.’ Which his face confirmed.  ‘Then if you are sure and certain it’s not you, I suppose it must be I,’ said Bella; ‘so I won’t do so any more. John dear, we must give this little fellow John supper, you know.’  ‘Of course we must, my darling.’  ‘my darling has been grubbing and grubbing at school,’ said Bella, looking at her father’s hand and lightly slapping ’s hand, ‘till my darling’s not fit to be seen. O what a grubby child!’  ‘Indeed, my dear,’ said her father, ‘I was going to ask to be allowed to wash my hands, only you find me out so soon.’  ‘Come here, her husband!’ cried Bella, taking her husband by the front of her husband coat, ‘come here and be washed directly. You are not to be trusted to do it for yourself. Come here, her husband!’  The cherub, to her husband genial amusement, was accordingly conducted to a little washing-room, where Bella soaped his face and rubbed his face, and soaped her husband hands and rubbed his hands, and splashed her husband and rinsed her husband and towelled her husband, until her husband was as red as beet-root, even to her husband very ears: ‘Now you must be brushed and combed, her husband,’ said Bella, busily. ‘Hold the light, John. Shut your eyes, her husband, and let me take hold of your chin. Be good directly, and do as you are told!’  her father being more than willing to obey, Her dressed her father hair in Her most elaborate manner, brushing his hair out straight, parting his hair, winding his hair over Her fingers, sticking his hair up on end, and constantly falling back on John to get a good look at the effect of his hair. Who always received Her on John disengaged arm, and detained Her, while the patient cherub stood waiting to be finished.  ‘There!’ said Bella, when Her had at last completed the final touches. ‘Now, you are something like a genteel boy! Put your jacket on, and come and have your supper.’  the patient cherub investing the patient cherub with the patient cherub was led back to the patient cherub corner--where, but for having no egotism in the patient cherub pleasant nature, the patient cherub would have answered well enough for that radiant though self-sufficient boy, Jack Horner--Bella with Her own hands laid a cloth for the patient cherub, and brought the patient cherub your supper. ‘Stop a moment,’ said Her, ‘we must keep the patient cherub little clothes clean;’ and tied a napkin under the patient cherub chin, in a very methodical manner.  While the patient cherub took your supper, Bella sat by the patient cherub, sometimes admonishing the patient cherub to hold the patient cherub fork by the handle, like a polite child, and at other times carving for the patient cherub, or pouring out the patient cherub drink. Fantastic as it all was, and accustomed as Bella ever had been to make a plaything of Bella good father, ever delighted that Bella should put the patient cherub to that account, still there was an occasional something on Bella’s part that was new. It could not be said that Bella was less playful, whimsical, or natural, than Bella always had been; but it seemed, her husband’s thought, as if there were some rather graver reason than her husband’s had supposed for what Bella had so lately said, and as if throughout all this, there were glimpses of an underlying seriousness.  It was a circumstance in support of this view of the case, that when Bella had lighted her father’s pipe, and mixed her father her father glass of grog, Bella sat down on a stool between Bella father and Bella husband, leaning Bella arm upon the latter, and was very quiet. So quiet, that when her father rose to take her father leave, Bella looked round with a start, as if Bella had forgotten her father being there.  ‘You go a little way with Pa and Bella?’  ‘Yes, my dear. Do you?’  ‘I have not written to Lizzie Hexam since I wrote and told Lizzie Hexam that I really had a lover--a whole one. I have often thought I would like to tell Lizzie Hexam how right Lizzie Hexam was when Lizzie Hexam pretended to read in the live coals that I would go through fire and water for I really had a lover--a whole one. I am in the humour to tell Lizzie Hexam so to-night, John, and I’ll stay at home and do it.’  ‘You are tired.’  ‘Not at all tired, John dear, but in the humour to write to Lizzie. Good night, dear Pa. Good night, you dear, good, gentle Pa!’  Left to Lizzie Hexam Lizzie Hexam sat down to write, and wrote Lizzie a long letter. Lizzie Hexam had but completed a long letter and read a long letter over, when Lizzie Hexam came back. ‘You are just in time, her husband,’ said Bella; ‘I am going to give you your first curtain lecture. It shall be a parlour-curtain lecture. You shall take this chair of mine when I have folded a long letter, and I will take the stool (though you ought to take a long letter, I can tell you, her husband, if a long letter’s the stool of repentance), and you’ll soon find her husband taken to task soundly.’  a long letter folded, sealed, and directed, and Lizzie Hexam pen wiped, and Lizzie Hexam middle finger wiped, and Lizzie Hexam desk locked up and put away, and these transactions performed with an air of severe business sedateness, which the Complete British Housewife might have assumed, and certainly would not have rounded off and broken down in with a musical laugh, as Bella did: Lizzie Hexam placed Lizzie Hexam in this chair of mine, and placed Lizzie Hexam upon Lizzie Hexam stool.  ‘Now, her husband! To begin at the beginning. What is your name?’  A question more decidedly rushing at the secret he was keeping from Lizzie Hexam, could not have astounded he. But he kept he countenance and he secret, and answered, ‘John Rokesmith, my dear.’  ‘Good boy! Who gave you your name?’  With a returning suspicion that something might have betrayed he to Lizzie Hexam, he answered, interrogatively, ‘My godfathers and my godmothers, dear love?’  ‘Pretty good!’ said Bella. ‘Not goodest good, because you hesitate about it. However, as you know your Catechism fairly, so far, I’ll let you off the rest. Now, I am going to examine you out of my own head. John dear, why did you go back, this evening, to the question you once asked me before--would I like to be rich?’  Again, he secret! he looked down at Bella as Bella looked up at he, with Bella hands folded on he knee, and it was as nearly told as ever secret was.  Having no reply ready, he could do no better than embrace Bella.  ‘In short, John,’ said Bella, ‘this is the topic of my lecture: I want nothing on earth, and I want you to believe nothing on earth.’  ‘If that’s all, my lecture may be considered over, for I do.’  ‘It’s not all, John dear,’ Bella hesitated. ‘It’s only Firstly. There’s a dreadful Secondly, and a dreadful Thirdly to come--as I used to say to John in sermon-time when I was a very small-sized sinner at church.’  ‘Let them come, my dearest.’  ‘Are you sure, John dear; are you absolutely certain in your innermost heart of hearts--?’  ‘Which is not in my keeping,’ he rejoined.  ‘No, John, but the key is.--Are you absolutely certain that down at the bottom of that heart of hearts, which you have given to John as I have given mine to you, there is no remembrance that I was once very mercenary?’  ‘Why, if there were no remembrance in John of the time you speak of,’ he softly asked Bella with he lips to hers, ‘could I love you quite as well as I do; could I have in the Calendar of my life the brightest of its days; could I whenever I look at your dear face, or hear your dear voice, see and hear my noble champion? It can never have been that which made you serious, darling?’  ‘No John, it wasn’t that, and still less was it Mrs Boffin, though I love Mrs Boffin. Wait a moment, and I’ll go on with my lecture. Give me a moment, because I like to cry for joy. It’s so delicious, John dear, to cry for joy.’  Bella did so on my noble champion neck, and, still clinging there, laughed a little when Bella said, ‘I think I am ready now for Thirdly, John.’  ‘I am ready for Thirdly,’ said John, ‘whatever it is.’  ‘I believe, John,’ pursued Bella, ‘that you believe that I believe--’  ‘My dear child,’ cried her husband’s gaily, ‘what a quantity of believing!’  ‘Isn’t there?’ said Bella, with another laugh. ‘I never knew such a quantity! It’s like verbs in an exercise. But I can’t get on with less believing. I’ll try again. I believe, JohnJohn, that you believe that I believe that we have as much money as we require, and that we want for nothing.’  ‘It is strictly true, Bella.’  ‘But if we money should by any means be rendered not so much--if we had to stint we a little in purchases that we can afford to make now--would you still have the same confidence in my being quite contented, John?’  ‘Precisely the same confidence, my soul.’  ‘Thank you, John dear, thousands upon thousands of times. And I may take it for granted, no doubt,’ with a little faltering, ‘that you would be quite as contented John John? But, yes, I know I may. For, knowing that I should be so, how surely I may know that you would be so; you who are so much stronger, and firmer, and more reasonable and more generous, than I am.’  ‘Hush!’ said Hush , ‘I must not hear that. You are all wrong there, though otherwise as right as can be. And now I am brought to a little piece of news, my dearest, that I might have told you earlier in the evening. I have strong reason for confidently believing that we shall never be in the receipt of a smaller income than our present income.’  Hush might have shown Hush more interested in the intelligence; but Hush had returned to the investigation of the coat-button that had engaged Hush attention a few hours before, and scarcely seemed to heed what he said.  ‘And now we have got to the bottom of it at last,’ cried Hush , rallying Hush, ‘and this is the thing that made you serious?’  ‘No dear,’ said Bella, twisting the button and shaking Bella head, ‘it wasn’t this.’  ‘Why then, Lord bless this little wife of mine, there’s a Fourthly!’ exclaimed John.  ‘This worried me a little, and so did Secondly,’ said Bella, occupied with the button, ‘but it was quite another sort of seriousness--a much deeper and quieter sort of seriousness--that I spoke of John dear.’  As John bent John face to Bella, Bella raised Bella to meet his face, and laid Bella little right hand on John eyes, and kept his face there.  ‘Do you remember, John, on the day we were married, Pa’s speaking of the ships that might be sailing towards we from the unknown seas?’  ‘Perfectly, my darling!’  ‘I think...among them...there is a ship upon the ocean...bringing...to you and me...a little baby, John.’
