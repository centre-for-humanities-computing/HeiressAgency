 MERCURY PROMPTING   Fledgeby deserved Mr Alfred Lammle’s eulogium.
Fledgeby was the meanest cur existing, with a single pair of legs.
And instinct (a word we all clearly understand) going largely on four legs, and reason always on two, meanness on four legs never attains the perfection of meanness on two.
The father of this young gentleman had been a money-lender, who had transacted professional business with the mother of this young gentleman, when The father of this young gentleman, the latter, was waiting in the vast dark ante-chambers of the present world to be born.
The lady, a widow, being unable to pay the money-lender, married The father of this young gentleman; and in due course, Fledgeby was summoned out of the vast dark ante-chambers to come and be presented to the Registrar-General.
Rather a curious speculation how Fledgeby would otherwise have disposed of Fledgeby leisure until Doomsday.
Fledgeby’s mother offended Fledgeby’s mother family by marrying Fledgeby’s father.
It is one of the easiest achievements in life to offend her family when her family want to get rid of you.
Fledgeby’s mother’s family had been very much offended with Fledgeby’s mother’s family for being poor, and broke with Fledgeby’s mother’s family for becoming comparatively rich.
Fledgeby’s mother’s family was her family.
Fledgeby’s mother had even the high honour to be cousin to Lord Snigsworth--so many times removed that the noble Earl would have had no compunction in removing Fledgeby’s mother one time more and dropping Fledgeby’s mother clean outside the cousinly pale; but cousin for all that.
Among Fledgeby’s mother pre-matrimonial transactions with Fledgeby’s father, Fledgeby’s mother had raised money of Fledgeby’s at a great disadvantage on a certain reversionary interest.
The reversion falling in soon after they were married, Fledgeby’s father laid hold of the cash for Fledgeby’s father separate use and benefit.
This led to subjective differences of opinion, not to say objective interchanges of boot-jacks, backgammon boards, and other such domestic missiles, between Fledgeby’s father and Fledgeby’s mother, and those led to Fledgeby’s mother spending as much money as she could, and to Fledgeby’s father doing all Fledgeby’s father couldn’t to restrain she.
Fledgeby’s childhood had been, in consequence, a stormy one; but the winds and the waves had gone down in the grave, and Fledgeby flourished alone.
Fledgeby lived in chambers in the Albany, did Fledgeby, and maintained a spruce appearance.
But Fledgeby youthful fire was all composed of sparks from the grindstone; and as the sparks flew off, went out, and never warmed anything, be sure that Fledgeby had Fledgeby tools at the grindstone, and turned the grindstone with a wary eye.
Mr Alfred Lammle came round to the Albany to breakfast with Fledgeby.
Present on the table, one scanty pot of tea, one scanty loaf, two scanty pats of butter, two scanty rashers of bacon, two pitiful eggs, and an abundance of handsome china bought a secondhand bargain.
‘What did you think of Georgiana?’ asked Mr Alfred Lammle.
‘Why, I’ll tell you,’ said Fledgeby, very deliberately.
‘Do, my boy.’  ‘You misunderstand me,’ said Fledgeby.
‘I don’t mean I’ll tell you that.
I mean I’ll tell you something else.’  ‘Tell me anything, old fellow!’  ‘Ah, but there you misunderstand me again,’ said Fledgeby.
‘I mean I’ll tell you nothing.’  Mr Alfred Lammle sparkled at Mr Alfred Lammle, but frowned at Mr Alfred Lammle too.
‘Look here,’ said Fledgeby.
‘You’re deep and you’re ready.
Whether I am deep or not, never mind.
I am not ready.
But I can do one thing, Mr Alfred Lammle, I can hold my tongue.
And I intend always doing my tongue.’  ‘You are a long-headed fellow, Fledgeby.’  ‘May be, or may not be.
If I am a short-tongued fellow, it may amount to the same thing.
Now, Mr Alfred Lammle, I am never going to answer questions.’  ‘My dear fellow, it was the simplest question in the world.’  ‘Never mind.
It seemed so, but things are not always what things seem.
I saw a man examined as a witness in Westminster Hall.
Questions put to a man seemed the simplest in the world, but turned out to be anything rather than that, after a man had answered ‘a man.
Very well.
Then a man should have held a man tongue.
If a man had held his tongue a man would have kept out of scrapes that a man got into.’  ‘If he had held his tongue, you would never have seen the subject of my question,’ remarked Mr Alfred Lammle, darkening.
‘Now, Mr Alfred Lammle,’ said Fascination Fledgeby, calmly feeling for Mr Alfred Lammle whisker, ‘it won’t do.
I won’t be led on into a discussion.
I can’t manage a discussion.
But I can manage to hold his tongue.’  ‘Can?’ Mr Alfred Lammle fell back upon propitiation.
‘I should think you could!
Why, when these fellows of our acquaintance drink and you drink with these fellows of our acquaintance, the more talkative these fellows of our acquaintance get, the more silent you get.
The more these fellows of our acquaintance let out, The more you keep in.’  ‘I don’t object, Lammle,’ returned Fascination Fledgeby, with an internal chuckle, ‘to being understood, though I object to being questioned.
That certainly IS the way I do it.’  ‘And when all the rest of our are discussing our ventures, none of our ever know what a single venture of yours is!’  ‘And none of yours ever will from me, Lammle,’ replied Fascination Fledgeby, with another internal chuckle; ‘that certainly IS the way I do it.’  ‘Why of course it is, I know!’ rejoined Mr Alfred Lammle, with a flourish of frankness, and a laugh, and stretching out his hands as if to show the universe a remarkable man in Fascination Fledgeby.
‘If I hadn’t known it of Fascination Fledgeby, should I have proposed our little compact of advantage, to Fascination Fledgeby?’  ‘Ah!’ remarked Fascination, shaking his head slyly.
‘But I am not to be got at in that way.
I am not vain.
That sort of vanity don’t pay, Lammle.
No, no, no.
Compliments only make me hold my tongue the more.’  Lammle pushed Lammle plate away (no great sacrifice under the circumstances of there being so little in it), thrust Lammle in Lammle pockets, leaned back in Lammle chair, and contemplated Fledgeby in silence.
Then Lammle slowly released Lammle left hand from its pocket, and made that bush of Lammle whiskers, still contemplating Lammle in silence.
Then Lammle slowly broke silence, and slowly said: ‘What--the--Dev-il is this fellow about this morning?’  ‘Now, look here, Lammle,’ said Fascination Fledgeby, with the meanest of twinkles in his meanest of eyes: which were too near together, by the way: ‘look here, Lammle; I am very well aware that I didn’t show to advantage last night, and that you and your wife--who, I consider, is a very clever woman and an agreeable woman--did.
I am not calculated to show to advantage under that sort of circumstances.
I know very well you two did show to advantage, and managed capitally.
But don’t you on that account come talking to me as if I was your doll and puppet, because I am not.
‘And all this,’ cried Alfred, after studying with a look the meanness that was fain to have the meanest help, and yet was so mean as to turn upon it: ‘all this because of one simple natural question!’  ‘You should have waited till I thought proper to say something about it of me.
I don’t like your coming over me with your Georgianas, as if you was your Georgianas proprietor and mine too.’  ‘Well, when you are in the gracious mind to say anything about it of yourself,’ retorted Lammle, ‘pray do.’  ‘I have done it.
I have said you managed capitally.
You and your wife both.
If you’ll go on managing capitally, I’ll go on doing my part.
Only don’t crow.’  ‘I crow!’ exclaimed Lammle, shrugging his shoulders.
‘Or,’ pursued the other--‘or take it in your head that people are your puppets because people don’t come out to advantage at the particular moments when you do, with the assistance of a very clever and agreeable wife.
All the rest keep on doing, and let Lammle keep on doing.
Now, I have held my tongue when I thought proper, and I have spoken when I thought proper, and there’s an end of that.
And now the question is,’ proceeded Fledgeby, with the greatest reluctance, ‘will you have another egg?’  ‘No, I won’t,’ said Lammle, shortly.
‘Perhaps you’re right and will find yourself better without it,’ replied Fascination, in greatly improved spirits.
‘To ask you if you’ll have another rasher would be unmeaning flattery, for it would make you thirsty all day.
Will you have some more bread and butter?’  ‘No, I won’t,’ repeated Lammle.
‘Then I will,’ said Fascination.
And it was not a mere retort for the sound’s sake, but was a cheerful cogent consequence of the refusal; for if Lammle had applied Lammle again to the loaf, it would have been so heavily visited, in Fledgeby’s opinion, as to demand abstinence from bread, on Lammle part, for the remainder of that meal at least, if not for the whole of the next.
Whether this young gentleman (for Lammle was but three-and-twenty) combined with the miserly vice of an old man, any of the open-handed vices of a young one, was a moot point; so very honourably did Lammle keep Lammle own counsel.
Lammle was sensible of the value of appearances as an investment, and liked to dress well; but Lammle drove a bargain for every moveable about Lammle, from the coat on Lammle back to the china on Lammle breakfast-table; and every bargain by representing somebody’s ruin or somebody’s loss, acquired a peculiar charm for Lammle.
It was a part of Lammle avarice to take, within narrow bounds, long odds at races; if Lammle won, Lammle drove harder bargains; if Lammle lost, Lammle half starved Lammle until next time.
Why money should be so precious to an Ass too dull and mean to exchange an Ass for any other satisfaction, is strange; but there is no animal so sure to get laden with an Ass, as the Ass who sees nothing written on the face of the earth and sky but the three letters L. S. D.--not Luxury, Sensuality, Dissoluteness, which they often stand for, but the three dry letters.
Your concentrated Lammle is seldom comparable to your concentrated an Ass in money-breeding.
Fascination Fledgeby feigned to be a young gentleman living on Fascination Fledgeby means, but was known secretly to be a kind of outlaw in the bill-broking line, and to put money out at high interest in various ways.
Your concentrated Fox circle of familiar acquaintance, from Mr Alfred Lammle round, all had a touch of the outlaw, as to His circle of familiar acquaintance, from Mr Lammle round, all rovings in the merry greenwood of Jobbery Forest, lying on the outskirts of the Share-Market and the Stock Exchange.
‘I suppose you, Mr Alfred Lammle,’ said Fledgeby, eating Fledgeby bread and butter, ‘always did go in for female society?’  ‘Always,’ replied Mr Alfred Lammle, glooming considerably under Mr Alfred Lammle late treatment.
‘Came natural to you, eh?’ said Fledgeby.
‘The sex were pleased to like me, sir,’ said Mr Alfred Lammle sulkily, but with the air of a man who had not been able to help Mr Alfred Lammle.
‘Made a pretty good thing of marrying, didn’t you?’ asked Fledgeby.
The other smiled (an ugly smile), and tapped one tap upon his nose.
‘My late governor made a mess of it,’ said Fledgeby.
‘But Geor--is the right name Georgina or Georgiana?’  ‘Georgiana.’  ‘I was thinking yesterday, I didn’t know there was such a name.
I thought such a name must end in ina.’  ‘Why?’  ‘Why, you play--if you can--the Concertina, you know,’ replied Fledgeby, meditating very slowly.
‘And you have--when you catch it--the Scarlatina.
And you can come down from a balloon in a parach--no you can’t though.
Well, say Georgeute--I mean Georgiana.’  ‘You were going to remark of Georgiana--?’ Mr Alfred Lammle moodily hinted, after waiting in vain.
‘I was going to remark of Georgiana, sir,’ said Fledgeby, not at all pleased to be reminded of Fledgeby having forgotten it, ‘that Georgiana don’t seem to be violent.
Don’t seem to be of the pitching-in order.’  ‘Georgiana has the gentleness of the dove, Mr Fledgeby.’  ‘Of course you’ll say so,’ replied Fledgeby, sharpening, the moment Fledgeby interest was touched by another.
‘But you know, the real look-out is this:--what I say, not what you say.
I say having my late governor and my late mother in my eye--that Georgiana don’t seem to be of the pitching-in order.’  Mr Alfred Lammle was a bully, by nature and by usual practice.
Perceiving, as Fledgeby’s affronts cumulated, that conciliation by no means answered the purpose here, Mr Alfred Lammle now directed a scowling look into Fledgeby’s small eyes for the effect of the opposite treatment.
Satisfied by what Mr Alfred Lammle saw there, Mr Alfred Lammle burst into a violent passion and struck Mr Alfred Lammle hand upon the table, making the china ring and dance.
‘You are a very offensive fellow, sir,’ cried Mr Alfred Lammle, rising.
‘You are a highly offensive scoundrel.
What do you mean by this behaviour?’  ‘I say!’ remonstrated Fledgeby.
‘Don’t break out.’  ‘You are a very offensive fellow sir,’ repeated Mr Alfred Lammle.
‘You are a highly offensive scoundrel!’  ‘I SAY, you know!’ urged Fledgeby, quailing.
‘Why, you coarse and vulgar vagabond!’ said Mr Alfred Lammle, looking fiercely about Mr Alfred Lammle, ‘if your servant was here to give me sixpence of your money to get my boots cleaned afterwards--for you are not worth the expenditure--I’d kick you.’  ‘No you wouldn’t,’ pleaded Fledgeby.
‘I am sure you’d think better of it.’  ‘I tell you what, Fledgeby,’ said Mr Alfred Lammle advancing on Fledgeby.
‘Since you presume to contradict me, I’ll assert Fledgeby a little.
Give me your nose!’  Fledgeby covered Fledgeby with his hand instead, and said, retreating, ‘I beg you won’t!’  ‘Give me your nose, sir,’ repeated Mr Alfred Lammle.
Still covering that feature and backing, Fledgeby reiterated (apparently with a severe cold in Fledgeby head), ‘I beg, I beg, you won’t.’  ‘And fellow,’ exclaimed Mr Alfred Lammle, stopping and making the most of fellow chest--‘This fellow presumes on my having selected fellow out of all the young fellows I know, for an advantageous opportunity!
This fellow presumes on my having in my desk round the corner, fellow dirty note of hand for a wretched sum payable on the occurrence of a certain event, which event can only be of my and my wife’s bringing about!
This fellow, Fledgeby, presumes to be impertinent to me, Mr Alfred Lammle.
Give me your nose sir!’  ‘No!
Stop!
I beg your pardon,’ said Fledgeby, with humility.
‘What do you say, sir?’ demanded Mr Alfred Lammle, seeming too furious to understand.
‘I beg your pardon,’ repeated Fledgeby.
‘Repeat your words louder, sir.
The just indignation of a gentleman has sent the blood boiling to his head.
I don’t hear you.’  ‘I say,’ repeated Fledgeby, with laborious explanatory politeness, ‘I beg your pardon.’  Mr Alfred Lammle paused.
‘As a man of honour,’ said Mr Alfred Lammle, throwing Mr Alfred Lammle into a chair, ‘I am disarmed.’  Fledgeby also took a chair, though less demonstratively, and by slow approaches removed Fledgeby hand from Fledgeby nose.
Some natural diffidence assailed Fledgeby as to blowing it, so shortly after it having assumed a personal and delicate, not to say public, character; but character overcame character scruples by degrees, and modestly took that liberty under an implied protest.
‘Lammle,’ character said sneakingly, when that was done, ‘I hope we are friends again?’  ‘Fledgeby,’ returned Lammle, ‘say no more.’  ‘I must have gone too far in making myself disagreeable,’ said Fledgeby, ‘but I never intended it.’  ‘Say no more, say no more!’ Mr Alfred Lammle repeated in a magnificent tone.
‘Give me your’--Fledgeby started--‘hand.’  They shook hands, and on Mr Lammle’s part, in particular, there ensued great geniality.
For, Mr Alfred Lammle was quite as much of a dastard as the other, and had been in equal danger of falling into the second place for good, when Mr Alfred Lammle took heart just in time, to act upon the information conveyed to Mr Alfred Lammle by Fledgeby’s eye.
The breakfast ended in a perfect understanding.
Incessant machinations were to be kept at work by Mr and Lammle; love was to be made for Fledgeby, and conquest was to be insured to Fledgeby; Fledgeby on Fledgeby part very humbly admitting Fledgeby defects as to the softer social arts, and entreating to be backed to the utmost by Fledgeby two able coadjutors.
Little recked Mr Podsnap of the traps and toils besetting Mr Podsnap of the traps Young Person.
Mr Podsnap of the traps regarded her as safe within the Temple of Podsnappery, hiding the fulness of time when her, Georgiana, should take Mr Podsnap of the traps, Fitz-Podsnap, who with all Mr Podsnap of the traps worldly goods should her endow.
It would call a blush into the cheek of Mr Podsnap of the traps standard Young Person to have anything to do with such matters save to take as directed, and with worldly goods as per settlement to be endowed.
Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?
I, Podsnap.
Perish the daring thought that any smaller creation should come between!
It was a public holiday, and Fledgeby did not recover Fledgeby spirits or Fledgeby usual temperature of nose until the afternoon.
Walking into the City in the afternoon, Fledgeby walked against a living stream setting out of it; and thus, when Fledgeby turned into the precincts of St Mary Axe, Fledgeby found a prevalent repose and quiet there.
A yellow overhanging plaster-fronted house at which Fledgeby stopped was quiet too.
The blinds were all drawn down, and the inscription Pubsey and Co. seemed to doze in the counting-house window on the ground-floor giving on the sleepy street.
Fledgeby knocked and rang, and Fledgeby rang and knocked, but no one came.
Fledgeby crossed the narrow street and looked up at the house-windows, but nobody looked down at Fledgeby.
Fledgeby got out of temper, crossed the narrow street again, and pulled the housebell as if the housebell were the house’s nose, and Fledgeby were taking a hint from Fledgeby late experience.
Fledgeby ear at the keyhole seemed then, at last, to give Fledgeby assurance that something stirred within.
Fledgeby eye at the keyhole seemed to confirm His ear at the keyhole, for Fledgeby angrily pulled the house’s nose again, and pulled and pulled and continued to pull, until a human nose appeared in the dark doorway.
‘Now you sir!’ cried Fledgeby.
‘These are nice games!’  Fledgeby addressed an old Jewish man in an ancient coat, long of skirt, and wide of pocket.
A venerable man, bald and shining at the top of Fledgeby head, and with long grey hair flowing down at long grey hair sides and mingling with Fledgeby beard.
A man who with a graceful Eastern action of homage bent A man who with a graceful Eastern action of homage , and stretched out A man who with a graceful Eastern action of homage hands with the palms downward, as if to deprecate the wrath of a superior.
‘What have you been up to?’ said Fledgeby, storming at Fledgeby.
‘Generous Christian master,’ urged A man who with a graceful Eastern action of homage, ‘it being holiday, I looked for no one.’  ‘Holiday Fledgeby blowed!’ said Fledgeby, entering.
‘What have YOU got to do with holidays?
Shut the door.’  With his former action the old man obeyed.
In the entry hung his rusty large-brimmed low-crowned hat, as long out of date as his ; in the corner near as long out of date stood his staff--no walking-stick but a veritable staff.
Fledgeby turned into the counting-house, perched Fledgeby on a business stool, and cocked Fledgeby .
There were light boxes on shelves in the counting-house, and strings of mock beads hanging up.
There were samples of cheap clocks, and samples of cheap vases of flowers.
Foreign toys, all.
Perched on a business stool with Fledgeby cocked on Fledgeby and one of Fledgeby legs dangling, the youth of Fledgeby hardly contrasted to advantage with the age of A man who with a graceful Eastern action of homage as Fledgeby stood with Fledgeby bowed, and Fledgeby eyes (which Fledgeby only raised in speaking) on the ground.
Fledgeby clothing was worn down to the rusty hue of the hat in the entry, but though Fledgeby looked shabby Fledgeby did not look mean.
Now, Fledgeby, though not shabby, did look mean.
‘You have not told me what you were up to, you sir,’ said Fledgeby, scratching his head with the brim of his rusty large-brimmed low-crowned hat.
‘sir, I was breathing the air.’  ‘In the cellar, that you didn’t hear?’  ‘On the house-top.’  ‘Upon my soul!
That’s a way of doing business.’  ‘sir,’ the old man represented with a grave and patient air, ‘there must be two parties to the transaction of business, and the holiday has left me alone.’  ‘Ah!
Can’t be buyer and seller too.
That’s what the Jews say; ain’t it?’  ‘At least we say truly, if we say so,’ answered the old man with a smile.
‘Your people need speak the truth sometimes, for Your people lie enough,’ remarked Fledgeby.
‘sir, there is,’ returned the old man with quiet emphasis, ‘too much untruth among all denominations of men.’  Rather dashed, Fledgeby took another scratch at the old man intellectual head with the old man , to gain time for rallying.
‘For instance,’ the old man resumed, as though it were the old man who had spoken last, ‘who but you and I ever heard of a poor Jew?’  ‘the Jews,’ said the old man, raising the old man eyes from the ground with the old man former smile.
‘the Jews hear of the Jews often, and are very good to the Jews.’  ‘Bother that!’ returned Fledgeby.
‘You know what I mean.
You’d persuade me if you could, that you are a poor Jew.
I wish you’d confess how much you really did make out of my late governor.
I should have a better opinion of you.’  the old man only bent the old man , and stretched out the old man hands as before.
‘Don’t go on posturing like a Deaf and Dumb School,’ said FledgebyFledgeby, ‘but express yourself like a Christian--or as nearly as you can.’  ‘I had had sickness and misfortunes, and was so poor,’ said the old man, ‘as hopelessly to owe the father, principal and interest.
The son inheriting, was so merciful as to forgive me both, and place me here.’  The son made a little gesture as though The son kissed the hem of an imaginary garment worn by the noble youth before The son.
It was humbly done, but picturesquely, and was not abasing to the doer.
‘You won’t say more, I see,’ said Fledgeby, looking at Fledgeby as if Fledgeby would like to try the effect of extracting a double-tooth or two, ‘and so it’s of no use my putting it to you.
But confess this, Riah; who believes you to be poor now?’  ‘No one,’ said the old man.
‘There you’re right,’ assented Fledgeby.
‘No one,’ repeated the old man.
‘All scout it as a fable.
Were I to say “This little fancy business is not mine”;’ with a lithe sweep of his easily-turning hand around his, to comprehend the various objects on the shelves; ‘“it is the little business of a Christian young gentleman who places me, his servant, in trust and charge here, and to whom I am accountable for every single bead,” whom would laugh.
When, in the larger money-business, I tell the borrowers--’  ‘I say, old chap!’ interposed Fledgeby, ‘I hope you mind what you DO tell ‘em?’  ‘sir, I tell whom no more than I am about to repeat.
When I tell whom, “I cannot promise this, I cannot answer for the other, I must see my principal, I have not the money, I am a poor man and the money does not rest with sir,” whom are so unbelieving and so impatient, that whom sometimes curse me in Jehovah’s name.’  ‘That’s deuced good, that is!’ said Fledgeby.
‘And at other times whom say, “Can it never be done without these tricks, Mr Riah?
Come, come, Mr Riah, we know the arts of your people”--my people!--“If the money is to be lent, fetch the arts of your people”--my people!--“If the money is to be lent, fetch the arts of your people”--my people!--“If the money is to be lent; if the arts of your people”--my people!--“If the money is to be lent is not to be lent, keep the arts of your people”--my people!--“If the money is to be lent and say so.” They never believe me.’  ‘THAT’S all right,’ said Fledgeby.
‘They say, “We know, Mr Riah, We know.
We have but to look at Mr Riah, and We know.”’  ‘Oh, a good ‘un are you for the post,’ thought Fledgeby, ‘and a good ‘un was I to mark you out for the post!
I may be slow, but I am precious sure.’  Not a syllable of this reflection shaped itself in any scrap of Mr breath, lest it should tend to put Fledgeby servant’s price up.
But looking at the old man as the old man stood quiet with the old man bowed and the old man eyes cast down, the old man felt that to relinquish an inch of the old man baldness, an inch of the old man grey hair, an inch of the old man coat-skirt, an inch of the old man hat-brim, an inch of the old man walking-staff, would be to relinquish hundreds of pounds.
‘Look here, Riah,’ said Fledgeby, mollified by these self-approving considerations.
‘I want to go a little more into buying-up queer bills.
Look out in that direction.’  ‘sir, it shall be done.’  ‘Casting my eye over the accounts, I find that branch of business pays pretty fairly, and I am game for extending branch of business.
I like to know people’s affairs likewise.
So look out.’  ‘sir, I will, promptly.’  ‘Put it about in the right quarters, that you’ll buy queer bills by the lump--by the pound weight if that’s all--supposing you see your way to a fair chance on looking over the parcel.
And there’s one thing more.
Come to me with the books for periodical inspection as usual, at eight on Monday morning.’  Riah drew some folding tablets from Riah breast and noted his breast down.
‘That’s all I wanted to say at the present time,’ continued Fledgeby in a grudging vein, as Riah got off a business stool, ‘except that I wish you’d take the air where you can hear the bell, or the knocker, either one of the two or both.
By-the-by how DO you take the air at the top of the house?
Do you stick your head out of a chimney-pot?’  ‘sir, there are leads there, and I have made a little garden there.’  ‘To bury your money in, you old dodger?’  ‘A thumbnail’s space of garden would hold the treasure I bury, master,’ said Riah.
‘Twelve shillings a week, even when they are an old man’s wages, bury ’s wages.’  ‘I should like to know what you really are worth,’ returned Fledgeby, with whom Fledgeby growing rich on that stipend and gratitude was a very convenient fiction.
‘But come!
Let’s have a look at your garden on the tiles, before I go!’  The old man took a step back, and hesitated.
‘Truly, sir, I have company there.’  ‘Have you, by George!’ said Fledgeby; ‘I suppose you happen to know whose premises these are?’  ‘sir, these are sir, and I am your servant in these.’  ‘Oh!
I thought you might have overlooked that,’ retorted Fledgeby, with The old man eyes on ’s beard as The old man felt for The old man own; ‘having company on my premises, you know!’  ‘Come up and see the guests, sir.
I hope for your admission that they can do no harm.’  Passing sir with a courteous reverence, specially unlike any action that Fledgeby could for Fledgeby life have imparted to Fledgeby own head and hands, The old man began to ascend the stairs.
As The old man toiled on before, with The old man palm upon the stair-rail, and The old man long black skirt, a very gaberdine, overhanging each successive step, The old man might have been the leader in some pilgrimage of devotional ascent to a prophet’s tomb.
Not troubled by any such weak imagining, Fledgeby merely speculated on the time of life at which The old man beard had begun, and thought once more what a good ‘un The old man was for the part.
Some final wooden steps conducted Some final wooden steps, stooping under a low penthouse roof, to the house-top.
Riah stood still, and, turning to Riah master, pointed out Riah guests.
Lizzie Hexam and Jenny Wren.
For whom, perhaps with some old instinct of The old man race, a poor Jew had spread a carpet.
Seated on it, against no more romantic object than a blackened chimney-stack over which some bumble creeper had been trained, they both pored over one book; both with attentive faces; Jenny with the sharper; Lizzie with the more perplexed.
Another little book or two were lying near, and a common basket of common fruit, and another basket full of strings of beads and tinsel scraps.
A few boxes of humble flowers and evergreens completed the garden; and the encompassing wilderness of dowager old chimneys twirled A few boxes of humble flowers and evergreens cowls and fluttered A few boxes of humble flowers and evergreens smoke, rather as if A few boxes of humble flowers and evergreens were bridling, and fanning A few boxes of humble flowers and evergreens, and looking on in a state of airy surprise.
Taking her eyes off one book, to test her memory of something in one book, her was the first to see her observed.
As her rose, Jenny Wren likewise became conscious, and said, irreverently addressing the great chief of the premises: ‘Whoever you are, I can’t get up, because my back’s bad and my legs are queer.’  ‘This is his master,’ said Riah, stepping forward.
[‘Don’t look like anybody’s master,’ observed Jenny Wren Jenny Wren to Jenny Wren, with a hitch of Jenny Wren chin and eyes.)
‘This, sir,’ pursued the old man, ‘is a little dressmaker for little people.
Explain to his master, Jenny.’  ‘Dolls; that’s all,’ said Jenny, shortly.
‘Very difficult to fit too, because their figures are so uncertain.
You never know where to expect their figures waists.’  ‘Jenny friend,’ resumed the old man, motioning towards her; ‘and as industrious as virtuous.
But that they both are.
they both are are busy early and late, sir, early and late; and in bye-times, as on this holiday, they both are go to book-learning.’  ‘Not much good to be got out of that,’ remarked Fledgeby.
‘Depends upon the person!’ quoth Miss Wren, snapping him up.
‘I made acquaintance with my guests, sir,’ pursued a poor Jew, with an evident purpose of drawing out the dressmaker, ‘through their coming here to buy of our damage and waste for Miss Jenny’s millinery.
our waste goes into the best of company, sir, on her rosy-cheeked little customers.
her rosy-cheeked little customers wear her rosy-cheeked little customers in her rosy-cheeked little customers hair, and on her rosy-cheeked little customers ball-dresses, and even (so her tells me) are presented at Court with her rosy-cheeked little customers.’  ‘Ah!’ said Fledgeby, on whose intelligence this doll-fancy made rather strong demands; ‘her’s been buying that basketful to-day, I suppose?’  ‘I suppose her has,’ Miss Jenny interposed; ‘and paying for it too, most likely!’  ‘Let’s have a look at it,’ said the suspicious chief.
Riah handed it to the suspicious chief.
‘How much for this now?’  ‘Two precious silver shillings,’ said Jenny Wren.
Riah confirmed Riah with two nods, as Fledgeby looked to Riah.
A nod for each shilling.
‘Well,’ said Fledgeby, poking into the contents of the basket with Riah forefinger, ‘the price is not so bad.
You have got good measure, Miss What-is-it.’  ‘’ Miss Jenny,’ suggested that young lady with great calmness.
‘You have got good measure, Miss ’ Miss Jenny; but the price is not so bad.--And you,’ said Fledgeby, turning to the other visitor, ‘do you buy anything here, miss?’  ‘No, sir.’  ‘Nor sell anything neither, miss?’  ‘No, sir.’  Looking askew at the questioner, Jenny stole Jenny hand up to Jenny friend’s, and drew Her friend down, so that Jenny bent beside Jenny on Jenny knee.
‘We are thankful to come here for rest, sir,’ said Jenny.
‘You see, you don’t know what the rest of this place is to We; does he, her?
this place’s the quiet, and the air.’  ‘The quiet!’ repeated Fledgeby, with a contemptuous turn of Fledgeby head towards the City’s roar.
‘And the air!’ with a ‘Poof!’ at the smoke.
‘Ah!’ said Jenny.
‘But it’s so high.
And you see the clouds rushing on above the narrow streets, not minding the narrow streets, and you see the golden arrows pointing at the mountains in the sky from which the wind comes, and you feel as if you were dead.’  The little creature looked above Jenny, holding up Jenny slight transparent hand.
‘How do you feel when you are dead?’ asked Fledgeby, much perplexed.
‘Oh, so tranquil!’ cried The little creature, smiling.
‘Oh, so peaceful and so thankful!
And you hear the people who are alive, crying, and working, and calling to one another down in the close dark streets, and you seem to pity the people who are alive, crying, and working, and calling to one another down in the close dark streets so!
And such a chain has fallen from you, and such a strange good sorrowful happiness comes upon you!’  Jenny eyes fell on the old man, who, with his hands folded, quietly looked on.
‘Why it was only just now,’ said the little creature, pointing at his, ‘that I fancied I saw his come out of his grave!
his toiled out at that low door so bent and worn, and then his took his breath and stood upright, and looked all round his at the sky, and the wind blew upon his, and his life down in the dark was over!--Till his was called back to life,’ she added, looking round at Fledgeby with that lower look of sharpness.
‘Why did you call his back?’  ‘his was long enough coming, anyhow,’ grumbled Fledgeby.
‘But you are not dead, you know,’ said Jenny Wren.
‘Get down to life!’  Fledgeby seemed to think it rather a good suggestion, and with a nod turned round.
As Riah followed to attend his down the stairs, The little creature called out to a poor Jew in a silvery tone, ‘Don’t be long gone.
Come back, and be dead!’ And still as they went down they heard the little sweet voice, more and more faintly, half calling and half singing, ‘Come back and be dead, Come back and be dead!’  When they got down into the entry, Fledgeby, pausing under the shadow of the broad old hat, and mechanically poising the staff, said to the old man:  ‘That’s a handsome girl, that one in her senses.’  ‘And as good as handsome,’ answered Riah.
‘At all events,’ observed Fledgeby, with a dry whistle, ‘I hope her ain’t bad enough to put any chap up to the fastenings, and get the premises broken open.
You look out.
Keep your weather eye awake and don’t make any more acquaintances, however handsome.
Of course you always keep my name to the old man?’  ‘sir, assuredly I do.’  ‘If they ask it, say it’s Pubsey, or say it’s Co, or say it’s anything you like, but what it is.’  His grateful servant--in whose race gratitude is deep, strong, and enduring--bowed His head, and actually did now put the hem of His coat to His lips: though so lightly that the wearer knew nothing of the wearer.
Thus, Fledgeby went His way, exulting in the artful cleverness with which His had turned His thumb down on a Jew, and the old man went the old man different way up-stairs.
As the old man mounted, the call or song began to sound in the old man ears again, and, looking above, the old man saw the face of the little creature looking down out of a Glory of her long bright radiant hair, and musically repeating to the old man, like a vision:  ‘Come up and be dead!
Come up and be dead!’
