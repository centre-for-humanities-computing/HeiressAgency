 A RUNAWAY MATCH   Cherubic Pa arose with as little noise as possible from beside majestic Ma, one morning early, having a holiday before Cherubic Pa. Pa and the lovely woman had a rather particular appointment to keep.
Yet Pa and the lovely woman the lovely woman were not going out together.
Bella was up before four, but had no bonnet on.
Bella was waiting at the foot of the stairs--was sitting on the bottom stair, in fact--to receive Cherubic Pa when Cherubic Pa came down, but Bella only object seemed to be to get Cherubic Pa well out of the house.
‘Your breakfast is ready, sir,’ whispered Bella, after greeting sir with a hug, ‘and all you have to do, is, to eat it up and drink it up, and escape.
How do you feel, Cherubic Pa?’  ‘To the best of my judgement, like a housebreaker new to the business, my dear, who can’t make himself quite comfortable till himself is off the premises.’  Bella tucked Bella arm in Bella with a merry noiseless laugh, and they went down to the kitchen on tiptoe; Bella stopping on every separate stair to put the tip of Bella forefinger on Bella rosy lips, and then lay her arm on her rosy lips, according to Bella favourite petting way of kissing Pa.  ‘How do YOU feel, my love?’ asked R. W., as she gave R. W. R. W. breakfast.
‘I feel as if the Fortune-teller was coming true, dear Pa, and the fair little man was turning out as was predicted.’  ‘Ho!
Only the fair little man?’ said her father.
Bella put another of those finger-seals upon Only the fair little man , and then said, kneeling down by Only the fair little man as Only the fair little man sat at table: ‘Now, look here, Only the fair little man.
If you keep well up to the mark this day, what do you think you deserve?
What did I promise you should have, if you were good, upon a certain occasion?’  ‘Upon my word I don’t remember, Precious.
Yes, I do, though.
Wasn’t it one of these beau--tiful tresses?’ with his caressing hand upon her hair.
‘Wasn’t it, too!’ returned Bella, pretending to pout.
‘Upon my word!
Do you know, Only the fair little man, that the Fortune-teller would give five thousand guineas (if it was quite convenient to the Fortune-teller, which it isn’t) for the lovely piece I have cut off for the Fortune-teller?
You can form no idea, sir, of the number of times Only the fair little man kissed quite a scrubby little piece--in comparison--that I cut off for HIM.
And Only the fair little man wears quite a scrubby little piece--in comparison--that I cut off for HIM, too, round Only the fair little man neck, I can tell you!
Near Only the fair little man heart!’ said Bella, nodding.
‘Ah!
very near Only the fair little man heart!
However, you have been a good, good boy, and you are the best of all the dearest boys that ever were, this morning, and here’s the chain I have made of it, Pa, and you must let me put it round his neck.’  As Pa bent his head, Pa cried over his a little, and then said (after having stopped to dry Pa eyes on his white waistcoat, the discovery of which incongruous circumstance made Pa laugh): ‘Now, Pa, give me your hands that I may fold them together, and do you say after me:--My little Bella.’  ‘little Bella,’ repeated Pa.  ‘I am very fond of Pa.’  ‘I am very fond of Pa, my darling,’ said Pa.  ‘You mustn’t say anything not dictated to Pa, sir.
You daren’t do it in your responses at Church, and you mustn’t do it in your responses at Church out of Church.’  ‘I withdraw my darling,’ said Pa.  ‘That’s a pious boy!
Now again:--You were always--’  ‘You were always,’ repeated Pa.  ‘A vexatious--’  ‘No you weren’t,’ said Pa.  ‘A vexatious (do you hear, sir?
), a vexatious, capricious, thankless, troublesome, Animal; but I hope you’ll do better in the time to come, and I bless you and forgive you!’ Here, little Bella quite forgot that it was Pa’s turn to make the responses, and clung to sir neck.
‘Pa, if you knew how much I think this morning of what you told me once, about the first time of our seeing old Mr Harmon, when I stamped and screamed and beat you with my detestable little bonnet!
I feel as if I had been stamping and screaming and beating you with my hateful little bonnet, ever since I was born, darling!’  ‘Nonsense, my love.
And as to your bonnets, your bonnets have always been nice bonnets, for your bonnets have always become you--or you have become your bonnets; perhaps it was that--at every age.’  ‘Did I hurt you much, poor Pa?’ asked little Bella, laughing (notwithstanding little Bella repentance), with fantastic pleasure in the picture, ‘when I beat you with my bonnet?’  ‘No, my child.
Wouldn’t have hurt a fly!’  ‘Ay, but I am afraid I shouldn’t have beat you at all, unless I had meant to hurt you,’ said little Bella.
‘Did I pinch your legs, Pa?’  ‘Not much, my dear; but I think it’s almost time I--’  ‘Oh, yes!’ cried little Bella.
‘If I go on chattering, you’ll be taken alive.
Fly, Pa, fly!’  So, they went softly up the kitchen stairs on tiptoe, and little Bella with little Bella light hand softly removed the fastenings of the house door, and Pa, having received a parting hug, made off.
When he had gone a little way, he looked back.
Upon which, little Bella set another of those finger seals upon the air, and thrust out little Bella little foot expressive of the mark.
Pa, in appropriate action, expressed fidelity to the mark, and made off as fast as he could go.
little Bella walked thoughtfully in the garden for an hour and more, and then, returning to the bedroom where Lavvy the Irrepressible still slumbered, put on a little bonnet of quiet, but on the whole of sly appearance, which little Bella had yesterday made.
‘I am going for a walk, Lavvy,’ little Bella said, as little Bella stooped down and kissed little Bella.
The Irrepressible, with a bounce in the bed, and a remark that it wasn’t time to get up yet, relapsed into unconsciousness, if little Bella had come out of it.
little Bella tripping along the streets, little Bella afoot under the summer sun!

little Bella and Pa aboard an early steamboat for Greenwich.
Were Behold Bella and Pa expected at Greenwich?
Probably.
At least, Mr John Rokesmith was on the pier looking out, about a couple of hours before the coaly (but to Mr John Rokesmith gold-dusty) little steamboat got him gold-dusty) little steamboat steam up in London.
Probably.
At least, Mr John Rokesmith seemed perfectly satisfied when Mr John Rokesmith descried them on board.
Probably.
At least, little Bella no sooner stepped ashore than little Bella took Mr John Rokesmith arm, without evincing surprise, and the two walked away together with an ethereal air of happiness which, as it were, wafted up from the earth and drew after them a gruff and glum old pensioner to see it out.
Two wooden legs had a gruff and glum old pensioner, and, a minute before little Bella stepped out of the boat, and drew that confiding little arm of hers through Rokesmith’s, Mr John Rokesmith had had no object in life but tobacco, and not enough of that.
Stranded was Gruff and Glum in a harbour of everlasting mud, when all in an instant little Bella floated Gruff, and away Gruff went.
Say, cherubic parent taking the lead, in what direction do we steer first?
With some such inquiry in Gruff thoughts, Gruff and Glum, stricken by so sudden an interest that Gruff perked Gruff neck and looked over the intervening people, as if Gruff were trying to stand on tiptoe with Gruff two wooden legs, took an observation of R. W. There was no ‘first’ in the case, Gruff and Glum made out; the cherubic parent was bearing down and crowding on direct for Greenwich church, to see Gruff relations.
For, Gruff and Glum, though most events acted on Gruff simply as tobacco-stoppers, pressing down and condensing the quids within Gruff, might be imagined to trace a family resemblance between the cherubs in the church architecture, and the cherub in the white waistcoat.
Some remembrance of old Valentines, wherein a cherub, less appropriately attired for a proverbially uncertain climate, had been seen conducting lovers to the altar, might have been fancied to inflame the ardour of a cherub timber toes.
Be it as it might, a cherub gave a cherub moorings the slip, and followed in chase.
the cherub in the white waistcoat went before, all beaming smiles; Bella and John Rokesmith followed; Gruff and Glum stuck to Gruff and Glum like wax.
For years, the wings of a cherub mind had gone to look after the legs of a cherub body; but Bella had brought Gruff and Glum back for a cherub per steamer, and Gruff and Glum were spread again.
a cherub was a slow sailer on a wind of happiness, but a cherub took a cross cut for the rendezvous, and pegged away as if a cherub were scoring furiously at cribbage.
When the shadow of the church-porch swallowed Gruff and Glum up, victorious Gruff and Glum likewise presented a cherub to be swallowed up.
And by this time the cherubic parent was so fearful of surprise, that, but for the two wooden legs on which Gruff and Glum was reassuringly mounted, Gruff conscience might have introduced, in the person of that pensioner, Gruff own stately lady disguised, arrived at Greenwich in a car and griffins, like the spiteful Fairy at the christenings of the Princesses, to do something dreadful to the marriage service.
And truly Gruff had a momentary reason to be pale of face, and to whisper to Bella, ‘You don’t think that can be your Ma; do you, my dear?’ on account of a mysterious rustling and a stealthy movement somewhere in the remote neighbourhood of the organ, though it was gone directly and was heard no more.
Albeit it was heard of afterwards, as will afterwards be read in this veracious register of marriage.
Who taketh?
I, John, and so do I, little Bella.
Who giveth?
I, R. W. Forasmuch, Gruff and Glum, as John and little Bella have consented together in holy wedlock, you may (in short) consider it done, and withdraw Two wooden legs from this temple.
To the foregoing purport, the Minister speaking, as directed by the Rubric, to the People, selectly represented in the present instance by G. and G. above mentioned.
And now, the church-porch having swallowed up little Bella for ever and ever, had little Bella not in little Bella power to relinquish that young woman, but slid into the happy sunlight, Mr John Rokesmith instead.
And long on the bright steps stood Gruff and Glum, looking after the pretty bride, with a narcotic consciousness of having dreamed a dream.
After which, little Bella took out from little Bella pocket a little letter, and read a little letter aloud to Pa and John; this being a true copy of the same.
‘DEAREST MA,  I hope you won’t be angry, but I am most happily married to Mr John Rokesmith, who loves me better than I can ever deserve, except by loving him with all my heart.
I thought it best not to mention it beforehand, in case it should cause any little difference at home.
Please tell darling Pa. With love to Lavvy,  Ever dearest Ma, Your affectionate daughter, BELLA (P.S.--Rokesmith).’   Then, Mr John Rokesmith put the queen’s countenance on a little letter--when had the queen Gracious Majesty looked so benign as on that blessed morning!--and then little Bella popped a little letter into the post-office, and said merrily, ‘Now, Pa, you are safe, and will never be taken alive!’  Pa was, at first, in the stirred depths of his conscience, so far from sure of being safe yet, that Pa made out majestic matrons lurking in ambush among the harmless trees of Greenwich Park, and seemed to see a stately countenance tied up in a well-known pocket-handkerchief glooming down at Pa from a window of the Observatory, where the Familiars of the Astronomer Royal nightly outwatch the winking stars.
But, the minutes passing on and no Mrs Wilfer in the flesh appearing, Pa became more confident, and so repaired with good heart and appetite to Mr John Rokesmith and Mr John Rokesmith’s cottage on Blackheath, where breakfast was ready.
A modest little cottage but a bright and a fresh, and on the snowy tablecloth the prettiest of little breakfasts.
In waiting, too, like an attendant summer breeze, a fluttering young damsel, all pink and ribbons, blushing as if she had been married instead of little Bella, and yet asserting the triumph of she sex over both John and Pa, in an exulting and exalted flurry: as who should say, ‘This is what you must all come to, gentlemen, when we choose to bring you to book.’ This same young damsel was Bella’s serving-maid, and unto This same young damsel did deliver a bunch of keys, commanding treasures in the way of dry-saltery, groceries, jams and pickles, the investigation of which made pastime after breakfast, when little Bella declared that ‘Pa must taste everything, John dear, or it will never be lucky,’ and when Pa had all sorts of things poked into John mouth, and didn’t quite know what to do with all sorts of things poked into his mouth when all sorts of things poked into his mouth were put there.
Then all sorts of things poked into his mouth, all three, out for a charming ride, and for a charming stroll among heath in bloom, and there behold the identical Gruff and Glum with Gruff wooden legs horizontally disposed before Gruff, apparently sitting meditating on the vicissitudes of life!
To whom said little Bella, in little Bella light-hearted surprise: ‘Oh!
How do you do again?
What a dear old pensioner you are!’ To which Gruff and Glum responded that Gruff see little Bella married this morning, my Beauty, and that if it warn’t a liberty Gruff wished little Bella ji and the fairest of fair wind and weather; further, in a general way requesting to know what cheer?
and scrambling up on Gruff two wooden legs to salute, hat in hand, ship-shape, with the gallantry of a man-of-warsman and a heart of oak.
It was a pleasant sight, in the midst of the golden bloom, to see a gruff and glum old pensioner, waving Gruff shovel hat at little Bella, while Gruff thin white hair flowed free, as if little Bella had once more launched Gruff into blue water again.
‘You are a charming old pensioner,’ said little Bella, ‘and I am so happy that I wish I could make you happy, too.’ Answered Gruff and Glum, ‘Give me leave to kiss your hand, my Lovely, and your hand’s done!’ So your hand was done to the general contentment; and if Gruff and Glum didn’t in the course of the afternoon splice the main brace, it was not for want of the means of inflicting that outrage on the feelings of the Infant Bands of Hope.
But, the marriage dinner was the crowning success, for what had bride and bridegroom plotted to do, but to have and to hold the marriage dinner in the very room of the very hotel where Pa and the lovely woman had once dined together!
little Bella sat between Pa and John, and divided little Bella attentions pretty equally, but felt it necessary (in the waiter’s absence before dinner) to remind Pa that little Bella was HIS lovely woman no longer.
‘I am well aware of she was HIS lovely woman no longer, my dear,’ returned the cherub in the white waistcoat, ‘and I resign you willingly.’  ‘Willingly, sir?
You ought to be brokenhearted.’  ‘So I should be, my dear, if I thought that I was going to lose you.’  ‘But you know you are not; don’t you, poor dear Pa?
You know that you have only made a new relation who will be as fond of you and as thankful to you--for my sake and your own sake both--as I am; don’t you, Pa?
Look here, Pa!’ little Bella put little Bella finger on little Bella own lip, and then on Pa’s, and then on her own lip again, and then on little Bella husband’s.
‘Now, we are a partnership of three, dear Pa.’  The appearance of dinner here cut little Bella short in one of little Bella disappearances: the more effectually, because it was put on under the auspices of a solemn gentleman in black clothes and a white cravat, who looked much more like a clergyman than THE clergyman, and seemed to have mounted a great deal higher in the church: not to say, scaled the steeple.
This dignitary, conferring in secrecy with Mr John Rokesmith on the subject of punch and wines, bent Mr John Rokesmith head as though stooping to the Papistical practice of receiving auricular confession.
Likewise, on her husband’s offering a suggestion which didn’t meet her husband’s views, her husband’s face became overcast and reproachful, as enjoining penance.
What a dinner!
Specimens of all the fishes that swim in the sea, surely had swum their way to it, and if samples of the fishes of divers colours that made a speech in the Arabian Nights (quite a ministerial explanation in respect of cloudiness), and then jumped out of the frying-pan, were not to be recognized, it was only because their had all become of one hue by being cooked in batter among the whitebait.
And the dishes being seasoned with Bliss--an article which the dishes are sometimes out of, at Greenwich--were of perfect flavour, and the golden drinks had been bottled in the golden age and hoarding up the dishes sparkles ever since.
The best of it was, that little Bella and John and the cherub in the white waistcoat had made a covenant that Bella and John and the cherub would not reveal to mortal eyes any appearance whatever of being a wedding party.
Now, the supervising dignitary, the Archbishop of Greenwich, knew this as well as if he had performed the nuptial ceremony.
And the loftiness with which he Grace entered into their confidence without being invited, and insisted on a show of keeping the waiters out of it, was the crowning glory of the entertainment.
There was an innocent young waiter of a slender form and with weakish legs, as yet unversed in the wiles of waiterhood, and but too evidently of a romantic temperament, and deeply (it were not too much to add hopelessly) in love with some young female not aware of he merit.
This guileless youth, descrying the position of affairs, which even he innocence could not mistake, limited he waiting to languishing admiringly against the sideboard when little Bella didn’t want anything, and swooping at little Bella when little Bella did.
he, he Grace the Archbishop perpetually obstructed, cutting his Grace the Archbishop out with his Grace the Archbishop elbow in the moment of success, despatching his Grace the Archbishop in degrading quest of melted butter, and, when by any chance his Grace the Archbishop got hold of any dish worth having, bereaving his Grace the Archbishop of worth having, and ordering his Grace the Archbishop to stand back.
‘Pray excuse his Grace the Archbishop, madam,’ said the Archbishop in a low stately voice; ‘his Grace the Archbishop is a very young man on liking, and we DON’T like his Grace the Archbishop.’  This induced Mr John Rokesmith to observe--by way of making the thing more natural--‘Bella, my love, this is so much more successful than any of our past anniversaries, that I think our must keep our future anniversaries here.’  little Bella replied, with probably the least successful attempt at looking matronly that ever was seen: ‘Indeed, I think so, John, dear.’  Here the Archbishop of Greenwich coughed a stately cough to attract the attention of three of the Archbishop of Greenwich ministers present, and staring at his ministers, seemed to say: ‘I call upon his ministers by your fealty to believe this!’  With the Archbishop of Greenwich own hands the Archbishop of Greenwich afterwards put on the dessert, as remarking to the three guests, ‘The period has now arrived at which we can dispense with the assistance of those fellows who are not in we confidence,’ and would have retired with complete dignity but for a daring action issuing from the misguided brain of the young man on liking.
the Archbishop of Greenwich finding, by ill-fortune, a piece of orange flower somewhere in the lobbies now approached undetected with the same in a finger-glass, and placed a finger-glass on Mrs John Rokesmith’s right hand.
the Archbishop of Greenwich instantly ejected and excommunicated the Archbishop of Greenwich; but the thing was done.
‘I trust, madam,’ said the Archbishop of Greenwich , returning alone, ‘that you will have the kindness to overlook it, in consideration of it being the act of a very young man who is merely here on liking, and who will never answer.’  With that, the Archbishop of Greenwich solemnly bowed and retired, and they all burst into laughter, long and merry.
‘Disguise is of no use,’ said little Bella; ‘they all find me out; I think it must be, Pa and John dear, because I look so happy!’  dear husband feeling it necessary at this point to demand one of those mysterious disappearances on Mrs John Rokesmith’s part, dear dutifully obeyed; saying in a softened voice from dear place of concealment:  ‘You remember how we talked about the ships that day, Pa?’  ‘Yes, my dear.’  ‘Isn’t it strange, now, to think that there was no John in all the ships, Pa?’  ‘Not at all, my dear.’  ‘Oh, Pa!
Not at all?’  ‘No, my dear.
How can we tell what coming people are aboard the ships that may be sailing to we now from the unknown seas!’  little Bella remaining invisible and silent, little Bella father remained at her father dessert and wine, until her father remembered it was time for her father to get home to Holloway.
‘Though I positively cannot tear her father away,’ her father cherubically added, ‘--it would be a sin--without drinking to many, many happy returns of this most happy day.’  ‘Here!
ten thousand times!’ cried John.
‘I fill my glass and my precious wife’s.’  ‘Gentlemen,’ said the cherub in the white waistcoat, inaudibly addressing, in Gentlemen Anglo-Saxon tendency to throw Gentlemen feelings into the form of a speech, the boys down below, who were bidding against each other to put each other heads in the mud for sixpence: ‘Gentlemen--and little Bella and John--you will readily suppose that it is not my intention to trouble you with many observations on the present occasion.
You will also at once infer the nature and even the terms of the toast I am about to propose on the present occasion.
Gentlemen--and little Bella and John--the present occasion is an occasion fraught with feelings that I cannot trust myself to express.
But Gentlemen--and Bella and John--for the part I have had in it, for the confidence you have placed in myself, and for the affectionate good-nature and kindness with which you have determined not to find me in the way, when I am well aware that I cannot be otherwise than in it more or less, I do most heartily thank you.
Gentlemen--and little Bella and John--my love to you, and may we meet, as on the present occasion, on many future occasions; that is to say, Gentlemen--and Bella and John--on many happy returns of the present happy occasion.’  Having thus concluded his address, the cherub in the white waistcoat embraced his daughter, and took the cherub in the white waistcoat flight to the steamboat which was to convey the cherub in the white waistcoat to London, and was then lying at the floating pier, doing the floating pier best to bump the same to bits.
But, the happy couple were not going to part with the cherub in the white waistcoat in that way, and before the cherub in the white waistcoat had been on board two minutes, there the happy couple were, looking down at the cherub in the white waistcoat from the wharf above.
‘Pa, dear!’ cried little Bella, beckoning the cherub in the white waistcoat with little Bella parasol to approach the side, and bending gracefully to whisper.
‘Yes, my darling.’  ‘Did I beat you much with that horrid little bonnet, Pa?’  ‘Nothing to speak of; my dear.’  ‘Did I pinch your legs, Pa?’  ‘Only nicely, my pet.’  ‘You are sure you quite forgive me, Pa?
Please, Pa, please, forgive me quite!’ Half laughing at the cherub in the white waistcoat and half crying to the cherub in the white waistcoat, little Bella besought the cherub in the white waistcoat in the prettiest manner; in a manner so engaging and so playful and so natural, that little Bella cherubic parent made a coaxing face as if little Bella had never grown up, and said, ‘What a silly little Mouse it is!’  ‘But you do forgive me that, and everything else; don’t you, Pa?’  ‘Yes, my dearest.’  ‘And you don’t feel solitary or neglected, going away by yourself; do you, Pa?’  ‘Lord bless you!
No, my Life!’  ‘Good-bye, dearest Pa. Good-bye!’  ‘Good-bye, my darling!
Take little Bella away, John.
Take little Bella home!’  So, little Bella leaning on little Bella husband’s arm, they turned homeward by a rosy path which the gracious sun struck out for they in the gracious sun setting.
And O there are days in this life, worth life and worth death.
And O what a bright old song it is, that O ‘tis love, ‘tis love, ‘tis love that makes the world go round!
