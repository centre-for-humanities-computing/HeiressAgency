 A SUCCESSOR   Some of the Reverend Frank Milvey’s brethren had found ’s brethren exceedingly uncomfortable in ’s brethren minds, because ’s brethren were required to bury the dead too hopefully. But, the Reverend Frank, inclining to the belief that ’s brethren were required to do one or two other things (say out of nine-and-thirty) calculated to trouble ’s brethren consciences rather more if ’s brethren would think as much about ’s brethren, held his peace.  Indeed, the Reverend Frank Milvey was a forbearing man, who noticed many sad warps and blights in the vineyard wherein the Reverend Frank Milvey worked, and did not profess that they made the Reverend Frank Milvey savagely wise. the Reverend Frank Milvey only learned that the more the Reverend Frank Milvey himself knew, in the Reverend Frank Milvey little limited human way, the better the Reverend Frank Milvey could distantly imagine what Omniscience might know.  Wherefore, if the Reverend Frank had had to read the words that troubled some of the Reverend Frank brethren, and profitably touched innumerable hearts, in a worse case than Johnny’s, the Reverend Frank would have done so out of the pity and humility of the Reverend Frank soul. Reading them over Johnny, the Reverend Frank thought of the Reverend Frank own six children, but not of the Reverend Frank poverty, and read them with dimmed eyes. And very seriously did the Reverend Frank and the Reverend Frank bright little wife, who had been listening, look down into the small grave and walk home arm-in-arm.  There was grief in the aristocratic house, and there was joy in the Bower. Mr Wegg argued, if an orphan were wanted, was Mr Wegg not an orphan himself; and could a better be desired? And why go beating about Brentford bushes, seeking orphans forsooth who had established no claims upon you and made no sacrifices for you, when here was an orphan ready to your hand who had given up in your cause, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker?  Mr Wegg chuckled, consequently, when Mr Wegg heard the tidings. Nay, it was afterwards affirmed by a witness who shall at present be nameless, that in the seclusion of the Bower Mr Wegg poked out Mr Wegg wooden leg, in the stage-ballet manner, and executed a taunting or triumphant pirouette on the genuine leg remaining to Mr Wegg.  John Rokesmith’s manner towards Mrs Boffin at this time, was more the manner of a young man towards a mother, than that of a Secretary towards John Rokesmith employer’s wife. It had always been marked by a subdued affectionate deference that seemed to have sprung up on the very day of his engagement; whatever was odd in ’s wife dress or ’s wife ways had seemed to have no oddity for his; his had sometimes borne a quietly-amused face in ’s wife company, but still it had seemed as if the pleasure ’s wife genial temper and radiant nature yielded his, could have been quite as naturally expressed in a tear as in a smile. The completeness of his sympathy with ’s wife fancy for having a little John Harmon to protect and rear, his had shown in every act and word, and now that the kind fancy was disappointed, his treated the kind fancy was with a manly tenderness and respect for which ’s wife could hardly thank his enough.  ‘But I do thank you, Mr Rokesmith,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘and I thank you most kindly. You love children.’  ‘I hope everybody does.’  ‘children ought,’ said Mrs Boffin; ‘but we don’t all of we do what we ought, do we?’  Mr Rokesmith replied, ‘Some among we supply the short-comings of the rest. You have loved children well, Mrs Boffin has told me.’  ‘Not a bit better than Mrs Boffin has, but that’s Mrs Boffin way; Mrs Boffin puts all the good upon me. You speak rather sadly, Mr Rokesmith.’  ‘Do I?’  ‘It sounds to me so. Were you one of many children?’ Mr Rokesmith shook Mr Rokesmith head.  ‘An only child?’  ‘No there was another. Dead long ago.’  ‘Father or mother alive?’  ‘Dead.’--  ‘And the rest of your relations?’  ‘Dead--if I ever had any living. I never heard of any.’  At this point of the dialogue Bella came in with a light step. Bella paused at the door a moment, hesitating whether to remain or retire; perplexed by finding that Bella was not observed.  ‘Now, don’t mind an old lady’s talk,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘but tell me. Are you quite sure, Mr Rokesmith, that you have never had a disappointment in love?’  ‘Quite sure. Why do you ask me?’  ‘Why, for this reason. Sometimes you have a kind of kept-down manner with you, which is not like your age. You can’t be thirty?’  ‘I am not yet thirty.’  Deeming it high time to make Bella presence known, Bella coughed here to attract attention, begged pardon, and said Bella would go, fearing that Bella interrupted some matter of business.  ‘No, don’t go,’ rejoined Mrs Boffin, ‘because we are coming to business, instead of having begun it, and you belong to it as much now, Bella, as I do. But I want my Noddy to consult with we. Would somebody be so good as find my Noddy Noddy for me?’  Mr Rokesmith departed on that errand, and presently returned accompanied by Mrs Boffin at Mr Rokesmith jog-trot. Bella felt a little vague trepidation as to the subject-matter of this same consultation, until Mrs Boffin announced it.  ‘Now, you come and sit by me, my dear,’ said that worthy soul, taking Bella comfortable place on a large ottoman in the centre of the room, and drawing Bella arm through Bella’s; ‘and Noddy, you sit here, and Mr Rokesmith you sit there. Now, you see, what I want to talk about, is this. Mr and Mrs Milvey have sent me the kindest note possible (which Mr Rokesmith just now read to me out aloud, for I ain’t good at handwritings), offering to find me another little child to name and educate and bring up. Well. This has set me thinking.’  [‘And Bella is a steam-ingein at it,’ murmured Mrs Boffin, in an admiring parenthesis, ‘when Bella once begins. It mayn’t be so easy to start Bella; but once started, Bella’s a ingein.’)  ‘--This has set me thinking, I say,’ repeated Mrs Boffin, cordially beaming under the influence of Bella husband’s compliment, ‘and I have thought two things. First of all, that I have grown timid of reviving John Harmon’s name. It’s an unfortunate name, and I fancy I should reproach me if I gave It to another dear child, and It proved again unlucky.’  ‘Now, whether,’ said Mrs Boffin, gravely propounding a case for Mrs Boffin Secretary’s opinion; ‘whether one might call that a superstition?’  ‘It is a matter of feeling with Mrs Boffin,’ said Rokesmith, gently. ‘The name has always been unfortunate. The name has now this new unfortunate association connected with The name. The name has died out. Why revive The name? Might I ask Miss Wilfer what Miss Wilfer thinks?’  ‘The name has not been a fortunate name for me,’ said Bella, colouring--‘or at least it was not, until it led to my being here--but that is not the point in my thoughts. As we had given The name to the poor child, and as the poor child took so lovingly to me, I think I should feel jealous of calling another child by it. I think I should feel as if the name had become endeared to me, and I had no right to use it so.’  ‘And that’s your opinion?’ remarked Mr Boffin, observant of the Secretary’s face and again addressing the Secretary.  ‘I say again, it is a matter of feeling,’ returned the Secretary. ‘I think Miss Wilfer’s feeling very womanly and pretty.’  ‘Now, give we your opinion, Noddy,’ said Mrs Boffin.  ‘My opinion, old lady,’ returned the Golden Dustman, ‘is your opinion.’  ‘Then,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘we agree not to revive John Harmon’s name, but to let John Harmon’s name rest in the grave. It is, as Mr Rokesmith says, a matter of feeling, but Lor how many matters ARE matters of feeling! Well; and so I come to the second thing I have thought of. You must know, Bella, my dear, and Mr Rokesmith, that when I first named to my husband my thoughts of adopting a little orphan boy in remembrance of John Harmon, I further named to my husband that it was comforting to think that how the poor boy would be benefited by John’s own money, and protected from John Harmon’s own forlornness.’  ‘Hear, hear!’ cried Mrs Boffin. ‘So Mrs Boffin did. Ancoar!’  ‘No, not Ancoar, Noddy, my dear,’ returned Mrs Boffin, ‘because I am going to say something else. I meant that, I am sure, as much as I still mean it. But this little death has made me ask myself the question, seriously, whether I wasn’t too bent upon pleasing myself. Else why did I seek out so much for a pretty child, and a child quite to my liking? Wanting to do good, why not do it for it own sake, and put my tastes and likings by?’  ‘Perhaps,’ said Mrs Boffin; and perhaps Mrs Boffin said it with some little sensitiveness arising out of those old curious relations of hers towards the murdered man; ‘perhaps, in reviving the name, you would not have liked to give the name to a less interesting child than the original. a less interesting child than the original interested you very much.’  ‘Well, my dear,’ returned Mrs Boffin, giving Mrs Boffin a squeeze, ‘it’s kind of you to find that reason out, and I hope that reason may have been so, and indeed to a certain extent I believe it was so, but I am afraid not to the whole extent. However, that don’t come in question now, because we have done with the name.’  ‘Laid Laid up as a remembrance,’ suggested Bella, musingly.  ‘Much better said, my dear; laid Laid up as a remembrance. Well then; I have been thinking if I take any orphan to provide for, let it not be a pet and a plaything for me, but a creature to be helped for a creature .’  ‘Not pretty then?’ said Mrs Boffin.  ‘No,’ returned Mrs Boffin, stoutly.  ‘Nor prepossessing then?’ said Mrs Boffin.  ‘No,’ returned Mrs Boffin. ‘Not necessarily so. That’s as it may happen. A well-disposed boy comes in my way who may be even a little wanting in such advantages for getting on in life, but is honest and industrious and requires a helping hand and deserves it. If I am very much in earnest and quite determined to be unselfish, let me take care of HIM.’  Here the footman whose feelings had been hurt on the former occasion, appeared, and crossing to Mr Rokesmith apologetically announced the objectionable Sloppy.  The four members of Council looked at one another, and paused. ‘Shall A well-disposed boy be brought here, ma’am?’ asked Mr Rokesmith.  ‘Yes,’ said Mrs Boffin. Whereupon Here the footman whose feelings had been hurt on the former occasion disappeared, reappeared presenting Sloppy, and retired much disgusted.  The consideration of Mrs Boffin had clothed Mr Sloppy in a suit of black, on which the tailor had received personal directions from Mr Rokesmith to expend the utmost cunning of Mr Rokesmith art, with a view to the concealment of the cohering and sustaining buttons. But, so much more powerful were the frailties of Sloppy’s form than the strongest resources of tailoring science, that he now stood before the Council, a perfect Argus in the way of buttons: shining and winking and gleaming and twinkling out of a hundred of those eyes of bright metal, at the dazzled spectators. The artistic taste of some unknown hatter had furnished him with a hatband of wholesale capacity which was fluted behind, from the crown of him hat to the brim, and terminated in a black bunch, from which the imagination shrunk discomfited and the reason revolted. Some special powers with which him legs were endowed, had already hitched up him glossy trousers at the ankles, and bagged his glossy trousers at the knees; while similar gifts in him arms had raised him coat-sleeves from him wrists and accumulated his glossy trousers at him elbows. Thus set forth, with the additional embellishments of a very little tail to him coat, and a yawning gulf at him waistband, Sloppy stood confessed.  ‘And how is Betty, my good fellow?’ Mrs Boffin asked Mrs Boffin.  ‘Thankee, mum,’ said Sloppy, ‘mum do pretty nicely, and sending mum dooty and many thanks for the tea and all faviours and wishing to know the family’s healths.’  ‘Have you just come, Sloppy?’  ‘Yes, mum.’  ‘Then you have not had your dinner yet?’  ‘No, mum. But I mean to it. For I ain’t forgotten your handsome orders that I was never to go away without having had a good ‘un off of meat and beer and pudding--no: there was four of ‘em, for I reckoned ‘em up when I had ‘em; meat one, beer two, vegetables three, and which was four?--Why, pudding, HE was four!’ Here Sloppy threw HE back, opened HE mouth wide, and laughed rapturously.  ‘How are the two poor little Minders?’ asked Mrs Boffin.  ‘Striking right out, mum, and coming round beautiful.’  Mrs Boffin looked on the other three members of Council, and then said, beckoning with Mrs Boffin finger:  ‘Sloppy.’  ‘Yes, mum.’  ‘Come forward, Sloppy. Should you like to dine here every day?’  ‘Off of all four on ‘em, mum? O mum!’ Sloppy’s feelings obliged Mrs Boffin to squeeze Mrs Boffin hat, and contract one leg at the knee.  ‘Yes. And should you like to be always taken care of here, if you were industrious and deserving?’  ‘Oh, mum!--But there’s Mrs Higden,’ said Sloppy, checking Mrs Higden in Mrs Higden raptures, drawing back, and shaking Mrs Higden with very serious meaning. ‘’s Mrs Higden. Mrs Higden goes before all. None can ever be better friends to me than ’s Mrs Higden been. And Mrs Higden must be turned for, must Mrs Higden. Where would Mrs Higden be if Mrs Higden warn’t turned for!’ At the mere thought of Mrs Higden in this inconceivable affliction, ’s Mrs Higden countenance became pale, and manifested the most distressful emotions.  ‘You are as right as right can be, Sloppy,’ said Mrs Boffin ‘and far be it from me to tell you otherwise. it shall be seen to. If Mrs Higden can be turned for all the same, you shall come here and be taken care of for life, and be made able to keep Mrs Higden in other ways than the turning.’  ‘Even as to that, mum,’ answered the ecstatic Sloppy, ‘the turning might be done in the night, don’t you see? I could be here in the day, and turn in the night. I don’t want no sleep, I don’t. Or even if I any ways should want a wink or two,’ added Sloppy, after a moment’s apologetic reflection, ‘I could take ‘em turning. I’ve took ‘em turning many a time, and enjoyed ‘em wonderful!’  On the grateful impulse of the moment, Mr Sloppy kissed Mrs Boffin’s hand, and then detaching Mrs Boffin’s from that good creature that Mrs Boffin’s might have room enough for Mrs Boffin’s feelings, threw back Mrs Boffin’s head, opened Mrs Boffin’s wide, and uttered a dismal howl. It was creditable to Mrs Boffin’s tenderness of heart, but suggested that Mrs Boffin’s might on occasion give some offence to the neighbours: the rather, as Here the footman whose feelings had been hurt on the former occasion looked in, and begged pardon, finding Here the footman whose feelings had been hurt on the former occasion was not wanted, but excused Here the footman whose feelings had been hurt on the former occasion; on the ground ‘that Here the footman whose feelings had been hurt on the former occasion thought it was Cats.’
