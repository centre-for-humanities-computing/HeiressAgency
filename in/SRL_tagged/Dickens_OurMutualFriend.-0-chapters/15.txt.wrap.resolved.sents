 TWO NEW SERVANTS   Mr and Mrs Boffin sat after breakfast, in the Bower, a prey to prosperity.
Mrs Boffin face denoted Care and Complication.
Many disordered papers were before Mrs Boffin, and Mrs Boffin looked at Many disordered papers about as hopefully as an innocent civilian might look at a crowd of troops whom Mrs Boffin was required at five minutes’ notice to manoeuvre and review.
Mrs Boffin had been engaged in some attempts to make notes of Many disordered papers; but being troubled (as men of Mrs Boffin stamp often are) with an exceedingly distrustful and corrective thumb, that busy member had so often interposed to smear Mrs Boffin notes, that they were little more legible than the various impressions of itself; which blurred Mrs Boffin nose and forehead.
It is curious to consider, in such a case as Mr Boffin’s, what a cheap article ink is, and how far it may be made to go.
As a grain of musk will scent a drawer for many years, and still lose nothing appreciable of its original weight, so a halfpenny-worth of ink would blot Mr Boffin to the roots of Mr Boffin hair and the calves of Mr Boffin legs, without inscribing a line on the paper before Mr Boffin, or appearing to diminish in the inkstand.
Mr Boffin was in such severe literary difficulties that Mr Boffin eyes were prominent and fixed, and Mr Boffin breathing was stertorous, when, to the great relief of Mrs Boffin, who observed these symptoms with alarm, the yard bell rang.
‘Who’s that, I wonder!’ said Mr Boffin.
Mr Boffin drew a long breath, laid down Mr Boffin pen, looked at Mr Boffin notes as doubting whether Mr Boffin had the pleasure of their acquaintance, and appeared, on a second perusal of their countenances, to be confirmed in Mr Boffin impression that Mr Boffin had not, when there was announced by the hammer-headed young man:  ‘Mr Rokesmith.’  ‘Oh!’ said Mr Boffin.
‘Oh indeed!
Our and the Wilfers’ Mutual Friend, my dear.
Yes.
Ask the hammer-headed young man to come in.’  Mr Rokesmith appeared.
‘Sit down, sir,’ said Mr Boffin, shaking hands with sir.
‘Mr Boffin’re already acquainted with.
Well, sir, I am rather unprepared to see you, for, to tell you the truth, I’ve been so busy with one thing and another, that I’ve not had time to turn your offer over.’  ‘That’s apology for both of us: for Mr Boffin, and for me as well,’ said Mr BoffinMr Boffin.
‘But Lor!
us can talk it over now; can’t us?’  Mr Rokesmith bowed, thanked Mr Rokesmith, and said Mr Rokesmith hoped so.
‘Let me see then,’ resumed Mr Boffin, with Mr Rokesmith hand to Mr Rokesmith chin.
‘It was Secretary that you named; wasn’t It?’  ‘I said Secretary,’ assented Mr Rokesmith.
‘It rather puzzled me at the time,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘and It rather puzzled me and Mr Boffin when we spoke of It afterwards, because (not to make a mystery of we belief) we have always believed Secretary to be a piece of furniture, mostly of mahogany, lined with green baize or leather, with a lot of little drawers in it.
Now, you won’t think I take a liberty when I mention that you certainly ain’t THAT.’  Certainly not, said Mr Rokesmith.
But Mr Rokesmith had used the word in the sense of Steward.
‘Why, as to Steward, you see,’ returned Mr Boffin, with Steward still to Steward , ‘the odds are that Mr Boffin and me may never go upon the water.
Being both bad sailors, we should want Steward Steward if we did; but there’s generally one provided.’  Mr Rokesmith again explained; defining the duties Mr Rokesmith sought to undertake, as those of general superintendent, or manager, or overlooker, or man of business.
‘Now, for instance--come!’ said Mr Boffin, in Mr Boffin pouncing way.
‘If you entered my employment, what would you do?’  ‘I would keep exact accounts of all the expenditure you sanctioned, Mr Boffin.
I would write your letters, under your direction.
I would transact your business with people in your pay or employment.
I would,’ with a glance and a half-smile at the table, ‘arrange your papers--’  Mr Boffin rubbed Mr Boffin inky ear, and looked at Mr Boffin wife.
‘--And so arrange them as to have them always in order for immediate reference, with a note of the contents of each outside it.’  ‘I tell you what,’ said Mr Boffin, slowly crumpling Mr Boffin own blotted note in Mr Boffin hand; ‘if you’ll turn to at these present papers, and see what you can make of ‘em, I shall know better what I can make of em.’  No sooner said than done.
Relinquishing his hat and gloves, Mr Boffin sat down quietly at the table, arranged the open papers into an orderly heap, cast Mr Boffin eyes over each in succession, folded his eyes, docketed his eyes on the outside, laid his eyes in a second heap, and, when an orderly heap was complete and the first gone, took from Mr Boffin pocket a piece of string and tied a piece of string together with a remarkably dexterous hand at a running curve and a loop.
‘Good!’ said Mr Boffin.
‘Very good!
Now let us hear what they’re all about; will you be so good?’  Mr Boffin read Mr Boffin abstracts aloud.
they were all about the new house.
Decorator’s estimate, so much.
Furniture estimate, so much.
Estimate for furniture of offices, so much.
Coach-maker’s estimate, so much.
Horse-dealer’s estimate, so much.
Harness-maker’s estimate, so much.
Decorator’s estimate, so much.
Total, so very much.
Then came correspondence.
Acceptance of Decorator’s offer of such a date, and to such an effect.
Rejection of Mr Boffin’s proposal of such a date and to such an effect.
Concerning Decorator’s scheme of such another date to such another effect.
All compact and methodical.
‘Apple-pie order!’ said Mr Boffin, after checking off each inscription with Mr Boffin hand, like a man beating time.
‘And whatever you do with your ink, I can’t think, for you’re as clean as a whistle after your ink.
Now, as to a letter.
Let’s,’ said Mr Boffin, rubbing Mr Boffin hands in Mr Boffin pleasantly childish admiration, ‘let’s try a letter next.’  ‘To whom shall a letter be addressed, Mr Boffin?’  ‘Anyone.
Yourself.’  Mr Boffin quickly wrote, and then read aloud:  ‘“Mr Boffin presents Mr Boffin compliments to Mr Boffin, and begs to say that Mr Boffin has decided on giving Mr Boffin a trial in the capacity Mr Boffin desires to fill.
Mr Boffin takes Mr Boffin at Mr Boffin word, in postponing to some indefinite period, the consideration of salary.
It is quite understood that Mr Boffin is in no way committed on that point.
Mr Boffin has merely to add, that Mr Boffin relies on Mr Boffin assurance that Mr Boffin will be faithful and serviceable.
Mr Boffin Mr Boffin will please enter on Mr Boffin duties immediately.”’  ‘Well!
Now, Noddy!’ cried Mr Boffin, clapping Mr Boffin hands, ‘That IS a good one!’  Mr Boffin was no less delighted; indeed, in Mr Boffin own bosom, Mr Boffin regarded both the composition itself and the device that had given birth to it, as a very remarkable monument of human ingenuity.
‘And I tell you, my deary,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘that if you don’t close with Mr Boffin now at once, and if you ever go a muddling yourself again with things never meant nor made for yourself, you’ll have an apoplexy--besides iron-moulding your linen--and you’ll break my heart.’  Mr Boffin embraced Mr Boffin spouse for these words of wisdom, and then, congratulating Mr Boffin on the brilliancy of Mr Boffin achievements, gave Mr Boffin Mr Boffin hand in pledge of their new relations.
So did Mr Boffin.
‘Now,’ said Mr Boffin, who, in Mr Boffin frankness, felt that it did not become Mr Boffin to have a gentleman in Mr Boffin employment five minutes, without reposing some confidence in Mr Boffin, ‘you must be let a little more into our affairs, Mr Boffin.
I mentioned to yourself, when I made your acquaintance, or I might better say when you made mine, that Mrs Boffin’s inclinations was setting in the way of Fashion, but that I didn’t know how fashionable we might or might not grow.
Well!
Mr Boffin has carried the day, and we’re going in neck and crop for Fashion.’  ‘I rather inferred that, sir,’ replied John Rokesmith, ‘from the scale on which your new establishment is to be maintained.’  ‘Yes,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘it’s to be a Spanker.
The fact is, my literary man named to me that a house with which my literary man named to me is, as I may say, connected--in which my literary man named to me has an interest--’  ‘As property?’ inquired Mr Boffin.
‘Why no,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘not exactly that; a sort of a family tie.’  ‘Association?’ the Secretary suggested.
‘Ah!’ said Mr Boffin.
‘Perhaps.
Anyhow, Mr Boffin named to me that the house had a board up, “This Eminently Aristocratic Mansion to be let or sold.”  Me and Mr Boffin went to look at it, and finding it beyond a doubt Eminently Aristocratic (though a trifle high and dull, which after all may be part of the same thing) took it.
My literary man was so friendly as to drop into a charming piece of poetry on that occasion, in which My literary man complimented Mr Boffin on coming into possession of--how did it go, my dear?’  Mr Boffin replied:       ‘“The gay, the gay and festive scene,      The halls, the halls of dazzling light.”’  ‘That’s it!
And it was made neater by there really being two halls in the house, a front ‘un and a back ‘un, besides the servants’.
My literary man likewise dropped into a very pretty piece of poetry to be sure, respecting the extent to which My literary man would be willing to put My literary man out of the way to bring Mr Boffin round, in case Mr Boffin should ever get low in Mr Boffin spirits in the house.
Mr Boffin has a wonderful memory.
Will you repeat it, my dear?’  Mr Boffin complied, by reciting the verses in which this obliging offer had been made, exactly as Mr Boffin had received this obliging offer.
‘“I’ll tell thee how the maiden wept, Mr Boffin,      When Mr Boffin true love was slain ma’am,      And how Mr Boffin broken spirit slept, Mr Boffin,      And never woke again ma’am.
I’ll tell thee (if agreeable to Mr Boffin) how the steed drew      nigh,      And left his lord afar;      And if my tale (which I hope Mr Boffin might excuse) should      make you sigh,      I’ll strike the light guitar.”’  ‘Correct to the letter!’ said Mr Boffin.
‘And I consider that the poetry brings us both in, in a beautiful manner.’  The effect of the poem on the Secretary being evidently to astonish him, Mr Boffin was confirmed in Mr Boffin high opinion of Mr Boffin, and was greatly pleased.
‘Now, you see, Mr Boffin,’ Mr Boffin went on, ‘a literary man--WITH a wooden leg--is liable to jealousy.
I shall therefore cast about for comfortable ways and means of not calling up Wegg’s jealousy, but of keeping you in your department, and keeping Mr Boffin in Mr Boffin.’  ‘Lor!’ cried Mr Boffin.
‘What I say is, the world’s wide enough for all of us!’  ‘So it is, my dear,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘when not literary.
But when so, not so.
And I am bound to bear in mind that I took Wegg on, at a time when I had no thought of being fashionable or of leaving the Bower.
To let him feel him anyways slighted now, would be to be guilty of a meanness, and to act like having one’s head turned by the halls of dazzling light.
Which Lord forbid!
Mr Boffin, what shall we say about your living in the house?’  ‘In the house?’  ‘No, no.
I have got other plans for the house.
In the new house?’  ‘That will be as you please, Mr Boffin.
I hold Mr Boffin quite at your disposal.
You know where I live at present.’  ‘Well!’ said Mr Boffin, after considering the point; ‘suppose you keep as you are for the present, and we’ll decide by-and-by.
You’ll begin to take charge at once, of all that’s going on in the new house, will you?’  ‘Most willingly.
I will begin this very day.
Will you give me the address?’  Mr Boffin repeated it, and the Secretary wrote it down in Mr Boffin pocket-book.
Mr Boffin took the opportunity of Mr Boffin being so engaged, to get a better observation of Mr Boffin face than Mr Boffin had yet taken.
It impressed Mr Boffin in Mr Boffin favour, for Mr Boffin nodded aside to Mr Boffin, ‘I like Mr Boffin.’  ‘I will see directly that everything is in train, Mr Boffin.’  ‘Thank’ee.
Being here, would you care at all to look round the Bower?’  ‘I should greatly like it.
I have heard so much of it story.’  ‘Come!’ said Mr Boffin.
And Mr Boffin and Mr Boffin led the way.
A gloomy house the Bower, with sordid signs on it of having been, through it long existence as Harmony Jail, in miserly holding.
Bare of paint, bare of paper on the walls, bare of furniture, bare of experience of human life.
Whatever is built by man for man’s occupation, must, like natural creations, fulfil the intention of natural creations existence, or soon perish.
This old house had wasted--more from desuetude than This old house would have wasted from use, twenty years for one.
A certain leanness falls upon houses not sufficiently imbued with life (as if houses were nourished upon A certain leanness), which was very noticeable here.
The staircase, balustrades, and rails, had a spare look--an air of being denuded to the bone--which the panels of the walls and the jambs of the doors and windows also bore.
The scanty moveables partook of it; save for the cleanliness of the place, the dust--into which they were all resolving would have lain thick on the floors; and those, both in colour and in grain, were worn like old faces that had kept much alone.
The bedroom where the clutching old man had lost the clutching old man grip on life, was left as the clutching old man had left it.
There was the old grisly four-post bedstead, without hangings, and with a jail-like upper rim of iron and spikes; and there was the old patch-work counterpane.
There was the tight-clenched old bureau, receding atop like a bad and secret forehead; there was the cumbersome old table with twisted legs, at the bed-side; and there was the box upon it, in which the will had lain.
A few old chairs with patch-work covers, under which the more precious stuff to be preserved had slowly lost its quality of colour without imparting pleasure to any eye, stood against the wall.
A hard family likeness was on all these things.
‘The room was kept like this, Mr Boffin,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘against the son’s return.
In short, everything in This old house was kept exactly as everything in the house came to us, for him to see and approve.
Even now, nothing is changed but us own room below-stairs that you have just left.
When the son’s came home for the last time in the son’s life, and for the last time in his life saw the son’s father, it was most likely in The room that they met.’  As the Secretary looked all round it, the Secretary eyes rested on a side door in a corner.
‘Another staircase,’ said Mr Boffin, unlocking a side door in a corner, ‘leading down into the yard.
us’ll go down this way, as you may like to see the yard, and the yard’s all in the road.
When the son’s was a little child, it was up and down these stairs that the son’s mostly came and went to his father.
the son’s was very timid of his father.
I’ve seen the son’s sit on these stairs, in the son’s shy way, poor child, many a time.
Mr and Mr Boffin have comforted the son’s, sitting with the son’s little book on these stairs, often.’  ‘Ah!
And the son’s poor sister too,’ said Mr Boffin.
‘And here’s the sunny place on the white wall where they one day measured one another.
they own little hands wrote up they names here, only with a pencil; but their names are here still, and the poor dears gone for ever.’  ‘We must take care of the names, old lady,’ said Mr Boffin.
‘We must take care of the names.
the names shan’t be rubbed out in We time, nor yet, if We can help it, in the time after We.
Poor little children!’  ‘Ah, poor little children!’ said Mr Boffin.
poor little children had opened the door at the bottom of the staircase giving on the yard, and poor little children stood in the sunlight, looking at the scrawl of the two unsteady childish hands two or three steps up the staircase.
There was something in this simple memento of a blighted childhood, and in the tenderness of Mr Boffin, that touched the Secretary.
Mr Boffin then showed Mr Boffin new man of business the Mounds, and Mr Boffin own particular Mound which had been left Mr Boffin as Mr Boffin legacy under the will before Mr Boffin acquired the whole estate.
‘It would have been enough for We,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘in case It had pleased God to spare the last of those two young lives and sorrowful deaths.
We didn’t want the rest.’  At the treasures of the yard, and at the outside of This old house, and at the detached building which Mr Boffin pointed out as the residence of Mr Boffin and Mr Boffin wife during the many years of himself and his wife service, the Secretary looked with interest.
It was not until Mr Boffin had shown Mr Boffin every wonder of the Bower twice over, that Mr Boffin remembered Mr Boffin having duties to discharge elsewhere.
‘You have no instructions to give me, Mr Boffin, in reference to this place?’  ‘Not any, Rokesmith.
No.’  ‘Might I ask, without seeming impertinent, whether you have any intention of selling it?’  ‘Certainly not.
In remembrance of our old master, our old master’s children, and our old service, me and Mr Boffin mean to keep it up as it stands.’  The Secretary’s eyes glanced with so much meaning in THEM at the Mounds, that Mr Boffin said, as if in answer to a remark:  ‘Ay, ay, that’s another thing.
I may sell THEM, though I should be sorry to see the neighbourhood deprived of ‘em too.
It’ll look but a poor dead flat without the Mounds.
Still I don’t say that I’m going to keep ‘em always there, for the sake of the beauty of the landscape.
There’s no hurry about it; that’s all I say at present.
I ain’t a scholar in much, Mr Boffin, but I’m a pretty fair scholar in dust.
I can price the Mounds to a fraction, and I know how the Mounds can be best disposed of; and likewise that the Mounds take no harm by standing where the Mounds do.
You’ll look in to-morrow, will you be so kind?’  ‘Every day.
And the sooner I can get you into your new house, complete, the better you will be pleased, sir?’  ‘Well, it ain’t that I’m in a mortal hurry,’ said Mr Boffin; ‘only when you DO pay people for looking alive, it’s as well to know that people ARE looking alive.
Ain’t that your opinion?’  ‘Quite!’ replied the Secretary; and so withdrew.
‘Now,’ said Mr Boffin to Mr Boffin; subsiding into Mr Boffin regular series of turns in the yard, ‘if I can make it comfortable with Wegg, my affairs will be going smooth.’  The man of low cunning had, of course, acquired a mastery over the man of high simplicity.
The man of low cunning had, of course, got the better of The man of low cunning.
How long such conquests last, is another matter; that such conquests are achieved, is every-day experience, not even to be flourished away by Podsnappery itself.
Mr Boffin had become so far immeshed by Wegg that Mr Boffin mind misgave Mr Boffin Mr Boffin was a very designing man indeed in purposing to do more for Wegg.
It seemed to Mr Boffin (so skilful was Wegg) that Mr Boffin was plotting darkly, when Mr Boffin was contriving to do the very thing that Wegg was plotting to get Mr Boffin to do.
And thus, while Mr Boffin was mentally turning the kindest of kind faces on Wegg this morning, Mr Boffin was not absolutely sure but that Mr Boffin might somehow deserve the charge of turning Mr Boffin back on Mr Boffin.
For these reasons Mr Boffin passed but anxious hours until evening came, and with it Mr Wegg, stumping leisurely to the Roman Empire.
At about this period Mr Boffin had become profoundly interested in the fortunes of a great military leader known to Mr Boffin as Bully Sawyers, but perhaps better known to fame and easier of identification by the classical student, under the less Britannic name of Belisarius.
Even this general’s career paled in interest for Mr Boffin before the clearing of Mr Boffin conscience with Wegg; and hence, when that literary gentleman had according to custom eaten and drunk until Mr Boffin was all a-glow, and when Mr Boffin took up his pocket-book with the usual chirping introduction, ‘And now, Mr Boffin, sir, we’ll decline and we’ll fall!’ Mr Boffin stopped Mr Boffin.
‘You remember, Wegg, when I first told you that I wanted to make a sort of offer to you?’  ‘Let me get on my considering cap, sir,’ replied that gentleman, turning his pocket-book face downward.
‘When you first told me that you wanted to make a sort of offer to me?
Now let me think.’ (as if there were the least necessity) ‘Yes, to be sure I do, Mr Boffin.
It was at my corner.
To be sure It was!
You had first asked me whether I liked your name, and Candour had compelled a reply in the negative case.
I little thought then, sir, how familiar your name would come to be!’  ‘I hope it will be more familiar still, Wegg.’  ‘Do you, Mr Boffin?
Much obliged to you, I’m sure.
Is it your pleasure, sir, that we decline and we fall?’ with a feint of taking up his pocket-book.
‘Not just yet awhile, Wegg.
In fact, I have got another offer to make you.’  Mr Wegg (who had had nothing else in Mr Wegg (who had had nothing else in his mind for several nights) mind for several nights) took off Mr Wegg (who had had nothing else in his mind for several nights) spectacles with an air of bland surprise.
‘And I hope you’ll like it, Wegg.’  ‘Thank you, sir,’ returned that reticent individual.
‘I hope it may prove so.
On all accounts, I am sure.’ (This, as a philanthropic aspiration.)
‘What do you think,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘of not keeping a stall, Wegg?’  ‘I think, sir,’ replied Wegg, ‘that I should like to be shown the gentleman prepared to make it worth my while!’  ‘Here the gentleman is,’ said Mr Boffin.
Wegg was going to say, My Benefactor, and had said My Bene, when a grandiloquent change came over Wegg.
‘No, Mr Boffin, not you sir.
Anybody but you.
Do not fear, Mr Boffin, that I shall contaminate the premises which your gold has bought, with MY lowly pursuits.
I am aware, sir, that it would not become me to carry on my little traffic under the windows of your mansion.
I have already thought of that, and taken my measures.
No need to be bought out, sir.
Would Stepney Fields be considered intrusive?
If not remote enough, I can go remoter.
In the words of the poet’s song, which I do not quite remember:       Thrown on the wide world, doom’d to wander and roam,      Bereft of my parents, bereft of a home,      A stranger to something and what’s his name joy,      Behold little Edmund the poor Peasant boy.
--And equally,’ said Mr Wegg, repairing the want of direct application in the last line, ‘behold myself on a similar footing!’  ‘Now, Wegg, Wegg, Wegg,’ remonstrated Mr Boffin.
‘You are too sensitive.’  ‘I know I am, sir,’ returned Wegg, with obstinate magnanimity.
‘I am acquainted with my faults.
I always was, from a child, too sensitive.’  ‘But listen,’ pursued the Golden Dustman; ‘hear me out, Wegg.
You have taken my faults into your head that I mean to pension you off.’  ‘True, sir,’ returned Wegg, still with an obstinate magnanimity.
‘I am acquainted with my faults.
Far be it from myself to deny them.
I HAVE taken it into your head.’  ‘But I DON’T mean it.’  The assurance seemed hardly as comforting to Wegg, as Mr Boffin intended it to be.
Indeed, an appreciable elongation of Mr Boffin visage might have been observed as Mr Boffin replied:  ‘Don’t you, indeed, sir?’  ‘No,’ pursued Mr Boffin; ‘because that would express, as I understand it, that you were not going to do anything to deserve your money.
But you are; you are.’  ‘That, sir,’ replied Wegg, cheering up bravely, ‘is quite another pair of shoes.
Now, my independence as a man is again elevated.
Now, I no longer       Weep for the hour,      When to Boffinses bower,      The Lord of the valley with offers came;      Neither does the moon hide The Lord of the valley with offers light      From the heavens to-night,      And weep behind The Lord of the valley with offers clouds o’er any individual in the present      Company’s shame.
--Please to proceed, Mr Boffin.’  ‘Thank’ee, Wegg, both for your confidence in me and for your frequent dropping into poetry; both of which is friendly.
Well, then; my idea is, that you should give up your stall, and that I should put you into the Bower here, to keep it for us.
it’s a pleasant spot; and a man with coals and candles and a pound a week might be in clover here.’  ‘Hem!
Would that man, sir--we will say that man, sir, for the purposes of argueyment;’ Mr Wegg made a smiling demonstration of great perspicuity here; ‘would that man, sir, be expected to throw any other capacity in, or would any other capacity be considered extra?
Now let us (for the purposes of argueyment) suppose that man to be engaged as a reader: say (for the purposes of argueyment) in the evening.
Would that man’s pay as a reader in the evening, be added to the other amount, which, adopting your language, we will call clover; or would it merge into that amount, or clover?’  ‘Well,’ said Mr Boffin, ‘I suppose it would be added.’  ‘I suppose it would, sir.
You are right, sir.
Exactly my own views, Mr Boffin.’ Here Wegg rose, and balancing sir on sir wooden leg, fluttered over sir prey with extended hand.
‘Mr Boffin, consider it done.
Say no more, sir, not a word more.
My stall and I are for ever parted.
The collection of ballads will in future be reserved for private study, with the object of making poetry tributary’--Wegg was so proud of having found this word, that he said this word again, with a capital letter--‘Tributary, to friendship.
Mr Boffin, don’t allow yourself to be made uncomfortable by the pang this word gives me to part from my stock and stall.
Similar emotion was undergone by my own father when promoted for my own father merits from my own father occupation as a waterman to a situation under Government.
my own father Christian name was Thomas.
my own father words at the time (I was then an infant, but so deep was their impression on me, that I committed their to memory) were:       Then farewell my trim-built wherry,      Oars and coat and badge farewell!
Never more at Chelsea Ferry,      Shall your Thomas take a spell!
--My father got over it, Mr Boffin, and so shall I.’  While delivering these valedictory observations, Wegg continually disappointed Mr Boffin of Wegg hand by flourishing it in the air.
Wegg now darted it at Wegg patron, who took it, and felt Wegg mind relieved of a great weight: observing that as they had arranged they joint affairs so satisfactorily, Wegg would now be glad to look into those of Bully Sawyers.
Which, indeed, had been left over-night in a very unpromising posture, and for whose impending expedition against the Persians the weather had been by no means favourable all day.
Wegg resumed Wegg spectacles therefore.
But Sawyers was not to be of the party that night; for, before Wegg had found Wegg place, Mr Boffin tread was heard upon the stairs, so unusually heavy and hurried, that Mr Boffin would have started up at the sound, anticipating some occurrence much out of the common course, even though Mr Boffin had not also called to Mr Boffin in an agitated tone.
Mr Boffin hurried out, and found Mr Boffin on the dark staircase, panting, with a lighted candle in Mr Boffin hand.
‘What’s the matter, my dear?’  ‘I don’t know; I don’t know; but I wish you’d come up-stairs.’  Much surprised, Mr Boffin went up stairs and accompanied Mr Boffin into their own room: a second large room on the same floor as the room in which the late proprietor had died.
Mr Boffin looked all round Mr Boffin, and saw nothing more unusual than various articles of folded linen on a large chest, which Mr Boffin had been sorting.
‘What is it, my dear?
Why, you’re frightened!
YOU frightened?’  ‘I am not one of that sort certainly,’ said Mr Boffin, as Mr Boffin sat down in a chair to recover Mr Boffin, and took Mr Boffin husband’s arm; ‘but it’s very strange!’  ‘What is, my dear?’  ‘Noddy, the faces of the old man and the two children are all over the house to-night.’  ‘My dear?’ exclaimed Mr Boffin.
But not without a certain uncomfortable sensation gliding down Mr Boffin back.
‘I know it must sound foolish, and yet it is so.’  ‘Where did you think you saw them?’  ‘I don’t know that I think I saw them anywhere.
I felt them.’  ‘Touched them?’  ‘No.
Felt them in the air.
I was sorting those things on the chest, and not thinking of the old man or the children, but singing to myself, when all in a moment I felt there was a face growing out of the dark.’  ‘a face growing out of the dark?’ asked her husband, looking about her husband.
‘For a moment it was the old man’s, and then it got younger.
For a moment it was both the children’s, and then it got older.
For a moment it was a strange face, and then it was all the faces.’  ‘And then it was gone?’  ‘Yes; and then it was gone.’  ‘Where were you then, old lady?’  ‘Here, at the chest.
Well; I got the better of the chest, and went on sorting, and went on singing to myself.
“Lor!” I says, “I’ll think of something else--something comfortable--and put the chest out of your head.” So I thought of the new house and Miss Bella Wilfer, and was thinking at a great rate with that sheet there in my hand, when all of a sudden, all the faces seemed to be hidden in among the folds of all the faces and I let all the faces drop.’  As all the faces still lay on the floor where all the faces had fallen, Mr Boffin picked all the faces up and laid all the faces on the chest.
‘And then you ran down stairs?’  ‘No.
I thought I’d try another room, and shake another room off.
I says to Mr Boffin, “I’ll go and walk slowly up and down the old man’s room three times, from end to end, and then I shall have conquered it.” I went in with the candle in my hand; but the moment I came near the bed, the air got thick with them.’  ‘With the faces?’  ‘Yes, and I even felt that them were in the dark behind the side-door, and on the little staircase, floating away into the yard.
Then, I called you.’  Mr Boffin, lost in amazement, looked at Mr Boffin.
Mr Boffin, lost in Mr Boffin own fluttered inability to make this out, looked at Mr Boffin.
‘I think, my dear,’ said the Golden Dustman, ‘I’ll at once get rid of Wegg for the night, because he’s coming to inhabit the Bower here, and the Bower here might be put into he’s head or somebody else’s, if he’s heard this and it got about that the house is haunted.
Whereas we know better.
Don’t we?’  ‘I never had the feeling in the house before,’ said Mr Boffin; ‘and I have been about it alone at all hours of the night.
I have been in the house when Death was in the house, and I have been in the house when Murder was a new part of the house adventures, and I never had a fright in the house yet.’  ‘And won’t again, my dear,’ said Mr Boffin.
‘Depend upon the house, the house comes of thinking and dwelling on that dark spot.’  ‘Yes; but why didn’t the house come before?’ asked Mr Boffin.
This draft on Mr Boffin’s philosophy could only be met by that gentleman with the remark that everything that is at all, must begin at some time.
Then, tucking his wifehe’s arm under his own, that his wife might not be left by his wife to be troubled again, his descended to release Wegg.
Who, being something drowsy after his plentiful repast, and constitutionally of a shirking temperament, was well enough pleased to stump away, without doing what his had come to do, and was paid for doing.
Mr Boffin then put on his hat, and Mr Boffin Mr Boffin shawl; and the pair, further provided with a bunch of keys and a lighted lantern, went all over the dismal house--dismal everywhere, but in Mrs Boffin her shawl; and the pair, further provided with a bunch of keys and a lighted lantern own two rooms--from cellar to cock-loft.
Not resting satisfied with giving that much chace to Mrs Boffin’s fancies, Mrs Boffin her shawl; and the pair, further provided with a bunch of keys and a lighted lantern pursued Mrs Boffin her shawl; and the pair, further provided with a bunch of keys and a lighted lantern into the yard and outbuildings, and under the Mounds.
And setting the lantern, when all was done, at the foot of one of the Mounds, Mrs Boffin her shawl; and the pair, further provided with a bunch of keys and a lighted lantern comfortably trotted to and fro for an evening walk, to the end that the murky cobwebs in Mrs Boffin’s brain might be blown away.
‘There, my dear!’ said Mr Boffin when they came in to supper.
‘That was the treatment, you see.
Completely worked round, haven’t you?’  ‘Yes, deary,’ said Mrs Boffin, laying aside Mrs Boffin shawl.
‘I’m not nervous any more.
I’m not a bit troubled now.
I’d go anywhere about the house the same as ever.
But--’  ‘Eh!’ said Mr Boffin.
‘But I’ve only to shut my eyes.’  ‘And what then?’  ‘Why then,’ said Mr Boffin, speaking with my eyes closed, and Mr Boffin left hand thoughtfully touching Mr Boffin brow, ‘then, there they are!
The old man’s face, and it gets younger.
The two childrenhe’s faces, and they get older.
A face that I don’t know.
And then all the faces!’  Opening my eyes again, and seeing her husbandhe’s face across the table, Mr Boffin leaned forward to give face across the table a pat on the cheek, and sat down to supper, declaring face across the table to be the best face in the world.
