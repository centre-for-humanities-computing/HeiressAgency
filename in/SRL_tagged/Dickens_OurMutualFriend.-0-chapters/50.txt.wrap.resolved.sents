 THE FEAST OF THE THREE HOBGOBLINS   The City looked unpromising enough, as Bella made Bella way along The City gritty streets.
Most of The City money-mills were slackening sail, or had left off grinding for the day.
The master-millers had already departed, and the journeymen were departing.
There was a jaded aspect on the business lanes and courts, and the very pavements had a weary appearance, confused by the tread of a million of feet.
There must be hours of night to temper down the day’s distraction of so feverish a place.
As yet the worry of the newly-stopped whirling and grinding on the part of its money-mills seemed to linger in the air, and the quiet was more like the prostration of a spent giant than the repose of one who was renewing his strength.
If Bella thought, as Bella glanced at the mighty Bank, how agreeable it would be to have an hour’s gardening there, with a bright copper shovel, among the money, still Bella was not in an avaricious vein.
Much improved in that respect, and with certain half-formed images which had little gold in their composition, dancing before Bella bright eyes, Bella arrived in the drug-flavoured region of Mincing Lane, with the sensation of having just opened a drawer in a chemist’s shop.
The counting-house of Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles was pointed out by an elderly female accustomed to the care of offices, who dropped upon Bella out of a public-house, wiping Bella mouth, and accounted for her mouth humidity on natural principles well known to the physical sciences, by explaining that Bella had looked in at the door to see what o’clock it was.
The counting-house was a wall-eyed ground floor by a dark gateway, and Bella was considering, as Bella approached The counting-house, could there be any precedent in the City for Bella going in and asking for R. Wilfer, when whom should Bella see, sitting at one of the windows with the plate-glass sash raised, but R. Wilfer himself, preparing to take a slight refection.
On approaching nearer, Bella discerned that the refection had the appearance of a small cottage-loaf and a pennyworth of milk.
Simultaneously with this discovery on Bella part, Bella father discovered Bella, and invoked the echoes of Mincing Lane to exclaim ‘My gracious me!’  her father then came cherubically flying out without a hat, and embraced Bella, and handed Bella in.
‘For it’s after hours and I am all alone, my dear,’ her father explained, ‘and am having--as I sometimes do when they are all gone--a quiet tea.’  Looking round the office, as if her father were a captive and this her father cell, Bella hugged her father and choked her father to Bella heart’s content.
‘I never was so surprised, my dear!’ said her father.
‘I couldn’t believe my eyes.
Upon my life, I thought they had taken to lying!
The idea of your coming down the Lane yourself!
Why didn’t you send the footman down the Lane, my dear?’  ‘I have brought the footman with me, Pa.’  ‘Oh indeed!
But you have brought the elegant turn-out, my love?’  ‘No, Pa.’  ‘You never can have walked, my dear?’  ‘Yes, I have, Pa.’  Pa. looked so very much astonished, that Bella could not make up Bella mind to break it to Pa. just yet.
‘The consequence is, Pa, that your lovely woman feels a little faint, and would very much like to share your tea.’  The cottage loaf and the pennyworth of milk had been set forth on a sheet of paper on the window-seat.
The cherubic pocket-knife, with the first bit of the loaf still on the loaf point, lay beside The cherubic pocket-knife, with the first bit of the loaf still on its point where the loaf had been hastily thrown down.
Bella took the bit off, and put the loaf in Bella mouth.
‘My dear child,’ said Bella father, ‘the idea of your partaking of such lowly fare!
But at least you must have your own loaf and your own penn’orth.
One moment, my dear.
The Dairy is just over the way and round the corner.’  Regardless of Bella’s dissuasions he ran out, and quickly returned with the new supply.
‘My dear child,’ he said, as he spread it on another piece of paper before My dear child, ‘the idea of a splendid--!’ and then looked at My dear child figure, and stopped short.
‘What’s the matter, Pa?’  ‘--of a splendid female,’ he resumed more slowly, ‘putting up with such accommodation as the present!--Is that a new dress you have on, my dear?’  ‘No, Pa, an old one.
Don’t you remember it?’  ‘Why, I THOUGHT I remembered it, my dear!’  ‘You should, for you bought it, Pa.’  ‘Yes, I THOUGHT I bought it my dear!’ said the cherub, giving the cherub a little shake, as if to rouse the cherub faculties.
‘And have you grown so fickle that you don’t like your own taste, Pa dear?’  ‘Well, my love,’ the cherub returned, swallowing a bit of the cottage loaf with considerable effort, for it seemed to stick by the way: ‘I should have thought it was hardly sufficiently splendid for existing circumstances.’  ‘And so, Pa,’ said Bella, moving coaxingly to his side instead of remaining opposite, ‘you sometimes have a quiet tea here all alone?
I am not in the tea’s way, if I draw my arm over your shoulder like this, Pa?’  ‘Yes, my dear, and no, my dear.
Yes to the first question, and Certainly Not to the second.
Respecting the quiet tea, my dear, why you see the occupations of the day are sometimes a little wearing; and if there’s nothing interposed between the day and your mother, why your mother is sometimes a little wearing, too.’  ‘I know, Pa.’  ‘Yes, my dear.
So sometimes I put a quiet tea at the window here, with a little quiet contemplation of the Lane (which comes soothing), between the day, and domestic--’  ‘Bliss,’ suggested Bella, sorrowfully.
‘And BlissBliss,’ said Bliss father, quite contented to accept the phrase.
Bella kissed her father, quite contented to accept the phrase.
‘And it is in this dark dingy place of captivity, poor dear, that you pass all the hours of your life when you are not at home?’  ‘Not at home, or not on the road there, or on the road here, my love.
Yes.
You see that little desk in the corner?’  ‘In the dark corner, furthest both from the light and from the fireplace?
The shabbiest desk of all the desks?’  ‘Now, does it really strike you in that point of view, my dear?’ said her father, surveying it artistically with her father head on one side: ‘that’s mine.
’s ’s called Rumty’s Perch.’  ‘Whose Perch?’ asked Bella with great indignation.
‘’s.
You see, being rather high and up two steps two steps call it a Perch.
And two steps call Rumty.’  ‘How dare two steps!’ exclaimed Bella.
‘two steps’re playful, Bella my dear; two steps’re playful.
two steps’re more or less younger than I am, and two steps’re playful.
What does it matter?
it might be Surly, or Sulky, or fifty disagreeable things that I really shouldn’t like to be considered.
But Rumty!
Lor, why not Rumty?’  To inflict a heavy disappointment on this sweet nature, which had been, through all her caprices, the object of her recognition, love, and admiration from infancy, Bella felt to be the hardest task of Bella hard day.
‘I should have done better,’ Bella thought, ‘to tell him at first; I should have done better to tell him just now, when him had some slight misgiving; him is quite happy again, and I shall make him wretched.’  him was falling back on him loaf and milk, with the pleasantest composure, and Bella stealing Bella arm a little closer about him, and at the same time sticking up him hair with an irresistible propensity to play with him founded on the habit of Bella whole life, had prepared Bella to say: ‘Pa dear, don’t be cast down, but I must tell you something disagreeable!’ when him interrupted Bella in an unlooked-for manner.
‘My gracious me!’ him exclaimed, invoking the Mincing Lane echoes as before.
‘This is very extraordinary!’  ‘What is, Pa dear?’  ‘Why here’s Mr Rokesmith now!’  ‘No, no, Pa dear, no,’ cried Bella, greatly flurried.
‘Surely not.’  ‘Yes there is!
Look here!’  Sooth to say, Mr Rokesmith now not only passed the window, but came into the counting-house.
And not only came into the counting-house, but, finding Mr Rokesmith now alone there with Bella and Bella father, rushed at Bella and caught Bella in Mr Rokesmith now arms, with the rapturous words ‘Bella!’ And not only that even, (which one might have thought astonishment enough for one dose), but Bella, after hanging Bella head for a moment, lifted it up and laid it on Mr Rokesmith now breast, as if that were Bella head’s chosen and lasting resting-place!
‘I knew you would come to Mr Rokesmith now, and I followed you,’ said Mr Rokesmith now.
‘My love, my life!
You ARE mine?’  To which Bella responded, ‘Yes, I AM yours if you think me worth taking!’ And after that, seemed to shrink to next to nothing in the clasp of his arms, partly because it was such a strong one on his part, and partly because there was such a yielding to it on hers.
The cherub, whose hair would have done for whose hair under the influence of this amazing spectacle, what Bella had just now done for whose hair, staggered back into the window-seat from which he had risen, and surveyed the pair with he eyes dilated to the pair utmost.
‘But we must think of Pa,’ said Bella; ‘I haven’t told Pa; let we speak to Pa.’ Upon which they turned to do so.
‘I wish first, my dear,’ remarked the cherub faintly, ‘that you’d have the kindness to sprinkle me with a little milk, for I feel as if I was--Going.’  In fact, the good little fellow had become alarmingly limp, and the good little fellow senses seemed to be rapidly escaping, from the knees upward.
Bella sprinkled the good little fellow with kisses instead of milk, but gave the good little fellow a little of that article to drink; and the good little fellow gradually revived under Bella caressing care.
‘we’ll break it to you gently, Pa,’ said Bella.
‘my dear,’ returned the cherub, looking at them both, ‘you broke so much in the first--Gush, if I may so express you--that I think I am equal to a good large breakage now.’  ‘Mr Wilfer,’ said John Rokesmith, excitedly and joyfully, ‘Bella takes me, though I have no fortune, even no present occupation; nothing but what I can get in the life before we.
Bella takes me!’  ‘Yes, I should rather have inferred, my dear sir,’ returned the cherub feebly, ‘that Bella took you, from what I have within these few minutes remarked.’  ‘You don’t know, Pa,’ said Bella, ‘how ill I have used my dear sir!’  ‘You don’t know, my dear sir,’ said Rokesmith, ‘what a heart Bella has!’  ‘You don’t know, Pa,’ said Bella, ‘what a shocking creature I was growing, when my dear sir saved me from you!’  ‘You don’t know, my dear sir,’ said Rokesmith, ‘what a sacrifice Bella has made for you!’  ‘Bella,’ replied the cherub, still pathetically scared, ‘and my dear John Rokesmith, if you will allow me so to call you--’  ‘Yes do, Pa, do!’ urged Bella.
‘I allow you, and my will is my dear sir law.
Isn’t it--Mr Rokesmith now?’  There was an engaging shyness in Bella, coupled with an engaging tenderness of love and confidence and pride, in thus first calling him by name, which made it quite excusable in John Rokesmith to do what him did.
What him did was, once more to give Bella the appearance of vanishing as aforesaid.
‘I think, my dears,’ observed the cherub, ‘that if you could make it convenient to sit one on one side of me, and the other on the other, we should get on rather more consecutively, and make things rather plainer.
John Rokesmith mentioned, a while ago, that John Rokesmith had no present occupation.’  ‘None,’ said John Rokesmith.
‘No, Pa, none,’ said Bella.
‘From which I argue,’ proceeded the cherub, ‘that he has left Mr Boffin?’  ‘Yes, Pa. And so--’  ‘Stop a bit, my dear.
I wish to lead up to it by degrees.
And that Mr Boffin has not treated Mr Boffin well?’  ‘Has treated Mr Boffin most shamefully, Pa!’ cried Bella with a flashing face.
‘Of which,’ pursued the cherub, enjoining patience with Mr Boffin hand, ‘a certain mercenary young person distantly related to Mr Boffin, could not approve?
Am I leading up to it right?’  ‘Could not approve, Pa,’ said Bella, with a tearful laugh and a joyful kiss.
‘Upon which,’ pursued the cherub, ‘the certain mercenary young person distantly related to Mr Boffin, having previously observed and mentioned to Mr Boffin that prosperity was spoiling Mr Boffin, felt that Mr Boffin must not sell Mr Boffin sense of what was right and what was wrong, and what was true and what was false, and what was just and what was unjust, for any price that could be paid to Mr Boffin by any one alive?
Am I leading up to it right?’  With another tearful laugh Bella joyfully kissed Mr Boffin again.
‘And therefore--and therefore,’ the cherub went on in a glowing voice, as Bella’s hand stole gradually up Mr Boffin waistcoat to Mr Boffin neck, ‘this mercenary young person distantly related to Mr Boffin, refused the price, took off the splendid fashions that were part of the price, put on the comparatively poor dress that I had last given Mr Boffin, and trusting to my supporting Mr Boffin in what was right, came straight to me.
Have I led up to the price?’  Bella’s hand was round Bella’s neck by this time, and Bella’s face was on Bella’s hand.
‘The mercenary young person distantly related to Mr Boffin,’ said Bella’s good father, ‘did well!
The mercenary young person distantly related to Mr Boffin, did not trust to Mr Boffin in vain!
I admire this mercenary young person distantly related to Mr Boffin, more in this dress than if Bella’s had come to Mr Boffin in China silks, Cashmere shawls, and Golconda diamonds.
I love The mercenary young person dearly.
I say to the man of this young person’s heart, out of my heart and with all of it, “My blessing on this engagement betwixt you, and Bella’s brings you a good fortune when Bella’s brings you the poverty Bella’s has accepted for your sake and the honest truth’s!”’  The stanch little manBella’s voice failed The stanch little man as The stanch little man gave John Rokesmith The stanch little man hand, and The stanch little man was silent, bending The stanch little man low over The stanch little man daughter.
But, not for long.
The stanch little man soon looked up, saying in a sprightly tone:  ‘And now, my dear child, if you think you can entertain John Rokesmith for a minute and a half, I’ll run over to the Dairy, and fetch The stanch little man a cottage loaf and a drink of milk, that we may all have tea together.’  It was, as Bella gaily said, like the supper provided for the three nursery hobgoblins at their house in the forest, without their thunderous low growlings of the alarming discovery, ‘Somebody’s been drinking MY milk!’ It was a delicious repast; by far the most delicious that Bella, or John Rokesmith, or even R. Wilfer had ever made.
The uncongenial oddity of its surroundings, with the two brass knobs of the iron safe of Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles staring from a corner, like the eyes of some dull dragon, only made it the more delightful.
‘To think,’ said the cherub, looking round the office with unspeakable enjoyment, ‘that anything of a tender nature should come off here, is what tickles me.
To think that ever I should have seen Bella Bella folded in the arms of Bella future husband, HERE, you know!’  It was not until the cottage loaves and the milk had for some time disappeared, and the foreshadowings of night were creeping over the Mincing Lane, that the cherub by degrees became a little nervous, and said to Bella, as he cleared he throat:  ‘Hem!--Have you thought at all about your mother, my dear?’  ‘Yes, Pa.’  ‘And your sister Lavvy, for instance, my dear?’  ‘Yes, Pa.
I think we had better not enter into particulars at home.
I think it will be quite enough to say that I had a difference with Mr Boffin, and have left for good.’  ‘John Rokesmith being acquainted with your Ma, my love,’ said Ma , after some slight hesitation, ‘I need have no delicacy in hinting before her father that you may perhaps find your Ma a little wearing.’  ‘A little, patient Pa?’ said Bella with a tuneful laugh: the tune fuller for being so loving in its tone.
‘Well!
We’ll say, strictly in confidence among We, wearing; We won’t qualify it,’ the cherub by degrees stoutly admitted.
‘And your sister’s temper is wearing.’  ‘I don’t mind, Pa.’  ‘And you must prepare yourself you know, my precious,’ said her father, with much gentleness, ‘for we looking very poor and meagre at home, and being at the best but very uncomfortable, after Mr Boffin’s house.’  ‘I don’t mind, Pa.
I could bear much harder trials--for John.’  The closing words were not so softly and blushingly said but that John heard The closing words, and showed that John heard The closing words by again assisting Bella to another of those mysterious disappearances.
‘Well!’ said the cherub by degrees gaily, and not expressing disapproval, ‘when you--when you come back from retirement, my love, and reappear on the surface, I think it will be time to lock up and go.’  If the counting-house of Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles had ever been shut up by three happier people, glad as most people were to shut it up, most people must have been superlatively happy indeed.
But first Bella mounted upon Rumty’s Perch, and said, ‘Show me what you do here all day long, Pa. Do you write like this?’ laying Pa. round cheek upon Pa. plump left arm, and losing sight of Pa. pen in waves of hair, in a highly unbusiness-like manner.
Though John Rokesmith seemed to like John Rokesmith.
So, the three hobgoblins, having effaced all traces of the three hobgoblins feast, and swept up the crumbs, came out of the Mincing Lane to walk to Holloway; and if two of the three hobgoblins didn’t wish the distance twice as long as it was, the third hobgoblin was much mistaken.
Indeed, that modest spirit deemed the third hobgoblin so much in the way of their deep enjoyment of the journey, that the third hobgoblin apologetically remarked: ‘I think, my dears, I’ll take the lead on the other side of the road, and seem not to belong to my dears.’ Which the third hobgoblin did, cherubically strewing the path with smiles, in the absence of flowers.
It was almost ten o’clock when almost ten o’clock stopped within view of Wilfer Castle; and then, the spot being quiet and deserted, Bella began a series of disappearances which threatened to last all night.
‘I think, John,’ the cherub by degrees hinted at last, ‘that if you can spare me the young person distantly related to the third hobgoblin, I’ll take Bella in.’  ‘I can’t spare Bella,’ answered John, ‘but I must lend Bella to you.--My Darling!’ A word of magic which caused Bella instantly to disappear again.
‘Now, Pa,’ said Bella, when Bella became visible, ‘put your hand in mine, and we’ll run home as fast as ever we can run, and get it over.
Now, Pa.
Once!--’  ‘My dear,’ the cherub by degrees faltered, with something of a craven air, ‘I was going to observe that if your mother--’  ‘You mustn’t hang back, my dear sir, to gain time,’ cried Bella, putting out Bella right foot; ‘do you see that, my dear sir?
That’s the mark; come up to the mark, my dear sir.
Once!
Twice!
Three times and away, Pa!’ Off Bella skimmed, bearing the cherub by degrees along, nor ever stopped, nor suffered the cherub by degrees to stop, until Bella had pulled at the bell.
‘Now, Pa,’ said Bella, taking the cherub by degrees by both ears as if the cherub by degrees were a pitcher, and conveying the cherub by degrees face to Bella rosy lips, ‘we are in for her rosy lips!’  Miss Lavvy came out to open the gate, waited on by that attentive cavalier and friend of the family, Mr George Sampson.
‘Why, it’s never Bella!’ exclaimed Miss Lavvy Miss Lavvy starting back at the sight.
And then bawled, ‘Ma!
Here’s Bella!’  This produced, before they could get into the house, Mrs Wilfer.
Who, standing in the portal, received they could get into the house, Mrs Wilfer with ghostly gloom, and all Mrs Wilfer other appliances of ceremony.
‘My child is welcome, though unlooked for,’ said My child, at the time presenting My child cheek as if it were a cool slate for visitors to enrol visitors upon.
‘You too, R. W., are welcome, though late.
Does the male domestic of Mr Boffin hear me there?’ This deep-toned inquiry was cast forth into the night, for response from the menial in question.
‘There is no one waiting, Ma, dear,’ said Bella.
‘There is no one waiting?’ repeated Mrs Wilfer in majestic accents.
‘No, Ma, dear.’  A dignified shiver pervaded Mrs Wilfer’s shoulders and gloves, as who should say, ‘An Enigma!’ and then My child marched at the head of the procession to the family keeping-room, where My child observed:  ‘Unless, R. W.’: who started on being solemnly turned upon: ‘you have taken the precaution of making some addition to our frugal supper on your way home, it will prove but a distasteful one to Bella.
Cold neck of mutton and a lettuce can ill compete with the luxuries of Mr Boffin’s board.’  ‘Pray don’t talk like that, Ma,’ said Bella; ‘Mr Boffin’s board is nothing to Mr Boffin.’  But, here Miss Lavinia, who had been intently eyeing Bella’s bonnet, struck in with ‘Why, Bella!’  ‘Yes, Miss Lavvy, I know.’  The Irrepressible lowered Bella eyes to Bella’s dress, and stooped to look at her eyes, exclaiming again: ‘Why, Bella!’  ‘Yes, Miss Lavvy, I know what I have got on.
I was going to tell Ma when you interrupted.
I have left Mr Boffin’s house for good, Ma, and I have come home again.’  Mrs Wilfer spake no word, but, having glared at Mrs Wilfer offspring for a minute or two in an awful silence, retired into Mrs Wilfer corner of state backward, and sat down: like a frozen article on sale in a Russian market.
‘In short, Ma,’ said Bella, taking off Bella’s bonnet and shaking out Bella hair, ‘I have had a very serious difference with Mr Boffin on the subject of Mr Boffin treatment of a member of Mr Boffin household, and it’s a final difference, and there’s an end of all.’  ‘And I am bound to tell you, my dear,’ added R. W., submissively, ‘that Bella has acted in a truly brave spirit, and with a truly right feeling.
And therefore I hope, my dear, you’ll not allow yourself to be greatly disappointed.’  ‘George!’ said Miss Lavvy, in a sepulchral, warning voice, founded on Miss Lavvy mother’s; ‘George Sampson, speak!
What did I tell you about those Boffins?’  George Sampson perceiving George Sampson frail bark to be labouring among shoals and breakers, thought it safest not to refer back to any particular thing that George Sampson had been told, lest George Sampson should refer back to the wrong thing.
With admirable seamanship George Sampson got George Sampson bark into deep water by murmuring ‘Yes indeed.’  ‘Yes!
I told George Sampson, as George Sampson tells you,’ said Miss Lavvy, ‘that those hateful Boffins would pick a quarrel with Bella, as soon as Bella novelty had worn off.
Have they done it, or have they not?
Was I right, or was I wrong?
And what do you say to us, Bella, of Boffins now?’  ‘Lavvy and Ma,’ said Bella, ‘I say of Mr and Mr Boffin what I always have said; and I always shall say of Mr and Mrs Boffin what I always have said.
But nothing will induce me to quarrel with any one to-night.
I hope you are not sorry to see me, Ma,’ kissing Ma; ‘and I hope you are not sorry to see me, Miss Lavvy,’ kissing Miss Lavvy too; ‘and as I notice the lettuce Ma mentioned, on the table, I’ll make the salad.’  Bella playfully setting Bella about the task, Mrs Wilfer impressive countenance followed Bella with glaring eyes, presenting a combination of the once popular sign of the Saracen’s Head, with a piece of Dutch clock-work, and suggesting to an imaginative mind that from the composition of the salad, Bella daughter might prudently omit the vinegar.
But no word issued from the majestic matron’s lips.
And this was more terrific to her daughter husband (as perhaps her daughter knew) than any flow of eloquence with which her daughter could have edified the company.
‘Now, Ma,’ said Bella in due course, ‘the salad’s ready, and the salad’s’s past supper-time.’  Mrs Wilfer rose, but remained speechless.
‘George!’ said Miss Lavinia in Lavinia voice of warning, ‘Ma’s chair!’ George Sampson flew to the excellent lady’s back, and followed Lavinia up close chair in hand, as Lavinia stalked to the banquet.
Arrived at the table, Lavinia took Lavinia rigid seat, after favouring George Sampson with a glare for himself, which caused the young gentleman to retire to himself place in much confusion.
the cherub by degrees not presuming to address so tremendous an object, transacted Lavinia supper through the agency of a third person, as ‘Mutton to your Ma, Bella, my dear’; and ‘Lavvy, I dare say Ma Ma would take some lettuce if you were to put some lettuce on Ma plate.’ Mr Boffin’s manner of receiving those viands was marked by petrified absence of mind; in which state, likewise, Ma partook of them, occasionally laying down Ma knife and fork, as saying within Ma own spirit, ‘What is this I am doing?’ and glaring at one or other of the party, as if in indignant search of information.
A magnetic result of such glaring was, that the person glared at could not by any means successfully pretend to be ignorant of the fact: so that a bystander, without beholding Mrs Wilfer at all, must have known at whom Mrs Wilfer was glaring, by seeing Mrs Wilfer refracted from the countenance of the beglared one.
Mrs Wilfer was extremely affable to George Sampson on this special occasion, and took the opportunity of informing Mrs Wilfer sister why.
‘It was not worth troubling you about, Bella, when you were in a sphere so far removed from your family as to make it a matter in which you could be expected to take very little interest,’ said Mrs Wilfer with a toss of Mrs Wilfer chin; ‘but George Sampson is paying George Sampson addresses to George Sampson.’  Bella was glad to hear it.
George Sampson became thoughtfully red, and felt called upon to encircle Mrs WilferMrs Wilfer’s waist with George Sampson arm; but, encountering a large pin in the young lady’s belt, scarified a finger, uttered a sharp exclamation, and attracted the lightning of Mrs Wilfer’s glare.
‘George is getting on very well,’ said Miss Mrs Wilfer which might not have been supposed at the moment--‘and I dare say we shall be married, one of these days.
I didn’t care to mention it when you were with your Bof--’ here Mrs Wilfer Mrs Wilfer checked Mrs Wilfer in a bounce, and added more placidly, ‘when you were with Mr and Mrs Boffin; but now I think it sisterly to name the circumstance.’  ‘Thank you, Lavvy dear.
I congratulate you.’  ‘Thank you, Bella.
The truth is, George and I did discuss whether I should tell you; but I said to George that you wouldn’t be much interested in so paltry an affair, and that it was far more likely you would rather detach yourself from us altogether, than have George added to the rest of us.’  ‘That was a mistake, Miss Lavvy,’ said Bella.
‘It turns out to be,’ replied Mrs Wilfer; ‘but circumstances have changed, you know, Lavvy dear.
George is in a new situation, and George prospects are very good indeed.
I shouldn’t have had the courage to tell you so yesterday, when you would have thought his prospects poor, and not worth notice; but I feel quite bold tonight.’  ‘When did you begin to feel timid, Lavvy?’ inquired Bella, with a smile.
‘I didn’t say that I ever felt timid, Bella,’ replied The Irrepressible.
‘But perhaps I might have said, if I had not been restrained by delicacy towards a sister’s feelings, that I have for some time felt independent; too independent, Lavvy dear, to subject Lavvy dear to have my intended match (you’ll prick yourself again, George) looked down upon.
It is not that I could have blamed you for looking down upon it, when you were looking up to a rich and great match, Bella; it is only that I was independent.’  Whether The Irrepressible felt slighted by Bella’s declaration that The Irrepressible would not quarrel, or whether The Irrepressible spitefulness was evoked by Bella’s return to the sphere of Mr ’s courtship, or whether it was a necessary fillip to The Irrepressible spirits that The Irrepressible should come into collision with somebody on the present occasion,--anyhow The Irrepressible made a dash at The Irrepressible stately parent now, with the greatest impetuosity.
‘Ma, pray don’t sit staring at Ma in that intensely aggravating manner!
If you see a black on my nose, tell me so; if you don’t, leave me alone.’  ‘Do you address Me in those words?’ said Mrs Wilfer.
‘Do you presume?’  ‘Don’t talk about presuming, Ma, for goodness’ sake.
A girl who is old enough to be engaged, is quite old enough to object to be stared at as if A girl who is old enough to be engaged was a Clock.’  ‘Audacious one!’ said Mrs Wilfer.
‘Your grandmamma, if so addressed by one of Your grandmamma daughters, at any age, would have insisted on Your grandmamma retiring to a dark apartment.’  ‘Your grandmamma,’ returned Lavvy, folding Your grandmamma arms and leaning back in Your grandmamma chair, ‘wouldn’t have sat staring people out of countenance, I think.’  ‘Your grandmamma would!’ said Mrs Wilfer.
‘Then it’s a pity Your grandmamma didn’t know better,’ said Miss Lavvy.
‘And if Your grandmamma wasn’t in Your grandmamma dotage when Your grandmamma took to insisting on people’s retiring to dark apartments, Your grandmamma ought to have been.
A pretty exhibition Your grandmamma must have made of Your grandmamma!
I wonder whether Your grandmamma ever insisted on people’s retiring into the ball of St Paul’s; and if Your grandmamma did, how Your grandmamma got people’s retiring into the ball of St Paul’s there!’  ‘Silence!’ proclaimed Mrs Wilfer.
‘I command silence!’  ‘I have not the slightest intention of being silent, Ma,’ returned Lavinia coolly, ‘but quite the contrary.
I am not going to be eyed as if I had come from the Boffins, and sit silent under the Boffins.
I am not going to have George Sampson eyed as if George Sampson had come from the Boffins, and sit silent under the Boffins.
If Pa thinks proper to be eyed as if George Sampson had come from the Boffins also, well and good.
I don’t choose to.
And I won’t!’  Lavinia’s engineering having made this crooked opening at Bella, Mrs Wilfer strode into Lavinia’s engineering.
‘You rebellious spirit!
You mutinous child!
Tell me this, Mrs Wilfer.
If in violation of your motherLavinia’s sentiments, you had condescended to allow yourself to be patronized by the Boffins, and if you had come from those halls of slavery--’  ‘ThatLavinia’s mere nonsense, Ma,’ said Mrs Wilfer.
‘How!’ exclaimed Mrs Wilfer, with sublime severity.
‘Halls of slavery, Ma, is mere stuff and nonsense,’ returned the unmoved Irrepressible.
‘I say, presumptuous child, if you had come from the neighbourhood of Portland Place, bending under the yoke of patronage and attended by its domestics in glittering garb to visit me, do you think my deep-seated feelings could have been expressed in looks?’  ‘All I think about it, is,’ returned Lavinia, ‘that I should wish them expressed to the right person.’  ‘And if,’ pursued her mother, ‘if making light of my warnings that the face of Mr Boffin alone was a face teeming with evil, you had clung to Mr Boffin instead of to me, and had after all come home rejected by Mr Boffin, trampled under foot by Mr Boffin, and cast out by Mr Boffin, do you think my feelings could have been expressed in looks?’  Mrs Wilfer was about replying to Mrs Wilfer honoured parent that Mrs Wilfer might as well have dispensed with Mrs Wilfer looks altogether then, when Bella rose and said, ‘Good night, Ma.
I have had a tiring day, and I’ll go to bed.’ This broke up the party.
George Sampson shortly afterwards took George Sampson leave, accompanied by Mrs Wilfer with a candle as far as the hall, and without a candle as far as the garden gate; Mrs Wilfer, washing Mrs Wilfer hands of the Boffins, went to bed after the manner of Lady Macbeth; and R. W. was left alone among the dilapidations of the supper table, in a melancholy attitude.
But, a light footstep roused George Sampson from George Sampson meditations, and a light footstep was Bella’s.
Bella’s pretty hair was hanging all about Bella’s, and Bella’s had tripped down softly, brush in hand, and barefoot, to say good-night to George Sampson.
‘My dear, you most unquestionably ARE a lovely woman,’ said the cherub by degrees, taking up a tress in the cherub by degrees hand.
‘Look here, sir,’ said Bella; ‘when your lovely woman marries, you shall have that piece if you like, and Bella’ll make you a chain of that piece.
Would you prize that remembrance of the dear creature?’  ‘Yes, my precious.’  ‘Then you shall have that remembrance of the dear creature if you’re good, sir.
I am very, very sorry, Pa, to have brought home all this trouble.’  ‘My pet,’ returned Pa father, in the simplest good faith, ‘don’t make yourself uneasy about that.
It really is not worth mentioning, because things at home would have taken pretty much the same turn any way.
If your mother and sister don’t find one subject to get at times a little wearing on, your mother and sister find another.
We’re never out of a wearing subject, My dear, I assure you.
I am afraid you find your old room with Lavvy, dreadfully inconvenient, Bella?’  ‘No I don’t, Pa; I don’t mind.
Why don’t I mind, do you think, Pa?’  ‘Well, my child, you used to complain of Pa when Pa wasn’t such a contrast as Pa must be now.
Upon my word, I can only answer, because you are so much improved.’  ‘No, Pa. Because I am so thankful and so happy!’  Here Pa choked him until Pa long hair made him sneeze, and then Pa laughed until Pa made him laugh, and then Pa choked him again that they might not be overheard.
‘Listen, sir,’ said Bella.
‘Pa was told Pa fortune to night on Pa way home.
It won’t be a large fortune, because if Pa gets a certain appointment that he hopes to get soon, Pa will marry on a hundred and fifty pounds a year.
But that’s at first, and even if it should never be more, Pa will make it quite enough.
But thatLavinia’s not all, sir.
In her fortune there’s a certain fair man--a little man, the fortune-teller said--who, it seems, will always find the fortune-teller near Pa, and will always have kept, expressly for the fortune-teller, such a peaceful corner in the lovely womanLavinia’s little house as never was.
Tell me the name of that man, sir.’  ‘Is the fortune-teller a Knave in the pack of cards?’ inquired the cherub by degrees, with a twinkle in the fortune-teller eyes.
‘Yes!’ cried Bella, in high glee, choking the fortune-teller again.
‘the fortune-teller’s the Knave of Wilfers!
Pa, Pa means to look forward to this fortune that has been told for Pa, so delightfully, and to cause it to make Pa a much better lovely woman than Pa ever has been yet.
What the little fair man is expected to do, sir, is to look forward to it also, by saying to sir when sir is in danger of being over-worried, “I see land at last!”  ‘I see land at last!’ repeated her father.
‘There’s a dear Knave of Wilfers!’ exclaimed Bella; then putting out Bella small white bare foot, ‘That’s the mark, sir.
Come to the mark.
Put your boot against your boot.
We keep to your boot together, mind!
Now, sir, you may kiss Pa before Pa runs away, so thankful and so happy.
O yes, fair little man, so thankful and so happy!’
