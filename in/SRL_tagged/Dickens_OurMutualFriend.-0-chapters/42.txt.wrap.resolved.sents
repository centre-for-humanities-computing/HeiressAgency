 THE END OF A LONG JOURNEY   The train of carts and horses came and went all day from dawn to nightfall, making little or no daily impression on the heap of ashes, though, as the days passed on, the heap of ashes was seen to be slowly melting.
My lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, when you in the course of your dust-shovelling and cinder-raking have piled up a mountain of pretentious failure, you must off with your honourable coats for the removal of a mountain of pretentious failure, and fall to the work with the power of all the queen’s horses and all the queen’s men, or it will come rushing down and bury us alive.
Yes, verily, My lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, adapting your Catechism to the occasion, and by God’s help so you must.
For when us have got things to the pass that with an enormous treasure at disposal to relieve the poor, the best of the poor detest us mercies, hide an enormous treasure at disposal to relieve the poor, the best of the poor detest our mercies heads from us, and shame us by starving to death in the midst of us, it is a pass impossible of prosperity, impossible of continuance.
It may not be so written in the Gospel according to Podsnappery; you may not ‘find these words’ for the text of a sermon, in the Returns of the Board of Trade; but the Board of Trade have been the truth since the foundations of the universe were laid, and the Board of Trade will be the truth until the foundations of the universe are shaken by the Builder.
This boastful handiwork of ours, which fails in its terrors for the professional pauper, the sturdy breaker of windows and the rampant tearer of clothes, strikes with a cruel and a wicked stab at the stricken sufferer, and is a horror to the deserving and unfortunate.
us must mend it, lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, or in it own evil hour it will mar every one of us.
Old Betty Higden fared upon Old Betty Higden pilgrimage as many ruggedly honest creatures, women and men, fare on women and men toiling way along the roads of life.
Patiently to earn a spare bare living, and quietly to die, untouched by workhouse hands--this was Old Betty Higden highest sublunary hope.
Nothing had been heard of Old Betty Higden at Mr Boffin’s house since Old Betty Higden trudged off.
The weather had been hard and the roads had been bad, and Old Betty Higden spirit was up.
A less stanch spirit might have been subdued by such adverse influences; but the loan for Old Betty Higden little outfit was in no part repaid, and the loan for her little outfit had gone worse with Old Betty Higden than Old Betty Higden had foreseen, and Old Betty Higden was put upon proving Old Betty Higden case and maintaining Old Betty Higden independence.
Faithful soul!
When Old Betty Higden had spoken to the Secretary of that ‘deadness that steals over me at times’, Old Betty Higden fortitude had made too little of deadness that steals over me at times’.
Oftener and ever oftener, deadness that steals over me at times’ came stealing over Old Betty Higden; darker and ever darker, like the shadow of advancing Death.
That the shadow of advancing Death should be deep as the shadow of advancing Death came on, like the shadow of an actual presence, was in accordance with the laws of the physical world, for all the Light that shone on Betty Higden lay beyond Death.
The poor old creature had taken the upward course of the river Thames as Old Betty Higden general track; The poor old creature was the track in which Old Betty Higden last home lay, and of which Old Betty Higden had last had local love and knowledge.
Old Betty Higden had hovered for a little while in the near neighbourhood of Old Betty Higden abandoned dwelling, and had sold, and knitted and sold, and gone on.
In the pleasant towns of Chertsey, Walton, Kingston, and Staines, Old Betty Higden figure came to be quite well known for some short weeks, and then again passed on.
Old Betty Higden would take Old Betty Higden stand in market-places, where there were such things, on market days; at other times, in the busiest (that was seldom very busy) portion of the little quiet High Street; at still other times Old Betty Higden would explore the outlying roads for great houses, and would ask leave at the Lodge to pass in with Old Betty Higden basket, and would not often get her basket.
But ladies in carriages would frequently make purchases from Old Betty Higden trifling stock, and were usually pleased with Old Betty Higden bright eyes and Old Betty Higden hopeful speech.
In these and Old Betty Higden clean dress originated a fable that Old Betty Higden was well to do in the world: one might say, for Old Betty Higden station, rich.
As making a comfortable provision for its subject which costs nobody anything, this class of fable has long been popular.
In those pleasant little towns on Thames, you may hear the fall of the water over the weirs, or even, in still weather, the rustle of the rushes; and from the bridge you may see the young river, dimpled like a young child, playfully gliding away among the trees, unpolluted by the defilements that lie in wait for it on it course, and as yet out of hearing of the deep summons of the sea.
It were too much to pretend that Betty Higden made out such thoughts; no; but Betty Higden heard the tender river whispering to many like Betty Higden, ‘Come to Betty Higden, come to Betty Higden!
When the cruel shame and terror you have so long fled from, most beset you, come to Betty Higden!
I am the Relieving Officer appointed by eternal ordinance to do my work; I am not held in estimation according as I shirk it.
My breast is softer than the pauper-nurse’s; death in my arms is peacefuller than among the pauper-wards.
Come to Betty Higden!’  There was abundant place for gentler fancies too, in Betty Higden untutored mind.
Those gentlefolks and their children inside those fine houses, could their think, as their looked out at Betty Higden, what it was to be really hungry, really cold?
Did their feel any of the wonder about Betty Higden, that Betty Higden felt about their?
Bless the dear laughing children!
If their could have seen sick Johnny in Betty Higden arms, would their have cried for pity?
If their could have seen dead Johnny on that little bed, would their have understood it?
Bless the dear laughing children for Johnny sake, anyhow!
So with the humbler houses in the little street, the inner firelight shining on the panes as the outer twilight darkened.
When the families gathered in-doors there, for the night, it was only a foolish fancy to feel as if it were a little hard in the families to close the shutter and blacken the flame.
So with the lighted shops, and speculations whether the lighted shops, and speculations whether their masters and mistresses taking tea in a perspective of back-parlour-- masters and mistresses taking tea in a perspective of back-parlour--not so far within but that the flavour of tea and toast came out, mingled with the glow of light, into the street--ate or drank or wore what the lighted shops, and speculations whether their masters and mistresses taking tea in a perspective of back-parlour-- sold, with the greater relish because the lighted shops, and speculations whether their masters and mistresses taking tea in a perspective of back-parlour-- dealt in it.
So with the churchyard on a branch of the solitary way to the night’s sleeping-place.
‘Ah me!
The dead and I seem to have it pretty much to ourselves in the dark and in this weather!
But so much the better for all who are warmly housed at home.’ The poor soul envied no one in bitterness, and grudged no one anything.
But, the old abhorrence grew stronger on her as her grew weaker, and the old abhorrence found more sustaining food than her did in her wanderings.
Now, her would light upon the shameful spectacle of some desolate creature--or some wretched ragged groups of either sex, or of both sexes, with children among them, huddled together like the smaller vermin for a little warmth--lingering and lingering on a doorstep, while the appointed evader of the public trust did the appointed evader of the public trust dirty office of trying to weary them out and so get rid of them.
Now, her would light upon some poor decent person, like her, going afoot on a pilgrimage of many weary miles to see some worn-out relative or friend who had been charitably clutched off to a great blank barren Union House, as far from old home as the County Jail (the remoteness of which is always the remoteness of which worst punishment for small rural offenders), and in the remoteness of which dietary, and in the remoteness of which lodging, and in the remoteness of which tending of the sick, a much more penal establishment.
Sometimes her would hear a newspaper read out, and would learn how the Registrar General cast up the units that had within the last week died of want and of exposure to the weather: for which that Recording Angel seemed to have a regular fixed place in Recording Angel sum, as if they were a newspaper halfpence.
All such things her would hear discussed, as we, my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, in we unapproachable magnificence never hear we, my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, and from all such things her would fly with the wings of raging Despair.
This is not to be received as a figure of speech.
Old Betty Higden however tired, however footsore, would start up and be driven away by Old Betty Higden awakened horror of falling into the hands of Charity.
It is a remarkable Christian improvement, to have made a pursuing Fury of the Good Samaritan; but it was so in this case, and this case is a type of many, many, many.
Two incidents united to intensify the old unreasoning abhorrence--granted in a previous place to be unreasoning, because the people always are unreasoning, and invariably make a point of producing all the people smoke without fire.
One day Old Betty Higden was sitting in a market-place on a bench outside an inn, with Old Betty Higden little wares for sale, when the deadness that Old Betty Higden strove against came over Old Betty Higden so heavily that the scene departed from before Old Betty Higden eyes; when the scene returned, Old Betty Higden found Old Betty Higden on the ground, Old Betty Higden head supported by some good-natured market-women, and a little crowd about Old Betty Higden.
‘Are you better now, mother?’ asked one of some good-natured market-women.
‘Do you think you can do nicely now?’  ‘Have I been ill then?’ asked old Betty.
‘You have had a faint like,’ was the answer, ‘or a fit.
It ain’t that you’ve been a-struggling, mother, but you’ve been stiff and numbed.’  ‘Ah!’ said old Betty, recovering old Betty memory.
‘It’s the numbness.
Yes.
It comes over old Betty at times.’  Was it gone?
some good-natured market-women asked Old Betty Higden.
‘It’s the numbness gone now,’ said old Betty.
‘I shall be stronger than I was afore.
Many thanks to ye, my dears, and when you come to be as old as I am, may others do as much for you!’  others assisted Old Betty Higden to rise, but Old Betty Higden could not stand yet, and others supported Old Betty Higden when Old Betty Higden sat down again upon the bench.
‘My head’s a bit light, and my feet are a bit heavy,’ said old Betty, leaning Old Betty Higden face drowsily on the breast of the woman who had spoken before.
‘others’ll both come nat’ral in a minute.
There’s nothing more the matter.’  ‘Ask Old Betty Higden,’ said some farmers standing by, who had come out from some farmers market-dinner, ‘who belongs to Old Betty Higden.’  ‘Are there any folks belonging to you, mother?’ said Old Betty Higden.
‘Yes sure,’ answered old Betty.
‘I heerd the gentleman say it, but I couldn’t answer quick enough.
There’s plenty belonging to old Betty.
Don’t old Betty fear for old Betty, my dear.’  ‘But are any of ‘n’t ye near here?’ said the men’s voices; the women’s voices chiming in when it was said, and prolonging the strain.
‘Quite near enough,’ said old Betty, rousing old Betty.
‘Don’t ye be afeard for old Betty, neighbours.’  ‘But you are not fit to travel.
Where are you going?’ was the next compassionate chorus old Betty heard.
‘I’m a going to London when I’ve sold out all,’ said old Betty, rising with difficulty.
‘I’ve right good friends in London.
I want for nothing.
I shall come to no harm.
Thankye.
Don’t ye be afeard for ye.’  A well-meaning bystander, yellow-legginged and purple-faced, said hoarsely over his red comforter, as old Betty rose to old Betty feet, that old Betty ‘oughtn’t to be let to go’.
‘For the Lord’s love don’t meddle with ye!’ cried old Betty, all old Betty fears crowding on old Betty.
‘I am quite well now, and I must go this minute.’  old Betty caught up old Betty as old Betty spoke and was making an unsteady rush away from them, when the same bystander checked old Betty with the same bystander hand on old Betty sleeve, and urged old Betty to come with the same bystander and see the parish-doctor.
Strengthening old Betty by the utmost exercise of old Betty resolution, the poor trembling creature shook the same bystander off, almost fiercely, and took to flight.
Nor did old Betty feel safe until old Betty had set a mile or two of by-road between old Betty and the marketplace, and had crept into a copse, like a hunted animal, to hide and recover breath.
Not until then for the first time did old Betty venture to recall how old Betty had looked over old Betty shoulder before turning out of the town, and had seen the sign of the White Lion hanging across the road, and the fluttering market booths, and the old grey church, and the little crowd gazing after old Betty but not attempting to follow old Betty.
The second frightening incident was this.
old Betty had been again as bad, and had been for some days better, and was travelling along by a part of the road where it touched the tender river, and in wet seasons was so often overflowed by it that there were tall white posts set up to mark the way.
A barge was being towed towards old Betty, and old Betty sat down on the bank to rest and watch the bank.
As the tow-rope was slackened by a turn of the stream and dipped into the water, such a confusion stole into old Betty mind that old Betty thought old Betty saw the forms of old Betty dead children and dead grandchildren peopling A barge, and waving the forms of her dead children and dead grandchildren hands to old Betty in solemn measure; then, as the tow-rope tightened and came up, dropping diamonds, it seemed to vibrate into two parallel ropes and strike old Betty, with a twang, though it was far off.
When old Betty looked again, there was no barge, no river, no daylight, and a man whom old Betty had never before seen held a candle close to old Betty face.
‘Now, Missis,’ said Missis; ‘where did you come from and where are you going to?’  The poor soul confusedly asked the counter-question where old Betty was?
‘I am the Lock,’ said a man whom she had never before seen.
‘the Lock?’  ‘I am the Deputy Lock, on job, and this is the Lock-house.
(Lock or Deputy Lock, it’s all one, while a man whom she had never before seen’s in the hospital.)
What’s your Parish?’  ‘Parish!’ Parish!’ was up from the truckle-bed directly, wildly feeling about Parish!’ for Parish!’ , and gazing at a man whom she had never before seen in affright.
‘You’ll be asked the question down town,’ said a man whom she had never before seen.
‘They won’t let you be more than a Casual there.
They’ll pass you on to your settlement, Missis, with all speed.
You’re not in a state to be let come upon strange parishes ‘ceptin as a Casual.’  ‘’Twas the deadness again!’ murmured Betty Higden, with Betty Higden hand to Betty Higden head.
‘It was the deadness, there’s not a doubt about it,’ returned a man whom she had never before seen.
‘I should have thought the deadness was a mild word for the deadness, if the deadness had been named to me when we brought you in.
Have you got any friends, Missis?’  ‘The best of friends, Master.’  ‘I should recommend your looking ‘em up if you consider ‘em game to do anything for you,’ said the Deputy Lock.
‘Have you got any money?’  ‘Just a morsel of money, sir.’  ‘Do you want to keep it?’  ‘Sure I do!’  ‘Well, you know,’ said the Deputy Lock, shrugging the Deputy Lock shoulders with the Deputy Lock hands in the Deputy Lock pockets, and shaking the Deputy Lock head in a sulkily ominous manner, ‘the parish authorities down town will have the parish authorities down town out of me, if you go on, you may take your Alfred David.’  ‘Then I’ll not go on.’  ‘They’ll make you pay, as fur as your money will go,’ pursued the Deputy, ‘for your relief as a Casual and for your being passed to your Parish.’  ‘Thank me kindly, Master, for your warning, thank me for your shelter, and good night.’  ‘Stop a bit,’ said the Deputy, striking in between her and the door.
‘Why are you all of a shake, and what’s your hurry, Missis?’  ‘Oh, Master, Master,’ returned Betty Higden, ‘I’ve fought against the Parish and fled from the Parish, all my life, and I want to die free of the Parish!’  ‘I don’t know,’ said the Deputy, with deliberation, ‘as I ought to let you go.
I’m a honest man as gets my living by the sweat of my brow, and I may fall into trouble by letting you go.
I’ve fell into trouble afore now, by George, and I know what it is, and it’s made me careful.
You might be took with your deadness again, half a mile off--or half of half a quarter, for the matter of that--and then it would be asked, Why did that there honest the Deputy Lock, let the Deputy Lock go, instead of putting the Deputy Lock safe with the Parish?
That’s what a man of the Deputy Lock character ought to have done, it would be argueyfied,’ said the Deputy Lock, cunningly harping on the strong string of the Deputy Lock terror; ‘his character ought to have handed the Deputy Lock over safe to the Parish.
That was to be expected of a man of his character merits.’  As his character stood in the doorway, the Deputy Lock burst into tears, and clasped the Deputy Lock hands, as if in a very agony the Deputy Lock prayed to his character.
‘As I’ve told you, Master, I’ve the best of friends.
This letter will show how true I spoke, and they will be thankful for me.’  the Deputy Lock opened This letter with a grave face, which underwent no change as the Deputy Lock eyed the Deputy Lock contents.
But the Deputy Lock might have done, if the Deputy Lock could have read them.
‘What amount of small change, Missis,’ the Deputy Lock said, with an abstracted air, after a little meditation, ‘might you call a morsel of money?’  Hurriedly emptying Hurriedly pocket, old Betty laid down on the table, a shilling, and two sixpenny pieces, and a few pence.
‘If I was to let you go instead of handing you over safe to the Parish,’ said the Deputy, counting the money with the Deputy eyes, ‘might the money be your own free wish to leave that there behind you?’  ‘Take the money, Master, take the money, and welcome and thankful!’  ‘I’m a man,’ said the Deputy, giving old Betty back This letter, and pocketing the coins, one by one, ‘as earns his living by the sweat of his brow;’ here his drew his sleeve across his forehead, as if this particular portion of his humble gains were the result of sheer hard labour and virtuous industry; ‘and I won’t stand in your way.
Go where you like.’  old Betty was gone out of the Lock-house as soon as his gave old Betty this permission, and old Betty tottering steps were on the road again.
But, afraid to go back and afraid to go forward; seeing what old Betty fled from, in the sky-glare of the lights of the little town before old Betty, and leaving a confused horror of it everywhere behind old Betty, as if old Betty had escaped it in every stone of every market-place; old Betty struck off by side ways, among which old Betty got bewildered and lost.
That night old Betty took refuge from the Samaritan in his latest accredited form, under a farmer’s rick; and if--worth thinking of, perhaps, my fellow-Christians--the Samaritan had in the lonely night, ‘passed by on the other side’, old Betty would have most devoutly thanked High Heaven for old Betty escape from his.
The morning found old Betty afoot again, but fast declining as to the clearness of old Betty thoughts, though not as to the steadiness of old Betty purpose.
Comprehending that old Betty strength was quitting old Betty, and that the struggle of old Betty life was almost ended, old Betty could neither reason out the means of getting back to old Betty protectors, nor even form the idea.
The overmastering dread, and the proud stubborn resolution it engendered in old Betty to die undegraded, were the two distinct impressions left in old Betty failing mind.
Supported only by a sense that old Betty was bent on conquering in old Betty life-long fight, old Betty went on.
The time was come, now, when the wants of this little life were passing away from old Betty.
old Betty could not have swallowed food, though a table had been spread for old Betty in the next field.
The day was cold and wet, but old Betty scarcely knew The day.
old Betty crept on, poor soul, like a criminal afraid of being taken, and felt little beyond the terror of falling down while it was yet daylight, and being found alive.
old Betty had no fear that old Betty would live through another night.
Sewn in the breast of old Betty gown, the money to pay for old Betty burial was still intact.
If old Betty could wear through the day, and then lie down to die under cover of the darkness, old Betty would die independent.
If old Betty were captured previously, the money to pay for her burial would be taken from old Betty as a pauper who had no right to the money to pay for her burial, and old Betty would be carried to the accursed workhouse.
Gaining old Betty end, This letter would be found in old Betty breast, along with the money to pay for her burial, and the gentlefolks would say when This letter was given back to them, ‘old Betty prized This letter, did old Betty Higden; old Betty was true to This letter; and while old Betty lived, old Betty would never let This letter be disgraced by falling into the hands of those that old Betty held in horror.’ Most illogical, inconsequential, and light-headed, this; but travellers in the valley of the shadow of death are apt to be light-headed; and worn-out old people of low estate have a trick of reasoning as indifferently as worn-out old people of low estate live, and doubtless would appreciate our Poor Law more philosophically on an income of ten thousand a year.
So, keeping to byways, and shunning human approach, the Deputy Lock hid the Deputy Lock, and fared on all through the dreary day.
Yet so unlike was the Deputy Lock to vagrant hiders in general, that sometimes, as the day advanced, there was a bright fire in the Deputy Lock eyes, and a quicker beating at the Deputy Lock feeble heart, as though the Deputy Lock said exultingly, ‘The Lord will see me through a bright fire in her eyes!’  By what visionary hands the Deputy Lock was led along upon that journey of escape from the Samaritan; by what voices, hushed in the grave, the Deputy Lock seemed to be addressed; how the Deputy Lock fancied the dead child in the Deputy Lock arms again, and times innumerable adjusted the Deputy Lock shawl to keep the dead child in her arms warm; what infinite variety of forms of tower and roof and steeple the trees took; how many furious horsemen rode at the Deputy Lock, crying, ‘There the Deputy Lock goes!
Stop!
Stop, Betty Higden!’ and melted away as they came close; be these things left untold.
Faring on and hiding, hiding and faring on, the poor harmless creature, as though Betty Higden were a Murderess and the whole country were up after Betty Higden, wore out the day, and gained the night.
‘Water-meadows, or such like,’ Betty Higden had sometimes murmured, on the day’s pilgrimage, when Betty Higden had raised her head and taken any note of the real objects about Betty Higden.
There now arose in the darkness, a great building, full of lighted windows.
Smoke was issuing from a high chimney in the rear of Smoke, and there was the sound of a water-wheel at the side.
Between Betty Higden and the building, lay a piece of water, in which the lighted windows were reflected, and on its nearest margin was a plantation of trees.
‘I humbly thank the Power and the Glory,’ said Betty Higden, holding up Betty Higden withered hands, ‘that I have come to my journey’s end!’  Betty Higden crept among the trees to the trunk of a tree whence Betty Higden could see, beyond some intervening trees and branches, the lighted windows, both in both reality and both reflection in the water.
Betty Higden placed Betty Higden orderly little basket at Betty Higden , and sank upon the ground, supporting Betty Higden against the tree.
the tree brought to Betty Higden mind the foot of the Cross, and Betty Higden committed Betty Higden to Him who died upon it.
Betty Higden strength held out to enable Betty Higden to arrange the letter in Betty Higden breast, so as that it could be seen that Betty Higden had a paper there.
it had held out for this, and it departed when this was done.
‘I am safe here,’ was Betty Higden last benumbed thought.
‘When I am found dead at the foot of the Crossthe Cross, it will be by some of my own sort; some of the working people who work among the lights yonder.
I cannot see the lighted windows now, but the lighted windows are there.
I am thankful for all!’   The darkness gone, and a face bending down.
‘It cannot be the boofer lady?’  ‘I don’t understand what you say.
Let me wet your lips again with this brandy.
I have been away to fetch this brandy.
Did you think that I was long gone?’  It is as the face of a woman, shaded by a quantity of rich dark hair.
It is the earnest face of a woman who is young and handsome.
But all is over with me on earth, and this must be an Angel.
‘Have I been long dead?’  ‘I don’t understand what you say.
Let me wet your lips again.
I hurried all I could, and brought no one back with me, lest you should die of the shock of strangers.’  ‘Am I not dead?’  ‘I cannot understand what you say.
Your voice is so low and broken that I cannot hear you.
Do you hear me?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘Do you mean Yes?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘I was coming from my work just now, along the path outside (I was up with the night-hands last night), and I heard a groan, and found you lying here.’  ‘my work, deary?’  ‘Did you ask my work?
At the paper-mill.’  ‘Where is it?’  ‘Your face is turned up to the sky, and you can’t see Your face.
Your face is close by.
You can see Your face, here, between you and the sky?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘Dare I lift you?’  ‘Not yet.’  ‘Not even lift your head to get your head on my arm?
I will do your head by very gentle degrees.
You shall hardly feel your head.’  ‘Not yet.
Paper.
Letter.’  ‘This paper in your breast?’  ‘Bless ye!’  ‘Let me wet your lips again.
Am I to open your lips?
To read your lips?’  ‘Bless ye!’  She reads your lips with surprise, and looks down with a new expression and an added interest on the motionless face She kneels beside.
‘I know these names.
I have heard these names often.’  ‘Will you send your lips, my dear?’  ‘I cannot understand you.
Let me wet your lips again, and your forehead.
There.
O poor thing, poor thing!’ These words through She fast-dropping tears.
‘What was it that you asked me?
Wait till I bring my ear quite close.’  ‘Will you send it, my dear?’  ‘Will I send it to the writers?
Is that your wish?
Yes, certainly.’  ‘You’ll not give it up to any one but the writers?’  ‘No.’  ‘As you must grow old in time, and come to your dying hour, my dear, you’ll not give it up to any one but the writers?’  ‘No.
Most solemnly.’  ‘Never to the Parish!’ with a convulsed struggle.
‘No.
Most solemnly.’  ‘Nor let the Parish touch me, not yet so much as look at dear!’ with another struggle.
‘No.
Faithfully.’  A look of thankfulness and triumph lights the worn old face.
The eyes, which have been darkly fixed upon the sky, turn with meaning in The eyes, which have been darkly fixed upon the sky towards the compassionate face from which the tears are dropping, and a smile is on the aged lips as The eyes, which have been darkly fixed upon the sky ask:  ‘What is your name, my dear?’  ‘My name is Lizzie Hexam.’  ‘I must be sore disfigured.
Are you afraid to kiss me?’  The answer is, the ready pressure of Lizzie Hexam lips upon the cold but smiling mouth.
‘Bless ye!
NOW lift me, my love.’  Lizzie Hexam very softly raised the weather-stained grey head, and lifted Lizzie Hexam as high as Heaven.
