 SETTING TRAPS   Plashwater Weir Mill Lock looked tranquil and pretty on an evening in the summer time. A soft air stirred the leaves of the fresh green trees, and passed like a smooth shadow over the river, and like a smoother shadow over the yielding grass. The voice of the falling water, like the voices of the sea and the wind, were as an outer memory to a contemplative listener; but not particularly so to Mr Riderhood, who sat on one of the blunt wooden levers of his lock-gates, dozing. Wine must be got into a butt by some agency before a butt can be drawn out; and the wine of sentiment never having been got into Mr Riderhood by any agency, nothing in nature tapped Mr Riderhood.  As the Rogue sat, ever and again nodding Mr Riderhood off Mr Riderhood balance, Mr Riderhood recovery was always attended by an angry stare and growl, as if, in the absence of any one else, Mr Riderhood had aggressive inclinations towards Mr Riderhood. In one of these starts the cry of ‘Lock, ho! Lock!’ prevented Mr Riderhood relapse into a doze. Shaking Mr Riderhood as Mr Riderhood got up like the surly brute Mr Riderhood was, Mr Riderhood gave Mr Riderhood growl a responsive twist at the end, and turned Mr Riderhood face down-stream to see who hailed.  It was an amateur-sculler, well up to Mr Riderhood work though taking It easily, in so light a boat that the Rogue remarked: ‘A little less on you, and you’d a’most ha’ been a Wagerbut’; then went to work at Mr Riderhood windlass handles and sluices, to let an amateur-sculler in. As the latter stood in Mr Riderhood boat, holding on by the boat-hook to the woodwork at the lock side, waiting for the gates to open, Rogue Riderhood recognized Rogue Riderhood ‘T’other governor,’ Mr Eugene Wrayburn; who was, however, too indifferent or too much engaged to recognize Rogue Riderhood.  The creaking lock-gates opened slowly, and his boat passed in as soon as there was room enough, and The creaking lock-gates closed upon room enough, and room enough floated low down in the dock between the two sets of gates, until the water should rise and the second gates should open and let room enough out. When Rogue Riderhood had run to Rogue Riderhood second windlass and turned Rogue Riderhood, and while Rogue Riderhood leaned against the lever of that gate to help Rogue Riderhood to swing open presently, Rogue Riderhood noticed, lying to rest under the green hedge by the towing-path astern of the Lock, a Bargeman.  the water rose and rose as the sluice poured in, dispersing the scum which had formed behind the lumbering gates, and sending his boat up, so that an amateur-sculler gradually rose like an apparition against the light from the bargeman’s point of view. Rogue Riderhood observed that the bargeman rose too, leaning on Rogue Riderhood arm, and seemed to have Rogue Riderhood eyes fastened on the rising figure.  But, there was the toll to be taken, as the second gates were now complaining and opening. The T’other governor tossed it ashore, twisted in a piece of paper, and as The T’other governor did so, knew The T’other governor man.  ‘Ay, ay? It’s you, is It, honest friend?’ said Eugene, seating Eugene preparatory to resuming Eugene sculls. ‘You got the place, then?’  ‘I got the place, and no thanks to Eugene for the place, nor yet none to Lawyer Lightwood,’ gruffly answered Rogue Riderhood.  ‘We saved We recommendation, honest fellow,’ said Eugene, ‘for the next candidate--the one who will offer the next candidate when you are transported or hanged. Don’t be long about it; will you be so good?’  So imperturbable was the air with which he gravely bent to he work that Rogue Riderhood remained staring at he, without having found a retort, until he had rowed past a line of wooden objects by the weir, which showed like huge teetotums standing at rest in the water, and was almost hidden by the drooping boughs on the left bank, as he rowed away, keeping out of the opposing current. It being then too late to retort with any effect--if that could ever have been done--the honest man confined the honest man to cursing and growling in a grim under-tone. Having then got the honest man gates shut, the honest man crossed back by the honest man plank lock-bridge to the towing-path side of the river.  If, in so doing, the honest man took another glance at the bargeman, the honest man did it by stealth. the honest man cast the honest man on the grass by the Lock side, in an indolent way, with the honest man back in that direction, and, having gathered a few blades, fell to chewing a few blades. The dip of Eugene Wrayburn’s sculls had become hardly audible in the honest man ears when the bargeman passed the honest man, putting the utmost width that the honest man could between The dip of Eugene Wrayburn’s sculls, and keeping under the hedge. Then, Riderhood sat up and took a long look at Riderhood figure, and then cried: ‘Hi--I--i! Lock, ho! Lock! Plashwater Weir Mill Lock!’  the bargeman stopped, and looked back.  ‘Plashwater Weir Mill Lock, T’otherest gov--er--nor--or--or--or!’ cried Mr Riderhood, with Mr Riderhood hands to Mr Riderhood mouth.  the bargeman turned back. Approaching nearer and nearer, the bargeman became Bradley Headstone, in rough water-side second-hand clothing.  ‘Wish I may die,’ said Riderhood, smiting Riderhood right leg, and laughing, as Riderhood sat on the grass, ‘if you ain’t ha’ been a imitating me, T’otherest governor! Never thought myself so good-looking afore!’  Truly, Bradley Headstone had taken careful note of the honest man’s dress in the course of that night-walk they had had together. Bradley Headstone must have committed it to memory, and slowly got it by heart. it was exactly reproduced in the dress Bradley Headstone now wore. And whereas, in Bradley Headstone own schoolmaster clothes, Bradley Headstone usually looked as if they were the clothes of some other man, Bradley Headstone now looked, in the clothes of some other man or men, as if they were Bradley Headstone own.  ‘THIS your Lock?’ said Bradley, whose surprise had a genuine air; ‘they told me, where I last inquired, it was the third I should come to. This is only the second.’  ‘It’s my belief, governor,’ returned Riderhood, with a wink and shake of his head, ‘that you’ve dropped one in your counting. you’ve dropped one in your counting ain’t Locks as YOU’VE been giving your mind to. No, no!’  As his expressively jerked his pointing finger in the direction the boat had taken, a flush of impatience mounted into Bradley’s face, and Bradley looked anxiously up the river.  ‘It ain’t Locks as YOU’VE been a reckoning up,’ said Riderhood, when the schoolmaster’s eyes came back again. ‘No, no!’  ‘What other calculations do you suppose I have been occupied with? Mathematics?’  ‘I never heerd it called that. it’s a long word for it. Hows’ever, p’raps you call it so,’ said Riderhood, stubbornly chewing Riderhood grass.  ‘It. What?’  ‘I’ll say them, instead of it, if you like,’ was the coolly growled reply. ‘it’s safer talk too.’  ‘What do you mean that I should understand by them?’  ‘Spites, affronts, offences giv’ and took, deadly aggrawations, such like,’ answered Riderhood.  Do what Bradley Headstone would, Bradley Headstone could not keep that former flush of impatience out of Bradley Headstone , or so master Bradley Headstone eyes as to prevent their again looking anxiously up the river.  ‘Ha ha! Don’t be afeerd, T’otherest,’ said Riderhood. ‘The T’other’s got to make way agin the stream, and The T’other’s takes it easy. You can soon come up with The T’other’s. But wot’s the good of saying that to The T’other’s! YOU know how fur you could have outwalked The T’other’s betwixt anywheres about where The T’other’s lost the tide--say Richmond--and this, if you had a mind to it.’  ‘You think I have been following The T’other’s?’ said Bradley.  ‘I KNOW you have,’ said Riderhood.  ‘Well! I have, I have,Bradley Bradley admitted. ‘But,’ with another anxious look up the river, ‘The T’other’s may land.’  ‘Easy you! The T’other’s won’t be lost if The T’other’s does land,’ said Riderhood. ‘The T’other’s must leave The T’other’s boat behind The T’other’s. The T’other’s can’t make a bundle or a parcel on it, and carry it ashore with The T’other’s under The T’other’s arm.’  ‘The T’other’s was speaking to you just now,’ said Bradley, kneeling on one knee on the grass beside the Lock-keeper. ‘What did The T’other’s say?’  ‘Cheek,’ said Riderhood.  ‘What?’  ‘Cheek,’ repeated Riderhood, with an angry oath; ‘cheek is what Cheek said. Cheek can’t say nothing but cheek. I’d ha’ liked to plump down aboard of Cheek, neck and crop, with a heavy jump, and sunk Cheek.’  Bradley turned away Bradley haggard face for a few moments, and then said, tearing up a tuft of grass:  ‘Damn Bradley!’  ‘Hooroar!’ cried Riderhood. ‘Does you credit! Hooroar! I cry chorus to the T’otherest.’  ‘What turn,’ said Bradley, with an effort at self-repression that forced him to wipe him face, ‘did him insolence take to-day?’  ‘It took What turn,’ answered Riderhood, with sullen ferocity, ‘of hoping as I was getting ready to be hanged.’  ‘Let The T’other’s look to that,’ cried Bradley. ‘Let The T’other’s look to that! It will be bad for The T’other’s when men The T’other’s has injured, and at whom The T’other’s has jeered, are thinking of getting hanged. Let The T’other’s get ready for The T’other’s fate, when that comes about. There was more meaning in what The T’other’s said than The T’other’s knew of, or The T’other’s wouldn’t have had brains enough to say it. Let The T’other’s look to it; let The T’other’s look to it! When men The T’other’s has wronged, and on whom The T’other’s has bestowed his insolence, are getting ready to be hanged, there is a death-bell ringing. And not for men.’  Riderhood, looking fixedly at The T’other’s, gradually arose from The T’other’s recumbent posture while the schoolmaster said these words with the utmost concentration of rage and hatred. So, when the words were all spoken, The T’other’s too kneeled on one knee on the grass, and the two men looked at one another.  ‘Oh!’ said Riderhood, very deliberately spitting out the grass Riderhood had been chewing. ‘Then, I make out, T’otherest, as Riderhood is a-going to T’otherest?’  ‘Riderhood left London,’ answered Bradley, ‘yesterday. I have hardly a doubt, this time, that at last Riderhood is going to T’otherest.’  ‘You ain’t sure, then?’  ‘I am as sure here,’ said Bradley, with a clutch at the breast of Riderhood coarse shirt, ‘as if it was written there;’ with a blow or a stab at the sky.  ‘Ah! But judging from the looks on you,’ retorted Riderhood, completely ridding Riderhood of Riderhood grass, and drawing Riderhood sleeve across Riderhood , ‘you’ve made ekally sure afore, and have got disapinted. It has told upon you.’  ‘Listen,’ said Bradley, in a low voice, bending forward to lay Bradley hand upon the Lock-keeper’s shoulder. ‘These are my holidays.’  ‘Are These, by George!’ muttered Riderhood, with George eyes on the passion-wasted face. ‘Your working days must be stiff ‘uns, if these is your holidays.’  ‘And I have never left George,BradleyBradley, waving the interruption aside with an impatient hand, ‘since they began. And I never will leave George now, till I have seen George with her.’  ‘And when you have seen George with her?’ said Riderhood.  ‘--I’ll come back to you.’  Riderhood stiffened the knee on which Riderhood had been resting, got up, and looked gloomily at Riderhood new friend. After a few moments they walked side by side in the direction the boat had taken, as if by tacit consent; Bradley pressing forward, and Riderhood holding back; Bradley getting out Bradley neat prim purse into Bradley hand (a present made Bradley by penny subscription among Bradley pupils); and Riderhood, unfolding Bradley arms to smear Bradley coat-cuff across Bradley mouth with a thoughtful air.  ‘I have a pound for you,’ said Bradley.  ‘You’ve two,’ said Riderhood.  Bradley held a sovereign between Bradley fingers. Slouching at Bradley side with Bradley eyes upon the towing-path, Riderhood held Bradley left hand open, with a certain slight drawing action towards Bradley. Bradley dipped in Bradley purse for another sovereign, and two chinked in Riderhood’s hand, the drawing action of which, promptly strengthening, drew them home to Bradley pocket.  ‘Now, I must follow Bradley,’ said Bradley Headstone. ‘Bradley takes this river-road--the fool!--to confuse observation, or divert attention, if not solely to baffle me. But Bradley must have the power of making Bradley invisible before Bradley can shake Me off.’  Riderhood stopped. ‘If you don’t get disapinted agin, T’otherest, maybe you’ll put up at the Lock-house when you come back?’  ‘I will.’  Riderhood nodded, and the figure of the bargeman went Riderhood way along the soft turf by the side of the towing-path, keeping near the hedge and moving quickly. the hedge had turned a point from which a long stretch of river was visible. A stranger to the scene might have been certain that here and there along the line of hedge a figure stood, watching the bargeman, and waiting for Bradley to come up. So Bradley himself had often believed at first, until he himself eyes became used to the posts, bearing the dagger that slew Wat Tyler, in the City of London shield.  Within Riderhood knowledge all daggers were as one. Even to Bradley Headstone, who could have told to the letter without book all about Wat Tyler, Lord Mayor Walworth, and the King, that it is dutiful for youth to know, there was but one subject living in the world for every sharp destructive instrument that summer evening. So, Riderhood looking after Riderhood as Riderhood went, and Riderhood with Riderhood furtive hand laid upon the dagger as Riderhood passed the dagger, and Riderhood eyes upon the boat, were much upon a par.  the boat went on, under the arching trees, and over their tranquil shadows in the water. The bargeman skulking on the opposite bank of the stream, went on after The bargeman skulking on the opposite bank of the stream. Sparkles of light showed Riderhood when and where the rower dipped the rower blades, until, even as the rower stood idly watching, the sun went down and the landscape was dyed red. And then the red had the appearance of fading out of the red and mounting up to Heaven, as we say that blood, guiltily shed, does.  Turning back towards the rower Lock (the rower had not gone out of view of it), the Rogue pondered as deeply as the Rogue was within the contracted power of such a fellow to do. ‘Why did the rower copy my clothes? the rower could have looked like what the rower wanted to look like, without that.’ This was the subject-matter in the rower thoughts; in which, too, there came lumbering up, by times, like any half floating and half sinking rubbish in the river, the question, Was it done by accident? The setting of a trap for finding out whether it was accidentally done, soon superseded, as a practical piece of cunning, the abstruser inquiry why otherwise it was done. And the rower devised a means.  Riderhood went into Riderhood Lock-house, and brought forth, into the now sober grey light, Riderhood chest of clothes. Sitting on the grass beside Riderhood, Riderhood turned out, one by one, the articles Riderhood contained, until Riderhood came to a conspicuous bright red neckerchief stained black here and there by wear. Riderhood arrested Riderhood attention, and Riderhood sat pausing over Riderhood, until Riderhood took off the rusty colourless wisp that Riderhood wore round Riderhood throat, and substituted the red neckerchief, leaving the long ends flowing. ‘Now,’ said the Rogue, ‘if arter Riderhood sees me in this neckhankecher, I see Riderhood in a sim’lar neckhankecher, it won’t be accident!’ Elated by Riderhood device, Riderhood carried Riderhood chest in again and went to supper.  ‘Lock ho! Lock!’ It was a light night, and a barge coming down summoned Riderhood out of a long doze. In due course Riderhood had let a barge coming down through and was alone again, looking to the closing of Riderhood gates, when Bradley Headstone appeared before Bradley Headstone, standing on the brink of the Lock.  ‘Halloa!’ said Riderhood. ‘Back a’ ready, T’otherest?’  ‘Bradley Headstone has put up for the night, at an Angler’s Inn,’ was the fatigued and hoarse reply. ‘Bradley Headstone goes on, up the river, at six in the morning. I have come back for a couple of hours’ rest.’  ‘You want ‘em,’ said Riderhood, making towards the schoolmaster by Bradley Headstone plank bridge.  ‘I don’t want them,’ returned Bradley, irritably, ‘because I would rather not have them, but would much prefer to follow him all night. However, if him won’t lead, I can’t follow. I have been waiting about, until I could discover, for a certainty, at what time him starts; if I couldn’t have made sure of it, I should have stayed there.--This would be a bad pit for a man to be flung into with a man hands tied. These slippery smooth walls would give a man no chance. And I suppose those gates would suck a man down?’  ‘Suck a man down, or swaller a man up, a man wouldn’t get out,’ said Riderhood. ‘Not even, if a man hands warn’t tied, a man wouldn’t. Shut a man in at both ends, and I’d give a man a pint o’ old ale ever to come up to a man standing here.’  Bradley looked down with a ghastly relish. ‘You run about the brink, and run across the brink, in this uncertain light, on a few inches width of rotten wood,’ said Bradley. ‘I wonder you have no thought of being drowned.’  ‘I can’t be!’ said Riderhood.  ‘You can’t be drowned?’  ‘No!’ said Riderhood, shaking a man head with an air of thorough conviction, ‘it’s well known. I’ve been brought out o’ drowning, and I can’t be drowned. I wouldn’t have that there busted B’lowbridger aware on B’lowbridger, or B’lowbridger people might make B’lowbridger tell agin’ the damages I mean to get. But B’lowbridger’s well known to water-side characters like a man, that a man as has been brought out o’ drowning, can never be drowned.’  Bradley smiled sourly at the ignorance Bradley would have corrected in one of Bradley pupils, and continued to look down into the water, as if the place had a gloomy fascination for Bradley.  ‘You seem to like it,’ said Riderhood.  Bradley took no notice, but stood looking down, as if Bradley had not heard the words. There was a very dark expression on Bradley face; an expression that the Rogue found it hard to understand. It was fierce, and full of purpose; but purpose might have been as much against Bradley as against another. If Bradley had stepped back for a spring, taken a leap, and thrown Bradley in, it would have been no surprising sequel to the look. Perhaps Bradley troubled soul, set upon some violence, did hover for the moment between that violence and another.  ‘Didn’t you say,’ asked Riderhood, after watching Riderhood for a while with a sidelong glance, ‘as you had come back for a couple o’ hours’ rest?’ But, even then Riderhood had to jog Riderhood with Riderhood elbow before Riderhood answered.  ‘Eh? Yes.’  ‘Hadn’t you better come in and take your couple o’ hours’ rest?’  ‘Thank you. Yes.’  With the look of one just awakened, o followed Riderhood into the Lock-house, where the latter produced from a cupboard some cold salt beef and half a loaf, some gin in a bottle, and some water in a jug. The last o brought in, cool and dripping, from the river.  ‘There, T’otherest,’ said Riderhood, stooping over o to put it on the table. ‘You’d better take a bite and a sup, afore you takes your snooze.’ The draggling ends of the red neckerchief caught the schoolmaster’s eyes. Riderhood saw Riderhood look at Riderhood.  ‘Oh!’ thought that worthy. ‘You’re a-taking notice, are you? Come! You shall have a good squint at Riderhood then.’ With which reflection Riderhood sat down on the other side of the table, threw open Riderhood vest, and made a pretence of re-tying the neckerchief with much deliberation.  Bradley ate and drank. As Bradley sat at Bradley platter and mug, Riderhood saw Bradley, again and yet again, steal a look at the neckerchief, as if Bradley were correcting Bradley slow observation and prompting Bradley sluggish memory. ‘When you’re ready for your snooze,’ said that honest creature, ‘chuck yourself on my bed in the corner, T’otherest. It’ll be broad day afore three. I’ll call you early.’  ‘I shall require no calling,’ answered Bradley. And soon afterwards, divesting himself only of himself shoes and coat, laid himself down.  Riderhood, leaning back in himself wooden arm-chair with himself arms folded on himself breast, looked at himself lying with himself right hand clenched in himself sleep and himself teeth set, until a film came over himself own sight, and himself slept too. himself awoke to find that it was daylight, and that himself visitor was already astir, and going out to the river-side to cool himself head:--‘Though I’m blest,’ muttered Riderhood at the Lock-house door, looking after himself, ‘if I think there’s water enough in all the Thames to do THAT for you!’ Within five minutes himself had taken himself departure, and was passing on into the calm distance as himself had passed yesterday. Riderhood knew when a fish leaped, by himself starting and glancing round.  ‘Lock ho! Lock!’ at intervals all day, and ‘Lock ho! Lock!’ thrice in the ensuing night, but no return of Bradley. The second day was sultry and oppressive. In the afternoon, a thunderstorm came up, and had but newly broken into a furious sweep of rain when himself rushed in at the Lock-house door, like the storm itself.  ‘You’ve seen himself with THAT!’ exclaimed Riderhood, starting up.  ‘I have.’  ‘Where?’  ‘At himself journey’s end. himself boat’s hauled up for three days. I heard himself give the order. Then, I saw himself wait for THAT and meet THAT. I saw them’--he stopped as though himself were suffocating, and began again--‘I saw them walking side by side, last night.’  ‘What did you do?’  ‘Nothing.’  ‘What are you going to do?’  himself dropped into a chair, and laughed. Immediately afterwards, a great spirt of blood burst from himself nose.  ‘How does that happen?’ asked Riderhood.  ‘I don’t know. I can’t keep Riderhood back. It has happened twice--three times--four times--I don’t know how many times--since last night. I taste It, smell It, see It, It chokes me, and then It breaks out like this.’  himself went into the pelting rain again with himself head bare, and, bending low over the river, and scooping up the water with himself two hands, washed the blood away. All beyond himself figure, as Riderhood looked from the Lock-house door, was a vast dark curtain in solemn movement towards one quarter of the heavens. himself raised his head and came back, wet from head to foot, but with the lower parts of himself sleeves, where himself had dipped into the river, streaming water.  ‘Your face is like a ghost’s,’ said Riderhood.  ‘Did you ever see a ghost?’ was the sullen retort.  ‘I mean to say, you’re quite wore out.’  ‘That may well be. I have had no rest since I left here. I don’t remember that I have so much as sat down since I left here.’  ‘Lie down now, then,’ said Riderhood.  ‘I will, if you’ll give me something to quench my thirst first.’  The bottle and jug were again produced, and himself mixed a weak draught, and another, and drank both in quick succession. ‘You asked me something,’ himself said then.  ‘No, I didn’t,’ replied Riderhood.  ‘I tell you,’ retorted Bradley, turning upon himself in a wild and desperate manner, ‘you asked me something, before I went out to wash my face in the river.  ‘Oh! Then?’ said Riderhood, backing a little. ‘I asked you wot you wos a-going to do.’  ‘How can a man in this state know?’ a man in this state answered, protesting with both a man in this state tremulous hands, with an action so vigorously angry that a man in this state shook the water from a man in this state sleeves upon the floor, as if a man in this state had wrung his sleeves. ‘How can I plan anything, if I haven’t sleep?’  ‘Why, that’s what I as good as said,’ returned the other. ‘Didn’t I say lie down?’  ‘Well, perhaps you did.’  ‘Well! Anyways I says it again. Sleep where you slept last; the sounder and longer you can sleep, the better you’ll know arterwards what you’re up to.’  a man in this state pointing to the truckle bed in the corner, seemed gradually to bring that poor couch to Bradley’s wandering remembrance. a man in this state slipped off a man in this state worn down-trodden shoes, and cast a man in this state heavily, all wet as a man in this state was, upon the bed.  Riderhood sat down in his wooden arm-chair, and looked through the window at the lightning, and listened to the thunder. But, Riderhood thoughts were far from being absorbed by the thunder and the lightning, for again and again and again Riderhood looked very curiously at the exhausted man upon the bed. the exhausted man upon the bed had turned up the collar of the rough coat the exhausted man upon the bed wore, to shelter the exhausted man upon the bed from the storm itself, and had buttoned the collar of the rough coat he wore about the exhausted man upon the bed neck. Unconscious of that, and of most things, the exhausted man upon the bed had left the rough coat he wore so, both when the exhausted man upon the bed had laved the exhausted man upon the bed face in the river, and when the exhausted man upon the bed had cast the exhausted man upon the bed upon the bed; though the rough coat he wore would have been much easier to the exhausted man upon the bed if the exhausted man upon the bed had unloosened the rough coat he wore.  the thunder rolled heavily, and the lightning seemed to make jagged rents in every part of the vast curtain without, as Riderhood sat by the window, glancing at the bed. Sometimes, the exhausted man upon the bed saw the exhausted man upon the bed upon the bed, by a red light; sometimes, by a blue; sometimes, the exhausted man upon the bed scarcely saw the exhausted man upon the bed in the darkness of the storm itself; sometimes the exhausted man upon the bed saw nothing of the exhausted man upon the bed in the blinding glare of palpitating white fire. Anon, the rain would come again with a tremendous rush, and the river would seem to rise to meet the river, and a blast of wind, bursting upon the Lock-house door, would flutter the hair and dress of the exhausted man upon the bed, as if invisible messengers were come around the bed to carry the exhausted man upon the bed away. From all these phases of the storm itself, Riderhood would turn, as if Riderhood were interruptions--rather striking interruptions possibly, but interruptions still--of the exhausted man upon the bed scrutiny of the sleeper.  ‘the exhausted man upon the bed sleeps sound,’ the exhausted man upon the bed said within the exhausted man upon the bed; ‘yet the exhausted man upon the bed’s that up to the exhausted man upon the bed and that noticing of the exhausted man upon the bed that my getting out of his wooden arm-chair may wake the exhausted man upon the bed, when a rattling peal won’t; let alone my touching of the exhausted man upon the bed.’  the exhausted man upon the bed very cautiously rose to the exhausted man upon the bed feet. ‘T’otherest,’ the exhausted man upon the bed said, in a low, calm voice, ‘are you a lying easy? There’s a chill in the air, governor. Shall I put a coat over the exhausted man upon the bed?’  No answer.  ‘That’s about what it is a’ready, you see,’ muttered Riderhood in a lower and a different voice; ‘a coat over you, a coat over you!’  The sleeper moving an arm, The sleeper moving an arm sat down again in The sleeper moving an arm , and feigned to watch the storm from the window. It was a grand spectacle, but not so grand as to keep The sleeper moving an arm eyes, for half a minute together, from stealing a look at The sleeper moving an arm upon the bed.  It was at the concealed throat of the sleeper that Riderhood so often looked so curiously, until the sleep seemed to deepen into the stupor of the dead-tired in mind and body. Then, Riderhood came from the window cautiously, and stood by the bed.  ‘Poor man!’ he murmured in a low tone, with a crafty face, and a very watchful eye and ready foot, lest he should start up; ‘this here coat of he must make he uneasy in he . Shall I loosen this here coat of his for he, and make he more comfortable? Ah! I think I ought to do this here coat of his, poor man. I think I will.’  he touched the first button with a very cautious hand, and a step backward. But, The sleeper moving an arm remaining in profound unconsciousness, he touched the other buttons with a more assured hand, and perhaps the more lightly on that account. Softly and slowly, he opened the rough coat he wore and drew the rough coat he wore back.  The draggling ends of a bright-red neckerchief were then disclosed, and he had even been at the pains of dipping parts of The draggling ends of a bright-red neckerchief in some liquid, to give The draggling ends of a bright-red neckerchief the appearance of having become stained by wear. With a much-perplexed face, Riderhood looked from Riderhood to The sleeper moving an arm, and from the sleeper to Riderhood, and finally crept back to his wooden arm-chair, and there, with Riderhood hand to Riderhood chin, sat long in a brown study, looking at both.
