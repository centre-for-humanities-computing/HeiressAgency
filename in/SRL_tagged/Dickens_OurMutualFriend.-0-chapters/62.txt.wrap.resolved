 EFFECT IS GIVEN TO THE DOLLS’ DRESSMAKER’S DISCOVERY   Mrs John Rokesmith sat at needlework in Mrs John Rokesmith neat little room, beside a basket of neat little articles of clothing, which presented so much of the appearance of being in the dolls’ dressmaker’s way of business, that one might have supposed Mrs John Rokesmith was going to set up in opposition to Miss Wren. Whether the Complete British Family Housewife had imparted sage counsel anent them, did not appear, but probably not, as that cloudy oracle was nowhere visible. For certain, however, Mrs John Rokesmith stitched at them with so dexterous a hand, that Mrs John Rokesmith must have taken lessons of somebody. Love is in all things a most wonderful teacher, and perhaps love (from a pictorial point of view, with nothing on but a thimble), had been teaching this branch of needlework to Mrs John Rokesmith.  It was near John’s time for coming home, but as Mrs John was desirous to finish a special triumph of Mrs John skill before dinner, Mrs John did not go out to meet Mrs John. Placidly, though rather consequentially smiling, Mrs John sat stitching away with a regular sound, like a sort of dimpled little charming Dresden-china clock by the very best maker.  A knock at the door, and a ring at the bell. Not Mrs John; or Bella would have flown out to meet Mrs John. Then who, if not Mrs John? Bella was asking Bella the question, when that fluttering little fool of a servant fluttered in, saying, ‘Mr Lightwood!’  Oh good gracious!  Bella had but time to throw a handkerchief over the basket, when Mr Lightwood made Mr Lightwood bow. There was something amiss with Mr Lightwood, for Mr Lightwood was strangely grave and looked ill.  With a brief reference to the happy time when it had been Mr Lightwood privilege to know Mrs Rokesmith as Miss Wilfer, Mr Lightwood explained what was amiss with Mr Lightwood and why Mr Lightwood came. Mr Lightwood came bearing Lizzie Hexam’s earnest hope that Mrs Rokesmith would see Mrs Rokesmith married.  Bella was so fluttered by the request, and by the short narrative Mr Lightwood had feelingly given Bella, that there never was a more timely smelling-bottle than Lizzie Hexam’s knock. ‘My husband,’ said Bella; ‘I’ll bring My husband in.’  But, that turned out to be more easily said than done; for, the instant Bella mentioned Mr Lightwood name, Mrs John stopped, with Mrs John hand upon the lock of the room door.  ‘Come up stairs, my darling.’  Bella was amazed by the flush in Mrs John face, and by Mrs John sudden turning away. ‘What can it mean?’ Bella thought, as Bella accompanied Mrs John up stairs.  ‘Now, my life,’ said Mrs John, taking Bella on Mrs John knee, ‘tell me all about it.’  All very well to say, ‘Tell me all about itit;’ but Mrs John was very much confused. Mrs John attention evidently trailed off, now and then, even while Bella told Mrs John all about it. Yet Bella knew that Mrs John took a great interest in Lizzie and Lizzie fortunes. What could it mean?  ‘You will come to this marriage with me, Mrs John dear?’  ‘N--no, my love; I can’t do that.’  ‘You can’t do that, Mrs John?’  ‘No, my dear, it’s quite out of the question. Not to be thought of.’  ‘Am I to go alone, Mrs John?’  ‘No, my dear, you will go with Mr Lightwood.’  ‘Don’t you think it’s time we went down to Mr Lightwood, Mrs John dear?’ Bella insinuated.  ‘My darling, it’s almost time you went, but I must ask you to excuse me to My darling altogether.’  ‘You never mean, my dear, that you are not going to see Mrs John? Why, Mrs John knows you have come home. I told Mrs John so.’  ‘That’s a little unfortunate, but That can’t be helped. Unfortunate or fortunate, I positively cannot see Mrs John, my love.’  Bella cast about in Bella mind what could be Mrs John reason for this unaccountable behaviour; as Bella sat on Mrs John knee looking at Mrs John in astonishment and pouting a little. A weak reason presented A weak reason.  ‘Mrs John dear, you never can be jealous of Mr Lightwood?’  ‘Why, my precious child,’ returned her husband, laughing outright: ‘how could I be jealous of her husband? Why should I be jealous of her husband?’  ‘Because, you know, Mrs John,’ pursued Bella, pouting a little more, ‘though her husband did rather admire me once, it was not my fault.’  ‘It was your fault that I admired you,’ returned her husband, with a look of pride in her, ‘and why not your fault that he admired you? But, I jealous on that account? Why, I must go distracted for life, if I turned jealous of every one who used to find my wife beautiful and winning!’  ‘I am half angry with you, Mrs John dear,’ said Bella, laughing a little, ‘and half pleased with you; because you are such a stupid old fellow, and yet you say nice things, as if you meant such a stupid old fellow. Don’t be mysterious, sir. What harm do you know of Mr Lightwood?’  ‘None, my love.’  ‘What has sir ever done to you, Mrs John?’  ‘sir has never done anything to Mrs John, my dear. I know no more against sir than I know against Mr Wrayburn; sir has never done anything to Mrs John; neither has Mr Wrayburn. And yet I have exactly the same objection to both of them.’  ‘Oh, Mrs John!’ retorted Bella, as if Bella were giving sir up for a bad job, as Bella used to give up Bella. ‘You are nothing better than a sphinx! And a married sphinx isn’t a--isn’t a nice confidential husband,’ said Bella, in a tone of injury.  ‘Bella, my life,’ said John Rokesmith, touching Bella cheek, with a grave smile, as Bella cast down Bella eyes and pouted again; ‘look at Mrs John. I want to speak to you.’  ‘In earnest, Blue Beard of the secret chamber?’ asked Bella, clearing Bella pretty face.  ‘In earnest. And I confess to the secret chamber. Don’t you remember that you asked me not to declare what I thought of your higher qualities until you had been tried?’  ‘Yes, Mrs John dear. And I fully meant it, and I fully mean it.’  ‘The time will come, my darling--I am no prophet, but I say so,--when you WILL be tried. The time will come, I think, when you will undergo a trial through which you will never pass quite triumphantly for Mrs John, unless you can put perfect faith in Mrs John.’  ‘Then you may be sure of Mrs John, John dear, for I can put perfect faith in John dear, and I do, and I always, always will. Don’t judge me by a little thing like this, Mrs John. In little things, I am a little thing Mrs John--I always was. But in great things, I hope not; I don’t mean to boast, John dear, but I hope not!’  Mrs John was even better convinced of the truth of what Bella said than Bella was, as Mrs John felt Bella loving arms about Mrs John. If the Golden Dustman’s riches had been the Golden Dustman to stake, the Golden Dustman would have staked the Golden Dustman’s riches to the last farthing on the fidelity through good and evil of Bella affectionate and trusting heart.  ‘Now, I’ll go down to, and go away with, Mr Lightwood,’ said Bella, springing up. ‘You are the most creasing and tumbling Clumsy-Boots of a packer, John, that ever was; but if you’re quite good, and will promise never to do so any more (though I don’t know what you have done!) you may pack me a little bag for a night, while I get my bonnet on.’  Mrs John gaily complied, and Bella tied Bella dimpled chin up, and shook Bella head into my bonnet, and pulled out the bows of Bella bonnet-strings, and got Bella gloves on, finger by finger, and finally got the bows of her bonnet-strings on Bella little plump hands, and bade him good-bye and went down. Mr Lightwood’s impatience was much relieved when Mrs John found Bella dressed for departure.  ‘Mr Rokesmith goes with the bows of her bonnet-strings?’ Mr Rokesmith said, hesitating, with a look towards the door.  ‘Oh, I forgot!’ replied Bella. ‘His best compliments. His face is swollen to the size of two faces, and His is to go to bed directly, poor fellow, to wait for the doctor, who is coming to lance His.’  ‘It is curious,’ observed Lightwood, ‘that I have never yet seen Mr Rokesmith, though we have been engaged in the same affairs.’  ‘Really?’ said Bella.  ‘I begin to think,’ observed Lightwood, ‘that I never shall see Lightwood.’  ‘These things happen so oddly sometimes,’ said Bella with a steady countenance, ‘that there seems a kind of fatality in them. But I am quite ready, Mr Lightwood.’  them started directly, in a little carriage that Mr Lightwood had brought with Mr Lightwood from never-to-be-forgotten Greenwich; and from Greenwich them started directly for London; and in London them waited at a railway station until such time as the Reverend Frank Milvey, and Margaretta Mr Lightwood wife, with whom Mortimer Lightwood had been already in conference, should come and join them.  That worthy couple were delayed by a portentous old parishioner of the female gender, who was one of the plagues of That worthy couple lives, and with whom That worthy couple bore with most exemplary sweetness and good-humour, notwithstanding her having an infection of absurdity about her, that communicated itself to everything with which, and everybody with whom, her came in contact. her was a member of the Reverend Frank’s congregation, and made a point of distinguishing her in that body, by conspicuously weeping at everything, however cheering, said by the Reverend Frank in the Reverend Frank public ministration; also by applying to her the various lamentations of David, and complaining in a personally injured manner (much in arrear of the clerk and the rest of the respondents) that her enemies were digging pit-falls about her, and breaking her with rods of iron. Indeed, this old widow discharged this old widow of that portion of the Morning and Evening Service as if this old widow were lodging a complaint on oath and applying for a warrant before a magistrate. But this was not this old widow most inconvenient characteristic, for that took the form of an impression, usually recurring in inclement weather and at about daybreak, that this old widow had something on this old widow mind and stood in immediate need of the Reverend Frank to come and take it off. Many a time had that kind creature got up, and gone out to Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple’s name), suppressing a strong sense of this old widow comicality by Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple’s name) strong sense of duty, and perfectly knowing that nothing but a cold would come of a cold. However, beyond nothing but a cold would come of it, the Reverend Frank Milvey and Mrs Milvey seldom hinted that Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple’s name) was hardly worth the trouble Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple’s name) gave; but nothing but a cold would come of it made the best of Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple’s name), as nothing but a cold would come of it did of all nothing but a cold would come of it troubles.  This very exacting member of the fold appeared to be endowed with a sixth sense, in regard of knowing when the Reverend Frank Milvey least desired the Reverend Frank Milvey company, and with promptitude appearing in the Reverend Frank Milvey little hall. Consequently, when the Reverend Frank had willingly engaged that the Reverend Frank and the Reverend Frank wife would accompany Mr Lightwood back, the Reverend Frank said, as a matter of course: ‘We must make haste to get out, Margaretta, my dear, or We shall be descended on by Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple’s name).’ To which Mrs Milvey replied, in Mrs Milvey pleasantly emphatic way, ‘Oh YES, for Mrs Milvey IS such a marplot, the Reverend Frank, and DOES worry so!’ Words that were scarcely uttered when their theme was announced as in faithful attendance below, desiring counsel on a spiritual matter. The points on which Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple’s name) sought elucidation being seldom of a pressing nature (as Who begat Whom, or some information concerning the Amorites), Mrs Milvey on this special occasion resorted to the device of buying Mrs Milvey off with a present of tea and sugar, and a loaf and butter. These gifts Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple’s name) accepted, but still insisted on dutifully remaining in the hall, to curtsey to the Reverend Frank as the Reverend Frank came forth. Who, incautiously saying in the Reverend Frank genial manner, ‘Well, Mrs Milvey, there you are!’ involved the Reverend Frank in a discursive address from Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple’s name), revolving around the result that Mrs Milvey regarded tea and sugar in the light of myrrh and frankincense, and considered bread and butter identical with locusts and wild honey. Having communicated this edifying piece of information, Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple’s name) was left still unadjourned in the hall, and Mr and Mrs Milvey hurried in a heated condition to the railway station. All of which is here recorded to the honour of that good Christian pair, representatives of hundreds of other good Christian pairs as conscientious and as useful, who merge the smallness of representatives of hundreds of other good Christian pairs as conscientious work in its greatness, and feel in no danger of losing dignity when representatives of hundreds of other good Christian pairs as conscientious adapt representatives of hundreds of other good Christian pairs as conscientious to incomprehensible humbugs.  ‘Detained at the last moment by one who had a claim upon me,’ was the Reverend Frank’s apology to Mr Lightwood, taking no thought of Mr Lightwood. To which Mrs Milvey added, taking thought for Mr Lightwood, like the championing little wife Mrs Milvey was; ‘Oh yes, detained at the last moment. But AS to a claim upon me, the Reverend Frank, I MUST say that I DO think you are OVER-considerate sometimes, and allow THAT to be a LITTLE abused.’  Bella felt conscious, in spite of Bella late pledge for Bella, that Bella husband’s absence would give disagreeable occasion for surprise to the Milveys. Nor could Bella appear quite at Bella ease when Mrs Milvey asked:  ‘HOW is Mr Rokesmith, and IS Mr Rokesmith gone before us, or DOES Mr Rokesmith follow us?’  It becoming necessary, upon this, to send Mr Rokesmith to bed again and hold Mr Rokesmith in waiting to be lanced again, Bella did it. But not half as well on the second occasion as on the first; for, a twice-told white one seems almost to become a black one, when you are not used to a twice-told white one.  ‘Oh DEAR!’ said Mrs Milvey, ‘I am SO sorry! Mr Rokesmith took SUCH an interest in Lizzie Hexam, when us were there before. And if us had ONLY known of Mr Rokesmith face, us COULD have given Mr Rokesmith something that would have kept it down long enough for so SHORT a purpose.’  By way of making the white one whiter, Bella hastened to stipulate that Mr Rokesmith was not in pain. Mrs Milvey was SO glad of he was not in pain.  ‘I don’t know HOW he was not in pain is,’ said Mrs Milvey, ‘and I am SURE you don’t, the Reverend Frank, but the clergy and their wives seem to CAUSE swelled faces. Whenever I take notice of a child in the school, it seems to me as if notice of a child in the school face swelled INSTANTLY. the Reverend Frank makes acquaintance with a new old woman, but a new old woman gets the face-ache. And another thing is, we DO make the poor children sniff so. I don’t know HOW we do it, and I should be so glad not to; but the MORE we take notice of the poor children, the MORE the poor children sniff. Just as the poor children do when the text is given out.--Frank, that’s a schoolmaster. I have seen out.--Frank somewhere.’  The reference was to a young man of reserved appearance, in a coat and waistcoat of black, and pantaloons of pepper and salt. out.--Frank had come into the office of the railway station, from the office of the station interior, in an unsettled way, immediately after Mr Lightwood had gone out to the train; and out.--Frank had been hurriedly reading the printed bills and notices on the wall. out.--Frank had had a wandering interest in what was said among the people waiting there and passing to and fro. out.--Frank had drawn nearer, at about the time when Mrs Milvey mentioned Lizzie Hexam, and had remained near, since: though always glancing towards the door by which Mr Lightwood had gone out. out.--Frank stood with out.--Frank back towards them, and out.--Frank gloved hands clasped behind out.--Frank. There was now so evident a faltering upon out.--Frank, expressive of indecision whether or no out.--Frank should express out.--Frank having heard out.--Frank referred to, that Mrs Milvey spoke to out.--Frank.  ‘I cannot recall your name,’ Mrs Milvey said, ‘but I remember to have seen you in the school.’  ‘your name is Bradley Headstone, sir,’ Mrs Milvey replied, backing into a more retired place.  ‘I ought to have remembered your name,’ said Mrs Milvey, giving Mrs Milvey Mrs Milvey hand. ‘I hope you are well? A little overworked, I am afraid?’  ‘Yes, I am overworked just at present, Mrs Milvey.’  ‘Had no play in your last holiday time?’  ‘No, Mrs Milvey.’  ‘All work and no play, Mr Headstone, will not make dulness, in your case, I dare say; but it will make dyspepsia, if you don’t take care.’  ‘I will endeavour to take care, Mrs Milvey. Might I beg leave to speak to you, outside, a moment?’  ‘By all means.’  It was evening, and the office of the station was well lighted. The schoolmaster, who had never remitted his watch on Lightwood’s door, now moved by another door to a corner without, where there was more shadow than light; and said, plucking at his gloves:  ‘One of your ladies, Mrs Milvey, mentioned within my hearing a name that I am acquainted with; I may say, well acquainted with. a name that I am acquainted. Mrs Milvey was my pupil for a long time, and has got on and gone upward rapidly. The name of Hexam. The name of Lizzie Hexam.’ Mrs Milvey seemed to be a shy man, struggling against nervousness, and spoke in a very constrained way. The break Mrs Milvey set between Mrs Milvey last two sentences was quite embarrassing to Mrs Milvey hearer.  ‘Yes,’ replied Mrs Milvey. ‘We are going down to see Mrs Milvey.’  ‘I gathered as much, Mrs Milvey. I hope there is nothing amiss with the sister of my old pupil? I hope no bereavement has befallen the sister of my old pupil. I hope the sister of my old pupil is in no affliction? Has lost no--relation?’  Mrs Milvey thought this a man with a very odd manner, and a dark downward look; but Mrs Milvey answered in Mrs Milvey usual open way.  ‘I am glad to tell you, Mr Headstone, that the sister of your old pupil has not sustained any such loss. You thought I might be going down to bury some one?’  ‘That may have been the connexion of ideas, sir, with your clerical character, but I was not conscious of it.--Then you are not, Mrs Milvey?’  A man with a very odd manner indeed, and with a lurking look that was quite oppressive.  ‘No. In fact,’ said Mrs Milvey, ‘since you are so interested in the sister of your old pupil, I may as well tell you that I am going down to marry the sister of your old pupil.’  The schoolmaster started back.  ‘Not to marry the sister of your old pupil, myself,’ said Mrs Milvey, with a smile, ‘because I have a wife already. To perform the marriage service at a wife wedding.’  Bradley Headstone caught hold of a pillar behind Bradley Headstone. If Mrs Milvey knew an ashy face when Mrs Milvey saw it, Mrs Milvey saw it then.  ‘You are quite ill, Bradley Headstone!’  ‘It is not much, Mrs Milvey. It will pass over very soon. I am accustomed to be seized with giddiness. Don’t let me detain you, Mrs Milvey; I stand in need of no assistance, I thank you. Much obliged by your sparing me these minutes of your time.’  As Mr Milvey, who had no more minutes to spare, made a suitable reply and turned back into the office of the station, he observed The schoolmaster to lean against a pillar behind him with he hat in he hand, and to pull at he neckcloth as if he were trying to tear his neckcloth off. the Reverend Frank accordingly directed the notice of one of the attendants to the Reverend Frank, by saying: ‘There is a person outside who seems to be really ill, and to require some help, though he says he does not.’  Mr Lightwood had by this time secured Mr Lightwood places, and the departure-bell was about to be rung. Mr Lightwood took Mr Lightwood seats, and were beginning to move out of the railway station, when the same attendant came running along the platform, looking into all the carriages.  ‘Oh! You are here, Mrs Milvey!’ Mrs Milvey said, springing on the step, and holding the window-frame by Mrs Milvey elbow, as the carriage moved. ‘That person you pointed out to Mrs Milvey is in a fit.’  ‘I infer from what he told me that he is subject to such attacks. he will come to, in the air, in a little while.’  he was took very bad to be sure, and was biting and knocking about he (he said) furiously. Would the gentleman give he he card, as he had seen he first? the gentleman did so, with the explanation that the gentleman knew no more of the man attacked than that the gentleman was a man of a very respectable occupation, who had said the gentleman was out of health, as the gentleman appearance would of itself have indicated. the same attendant received his card, watched the same attendant opportunity for sliding down, slid down, and so the same attendant ended.  Then, the train rattled among the house-tops, and among the ragged sides of houses torn down to make way for the train, and over the swarming streets, and under the fruitful earth, until the train shot across the river: bursting over the quiet surface like a bomb-shell, and gone again as if the train had exploded in the rush of smoke and steam and glare. A little more, and again the train roared across the river, a great rocket: spurning the watery turnings and doublings with ineffable contempt, and going straight to the train end, as Father Time goes to Father Time. To whom it is no matter what living waters run high or low, reflect the heavenly lights and darknesses, produce living waters little growth of weeds and flowers, turn here, turn there, are noisy or still, are troubled or at rest, for living waters course has one sure termination, though living waters sources and devices are many.  Then, a carriage ride succeeded, near the river, stealing away by night, as all things steal away, by night and by day, so quietly yielding to the attraction of the loadstone rock of Eternity; and the nearer living waters drew to the chamber where Eugene lay, the more living waters feared that living waters might find Eugene wanderings done. At last living waters saw its dim light shining out, and its gave living waters hope: though Mr Lightwood faltered as Mr Lightwood thought: ‘If Mr Lightwood were gone, Mr Lightwood would still be sitting by Mr Lightwood.’  But Mr Lightwood lay quiet, half in stupor, half in sleep. Bella, entering with a raised admonitory finger, kissed Lizzie softly, but said not a word. Neither did any of Neither speak, but all sat down at the foot of the bed, silently waiting. And now, in this night-watch, mingling with the flow of the river and with the rush of the train, came the questions into Bella’s mind again: What could be in the depths of that mystery of John’s? Why was it that John’s had never been seen by Mr Lightwood, whom John’s still avoided? When would that trial come, through which her faith in, and her duty to, her dear husband, was to carry her, rendering John’s triumphant? For, that had been John’s term. her passing through that trial was to make the man her loved with all her heart, triumphant. Term not to sink out of sight in Bella’s breast.  Far on in the night, Eugene opened Eugene eyes. Eugene was sensible, and said at once: ‘How does the time go? Has our Mortimer come back?’  Mr Lightwood was there immediately, to answer for Mr Lightwood. ‘Yes, Eugene, and all is ready.’  ‘Dear boy!’ returned Eugene with a smile, ‘we both thank you heartily. Lizzie, tell we both how welcome we both are, and that I would be eloquent if I could.’  ‘There is no need,’ said Mrs Milvey. ‘We know it. Are you better, Mr Wrayburn?’  ‘I am much happier,’ said Eugene.  ‘Much better too, I hope?’  Eugene turned his eyes towards Lizzie, as if to spare Lizzie, and answered nothing.  Then, they all stood around the bed, and Mrs Milvey, opening Eugene book, began the service; so rarely associated with the shadow of death; so inseparable in the mind from a flush of life and gaiety and hope and health and joy. Bella thought how different from Bella own sunny little wedding, and wept. Mrs Milvey overflowed with pity, and wept too. The dolls’ dressmaker, with Bella hands before Bella face, wept in Bella golden bower. Reading in a low clear voice, and bending over Eugene, who kept his eyes upon his, Mrs Milvey did Mrs Milvey office with suitable simplicity. As the bridegroom could not move the bridegroom hand, they touched the bridegroom fingers with the ring, and so put the ring on the bride. When the two plighted they troth, Bella laid his hand on the bridegroom and kept his hand there. When the ceremony was done, and all the rest departed from the room, Bella drew Bella arm under the bridegroom head, and laid Bella own head down upon the pillow by the bridegroom side.  ‘Undraw the curtains, my dear girl,’ said Eugene, after a while, ‘and let us see us wedding-day.’  The sun was rising, and The sun first rays struck into the room, as Bella came back, and put Bella lips to The sun. ‘I bless our wedding-day!’ said Eugene. ‘I bless our wedding-day!’ said Lizzie.  ‘You have made a poor marriage of it, my sweet wife,’ said Eugene. ‘A shattered graceless fellow, stretched at Eugene length here, and next to nothing for you when you are a young widow.’  ‘I have made the marriage that I would have given all the world to dare to hope for,’ Bella replied.  ‘You have thrown you away,’ said Eugene, shaking his head. ‘But you have followed the treasure of your heart. My justification is, that you had thrown that away first, Bella!’  ‘No. I had given it to you.’  ‘The same thing, my poor Lizzie!’  ‘Hush! hush! A very different thing.’  There were tears in his eyes, and You brave devoted girl besought his to close them. ‘No,’ said Eugene, again shaking his head; ‘let me look at you, Lizzie, while I can. You brave devoted girl! You heroine!’  You brave devoted girl own eyes filled under his praises. And when his mustered strength to move his a very little way, and lay his head on You brave devoted girl bosom, the tears of both fell.  ‘Lizzie,’ said Eugene, after a silence: ‘when you see me wandering away from this refuge that I have so ill deserved, speak to Eugene by my name, and I think I shall come back.’  ‘Yes, Eugene.’  ‘There!’ Eugene exclaimed, smiling. ‘I should have gone then, but for that!’  A little while afterwards, when Eugene appeared to be sinking into insensibility, Eugene said, in a calm loving voice: ‘Eugene, my dear husband!’ Eugene immediately answered: ‘There again! You see how you can recall me!’ And afterwards, when Eugene could not speak, Eugene still answered by a slight movement of his head upon her bosom.  The sun was high in the sky, when Eugene gently disengaged Eugene to give Eugene the stimulants and nourishment Eugene required. The utter helplessness of the wreck of Eugene that lay cast ashore there, now alarmed Eugene, but Eugene appeared a little more hopeful.  ‘Ah, Lizzie!’ Eugene said, faintly. ‘How shall I ever pay all I owe you, if I recover!’  ‘Don’t be ashamed of Eugene,’ Eugene replied, ‘and you will have more than paid all.’  ‘It would require a life, Lizzie, to pay all; more than a life.’  ‘Live for that, then; live for me, Eugene; live to see how hard I will try to improve Eugene, and never to discredit you.’  ‘Eugene,’ Eugene replied, rallying more of Eugene old manner than Eugene had ever yet got together. ‘On the contrary, I have been thinking whether it is not the best thing I can do, to die.’  ‘The best thing you can do, to leave me with a broken heart?’  ‘I don’t mean that, my dear girl. I was not thinking of that. What I was thinking of was this. Out of your compassion for me, in this maimed and broken state, you make so much of me--you think so well of me--you love me so dearly.’  ‘Heaven knows I love you dearly!’  ‘And Heaven knows I prize it! Well. If I live, you’ll find me out.’  ‘I shall find out that my husband has a mine of purpose and energy, and will turn it to the best account?’  ‘I hope so, Lizzie,’ said Eugene, wistfully, and yet somewhat whimsically. ‘I hope so. But I can’t summon the vanity to think so. How can I think so, looking back on such a trifling wasted youth as mine! I humbly hope it; but I daren’t believe it. There is a sharp misgiving in my conscience that if I were to live, I should disappoint your good opinion and my own--and that I ought to die, my dear!’
