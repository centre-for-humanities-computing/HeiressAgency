 PERSONS AND THINGS IN GENERAL   Mr and Mrs John Harmon’s first delightful occupation was, to set all matters right that had strayed in any way wrong, or that might, could, would, or should, have strayed in any way wrong, while their name was in abeyance. In tracing out affairs for which John’s fictitious death was to be considered in any way responsible, their used a very broad and free construction; regarding, for instance, the dolls’ dressmaker as having a claim on their protection, because of her association with Mrs Eugene Wrayburn, and because of Mrs Eugene’s old association, in her turn, with the dark side of the story. It followed that the old man, Riah, as a good and serviceable friend to both, was not to be disclaimed. Nor even Mr Inspector, as having been trepanned into an industrious hunt on a false scent. It may be remarked, in connexion with that worthy officer, that a rumour shortly afterwards pervaded the Force, to the effect that he had confided to Miss Abbey Potterson, over a jug of mellow flip in the bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, that he ‘didn’t stand to lose a farthing’ through Mr Harmon’s coming to life, but was quite as well satisfied as if that gentleman had been barbarously murdered, and that gentleman (Mr Inspector) had pocketed the government reward.  In all their arrangements of such nature, Mr and Mrs John Harmon derived much assistance from their eminent solicitor, Mr Mortimer Lightwood; who laid about Mrs John Harmon professionally with such unwonted despatch and intention, that a piece of work was vigorously pursued as soon as cut out; whereby Young Blight was acted on as by that transatlantic dram which is poetically named An Eye-Opener, and found Mrs John Harmon staring at real clients instead of out of window. The accessibility of Riah proving very useful as to a few hints towards the disentanglement of Eugene’s affairs, Lightwood applied Lightwood with infinite zest to attacking and harassing Mr Fledgeby: who, discovering Lightwood in danger of being blown into the air by certain explosive transactions in which Lightwood had been engaged, and having been sufficiently flayed under Lightwood beating, came to a parley and asked for quarter. The harmless Twemlow profited by the conditions entered into, though Lightwood little thought The harmless Twemlow profited by the conditions. Riah unaccountably melted; waited in person on Riah over the stable yard in Duke Street, St James’s, no longer ravening but mild, to inform Riah that payment of interest as heretofore, but henceforth at Lightwood’s offices, would appease Riah Jewish rancour; and departed with the secret that Mr John Harmon had advanced the money and become the creditor. Thus, was the sublime Snigsworth’s wrath averted, and thus did Snigsworth snort no larger amount of moral grandeur at the Corinthian column in the print over the fireplace, than was normally in Snigsworth (and the British) constitution.   Mrs Wilfer’s first visit to the Mendicant’s bride at the new abode of Mendicancy, was a grand event. Pa had been sent for into the City, on the very day of taking possession, and had been stunned with astonishment, and brought-to, and led about the house by one ear, to behold the house various treasures, and had been enraptured and enchanted. Pa had also been appointed Secretary, and had been enjoined to give instant notice of resignation to Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles, for ever and ever. But Ma came later, and came, as was Ma due, in state.  The carriage was sent for Ma, who entered The carriage with a bearing worthy of the occasion, accompanied, rather than supported, by Miss Lavinia, who altogether declined to recognize the maternal majesty. Mr George Sampson meekly followed. Mr George Sampson was received in the vehicle, by Mrs Wilfer, as if admitted to the honour of assisting at a funeral in the family, and Mrs Wilfer then issued the order, ‘Onward!’ to the Mendicant’s menial.  ‘I wish to goodness, Ma,’ said Lavvy, throwing Ma back among the cushions, with Ma arms crossed, ‘that you’d loll a little.’  ‘How!’ repeated Mrs Wilfer. ‘Loll!’  ‘Yes, Ma.’  ‘I hope,’ said Ma, ‘I am incapable of it.’  ‘I am sure you look so, Ma. But why one should go out to dine with one’s own daughter or sister, as if one’s under-petticoat was a blackboard, I do NOT understand.’  ‘Neither do I understand,’ retorted Mrs Wilfer, with deep scorn, ‘how a young lady can mention the garment in the name of which you have indulged. I blush for you.’  ‘Thank you, Ma,’ said Lavvy, yawning, ‘but I can do it for Ma, I am obliged to you, when there’s any occasion.’  Here, Mr Sampson, with the view of establishing harmony, which Mr Sampson never under any circumstances succeeded in doing, said with an agreeable smile: ‘After all, you know, ma’am, we know it’s there.’ And immediately felt that he had committed he.  ‘We know it’s there!’ said Mrs Wilfer, glaring.  ‘Really, George,’ remonstrated Miss Lavinia, ‘I must say that I don’t understand your allusions, and that I think you might be more delicate and less personal.’  ‘Go it!’ cried Mr Sampson, becoming, on the shortest notice, a prey to despair. ‘Oh yes! Go it, Mrs Wilfer!’  ‘What you may mean, Mr Sampson, by your omnibus-driving expressions, I cannot pretend to imagine. Neither,’ said Miss Lavinia, ‘Mr George Sampson, do I wish to imagine. It is enough for me to know in my own heart that I am not going to--’ having imprudently got into a sentence without providing a way out of it, Miss Lavinia was constrained to close with ‘going to it’. A weak conclusion which, however, derived some appearance of strength from disdain.  ‘Oh yes!’ cried Mr Sampson, with bitterness. ‘Thus it ever is. I never--’  ‘If you mean to say,’ Miss Lavvy cut ’ Miss Lavvy short, that you never brought up a young gazelle, you may save yourself the trouble, because nobody in this carriage supposes that you ever did. We know you better.’ (As if this were a home-thrust.)  ‘Miss Lavinia,’ returned Mr Sampson, in a dismal vein, ‘I did not mean to say so. What I did mean to say, was, that I never expected to retain my favoured place in this family, after Fortune shed her beams upon her beams. Why do you take me,’ said Mr Sampson, ‘to the glittering halls with which I can never compete, and then taunt me with my moderate salary? Is it generous? Is it kind?’  The stately lady, Mrs Wilfer, perceiving her opportunity of delivering a few remarks from the throne, here took up the altercation.  ‘Mr Sampson,’ her began, ‘I cannot permit you to misrepresent the intentions of a child of mine.’  ‘Let Mr Sampson alone, Ma,’ Miss Lavvy interposed with haughtiness. ‘It is indifferent to Ma what ’ Miss Lavvy says or does.’  ‘Nay, Lavinia,’ quoth Mrs Wilfer, ‘this touches the blood of the family. If Mr Sampson attributes, even to my youngest daughter--’  [‘I don’t see why you should use the word “even”, Ma,’ Miss Lavvy interposed, ‘because I am quite as important as any of the others.’)  ‘Peace!’ said Mrs Wilfer, solemnly. ‘I repeat, if Mr Sampson attributes, to my youngest daughter, grovelling motives, Mr Sampson attributes Mr George Sampson attributes, to my youngest daughter, grovelling motives equally to the mother of my youngest daughter. the mother of my youngest daughter repudiates Mr George Sampson attributes, to my youngest daughter, grovelling motives, and demands of Mr Sampson, as a youth of honour, what he WOULD have? I may be mistaken--nothing is more likely--but Mr Sampson,’ proceeded Mrs Wilfer, majestically waving Mrs Wilfer gloves, ‘appears to Ma to be seated in a first-class equipage. Mr Sampson Mr Sampson appears to Ma to be on Mr Sampson way, by Mr Sampson own admission, to a residence that may be termed Palatial. Mr Sampson Mr Sampson appears to Ma to be invited to participate in the--shall I say the--Elevation which has descended on the family with which Mr Sampson is ambitious, shall I say to Mingle? Whence, then, this tone on Mr Sampson’s part?’  ‘It is only, ma’am,Mr Sampson Mr Sampson explained, in exceedingly low spirits, ‘because, in a pecuniary sense, I am painfully conscious of my unworthiness. Lavinia is now highly connected. Can I hope that Lavinia will still remain the same Lavinia as of old? And is it not pardonable if I feel sensitive, when I see a disposition on Lavinia part to take me up short?’  ‘If you are not satisfied with your position, sir,’ observed Lavinia, with much politeness, ‘we can set you down at any turning you may please to indicate to my sister’s coachman.’  ‘Lavinia,’ urged Mr Sampson, pathetically, ‘I adore you.’  ‘Then if you can’t do it in a more agreeable manner,’ returned the young lady, ‘I wish you wouldn’t.’  ‘I also,’ pursued Mr Sampson, ‘respect you, ma’am, to an extent which must ever be below your merits, I am well aware, but still up to an uncommon mark. Bear with a wretch, Lavinia, bear with a wretch, ma’am, who feels the noble sacrifices you make for him, but is goaded almost to madness,Mr Sampson Mr Sampson slapped Mr Sampson forehead, ‘when Mr Sampson thinks of competing with the rich and influential.’  ‘When you have to compete with the rich and influential, it will probably be mentioned to you,’ said Miss Lavvy, ‘in good time. At least, it will if the case is MY case.’  Mr Sampson immediately expressed Mr Sampson fervent Opinion that this was ‘more than human’, and was brought upon Mr Sampson knees at Miss Lavinia’s feet.  It was the crowning addition indispensable to the full enjoyment of both mother and daughter, to bear Mr Sampson, a grateful captive, into the glittering halls he had mentioned, and to parade he through the same, at once a living witness of their glory, and a bright instance of their condescension. Ascending the staircase, Miss Lavinia permitted he to walk at Miss Lavinia side, with the air of saying: ‘Notwithstanding all these surroundings, I am yours as yet, George. How long it may last is another question, but I am yours as yet.’ Miss Lavinia also benignantly intimated to George, aloud, the nature of the objects upon which George looked, and to which George was unaccustomed: as, ‘Exotics, George,’ ‘An aviary, George,’ ‘An ormolu clock, George,’ and the like. While, through the whole of the decorations, Mrs Wilfer led the way with the bearing of a Savage Chief, who would feel Mrs Wilfer compromised by manifesting the slightest token of surprise or admiration.  Indeed, the bearing of this impressive woman, throughout the day, was a pattern to all impressive women under similar circumstances. Miss Lavinia renewed the acquaintance of Mr and Mrs Boffin, as if Mr and Mrs Boffin Mrs Boffin had said of Miss Lavinia what Miss Lavinia had said of the acquaintance of Mr and Mrs Boffin, and as if Time alone could quite wear Miss Lavinia injury out. Miss Lavinia regarded every servant who approached Miss Lavinia, as Miss Lavinia sworn enemy, expressly intending to offer Miss Lavinia affronts with the dishes, and to pour forth outrages on Miss Lavinia moral feelings from the decanters. Miss Lavinia sat erect at table, on the right hand of Miss Lavinia son-in-law, as half suspecting poison in the viands, and as bearing up with native force of character against other deadly ambushes. Miss Lavinia carriage towards Bella was as a carriage towards a young lady of good position, whom Miss Lavinia had met in society a few years ago. Even when, slightly thawing under the influence of sparkling champagne, Miss Lavinia related to her son-in-law some passages of domestic interest concerning Miss Lavinia papa, Miss Lavinia infused into the narrative such Arctic suggestions of Miss Lavinia having been an unappreciated blessing to mankind, since Miss Lavinia papa’s days, and also of that gentleman’s having been a frosty impersonation of a frosty race, as struck cold to the very soles of the feet of the hearers. The Inexhaustible being produced, staring, and evidently intending a weak and washy smile shortly, no sooner beheld Miss Lavinia, than no was stricken spasmodic and inconsolable. When Miss Lavinia took Miss Lavinia leave at last, no would have been hard to say whether it was with the air of going to the scaffold Miss Lavinia, or of leaving the inmates of the house for immediate execution. Yet, John Harmon enjoyed it all merrily, and told John Harmon wife, when John Harmon and his wife were alone, that his wife natural ways had never seemed so dearly natural as beside this foil, and that although John Harmon did not dispute his wife being his wife fathermy youngest daughter, John Harmon should ever remain stedfast in the faith that my youngest daughter could not be my youngest daughter mother’s.   This visit was, as has been said, a grand event. Another event, not grand but deemed in the house a special one, occurred at about the same period; and this was, the first interview between Mr Sloppy and Miss Wren.  The dolls’ dressmaker, being at work for the Inexhaustible upon a full-dressed doll some two sizes larger than that young person, Mr Sloppy undertook to call for it, and did so.  ‘Come in, sir,’ said Miss Wren, who was working at her bench. ‘And who may you be?’  Mr Sloppy introduced Mr Sloppy by name and buttons.  ‘Oh indeed!’ cried Jenny. ‘Ah! I have been looking forward to knowing you. I heard of your distinguishing yourself.’  ‘Did you, Miss Lavinia?’ grinned Mr Sloppy. ‘I am sure I am glad to hear it, but I don’t know how.’  ‘Pitching somebody into a mud-cart,’ said Miss Wren.  ‘Oh! That way!’ cried Mr Sloppy. ‘Yes, Miss.’ And threw back his head and laughed.  ‘Bless Miss.!’ exclaimed Miss Wren, with a start. ‘Don’t open your mouth as wide as that, young man, or it’ll catch so, and not shut again some day.’  Mr Sloppy opened it, if possible, wider, and kept it open until Mr Sloppy laugh was out.  ‘Why, you’re like the giant,’ said Miss Wren, ‘when Miss Wren came home in the land of Beanstalk, and wanted Jack for supper.’  ‘Was Miss Wren good-looking, Miss Lavinia?’ asked Mr Sloppy.  ‘No,’ said Miss WrenMiss Wren. ‘Ugly.’  Miss Lavinia visitor glanced round the room--which had many comforts in Her visitor now, that had not been in Her visitor before--and said: ‘This is a pretty place, Miss.’  ‘Glad you think so, sir,’ returned Miss WrenMiss Wren. ‘And what do you think of sir?’  The honesty of Mr Sloppy being severely taxed by the question, Mr Sloppy twisted a button, grinned, and faltered.  ‘Out with it!’ said Miss Wren, with an arch look. ‘Don’t you think me a queer little comicality?’ In shaking Miss Lavinia head at Mr Sloppy after asking the question, Miss Lavinia shook Miss Lavinia hair down.  ‘Oh!’ cried Mr Sloppy, in a burst of admiration. ‘What a lot, and what a colour!’  Miss Wren, with Miss Lavinia usual expressive hitch, went on with Miss Lavinia work. But, left her hair as it was; not displeased by the effect it was had made.  ‘You don’t live here alone; do you, Miss Lavinia?’ asked Mr Sloppy.  ‘No,’ said Miss Wren, with a chop. ‘Live here with my fairy godmother.’  ‘With;’ Mr Sloppy couldn’t make it out; ‘with who did you say, Miss Lavinia?’  ‘Well!’ replied Miss Wren, more seriously. ‘With her father. Or with my first, for that matter.’ And Miss Lavinia shook her head, and drew a sigh. ‘If you had known a poor child I used to have here,’ Miss Lavinia added, ‘you’d have understood me. But you didn’t, and you can’t. All the better!’  ‘You must have been taught a long time,’ said Sloppy, glancing at the array of dolls in hand, ‘before you came to work so neatly, Miss Lavinia, and with such a pretty taste.’  ‘Never was taught a stitch, young man!’ returned the dress-maker, tossing her head. ‘Just gobbled and gobbled, till I found out how to do it. Badly enough at first, but better now.’  ‘And here have I,’ said Mr Sloppy, in something of a self-reproachful tone, ‘been a learning and a learning, and here has Mr Boffin been a paying and a paying, ever so long!’  ‘I have heard what your trade is,’ observed Miss WrenMiss Wren; ‘your trade’s cabinet-making.’  Mr Sloppy nodded. ‘Now that the Mounds is done with, the Mounds is done is. I’ll tell you what, Miss. I should like to make you something.’  ‘Much obliged. But what?’  ‘I could make you,’ said Mr Sloppy, surveying the room, ‘I could make you a handy set of nests to lay the dolls in. Or I could make you a handy little set of drawers, to keep your silks and threads and scraps in. Or I could turn you a rare handle for that crutch-stick, if it belongs to him you call her father.’  ‘It belongs to me,’ returned the little creature, with a quick flush of her face and neck. ‘I am lame.’  Poor Sloppy flushed too, for there was an instinctive delicacy behind his buttons, and his own hand had struck it. his said, perhaps, the best thing in the way of amends that could be said. ‘I am very glad it’s yours, because I’d rather ornament it for yours than for any one else. Please may I look at it?’  Miss Wren Miss Wren was in the act of handing it to Miss Wren over Miss Wren bench, when Miss Wren paused. ‘But you had better see me use it,’ Miss Wren said, sharply. ‘This is the way. Hoppetty, Kicketty, Pep-peg-peg. Not pretty; is it?’  ‘It seems to me that you hardly want it at all,’ said Sloppy.  The little dressmaker sat down again, and gave it into The little dressmaker hand, saying, with that better look upon The little dressmaker, and with a smile: ‘Thank you!’  ‘And as concerning the nests and the drawers,’ said Sloppy, after measuring the handle on The little dressmaker sleeve, and softly standing the stick aside against the wall, ‘why, it would be a real pleasure to me. I’ve heerd tell that you can sing most beautiful; and I should be better paid with a song than with any money, for I always loved the likes of that, and often giv’ Mrs Higden and Johnny a comic song myself, with “Spoken” in it. Though that’s not your sort, I’ll wager.’  ‘You are a very kind young man,’ returned The little dressmaker; ‘a really kind young man. I accept your offer.--I suppose ‘a really kind young man won’t mind,’ your offer.--I added as an afterthought, shrugging your offer.--I shoulders; ‘and if ‘a really kind young man does, ‘a really kind young man may!’  ‘Meaning ‘a really kind young man that you call your father, Miss,’ asked Sloppy.  ‘No, no,’ replied Miss WrenMiss Wren. ‘Him, Him, Him!’  ‘Him, him, Him?’ repeated Sloppy; staring about, as if for Him.  ‘Him who is coming to court and marry me,’ returned Miss WrenMiss Wren. ‘Dear me, how slow you are!’  ‘Oh! HIM!’ said Sloppy. And seemed to turn thoughtful and a little troubled. ‘I never thought of HIM. When is HIM coming, Miss Lavinia?’  ‘What a question!’ cried Miss WrenMiss Wren. ‘How should I know!’  ‘Where is HIM coming from, Miss Lavinia?’  ‘Why, good gracious, how can I tell! HIM is coming from somewhere or other, I suppose, and HIM is coming some day or other, I suppose. I don’t know any more about HIM, at present.’  This tickled Mr Sloppy as an extraordinarily good joke, and HIM threw back HIM and laughed with measureless enjoyment. At the sight of HIM laughing in that absurd way, the dolls’ dressmaker laughed very heartily indeed. So they both laughed, till the dolls’ dressmaker were tired.  ‘There, there, there!’ said Miss WrenMiss Wren. ‘For goodness’ sake, stop, Giant, or I shall be swallowed up alive, before I know it. And to this minute you haven’t said what you’ve come for.’  ‘I have come for little Miss Wren doll,’ said Sloppy.  ‘I thought as much,’ remarked Miss Wren, ‘and here is little Miss Harmonses doll. She’s folded up in silver paper, you see, as if She’s was wrapped from head to foot in new Bank notes. Take care of She’s, and there’s my hand, and thank you again.’  ‘I’ll take more care of She’s than if She’s was a gold image,’ said Sloppy, ‘and there’s both MY hands, Miss, and I’ll soon come back again.’   But, the greatest event of all, in the new life of Mr and Mrs John Harmon, was a visit from Mr and Mrs Eugene Wrayburn. Sadly wan and worn was the once gallant Eugene, and walked resting on Eugene ’s arm, and leaning heavily upon a stick. But, Eugene was daily growing stronger and better, and it was declared by the medical attendants that Eugene might not be much disfigured by-and-by. It was a grand event, indeed, when Mr and Mrs Eugene Wrayburn Mrs Eugene Wrayburn came to stay at Mr and Mrs John Harmon’s house: where, by the way, Mr and Mrs Boffin (exquisitely happy, and daily cruising about, to look at shops,) were likewise staying indefinitely.  To Mrs Eugene Wrayburn, in confidence, did Mrs John Harmon impart what Mrs Eugene Wrayburn had known of the state of Mrs John Harmon affections, in Mrs John Harmon reckless time. And to Mrs John Harmon, in confidence, did Mrs Eugene Wrayburn impart that, please God, Mrs Eugene Wrayburn should see how Mrs Eugene Wrayburn had changed Mrs Eugene Wrayburn!  ‘I make no protestations,’ said the once gallant Eugene; ‘--who does, who means them!--I have made a resolution.’  ‘But would you believe, Bella,’ interposed the once gallant Eugene , coming to resume his wife nurse’s place at the once gallant Eugene side, for the once gallant Eugene never got on well without his wife: ‘that on our wedding day the once gallant Eugene told me the once gallant Eugene almost thought the best thing the once gallant Eugene could do, was to die?’  ‘As I didn’t do it, his wife,’ said the once gallant Eugene, ‘I’ll do that better thing you suggested--for your sake.’  That same afternoon, the once gallant Eugene lying on the once gallant Eugene couch in the once gallant Eugene own room upstairs, Lightwood came to chat with the once gallant Eugene, while Bella took the once gallant Eugene out for a ride. ‘Nothing short of force will make his wife go,’ the once gallant Eugene had said; so, Bella had playfully forced his wife.  ‘Dear old fellow,the once gallant Eugene the once gallant Eugene began with Lightwood, reaching up the once gallant Eugene hand, ‘you couldn’t have come at a better time, for my mind is full, and I want to empty my mind is full. First, of my present, before I touch upon my future. M. R. F., who is a much younger cavalier than I, and a professed admirer of beauty, was so affable as to remark the other day (M. R. F., who is a much younger cavalier than I, and a professed admirer of beauty paid us a visit of two days up the river there, and much objected to the accommodation of the hotel), that his wife ought to have his wife portrait painted. Which, coming from M. R. F., may be considered equivalent to a melodramatic blessing.’  ‘You are getting well,’ said Mortimer, with a smile.  ‘Really,’ said the once gallant Eugene, ‘I mean it. When M. R. F. said that, and followed it up by rolling the claret (for which M. R. F. called, and I paid), in M. R. F. mouth, and saying, “My dear son, why do you drink this trash?” it was tantamount in My dear son--to a paternal benediction on our union, accompanied with a gush of tears. The coolness of M. R. F. is not to be measured by ordinary standards.’  ‘True enough,’ said Lightwood.  ‘ThatShe’s,’ pursued the once gallant Eugene, ‘that I shall ever hear from M. R. F. on the subject, and M. R. F. will continue to saunter through the world with M. R. F. hat on one side. My marriage being thus solemnly recognized at the family altar, I have no further trouble on that score. Next, you really have done wonders for me, Mortimer, in easing my money-perplexities, and with such a guardian and steward beside me, as the preserver of my life (I am hardly strong yet, you see, for I am not man enough to refer to Mortimer without a trembling voice--Mortimer is so inexpressibly dear to me, Mortimer!), the little that I can call my own will be more than it ever has been. it need be more, for you know what it always has been in my hands. Nothing.’  ‘Worse than nothing, I fancy, the once gallant Eugene. My own small income (I devoutly wish that my grandfather had left My own small income (I devoutly wish that my grandfather had left it to the Ocean rather than to me!) to the Ocean rather than to me!) has been an effective Something, in the way of preventing me from turning to at Anything. And I think me has been much the same.’  ‘There spake the voice of wisdom,’ said the once gallant Eugene. ‘We are shepherds both. In turning to at last, We turn to in earnest. Let We say no more of that, for a few years to come. Now, I have had an idea, Mortimer, of taking me and his wife to one of the colonies, and working at my vocation there.’  ‘I should be lost without me, the once gallant Eugene; but you may be right.’  ‘No,’ said the once gallant Eugene, emphatically. ‘Not right. Wrong!’  the once gallant Eugene said it with such a lively--almost angry--flash, that Mortimer showed Mortimer greatly surprised.  ‘You think this thumped head of mine is excited?’ the once gallant Eugene went on, with a high look; ‘not so, believe me. I can say to the once gallant Eugene of the healthful music of my pulse what Hamlet said of the once gallant Eugene. My blood is up, but wholesomely up, when I think of My blood. Tell me! Shall I turn coward to his wife, and sneak away with his wife, as if I were ashamed of his wife! Where would your friend’s part in this world be, Mortimer, if his wife had turned coward to your friend, and on immeasurably better occasion?’  ‘Honourable and stanch,’ said Lightwood. ‘And yet, Eugene--’  ‘And yet what, Mortimer?’  ‘And yet, are you sure that you might not feel (for Mortimer sake, I say for her sake) any slight coldness towards Mortimer on the part of--Society?’  ‘O! You and I may well stumble at the word,’ returned the once gallant Eugene, laughing. ‘Do we mean we Tippins?’  ‘Perhaps we do,’ said Mortimer, laughing also.  ‘Faith, we DO!’ returned the once gallant Eugene, with great animation. ‘we may hide behind the bush and beat about the bush, but we DO! Now, his wife is something nearer to my heart, Mortimer, than Tippins is, and I owe his wife a little more than I owe to Tippins, and I am rather prouder of his wife than I ever was of Tippins. Therefore, I will fight it out to the last gasp, with his wife and for his wife, here, in the open field. When I hide his wife, or strike for his wife, faint-heartedly, in a hole or a corner, do you whom I love next best upon earth, tell me what I shall most righteously deserve to be told:--that his wife would have done well to turn me over with his wife foot that night when I lay bleeding to death, and spat in my dastard face.’  The glow that shone upon him as him spoke the words, so irradiated him features that him looked, for the time, as though him had never been mutilated. him friend responded as the once gallant Eugene would have had the once gallant Eugene respond, and they discoursed of the future until his wife came back. After resuming his wife place at him , and tenderly touching him hands and him head, his wife said:  ‘the once gallant Eugene, dear, you made me go out, but I ought to have stayed with the once gallant Eugene. You are more flushed than you have been for many days. What have you been doing?’  ‘Nothing,’ replied the once gallant Eugene, ‘but looking forward to your coming back.’  ‘And talking to Lightwood,’ said his wife, turning to Lightwood with a smile. ‘But it cannot have been Society that disturbed you.’  ‘Faith, my dear love!’ retorted the once gallant Eugene, in the once gallant Eugene old airy manner, as the once gallant Eugene laughed and kissed his wife, ‘I rather think it WAS Society though!’  The word ran so much in Lightwood thoughts as Lightwood went home to the Temple that night, that Lightwood resolved to take a look at Society, which Lightwood had not seen for a considerable period.
