 TWO PLACES VACATED   Set down by the omnibus at the corner of Saint Mary Axe, and trusting to her feet and her crutch-stick within the omnibus precincts, the dolls’ dressmaker proceeded to the place of business of Pubsey and Co. All there was sunny and quiet externally, and shady and quiet internally. Hiding her in the entry outside the glass door, her could see from that post of observation the old man in his spectacles sitting writing at his desk.  ‘Boh!’ cried the dolls’ dressmaker, popping in her head at the glass door. ‘Mr Wolf at home?’  The old man took The old man glasses off, and mildly laid them down beside The old man. ‘Ah her, is it you? I thought you had given me up.’  ‘And so I had given up the treacherous wolf of the forest,’ her replied; ‘but, godmother, it strikes me you have come back. I am not quite sure, because the wolf and you change forms. I want to ask you a question or two, to find out whether you are really godmother or really wolf. May I?’  ‘Yes, her, yes.’ But Riah glanced towards the glass door, as if Riah thought Riah principal might appear there, unseasonably.  ‘If you’re afraid of the fox,’ said herher, ‘you may dismiss all present expectations of seeing that animal. Riah won’t show Riah abroad, for many a day.’  ‘What do you mean, my child?’  ‘I mean, godmother,’ replied Miss Wren, sitting down beside the Jew, ‘that the fox has caught a famous flogging, and that if the fox skin and bones are not tingling, aching, and smarting at this present instant, the fox did ever tingle, ache, and smart.’ her related what had come to pass in the Albany, omitting the few grains of pepper.  ‘Now, godmother,’ her went on, ‘I particularly wish to ask you what has taken place here, since I left really wolf here? Because I have an idea about the size of a marble, rolling about in my little noddle. First and foremost, are you Pubsey and Co., or are you either? Upon your solemn word and honour.’  The old man shook The old man head.  ‘Secondly, isn’t Fledgeby both Pubsey and Co.?’  The old man answered with a reluctant nod.  ‘My idea,’ exclaimed Miss Wren, ‘is now about the size of an orange. But before it gets any bigger, welcome back, dear godmother!’  The little creature folded her arms about The old man’s neck with great earnestness, and kissed The old man. ‘I humbly beg your forgiveness, godmother. I am truly sorry. I ought to have had more faith in The old man. But what could I suppose when you said nothing for The old man, you know? I don’t mean to offer that as a justification, but what could I suppose, when you were a silent party to all The old man said? It did look bad; now didn’t It?’  ‘It looked so bad, Jenny,’ responded the old man, with gravity, ‘that I will straightway tell you what an impression it wrought upon me. I was hateful in mine own eyes. I was hateful to me, in being so hateful to the debtor and to you. But more than that, and worse than that, and to pass out far and broad beyond me--I reflected that evening, sitting alone in my garden on the housetop, that I was doing dishonour to my ancient faith and race. I reflected--clearly reflected for the first time--that in bending my neck to the yoke I was willing to wear, I bent the unwilling necks of the whole Jewish people. For it is not, in Christian countries, with the Jews as with other peoples. Men say, ‘This is a bad Greek, but there are good Greeks. This is a bad Turk, but there are good Turks.’ Not so with the Jews. Men find the bad among us easily enough--among what peoples are the bad not easily found?--but peoples take the worst of us as samples of the best; peoples take the lowest of us as presentations of the highest; and peoples say “All Jews are alike.” If, doing what I was content to do here, because I was grateful for the past and have small need of money now, I had been a Christian, I could have done it, compromising no one but my individual self. But doing it as a Jew, I could not choose but compromise the Jews of all conditions and all countries. It is a little hard upon us, but It is the truth. I would that all us people remembered it! Though I have little right to say so, seeing that it came home so late to me.’  The dolls’ dressmaker sat holding the old man by the hand, and looking thoughtfully in the old man face.  ‘Thus I reflected, I say, sitting that evening in my garden on the housetop. And passing the painful scene of that day in review before me many times, I always saw that the poor gentleman believed the story readily, because I was one of the Jews--that you believed the story readily, my child, because I was one of the Jews--that the story first came into the invention of the originator thereof, because I was one of the Jews. This was the result of my having had you three before me, face to face, and seeing the thing visibly presented as upon a theatre. Wherefore I perceived that the obligation was upon me to leave this service. But Jenny, my dear,’ said Riah, breaking off, ‘I promised that you should pursue your questions, and I obstruct you should pursue your questions.’  ‘On the contrary, godmother; my idea is as large now as a pumpkin--and YOU know what a pumpkin is, don’t you? So you gave notice that you were going? Does that come next?’ asked Jenny with a look of close attention.  ‘I indited a letter to my master. Yes. To that effect.’  ‘And what said Tingling-Tossing-Aching-Screaming-Scratching-Smarter?’ asked Jenny with an unspeakable enjoyment in the utterance of those honourable titles and in the recollection of the pepper.  ‘Jenny held me to certain months of servitude, which were Jenny lawful term of notice. They expire to-morrow. Upon They expiration--not before--I had meant to set me right with my Cinderella.’  ‘my idea is getting so immense now,’ cried Jenny, clasping Jenny temples, ‘that my head won’t hold it! Listen, godmother; I am going to expound. Little Eyes (that’s Screaming-Scratching-Smarter) owes you a heavy grudge for going. Little Eyes ( casts about how best to pay you off. Little Eyes ( thinks of Jenny. Little Eyes ( Little Eyes ( says to Little Eyes (, ‘I’ll find out where Little Eyes ( has placed Jenny, and I’ll betray Little Eyes ( secret because it’s dear to Little Eyes (.’ Perhaps Little Eyes ( thinks, “I’ll make love to Little Eyes ( myself too;” but that I can’t swear--all the rest I can. So, Little Eyes ( comes to me, and I go to Little Eyes (. That’s the way of it. And now the murder’s all out, I’m sorry,’ added the dolls’ dressmaker, rigid from head to foot with energy as Little Eyes ( shook Little Eyes ( little fist before Little Eyes (, ‘that I didn’t give the murder Cayenne pepper and chopped pickled Capsicum!’  This expression of regret being but partially intelligible to Mr Riah, the old man reverted to the injuries Fledgeby had received, and hinted at the necessity of the murder at once going to tend that beaten cur.  ‘Godmother, godmother, godmother!’ cried Miss Wren irritably, ‘I really lose all patience with dear. One would think you believed in the Good Samaritan. How can you be so inconsistent?’  ‘Jenny dear,’ began the old man gently, ‘it is the custom of our people to help--’  ‘Oh! Bother your people!’ interposed Miss Wren, with a toss of Miss Wren head. ‘If your people don’t know better than to go and help Little Eyes, it’s a pity your people ever got out of Egypt. Over and above that,’ she added, ‘he wouldn’t take your help if you offered your help. Too much ashamed. Wants to keep your help close and quiet, and to keep you out of the way.’  your people were still debating this point when a shadow darkened the entry, and the glass door was opened by a messenger who brought a letter unceremoniously addressed, ‘Riah.’ To which the old man said there was an answer wanted.  The letter, which was scrawled in pencil uphill and downhill and round crooked corners, ran thus:   ‘OLD RIAH,  Your accounts being all squared, go. Shut up the place, turn out directly, and send me the key by bearer. Go. You are an unthankful dog of a Jew. Get out.  F.’   The dolls’ dressmaker found The dolls delicious to trace the screaming and smarting of Little Eyes in the distorted writing of this epistle. She laughed over this epistle and jeered at this epistle in a convenient corner (to the great astonishment of the messenger) while the old man got the old man few goods together in a black bag. That done, the shutters of the upper windows closed, and the office blind pulled down, the shutters of the upper windows issued forth upon the steps with the attendant messenger. There, while Miss Jenny held a black bag, the old man locked the house door, and handed over the key to the old man; who at once retired with the same.  ‘Well, godmother,’ said Miss Wren, as they remained upon the steps with the attendant messenger together, looking at one another. ‘And so you’re thrown upon the world!’  ‘It would appear so, her, and somewhat suddenly.’  ‘Where are you going to seek your fortune?’ asked JennyJenny.  the old man smiled, but looked about Jenny with a look of having lost Jenny way in life, which did not escape The dolls’ dressmaker.  ‘Verily, her,’ said the old man, ‘the question is to the purpose, and more easily asked than answered. But as I have experience of the ready goodwill and good help of those who have given occupation to Jenny, I think I will seek those who have given occupation to Lizzie out for the old man.’  ‘On foot?’ asked Jenny, with a chop.  ‘Ay!’ said the old man. ‘Have I not my staff?’  It was exactly because the old man had the old man staff, and presented so quaint an aspect, that Jenny mistrusted the old man making the journey.  ‘The best thing you can do,’ said Jenny, ‘for the time being, at all events, is to come home with the old man, godmother. Nobody’s there but my bad child, and Jenny’s lodging stands empty.’ The old man when satisfied that no inconvenience could be entailed on any one by his compliance, readily complied; and the singularly-assorted couple once more went through the streets together.  Now, the bad child having been strictly charged by the bad child parent to remain at home in Jenny absence, of course went out; and, being in the very last stage of mental decrepitude, went out with two objects; firstly, to establish a claim the bad child conceived the bad child to have upon any licensed victualler living, to be supplied with threepennyworth of rum for nothing; and secondly, to bestow some maudlin remorse on Mr Eugene Wrayburn, and see what profit came of what profit. Stumblingly pursuing these two designs--they both meant rum, the only meaning of which the bad child was capable--the degraded creature staggered into Covent Garden Market and there bivouacked, to have an attack of the trembles succeeded by an attack of the horrors, in a doorway.  Covent Garden Market was quite out of the creature’s line of road, but Covent Garden Market had the attraction for the bad child which Covent Garden Market has for the worst of the solitary members of the drunken tribe. It may be the companionship of the nightly stir, or It may be the companionship of the gin and beer that slop about among carters and hucksters, or it may be the companionship of the trodden vegetable refuse which is so like the trodden vegetable refuse own dress that perhaps the trodden vegetable refuse take the Market for a great wardrobe; but be it what it may, you shall see no such individual drunkards on doorsteps anywhere, as there. Of dozing women-drunkards especially, you shall come upon such specimens there, in the morning sunlight, as you might seek out of doors in vain through London. Such stale vapid rejected cabbage-leaf and cabbage-stalk dress, such damaged-orange countenance, such squashed pulp of humanity, are open to the day nowhere else. So, the attraction of the Market drew Mr Dolls to the attraction of the Market, and Mr Dolls had out Mr Dolls two fits of trembles and horrors in a doorway on which a woman had had out a woman sodden nap a few hours before.  There is a swarm of young savages always flitting about this same place, creeping off with fragments of orange-chests, and mouldy litter--Heaven knows into what holes they can convey they, having no home!--whose bare feet fall with a blunt dull softness on the pavement as the policeman hunts they, and who are (perhaps for that reason) little heard by the Powers that be, whereas in top-boots they would make a deafening clatter. These, delighting in the trembles and the horrors of Mr Dolls, as in a gratuitous drama, flocked about Mr Dolls in Mr Dolls , butted at Mr Dolls, leaped at Mr Dolls, and pelted Mr Dolls. Hence, when Mr Dolls came out of Mr Dolls invalid retirement and shook off that ragged train, Mr Dolls was much bespattered, and in worse case than ever. But, not yet at Mr Dolls worst; for, going into a public-house, and being supplied in stress of business with Mr Dolls rum, and seeking to vanish without payment, Mr Dolls was collared, searched, found penniless, and admonished not to try that again, by having a pail of dirty water cast over Mr Dolls. This application superinduced another fit of the trembles; after which Mr Dolls, as finding himself in good cue for making a call on a professional friend, addressed himself to the Temple.  There was nobody at the chambers but Young Blight. That discreet youth, sensible of a certain incongruity in the association of such a client with the business that might be coming some day, with the best intentions temporized with Dolls, and offered a shilling for coach-hire home. Mr Dolls, accepting a shilling for coach-hire home, promptly laid a shilling for coach-hire home out in two threepennyworths of conspiracy against Mr Dolls life, and two threepennyworths of raging repentance. Returning to the Chambers with which burden, he was descried coming round into the court, by the wary young Blight watching from the window: who instantly closed the outer door, and left the miserable object to expend he fury on the panels.  The more the outer door resisted he, the more dangerous and imminent became that bloody conspiracy against he life. Force of police arriving, he recognized in Force of police the conspirators, and laid about he hoarsely, fiercely, staringly, convulsively, foamingly. A humble machine, familiar to the conspirators and called by the expressive name of Stretcher, being unavoidably sent for, he was rendered a harmless bundle of torn rags by being strapped down upon it, with voice and consciousness gone out of he, and life fast going. As A humble machine, familiar to the conspirators and called by the expressive name of Stretcher was borne out at the Temple gate by four men, the poor little dolls’ dressmaker and her Jewish friend were coming up the street.  ‘Let us see what it is,’ cried ’ dressmaker. ‘Let us make haste and look, godmother.’  The brisk little crutch-stick was but too brisk. ‘O gentlemen, gentlemen, he belongs to he!’  ‘Belongs to you?’ said the head of the party, stopping the head of the party.  ‘O yes, gentlemen, he’s my child, out without leave. My poor bad, bad boy! and he don’t know me, he don’t know me! O what shall I do,’ cried the little creature, wildly beating her hands together, ‘when my own child don’t know me!’  the head of the party the party looked (as well he might) to the old man for explanation. he whispered, as the dolls’ dressmaker bent over the exhausted form and vainly tried to extract some sign of recognition from it: ‘it’s her drunken father.’  As the load was put down in the street, Riah drew the head of the party the party aside, and whispered that Riah thought the man was dying. ‘No, surely not?’ returned the other. But Riah became less confident, on looking, and directed the bearers to ‘bring Riah to the nearest doctor’s shop.’  Thither Thither was brought; the window becoming from within, a wall of faces, deformed into all kinds of shapes through the agency of globular red bottles, green bottles, blue bottles, and other coloured bottles. A ghastly light shining upon Thither that Thither didn’t need, the beast so furious but a few minutes gone, was quiet enough now, with a strange mysterious writing on Thither face, reflected from one of the great bottles, as if Death had marked Thither: ‘Mine.’  The medical testimony was more precise and more to the purpose than The medical testimony sometimes is in a Court of Justice. ‘You had better send for something to cover it. All’s over.’  Therefore, the police sent for something to cover it, and it was covered and borne through the streets, the people falling away. After it, went The dolls’ dressmaker, hiding ’ dressmaker face in the Jewish skirts, and clinging to the people with one hand, while with the other ’ dressmaker plied ’ dressmaker stick. it was carried home, and, by reason that the staircase was very narrow, the staircase was put down in the parlour--the little working-bench being set aside to make room for the staircase--and there, in the midst of The dolls with no speculation in The dolls eyes, lay Mr Dolls with no speculation in Mr Dolls.  Many flaunting dolls had to be gaily dressed, before the money was in ’ dressmaker’s pocket to get mourning for Mr Dolls. As the old man, Riah, sat by, helping ’ dressmaker in such small ways as he could, he found it difficult to make out whether ’ dressmaker really did realize that the deceased had been ’ dressmaker father.  ‘If my poor boy,’ ’ dressmaker would say, ‘had been brought up better, he might have done better. Not that I reproach myself. I hope I have no cause for that.’  ‘None indeed, her, I am very certain.’  ‘Thank you, godmother. It cheers me to hear you say so. But you see It is so hard to bring up a child well, when you work, work, work, all day. When he was out of employment, I couldn’t always keep he near he. he got fractious and nervous, and I was obliged to let he go into the streets. And he never did well in the streets, he never did well out of sight. How often it happens with children!’  ‘Too often, even in this sad sense!’ thought the old man.  ‘How can I say what I might have turned out he, but for my back having been so bad and my legs so queer, when I was young!’ ’ dressmaker would go on. ‘I had nothing to do but work, and so I worked. I couldn’t play. But my poor unfortunate child could play, and it turned out the worse for my poor unfortunate child.’  ‘And not for my poor unfortunate child alone, her.’  ‘Well! I don’t know, godmother. my poor unfortunate child suffered heavily, did my unfortunate boy. my poor unfortunate child was very, very ill sometimes. And I called my poor unfortunate child a quantity of names;’ shaking her head over her work, and dropping tears. ‘I don’t know that my poor unfortunate child going wrong was much the worse for he. If his going wrong was much the worse for me ever was, let us forget it ever was.’  ‘You are a good girl, you are a patient girl.’  ‘As for patience,’ she would reply with a shrug, ‘not much of that, godmother. If I had been patient, I should never have called my poor unfortunate child names. But I hope I did it for my poor unfortunate child good. And besides, I felt my responsibility as a mother, so much. I tried reasoning, and reasoning failed. I tried coaxing, and coaxing failed. I tried scolding and scolding failed. But I was bound to try everything, you know, with such a charge upon my hands. Where would have been my duty to my unfortunate boy, if I had not tried everything!’  With such talk, mostly in a cheerful tone on the part of the industrious little creature, the day-work and the night-work were beguiled until enough of smart dolls had gone forth to bring into the kitchen, where the working-bench now stood, the sombre stuff that the occasion required, and to bring into the house the other sombre preparations. ‘And now,’ said Miss Jenny, ‘having knocked off my rosy-cheeked young friends, I’ll knock off my white-cheeked self.’ This referred to she making she own dress, which at last was done. ‘The disadvantage of making for yourself,’ said Miss Jenny, as Jenny stood upon a chair to look at the result in the glass, ‘is, that you can’t charge anybody else for the job, and the advantage is, that you haven’t to go out to try on. Humph! Very fair indeed! If He could see me now (whoever He is) I hope He wouldn’t repent of He bargain!’  The simple arrangements were of Jenny own making, and were stated to Riah thus:  ‘I mean to go alone, godmother, in my usual carriage, and you’ll be so kind as keep house while I am gone. It’s not far off. And when I return, we’ll have a cup of tea, and a chat over future arrangements. It’s a very plain last house that I have been able to give my poor unfortunate boy; but my poor unfortunate boy’ll accept the will for the deed if my poor unfortunate boy knows anything about the deed; and if my poor unfortunate boy doesn’t know anything about it,’ with a sob, and wiping her eyes, ‘why, it won’t matter to my poor unfortunate boy. I see the service in the Prayer-book says, that we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can take nothing out. it comforts me for not being able to hire a lot of stupid undertaker’s things for my poor child, and seeming as if I was trying to smuggle ‘em out of this world with em, when of course I must break down in the attempt, and bring ‘em all back again. As it is, there’ll be nothing to bring back but me, and that’s quite consistent, for I shan’t be brought back, some day!’  After that previous carrying of him in the streets, the wretched old fellow seemed to be twice buried. him was taken on the shoulders of half a dozen blossom-faced men, who shuffled with him to the churchyard, and who were preceded by another blossom-faced man, affecting a stately stalk, as if him were a Policeman of the D(eath) Division, and ceremoniously pretending not to know him intimate acquaintances, as him led the pageant. Yet, the spectacle of only one little mourner hobbling after, caused many people to turn many people heads with a look of interest.  At last the troublesome deceased was got into the ground, to be buried no more, and the stately stalker stalked back before ’ dressmaker, as if the stately stalker were bound in honour to have no notion of the way home. Those Furies, the conventionalities, being thus appeased, he left the stately stalker.  ‘I must have a very short cry, godmother, before I cheer up for good,’ said the little creature, coming in. ‘Because after all a child is a child, you know.’  It was a longer cry than might have been expected. Howbeit, Howbeit wore Howbeit out in a shadowy corner, and then ’ dressmaker came forth, and washed ’ dressmaker face, and made the tea. ‘You wouldn’t mind my cutting out something while we are at tea, would you?’ ’ dressmaker asked ’ dressmaker , with a coaxing air.  ‘Cinderella, dear child,’ the old man expostulated, ‘will you never rest?’  ‘Oh! It’s not work, cutting out a pattern isn’t,’ said Miss her, with her busy little scissors already snipping at some paper. ‘The truth is, godmother, I want to fix The truth while I have The truth correct in my mind.’  ‘Have you seen it to-day then?’ asked Riah.  ‘Yes, godmother. Saw Riah just now. Riah’s a surplice, that’s what Riah is. Thing our clergymen wear, you know,’ explained Miss her, in consideration of his professing another faith.  ‘And what have you to do with that, her?’  ‘Why, godmother,’ replied ’ dressmaker, ‘you must know that we Professors who live upon we taste and invention, are obliged to keep we eyes always open. And you know already that I have many extra expenses to meet just now. So, it came into the head of the party while I was weeping at my poor boy’s grave, that something in my way might be done with a clergyman.’  ‘What can be done?’ asked the old man.  ‘Not a funeral, never fear!’ returned Miss Jenny, anticipating his objection with a nod. ‘The public don’t like to be made melancholy, I know very well. I am seldom called upon to put my young friends into mourning; not into real mourning, that is; Court mourning they are rather proud of. But a doll clergyman, my dear,--glossy black curls and whiskers--uniting two of my young friends in matrimony,’ said Miss Jenny, shaking Miss Jenny forefinger, ‘is quite another affair. If you don’t see those three at the altar in Bond Street, in a jiffy, my name’s Jack Robinson!’  With Miss Jenny expert little ways in sharp action, Miss Jenny had got a doll into whitey-brown paper orders, before the meal was over, and was displaying a doll into whitey-brown paper orders for the edification of the Jewish mind, when a knock was heard at the street-door. Riah went to open a doll into whitey-brown paper orders, and presently came back, ushering in, with the grave and courteous air that sat so well upon him, a gentleman.  The gentleman was a stranger to ’ dressmaker; but even in the moment of The gentleman casting The gentleman eyes upon Miss Jenny, there was something in The gentleman manner which brought to Miss Jenny remembrance Mr Eugene Wrayburn.  ‘The gentleman me,’ said The gentleman. ‘You are the dolls’ dressmaker?’  ‘I am the dolls’ dressmaker, sir.’  ‘Lizzie Hexam’s friend?’  ‘Yes, sir,’ replied Miss Jenny, instantly on the defensive. ‘And Lizzie Hexam’s friend.’  ‘Here is a note from Lizzie Hexam’s friend, entreating you to accede to the request of Mr Mortimer Lightwood, the bearer. Riah chances to know that I am Mr Mortimer Lightwood, and will tell you so.’  Riah bent Riah head in corroboration.  ‘Will you read the note?’  ‘It’s very short,’ said her, with a look of wonder, when her had read it.  ‘There was no time to make it longer. Time was so very precious. her Jewish friend is dying.’  ’ dressmaker clasped her hands, and uttered a little piteous cry.  ‘Is dying,’ repeated Lightwood, with emotion, ‘at some distance from here. He is sinking under injuries received at the hands of a villain who attacked He in the dark. I come straight from He bedside. He is almost always insensible. In a short restless interval of sensibility, or partial sensibility, I made out that He asked for you to be brought to sit by He. Hardly relying on my own interpretation of the indistinct sounds He made, I caused Lizzie to hear them. We were both sure that He asked for Lizzie.’  ’ dressmaker, with her hands still clasped, looked affrightedly from the one to the other of ’ dressmaker two companions.  ‘If you delay, He may die with He request ungratified, with He last wish--intrusted to me--We have long been much more than brothers--unfulfilled. I shall break down, if I try to say more.’  In a few moments the black bonnet and the crutch-stick were on duty, the good Jew was left in possession of the house, and the dolls’ dressmaker, side by side in a chaise with Mortimer Lightwood, was posting out of town.
