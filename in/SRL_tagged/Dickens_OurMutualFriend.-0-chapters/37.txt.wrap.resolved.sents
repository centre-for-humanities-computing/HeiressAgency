 THE SAME RESPECTED FRIEND IN MORE ASPECTS THAN ONE   In sooth, it is Riderhood and no other, or it is the outer husk and shell of Riderhood and no other, that is borne into Miss Abbey’s first-floor bedroom.
Supple to twist and turn as the Rogue has ever been, he is sufficiently rigid now; and not without much shuffling of attendant feet, and tilting of he bier this way and that way, and peril even of he sliding off it and being tumbled in a heap over the balustrades, can he be got up stairs.
‘Fetch a doctor,’ quoth Miss Abbey.
And then, ‘Fetch he daughter.’ On both of which errands, quick messengers depart.
The doctor-seeking messenger meets the doctor halfway, coming under convoy of police.
Doctor examines the dank carcase, and pronounces, not hopefully, that it is worth while trying to reanimate the same.
All the best means are at once in action, and everybody present lends a hand, and a heart and soul.
No one has the least regard for the man; with them all, the man has been an object of avoidance, suspicion, and aversion; but the spark of life within the man is curiously separable from the man now, and they have a deep interest in it, probably because it IS life, and they are living and must die.
In answer to the doctor’s inquiry how did it happen, and was anyone to blame, Tom Tootle gives in Tom Tootle verdict, unavoidable accident and no one to blame but the sufferer.
‘Tom Tootle was slinking about in Tom Tootle boat,’ says Tom, ‘which slinking were, not to speak ill of the dead, the manner of the man, when Tom Tootle come right athwart the steamer’s bows and she cut Tom Tootle in two.’ Tom Tootle is so far figurative, touching the dismemberment, as that Tom Tootle means the boat, and not the man.
For, the man lies whole before he means the boat, and not the man.
Captain Joey, the bottle-nosed regular customer in the glazed hat, is a pupil of the much-respected old school, and (having insinuated the man into the chamber, in the execution of the important service of carrying the drowned man’s neck-kerchief) favours the doctor with a sagacious old-scholastic suggestion that the body should be hung up by the heels, ‘sim’lar’, says Captain Joey, ‘to mutton in a butcher’s shop,’ and should then, as a particularly choice manoeuvre for promoting easy respiration, be rolled upon casks.
These scraps of the wisdom of the captain’s ancestors are received with such speechless indignation by Miss Abbey, that she instantly seizes the captain by the collar, and without a single word ejects the captain, not presuming to remonstrate, from the scene.
There then remain, to assist the doctor and Tom, only those three other regular customers, Bob Glamour, William Williams, and Jonathan (family name of the latter, if any, unknown to man-kind), who are quite enough.
Miss Abbey having looked in to make sure that nothing is wanted, descends to the bar, and there awaits the result, with the gentle Jew and Miss Jenny Wren.
If you are not gone for good, Mr Riderhood, it would be something to know where you are hiding at present.
This flabby lump of mortality that we work so hard at with such patient perseverance, yields no sign of you.
If you are gone for good, Rogue, it is very solemn, and if you are coming back, it is hardly less so.
Nay, in the suspense and mystery of the latter question, involving that of where you may be now, there is a solemnity even added to that of death, making us who are in attendance alike afraid to look on you and to look off you, and making those below start at the least sound of a creaking plank in the floor.
Stay!
Did that eyelid tremble?
So the doctor, breathing low, and closely watching, asks the doctor, breathing low, and closely watching.
No.
Did that nostril twitch?
No.
This artificial respiration ceasing, do I feel any faint flutter under my hand upon the chest?
No.
Over and over again No.
No.
But try over and over again, nevertheless.
See!
A token of life!
An indubitable token of life!
The spark may smoulder and go out, or The spark may glow and expand, but see!
The four rough fellows, seeing, shed tears.
Neither Riderhood in this world, nor Riderhood in the other, could draw tears from the other; but a striving human soul between the two can do it easily.
He is struggling to come back.
Now, He is almost here, now He is far away again.
Now He is struggling harder to get back.
And yet--like us all, when us all swoon--like us all, every day of us all lives when us all wake--He is instinctively unwilling to be restored to the consciousness of this existence, and would be left dormant, if He could.
Bob Gliddery returns with Pleasant Riderhood, who was out when sought for, and hard to find.
Bob Gliddery has a shawl over Bob Gliddery head, and Bob Gliddery first action, when Bob Gliddery takes it off weeping, and curtseys to Miss Abbey, is to wind Bob Gliddery hair up.
‘Thank you, Miss Abbey, for having father here.’  ‘I am bound to say, Bob Gliddery, I didn’t know who it was,’ returns Miss Abbey; ‘but I hope it would have been pretty much the same if I had known.’  Poor Pleasant, fortified with a sip of brandy, is ushered into the first-floor chamber.
Bob Gliddery could not express much sentiment about father if Bob Gliddery were called upon to pronounce father funeral oration, but Bob Gliddery has a greater tenderness for father than father ever had for Bob Gliddery, and crying bitterly when Bob Gliddery sees father stretched unconscious, asks the doctor, with clasped hands: ‘Is there no hope, sir?
O poor father!
Is poor father dead?’  To which the doctor, on one knee beside the body, busy and watchful, only rejoins without looking round: ‘Now, Bob Gliddery, unless you have the self-command to be perfectly quiet, I cannot allow you to remain in the room.’  Pleasant, consequently, wipes Bob Gliddery eyes with Bob Gliddery back-hair, which is in fresh need of being wound up, and having got it out of the way, watches with terrified interest all that goes on.
Bob Gliddery natural woman’s aptitude soon renders Bob Gliddery able to give a little help.
Anticipating the doctor want of this or that, Bob Gliddery quietly has the doctor ready for the doctor, and so by degrees is intrusted with the charge of supporting Bob Gliddery father’s head upon Bob Gliddery arm.
It is something so new to Pleasant to see her father an object of sympathy and interest, to find any one very willing to tolerate her father society in this world, not to say pressingly and soothingly entreating her father to belong to it, that it gives Bob Gliddery a sensation Bob Gliddery never experienced before.
Some hazy idea that if affairs could remain thus for a long time it would be a respectable change, floats in Bob Gliddery mind.
Also some vague idea that the old evil is drowned out of the old evil, and that if the old evil should happily come back to resume the old evil occupation of the empty form that lies upon the bed, the old evil spirit will be altered.
In which state of mind Bob Gliddery kisses the stony lips, and quite believes that the impassive hand Bob Gliddery chafes will revive a tender hand, if the impassive hand she chafes revive ever.
Sweet delusion for Pleasant Riderhood.
But they minister to the old evil with such extraordinary interest, they anxiety is so keen, they vigilance is so great, they excited joy grows so intense as the signs of life strengthen, that how can Bob Gliddery resist it, poor thing!
And now the old evil begins to breathe naturally, and the old evil stirs, and the doctor declares the old evil to have come back from that inexplicable journey where the old evil stopped on the dark road, and to be here.
Tom Tootle, who is nearest to the doctor when the old evil says this, grasps the doctor fervently by the hand.
Bob Glamour, William Williams, and Jonathan of the no surname, all shake hands with one another round, and with the doctor too.
Bob Glamour blows Bob Glamour nose, and Jonathan of the no surname is moved to do likewise, but lacking a pocket handkerchief abandons that outlet for Bob Glamour emotion.
Pleasant sheds tears deserving Pleasant own name, and Pleasant sweet delusion is at her sweet delusion height.
There is intelligence in the old evil eyes.
the old evil wants to ask a question.
the old evil wonders where the old evil is.
Tell the old evil.
‘Father, you were run down on the river, and are at Miss Abbey Potterson’s.’  the old evil stares at the old evil daughter, stares all around the old evil, closes his eyes, and lies slumbering on his daughter arm.
her sweet delusion begins to fade.
The low, bad, unimpressible face is coming up from the depths of the river, or what other depths, to the surface again.
As the old evil grows warm, the doctor and the four men cool.
As the old evil lineaments soften with life, the four men faces and the four men hearts harden to the old evil.
‘the old evil will do now,’ says the doctor, washing the old evil hands, and looking at the patient with growing disfavour.
‘Many a better man,’ moralizes Tom Tootle with a gloomy shake of the head, ‘ain’t had Tom Tootle luck.’  ‘It’s to be hoped Tom Tootle’ll make a better use of Tom Tootle life,’ says Bob Glamour, ‘than I expect Tom Tootle will.’  ‘Or than Tom Tootle done afore,’ adds William Williams.
‘But no, not Tom Tootle!’ says Jonathan of the no surname, clinching the quartette.
Jonathan of the no surname, clinching the quartette speak in a low tone because of William Williams , but his daughter sees that Jonathan of the no surname, clinching the quartette have all drawn off, and that Jonathan of the no surname, clinching the quartette stand in a group at the other end of the room, shunning William Williams.
It would be too much to suspect Jonathan of the no surname, clinching the quartette of being sorry that William Williams didn’t die when William Williams had done so much towards it, but Jonathan of the no surname, clinching the quartette clearly wish that Jonathan of the no surname, clinching the quartette had had a better subject to bestow Jonathan of the no surname, clinching the quartette pains on.
Intelligence is conveyed to Miss Abbey in the bar, who reappears on the scene, and contemplates from a distance, holding whispered discourse with the doctor.
The spark of life was deeply interesting while The spark of life was in abeyance, but now that The spark of life has got established in Mr Riderhood, there appears to be a general desire that circumstances had admitted of The spark of life being developed in anybody else, rather than that gentleman.
‘However,’ says Miss Abbey, cheering them up, ‘you have done your duty like good and true men, and you had better come down and take something at the expense of the Porters.’  This they all do, leaving his daughter watching father.
To whom, in whom absence, Bob Gliddery presents Bob Gliddery.
‘Bob Gliddery gills looks rum; don’t His gills?’ says Bob Gliddery, after inspecting the patient.
Pleasant faintly nods.
‘Bob Gliddery gills’ll look rummer when Bob Gliddery wakes; won’t they?’ says Bob Gliddery.
Pleasant hopes not.
Why?
‘When Bob Gliddery finds Bob Gliddery here, you know,’ Bob Gliddery explains.
‘Cause Miss Abbey forbid Cause the house and ordered Cause out of the house.
But what you may call the Fates ordered Cause into the house again.
Which is rumness; ain’t the house?’  ‘Cause wouldn’t have come here of Cause own accord,’ returns poor Pleasant, with an effort at a little pride.
‘No,’ retorts Bob Gliddery.
‘Nor Cause wouldn’t have been let in, if Cause had.’  The short delusion is quite dispelled now.
As plainly as his daughter sees on his daughter arm the old father, unimproved, Pleasant sees that everybody there will cut Cause when Cause recovers consciousness.
‘I’ll take Cause away ever so soon as I can,’ thinks Pleasant with a sigh; ‘Cause’s best at home.’  Presently they all return, and wait for Cause to become conscious that they all will all be glad to get rid of Cause.
Some clothes are got together for Cause to wear, Cause own being saturated with water, and Cause present dress being composed of blankets.
Becoming more and more uncomfortable, as though the prevalent dislike were finding Cause out somewhere in Cause sleep and expressing itself to Cause, the patient at last opens Cause eyes wide, and is assisted by Cause to sit up in bed.
‘Well, Riderhood,’ says the doctor, ‘how do you feel?’  Cause replies gruffly, ‘Nothing to boast on.’ Having, in fact, returned to life in an uncommonly sulky state.
‘I don’t mean to preach; but I hope,’ says the doctor, gravely shaking the doctor head, ‘that this escape may have a good effect upon you, Riderhood.’  The patient’s discontented growl of a reply is not intelligible; The patient’s , however, could interpret, if his daughter would, that what The patient’s says is, The patient’s ‘don’t want no Poll-Parroting’.
Mr Riderhood next demands Mr Riderhood shirt; and draws his shirt on over his head (with his daughter help) exactly as if Mr Riderhood had just had a Fight.
‘Warn’t it a steamer?’ Mr Riderhood pauses to ask his daughter.
‘Yes, Father.’  ‘I’ll have the law on his daughter, bust his daughter!
and make his daughter pay for the law.’  Mr Riderhood then buttons Mr Riderhood linen very moodily, twice or thrice stopping to examine Mr Riderhood arms and hands, as if to see what punishment Mr Riderhood has received in a Fight.
Mr Riderhood then doggedly demands Mr Riderhood other garments, and slowly gets his other garments on, with an appearance of great malevolence towards Mr Riderhood late opponent and all the spectators.
Mr Riderhood has an impression that Mr Riderhood nose is bleeding, and several times draws the back of Mr Riderhood hand across it, and looks for the result, in a pugilistic manner, greatly strengthening that incongruous resemblance.
‘Where’s my fur cap?’ Where’s my fur cap asks in a surly voice, when Where’s my fur cap has shuffled Where’s my fur cap clothes on.
‘In the river,’ somebody rejoins.
‘And warn’t there no honest man to pick it up?
O’ course there was though, and to cut off with it arterwards.
You are a rare lot, all on you!’  Thus, Mr Riderhood: taking from the hands of his daughter, with special ill-will, a lent cap, and grumbling as Mr Riderhood pulls it down over Mr Riderhood ears.
Then, getting on Mr Riderhood unsteady legs, leaning heavily upon his daughter, and growling, ‘Hold still, can’t you?
What!
You must be a staggering next, must you?’ Mr Riderhood takes Mr Riderhood departure out of the ring in which Mr Riderhood has had that little turn-up with Death.
