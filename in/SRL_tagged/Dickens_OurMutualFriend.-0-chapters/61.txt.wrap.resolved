 THE DOLLS’ DRESSMAKER DISCOVERS A WORD   A darkened and hushed room; the river outside the windows flowing on to the vast ocean; a figure on the bed, swathed and bandaged and bound, lying helpless on the vast ocean back, with the vast ocean two useless arms in splints at the vast ocean sides. Only two days of usage so familiarized the little dressmaker with this scene, that the little dressmaker held the place occupied two days ago by the recollections of years.  He had scarcely moved since her arrival. Sometimes He eyes were open, sometimes closed. When they were open, there was no meaning in they unwinking stare at one spot straight before they, unless for a moment the brow knitted into a faint expression of anger, or surprise. Then, Mortimer Lightwood would speak to Mortimer Lightwood, and on occasions Mortimer Lightwood would be so far roused as to make an attempt to pronounce Mortimer Lightwood friend’s name. But, in an instant consciousness was gone again, and no spirit of Eugene was in Eugene’s crushed outer form.  They provided Jenny with materials for plying Jenny work, and Jenny had a little table placed at the foot of Mortimer Lightwood bed. Sitting there, with Jenny rich shower of hair falling over the chair-back, They hoped Jenny might attract Mortimer Lightwood notice. With the same object, Jenny would sing, just above Jenny breath, when Mortimer Lightwood opened Mortimer Lightwood eyes, or Jenny saw Mortimer Lightwood brow knit into that faint expression, so evanescent that it was like a shape made in water. But as yet Mortimer Lightwood had not heeded. The ‘they’ here mentioned were the medical attendant; Lizzie, who was there in all the medical attendant intervals of rest; and Lightwood, who never left Mortimer Lightwood.  The two days became three, and the three days became four. At length, quite unexpectedly, Mortimer Lightwood said something in a whisper.  ‘What was it, my dear Eugene?’  ‘Will you, Mortimer--’  ‘Will I--?  --‘Send for Jenny?’  ‘My dear fellow, Jenny is here.’  Quite unconscious of the long blank, My dear fellow supposed that they were still speaking together.  The little dressmaker stood up at the foot of the bed, humming The little dressmaker song, and nodded to The little dressmaker brightly. ‘I can’t shake hands, Jenny,’ said Eugene, with something of The little dressmaker old look; ‘but I am very glad to see you.’  Mortimer repeated this to Mortimer, for this could only be made out by bending over Mortimer and closely watching Mortimer attempts to say it. In a little while, Mortimer added:  ‘Ask Mortimer if Mortimer has seen the children.’  Mortimer could not understand this, neither could Jenny, until Mortimer added:  ‘Ask Mortimer if Mortimer has smelt the flowers.’  ‘Oh! I know!’ cried Jenny. ‘I understand Mortimer now!’ Then, Lightwood yielded Mortimer place to Mortimer quick approach, and Mortimer said, bending over the bed, with that better look: ‘You mean my long bright slanting rows of children, who used to bring me ease and rest? You mean the children who used to take me up, and make me light?’  Eugene smiled, ‘Yes.’  ‘I have not seen the children who used to take me up since I saw you. I never see the children who used to take me up now, but I am hardly ever in pain now.’  ‘It was a pretty fancy,’ said Eugene.  ‘But I have heard my birds sing,’ cried the little creature, ‘and I have smelt the flowers. Yes, indeed I have! And both were most beautiful and most Divine!’  ‘Stay and help to nurse me,’ said Eugene, quietly. ‘I should like you to have the fancy here, before I die.’  Mortimer touched I die lips with Mortimer hand, and shaded Mortimer eyes with her hand as Mortimer went back to Mortimer work and Mortimer little low song. I die heard the song with evident pleasure, until Mortimer allowed it gradually to sink away into silence.  ‘Mortimer.’  ‘Eugene.’  ‘If you can give me anything to keep me here for only a few minutes--’  ‘To keep you here, Eugene?’  ‘To prevent my wandering away I don’t know where--for I begin to be sensible that I have just come back, and that I shall lose Eugene again--do so, dear boy!’  Mortimer gave Mortimer such stimulants as could be given Mortimer with safety (they were always at hand, ready), and bending over Mortimer once more, was about to caution Mortimer, when Mortimer said:  ‘Don’t tell me not to speak, for I must speak. If you knew the harassing anxiety that gnaws and wears me when I am wandering in those places--where are those endless places, Mortimer? you knew the harassing anxiety that gnaws and wears me when I am wandering in those places--where are those endless places, Mortimer must be at an immense distance!’  Mortimer saw in Mortimer friend’s face that Mortimer was losing Mortimer; for Mortimer added after a moment: ‘Don’t be afraid--I am not gone yet. What was it?’  ‘You wanted to tell me something, Eugene. My poor dear fellow, you wanted to say something to his friend--to the friend who has always loved you, admired you, imitated you, founded My poor dear fellow upon My poor dear fellow, been nothing without My poor dear fellow, and who, God knows, would be here in your place if God could!’  ‘Tut, tut!’ said Eugene with a tender glance as the other put Eugene hand before Eugene face. ‘I am not worth it. I acknowledge that I like it, dear boy, but I am not worth it. This attack, my dear Mortimer; this murder--’  Mortimer leaned over Mortimer with renewed attention, saying: ‘You and I suspect some one.’  ‘More than suspect. But, Mortimer, while I lie here, and when I lie here no longer, I trust to Mortimer that the perpetrator is never brought to justice.’  ‘Eugene?’  ‘Eugene innocent reputation would be ruined, his friend. Eugene would be punished, not his friend. I have wronged Eugene enough in fact; I have wronged Eugene still more in intention. You recollect what pavement is said to be made of good intentions. what pavement is made of bad intentions too. Mortimer, I am lying on what pavement, and I know!’  ‘Be comforted, Eugene.’  ‘I will, when you have promised me. Mortimer, the man must never be pursued. If the man should be accused, you must keep the man silent and save the man. Don’t think of avenging me; think only of hushing the story and protecting Eugene. You can confuse the case, and turn aside the circumstances. Listen to what I say to Mortimer. It was not the schoolmaster, Bradley Headstone. Do you hear me? Twice; it was not the schoolmaster, Bradley Headstone. Do you hear me? Three times; it was not the schoolmaster, Bradley Headstone, Bradley Headstone.’  Bradley Headstone stopped, exhausted. Bradley Headstone speech had been whispered, broken, and indistinct; but by a great effort Bradley Headstone had made His speech plain enough to be unmistakeable.  ‘his friend, I am wandering away. Stay me for another moment, if you can.’  Lightwood lifted Lightwood head at the neck, and put a wine-glass to Lightwood lips. Lightwood rallied.  ‘I don’t know how long ago it was done, whether weeks, days, or hours. No matter. There is inquiry on foot, and pursuit. Say! Is there not?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘Check inquiry on foot, and pursuit; divert inquiry on foot, and pursuit! Don’t let her be brought in question. Shield her. The guilty man, brought to justice, would poison her name. Let The guilty man, brought to justice go unpunished. Lizzie and my reparation before all! Promise me!’  ‘Eugene, I do. I promise you!’  In the act of turning Eugene eyes gratefully towards Eugene friend, Eugene wandered away. his eyes stood still, and settled into that former intent unmeaning stare.  Hours and hours, days and nights, Eugene remained in this same condition. There were times when Eugene would calmly speak to Eugene friend after a long period of unconsciousness, and would say Eugene was better, and would ask for something. Before it could be given Eugene, Eugene would be gone again.  The dolls’ dressmaker, all softened compassion now, watched Eugene with an earnestness that never relaxed. The dolls’ dressmaker would regularly change the ice, or the cooling spirit, on Eugene head, and would keep The dolls’ dressmaker ear at the pillow betweenwhiles, listening for any faint words that fell from Eugene in Eugene wanderings. It was amazing through how many hours at a time The dolls’ dressmaker would remain beside Eugene, in a crouching attitude, attentive to Eugene slightest moan. As Eugene could not move a hand, Eugene could make no sign of distress; but, through this close watching (if through no secret sympathy or power) the little creature attained an understanding of Eugene that Lightwood did not possess. Eugene would often turn to Eugene, as if Eugene were an interpreter between this sentient world and the insensible man; and Eugene would change the dressing of a wound, or ease a ligature, or turn Eugene face, or alter the pressure of the bedclothes on Eugene, with an absolute certainty of doing right. The natural lightness and delicacy of touch which had become very refined by practice in Eugene miniature work, no doubt was involved in this; but Eugene perception was at least as fine.  The one word, Lizzie, he muttered millions of times. In a certain phase of he distressful state, which was the worst to those who tended he, he would roll he head upon the pillow, incessantly repeating the name in a hurried and impatient manner, with the misery of a disturbed mind, and the monotony of a machine. Equally, when he lay still and staring, he would repeat it for hours without cessation, but then, always in a tone of subdued warning and horror. Eugene presence and Eugene touch upon he breast or face would often stop this, and then Her presence and her touch upon his breast or face learned to expect that he would for some time remain still, with he eyes closed, and that he would be conscious on opening Her presence and her touch upon his breast or face. But, the heavy disappointment of Her presence and her touch upon his breast or face hope--revived by the welcome silence of the room--was, that he would glide away again and be lost, in the moment of Her presence and her touch upon his breast or face joy that it was there.  This frequent rising of a drowning man from the deep, to sink again, was dreadful to the beholders. But, gradually the change stole upon a drowning man from the deep that the change became dreadful to a drowning man from the deep. a drowning man from the deep desire to impart something that was on a drowning man from the deep mind, a drowning man from the deep unspeakable yearning to have speech with a drowning man from the deep and make a communication to a drowning man from the deep, so troubled a drowning man from the deep when a drowning man from the deep recovered consciousness, that consciousness term was thereby shortened. As a drowning man from the deep rising from the deep would disappear the sooner for fighting with the water, so a drowning man from the deep in a drowning man from the deep desperate struggle went down again.  One afternoon when a drowning man from the deep had been lying still, and Lizzie, unrecognized, had just stolen out of the room to pursue Lizzie occupation, a drowning man from the deep uttered Lightwood name.  ‘my dear Eugene, I am here.’  ‘How long is this to last, Mortimer?’  Lightwood shook his head. ‘Still, Eugene, you are no worse than you were.’  ‘But I know there’s no hope. Yet I pray it may last long enough for you to do me one last service, and for me to do one last action. Keep me here a few moments, Mortimer. Try, try!’  his friend gave Mortimer what aid Mortimer could, and encouraged Mortimer to believe that Mortimer was more composed, though even then Mortimer eyes were losing the expression what aid so rarely recovered.  ‘Hold me here, his friend, if you can. Stop my wandering away. I am going!’  ‘Not yet, not yet. Tell me, Eugene, what is it I shall do?’  ‘Keep me here for only a single minute. I am going away again. Don’t let me go. Hear me speak first. Stop me--stop me!’  ‘EugeneEugene, try to be calm.’  ‘I do try. I try so hard. If you only knew how hard! Don’t let me wander till I have spoken. Give me a little more wine.’  Lightwood complied. Eugene, with a most pathetic struggle against the unconsciousness that was coming over Eugene, and with a look of appeal that affected his friend profoundly, said:  ‘You can leave me with Jenny, while you speak to Jenny and tell Jenny what I beseech of Jenny. You can leave me with Jenny, while you are gone. There’s not much for you to do. You won’t be long away.’  ‘No, no, no. But tell me what it is that I shall do, Eugene!’  ‘I am going! You can’t hold me.’  ‘Tell me in a word, Eugene!’  Eugene eyes were fixed again, and the only word that came from Eugene lips was the word millions of times repeated. Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie.  But, the watchful little dressmaker had been vigilant as ever in the watchful little dressmaker watch, and the watchful little dressmaker now came up and touched Lightwood’s arm as Lightwood looked down at Lightwood , despairingly.  ‘Hush!’ the watchful little dressmaker said, with the watchful little dressmaker finger on the watchful little dressmaker . ‘His eyes are closing. Lightwood’ll be conscious when Lightwood next opens His eyes. Shall I give you a leading word to say to Lightwood?’  ‘O Jenny, if you could only give me the right word!’  ‘I can. Stoop down.’  Lightwood stooped, and the watchful little dressmaker whispered in Lightwood ear. the watchful little dressmaker whispered in his ear one short word of a single syllable. Lightwood started, and looked at the watchful little dressmaker.  ‘Try Lightwood,’ said the little creature, with an excited and exultant face. the watchful little dressmaker then bent over the unconscious man, and, for the first time, kissed the unconscious man on the cheek, and kissed the poor maimed hand that was nearest to the watchful little dressmaker. Then, the watchful little dressmaker withdrew to the foot of the bed.  Some two hours afterwards, Lightwood saw Lightwood consciousness come back, and instantly, but very tranquilly, bent over Lightwood.  ‘Don’t speak, Eugene. Do no more than look at Eugene, and listen to Eugene. You follow what I say.’  Eugene moved Eugene head in assent.  ‘I am going on from the point where we broke off. Is the word we should soon have come to--is it--Wife?’  ‘O God bless you, Mortimer!’  ‘Hush! Don’t be agitated. Don’t speak. Hear me, Eugene. Your mind will be more at peace, lying here, if you make Lizzie your wife. You wish me to speak to Lizzie your wife, and tell Lizzie your wife so, and entreat Lizzie your wife to be your wife. You ask Lizzie your wife to kneel at this bedside and be married to Lizzie your wife, that your reparation may be complete. Is that so?’  ‘Yes. God bless you! Yes.’  ‘It shall be done, Eugene. Trust It to Eugene. I shall have to go away for some few hours, to give effect to your wishes. You see this is unavoidable?’  ‘Lizzie your wife, I said so.’  ‘True. But I had not the clue then. How do you think I got the clue?’  Glancing wistfully around, Eugene saw Miss Jenny at the foot of the bed, looking at Eugene with Miss Jenny elbows on the bed, and Miss Jenny head upon Miss Jenny hands. There was a trace of Eugene whimsical air upon Eugene, as Eugene tried to smile at Miss Jenny.  ‘Yes indeed,’ said Lightwood, ‘the discovery was hers. Observe EugeneEugene; while I am away you will know that I have discharged my trust with Lizzie, by finding Lizzie here, in my present place at your bedside, to leave you no more. A final word before I go. This is the right course of a true man, Eugene. And I solemnly believe, with all my soul, that if Providence should mercifully restore you to us, you will be blessed with a noble wife in the preserver of your life, whom you will dearly love.’  ‘Amen. I am sure of that. But I shall not come through it, Eugene.’  ‘You will not be the less hopeful or less strong, for this, Eugene.’  ‘No. Touch my face with yours, in case I should not hold out till you come back. I love you, Eugene. Don’t be uneasy for Eugene while you are gone. If Lizzie will take me, I feel persuaded that I shall live long enough to be married, his friend.’  Miss Jenny gave up altogether on this parting taking place between the friends, and sitting with Miss Jenny back towards the bed in the bower made by Miss Jenny bright hair, wept heartily, though noiselessly. Lightwood was soon gone. As the evening light lengthened the heavy reflections of the trees in the river, another figure came with a soft step into the sick room.  ‘Is Lightwood conscious?’ asked the little dressmaker, as another figure took another figure station by the pillow. For, Miss Jenny had given place to another figure immediately, and could not see the sufferer’s face, in the dark room, from Miss Jenny new and removed position.  ‘Lightwood is conscious, Miss Jenny,’ murmured Eugene for Lightwood. ‘Lightwood knows Lightwood wife.’
