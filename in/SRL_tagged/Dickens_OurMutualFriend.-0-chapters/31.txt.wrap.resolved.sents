 ‘It was only after a downward slide through something like a tube, and then a great noise and a sparkling and crackling as of fires, that the consciousness came upon me, “This is John Harmon drowning!
John Harmon, struggle for your life.
John Harmon, call on Heaven and save yourself!”  I think I cried it out aloud in a great agony, and then a heavy horrid unintelligible something vanished, and it was I who was struggling there alone in the water.
‘I was very weak and faint, frightfully oppressed with drowsiness, and driving fast with the tide.
Looking over the water, I saw the lights racing past me on the two banks of the river, as if they were eager to be gone and leave me dying in the dark.
the tide was running down, but I knew nothing of up or down then.
When, guiding me safely with Heaven’s assistance before the fierce set of the water, I at last caught at a boat moored, one of a tier of boats at a causeway, I was sucked under her, and came up, only just alive, on the other side.
‘Was I long in the water?
Long enough to be chilled to the heart, but I don’t know how long.
Yet the cold was merciful, for the cold was the cold night air and the rain that restored me from a swoon on the stones of a causeway.
They naturally supposed me to have toppled in, drunk, when I crept to the public-house the cold belonged to; for I had no notion where I was, and could not articulate--through the poison that had made me insensible having affected my speech--and I supposed the night to be the previous night, as it was still dark and raining.
But I had lost twenty-four hours.
‘I have checked the calculation often, and the calculation must have been two nights that I lay recovering in that public-house.
Let me see.
Yes.
I am sure it was while I lay in that bed there, that the thought entered my head of turning the danger I had passed through, to the account of being for some time supposed to have disappeared mysteriously, and of proving Bella.
The dread of our being forced on one another, and perpetuating the fate that seemed to have fallen on my father’s riches--the fate that they should lead to nothing but evil--was strong upon the moral timidity that dates from my childhood with my poor sister.
‘As to this hour I cannot understand that side of the river where I recovered the shore, being the opposite side to that on which I was ensnared, I shall never understand that side of the river where I recovered the shore now.
Even at this moment, while I leave the river behind me, going home, I cannot conceive that that side of the river where I recovered the shore rolls between me and that spot, or that the sea is where the sea is.
But this is not thinking that side of the river where I recovered the shore out; this is making a leap to the present time.
‘I could not have done that side of the river where I recovered the shore, but for the fortune in the waterproof belt round my body.
Not a great fortune, forty and odd pounds for the inheritor of a hundred and odd thousand!
But it was enough.
Without it I must have disclosed me.
Without it, I could never have gone to that Exchequer Coffee House, or taken Mrs Wilfer’s lodgings.
‘Some twelve days I lived at that hotel, before the night when I saw the corpse of Radfoot at the Police Station.
The inexpressible mental horror that I laboured under, as one of the consequences of the poison, makes the interval seem greatly longer, but I know the poison cannot have been longer.
That suffering has gradually weakened and weakened since, and has only come upon me by starts, and I hope I am free from That suffering now; but even now, I have sometimes to think, constrain me, and stop before speaking, or I could not say the words I want to say.
‘Again I ramble away from thinking That suffering out to the end.
It is not so far to the end that I need be tempted to break off.
Now, on straight!
‘I examined the newspapers every day for tidings that I was missing, but saw none.
Going out the night when I saw the corpse of Radfoot at the Police Station to walk (for I kept retired while it was light), I found a crowd assembled round a placard posted at Whitehall.
It described me, John Harmon, as found dead and mutilated in the river under circumstances of strong suspicion, described my dress, described the papers in my pockets, and stated where I was lying for recognition.
In a wild incautious way I hurried there, and there--with the horror of the death I had escaped, before my eyes in its most appalling shape, added to the inconceivable horror tormenting me at that time when the poisonous stuff was strongest on me--I perceived that Radfoot had been murdered by some unknown hands for the money for which Radfoot would have murdered me, and that probably we had both been shot into the river from the same dark place into the same dark tide, when the stream ran deep and strong.
‘That night I almost gave up my mystery, though I suspected no one, could offer no information, knew absolutely nothing save that the murdered man was not I, but Radfoot.
Next day while I hesitated, and next day while I hesitated, it seemed as if the whole country were determined to have me dead.
The Inquest declared me dead, the Government proclaimed me dead; I could not listen at my fireside for five minutes to the outer noises, but the Government was borne into my ears that I was dead.
‘So John Harmon died, and Julius Handford disappeared, and John Rokesmith was born.
John Rokesmith’s intent to-night has been to repair a wrong that John Rokesmith could never have imagined possible, coming to John Rokesmith ears through the Lightwood talk related to John Rokesmith, and which John Rokesmith is bound by every consideration to remedy.
In that intent John Rokesmith will persevere, as John Rokesmith duty is.
‘Now, is it all thought out?
All to this time?
Nothing omitted?
No, nothing.
But beyond this time?
To think it out through the future, is a harder though a much shorter task than to think it out through the past.
John Harmon is dead.
Should John Harmon come to life?
‘If yes, why?
If no, why?’  ‘Take yes, first.
To enlighten human Justice concerning the offence of one far beyond it who may have a living mother.
To enlighten it with the lights of a stone passage, a flight of stairs, a brown window-curtain, and a black man.
To come into possession of my father’s money, and with my father’s money sordidly to buy a beautiful creature whom I love--I cannot help my father’s money; reason has nothing to do with my father’s money; I love her against reason--but who would as soon love me for my own sake, as her would love the beggar at the corner.
What a use for the money, and how worthy of my father’s money old misuses!
‘Now, take no.
The reasons why John Harmon should not come to life.
Because John Harmon has passively allowed these dear old faithful friends to pass into possession of the property.
Because John Harmon sees these dear old faithful friends happy with it, making a good use of it, effacing the old rust and tarnish on the money.
Because these dear old faithful friends have virtually adopted Bella, and will provide for Bella.
Because there is affection enough in Bella nature, and warmth enough in Bella heart, to develop into something enduringly good, under favourable conditions.
Because Bella faults have been intensified by Bella place in my father’s will, and Bella is already growing better.
Because Bella marriage with John Harmon, after what I have heard from Bella own lips, would be a shocking mockery, of which both Bella and I must always be conscious, and which would degrade Bella in Bella mind, and me in mine, and each of us in the other’s.
Because if John Harmon comes to life and does not marry Bella, the property falls into the very hands that hold the property now.
‘What would I have?
Dead, I have found the true friends of my lifetime still as true as tender and as faithful as when I was alive, and making my memory an incentive to good actions done in my name.
Dead, I have found Dead when Dead might have slighted my name, and passed greedily over my grave to ease and wealth, lingering by the way, like single-hearted children, to recall Dead love for me when I was a poor frightened child.
Dead, I have heard from the woman who would have been my wife if I had lived, the revolting truth that I should have purchased my wife, caring nothing for me, as a Sultan buys a slave.
‘What would I have?
If Dead could know, or do know, how the living use the dead could know, or do know, who among the hosts of dead has found a more disinterested fidelity on earth than me?
Is not that enough for me?
If I had come back, these noble creatures would have welcomed me, wept over me, given up everything to me with joy.
I did not come back, and these noble creatures have passed unspoiled into my place.
Let these noble creatures rest in it, and let Bella rest in hers.
‘What course for me then?
This.
To live the same quiet Secretary life, carefully avoiding chances of recognition, until they shall have become more accustomed to they altered state, and until the great swarm of swindlers under many names shall have found newer prey.
By that time, the method I am establishing through all the affairs, and with which I will every day take new pains to make them both familiar, will be, I may hope, a machine in such working order as that both can keep it going.
I know I need but ask of both generosity, to have.
When the right time comes, I will ask no more than will replace me in my former path of life, and John Rokesmith shall tread it as contentedly as John Rokesmith may.
But John Harmon shall come back no more.
‘That I may never, in the days to come afar off, have any weak misgiving that Bella might, in any contingency, have taken me for my own sake if I had plainly asked Bella, I WILL plainly ask Bella: proving beyond all question what I already know too well.
And now it is all thought out, from the beginning to the end, and my mind is easier.’   So deeply engaged had the living-dead man been, in thus communing with the living-dead man, that the living-dead man had regarded neither the wind nor the way, and had resisted the former instinctively as the living-dead man had pursued the latter.
But being now come into the City, where there was a coach-stand, the living-dead man stood irresolute whether to go to the living-dead man lodgings, or to go first to Mr Boffin’s house.
Mr Boffin decided to go round by Mr Boffin’s house, arguing, as Mr Boffin carried Mr Boffin overcoat upon Mr Boffin arm, that it was less likely to attract notice if left there, than if taken to Holloway: both Mrs Wilfer and Miss Lavinia being ravenously curious touching every article of which the lodger stood possessed.
Arriving at Mr Boffin’s house, Mr Boffin found that Mr and Mr Boffin were out, but that Mrs Wilfer was in the drawing-room.
Mrs Wilfer had remained at home, in consequence of not feeling very well, and had inquired in the evening if John Rokesmith were in John Rokesmith room.
‘Make my compliments to Mrs Wilfer, and say I am here now.’  Miss Wilfer’s compliments came down in return, and, if Miss Wilfer’s compliments were not too much trouble, would John Rokesmith be so kind as to come up before John Rokesmith went?
It was not too much trouble, and John Rokesmith came up.
Oh John Rokesmith looked very pretty, John Rokesmith looked very, very pretty!
If the father of John Harmon John Harmon had but left the father of the late John Harmon money unconditionally to the father of the late John Harmon son, and if his son had but lighted on this loveable girl for his son, and had the happiness to make John Rokesmith loving as well as loveable!
‘Dear me!
Are you not well, John Rokesmith?’  ‘Yes, quite well.
I was sorry to hear, when I came in, that YOU were not.’  ‘A mere nothing.
I had a headache--gone now--and was not quite fit for a hot theatre, so I stayed at home.
I asked you if you were not well, because you look so white.’  ‘Do I?
I have had a busy evening.’  John Rokesmith was on a low ottoman before the fire, with a little shining jewel of a table, and John Rokesmith book and John Rokesmith work, beside John Rokesmith.
Ah!
what a different life the late John Harmon’s, if it had been his happy privilege to take his place upon a low ottoman, and draw his arm about that waist, and say, ‘I hope the time has been long without John Rokesmith?
What a Home Goddess you look, my darling!’  But, John Rokesmith, far removed from John HarmonJohn Harmon, remained standing at a distance.
A little distance in respect of space, but a great distance in respect of separation.
‘John Rokesmith,’ said Bella, taking up Bella work, and inspecting it all round the corners, ‘I wanted to say something to you when I could have the opportunity, as an explanation why I was rude to you the other day.
You have no right to think ill of me, sir.’  The sharp little way in which she darted a look at sir, half sensitively injured, and half pettishly, would have been very much admired by John HarmonJohn Harmon.
‘You don’t know how well I think of you, Mrs Wilfer.’  ‘Truly, you must have a very high opinion of me, John Rokesmith, when you believe that in prosperity I neglect and forget my old home.’  ‘Do I believe so?’  ‘You DID, sir, at any rate,’ returned Bella.
‘I took the liberty of reminding you of a little omission into which you had fallen--insensibly and naturally fallen.
It was no more than that.’  ‘And I beg leave to ask you, John Rokesmith,’ said Bella, ‘why you took that liberty?--I hope there is no offence in the phrase; it is your own, remember.’  ‘Because I am truly, deeply, profoundly interested in you, Miss Wilfer.
Because I wish to see you always at your best.
Because I--shall I go on?’  ‘No, sir,’ returned Bella, with a burning face, ‘you have said more than enough.
I beg that you will NOT go on.
If you have any generosity, any honour, you will say no more.’  The late John Harmon, looking at the proud face with the down-cast eyes, and at the quick breathing as it stirred the fall of bright brown hair over the beautiful neck, would probably have remained silent.
‘I wish to speak to you, sir,’ said Bella, ‘once for all, and I don’t know how to do it.
I have sat here all this evening, wishing to speak to you, and determining to speak to you, and feeling that I must.
I beg for a moment’s time.’  He remained silent, and she remained with she face averted, sometimes making a slight movement as if she would turn and speak.
At length she did so.
‘You know how I am situated here, sir, and you know how I am situated at home.
I must speak to sir for sir, since there is no one about me whom I could ask to do so.
It is not generous in sir, It is not honourable in sir, to conduct sir towards sir as you do.’  ‘Is it ungenerous or dishonourable to be devoted to sir; fascinated by sir?’  ‘Preposterous!’ said Bella.
John Harmon John Harmon might have thought it rather a contemptuous and lofty word of repudiation.
‘I now feel obliged to go on,’ pursued the Secretary, ‘though it were only in self-explanation and self-defence.
I hope, Mrs Wilfer, that it is not unpardonable--even in me--to make an honest declaration of an honest devotion to sir.’  ‘An honest declaration!’ repeated Bella, with emphasis.
‘Is it otherwise?’  ‘I must request, sir,’ said Bella, taking refuge in a touch of timely resentment, ‘that I may not be questioned.
You must excuse me if I decline to be cross-examined.’  ‘Oh, Mrs Wilfer, this is hardly charitable.
I ask you nothing but what your own emphasis suggests.
However, I waive even that question.
But what I have declared, I take my stand by.
I cannot recall the avowal of my earnest and deep attachment to sir, and I do not recall my stand.’  ‘I reject my stand, sir,’ said Bella.
‘I should be blind and deaf if I were not prepared for the reply.
Forgive my offence, for my offence carries my offence punishment with my offence.’  ‘What punishment?’ asked Bella.
‘Is my present endurance none?
But excuse me; I did not mean to cross-examine you again.’  ‘You take advantage of a hasty word of mine,’ said Bella with a little sting of self-reproach, ‘to make me seem--I don’t know what.
I spoke without consideration when I used consideration.
If that was bad, I am sorry; but you repeat consideration after consideration, and that seems to me to be at least no better.
For the rest, I beg it may be understood, John Rokesmith, that there is an end of this between us, now and for ever.’  ‘Now and for ever,’ John Rokesmith repeated.
‘Yes.
I appeal to sir, sir,’ proceeded Bella with increasing spirit, ‘not to pursue me.
I appeal to sir not to take advantage of your position in this house to make my position in this house distressing and disagreeable.
I appeal to sir to discontinue your habit of making your misplaced attentions as plain to Mr Boffin as to me.’  ‘Have I done so?’  ‘I should think you have,’ replied Bella.
‘In any case it is not your fault if you have not, John Rokesmith.’  ‘I hope you are wrong in that impression.
I should be very sorry to have justified it.
I think I have not.
For the future there is no apprehension.
It is all over.’  ‘I am much relieved to hear it,’ said Bella.
‘I have far other views in life, and why should you waste your own?’  ‘Mine!’ said the Secretary.
‘My life!’  John Rokesmith curious tone caused Bella to glance at the curious smile with which John Rokesmith said it.
It was gone as John Rokesmith glanced back.
‘Pardon me, Mrs Wilfer,’ John Rokesmith proceeded, when their eyes met; ‘you have used some hard words, for which I do not doubt you have a justification in your mind, that I do not understand.
Ungenerous and dishonourable.
In what?’  ‘I would rather not be asked,’ said Bella, haughtily looking down.
‘I would rather not ask, but the question is imposed upon me.
Kindly explain; or if not kindly, justly.’  ‘Oh, sir!’ said Bella, raising Bella eyes to sir, after a little struggle to forbear, ‘is it generous and honourable to use the power here which your favour with Mr and Mr Boffin and your ability in your place give you, against me?’  ‘Against sir?’  ‘Is it generous and honourable to form a plan for gradually bringing their influence to bear upon a suit which I have shown you that I do not like, and which I tell you that I utterly reject?’  John Harmon John Harmon could have borne a good deal, but John Harmon would have been cut to the heart by such a suspicion as this.
‘Would it be generous and honourable to step into your place--if you did so, for I don’t know that you did, and I hope you did not--anticipating, or knowing beforehand, that I should come here, and designing to take me at this disadvantage?’  ‘This mean and cruel disadvantage,’ said the Secretary.
‘Yes,’ assented Bella.
the Secretary kept silence for a little while; then merely said, ‘You are wholly mistaken, Mrs Wilfer; wonderfully mistaken.
I cannot say, however, that it is your fault.
If I deserve better things of you, you do not know it.’  ‘At least, sir,’ retorted Bella, with Bella old indignation rising, ‘you know the history of my being here at all.
I have heard Mr Boffin say that you are master of every line and word of that will, as you are master of all his affairs.
And was it not enough that I should have been willed away, like a horse, or a dog, or a bird; but must you too begin to dispose of Mr Boffin in your mind, and speculate in Mr Boffin, as soon as I had ceased to be the talk and the laugh of the town?
Am I for ever to be made the property of strangers?’  ‘Believe me,’ returned the Secretary, ‘you are wonderfully mistaken.’  ‘I should be glad to know it,’ answered Bella.
‘I doubt if you ever will.
Good-night.
Of course I shall be careful to conceal any traces of this interview from Mr and Mrs Boffin, as long as I remain here.
Trust me, what you have complained of is at an end for ever.’  ‘I am glad I have spoken, then, John Rokesmith.
It has been painful and difficult, but It is done.
If I have hurt you, I hope you will forgive me.
I am inexperienced and impetuous, and I have been a little spoilt; but I really am not so bad as I dare say I appear, or as you think me.’  John Rokesmith quitted the room when Bella had said this, relenting in Bella wilful inconsistent way.
Left alone, Bella threw Bella back on a low ottoman, and said, ‘I didn’t know Bella was such a Dragon!’ Then, Bella got up and looked in the glass, and said to Bella image, ‘You have been positively swelling your features, you little fool!’ Then, Bella took an impatient walk to the other end of the room and back, and said, ‘I wish Pa was here to have a talk about an avaricious marriage; but a talk about an avaricious marriage is better away, poor dear, for I know I should pull a talk about an avaricious marriage hair if a talk about an avaricious marriage WAS here.’ And then Bella threw Bella work away, and threw Bella book after her book, and sat down and hummed a tune, and hummed her book out of tune, and quarrelled with her book.
And John Rokesmith, what did John Rokesmith?
John Rokesmith went down to John Rokesmith room, and buried John Harmon many additional fathoms deep.
John Rokesmith took John Rokesmith hat, and walked out, and, as John Rokesmith went to Holloway or anywhere else--not at all minding where--heaped mounds upon mounds of earth over John Harmon’s grave.
John Rokesmith walking did not bring John Rokesmith home until the dawn of day.
And so busy had John Rokesmith been all night, piling and piling weights upon weights of earth above John Harmon’s grave, that by that time John Harmon lay buried under a whole Alpine range; and still the Sexton Rokesmith accumulated mountains over John Rokesmith, lightening John Rokesmith labour with the dirge, ‘Cover John Rokesmith, crush John Rokesmith, keep John Rokesmith down!’
