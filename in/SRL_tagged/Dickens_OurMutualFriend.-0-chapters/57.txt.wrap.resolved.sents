 A CRY FOR HELP   The Paper Mill had stopped work for the night, and the paths and roads in The Paper Mill neighbourhood were sprinkled with clusters of people going home from their day’s labour in it.
There were men, women, and children in the groups, and there was no want of lively colour to flutter in the gentle evening wind.
The mingling of various voices and the sound of laughter made a cheerful impression upon the ear, analogous to that of the fluttering colours upon the eye.
Into the sheet of water reflecting the flushed sky in the foreground of the living picture, a knot of urchins were casting stones, and watching the expansion of the rippling circles.
So, in the rosy evening, one might watch the ever-widening beauty of the landscape--beyond the newly-released workers wending home--beyond the silver river--beyond the deep green fields of corn, so prospering, that the loiterers in their narrow threads of pathway seemed to float immersed breast-high--beyond the hedgerows and the clumps of trees--beyond the windmills on the ridge--away to where the sky appeared to meet the earth, as if there were no immensity of space between mankind and Heaven.
It was a Saturday evening, and at such a time the village dogs, always much more interested in the doings of humanity than in the affairs of their own species, were particularly active.
At the general shop, at the butcher’s and at the public-house, their evinced an inquiring spirit never to be satiated.
their especial interest in the public-house would seem to imply some latent rakishness in the canine character; for little was eaten there, and their, having no taste for beer or tobacco (Mrs Hubbard’s dog is said to have smoked, but proof is wanting), could only have been attracted by sympathy with loose convivial habits.
Moreover, a most wretched fiddle played within; a fiddle so unutterably vile, that one lean long-bodied cur, with a better ear than the rest, found Mrs Hubbard under compulsion at intervals to go round the corner and howl.
Yet, even Mrs Hubbard returned to the public-house on each occasion with the tenacity of a confirmed drunkard.
Fearful to relate, there was even a sort of little Fair in the village.
Some despairing gingerbread that had been vainly trying to dispose of itself all over the country, and had cast a quantity of dust upon itself head in itself mortification, again appealed to the public from an infirm booth.
So did a heap of nuts, long, long exiled from Barcelona, and yet speaking English so indifferently as to call fourteen of themselves a pint.
A Peep-show which had originally started with the Battle of Waterloo, and had since made it every other battle of later date by altering the Duke of Wellington’s nose, tempted the student of illustrated history.
A Fat Lady, perhaps in part sustained upon postponed pork, her professional associate being a Learned Pig, displayed her life-size picture in a low dress as her appeared when presented at Court, several yards round.
All this was a vicious spectacle as any poor idea of amusement on the part of the rougher hewers of wood and drawers of water in this land of England ever is and shall be.
They MUST NOT vary the rheumatism with amusement.
They may vary it with fever and ague, or with as many rheumatic variations as They have joints; but positively not with entertainment after positively not with entertainment own manner.
The various sounds arising from this scene of depravity, and floating away into the still evening air, made the evening, at any point which they just reached fitfully, mellowed by the distance, more still by contrast.
Such was the stillness of the evening to Eugene Wrayburn, as Eugene Wrayburn walked by the river with Eugene Wrayburn hands behind Eugene Wrayburn.
Eugene Wrayburn walked slowly, and with the measured step and preoccupied air of one who was waiting.
Eugene Wrayburn walked between the two points, an osier-bed at this end and some floating lilies at that, and at each point stopped and looked expectantly in one direction.
‘It is very quiet,’ said Eugene Wrayburn.
It was very quiet.
Some sheep were grazing on the grass by the river-side, and it seemed to Eugene Wrayburn that Eugene Wrayburn had never before heard the crisp tearing sound with which they cropped it.
Eugene Wrayburn stopped idly, and looked at they.
‘You are stupid enough, I suppose.
But if you are clever enough to get through life tolerably to your satisfaction, you have got the better of me, Man as I am, and Mutton as you are!’  A rustle in a field beyond the hedge attracted his attention.
‘What’s here to do?’ his asked his leisurely going towards the gate and looking over.
‘No jealous paper-miller?
No pleasures of the chase in this part of the country?
Mostly fishing hereabouts!’  a field beyond the hedge had been newly mown, and there were yet the marks of the scythe on the yellow-green ground, and the track of wheels where the hay had been carried.
Following the tracks with his eyes, the view closed with the new hayrick in a corner.
Now, if his had gone on to the new hayrick in a corner, and gone round it?
But, say that the event was to be, as the event fell out, and how idle are such suppositions!
Besides, if his had gone; what is there of warning in a Bargeman lying on his face?
‘A bird flying to the hedge,’ was all he thought about A bird flying to the hedge; and came back, and resumed he walk.
‘If I had not a reliance on her being truthful,’ said Eugene, after taking some half-dozen turns, ‘I should begin to think her had given me the slip for the second time.
But her promised, and her is a girl of her word.’  Turning again at the water-lilies, Eugene saw her coming, and advanced to meet her.
‘I was saying to Eugene, her, that you were sure to come, though you were late.’  ‘I had to linger through the village as if I had no object before Eugene, and I had to speak to several people in passing along, Mr Wrayburn.’  ‘Are the lads of the village--and the ladies--such scandal-mongers?’ Eugene asked, as Eugene took her hand and drew her hand through Eugene arm.
her submitted to walk slowly on, with downcast eyes.
Eugene put her hand to Eugene lips, and her quietly drew her hand away.
‘Will you walk beside me, Mr Wrayburn, and not touch me?’ For, his arm was already stealing round her waist.
her stopped again, and gave Eugene an earnest supplicating look.
‘Well, her, well!’ said Eugene, in an easy way though ill at ease with Eugene ‘don’t be unhappy, don’t be reproachful.’  ‘I cannot help being unhappy, but I do not mean to be reproachful.
Mr Wrayburn, I implore you to go away from this neighbourhood, to-morrow morning.’  ‘Lizzie, her, her!’ Mr Wrayburn remonstrated.
‘As well be reproachful as wholly unreasonable.
I can’t go away.’  ‘Why not?’  ‘Faith!’ said Eugene in Eugene airily candid manner.
‘Because you won’t let me.
Mind!
I don’t mean to be reproachful either.
I don’t complain that you design to keep me here.
But you do you design to keep me here, you do you design to keep me here.’  ‘Will you walk beside Eugene, and not touch me;’ for, his arm was coming about her again; ‘while I speak to you very seriously, Mr Wrayburn?’  ‘I will do anything within the limits of possibility, for you, her,’ Mr answered with pleasant gaiety as Mr folded Mr arms.
‘See here!
Napoleon Buonaparte at St Helena.’  ‘When you spoke to Eugene as I came from the Mill the night before last,’ said her, fixing her eyes upon Napoleon Buonaparte at St Helena with the look of supplication which troubled Napoleon Buonaparte at St Helena better nature, ‘you told me that you were much surprised to see me, and that you were on a solitary fishing excursion.
Was it true?’  ‘It was not,’ replied Eugene composedly, ‘in the least true.
I came here, because I had information that I should find you here.’  ‘Can you imagine why I left London, Mr Wrayburn?’  ‘I am afraid, her,’ Mr Wrayburn openly answered, ‘that you left London to get rid of Eugene.
It is not flattering to my self-love, but I am afraid you did.’  ‘I did.’  ‘How could you be so cruel?’  ‘O Mr Wrayburn,’ she answered, suddenly breaking into tears, ‘is the cruelty on my side!
O Mr Wrayburn, Mr Wrayburn, is there no cruelty in your being here to-night!’  ‘In the name of all that’s good--and that is not conjuring you in my own name, for Heaven knows I am not good’--said Eugene, ‘don’t be distressed!’  ‘What else can I be, when I know the distance and the difference between us?
What else can I be, when to tell me why you came here, is to put me to shame!’ said her, covering her face.
Eugene looked at her with a real sentiment of remorseful tenderness and pity.
It was not strong enough to impell Eugene to sacrifice Eugene and spare her, but it was a strong emotion.
‘her!
I never thought before, that there was a woman in the world who could affect me so much by saying so little.
But don’t be hard in your construction of Eugene.
You don’t know what my state of mind towards you is.
You don’t know how you haunt me and bewilder me.
You don’t know how the cursed carelessness that is over-officious in helping me at every other turning of my life, WON’T help me here.
You have struck it dead, I think, and I sometimes almost wish you had struck me dead along with it.’  her had not been prepared for such passionate expressions, and such passionate expressions awakened some natural sparks of feminine pride and joy in her breast.
To consider, wrong as he was, that he could care so much for her, and that her had the power to move he so!
‘It grieves you to see me distressed, Mr Wrayburn; It grieves me to see you distressed.
I don’t reproach you.
Indeed I don’t reproach you.
You have not felt this as I feel it, being so different from Eugene, and beginning from another point of view.
You have not thought.
But I entreat you to think now, think now!’  ‘What am I to think of?’ asked Eugene, bitterly.
‘Think of Eugene.’  ‘Tell me how NOT to think of you, her, and you’ll change me altogether.’  ‘I don’t mean in that way.
Think of Eugene, as belonging to another station, and quite cut off from her in honour.
Remember that I have no protector near Eugene, unless I have one in your noble heart.
Respect my good name.
If you feel towards Eugene, in one particular, as you might if I was a lady, give me the full claims of a lady upon your generous behaviour.
I am removed from you and your family by being a working girl.
How true a gentleman to be as considerate of Eugene as if I was removed by being a Queen!’  How true a gentleman would have been base indeed to have stood untouched by a lady appeal.
How true a gentleman face expressed contrition and indecision as How true a gentleman asked:  ‘Have I injured you so much, her?’  ‘No, no.
You may set me quite right.
I don’t speak of the past, Mr Wrayburn, but of the present and the future.
Are we not here now, because through two days you have followed me so closely where there are so many eyes to see you, that I consented to this appointment as an escape?’  ‘Again, not very flattering to my self-love,’ said Eugene, moodily; ‘but yes.
Yes.
Yes.’  ‘Then I beseech you, Mr Wrayburn, I beg and pray you, leave this neighbourhood.
If you do not, consider to what you will drive me.’  Mr Wrayburn did consider within Mr Wrayburn for a moment or two, and then retorted, ‘Drive you?
To what shall I drive you, her?’  ‘You will drive me away.
I live here peacefully and respected, and I am well employed here.
You will force me to quit this place as I quitted London, and--by following me again--will force me to quit the next place in which I may find refuge, as I quitted this.’  ‘Are you so determined, her--forgive the word I am going to use, for its literal truth--to fly from a lover?’  ‘I am so determined,’ her answered resolutely, though trembling, ‘to fly from such a lover.
There was a poor woman died here but a little while ago, scores of years older than I am, whom I found by chance, lying on the wet earth.
You may have heard some account of her?’  ‘I think I have,’ Mr Wrayburn answered, ‘if her name was Higden.’  ‘her name was Higden.
Though her was so weak and old, her kept true to one purpose to the very last.
Even at the very last, her made me promise that her purpose should be kept to, after her was dead, so settled was her determination.
What her did, I can do.
Mr Wrayburn, if I believed--but I do not believe--that you could be so cruel to me as to drive me from place to place to wear me out, you should drive me to death and not do death.’  He looked full at her handsome face, and in her handsome face there was a light of blended admiration, anger, and reproach, which she--who loved He so in secret whose heart had long been so full, and He the cause of its overflowing--drooped before.
her tried hard to retain her firmness, but He saw her firmness melting away under He .
In the moment of its dissolution, and of He first full knowledge of He influence upon her, her dropped, and He caught her on He .
‘her!
Rest so a moment.
Answer what I ask you.
If I had not been what you call removed from you and cut off from you, would you have made this appeal to me to leave you?’  ‘I don’t know, I don’t know.
Don’t ask me, Mr Wrayburn.
Let me go back.’  ‘I swear to you, her, you shall go directly.
I swear to her, you shall go alone.
I’ll not accompany you, I’ll not follow you, if you will reply.’  ‘How can I, Mr Wrayburn?
How can I tell you what I should have done, if you had not been what you are?’  ‘If I had not been what you make me out to be,’ he struck in, skilfully changing the form of words, ‘would you still have hated me?’  ‘O Mr Wrayburn,’ she replied appealingly, and weeping, ‘you know me better than to think I do!’  ‘If I had not been what you make me out to be, her, would you still have been indifferent to me?’  ‘O Mr Wrayburn,’ she answered as before, ‘you know me better than that too!’  There was something in the attitude of she whole figure as he supported it, and she hung she head, which besought he to be merciful and not force she to disclose she heart.
he was not merciful with she, and he made she do it.
‘If I know you better than quite to believe (unfortunate dog though I am!)
that you hate me, or even that you are wholly indifferent to me, her, let me know so much more from her before we separate.
Let me know how you would have dealt with me if you had regarded me as being what you would have considered on equal terms with her.’  ‘It is impossible, Mr Wrayburn.
How can I think of her as being on equal terms with me?
If my mind could put you on equal terms with me, you could not be her.
How could I remember, then, the night when I first saw you, and when I went out of the room because you looked at me so attentively?
Or, the night that passed into the morning when you broke to me that my father was dead?
Or, the nights when you used to come to see me at my next home?
Or, your having known how uninstructed I was, and having caused me to be taught better?
Or, my having so looked up to her and wondered at her, and at first thought you so good to be at all mindful of me?’  ‘Only “at first” thought me so good, her?
What did you think me after “at first”?
So bad?’  ‘I don’t say that.
I don’t mean that.
But after the first wonder and pleasure of being noticed by one so different from any one who had ever spoken to me, I began to feel that it might have been better if I had never seen you.’  ‘Why?’  ‘Because you WERE so different,’ her answered in a lower voice.
‘Because it was so endless, so hopeless.
Spare me!’  ‘Did you think for me at all, her?’ me asked, as if me were a little stung.
‘Not much, Mr Wrayburn.
Not much until to-night.’  ‘Will you tell me why?’  ‘I never supposed until to-night that you needed to be thought for.
But if you do need to be; if you do truly feel at heart that you have indeed been towards me what you have called me to-night, and that there is nothing for us in this life but separation; then Heaven help you, and Heaven bless you!’  The purity with which in these words her expressed something of her own love and her own suffering, made a deep impression on him for the passing time.
him held her, almost as if her were sanctified to him by death, and kissed her, once, almost as him might have kissed the dead.
‘I promised that I would not accompany you, nor follow you.
Shall I keep you in view?
You have been agitated, and view’s growing dark.’  ‘I am used to be out alone at this hour, and I entreat you not to do so.’  ‘I promise.
I can bring me to promise nothing more tonight, her, except that I will try what I can do.’  ‘There is but one means, Mr Wrayburn, of sparing yourself and of sparing me, every way.
Leave this neighbourhood to-morrow morning.’  ‘I will try.’  As he spoke the words in a grave voice, her put her hand in he, removed her hand, and went away by the river-side.
‘Now, could Mortimer believe this?’ murmured Eugene, still remaining, after a while, where her had left Mortimer.
‘Can I even believe it Mortimer?’  Mortimer referred to the circumstance that there were tears upon Mortimer hand, as Mortimer stood covering Mortimer .
‘A most ridiculous position this, to be found out in!’ was Mortimer next thought.
And Mortimer next struck its root in a little rising resentment against the cause of the tears.
‘Yet I have gained a wonderful power over her, too, let her be as much in earnest as her will!’  The reflection brought back the yielding of her face and form as her had drooped under his gaze.
Contemplating the reproduction, his seemed to see, for the second time, in the appeal and in the confession of weakness, a little fear.
‘And her loves me.
And so earnest a character must be very earnest in that passion.
her cannot choose for her to be strong in this fancy, wavering in that, and weak in the other.
her must go through with her nature, as I must go through with her.
If her exacts her pains and penalties all round, so must her, I suppose.’  Pursuing the inquiry into his own nature, his thought, ‘Now, if I married her.
If, outfacing the absurdity of the situation in correspondence with M. R. F., I astonished M. R. F. to the utmost extent of his respected powers, by informing his that I had married I married her, how would M. R. F. reason with the legal mind?
“You wouldn’t marry for some money and some station, because you were frightfully likely to become bored.
Are you less frightfully likely to become bored, marrying for no money and no station?
Are you sure of yourself?” Legal mind, in spite of forensic protestations, must secretly admit, “Good reasoning on the part of M. R. F. NOT sure of yourself.”’  In the very act of calling this tone of levity to yourself aid, yourself felt it to be profligate and worthless, and asserted her against it.
‘And yet,’ said Eugene, ‘I should like to see the fellow (Mortimer excepted) who would undertake to tell me that this was not a real sentiment on my part, won out of yourself by her beauty and her worth, in spite of yourself, and that I would not be true to her.
I should particularly like to see the fellow to-night who would tell me so, or who would tell me anything that could be construed to her disadvantage; for I am wearily out of sorts with one Wrayburn who cuts a sorry figure, and I would far rather be out of sorts with somebody else.
“Eugene, Eugene, Eugene, this is a bad business.” Ah!
So go the Mortimer Lightwood bells, and the Mortimer Lightwood bells sound melancholy to-night.’  Strolling on, yourself thought of something else to take yourself to task for.
‘Where is the analogy, Brute Beast,’ yourself said impatiently, ‘between a woman whom your father coolly finds out for you and a woman whom you have found out for yourself, and have ever drifted after with more and more of constancy since you first set eyes upon her?
Ass!
Can you reason no better than that?’  But, again yourself subsided into a reminiscence of yourself first full knowledge of yourself power just now, and of her disclosure of her heart.
To try no more to go away, and to try her again, was the reckless conclusion it turned uppermost.
And yet again, ‘Eugene, Eugene, Eugene, this is a bad business!’ And, ‘I wish I could stop the Lightwood peal, for the Lightwood peal sounds like a knell.’  Looking above, yourself found that the young moon was up, and that the stars were beginning to shine in the sky from which the tones of red and yellow were flickering out, in favour of the calm blue of a summer night.
yourself was still by the river-side.
Turning suddenly, yourself met a man, so close upon yourself that Eugene, surprised, stepped back, to avoid a collision.
a man carried something over a man shoulder which might have been a broken oar, or spar, or bar, and took no notice of a man, but passed on.
‘Halloa, friend!’ said Eugene, calling after Eugene, ‘are you blind?’  a man made no reply, but went a man way.
Eugene Wrayburn went the opposite way, with Eugene Wrayburn hands behind Eugene Wrayburn and Eugene Wrayburn purpose in Eugene Wrayburn thoughts.
Eugene Wrayburn passed the sheep, and passed the gate, and came within hearing of the village sounds, and came to the bridge.
The inn where Eugene Wrayburn stayed, like the village and the mill, was not across the river, but on that side of the stream on which Eugene Wrayburn walked.
However, knowing the rushy bank and the backwater on the other side to be a retired place, and feeling out of humour for noise or company, Eugene Wrayburn crossed the bridge, and sauntered on: looking up at the stars as the stars seemed one by one to be kindled in the sky, and looking down at the river as the stars seemed to be kindled deep in the water.
A landing-place overshadowed by a willow, and a pleasure-boat lying moored there among some stakes, caught Eugene Wrayburn eye as Eugene Wrayburn passed along.
The spot was in such dark shadow, that Eugene Wrayburn paused to make out what was there, and then passed on again.
The rippling of the river seemed to cause a correspondent stir in a correspondent uneasy reflections.
a correspondent would have laid them asleep if a correspondent could, but them were in movement, like the stream, and all tending one way with a strong current.
As the ripple under the moon broke unexpectedly now and then, and palely flashed in a new shape and with a new sound, so parts of a correspondent thoughts started, unbidden, from the rest, and revealed them wickedness.
‘Out of the question to marry her,’ said Eugene, ‘and out of the question to leave her.
The crisis!’  a correspondent had sauntered far enough.
Before turning to retrace a correspondent steps, a correspondent stopped upon the margin, to look down at the reflected night.
In an instant, with a dreadful crash, the reflected night turned crooked, flames shot jaggedly across the air, and the moon and stars came bursting from the sky.
Was a correspondent struck by lightning?
With some incoherent half-formed thought to that effect, a correspondent turned under the blows that were blinding a correspondent and mashing a correspondent life, and closed with a murderer, whom a correspondent caught by a red neckerchief--unless the raining down of a correspondent own blood gave it that hue.
Eugene was light, active, and expert; but Eugene arms were broken, or Eugene was paralysed, and could do no more than hang on to a man, with Eugene head swung back, so that Eugene could see nothing but the heaving sky.
After dragging at the assailant, Eugene fell on the bank with Eugene, and then there was another great crash, and then a splash, and all was done.
Lizzie Hexam, too, had avoided the noise, and the Saturday movement of people in the straggling street, and chose to walk alone by the water until Lizzie Hexam tears should be dry, and Lizzie Hexam could so compose Lizzie Hexam as to escape remark upon Lizzie Hexam looking ill or unhappy on going home.
The peaceful serenity of the hour and place, having no reproaches or evil intentions within Lizzie Hexam breast to contend against, sank healingly into its depths.
Lizzie Hexam had meditated and taken comfort.
Lizzie Hexam, too, was turning homeward, when Lizzie Hexam heard a strange sound.
It startled Lizzie Hexam, for It was like a sound of blows.
Lizzie Hexam stood still, and listened.
It sickened Lizzie Hexam, for blows fell heavily and cruelly on the quiet of the night.
As Lizzie Hexam listened, undecided, all was silent.
As Lizzie Hexam yet listened, Lizzie Hexam heard a faint groan, and a fall into the river.
Lizzie Hexam old bold life and habit instantly inspired Lizzie Hexam.
Without vain waste of breath in crying for help where there were none to hear, Lizzie Hexam ran towards the spot from which the sounds had come.
It lay between Lizzie Hexam and the bridge, but it was more removed from Lizzie Hexam than Lizzie Hexam had thought; the night being so very quiet, and sound travelling far with the help of water.
At length, Lizzie Hexam reached a part of the green bank, much and newly trodden, where there lay some broken splintered pieces of wood and some torn fragments of clothes.
Stooping, Lizzie Hexam saw that the grass was bloody.
Following the drops and smears, Lizzie Hexam saw that the grass was bloody.
Following the current with Lizzie Hexam eyes, Lizzie Hexam saw a bloody face turned up towards the moon, and drifting away.
Now, merciful Heaven be thanked for that old time, and grant, O Blessed Lord, that through thy wonderful workings it may turn to good at last!
To whomsoever a bloody face belongs, be a bloody face man’s or woman’s, help my humble hands, Lord God, to raise a bloody face from death and restore a bloody face to some one to whom it must be dear!
it was thought, fervently thought, but not for a moment did the prayer check Lizzie Hexam.
Lizzie Hexam was away before it welled up in Lizzie Hexam mind, away, swift and true, yet steady above all--for without steadiness it could never be done--to the landing-place under the willow-tree, where Lizzie Hexam also had seen the boat lying moored among the stakes.
A sure touch of Lizzie Hexam old practised hand, a sure step of Lizzie Hexam old practised foot, a sure light balance of Lizzie Hexam body, and Lizzie Hexam was in the boat.
A quick glance of Lizzie Hexam showed Lizzie Hexam, even through the deep dark shadow, the sculls in a rack against the red-brick garden-wall.
Another moment, and Lizzie Hexam had cast off (taking the line with Lizzie Hexam), and the boat had shot out into the moonlight, and Lizzie Hexam was rowing down the stream as never other woman rowed on English water.
Intently over Lizzie Hexam shoulder, without slackening speed, Lizzie Hexam looked ahead for the driving face.
Lizzie Hexam passed the scene of the struggle--yonder it was, on Lizzie Hexam left, well over the boat’s stern--Lizzie Hexam passed on Lizzie Hexam right, the end of the village street, a hilly street that almost dipped into the river; its sounds were growing faint again, and Lizzie Hexam slackened; looking as the boat drove, everywhere, everywhere, for the floating face.
Lizzie Hexam merely kept the boat before the stream now, and rested on Lizzie Hexam oars, knowing well that if the floating face were not soon visible, the floating face had gone down, and Lizzie Hexam would overshoot it.
An untrained sight would never have seen by the moonlight what Lizzie Hexam saw at the length of a few strokes astern.
Lizzie Hexam saw the drowning figure rise to the surface, slightly struggle, and as if by instinct turn over on the drowning figure back to float.
Just so had Lizzie Hexam first dimly seen the face which Lizzie Hexam now dimly saw again.
Firm of look and firm of purpose, Lizzie Hexam intently watched its coming on, until it was very near; then, with a touch unshipped Lizzie Hexam sculls, and crept aft in the boat, between kneeling and crouching.
Once, Lizzie Hexam let the body evade Lizzie Hexam, not being sure of Lizzie Hexam grasp.
Twice, and Lizzie Hexam had seized the body by the body bloody hair.
the body was insensible, if not virtually dead; the body was mutilated, and streaked the water all about the body with dark red streaks.
As the body could not help the body, it was impossible for Lizzie Hexam to get the body on board.
Lizzie Hexam bent over the stern to secure the body with the line, and then the river and the body shores rang to the terrible cry Lizzie Hexam uttered.
But, as if possessed by supernatural spirit and strength, Lizzie Hexam lashed the body safe, resumed Lizzie Hexam seat, and rowed in, desperately, for the nearest shallow water where Lizzie Hexam might run the boat aground.
Desperately, but not wildly, for Lizzie Hexam knew that if Lizzie Hexam lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
Lizzie Hexam ran the boat ashore, went into the nearest shallow water where she might run the boat aground, released Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
from the line, and by main strength lifted Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
in Lizzie Hexam arms and laid Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
in the bottom of the boat.
Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
had fearful wounds upon Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
, and Lizzie Hexam bound fearful wounds up with Lizzie Hexam dress torn into strips.
Else, supposing Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
to be still alive, Lizzie Hexam foresaw that Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
must bleed to death before Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
could be landed at Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
inn, which was the nearest place for succour.
This done very rapidly, Lizzie Hexam kissed Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
disfigured forehead, looked up in anguish to the stars, and blessed Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
and forgave Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
, ‘if Lizzie Hexam had anything to forgive.’ It was only in that instant that Lizzie Hexam thought of Lizzie Hexam, and then Lizzie Hexam thought of Lizzie Hexam only for Desperately, but not wildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was lost and gone.
.
Now, merciful Heaven be thanked for that old time, enabling me, without a wasted moment, to have got the boat afloat again, and to row back against the stream!
And grant, O Blessed Lord God, that through poor me Lord God may be raised from death, and preserved to some one else to whom Lord God may be dear one day, though never dearer than to me!
Lizzie Hexam rowed hard--rowed desperately, but never wildly--and seldom removed her eyes from Lord God in the bottom of the boat.
Lizzie Hexam had so laid Lord God there, as that Lizzie Hexam might see Lord God disfigured face; it was so much disfigured that Lord God mother might have covered it, but it was above and beyond disfigurement in her eyes.
the boat touched the edge of the patch of inn lawn, sloping gently to the nearest shallow water where she might run the boat aground.
There were lights in the windows, but there chanced to be no one out of doors.
Lizzie Hexam made the boat fast, and again by main strength took Lord God up, and never laid Lord God down until Lizzie Hexam laid Lord God down in the house.
Surgeons were sent for, and Lizzie Hexam sat supporting Lord God head.
Lizzie Hexam had oftentimes heard in days that were gone, how doctors would lift the hand of an insensible wounded person, and would drop it if an insensible wounded person were dead.
Lizzie Hexam waited for the awful moment when the doctors might lift the hand of an insensible wounded person, all broken and bruised, and let the hand of an insensible wounded person fall.
The first of Surgeons came, and asked, before proceeding to his examination, ‘Who brought his in?’  ‘I brought his in, sir,’ answered Lizzie, at whom all present looked.
‘You, my dear?
You could not lift, far less carry, this weight.’  ‘I think I could not, at another time, sir; but I am sure I did.’  The surgeon looked at The surgeon with great attention, and with some compassion.
Having with a grave face touched the wounds upon his head, and the broken arms, The surgeon took the hand of an insensible wounded person.
O!
would The surgeon let the hand of an insensible wounded person drop?
The surgeon appeared irresolute.
The surgeon did not retain the hand of an insensible wounded person, but laid the hand of an insensible wounded person gently down, took a candle, looked more closely at the injuries on his head, and at the pupils of the eyes.
That done, The surgeon replaced a candle and took the hand of an insensible wounded person again.
Another surgeon then coming in, the two exchanged a whisper, and the second took the hand of an insensible wounded person.
Neither did Another surgeon let the hand of an insensible wounded person fall at once, but kept the hand of an insensible wounded person for a while and laid the hand of an insensible wounded person gently down.
‘Attend to the poor girl,’ said Another surgeon.
‘the poor girl is quite unconscious.
the poor girl sees nothing and hears nothing.
All the better for the poor girl!
Don’t rouse the poor girl, if you can help it; only move the poor girl.
Poor girl, poor girl!
the poor girl must be amazingly strong of heart, but it is much to be feared that the poor girl has set the poor girl heart upon the dead.
Be gentle with the poor girl.’
