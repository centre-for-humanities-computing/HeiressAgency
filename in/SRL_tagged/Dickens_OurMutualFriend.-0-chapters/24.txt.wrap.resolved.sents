 IN WHICH A FRIENDLY MOVE IS ORIGINATED   The arrangement between Mr Boffin and Mr Boffin literary man, Mr Silas Wegg, so far altered with the altered habits of Mr Boffin life, as that the Roman Empire usually declined in the morning and in the eminently aristocratic family mansion, rather than in the evening, as of yore, and in Boffin’s Bower.
There were occasions, however, when Mr Boffin, seeking a brief refuge from the blandishments of fashion, would present Mr Boffin at Boffin’s Bower after dark, to anticipate the next sallying forth of Wegg, and would there, on the old settle, pursue the downward fortunes of those enervated and corrupted masters of the world who were by this time on their last legs.
If Wegg had been worse paid for Wegg office, or better qualified to discharge Wegg, Wegg would have considered these visits complimentary and agreeable; but, holding the position of a handsomely-remunerated humbug, Wegg resented these visits.
This was quite according to rule, for the incompetent servant, by whomsoever employed, is always against the incompetent servant employer.
Even those born governors, noble and right honourable creatures, who have been the most imbecile in high places, have uniformly shown Even those born governors, noble and right honourable creatures, who have been the most imbecile in high places the most opposed (sometimes in belying distrust, sometimes in vapid insolence) to THEIR employer.
What is in such wise true of the public master and servant, is equally true of the private master and servant all the world over.
When Wegg did at last obtain free access to ‘Our House’, as Wegg had been wont to call the mansion outside which Wegg had sat shelterless so long, and when Wegg did at last find it in all particulars as different from Wegg mental plans of it as according to the nature of things it well could be, that far-seeing and far-reaching character, by way of asserting Wegg and making out a case for compensation, affected to fall into a melancholy strain of musing over the mournful past; as if the house and Wegg had had a fall in life together.
‘And this, sir,’ Wegg would say to sir patron, sadly nodding Wegg head and musing, ‘was once House!
This, sir, is the building from which I have so often seen those great creatures, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker’--whose very names were of Uncle Parker’--whose own inventing--‘pass and repass!
And has it come to this, indeed!
Ah dear me, dear me!’  So tender were Uncle Parker’--whose lamentations, that the kindly Mr Boffin was quite sorry for Uncle Parker’--whose, and almost felt mistrustful that in buying the house Uncle Parker’--whose had done Uncle Parker’--whose an irreparable injury.
Two or three diplomatic interviews, the result of great subtlety on Mr Wegg’s part, but assuming the mask of careless yielding to a fortuitous combination of circumstances impelling Uncle Parker’--whose towards Clerkenwell, had enabled Uncle Parker’--whose to complete Uncle Parker’--whose bargain with Mr Venus.
‘Bring me round to the Bower,’ said Silas, when his bargain was closed, ‘next Saturday evening, and if a sociable glass of old Jamaikey warm should meet your views, I am not the man to begrudge it.’  ‘You are aware of my being poor company, sir,’ replied Mr Venus, ‘but be it so.’  It being so, here is Saturday evening come, and here is Mr Venus come, and ringing at the Bower-gate.
Mr Wegg opens the Bower-gate, descries a sort of brown paper truncheon under Mr Venus’s arm, and remarks, in a dry tone: ‘Oh!
I thought perhaps you might have come in a cab.’  ‘No, Mr Wegg,’ replies Mr Venus.
‘I am not above a parcel.’  ‘Above a parcel!
No!’ says Mr Wegg, with some dissatisfaction.
But does not openly growl, ‘a certain sort of parcel might be above you.’  ‘Here is your purchase, Mr Wegg,’ says Mr Venus, politely handing it over, ‘and I am glad to restore it to the source from whence the source--flowed.’  ‘Thankee,’ says Mr Wegg.
‘Now this affair is concluded, I may mention to you in a friendly way that I’ve my doubts whether, if I had consulted a lawyer, you could have kept this article back from me.
I only throw this article out as a legal point.’  ‘Do you think so, Mr Wegg?
I bought you in open contract.’  ‘You can’t buy human flesh and blood in this country, sir; not alive, you can’t,’ says Mr Wegg, shaking sir head.
‘Then query, bone?’  ‘As a legal point?’ asks Mr Venus.
‘As a legal point.’  ‘I am not competent to speak upon that, Mr Wegg,’ says Venus, reddening and growing something louder; ‘but upon a point of fact I think me competent to speak; and as a point of fact I would have seen you--will you allow me to say, further?’  ‘I wouldn’t say more than further, if I was you,Mr Wegg suggests, pacifically.
--‘Before I’d have given that packet into your hand without being paid my price for that packet.
I don’t pretend to know how the point of law may stand, but I’m thoroughly confident upon the point of fact.’  As Mr Venus is irritable (no doubt owing to his disappointment in love), and as it is not the cue of Mr Wegg to have his out of temper, the latter gentleman soothingly remarks, ‘I only put it as a little case; I only put it ha’porthetically.’  ‘Then I’d rather, Mr Wegg, you put it another time, penn’orth-etically,’ is Mr Venus’s retort, ‘for I tell you candidly I don’t like your little cases.’  Arrived by this time in Mr Wegg’s sitting-room, made bright on the chilly evening by gaslight and fire, Mr Venus softens and compliments Mr Wegg on Mr Wegg abode; profiting by the occasion to remind Mr Wegg that Mr Wegg (Venus) told Mr Wegg Mr Wegg had got into a good thing.
‘Tolerable,’ Wegg rejoins.
‘But bear in mind, Mr Venus, that there’s no gold without no gold alloy.
Mix for yourself and take a seat in the chimbley-corner.
Will you perform upon a pipe, sir?’  ‘I am but an indifferent performer, sir,’ returns the other; ‘but I’ll accompany you with a whiff or two at intervals.’  So, Mr Venus mixes, and Mr Wegg mixes; and Mr Venus lights and puffs, and Wegg lights and puffs.
‘And there’s alloy even in this metal of yours, Mr Wegg, you was remarking?’  ‘Mystery,’ returns Mr Wegg.
‘I don’t like it, Mr Venus.
I don’t like to have the life knocked out of former inhabitants of this house, in the gloomy dark, and not know who did this house.’  ‘Might you have any suspicions, Mr Wegg?’  ‘No,’ returns that gentleman.
‘I know who profits by this house.
But I’ve no suspicions.’  Having said which, Mr Wegg smokes and looks at the fire with a most determined expression of Charity; as if Mr Wegg had caught that cardinal virtue by the skirts as Mr Wegg felt it Mr Wegg painful duty to depart from Mr Wegg, and held Mr Wegg by main force.
‘Similarly,’ resumes Mr Wegg, ‘I have observations as I can offer upon certain points and parties; but I make no objections, Mr Venus.
Here is an immense fortune drops from the clouds upon a person that shall be nameless.
Here is a weekly allowance, with a certain weight of coals, drops from the clouds upon me.
Which of us is the better man?
Not the person that shall be nameless.
That’s an observation of mine, but I don’t make it an objection.
I take my allowance and my certain weight of coals.
the better man takes the better man fortune.
That’s the way it works.’  ‘It would be a good thing for me, if I could see things in the calm light you do, Mr Wegg.’  ‘Again look here,’ pursues Silas, with an oratorical flourish of Silas pipe and Silas wooden leg: the latter having an undignified tendency to tilt Silas back in Silas chair; ‘here’s another observation, Mr Venus, unaccompanied with an objection.
Silas that shall be nameless is liable to be talked over.
Silas gets talked over.
Silas that shall be nameless, having me at Silas right hand, naturally looking to be promoted higher, and you may perhaps say meriting to be promoted higher--’  (Mr Venus murmurs that Silas does say so.)
‘--Him that shall be nameless, under such circumstances passes me by, and puts a talking-over stranger above my head.
Which of us two is the better man?
Which of us two can repeat most poetry?
Which of us two has, in the service of the better man that shall be nameless, tackled the Romans, both civil and military, till the better man has got as husky as if the better man’d been weaned and ever since brought up on sawdust?
Not the talking-over stranger.
Yet the house is as free to the better man as if the house was the better man, and the better man has the better man room, and is put upon a footing, and draws about a thousand a year.
I am banished to the Bower, to be found in the house like a piece of furniture whenever wanted.
Merit, therefore, don’t win.
That’s the way it works.
I observe it, because I can’t help observing it, being accustomed to take a powerful sight of notice; but I don’t object.
Ever here before, Mr Venus?’  ‘Not inside the gate, Mr Wegg.’  ‘You’ve been as far as the gate then, Mr Venus?’  ‘Yes, Mr Wegg, and peeped in from curiosity.’  ‘Did you see anything?’  ‘Nothing but the dust-yard.’  Mr Wegg rolls Mr Wegg eyes all round his room, in that ever unsatisfied quest of Mr Wegg, and then rolls Mr Wegg eyes all round Mr Venus; as if suspicious of Mr Wegg having something about Mr Wegg to be found out.
‘And yet, sir,’ sir pursues, ‘being acquainted with old Mr Harmon, one would have thought it might have been polite in you, too, to give sir a call.
And you’re naturally of a polite disposition, you are.’ This last clause as a softening compliment to Mr Venus.
‘It is true, sir,’ replies Mr Venus, winking sir weak eyes, and running sir fingers through sir dusty shock of hair, ‘that I was so, before a certain observation soured me.
You understand to what I allude, Mr Wegg?
To a certain written statement respecting not wishing to be regarded in a certain light.
Since that, all is fled, save gall.’  ‘Not all,’ says Mr Wegg, in a tone of sentimental condolence.
‘Yes, sir,’ returns Mr Venus, ‘all!
The world may deem it harsh, but I’d quite as soon pitch into my best friend as not.
Indeed, I’d sooner!’  Involuntarily making a pass with Involuntarily wooden leg to guard Involuntarily as Mr Venus springs up in the emphasis of this unsociable declaration, Mr Wegg tilts over on Mr Wegg back, chair and all, and is rescued by that harmless misanthrope, in a disjointed state and ruefully rubbing Involuntarily head.
‘Why, you lost your balance, Mr Wegg,’ says Mr Venus, handing Involuntarily Involuntarily pipe.
‘And about time to do it,’ grumbles Silas, ‘when a man’s visitors, without a word of notice, conduct ’s visitors with the sudden wiciousness of Jacks-in-boxes!
Don’t come flying out of his chair like that, Mr Venus!’  ‘I ask your pardon, Mr Wegg.
I am so soured.’  ‘Yes, but hang it,’ says Mr Wegg argumentatively, ‘a well-governed mind can be soured sitting!
And as to being regarded in lights, there’s bumpey lights as well as bony.
IN which,’ again rubbing his head, ‘I object to regard his.’  ‘I’ll bear it in memory, sir.’  ‘If you’ll be so good.’ Mr Wegg slowly subdues Mr Wegg ironical tone and Mr Wegg lingering irritation, and resumes his pipe.
‘We were talking of old Mr Harmon being a friend of yours.’  ‘Not a friend, Mr Wegg.
Only known to speak to, and to have a little deal with now and then.
A very inquisitive character, Mr Wegg, regarding what was found in the dust.
As inquisitive as secret.’  ‘Ah!
You found old Mr Harmon secret?’ returns Mr Wegg, with a greedy relish.
‘old Mr Harmon had always the look of it, and the manner of it.’  ‘Ah!’ with another roll of old Mr Harmon eyes.
‘As to what was found in the dust now.
Did you ever hear old Mr Harmon mention how old Mr Harmon found it, a friend of yours?
Living on the mysterious premises, one would like to know.
For instance, where old Mr Harmon found things?
Or, for instance, how old Mr Harmon set about it?
Whether old Mr Harmon began at the top of the mounds, or whether old Mr Harmon began at the bottom.
Whether old Mr Harmon prodded’; Mr Wegg’s pantomime is skilful and expressive here; ‘or whether old Mr Harmon scooped?
Should you say scooped, my dear Mr Venus; or should you as a man--say prodded?’  ‘I should say neither, Mr Wegg.’  ‘As a fellow-man, Mr Venus--mix again--why neither?’  ‘Because I suppose, sir, that what was found, was found in the sorting and sifting.
All the mounds are sorted and sifted?’  ‘You shall see ‘em and pass your opinion.
Mix again.’  On each occasion of old Mr Harmon saying ‘mix again’, Mr Wegg, with a hop on Mr Wegg wooden leg, hitches Mr Wegg a little nearer; more as if Mr Wegg were proposing that Mr Wegg and Mr Venus should mix again, than that himself and Mr Venus should replenish himself and Mr Venus glasses.
‘Living (as I said before) on the mysterious premises,’ says Mr Wegg when the other has acted on Mr Wegg hospitable entreaty, ‘one likes to know.
Would you be inclined to say now--as a brother--that Mr Wegg ever hid things in the dust, as well as found ‘em?’  ‘Mr Wegg, on the whole I should say Mr Wegg might.’  Mr Wegg claps on Mr Wegg spectacles, and admiringly surveys Mr Venus from head to foot.
‘As a mortal equally with myself, whose hand I take in mine for the first time this day, having unaccountably overlooked that act so full of boundless confidence binding a fellow-creetur TO a fellow creetur,’ says Wegg, holding Mr Venus’s palm out, flat and ready for smiting, and now smiting it; ‘as such--and no other--for I scorn all lowlier ties betwixt myself and the man walking with Mr Wegg face erect that alone I call my Twin--regarded and regarding in this trustful bond--what do you think Mr Wegg might have hid?’  ‘It is but a supposition, Mr Wegg.’  ‘As a Being with Mr Wegg hand upon Mr Wegg heart,’ cries Wegg; and the apostrophe is not the less impressive for the Being’s hand being actually upon Mr Wegg rum and water; ‘put your supposition into language, and bring your supposition out, Mr Venus!’  ‘Mr Wegg was the species of old gentleman, sir,’ slowly returns that practical anatomist, after drinking, ‘that I should judge likely to take such opportunities as this place offered, of stowing away money, valuables, maybe papers.’  ‘As one that was ever an ornament to human life,’ says Mr Wegg, again holding out Mr Venus’s palm as if Mr Venus’s were going to tell Mr Venus’s fortune by chiromancy, and holding Mr Venus’s own up ready for smiting it when the time should come; ‘as one that the poet might have had the poet eye on, in writing the national naval words:       Helm a-weather, now lay her close,             Yard arm and yard arm her lies;      Again, cried I, Mr Venus, give her t’other dose,             Man shrouds and grapple, sir, or her flies!
--that is to say, regarded in the light of true British Oak, for such you are explain, Mr Venus, the expression “papers”!’  ‘Seeing that the old gentleman was generally cutting off some near relation, or blocking out some natural affection,’ Mr Venus rejoins, ‘he most likely made a good many wills and codicils.’  The palm of Mr Wegg descends with a sounding smack upon the palm of Mr Venus, and Mr Wegg lavishly exclaims, ‘Twin in opinion equally with feeling!
Mix a little more!’  Having now hitched his wooden leg and his close in front of Mr Venus, Mr Wegg rapidly mixes for both, gives Mr Wegg visitor Mr Wegg glass, touches his visitor rim with the rim of Mr Wegg own, puts Mr Wegg own to Mr Wegg lips, puts his visitor down, and spreading Mr Wegg hands on his visitor’s knees thus addresses Mr Wegg:  ‘Mr Venus.
It ain’t that I object to being passed over for a stranger, though I regard a stranger as a more than doubtful customer.
It ain’t for the sake of making money, though money is ever welcome.
It ain’t for Mr Wegg, though I am not so haughty as to be above doing Mr Wegg a good turn.
It’s for the cause of the right.’  Mr Venus, passively winking Mr Wegg weak eyes both at once, demands: ‘What is, Mr Wegg?’  ‘The friendly move, sir, that I now propose.
You see the move, sir?’  ‘Till you have pointed I now propose out, Mr Wegg, I can’t say whether I do or not.’  ‘If there IS anything to be found on these premises, let us find there IS anything to be found on these premises together.
Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to look for there IS anything to be found on these premises together.
Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to share the profits of there IS anything to be found on these premises equally betwixt us.
In the cause of the right.’ Thus Silas assuming a noble air.
‘Then,’ says Mr Venus, looking up, after meditating with his hair held in his , as if his could only fix his attention by fixing his head; ‘if anything was to be unburied from under the dust, it would be kept a secret by you and me?
Would that be it, Mr Wegg?’  ‘That would depend upon what it was, Mr Venus.
Say it was money, or plate, or jewellery, it would be as much ours as anybody else’s.’  Mr Venus rubs an eyebrow, interrogatively.
‘In the cause of the right it would.
Because it would be unknowingly sold with the mounds else, and the buyer would get what he was never meant to have, and never bought.
And what would that be, Mr Venus, but the cause of the wrong?’  ‘Say it was papers,’ Mr Venus propounds.
‘According to what they contained we should offer to dispose of ‘em to the parties most interested,’ replies Mr Wegg, promptly.
‘In the cause of the right, Mr Wegg?’  ‘Always so, Mr Venus.
If the parties most interested should use the parties most interested in the cause of the wrong, that would be the parties most interested act and deed.
Mr Venus.
I have an opinion of you, sir, to which it is not easy to give mouth.
Since I called upon you that evening when you were, as I may say, floating your powerful mind in tea, I have felt that you required to be roused with an object.
In this friendly move, sir, you will have a glorious object to rouse you.’  Mr Wegg then goes on to enlarge upon what throughout has been uppermost in Mr Wegg crafty mind:--the qualifications of Mr Venus for such a search.
Mr Wegg expatiates on Mr Venus’s patient habits and delicate manipulation; on Mr Wegg skill in piecing little things together; on Mr Wegg knowledge of various tissues and textures; on the likelihood of small indications leading Mr Wegg on to the discovery of great concealments.
‘While as to myself,’ says Wegg, ‘I am not good at it.
Whether I gave myself up to prodding, or whether I gave myself up to scooping, I couldn’t do it with that delicate touch so as not to show that I was disturbing the Mounds.
Quite different with YOU, going to work (as YOU would) in the light of a fellow-man, holily pledged in a friendly move to his brother man.’ Mr Wegg next modestly remarks on the want of adaptation in a wooden leg to ladders and such like airy perches, and also hints at an inherent tendency in that timber fiction, when called into action for the purposes of a promenade on an ashey slope, to stick the purposes of a promenade on an ashey slope into the yielding foothold, and peg the purposes of a promenade on an ashey slope owner to one spot.
Then, leaving this part of the subject, Mr Wegg remarks on the special phenomenon that before Mr Wegg installation in the Bower, it was from Mr Venus that Mr Wegg first heard of the legend of hidden wealth in the Mounds: ‘which’, Mr Wegg observes with a vaguely pious air, ‘was surely never meant for nothing.’ Lastly, Mr Wegg returns to the cause of the right, gloomily foreshadowing the possibility of something being unearthed to criminate Mr Boffin (of whom Mr Wegg once more candidly admits it cannot be denied that Mr Wegg profits by a murder), and anticipating Mr Wegg denunciation by the friendly movers to avenging justice.
And this, Mr Wegg expressly points out, not at all for the sake of the reward--though it would be a want of principle not to take it.
To all this, Mr Venus, with Mr Wegg shock of dusty hair cocked after the manner of a terrier’s ears, attends profoundly.
When Mr Wegg, having finished, opens Mr Wegg arms wide, as if to show Mr Venus how bare Mr Wegg breast is, and then folds them pending a reply, Mr Venus winks at Mr Wegg with both eyes some little time before speaking.
‘I see you have tried it by yourself, Mr Wegg,’ Mr Wegg says when Mr Wegg does speak.
‘You have found out the difficulties by experience.’  ‘No, it can hardly be said that I have tried it,’ replies Wegg, a little dashed by the hint.
‘I have just skimmed it.
Skimmed it.’  ‘And found nothing besides the difficulties by experience?’  Mr Wegg shakes Mr Wegg head.
‘I scarcely know what to say to this, Mr Wegg,’ observes Mr Venus, after ruminating for a while.
‘Say yes,’ Wegg naturally urges.
‘If I wasn’t soured, my answer would be no.
But being soured, Mr Wegg, and driven to reckless madness and desperation, I suppose it’s Yes.’  Mr Wegg joyfully reproduces the two glasses, repeats the ceremony of clinking their rims, and inwardly drinks with great heartiness to the health and success in life of the young lady who has reduced Mr Venus to his present convenient state of mind.
The articles of the friendly move are then severally recited and agreed upon.
The articles of the friendly move are but secrecy, fidelity, and perseverance.
the Bower to be always free of access to Mr Venus for the Bower researches, and every precaution to be taken against their attracting observation in the neighbourhood.
‘There’s a footstep!’ exclaims Venus.
‘Where?’ cries Mr Wegg, starting.
‘Outside.
St!’  They are in the act of ratifying the treaty of friendly move, by shaking hands upon it.
They softly break off, light They pipes which have gone out, and lean back in They chairs.
No doubt, a footstep.
It approaches the window, and a hand taps at the glass.
‘Come in!’ calls Mr Wegg; meaning come round by the door.
But the heavy old-fashioned sash is slowly raised, and a head slowly looks in out of the dark background of night.
‘Pray is Mr Silas Wegg here?
Oh!
I see Mr Silas Wegg!’  The friendly movers might not have been quite at The friendly movers ease, even though the visitor had entered in the usual manner.
But, leaning on the breast-high window, and staring in out of the darkness, The friendly movers find the visitor extremely embarrassing.
Especially Mr Venus: who removes his pipe, draws back his head, and stares at the starer, as if his pipe were his own Hindoo baby come to fetch his home.
‘Good evening, Mr Wegg.
The yard gate-lock should be looked to, if you please; The yard gate-lock don’t catch.’  ‘Is The yard gate-lock Mr Rokesmith?’ falters Wegg.
‘It is Mr Rokesmith.
Don’t let me disturb you.
I am not coming in.
I have only a message for you, which I undertook to deliver on my way home to my lodgings.
I was in two minds about coming beyond the gate without ringing: not knowing but you might have a dog about.’  ‘I wish I had,’ mutters Wegg, with his back turned as his rose from his .
St!
Hush!
The talking-over stranger, Mr Venus.’  ‘Is that any one I know?’ inquires the staring Secretary.
‘No, Mr Rokesmith.
Friend of mine.
Passing the evening with me.’  ‘Oh!
I beg his pardon.
Mr Rokesmith wishes you to know that Mr Rokesmith does not expect you to stay at home any evening, on the chance of Mr Rokesmith coming.
It has occurred to Mr Rokesmith that Mr Rokesmith may, without intending he may, have been a tie upon Mr Rokesmith.
In future, if Mr Rokesmith should come without notice, Mr Rokesmith will take Mr Rokesmith chance of finding you, and it will be all the same to Mr Rokesmith if Mr Rokesmith does not.
I undertook to tell you on my way.
That’s all.’  With that, and ‘Good night,’ the staring Secretary lowers the window, and disappears.
They listen, and hear Mr Rokesmith footsteps go back to the gate, and hear the gate close after Mr Rokesmith.
‘And for that individual, Mr Venus,’ remarks Wegg, when Mr Rokesmith is fully gone, ‘I have been passed over!
Let me ask you what you think of Mr Rokesmith?’  Apparently, Mr Venus does not know what to think of Mr Rokesmith, for Mr Rokesmith makes sundry efforts to reply, without delivering Mr Rokesmith of any other articulate utterance than that Mr Rokesmith has ‘a singular look’.
‘A double look, you mean, sir,’ rejoins Wegg, playing bitterly upon the word.
‘A double look, you mean, sir,’ rejoins Wegg, playing bitterly upon the word.
Any amount of singular look for Mr Rokesmith, but not a double look!
That’s an under-handed mind, sir.’  ‘Do you say there’s something against Mr Rokesmith?’ Mr Venus asks.
‘Something against Mr Rokesmith?’ repeats Mr Wegg.
‘Something?
What would the relief be to my feelings--as a fellow-man--if I wasn’t the slave of truth, and didn’t feel Mr Rokesmith compelled to answer, Everything!’  See into what wonderful maudlin refuges, featherless ostriches plunge featherless ostriches heads!
It is such unspeakable moral compensation to Wegg, to be overcome by the consideration that Mr Rokesmith has an underhanded mind!
‘On this starlight night, Mr Venus,’ Mr Rokesmith remarks, when Mr Rokesmith is showing that friendly mover out across the yard, and both are something the worse for mixing again and again: ‘on this starlight night to think that talking-over strangers, and underhanded minds, can go walking home under the sky, as if talking-over strangers, and underhanded minds was all square!’  ‘The spectacle of those orbs,’ says Mr Venus, gazing upward with Mr Rokesmith hat tumbling off; ‘brings heavy on Mr Rokesmith Mr Venus crushing words that Mr Venus did not wish to regard Mr Venus nor yet to be regarded in that--’  ‘I know!
I know!
You needn’t repeat ‘em,’ says Wegg, pressing Wegg hand.
‘But think how those stars steady me in the cause of the right against some that shall be nameless.
It isn’t that I bear malice.
But see how those stars glisten with old remembrances!
Old remembrances of what, sir?’  Mr Venus begins drearily replying, ‘Of her words, in her own handwriting, that her does not wish to regard her, nor yet--’ when Silas cuts him short with dignity.
‘No, sir!
Remembrances of Our House, of Master George, of Aunt Jane, of Uncle Parker, all laid waste!
All offered up sacrifices to the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour!’
