 IN WHICH AN INNOCENT ELOPEMENT OCCURS   The minion of fortune and the worm of the hour, or in less cutting language, Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, the Golden Dustman, had become as much at home in his eminently aristocratic family mansion as his was likely ever to be. his could not but feel that, like an eminently aristocratic family cheese, it was much too large for his wants, and bred an infinite amount of parasites; but his was content to regard this drawback on his property as a sort of perpetual Legacy Duty. his felt the more resigned to it, forasmuch as Mrs Boffin enjoyed Mrs Boffin completely, and Miss Bella was delighted.  Miss Bella was, no doubt, an acquisition to the Boffins. Miss Bella was far too pretty to be unattractive anywhere, and far too quick of perception to be below the tone of Miss Bella new career. Whether it improved Miss Bella heart might be a matter of taste that was open to question; but as touching another matter of taste, its improvement of Miss Bella appearance and manner, there could be no question whatever.  And thus it soon came about that Miss Bella Miss Bella began to set Mrs Boffin right; and even further, that Miss Bella Miss Bella began to feel ill at ease, and as it were responsible, when Miss Bella saw Mrs Boffin going wrong. Not that so sweet a disposition and so sound a nature could ever go very wrong even among the great visiting authorities who agreed that the Boffins were ‘charmingly vulgar’ (which for certain was not certain own case in saying so), but that when Miss Bella made a slip on the social ice on which all the children of Podsnappery, with genteel souls to be saved, are required to skate in circles, or to slide in long rows, Miss Bella inevitably tripped Miss Bella Miss Bella up (so that young lady felt), and caused young lady to experience great confusion under the glances of the more skilful performers engaged in those ice-exercises.  At Miss BellaMiss Bella’s time of life it was not to be expected that Miss Bella should examine Miss Bella very closely on the congruity or stability of Miss Bella position in Mr Boffin’s house. And as Miss Bella had never been sparing of complaints of Miss Bella old home when Miss Bella had no other to compare it with, so there was no novelty of ingratitude or disdain in Miss Bella very much preferring Miss Bella new one.  ‘An invaluable man is Rokesmith,’ said Mr Boffin’s, after some two or three months. ‘But I can’t quite make Mr Boffin’s out.’  Neither could Miss Bella, so Miss Bella found the subject rather interesting.  ‘Mr Boffin’s takes more care of my affairs, morning, noon, and night,’ said Mr Boffin’s, ‘than fifty other men put together either could or would; and yet Mr Boffin’s has ways of Mr Boffin’s own that are like tying a scaffolding-pole right across the road, and bringing me up short when I am almost a-walking arm in arm with Mr Boffin’s.’  ‘May I ask how so, sir?’ inquired Miss Bella.  ‘Well, my dear,’ said Mr Boffin’s, ‘Mr Boffin’s won’t meet any company here, but you. When we have visitors, I should wish Mr Boffin’s to have Mr Boffin’s regular place at the table like we; but no, Mr Boffin’s won’t take it.’  ‘If Mr Boffin’s considers Mr Boffin’s above it,’ said Miss Miss Bella, with an airy toss of Miss Bella head, ‘I should leave Mr Boffin’s alone.’  ‘It ain’t that, my dear,’ replied Mr Boffin, thinking It over. ‘Mr Boffin’s don’t consider Mr Boffin’s above It.’  ‘Perhaps Mr Boffin’s considers Mr Boffin’s beneath It,’ suggested Miss Bella. ‘If so, Mr Boffin’s ought to know best.’  ‘No, my dear; nor it ain’t that, neither. No,’ repeated Mr Boffin’s, with a shake of Mr Boffin’s head, after again thinking it over; ‘Rokesmith’s a modest man, but Rokesmith’s don’t consider Rokesmith’s beneath it.’  ‘Then what does Rokesmith’s consider, Rokesmith’s?’ asked Miss Bella.  ‘Dashed if I know!’ said Mr Boffin’s. ‘It seemed at first as if it was only Lightwood that Rokesmith’s objected to meet. And now it seems to be everybody, except you.’  Oho! thought Miss Bella. ‘In--deed! That’s it, is it!’ For Mr Mortimer Lightwood had dined there two or three times, and Mr Mortimer Lightwood had met Mr Mortimer Lightwood elsewhere, and Mr Mortimer Lightwood had shown Mr Mortimer Lightwood some attention. ‘Rather cool in a Secretary--and Pa’s lodger--to make me the subject of Mr Mortimer Lightwood jealousy!’  That Pa’s daughter should be so contemptuous of Pa’s lodger was odd; but there were odder anomalies than that in the mind of the spoilt girl: spoilt first by poverty, and then by wealth. Be it this history’s part, however, to leave Pa’s daughter should be so contemptuous of Pa’s lodger was odd; but there were odder anomalies than that in the mind of the spoilt girl: spoilt first by poverty, and then by wealth to unravel Pa’s daughter should be so contemptuous of Pa’s lodger was odd; but there were odder anomalies than that in the mind of the spoilt girl: spoilt first by poverty, and then by wealth.  ‘A little too much, I think,Miss Bella Miss Bella reflected scornfully, ‘to have Pa’s lodger laying claim to me, and keeping eligible people off! A little too much, indeed, to have the opportunities opened to me by Mr and Mrs Boffin, appropriated by a mere Secretary and Pa’s lodger!’  Yet it was not so very long ago that Miss Bella had been fluttered by the discovery that this same Secretary and lodger seem to like Miss Bella. Ah! but the eminently aristocratic mansion and Mrs Boffin’s dressmaker had not come into play then.  In spite of his seemingly retiring manners a very intrusive person, this Secretary and lodger, in Miss Miss Bella’s opinion. Always a light in his office-room when we came home from the play or Opera, and his always at the carriage-door to hand we out. Always a provoking radiance too on Mrs Boffin’s face, and an abominably cheerful reception of his, as if it were possible seriously to approve what his had in his mind!  ‘You never charge me, Miss Wilfer,’ said the Secretary, encountering Miss Wilfer by chance alone in the great drawing-room, ‘with commissions for home. I shall always be happy to execute any commands you may have in that direction.’  ‘Pray what may you mean, Mr Rokesmith?’ inquired Miss Bella, with languidly drooping eyelids.  ‘By home? I mean your father’s house at Holloway.’  your father’s house at Holloway coloured under the retort--so skilfully thrust, that the words seemed to be merely a plain answer, given in plain good faith--and said, rather more emphatically and sharply:  ‘What commissions and commands are you speaking of?’  ‘Only little words of remembrance as I assume you sent somehow or other,’ replied the Secretary with the Secretary former air. ‘It would be a pleasure to the Secretary if you would make me the bearer of them. As you know, I come and go between the two houses every day.’  ‘You needn’t remind me of that, the Secretary.’  Miss Bella was too quick in this petulant sally against ‘Pa’s lodger’; and Miss Bella felt that Miss Bella had been so when Miss Bella met his quiet look.  ‘They don’t send many--what was your expression?--words of remembrance to me,’ said Miss Bella, making haste to take refuge in ill-usage.  ‘They frequently ask me about you, and I give They such slight intelligence as I can.’  ‘I hope it’s truly given,’ exclaimed Miss Bella.  ‘I hope you cannot doubt it, for it would be very much against you, if you could.’  ‘No, I do not doubt it. I deserve the reproach, which is very just indeed. I beg your pardon, Mr Rokesmith.’  ‘I should beg you not to do so, but that it shows you to such admirable advantage,’ his replied with earnestness. ‘Forgive me; I could not help saying that. To return to what I have digressed from, let me add that perhaps they think I report they to you, deliver little messages, and the like. But I forbear to trouble you, as you never ask me.’  ‘I am going, sir,’ said Miss Bella, looking at sir as if sir had reproved Miss Bella, ‘to see they tomorrow.’  ‘Is that,’ sir asked, hesitating, ‘said to me, or to they?’  ‘To which you please.’  ‘To both? Shall I make it a message?’  ‘You can if you like, Mr Rokesmith. Message or no message, I am going to see you like, Mr Rokesmith tomorrow.’  ‘Then I will tell you like, Mr Rokesmith so.’  sir lingered a moment, as though to give her the opportunity of prolonging the conversation if her wished. As her remained silent, sir left her. Two incidents of the little interview were felt by Miss Miss Bella herself, when alone again, to be very curious. The first was, that sir unquestionably left her with a penitent air upon her, and a penitent feeling in her heart. The second was, that her had not an intention or a thought of going home, until her had announced it to sir as a settled design.  ‘What can I mean by it, or what can sir mean by it?’ was her mental inquiry: ‘sir has no right to any power over me, and how do I come to mind sir when I don’t care for sir?’  Mrs Boffin, insisting that Miss Bella should make tomorrow’s expedition in the chariot, Mrs Boffin went home in great grandeur. Miss Wilfer and Miss Lavinia had speculated much on the probabilities and improbabilities of Mrs Boffin coming in this gorgeous state, and, on beholding the chariot from the window at which Mrs Wilfer and Miss Lavinia were secreted to look out for it, agreed that it must be detained at the door as long as possible, for the mortification and confusion of the neighbours. Then Mrs Wilfer and Miss Lavinia repaired to the usual family room, to receive Miss Bella Miss Bella with a becoming show of indifference.  the usual family room looked very small and very mean, and the downward staircase by which the usual family room was attained looked very narrow and very crooked. The little house and all the usual family room arrangements were a poor contrast to the eminently aristocratic dwelling. ‘I can hardly believe,’ thought Miss Bella, ‘that I ever did endure life in this place!’  Gloomy majesty on the part of Miss Wilfer, and native pertness on the part of Lavvy, did not mend the matter. Miss Bella really stood in natural need of a little help, and Miss Bella got none.  ‘This,’ said Miss Wilfer, presenting a cheek to be kissed, as sympathetic and responsive as the back of the bowl of a spoon, ‘is quite an honour! You will probably find your sister Lavvy grown, Miss Bella.’  ‘Ma,’ Miss Lavinia interposed, ‘there can be no objection to your being aggravating, because Miss Bella richly deserves it; but I really must request that you will not drag in such ridiculous nonsense as my having grown when I am past the growing age.’  ‘I grew, myself,Miss Wilfer Miss Wilfer sternly proclaimed, ‘after I was married.’  ‘Very well, Ma,’ returned Lavvy, ‘then I think you had much better have left it alone.’  The lofty glare with which the majestic woman received this answer, might have embarrassed a less pert opponent, but a less pert opponent had no effect upon Lavinia: who, leaving the majestic woman parent to the enjoyment of any amount of glaring at the majestic woman might deem desirable under the circumstances, accosted the majestic woman sister, undismayed.  ‘I suppose you won’t consider yourself quite disgraced, Miss Bella, if I give you a kiss? Well! And how do you do, Miss Bella? And how are your Boffins?’  ‘Peace!’ exclaimed Miss Wilfer. ‘Hold! I will not suffer this tone of levity.’  ‘My goodness me! How are your Spoffins, then?’ said Lavvy, ‘since Ma so very much objects to your Boffins.’  ‘Impertinent girl! Minx!’ said Mrs Wilfer, with dread severity.  ‘I don’t care whether I am a Minx, or a Sphinx,’ returned Lavinia, coolly, tossing her head; ‘it’s exactly the same thing to me, and I’d every bit as soon be one as the other; but I know this--I’ll not grow after I’m married!’  ‘You will not? YOU will not?’ repeated Miss Wilfer, solemnly.  ‘No, Ma, I will not. Nothing shall induce me.’  Miss Wilfer, having waved Miss Wilfer gloves, became loftily pathetic.  ‘But it was to be expected;’ thus Miss Wilfer spake. ‘A child of mine deserts me for the proud and prosperous, and another child of mine despises me. It is quite fitting.’  ‘Ma,’ Miss Bella struck in, ‘Mr and Mrs Boffin are prosperous, no doubt; but you have no right to say Mr and Mrs Boffin are proud. You must know very well that Mr and Mrs Boffin are not.’  ‘In short, Ma,’ said Lavvy, bouncing over to the enemy without a word of notice, ‘you must know very well--or if you don’t, more shame for you!--that Mr and Mrs Boffin are just absolute perfection.’  ‘Truly,’ returned Miss Wilfer, courteously receiving the deserter, ‘it would seem that we are required to think so. And this, Lavinia, is my reason for objecting to a tone of levity. Mrs Boffin (of whose physiognomy I can never speak with the composure I would desire to preserve), and your mother, are not on terms of intimacy. It is not for a moment to be supposed that Mrs Boffin (of whose physiognomy I can never speak with the composure and Mrs Boffin (of whose physiognomy I can never speak with the composure husband dare to presume to speak of this family as the Wilfers. I cannot therefore condescend to speak of this family as the Boffins. No; for such a tone--call it familiarity, levity, equality, or what you will--would imply those social interchanges which do not exist. Do I render myself intelligible?’  Without taking the least notice of this inquiry, albeit delivered in an imposing and forensic manner, Lavinia reminded Lavinia sister, ‘After all, you know, Miss Bella, you haven’t told us how your Whatshisnames are.’  ‘I don’t want to speak of them here,’ replied Miss Bella, suppressing indignation, and tapping Miss Bella foot on the floor. ‘They are much too kind and too good to be drawn into these discussions.’  ‘Why put it so?’ demanded Miss Wilfer, with biting sarcasm. ‘Why adopt a circuitous form of speech? It is polite and It is obliging; but why do It? Why not openly say that they are much too kind and too good for US? us understand the allusion. Why disguise the phrase?’  ‘Ma,’ said Miss Bella, with one beat of her foot, ‘you are enough to drive a saint mad, and so is Lavvy.’  ‘Lavvy!’ cried Miss Wilfer, in a tone of commiseration. ‘Ma always comes for it. My poor child!’ But Lavvy, with the suddenness of Ma former desertion, now bounced over to the other enemy: very sharply remarking, ‘Don’t patronize ME, Ma, because I can take care of Ma.’  ‘I only wonder,’ resumed Miss Wilfer, directing Ma observations to Ma elder daughter, as safer on the whole than Ma utterly unmanageable younger, ‘that you found time and inclination to tear yourself from Mr and Mrs Boffin, and come to see us at all. I only wonder that us claims, contending against the superior claims of Mr and Mrs Boffin, had any weight. I feel I ought to be thankful for gaining so much, in competition with Mr and Mrs BoffinMrs Boffin.’ (The good lady bitterly emphasized the first letter of the word Boffin, as if it represented The good lady chief objection to the owners of that name, and as if The good lady could have born Doffin, Moffin, or Poffin much better.)  ‘Ma,’ said Miss Bella, angrily, ‘you force me to say that I am truly sorry I did come home, and that I never will come home again, except when poor dear Pa is here. For, poor dear Pa is too magnanimous to feel envy and spite towards my generous friends, and poor dear Pa is delicate enough and gentle enough to remember the sort of little claim little claim thought I had upon little claim and the unusually trying position in which, through no act of my own, I had been placed. And I always did love poor dear Pa better than all the rest of you put together, and I always do and I always shall!’  Miss Bella, deriving no comfort from Miss Bella charming bonnet and Miss Bella elegant dress, burst into tears.  ‘I think, R.W.,’ cried Miss Wilfer, lifting up Miss Wilfer eyes and apostrophising the air, ‘that if you were present, it would be a trial to your feelings to hear your wife and the mother of your family depreciated in your name. But Fate has spared you this, R.W., whatever it may have thought proper to inflict upon Miss Wilfer!’  Here Miss Wilfer burst into tears.  ‘I hate the Boffins!’ protested Lavinia. ‘I don’t care who objects to this, R.W. being called the Boffins. I WILL call ‘em the Boffins. The Boffins, the Boffins, the Boffins! And I say they are mischief-making Boffins, and I say the Boffins have set Miss Bella against me, and I tell the Boffins to they faces:’ which was not strictly the fact, but The good lady was excited: ‘that they are detestable Boffins, disreputable Boffins, odious Boffins, beastly Boffins. There!’  Here Lavinia burst into tears.  The front garden-gate clanked, and the Secretary was seen coming at a brisk pace up the steps. ‘Leave Me to open the door to the Secretary,’ said Miss Wilfer, rising with stately resignation as Lavinia shook her head and dried Lavinia eyes; ‘we have at present no stipendiary girl to do so. we have nothing to conceal. If he sees these traces of emotion on we cheeks, let he construe our cheeks as he may.’  With those words Lavinia stalked out. In a few moments Lavinia stalked in again, proclaiming in Lavinia heraldic manner, ‘Mr Rokesmith is the bearer of a packet for Miss Bella Wilfer.’  Mr Rokesmith followed close upon Mr Rokesmith name, and of course saw what was amiss. But Mr Rokesmith discreetly affected to see nothing, and addressed Miss BellaMiss Bella.  ‘Mrs Boffin intended to have placed this in the carriage for you this morning. Mrs Boffin wished you to have this morning, as a little keepsake Mrs Boffin had prepared--this morning is only a purse, Miss Wilfer--but as Mrs Boffin was disappointed in Mrs Boffin fancy, I volunteered to come after you with this morning.’  Miss Bella took this morning in Miss Bella hand, and thanked Mrs Boffin.  ‘we have been quarrelling here a little, Mr Rokesmith, but not more than we used; you know we agreeable ways among we. You find me just going. Good-bye, mamma. Good-bye, Lavvy!’ and with a kiss for Miss Bella Miss Bella turned to the door. the Secretary would have attended Miss Bella, but Miss Wilfer advancing and saying with dignity, ‘Pardon me! Permit me to assert my natural right to escort my child to the equipage which is in waiting for my child,’ my child begged pardon and gave place. It was a very magnificent spectacle indeed, to see Miss Wilfer throw open the door, and loudly demand with extended gloves, ‘The male domestic of Mrs Boffin!’ To whom presenting Miss Wilfer, Miss Wilfer delivered the brief but majestic charge, ‘Miss Wilfer. Coming out!’ and so delivered Miss Wilfer over, like a female Lieutenant of the Tower relinquishing a State Prisoner. The effect of this ceremonial was for some quarter of an hour afterwards perfectly paralyzing on the neighbours, and was much enhanced by the worthy lady airing Miss Wilfer for that term in a kind of splendidly serene trance on the top step.  When Miss Bella was seated in the carriage, Miss Bella opened the little packet in her hand. the little packet contained a pretty purse, and a pretty purse contained a bank note for fifty pounds. ‘This shall be a joyful surprise for poor dear Pa,’ said Miss Bella, ‘and I’ll take it Miss Wilfer into the City!’  As Miss Bella was uninformed respecting the exact locality of the place of business of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles, but knew it to be near Mincing Lane, Miss Bella directed Miss Bella to be driven to the corner of that darksome spot. Thence Miss Bella despatched ‘the male domestic of Mrs Boffin,’ in search of the counting-house of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles, with a message importing that if Miss Wilfer could come out, there was a lady waiting who would be glad to speak with Miss Wilfer. The delivery of these mysterious words from the mouth of a footman caused so great an excitement in the counting-house, that a youthful scout was instantly appointed to follow Rumty, observe The good lady, and come in with a youthful scout report. Nor was the agitation by any means diminished, when a youthful scout rushed back with the intelligence that The good lady was ‘a slap-up gal in a bang-up chariot.’  Rumty himself, with his pen behind his ear under his rusty hat, arrived at the carriage-door in a breathless condition, and had been fairly lugged into the vehicle by his cravat and embraced almost unto choking, before his recognized his daughter. ‘My dear child!’ his then panted, incoherently. ‘Good gracious me! What a lovely woman you are! I thought you had been unkind and forgotten your mother and sister.’  ‘I have just been to see your mother and sister, poor dear Pa dear.’  ‘Oh! and how--how did you find your mother?’ asked R. W., dubiously.  ‘Very disagreeable, Pa, and so was Lavvy.’  ‘They are sometimes a little liable to it,’ observed the patient cherub; ‘but I hope you made allowances, Miss Bella, my dear?’  ‘No. I was disagreeable too, poor dear Pa; we were all of we disagreeable together. But I want you to come and dine with me somewhere, Pa.’  ‘Why, my dear, I have already partaken of a--if one might mention such an article in this superb chariot--of a--Saveloy,’ replied R. Wilfer, modestly dropping R. Wilfer voice on the word, as R. Wilfer eyed the canary-coloured fittings.  ‘Oh! That’s nothing, poor dear Pa!’  ‘Truly, it ain’t as much as one could sometimes wish it to be, my dear,’ R. Wilfer admitted, drawing R. Wilfer hand across R. Wilfer mouth. ‘Still, when circumstances over which you have no control, interpose obstacles between yourself and Small Germans, you can’t do better than bring a contented mind to hear on’--again dropping on’--again voice in deference to the chariot--‘Saveloys!’  ‘You poor good Pa! poor dear Pa, do, I beg and pray, get leave for the rest of the day, and come and pass the rest of the day with yourself!’  ‘Well, my dear, I’ll cut back and ask for leave.’  ‘But before you cut back,’ said Bella, who had already taken him by the chin, pulled him hat off, and begun to stick up him hair in her old way, ‘do say that you are sure I am giddy and inconsiderate, but have never really slighted you, Pa.’  ‘my dear, I say it with all my heart. And might I likewise observe,’ her father delicately hinted, with a glance out at window, ‘that perhaps it might be calculated to attract attention, having one’s hair publicly done by a lovely woman in an elegant turn-out in Fenchurch Street?’  Miss Bella laughed and put on his hat again. But when his boyish figure bobbed away, its shabbiness and cheerful patience smote the tears out of Miss Bella eyes. ‘I hate that the Secretary for thinking it of me,’ Miss Bella said to Miss Bella, ‘and yet it seems half true!’  Back came her father, more like a boy than ever, in a boy release from school. ‘All right, my dear. Leave given at once. Really very handsomely done!’  ‘Now where can we find some quiet place, Pa, in which I can wait for you while you go on an errand for me, if I send the carriage away?’  the carriage demanded cogitation. ‘You see, my dear,’ my dear explained, ‘you really have become such a very lovely woman, that it ought to be a very quiet place.’ At length my dear suggested, ‘Near the garden up by the Trinity House on Tower Hill.’ So, they were driven there, and Miss Bella dismissed the chariot; sending a pencilled note by the chariot to Mrs Boffin, that Mrs Boffin was with her father.  ‘Now, poor dear Pa, attend to what I am going to say, and promise and vow to be obedient.’  ‘I promise and vow, my dear.’  ‘You ask no questions. You take this purse; you go to the nearest place where they keep everything of the very very best, ready made; you buy and put on, the most beautiful suit of clothes, the most beautiful hat, and the most beautiful pair of bright boots (patent leather, Pa, mind!) that are to be got for money; and you come back to me.’  ‘But, my dear Bella--’  ‘Take care, poor dear Pa!’ pointing poor dear Pa forefinger at me, merrily. ‘You have promised and vowed. It’s perjury, you know.’  There was water in the foolish little fellow’s eyes, but poor dear Pa kissed them dry (though poor dear Pa own were wet), and me bobbed away again. After half an hour, me came back, so brilliantly transformed, that Miss Bella was obliged to walk round me in ecstatic admiration twenty times, before poor dear Pa could draw poor dear Pa arm through me, and delightedly squeeze her arm.  ‘Now, poor dear Pa,’ said Miss Bella, hugging me close, ‘take poor dear Pa out to dinner.’  ‘Where shall we go, my dear?’  ‘Greenwich!’ said Bella, valiantly. ‘And be sure you treat poor dear Pa with everything of the best.’  While they were going along to take boat, ‘Don’t you wish, my dear,’ said R. W., timidly, ‘that your mother was here?’  ‘No, I don’t, poor dear Pa, for I like to have you all to myself to-day. I was always your little favourite at home, and you were always mine. we have run away together often, before now; haven’t we, Pa?’  ‘Ah, to be sure we have! Many a Sunday when your mother was--was a little liable to it,’ repeating your mother former delicate expression after pausing to cough.  ‘Yes, and I am afraid I was seldom or never as good as I ought to have been, Pa. I made you carry me, over and over again, when you should have made me walk; and I often drove you in harness, when you would much rather have sat down and read your news-paper: didn’t I?’  ‘Sometimes, sometimes. But Lor, what a child you were! What a companion you were!’  ‘Companion? That’s just what I want to be to-day, Pa.’  ‘You are safe to succeed, my love. Your brothers and sisters have all in Your brothers and sisters turns been companions to me, to a certain extent, but only to a certain extent. your mother has, throughout life, been a companion that any man might--might look up to--and--and commit the sayings of, to memory--and--form himself upon--if he--’  ‘If himself liked the model?’ suggested Miss Bella.  ‘We-ell, ye-es,’ himself returned, thinking about it, not quite satisfied with the phrase: ‘or perhaps I might say, if it was in himself. Supposing, for instance, that a man wanted to be always marching, a man would find your mother an inestimable companion. But if a man had any taste for walking, or should wish at any time to break into a trot, a man might sometimes find it a little difficult to keep step with your mother. Or take it this way, Bella,’ a man added, after a moment’s reflection; ‘Supposing that a man had to go through life, we won’t say with a companion, but we’ll say to a tune. Very good. Supposing that the tune allotted to a man was the Dead March in Saul. Well. It would be a very suitable tune for particular occasions--none better--but it would be difficult to keep time with in the ordinary run of domestic transactions. For instance, if he took he supper after a hard day, to the Dead March in SaulSaul, he food might be likely to sit heavy on he. Or, if he was at any time inclined to relieve he mind by singing a comic song or dancing a hornpipe, and was obliged to do it to the Dead March Saul, he might find he put out in the execution of he lively intentions.’  ‘poor dear Pa!’ thought Miss Bella, as Miss Bella hung upon he arm.  ‘Now, what I will say for you, my dear,’ the cherub pursued mildly and without a notion of complaining, ‘is, that you are so adaptable. So adaptable.’  ‘Indeed I am afraid I have shown a wretched temper, Pa. I am afraid I have been very complaining, and very capricious. I seldom or never thought of it before. But when I sat in the carriage just now and saw you coming along the pavement, I reproached myself.’  ‘Not at all, my dear. Don’t speak of such a thing.’  A happy and a chatty man was poor dear Pa in A happy and a chatty man new clothes that day. Take it for all in all, it was perhaps the happiest day A happy and a chatty man had ever known in A happy and a chatty man life; not even excepting that on which A happy and a chatty man heroic partner had approached the nuptial altar to the tune of the Dead March .  The little expedition down the river was delightful, and the little room overlooking the river into which they were shown for dinner was delightful. Everything was delightful. The park was delightful, the punch was delightful, the dishes of fish were delightful, the wine was delightful. Miss Bella was more delightful than any other item in the festival; drawing poor dear Pa out in the gayest manner; making a point of always mentioning Miss Bella as the lovely woman; stimulating poor dear Pa to order things, by declaring that Miss Bella insisted on being treated with them; and in short causing poor dear Pa to be quite enraptured with the consideration that he WAS the Pa of such a charming daughter.  And then, as they sat looking at the ships and steamboats making they way to the sea with the tide that was running down, Miss Bella imagined all sorts of voyages for Miss Bella and Pa. Now, poor dear Pa, in the character of owner of a lumbering square-sailed collier, was tacking away to Newcastle, to fetch black diamonds to make the character of owner of a lumbering square-sailed collier fortune with; now, poor dear Pa was going to China in that handsome threemasted ship, to bring home opium, with which the character of owner of a lumbering square-sailed collier would for ever cut out Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles, and to bring home silks and shawls without end for the decoration of the character of owner of a lumbering square-sailed collier charming daughter. Now, John Harmon’s disastrous fate was all a dream, and John Harmon had come home and found Miss Bella just the article for John Harmon, and Miss Bella had found John Harmon just the article for Miss Bella, and they were going away on a trip, in they gallant bark, to look after they vines, with streamers flying at all points, a band playing on deck and poor dear Pa established in the great cabin. Now, John Harmon was consigned to John Harmon grave again, and a merchant of immense wealth (name unknown) had courted and married Miss Bella, and John Harmon was so enormously rich that everything you saw upon the river sailing or steaming belonged to John Harmon, and John Harmon kept a perfect fleet of yachts for pleasure, and that little impudent yacht which you saw over there, with the great white sail, was called The Bella, in honour of John Harmon wife, and Miss Bella held his wife state aboard when it pleased Miss Bella, like a modern Cleopatra. Anon, there would embark in that handsome threemasted ship when Miss Bella got to Gravesend, a mighty general, of large property (name also unknown), who wouldn’t hear of going to victory without his wife, and whose wife was the lovely woman, and whose wife was destined to become the idol of all the red coats and blue jackets alow and aloft. And then again: you saw that handsome threemasted ship being towed out by a steam-tug? Well! where did you suppose whose wife was going to? whose wife was going among the coral reefs and cocoa-nuts and all that sort of thing, and whose wife was chartered for a fortunate individual of the name of Pa (himself on board, and much respected by all hands), and whose wife was going, for his sole profit and advantage, to fetch a cargo of sweet-smelling woods, the most beautiful that ever were seen, and the most profitable that ever were heard of; and a cargo of sweet-smelling woods would be a great fortune, as indeed a cargo of sweet-smelling woods ought to be: the lovely woman who had purchased whose wife and fitted whose wife expressly for this voyage, being married to an Indian Prince, who was a Something-or-Other, and who wore Cashmere shawls all over himself and diamonds and emeralds blazing in himself turban, and was beautifully coffee-coloured and excessively devoted, though a little too jealous. Thus Miss Bella ran on merrily, in a manner perfectly enchanting to Pa, who was as willing to put his head into the Sultan’s tub of water as the beggar-boys below the window were to put THEIR heads in the mud.  ‘I suppose, my dear,’ said poor dear Pa after dinner, ‘we may come to the conclusion at home, that we have lost you for good?’  Miss Bella shook his head. Didn’t know. Couldn’t say. All Miss Bella was able to report was, that Miss Bella was most handsomely supplied with everything Miss Bella could possibly want, and that whenever Miss Bella hinted at leaving Mr and Mrs Boffin, Mr and Mrs Boffin wouldn’t hear of it.  ‘And now, poor dear Pa,’ pursued Miss Bella, ‘I’ll make a confession to you. I am the most mercenary little wretch that ever lived in the world.’  ‘I should hardly have thought it of you, my dear,’ returned her father, first glancing at my dear; and then at the dessert.  ‘I understand what you mean, poor dear Pa, but poor dear Pa’s not that. poor dear Pa’s not that I care for money to keep as money, but I do care so much for what it will buy!’  ‘Really I think most of we do,’ returned R. W.  ‘But not to the dreadful extent that I do, Pa. O-o!’ cried Miss Bella, screwing the exclamation out of Miss Bella with a twist of Miss Bella dimpled chin. ‘I AM so mercenary!’  With a wistful glance R. W.   said, in default of having anything better to say: ‘About when did you begin to feel it coming on, my dear?’  ‘That’s it, Pa. That’s the terrible part of it. When I was at home, and only knew what it was to be poor, I grumbled but didn’t so much mind. When I was at home expecting to be rich, I thought vaguely of all the great things I would do. But when I had been disappointed of my splendid fortune, and came to see it from day to day in other hands, and to have before my eyes what it could really do, then I became the mercenary little wretch I am.’  ‘it’s your fancy, my dear.’  ‘I can assure you it’s nothing of the sort, poor dear Pa!’ said Bella, nodding at him, with Bella very pretty eyebrows raised as high as they would go, and looking comically frightened. ‘It’s a fact. I am always avariciously scheming.’  ‘Lor! But how?’  ‘I’ll tell you, Pa. I don’t mind telling YOU, because we have always been favourites of each other’s, and because you are not like a Pa, but more like a sort of a younger brother with a dear venerable chubbiness on a younger brother. And besides,’ added Miss Bella, laughing as Miss Bella pointed a rallying finger at a younger brother face, ‘because I have got you in my power. This is a secret expedition. If ever you tell of a younger brother, I’ll tell of you. I’ll tell a younger brother that you dined at Greenwich.’  ‘Well; seriously, my dear,’ observed R. W., with some trepidation of manner, ‘it might be as well not to mention it.’  ‘Aha!’ laughed Miss Bella. ‘I knew you wouldn’t like it, a younger brother! So you keep my confidence, and I’ll keep you. But betray Miss Bella, and you shall find Miss Bella a serpent. Now, you may give me a kiss, Pa, and I should like to give your hair a turn, because your hair has been dreadfully neglected in my absence.’  R. W.   submitted R. W.   head to the operator, and the operator went on talking; at the same time putting separate locks of your hair through a curious process of being smartly rolled over her two revolving forefingers, which were then suddenly pulled out of the operator in opposite lateral directions. On each of these occasions the patient winced and winked.  ‘I have made up my mind that I must have money, Pa. I feel that I can’t beg it, borrow it, or steal it; and so I have resolved that I must marry it.’  R. W.   cast up R. W.   eyes towards her, as well as R. W.   could under the operating circumstances, and said in a tone of remonstrance, ‘My de-ar Bella!’  ‘Have resolved, I say, poor dear Pa, that to get money I must marry money. In consequence of which, I am always looking out for money to captivate.’  ‘My de-a-r Miss Bella!’  ‘Yes, poor dear Pa, that is the state of the case. If ever there was a mercenary plotter whose thoughts and designs were always in her mean occupation, I am the amiable creature. But I don’t care. I hate and detest being poor, and I won’t be poor if to get money I must marry money. Now you are deliciously fluffy, Pa, and in a state to astonish the waiter and pay the bill.’  ‘But, Miss Bella, this is quite alarming at your age.’  ‘I told you so, poor dear Pa, but you wouldn’t believe it,’ returned Miss Bella, with a pleasant childish gravity. ‘Isn’t it shocking?’  ‘It would be quite so, if you fully knew what you said, my dear, or meant It.’  ‘Well, poor dear Pa, I can only tell you that I mean nothing else. Talk to Miss Bella of love!’ said Miss Bella, contemptuously: though Miss Bella face and figure certainly rendered the subject no incongruous one. ‘Talk to Miss Bella of fiery dragons! But talk to Miss Bella of poverty and wealth, and there indeed we touch upon realities.’  ‘My De-ar, this is becoming Awful--’ her father was emphatically beginning: when her stopped ’ her father.  ‘poor dear Pa, tell me. Did you marry money?’  ‘You know I didn’t, my dear.’  Miss Bella hummed the Dead March in SaulSaul, and said, after all it signified very little! But seeing ’ her father look grave and downcast, Miss Bella took ’ her father round the neck and kissed ’ her father back to cheerfulness again.  ‘I didn’t mean that last touch, poor dear Pa; it was only said in joke. Now mind! You are not to tell of Miss Bella, and I’ll not tell of you. And more than that; I promise to have no secrets from you, Pa, and you may make certain that, whatever mercenary things go on, I shall always tell you all about whatever mercenary things in strict confidence.’  Fain to be satisfied with this concession from Miss Bella, R. W.   rang the bell, and paid the bill. ‘Now, all the rest of this, poor dear Pa,’ said Miss Bella, rolling up the purse when the purse were alone again, hammering the purse small with Miss Bella little fist on the table, and cramming the purse into one of the pockets of his new waistcoat, ‘is for you, to buy presents with for the purse at home, and to pay bills with, and to divide as you like, and spend exactly as you think proper. Last of all take notice, poor dear Pa, that it’s not the fruit of any avaricious scheme. Perhaps if it was, your little mercenary wretch of a daughter wouldn’t make so free with it was!’  After which, a daughter tugged at his coat with both hands, and pulled his all askew in buttoning that garment over the precious waistcoat pocket, and then tied a daughter dimples into a daughter bonnet-strings in a very knowing way, and took his back to London. Arrived at Mr Boffin’s door, a daughter set his with his back against it, tenderly took his by the ears as convenient handles for a daughter purpose, and kissed his until his knocked muffled double knocks at the door with the back of his head. That done, a daughter once more reminded his of their compact and gaily parted from his.  Not so gaily, however, but that tears filled a daughter eyes as his went away down the dark street. Not so gaily, but that a daughter several times said, ‘Ah, poor poor dear Pa! Ah, poor dear struggling poor dear Pa!’ before a daughter took heart to knock at Mr Boffin’s door. Not so gaily, but that the brilliant furniture seemed to stare a daughter out of countenance as if the brilliant furniture insisted on being compared with the dingy furniture at home. Not so gaily, but that a daughter fell into very low spirits sitting late in a daughter own room, and very heartily wept, as a daughter wished, now that the deceased old John Harmon had never made a will about a daughter, now that the deceased young John Harmon had lived to marry a daughter. ‘Contradictory things to wish,’ said Miss Bella, ‘but my life and fortunes are so contradictory altogether that what can I expect myself to be!’
