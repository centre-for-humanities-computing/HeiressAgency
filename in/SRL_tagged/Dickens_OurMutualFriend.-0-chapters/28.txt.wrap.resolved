 SOME AFFAIRS OF THE HEART   Little Miss Peecher, from THE HEART   Little Miss Peecher little official dwelling-house, with her little official dwelling-house little windows like the eyes in needles, and her little official dwelling-house little doors like the covers of school-books, was very observant indeed of the object of THE HEART   Little Miss Peecher quiet affections. Love, though said to be afflicted with blindness, is a vigilant watchman, and Miss Peecher kept a vigilant watchman on double duty over Mr Bradley Headstone. It was not that Miss Peecher was naturally given to playing the spy--it was not that Miss Peecher was at all secret, plotting, or mean--it was simply that Miss Peecher loved the irresponsive Bradley with all the primitive and homely stock of love that had never been examined or certificated out of Miss Peecher. If Miss Peecher faithful slate had had the latent qualities of sympathetic paper, and her faithful slate pencil those of invisible ink, many a little treatise calculated to astonish the pupils would have come bursting through the dry sums in school-time under the warming influence of Miss Peecher’s bosom. For, oftentimes when school was not, and Miss Peecher calm leisure and calm little house were Miss Peecher own, Miss Peecher would commit to her faithful slate an imaginary description of how, upon a balmy evening at dusk, two figures might have been observed in the market-garden ground round the corner, of whom one, being a manly form, bent over the other, being a womanly form of short stature and some compactness, and breathed in a low voice the words, ‘Emma Peecher, wilt thou be my own?’ after which the womanly form’s head reposed upon the manly form’s shoulder, and the nightingales tuned up. Though all unseen, and unsuspected by the pupils, Bradley Headstone even pervaded the school exercises. Was Geography in question? Bradley Headstone would come triumphantly flying out of Vesuvius and Aetna ahead of the lava, and would boil unharmed in the hot springs of Iceland, and would float majestically down the Ganges and the Nile. Did History chronicle a king of men? Behold a king of men in pepper-and-salt pantaloons, with a king of men watch-guard round a king of men neck. Were copies to be written? In capital B’s and H’s most of the girls under Miss Peecher’s tuition were half a year ahead of every other letter in the alphabet. And Mental Arithmetic, administered by Miss Peecher, often devoted itself to providing Bradley Headstone with a wardrobe of fabulous extent: fourscore and four neck-ties at two and ninepence-halfpenny, two gross of silver watches at four pounds fifteen and sixpence, seventy-four black hats at eighteen shillings; and many similar superfluities.  The vigilant watchman, using The vigilant watchman daily opportunities of turning The vigilant watchman eyes in Bradley’s direction, soon apprized Miss Peecher that Bradley was more preoccupied than had been Bradley wont, and more given to strolling about with a downcast and reserved face, turning something difficult in Bradley mind that was not in the scholastic syllabus. Putting this and that together--combining under the head ‘this,’ present appearances and the intimacy with Charley Hexam, and ranging under the head ‘that’ the visit to Bradley sister, The vigilant watchman reported to Miss Peecher The vigilant watchman strong suspicions that his sister was at the bottom of his sister.  ‘I wonder,’ said Miss Peecher, as his sister sat making up his sister weekly report on a half-holiday afternoon, ‘what they call Hexam’s sister?’  Mary Anne, at Mary Anne needlework, attendant and attentive, held Mary Anne arm up.  ‘Well, Mary Anne?’  ‘Mary Anne is named Lizzie, ma’am.’  ‘Mary Anne can hardly be named Lizzie, I think, Mary Anne,’ returned Miss PeecherMiss Peecher, in a tunefully instructive voice. ‘Is Mary Anne a Christian name, Mary Anne?’  Mary Anne laid down Mary Anne work, rose, hooked Mary Anne behind, as being under catechization, and replied: ‘No, it is a corruption, Miss Peecher.’  ‘Who gave Mary Anne that name?’ Miss Peecher Miss Peecher was going on, from the mere force of habit, when Miss Peecher checked Miss Peecher; on Mary Anne’s evincing theological impatience to strike in with Miss Peecher godfathers and Miss Peecher godmothers, and said: ‘I mean of what name is what name a corruption?’  ‘Elizabeth, or Eliza, Miss Peecher.’  ‘Right, Mary Anne. Whether there were any Lizzies in the early Christian Church must be considered very doubtful, very doubtful.’ Miss Peecher was exceedingly sage here. ‘Speaking correctly, we say, then, that Hexam’s sister is called Lizzie; not that Hexam’s sister is named so. Do we not, Mary Anne?’  ‘we do, Miss Peecher.’  ‘And where,’ pursued Miss Peecher, complacent in Mary Anne little transparent fiction of conducting the examination in a semiofficial manner for Mary Anne benefit, not Mary Anne own, ‘where does this young woman, who is called but not named Lizzie, live? Think, now, before answering.’  ‘In Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank, ma’am.’  ‘In Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank,’ repeated Miss Peecher, as if possessed beforehand of the book in which it was written. Exactly so. And what occupation does Mary Anne pursue, Mary Anne? Take time.’  ‘Mary Anne has a place of trust at an outfitter’s in the City, ma’am.’  ‘Oh!’ said Miss Peecher, pondering on it; but smoothly added, in a confirmatory tone, ‘At an outfitter’s in the Citythe City. Ye-es?’  ‘And Charley--’ Mary Anne was proceeding, when Miss Peecher Miss Peecher stared.  ‘I mean Hexam, Miss Peecher.’  ‘I should think you did, Mary Anne. I am glad to hear you do. And Hexam--’  ‘Says,Mary Anne Mary Anne went on, ‘that Mary Anne is not pleased with Mary Anne sister, and that his sister won’t be guided by Mary Anne advice, and persists in being guided by somebody elsean outfitter’s in the City; and that--’  ‘Mr Headstone coming across the garden!’ exclaimed Miss PeecherMiss Peecher, with a flushed glance at the looking-glass. ‘You have answered very well, Mary Anne. You are forming an excellent habit of arranging your thoughts clearly. That will do.’  The discreet Mary Anne resumed Mary Anne seat and Mary Anne silence, and stitched, and stitched, and was stitching when the schoolmasteran outfitter’s in the City shadow came in before the schoolmaster’s, announcing that the schoolmaster’s might be instantly expected.  ‘Good evening, Miss Peecher,’ the schoolmaster’s said, pursuing the shadow, and taking the shadow place.  ‘Good evening, Mr Headstone. Mary Anne, a chair.’  ‘Thank you,’ said Bradley, seating Bradley in Bradley constrained manner. ‘This is but a flying visit. I have looked in, on my way, to ask a kindness of you as a neighbour.’  ‘Did you say on your way, Mr Headstone?’ asked Miss Peecher.  ‘On my way to--where I am going.’  ‘Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank,’ repeated Miss Peecher, in Mary Anne own thoughts.  ‘Charley Hexam has gone to get a book or two Charley Hexam wants, and will probably be back before me. As we leave my house empty, I took the liberty of telling Charley Hexam I would leave the key here. Would you kindly allow me to do so?’  ‘Certainly, Mr Headstone. Going for an evening walk, sir?’  ‘Partly for a walk, and partly for--on business.’  ‘Business in Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank,’ repeated Miss Peecher Miss Peecher to Miss Peecher.  ‘Having said which,’ pursued Bradley, laying his door-key on the table, ‘I must be already going. There is nothing I can do for you, Miss Miss Peecher?’  ‘Thank you, Mr Headstone. In which direction?’  ‘In the direction of Westminster.’  ‘Mill Bank,’ Miss Miss Peecher repeated in her own thoughts once again. ‘No, thank you, Mr Headstone; I’ll not trouble you.’  ‘You couldn’t trouble me,’ said the schoolmaster.  ‘Ah!’ returned Miss PeecherMiss Peecher, though not aloud; ‘but you can trouble ME!’ And for all her quiet manner, and her quiet smile, her was full of trouble as he went he way.  her was right touching he destination. he held as straight a course for the house of the dolls’ dressmaker as the wisdom of he ancestors, exemplified in the construction of the intervening streets, would let he, and walked with a bent head hammering at one fixed idea. It had been an immoveable idea since he first set eyes upon her. It seemed to he as if all that he could suppress in he he had suppressed, as if all that he could restrain in he he had restrained, and the time had come--in a rush, in a moment--when the power of self-command had departed from he. Love at first sight is a trite expression quite sufficiently discussed; enough that in certain smouldering natures like this man’s, that passion leaps into a blaze, and makes such head as fire does in a rage of wind, when other passions, but for its mastery, could be held in chains. As a multitude of weak, imitative natures are always lying by, ready to go mad upon the next wrong idea that may be broached--in these times, generally some form of tribute to Somebody for something that never was done, or, if ever done, that was done by Somebody Else--so these less ordinary natures may lie by for years, ready on the touch of an instant to burst into flame.  the schoolmaster went the schoolmaster way, brooding and brooding, and a sense of being vanquished in a struggle might have been pieced out of the schoolmaster worried face. Truly, in the schoolmaster breast there lingered a resentful shame to find the schoolmaster defeated by this passion for Charley Hexam’s sister, though in the very self-same moments the schoolmaster was concentrating the schoolmaster upon the object of bringing the passion to a successful issue.  the schoolmaster appeared before the dolls’ dressmaker, sitting alone at ’ dressmaker work. ‘Oho!’ thought that sharp young personage, ‘it’s you, is it? I know your tricks and your manners, my friend!’  ‘Hexam’s sister,’ said Bradley Headstone, ‘is not come home yet?’  ‘You are quite a conjuror,’ returned Miss Wren.  ‘I will wait, if you please, for I want to speak to ‘Hexam’s sister.’  ‘Do you?’ returned Miss WrenMiss Wren. ‘Sit down. I hope it’s mutual.’ Bradley glanced distrustfully at his worried face again bending over her work, and said, trying to conquer doubt and hesitation:  ‘I hope you don’t imply that my visit will be unacceptable to Hexam’s sister?’  ‘There! Don’t call Hexam’s sister that. I can’t bear you to call Hexam’s sister that,’ returned Miss Wren, snapping Hexam’s sister fingers in a volley of impatient snaps, ‘for I don’t like Hexam.’  ‘Indeed?’  ‘No.Miss Wren Wren wrinkled Hexam’s sister nose, to express dislike. ‘Selfish. Thinks only of Selfish. The way with all of you.’  ‘The way with all of us? Then you don’t like ME?’  ‘So-so,’ replied Miss WrenMiss Wren, with a shrug and a laugh. ‘Don’t know much about you.’  ‘But I was not aware it was the way with all of us,’ said Bradley, returning to the accusation, a little injured. ‘Won’t you say, some of us?’  ‘Meaning,’ returned the little creature, ‘every one of you, but you. Hah! Now look this lady in the face. This is Mrs Truth. The Honourable. Full-dressed.’  Bradley glanced at the doll this lady held up for Bradley observation--which had been lying on the face on this lady bench, while with a needle and thread this lady fastened the dress on at the back--and looked from it to this lady.  ‘I stand the Honourable Mrs T. on my bench in this corner against the wall, where this lady blue eyes can shine upon you,’ pursued Miss Wren, doing so, and making two little dabs at the Honourable Mrs T. in the air with this lady needle, as if this lady pricked the Honourable Mrs T. with her needle in the Honourable Mrs T. own eyes; ‘and I defy you to tell me, with the Honourable Mrs T. for a witness, what you have come here for.’  ‘To see Hexam’s sister.’  ‘You don’t say so!’ retorted Miss Wren, hitching Miss Wren chin. ‘But on whose account?’  ‘Miss Wren own.’  ‘O the Honourable Mrs T.!’ exclaimed Miss Wren. ‘You hear the Honourable Mrs T.!’  ‘To reason with Miss Wren,’ pursued Bradley, half humouring what was present, and half angry with what was not present; ‘for Miss Wren own sake.’  ‘Oh Mrs T.!’ exclaimed the dressmaker.  ‘For the dressmaker ,’ repeated Bradley, warming, ‘and for the dressmaker brother’s, and as a perfectly disinterested person.’  ‘Really, the Honourable Mrs T.,’ remarked the dressmaker, ‘since it comes to this, we must positively turn you with your face to the wall.’ the dressmaker had hardly done so, when Hexam arrived, and showed some surprise on seeing Bradley Headstone there, and Jenny shaking the dressmaker little fist at Bradley Headstone close before the dressmaker , and the Honourable Mrs T. with the dressmaker face to the wall.  ‘Here’s a perfectly disinterested person, Hexam dear,’ said the knowing Miss Wren, ‘come to talk with the knowing Miss Wren, for your own sake and your brother’s. Think of that. I am sure there ought to be no third party present at anything so very kind and so very serious; and so, if you’ll remove the third party upstairs, my dear, the third party will retire.’  Hexam took the hand which the dolls’ dressmaker held out to Hexam for the purpose of being supported away, but only looked at Hexam with an inquiring smile, and made no other movement.  ‘The third party hobbles awfully, you know, when Hexam’s left to Hexam;’ said Miss Wren, ‘Hexam back being so bad, and Hexam legs so queer; so Hexam can’t retire gracefully unless you help Hexam, Hexam.’  ‘Hexam can do no better than stay where Hexam is,’ returned Hexam, releasing the hand which the dolls’ dressmaker held out to her for the purpose of being supported away, and laying Hexam own lightly on Miss Jenny’s curls. And then to Bradley: ‘From Charley Hexam’s, sir?’  In an irresolute way, and stealing a clumsy look at Hexam, Bradley rose to place a chair for Hexam, and then returned to Bradley own.  ‘Strictly speaking,’ said Bradley, ‘I come from Charley Hexam’s, because I left Bradley only a little while ago; but I am not commissioned by Charley Hexam’s. I come of my own spontaneous act.’  With Hexam elbows on Hexam bench, and Hexam chin upon Hexam hands, Miss Wren sat looking at Miss Wren with a watchful sidelong look. Hexam, in Hexam different way, sat looking at Miss Wren too.  ‘The fact is,’ began Bradley, with a mouth so dry that Miss Wren had some difficulty in articulating Miss Wren words: the consciousness of which rendered Miss Wren manner still more ungainly and undecided; ‘the truth is, that Charley Hexam’s, having no secrets from me (to the best of my belief), has confided the whole of this matter to me.’  Miss Wren came to a stop, and Hexam asked: ‘what matter, sir?’  ‘I thought,’ returned the schoolmaster, stealing another look at the schoolmaster, and seeming to try in vain to sustain it; for another look at her dropped as it lighted on his own eyes, ‘that it might be so superfluous as to be almost impertinent, to enter upon a definition of it. My allusion was to this matter of your having put aside your brother’s plans for you, and given the preference to those of Mr--I believe the name is Mr Eugene Wrayburn.’  Mr Eugene Wrayburn made this point of not being certain of the name, with another uneasy look at the schoolmaster, which dropped like the last.  Nothing being said on the other side, Mr Eugene Wrayburn had to begin again, and began with new embarrassment.  ‘Your brother’s plans were communicated to me when Your brother’s first had Your brother’s plans in Your brother’s thoughts. In point of fact Your brother’s spoke to me about Your brother’s plans when I was last here--when Your brother’s plans were walking back together, and when I--when the impression was fresh upon me of having seen Your brother’s sister.’  There might have been no meaning in it, but the little dressmaker here removed one of the little dressmaker here supporting hands from the little dressmaker here , and musingly turned the Honourable Mrs T. with the little dressmaker here face to the company. That done, the little dressmaker here fell into the little dressmaker here former attitude.  ‘I approved of Your brother’s idea,’ said Bradley, with Your brother’s uneasy look wandering to the doll, and unconsciously resting there longer than the doll had rested on Hexam, ‘both because Your brother’s ought naturally to be the originator of any such scheme, and because I hoped to be able to promote it. I should have had inexpressible pleasure, I should have taken inexpressible interest, in promoting it. Therefore I must acknowledge that when Your brother’s was disappointed, I too was disappointed. I wish to avoid reservation or concealment, and I fully acknowledge that.’  Your brother’s appeared to have encouraged Your brother’s by having got so far. At all events Your brother’s went on with much greater firmness and force of emphasis: though with a curious disposition to set Your brother’s teeth, and with a curious tight-screwing movement of Your brother’s right hand in the clenching palm of Your brother’s left, like the action of one who was being physically hurt, and was unwilling to cry out.  ‘I am a man of strong feelings, and I have strongly felt this disappointment. I do strongly feel it. I don’t show what I feel; some of us are obliged habitually to keep it down. To keep it down. But to return to Your brother’s. Your brother’s has taken the matter so much to heart that Your brother’s has remonstrated (in my presence Your brother’s remonstrated) with Mr Eugene Wrayburn, if that be the name. Your brother’s did so, quite ineffectually. As any one not blinded to the real character of Mr--Mr Eugene Wrayburn--would readily suppose.’  Your brother’s looked at Hexam again, and held the look. And Your brother’s face turned from burning red to white, and from white back to burning red, and so for the time to lasting deadly white.  ‘Finally, I resolved to come here alone, and appeal to you. I resolved to come here alone, and entreat you to retract the course you have chosen, and instead of confiding in a mere stranger--a person of most insolent behaviour to your brother and others--to prefer your brother and your brother’s friend.’  Hexam had changed colour when those changes came over Hexam, and his face now expressed some anger, more dislike, and even a touch of fear. But Hexam answered Hexam very steadily.  ‘I cannot doubt, Mr Headstone, that your visit is well meant. You have been so good a friend to Charley Hexam’s that I have no right to doubt it. I have nothing to tell Charley Hexam’s, but that I accepted the help to which he so much objects before he made any plans for me; or certainly before I knew of any. It was considerately and delicately offered, and there were reasons that had weight with me which should be as dear to Charley Hexam’s as to me. I have no more to say to Charley Hexam’s on this subject.’  he lips trembled and stood apart, as he followed this repudiation of he; and limitation of Hexam words to Hexam brother.  ‘I should have told Charley Hexam’s, if he had come to me,’ Hexam resumed, as though it were an after-thought, ‘that Jenny and I find our teacher very able and very patient, and that our teacher takes great pains with our. So much so, that our have said to our teacher our hope in a very little while to be able to go on by our. Charley Hexam’s knows about teachers, and I should also have told Charley Hexam’s, for Charley Hexam’s satisfaction, that our comes from an institution where teachers are regularly brought up.’  ‘I should like to ask you,’ said Bradley Headstone, grinding Bradley Headstone words slowly out, as though they came from a rusty mill; ‘I should like to ask you, if I may without offence, whether you would have objected--no; rather, I should like to say, if I may without offence, that I wish I had had the opportunity of coming here with Your brother’s and devoting my poor abilities and experience to your service.’  ‘Thank you, Bradley Headstone.’  ‘But I fear,’ Bradley Headstone pursued, after a pause, furtively wrenching at the seat of Bradley Headstone chair with one hand, as if Bradley Headstone would have wrenched the chair to pieces, and gloomily observing her while her were cast down, ‘that my humble services would not have found much favour with you?’  her made no reply, and the poor stricken wretch sat contending with the poor stricken wretch in a heat of passion and torment. After a while the poor stricken wretch took out the poor stricken wretch handkerchief and wiped the poor stricken wretch forehead and hands.  ‘There is only one thing more I had to say, but it is the most important. There is a reason against this matter, there is a personal relation concerned in this matter, not yet explained to you. It might--I don’t say it would--It might--induce you to think differently. To proceed under the present circumstances is out of the question. Will you please come to the understanding that there shall be another interview on this subject?’  ‘With Charley Hexam’s, Bradley Headstone?’  ‘With--well,’ Bradley Headstone answered, breaking off, ‘yes! Say with Bradley Headstone too. Will you please come to the understanding that there must be another interview under more favourable circumstances, before the whole case can be submitted?’  ‘I don’t,’ said Hexam, shaking Hexam head, ‘understand your meaning, Bradley Headstone.’  ‘Limit my meaning for the present,’ the poor stricken wretch interrupted, ‘to the whole case being submitted to you in another interview.’  ‘What case, Bradley Headstone? What is wanting to it?’  ‘You--you shall be informed in another interview.’ Then Bradley Headstone said, as if in a burst of irrepressible despair, ‘I--I leave it all incomplete! There is a spell upon Bradley Headstone, I think!’ And then added, almost as if Bradley Headstone asked for pity, ‘Good-night!’  Bradley Headstone held out Bradley Headstone hand. As she, with manifest hesitation, not to say reluctance, touched it, a strange tremble passed over Bradley Headstone, and Bradley Headstone face, so deadly white, was moved as by a stroke of pain. Then Bradley Headstone was gone.  The dolls’ dressmaker sat with she attitude unchanged, eyeing the door by which ’ dressmaker had departed, until Hexam pushed Hexam bench aside and sat down near Hexam. Then, eyeing Hexam as Hexam had previously eyed Bradley and the door, Miss Wren chopped that very sudden and keen chop in which Miss Wren jaws sometimes indulged, leaned back in his chair with folded arms, and thus expressed Miss Wren:  ‘Humph! If he--I mean, of course, my dear, the party who is coming to court me when the time comes--should be THAT sort of man, he may spare he the trouble. he wouldn’t do to be trotted about and made useful. he’d take fire and blow up while he was about it.’  ‘And so you would be rid of he,’ said Hexam, humouring Hexam.  ‘Not so easily,’ returned Miss WrenWren. ‘he wouldn’t blow up alone. he’d carry me up with he. I know he tricks and he manners.’  ‘Would he want to hurt you, do you mean?’ asked Hexam.  ‘Mightn’t exactly want to do it, my dear,’ returned Miss WrenMiss Wren; ‘but a lot of gunpowder among lighted lucifer-matches in the next room might almost as well be here.’  ‘he is a very strange man,’ said Hexam, thoughtfully.  ‘I wish he was so very strange a man as to be a total stranger,’ answered the sharp little thing.  It being Hexam’s regular occupation when regular occupation were alone of an evening to brush out and smooth the long fair hair of the dolls’ dressmaker, Hexam unfastened a ribbon that kept it back while the little creature was at Hexam work, and it fell in a beautiful shower over the poor shoulders that were much in need of such adorning rain. ‘Not now, Hexam, dear,’ said Jenny; ‘let us have a talk by the fire.’ With those words, Hexam in Hexam turn loosened Hexam friend’s dark hair, and her friend’s dark hair dropped of her friend’s dark hair own weight over Hexam bosom, in two rich masses. Pretending to compare the colours and admire the contrast, Jenny so managed a mere touch or two of Jenny nimble hands, as that Jenny herself laying a cheek on one of the dark folds, seemed blinded by Jenny own clustering curls to all but the fire, while the fine handsome face and brow of Hexam were revealed without obstruction in the sombre light.  ‘Let us have a talk,’ said Jenny, ‘about Mr Eugene Wrayburn.’  Something sparkled down among the fair hair resting on the dark hair; and if it were not a star--which it couldn’t be--it was an eye; and if it were an eye, it was Jenny Wren’s eye, bright and watchful as the bird’s whose name Jenny Wren had taken.  ‘Why about Mr Wrayburn?’ Hexam asked.  ‘For no better reason than because I’m in the humour. I wonder whether Mr Wrayburn’s rich!’  ‘No, not rich.’  ‘Poor?’  ‘I think so, for a gentleman.’  ‘Ah! To be sure! Yes, Mr Wrayburn’s a gentleman. Not of our sort; is Mr Wrayburn?’ A shake of the head, a thoughtful shake of the head, and the answer, softly spoken, ‘Oh no, oh no!’  The dolls’ dressmaker had an arm round her friend’s waist. Adjusting an arm, her slyly took the opportunity of blowing at her own hair where an arm fell over her face; then the eye down there, under lighter shadows sparkled more brightly and appeared more watchful.  ‘When Mr Wrayburn turns up, Mr Wrayburn shan’t be a gentleman; I’ll very soon send Mr Wrayburn packing, if Mr Wrayburn is. However, Mr Wrayburn’s not Mr Wrayburn; I haven’t captivated Mr Wrayburn. I wonder whether anybody has, Hexam!’  ‘It is very likely.’  ‘Is it very likely? I wonder who!’  ‘Is it not very likely that some lady has been taken by Mr Wrayburn, and that Mr Wrayburn may love some lady dearly?’  ‘Perhaps. I don’t know. What would you think of Mr Wrayburn, Hexam, if you were a lady?’  ‘I a lady!’ a lady repeated, laughing. ‘Such a fancy!’  ‘Yes. But say: just as a fancy, and for instance.’  ‘I a lady! I, a poor girl who used to row poor father on the river. I, who had rowed poor father out and home on the very night when I saw Mr Wrayburn for the first time. I, who was made so timid by Mr Wrayburn looking at me, that I got up and went out!’  [‘Mr Wrayburn did look at Hexam, even that night, though you were a lady!’ thought Miss Wren.)  ‘I a lady!’ Hexam went on in a low voice, with Hexam eyes upon the fire. ‘I, with poor father’s grave not even cleared of undeserved stain and shame, and Mr Wrayburn trying to clear it for Mr Wrayburn! I a lady!’  ‘Only as a fancy, and for instance,’ urged Miss Wren.  ‘Too much, Jenny, dear, too much! My fancy is not able to get that far.’ As the low fire gleamed upon Jenny, it showed Jenny smiling, mournfully and abstractedly.  ‘But I am in the humour, and I must be humoured, Hexam, because after all I am a poor little thing, and have had a hard day with my bad child. Look in the fire, as I like to hear you tell how you used to do when you lived in that dreary old house that had once been a windmill. Look in the--what was its name when you told fortunes with Your brother’s that I DON’T like?’  ‘The hollow down by the flare?’  ‘Ah! That’s the name! You can find a lady there, I know.’  ‘More easily than I can make one of such material as myself, Jenny.’  The sparkling eye looked steadfastly up, as the musing face looked thoughtfully down. ‘Well?’ said ’ dressmaker, ‘We have found We ?’  Hexam nodded, and asked, ‘Shall a lady be rich?’  ‘Hexam had better be, as he’s poor.’  ‘Hexam is very rich. Shall Hexam be handsome?’  ‘Even you can be that, Hexam, so Hexam ought to be.’  ‘Hexam is very handsome.’  ‘What does Hexam say about him?’ asked Jenny, in a low voice: watchful, through an intervening silence, of the musing face looking down at the fire.  ‘Hexam is glad, glad, to be rich, that him may have the money. Hexam is glad, glad, to be beautiful, that him may be proud of Hexam. Hexam poor heart--’  ‘Eh? Hexam poor heart?’ said Miss Wren.  ‘Hexam heart--is given him, with all Her heart love and truth. Hexam would joyfully die with him, or, better than that, die for him. Hexam knows him has failings, but Hexam thinks they have grown up through him being like one cast away, for the want of something to trust in, and care for, and think well of. And Hexam says, that lady rich and beautiful that I can never come near, “Only put me in that empty place, only try how little I mind Hexam, only prove what a world of things I will do and bear for you, and I hope that you might even come to be much better than you are, through Hexam who am so much worse, and hardly worth the thinking of beside you.”’  As the face looking at the fire had become exalted and forgetful in the rapture of these words, the little creature, openly clearing away Hexam fair hair with Hexam disengaged hand, had gazed at it with earnest attention and something like alarm. Now that the speaker ceased, the little creature laid down her head again, and moaned, ‘O me, O me, O me!’  ‘In pain, Jenny?’ asked Hexam, as if awakened.  ‘Yes, but not the old pain. Lay me down, lay me down. Don’t go out of my sight to-night. Lock the door and keep close to Hexam.’ Then turning away her face, Jenny said in a whisper to Jenny, ‘My Lizzie, my poor Hexam! O my blessed children, come back in the long bright slanting rows, and come for Jenny, not me. Jenny wants help more than I, my blessed children!’  Jenny had stretched Jenny hands up with that higher and better look, and now Jenny turned again, and folded them round Hexam’s neck, and rocked Jenny on Hexam’s breast.
