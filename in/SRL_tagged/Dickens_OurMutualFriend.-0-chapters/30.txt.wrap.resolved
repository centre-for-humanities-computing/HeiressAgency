 A SOLO AND A DUETT   The wind was blowing so hard when the visitor came out at the shop-door into the darkness and dirt of Limehouse Hole, that The wind almost blew him in again. Doors were slamming violently, lamps were flickering or blown out, signs were rocking in Doors frames, the water of the kennels, wind-dispersed, flew about in drops like rain. Indifferent to the weather, and even preferring it to better weather for it clearance of the streets, the man looked about the man with a scrutinizing glance. ‘Thus much I know,’ the man murmured. ‘I have never been here since that night, and never was here before that night, but thus much I recognize. I wonder which way did we take when we came out of that shop. we turned to the right as I have turned, but I can recall no more. Did we go by this alley? Or down that little lane?’  the man tried both, but both confused the man equally, and the man came straying back to the same spot. ‘I remember there were poles pushed out of upper windows on which clothes were drying, and I remember a low public-house, and the sound flowing down a narrow passage belonging to a low public-house of the scraping of a fiddle and the shuffling of feet. But here are all these things in the lane, and here are all these things in this alley. And I have nothing else in my mind but a wall, a dark doorway, a flight of stairs, and a room.’  the man tried a new direction, but made nothing of a new direction; walls, dark doorways, flights of stairs and rooms, were too abundant. And, like most people so puzzled, the man again and again described a circle, and found the man at the point from which the man had begun. ‘This is like what I have read in narratives of escape from prison,’ said he, ‘where the little track of the fugitives in the night always seems to take the shape of the great round world, on which they wander; as if it were a secret law.’  Here the man ceased to be the oakum-headed, oakum-whiskered man on whom Miss Pleasant Riderhood had looked, and, allowing for the man being still wrapped in a nautical overcoat, became as like that same lost wanted Mr Julius Handford, as never man was like another in this world. In the breast of the coat the man stowed the bristling hair and whisker, in a moment, as the favouring wind went with the man down a solitary place that the coat had swept clear of passengers. Yet in that same moment the man was the Secretary also, Mr Boffin’s Secretary. For John Rokesmith, too, was as like that same lost wanted Mr Julius Handford as never man was like another in this world.  ‘I have no clue to the scene of my death,’ said Mr Julius Handford. ‘Not that it matters now. But having risked discovery by venturing here at all, I should have been glad to track some part of the way.’ With which singular words Mr Julius Handford abandoned Mr Julius Handford search, came up out of Limehouse Hole, and took the way past Limehouse Church. At the great iron gate of the churchyard Mr Julius Handford stopped and looked in. Mr Julius Handford looked up at the high tower spectrally resisting the wind, and Mr Julius Handford looked round at the white tombstones, like enough to the dead in the white tombstones winding-sheets, and Mr Julius Handford counted the nine tolls of the clock-bell.  ‘It is a sensation not experienced by many mortals,’ said Mr Julius Handford, ‘to be looking into a churchyard on a wild windy night, and to feel that I no more hold a place among the living than these dead do, and even to know that I lie buried somewhere else, as these dead do lie buried here. Nothing uses me to it. A spirit that was once a man could hardly feel stranger or lonelier, going unrecognized among mankind, than I feel.  ‘But this is the fanciful side of the situation. this has a real side, so difficult that, though I think of this every day, I never thoroughly think this out. Now, let me determine to think this out as I walk home. I know I evade this, as many men--perhaps most men--do evade thinking many men--perhaps most men way through many men--perhaps most men greatest perplexity. I will try to pin myself to mine. Don’t evade this, John Harmon; don’t evade this; think this out!   ‘When I came to England, attracted to the country with which I had none but most miserable associations, by the accounts of my fine inheritance that found me abroad, I came back, shrinking from my father’s money, shrinking from my father’s memory, mistrustful of being forced on a mercenary wife, mistrustful of my father’s intention in thrusting that marriage on myself, mistrustful that I was already growing avaricious, mistrustful that I was slackening in gratitude to the two dear noble honest friends who had made the only sunlight in my childish life or that of my heartbroken sister. I came back, timid, divided in my mind, afraid of myself and everybody here, knowing of nothing but wretchedness that my father wealth had ever brought about. Now, stop, and so far think it out, John Harmon. Is that so? That is exactly so.  ‘On board serving as third mate was George Radfoot. I knew nothing of George Radfoot. George Radfoot name first became known to myself about a week before “ sailed, through my being accosted by one of the ship-agent’s clerks as George Radfoot.” It was one day when I had gone aboard to look to my preparations, and the clerk, coming behind myself as I stood on deck, tapped me on the shoulder, and said, “Mr Rad-foot, look here,” referring to some papers that he had in he hand. And my name first became known to George Radfoot, through another clerk within a day or two, and while the ship was yet in port, coming up behind he, tapping he on the shoulder and beginning, “I beg your pardon, Mr Harmon--.” I believe “ were alike in bulk and stature but not otherwise, and that “ were not strikingly alike, even in those respects, when “ were together and could be compared.  ‘However, a sociable word or two on these mistakes became an easy introduction between “, and the weather was hot, and he helped me to a cool cabin on deck alongside he own, and he first school had been at Brussels as mine had been, and he had learnt French as I had learnt it, and he had a little history of he to relate--God only knows how much of it true, and how much of it false--that had it likeness to mine. I had been a seaman too. So “ got to be confidential together, and the more easily yet, because a seaman and every one on board had known by general rumour what I was making the voyage to England for. By such degrees and means, a seaman came to the knowledge of my uneasiness of mind, and of it setting at that time in the direction of desiring to see and form some judgment of my allotted wife, before my allotted wife could possibly know me for a seaman; also to try Mrs Boffin and give my allotted wife a glad surprise. So the plot was made out of “ getting common sailors’ dresses (as the plot was able to guide me about London), and throwing “ in Bella Wilfer’s neighbourhood, and trying to put “ in my allotted wife way, and doing whatever chance might favour on the spot, and seeing what came of the spot. If nothing came of the spot, I should be no worse off, and there would merely be a short delay in my presenting a seaman to Lightwood. I have all these facts right? Yes. all these facts are all accurately right.  ‘a seaman advantage in all this was, that for a time I was to be lost. It might be for a day or for two days, but I must be lost sight of on landing, or there would be recognition, anticipation, and failure. Therefore, I disembarked with my valise in my hand--as Potterson the steward and Mr Jacob Kibble my fellow-passenger afterwards remembered--and waited for Mr Jacob Kibble in the dark by that very Limehouse Church which is now behind a seaman.  ‘As I had always shunned the port of London, I only knew Limehouse Church through Mr Jacob Kibble pointing out Limehouse Church spire from on board. Perhaps I might recall, if Limehouse Church were any good to try, the way by which I went to it alone from the river; but how we two went from it to Riderhood’s shop, I don’t know--any more than I know what turns we took and doubles we made, after we left it. The way was purposely confused, no doubt.  ‘But let me go on thinking the facts out, and avoid confusing the facts with my speculations. Whether Mr Jacob Kibble took me by a straight way or a crooked way, what is that to the purpose now? Steady, John Harmon.  ‘When we stopped at Riderhood’s, and Mr Jacob Kibble asked that scoundrel a question or two, purporting to refer only to the lodging-houses in which there was accommodation for we, had I the least suspicion of Mr Jacob Kibble? None. Certainly none until afterwards when I held the clue. I think Mr Jacob Kibble must have got from Riderhood in a paper, the drug, or whatever it was, that afterwards stupefied me, but I am far from sure. All I felt safe in charging on Mr Jacob Kibble to-night, was old companionship in villainy between them. them undisguised intimacy, and the character I now know Riderhood to bear, made that not at all adventurous. But I am not clear about the drug. Thinking out the circumstances on which I found my suspicion, they are only two. One: I remember Mr Jacob Kibble changing a small folded paper from one pocket to another, after we came out, which Mr Jacob Kibble had not touched before. Two: I now know Riderhood to have been previously taken up for being concerned in the robbery of an unlucky seaman, to whom some such poison had been given.  ‘It is my conviction that we cannot have gone a mile from that shop, before we came to the wall, the dark doorway, the flight of stairs, and the room. The night was particularly dark and it rained hard. As I think the circumstances back, I hear the rain splashing on the stone pavement of the passage, which was not under cover. the room overlooked the river, or a dock, or a creek, and the tide was out. Being possessed of the time down to that point, I know by the hour that it must have been about low water; but while the coffee was getting ready, I drew back the curtain (a dark-brown curtain), and, looking out, knew by the kind of reflection below, of the few neighbouring lights, that they were reflected in tidal mud.  ‘He had carried under He arm a canvas bag, containing a suit of He clothes. I had no change of outer clothes with me, as I was to buy slops. “You are very wet, Mr Harmon,”--I can hear Mr Harmon,”--I saying--“and I am quite dry under this good waterproof coat. Put on his clothes. You may find on trying them that them will answer your purpose to-morrow, as well as the slops you mean to buy, or better. While you change, I’ll hurry the hot coffee.” When Mr Harmon,”--I came back, I had Mr Harmon,”--I on, and there was a black man with Mr Harmon,”--I, wearing a linen jacket, like a steward, who put the smoking coffee on the table in a tray and never looked at me. I am so far literal and exact? Literal and exact, I am certain.  ‘Now, I pass to sick and deranged impressions; sick and deranged impressions are so strong, that I rely upon sick and deranged impressions; but there are spaces between sick and deranged impressions that I know nothing about, and sick and deranged impressions are not pervaded by any idea of time.  ‘I had drank some coffee, when to my sense of sight Mr Harmon,”--I began to swell immensely, and something urged me to rush at Mr Harmon,”--I. We had a struggle near the door. Mr Harmon,”--I got from me, through my not knowing where to strike, in the whirling round of the room, and the flashing of flames of fire between We. I dropped down. Lying helpless on the ground, I was turned over by a foot. I was dragged by the neck into a corner. I heard men speak together. I was turned over by other feet. I saw a figure like me lying dressed in his clothes on a bed. What might have been, for anything I knew, a silence of days, weeks, months, years, was broken by a violent wrestling of men all over the room. a figure like myself lying dressed in my clothes on a bed was assailed, and my valise was in my valise hand. I was trodden upon and fallen over. I heard a noise of blows, and thought a noise of blows was a wood-cutter cutting down a tree. I could not have said that my name was John Harmon--I could not have thought it--I didn’t know it--but when I heard blows, I thought of the wood-cutter and his axe, and had some dead idea that I was lying in a forest.  ‘This is still correct? Still correct, with the exception that I cannot possibly express it to me without using the word I. But it was not
