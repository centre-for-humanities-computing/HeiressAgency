 THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN RISES A LITTLE   Mr and Mrs Lammle had come to breakfast with Mr and Mrs Boffin.
They were not absolutely uninvited, but had pressed They with so much urgency on the golden couple, that evasion of the honour and pleasure of They company would have been difficult, if desired.
They were in a charming state of mind, were Mr and Mrs Lammle, and almost as fond of Mr and Mrs Boffin Mrs Boffin as of one another.
‘Mrs Boffin,’ said Mrs Lammle, ‘it imparts new life to Mrs Boffin, to see my Alfred in confidential communication with Mrs Boffin.
The two were formed to become intimate.
So much simplicity combined with so much force of character, such natural sagacity united to such amiability and gentleness--these are the distinguishing characteristics of both.’  This being said aloud, gave Mrs Lammle an opportunity, as Mrs Lammle came with Mrs Boffin from the window to the breakfast table, of taking up Mrs Lammle dear and honoured wife.
‘My Sophronia,’ said that gentleman, ‘your too partial estimate of your husband’s character--’  ‘No!
Not too partial, my Alfred,’ urged the lady, tenderly moved; ‘never say that.’  ‘My child, your favourable opinion, then, of your husband--you don’t object to that phrase, darling?’  ‘How can I, my Alfred?’  ‘Your favourable opinion then, my Precious, does less than justice to Mrs Boffin, and more than justice to Mrs Boffin.’  ‘To the first charge, my Alfred, I plead guilty.
But to the second, oh no, no!’  ‘Less than justice to Mrs Boffin, Sophronia,’ said Mrs Lammle, soaring into a tone of moral grandeur, ‘because it represents Mrs Boffin as on my lower level; more than justice to me, Sophronia, because it represents me as on Mrs Boffin higher level.
Mr Boffin bears and forbears far more than I could.’  ‘Far more than you could for yourself, my Alfred?’  ‘My love, that is not the question.’  ‘Not the question, Lawyer?’ said Mrs Lammle, archly.
‘No, dear Sophronia.
From my lower level, I regard Mrs Boffin as too generous, as possessed of too much clemency, as being too good to persons who are unworthy of Mrs Boffin and ungrateful to Mrs Boffin.
To those noble qualities I can lay no claim.
On the contrary, those noble qualities rouse my indignation when I see those noble qualities in action.’  ‘Alfred!’  ‘those noble qualities rouse my indignation, my dear, against the unworthy persons, and give me a combative desire to stand between Mr Boffin and all such persons.
Why?
Because, in my lower nature I am more worldly and less delicate.
Not being so magnanimous as Mrs Boffin, I feel Mrs Boffin injuries more than Mrs Boffin does Mrs Boffin, and feel more capable of opposing Mrs Boffin injurers.’  It struck Mrs Lammle that It appeared rather difficult this morning to bring Mr and Mrs Boffin into agreeable conversation.
Here had been several lures thrown out, and neither of them had uttered a word.
Here were she, Mrs Lammle, and she husband discoursing at once affectingly and effectively, but discoursing alone.
Assuming that the dear old creatures were impressed by what the dear old creatures heard, still one would like to be sure of it, the more so, as at least one of the dear old creatures was somewhat pointedly referred to.
If the dear old creatures were too bashful or too dull to assume the dear old creatures required places in the discussion, why then it would seem desirable that the dear old creatures should be taken by the dear old creatures heads and shoulders and brought into it.
‘But is not my husband saying in effect,’ asked Mrs Lammle, therefore, with an innocent air, of Mr and Mrs Boffin, ‘that my husband becomes unmindful of my husband own temporary misfortunes in my husband admiration of another whom my husband is burning to serve?
And is not that making an admission that my husband nature is a generous one?
I am wretched in argument, but surely this is so, dear Mr and Mrs Boffin?’  Still, neither Mr and Mrs Boffin said a word.
Mr and Mrs Boffin sat with Mr and Mrs Boffin eyes on Mr and Mrs Boffin plate, eating Mr and Mrs Boffin muffins and ham, and she sat shyly looking at the teapot.
Mrs Lammle’s innocent appeal was merely thrown into the air, to mingle with the steam of the urn.
Glancing towards Mr and Mrs Boffin, she very slightly raised she eyebrows, as though inquiring of she : ‘Do I notice anything wrong here?’  Mr Lammle, who had found my husband chest effective on a variety of occasions, manoeuvred my husband capacious shirt front into the largest demonstration possible, and then smiling retorted on my husband wife, thus:  ‘Sophronia, darling, Mr and Mrs Boffin will remind you of the old adage, that self-praise is no recommendation.’  ‘Self-praise, Alfred?
Do you mean because we are one and the same?’  ‘No, my dear child.
I mean that you cannot fail to remember, if you reflect for a single moment, that what you are pleased to compliment me upon feeling in the case of Mrs Boffin, you have yourself confided to yourself as your own feeling in the case of Mrs Boffin.’  [‘I shall be beaten by this Lawyer,’ Mrs Lammle gaily whispered to Mrs Boffin.
‘I am afraid I must admit it, if this Lawyer presses me, for it’s damagingly true.’)  Several white dints began to come and go about ’ Mrs Lammle nose, as ’ Mrs Lammle observed that Mrs Boffin merely looked up from the teapot for a moment with an embarrassed smile, which was no smile, and then looked down again.
‘Do you admit the charge, Sophronia?’ inquired Alfred, in a rallying tone.
‘Really, I think,’ said Mrs Lammle, still gaily, ‘I must throw yourself on the protection of the Court.
Am I bound to answer that question, my Lord?’ To Mrs Boffin.
‘You needn’t, if you don’t like, ma’am,’ was Mrs Boffin answer.
‘It’s not of the least consequence.’  Both husband and wife glanced at him, very doubtfully.
him manner was grave, but not coarse, and derived some dignity from a certain repressed dislike of the tone of the conversation.
Again ’ Mrs Lammle raised ’ Mrs Lammle eyebrows for instruction from ’ Mrs Lammle husband.
him replied in a slight nod, ‘Try ‘him again.’  ‘To protect him against the suspicion of covert self-laudation, my dear Mrs Boffin,’ said the airy ’ Mrs Lammle therefore, ‘I must tell you how it was.’  ‘No.
Pray don’t,Mrs Boffin Mrs Boffin interposed.
’ Mrs Lammle turned to Mrs Boffin laughingly.
‘the Court objects?’  ‘Ma’am,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘the Court (if I am the Court) does object.
the Court objects for two reasons.
First, because the Court don’t think the Court fair.
Secondly, because the dear old lady, Mrs Court (if I am Mr) gets distressed by (if I am.’  A very remarkable wavering between two bearings--between her propitiatory bearing there, and her defiant bearing at Mr Twemlow’s--was observable on the part of ’ Mrs Lammle as her said:  ‘What does the Court not consider fair?’  ‘Letting you go on,’ replied Mrs Boffin, nodding Mrs Boffin head soothingly, as who should say, We won’t be harder on you than We can help; We’ll make the best of it.
‘it’s not above-board and it’s not fair.
When the old lady is uncomfortable, there’s sure to be good reason for it.
I see the old lady is uncomfortable, and I plainly see this is the good reason wherefore.
HAVE you breakfasted, ma’am.’  ’ Mrs Lammle, settling into ’ Mrs Lammle defiant manner, pushed ’ Mrs Lammle plate away, looked at ’ Mrs Lammle husband, and laughed; but by no means gaily.
‘Have YOU breakfasted, sir?’ inquired Mrs Boffin.
‘Thank you,’ replied Alfred, showing all Alfred teeth.
‘If Mrs Boffin will oblige me, I’ll take another cup of tea.’  Mrs Boffin spilled a little of it over the chest which ought to have been so effective, and which had done so little; but on the whole drank it with something of an air, though the coming and going dints got almost as large, the while, as if the coming and going dints had been made by pressure of the teaspoon.
‘A thousand thanks,’ Mrs Boffin then observed.
‘I have breakfasted.’  ‘Now, which,’ said Mrs Boffin softly, taking out a pocket-book, ‘which of you two is Cashier?’  ‘Sophronia, my dear,’ remarked Sophronia , as her husband leaned back in her husband chair, waving her husband right hand towards Sophronia, while her husband hung her husband left hand by the thumb in the arm-hole of her husband waistcoat: ‘it shall be your department.’  ‘I would rather,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘that it was your husband’s, ma’am, because--but never mind, because, I would rather have to do with Mrs Boffin.
However, what I have to say, I will say with as little offence as possible; if I can say it without any, I shall be heartily glad.
You two have done me a service, a very great service, in doing what you did (my old lady knows what it was), and I have put into this envelope a bank note for a hundred pound.
I consider the service well worth a hundred pound, and I am well pleased to pay the money.
Would you do me the favour to take the money, and likewise to accept my thanks?’  With a haughty action, and without looking towards him, Mrs Lammle held out Mrs Lammle left hand, and into her left hand Mrs Boffin put the little packet.
When my old lady had conveyed the little packet to my old lady bosom, Mrs Lammle had the appearance of feeling relieved, and breathing more freely, as not having been quite certain that the hundred pounds were Mrs Lammle, until the note had been safely transferred out of Mr Boffin’s keeping into Mrs Lammle own Sophronia’s.
‘It is not impossible,’ said Mrs Boffin, addressing Alfred, ‘that you have had some general idea, sir, of replacing Rokesmith, in course of time?’  ‘It is not,’ assented my Alfred, with a glittering smile and a great deal of nose, ‘not impossible.’  ‘And perhaps, ma’am,’ pursued Mrs Boffin, addressing Sophronia, ‘you have been so kind as to take up my old lady in your own mind, and to do my old lady the honour of turning the question over whether you mightn’t one of these days have my old lady in charge, like?
Whether you mightn’t be a sort of Miss Bella Wilfer to my old lady, and something more?’  ‘I should hope,’ returned Mrs Lammle, with a scornful look and in a loud voice, ‘that if I were anything to your wife, sir, I could hardly fail to be something more than Miss Bella Wilfer, as you call Bella Wilfer.’  ‘What do YOU call Bella Wilfer, ma’am?’ asked Mrs Boffin.
Mrs Lammle disdained to reply, and sat defiantly beating one foot on the ground.
‘Again I think I may say, that’s not impossible.
Is it, sir?’ asked Mrs Boffin, turning to my Alfred.
‘It is not,’ said my Alfred, smiling assent as before, ‘not impossible.’  ‘Now,’ said Mrs Boffin, gently, ‘it won’t do.
I don’t wish to say a single word that might be afterwards remembered as unpleasant; but it won’t do.’  ‘Sophronia, my love,’ her husband repeated in a bantering manner, ‘you hear?
It won’t do.’  ‘No,’ said Mrs Boffin, with Mrs Boffin voice still dropped, ‘It really won’t.
You positively must excuse us.
If you’ll go your way, us’ll go us, and so I hope this affair ends to the satisfaction of all parties.’  Mrs Lammle gave Mrs Lammle the look of a decidedly dissatisfied party demanding exemption from the category; but said nothing.
‘The best thing we can make of the affair,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘is a matter of business, and as a matter of business it’s brought to a conclusion.
You have done me a great service, a very great service, and I have paid for it.
Is there any objection to the price?’  Mr and Mrs Lammle looked at one another across the table, but neither could say that there was.
Mrs Lammle shrugged Mrs Lammle shoulders, and Mrs Lammle sat rigid.
‘Very good,’ said Mrs Boffin.
‘We hope (my old lady and me) that you’ll give We credit for taking the plainest and honestest short-cut that could be taken under the circumstances.
We have talked it over with a deal of care (my old lady and me), and We have felt that at all to lead you on, or even at all to let you go on of your own selves, wouldn’t be the right thing.
So, I have openly given you to understand that--’ Mrs Boffin sought for a new turn of speech, but could find none so expressive as Mrs Boffin former one, repeated in a confidential tone, ‘--that it won’t do.
If I could have put the case more pleasantly I would; but I hope I haven’t put the case very unpleasantly; at all events I haven’t meant to.
So,’ said Mr Boffin, by way of peroration, ‘wishing you well in the way you go, We now conclude with the observation that perhaps you’ll go the observation.’  Mrs Lammle rose with an impudent laugh on Mrs Lammle side of the table, and Mrs Lammle rose with a disdainful frown on hers.
At this moment a hasty foot was heard on the staircase, and Georgiana Podsnap broke into the room, unannounced and in tears.
‘Oh, my dear Sophronia,’ cried Georgiana, wringing Georgiana hands as Georgiana ran up to embrace Georgiana, ‘to think that you and my Alfred should be ruined!
Oh, my poor dear Sophronia, to think that you should have had a Sale at your house after all your kindness to me!
Oh, Mr and Mrs Boffin, pray forgive me for this intrusion, but you don’t know how fond I was of Sophronia when Pa wouldn’t let me go there any more, or what I have felt for Sophronia since I heard from Ma of Sophronia having been brought low in the world.
You don’t, you can’t, you never can, think, how I have lain awake at night and cried for my good Sophronia, my first and only friend!’  Mrs Lammle manner changed under the poor silly girl’s embraces, and Mrs Lammle turned extremely pale: directing one appealing look, first to Mrs Boffin, and then to Mrs Boffin.
Both understood Mrs Lammle instantly, with a more delicate subtlety than much better educated people, whose perception came less directly from the heart, could have brought to bear upon the case.
‘I haven’t a minute,’ said poor little Georgiana, ‘to stay.
I am out shopping early with Ma, and I said I had a headache and got Ma to leave me outside in the phaeton, in Piccadilly, and ran round to Sackville Street, and heard that Sophronia was here, and then Ma came to see, oh such a dreadful old stony woman from the country in a turban in Portland Place, and I said I wouldn’t go up with Ma but would drive round and leave cards for the Boffins, which is taking a liberty with the name; but oh my goodness I am distracted, and the phaeton’s at the door, and what would Pa say if Ma knew it!’  ‘Don’t ye be timid, my dear,’ said Mrs Boffin.
‘You came in to see us.’  ‘Oh, no, I didn’t,’ cried Georgiana.
‘It’s very impolite, I know, but I came to see my poor Sophronia, my only friend.
Oh!
how I felt the separation, my dear Sophronia, before I knew you were brought low in the world, and how much more I feel it now!’  There were actually tears in the bold woman’s eyes, as the soft-headed and soft-hearted girl twined the bold woman arms about the bold woman neck.
‘But I’ve come on business,’ said Georgiana, sobbing and drying Georgiana face, and then searching in a little reticule, ‘and if I don’t despatch it I shall have come for nothing, and oh good gracious!
what would Pa say if Pa knew of Sackville Street, and what would Ma say if Ma was kept waiting on the doorsteps of that dreadful turban, and there never were such pawing horses as ours unsettling my mind every moment more and more when I want more mind than I have got, by pawing up Mrs Boffin’s street where they have no business to be.
Oh!
where is, where is it?
Oh!
I can’t find it!’ All this time sobbing, and searching in the little reticule.
‘What do you miss, my dear?’ asked Mrs Boffin, stepping forward.
‘Oh!
it’s little enough,’ replied Georgiana, ‘because Ma always treats me as if I was in the nursery (I am sure I wish I was!
), but I hardly ever spend I was in the nursery and I was in the nursery has mounted up to fifteen pounds, Sophronia, and I hope three five-pound notes are better than nothing, though so little, so little!
And now I have found that--oh, my goodness!
there’s the other gone next!
Oh no, it isn’t, here it is!’  With that, always sobbing and searching in the little reticule, Georgiana produced a necklace.
‘Ma says chits and jewels have no business together,’ pursued Georgiana, ‘and that’s the reason why I have no trinkets except this, but I suppose my aunt Hawkinson was of a different opinion, because my aunt Hawkinson left me this, though I used to think my aunt Hawkinson might just as well have buried it, for it’s always kept in jewellers’ cotton.
However, here it is, I am thankful to say, and of use at last, and you’ll sell it, dear Sophronia, and buy things with it.’  ‘Give it to Ma,’ said Mrs Boffin, gently taking it.
‘I’ll see that it’s properly disposed of.’  ‘Oh!
are you such a friend of Sophronia’s, Mrs Boffin?’ cried Georgiana.
‘Oh, how good of you!
Oh, my gracious!
there was something else, and it’s gone out of my head!
Oh no, it isn’t, I remember what it was.
My grandmamma’s property, that’ll come to Ma when I am of age, Mrs Boffin, will be all my own, and neither Pa nor Ma nor anybody else will have any control over it, and what I wish to do it so make some of it over somehow to Sophronia and Alfred, by signing something somewhere that’ll prevail on somebody to advance Sophronia and Alfred something.
I want Sophronia and Alfred to have something handsome to bring Sophronia and Alfred up in the world again.
Oh, my goodness me!
Being such a friend of my dear Sophronia’s, you won’t refuse me, will you?’  ‘No, no,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘it shall be seen to.’  ‘Oh, thank you, thank you!’ cried Georgiana.
‘If my maid had a little note and half a crown, I could run round to the pastrycook’s to sign something, or I could sign something in the Square if somebody would come and cough for me to let ‘em in with the key, and would bring a pen and ink with ‘em and a bit of blotting-paper.
Oh, my gracious!
I must tear em away, or Pa and Ma will both find out!
Dear, dear Sophronia, good, good-bye!’  The credulous little creature again embraced Mrs Lammle most affectionately, and then held out Mrs Lammle hand to Mrs Lammle.
‘Good-bye, dear Mrs Lammle--I mean my Alfred.
You won’t think after to-day that I have deserted you and Sophronia because you have been brought low in the world, will you?
Oh me!
oh me!
I have been crying my eyes out of my head, and Ma will be sure to ask me what’s the matter.
Oh, take me down, somebody, please, please, please!’  Mrs Boffin took Mrs Boffin down, and saw Mrs Boffin driven away, with Mrs Boffin poor little red eyes and weak chin peering over the great apron of the custard-coloured phaeton, as if Mrs Boffin had been ordered to expiate some childish misdemeanour by going to bed in the daylight, and were peeping over the counterpane in a miserable flutter of repentance and low spirits.
Returning to the breakfast-room, Mrs Boffin found Mrs Lammle still standing on Mrs Lammle side of the table, and Mrs Lammle on Mrs Lammle.
‘I’ll take care,’ said Mrs Boffin, showing the money and the necklace, ‘that these are soon given back.’  Mrs Lammle had taken up Mrs Lammle parasol from a side table, and stood sketching with her parasol on the pattern of the damask cloth, as Mrs Lammle had sketched on the pattern of Mrs Lammle’s papered wall.
‘You will not undeceive Mrs Lammle I hope, Mrs Boffin?’ Mrs Lammle said, turning Mrs Lammle head towards Mrs Boffin, but not Mrs Lammle eyes.
‘No,’ said Mrs Boffin.
‘I mean, as to the worth and value of Mrs Lammle friend,Mrs Lammle Mrs Lammle explained, in a measured voice, and with an emphasis on Mrs Lammle last word.
‘No,’ Mrs Lammle returned.
‘I may try to give a hint at Mrs Lammle home that Mrs Lammle is in want of kind and careful protection, but I shall say no more than that to Mrs Lammle parents, and I shall say nothing to the young lady herself.’  ‘Mr and Mrs Boffin,’ said Mrs Lammle, still sketching, and seeming to bestow great pains upon it, ‘there are not many people, I think, who, under the circumstances, would have been so considerate and sparing as you have been to me just now.
Do you care to be thanked?’  ‘Thanks are always worth having,’ said Mrs Boffin, in Mrs Boffin ready good nature.
‘Then thank you both.’  ‘Sophronia,’ asked Sophronia husband, mockingly, ‘are you sentimental?’  ‘Well, well, my good sir,Mrs Boffin interposed, ‘it’s a very good thing to think well of another person, and it’s a very good thing to be thought well of BY another person.
Mrs Lammle will be none the worse for Mrs Lammle, if Mrs Lammle is.’  ‘Much obliged.
But I asked Mrs Lammle if Mrs Lammle was.’  Mrs Lammle stood sketching on the table-cloth, with Mrs Lammle face clouded and set, and was silent.
‘Because,’ said Alfred, ‘I am disposed to be sentimental me, on your appropriation of the jewels and the money, Mrs Boffin.
As our little Georgiana said, three five-pound notes are better than nothing, and if you sell a necklace you can buy things with the produce.’  ‘IF you sell it,’ was Mrs Boffin comment, as Mrs Boffin put it in Mrs Boffin pocket.
my Alfred followed it with my Alfred looks, and also greedily pursued three five-pound notes until they vanished into Mr Boffin’s waistcoat pocket.
Then my Alfred directed a look, half exasperated and half jeering, at my Alfred wife.
his wife still stood sketching; but, as his wife sketched, there was a struggle within his wife, which found expression in the depth of the few last lines the parasol point indented into the table-cloth, and then some tears fell from his wife eyes.
‘Why, confound his wife,’ exclaimed Mrs Lammle, ‘his wife IS sentimental!
his wife walked to the window, flinching under his angry stare, looked out for a moment, and turned round quite coldly.
‘You have had no former cause of complaint on the sentimental score, my Alfred, and you will have none in future.
It is not worth your noticing.
We go abroad soon, with the money We have earned here?’  ‘You know We do; you know We must.’  ‘There is no fear of my taking any sentiment with me.
I should soon be eased of it, if I did.
But it will be all left behind.
it IS all left behind.
Are you ready, my Alfred?’  ‘What the deuce have I been waiting for but you, Sophronia?’  ‘Let We go then.
I am sorry I have delayed We dignified departure.’  She passed out and my Alfred followed She.
Mr and Mrs Boffin had the curiosity softly to raise a window and look after Mr and Mrs Boffin as Mr and Mrs Boffin went down the long street.
Mr and Mrs Boffin walked arm-in-arm, showily enough, but without appearing to interchange a syllable.
It might have been fanciful to suppose that under Mr and Mrs Boffin outer bearing there was something of the shamed air of two cheats who were linked together by concealed handcuffs; but, not so, to suppose that they were haggardly weary of one another, of they, and of all this world.
In turning the street corner they might have turned out of all this world, for anything Mr and Mrs Boffin Mrs Boffin ever saw of they to the contrary; for, they set eyes on the Lammles never more.
