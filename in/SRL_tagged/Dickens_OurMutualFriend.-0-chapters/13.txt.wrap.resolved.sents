 TRACKING THE BIRD OF PREY   The two lime merchants, with The two lime merchants escort, entered the dominions of Miss Abbey Potterson, to whom The two lime merchants escort (presenting The two lime merchants and The two lime merchants pretended business over the half-door of the bar, in a confidential way) preferred his figurative request that ‘a mouthful of fire’ might be lighted in Cosy.
Always well disposed to assist the constituted authorities, Miss Abbey bade Bob Gliddery attend the gentlemen to that retreat, and promptly enliven Miss Abbey with fire and gaslight.
Of this commission the bare-armed Bob, leading the way with a flaming wisp of paper, so speedily acquitted Bob Gliddery, that Cosy seemed to leap out of a dark sleep and embrace them warmly, the moment them passed the lintels of Miss Abbey hospitable door.
‘them burn sherry very well here,’ said Mr Inspector, as a piece of local intelligence.
‘Perhaps the gentlemen might like a bottle?’  The answer being By all means, Bob Gliddery received Bob Gliddery instructions from Mr Inspector, and departed in a becoming state of alacrity engendered by reverence for the majesty of the law.
‘It’s a certain fact,’ said Mr Inspector, ‘that this man we have received we information from,’ indicating Riderhood with Riderhood thumb over Riderhood shoulder, ‘has for some time past given the other man a bad name arising out of your lime barges, and that the other man has been avoided in consequence.
I don’t say what it means or proves, but it’s a certain fact.
I had it first from one of the opposite sex of my acquaintance,’ vaguely indicating Miss Abbey with my acquaintance thumb over my acquaintance shoulder, ‘down away at a distance, over yonder.’  Then probably Mr Inspector was not quite unprepared for their visit that evening?
Lightwood hinted.
‘Well you see,’ said Mr Inspector, ‘it was a question of making a move.
it’s of no use moving if you don’t know what your move is.
You had better by far keep still.
In the matter of this lime, I certainly had an idea that it might lie betwixt the two men; I always had an idea that it might lie betwixt the two men.
Still I was forced to wait for a start, and I wasn’t so lucky as to get a start.
This man that we have received we information from, has got a start, and if This man that we have received our information don’t meet with a check This man that we have received our information may make the running and come in first.
There may turn out to be something considerable for This man that we have received our information that comes in second, and I don’t mention who may or who may not try for that place.
There’s duty to do, and I shall do it, under any circumstances; to the best of my judgment and ability.’  ‘Speaking as a shipper of lime--’ began Eugene.
‘Which no man has a better right to do than yourself, you know,’ said Mr Inspector.
‘I hope not,’ said Eugene; ‘my father having been a shipper of lime before me, and my grandfather before no man--in fact we having been a family immersed to the crowns of we heads in lime during several generations--I beg to observe that if this missing lime could be got hold of without any young female relative of any distinguished gentleman engaged in the lime trade (which I cherish next to my life) being present, I think it might be a more agreeable proceeding to the assisting bystanders, that is to say, lime-burners.’  ‘I also,’ said Lightwood, pushing Lightwood friend aside with a laugh, ‘should much prefer that.’  ‘It shall be done, gentlemen, if It can be done conveniently,’ said Mr Inspector, with coolness.
‘There is no wish on my part to cause any distress in that quarter.
Indeed, I am sorry for that quarter.’  ‘There was a boy in that quarter,’ remarked Eugene.
‘a boy is still there?’  ‘No,’ said Mr Inspector.
‘a boy has quitted those works.
a boy is otherwise disposed of.’  ‘Will she be left alone then?’ asked Eugene.
‘she will be left,’ said Mr Inspector, ‘alone.’  Bob’s reappearance with a steaming jug broke off the conversation.
But although a steaming jug steamed forth a delicious perfume, a delicious perfume contents had not received that last happy touch which the surpassing finish of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters imparted on such momentous occasions.
Bob carried in Bob left hand one of those iron models of sugar-loaf hats, before mentioned, into which Bob emptied a steaming jug, and the pointed end of which Bob thrust deep down into the fire, so leaving it for a few moments while Bob disappeared and reappeared with three bright drinking-glasses.
Placing these on the table and bending over the fire, meritoriously sensible of the trying nature of Bob duty, Bob watched the wreaths of steam, until at the special instant of projection Bob caught up the iron vessel and gave the iron vessel one delicate twirl, causing the iron vessel to send forth one gentle hiss.
Then Bob restored the contents to a steaming jug; held over the steam of a steaming jug, each of the three bright glasses in succession; finally filled them all, and with a clear conscience awaited the applause of Bob fellow-creatures.
It was bestowed (Mr Inspector having proposed as an appropriate sentiment ‘The lime trade!’) and Bob withdrew to report the commendations of the guests to Miss Abbey in the bar.
It may be here in confidence admitted that, the room being close shut in Bob absence, there had not appeared to be the slightest reason for the elaborate maintenance of this same lime fiction.
Only it had been regarded by Mr Inspector as so uncommonly satisfactory, and so fraught with mysterious virtues, that neither of Mr Inspector clients had presumed to question it.
Two taps were now heard on the outside of the window.
Mr Inspector, hastily fortifying Mr Inspector with another glass, strolled out with a noiseless foot and an unoccupied countenance.
As one might go to survey the weather and the general aspect of the heavenly bodies.
‘This is becoming grim, Mortimer,’ said Eugene, in a low voice.
‘I don’t like this.’  ‘Nor I’ said Lightwood.
‘Shall we go?’  ‘Being here, let we stay.
You ought to see it out, and I won’t leave you.
Besides, that lonely girl with the dark hair runs in my head.
It was little more than a glimpse we had of that lonely girl with the dark hair that last time, and yet I almost see that lonely girl with the dark hair waiting by the fire to-night.
Do you feel like a dark combination of traitor and pickpocket when you think of that lonely girl with the dark hair?’  ‘Rather,’ returned Lightwood.
‘Do you?’  ‘Very much so.’  Their escort strolled back again, and reported.
Divested of Their various lime-lights and shadows, his report went to the effect that Gaffer was away in his boat, supposed to be on his old look-out; that his had been expected last high-water; that having missed it for some reason or other, his was not, according to his usual habits at night, to be counted on before next high-water, or it might be an hour or so later; that his daughter, surveyed through the window, would seem to be so expecting his, for the supper was not cooking, but set out ready to be cooked; that the supper would be high-water at about one, and that it was now barely ten; that there was nothing to be done but watch and wait; that the informer was keeping watch at the instant of that present reporting, but that two heads were better than one (especially when the second was Mr Inspector’s); and that his meant to share the watch.
And forasmuch as crouching under the lee of a hauled-up boat on a night when it blew cold and strong, and when the weather was varied with blasts of hail at times, might be wearisome to amateurs, his closed with the recommendation that the two gentlemen should remain, for a while at any rate, in the two gentlemen present quarters, which were weather-tight and warm.
the two gentlemen were not inclined to dispute the recommendation that the two gentlemen should remain, but the two gentlemen wanted to know where the two gentlemen could join the watchers when so disposed.
Rather than trust to a verbal description of the place, which might mislead, Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on Eugene than Eugene usually had) would go out with Mr Inspector, note the spot, and come back.
On the shelving bank of the river, among the slimy stones of a causeway--not the special causeway of the Six Jolly Fellowships, which had a landing-place of the shelving bank of the river own, but another, a little removed, and very near to the old windmill which was the denounced man’s dwelling-place--were a few boats; some, moored and already beginning to float; others, hauled up above the reach of the tide.
Under one of these latter, Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had)’s companion disappeared.
And when Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) had observed its position with reference to the other boats, and had made sure that Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) could not miss it, Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) turned Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) eyes upon the building where, as Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) had been told, the lonely girl with the dark hair sat by the fire.
Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) could see the light of the fire shining through the window.
Perhaps the light of the fire shining through the window drew Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) on to look in.
Perhaps Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) had come out with the express intention.
That part of the shelving bank of the river having rank grass growing on rank grass, there was no difficulty in getting close, without any noise of footsteps: it was but to scramble up a ragged face of pretty hard mud some three or four feet high and come upon the grass and to the window.
Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) came to the window by that means.
She had no other light than the light of the fire.
The unkindled lamp stood on the table.
She sat on the ground, looking at the brazier, with She face leaning on She hand.
There was a kind of film or flicker on She face, which at first he took to be the fitful firelight; but, on a second look, he saw that She was weeping.
A sad and solitary spectacle, as shown he by the rising and the falling of the fire.
It was a little window of but four pieces of glass, and was not curtained; he chose It because the larger window near It was.
It showed he the room, and the bills upon the wall respecting the drowned people starting out and receding by turns.
But he glanced slightly at the drowned people starting out and receding by turns, though he looked long and steadily at She.
A deep rich piece of colour, with the brown flush of She cheek and the shining lustre of She hair, though sad and solitary, weeping by the rising and the falling of the fire.
She started up.
he had been so very still that he felt sure it was not he who had disturbed She, so merely withdrew from the window and stood near the window in the shadow of the wall.
She opened the door, and said in an alarmed tone, ‘Father, was that you calling me?’ And again, ‘Father!’ And once again, after listening, Father!
I thought I heard you call me twice before!’  No response.
As she re-entered at the door, he dropped over the shelving bank of the river and made he way back, among the ooze and near the hiding-place, to Lightwood: to whom he told what he had seen of She, and how this was becoming very grim indeed.
‘If he feels as guilty as I do,’ said Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had), ‘he is remarkably uncomfortable.’  ‘Influence of secrecy,’ suggested Lightwood.
‘I am not at all obliged to it for making me Guy Fawkes in the vault and a Sneak in the area both at once,’ said Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had).
‘Give me some more of that stuff.’  Lightwood helped Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) to some more of that stuff, but Lightwood had been cooling, and didn’t answer now.
‘Pooh,’ said Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had), spitting Lightwood out among the ashes.
‘Tastes like the wash of the river.’  ‘Are you so familiar with the flavour of the wash of the river?’  ‘I seem to be to-night.
I feel as if I had been half drowned, and swallowing a gallon of it.’  ‘Influence of locality,’ suggested Lightwood.
‘You are mighty learned to-night, you and your influences,’ returned Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had).
‘How long shall we stay here?’  ‘How long do you think?’  ‘If I could choose, I should say a minute,’ replied Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had), ‘for the Jolly Fellowship Porters are not the jolliest dogs I have known.
But I suppose we are best here until the Jolly Fellowship Porters are not the jolliest dogs I have known turn we out with the other suspicious characters, at midnight.’  Thereupon a minute stirred the fire, and sat down on one side of the fire.
the fire struck eleven, and a minute made believe to compose a minute patiently.
But gradually a minute took the fidgets in one leg, and then in the other leg, and then in one arm, and then in the other arm, and then in a minute chin, and then in a minute back, and then in a minute forehead, and then in a minute hair, and then in a minute nose; and then a minute stretched a minute recumbent on two chairs, and groaned; and then a minute started up.
‘Invisible insects of diabolical activity swarm in this place.
I am tickled and twitched all over.
Mentally, I have now committed a burglary under the meanest circumstances, and the myrmidons of justice are at my heels.’  ‘I am quite as bad,’ said Lightwood, sitting up facing a minute, with a tumbled head; after going through some wonderful evolutions, in which a tumbled head had been the lowest part of a minute.
‘This restlessness began with me, long ago.
All the time you were out, I felt like Gulliver with the Lilliputians firing upon a minute.’  ‘It won’t do, Mortimer.
We must get into the air; We must join We dear friend and brother, Riderhood.
And let We tranquillize We by making a compact.
Next time (with a view to our peace of mind) our’ll commit the crime, instead of taking the criminal.
You swear it?’  ‘Certainly.’  ‘Sworn!
Let Tippins look to it.
Tippins life’s in danger.’  Mortimer rang the bell to pay the score, and Bob appeared to transact that business with Mortimer: whom Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had), in Mortimer careless extravagance, asked if Mortimer would like a situation in the lime-trade?
‘Thankee sir, Thankee sir,’ said Bob.
‘I’ve a good sitiwation here, Thankee sir.’  ‘If you change your mind at any time,’ returned Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had), ‘come to Thankee sir at my works, and you’ll always find an opening in the lime-kiln.’  ‘Thankee sir,’ said Bob.
‘This is my partner,’ said Eugene, ‘who keeps the books and attends to the wages.
A fair day’s wages for a fair day’s work is ever my partner’s motto.’  ‘And a very good ‘un it is, gentlemen,’ said Bob, receiving Bob fee, and drawing a bow out of Bob head with Bob right hand, very much as Bob would have drawn a pint of beer out of the beer engine.
‘Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had),’ Mortimer apostrophized Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had), laughing quite heartily when they were alone again, ‘how CAN you be so ridiculous?’  ‘I am in a ridiculous humour,’ quoth Eugene; ‘I am a ridiculous fellow.
Everything is ridiculous.
Come along!’  It passed into Lightwood mind that a change of some sort, best expressed perhaps as an intensification of all that was wildest and most negligent and reckless in Lightwood friend, had come upon Lightwood in the last half-hour or so.
Thoroughly used to Lightwood as Lightwood was, Lightwood found something new and strained in Lightwood that was for the moment perplexing.
This passed into Lightwood mind, and passed out again; but Lightwood remembered This afterwards.
‘There’s where she sits, you see,’ said Eugene, when they were standing under the shelving bank of the river, roared and riven at by the wind.
‘There’s the light of she fire.’  ‘I’ll take a peep through the window,’ said Mortimer.
‘No, don’t!’ Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) caught Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) by the arm.
‘Best, not make a show of she.
Come to his friend.’  Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) led Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) to the post of watch, and they both dropped down and crept under the lee of the boat; a better shelter than it had seemed before, being directly contrasted with the blowing wind and the bare night.
‘Mr Inspector at home?’ whispered Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had).
‘Here I am, Thankee sir.’  ‘And our is at the far corner there?
Good.
Anything happened?’  ‘Thankee sir daughter has been out, thinking His daughter heard Thankee sir calling, unless it was a sign to Thankee sir to keep out of the way.
It might have been.’  ‘It might have been Rule Britannia,’ muttered Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had), ‘but It wasn’t.
Mortimer!’  ‘Here!’ (On the other side of Mr Inspector.)
‘Two burglaries now, and a forgery!’  With this indication of Thankee sir depressed state of mind, Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) fell silent.
They were all silent for a long while.
As it got to be flood-tide, and the water came nearer to They, noises on the river became more frequent, and They listened more.
To the turning of steam-paddles, to the clinking of iron chain, to the creaking of blocks, to the measured working of oars, to the occasional violent barking of some passing dog on shipboard, who seemed to scent They lying in They hiding-place.
The night was not so dark but that, besides the lights at bows and mastheads gliding to and fro, they could discern some shadowy bulk attached; and now and then a ghostly lighter with a large dark sail, like a warning arm, would start up very near some shadowy bulk attached, pass on, and vanish.
At this time of some shadowy bulk attached watch, the water close to some shadowy bulk attached would be often agitated by some impulsion given it from a distance.
Often some shadowy bulk attached believed this beat and plash to be the boat some shadowy bulk attached lay in wait for, running in ashore; and again and again some shadowy bulk attached would have started up, but for the immobility with which the informer, well used to the river, kept quiet in the informer place.
The wind carried away the striking of the great multitude of city church clocks, for those lay to leeward of those lay to leeward of them; but there were bells to windward that told those lay to leeward of them of its being One--Two--Three.
Without that aid that aid would have known how The night wore, by the falling of the tide, recorded in the appearance of an ever-widening black wet strip of shore, and the emergence of the paved causeway from the river, foot by foot.
As the time so passed, this slinking business became a more and more precarious one.
It would seem as if the man had had some intimation of what was in hand against the man, or had taken fright?
the man movements might have been planned to gain for the man, in getting beyond His movements reach, twelve hours’ advantage?
the man the man became uneasy, and began to complain with bitterness of the proneness of mankind to cheat the man--the man invested with the dignity of Labour!
Their retreat was so chosen that while Their could watch the river, Their could watch the house.
No one had passed in or out, since His daughter thought His daughter heard Father calling.
No one could pass in or out without being seen.
‘But it will be light at five,’ said Mr Inspector, ‘and then WE shall be seen.’  ‘Look here,’ said Riderhood, ‘what do you say to this?
the man may have been lurking in and out, and just holding the man own betwixt two or three bridges, for hours back.’  ‘What do you make of that?’ said Mr Inspector.
Stoical, but contradictory.
‘the man may be doing so at this present time.’  ‘What do you make of that?’ said Mr Inspector.
‘My boat’s among them boats here at the cause’ay.’  ‘And what do you make of My boat’s among them?’ said Mr Inspector.
‘What if I put off in His daughter and take a look round?
I know the man ways, and the likely nooks the man favours.
I know where the man’d be at such a time of the tide, and where the man’d be at such another time.
Ain’t I been the man pardner?
None of you need show.
None of you you need stir.
I can shove His daughter off without help; and as to me being seen, I’m about at all times.’  ‘You might have given a worse opinion,’ said Mr Inspector, after brief consideration.
‘Try it.’  ‘Stop a bit.
Let’s work it out.
If I want you, I’ll drop round under the Fellowships and tip you a whistle.’  ‘If I might so far presume as to offer a suggestion to my honourable and gallant friend, whose knowledge of naval matters far be it from me to impeach,Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) struck in with great deliberation, ‘it would be, that to tip a whistle is to advertise mystery and invite speculation.
my honourable and gallant friend, whose knowledge of naval matters far be it from me to impeach will, I trust, excuse me, as an independent member, for throwing out a remark which I feel to be due to this house and the country.’  ‘Was that the T’other Governor, or Lawyer Lightwood?’ asked Riderhood.
For, the T’other Governor, or Lawyer Lightwood spoke as the T’other Governor, or Lawyer Lightwood crouched or lay, without seeing one another’s faces.
‘In reply to the question put by my honourable and gallant friend, whose knowledge of naval matters far be it from me to impeach,’ said Eugene, who was lying on Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) back with Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) hat on Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) face, as an attitude highly expressive of watchfulness, ‘I can have no hesitation in replying (it not being inconsistent with the public service) that those accents were the accents of the T’other Governor.’  ‘You’ve tolerable good eyes, ain’t you, Governor?
You’ve all tolerable good eyes, ain’t you?’ demanded the informer.
All.
‘Then if I row up under the Fellowship and lay there, no need to whistle.
You’ll make out that there’s a speck of something or another there, and you’ll know it’s me, and you’ll come down that cause’ay to me.
Understood all?’  Understood all.
‘Off Understood all.
goes then!’  In a moment, with the wind cutting keenly at him sideways, him was staggering down to him boat; in a few moments him was clear, and creeping up the river under their own shore.
Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) had raised Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) on Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) elbow to look into the darkness after Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had).
‘I wish the boat of my honourable and gallant friend, whose knowledge of naval matters far be it from me to impeach,’ Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) murmured, lying down again and speaking into his hat, ‘may be endowed with philanthropy enough to turn bottom-upward and extinguish him!--Mortimer.’  ‘his friend.’  ‘Three burglaries, two forgeries, and a midnight assassination.’ Yet in spite of having those weights on Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) conscience, Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) was somewhat enlivened by the late slight change in the circumstances of affairs.
So were Eugene (with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually had) two companions.
Its being a change was everything.
The suspense seemed to have taken a new lease, and to have begun afresh from a recent date.
There was something additional to look for.
They were all three more sharply on the alert, and less deadened by the miserable influences of the place and time.
More than an hour had passed, and They were even dozing, when one of the three--each said it was he, and he had NOT dozed--made out Riderhood in he at the spot agreed on.
They sprang up, came out from They shelter, and went down to he.
When he saw They coming, he dropped alongside the causeway; so that They, standing on the causeway, could speak with he in whispers, under the shadowy mass of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters fast asleep.
‘Blest if I can make it out!’ said he, staring at They.
‘Make what out?
Have you seen he?’  ‘No.’  ‘What HAVE you seen?’ asked Lightwood.
For, he was staring at They in the strangest way.
‘I’ve seen he .’  ‘Not empty?’  ‘Yes, empty.
And what’s more,--adrift.
And ’s more,--adrift gone.
And what’s more,--with t’other scull jammed in the thowels and broke short off.
And what’s more,--the boat’s drove tight by the tide ‘atwixt two tiers of barges.
And what’s more,--he’s in luck again, by George if George ain’t!’
