 IN WHICH THE ORPHAN MAKES  IN WHICH WILL   The Secretary, working in the Dismal Swamp betimes next morning, was informed that a youth waited in the hall who gave the name of Sloppy.
The footman who communicated this intelligence made a decent pause before uttering the name, to express that the name was forced on The footman who communicated this intelligence reluctance by a youth in question, and that if a youth had had the good sense and good taste to inherit some other name it would have spared the feelings of The footman who communicated this intelligence the bearer.
‘Mrs Boffin will be very well pleased,’ said The Secretary in a perfectly composed way.
‘Show The Secretary in.’  Mr Sloppy being introduced, remained close to the door: revealing in various parts of Mr Sloppy form many surprising, confounding, and incomprehensible buttons.
‘I am glad to see you,’ said John Rokesmith, in a cheerful tone of welcome.
‘I have been expecting you.’  Mr Sloppy explained that Mr Sloppy had meant to come before, but that the Orphan (of whom Mr Sloppy made mention as Our Johnny) had been ailing, and Mr Sloppy had waited to report Mr Sloppy well.
‘Then Mr Sloppy is well now?’ said The Secretary.
‘No Mr Sloppy ain’t,’ said Mr Sloppy.
Mr Sloppy having shaken Mr Sloppy head to a considerable extent, proceeded to remark that Mr Sloppy thought Johnny ‘must have took ‘em from the Minders.’ Being asked what Mr Sloppy meant, Mr Sloppy answered, them that come out upon Mr Sloppy and partickler Mr Sloppy chest.
Being requested to explain Mr Sloppy, Mr Sloppy stated that there was some of ‘em wot you couldn’t kiver with a sixpence.
Pressed to fall back upon a nominative case, Mr Sloppy opined that they wos about as red as ever red could be.
‘But as long as they strikes out’ards, sir,’ continued Sloppy, ‘they ain’t so much.
It’s they striking in’ards that’s to be kep off.’  John Rokesmith hoped the child had had medical attendance?
Oh yes, said Mr Sloppy, John Rokesmith had been took to the doctor’s shop once.
And what did the doctor call the doctor?
John Rokesmith asked the doctor.
After some perplexed reflection, Mr Sloppy answered, brightening, ‘the doctor called the doctor something as wos wery long for spots.’ John Rokesmith suggested measles.
‘No,’ said Mr Sloppy with confidence, ‘ever so much longer than THEM, sir!’ (Mr Sloppy was elevated by this fact, and seemed to consider that it reflected credit on the poor little patient.)
‘Mrs Boffin will be sorry to hear this,’ said John Rokesmith.
‘Mrs Higden said so, sir, when Mrs Higden kep Mrs Higden from Mrs Higden, hoping as Our Johnny would work round.’  ‘But I hope Our Johnny will?’ said Rokesmith, with a quick turn upon the messenger.
‘I hope so,’ answered Mr Sloppy.
‘It all depends on their striking in’ards.’ Our Johnny then went on to say that whether Our Johnny had ‘took ‘Our Johnny’ from the Minders, or whether the Minders had ‘took Our Johnny from Our Johnny, the Minders had been sent home and had ‘got Our Johnny.
Furthermore, that Mrs Higden days and nights being devoted to Our Johnny, who was never out of Mrs Higden lap, the whole of the mangling arrangements had devolved upon Mrs Higden, and Mrs Higden had had ‘rayther a tight time’.
The ungainly piece of honesty beamed and blushed as Mrs Higden said it, quite enraptured with the remembrance of having been serviceable.
‘Last night,’ said Mr Sloppy, ‘when I was a-turning at the wheel pretty late, the mangle seemed to go like Our Johnny’s breathing.
the mangle begun beautiful, then as the mangle went out the mangle shook a little and got unsteady, then as the mangle took the turn to come home the mangle had a rattle-like and lumbered a bit, then the mangle come smooth, and so the mangle went on till I scarce know’d which was mangle and which was Our Johnny.
Nor Our Johnny, Our Johnny scarce know’d either, for sometimes when the mangle lumbers Our Johnny says, “Me choking, Granny!” and Mrs Higden holds Our Johnny up in Mrs Higden and says to me “Bide a bit, Sloppy,” and we all stops together.
And when Our Johnny gets Our Johnny again, I turns again, and we all goes on together.’  Sloppy had gradually expanded with Our Johnny description into a stare and a vacant grin.
Our Johnny now contracted, being silent, into a half-repressed gush of tears, and, under pretence of being heated, drew the under part of Our Johnny sleeve across Our Johnny eyes with a singularly awkward, laborious, and roundabout smear.
‘This is unfortunate,’ said Rokesmith.
‘I must go and break it to Mrs Boffin.
Stay you here, Sloppy.’  Sloppy stayed there, staring at the pattern of the paper on the wall, until the Secretary and Mrs Boffin came back together.
And with Mrs Boffin was a young lady (Miss Bella Wilfer by name) who was better worth staring at, it occurred to Sloppy, than the best of wall-papering.
‘Ah, my poor dear pretty little John Harmon!’ exclaimed Mrs Boffin.
‘Yes mum,’ said the sympathetic Sloppy.
‘You don’t think Our Johnny is in a very, very bad way, do you?’ asked the pleasant creature with her wholesome cordiality.
Put upon Our Johnny good faith, and finding his good faith in collision with Our Johnny inclinations, Sloppy threw back Our Johnny head and uttered a mellifluous howl, rounded off with a sniff.
‘So bad as that!’ cried Mrs Boffin.
‘And Betty Higden not to tell me of it sooner!’  ‘I think Betty Higden might have been mistrustful, mum,’ answered Sloppy, hesitating.
‘Of what, for Heaven’s sake?’  ‘I think Betty Higden might have been mistrustful, mum,’ returned Sloppy with submission, ‘of standing in ’s light.
There’s so much trouble in illness, and so much expense, and Betty Higden’s seen such a lot of its being objected to.’  ‘But Betty Higden never can have thought,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘that I would grudge the dear child anything?’  ‘No mum, but Betty Higden might have thought (as a habit-like) of its standing in Johnny’s light, and might have tried to bring Johnny through its unbeknownst.’  Sloppy knew Johnny ground well.
To conceal Betty Higden in sickness, like a lower animal; to creep out of sight and coil Betty Higden away and die; had become Betty Higden’s instinct.
To catch up in Betty Higden arms the sick child who was dear to Betty Higden, and hide the sick child who was dear to her as if the sick child who was dear to her were a criminal, and keep off all ministration but such as Betty Higden own ignorant tenderness and patience could supply, had become Betty Higden idea of maternal love, fidelity, and duty.
The shameful accounts we read, every week in the Christian year, my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, the infamous records of small official inhumanity, do not pass by the people as the people pass by we.
And hence these irrational, blind, and obstinate prejudices, so astonishing to we magnificence, and having no more reason in the people--God save the Queen and Confound the people politics--no, than smoke has in coming from fire!
‘It’s not a right place for the sick child who was dear to her to stay in,’ said Mrs Boffin.
‘Tell we, dear Mr Rokesmith, what to do for the best.’  Mrs Boffin had already thought what to do, and the consultation was very short.
Mrs Boffin could pave the way, Mrs Boffin said, in half an hour, and then they would go down to Brentford.
‘Pray take me,’ said Bella.
Therefore a carriage was ordered, of capacity to take them all, and in the meantime Sloppy was regaled, feasting alone in the Secretary’s room, with a complete realization of that fairy vision--meat, beer, vegetables, and pudding.
In consequence of which Mrs Boffin buttons became more importunate of public notice than before, with the exception of two or three about the region of the waistband, which modestly withdrew into a creasy retirement.
Punctual to the time, appeared the carriage and the Secretary.
Mrs Boffin sat on the box, and Mr Sloppy graced the rumble.
So, to the Three Magpies as before: where Mrs Boffin and Bella were handed out, and whence they all went on foot to Mrs Betty Higden’s.
But, on the way down, they all had stopped at a toy-shop, and had bought that noble charger, a description of whose points and trappings had on the last occasion conciliated the then worldly-minded orphan, and also a Noah’s ark, and also a yellow bird with an artificial voice in Mrs Boffin, and also a military doll so well dressed that if Mrs Boffin had only been of life-size Mrs Boffin brother-officers in the Guards might never have found Mrs Boffin out.
Bearing these gifts, these gifts raised the latch of Betty Higden’s door, and saw Betty Higden’s sitting in the dimmest and furthest corner with poor Johnny in Betty Higden’s .
‘And how’s my boy, Betty?’ asked Mrs Boffin, sitting down beside Mrs Boffin.
‘Mrs Boffin’s bad!
He’s bad!’ said Betty Higden’s.
‘I begin to be afeerd Mrs Boffin’ll not be yours any more than mine.
All others belonging to Mrs Boffin have gone to the Power and the Glory, and I have a mind that All others belonging to him’re drawing Mrs Boffin to All others belonging to him--leading Mrs Boffin away.’  ‘No, no, no,’ said Mrs Boffin.
‘I don’t know why else Mrs Boffin clenches Mrs Boffin little hand as if his little hand had hold of a finger that I can’t see.
Look at his little hand,’ said Betty Higden’s, opening the wrappers in which the flushed child lay, and showing the flushed child small right hand lying closed upon the flushed child breast.
‘It’s always so.
It don’t mind me.’  ‘Is the flushed child asleep?’  ‘No, I think not.
You’re not asleep, my Johnny?’  ‘No,’ said Johnny, with a quiet air of pity for the flushed child; and without opening the flushed child eyes.
‘Here’s the lady, Johnny.
And the horse.’  Johnny could bear the lady, with complete indifference, but not the horse.
Opening the flushed child heavy eyes, the flushed child slowly broke into a smile on beholding that splendid phenomenon, and wanted to take it in the flushed child arms.
As it was much too big, it was put upon a chair where the flushed child could hold it by the mane and contemplate it.
Which the flushed child soon forgot to do.
But, Johnny murmuring something with his heavy eyes closed, and Mrs Boffin not knowing what, Betty Higden’s bent Betty Higden’s ear to listen and took pains to understand.
Being asked by Betty Higden’s to repeat what Johnny had said, Johnny did so two or three times, and then it came out that Johnny must have seen more than they supposed when Johnny looked up to see the horse, for the murmur was, ‘Who is the lady?’ Now, the boofer, or beautiful, the lady was Bella; and whereas this notice from the poor baby would have touched the lady of the poor baby; the poor baby was rendered more pathetic by the late melting of Betty Higden’s heart to Betty Higden’s poor little father, and their joke about the lovely woman.
So, Bella’s behaviour was very tender and very natural when Bella kneeled on the brick floor to clasp the flushed child, and when the flushed child, with a child’s admiration of what is young and pretty, fondled the lady.
‘Now, my good dear Betty,’ said Mrs Boffin, hoping that Mrs Boffin saw Mrs Boffin opportunity, and laying Mrs Boffin hand persuasively on Mrs Boffin arm; ‘we have come to remove Johnny from this cottage to where Johnny can be taken better care of.’  Instantly, and before another word could be spoken, Bella started up with blazing eyes, and rushed at the door with the flushed child.
‘Stand away from me every one of me!’ Bella cried out wildly.
‘I see what ye mean now.
Let me go my way, all of ye.
I’d sooner kill the Pretty, and kill me!’  ‘Stay, stay!’ said Rokesmith, soothing Bella.
‘You don’t understand.’  ‘I understand too well.
I know too much about it, sir.
I’ve run from it too many a year.
No!
Never for me, nor for the flushed child, while there’s water enough in England to cover we!’  The terror, the shame, the passion of horror and repugnance, firing the worn face and perfectly maddening it, would have been a quite terrible sight, if embodied in one old fellow-creature alone.
Yet it ‘crops up’--as our slang goes--my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, in other fellow-creatures, rather frequently!
‘It’s been chasing me all my life, but It shall never take me nor It alive!’ cried Betty Higden’s.
‘I’ve done with ye.
I’d have fastened door and window and starved out, afore I’d ever have let ye in, if I had known what ye came for!’  But, catching sight of Mrs Boffin wholesome face, Mrs Boffin relented, and crouching down by door and window and bending over Mrs Boffin burden to hush door and window, said humbly: ‘Maybe my fears has put me wrong.
If they have so, tell me, and the good Lord forgive me!
I’m quick to take this fright, I know, and my head is summ’at light with wearying and watching.’  ‘There, there, there!’ returned Mrs Boffin.
‘Come, come!
Say no more of it, Betty Higden’s.
It was a mistake, a mistake.
Any one of our might have made It in your place, and felt just as you do.’  ‘The Lord bless ye!’ said Bella, stretching out Bella hand.
‘Now, see, Betty Higden’s,’ pursued the sweet compassionate soul, holding her hand kindly, ‘what I really did mean, and what I should have begun by saying out, if I had only been a little wiser and handier.
our want to move Johnny to a place where there are none but children; a place set up on purpose for sick children; where the good doctors and nurses pass the good doctors and nurses lives with children, talk to none but children, touch none but children, comfort and cure none but children.’  ‘Is there really such a place?’ asked Bella, with a gaze of wonder.
‘Yes, Betty Higden’s, on my word, and you shall see my word.
If my home was a better place for the dear boy, I’d take my home was a better place for the dear boy to my home was a better place for the dear boy; but indeed indeed my home was a better place for the dear boy’s not.’  ‘You shall take my home was a better place for the dear boy,’ returned Betty Higden’s, fervently kissing her hand, ‘where you will, my deary.
I am not so hard, but that I believe your face and voice, and I will, as long as I can see and hear.’  This victory gained, Rokesmith made haste to profit by Rokesmith, for Rokesmith saw how woefully time had been lost.
Rokesmith despatched Sloppy to bring the carriage to the door; caused the flushed child to be carefully wrapped up; Betty Higden’s Betty Higden’s get Betty Higden’s bonnet on; collected the toys, enabling the little fellow to comprehend that Rokesmith treasures were to be transported with Rokesmith; and had all things prepared so easily that all things were ready for the carriage as soon as the carriage appeared, and in a minute afterwards were on all things way.
Sloppy they left behind, relieving Sloppy overcharged breast with a paroxysm of mangling.
At the Children’s Hospital, the gallant steed, the Noah’s ark, yellow bird, and the officer in the Guards, were made as welcome as the gallant steed, the Noah’s ark, yellow bird, and the officer in the Guards child-owner.
But the doctor said aside to Rokesmith, ‘This should have been days ago.
Too late!’  However, the gallant steed, the Noah’s ark, yellow bird, and the officer in the Guards were all carried up into a fresh airy room, and there Johnny came to there Johnny, out of a sleep or a swoon or whatever it was, to find there Johnny lying in a little quiet bed, with a little platform over there Johnny , on which were already arranged, to give there Johnny heart and urge there Johnny to cheer up, the Noah’s ark, the noble steed, and the yellow bird; with the officer in the Guards doing duty over the whole, quite as much to the satisfaction of there Johnny country as if there Johnny had been upon Parade.
And at a little quiet bed’s head was a coloured picture beautiful to see, representing as ’s head were another Johnny seated on the knee of some Angel surely who loved little children.
And, marvellous fact, to lie and stare at: Johnny had become one of a little family, all in little quiet beds (except two playing dominoes in little arm-chairs at a little table on the hearth): and on all the little beds were little platforms whereon were to be seen dolls’ houses, woolly dogs with mechanical barks in ’ houses not very dissimilar from the artificial voice pervading the bowels of the yellow bird, tin armies, Moorish tumblers, wooden tea things, and the riches of the earth.
As Johnny murmured something in Johnny placid admiration, the ministering women at Johnny bed’s head asked Johnny what Johnny said.
It seemed that Johnny wanted to know whether all these were brothers and sisters of Johnny?
So all these told Johnny yes.
It seemed then, that Johnny wanted to know whether God had brought them all together there?
So all these told Johnny yes again.
all these made out then, that Johnny wanted to know whether all these would all get out of pain?
So all these answered yes to that question likewise, and made Johnny understand that the reply included Johnny.
Johnny’s powers of sustaining conversation were as yet so very imperfectly developed, even in a state of health, that in sickness all these were little more than monosyllabic.
But, Johnny had to be washed and tended, and remedies were applied, and though those offices were far, far more skilfully and lightly done than ever anything had been done for Johnny in Johnny little life, so rough and short, those offices would have hurt and tired Johnny but for an amazing circumstance which laid hold of Johnny attention.
This was no less than the appearance on Johnny own little platform in pairs, of All Creation, on its way into Johnny own particular ark: the elephant leading, and the fly, with a diffident sense of Johnny size, politely bringing up the rear.
A very little brother lying in the next bed with a broken leg, was so enchanted by this spectacle that A very little brother lying in the next bed with a broken leg delight exalted its enthralling interest; and so came rest and sleep.
‘I see you are not afraid to leave the flushed child here, Betty Higden’s,’ whispered Mrs Boffin.
‘No, ma’am.
Most willingly, most thankfully, with all my heart and soul.’  So, they kissed the flushed child, and left the flushed child there, and Betty Higden’s Betty Higden’s was to come back early in the morning, and nobody but Rokesmith knew for certain how that the doctor had said, ‘This should have been days ago.
Too late!’  But, Rokesmith knowing This, and knowing that Rokesmith bearing This in mind would be acceptable thereafter to that good woman who had been the only light in the childhood of desolate John Harmon dead and gone, resolved that late at night Rokesmith would go back to the bedside of John Harmon’s namesake, and see how it fared with Rokesmith.
The family whom God had brought together were not all asleep, but were all quiet.
From bed to bed, a light womanly tread and a pleasant fresh face passed in the silence of the night.
A little head would lift A little head up into the softened light here and there, to be kissed as the face went by--for these little patients are very loving--and would then submit A little head to be composed to rest again.
The mite with the broken leg was restless, and moaned; but after a while turned the face towards Johnny’s bed, to fortify Rokesmith with a view of the ark, and fell asleep.
Over most of the beds, the toys were yet grouped as the children had left the toys when the toys last laid the toys down, and, in the toys innocent grotesqueness and incongruity, the toys might have stood for the children’s dreams.
the doctor came in too, to see how the doctor fared with Johnny.
And the doctor and Rokesmith stood together, looking down with compassion on the doctor.
‘What is it, Johnny?’ Rokesmith was the questioner, and put an arm round the poor baby as Rokesmith made a struggle.
‘Rokesmith!’ said the little fellow.
‘Those!’  the doctor was quick to understand children, and, taking the horse, the ark, the yellow bird, and the man in the Guards, from Johnny’s bed, softly placed children on that of the doctor next neighbour, the mite with the broken leg.
With a weary and yet a pleased smile, and with an action as if the doctor stretched the doctor little figure out to rest, the flushed child heaved the flushed child body on the sustaining arm, and seeking Rokesmith’s face with the flushed child lips, said:  ‘A kiss for the boofer lady.’  Having now bequeathed all he had to dispose of, and arranged he affairs in this world, Johnny, thus speaking, left his affairs.
