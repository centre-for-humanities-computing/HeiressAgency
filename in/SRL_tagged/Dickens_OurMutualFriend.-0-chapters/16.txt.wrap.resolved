 MINDERS AND RE-MINDERS   The Secretary lost no time in getting to work, and The Secretary vigilance and method soon set his vigilance and method mark on the Golden Dustman’s affairs. The Secretary earnestness in determining to understand the length and breadth and depth of every piece of work submitted to The Secretary by The Secretary employer, was as special as The Secretary despatch in transacting it. The Secretary accepted no information or explanation at second hand, but made The Secretary the master of everything confided to The Secretary.  One part of the Secretary’s conduct, underlying all the rest, might have been mistrusted by a man with a better knowledge of men than the Golden Dustman had. The Secretary was as far from being inquisitive or intrusive as The Secretary could be, but nothing less than a complete understanding of the whole of the Golden Dustman’s affairs would content The Secretary. the Golden Dustman’s affairs soon became apparent (from the knowledge with which The Secretary set out) that The Secretary must have been to the office where the Harmon will was registered, and must have read the will. The Secretary anticipated Mr Boffin’s consideration whether The Secretary should be advised with on this or that topic, by showing that The Secretary already knew of it and understood it. The Secretary did this with no attempt at concealment, seeming to be satisfied that this was part of The Secretary duty to have prepared The Secretary at all attainable points for this utmost discharge.  This might--let it be repeated--have awakened some little vague mistrust in a man more worldly-wise than the Golden Dustman. On the other hand, The Secretary was discerning, discreet, and silent, though as zealous as if the Golden Dustman’s affairs had been the Golden Dustman’s affairs own. the Golden Dustman’s affairs showed no love of patronage or the command of money, but distinctly preferred resigning both to Mr Boffin. If, in the Golden Dustman’s affairs limited sphere, the Golden Dustman’s affairs sought power, it was the power of knowledge; the power derivable from a perfect comprehension of the Golden Dustman’s affairs business.  As on The Secretary’s face there was a nameless cloud, so on the Golden Dustman’s affairs manner there was a shadow equally indefinable. It was not that the Golden Dustman’s affairs was embarrassed, as on that first night with the Wilfer family; the Golden Dustman’s affairs was habitually unembarrassed now, and yet the something remained. It was not that the Golden Dustman’s affairs manner was bad, as on that occasion; his manner was now very good, as being modest, gracious, and ready. Yet the something never left the something. the something has been written of men who have undergone a cruel captivity, or who have passed through a terrible strait, or who in self-preservation have killed a defenceless fellow-creature, that the record thereof has never faded from their countenances until their died. Was there any such record here?  He established a temporary office for He in the new house, and all went well under He hand, with one singular exception. He manifestly objected to communicate with Mr Boffin’s solicitor. Two or three times, when there was some slight occasion for He doing so, He transferred the task to Mr Boffin’s; and He evasion of it soon became so curiously apparent, that Mr Boffin’s spoke to He on the subject of He reluctance.  ‘It is so,’ the Secretary admitted. ‘I would rather not.’  Had Mr Boffin’s any personal objection to Mr Lightwood?  ‘I don’t know Mr Boffin’s.’  Had Mr Boffin’s suffered from law-suits?  ‘Not more than other men,’ was Mr Boffin’s short answer.  Was Mr Boffin’s prejudiced against the race of lawyers?  ‘No. But while I am in your employment, Mr Boffin’s, I would rather be excused from going between the lawyer and the client. Of course if you press it, Mr Boffin’s, I am ready to comply. But I should take it as a great favour if you would not press it without urgent occasion.’  Now, it could not be said that there WAS urgent occasion, for Lightwood retained no other affairs in Mr Boffin’s hands than such as still lingered and languished about the undiscovered criminal, and such as arose out of the purchase of the house. Many other matters that might have travelled to Mr Boffin’s, now stopped short at the Secretary, under whose administration whose administration were far more expeditiously and satisfactorily disposed of than whose administration would have been if whose administration had got into Young Blight’s domain. This the Golden Dustman quite understood. Even the matter immediately in hand was of very little moment as requiring personal appearance on the Secretary’s part, for This the Golden Dustman amounted to no more than this:--The death of Hexam rendering the sweat of the honest man’s brow unprofitable, the honest man’s brow unprofitable had shufflingly declined to moisten the honest man’s brow unprofitable brow for nothing, with that severe exertion which is known in legal circles as swearing your way through a stone wall. Consequently, that new light had gone sputtering out. But, the airing of the old facts had led some one concerned to suggest that it would be well before they were reconsigned to they gloomy shelf--now probably for ever--to induce or compel that Mr Julius Handford to reappear and be questioned. And all traces of Mr Julius Handford being lost, Lightwood now referred to Mr Julius Handford client for authority to seek Mr Julius Handford through public advertisement.  ‘Does your objection go to writing to Lightwood, Rokesmith?’  ‘Not in the least, sir.’  ‘Then perhaps you’ll write Mr Julius Handford a line, and say Mr Julius Handford is free to do what Mr Julius Handford likes. I don’t think it promises.’  ‘I don’t think it promises,’ said the Secretary.  ‘Still, Mr Julius Handford may do what Mr Julius Handford likes.’  ‘I will write immediately. Let me thank you for so considerately yielding to my disinclination. It may seem less unreasonable, if I avow to you that although I don’t know Mr Lightwood, I have a disagreeable association connected with Mr Lightwood. It is not Mr Lightwood fault; Mr Lightwood is not at all to blame for his fault, and does not even know my name.’  Mr Boffin dismissed the matter with a nod or two. The letter was written, and next day Mr Julius Handford was advertised for. Mr Julius Handford was requested to place Mr Julius Handford in communication with Mr Lightwood, as a possible means of furthering the ends of justice, and a reward was offered to any one acquainted with Mr Julius Handford whereabout who would communicate the same to the said Mr Lightwood at Mr Lightwood office in the Temple. Every day for six weeks this advertisement appeared at the head of all the newspapers, and every day for six weeks the Secretary, when Mr Julius Handford saw this advertisement, said to Mr Julius Handford; in the tone in which Mr Julius Handford had said to Mr Julius Handford employer,--‘I don’t think his employer,--‘I promises!’  Among Mr Julius Handford first occupations the pursuit of that orphan wanted by Mr Boffin held a conspicuous place. From the earliest moment of Mr Julius Handford engagement Mr Julius Handford showed a particular desire to please his engagement, and, knowing his engagement to have this object at heart, Mr Julius Handford followed this object up with unwearying alacrity and interest.  Mr and Mrs Milvey had found Mr and Mrs Milvey search a difficult one. Either an eligible orphan was of the wrong sex (which almost always happened) or was too old, or too young, or too sickly, or too dirty, or too much accustomed to the streets, or too likely to run away; or, an eligible orphan was found impossible to complete the philanthropic transaction without buying an eligible orphan. For, the instant an eligible orphan became known that anybody wanted an eligible orphan, up started some affectionate relative of the orphan who put a price upon the orphan’s head. The suddenness of an orphan’s rise in the market was not to be paralleled by the maddest records of the Stock Exchange. He would be at five thousand per cent discount out at nurse making a mud pie at nine in the morning, and (being inquired for) would go up to five thousand per cent premium before noon. the market was ‘rigged’ in various artful ways. Counterfeit stock got into circulation. Parents boldly represented Parents as dead, and brought Parents orphans with Parents. Genuine orphan-stock was surreptitiously withdrawn from the market. Genuine orphan-stock being announced, by emissaries posted for the purpose, that Mr and Mrs Milvey were coming down the court, orphan scrip would be instantly concealed, and production refused, save on a condition usually stated by the brokers as ‘a gallon of beer’. Likewise, fluctuations of a wild and South-Sea nature were occasioned, by orphan-holders keeping back, and then rushing into the market a dozen together. But, the uniform principle at the root of all these various operations was bargain and sale; and that principle could not be recognized by Mr and Mrs MilveyMrs Milvey.  At length, tidings were received by the Reverend Frank of a charming orphan to be found at Brentford. One of the deceased parents (late his parishioners) had a poor widowed grandmother in that agreeable town, and a poor widowed grandmother, Mrs Betty Higden, had carried off a charming orphan to be found at Brentford with maternal care, but could not afford to keep his.  The Secretary proposed to Mrs Boffin, either to go down The Secretary and take a preliminary survey of a charming orphan to be found at Brentford, or to drive Mrs Boffin down, that Mrs Boffin might at once form Mrs Boffin own opinion. Mrs Boffin preferring the latter course, they set off one morning in a hired phaeton, conveying the hammer-headed young man behind they.  The abode of Mrs Betty Higden was not easy to find, lying in such complicated back settlements of muddy Brentford that they left they equipage at the sign of the Three Magpies, and went in search of The abode of Mrs Betty Higden on foot. After many inquiries and defeats, there was pointed out to many inquiries and defeats in a lane, a very small cottage residence, with a board across the open doorway, hooked on to which board by the armpits was a young gentleman of tender years, angling for mud with a headless wooden horse and line. In this young sportsman, distinguished by a crisply curling auburn head and a bluff countenance, The Secretary descried a charming orphan to be found at Brentford.  It unfortunately happened as they quickened they pace, that the orphan, lost to considerations of personal safety in the ardour of the moment, overbalanced himself and toppled into the street. Being an orphan of a chubby conformation, himself then took to rolling, and had rolled into the gutter before they could come up. From the gutter himself was rescued by John Rokesmith, and thus the first meeting with Mrs Betty Higden was inaugurated by the awkward circumstance of they being in possession--one would say at first sight unlawful possession--of an eligible orphan, upside down and purple in the countenance. The board across the doorway too, acting as a trap equally for the feet of Mrs Betty Higden coming out, and the feet of Mrs Boffin and John Rokesmith going in, greatly increased the difficulty of the situation: to which the cries of an eligible orphan imparted a lugubrious and inhuman character.  At first, it was impossible to explain, on account of the orphan’s ‘holding his breath’: a most terrific proceeding, super-inducing in the orphan lead-colour rigidity and a deadly silence, compared with which his cries were music yielding the height of enjoyment. But as his gradually recovered, Mrs Boffin gradually introduced Mrs Boffin; and smiling peace was gradually wooed back to Mrs Betty Higden’s home.  It was then perceived to be a small home with a large mangle in It, at the handle of which machine stood a very long boy, with a very little head, and an open mouth of disproportionate capacity that seemed to assist his eyes in staring at the visitors. In a corner below the mangle, on a couple of stools, sat two very little children: a boy and a girl; and when the very long boy, in an interval of staring, took a turn at the mangle, it was alarming to see how it lunged it at those two innocents, like a catapult designed for those two innocents destruction, harmlessly retiring when within an inch of those two innocents heads. The room was clean and neat. The room had a brick floor, and a window of diamond panes, and a flounce hanging below the chimney-piece, and strings nailed from bottom to top outside the window on which scarlet-beans were to grow in the coming season if the Fates were propitious. However propitious the Fates might have been in the seasons that were gone, to Mrs Betty Higden in the matter of beans, the Fates had not been very favourable in the matter of coins; for it was easy to see that Mrs Betty Higden was poor.  Mrs Betty Higden was one of those old women, was Mrs Betty Higden, who by dint of an indomitable purpose and a strong constitution fight out many years, though each year has come with each year new knock-down blows fresh to the fight against Mrs Betty Higden, wearied by each year; an active old woman, with a bright dark eye and a resolute face, yet quite a tender creature too; not a logically-reasoning woman, but God is good, and hearts may count in Heaven as high as heads.  ‘Yes sure!’ said Mrs Betty Higden, when the business was opened, ‘Mrs Milvey had the kindness to write to me, ma’am, and I got Sloppy to read it. it was a pretty letter. But Mrs Betty Higden’s an affable lady.’  The visitors glanced at the long boy, who seemed to indicate by a broader stare of his mouth and eyes that in his Sloppy stood confessed.  ‘For I aint, you must know,’ said Betty, ‘much of a hand at reading writing-hand, though I can read my Bible and most print. And I do love a newspaper. You mightn’t think it, but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of a newspaper. He do the Police in different voices.’  The visitors again considered it a point of politeness to look at Sloppy, who, looking at The visitors, suddenly threw back his head, extended his mouth to his mouth utmost width, and laughed loud and long. At this the two innocents, with the two innocents brains in that apparent danger, laughed, and Mrs Betty Higden laughed, and an eligible orphan laughed, and then The visitors laughed. Which was more cheerful than intelligible.  Then Sloppy seeming to be seized with an industrious mania or fury, turned to at the mangle, and impelled the mangle at the heads of the innocents with such a creaking and rumbling, that Mrs Betty Higden stopped Mrs Betty Higden.  ‘The gentlefolks can’t hear themselves speak, Sloppy. Bide a bit, bide a bit!’  ‘Is that the dear child in your lap?’ said Mrs Boffin.  ‘Yes, ma’am, this is Johnny.’  ‘Johnny, too!’ cried Mrs Boffin, turning to The Secretary; ‘already Johnny! Only one of the two names left to give Mrs Boffin! Mrs Boffin’s a pretty boy.’  With Mrs Boffin chin tucked down in Mrs Boffin shy childish manner, Mrs Boffin was looking furtively at Mrs Boffin out of Mrs Boffin blue eyes, and reaching Mrs Boffin fat dimpled hand up to the lips of the old woman, who was kissing it by times.  ‘Yes, ma’am, Mrs Boffin’s a pretty boy, Mrs Boffin’s a dear darling boy, Mrs Boffin’s the child of my own last left daughter’s daughter. But last left daughter’s daughter gone the way of all the rest.’  ‘Those are not his brother and sister?’ said Mrs Boffin.  ‘Oh, dear no, ma’am. Those are Minders.’  ‘Minders?’ The Secretary repeated.  ‘Left to be Minded, sir. I keep a Minding-School. I can take only three, on account of the mangle. But I love children, and Four-pence a week is Four-pence. Come here, Toddles and Poddles.’  Toddles was the pet-name of the boy; Poddles of the girl. At their little unsteady pace, their came across a brick floor, hand-in-hand, as if their were traversing an extremely difficult road intersected by brooks, and, when their had had their heads patted by Mrs Betty Higden, made lunges at the orphan, dramatically representing an attempt to bear Mrs Betty Higden, crowing, into captivity and slavery. All the three children enjoyed this to a delightful extent, and the sympathetic Sloppy again laughed long and loud. When it was discreet to stop the play, Mrs Betty Higden said ‘Go to your seats Toddles and Poddles,’ and All the three children returned hand-in-hand across country, seeming to find brooks rather swollen by late rains.  ‘And Master--or Mister--Sloppy?’ said the Secretary, in doubt whether he was man, boy, or what.  ‘A love-child,’ returned Mrs Betty Higden, dropping Mrs Betty Higden voice; ‘parents never known; found in the street. he was brought up in the--’ with a shiver of repugnance, ‘--the House.’  ‘--the House?’ said The Secretary.  Mrs Betty Higden set that resolute old face of hers, and darkly nodded yes.  ‘You dislike the mention of it.’  ‘Dislike the mention of itit?’ answered Mrs Betty Higden. ‘Kill me sooner than take me there. Throw A love-child under cart-horses feet and a loaded waggon, sooner than take A love-child there. Come to us and find us all a-dying, and set a light to us all where us lie and let us all blaze away with --the House into a heap of cinders sooner than move a corpse of us there!’  A surprising spirit in Mrs Betty Higden after so many years of hard working, and hard living, my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards! What is it that we call it in we grandiose speeches? British independence, rather perverted? Is that, or something like British independence, the ring of the cant?  ‘Do I never read in the newspapers,’ said the dame, fondling the child--‘God help me and the like of me!--how the worn-out people that do come down to that, get driven from post to pillar and pillar to post, a-purpose to tire them out! Do I never read how them are put off, put off, put off--how them are grudged, grudged, grudged, the shelter, or the doctor, or the drop of physic, or the bit of bread? Do I never read how them grow heartsick of it and give it up, after having let them drop so low, and how them after all die out for want of help? Then I say, I hope I can die as well as another, and I’ll die without that disgrace.’  Absolutely impossible my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards, by any stretch of legislative wisdom to set these perverse people right in these perverse people logic?  ‘Johnny, my pretty,’ continued old Betty, caressing A love-child, and rather mourning over A love-child than speaking to A love-child, ‘Mrs Betty is nigher fourscore year than threescore and ten. Mrs Betty never begged nor had a penny of the Union money in all Mrs Betty life. Mrs Betty paid scot and Mrs Betty paid lot when Mrs Betty had money to pay; Mrs Betty worked when Mrs Betty could, and Mrs Betty starved when Mrs Betty must. You pray that your Granny may have strength enough left Mrs Betty at the last (Mrs Betty’s strong for an old one, Johnny), to get up from Mrs Betty bed and run and hide Mrs Betty and swown to death in a hole, sooner than fall into the hands of those Cruel Jacks we read of that dodge and drive, and worry and weary, and scorn and shame, the decent poor.’  A brilliant success, my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards to have brought A brilliant success, my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards to this in the minds of the best of the poor! Under submission, might it be worth thinking of at any odd time?  The fright and abhorrence that Mrs Betty Higden smoothed out of Mrs Betty Higden strong face as Mrs Betty Higden ended this diversion, showed how seriously Mrs Betty Higden had meant this diversion.  ‘And does he work for you?’ asked The Secretary, gently bringing the discourse back to Master or Mister Sloppy.  ‘Yes,’ said Betty with a good-humoured smile and nod of the head. ‘And well too.’  ‘Does he live here?’  ‘he lives more here than anywhere. he was thought to be no better than a Natural, and first come to me as a Minder. I made interest with Mr Blogg the Beadle to have he as a Mindera Minder, seeing he by chance up at church, and thinking I might do something with he. For he was a weak ricketty creetur then.’  ‘Is he called by he right name?’  ‘Why, you see, speaking quite correctly, he has no right name. I always understood he took his right name from being found on a Sloppy night.’  ‘he seems an amiable fellow.’  ‘Bless you, sir, there’s not a bit of he,’ returned Betty, ‘that’s not amiable. So you may judge how amiable he is, by running your eye along he heighth.’  Of an ungainly make was Sloppy. Too much of he longwise, too little of he broadwise, and too many sharp angles of he angle-wise. One of those shambling male human creatures, born to be indiscreetly candid in the revelation of buttons; every button he had about he glaring at the public to a quite preternatural extent. A considerable capital of knee and elbow and wrist and ankle, had Sloppy, and he didn’t know how to dispose of it to the best advantage, but was always investing it in wrong securities, and so getting he into embarrassed circumstances. Full-Private Number One in the Awkward Squad of the rank and file of life, was Sloppy, and yet had he glimmering notions of standing true to the Colours.  ‘And now,’ said Mrs Boffin, ‘concerning Johnny.’  As Johnny, with Johnny chin tucked in and lips pouting, reclined in Betty’s lap, concentrating his blue eyes on the visitors and shading the visitors from observation with a dimpled arm, old Betty took one of old Betty fresh fat hands in old Betty withered right, and fell to gently beating her withered right on old Betty withered left.  ‘Yes, ma’am. Concerning Johnny.’  ‘If you trust the dear child to me,’ said Mrs Boffin, with a face inviting trust, ‘he shall have the best of homes, the best of care, the best of education, the best of friends. Please God I will be a true good mother to God!’  ‘I am thankful to you, ma’am, and the dear child would be thankful if the dear child was old enough to understand.’ Still lightly beating the little hand upon her own. ‘I wouldn’t stand in the dear child, not if I had all my life before me instead of a very little of all my life. But I hope you won’t take it ill that I cleave to the dear child closer than words can tell, for the dear child’s the last living thing left me.’  ‘Take it ill, my dear soul? Is it likely? And you so tender of the dear child as to bring the dear child home here!’  ‘I have seen,’ said old Betty, still with that light beat upon old Betty hard rough hand, ‘so many of still on my lap. And still are all gone but this one! I am ashamed to seem so selfish, but I don’t really mean it. It’ll be the making of the dear child fortune, and the dear child’ll be a gentleman when I am dead. I--I--don’t know what comes over me. I--try against it. Don’t notice me!’ The light beat stopped, the resolute mouth gave way, and the fine strong old face broke up into weakness and tears.  Now, greatly to the relief of the visitors, the emotional Sloppy no sooner beheld his patroness in this condition, than, throwing back his head and throwing open his , his lifted up his voice and bellowed. This alarming note of something wrong instantly terrified Toddles and Poddles, who were no sooner heard to roar surprisingly, than Johnny, curving his the wrong way and striking out at Mrs Boffin with a pair of indifferent shoes, became a prey to despair. The absurdity of the situation put The absurdity of the situation pathos to the rout. Mrs Betty Higden was Mrs Betty Higden in a moment, and brought them all to order with that speed, that Sloppy, stopping short in a polysyllabic bellow, transferred Mrs Betty Higden energy to the mangle, and had taken several penitential turns before Mrs Betty Higden could be stopped.  ‘There, there, there!’ said Mrs Boffin, almost regarding Mrs Boffin kind self as the most ruthless of women. ‘Nothing is going to be done. Nobody need be frightened. We’re all comfortable; ain’t We, Mrs Betty Higden?’  ‘Sure and certain We are,’ returned old Betty.  ‘And there really is no hurry, you know,’ said Mrs Boffin in a lower voice. ‘Take time to think of time, my good creature!’  ‘Don’t you fear ME no more, ma’am,’ said old Betty; ‘I thought of time for good yesterday. I don’t know what come over ME just now, but time’ll never come again.’  ‘Well, then, Johnny shall have more time to think of it,’ returned Mrs Boffin; ‘the pretty child shall have time to get used to it. And you’ll get the pretty child more used to it, if you think well of it; won’t you?’  old Betty undertook that, cheerfully and readily.  ‘Lor,’ cried Mrs Boffin, looking radiantly about old Betty, ‘we want to make everybody happy, not dismal!--And perhaps you wouldn’t mind letting me know how used to it you begin to get, and how it all goes on?’  ‘I’ll send Sloppy,’ said Mrs Betty Higden.  ‘And this gentleman who has come with ME will pay this gentleman who has come with me for this gentleman who has come with me trouble,’ said Mrs Boffin. ‘And Mr Sloppy, whenever you come to my house, be sure you never go away without having had a good dinner of meat, beer, vegetables, and pudding.’  This still further brightened the face of affairs; for, the highly sympathetic Sloppy, first broadly staring and grinning, and then roaring with laughter, Toddles and Poddles followed suit, and Johnny trumped the trick. T and P considering these favourable circumstances for the resumption of that dramatic descent upon Johnny, again came across-country hand-in-hand upon a buccaneering expedition; and this having been fought out in the chimney corner behind Mrs Higden’s chair, with great valour on both sides, those desperate pirates returned hand-in-hand to those desperate pirates stools, across the dry bed of a mountain torrent.  ‘You must tell me what I can do for you, old Betty my friend,’ said Mrs Boffin confidentially, ‘if not to-day, next time.’  ‘Thank you all the same, ma’am, but I want nothing for Betty my friend. I can work. I’m strong. I can walk twenty mile if I’m put to it.’ old Betty was proud, and said it with a sparkle in old Betty bright eyes.  ‘Yes, but there are some little comforts that you wouldn’t be the worse for,’ returned Mrs Boffin. ‘Bless ye, I wasn’t born a lady any more than you.’  ‘It seems to Betty my friend,’ said old Betty, smiling, ‘that you were born a lady, and a true one, or there never was a lady born. But I couldn’t take anything from you, my dear. I never did take anything from any one. It ain’t that I’m not grateful, but I love to earn It better.’  ‘Well, well!’ returned Mrs Boffin. ‘I only spoke of little things, or I wouldn’t have taken the liberty.’  old Betty put old Betty visitor’s hand to old Betty lips, in acknowledgment of the delicate answer. Wonderfully upright old Betty figure was, and wonderfully self-reliant old Betty look, as, standing facing her visitor, old Betty explained old Betty further.  ‘If I could have kept the dear child, without the dread that’s always upon me of the dear child coming to that fate I have spoken of, I could never have parted with the dear child, even to you. For I love the dear child, I love the dear child, I love the dear child! I love my husband long dead and gone, in my husband; I love my children dead and gone, in my husband; I love my young and hopeful days dead and gone, in my husband. I couldn’t sell that love, and look you in your bright kind face. that love’s a free gift. I am in want of nothing. When my strength fails me, if I can but die out quick and quiet, I shall be quite content. I have stood between my dead and that shame I have spoken of; and my dead has been kept off from every one of my dead. Sewed into my gown,’ with old Betty hand upon old Betty breast, ‘is just enough to lay me in the grave. Only see that it’s rightly spent, so as I may rest free to the last from that cruelty and disgrace, and you’ll have done much more than a little thing for me, and all that in this present world my heart is set upon.’  Mrs Betty Higden’s visitor pressed Mrs Betty Higden’s . There was no more breaking up of the strong old face into weakness. My Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards, it really was as composed as our own faces, and almost as dignified.  And now, Johnny was to be inveigled into occupying a temporary position on Mrs Boffin’s lap. It was not until Johnny had been piqued into competition with the two diminutive Minders, by seeing the two diminutive Minders successively raised to that post and retire from that post without injury, that Johnny could be by any means induced to leave Mrs Betty Higden’s skirts; towards which Johnny exhibited, even when in Mrs Boffin embrace, strong yearnings, spiritual and bodily; the former expressed in a very gloomy visage, the latter in extended arms. However, a general description of the toy-wonders lurking in Mrs Boffin house, so far conciliated this worldly-minded orphan as to induce Johnny to stare at this worldly-minded orphan frowningly, with a fist in Johnny mouth, and even at length to chuckle when a richly-caparisoned horse on wheels, with a miraculous gift of cantering to cake-shops, was mentioned. This sound being taken up by the Minders, swelled into a rapturous trio which gave general satisfaction.  So, the interview was considered very successful, and Mrs Boffin was pleased, and all were satisfied. Not least of all, Sloppy, who undertook to conduct the visitors back by the best way to the Three Magpies, and whom the hammer-headed young man much despised.  This piece of business thus put in train, the Secretary drove Mrs Boffin back to the Bower, and found employment for the Secretary at the new house until evening. Whether, when evening came, the Secretary took a way to the Secretary lodgings that led through fields, with any design of finding Miss Bella Wilfer in those fields, is not so certain as that Bella Wilfer regularly walked there at that hour.  And, moreover, it is certain that there Bella Wilfer was.  No longer in mourning, Bella Wilfer Bella Wilfer was dressed in as pretty colours as Bella Wilfer could muster. There is no denying that Bella Wilfer was as pretty as they, and that Bella Wilfer and the colours went very prettily together. Bella Wilfer was reading as Bella Wilfer walked, and of course it is to be inferred, from Bella Wilfer showing no knowledge of Mr Rokesmith’s approach, that Bella Wilfer did not know Mr Rokesmith was approaching.  ‘Eh?’ said Bella Wilfer, raising Bella Wilfer eyes from Bella Wilfer book, when Mr Rokesmith stopped before Bella Wilfer. ‘Oh! It’s you.’  ‘Only I. A fine evening!’  ‘Is it?’ said Bella Wilfer, looking coldly round. ‘I suppose it is, now you mention it. I have not been thinking of the evening.’  ‘So intent upon her book?’  ‘Ye-e-es,’ replied Bella, with a drawl of indifference.  ‘A love story, Miss Wilfer?’  ‘Oh dear no, or I shouldn’t be reading it. it’s more about money than anything else.’  ‘And does it say that money is better than anything?’  ‘Upon my word,’ returned Bella Wilfer, ‘I forget what it says, but you can find out for yourself if you like, Mr Rokesmith. I don’t want it any more.’  the Secretary took her book--the Secretary had fluttered the leaves as if her book were a fan--and walked beside the Secretary.  ‘I am charged with a message for you, Miss Wilfer.’  ‘Impossible, I think!’ said Bella, with another drawl.  ‘From Mrs Boffin. the Secretary desired me to assure you of the pleasure the Secretary has in finding that the Secretary will be ready to receive you in another week or two at furthest.’  Bella Wilfer turned Bella Wilfer head towards him, with Bella Wilfer prettily-insolent eyebrows raised, and Bella Wilfer eyelids drooping. As much as to say, ‘How did YOU come by the message, pray?’  ‘I have been waiting for an opportunity of telling you that I am Mrs Boffin Secretary.’  ‘I am as wise as ever,’ said Miss Bella, loftily, ‘for I don’t know what a Secretary is. Not that it signifies.’  ‘Not at all.’  A covert glance at Bella Wilfer face, as he walked beside Bella Wilfer, showed he that Bella Wilfer had not expected he ready assent to that proposition.  ‘Then are you going to be always there, Mr Rokesmith?’ Bella Wilfer inquired, as if that would be a drawback.  ‘Always? No. Very much there? Yes.’  ‘Dear me!’ drawled Bella Wilfer, in a tone of mortification.  ‘But my position there as Secretary, will be very different from yours as guest. You will know little or nothing about yours. I shall transact the business: you will transact the pleasure. I shall have my salary to earn; you will have nothing to do but to enjoy and attract.’  ‘Attract, sir?’ said Bella Wilfer, again with Bella Wilfer eyebrows raised, and Bella Wilfer eyelids drooping. ‘I don’t understand you.’  Without replying on this point, Mr Rokesmith went on.  ‘Excuse me; when I first saw you in your black dress--’  [‘There!’ was Miss Bella Wilfer’s mental exclamation. ‘What did I say to them at home? Everybody noticed that ridiculous mourning.’)  ‘When I first saw you in your black dress, I was at a loss to account for that distinction between yourself and your family. I hope it was not impertinent to speculate upon it?’  ‘I hope not, I am sure,’ said Miss Bella, haughtily. ‘But you ought to know best how you speculated upon it.’  Mr Rokesmith inclined Mr Rokesmith head in a deprecatory manner, and went on.  ‘Since I have been entrusted with Mrs Boffin affairs, I have necessarily come to understand the little mystery. I venture to remark that I feel persuaded that much of your loss may be repaired. I speak, of course, merely of wealth, Miss Wilfer. The loss of a perfect stranger, whose worth, or worthlessness, I cannot estimate--nor you either--is beside the question. But this excellent gentleman and lady are so full of simplicity, so full of generosity, so inclined towards you, and so desirous to--how shall I express it?--to make amends for this excellent gentleman and lady good fortune, that you have only to respond.’  As he watched her with another covert look, he saw a certain ambitious triumph in her face which no assumed coldness could conceal.  ‘As we have been brought under one roof by an accidental combination of circumstances, which oddly extends itself to the new relations before we, I have taken the liberty of saying these few words. You don’t consider these few words intrusive I hope?’ said the Secretary with deference.  ‘Really, Mr Rokesmith, I can’t say what I consider these few words,’ returned lady. ‘these few words are perfectly new to Mr Rokesmith, and may be founded altogether on your own imagination.’  ‘You will see.’  These same fields were opposite the Wilfer premises. The discreet Mrs Wilfer now looking out of window and beholding Mrs Wilfer daughter in conference with Mrs Wilfer lodger, instantly tied up Mrs Wilfer head and came out for a casual walk.  ‘I have been telling Miss Wilfer,’ said John Rokesmith, as the majestic lady came stalking up, ‘that I have become, by a curious chance, Mrs Boffin Secretary or man of business.’  ‘I have not,’ returned Mrs Wilfer, waving Mrs Wilfer gloves in Mrs Wilfer chronic state of dignity, and vague ill-usage, ‘the honour of any intimate acquaintance with Mrs Boffin, and it is not for me to congratulate that gentleman on the acquisition Mrs Boffin has made.’  ‘A poor one enough,’ said John Rokesmith.  ‘Pardon me,’ returned Miss Wilfer, ‘the merits of Mrs Boffin may be highly distinguished--may be more distinguished than the countenance of Mrs Boffin would imply--but the merits of Mr Boffin were the insanity of humility to deem Mrs Boffin worthy of a better assistant.’  ‘You are very good. I have also been telling Miss Wilfer that Miss Wilfer is expected very shortly at the new residence in town.’  ‘Having tacitly consented,’ said Miss Wilfer, with a grand shrug of Miss Wilfer shoulders, and another wave of Miss Wilfer gloves, ‘to my child’s acceptance of the proffered attentions of Mrs Boffin, I interpose no objection.’  Here Bella Wilfer Bella Wilfer offered the remonstrance: ‘Don’t talk nonsense, ma, please.’  ‘Peace!’ said Miss Wilfer.  ‘No, ma, I am not going to be made so absurd. Interposing objections!’  ‘I say,’ repeated Miss Wilfer, with a vast access of grandeur, ‘that I am NOT going to interpose objections. If Mrs Boffin (to whose countenance no disciple of Lavater could possibly for a single moment subscribe),’ with a shiver, ‘seeks to illuminate Bella Wilfer new residence in town with the attractions of a child of mine, I am content that Bella Wilfer should be favoured by the company of a child of mine.’  ‘You use the word, ma’am, I have myself used,’ said Rokesmith, with a glance at Bella Wilfer, ‘when you speak of Miss Wilfer’s attractions there.’  ‘Pardon me,’ returned Miss Wilfer, with dreadful solemnity, ‘but I had not finished.’  ‘Pray excuse me.’  ‘I was about to say,’ pursued Mrs Wilfer, who clearly had not had the faintest idea of saying anything more: ‘that when I use the term attractions, I do so with the qualification that I do not mean it in any way whatever.’  the majestic lady delivered this luminous elucidation of the majestic lady views with an air of greatly obliging the majestic lady hearers, and greatly distinguishing the majestic lady. Bella Wilfer Bella Wilfer laughed a scornful little laugh and said:  ‘Quite enough about this, I am sure, on all sides. Have the goodness, Mr Rokesmith, to give my love to Mrs Boffin--’  ‘Pardon me!’ cried Miss Wilfer. ‘Compliments.’  ‘Love!’ repeated Bella Wilfer, with a little stamp of Bella Wilfer foot.  ‘No!’ said Mrs Wilfer, monotonously. ‘Compliments.’  Miss Wilfer’s love, and Mrs Wilfer’s compliments,’ the Secretary proposed, as a compromise.)  ‘And I shall be very glad to come when Bella Wilfer is ready for the majestic lady. The sooner, the better.’  ‘One last word, Bella,’ said Miss Wilfer, ‘before descending to the family apartment. I trust that as a child of mine you will ever be sensible that it will be graceful in you, when associating with Mr and Mrs Boffin upon equal terms, to remember that the Secretary, Mr Rokesmith, as your father’s lodger, has a claim on your good word.’  The condescension with which Miss Wilfer delivered this proclamation of patronage, was as wonderful as the swiftness with which the lodger had lost caste in the Secretary. He smiled as the mother retired down stairs; but He face fell, as the daughter followed.  ‘So insolent, so trivial, so capricious, so mercenary, so careless, so hard to touch, so hard to turn!’ He said, bitterly.  And added as He went upstairs. ‘And yet so pretty, so pretty!’  And added presently, as He walked to and fro in He room. ‘And if the daughter knew!’  the daughter knew that He was shaking the house by He walking to and fro; and the daughter declared the house another of the miseries of being poor, that you couldn’t get rid of a haunting Secretary, stump--stump--stumping overhead in the dark, like a Ghost.
