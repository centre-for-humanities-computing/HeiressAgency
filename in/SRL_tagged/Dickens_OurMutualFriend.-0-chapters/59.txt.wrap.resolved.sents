 A FEW GRAINS OF PEPPER   The dolls’ dressmaker went no more to the business-premises of Pubsey and Co. in St Mary Axe, after chance had disclosed to her (as her supposed) the flinty and hypocritical character of Mr Riah.
her often moralized over her work on the tricks and the manners of that venerable cheat, but made her little purchases elsewhere, and lived a secluded life.
After much consultation with her, her decided not to put Lizzie Hexam on her guard against the old man, arguing that the disappointment of finding the old man out would come upon her quite soon enough.
Therefore, in her communication with her friend by letter, her was silent on this theme, and principally dilated on the backslidings of her bad child, who every day grew worse and worse.
‘You wicked old boy,’ Miss Wren would say to old boy, with a menacing forefinger, ‘you’ll force me to run away from old boy, after all, you will; and then you’ll shake to bits, and there’ll be nobody to pick up the pieces!’  At this foreshadowing of a desolate decease, the wicked old boy would whine and whimper, and would sit shaking the wicked old boy into the lowest of low spirits, until such time as the wicked old boy could shake the wicked old boy out of the house and shake another threepennyworth into the wicked old boy.
But dead drunk or dead sober (the wicked old boy had come to such a pass that the wicked old boy was least alive in the latter state), it was always on the conscience of the paralytic scarecrow that the wicked old boy had betrayed the wicked old boy sharp parent for sixty threepennyworths of rum, which were all gone, and that her sharpness would infallibly detect the wicked old boy having done it, sooner or later.
All things considered therefore, and addition made of the state of the wicked old boy body to the state of the wicked old boy mind, the bed on which Mr Dolls reposed was a bed of roses from which the flowers and leaves had entirely faded, leaving the wicked old boy to lie upon the thorns and stalks.
On a certain day, Miss Wren was alone at Miss Wren work, with the house-door set open for coolness, and was trolling in a small sweet voice a mournful little song which might have been the song of the doll Miss Wren was dressing, bemoaning the brittleness and meltability of wax, when whom should Miss Wren descry standing on the pavement, looking in at Miss Wren, but Mr Fledgeby.
‘I thought it was you?’ said Mr Fledgeby, coming up the two steps.
‘Did you?’ Miss Wren Miss Wren retorted.
‘And I thought it was you, young man.
Quite a coincidence.
You’re not mistaken, and I’m not mistaken.
How clever we are!’  ‘Well, and how are you?’ said Mr Fledgeby.
‘I am pretty much as usual, sir,’ replied Miss WrenMiss Wren.
‘A very unfortunate parent, worried out of my life and senses by a very bad child.’  Fledgeby’s small eyes opened so wide that Fledgeby’s small eyes might have passed for ordinary-sized eyes, as he stared about he for the very young person whom he supposed to be in question.
‘But you’re not a parent,’ said Miss Wren, ‘and consequently it’s of no use talking to you upon a family subject.--To what am I to attribute the honour and favour?’  ‘To a wish to improve your acquaintance,Mr Fledgeby replied.
Miss Wren, stopping to bite Miss Wren thread, looked at Miss Wren very knowingly.
‘We never meet now,’ said Fledgeby; ‘do We?’  ‘No,’ said Miss Wren, chopping off the word.
‘So I had a mind,’ pursued Fledgeby, ‘to come and have a talk with you about We dodging friend, the child of Israel.’  ‘So HE gave you my address; did HE?’ asked Miss WrenMiss Wren.
‘I got my address out of HE,’ said Fledgeby, with a stammer.
‘You seem to see a good deal of HE,’ remarked Miss Wren, with shrewd distrust.
‘A good deal of HE you seem to see, considering.’  ‘Yes, I do,’ said Mr Fledgeby.
‘Considering.’  ‘Haven’t you,’ inquired the dressmaker, bending over the doll on which the dressmaker art was being exercised, ‘done interceding with the dressmaker yet?’  ‘No,’ said Mr Fledgeby, shaking the dressmaker head.
‘La!
Been interceding with the dressmaker all this time, and sticking to the dressmaker still?’ said Miss Wren, busy with the dressmaker work.
‘Sticking to the dressmaker is the word,’ said Mr Fledgeby.
Miss Wren Miss Wren pursued Miss Wren occupation with a concentrated air, and asked, after an interval of silent industry:  ‘Are you in the army?’  ‘Not exactly,’ said Fledgeby, rather flattered by the question.
‘Navy?’ asked Miss WrenMiss Wren.
‘N--no,’ said Fledgeby.
Miss Wren qualified these two negatives, as if Miss Wren were not absolutely in either service, but was almost in both.
‘What are you then?’ demanded Miss WrenMiss Wren.
‘I am a gentleman, I am,’ said Mr Fledgeby.
‘Oh!’ assented Jenny, screwing up Jenny mouth with an appearance of conviction.
‘Yes, to be sure!
That accounts for your having so much time to give to interceding.
But only to think how kind and friendly a gentleman you must be!’  Mr Fledgeby found that Mr Fledgeby was skating round a board marked Dangerous, and had better cut out a fresh track.
‘Let’s get back to the dodgerest of the dodgers,’ said Mr Fledgeby.
‘What’s Mr Fledgeby up to in the case of your friend the handsome gal?
Mr Fledgeby must have some object.
What’s Mr Fledgeby object?’  ‘Cannot undertake to say, sir, I am sure!’ returned Miss Wren, composedly.
‘Mr Fledgeby won’t acknowledge where Jenny’s gone,’ said Mr Fledgeby; ‘and I have a fancy that I should like to have another look at Jenny.
Now I know Mr Fledgeby knows where Jenny is gone.’  ‘Cannot undertake to say, sir, I am sure!’ Miss Wren Miss Wren again rejoined.
‘And you know where Jenny is gone,’ hazarded Fledgeby.
‘Cannot undertake to say, sir, really,’ replied Miss WrenMiss Wren.
The quaint little chin met Mr Fledgeby’s gaze with such a baffling hitch, that that agreeable gentleman was for some time at a loss how to resume that agreeable gentleman fascinating part in the dialogue.
At length that agreeable gentleman said:  ‘Miss Jenny!--That’s your name, if I don’t mistake?’  ‘Probably you don’t mistake, sir,’ was Miss Miss Wren’s cool answer; ‘because you had it on the best authority.
Mine, you know.’  ‘Miss Jenny!
Instead of coming up and being dead, let’s come out and look alive.
It’ll pay better, I assure you,’ said Fledgeby, bestowing an inveigling twinkle or two upon the dressmaker.
‘You’ll find it pay better.’  ‘Perhaps,’ said Miss Jenny, holding out Miss Jenny doll at arm’s length, and critically contemplating the effect of Miss Jenny art with Miss Jenny scissors on Miss Jenny lips and Miss Jenny head thrown back, as if Miss Jenny interest lay there, and not in the conversation; ‘perhaps you’ll explain your meaning, young man, which is Greek to me.--You must have another touch of blue in your trimming, my dear.’ Having addressed the last remark to Miss Jenny fair client, Miss Wren Miss Wren proceeded to snip at some blue fragments that lay before Miss Jenny, among fragments of all colours, and to thread a needle from a skein of blue silk.
‘Look here,’ said Fledgeby.--‘Are you attending?’  ‘I am attending, sir,’ replied Miss WrenMiss Wren, without the slightest appearance of so doing.
‘Another touch of blue in your trimming, my dear.’  ‘Well, look here,’ said Fledgeby, rather discouraged by the circumstances under which Fledgeby found Fledgeby pursuing the conversation.
‘If you’re attending--’  [‘Light blue, my sweet young lady,’ remarked Miss Wren, in a sprightly tone, ‘being best suited to your fair complexion and your flaxen curls.’)  ‘I say, if you’re attending,’ proceeded Fledgeby, ‘Fledgeby’ll pay better in this way.
Fledgeby’ll lead in a roundabout manner to your buying damage and waste of Pubsey and Co. at a nominal price, or even getting Fledgeby for nothing.’  ‘Aha!’ thought the dressmaker.
‘But you are not so roundabout, Little Eyes, that I don’t notice your answering for Pubsey and Co. after all!
Little Eyes, Little Eyes, you’re too cunning by half.’  ‘And I take it for granted,’ pursued Fledgeby, ‘that to get the most of your materials for nothing would be well worth your while, Miss Jenny?’  ‘You may take it for granted,’ returned the dressmaker with many knowing nods, ‘that it’s always well worth my while to make money.’  ‘Now,’ said Fledgeby approvingly, ‘you’re answering to a sensible purpose.
Now, you’re coming out and looking alive!
So I make so free, Miss Jenny, as to offer the remark, that you and Judah were too thick together to last.
You can’t come to be intimate with such a deep file as Judah without beginning to see a little way into Judah, you know,’ said Fledgeby with a wink.
‘I must own,’ returned the dressmaker, with the dressmaker eyes upon the dressmaker work, ‘that we are not good friends at present.’  ‘I know you’re not good friends at present,’ said Fledgeby.
‘I know all about it.
I should like to pay off Judah, by not letting Judah have Judah own deep way in everything.
In most things Judah’ll get it by hook or by crook, but--hang it all!--don’t let Judah have Judah own deep way in everything.
That’s too much.’ Fledgeby said this with some display of indignant warmth, as if Fledgeby was counsel in the cause for Virtue.
‘How can I prevent Fledgeby having Fledgeby own way?’ began the dressmaker.
‘Deep way, I called it,’ said Fledgeby.
‘--His own deep way, in anything?’  ‘I’ll tell you,’ said Fledgeby.
‘I like to hear you ask it, because it’s looking alive.
it’s what I should expect to find in one of your sagacious understanding.
Now, candidly.’  ‘Eh?’ cried Miss Jenny.
‘I said, now candidly,Mr Fledgeby explained, a little put out.
‘Oh-h!’  ‘I should be glad to countermine Fledgeby, respecting the handsome gal, your friend.
Fledgeby means something there.
You may depend upon it, Judah means something there.
Judah has a motive, and of course a motive is a dark motive.
Now, whatever a motive is, a motive’s necessary to Judah motive’--Mr Fledgeby’s constructive powers were not equal to the avoidance of some tautology here--‘that it should be kept from me, what Judah has done with her.
So I put it to you, who know: What HAS Judah done with her?
I ask no more.
And is that asking much, when you understand that it will pay?’  Miss Jenny Wren, who had cast her eyes upon the bench again after her last interruption, sat looking at the bench, needle in hand but not working, for some moments.
her then briskly resumed her work, and said with a sidelong glance of her eyes and chin at Mr Fledgeby:  ‘Where d’ye live?’  ‘Albany, Piccadilly,’ replied Mr Fledgeby.
‘When are you at home?’  ‘When you like.’  ‘Breakfast-time?’ said Jenny, in Jenny abruptest and shortest manner.
‘No better time in the day,’ said Mr Fledgeby.
‘I’ll look in upon you to-morrow, young man.
Those two ladies,’ pointing to dolls, ‘have an appointment in Bond Street at ten precisely.
When I’ve dropped ‘em there, I’ll drive round to em.’ With a weird little laugh, Miss Jenny pointed to Miss Jenny crutch-stick as Miss Jenny equipage.
‘This is looking alive indeed!’ cried Mr Fledgeby, rising.
‘Mark you!
I promise you nothing,’ said the dolls’ dressmaker, dabbing two dabs at Mark with Miss Jenny needle, as if Miss Jenny put out both Mark eyes.
‘No no.
I understand,’ returned Fledgeby.
‘The damage and waste question shall be settled first.
It shall be made to pay; don’t you be afraid.
Good-day, Miss Jenny.’  ‘Good-day, young man.’  Mr Fledgeby’s prepossessing form withdrew Mr Fledgeby’s prepossessing form; and the little dressmaker, clipping and snipping and stitching, and stitching and snipping and clipping, fell to work at a great rate; musing and muttering all the time.
‘Misty, misty, misty.
Can’t make it out.
Little Eyes and the wolf in a conspiracy?
Or Little Eyes and the wolf against one another?
Can’t make it out.
My poor Lizzie, have they both designs against you, either way?
Can’t make it out.
Is Little Eyes Pubsey, and the wolf in a conspiracy?
Can’t make it out.
Pubsey true to Co, and Co to Pubsey?
Pubsey false to Co, and Co to Pubsey?
Can’t make it out.
What said Little Eyes?
“Now, candidly?”  Ah!
However the cat jumps, Pubsey false to Co, and Co to Pubsey’S a liar.
That’s all I can make out at present; but you may go to bed in Albany, Piccadilly, with THAT for your pillow, young man!’ Thereupon, the little dressmaker again dabbed out the little dressmaker separately, and making a loop in the air of the little dressmaker thread and deftly catching a loop in the air of her thread into a knot with the little dressmaker , seemed to bowstring the little dressmaker into the bargain.
For the terrors undergone by Mr Dolls that evening when the little dressmaker little parent sat profoundly meditating over the little dressmaker work, and when the little dressmaker imagined the little dressmaker found out, as often as the little dressmaker changed the little dressmaker attitude, or turned the little dressmaker towards the little dressmaker, there is no adequate name.
Moreover no adequate name was the little dressmaker habit to shake the little dressmaker head at that wretched old boy whenever the little dressmaker caught that wretched old boy eye as that wretched old boy shivered and shook.
What are popularly called ‘the trembles’ being in full force upon that wretched old boy that evening, and likewise what are popularly called ‘the horrors,’ that wretched old boy had a very bad time of it; which was not made better by that wretched old boy being so remorseful as frequently to moan ‘Sixty threepennorths.’ This imperfect sentence not being at all intelligible as a confession, but sounding like a Gargantuan order for a dram, brought the little dressmaker into new difficulties by occasioning the little dressmaker parent to pounce at the little dressmaker in a more than usually snappish manner, and to overwhelm the little dressmaker with bitter reproaches.
What was a bad time for Mr Dolls, could not fail to be a bad time for the little dressmaker.
However, the little dressmaker was on the alert next morning, and drove to Bond Street, and set down the two ladies punctually, and then directed the little dressmaker equipage to conduct the little dressmaker to Albany.
Arrived at the doorway of the house in which Mr Fledgeby’s chambers were, the little dressmaker found a lady standing there in a travelling dress, holding in the little dressmaker hand--of all things in the world--a gentleman’s hat.
‘You want some one?’ said the lady in a stern manner.
‘I am going up stairs to Mr Fledgeby’s.’  ‘You cannot do that at this moment.
There is a gentleman with him.
I am waiting for a gentleman with him.
him business with Fledgeby will very soon be transacted, and then you can go up.
Until a gentleman with him comes down, you must wait here.’  While speaking, and afterwards, a lady kept watchfully between a lady and the staircase, as if prepared to oppose a lady going up, by force.
a lady being of a stature to stop a lady with a hand, and looking mightily determined, the little dressmaker stood still.
‘Well?
Why do you listen?’ asked a lady.
‘I am not listening,’ said the little dressmaker.
‘What do you hear?’ asked a lady, altering a lady phrase.
‘Is it a kind of a spluttering somewhere?’ said the dressmaker, with an inquiring look.
‘Mr Fledgeby in his shower-bath, perhaps,’ remarked a lady, smiling.
‘And somebody’s beating a carpet, I think?’  ‘Mr Fledgeby’s carpet, I dare say,’ replied a lady.
Miss Wren had a reasonably good eye for smiles, being well accustomed to them on the part of Miss Wren young friends, though them smiles mostly ran smaller than in nature.
But a lady had never seen so singular a smile as that upon a lady.
a lady twitched a lady nostrils open in a remarkable manner, and contracted a lady lips and eyebrows.
a lady was a smile of enjoyment too, though of such a fierce kind that Miss Wren Miss Wren thought a lady would rather not enjoy a lady than do it in that way.
‘Well!’ said a lady, watching a lady.
‘What now?’  ‘I hope there’s nothing the matter!’ said the little dressmaker.
‘Where?’ inquired a lady.
‘I don’t know where,’ said Miss Wren, staring about a lady.
‘But I never heard such odd noises.
Don’t you think I had better call somebody?’  ‘I think you had better not,’ returned a lady with a significant frown, and drawing closer.
On this hint, the little dressmaker relinquished the idea, and stood looking at a lady as hard as a lady looked at a lady.
Meanwhile the little dressmaker listened with amazement to the odd noises which still continued, and a lady listened too, but with a coolness in which there was no trace of amazement.
Soon afterwards, came a slamming and banging of doors; and then came running down stairs, a gentleman with whiskers, and out of breath, who seemed to be red-hot.
‘Is your business done, Alfred?’ inquired a lady.
‘Very thoroughly done,’ replied a gentleman with him, as a gentleman with him took a gentleman with him hat from a lady.
‘You can go up to Fledgeby as soon as you like,’ said a lady, moving haughtily away.
‘Oh!
And you can take these three pieces of stick with you,’ added a gentleman with him politely, ‘and say, if you please, that they come from Mr Alfred Lammle, with Mr Alfred Lammle compliments on leaving England.
Mr Alfred Lammle.
Be so good as not to forget the name.’  The three pieces of stick were three broken and frayed fragments of a stout lithe cane.
Miss Jenny taking them wonderingly, and the gentleman repeating with a grin, ‘Mr Alfred Lammle, if you’ll be so good.
Compliments, on leaving EnglandEngland,’ the lady and gentleman walked away quite deliberately, and Miss Jenny and Jenny crutch-stick went up stairs.
‘Lammle, Lammle, Lammle?’ Miss Jenny Jenny repeated as Miss Jenny panted from stair to stair, ‘where have I heard that name?
Lammle, Lammle?
I know!
Saint Mary Axe!’  With a gleam of new intelligence in Miss Jenny sharp face, the little dressmaker pulled at Fledgeby’s bell.
No one answered; but, from within the chambers, there proceeded a continuous spluttering sound of a highly singular and unintelligible nature.
‘Good gracious!
Is Little Eyes choking?’ cried Miss JennyJenny.
Pulling at Fledgeby’s bell again and getting no reply, Miss Jenny pushed the outer door, and found the outer door standing ajar.
No one being visible on Miss Jenny opening the outer door wider, and the spluttering continuing, Miss Jenny took the liberty of opening an inner door, and then beheld the extraordinary spectacle of Fledgeby in a shirt, a pair of Turkish trousers, and a Turkish cap, rolling over and over on Fledgeby own carpet, and spluttering wonderfully.
‘Oh Lord!’ gasped Fledgeby.
‘Oh my eye!
Stop thief!
I am strangling.
Fire!
Oh my eye!
A glass of water.
Give me a glass of water.
Shut the outer door.
Murder!
Oh Lord!’ And then rolled and spluttered more than ever.
Hurrying into another room, Miss Jenny got a glass of water, and brought a glass of water for Fledgeby’s relief: who, gasping, spluttering, and rattling in his throat betweenwhiles, drank some water, and laid his head faintly on Miss Jenny arm.
‘Oh my eye!’ cried Fledgeby, struggling anew.
‘It’s salt and snuff.
It’s up my nose, and down my throat, and in my wind-pipe.
Ugh!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ah--h--h--h!’ And here, crowing fearfully, with his eyes starting out of his head, appeared to be contending with every mortal disease incidental to poultry.
‘And Oh my Eye, I’m so sore!’ cried Fledgeby, starting, over on his back, in a spasmodic way that caused the little dressmaker to retreat to the wall.
‘Oh I smart so!
Do put something to my back and arms, and legs and shoulders.
Ugh!
It’s down my throat again and can’t come up.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ah--h--h--h!
Oh I smart so!’ Here Fledgeby bounded up, and bounded down, and went rolling over and over again.
The dollsthe little dressmaker looked on until the little dressmaker rolled the little dressmaker into a corner with the little dressmaker Turkish slippers uppermost, and then, resolving in the first place to address her ministration to the salt and snuff, gave the little dressmaker more water and slapped his back.
But, the latter application was by no means a success, causing Fledgeby to scream, and to cry out, ‘Oh my eye!
don’t slap me!
I’m covered with weales and I smart so!’  However, Fledgeby gradually ceased to choke and crow, saving at intervals, and Miss Jenny Miss Jenny got Fledgeby into an easy-chair: where, with Fledgeby eyes red and watery, with Fledgeby features swollen, and with some half-dozen livid bars across Fledgeby face, Fledgeby presented a most rueful sight.
‘What ever possessed you to take salt and snuff, Fledgeby?’ inquired Miss Jenny.
‘I didn’t take it,’ the dismal youth replied.
‘it was crammed into my mouth.’  ‘Who crammed it?’ asked Miss Jenny.
‘Fledgeby did,’ answered Fledgeby.
‘The assassin.
Lammle.
Fledgeby rubbed it into my mouth and up my nose and down my throat--Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ah--h--h--h!
Ugh!--to prevent my crying out, and then cruelly assaulted me.’  ‘With this?’ asked Miss Jenny, showing the pieces of cane.
‘That’s the weapon,’ said Fledgeby, eyeing Fledgeby with the air of an acquaintance.
‘Fledgeby broke Fledgeby over Fledgeby.
Oh I smart so!
How did you come by Fledgeby?’  ‘When Fledgeby ran down stairs and joined the lady Fledgeby had left in the hall with Fledgeby hat’--Miss Miss Jenny began.
‘Oh!’ groaned Fledgeby, writhing, ‘Fledgeby was holding his hat, was Fledgeby?
I might have known Fledgeby was in it.’  ‘When Fledgeby came down stairs and joined the lady who wouldn’t let me come up, Fledgeby gave me the pieces of cane for Fledgeby, and I was to say, “With Mr Alfred Lammle’s compliments on Fledgeby leaving England.”Miss Jenny Miss Jenny said it with such spiteful satisfaction, and such a hitch of Fledgeby chin and eyes as might have added to Fledgeby miseries, if Fledgeby could have noticed either, in Fledgeby bodily pain with Fledgeby hand to Fledgeby head.
‘Shall I go for the police?’ inquired Miss Jenny, with a nimble start towards the outer door.
‘Stop!
No, don’t!’ cried Fledgeby.
‘Don’t, please.
We had better keep it quiet.
Will you be so good as shut the outer door?
Oh I do smart so!’  In testimony of the extent to which he smarted, Fledgeby came wallowing out of the easy-chair, and took another roll on the carpet.
‘Now the outer door,’ said Fledgeby, sitting up in anguish, with Fledgeby Turkish cap half on and half off, and the bars on Fledgeby face getting bluer, ‘do me the kindness to look at my back and shoulders.
the kindness to look at my back and shoulders must be in an awful state, for I hadn’t got my dressing-gown on, when the brute came rushing in.
Cut my shirt away from the collar; there’s a pair of scissors on that table.
Oh!’ groaned Fledgeby, with Fledgeby hand to Fledgeby head again.
‘How I do smart, to be sure!’  ‘There?’ inquired Miss JennyMiss Jenny, alluding to the back and shoulders.
‘Oh Lord, yes!’ moaned Fledgeby, rocking Fledgeby.
‘And all over!
Everywhere!’  The busy little dressmaker quickly snipped my shirt away, and laid bare the results of as furious and sound a thrashing as Fledgeby Fledgeby merited.
‘You may well smart, young man!’ exclaimed Miss JennyMiss Jenny.
And stealthily rubbed Miss Jenny little hands behind Fledgeby, and poked a few exultant pokes with Miss Jenny two forefingers over the crown of Fledgeby head.
‘What do you think of vinegar and brown paper?’ inquired the suffering Fledgeby, still rocking and moaning.
‘Does it look as if vinegar and brown paper was the sort of application?’  ‘Yes,’ said Miss Miss Jenny, with a silent chuckle.
‘It looks as if It ought to be Pickled.’  Fledgeby collapsed under the word ‘Pickled,’ and groaned again.
‘My kitchen is on this floor,’ Fledgeby said; ‘you’ll find brown paper in a dresser-drawer there, and a bottle of vinegar on a shelf.
Would you have the kindness to make a few plasters and put ‘em on?
It can’t be kept too quiet.’  ‘One, two--hum--five, six.
You’ll want six,’ said the dress-maker.
‘There’s smart enough,’ whimpered Fledgeby, groaning and writhing again, ‘for sixty.’  Miss Jenny Miss Jenny repaired to My kitchen, scissors in hand, found the brown paper and found the vinegar, and skilfully cut out and steeped six large plasters.
When the vinegar were all lying ready on the dresser, an idea occurred to Miss Jenny as Miss Jenny was about to gather the vinegar up.
‘I think,’ said Miss Miss Jenny with a silent laugh, ‘the young man ought to have a little pepper?
Just a few grains?
I think the young man’s tricks and manners make a claim upon the young man friends for a little pepper?’  Fledgeby evil star showing Fledgeby the pepper-box on the chimneypiece, Fledgeby climbed upon a chair, and got a chair down, and sprinkled all the plasters with a judicious hand.
Fledgeby then went back to Fledgeby, and stuck them all on Fledgeby: Fledgeby uttering a sharp howl as each was put in its place.
‘There, young man!’ said The dolls.
‘Now I hope you feel pretty comfortable?’  Apparently, Fledgeby did not, for Fledgeby cried by way of answer, ‘Oh--h how I do smart!’  Miss Jenny Miss Jenny got Fledgeby Persian gown upon Fledgeby, extinguished Fledgeby eyes crookedly with Fledgeby Persian cap, and helped Fledgeby to Fledgeby bed: upon which Fledgeby climbed groaning.
‘Business between you and me being out of the question to-day, young man, and my time being precious,’ said Miss Jenny Miss Jenny then, ‘I’ll make Fledgeby scarce.
Are you comfortable now?’  ‘Oh my eye!’ cried Fledgeby.
‘No, I ain’t.
Oh--h--h!
how I do smart!’  The last thing Miss Jenny Miss Jenny saw, as Miss Jenny looked back before closing the outer door, was Fledgeby in the act of plunging and gambolling all over his bed, like a porpoise or dolphin in its native element.
Miss Jenny then shut the outer door, and all the other doors, and going down stairs and emerging from the Albany into the busy streets, took omnibus for Saint Mary Axe: pressing on the road all the gaily-dressed ladies whom Miss Jenny could see from the window, and making them unconscious lay-figures for dolls, while Miss Jenny mentally cut them out and basted them.
