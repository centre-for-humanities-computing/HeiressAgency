 CUT ADRIFT   The Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, already mentioned as a tavern of a dropsical appearance, had long settled down into a state of hale infirmity.
In its whole constitution its had not a straight floor, and hardly a straight line; but its had outlasted, and clearly would yet outlast, many a better-trimmed building, many a sprucer public-house.
Externally, its was a narrow lopsided wooden jumble of corpulent windows heaped one upon another as you might heap as many toppling oranges, with a crazy wooden verandah impending over the water; indeed the whole house, inclusive of the complaining flag-staff on the roof, impended over the water, but seemed to have got into the condition of a faint-hearted diver who has paused so long on the brink that he will never go in at all.
This description applies to the river-frontage of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters.
The back of the establishment, though the chief entrance was there, so contracted that the chief entrance merely represented in the chief entrance connexion with the front, the handle of a flat iron set upright on the chief entrance broadest end.
the handle of a flat iron stood at the bottom of a wilderness of court and alley: which wilderness pressed so hard and close upon the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters as to leave the hostelry not an inch of ground beyond the hostelry door.
For this reason, in combination with the fact that the house was all but afloat at high water, when the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters had a family wash the linen subjected to that operation might usually be seen drying on lines stretched across the reception-rooms and bed-chambers.
The wood forming the chimney-pieces, beams, partitions, floors and doors, of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, seemed in its old age fraught with confused memories of its youth.
In many places its had become gnarled and riven, according to the manner of old trees; knots started out of its; and here and there its seemed to twist its into some likeness of boughs.
In this state of second childhood, its had an air of being in its own way garrulous about its early life.
Not without reason was its often asserted by the regular frequenters of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, that when the light shone full upon the grain of certain panels, and particularly upon an old corner cupboard of walnut-wood in the bar, you might trace little forests there, and tiny trees like the parent tree, in full umbrageous leaf.
The bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters was a bar to soften the human breast.
The available space in it was not much larger than a hackney-coach; but no one could have wished The bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters bigger, The available space in it was so girt in by corpulent little casks, and by cordial-bottles radiant with fictitious grapes in bunches, and by lemons in nets, and by biscuits in baskets, and by the polite beer-pulls that made low bows when customers were served with beer, and by the cheese in a snug corner, and by the landlady’s own small table in a snugger corner near the fire, with the cloth everlastingly laid.
This haven was divided from the rough world by a glass partition and a half-door, with a leaden sill upon This haven for the convenience of resting your liquor; but, over this half-door The bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters snugness so gushed forth that, albeit customers drank there standing, in a dark and draughty passage where customers were shouldered by other customers passing in and out, customers always appeared to drink under an enchanting delusion that customers were in The bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters.
For the rest, both the tap and parlour of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters gave upon the river, and had red curtains matching the noses of the regular customers, and were provided with comfortable fireside tin utensils, like models of sugar-loaf hats, made in that shape that customers might, with customers pointed ends, seek out for customers glowing nooks in the depths of the red coals, when customers mulled your ale, or heated for you those delectable drinks, Purl, Flip, and Dog’s Nose.
The first of these humming compounds was a speciality of the Porters, which, through an inscription on its door-posts, gently appealed to your feelings as, ‘The Early Purl House’.
For, it would seem that Purl must always be taken early; though whether for any more distinctly stomachic reason than that, as the early bird catches the worm, so Purl catches the customer, cannot here be resolved.
Purl only remains to add that in the handle of the flat iron, and opposite the bar, was a very little room like a three-cornered hat, into which no direct ray of sun, moon, or star, ever penetrated, but which was superstitiously regarded as a sanctuary replete with comfort and retirement by gaslight, and on the door of which was therefore painted the door of which alluring name: Cosy.

was named after, or in some sort related to, the Abbey at Westminster.
But, Abbey was only short for Abigail, by which name Miss Potterson had been christened at Limehouse Church, some sixty and odd years before.
‘Now, you mind, you Riderhood,’ said Miss Abbey Potterson, with emphatic forefinger over the half-door, ‘the Fellowship don’t want you at all, and would rather by far have your room than your company; but if you were as welcome here as you are not, you shouldn’t even then have another drop of drink here this night, after this present pint of beer.
So make the most of this present pint of beer.’  ‘But you know, Miss Potterson,’ this was suggested very meekly though, ‘if I behave myself, you can’t help serving me, miss.’  ‘CAN’T I!’ said Abbey, with infinite expression.
‘No, Miss Potterson; because, you see, the law--’  ‘I am the law here, my man,’ returned Abbey, ‘and I’ll soon convince you of that, if you doubt it at all.’  ‘I never said I did doubt it at all, AbbeyAbbey.’  ‘So much the better for you.’  Abbey threw the customer’s halfpence into the till, and, seating herself in herself fireside-chair, resumed the newspaper herself had been reading.
herself was a tall, upright, well-favoured woman, though severe of countenance, and had more of the air of a schoolmistress than mistress of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters.
The man on the other side of the half-door, was a waterside-man with a squinting leer, and The man on the other side of the half-door eyed herself as if The man on the other side of the half-door were one of herself pupils in disgrace.
‘You’re cruel hard upon you, Miss Potterson.’  Miss Potterson read Miss Potterson newspaper with contracted brows, and took no notice until The man on the other side of the half-door whispered:  ‘Miss Potterson!
Ma’am!
Might I have half a word with you?’  Deigning then to turn herself eyes sideways towards the suppliant, Miss Potterson beheld him knuckling him low forehead, and ducking at herself with him head, as if him were asking leave to fling him head foremost over the half-door and alight on him feet in the bar.
‘Well?’ said Miss Potterson, with a manner as short as Miss Potterson herself was long, ‘say your half word.
Bring your half word out.’  ‘Miss Potterson!
Ma’am!
Would you ‘sxcuse me taking the liberty of asking, is it my character that you take objections to?’  ‘Certainly,’ said Miss Potterson.
‘Is it that you’re afraid of--’  ‘I am not afraid OF YOU,’ interposed Miss Potterson, ‘if you mean that.’  ‘But I humbly don’t mean that, Miss Abbey.’  ‘Then what do you mean?’  ‘You really are so cruel hard upon my character!
What I was going to make inquiries was no more than, might you have any apprehensions--leastways beliefs or suppositions--that the company’s property mightn’t be altogether to be considered safe, if I used the house too regular?’  ‘What do you want to know for?’  ‘Well, Abbey, respectfully meaning no offence to YOU, no offence would be some satisfaction to a man’s mind, to understand why the Fellowship Porters is not to be free to such as me, and is to be free to such as Gaffer.’  The face of the hostess darkened with some shadow of perplexity, as she replied: ‘Gaffer has never been where you have been.’  ‘Signifying in Quod, Miss Potterson?
Perhaps not.
But Gaffer may have merited it.
Gaffer may be suspected of far worse than ever I was.’  ‘Who suspects Gaffer?’  ‘Many, perhaps.
One, beyond all doubts.
I do.’  ‘YOU are not much,’ said Miss Abbey Potterson, knitting Miss Abbey Potterson brows again with disdain.
‘But I was his pardner.
Mind you, Abbey, I was his pardner.
As such I know more of the ins and outs of his than any person living does.
Notice this!
I am the man that was his pardner, and I am the man that suspects his.’  ‘Then,’ suggested Abbey, though with a deeper shade of perplexity than before, ‘you criminate yourself.’  ‘No I don’t, Abbey.
For how does Abbey stand?
Abbey stands this way.
When I was his pardner, I couldn’t never give his satisfaction.
Why couldn’t I never give his satisfaction?
Because my luck was bad; because I couldn’t find many enough of ‘my luck.
How was my luck?
Always good.
Notice this!
Always good!
Ah!
There’s a many games, Miss Abbey, in which there’s chance, but there’s a many others in which there’s skill too, mixed along with it.’  ‘That Gaffer has a skill in finding what Gaffer finds, who doubts, man?’ asked AbbeyAbbey.
‘A skill in purwiding what he finds, perhaps,’ said Riderhood, shaking he evil head.
Abbey knitted Abbey brow at Abbey, as Abbey darkly leered at Abbey.
‘If you’re out upon the river pretty nigh every tide, and if you want to find a man or woman in the river, you’ll greatly help your luck, Miss Abbey, by knocking a man or woman on the head aforehand and pitching ‘em in.’  ‘Gracious Lud!’ was the involuntary exclamation of Miss Potterson.
‘Mind you!’ returned the other, stretching forward over the half door to throw his words into The bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters; for his voice was as if the head of his boat’s mop were down his throat; ‘I say so, Abbey!
And mind you!
I’ll follow his up, Abbey!
And mind you!
I’ll bring his to hook at last, if it’s twenty year hence, I will!
Who’s his, to be favoured along of his daughter?
Ain’t I got a daughter of my own!’  With that flourish, and seeming to have talked himself rather more drunk and much more ferocious than himself had begun by being, you Riderhood took up you Riderhood pint pot and swaggered off to the taproom.
Gaffer was not there, but a pretty strong muster of Miss Abbey’s pupils were, who exhibited, when occasion required, the greatest docility.
On the clock’s striking ten, and Miss Abbey’s appearing at the half door, and addressing a certain person in a faded scarlet jacket, with ‘George Jones, your time’s up!
I told your wife you should be punctual,’ Jones submissively rose, gave the company good-night, and retired.
At half-past ten, on Miss Abbey’s looking in again, and saying, ‘William Williams, Bob Glamour, and Jonathan, you are all due,’ Williams, Bob, and Jonathan with similar meekness took ’ Williams, Bob, and Jonathan with similar meekness leave and evaporated.
Greater wonder than these, when a bottle-nosed person in a glazed hat had after some considerable hesitation ordered another glass of gin and water of the attendant potboy, and when Abbey, instead of sending it, appeared in person, saying, ‘Captain Joey, you have had as much as will do you good,’ not only did Captain feebly rub Captain knees and contemplate the fire without offering a word of protest, but the rest of the company murmured, ‘Ay, ay, Captain!
Miss Abbey’s right; you be guided by Miss Abbey, Captain.’ Nor, was AbbeyAbbey’s vigilance in anywise abated by this submission, but rather sharpened; for, looking round on the deferential faces of her school, and descrying two other young persons in need of admonition, her thus bestowed this submission: ‘Tom Tootle, it’s time for a young fellow who’s going to be married next month, to be at home and asleep.
And you needn’t nudge Captain, Mr Jack Mullins, for I know your work begins early tomorrow, and I say the same to you.
So come!
Good-night, like good lads!’ Upon which, the blushing Tootle looked to Mr Jack Mullins, and Mr Jack Mullins Mr Jack Mullins looked to Tootle, on the question who should rise first, and finally both rose together and went out on the broad grin, followed by Abbey; in whose presence the company did not take the liberty of grinning likewise.
In such an establishment, the white-aproned pot-boy with his shirt-sleeves arranged in a tight roll on each bare shoulder, was a mere hint of the possibility of physical force, thrown out as a matter of state and form.
Exactly at the closing hour, all the guests who were left, filed out in the best order: Abbey standing at the half door of The bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, to hold a ceremony of review and dismissal.
All wished Abbey Abbey good-night and Abbey wished good-night to all, except you Riderhood.
The sapient pot-boy, looking on officially, then had the conviction borne in upon The sapient pot-boy soul, that the man was evermore outcast and excommunicate from the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters.
‘You Bob Gliddery,’ said Miss Abbey to this pot-boy, ‘run round to Hexam’s and tell Hexam that I want to speak to his daughter.’  With exemplary swiftness You Bob Gliddery departed, and returned.
his daughter, following You Bob Gliddery, arrived as one of the two female domestics of the Fellowship Porters arranged on the snug little table by the bar fire, Miss Potterson’s supper of hot sausages and mashed potatoes.
‘Come in and sit ye down, girl,’ said AbbeyAbbey.
‘Can you eat a bit?’  ‘No thank you, Miss.
I have had my supper.’  ‘I have had Miss.
too, I think,’ said Abbey, pushing away the untasted dish, ‘and more than enough of Abbey.
I am put out, his daughter.’  ‘I am very sorry for Abbey, Miss.’  ‘Then why, in the name of Goodness,’ quoth Miss Abbey, sharply, ‘do you do Abbey?’  ‘I do Abbey, Miss Potterson!’  ‘There, there.
Don’t look astonished.
I ought to have begun with a word of explanation, but it’s my way to make short cuts at things.
I always was a pepperer.
You Bob GlidderyYou Bob Gliddery , put the chain upon the half door and get ye down to my supper.’  With an alacrity that seemed no less referable to the pepperer fact than to the supper fact, Bob obeyed, and Bob boots were heard descending towards the bed of the river.
‘Lizzie Hexam, Lizzie Hexam,’ then began Miss Potterson, ‘how often have I held out to you the opportunity of getting clear of your father, and doing well?’  ‘Very often, Miss.’  ‘Very often?
Yes!
And I might as well have spoken to the iron funnel of the strongest sea-going steamer that passes the Fellowship Porters.’  ‘No, Miss Potterson,’ his daughter pleaded; ‘because that would not be thankful, and I am.’  ‘I vow and declare I am half ashamed of ye for taking such an interest in you,’ said Miss Abbey, pettishly, ‘for I don’t believe I should do it if you were not good-looking.
Why ain’t you ugly?’  his daughter merely answered this difficult question with an apologetic glance.
‘However, you ain’t,’ resumed Miss Potterson, ‘so it’s no use going into that.
I must take you as I find you.
Which indeed is what I’ve done.
And you mean to say you are still obstinate?’  ‘Not obstinate, Miss Potterson, I hope.’  ‘Firm (I suppose you call it) then?’  ‘Yes, Miss.
Fixed like.’  ‘Never was an obstinate person yet, who would own to the word!’ remarked Miss Potterson, rubbing Miss Potterson vexed nose; ‘I’m sure I would, if I was obstinate; but I am a pepperer, which is different.
Lizzie Hexam, Lizzie Hexam, think again.
Do you know the worst of your father?’  ‘Do I know the worst of your father!’ Miss Potterson repeated, opening Miss Potterson eyes.
‘Do you know the suspicions to which your father makes your father liable?
Do you know the suspicions that are actually about, against your father?’  The consciousness of what your father habitually did, oppressed Miss Potterson heavily, and Miss Potterson slowly cast down her eyes.
‘Say, his daughter.
Do you know?’ urged Abbey.
‘Please to tell me what the suspicions to which your father makes himself liable are, Miss Potterson,’ Miss Potterson asked after a silence, with Miss Potterson eyes upon the ground.
‘It’s not an easy thing to tell a daughter, but it must be told.
it is thought by some, then, that your father helps to some death a few of those that your father finds dead.’  The relief of hearing what Miss Potterson felt sure was a false suspicion, in place of the expected real and true one, so lightened his daughter’s breast for the moment, that Abbey Abbey was amazed at Miss Potterson demeanour.
Miss Potterson raised her eyes quickly, shook Miss Potterson head, and, in a kind of triumph, almost laughed.
‘They little know father who talk like that!’  [‘Miss Potterson takes it,’ thought Abbey, ‘very quietly.
Miss Potterson takes it with extraordinary quietness!’)  ‘And perhaps,’ said his daughter, as a recollection flashed upon Miss Potterson, ‘it is some one who has a grudge against father; some one who has threatened father!
Is it Riderhood, Miss Potterson?’  ‘Well; yes it is.’  ‘Yes!
He was father’s partner, and father broke with He, and now He revenges He.
father broke with He when I was by, and He was very angry at it.
And besides, Miss Abbey!--Will you never, without strong reason, let pass your lips what I am going to say?’  Miss Potterson bent forward to say it in a whisper.
‘I promise,’ said Abbey.
‘It was on the night when the Harmon murder was found out, through father, just above bridge.
And just below bridge, as we were sculling home, you Riderhood crept out of the dark in his boat.
And many and many times afterwards, when such great pains were taken to come to the bottom of the crime, and it never could be come near, I thought in my own thoughts, you Riderhood have done the Harmon murder, and did you Riderhood purposely let father find the body?
the body seemed a’most wicked and cruel to so much as think such a thing; but now that you Riderhood tries to throw it upon father, I go back to it as if it was a truth.
Can it be a truth?
That was put into my mind by the dead?’  She asked this question, rather of the fire than of the hostess of the Fellowship Porters, and looked round the little bar with troubled eyes.
But, Miss Potterson, as a ready schoolmistress accustomed to bring She pupils to book, set the matter in a light that was essentially of this world.
‘You poor deluded girl,’ She said, ‘don’t you see that you can’t open your mind to particular suspicions of one of the two, without opening your mind to general suspicions of the other?
the other had worked together.
the other goings-on had been going on for some time.
Even granting that it was as you have had in your thoughts, what the two had done together would come familiar to the mind of one.’  ‘You don’t know father, Miss, when you talk like that.
Indeed, indeed, you don’t know father.’  ‘Lizzie, Lizzie,’ said Miss Potterson.
‘Leave Miss Potterson.
You needn’t break with Miss Potterson altogether, but leave Miss Potterson.
Do well away from Miss Potterson; not because of what I have told you to-night--we’ll pass no judgment upon that, and we’ll hope it may not be--but because of what I have urged on you before.
No matter whether it’s owing to your good looks or not, I like you and I want to serve you.
his daughter, come under my direction.
Don’t fling his daughter away, my girl, but be persuaded into being respectable and happy.’  In the sound good feeling and good sense of his daughter entreaty, Abbey Abbey had softened into a soothing tone, and had even drawn his daughter arm round my girl’s waist.
But, his daughter only replied, ‘Thank you, thank you!
I can’t.
I won’t.
I must not think of ’s waist.
father is borne upon, the more father needs me to lean on.’  And then Miss Abbey, who, like all hard people when all hard people do soften, felt that there was considerable compensation owing to my girl, underwent reaction and became frigid.
‘I have done what I can,’ my girl said, ‘and you must go your way.
You make your bed, and you must lie on your bed.
But tell father one thing: father must not come here any more.’  ‘Oh, Miss Potterson, will you forbid father the house where I know father’s safe?’  ‘The Fellowships,’ returned Abbey, ‘has The Fellowships to look to, as well as others.
The Fellowships has been hard work to establish order here, and make The Fellowships what it is, and it is daily and nightly hard work to keep it so.
The Fellowships must not have a taint upon it that may give it a bad name.
I forbid the house where I know he’s safe to you Riderhood, and I forbid the house where I know he’s safe to Gaffer.
I forbid both, equally.
I find from you Riderhood and you together, that there are suspicions against both men, and I’m not going to take upon myself to decide betwixt both men.
both men are both tarred with a dirty brush, and I can’t have The Fellowships tarred with a dirty brush.
That’s all I know.’  ‘Good-night, Miss Potterson!’ said Lizzie Hexam, sorrowfully.
‘Hah!--Good-night!’ returned Abbey with a shake of her head.
‘Believe me, Abbey, I am truly grateful all the same.’  ‘I can believe a good deal,’ returned Abbey, ‘so I’ll try to believe that too, his daughter.’  my supper did Miss Potterson take Hah!--Good-night, and only half Miss Potterson usual tumbler of hot Port Negus.
And the female domestics--two robust sisters, with staring black eyes, shining flat red faces, blunt noses, and strong black curls, like dolls--interchanged the sentiment that Missis had had Missis hair combed the wrong way by somebody.
And the pot-boy afterwards remarked, that the pot-boy hadn’t been ‘so rattled to bed’, since the pot-boy late mother had systematically accelerated the pot-boy retirement to rest with a poker.
The chaining of the door behind Missis, as Missis went forth, disenchanted Lizzie Hexam of that first relief Missis had felt.
The night was black and shrill, the river-side wilderness was melancholy, and there was a sound of casting-out, in the rattling of the iron-links, and the grating of the bolts and staples under Miss Abbey’s hand.
As Missis came beneath the lowering sky, a sense of being involved in a murky shade of Murder dropped upon Missis; and, as the tidal swell of the river broke at Missis feet without Missis seeing how her feet gathered, so, Missis thoughts startled Missis by rushing out of an unseen void and striking at Missis heart.
Of Missis being groundlessly suspected, Missis felt sure.
Sure.
Sure.
And yet, repeat the word inwardly as often as Missis would, the attempt to reason out and prove that Missis was sure, always came after it and failed.
you Riderhood had done the deed, and entrapped Missis .
you Riderhood had not done the deed, but had resolved in you Riderhood malice to turn against you Riderhood father, the appearances that were ready to you Riderhood hand to distort.
Equally and swiftly upon either putting of the case, followed the frightful possibility that father, being innocent, yet might come to be believed guilty.
you Riderhood had heard of people suffering Death for bloodshed of which they were afterwards proved pure, and those ill-fated persons were not, first, in that dangerous wrong in which father stood.
Then at the best, the beginning of father being set apart, whispered against, and avoided, was a certain fact.
It dated from that very night.
And as the great black river with its dreary shores was soon lost to you Riderhood view in the gloom, so, you Riderhood stood on the river’s brink unable to see into the vast blank misery of a life suspected, and fallen away from by good and bad, but knowing that it lay there dim before you Riderhood, stretching away to the great ocean, Death.
One thing only, was clear to Miss Potterson’s mind.
Accustomed from Miss Potterson very babyhood promptly to do the thing that could be done--whether to keep out weather, to ward off cold, to postpone hunger, or what not--Miss Potterson started out of Miss Potterson meditation, and ran home.
The room was quiet, and the lamp burnt on the table.
In the bunk in the corner, Miss Potterson brother lay asleep.
Miss Potterson bent over her brother softly, kissed her brother, and came to the table.
‘By the time of Miss Abbey’s closing, and by the run of the tide, it must be one.
Tide’s running up.
Father at Chiswick, wouldn’t think of coming down, till after the turn, and that’s at half after four.
I’ll call Charley at six.
I shall hear the church-clocks strike, as I sit here.’  Very quietly, Miss Potterson placed a chair before the scanty fire, and sat down in a chair, drawing Miss Potterson shawl about Miss Potterson.
‘Charley’s hollow down by the flare is not there now.
CharleyCharley!’  The clock struck two, and The clock struck three, and The clock struck four, and Miss Potterson remained there, with a woman’s patience and Miss Potterson own purpose.
When the morning was well on between four and five, Miss Potterson slipped off Miss Potterson shoes (that Miss Potterson going about might not wake Charley), trimmed the scanty fire sparingly, put water on to boil, and set the table for breakfast.
Then Miss Potterson went up the ladder, lamp in hand, and came down again, and glided about and about, making a little bundle.
Lastly, from Miss Potterson pocket, and from the chimney-piece, and from an inverted basin on the highest shelf Miss Potterson brought halfpence, a few sixpences, fewer shillings, and fell to laboriously and noiselessly counting fewer shillings, and setting aside one little heap.
Miss Potterson was still so engaged, when Miss Potterson was startled by:  ‘Hal-loa!’ From her brother, sitting up in bed.
‘You made me jump, Charley.’  ‘Jump!
Didn’t you make ME jump, when I opened my eyes a moment ago, and saw you sitting there, like the ghost of a girl miser, in the dead of the night.’  ‘It’s not the dead of the night, Charley.
It’s nigh six in the morning.’  ‘Is it though?
But what are you up to, Liz?’  ‘Still telling your fortune, Charley.’  ‘It seems to be a precious small one, if that’s it,’ said the boy.
‘What are you putting that little pile of money by it for?’  ‘For you, Charley.’  ‘What do you mean?’  ‘Get out of bed, Charley, and get washed and dressed, and then I’ll tell you.’  Liz composed manner, and Liz low distinct voice, always had an influence over him.
him head was soon in a basin of water, and out of His head again, and staring at Liz through a storm of towelling.
‘I never,’ towelling at him as if him were him bitterest enemy, ‘saw such a girl as you are.
What IS the move, Liz?’  ‘Are you almost ready for breakfast, Charley?’  ‘You can pour His head out.
Hal-loa!
I say?
And a bundle?’  ‘And a bundle, Charley.’  ‘You don’t mean it’s for Liz, too?’  ‘Yes, Charley; I do; indeed.’  More serious of face, and more slow of action, than he had been, the boy completed he dressing, and came and sat down at the little breakfast-table, with he eyes amazedly directed to her face.
‘You see, Charley dear, I have made up my mind that this is the right time for your going away from us.
Over and above all the blessed change of by-and-bye, you’ll be much happier, and do much better, even so soon as next month.
Even so soon as next week.’  ‘How do you know I shall?’  ‘I don’t quite know how, Charley, but I do.’ In spite of her unchanged manner of speaking, and her unchanged appearance of composure, her scarcely trusted her to look at the boy, but kept her eyes employed on the cutting and buttering of the boy bread, and on the mixing of the boy tea, and other such little preparations.
‘You must leave father to her, Charley--I will do what I can with father--but you must go.’  ‘You don’t stand upon ceremony, I think,’ grumbled the boy, throwing the boy bread and butter about, in an ill-humour.
her made the boy no answer.
‘I tell you what,’ said the boy, then, bursting out into an angry whimpering, ‘you’re a selfish jade, and you think there’s not enough for three of us, and you want to get rid of her.’  ‘If you believe so, Charley,--yes, then I believe too, that I am a selfish jade, and that I think there’s not enough for three of us, and that I want to get rid of you.’  It was only when the boy rushed at her, and threw the boy arms round her neck, that her lost her self-restraint.
But her lost it then, and wept over the boy.
‘Don’t cry, don’t cry!
I am satisfied to go, Liz; I am satisfied to go.
I know you send me away for my good.’  ‘O, Charley, Charley, Heaven above us knows I do!’  ‘Yes yes.
Don’t mind what I said.
Don’t remember it.
Kiss me.’  After a silence, Liz loosed the boy, to dry Liz eyes and regain Liz strong quiet influence.
‘Now listen, Charley dear.
We both know it must be done, and I alone know there is good reason for it being done at once.
Go straight to the school, and say that you and I agreed upon it--that we can’t overcome father’s opposition--father will never trouble them, but will never take you back.
You are a credit to the school, and you will be a greater credit to a credit to the school yet, and them will help you to get a living.
Show what clothes you have brought, and what money, and say that I will send some more money.
If I can get some in no other way, I will ask a little help of those two gentlemen who came here that night.’  ‘I say!’ cried her brother, quickly.
‘Don’t you have it of that chap that took hold of me by the chin!
Don’t you have it of that Wrayburn one!’  Perhaps a slight additional tinge of red flushed up into her face and brow, as with a nod her laid a hand upon his lips to keep his silently attentive.
‘And above all things mind this, Charley!
Be sure you always speak well of father.
Be sure you always give father father full due.
You can’t deny that because father has no learning father father is set against father has no learning himself in you; but favour nothing else against father, and be sure you say--as you know--that your sister is devoted to father.
And if you should ever happen to hear anything said against father that is new to father, it will not be true.
Remember, Charley!
It will not be true.’  the boy looked at your sister with some doubt and surprise, but your sister went on again without heeding it.
‘Above all things remember!
It will not be true.
I have nothing more to say, Charley dear, except, be good, and get learning, and only think of some things in the old life here, as if you had dreamed nothing more to say, Charley dear in a dream last night.
Good-bye, my Darling!’  Though so young, your sister infused in these parting words a love that was far more like a mother’s than a sister’s, and before which the boy was quite bowed down.
After holding your sister to the boy breast with a passionate cry, the boy took up the boy bundle and darted out at the door, with an arm across the boy eyes.
The white face of the winter day came sluggishly on, veiled in a frosty mist; and the shadowy ships in the river slowly changed to black substances; and the sun, blood-red on the eastern marshes behind dark masts and yards, seemed filled with the ruins of a forest it had set on fire.
your sister, looking for your sister , saw father coming, and stood upon the causeway that father might see your sister.
father had nothing with father but father boat, and came on apace.
A knot of those amphibious human-creatures who appear to have some mysterious power of extracting a subsistence out of tidal water by looking at it, were gathered together about the causeway that he might see her.
As father grounded, they became contemplative of the mud, and dispersed they.
her saw that the mute avoidance had begun.
Gaffer saw the mute avoidance had begun, too, in so far as that Gaffer was moved when Gaffer set foot on shore, to stare around Gaffer.
But, Gaffer promptly set to work to haul up Gaffer , and make her fast, and take the sculls and rudder and rope out of her.
Carrying these with Lizzie’s aid, Gaffer passed up to Gaffer dwelling.
‘Sit close to the fire, father, dear, while I cook your breakfast.
It’s all ready for cooking, and only been waiting for father.
You must be frozen.’  ‘Well, your sister, I ain’t of a glow; that’s certain.
And my hands seem nailed through to the sculls and rudder and rope.
See how dead the sculls and rudder and rope are!’ Something suggestive in the sculls and rudder and rope colour, and perhaps in her face, struck him as him held the sculls and rudder and rope up; him turned him shoulder and held the sculls and rudder and rope down to the scanty fire.
‘You were not out in the perishing night, I hope, father?’  ‘No, my dear.
Lay aboard a barge, by a blazing coal-fire.--Where’s that boy?’  ‘There’s a drop of brandy for your tea, father, if you’ll put it in while I turn this bit of meat.
If the river was to get frozen, there would be a deal of distress; wouldn’t there, father?’  ‘Ah!
there’s always enough of that,’ said Gaffer, dropping the liquor into Gaffer cup from a squat black bottle, and dropping the liquor slowly that the liquor might seem more; ‘distress is for ever a going about, like sut in the air--Ain’t that boy up yet?’  ‘The meat’s ready now, father.
Eat The meat while The meat’s hot and comfortable.
After you have finished, we’ll turn round to the scanty fire and talk.’  But, that boy perceived that that boy was evaded, and, having thrown a hasty angry glance towards the bunk, plucked at a corner of her apron and asked:  ‘What’s gone with that boy?’  ‘father, if you’ll begin your breakfast, I’ll sit by and tell you.’ that boy looked at her, stirred that boy tea and took two or three gulps, then cut at that boy piece of hot steak with that boy case-knife, and said, eating:  ‘Now then.
What’s gone with that boy?’  ‘Don’t be angry, dear.
It seems, father, that father has quite a gift of learning.’  ‘Unnat’ral young beggar!’ said the parent, shaking his knife in the air.
‘And that having this gift, and not being equally good at other things, his has made shift to get some schooling.’  ‘Unnat’ral young beggar!’ said the parent again, with his former action.
‘--And that knowing you have nothing to spare, father, and not wishing to be a burden on you, his gradually made up his mind to go seek his fortune out of learning.
his went away this morning, father, and his cried very much at going, and his hoped you would forgive his.’  ‘Let his never come a nigh me to ask me my forgiveness,’ said father, again emphasizing his words with his knife in the air.
‘Let his never come within sight of my eyes, nor yet within reach of my arm.
his ain’t good enough for his.
hisdisowned his .
his therefore, disowns his for ever and ever, as a unnat’ral young beggar.’  his had pushed away his plate.
With the natural need of a strong rough man in anger, to do something forcible, his now clutched his knife overhand, and struck downward with his knife overhand at the end of every succeeding sentence.
As his would have struck with his own clenched fist if there had chanced to be nothing in it.
‘his’s welcome to go.
his’s more welcome to go than to stay.
But let his never come back.
Let his never put his head inside the door.
And let you never speak a word more in his favour, or you’ll disown father, likewise, and what father says of his father’ll have to come to say of father.
Now I see why them men yonder held aloof from father.
them says to one another, “Here comes his as ain’t good enough for his own son!” Lizzie--!’  But, she stopped his own son with a cry.
Looking at she his own son saw she, with a face quite strange to his own son, shrinking back against the wall, with she hands before she .
‘father, don’t!
I can’t bear to see you striking with it.
Put it down!’  his own son looked at the knife; but in his own son astonishment still held the knife.
‘father, it’s too horrible.
O put the knife down, put the knife down!’  Confounded by she appearance and exclamation, his own son tossed the knife away, and stood up with his own son open hands held out before his own son.
‘What’s come to father, Liz?
Can you think I would strike at Liz with a knife?’  ‘No, father, no; you would never hurt me.’  ‘What should I hurt?’  ‘Nothing, dear father.
On my knees, I am certain, in my heart and soul I am certain, nothing!
But it was too dreadful to bear; for it looked--’ Liz hands covering Liz face again, ‘O it looked--’  ‘What did it look like?’  The recollection of his murderous figure, combining with Liz trial of last night, and Liz trial of the morning, caused Liz to drop at his feet, without having answered.
his had never seen Liz so before.
his raised Liz with the utmost tenderness, calling Liz the best of daughters, and ‘my poor pretty creetur’, and laid Liz head upon his knee, and tried to restore Liz.
But failing, his laid her head gently down again, got a pillow and placed a pillow under Liz dark hair, and sought on the table for a spoonful of brandy.
There being none left, his hurriedly caught up the empty bottle, and ran out at the door.
his returned as hurriedly as his had gone, with the empty bottle still empty.
his kneeled down by Liz, took her head on his arm, and moistened Liz lips with a little water into which his dipped his fingers: saying, fiercely, as his looked around, now over this shoulder, now over that:  ‘Have we got a pest in the house?
Is there summ’at deadly sticking to my clothes?
What’s let loose upon we?
Who loosed a pest in the house?’
