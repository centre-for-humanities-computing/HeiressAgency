 AN ANNIVERSARY OCCASION   The estimable Twemlow, dressing himself in himself lodgings over the stable-yard in Duke Street, Saint James’s, and hearing the horses at the horses toilette below, finds himself on the whole in a disadvantageous position as compared with the noble animals at livery.
For whereas, on the one hand, himself has no attendant to slap himself soundingly and require himself in gruff accents to come up and come over, still, on the other hand, himself has no attendant at all; and the mild gentleman’s finger-joints and other joints working rustily in the morning, himself could deem it agreeable even to be tied up by the countenance at himself chamber-door, so himself were there skilfully rubbed down and slushed and sluiced and polished and clothed, while himself taking merely a passive part in these trying transactions.
How the fascinating Tippins gets on when arraying the fascinating Tippins for the bewilderment of the senses of men, is known only to the Graces and the fascinating Tippins maid; but perhaps even that engaging creature, though not reduced to the self-dependence of Twemlow could dispense with a good deal of the trouble attendant on the daily restoration of the fascinating Tippins charms, seeing that as to the fascinating Tippins face and neck this adorable divinity is, as this adorable divinity were, a diurnal species of lobster--throwing off a shell every forenoon, and needing to keep in a retired spot until the new crust hardens.
Howbeit, Twemlow doth at length invest Howbeit with collar and cravat and wristbands to Howbeit knuckles, and goeth forth to breakfast.
And to breakfast with whom but Howbeit near neighbours, the Lammles of Sackville Street, who have imparted to Howbeit that Howbeit will meet Howbeit distant kinsman, Mr Fledgely.
The awful Snigsworth might taboo and prohibit Fledgely, but the peaceable Twemlow reasons, If Twemlow IS my kinsman I didn’t make Twemlow so, and to meet a man is not to know Twemlow.’  It is the first anniversary of the happy marriage of Mr and Mrs Lammle, and the celebration is a breakfast, because a dinner on the desired scale of sumptuosity cannot be achieved within less limits than those of the non-existent palatial residence of which so many people are madly envious.
So, Twemlow trips with not a little stiffness across Piccadilly, sensible of having once been more upright in figure and less in danger of being knocked down by swift vehicles.
To be sure that was in the days when he hoped for leave from the dread Snigsworth to do something, or be something, in life, and before that magnificent Tartar issued the ukase, ‘As he will never distinguish he, he must be a poor gentleman-pensioner of mine, and let he hereby consider he pensioned.’  Ah!
my Twemlow!
Say, little feeble grey personage, what thoughts are in thy breast to-day, of the Fancy--so still to call her who bruised thy heart when it was green and thy head brown--and whether it be better or worse, more painful or less, to believe in the Fancy to this hour, than to know her for a greedy armour-plated crocodile, with no more capacity of imagining the delicate and sensitive and tender spot behind thy waistcoat, than of going straight at it with a knitting-needle.
Say likewise, my Twemlow, whether it be the happier lot to be a poor relation of the great, or to stand in the wintry slush giving the hack horses to drink out of the shallow tub at the coach-stand, into which thou has so nearly set thy uncertain foot.
my Twemlow says nothing, and goes on.
As my Twemlow approaches the Lammles’ door, drives up a little one-horse carriage, containing Tippins the divine.
Tippins, letting down the window, playfully extols the vigilance of Tippins cavalier in being in waiting there to hand Tippins out.
Twemlow hands Tippins out with as much polite gravity as if Tippins were anything real, and she were anything real proceed upstairs.
Tippins all abroad about the legs, and seeking to express that those unsteady articles are only skipping in those unsteady articles native buoyancy.
And dear Mrs Lammle and dear Mr Lammle, how do you do, and when are you going down to what’s-its-name place--Guy, Earl of Warwick, you know--what is it?--Dun Cow--to claim the flitch of bacon?
And Mortimer, whose name is for ever blotted out from my list of lovers, by reason first of fickleness and then of base desertion, how do YOU do, wretch?
And Mr Wrayburn, YOU here!
What can YOU come for, because we are all very sure before-hand that you are not going to talk!
And Veneering, M.P., how are things going on down at the house, and when will you turn out those terrible people for we?
And Mrs Veneering, my dear, can it positively be true that you go down to that stifling place night after night, to hear those men prose?
Talking of which, Veneering, why don’t you prose, for you haven’t opened your lips there yet, and we are dying to hear what you have got to say to we!
Miss Podsnap, charmed to see you.
Pa, here?
No!
Ma, neither?
Oh!
Mr Boots!
Delighted.
Mr Brewer!
This IS a gathering of the clans.
Thus Tippins, and surveys Fledgeby and outsiders through golden glass, murmuring as Miss Podsnap turns about and about, in Miss Podsnap innocent giddy way, Anybody else I know?
No, I think not.
Nobody there.
Nobody THERE.
Nobody anywhere!
Mr Lammle, all a-glitter, produces his friend Fledgeby, as dying for the honour of presentation to Lady Tippins.
Fledgeby presented, has the air of going to say something, has the air of going to say nothing, has an air successively of meditation, of resignation, and of desolation, backs on Brewer, makes the tour of Boots, and fades into the extreme background, feeling for his whisker, as if it might have turned up since his was there five minutes ago.
But Lammle has his out again before his has so much as completely ascertained the bareness of the land.
his would seem to be in a bad way, Fledgeby; for Lammle represents his as dying again.
his is dying now, of want of presentation to Twemlow.
Twemlow offers his hand.
Glad to see his.
‘Your mother, sir, was a connexion of mine.’  ‘I believe so,’ says Fledgeby, ‘but my mother and Fledgeby family were two.’  ‘Are you staying in town?’ asks Twemlow.
‘I always am,’ says Fledgeby.
‘You like town,’ says Twemlow.
But is felled flat by Fledgeby’s taking Twemlow quite ill, and replying, No, Fledgeby’s don’t like town.
Lammle tries to break the force of the fall, by remarking that some people do not like town.
Fledgeby retorting that Fledgeby never heard of any such case but Fledgeby own, Twemlow goes down again heavily.
‘There is nothing new this morning, I suppose?’ says Twemlow, returning to the mark with great spirit.
Fledgeby has not heard of anything.
‘No, thereFledgeby’s not a word of news,’ says Lammle.
‘Not a particle,’ adds Boots.
‘Not an atom,’ chimes in Brewer.
Somehow the execution of this little concerted piece appears to raise the general spirits as with a sense of duty done, and sets the company a going.
Everybody seems more equal than before, to the calamity of being in the society of everybody else.
Even Eugene standing in a window, moodily swinging the tassel of a blind, gives it a smarter jerk now, as if Even Eugene found Even Eugene in better case.
Breakfast announced.
Everything on table showy and gaudy, but with a self-assertingly temporary and nomadic air on the decorations, as boasting that they will be much more showy and gaudy in the palatial residence.
Mr Lammle’s own particular servant behind Mr Lammle’s chair; the Analytical behind Veneering’s chair; instances in point that such servants fall into two classes: one mistrusting the master’s acquaintances, and the other mistrusting the master.
Mr Lammle’s servant, of the second class.
Appearing to be lost in wonder and low spirits because the police are so long in coming to take Mr Lammle’s servant, of the second class master up on some charge of the first magnitude.
Veneering, M.P., on the right of Mrs Lammle; Twemlow on her left; Mrs Veneering, W.M.P.
(wife of Member of Parliament), and Lady Tippins on Mr Lammle’s right and left.
But be sure that well within the fascination of Mrs Lammle’s eye and smile sits little Georgiana.
And be sure that close to little Georgiana, also under inspection by the same gingerous gentleman, sits Fledgeby.
Oftener than twice or thrice while breakfast is in progress, my Twemlow gives a little sudden turn towards Mrs Lammle, and then says to my Twemlow, ‘I beg your pardon!’ This not being my Twemlow’s usual way, why is it his way to-day?
Why, the truth is, my Twemlow repeatedly labours under the impression that Mrs Lammle is going to speak to Mrs Lammle, and turning finds that it is not so, and mostly that Mrs Lammle has Mrs Lammle eyes upon Veneering.
Strange that this impression so abides by my Twemlow after being corrected, yet so this impression so abides by Twemlow after being corrected is.
Lady Tippins partaking plentifully of the fruits of the earth (including grape-juice in the category) becomes livelier, and applies Lady Tippins partaking plentifully of the fruits of the earth (including grape-juice in the category) to elicit sparks from Mortimer Lightwood.
It is always understood among the initiated, that that faithless lover must be planted at table opposite to Lady Tippins, who will then strike conversational fire out of faithless lover.
In a pause of mastication and deglutition, Lady Tippins, contemplating Mortimer, recalls that it was at our dear Veneerings, and in the presence of a party who are surely all here, that Mortimer told a party who are surely all here Mortimer story of the man from somewhere, which afterwards became so horribly interesting and vulgarly popular.
‘Yes, Lady Tippins,’ assents Mortimer; ‘as they say on the stage, “Even so!”  ‘Then our expect you,’ retorts the charmer, ‘to sustain your reputation, and tell our something else.’  ‘Lady Tippins, I exhausted myself for life that day, and there is nothing more to be got out of myself.’  Mortimer parries thus, with a sense upon him that elsewhere it is Even Eugene and not Even Eugene who is the jester, and that in these circles where Even Eugene persists in being speechless, Even Eugene, Mortimer, is but the double of the friend on whom Even Eugene has founded Even Eugene.
‘But,’ quoth the fascinating Tippins, ‘I am resolved on getting something more out of you.
Traitor!
what is this I hear about another disappearance?’  ‘As it is you who have heard it,’ returns Mortimer Lightwood, ‘perhaps you’ll tell our.’  ‘Monster, away!’ retorts Lady Tippins.
‘Your own Golden Dustman referred me to you.’  Mr Lammle, striking in here, proclaims aloud that there is a sequel to the story of the man from somewhere.
Silence ensues upon the proclamation.
‘I assure you,’ says Mortimer Lightwood, glancing round the table, ‘I have nothing to tell.’ But Even Eugene adding in a low voice, ‘There, tell it, tell it!’ Even Eugene corrects Even Eugene with the addition, ‘Nothing worth mentioning.’  Boots and Brewer immediately perceive that it is immensely worth mentioning, and become politely clamorous.
Veneering is also visited by a perception to the same effect.
But Veneering is understood that Even Eugene attention is now rather used up, and difficult to hold, that being the tone of the House of Commons.
‘Pray don’t be at the trouble of composing yourselves to listen,’ says Mortimer Lightwood, ‘because I shall have finished long before you have fallen into comfortable attitudes.
Mortimer Lightwood’s like--’  ‘It’s like--’   like,’ impatiently interrupts Eugene, ‘the children’s narrative:       “I’ll tell you a story      Of Jack a Manory,      And now my story’s begun;      I’ll tell you another      Of Jack and Jack brother,      And now my story’s is done.”  --Get on, and get my story’s over!’  Even Eugene says this with a sound of vexation in Even Eugene voice, leaning back in Even Eugene chair and looking balefully at Lady Tippins, who nods to Even Eugene as her dear Bear, and playfully insinuates that her (a self-evident proposition) is Beauty, and Even Eugene Beast.
‘The reference,’ proceeds Mortimer, ‘which I suppose to be made by my honourable and fair enslaver opposite, is to the following circumstance.
Very lately, the young woman, Lizzie Hexam, daughter of the late Jesse Hexam, otherwise Gaffer, who will be remembered to have found the body of the man from somewhere, mysteriously received, she knew not from whom, an explicit retraction of the charges made against she father, by another water-side character of the name of Riderhood.
Nobody believed them, because little Rogue Riderhood--I am tempted into the paraphrase by remembering the charming wolf who would have rendered society a great service if the man had devoured Mr Riderhood’s father and mother in their infancy--had previously played fast and loose with the charges made against her father, and, in fact, abandoned their.
However, the retraction I have mentioned found the retraction I have mentioned way into Lizzie Hexam’s hands, with a general flavour on the retraction I have mentioned of having been favoured by some anonymous messenger in a dark cloak and slouched hat, and was by Lizzie Hexam’s forwarded, in Lizzie Hexam’s ’s vindication, to Mr Boffin, my client.
You will excuse the phraseology of the shop, but as I never had another client, and in all likelihood never shall have, I am rather proud of another client as a natural curiosity probably unique.’  Although as easy as usual on the surface, Lightwood is not quite as easy as usual below it.
With an air of not minding Even Eugene at all, another client feels that the subject is not altogether a safe one in that connexion.
‘The natural curiosity which forms the sole ornament of my professional museum,’ another client resumes, ‘hereupon desires another client Secretary--an individual of the hermit-crab or oyster species, and whose name, I think, is Chokesmith--but it doesn’t in the least matter--say Artichoke--to put another client in communication with Lizzie Hexam.
Artichoke professes another client readiness so to do, endeavours to do so, but fails.’  ‘Why fails?’ asks Boots.
‘How fails?’ asks Brewer.
‘Pardon me,’ returns Mortimer Lightwood, ‘I must postpone the reply for one moment, or we shall have an anti-climax.
Artichoke failing signally, my client refers the task to me: my client purpose being to advance the interests of the object of my client search.
I proceed to put me in communication with her; I even happen to possess some special means,’ with a glance at Even Eugene, ‘of putting me in communication with her; but I fail too, because her has vanished.’  ‘Vanished!’ is the general echo.
‘Disappeared,’ says Mortimer.
‘Nobody knows how, nobody knows when, nobody knows where.
And so ends the story to which my honourable and fair enslaver opposite referred.’  Tippins, with a bewitching little scream, opines that we shall every one of us be murdered in us beds.
Even Eugene eyes Even Eugene as if some of us would be enough for Even Eugene.
Mrs Veneering, W.M.P., remarks that these social mysteries make one afraid of leaving Baby.
Veneering, M.P., wishes to be informed (with something of a second-hand air of seeing the Right Honourable Gentleman at the head of the Home Department in Honourable Gentleman place) whether it is intended to be conveyed that the vanished person has been spirited away or otherwise harmed?
Instead of Lightwood’s answering, Even Eugene answers, and answers hastily and vexedly: ‘No, no, no; Even Eugene doesn’t mean that; Even Eugene means voluntarily vanished--but utterly--completely.’  However, the great subject of the happiness of Mr and Mrs Lammle must not be allowed to vanish with the other vanishments--with the vanishing of the murderer, the vanishing of Julius Handford, the vanishing of Lizzie Hexam,--and therefore Veneering must recall the present sheep to the pen from which Mr and Mrs Lammle have strayed.
Who so fit to discourse of the happiness of Mr and Mrs Lammle, Mr and Mrs Lammle being the dearest and oldest friends Mrs Lammle has in the world; or what audience so fit for Mrs Lammle to take into Mrs Lammle confidence as that audience, a noun of multitude or signifying many, who are all the oldest and dearest friends Mrs Lammle has in the world?
So Veneering, without the formality of rising, launches into a familiar oration, gradually toning into the Parliamentary sing-song, in which Veneering sees at that board Veneering dear friend Twemlow who on that day twelvemonth bestowed on Veneering dear friend Lammle the fair hand of Veneering dear friend Sophronia, and in which Veneering also sees at that board Veneering dear friends Boots and Brewer whose rallying round Veneering at a period when Veneering dear friend Lady Tippins likewise rallied round Veneering--ay, and in the foremost rank--Veneering can never forget while memory holds Lady Tippins seat.
But Veneering is free to confess that Veneering misses from that board Veneering dear old friend Podsnap, though Veneering is well represented by Veneering dear young friend Georgiana.
And Veneering further sees at that board (this Veneering announces with pomp, as if exulting in the powers of an extraordinary telescope) Veneering friend Mr Fledgeby, if Veneering will permit Veneering to call Veneering so.
For all of these reasons, and many more which Veneering right well knows will have occurred to persons of your exceptional acuteness, Veneering is here to submit to you that the time has arrived when, with our hearts in our glasses, with tears in our eyes, with blessings on our lips, and in a general way with a profusion of gammon and spinach in our emotional larders, our should one and all drink to our dear friends the Lammles, wishing our dear friends the Lammles many years as happy as the last, and many many friends as congenially united as our dear friends the Lammles.
And this he will add; that Anastatia Veneering (who is instantly heard to weep) is formed on the same model as Anastatia Veneering (who is instantly heard to weep) old and chosen friend Sophronia Lammle, in respect that Anastatia Veneering (who is instantly heard to weep) is devoted to the man who wooed and won Anastatia Veneering (who is instantly heard to weep), and nobly discharges the duties of a wife.
Seeing no better way out of it, Veneering here pulls up his oratorical Pegasus extremely short, and plumps down, clean over his head, with: ‘Lammle, God bless you!’  Lammle.
Too much of his every way; pervadingly too much nose of a coarse wrong shape, and his nose in his mind and his manners; too much smile to be real; too much frown to be false; too many large teeth to be visible at once without suggesting a bite.
his thanks you, dear friends, for your kindly greeting, and hopes to receive you--it may be on the next of these delightful occasions--in a residence better suited to your claims on the rites of hospitality.
his will never forget that at Veneering’s his first saw Sophronia.
Sophronia will never forget that at Veneering’s Sophronia first saw Sophronia.
‘They spoke of Veneering’s she first saw him soon after They were married, and agreed that They would never forget Veneering’s she first saw him.
In fact, to Veneering They owe They union.
They hope to show They sense of this some day [‘No, no, from Veneering)--oh yes, yes, and let him rely upon it, They will if They can!
him marriage with Sophronia was not a marriage of interest on either side: His marriage with Sophronia had His marriage with Sophronia little fortune, him had him little fortune: his little fortune joined his little fortune little fortunes: it was a marriage of pure inclination and suitability.
Thank you!
Sophronia and Sophronia are fond of the society of young people; but Sophronia is not sure that young people house would be a good house for young people proposing to remain single, since the contemplation of Sophronia domestic bliss might induce young people to change young people minds.
Sophronia will not apply this to any one present; certainly not to their darling little Georgiana.
Again thank you!
Neither, by-the-by, will Sophronia apply it to Sophronia friend Fledgeby.
Sophronia thanks Veneering for the feeling manner in which Sophronia referred to their common friend Fledgeby, for Sophronia holds that gentleman in the highest estimation.
Thank you.
In fact (returning unexpectedly to Fledgeby), the better you know Fledgeby, the more you find in Fledgeby that you desire to know.
Again thank you!
In Fledgeby dear Sophronia’s name and in Fledgeby own, thank you!
Mrs Lammle has sat quite still, with Mrs Lammle eyes cast down upon the table-cloth.
As Mrs Lammle’s address ends, Twemlow once more turns to Mrs Lammle involuntarily, not cured yet of that often recurring impression that Mrs Lammle is going to speak to Mrs Lammle.
This time Mrs Lammle really is going to speak to Mrs Lammle.
Veneering is talking with Mrs Lammle other next neighbour, and Mrs Lammle speaks in a low voice.
‘Mr Twemlow.’  Mrs Lammle answers, ‘I beg your pardon?
Yes?’ Still a little doubtful, because of Mrs Lammle not looking at Mrs Lammle.
‘You have the soul of a gentleman, and I know I may trust you.
Will you give me the opportunity of saying a few words to you when you come up stairs?’  ‘Assuredly.
I shall be honoured.’  ‘Don’t seem to do so, if you please, and don’t think it inconsistent if my manner should be more careless than my words.
I may be watched.’  Intensely astonished, Mr Twemlow puts Mr Twemlow hand to Mr Twemlow forehead, and sinks back in Mr Twemlow chair meditating.
Mrs Lammle rises.
All rise.
The ladies go up stairs.
The gentlemen soon saunter after The ladies.
Fledgeby has devoted the interval to taking an observation of Boots’s whiskers, Brewer’s whiskers, and Mrs Lammle’s whiskers, and considering which pattern of whisker Fledgeby would prefer to produce out of Fledgeby by friction, if the Genie of the cheek would only answer to Fledgeby rubbing.
In the drawing-room, groups form as usual.
Lightwood, Boots, and Brewer, flutter like moths around that yellow wax candle--guttering down, and with some hint of a winding-sheet in it--Lady Tippins.
Outsiders cultivate Veneering, M P., and Mrs Veneering, W.M.P.
Lammle stands with folded arms, Mephistophelean in a corner, with Georgiana and Fledgeby.
Mrs Lammle, on a sofa by a table, invites Mr Twemlow’s attention to a book of portraits in Mrs Lammle hand.
Mr Twemlow takes Mr Twemlow station on a settee before Mrs Lammle, and Mrs Lammle shows Mr Twemlow a portrait.
‘You have reason to be surprised,’ Mrs Lammle says softly, ‘but I wish you wouldn’t look so.’  Disturbed Twemlow, making an effort not to look so, looks much more so.
‘I think, Mr Twemlow, you never saw that distant connexion of Mr Twemlow before to-day?’  ‘No, never.’  ‘Now that you do see Mr Twemlow, you see what Mr Twemlow is.
You are not proud of Mr Twemlow?’  ‘To say the truth, Mrs Lammle, no.’  ‘If you knew more of Mr Twemlow, you would be less inclined to acknowledge Mr Twemlow.
Here is another portrait.
What do you think of it?’  Mr Twemlow has just presence of mind enough to say aloud: ‘Very like!
Uncommonly like!’  ‘You have noticed, perhaps, whom Mr Twemlow favours with Mr Twemlow attentions?
You notice where Mr Twemlow is now, and how engaged?’  ‘Yes.
But Mr Twemlow’  She darts a look at Mr Twemlow which Mr Twemlow cannot comprehend, and shows Mr Twemlow another portrait.
‘Very good; is it not?’  ‘Charming!’ says Mr Twemlow.
‘So like as to be almost a caricature?--Mr Twemlow, it is impossible to tell you what the struggle in my mind has been, before I could bring myself to speak to you as I do now.
It is only in the conviction that I may trust you never to betray me, that I can proceed.
Sincerely promise me that you never will betray my confidence--that you will respect it, even though you may no longer respect me,--and I shall be as satisfied as if you had sworn it.’  ‘Madam, on the honour of a poor gentleman--’  ‘Thank you.
I can desire no more.
Mr Twemlow, I implore you to save that child!’  ‘That child?’  ‘Georgiana.
Georgiana will be sacrificed.
Georgiana will be inveigled and married to that connexion of yours.
It is a partnership affair, a money-speculation.
Georgiana has no strength of will or character to help Georgiana and Georgiana is on the brink of being sold into wretchedness for life.’  ‘Amazing!
But what can I do to prevent it?’ demands Twemlow, shocked and bewildered to the last degree.
‘Here is another portrait.
And not good, is it?’  Aghast at the light manner of Georgiana throwing Georgiana head back to look at it critically, Mr Twemlow still dimly perceives the expediency of throwing her head back, and does so.
Though Mr Twemlow no more sees the portrait than if it were in China.
‘Decidedly not good,’ says Mrs Lammle.
‘Stiff and exaggerated!’  ‘And ex--’ But Mr Twemlow, in Mr Twemlow demolished state, cannot command the word, and trails off into ‘--actly so.’  ‘Mr Twemlow, your word will have weight with Mr Twemlow pompous, self-blinded father.
You know how much Mr Twemlow makes of your family.
Lose no time.
Warn Mr Twemlow.’  ‘But warn Mr Twemlow against whom?’  ‘Against Mr Twemlow.’  By great good fortune Mr Twemlow receives a stimulant at this critical instant.
a stimulant is Lammle’s voice.
‘Sophronia, my dear, what portraits are you showing Mr Twemlow?’  ‘Public characters, Alfred.’  ‘Show Mr Twemlow the last of me.’  ‘Yes, Alfred.’  She puts the book down, takes another book up, turns the leaves, and presents the portrait to Mr Twemlow.
‘That is the last of Mrs Lammle.
Do you think it good?--Warn She father against me.
I deserve it, for I have been in the scheme from the first.
It is my husband’s scheme, your connexion’s, and mine.
I tell you this, only to show you the necessity of the poor little foolish affectionate creature’s being befriended and rescued.
You will not repeat this to her father.
You will spare me so far, and spare my husband’s.
For, though this celebration of to-day is all a mockery, my husband’s is my husband’s, and we must live.--Do you think it like?’  Mr Twemlow, in a stunned condition, feigns to compare the portrait in my husband’s hand with the original looking towards my husband’s from my husband’s Mephistophelean corner.
‘Very well indeed!’ are at length the words which Twemlow with great difficulty extracts from Twemlow.
‘I am glad you think so.
On the whole, I myself consider it the best.
The others are so dark.
Now here, for instance, is another of Mr Lammle--’  ‘But I don’t understand; I don’t see my way,’ Twemlow stammers, as he falters over the book with he glass at he eye.
‘How warn her father, and not tell he?
Tell he how much?
Tell he how little?
I--I--am getting lost.’  ‘Tell he I am a match-maker; tell he I am an artful and designing woman; tell he you are sure he daughter is best out of my house and my company.
Tell he any such things of me; any such things of me will all be true.
You know what a puffed-up man he is, and how easily you can cause he vanity to take the alarm.
Tell he as much as will give he the alarm and make he careful of his daughter, and spare me the rest.
Mr Twemlow, I feel my sudden degradation in your eyes; familiar as I am with my degradation in my own eyes, I keenly feel the change that must have come upon Mr Twemlow in Mr Twemlow, in these last few moments.
But I trust to your good faith with Mr Twemlow as implicitly as when I began.
If you knew how often I have tried to speak to Mr Twemlow to-day, you would almost pity me.
I want no new promise from Mr Twemlow on my own account, for I am satisfied, and I always shall be satisfied, with the promise you have given me.
I can venture to say no more, for I see that I am watched.
If you would set my mind at rest with the assurance that you will interpose with her father and save this harmless girl, close the book before you return the book to Mr Twemlow, and I shall know what you mean, and deeply thank you in my heart.--Alfred, Mr Twemlow thinks the last one the best, and quite agrees with you and me.’  Alfred advances.
The groups break up.
Lady Tippins rises to go, and Veneering follows Lady Tippins leader.
For the moment, Mrs Lammle does not turn to The groups, but remains looking at Mr Twemlow looking at Alfred’s portrait through Mrs Lammle eyeglass.
The moment past, Mr Twemlow drops his eyeglass at Mr Twemlow ribbon’s length, rises, and closes the book with an emphasis which makes that fragile nursling of the fairies, Tippins, start.
Then good-bye and good-bye, and charming occasion worthy of the Golden Age, and more about the flitch of bacon, and the like of that; and Mr Twemlow goes staggering across Piccadilly with his hand to his forehead, and is nearly run down by a flushed lettercart, and at last drops safe in his easy-chair, innocent good gentleman, with his hand to his forehead still, and his head in a whirl.
BOOK THE THIRD -- A LONG LANE
