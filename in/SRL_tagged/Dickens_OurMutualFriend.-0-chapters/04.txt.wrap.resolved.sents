 THE R. WILFER FAMILY   Reginald Wilfer is a name with rather a grand sound, suggesting on first acquaintance brasses in country churches, scrolls in stained-glass windows, and generally the De Wilfers who came over with the Conqueror.
For, it is a remarkable fact in genealogy that no De Any ones ever came over with Anybody else.
But, the Reginald Wilfer family were of such commonplace extraction and pursuits that the Reginald Wilfer family forefathers had for generations modestly subsisted on the Docks, the Excise Office, and the Custom House, and  THE R. WILFER FAMILY   Reginald Wilfer  THE R. WILFER FAMILY   Reginald Wilfer was a poor clerk.
So poor a clerk, though having a limited salary and an unlimited family, that he had never yet attained the modest object of he ambition: which was, to wear a complete new suit of clothes, hat and boots included, at one time.
he black hat was brown before he could afford a coat, he pantaloons were white at the seams and knees before he could buy a pair of boots, he boots had worn out before he could treat he to new pantaloons, and, by the time he worked round to His black hat again, that shining modern article roofed-in an ancient ruin of various periods.
If the conventional Cherub could ever grow up and be clothed, he might be photographed as a portrait of Wilfer.
he chubby, smooth, innocent appearance was a reason for he being always treated with condescension when he was not put down.
A stranger entering he own poor house at about ten o’clock P.M. might have been surprised to find he sitting up to supper.
So boyish was he in he curves and proportions, that he old schoolmaster meeting he in Cheapside, might have been unable to withstand the temptation of caning he on the spot.
In short, he was the conventional Cherub, after the supposititious shoot just mentioned, rather grey, with signs of care on he expression, and in decidedly insolvent circumstances.
he was shy, and unwilling to own to the name of Reginald, as being too aspiring and self-assertive a name.
In he signature he used only the initial R., and imparted what it really stood for, to none but chosen friends, under the seal of confidence.
Out of this, the facetious habit had arisen in the neighbourhood surrounding Mincing Lane of making christian names for he of adjectives and participles beginning with R. Some of these were more or less appropriate: as Rusty, Retiring, Ruddy, Round, Ripe, Ridiculous, Ruminative; others, derived their point from their want of application: as Raging, Rattling, Roaring, Raffish.
But, his popular name was Rumty, which in a moment of inspiration had been bestowed upon his by a gentleman of convivial habits connected with the drug-markets, as the beginning of a social chorus, his leading part in the execution of which had led this gentleman to the Temple of Fame, and of which the whole expressive burden ran:       ‘Rumty iddity, row dow dow,      Sing toodlely, teedlely, bow wow wow.’  Thus his was constantly addressed, even in minor notes on business, as ‘Dear Rumty’; in answer to which, his sedately signed his, ‘Yours truly, R. Wilfer.’  his was clerk in the drug-house of Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles.
Chicksey and Stobbles, his former masters, had both become absorbed in Veneering, once both traveller or commission agent: who had signalized his accession to supreme power by bringing into the business a quantity of plate-glass window and French-polished mahogany partition, and a gleaming and enormous doorplate.
R. Wilfer locked up R. Wilfer desk one evening, and, putting R. Wilfer bunch of keys in R. Wilfer pocket much as if it were R. Wilfer peg-top, made for home.
R. Wilfer home was in the Holloway region north of London, and then divided from His home by fields and trees.
Between Battle Bridge and that part of the Holloway district in which R. Wilfer dwelt, was a tract of suburban Sahara, where tiles and bricks were burnt, bones were boiled, carpets were beat, rubbish was shot, dogs were fought, and dust was heaped by contractors.
Skirting the border of this desert, by the way R. Wilfer took, when the light of its kiln-fires made lurid smears on the fog, R. Wilfer sighed and shook R. Wilfer head.
‘Ah me!’ said R. Wilfer, ‘what might have been is not what is!’  With which commentary on human life, indicating an experience of it not exclusively his own, his made the best of his way to the end of his journey.
R. Wilfer was, of course, a tall woman and an angular.
R. Wilfer lord being cherubic, R. Wilfer was necessarily majestic, according to the principle which matrimonially unites contrasts.
R. Wilfer was much given to tying up R. Wilfer head in a pocket-handkerchief, knotted under the chin.
This head-gear, in conjunction with a pair of gloves worn within doors, R. Wilfer seemed to consider as at once a kind of armour against misfortune (invariably assuming it when in low spirits or difficulties), and as a species of full dress.
It was therefore with some sinking of the spirit that R. Wilfer husband beheld R. Wilfer thus heroically attired, putting down R. Wilfer candle in the little hall, and coming down the doorsteps through the little front court to open the gate for her husband.
Something had gone wrong with the house-door, for R. Wilfer stopped on the steps, staring at the steps, and cried:  ‘Hal-loa?’  ‘Yes,’ said R. Wilfer, ‘the man came the man with a pair of pincers, and took it off, and took it away.
the man said that as the man had no expectation of ever being paid for it, and as the man had an order for another LADIES’ SCHOOL door-plate, it was better (burnished up) for the interests of all parties.’  ‘Perhaps it was, my dear; what do you think?’  ‘You are master here, R. W.,’ returned R. W. wife.
‘It is as you think; not as I do.
Perhaps it might have been better if the man had taken the house-door too?’  ‘my dear, we couldn’t have done without the house-door.’  ‘Couldn’t we?’  ‘Why, my dear!
Could we?’  ‘It is as you think, R. W.; not as I do.’ With those submissive words, his wife preceded the man down a few stairs to a little basement front room, half kitchen, half parlour, where a girl of about nineteen, with an exceedingly pretty figure and face, but with an impatient and petulant expression both in his wife face and in his wife shoulders (which in his wife sex and at his wife age are very expressive of discontent), sat playing draughts with a younger girl, who was the youngest of the House of Wilfer.
Not to encumber this page by telling off the Wilfers in detail and casting them up in the gross, it is enough for the present that the rest were what is called ‘out in the world,’ in various ways, and that them were Many.
So many, that when one of his dutiful children called in to see his, R. Wilfer generally seemed to say to R. Wilfer, after a little mental arithmetic, ‘Oh!
here’s another of ‘em!’ before adding aloud, ‘How de do, John,’ or Susan, as the case might be.
‘Well Piggywiggies,’ said R. W., ‘how de do to-night?
What I was thinking of, my dear,’ to R. Wilfer already seated in a corner with folded gloves, ‘was, that as we have let we first floor so well, and as we have now no place in which you could teach pupils even if pupils--’  ‘The milkman said The milkman knew of two young ladies of the highest respectability who were in search of a suitable establishment, and The milkman took a card,’ interposed R. Wilfer, with severe monotony, as if R. Wilfer were reading an Act of Parliament aloud.
‘Tell your father whether it was last Monday, Bella.’  ‘But we never heard any more of it, ma,’ said Bella, the elder girl.
‘In addition to which, my dear,’ R. Wilfer husband urged, ‘if you have no place to put two young persons into--’  ‘Pardon me,R.
Wilfer R. Wilfer again interposed; ‘they were not young persons.
Two young ladies of the highest respectability.
Tell your father, Bella, whether The milkman said so.’  ‘my dear, it is the same thing.’  ‘No it is not,’ said R. Wilfer, with the same impressive monotony.
‘Pardon me!’  ‘I mean, my dear, it is the same thing as to space.
As to space.
If you have no space in which to put two youthful fellow-creatures, however eminently respectable, which I do not doubt, where are those youthful fellow-creatures to be accommodated?
I carry it no further than that.
And solely looking at it,’ said her husband, making the stipulation at once in a conciliatory, complimentary, and argumentative tone--‘as I am sure you will agree, my love--from a fellow-creature point of view, my dear.’  ‘I have nothing more to say,’ returned R. Wilfer, with a meek renunciatory action of R. Wilfer gloves.
‘It is as you think, R. W.; not as I do.’  Here, the huffing of Bella and the loss of three of Bella men at a swoop, aggravated by the coronation of an opponent, led to that young lady’s jerking the draught-board and pieces off the table: which Bella sister went down on her sister knees to pick up.
‘Bella!’ said R. Wilfer.
‘And poor Lavinia, perhaps, my my dear?’ suggested R. W.  ‘Pardon me,’ said R. Wilfer, ‘no!’  It was one of the worthy woman’s specialities that the worthy woman had an amazing power of gratifying the worthy woman splenetic or worldly-minded humours by extolling the worthy woman own family: which the worthy woman thus proceeded, in the present case, to do.
‘No, R. W. Lavinia has not known the trial that Bella has known.
The trial that your daughter Bella has undergone, is, perhaps, without a parallel, and has been borne, I will say, Nobly.
When you see your daughter Bella in your daughter Bella black dress, which your daughter Bella alone of all the family wears, and when you remember the circumstances which have led to your daughter Bella wearing it, and when you know how the circumstances which have led to her wearing it have been sustained, then, R. W.  , lay your head upon your pillow and say, R. W. LaviniaR.
W. Lavinia!”’  Here, R. W. Lavinia, from R. W. Lavinia kneeling situation under the table, put in that R. W. Lavinia didn’t want to be ‘poored by pa’, or anybody else.
‘I am sure you do not, my dear,’ returned R. W. Lavinia mother, ‘for you have a fine brave spirit.
And your sister Cecilia has a fine brave spirit of another kind, a spirit of pure devotion, a beau-ti-ful spirit!
The self-sacrifice of your sister Cecilia reveals a pure and womanly character, very seldom equalled, never surpassed.
I have now in my pocket a letter from your sister Cecilia, received this morning--received three months after your sister Cecilia marriage, poor child!--in which your sister Cecilia tells me that your sister Cecilia husband must unexpectedly shelter under their roof her husband reduced aunt.
“But I will be true to her husband, mamma,” your sister Cecilia touchingly writes, “I will not leave her husband, I must not forget that her husband is my husband.
Let his reduced aunt come!” If this is not pathetic, if this is not woman’s devotion--!’ that young lady’s waved that young lady’s gloves in a sense of the impossibility of saying more, and tied the pocket-handkerchief over that young lady’s head in a tighter knot under that young lady’s chin.
Bella, who was now seated on the rug to warm that young lady’s, with that young lady’s brown eyes on the fire and a handful of that young lady’s brown curls in that young lady’s mouth, laughed at this, and then pouted and half cried.
‘I am sure,’ said that young lady’s, ‘though you have no feeling for that young lady’s, pa, I am one of the most unfortunate girls that ever lived.
You know how poor we are’ (it is probable he did, having some reason to know it!
), ‘and what a glimpse of wealth I had, and how it melted away, and how I am here in this ridiculous mourning--which I hate!--a kind of a widow who never was married.
And yet you don’t feel for me.--Yes you do, yes you do.’  This abrupt change was occasioned by that young lady’s father’s face.
that young lady’s stopped to pull her father’s face down from her father’s face chair in an attitude highly favourable to strangulation, and to give her father’s face a kiss and a pat or two on the cheek.
‘But you ought to feel for that young lady’s, you know, pa.’  ‘My dear, I do.’  ‘Yes, and I say you ought to.
If they had only left me alone and told me nothing about it, it would have mattered much less.
But that nasty Mr Lightwood feels it Mr Lightwood duty, as Mr Lightwood says, to write and tell me what is in reserve for Mr Lightwood, and then I am obliged to get rid of George Sampson.’  Here, R. W. Lavinia, rising to the surface with the last draughtman rescued, interposed, ‘You never cared for George Sampson, Bella.’  ‘And did I say I did, miss?’ Then, pouting again, with the curls in her mouth; ‘George Sampson was very fond of that young lady’s, and admired me very much, and put up with everything I did to George Sampson.’  ‘You were rude enough to George Sampson,’ R. W. Lavinia again interposed.
‘And did I say I wasn’t, miss?
I am not setting up to be sentimental about George Sampson.
I only say George Sampson was better than nothing.’  ‘You didn’t show George Sampson that you thought even that,’ Lavinia again interposed.
‘You are a chit and a little idiot,’ returned Bella, ‘or you wouldn’t make such a dolly speech.
What did you expect me to do?
Wait till you are a woman, and don’t talk about what you don’t understand.
You only show your ignorance!’ Then, whimpering again, and at intervals biting the curls, and stopping to look how much was bitten off, ‘It’s a shame!
There never was such a hard case!
I shouldn’t care so much if it wasn’t so ridiculous.
It was ridiculous enough to have a stranger coming over to marry me, whether he liked it or not.
It was ridiculous enough to know what an embarrassing meeting it would be, and how we never could pretend to have an inclination of we own, either of we.
It was ridiculous enough to know I shouldn’t like George Sampson--how COULD I like George Sampson, left to George Sampson in a will, like a dozen of spoons, with everything cut and dried beforehand, like orange chips.
Talk of orange flowers indeed!
I declare again it’s a shame!
Those ridiculous points would have been smoothed away by the money, for I love money, and want money--want it dreadfully.
I hate to be poor, and we are degradingly poor, offensively poor, miserably poor, beastly poor.
But here I am, left with all the ridiculous parts of the situation remaining, and, added to them all, this ridiculous dress!
And if the truth was known, when the Harmon murder was all over the town, and people were speculating on the town being suicide, I dare say those impudent wretches at the clubs and places made jokes about the miserable creature’s having preferred a watery grave to me.
It’s likely enough they took such liberties; I shouldn’t wonder!
I declare It’s a very hard case indeed, and I am a most unfortunate girl.
The idea of being a kind of a widow, and never having been married!
And the idea of being as poor as ever after all, and going into black, besides, for a man I never saw, and should have hated--as far as a man I never saw was concerned--if I had seen!’  The young lady’s lamentations were checked at this point by a knuckle, knocking at the half-open door of the room.
a knuckle had knocked two or three times already, but had not been heard.
‘Who is it?’ said Mrs Wilfer, in Mrs Wilfer Act-of-Parliament manner.
‘Enter!’  A gentleman coming in, Miss Bella, with a short and sharp exclamation, scrambled off the hearth-rug and massed the bitten curls together in A gentleman coming in, Miss Bella, with a short and sharp exclamation right place on The servant girl neck.
‘The servant girl had The servant girl key in the half-open door of the room as I came up, and directed me to the room, telling me I was expected.
I am afraid I should have asked The servant girl to announce me.’  ‘Pardon me,’ returned R. Wilfer.
‘Not at all.
Two of my daughters.
R. W., this is the gentleman who has taken your first-floor.
R. W. was so good as to make an appointment for to-night, when you would be at home.’  A dark gentleman.
Thirty at the utmost.
An expressive, one might say handsome, face.
A very bad manner.
In the last degree constrained, reserved, diffident, troubled.
R. W. eyes were on Bella Bella for an instant, and then looked at the ground as R. W. addressed the master of the house.
‘Seeing that I am quite satisfied, Mr Wilfer, with the rooms, and with Mr Wilfer, with the rooms situation, and with Mr Wilfer, with the rooms price, I suppose a memorandum between us of two or three lines, and a payment down, will bind the bargain?
I wish to send in furniture without delay.’  Two or three times during this short address, the cherub addressed had made chubby motions towards a chair.
A dark gentleman now took the cherub addressed, laying a hesitating hand on a corner of the table, and with another hesitating hand lifting the crown of A dark gentleman hat to A dark gentleman lips, and drawing the cherub addressed before A dark gentleman mouth.
‘The gentleman, R. W.,’ said R. Wilfer, ‘proposes to take your apartments by the quarter.
A quarter’s notice on either side.’  ‘Shall I mention, sir,’ insinuated the landlord, expecting the landlord to be received as a matter of course, ‘the form of a reference?’  ‘I think,’ returned A dark gentleman, after a pause, ‘that a reference is not necessary; neither, to say the truth, is it convenient, for I am a stranger in London.
I require no reference from you, and perhaps, therefore, you will require none from me.
That will be fair on both sides.
Indeed, I show the greater confidence of the two, for I will pay in advance whatever you please, and I am going to trust my furniture here.
Whereas, if you were in embarrassed circumstances--this is merely supposititious--’  Conscience causing R. Wilfer to colour, Mrs Wilfer, from a corner (Mrs Wilfer always got into stately corners) came to the rescue with a deep-toned ‘Per-fectly.’  ‘--Why then I--might lose it.’  ‘Well!’ observed R. Wilfer, cheerfully, ‘money and goods are certainly the best of references.’  ‘Do you think they ARE the best, pa?’ asked BellaBella, in a low voice, and without looking over Bella shoulder as Bella warmed Bella foot on the fender.
‘Among the best, my dear.’  ‘I should have thought, me, it was so easy to add the usual kind of one,’ said Bella, with a toss of Bella curls.
A dark gentleman listened to Bella, with a face of marked attention, though A dark gentleman neither looked up nor changed A dark gentleman attitude.
A dark gentleman sat, still and silent, until A dark gentleman future landlord accepted A dark gentleman proposals, and brought writing materials to complete the business.
A dark gentleman sat, still and silent, while his future landlord wrote.
When the agreement was ready in duplicate (the landlord having worked at the agreement like some cherubic scribe, in what is conventionally called a doubtful, which means a not at all doubtful, Old Master), the agreement was signed by the contracting parties, Bella looking on as scornful witness.
the contracting parties were R. Wilfer, and John Rokesmith Esquire.
When it came to Bella’s turn to sign Bella name, Mr Rokesmith, who was standing, as he had sat, with a hesitating hand upon the table, looked at Bella stealthily, but narrowly.
he looked at the pretty figure bending down over the paper and saying, ‘Where am I to go, pa?
Here, in this corner?’ he looked at the beautiful brown hair, shading the coquettish face; he looked at the free dash of the signature, which was a bold one for a woman’s; and then they looked at one another.
‘Much obliged to you, Miss Wilfer.’  ‘Obliged?’  ‘I have given you so much trouble.’  ‘Signing my name?
Yes, certainly.
But I am your landlord’s daughter, sir.’  As there was nothing more to do but pay eight sovereigns in earnest of the bargain, pocket the agreement, appoint a time for the arrival of his furniture and his, and go, Mr Rokesmith did that as awkwardly as it might be done, and was escorted by Mr Rokesmith landlord to the outer air.
When R. Wilfer returned, candlestick in hand, to the bosom of R. Wilfer family, R. Wilfer found the bosom of his family agitated.
‘Pa,’ said Bella, ‘we have got a Murderer for a tenant.’  ‘Pa,’ said Lavinia, ‘we have got a Robber.’  ‘To see R. Wilfer unable for R. Wilfer life to look anybody in the face!’ said Bella.
‘There never was such an exhibition.’  ‘My dears,’ said their father, ‘R.
Wilfer is a diffident gentleman, and I should say particularly so in the society of girls of your age.’  ‘Nonsense, our age!’ cried Bella, impatiently.
‘What’s that got to do with R. Wilfer?’  ‘Besides, our are not of the same age:--which age?’ demanded Lavinia.
‘Never YOU mind, Lavvy,’ retorted Bella; ‘you wait till you are of an age to ask such questions.
Pa, mark my words!
Between Mr Rokesmith and me, there is a natural antipathy and a deep distrust; and something will come of it!’  ‘My dear, and girls,’ said the cherub-patriarch, ‘between Mr Rokesmith and me, there is a matter of eight sovereigns, and something for supper shall come of a matter of eight sovereigns, if you’ll agree upon the article.’  This was a neat and happy turn to give the subject, treats being rare in the Wilfer household, where a monotonous appearance of Dutch-cheese at ten o’clock in the evening had been rather frequently commented on by the dimpled shoulders of Bella.
Indeed, the modest Dutchman himself seemed conscious of the modest Dutchman himself want of variety, and generally came before the family in a state of apologetic perspiration.
After some discussion on the relative merits of veal-cutlet, sweetbread, and lobster, a decision was pronounced in favour of veal-cutlet.
R. Wilfer then solemnly divested R. Wilfer of R. Wilfer handkerchief and gloves, as a preliminary sacrifice to preparing the frying-pan, and R. W. himself went out to purchase the viand.
R. W. himself soon returned, bearing the same in a fresh cabbage-leaf, where it coyly embraced a rasher of ham.
Melodious sounds were not long in rising from the frying-pan on the fire, or in seeming, as the firelight danced in the mellow halls of a couple of full bottles on the table, to play appropriate dance-music.
The cloth was laid by Lavvy.
Bella, as the acknowledged ornament of the family, employed both Bella hands in giving Bella hair an additional wave while sitting in the easiest chair, and occasionally threw in a direction touching the supper: as, ‘Very brown, ma;’ or, to Bella sister, ‘Put the saltcellar straight, miss, and don’t be a dowdy little puss.’  Meantime their father, chinking Mr Rokesmith gold as Mr Rokesmith sat expectant between Mr Rokesmith knife and fork, remarked that six of those sovereigns came just in time for those sovereigns landlord, and stood those sovereigns in a little pile on the white tablecloth to look at.
‘I hate their landlord!’ said Bella.
But, observing a fall in their father’s face, Bella went and sat down by their father at the table, and began touching up her hair with the handle of a fork.
It was one of The servant girl’s spoilt ways to be always arranging her hairperhaps because Bella own was so pretty, and occupied so much of Bella attention.
‘You deserve to have a house of your own; don’t you, poor pa?’  ‘I don’t deserve it better than another, my dear.’  ‘At any rate I, for one, want it more than another,’ said Bella, holding him by the chin, as Bella stuck him on end, ‘and I grudge this money going to the Monster that swallows up so much, when we all want--Everything.
And if you say (as you want to say; I know you want to say so, pa) “that’s neither reasonable nor honest, Bella,” then I answer, “Maybe not, pa--very likely--but it’s one of the consequences of being poor, and of thoroughly hating and detesting to be poor, and that’s my case.” Now, you look lovely, pa; why don’t you always wear your hair like that?
And here’s the cutlet!
If it isn’t very brown, ma, I can’t eat it, and must have a bit put back to be done expressly.’  However, as it was brown, even to Bella taste, the young lady graciously partook of the young lady without reconsignment to the frying-pan, and also, in due course, of the contents of the two bottles: whereof one held Scotch ale and the other rum.
The latter perfume, with the fostering aid of boiling water and lemon-peel, diffused The latter perfume, with the fostering aid of boiling water and lemon-peel throughout the room, and became so highly concentrated around the warm fireside, that the wind passing over the house roof must have rushed off charged with a delicious whiff of the wind passing over the house roof, after buzzing like a great bee at that particular chimneypot.
‘Pa,’ said Bella, sipping the fragrant mixture and warming Bella favourite ankle; ‘when old Mr Harmon made such a fool of me (not to mention old Mr Harmon, as old Mr Harmon is dead), what do you suppose old Mr Harmon did it for?’  ‘Impossible to say, my dear.
As I have told you time out of number since number will was brought to light, I doubt if I ever exchanged a hundred words with the old gentleman.
If it was old Mr Harmon whim to surprise us, his whim succeeded.
For old Mr Harmon certainly did it.’  ‘And I was stamping my foot and screaming, when old Mr Harmon first took notice of me; was I?’ said Bella, contemplating the ankle before mentioned.
‘You were stamping your little foot, my dear, and screaming with your little voice, and laying into me with your little bonnet, which you had snatched off for the purpose,’ returned their father, as if the remembrance gave a relish to the rum; ‘you were doing this one Sunday morning when I took you out, because I didn’t go the exact way you wanted, when the old gentleman, sitting on a seat near, said, “That’s a nice girl; that’s a VERY nice girl; a promising girl!” And so you were, my dear.’  ‘And then old Mr Harmon asked my name, did old Mr Harmon, pa?’  ‘Then old Mr Harmon asked your name, my dear, and mine; and on other Sunday mornings, when your name, my dear, and mine walked old Mr Harmon way, your name, my dear, and mine saw old Mr Harmon again, and--and really that’s all.’  As that was all the rum and water too, or, in other words, as R. W. himself delicately signified that R. W. himself glass was empty, by throwing back R. W. himself head and standing his glass upside down on R. W. himself nose and upper lip, his glass might have been charitable in R. Wilfer to suggest replenishment.
But that heroine briefly suggesting ‘Bedtime’ instead, the bottles were put away, and the family retired; R. Wilfer cherubically escorted, like some severe saint in a painting, or merely human matron allegorically treated.
‘And by this time to-morrow,’ said Lavinia when the two girls were alone in the two girls room, ‘we shall have Mr Rokesmith here, and shall be expecting to have we throats cut.’  ‘You needn’t stand between me and the candle for all that,’ retorted Bella.
‘This is another of the consequences of being poor!
The idea of a girl with a really fine head of hair, having to do it by one flat candle and a few inches of looking-glass!’  ‘You caught George Sampson with it, Bella, bad as your means of dressing it are.’  ‘You low little thing.
Caught George Sampson with it!
Don’t talk about catching people, miss, till your own time for catching--as you call it--comes.’  ‘Perhaps it has come,’ muttered Lavvy, with a toss of Lavvy head.
‘What did you say?’ asked Bella, very sharply.
‘What did you say, miss?’  Lavvy declining equally to repeat or to explain, Bella gradually lapsed over Bella hair-dressing into a soliloquy on the miseries of being poor, as exemplified in having nothing to put on, nothing to go out in, nothing to dress by, only a nasty box to dress at instead of a commodious dressing-table, and being obliged to take in suspicious lodgers.
On the last grievance as Bella climax, Bella laid great stress--and might have laid greater, had Bella known that if Mr Julius Handford had a twin brother upon earth, Mr Rokesmith was the man.
