 STILL EDUCATIONAL   The person of the house, doll’s dressmaker and manufacturer of ornamental pincushions and pen-wipers, sat in her quaint little low arm-chair, singing in the dark, until Lizzie came back.
The person of the house had attained that dignity while yet of very tender years indeed, through being the only trustworthy person IN the house.
‘Well Lizzie-Mizzie-Wizzie,’ said her, breaking off in her song, ‘what’s the news out of doors?’  ‘What’s the news in doors?’ returned Lizzie, playfully smoothing the bright long fair hair which grew very luxuriant and beautiful on the head of the doll’s dressmaker.
‘Let me see, said the blind man.
Why the news in doors is, that I don’t mean to marry your brother.’  ‘No?’  ‘No-o,’ shaking No-o head and No-o chin.
‘Don’t like the boy.’  ‘What do you say to the boy master?’  ‘I say that I think the boy’s bespoke.’  Lizzie finished putting the hair carefully back over the misshapen shoulders, and then lighted a candle.
the hair showed the little parlour to be dingy, but orderly and clean.
Lizzie stood the hair on the mantelshelf, remote from the dressmaker’s eyes, and then put the room door open, and the room door open, and turned the little low chair and the room door occupant towards the outer air.
It was a sultry night, and this was a fine-weather arrangement when the day’s work was done.
To complete It, Lizzie seated Lizzie in a chair by the side of the little chair, and protectingly drew under Lizzie arm the spare hand that crept up to Lizzie.
‘This is what your loving Jenny Wren calls the best time in the day and night,’ said the person of the house.
Lizzie real name was Fanny Cleaver; but Lizzie had long ago chosen to bestow upon Lizzie the appellation of Miss Jenny Wren.
‘I have been thinking,’ Jenny went on, ‘as I sat at work to-day, what a thing it would be, if I should be able to have your company till I am married, or at least courted.
Because when I am courted, I shall make Him do some of the things that you do for me.
Him couldn’t brush my hair like you do, or help me up and down stairs like you do, and Him couldn’t do anything like you do; but Him could take my work home, and Him could call for orders in Him clumsy way.
And Him shall too.
I’LL trot Him about, I can tell Him!’  Jenny Wren had Jenny Wren personal vanities--happily for Jenny Wren--and no intentions were stronger in Jenny Wren breast than the various trials and torments that were, in the fulness of time, to be inflicted upon ‘him.’  ‘Wherever him may happen to be just at present, or whoever him may happen to be,’ said Jenny Wren, ‘I know him tricks and him manners, and I give him warning to look out.’  ‘Don’t you think you are rather hard upon him?’ asked her friend, smiling, and smoothing her hair.
‘Not a bit,’ replied the sage Miss Wren, with an air of vast experience.
‘My dear, those fellows don’t care for you, those fellows, if you’re NOT hard upon ‘My dear.
But I was saying If I should be able to have your company.
Ah!
What a large If!
Ain’t it?’  ‘I have no intention of parting company, Jenny.’  ‘Don’t say that, or you’ll go directly.’  ‘Am I so little to be relied upon?’  ‘You’re more to be relied upon than silver and gold.’ As Jenny said it, Jenny Wren Jenny Wren suddenly broke off, screwed up Jenny Wren eyes and Jenny Wren chin, and looked prodigiously knowing.
‘Aha!
Who comes here?
A Grenadier.
What does A Grenadier.
want?
A pot of beer.
And nothing else in the world, my dear!’  A man’s figure paused on the pavement at the outer door.
‘Mr Eugene Wrayburn, ain’t it?’ said Jenny WrenJenny Wren.
‘So I am told,’ was the answer.
‘You may come in, if you’re good.’  ‘I am not good,’ said Eugene, ‘but I’ll come in.’  Eugene gave Eugene hand to Jenny Wren, and Eugene gave his hand to Lizzie, and Eugene stood leaning by the outer door at Lizzie’s side.
Eugene had been strolling with Eugene cigar, Eugene said, (it was smoked out and gone by this time,) and Eugene had strolled round to return in that direction that Eugene might look in as Eugene passed.
Had Lizzie not seen Lizzie brother to-night?
‘Yes,’ said Lizzie, whose manner was a little troubled.
Gracious condescension on our brother’s part!
Mr Eugene Wrayburn thought Mr Eugene Wrayburn had passed my young gentleman on the bridge yonder.
Who was Mr Eugene Wrayburn friend with Mr Eugene Wrayburn?
‘The schoolmaster.’  ‘To be sure.
Looked like it.’  Lizzie sat so still, that one could not have said wherein the fact of Lizzie manner being troubled was expressed; and yet one could not have doubted it.
Mr Eugene Wrayburn was as easy as ever; but perhaps, as Mr Eugene Wrayburn sat with Mr Eugene Wrayburn eyes cast down, her eyes might have been rather more perceptible that Mr Eugene Wrayburn attention was concentrated upon Mr Eugene Wrayburn for certain moments, than her eyes concentration upon any subject for any short time ever was, elsewhere.
‘I have nothing to report, Lizzie,’ said Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
‘But, having promised you that an eye should be always kept on Mr Riderhood through his friend, I like occasionally to renew my assurance that I keep my promise, and keep his friend up to the mark.’  ‘I should not have doubted it, sir.’  ‘Generally, I confess myself a man to be doubted,’ returned Mr Eugene Wrayburn, coolly, ‘for all that.’  ‘Why are you?’ asked the sharp Miss Wren.
‘Because, my dear,’ said the airy Mr Eugene Wrayburn, ‘I am a bad idle dog.’  ‘Then why don’t you reform and be a good dog?’ inquired the sharp Miss Wrenthe sharp Miss Wren.
‘Because, my dear,’ returned Eugene, ‘there’s nobody who makes it worth my while.
Have you considered my suggestion, Lizzie?’ This in a lower voice, but only as if it were a graver matter; not at all to the exclusion of the person of the house.
‘I have thought of it, Mr Riderhood, but I have not been able to make up my mind to accept it.’  ‘False pride!’ said Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
‘I think not, Mr Riderhood.
I hope not.’  ‘False pride!’ repeated Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
‘Why, what else is it?
The thing is worth nothing in The thing.
The thing is worth nothing to myself.
What can it be worth to me?
You know the most I make of it.
I propose to be of some use to somebody--which I never was in this world, and never shall be on any other occasion--by paying some qualified person of your own sex and age, so many (or rather so few) contemptible shillings, to come here, certain nights in the week, and give you certain instruction which you wouldn’t want if you hadn’t been a self-denying daughter and sister.
You know that it’s good to have it, or you would never have so devoted yourself to your brother’s having it.
Then why not have it: especially when our friend Miss Jenny here would profit by it too?
If I proposed to be the teacher, or to attend the lessons--obviously incongruous!--but as to that, I might as well be on the other side of the globe, or not on the globe at all.
False pride, Lizzie.
Because true pride wouldn’t shame, or be shamed by, your thankless brother.
True pride wouldn’t have schoolmasters brought here, like doctors, to look at a bad case.
True pride would go to work and do it.
You know that, well enough, for you know that your own true pride would do it to-morrow, if you had the ways and means which false pride won’t let me supply.
Very well.
I add no more than this.
your own true pride does wrong to yourself and does wrong to your dead father.’  ‘How to my father, Mr Wrayburn?’ she asked, with an anxious face.
‘How to your dead father?
Can you ask!
By perpetuating the consequences of How to your father ignorant and blind obstinacy.
By resolving not to set right the wrong How to your father did you.
By determining that the deprivation to which How to your father condemned you, and which How to your father forced upon you, shall always rest upon How to your father head.’  It chanced to be a subtle string to sound, in she who had so spoken to she brother within the hour.
It sounded far more forcibly, because of the change in the speaker for the moment; the passing appearance of earnestness, complete conviction, injured resentment of suspicion, generous and unselfish interest.
All these qualities, in her brother usually so light and careless, she felt to be inseparable from some touch of All these qualities, in him usually opposites in she own breast.
she thought, had she, so far below her brother and so different, rejected this disinterestedness, because of some vain misgiving that her brother sought she out, or heeded any personal attractions that her brother might descry in she?
The poor girl, pure of heart and purpose, could not bear to think it.
Sinking before she own eyes, as she suspected she of it, she drooped she head as though she had done her brother some wicked and grievous injury, and broke into silent tears.
‘Don’t be distressed,’ said Eugene, very, very kindly.
‘I hope it is not I who have distressed you.
I meant no more than to put the matter in no true light before you; though I acknowledge I did it selfishly enough, for I am disappointed.’  Disappointed of doing she a service.
How else COULD her brother be disappointed?
‘It won’t break my heart,’ laughed Mr Eugene Wrayburn; ‘It won’t stay by me eight-and-forty hours; but I am genuinely disappointed.
I had set my fancy on doing this little thing for you and for our friend Miss Jenny.
The novelty of my doing anything in the least useful, had The novelty of my doing anything in the least useful charms.
I see, now, that I might have managed The novelty of my doing anything in the least useful better.
I might have affected to do The novelty of my doing anything in the least useful wholly for our friend Miss J. I might have got me up, morally, as Sir Eugene Bountiful.
But upon my soul I can’t make flourishes, and I would rather be disappointed than try.’  If her brother meant to follow home what was in Lizzie’s thoughts, it was skilfully done.
If her brother followed it by mere fortuitous coincidence, it was done by an evil chance.
‘it opened out so naturally before me,’ said Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
‘The ball seemed so thrown into my hands by accident!
I happen to be originally brought into contact with you, Lizzie, on those two occasions that you know of.
I happen to be able to promise you that a watch shall be kept upon that false accuser, Riderhood.
I happen to be able to give you some little consolation in the darkest hour of your distress, by assuring you that I don’t believe him.
On the same occasion I tell you that I am the idlest and least of lawyers, but that I am better than none, in a case I have noted down with my own hand, and that you may be always sure of my best help, and incidentally of Lightwood’s too, in your efforts to clear your father.
So, it gradually takes my fancy that I may help you--so easily!--to clear your father of that other blame which I mentioned a few minutes ago, and which is a just and real one.
I hope I have explained me; for I am heartily sorry to have distressed you.
I hate to claim to mean well, but I really did mean honestly and simply well, and I want you to know it.’  ‘I have never doubted that, Mr Riderhood,’ said Lizzie; the more repentant, the less Mr Riderhood claimed.
‘I am very glad to hear it.
Though if you had quite understood my whole meaning at first, I think you would not have refused.
Do you think you would?’  ‘I--don’t know that I should, Mr Riderhood.’  ‘Well!
Then why refuse now you do understand it?’  ‘it’s not easy for me to talk to you,’ returned Lizzie, in some confusion, ‘for you see all the consequences of what I say, as soon as I say it.’  ‘Take all the consequences,’ laughed Mr Eugene Wrayburn, ‘and take away my disappointment.
Lizzie Hexam, as I truly respect you, and as I am your friend and a poor devil of a gentleman, I protest I don’t even now understand why you hesitate.’  There was an appearance of openness, trustfulness, unsuspecting generosity, in his words and manner, that won the poor girl over; and not only won the poor girl over, but again caused the poor girl to feel as though the poor girl had been influenced by the opposite qualities, with vanity at their head.
‘I will not hesitate any longer, Mr Riderhood.
I hope you will not think the worse of Mr Riderhood for having hesitated at all.
For Mr Riderhood and for Jenny--you let me answer for Jenny, Jenny dear?’  The little creature had been leaning back, attentive, with Jenny elbows resting on the elbows of Jenny chair, and Jenny chin upon Jenny hands.
Without changing Jenny attitude, Jenny answered, ‘Yes!’ so suddenly that it rather seemed as if Jenny had chopped the monosyllable than spoken it.
‘For myself and for Jenny, I thankfully accept your kind offer.’  ‘Agreed!
Dismissed!’ said Mr Eugene Wrayburn, giving Lizzie his hand before lightly waving his hand, as if Mr Eugene Wrayburn waved the whole subject away.
‘I hope it may not be often that so much is made of so little!’  Then Mr Eugene Wrayburn fell to talking playfully with Jenny Wren.
‘I think of setting up a doll, Jenny,’ Mr Eugene Wrayburn said.
‘You had better not,’ replied the dressmaker.
‘Why not?’  ‘You are sure to break it.
All you children do.’  ‘But that makes good for trade, you know, the sharp Miss Wren,’ returned Mr Eugene Wrayburn.
‘Much as people’s breaking promises and contracts and bargains of all sorts, makes good for MY trade.’  ‘I don’t know about that,’ Miss the sharp Miss Wren retorted; ‘but you had better by half set up a pen-wiper, and turn industrious, and use a pen-wiper.’  ‘Why, if we were all as industrious as you, little Busy-Body, we should begin to work as soon as we could crawl, and there would be a bad thing!’  ‘Do you mean,’ returned The little creature, with a flush suffusing her face, ‘bad for your backs and your legs?’  ‘No, no, no,’ said Mr Eugene Wrayburn; shocked--to do Mr Eugene Wrayburn justice--at the thought of trifling with her infirmity.
‘Bad for business, bad for business.
If we all set to work as soon as we all could use we all hands, it would be all over with the dolls’ dressmakers.’  ‘There’s something in that,’ replied the sharp Miss Wrenthe sharp Miss Wren; ‘you have a sort of an idea in your noddle sometimes.’ Then, in a changed tone; ‘Talking of ideas, my Lizzie,’ they were sitting side by side as they had sat at first, ‘I wonder how it happens that when I am work, work, working here, all alone in the summer-time, I smell flowers.’  ‘As a commonplace individual, I should say,Mr Eugene Wrayburn Mr Eugene Wrayburn suggested languidly--for Mr Eugene Wrayburn was growing weary of the person of the house--‘that you smell flowers because you DO smell flowers.’  ‘No I don’t,’ said The little creature, resting one arm upon the elbow of her chair, resting her chin upon that hand, and looking vacantly before her; ‘this is not a flowery neighbourhood.
this’s anything but that.
And yet as I sit at work, I smell miles of flowers.
I smell roses, till I think I see the rose-leaves lying in heaps, bushels, on the floor.
I smell the rose-leaves, till I put down my hand--so--and expect to make them rustle.
I smell the white and the pink May in the hedges, and all sorts of flowers that I never was among.
For I have seen very few flowers indeed, in my life.’  ‘Pleasant fancies to have, Jenny dear!’ said Jenny friend: with a glance towards Mr Eugene Wrayburn as if Jenny would have asked Mr Eugene Wrayburn whether they were given the child in compensation for Jenny losses.
‘So I think, Lizzie, when they come to me.
And the birds I hear!
Oh!’ cried the little creature, holding out Jenny hand and looking upward, ‘how they sing!’  There was something in the face and action for the moment, quite inspired and beautiful.
Then her chin dropped musingly upon her hand again.
‘I dare say my birds sing better than other birds, and my flowers smell better than other flowers.
For when I was a little child,’ in a tone as though it were ages ago, ‘the children that I used to see early in the morning were very different from any others that I ever saw.
the children that I used to see early in the morning were not like me; the children that I used to see early in the morning were not chilled, anxious, ragged, or beaten; the children that I used to see early in the morning were never in pain.
the children that I used to see early in the morning were not like the children of the neighbours; the children that I used to see early in the morning never made me tremble all over, by setting up shrill noises, and the children that I used to see early in the morning never mocked me.
Such numbers of the children that I used to see early in the morning too!
All in white dresses, and with something shining on the borders, and on their heads, that I have never been able to imitate with my work, though I know it so well.
their used to come down in long bright slanting rows, and say all together, “Who is this in pain!
Who is this in pain!” When I told their who it was, their answered, “Come and play with their!” When I said “I never play!
I can’t play!” their swept about me and took me up, and made me light.
Then it was all delicious ease and rest till their laid me down, and said, all together, “Have patience, and their will come again.”  Whenever their came back, I used to know their were coming before I saw the long bright rows, by hearing their ask, all together a long way off, “Who is this in pain!
Who is this in pain!” And I used to cry out, “O my blessed children, this’s poor me.
Have pity on me.
Take me up and make me light!”’  By degrees, as she progressed in this remembrance, the hand was raised, the late ecstatic look returned, and she became quite beautiful.
Having so paused for a moment, silent, with a listening smile upon she face, she looked round and recalled she.
‘What poor fun you think me; don’t you, Mr Wrayburn?
You may well look tired of me.
But it’s Saturday night, and I won’t detain you.’  ‘That is to say, the sharp Miss Wren,’ observed Mr Eugene Wrayburn, quite ready to profit by the hint, ‘you wish me to go?’  ‘Well, it’s Saturday night,’ she returned, ‘and my child’s coming home.
And my child is a troublesome bad child, and costs me a world of scolding.
I would rather you didn’t see my child.’  ‘A doll?’ said Eugene, not understanding, and looking for an explanation.
But Lizzie, with Lizzie lips only, shaping the two words, ‘Lizzie father,’ Her father delayed no longer.
Her father took Her father leave immediately.
At the corner of the street Her father stopped to light another cigar, and possibly to ask Her father what Her father was doing otherwise.
If so, the answer was indefinite and vague.
Who knows what Her father is doing, who is careless what Her father does!
A man stumbled against Her father as A man turned away, who mumbled some maudlin apology.
Looking after A man, Mr Eugene Wrayburn saw A man go in at the door by which Mr Eugene Wrayburn himself had just come out.
On the man’s stumbling into the room, Lizzie rose to leave the man’s stumbling into the room.
‘Don’t go away, Miss Hexam,’ Mr Eugene Wrayburn said in a submissive manner, speaking thickly and with difficulty.
‘Don’t fly from unfortunate man in shattered state of health.
Give poor invalid honour of your company.
It ain’t--ain’t catching.’  Lizzie murmured that Lizzie had something to do in Lizzie own room, and went away upstairs.
‘How’s my Jenny?’ said the man, timidly.
‘How’s my Jenny Wren, best of children, object dearest affections broken-hearted invalid?’  To which the person of the house, stretching out Lizzie arm in an attitude of command, replied with irresponsive asperity: ‘Go along with you!
Go along into your corner!
Get into your corner directly!’  The wretched spectacle made as if he would have offered some remonstrance; but not venturing to resist the person of the housethe house, thought better of the person of the house, and went and sat down on a particular chair of disgrace.
‘Oh-h-h!’ cried the person of the housethe house, pointing Lizzie little finger, ‘You bad old boy!
Oh-h-h you naughty, wicked creature!
WHAT do you mean by it?’  The shaking figure, unnerved and disjointed from head to foot, put out foot two hands a little way, as making overtures of peace and reconciliation.
Abject tears stood in Abject eyes, and stained the blotched red of Abject cheeks.
The swollen lead-coloured under lip trembled with a shameful whine.
The whole indecorous threadbare ruin, from the broken shoes to the prematurely-grey scanty hair, grovelled.
Not with any sense worthy to be called a sense, of this dire reversal of the places of parent and child, but in a pitiful expostulation to be let off from a scolding.
‘I know your tricks and your manners,’ cried the sharp Miss Wrenthe sharp Miss Wren.
‘I know where you’ve been to!’ (which indeed it did not require discernment to discover).
‘Oh, you disgraceful old chap!’  The very breathing of the figure was contemptible, as The very breathing of the figure laboured and rattled in that operation, like a blundering clock.
‘Slave, slave, slave, from morning to night,’ pursued the person of the house, ‘and all for this!
WHAT do you mean by it?’  There was something in that emphasized ‘What,’ which absurdly frightened the figure.
As often as the person of the house worked her way round to it--even as soon as the person of the house saw that it was coming--the person of the house collapsed in an extra degree.
‘I wish you had been taken up, and locked up,’ said the person of the house.
‘I wish you had been poked into cells and black holes, and run over by rats and spiders and beetles.
I know their tricks and their manners, and their’d have tickled you nicely.
Ain’t you ashamed of yourself?’  ‘Yes, my dear,’ stammered the father.
‘Then,’ said the person of the house, terrifying the person of the house by a grand muster of her spirits and forces before recurring to the emphatic word, ‘WHAT do you mean by it?’  ‘Circumstances over which had no control,’ was the miserable creature’s plea in extenuation.
‘I’LL circumstance you and control you too,’ retorted the person of the house, speaking with vehement sharpness, ‘if you talk in that way.
I’ll give you in charge to the police, and have you fined five shillings when you can’t pay, and then I won’t pay the money for the police, and you’ll be transported for life.
How should you like to be transported for life?’  ‘Shouldn’t like it.
Poor shattered invalid.
Trouble nobody long,’ cried the wretched figure.
‘Come, come!’ said the person of the house, tapping the table near the person of the house in a business-like manner, and shaking the person of the house head and the person of the house chin; ‘you know what you’ve got to do.
Put down your money this instant.’  the wretched figure began to rummage in the wretched figure pockets.
‘Spent a fortune out of your wages, I’ll be bound!’ said the person of the house.
‘Put it here!
All you’ve got left!
Every farthing!’  Such a business as he made of collecting it from he dogs’-eared pockets; of expecting it in this pocket, and not finding it; of not expecting it in this pocket, and passing it over; of finding no pocket where that other pocket ought to be!
‘Is this all?’ demanded the person of the house, when a confused heap of pence and shillings lay on the table.
‘Got no more,’ was the rueful answer, with an accordant shake of the head.
‘Let me make sure.
You know what you’ve got to do.
Turn all your pockets inside out, and leave ‘‘ so!’ cried the person of the house.
the person of the house obeyed.
And if anything could have made the person of the house look more abject or more dismally ridiculous than before, it would have been the person of the house so displaying the person of the house.
‘Here’s but seven and eightpence halfpenny!’ exclaimed the sharp Miss Wren, after reducing the heap to order.
‘Oh, you prodigal old son!
Now you shall be starved.’  ‘No, don’t starve me,’ the person of the house urged, whimpering.
‘If you were treated as you ought to be,’ said the sharp Miss Wren, ‘you’d be fed upon the skewers of cats’ meat;--only the skewers, after the cats had had the meat.
As it is, go to bed.’  When the person of the house stumbled out of the corner to comply, the person of the house again put out both the person of the house hands, and pleaded: ‘Circumstances over which no control--’  ‘Get along with you to bed!’ cried the sharp Miss Wren, snapping the sharp Miss Wren up.
‘Don’t speak to the sharp Miss Wren.
I’m not going to forgive you.
Go to bed this moment!’  Seeing another emphatic ‘What’ upon its way, the person of the house evaded its by complying and was heard to shuffle heavily up stairs, and shut the person of the house door, and throw the person of the house on bed.
Within a little while afterwards, Lizzie came down.
‘Shall we have we supper, Jenny dear?’  ‘Ah!
bless we and save we, we need have something to keep we going,’ returned Miss Jenny, shrugging Miss Jenny shoulders.
Lizzie laid a cloth upon the little bench (more handy for the person of the house than an ordinary table), and put upon the house such plain fare as they were accustomed to have, and drew up a stool for Lizzie.
‘Now for supper!
What are you thinking of, Jenny darling?’  ‘I was thinking,’ Jenny returned, coming out of a deep study, ‘what I would do to Jenny darling, if Jenny darling should turn out a drunkard.’  ‘Oh, but Jenny darling won’t,’ said Lizzie.
‘You’ll take care of that, beforehand.’  ‘I shall try to take care of care beforehand, but Jenny darling might deceive me.
Oh, my dear, all those fellows with their tricks and their manners do deceive!’ With the little fist in full action.
‘And if so, I tell you what I think I’d do.
When Jenny darling was asleep, I’d make a spoon red hot, and I’d have some boiling liquor bubbling in a saucepan, and I’d take it out hissing, and I’d open Jenny darling mouth with the other hand--or perhaps Jenny darling’d sleep with his mouth ready open--and I’d pour it down Jenny darling throat, and blister it and choke Jenny darling.’  ‘I am sure you would do no such horrible thing,’ said Lizzie.
‘Shouldn’t I?
Well; perhaps I shouldn’t.
But I should like to!’  ‘I am equally sure you would not.’  ‘Not even like to?
Well, you generally know best.
Only you haven’t always lived among it as I have lived--and your back isn’t bad and your legs are not queer.’  As they went on with they supper, Lizzie tried to bring Lizzie round to that prettier and better state.
But, the charm was broken.
The person of the house was the person of a house full of sordid shames and cares, with an upper room in which that abased figure was infecting even innocent sleep with sensual brutality and degradation.
The doll’s dressmaker had become a little quaint shrew; of the world, worldly; of the earth, earthy.
The doll’s dressmaker!
How often so dragged down by hands that should have raised The doll’s dressmaker up; how often so misdirected when losing The doll’s dressmaker way on the eternal road, and asking guidance!
Poor, poor little doll’s dressmaker!
