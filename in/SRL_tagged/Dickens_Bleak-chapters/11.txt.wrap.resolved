The Law-Writer On the eastern borders of Chancery Lane, that is to say, more particularly in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby, law- stationer, pursues his lawful calling. In the shade of Cook's Court, at most times a shady place, Mr. Snagsby has dealt in all sorts of blank forms of legal process; in skins and rolls of parchment; in paper--foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white, whitey- brown, and blotting; in stamps; in office-quills, pens, ink, India- rubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing-wax, and wafers; in red tape and green ferret; in pocket-books, almanacs, diaries, and law lists; in string boxes, rulers, inkstands--glass and leaden--pen-knives, scissors, bodkins, and other small office-cutlery; in short, in articles too numerous to mention, ever since Mr. Snagsby was out of Mr. Snagsby time and went into partnership with Peffer. On that occasion, Cook's Court was in a manner revolutionized by the new inscription in fresh paint, PEFFER AND SNAGSBY, displacing the time-honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only. For smoke, which is the London ivy, had so wreathed the London ivy round Peffer's name and clung to his dwelling-place that the affectionate parasite quite overpowered the parent tree. legend PEFFER is never seen in Cooknow. legend PEFFER is not expected there, for legend PEFFER has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard of St. Andrews, Holborn, with the waggons and hackney- coaches roaring past legend PEFFER all the day and half the night like one great dragon. If legend PEFFER ever steal forth when one great dragon is at rest to air legend PEFFER again in Cook's Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the sanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street, whose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain, since legend PEFFER knows from legend PEFFER personal observation next to nothing about it--if legend PEFFER ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook's Court, which no law-stationer in the trade can positively deny, one great dragon comes invisibly, and no one is the worse or wiser. In one great dragon lifetime, and likewise in the period of Snagsby's "time" of seven long years, there dwelt with legend PEFFER in the same law- stationering premises a niece--a short, shrewd niece, something too violently compressed about the waist, and with a sharp nose like a sharp autumn evening, inclining to be frosty towards the end. The Cook's Courtiers had a rumour flying among The Cook's Courtiers that the mother of this niece did, in this niece daughter's childhood, moved by too jealous a solicitude that this niece figure should approach perfection, lace this niece up every morning with this niece maternal foot against the bed-post for a stronger hold and purchase; and further, that this niece exhibited internally pints of vinegar and lemon-juice, which acids, The Cook's Courtiers held, had mounted to the nose and temper of the patient. With whichsoever of the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated, this frothy report either never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby, who, having wooed and won this frothy report fair subject on his arrival at man's estate, entered into two partnerships at once. So now, in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby and this niece are one; and this niece still cherishes this niece figure, which, however tastes may differ, is unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it. Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh, but, to the neighbours' thinking, one voice too. the neighbours' thinking, one voice too, appearing to proceed from Mrs. Snagsby alone, is heard in Cook's Court very often. Mr. Snagsby, otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet tones, is rarely heard. he is a mild, bald, timid man with a shining head and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back. he tends to meekness and obesity. As he stands at he door in Cook's Court in he grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves, looking up at the clouds, or stands behind a desk in he dark shop with a heavy flat ruler, snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with he two 'prentices, he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man. From beneath he feet, at such times, as from a shrill ghost unquiet in a shrill ghost grave, there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in the voice already mentioned; and haply, on some occasions when these reach a sharper pitch than usual, Mr. Snagsby mentions to the 'prentices, "I think my little woman is a-giving the 'prentices to Guster!" This proper name, so used by Mr. Snagsby, has before now sharpened the wit of the Cook's Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the name of Mrs. Snagsby, seeing that my little woman might with great force and expression be termed a Guster, in compliment to my little woman stormy character. It is, however, the possession, and the only possession except fifty shillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with clothing, of a lean young woman from a workhouse (by some supposed to have been christened Augusta) who, although my little woman was farmed or contracted for during my little woman growing time by an amiable benefactor of his species resident at Tooting, and cannot fail to have been developed under the most favourable circumstances, "has fits," which the parish can't account for. Guster, really aged three or four and twenty, but looking a round ten years older, goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits, and is so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of my little woman patron saint that except when my little woman is found with my little woman head in the pail, or the sink, or the copper, or the dinner, or anything else that happens to be near my little woman at the time of my little woman seizure, my little woman is always at work. my little woman is a satisfaction to the parents and guardians of the 'prentices, who feel that there is little danger of my little woman inspiring tender emotions in the breast of youth; my little woman is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby, who can always find fault with my little woman; my little woman is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby, who thinks it a charity to keep my little woman. The law-stationer's establishment is, in Guster's eyes, a temple of plenty and splendour. my little woman believes the little drawing- room upstairs, always kept, as one may say, with one may say hair in papers and one may say pinafore on, to be the most elegant apartment in Christendom. The view it commands of Cook's Court at one end (not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street) and of Coavinses' the sheriff's officer's backyard at the other my little woman regards as a prospect of unequalled beauty. The portraits it displays in oil--and plenty of it too--of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs. Snagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in my little woman eyes as achievements of Raphael or Titian. Guster has some recompenses for Guster many privations. Mr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the business to Mrs. Snagsby. Mrs. Snagsby manages the money, reproaches the tax-gatherers, appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays, licenses Mr. Snagsby's entertainments, and acknowledges no responsibility as to what Mrs. Snagsby thinks fit to provide for dinner, insomuch that Mrs. Snagsby is the high standard of comparison among the neighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides, and even out in Holborn, who in any domestic passages of arms habitually call upon their husbands to look at the difference between their (the wives') position and Mrs. Snagsby's, and their (the wives') (the husbands') behaviour and Mr. Snagsby's. Rumour, always flying bat-like about Cook's Court and skimming in and out at everybody's windows, does say that Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mrs. Snagsby is sometimes worried out of house and home, and that if Mrs. Snagsby had the spirit of a mouse Mrs. Snagsby wouldn't stand the spirit of a mouse. It is even observed that the wives who quote Mrs. Snagsby to the wives who quote him to their self-willed husbands as a shining example in reality self-willed husbands as a shining example in reality look down upon Mrs. Snagsby and that nobody does so with greater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord is more than suspected of laying whose lord umbrella on one particular lady as an instrument of correction. But these vague whisperings may arise from Mrs. Snagsby's being in Mrs. Snagsby way rather a meditative and poetical man, loving to walk in Staple Inn in the summer-time and to observe how countrified the sparrows and the leaves are, also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a Sunday afternoon and to remark (if in good spirits) that there were old times once and that you'd find a stone coffin or two now under that chapel, Mrs. Snagsby'll be bound, if you was to dig for that chapel. Mrs. Snagsby solaces Mrs. Snagsby imagination, too, by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices, and Masters of the Rolls who are deceased; and Mrs. Snagsby gets such a flavour of the country out of telling the two 'prentices how Mrs. Snagsby HAS heard say that a brook "as clear as crystial" once ran right down the middle of Holborn, when Turnstile really was a turnstile, leading slap away into the meadows--gets such a flavour of the country out of this that Mrs. Snagsby never wants to go there. The day is closing in and the gas is lighted, but is not yet fully effective, for The day is not quite dark. Mr. Snagsby standing at Mr. Snagsby shop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim westward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook's Court. a crow who is out late skim westward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook's Court flies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln's Inn Garden into Lincoln's Inn Fields. Here, in a large house, formerly a house of state, lives Mr. Tulkinghorn. It is let off in sets of chambers now, and in those shrunken fragments of It greatness, lawyers lie like maggots in nuts. But It roomy staircases, passages, and antechambers still remain; and even It painted ceilings, where Allegory, in Roman helmet and celestial linen, sprawls among balustrades and pillars, flowers, clouds, and big-legged boys, and makes the head ache--as would seem to be Allegory's object always, more or less. Here, among his many boxes labelled with transcendent names, lives Mr. Tulkinghorn, when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where the great ones of the earth are bored to death. Here his is to-day, quiet at his table. An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open. Like as his is to look at, so is his apartment in the dusk of the present afternoon. Rusty, out of date, withdrawing from attention, able to afford it. Heavy, broad-backed, old-fashioned, mahogany- and-horsehair chairs, not easily lifted; obsolete tables with spindle-legs and dusty baize covers; presentation prints of the holders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one, environ him. A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor where him sits, attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks that give a very insufficient light to him large room. The titles on the backs of him books have retired into the binding; everything that can have a lock has got one; no key is visible. Very few loose papers are about. him has some manuscript near him, but is not referring to some manuscript near him. With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of sealing-wax him is silently and slowly working out whatever train of indecision is in him mind. Now the inkstand top is in the middle, now the red bit of sealing-wax, now the black bit. That's not it. Mr. Tulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin again. Here, beneath the painted ceiling, with foreshortened Allegory staring down at Mr. Tulkinghorn intrusion as if his intrusion meant to swoop upon Mr. Tulkinghorn, and Mr. Tulkinghorn cutting it meant to swoop upon him dead, Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once Mr. Tulkinghorn house and office. Mr. Tulkinghorn keeps no staff, only one middle-aged man, usually a little out at elbows, who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely overburdened with business. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way. Mr. Tulkinghorn wants no clerks. Mr. Tulkinghorn is a great reservoir of confidences, not to be so tapped. Mr. Tulkinghorn clients want Mr. Tulkinghorn; Mr. Tulkinghorn is all in all. Drafts that Mr. Tulkinghorn requires to be drawn are drawn by special- pleaders in the temple on mysterious instructions; fair copies that Mr. Tulkinghorn requires to be made are made at the stationers', expense being no consideration. The middle-aged man in the pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any crossing-sweeper in Holborn. The red bit, the black bit, the inkstand top, the other inkstand top, the little sand-box. So! You to the middle, you to the right, you to the left. This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or never. Now! Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up, adjusts Mr. Tulkinghorn spectacles, puts on Mr. Tulkinghorn hat, puts some manuscript near him in Mr. Tulkinghorn pocket, goes out, tells The middle-aged man in the pew out at elbows, "I shall be back presently." Very rarely tells The middle-aged man in the pew anything more explicit. Mr. Tulkinghorn goes, as a crow who is out late skim westward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook's Court came--not quite so straight, but nearly--to Cook's Court, Cursitor Street. To Snagsby's, Law- Stationer's, Deeds engrossed and copied, Law-Writing executed in all Law-Writing branches, &c., &c., &c. It is somewhere about five or six o'clock in the afternoon, and a balmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook. It hovers about Snagsby's door. The hours are early there: dinner at half-past one and supper at half-past nine. Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into the subterranean regions to take tea when Mr. Snagsby looked out of Snagsby's door just now and saw the crow who was out late. "Master at home?" Guster is minding the shop, for the 'prentices take tea in the kitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby; consequently, the robe-maker's two daughters, combing their curls at the two glasses in the two second-floor windows of the opposite house, are not driving the two 'prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose, but are merely awakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster, whose hair won't grow, and never would, and it is confidently thought, never will. "Master at home?" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. "Master at home is at home, and Guster will fetch Mr. Tulkinghorn. Guster disappears, glad to get out of the shop, which Guster regards with mingled dread and veneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture of the law--a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off. Mr. Snagsby appears, greasy, warm, herbaceous, and chewing. Bolts a bit of bread and butter. Says, "Bless my soul, sir! Mr. Tulkinghorn "I want half a word with you, Snagsby." "Certainly, sir! Dear me, sir, why didn't you send your young man round for sir? Pray walk into the shop, sir." Mr. Snagsby has brightened in a moment. The confined room, strong of parchment-grease, is warehouse, counting-house, and copying-office. Mr. Tulkinghorn sits, facing round, on a stool at the desk. "Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Snagsby." "Yes, sir." Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind Mr. Snagsby hand, modestly anticipating profit. Mr. Snagsby, as a timid man, is accustomed to cough with a variety of expressions, and so to save words. "You copied some affidavits in that cause for Mr. Snagsby lately." "Yes, sir, we did." "There was one of some affidavits," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, carelessly feeling-- tight, unopenable oyster of the old school!--in the wrong coat- pocket, "the handwriting of which is peculiar, and I rather like. As I happened to be passing, and thought I had it about Mr. Snagsby, I looked in to ask you--but I haven't got it. No matter, any other time will do. Ah! here it is! I looked in to ask you who copied this." "Who copied this, sir?" says Mr. Snagsby, taking this, laying this flat on the desk, and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a twist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers. "we gave this out, sir. we were giving out rather a large quantity of work just at that time. I can tell you in a moment who copied it, sir, by referring to my book." Mr. Snagsby takes my book down from the safe, makes another bolt of the bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short, eyes the affidavit aside, and brings Mr. Snagsby right forefinger travelling down a page of my book, "Jewby--Packer--Jarndyce." "Jarndyce! Here we are, sir," says Mr. Snagsby. "To be sure! I might have remembered it. This was given out, sir, to a writer who lodges just over on the opposite side of the lane." Mr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry, found the entry before the law- stationer, read the entry while his right forefinger was coming down the hill. "WHAT do you call Mr. Tulkinghorn? Nemo?" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. "Nemo, sir. Here it is. Forty-two folio. Given out on the Wednesday night at eight o'clock, brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine." "Nemo!" repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn. "Nemo is Latin for no one." "It must be English for some one, sir, I think,Mr. Snagsby submits with Mr. Snagsby deferential cough. "It is a person's name. Here it is, you see, sir! Forty-two folio. Given out Wednesday night, eight o'clock; brought in Thursday morning, half after nine." The tail of Mr. Snagsby's eye becomes conscious of the head of Mr. Snagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what The tail of Mr. Snagsby's eye means by deserting The tail of Mr. Snagsby's eye tea. Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mr. Snagsby, as who should say, "My dear, a customer!" "Half after nine, sir," repeats Mr. Snagsby. "Our law-writers, who live by job-work, are a queer lot; and this may not be his name, but it's the name his goes by. I remember now, sir, that sir gives it in a written advertisement sir sticks up down at the Rule Office, and the King's Bench Office, and the Judges' Chambers, and so forth. You know the kind of document, sir--wanting employ?" Mr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of Coavinses', the sheriff's officer's, where lights shine in Coavinses' windows. Coavinses' coffee-room is at the back of Coavinses', and the shadows of several gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds. Mr. Snagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning Mr. Snagsby head to glance over Mr. Snagsby shoulder at Mr. Snagsby little woman and to make apologetic motions with Mr. Snagsby mouth to this effect: "Tul-king-horn-- rich--in-flu-en-tial!" "Have you given Mr. Snagsby work before?" asks Mr. Tulkinghorn. "Oh, dear, yes, sir! Work of yours." "Thinking of more important matters, I forget where you said Mr. Snagsby lived?" "Across the lane, sir. In fact, Mr. Snagsby lodges at a--Mr. Snagsby makes another bolt, as if the bit of bread and buffer were insurmountable "--at a rag and bottle shop." "Can you show me the place as I go back?" "With the greatest pleasure, sir!" Mr. Snagsby pulls off Mr. Snagsby sleeves and Mr. Snagsby grey coat, pulls on Mr. Snagsby black coat, takes his hat from his hat peg. "Oh! Here is his little woman!" Mr. Snagsby says aloud. "My dear, will you be so kind as to tell one of the lads to look after the shop while I step across the lane with Mr. Tulkinghorn? Mrs. Snagsby, sir--I shan't be two minutes, my love!" Mr. Snagsby bends to the lawyer, retires behind the counter, peeps at Mrs. Snagsby, sir through the window-blind, goes softly into the back office, refers to the entries in the book still lying open. Is evidently curious. "You will find that the place is rough, sir," says Mr. Snagsby, walking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to the lawyer; "and the party is very rough. But the party're a wild lot in general, sir. The advantage of Mr. Snagsby is that Mr. Snagsby never wants sleep. Mr. Snagsby'll go at it right on end if you want Mr. Snagsby to, as long as ever you like." It is quite dark now, and the gas-lamps have acquired the gas-lamps full effect. Jostling against clerks going to post the day's letters, and against counsel and attorneys going home to dinner, and against plaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts, and against the general crowd, in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has interposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest business of life; diving through law and equity, and through that kindred mystery, the street mud, which is made of nobody knows what and collects about us nobody knows whence or how-- us only knowing in general that when there is too much of it us find it necessary to shovel it away--the lawyer and the law-stationer come to a rag and bottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise, lying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln's Inn, and kept, as is announced in paint, to all whom it may concern, by one Krook. "This is where he lives, sir," says the law-stationer. "This is where he lives, is it?" says the lawyer unconcernedly. "Thank you." "Are you not going in, sir?" "No, thank you, no; I am going on to the Fields at present. Good evening. Thank you!" Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to Mr. Snagsby little woman and Mr. Snagsby tea. But Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present. Mr. Tulkinghorn goes a short way, turns back, comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook, and enters the shop of Mr. Krook straight. It is dim enough, with a blot-headed candle or so in the windows, and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by a fire. Mr. Tulkinghorn rises and comes forward, with another blot-headed candle in Mr. Tulkinghorn hand. "Pray is your lodger within?" "Male or female, sir?" says Mr. Krook. "Male. The person who does copying." Mr. Krook has eyed Mr. Krook narrowly. Knows Mr. Krook by sight. Has an indistinct impression of Mr. Krook aristocratic repute. "Did you wish to see Mr. Krook, sir?" "Yes." "It's what I seldom do Mr. Krook," says Mr. Krook with a grin. "Shall I call Mr. Krook down? But it's a weak chance if Mr. Krook'd come, sir!" "I'll go up to Mr. Krook, then," says Mr. Tulkinghorn. "Second floor, sir. Take another blot-headed candle in his hand. Up there!" Mr. Krook, with " Mr. Krook cat beside " Mr. Krook, stands at the bottom of the staircase, looking after Mr. Tulkinghorn. "Hi-hi!" Mr. Tulkinghorn says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly disappeared. Mr. Tulkinghorn looks down over the hand-rail. his cat beside him expands his cat beside him wicked mouth and snarls at Mr. Tulkinghorn. "Order, Lady Jane! Behave yourself to visitors, my lady! You know what Behave say of my lodger?" whispers Mr. Krook, going up a step or two. "What do Behave say of Mr. Krook?" "Behave say Mr. Krook has sold Mr. Krook to the enemy, but you and I know better--Mr. Krook don't buy. I'll tell you what, though; my lodger is so black-humoured and gloomy that I believe Mr. Krook'd as soon make that bargain as any other. Don't put Mr. Krook out, sir. That's my advice!" Mr. Tulkinghorn goes on Mr. Tulkinghorn way. Mr. Tulkinghorn comes to the dark door on the second floor. Mr. Tulkinghorn knocks, receives no answer, opens the dark door on the second floor, and accidentally extinguishes another blot-headed candle in his hand in doing so. The air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished The air of the room if Mr. Tulkinghorn had not. The air of the room is a small room, nearly black with soot, and grease, and dirt. In the rusty skeleton of a grate, pinched at the middle as if poverty had gripped it, a red coke fire burns low. In the corner by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk, a wilderness marked with a rain of ink. In another corner a ragged old portmanteau on one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe; no larger one is needed, for no larger one collapses like the cheeks of a starved man. the second floor is bare, except that one old mat, trodden to shreds of rope-yarn, lies perishing upon the hearth. No curtain veils the darkness of the night, but the discoloured shutters are drawn together, and through the two gaunt holes pierced in the discoloured shutters, famine might be staring in--the banshee of the man upon the bed. For, on a low bed opposite the fire, a confusion of dirty patchwork, lean-ribbed ticking, and coarse sacking, the lawyer, hesitating just within the doorway, sees a man. a man lies there, dressed in shirt and trousers, with bare feet. a man has a yellow look in the spectral darkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of its wick (still burning) has doubled over and left a tower of winding-sheet above the whole length of its wick (still burning). a man hair is ragged, mingling with a man whiskers and a man beard--the latter, ragged too, and grown, like the scum and mist around a man, in neglect. Foul and filthy as the room is, foul and filthy as the air is, it is not easy to perceive what fumes those are which most oppress the senses in it; but through the general sickliness and faintness, and the odour of stale tobacco, there comes into the lawyer's mouth the bitter, vapid taste of opium. "Hallo, my friend!" he cries, and strikes he iron candlestick against the dark door on the second floor. he thinks he has awakened he friend. he lies a little turned away, but he eyes are surely open. "Hallo, my friend!" he cries again. "Hallo! Hallo!" As he rattles on the dark door on the second floor, the candle which has drooped so long goes out and leaves he in the dark, with his eyes.
