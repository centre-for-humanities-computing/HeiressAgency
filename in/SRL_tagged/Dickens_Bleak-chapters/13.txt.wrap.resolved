lodging. That the man had often spoken to the man since and asked the man whether the man slept sound at night, and how the man bore cold and hunger, and whether the man ever wished to die, and similar strange questions. That when the man had no money, the man would say in passing, "I am as poor as you to-day, Jo," but that when the man had any, the man had always (as the boy most heartily believes) been glad to give the man some. "the man was wery good to me," says the boy, wiping the man eyes with the man wretched sleeve. "Wen I see the boy a-layin' so stritched out just now, I wished the boy could have heerd me tell the boy so. the boy wos wery good to me, the boy wos!" As the boy shuffles downstairs, Mr. Snagsby, lying in wait for Mr. Snagsby, puts a half-crown in Mr. Snagsby hand. "If you ever see me coming past your crossing with my little woman--I mean a lady--" says Mr. Snagsby with Mr. Snagsby finger on Mr. Snagsby nose, "don't allude to it!" For some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol's Arms colloquially. In the sequel, half-a-dozen are caught up in a cloud of pipe-smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol's Arms; two stroll to Hampstead; and four engage to go half-price to the play at night, and top up with oysters. Little Swills is treated on several hands. Being asked what Little Swills thinks of the proceedings, characterizes the proceedings (Little Swills strength lying in a slangular direction) as "a rummy start." The landlord of the Sol's Arms, finding Little Swills so popular, commends Little Swills highly to the jurymen and public, observing that for a song in character Little Swills don't know Little Swills equal and that that man's character-wardrobe would fill a cart. Thus, gradually the Sol's Arms melts into the shadowy night and then flares out of it strong in gas. The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving, the gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair, is faced (red-faced) by Little Swills; their friends rally round their friends and support first-rate talent. In the zenith of the evening, Little Swills says, "Gentlemen, if you'll permit me, I'll attempt a short description of a scene of real life that came off here to-day." Is much applauded and encouraged; goes out of the room as Swills; comes in as the coroner (not the least in the world like him); describes the inquest, with recreative intervals of piano-forte accompaniment, to the refrain: With him (the coroner's) tippy tol li doll, tippy tol lo doll, tippy tol li doll, Dee! The jingling piano at last is silent, and the Harmonic friends rally round the Harmonic friends pillows. Then there is rest around the lonely figure, now laid in its last earthly habitation; and its is watched by the gaunt eyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night. If this forlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by the mother at whose breast this forlorn man nestled, a little child, with eyes upraised to her loving face, and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon the neck to which it crept, what an impossibility the vision would have seemed! Oh, if in brighter days the now- extinguished fire within this forlorn man ever burned for one woman who held this forlorn man in her heart, where is her, while these ashes are above the ground! It is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby's, in Cook's Court, where Guster murders sleep by going, as Mr. Snagsby allows--not to put too fine a point upon it--out of one fit into twenty. The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender heart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been imagination, but for Tooting and her patron saint. Be it what it may, now, it was so direfully impressed at tea-time by Mr. Snagsby's account of the inquiry at which Mr. Snagsby had assisted that at supper-time her projected her into the kitchen, preceded by a flying Dutch cheese, and fell into a fit of unusual duration, which her only came out of to go into another, and another, and so on through a chain of fits, with short intervals between, of which her has pathetically availed her by consuming a flying Dutch cheese in entreaties to Mr. Snagsby not to give her warning "when her quite comes to," and also in appeals to the whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to bed. Hence, Mr. Snagsby, at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in Cursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of Mr. Snagsby on the subject of daylight, says, drawing a long breath, though the most patient of men, "I thought you was dead, I am sure!" What question this enthusiastic fowl supposes Mr. Snagsby settles when Mr. Snagsby strains Mr. Snagsby to such an extent, or why Mr. Snagsby should thus crow (so men crow on various triumphant public occasions, however) about what cannot be of any moment to Mr. Snagsby, is Mr. Snagsby affair. It is enough that daylight comes, morning comes, noon comes. Then the active and intelligent, who has got into the morning papers as such, comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook's and bears off the body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed-in churchyard, pestiferous and obscene, whence malignant diseases are communicated to the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed, while our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official back-stairs--would to heaven our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official back-stairs-- HAD departed!--are very complacent and agreeable. Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would reject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder at, they bring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian burial. With houses looking on, on every side, save where a reeking little tunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate--with every villainy of life in action close on death, and every poisonous element of death in action close on life--here they lower our dear brother here down a foot or two, here sow our dear brother here in corruption, to be raised in corruption: an avenging ghost at many a sick-bedside, a shameful testimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this boastful island together. Come night, come darkness, for you cannot come too soon or stay too long by such a place as this! Come, straggling lights into the windows of the ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do iniquity at least with this dread scene shut out! Come, flame of gas, burning so sullenly above the iron gate, on which the poisoned air deposits its witch-ointment slimy to the touch! It is well that you should call to every passerby, "Look here!" With the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to the outside of the iron gate. the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to the outside of the iron gate holds the iron gate with the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to the outside of the iron gate hands and looks in between the bars, stands looking in for a little while. the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to the outside of the iron gate then, with an old broom the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to the outside of the iron gate carries, softly sweeps the step and makes the archway clean. the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to the outside of the iron gate does so very busily and trimly, looks in again a little while, and so departs. Jo, is it thou? Well, well! Though a rejected witness, who "can't exactly say" what will be done to him in greater hands than men's, thou art not quite in outer darkness. There is something like a distant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this: "He wos wery good to me, He wos!"
