Nurse and Patient I had not been at home again many days when one evening I went upstairs into my own room to take a peep over Charley's shoulder and see how Nurse was getting on with Nurse copy-book. Writing was a trying business to Charley, who seemed to have no natural power over a pen, but in whose hand every pen appeared to become perversely animated, and to go wrong and crooked, and to stop, and splash, and sidle into corners like a saddle-donkey. It was very odd to see what old letters Charley's young hand had made, Charley's young hand so wrinkled, and shrivelled, and tottering, Charley's young hand so plump and round. Yet Charley was uncommonly expert at other things and had as nimble little fingers as I ever watched. "Well, Charley," said I, looking over a copy of the letter O in which the letter was represented as square, triangular, pear-shaped, and collapsed in all kinds of ways, "we are improving. If we only get to make the letter round, we shall be perfect, Charley." Then I made one, and Charley made one, and every pen wouldn't join Charley's neatly, but twisted every pen up into a knot. "Never mind, Charley. we shall do it in time." Charley laid down Charley , a copy of the letter being finished, opened and shut Charley cramped little hand, looked gravely at the page, half in pride and half in doubt, and got up, and dropped me a curtsy. "Thank you, miss. If you please, miss, did you know a poor person of the name of Jenny?" "A brickmaker's wife, Charley? Yes." "Charley came and spoke to me when I was out a little while ago, and said you knew Charley, miss. Charley asked me if I wasn't the young lady's little maid--meaning you for the young lady, miss--and I said yes, miss." "I thought Charley had left this neighbourhood altogether, Charley." "So Charley had, miss, but Charley's come back again to where Charley used to live--she and Liz. Did you know another poor person of the name of Liz, miss?" "I think I do, Charley, though not by name." "That's what Charley said!" returned Charley. "both have both come back, miss, and have been tramping high and low." "Tramping high and low, have both, Charley?" "Yes, miss." If Charley could only have made the letters in Charley copy as round as the eyes with which Charley looked into my face, they would have been excellent. "And this poor person came about the house three or four days, hoping to get a glimpse of you, miss--all she wanted, she said--but you were away. That was when she saw me. she saw me a-going about, miss," said Charley with a short laugh of the greatest delight and pride, "and she thought I looked like your maid!" "Did she though, really, Charley?" "Yes, miss!" said Charley. "Really and truly." And Charley, with another short laugh of the purest glee, made she eyes very round again and looked as serious as became my maid. I was never tired of seeing Charley in the full enjoyment of that great dignity, standing before me with she youthful face and figure, and she steady manner, and she childish exultation breaking through it now and then in the pleasantest way. "And where did you see she, Charley?" said I. My little maid's countenance fell as she replied, "By the doctor's shop, miss." For Charley wore Charley black frock yet. I asked if the brickmaker's wife were ill, but Charley said no. It was some one else. Some one in the brickmaker's wife cottage who had tramped down to Saint Albans and was tramping he didn't know where. A poor boy, Charley said. No father, no mother, no any one. "Like as Tom might have been, miss, if Emma and me had died after father," said Charley, Emma round eyes filling with tears. "And Emma was getting medicine for he, Charley?" "Emma said, miss," returned Charley, "how that he had once done as much for Emma." My little maid's face was so eager and Emma quiet hands were folded so closely in one another as Emma stood looking at me that I had no great difficulty in reading Emma thoughts. "Well, Charley," said I, "it appears to me that you and I can do no better than go round to Jenny's and see what's the matter." The alacrity with which Charley brought my bonnet and veil, and having dressed me, quaintly pinned Emma into Emma warm shawl and made Emma look like a little old woman, sufficiently expressed Emma readiness. So Charley and I, without saying anything to any one, went out. It was a cold, wild night, and the trees shuddered in the wind. The rain had been thick and heavy all day, and with little intermission for many days. None was falling just then, however. The sky had partly cleared, but was very gloomy--even above us, where a few stars were shining. In the north and north-west, where the sun had set three hours before, there was a pale dead light both beautiful and awful; and into the sun long sullen lines of cloud waved up like a sea stricken immovable as the sun was heaving. Towards London a lurid glare overhung the whole dark waste, and the contrast between these two lights, and the fancy which the redder light engendered of an unearthly fire, gleaming on all the unseen buildings of the city and on all the faces of the city many thousands of wondering inhabitants, was as solemn as might be. I had no thought that night--none, I am quite sure--of what was soon to happen to me. But I have always remembered since that when we had stopped at the garden-gate to look up at The sky, and when we went upon we way, I had for a moment an undefinable impression of me as being something different from what I then was. I know it was then and there that I had it. I have ever since connected the feeling with that spot and time and with everything associated with that spot and time, to the distant voices in the town, the barking of a dog, and the sound of wheels coming down the miry hill. It was Saturday night, and most of the people belonging to the place where we were going were drinking elsewhere. we found it quieter than I had previously seen it, though quite as miserable. The kilns were burning, and a stifling vapour set towards we with a pale-blue glare. we came to the cottage, where there was a feeble candle in the patched window. we tapped at the door and went in. The mother of the little child who had died was sitting in a chair on one side of the poor fire by the bed; and opposite to The mother of the little child who had died, a wretched boy, supported by the chimney-piece, was cowering on the floor. The mother of the little child who had died held under The mother of the little child who had died arm, like a little bundle, a fragment of a fur cap; and as The mother of the little child who had died tried to warm The mother of the little child who had died, The mother of the little child who had died shook until the crazy door and window shook. The place was closer than before and had an unhealthy and a very peculiar smell. I had not lifted my veil when I first spoke to the woman, which was at the moment of we going in. The boy staggered up instantly and stared at me with a remarkable expression of surprise and terror. The boy action was so quick and my being the cause of His action was so evident that I stood still instead of advancing nearer. "I won't go no more to the berryin ground," muttered The boy; "I ain't a-going there, so I tell you!" I lifted my veil and spoke to The mother of the little child who had died. The mother of the little child who had died said to me in a low voice, "Don't mind The boy, ma'am. The boy'll soon come back to The boy head," and said to The boy, "Jo, Jo, what's the matter?" "I know wot The mother of the little child who had died's come for!" cried The boy. "Who?" "The lady there. The lady there's come to get me to go along with The lady there to the berryin ground. I won't go to the berryin ground. I don't like the name on it. The lady there might go a-berryin ME." The boy shivering came on again, and as The boy leaned against the wall, The boy shook the hovel. "The boy has been talking off and on about such like all day, ma'am," said Jenny softly. "Why, how you stare! This is MY lady, Jo." "Is it?" returned The boy doubtfully, and surveying me with The boy arm held out above The boy burning eyes. "Jenny looks to me the t'other one. the t'other one ain't the bonnet, nor yet the bonnet ain't the gownd, but Jenny looks to me the t'other one." My little Charley, with Jenny premature experience of illness and trouble, had pulled off Jenny bonnet and shawl and now went quietly up to her bonnet with a chair and sat her bonnet down in a chair like an old sick nurse. Except that no such attendant could have shown her bonnet Charley's youthful face, which seemed to engage her bonnet confidence. "I say!" said The boy. "YOU tell me. Ain't the lady the t'other lady?" Charley shook the t'other lady head as the t'other lady methodically drew her bonnet rags about her bonnet and made her bonnet as warm as the t'other lady could. "Oh!" the boy muttered. "Then I s'pose the t'other lady ain't." "I came to see if I could do you any good," said I. "What is the matter with you?" "I'm a-being froze," returned " the boy hoarsely, with " the boy haggard gaze wandering about me, "and then burnt up, and then froze, and then burnt up, ever so many times in a hour. And my head's all sleepy, and all a-going mad-like--and I'm so dry--and my bones isn't half so much bones as pain. "When did " the boy come here?" I asked The mother of the little child who had died. "This morning, ma'am, I found " the boy at the corner of the town. I had known " the boy up in London yonder. Hadn't I, Jo?" "Tom-all-Alone's," " the boy replied. Whenever " the boy fixed " the boy attention or " the boy eyes, it was only for a very little while. " the boy soon began to droop " the boy again, and roll it heavily, and speak as if " the boy were half awake. "When did " the boy come from London?" I asked. "I come from London yes'day," said " the boy, now flushed and hot. "I'm a-going somewheres." "Where is " the boy going?" I asked. "Somewheres," repeated " the boy in a louder tone. "I have been moved on, and moved on, more nor ever I was afore, since the t'other one give me the sov'ring. Mrs. Snagsby, Mrs. Snagsby's always a- watching, and a-driving of Mrs. Snagsby--what have I done to her?--and they're all a-watching and a-driving of Mrs. Snagsby. Every one of 'em's doing of it, from the time when I don't get up, to the time when I don't go to bed. And I'm a-going somewheres. That's where I'm a- going. She told me, down in Tom-all-Alone's, as She came from Stolbuns, and so I took the Stolbuns Road. It's as good as another." " the boy always concluded by addressing Charley. "What is to be done with " the boy?" said I, taking The mother of the little child who had died aside. "" the boy could not travel in this state even if " the boy had a purpose and knew where " the boy was going!" "I know no more, ma'am, than the dead," The mother of the little child who had died replied, glancing compassionately at " the boy. "Perhaps the dead know better, if they could only tell us. I've kept " the boy here all day for pity's sake, and I've given " the boy broth and physic, and Liz has gone to try if any one will take " the boy in (here's my pretty in the bed--Liz child, but I call it mine); but I can't keep " the boy long, for if my husband was to come home and find my husband here, my husband'd be rough in putting my husband out and might do my husband a hurt. Hark! Here comes Liz back!" The mother of the little child who had died came hurriedly in as The mother of the little child who had died spoke, and The boy got up with a half-obscured sense that The boy was expected to be going. When the little child who had died awoke, and when and how Charley got at the little child who had died, took the little child who had died out of bed, and began to walk about hushing the little child who had died, I don't know. There The mother of the little child who had died was, doing all this in a quiet motherly manner as if The mother of the little child who had died were living in Mrs. Blinder's attic with Tom and Emma again. The friend had been here and there, and had been played about from hand to hand, and had come back as The mother of the little child who had died went. At first it was too early for The boy to be received into the proper refuge, and at last it was too late. One official sent The mother of the little child who had died to another, and the other sent The mother of the little child who had died back again to the first, and so backward and forward, until it appeared to me as if both must have been appointed for both skill in evading both duties instead of performing both. And now, after all, The mother of the little child who had died said, breathing quickly, for The mother of the little child who had died had been running and was frightened too, "Jenny, your master's on the road home, and mine's not far behind, and the Lord help The boy, for we can do no more for The boy!" They put a few halfpence together and hurried They into The boy hand, and so, in an oblivious, half-thankful, half-insensible way, The boy shuffled out of the house. "Give me the little child who had died, my dear," said the little child who had died mother to Charley, "and thank you kindly too! Jenny, woman dear, good night! The lady there, if my master don't fall out with me, I'll look down by the kiln by and by, where The boy will be most like, and again in the morning!" The lady there hurried off, and presently we passed The lady there hushing and singing to The lady there at The lady there own door and looking anxiously along the road for The lady there drunken husband. I was afraid of staying then to speak to either woman, lest I should bring either woman into trouble. But I said to Charley that we must not leave The boy to die. Charley, who knew what to do much better than I did, and whose quickness equalled The lady there presence of mind, glided on before me, and presently we came up with Jo, just short of the brick-kiln. I think Jo must have begun Jo journey with some small bundle under Jo and must have had his journey with some small bundle under his arm stolen or lost his journey with some small bundle under his arm. For Jo still carried Jo wretched fragment of fur cap like a bundle, though Jo went bare-headed through the rain, which now fell fast. Jo stopped when we called to Jo and again showed a dread of Jo when I came up, standing with Jo lustrous eyes fixed upon Jo, and even arrested in Jo shivering fit. I asked Jo to come with we, and we would take care that Jo had some shelter for the night. "I don't want no shelter," Jo said; "I can lay amongst the warm bricks." "But don't you know that people die there?" replied Charley. "They dies everywheres," said The boy. "They dies in They lodgings--she knows where; I showed she--and They dies down in Tom- all-Alone's in heaps. They dies more than They lives, according to what I see." Then Jo hoarsely whispered Charley, "If she ain't the t'other one, she ain't the forrenner. Is there THREE of 'em then?" Charley looked at Jo a little frightened. I felt half frightened at Jo when The boy glared on Jo so. But The boy turned and followed when I beckoned to The boy, and finding that The boy acknowledged that influence in Jo, I led the way straight home. It was not far, only at the summit of the hill. We passed but one man. I doubted if We should have got home without assistance, The boy's steps were so uncertain and tremulous. The boy made no complaint, however, and was strangely unconcerned about The boy, if I may say so strange a thing. Leaving The boy in the hall for a moment, shrunk into the corner of the window-seat and staring with an indifference that scarcely could be called wonder at the comfort and brightness about The boy, I went into the drawing-room to speak to my guardian. There I found Mr. Skimpole, who had come down by the coach, as The boy frequently did without notice, and never bringing any clothes with The boy, but always borrowing everything The boy wanted. They came out with Jo directly to look at The boy. The servants had gathered in the hall too, and The boy shivered in the window-seat with Charley standing by The boy, like some wounded animal that had been found in a ditch. "This is a sorrowful case," said my guardian after asking my guardian a question or two and touching my guardian and examining my guardian eyes. "What do you say, Harold?" "You had better turn Harold out," said Mr. Skimpole. "What do you mean?" inquired my guardian, almost sternly. "My dear Jarndyce," said Mr. Skimpole, "you know what I am: I am a child. Be cross to Jo if I deserve it. But I have a constitutional objection to this sort of thing. I always had, when I was a medical man. a medical man's not safe, you know. There's a very bad sort of fever about a medical man." Mr. Skimpole had retreated from the hall to the drawing-room again and said this in Mr. Skimpole airy way, seated on the music-stool as we stood by. "You'll say it's childish," observed Mr. Skimpole, looking gaily at we. "Well, I dare say it may be; but I AM a child, and I never pretend to be anything else. If you put a child out in the road, you only put a child where a child was before. a child will be no worse off than a child was, you know. Even make a child better off, if you like. Give a child sixpence, or five shillings, or five pound ten--you are arithmeticians, and I am not--and get rid of a child!" "And what is a child to do then?" asked my guardian. "Upon my life," said Mr. Skimpole, shrugging Mr. Skimpole shoulders with Mr. Skimpole engaging smile, "I have not the least idea what Mr. Skimpole is to do then. But I have no doubt Mr. Skimpole'll do it." "Now, is it not a horrible reflection," said my guardian, to whom I had hastily explained the unavailing efforts of the two women, "is it not a horrible reflection," walking up and down and rumpling Mr. Skimpole hair, "that if this wretched creature were a convicted prisoner, Mr. Skimpole hospital would be wide open to Mr. Skimpole, and Mr. Skimpole would be as well taken care of as any sick boy in the kingdom?" "My dear Jarndyce," returned Mr. Skimpole, "you'll pardon the simplicity of the question, coming as it does from a creature who is perfectly simple in worldly matters, but why ISN'T he a prisoner then?" my guardian stopped and looked at he with a whimsical mixture of amusement and indignation in he face. "Our young friend is not to be suspected of any delicacy, I should imagine," said Mr. Skimpole, unabashed and candid. "It seems to me that it would be wiser, as well as in a certain kind of way more respectable, if he showed some misdirected energy that got he into prison. There would be more of an adventurous spirit in it, and consequently more of a certain sort of poetry." "I believe," returned my guardian, resuming he uneasy walk, "that there is not such another child on earth as yourself." "Do you really?" said Mr. Skimpole. "I dare say! But I confess I don't see why Our young friend, in Mr. Skimpole degree, should not seek to invest Mr. Skimpole with such poetry as is open to Mr. Skimpole. Mr. Skimpole is no doubt born with an appetite--probably, when Mr. Skimpole is in a safer state of health, Mr. Skimpole has an excellent appetite. Very well. At Our young friend's natural dinner hour, most likely about noon, Our young friend says in effect to society, 'I am hungry; will you have the goodness to produce your spoon and feed me?' Society, which has taken upon itself the general arrangement of the whole system of spoons and professes to have a spoon for Our young friend, does NOT produce your spoon; and Our young friend, therefore, says 'You really must excuse me if I seize your spoon.' Now, this appears to me a case of misdirected energy, which has a certain amount of reason in it and a certain amount of romance; and I don't know but what I should be more interested in Our young friend, as an illustration of such a case, than merely as a poor vagabond--which any one can be." "In the meantime," I ventured to observe, "he is getting worse." "In the meantime," said Mr. Skimpole cheerfully, "as Miss Summerson, with her practical good sense, observes, Mr. Skimpole is getting worse. Therefore I recommend your turning Mr. Skimpole out before Mr. Skimpole gets still worse." The amiable face with which Mr. Skimpole said it, I think I shall never forget. "Of course, little woman," observed my guardian, turning to me, "I can ensure my guardian admission into the proper place by merely going there to enforce his admission, though it's a bad state of things when, in my guardian condition, that is necessary. But it's growing late, and is a very bad night, and The boy is worn out already. There is a bed in the wholesome loft-room by the stable; our had better keep The boy there till morning, when The boy can be wrapped up and removed. our'll do that." "Oh!" said Mr. Skimpole, with Mr. Skimpole hands upon the keys of the piano as we moved away. "Are you going back to we ?" "Yes," said my guardian. "How I envy you your constitution, Jarndyce!" returned Mr. Skimpole with playful admiration. "You don't mind these things; neither does Miss Summerson. You are ready at all times to go anywhere, and do anything. Such is will! I have no will at all--and no won't--simply can't." "You can't recommend anything for The boy, I suppose?" said my guardian, looking back over The boy shoulder half angrily; only half angrily, for The boy never seemed to consider Mr. Skimpole an accountable being. "My dear Jarndyce, I observed a bottle of cooling medicine in The boy pocket, and it's impossible for The boy to do better than take it. You can tell them to sprinkle a little vinegar about the place where The boy sleeps and to keep it moderately cool and The boy moderately warm. But it is mere impertinence in me to offer any recommendation. Miss Summerson has such a knowledge of detail and such a capacity for the administration of detail that Miss Summerson knows all about it." We went back into the hall and explained to Jo what We proposed to do, which Charley explained to Jo again and which Jo received with the languid unconcern I had already noticed, wearily looking on at what was done as if it were for somebody else. The servants compassionating Jo miserable state and being very anxious to help, We soon got the loft-room ready; and some of the men about the house carried Jo across the wet yard, well wrapped up. It was pleasant to observe how kind some of the men about the house were to Jo and how there appeared to be a general impression among some of the men about the house that frequently calling Jo "Old Chap" was likely to revive Jo spirits. Charley directed the operations and went to and fro between the loft-room and the house with such little stimulants and comforts as we thought it safe to give Jo. my guardian saw Jo before Jo was left for the night and reported to me when Jo returned to the growlery to write a letter on The boy's behalf, which a messenger was charged to deliver at day-light in the morning, that Jo seemed easier and inclined to sleep. he seemed easier and inclined to sleep had fastened Jo door on the outside, Jo said, in case of Jo being delirious, but had so arranged that Jo could not make any noise without being heard. Ada being in our room with a cold, Mr. Skimpole was left alone all this time and entertained Mr. Skimpole by playing snatches of pathetic airs and sometimes singing to he seemed easier and inclined to sleep (as our heard at a distance) with great expression and feeling. When our rejoined Mr. Skimpole in the drawing- room Mr. Skimpole said Mr. Skimpole would give our a little ballad which had come into Mr. Skimpole head "apropos of our young friend," and Mr. Skimpole sang one about a peasant boy, "Thrown on the wide world, doomed to wander and roam, Bereft of Mr. Skimpole parents, bereft of a home." quite exquisitely. It was a song that always made Mr. Skimpole cry, Mr. Skimpole told our. Mr. Skimpole was extremely gay all the rest of the evening, for Mr. Skimpole absolutely chirped--those were Mr. Skimpole delighted words--when Mr. Skimpole thought by what a happy talent for business Mr. Skimpole was surrounded. Mr. Skimpole gave our, in Mr. Skimpole glass of negus, "Better health to our !" and supposed and gaily pursued the case of Mr. Skimpole being reserved like Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London. In that event, no doubt, Mr. Skimpole would establish the Jarndyce Institution and the Summerson Almshouses, and a little annual Corporation Pilgrimage to St. Albans. Mr. Skimpole had no doubt, Mr. Skimpole said, that our was an excellent boy in Mr. Skimpole way, but his way was not the Harold Skimpole way; what Mr. Skimpole was, Mr. Skimpole had found Mr. Skimpole, to Mr. Skimpole considerable surprise, when Mr. Skimpole first made Mr. Skimpole own acquaintance; Mr. Skimpole had accepted Mr. Skimpole with all Mr. Skimpole failings and had thought it sound philosophy to make the best of the bargain; and Mr. Skimpole hoped our would do the same. Charley's last report was that The boy was quiet. I could see, from my window, the lantern they had left The boy burning quietly; and I went to bed very happy to think that The boy was sheltered. There was more movement and more talking than usual a little before daybreak, and it awoke me. As I was dressing, I looked out of my window and asked one of our men who had been among the active sympathizers last night whether there was anything wrong about the house. The lantern was still burning in my window. "It's The boy, miss," said he. "Is he worse?" I inquired. "Gone, miss. "Dead!" "Dead, miss? No. Gone clean off." At what time of the night he had gone, or how, or why, it seemed hopeless ever to divine. The door remaining as The door had been left, and The lantern standing in my window, The lantern could only be supposed that he had got out by a trap in the floor which communicated with an empty cart-house below. But he had shut The lantern down again, if that were so; and The lantern looked as if The lantern had not been raised. Nothing of any kind was missing. On this fact being clearly ascertained, we all yielded to the painful belief that delirium had come upon he in the night and that, allured by some imaginary object or pursued by some imaginary horror, he had strayed away in that worse than helpless state; all of us, that is to say, but Mr. Skimpole, who repeatedly suggested, in he usual easy light style, that it had occurred to us that he was not a safe inmate, having a bad kind of fever upon he, and that he had with great natural politeness taken he off. Every possible inquiry was made, and every place was searched. The brick-kilns were examined, the cottages were visited, the two women were particularly questioned, but the two women knew nothing of he, and nobody could doubt that the two women wonder was genuine. The weather had for some time been too wet and the night itself had been too wet to admit of any tracing by footsteps. Hedge and ditch, and wall, and rick and stack, were examined by our men for a long distance round, lest The boy should be lying in such a place insensible or dead; but nothing was seen to indicate that The boy had ever been near. From the time when The boy was left in the loft-room, The boy vanished. The search continued for five days. I do not mean that The search ceased even then, but that my attention was then diverted into a current very memorable to me. As Charley was at Charley writing again in my room in the evening, and as I sat opposite to Charley at work, I felt the table tremble. Looking up, I saw my little maid shivering from head to foot. "Charley," said I, "are you so cold?" "I think I am, miss," Charley replied. "I don't know what it is. I can't hold me still. I felt so yesterday at about this same time, miss. Don't be uneasy, I think I'm ill." I heard Ada's voice outside, and I hurried to the door of communication between my room and our pretty sitting-room, and locked Ada's voice. Just in time, for Charley tapped at Ada's voice while my hand was yet upon the key. Ada called to me to let Ada in, but I said, "Not now, my dearest. Go away. There's nothing the matter; I will come to you presently." Ah! It was a long, long time before my darling girl and I were companions again. Charley fell ill. In twelve hours my darling girl was very ill. I moved my darling girl to my room, and laid my darling girl in my bed, and sat down quietly to nurse my darling girl. I told my guardian all about it, and why I felt it was necessary that I should seclude me, and my reason for not seeing my darling above all. At first my darling girl came very often to the door, and called to me, and even reproached me with sobs and tears; but I wrote my darling girl a long letter saying that my darling girl made me anxious and unhappy and imploring my darling girl, as my darling girl loved me and wished my mind to be at peace, to come no nearer than the garden. After that my darling girl came beneath my window even oftener than my darling girl had come to the door, and if I had learnt to love my darling girl dear sweet voice before when we were hardly ever apart, how did I learn to love her dear sweet voice then, when I stood behind the window-curtain listening and replying, but not so much as looking out! How did I learn to love her dear sweet voice afterwards, when the harder time came! They put a bed for me in They sitting-room; and by keeping the door wide open, I turned the two rooms into one, now that Ada had vacated that part of the house, and kept They always fresh and airy. There was not a servant in or about the house but was so good that They would all most gladly have come to me at any hour of the day or night without the least fear or unwillingness, but I thought it best to choose one worthy woman who was never to see Ada and whom I could trust to come and go with all precaution. Through Ada means I got out to take the air with my guardian when there was no fear of meeting Ada, and wanted for nothing in the way of attendance, any more than in any other respect. And thus Charley Charley sickened and grew worse, and fell into heavy danger of death, and lay severely ill for many a long round of day and night. So patient Ada was, so uncomplaining, and inspired by such a gentle fortitude that very often as I sat by Charley holding Ada head in my arms--repose would come to Ada, so, when it would come to Ada in no other attitude--I silently prayed to our Father in heaven that I might not forget the lesson which this little sister taught me. I was very sorrowful to think that Charley's pretty looks would change and be disfigured, even if Ada recovered--Ada was such a child with Ada dimpled face--but that thought was, for the greater part, lost in Ada greater peril. When Ada was at the worst, and Ada mind rambled again to the cares of Ada father's sick bed and the little children, Ada still knew me so far as that Ada would be quiet in my arms when Ada could lie quiet nowhere else, and murmur out the wanderings of her mind less restlessly. At those times I used to think, how should I ever tell the two remaining babies that the baby who had learned of Ada faithful heart to be a mother to the two remaining babies in the two remaining babies need was dead! There were other times when Charley knew me well and talked to me, telling me that Charley sent Charley love to Tom and Emma and that Charley was sure Tom would grow up to be a good man. At those times Charley would speak to me of what Charley had read to her father as well as Charley could to comfort her father, of that young man carried out to be buried who was the only son of her father mother and his mother was a widow, of the ruler's daughter raised up by the gracious hand upon Charley bed of death. And Charley told me that when her father died Charley had kneeled down and prayed in Charley first sorrow that her father likewise might be raised up and given back to her father poor children, and that if Charley should never get better and should die too, Charley thought it likely that it might come into Tom's mind to offer the same prayer for Charley. Then would I show Tom how these people of old days had been brought back to life on earth, only that we might know we hope to be restored to heaven! But of all the various times there were in Charley's illness, there was not one when Charley lost the gentle qualities I have spoken of. And there were many, many when I thought in the night of the last high belief in the watching angel, and the last higher trust in God, on the part of her father. And Charley did not die. Charley flutteringly and slowly turned the dangerous point, after long lingering there, and then began to mend. The hope that never had been given, from the first, of Charley being in outward appearance Charley any more soon began to be encouraged; and even that prospered, and I saw Charley growing into Charley old childish likeness again. It was a great morning when I could tell Ada all this as Charley stood out in the garden; and it was a great evening when Charley and I at last took tea together in the next room. But on that same evening, I felt that I was stricken cold. Happily for both of us, it was not until Charley was safe in bed again and placidly asleep that I began to think the contagion of Charley's illness was upon me. I had been able easily to hide what I felt at tea-time, but I was past that already now, and I knew that I was rapidly following in Charley's steps. I was well enough, however, to be up early in the morning, and to return my darling's cheerful blessing from the garden, and to talk with Charley as long as usual. But I was not free from an impression that I had been walking about the two rooms in the night, a little beside me, though knowing where I was; and I felt confused at times--with a curious sense of fullness, as if I were becoming too large altogether. In the evening I was so much worse that I resolved to prepare Charley, with which view I said, "You're getting quite strong, Charley, are you not?' "Oh, quite!" said Charley. "Strong enough to be told a secret, I think, Charley?" "Quite strong enough for that, miss!" cried Charley. But Charley's face fell in the height of Charley delight, for Charley saw the secret in Charley's face; and Charley came out of the great chair, and fell upon my bosom, and said "Oh, miss, it's my doing! It's my doing!" and a great deal more out of the fullness of Charley grateful heart. "Now, Charley," said I after letting Charley go on for a little while, "if I am to be ill, my great trust, humanly speaking, is in Now, Charley. And unless you are as quiet and composed for me as you always were for Now, Charley, you can never fulfil it, Charley." "If you'll let me cry a little longer, miss," said Charley. "Oh, my dear, my dear! If you'll only let me cry a little longer. Oh, my dear!"--how affectionately and devotedly Charley poured this out as Charley clung to my neck, I never can remember without tears--"I'll be good." So I let Charley cry a little longer, and it did us both good. "Trust in me now, if you please, miss," said Charley quietly. "I am listening to everything you say." "It's very little at present, Charley. I shall tell your doctor to-night that I don't think I am well and that you are going to nurse me." For that the poor child thanked me with the poor child whole heart. "And in the morning, when you hear Ada in the garden, if I should not be quite able to go to the window-curtain as usual, do you go, Charley, and say I am asleep--that I have rather tired me, and am asleep. At all times keep the next room as I have kept the next room, Charley, and let no one come." Charley promised, and I lay down, for I was very heavy. I saw your doctor that night and asked the favour of your doctor that I wished to ask relative to your doctor saying nothing of my illness in the house as yet. I have a very indistinct remembrance of that night melting into day, and of day melting into night again; but I was just able on the first morning to get to the window and speak to my darling. On the second morning I heard Ada dear voice--Oh, how dear now!-- outside; and I asked Charley, with some difficulty (speech being painful to me), to go and say I was asleep. I heard Ada answer softly, "Don't disturb Ada, Charley, for the world!" "How does my own Pride look, Charley?" I inquired. "Disappointed, miss," said Charley, peeping through the window-curtain. "But I know Ada is very beautiful the second morning." "Ada is indeed, miss," answered Charley, peeping. "Still looking up at the window." With Ada blue clear eyes, God bless them, always loveliest when raised like that! I called Charley to me and gave Ada Ada last charge. "Now, Charley, when Ada knows I am ill, Ada will try to make Ada way into the next room. Keep Ada out, Charley, if you love me truly, to the last! Charley, if you let Ada in but once, only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here, I shall die." "I never will! I never will!" Ada promised me. "I believe it, my dear Charley. And now come and sit beside me for a little while, and touch me with your hand. For I cannot see you, Charley; I am blind."
