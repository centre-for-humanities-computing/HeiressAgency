Flight Inspector Bucket of the Detective has not yet struck Flight Inspector Bucket of the Detective great blow, as just now chronicled, but is yet refreshing Flight Inspector Bucket of the Detective with sleep preparatory to Flight Inspector Bucket of the Detective field-day, when through the night and along the freezing wintry roads a chaise and pair comes out of Lincolnshire, making Lincolnshire way towards London.
Railroads shall soon traverse all this country, and with a rattle and a glare the engine and train shall shoot like a meteor over the wide night-landscape, turning the moon paler; but as yet such things are non-existent in these parts, though not wholly unexpected.
Preparations are afoot, measurements are made, ground is staked out.
Bridges are begun, and Bridges not yet united piers desolately look at one another over roads and streams like brick and mortar couples with an obstacle to Bridges union; fragments of embankments are thrown up and left as precipices with torrents of rusty carts and barrows tumbling over Bridges; tripods of tall poles appear on hilltops, where there are rumours of tunnels; everything looks chaotic and abandoned in full hopelessness.
Along the freezing roads, and through the night, the post-chaise makes the post-chaise way without a railroad on the post-chaise mind.
Mrs. Rouncewell, so many years housekeeper at Chesney Wold, sits within the post-chaise; and by Mrs. Rouncewell side sits Mrs. Bagnet with Mrs. Bagnet grey cloak and umbrella.
Mrs. Bagnet would prefer the bar in front, as being exposed to the weather and a primitive sort of perch more in accordance with Mrs. Bagnet usual course of travelling, but Mrs. Rouncewell is too thoughtful of Mrs. Rouncewell comfort to admit of Mrs. Rouncewell proposing it.
Mrs. Rouncewell cannot make enough of Mrs. Bagnet.
Mrs. Rouncewell sits, in Mrs. Rouncewell stately manner, holding Mrs. Rouncewell hand, and regardless of its roughness, puts its often to Mrs. Rouncewell lips.
"You are a mother, my dear soul," says Mrs. Rouncewell many times, "and you found out George!"
"Why, George," returns Mrs. Bagnet, "was always free with George, ma'am, and when George said at our house to my Woolwich that of all the things my Woolwich could have to think of when George grew to be a man, the comfortablest would be that George had never brought a sorrowful line into George's face or turned a hair of George head grey, then I felt sure, from George way, that something fresh had brought George into George mind.
I had often known George say to George, in past times, that George had behaved bad to George."
"Never, my dear!"
returns Mrs. Rouncewell, bursting into tears.
"My blessing on George, never!
George was always fond of George, and loving to George, was my GeorgeGeorge!
But George had a bold spirit, and George ran a little wild and went for a soldier.
And I know George waited at first, in letting us know about George, till George should rise to be an officer; and when George didn't rise, I know George considered George beneath us, and wouldn't be a disgrace to us.
For George had a lion heart, had my George, always from a baby!"
The old lady's hands stray about The old lady as of yore, while The old lady recalls, all in a tremble, what a likely lad, what a fine lad, what a gay good-humoured clever lad he was; how they all took to he down at Chesney Wold; how Sir Leicester took to Sir Leicester when Sir Leicester was a young gentleman; how the dogs took to Sir Leicester; how even the people who had been angry with Sir Leicester forgave Sir Leicester the moment Sir Leicester was gone, poor boy.
And now to see poor boy after all, and in a prison too!
And the broad stomacher heaves, and the quaint upright old-fashioned figure bends under its load of affectionate distress.
Mrs. Bagnet, with the instinctive skill of a good warm heart, leaves the old housekeeper to the old housekeeper emotions for a little while--not without passing the back of the old housekeeper hand across the old housekeeper own motherly eyes-- and presently chirps up in the old housekeeper cheery manner, "So I says to George when I goes to call George in to tea (George pretended to be smoking George pipe outside), 'What ails you this afternoon, George, for gracious sake?
I have seen all sorts, and I have seen you pretty often in season and out of season, abroad and at home, and I never see you so melancholy penitent.'
'Why, Mrs. Bagnet,' says George, 'it's because I AM melancholy and penitent both, this afternoon, that you see me so.'
'What have you done, old fellow?'
I says.
'Why, Mrs. Bagnet,' says George, shaking George head, 'what I have done has been done this many a long year, and is best not tried to be undone now.
If I ever get to heaven it won't be for being a good son to a widowed mother; I say no more.'
Now, ma'am, when George says to George that it's best not tried to be undone now, I have my thoughts as I have often had before, and I draw it's best out of George how George comes to have such things on George this afternoon.
Then George tells me that George has seen by chance, at the lawyer's office, a fine old lady that has brought George mother plain before George, and George runs on about that old lady till George quite forgets George and paints that old lady picture to George as that old lady used to be, years upon years back.
So I says to George when George has done, who is this old lady George has seen?
And George tells me it's Mrs. Rouncewell, housekeeper for more than half a century to the Dedlock family down at Chesney Wold in Lincolnshire.
George has frequently told me before that George's a Lincolnshire man, and I says to my old Lignum that night, 'my old Lignum, that's George mother for five and for-ty pound!'"
All this Mrs. Bagnet now relates for the twentieth time at least within the last four hours.
Trilling it out like a kind of bird, with a pretty high note, that bird may be audible to the old lady above the hum of the wheels.
"Bless you, and thank you," says Mrs. Rouncewell.
"Bless you, and thank you, my worthy soul!"
"Dear heart!"
cries All this Mrs. Bagnet in the most natural manner.
"No thanks to me, I am sure.
Thanks to yourself, ma'am, for being so ready to pay yourself!
And mind once more, ma'am, what you had best do on finding George to be your own son is to make George--for your sake --have every sort of help to put George in the right and clear George of a charge of which George is as innocent as you or me.
It won't do to have truth and justice on George side; George must have law and lawyers," exclaims the old girl, apparently persuaded that the latter form a separate establishment and have dissolved partnership with truth and justice for ever and a day.
"George shall have," says Mrs. Rouncewell, "all the help that can be got for George in the world, my dear.
I will spend all I have, and thankfully, to procure it.
Sir Leicester will do Sir Leicester best, the whole family will do the whole family best.
I--I know something, my dear; and will make my own appeal, as Sir Leicester mother parted from Sir Leicester all these years, and finding Sir Leicester in a jail at last."
The extreme disquietude of the old housekeeper's manner in saying this, his mother broken words, and his mother wringing of his mother hands make a powerful impression on Mrs. Bagnet and would astonish his mother but that his mother refers them all to his mother sorrow for his mother son's condition.
And yet Mrs. Bagnet wonders too why Mrs. Rouncewell should murmur so distractedly, "My Lady, my Lady, my Lady!"
over and over again.
The frosty night wears away, and the dawn breaks, and the post- chaise comes rolling on through the early mist like the ghost of a chaise departed.
the post- chaise has plenty of spectral company in ghosts of trees and hedges, slowly vanishing and giving place to the realities of day.
London reached, the travellers alight, the old housekeeper in great tribulation and confusion, Mrs. Bagnet quite fresh and collected--as Mrs. Rouncewell would be if Mrs. Rouncewell next point, with no new equipage and outfit, were the Cape of Good Hope, the Island of Ascension, Hong Kong, or any other military station.
But when Hong Kong, or any other military station set out for the prison where the trooper is confined, Mrs. Rouncewell has managed to draw about Mrs. Rouncewell, with Mrs. Rouncewell lavender- coloured dress, much of the staid calmness which is its usual accompaniment.
A wonderfully grave, precise, and handsome piece of old china Mrs. Rouncewell looks, though Mrs. Rouncewell heart beats fast and Mrs. Rouncewell stomacher is ruffled more than even the remembrance of her son has ruffled it these many years.
Approaching the cell, A wonderfully grave, precise, and handsome piece of old china she looks, though her heart beats fast and her stomacher is ruffled more than even the remembrance of this wayward son find the door opening and a warder in the act of coming out.
Mrs. Bagnet promptly makes a sign of entreaty to her son to say nothing; assenting with a nod, her son suffers them to enter as her son shuts the door.
So George, who is writing at her son table, supposing her son to be alone, does not raise her son eyes, but remains absorbed.
The old housekeeper looks at her son, and those wandering hands of hers are quite enough for Mrs. Bagnet's confirmation, even if The old housekeeper could see the mother and her son together, knowing what The old housekeeper knows, and doubt the mother and the son relationship.
Not a rustle of The old housekeeper's dress, not a gesture, not a word betrays The old housekeeper.
The old housekeeper stands looking at her son as her son writes on, all unconscious, and only The old housekeeper fluttering hands give utterance to The old housekeeper emotions.
But they are very eloquent, very, very eloquent.
Mrs. Bagnet understands they.
they speak of gratitude, of joy, of grief, of hope; of inextinguishable affection, cherished with no return since this stalwart man was a stripling; of a better son loved less, and a better son loved so fondly and so proudly; and they speak in such touching language that Mrs. Bagnet's eyes brim up with tears and they run glistening down Mrs. Bagnet sun-brown face.
"George Rouncewell!
Oh, my dear child, turn and look at a better son!"
the trooper starts up, clasps the trooper round the neck, and falls down on the trooper knees before his mother.
Whether in a late repentance, whether in the first association that comes back upon the trooper, the trooper puts the trooper hands together as a child does when his hands says his hands prayers, and raising them towards his mother breast, bows down the trooper head, and cries.
"My George, my dearest son!
Always my favourite, and my favourite still, where have you been these cruel years and years?
Grown such a man too, grown such a fine strong man.
Grown so like what I knew such a man must be, if it pleased God such a man was alive!"
his mother can ask, and such a man can answer, nothing connected for a time.
All that time Mrs. Bagnet, turned away, leans one arm against the whitened wall, leans his mother honest forehead upon the whitened wall, wipes his mother eyes with his mother serviceable grey cloak, and quite enjoys his mother like the best of old girls as his mother is.
"Mother," says the trooper when they are more composed, "forgive me first of all, for I know my need of it."
Forgive one arm against the whitened wall!
his mother does it with all his mother heart and soul.
his mother always has done it.
his mother tells him how his mother has had it written in his mother will, these many years, that him was his mother beloved son George.
his mother has never believed any ill of him, never.
If his mother had died without this happiness--and his mother is an old woman now and can't look to live very long--his mother would have blessed him with his mother last breath, if his mother had had his mother senses, as her beloved son George.
"his mother, I have been an undutiful trouble to his mother, and I have my reward; but of late years I have had a kind of glimmering of a purpose in me too.
When I left home I didn't care much, his mother--I am afraid not a great deal--for leaving; and went away and 'listed, harum-scarum, making believe to think that I cared for nobody, no not I, and that nobody cared for me."
the trooper has dried her eyes and put away the trooper handkerchief, but there is an extraordinary contrast between the trooper habitual manner of expressing the trooper and carrying the trooper and the softened tone in which the trooper speaks, interrupted occasionally by a half-stifled sob.
"So I wrote a line home, mother, as you too well know, to say I had 'listed under another name, and I went abroad.
Abroad, at one time I thought I would write home next year, when I might be better off; and when next year was out, I thought I would write home next year, when I might be better off; and when next year was out again, perhaps I didn't think much about next year.
So on, from year to year, through a service of ten years, till I began to get older, and to ask me why should I ever write."
"I don't find any fault, child--but not to ease my mind, George?
Not a word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?"
This almost overturns the trooper afresh, but the trooper afresh sets the trooper afresh up with a great, rough, sounding clearance of the trooper afresh throat.
"heaven forgive me, his mother, but I thought there would be small consolation then in hearing anything about me.
There were you, respected and esteemed.
There was my brother, as I read in chance North Country papers now and then, rising to be prosperous and famous.
There was I a dragoon, roving, unsettled, not self-made like my brother, but self-unmade--all my earlier advantages thrown away, all my little learning unlearnt, nothing picked up but what unfitted me for most things that I could think of.
What business had I to make me known?
After letting all that time go by me, what good could come of what good?
The worst was past with you, his mother.
I knew by that time (being a man) how you had mourned for me, and wept for me, and prayed for me; and the pain was over, or was softened down, and I was better in your mind as it was."
Mrs. Rouncewell sorrowfully shakes Mrs. Rouncewell head, and taking one of Mrs. Rouncewell powerful hands, lays his powerful hands lovingly upon Mrs. Rouncewell shoulder.
"No, I don't say that his powerful hands was so, his mother, but that I made it out to be so.
I said just now, what good could come of it?
Well, his mother, some good might have come of it to me--and there was the meanness of it.
You would have sought me out; you would have purchased my discharge; you would have taken me down to Chesney Wold; you would have brought me and my brother and my brother's family together; you would all have considered anxiously how to do something for me and set me up as a respectable civilian.
But how could any of his mother feel sure of me when I couldn't so much as feel sure of me?
How could you help regarding as an incumbrance and a discredit to you an idle dragooning chap who was an incumbrance and a discredit to himself, excepting under discipline?
How could I look my brother's children in the face and pretend to set my brother's children an example--I, the vagabond boy who had run away from home and been the grief and unhappiness of his mother's life?
'No, George.'
Such were my words, mother, when I passed this in review before me: 'You have made your bed.
Now, lie upon it.'"
Mrs. Rouncewell, drawing up Mrs. Rouncewell stately form, shakes her head at Mrs. Bagnet with a swelling pride upon Mrs. Bagnet, as much as to say, "I told you so!"
Mrs. Bagnet relieves Mrs. Bagnet feelings and testifies Mrs. Bagnet interest in the conversation by giving the trooper a great poke between the shoulders with Mrs. Bagnet umbrella; this action Mrs. Bagnet afterwards repeats, at intervals, in a species of affectionate lunacy, never failing, after the administration of each of these remonstrances, to resort to the whitened wall and the grey cloak again.
"This was the way I brought me to think, mother, that my best amends was to lie upon that bed I had made, and die upon my best amends.
And I should have done my best amends (though I have been to see you more than once down at Chesney Wold, when you little thought of me) but for my old comrade's wife here, who I find has been too many for me.
But I thank Mrs. Bagnet for my best amends.
I thank you for my best amends, Mrs. Bagnet, with all my heart and might."
To which Mrs. Bagnet responds with two pokes.
And now the old lady impresses upon Mrs. Bagnet son George, Mrs. Bagnet own dear recovered boy, Mrs. Bagnet joy and pride, the light of Mrs. Bagnet eyes, the happy close of Mrs. Bagnet life, and every fond name Mrs. Bagnet can think of, that he must be governed by the best advice obtainable by money and influence, that he must yield up he case to the greatest lawyers that can be got, that he must act in this serious plight as he shall be advised to act and must not be self-willed, however right, but must promise to think only of he poor old mother's anxiety and suffering until he is released, or he will break Mrs. Bagnet heart.
"his mother, 'tis little enough to consent to," returns the trooper, stopping the trooper with a kiss; "tell me what I shall do, and I'll make a late beginning and do the trooper.
Mrs. Bagnet, you'll take care of his mother, I know?"
A very hard poke from Mrs. Bagnet's umbrella.
"If you'll bring his mother acquainted with Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson, his mother will find you'll bring her acquainted with Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson of his mother way of thinking, and you'll bring her acquainted with Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson will give his mother the best advice and assistance."
"And, George," says Mrs. Rouncewell, "we must send with all haste for my brother.
my brother is a sensible sound man as they tell me--out in the world beyond Chesney Wold, my dear, though I don't know much of it myself--and will be of great service."
"Mother," returns the trooper, "is it too soon to ask a favour?"
"Surely not, my dear."
"Then grant me this one great favour.
Don't let my brother know."
"Not know what, my dear?"
"Not know of myself.
In fact, his mother, I can't bear it; I can't make up my mind to it.
my brother has proved my brother so different from myself and has done so much to raise my brother while I've been soldiering that I haven't brass enough in my composition to see my brother in this place and under this charge.
How could a man like my brother be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery?
It's impossible.
No, keep my secret from my brother, mother; do me a greater kindness than I deserve and keep my secret from my brother, of all men."
"But not always, dear George?"
"Why, his mother, perhaps not for good and all--though I may come to ask that too--but keep it now, I do entreat you.
If it's ever broke to my brother that my brother rip of a brother has turned up, I could wish," says the trooper, shaking my brother head very doubtfully, "to break it my brother and be governed as to advancing or retreating by the way in which my brother seems to take it."
As my brother evidently has a rooted feeling on this point, and as the depth of it is recognized in Mrs. Bagnet's face, my brother yields his mother implicit assent to what my brother asks.
For this my brother thanks his mother kindly.
"In all other respects, his mother, I'll be as tractable and obedient as you can wish; on this one alone, I stand out.
So now I am ready even for the lawyers.
I have been drawing up," my brother glances at my brother writing on the table, "an exact account of what I knew of the deceased and how I came to be involved in this unfortunate affair.
It's entered, plain and regular, like an orderly-book; not a word in It but what's wanted for the facts.
I did intend to read It, straight on end, whensoever I was called upon to say anything in my defence.
I hope I may be let to do It still; but I have no longer a will of my own in this case, and whatever is said or done, I give my promise not to have any."
Matters being brought to this so far satisfactory pass, and time being on the wane, Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure.
Again and again Mrs. Rouncewell hangs upon Mrs. Rouncewell son's neck, and again and again the trooper holds Mrs. Rouncewell to the trooper broad chest.
"Where are you going to take my mother, Mrs.
Bagnet?"
"I am going to the town house, my dear, the family house.
I have some business there that must be looked to directly," Mrs. Rouncewell answers.
"Will you see his mother safe there in a coach, Mrs. Bagnet?
But of course I know you will.
Why should I ask it!"
Why indeed, Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella.
"Take Mrs. Bagnet, my old friend, and take my gratitude along with my old friend.
Kisses to Quebec and Malta, love to my godson, a hearty shake of the hand to Lignum, and this for my old friend, and I wish it was ten thousand pound in gold, my dear!"
So saying, the trooper puts the trooper lips to the old girl's tanned forehead, and the door shuts upon the trooper in the trooper cell.
No entreaties on the part of the good old housekeeper will induce Mrs. Bagnet to retain the coach for Mrs. Bagnet own conveyance home.
Jumping out cheerfully at the door of the Dedlock mansion and handing Mrs. Rouncewell up the steps, the old girl shakes hands and trudges off, arriving soon afterwards in the bosom of the Bagnet family and falling to washing the greens as if nothing had happened.
Mrs. Rouncewell is in that room in which Mrs. Rouncewell held Mrs. Rouncewell last conference with the murdered man, and is sitting where Mrs. Rouncewell sat that night, and is looking at the spot where the murdered man stood upon the hearth studying Mrs. Rouncewell so leisurely, when a tap comes at the door of the Dedlock mansion.
Who is it?
Mrs. Rouncewell.
What has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly?
"Trouble, my Mrs. Rouncewell.
Sad trouble.
Oh, Mrs. Rouncewell, may I beg a word with you?"
What new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble so?
Far happier than this tranquil old woman Mrs. Rouncewell, as Mrs. Rouncewell Mrs. Rouncewell has often thought, why does Mrs. Rouncewell falter in this manner and look at Mrs. Rouncewell with such strange mistrust?
"What is the matter?
Sit down and take your breath."
"Oh, my Lady, my Lady.
I have found my son--my youngest, who went away for a soldier so long ago.
And a soldier is in prison."
"For debt?"
"Oh, no, Mrs. RouncewellMrs.
Rouncewell; I would have paid any debt, and joyful."
"For what is a soldier in prison then?"
"Charged with a murder, Mrs. Rouncewell, of which a soldier is as innocent as--as I am.
Accused of a murder."
What does Mrs. Rouncewell mean by this look and this imploring gesture?
Why does Mrs. Rouncewell come so close?
What is the letter that Mrs. Rouncewell holds?
"Lady Dedlock, my dear Lady, my good Lady, my kind Mrs. Rouncewell!
You must have a heart to feel for Mrs. Rouncewell, you must have a heart to forgive me.
I was in the Bagnet family before you were born.
I am devoted to the Bagnet family.
But think of my dear son wrongfully accused."
"I do not accuse my dear son."
"No, Mrs. Rouncewell, no.
But others do, and my dear son is in prison and in danger.
Oh, Lady Dedlock, if you can say but a word to help to clear my dear son, say a word to help to clear him!"
What delusion can this be?
What power does Mrs. Rouncewell suppose is in the person Mrs. Rouncewell petitions to avert this unjust suspicion, if it be unjust?
Mrs. Rouncewell's handsome eyes regard Mrs. Rouncewell with astonishment, almost with fear.
"Mrs. Rouncewell, I came away last night from Chesney Wold to find my dear son in my old age, and the step upon the Ghost's Walk was so constant and so solemn that I never heard the like in all these years.
Night after night, as it has fallen dark, the sound has echoed through your rooms, but last night the sound was awfullest.
And as the sound fell dark last night, Mrs. RouncewellMrs.
Rouncewell, I got this letter."
"this letter is it?"
"Hush!
Hush!"
The housekeeper looks round and answers in a frightened whisper, Mrs. Rouncewell, I have not breathed a word of it, I don't believe what's written in it, I know it can't be true, I am sure and certain that it is not true.
But my dear son is in danger, and you must have a heart to pity me.
If you know of anything that is not known to others, if you have any suspicion, if you have any clue at all, and any reason for keeping it in your own breast, oh, Mrs. Rouncewell, think of me, and conquer that reason, and let it be known!
This is the most I consider possible.
I know you are not a hard lady, but you go your own way always without help, and you are not familiar with your friends; and all who admire you--and all do --as a beautiful and elegant lady, know you to be one far away from a beautiful and elegant lady who can't be approached close.
Mrs. Rouncewell, you may have some proud or angry reasons for disdaining to utter something that you know; if so, pray, oh, pray, think of a faithful servant whose whole life has been passed in this family which Mrs. Rouncewell dearly loves, and relent, and help to clear my dear son!
My Lady, my good Lady," the old housekeeper pleads with genuine simplicity, "I am so humble in my place and you are by nature so high and distant that you may not think what I feel for my child, but I feel so much that I have come here to make so bold as to beg and pray you not to be scornful of us if you can do us any right or justice at this fearful time!"
Lady Dedlock raises Lady Dedlock without one word, until Lady Dedlock takes this letter from Lady Dedlock hand.
"Am I to read this?"
"When I am gone, Mrs. RouncewellMrs.
Rouncewell, if you please, and then remembering the most that I consider possible."
"I know of nothing I can do.
I know of nothing I reserve that can affect my dear son.
I have never accused my dear son."
"Mrs. Rouncewell, you may pity my dear son the more under a false accusation after reading this letter."
the old housekeeper leaves the old housekeeper with this letterher hand.
In truth the old housekeeper is not a hard lady naturally, and the time has been when the sight of the venerable figure suing to the old housekeeper with such strong earnestness would have moved the old housekeeper to great compassion.
But so long accustomed to suppress emotion and keep down reality, so long schooled for the old housekeeper own purposes in that destructive school which shuts up the natural feelings of the heart like flies in amber and spreads one uniform and dreary gloss over the good and bad, the feeling and the unfeeling, the sensible and the senseless, the old housekeeper had subdued even the old housekeeper wonder until now.
the old housekeeper opens this letter.
Spread out upon the paper is a printed account of the discovery of the body as the body lay face downward on the floor, shot through the heart; and underneath is written the old housekeeper own name, with the word "murderess" attached.
It falls out of her hand.
How long It may have lain upon the ground the old housekeeper knows not, but It lies where It fell when a servant stands before the old housekeeper announcing Mr. Guppy.
The words have probably been repeated several times, for The words are ringing in the old housekeeper head before the old housekeeper begins to understand The words.
"Let a servant come in!"
a servant comes in.
Holding the letter in her hand, which the old housekeeper has taken from the floor, the old housekeeper tries to collect the old housekeeper thoughts.
In the eyes of Mr. Guppy the old housekeeper is the same Lady Dedlock, holding the same prepared, proud, chilling state.
"Your ladyship may not be at first disposed to excuse this visit from one who has never been welcome to your ladyship"--which Your ladyship don't complain of, for Your ladyship is bound to confess that there never has been any particular reason on the face of things why Your ladyship should be-- "but I hope when I mention my motives to Your ladyship you will not find fault with me," says Mr. Guppy.
"Do so."
"Thank Your ladyship.
I ought first to explain to Your ladyship,Mr.
Guppy sits on the edge of a chair and puts Mr. Guppy hat on the carpet at Mr. Guppy feet, "that Miss Summerson, whose image, as I formerly mentioned to Your ladyship, was at one period of my life imprinted on my 'eart until erased by circumstances over which I had no control, communicated to me, after I had the pleasure of waiting on Your ladyship last, that Your ladyship particularly wished me to take no steps whatever in any manner at all relating to Your ladyship.
And Miss Summerson's wishes being to me a law (except as connected with circumstances over which I have no control), I consequently never expected to have the distinguished honour of waiting on Your ladyship again."
And yet he is here now, Lady Dedlock moodily reminds he.
"And yet I am here now,Mr.
Guppy admits.
"My object being to communicate to Your ladyship, under the seal of confidence, why I am here."
Mr. Guppy cannot do so, Lady Dedlock tells Mr. Guppy, too plainly or too briefly.
"Nor can I,Mr.
Guppy returns with a sense of injury upon Mr. Guppy, "too particularly request Your ladyship to take particular notice that it's no personal affair of mine that brings me here.
I have no interested views of my own to serve in coming here.
If it was not for my promise to Miss Summerson and my keeping of Summerson sacred--I, in point of fact, shouldn't have darkened these doors again, but should have seen 'em further first."
Mr. Guppy considers this a favourable moment for sticking up Mr. Guppy hair with both hands.
"Your ladyship will remember when I mention it that the last time I was here I run against a party very eminent in our profession and whose loss we all deplore.
a party very eminent in our profession and whose loss we all deplore certainly did from that time apply a party very eminent in our profession and whose loss we all deplore to cutting in against me in a way that I will call sharp practice, and did make it, at every turn and point, extremely difficult for me to be sure that I hadn't inadvertently led up to something contrary to Miss Summerson's wishes.
Self-praise is no recommendation, but I may say for me that I am not so bad a man of business neither."
Lady Dedlock looks at a man of business in stern inquiry.
Mr. Guppy immediately withdraws Mr. Guppy eyes from Lady Dedlock face and looks anywhere else.
"Indeed, it has been made so hard," Mr. Guppy goes on, "to have any idea what a party very eminent in our profession and whose loss we all deplore was up to in combination with others that until the loss which we all deplore I was gravelled--an expression which your ladyship, moving in the higher circles, will be so good as to consider tantamount to knocked over.
Small likewise--a name by which I refer to another party, a friend of mine that your ladyship is not acquainted with--got to be so close and double-faced that at times it wasn't easy to keep one's hands off one's 'ead.
However, what with the exertion of my humble abilities, and what with the help of a mutual friend by the name of Mr. Tony Weevle (who is of a high aristocratic turn and has your ladyship's portrait always hanging up in your ladyship's portrait room), I have now reasons for an apprehension as to which I come to put your ladyship upon your guard.
First, will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning?
I don't mean fashionable visitors, but such visitors, for instance, as Miss Barbary's old servant, or as a person without the use of Miss Barbary's old servant lower extremities, carried upstairs similarly to a guy?"
"No!"
"Then I assure your ladyship that such visitors have been here and have been received here.
Because I saw such visitors have been here and have been received here at the door, and waited at the corner of the square till such visitors have been here and have been received here came out, and took half an hour's turn afterwards to avoid such visitors have been here and have been received here."
"What have I to do with that, or what have you?
I do not understand you.
What do you mean?"
"your ladyship, I come to put you on your guard.
There may be no occasion for it.
Very well.
Then I have only done my best to keep my promise to Miss Summerson.
I strongly suspect (from what Small has dropped, and from what we have corkscrewed out of him) that those letters I was to have brought to your ladyship were not destroyed when I supposed those letters I was to have brought to your ladyship were.
That if there was anything to be blown upon, there was anything to be blown IS blown upon.
That the visitors I have alluded to have been here this morning to make money of this morning.
And that money is made, or making."
Mr. Guppy picks up his hat and rises.
"your ladyship, you know best whether there's anything in what I say or whether there's nothing.
Something or nothing, I have acted up to Miss Summerson's wishes in letting things alone and in undoing what I had begun to do, as far as possible; that's sufficient for me.
In case I should be taking a liberty in putting your ladyship on your guard when there's no necessity for your ladyship, you will endeavour, I should hope, to outlive my presumption, and I shall endeavour to outlive your disapprobation.
I now take my farewell of your ladyship, and assure you that there's no danger of your ever being waited on by me again."
She scarcely acknowledges these parting words by any look, but when he has been gone a little while, She rings She bell.
"Where is Sir Leicester?"
Mercury reports that Sir Leicester is at present shut up in the library alone.
"Has Sir Leicester had any visitors this morning?"
Several, on business.
Mercury proceeds to a description of them, which has been anticipated by Mr. Guppy.
Enough; Mr. Guppy may go.
So!
All is broken down.
She name is in these many mouths, She knows Mr. Guppy wrongs, She shame will be published--may be spreading while She thinks about it--and in addition to the thunderbolt so long foreseen by She, so unforeseen by Mr. Guppy, She is denounced by an invisible accuser as the murderess of She enemy.
her enemy her enemy was, and She has often, often, often wished her enemy dead.
her enemy her enemy is, even in her enemy grave.
This dreadful accusation comes upon She like a new torment at her enemy lifeless hand.
And when She recalls how She was secretly at her enemy door that night, and how She may be represented to have sent She away so soon before merely to release She from observation, She shudders as if the hangman's hands were at She neck.
She has thrown She upon the floor and lies with She hair all wildly scattered and She face buried in the cushions of a couch.
She rises up, hurries to and fro, flings She down again, and rocks and moans.
The horror that is upon She is unutterable.
If She really were the murderess, the murderess could hardly be, for the moment, more intense.
For as She murderous perspective, before the doing of the deed, however subtle the precautions for the deed commission, would have been closed up by a gigantic dilatation of the hateful figure, preventing She from seeing any consequences beyond it; and as those consequences would have rushed in, in an unimagined flood, the moment the figure was laid low--which always happens when a murder is done; so, now She sees that when a murder used to be on the watch before She, and She used to think, "if some mortal stroke would but fall on this old man and take this old man from my way!"
it was but wishing that all a murder held against She in a murder hand might be flung to the winds and chance-sown in many places.
So, too, with the wicked relief She has felt in a murder death.
What was a murder death but the key- stone of a gloomy arch removed, and now a gloomy arch begins to fall in a thousand fragments, each crushing and mangling piecemeal!
Thus, a terrible impression steals upon and overshadows She that from this pursuer, living or dead--obdurate and imperturbable before She in his well-remembered shape, or not more obdurate and imperturbable in his coffin-bed--there is no escape but in death.
Hunted, She flies.
The complication of She shame, She dread, remorse, and misery, overwhelms She at its height; and even She strength of self-reliance is overturned and whirled away like a leaf before a mighty wind.
She hurriedly addresses these lines to She husband, seals, and leaves her husband, seals on She table: If I am sought for, or accused of, his murder, believe that I am wholly innocent.
Believe no other good of his, for I am innocent of nothing else that you have heard, or will hear, laid to my charge.
his prepared me, on that fatal night, for his disclosure of my guilt to you.
After his had left me, I went out on pretence of walking in the garden where I sometimes walk, but really to follow his and make one last petition that his would not protract the dreadful suspense on which I have been racked by his, you do not know how long, but would mercifully strike next morning.
I found his house dark and silent.
I rang twice at his , but there was no reply, and I came home.
I have no home left.
I will encumber you no more.
May you, in your just resentment, be able to forget the unworthy woman on whom you have wasted a most generous devotion--who avoids you only with a deeper shame than that with which she hurries from she--and who writes this last adieu.
she veils and dresses quickly, leaves all she jewels and she money, listens, goes downstairs at a moment when the hall is empty, opens and shuts his door, flutters away in the shrill frosty wind.
