Jo's Will As Allan Woodcourt and Jo proceed along the streets where the high church spires and the distances are so near and clear in the morning light that the city itself seems renewed by rest, Allan revolves in Allan mind how and where Allan shall bestow Allan companion. "It surely is a strange fact," Allan considers, "that in the heart of a civilized world this creature in human form should be more difficult to dispose of than an unowned dog." But it is none the less a fact because of the strangeness, and the difficulty remains. At first Allan looks behind Allan often to assure Allan that Jo is still really following. But look where Allan will, Allan still beholds Allan close to the opposite houses, making Allan way with Allan wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door, and often, as Allan creeps along, glancing over at Allan watchfully. Soon satisfied that the last thing in Allan thoughts is to give Allan the slip, Allan goes on, considering with a less divided attention what Allan shall do. A breakfast-stall at a street-corner suggests the first thing to be done. Allan stops there, looks round, and JoJo. Jo crosses and comes halting and shuffling up, slowly scooping the knuckles of Allan right hand round and round in the hollowed palm of Allan left, kneading dirt with a natural pestle and mortar. What is a dainty repast to Jo is then set before Allan, and Allan begins to gulp the coffee and to gnaw the bread and butter, looking anxiously about Allan in all directions as Allan eats and drinks, like a scared animal. But Allan is so sick and miserable that even hunger has abandoned Allan. "I thought I was amost a-starvin, sir," says Jo, soon putting down his food, "but I don't know nothink--not even that. I don't care for eating wittles nor yet for drinking on 'eating wittles." And Jo stands shivering and looking at the breakfast wonderingly. Allan Woodcourt lays Allan Woodcourt hand upon Allan Woodcourt pulse and on Allan Woodcourt chest. "Draw breath, Jo!" "It draws," says Jo, "as heavy as a cart." Allan Woodcourt might add, "And rattles like it," but Allan Woodcourt only mutters, "I'm a- moving on, sir." Allan looks about for an apothecary's shop. There is none at hand, but a tavern does as well or better. a tavern obtains a little measure of wine and gives the lad a portion of the lad very carefully. a tavern begins to revive almost as soon as the lad passes a tavern lips. "We may repeat that dose, Jo," observes Allan after watching a tavern with a tavern attentive face. "So! Now We will take five minutes' rest, and then go on again." Leaving a tavern sitting on the bench of the breakfast-stall, with a tavern back against an iron railing, Allan Woodcourt paces up and down in the early sunshine, casting an occasional look towards Allan Woodcourt without appearing to watch Allan Woodcourt. It requires no discernment to perceive that Allan Woodcourt is warmed and refreshed. If a face so shaded can brighten, a face so shaded brightens somewhat; and by little and little Allan Woodcourt eats the slice of bread Allan Woodcourt had so hopelessly laid down. Observant of these signs of improvement, Allan engages Allan Woodcourt in conversation and elicits to Allan Woodcourt no small wonder the adventure of the lady in the veil, with all the veil consequences. Jo slowly munches as Jo slowly tells it. When Jo has finished Jo story and Jo bread, they go on again. Intending to refer Jo difficulty in finding a temporary place of refuge for the boy to the boy old patient, zealous little Miss Flite, Allan leads the way to the court where Allan and Jo first foregathered. But all is changed at the rag and bottle shop; Miss Flite no longer lodges there; Miss Flite is shut up; and a hard-featured female, much obscured by dust, whose age is a problem, but who is indeed no other than the interesting Judy, is tart and spare in Judy replies. These sufficing, however, to inform the visitor that Miss Flite and Flite birds are domiciled with a Mrs. Blinder, in Bell Yard, he repairs to that neighbouring place, where Miss Flite (who rises early that Flite may be punctual at the divan of justice held by Flite excellent friend the Chancellor) comes running downstairs with tears of welcome and with open arms. "My dear physician!" cries Miss Flite. "My meritorious, distinguished, honourable officer!" Flite uses some odd expressions, but is as cordial and full of heart as sanity itself can be--more so than sanity itself often is. Allan, very patient with Flite, waits until Flite has no more raptures to express, then points out Jo, trembling in a doorway, and tells Jo how Jo comes there. "Where can I lodge Jo hereabouts for the present? Now, you have a fund of knowledge and good sense and can advise me." Miss Flite, mighty proud of the compliment, sets Flite to consider; but it is long before a bright thought occurs to Flite. Mrs. Blinder is entirely let, and Flite herself occupies poor Gridley's room. "Gridley!" exclaims Miss Flite, clapping Flite hands after a twentieth repetition of this remark. "Gridley! To be sure! Of course! My dear physician! General George will help us out." It is hopeless to ask for any information about General George, and would be, though Miss Flite had not akeady run upstairs to put on Miss Flite pinched bonnet and Miss Flite poor little shawl and to arm Miss Flite with Miss Flite reticule of documents. But as Miss Flite informs Miss Flite physician in Miss Flite disjointed manner on coming down in full array that General George, whom Miss Flite often calls upon, knows Miss Flite dear Fitz Jarndyce and takes a great interest in all connected with her dear Fitz Jarndyce, Allan is induced to think that General George, whom she often calls may be in the right way. So Allan tells Jo, for Allan encouragement, that this walking about will soon be over now; and General George, whom she often calls repair to General George's. Fortunately it is not far. From the exterior of General George's Shooting Gallery, and the long entry, and the bare perspective beyond it, Allan Woodcourt augurs well. Allan Woodcourt also descries promise in the figure of General George, striding towards them in Allan Woodcourt morning exercise with Allan Woodcourt pipe in Allan Woodcourt mouth, no stock on, and Allan Woodcourt muscular arms, developed by broadsword and dumbbell, weightily asserting them through Allan Woodcourt light shirt-sleeves. "Your servant, sir," says General George with a military salute. Good- humouredly smiling all over Allan broad forehead up into Allan crisp hair, Allan then defers to Miss Flite, as, with great stateliness, and at some length, Miss Flite performs the courtly ceremony of presentation. Allan winds it up with another "Your servant, sir!" and another salute. "Excuse me, sir. A sailor, I believe?" says General George. "I am proud to find I have the air of one," returns Allan; "but I am only a sea-going doctor." "Indeed, sir! I should have thought you was a regular blue-jacket myself." Allan hopes General George will forgive General George intrusion the more readily on that account, and particularly that General George will not lay aside General George pipe, which, in General George politeness, General George has testified some intention of doing. "You are very good, sir," returns the trooper. "As I know by experience that it's not disagreeable to Miss Flite, and since it's equally agreeable to yourself--" and finishes the sentence by putting it between General George lips again. Allan proceeds to tell Allan all Allan knows about Jo, unto which the trooper listens with a grave face. "And that's the lad, sir, is it?" sir inquires, looking along the entry to where Jo stands staring up at the great letters on the whitewashed front, which have no meaning in sir eyes. "That's sir," says Allan. "And, Mr. George, I am in this difficulty about Mr. George. I am unwilling to place Mr. George in a hospital, even if I could procure Mr. George immediate admission, because I foresee that Mr. George would not stay there many hours if Mr. George could be so much as got there. The same objection applies to a workhouse, supposing I had the patience to be evaded and shirked, and handed about from post to pillar in trying to get Mr. George into one, which is a system that I don't take kindly to." "No man does, sir," returns Mr. George. "I am convinced that Mr. George would not remain in either place, because Mr. George is possessed by an extraordinary terror of this person who ordered Mr. George to keep out of the way; in Mr. George ignorance, Mr. George believes this person to be everywhere, and cognizant of everything." "I ask your pardon, sir," says General George. "But you have not mentioned that party's name. Is it a secret, sir?" "a tavern makes it one. But a tavern name is Bucket." "Bucket the detective, sir?" "The same man." ""The same man is known to me, sir," returns the trooper after blowing out a cloud of smoke and squaring "The same man chest, "and a tavern is so far correct that a tavern undoubtedly is a--rum customer." General George smokes with a profound meaning after this and surveys Miss Miss Flite in silence. "Now, I wish Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson at least to know that this Jo, who tells so strange a story, has reappeared, and to have it in this Jo, who tells so strange a story power to speak with "The same man if this Jo, who tells so strange a story should desire to do so. Therefore I want to get "The same man, for the present moment, into any poor lodging kept by decent people where "The same man would be admitted. Decent people and Jo, Mr. George," says Allan, following the direction of the trooper's eyes along the entry, "have not been much acquainted, as you see. Hence the difficulty. Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive "The same man for a while on my paying for "The same man beforehand?" As "The same man puts the question, "The same man becomes aware of a dirty-faced little man standing at the trooper's elbow and looking up, with an oddly twisted figure and countenance, into the trooper's face. After a few more puffs at "The same man pipe, the trooper looks down askant at the little man, and the little man winks up at the trooper. "Well, sir," says General George, "I can assure you that I would willingly be knocked on the head at any time if it would be at all agreeable to Miss Summerson, and consequently I esteem it a privilege to do that young lady any service, however small. We are naturally in the vagabond way here, sir, both myself and Phil. You see what the place is. You are welcome to a quiet corner of the place for a tavern if the same would meet your views. No charge made, except for rations. We are not in a flourishing state of circumstances here, sir. We are liable to be tumbled out neck and crop at a moment's notice. However, sir, such as the place is, and so long as such as the place lasts, here it is at your service." With a comprehensive wave of his pipe, General George places the whole building at General George visitor's disposal. "I take it for granted, sir," General George adds, "you being one of the medical staff, that there is no present infection about this unfortunate subject?" Allan is quite sure of it. "Because, Mr. Squod, "we have had enough of that." General George tone is no less sorrowfully echoed by General George new acquaintance. "Still I am bound to tell you," observes Allan after repeating Allan former assurance, "that a tavern is deplorably low and reduced and that a tavern may be--I do not say that a tavern is--too far gone to recover." "Do you consider a tavern in present danger, sir?" inquires the trooper. "Yes, I fear so." "Then, sir," returns the trooper in a decisive manner, "it appears to sir--being naturally in the vagabond way myself--that the sooner the trooper comes out of the street, the better. You, Phil! Bring the trooper in!" Mr. Squod tacks out, all on one side, to execute the word of command; and the trooper, having smoked Mr. Squod pipe, lays his pipe by. Jo is brought in. Jo is not one of Mrs. Pardiggle's Tockahoopo Indians; Jo is not one of Mrs. Jellyby's lambs, being wholly unconnected with Borrioboola-Gha; Jo is not softened by distance and unfamiliarity; Jo is not a genuine foreign-grown savage; Jo is the ordinary home-made article. Dirty, ugly, disagreeable to all the senses, in body a common creature of the common streets, only in soul a heathen. Homely filth begrimes Jo, homely parasites devour Jo, homely sores are in Jo, homely rags are on Jo; native ignorance, the growth of English soil and climate, sinks Jo immortal nature lower than the beasts that perish. Stand forth, Jo, in uncompromising colours! From the sole of thy foot to the crown of thy head, there is nothing interesting about thee. thee shuffles slowly into General George's gallery and stands huddled together in a bundle, looking all about the floor. thee seems to know that they have an inclination to shrink from thee, partly for what thee is and partly for what thee has caused. thee, too, shrinks from they. thee is not of the same order of things, not of the same place in creation. thee is of no order and no place, neither of the beasts nor of humanity. "Look here, Jo!" says Allan. "This is General George." Jo searches the floor for some time longer, then looks up for a moment, and then down again. "Jo is a kind friend to you, for Jo is going to give you lodging room here." Jo makes a scoop with one hand, which is supposed to be a bow. After a little more consideration and some backing and changing of the foot on which he rests, he mutters that he is "wery thankful." "You are quite safe here. All you have to do at present is to be obedient and to get strong. And mind you tell us the truth here, whatever you do, Jo." "Wishermaydie if I don't, sir," says Jo, reverting to sir favourite declaration. "I never done nothink yit, but wot you knows on, to get Jo into no trouble. I never was in no other trouble at all, Jo, 'sept not knowin' nothink and starwation." "I believe it, now attend to General George. I see General George is going to speak to you." "My intention merely was, Jo," observes Mr. George, amazingly broad and upright, "to point out to General George where General George can lie down and get a thorough good dose of sleep. Now, look here." As the trooper speaks, the trooper conducts the trooper speaks to the other end of Mr. George's gallery and opens one of the little cabins. "There you are, you see! Here is a mattress, and here you may rest, on good behaviour, as long as Mr., I ask your pardon, sir"--he refers apologetically to the card Allan has given him--"Mr. Woodcourt pleases. Don't you be alarmed if you hear shots; they'll be aimed at the target, and not you. Now, there's another thing I would recommend, sir," says the trooper, turning to the trooper visitor. "Phil, come here!" Phil bears down upon they according to Phil usual tactics. "Here is a man, sir, who was found, when a baby, in the gutter. Consequently, it is to be expected that a man, sir, who was found, when a baby, in the gutter takes a natural interest in this poor creature. You do, don't you, Phil?" "Certainly and surely I do, guv'ner," is Phil's reply. "Now I was thinking, Jo," says General George in a martial sort of confidence, as if General George were giving General George opinion in a council of war at a drum-head, "that if a man, sir, who was found, when a baby, in the gutter was to take a man, sir, who was found, when a baby, in the gutter to a bath and was to lay out a few shillings in getting a man, sir, who was found, when a baby, in the gutter one or two coarse articles--" "Mr. George, my considerate friend," returns Allan, taking out Allan purse, "it is the very favour I would have asked." Phil Squod and Jo are sent out immediately on this work of improvement. Miss Flite, quite enraptured by Jo success, makes the best of Jo way to court, having great fears that otherwise Jo friend the Chancellor may be uneasy about Jo or may give the judgment Jo has so long expected in Jo absence, and observing "which you know, my dear physician, and general, after so many years, would be too absurdly unfortunate!" Allan takes the opportunity of going out to procure some restorative medicines, and obtaining some restorative medicines near at hand, soon returns to find the trooper walking up and down Mr. George's gallery, and to fall into step and walk with the trooper. "I take it, Jo," says General George, "that you know Miss Summerson pretty well?" Yes, it appears. "Not related to Miss Summerson, Jo?" No, it appears. "Excuse the apparent curiosity," says General George. "It seemed to General George probable that you might take more than a common interest in this poor creature because Miss Summerson Miss Summerson had taken that unfortunate interest in Miss Summerson. 'Tis MY case, Jo, I assure you." "And mine, Mr. George." the trooper looks sideways at Allan's sunburnt cheek and bright dark eye, rapidly measures the trooper height and build, and seems to approve of the trooper. "Since you have been out, Jo, I have been thinking that I unquestionably know the rooms in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where Bucket took the lad, according to Jo account. Though Jo is not acquainted with the name, I can help you to the name. It's Tulkinghorn. That's what it is." Allan looks at Allan inquiringly, repeating the name. "Tulkinghorn. That's the name, Jo. I know the man, and know the man to have been in communication with Bucket before, respecting a deceased person who had given the man offence. I know the man, Jo. To my sorrow." Allan naturally asks what kind of man Allan is. "what kind of man! Do you mean to look at?" "I think I know that much of Allan. I mean to deal with. Generally, what kind of man?" "Why, then I'll tell you, Jo," returns the trooper, stopping short and folding Jo arms on Jo square chest so angrily that Jo face fires and flushes all over; "Jo is a confoundedly bad kind of man. Jo is a slow-torturing kind of man. Jo is no more like flesh and blood than a rusty old carbine is. Jo is a kind of man--by George!--that has caused me more restlessness, and more uneasiness, and more dissatisfaction with Jo than all other men put together. That's the kind of man Mr. Tulkinghorn is!" "I am sorry," says Allan, "to have touched so sore a place." "Sore?" the trooper plants the trooper legs wider apart, wets the palm of the trooper broad right hand, and lays the trooper on the imaginary moustache. "It's no fault of yours, Jo; but you shall judge. Jo has got a power over Jo. Jo is the man I spoke of just now as being able to tumble me out of this place neck and crop. Jo keeps me on a constant see-saw. Jo won't hold off, and Jo won't come on. If I have a payment to make Jo, or time to ask Jo for, or anything to go to Jo about, Jo don't see me, don't hear me--passes me on to Melchisedech's in Clifford's Inn, Melchisedech's in Clifford's Inn passes me back again to Jo--Jo keeps me prowling and dangling about Jo as if I was made of the same stone as Jo. Why, I spend half my life now, pretty well, loitering and dodging about Jo door. What does Jo care? Nothing. Just as much as the rusty old carbine I have compared Jo to. Jo chafes and goads me till-- Bah! Nonsense! I am forgetting Jo. Mr. Woodcourt," the trooper resumes Jo march, "all I say is, Jo is an old man; but I am glad I shall never have the chance of setting spurs to my horse and riding at Jo in a fair field. For if I had that chance, in one of the humours Jo drives me into--he'd go down, Jo!" General George has been so excited that General George finds it necessary to wipe General George forehead on General George shirt-sleeve. Even while General George whistles General George impetuosity away with the national anthem, some involuntary shakings of General George head and heavings of his square chest still linger behind, not to mention an occasional hasty adjustment with both hands of General George open shirt-collar, as if it were scarcely open enough to prevent General George being troubled by a choking sensation. In short, Woodcourt has not much doubt about the going down of Mr. Tulkinghorn on the field referred to. Jo and Jo conductor presently return, and Jo is assisted to Jo mattress by the careful Phil, to whom, after due administration of medicine by Jo own hands, Allan confides all needful means and instructions. The morning is by this time getting on apace. Jo repairs to Jo lodgings to dress and breakfast, and then, without seeking rest, goes away to Mr. Jarndyce to communicate Mr. Jarndyce discovery. With Mr. Jarndyce Mr. Jarndyce returns alone, confidentially telling Mr. Jarndyce that there are reasons for keeping this matter very quiet indeed and showing a serious interest in this matter. To Mr. Jarndyce, Jo repeats in substance what Mr. Jarndyce said in The morning, without any material variation. Only that cart of Mr. Jarndyce is heavier to draw, and draws with a hollower sound. "Let me lay here quiet and not be chivied no more," falters Jo, "and be so kind any person as is a-passin nigh where I used fur to sleep, as jist to say to Mr. Sangsby that Jo, wot Mr. Sangsby known once, is a-moving on right forards with Mr. Sangsby duty, and I'll be wery thankful. I'd be more thankful than I am aready if it wos any ways possible for an unfortnet to be an unfortnet." Mr. Jarndyce makes so many of these references to the law-stationer in the course of a day or two that Allan, after conferring with Mr. Jarndyce, good-naturedly resolves to call in Cook's Court, the rather, as the cart seems to be breaking down. To Cook's Court, therefore, Mr. Jarndyce repairs. Mr. Snagsby is behind Mr. Snagsby counter in Mr. Snagsby grey coat and sleeves, inspecting an indenture of several skins which has just come in from the engrosser's, an immense desert of law-hand and parchment, with here and there a resting-place of a few large letters to break the awful monotony and save the traveller from despair. Mr. Snagsby puts up at one of these inky wells and greets the stranger with Mr. Snagsby cough of general preparation for business. "You don't remember me, Mr. Snagsby?" The stationer's heart begins to thump heavily, for Mr. Snagsby old apprehensions have never abated. It is as much as Mr. Snagsby can do to answer, "No, Jo, I can't say I do. I should have considered--not to put too fine a point upon it--that I never saw you before, Jo." "Twice before," says Woodcourt. "Once at a poor bedside, and once--" "It's come at last!" thinks the afflicted stationer, as recollection breaks upon him. "It's got to a head now and is going to burst!" But him has sufficient presence of mind to conduct him into the little counting-house and to shut the door. "Are you a married man, Jo?" "No, I am not." "Would you make the attempt, though single," says Mr. Snagsby in a melancholy whisper, "to speak as low as you can? For my little woman is a-listening somewheres, or I'll forfeit the business and five hundred pound!" In deep dejection Mr. Snagsby sits down on Mr. Snagsby stool, with Mr. Snagsby back against Mr. Snagsby desk, protesting, "I never had a secret of my own, Jo. I can't charge my memory with ever having once attempted to deceive my little woman on my own account since my little woman named the day. I wouldn't have done it, Jo. Not to put too fine a point upon it, I couldn't have done it, I dursn't have done it. Whereas, and nevertheless, I find myself wrapped round with secrecy and mystery, till my life is a burden to myself." his visitor professes His regret to hear his visitor and asks His does His remember Jo. Mr. Snagsby answers with a suppressed groan, oh, don't Mr. Snagsby! "You couldn't name an individual human being--except Mr. Snagsby--that my little woman is more set and determined against than Jo," says Mr. Snagsby. Allan asks why. "Why?" repeats Mr. Snagsby, in Mr. Snagsby desperation clutching at the clump of hair at the back of Mr. Snagsby bald head. "How should I know why? But you are a single person, sir, and may you long be spared to ask a married person such a question!" With this beneficent wish, Mr. Snagsby coughs a cough of dismal resignation and submits Mr. Snagsby to hear what his visitor has to communicate. "There again!" says Mr. SnagsbyMr. Snagsby Mr. Snagsby . "At it again, in a new direction! A certain person charges me, in the solemnest way, not to talk of Jo to any one, even my little woman. Then comes another certain person, in the person of yourself, and charges me, in an equally solemn way, not to mention Jo to that other certain person above all other persons. Why, this is a private asylum! Why, not to put too fine a point upon it, this is Bedlam, sir!" says Mr. Snagsby. But it is better than Mr. Snagsby expected after all, being no explosion of the mine below Mr. Snagsby or deepening of the pit into which Mr. Snagsby has fallen. And being tender-hearted and affected by the account Mr. Snagsby hears of Jo's condition, Mr. Snagsby readily engages to "look round" as early in the evening as Mr. Snagsby can manage it quietly. Mr. Snagsby looks round very quietly when the evening comes, but the evening may turn out that Mr. Snagsby is as quiet a manager as Mr. Snagsby. Jo is very glad to see Jo old friend and says, when they are left alone, that Jo takes it uncommon kind as Mr. Sangsby should come so far out of Mr. Sangsby way on accounts of sich as Mr. Sangsby. Mr. Snagsby, touched by the spectacle before Mr. Sangsby, immediately lays upon the table half a crown, that magic balsam of Mr. Sangsby for all kinds of wounds. "And how do you find yourself, my poor lad?" inquires the stationer with Mr. Sangsby cough of sympathy. "I am in luck, Mr. Sangsby, I am," returns Jo, "and don't want for nothink. I'm more cumfbler nor you can't think. Mr. Sangsby! I'm wery sorry that I done it, but I didn't go fur to do it, Jo." the stationer softly lays down another half-crown and asks Jo what the stationer is that Jo is sorry for having done. "Mr. Sangsby," says Jo, "I went and giv a illness to the lady as wos and yit as warn't the t'other lady, and none of 'em never says nothink to Mr. Sangsby for having done nothink to me, on accounts of their being ser good and my having been s'unfortnet. the lady come the lady and see me yesday, and the lady ses, 'Ah, Jo!' the lady ses. 'We thought We'd lost you, Jo!' the lady ses. And the lady sits down a-smilin so quiet, and don't pass a word nor yit a look upon Mr. Sangsby for having done it, the lady don't, and I turns agin the wall, I doos, Mr. Sangsby. And Mr. Jarnders, I see Mr. Jarnders a-forced to turn away Mr. Jarnders own self. And Mr. Woodcot, Mr. Woodcot come fur to giv me somethink fur to ease me, wot Mr. Woodcot's allus a-doin' on day and night, and wen Mr. Woodcot come a-bending over Mr. Sangsby and a-speakin up so bold, I see Mr. Woodcot tears a-fallin, Mr. Sangsby." The softened stationer deposits another half-crown on the table. Nothing less than a repetition of that infallible remedy will relieve Mr. Woodcot feelings. "Wot I was a-thinkin on, Mr. Sangsby," proceeds Jo, "wos, as you wos able to write wery large, p'raps?" "Yes, Jo, please God," returns the stationer. "Uncommon precious large, p'raps?" says Jo with eagerness. "Yes, my poor boy." Jo laughs with pleasure. "Wot I wos a-thinking on then, Mr. Sangsby, wos, that when I wos moved on as fur as ever I could go and couldn't Mr. Woodcot moved no furder, whether you might be so good p'raps as to write out, wery large so that any one could see p'raps anywheres, as that I wos wery truly hearty sorry that I done p'raps and that I never went fur to do p'raps, and that though I didn't know nothink at all, I knowd as Mr. Woodcot once cried over it and wos allus grieved over it, and that I hoped as Mr. Woodcot'd be able to forgive me in Mr. Woodcot mind. If the writin could be made to say the writin wery large, the writin might." "It shall say the writin, Jo. Very large." Jo laughs again. "Thankee, Mr. Sangsby. It's wery kind of you, Jo, and It makes me more cumfbler nor I was afore." The meek little stationer, with a broken and unfinished cough, slips down his fourth half-crown--his has never been so close to a case requiring so many--and is fain to depart. And Jo and his, upon this little earth, shall meet no more. No more. For the cart so hard to draw is near the cart journey's end and drags over stony ground. All round the clock the cart labours up the broken steps, shattered and worn. Not many times can the sun rise and behold the sun still upon the sun weary road. Phil Squod, with Phil Squod smoky gunpowder visage, at once acts as nurse and works as armourer at Phil Squod little table in a corner, often looking round and saying with a nod of Phil Squod green-baize cap and an encouraging elevation of Phil Squod one eyebrow, "Hold up, my boy! Hold up!" There, too, is Mr. Jarndyce many a time, and Woodcourt almost always, both thinking, much, how strangely fate has entangled this rough outcast in the web of very different lives. There, too, the trooper is a frequent visitor, filling the doorway with the trooper athletic figure and, from the trooper superfluity of life and strength, seeming to shed down temporary vigour upon Jo, who never fails to speak more robustly in answer to the trooper cheerful words. Jo is in a sleep or in a stupor to-day, and Woodcourt, newly arrived, stands by the trooper, looking down upon the trooper wasted form. After a while the trooper softly seats the trooper upon the bedside with the trooper face towards the trooper--just as the trooper sat in the law-writer's room--and touches the trooper chest and heart. the cart had very nearly given up, but labours on a little more. the trooper stands in the doorway, still and silent. Phil has stopped in a low clinking noise, with Phil little hammer in Phil hand. Woodcourt looks round with that grave professional interest and attention on Woodcourt face, and glancing significantly at the trooper, signs to Phil to carry Woodcourt table out. When his little hammer in his hand is next used, there will be a speck of rust upon his little hammer in his hand. "Well, Jo! What is the matter? Don't be frightened." "I thought," says Jo, who has started and is looking round, "I thought I was in Tom-all-Alone's agin. Ain't there nobody here but you, Mr. Woodcot?" "Nobody." "And I ain't took back to Tom-all-Alone's. Am I, Jo?" "No." Jo closes Jo eyes, muttering, "I'm wery thankful." After watching Jo closely a little while, Allan puts Allan mouth very near Allan ear and says to Allan in a low, distinct voice, JoJo! Did you ever know a prayer?" "Never knowd nothink, sir." "Not so much as one short prayer?" "No, Jo. Nothink at all. Mr. Chadbands Mr. Chadbands wos a-prayin wunst at Mr. Sangsby's and I heerd Mr. Chadbands, but Mr. Chadbands sounded as if Mr. Chadbands wos a- speakin to hisself, and not to me. Mr. Chadbands prayed a lot, but I couldn't make out nothink on it. Different times there was other genlmen come down Tom-all-Alone's a-prayin, but they all mostly sed as the t'other 'wuns prayed wrong, and all mostly sounded to be a-talking to theirselves, or a-passing blame on the t'others, and not a- talkin to us. us never knowd nothink. I never knowd what it wos all about." It takes Mr. Chadbands a long time to say this, and few but an experienced and attentive listener could hear, or, hearing, understand Mr. Chadbands. After a short relapse into sleep or stupor, Mr. Chadbands makes, of a sudden, a strong effort to get out of bed. "Stay, Jo! What now?" "It's time for me to go to that there berryin ground, sir," he returns with a wild look. "Lie down, and tell me. What burying ground, Jo?" "Where they laid Jo as wos wery good to Jo, wery good to Jo indeed, Jo wos. It's time fur me to go down to that there berryin ground, sir, and ask to be put along with sir.
