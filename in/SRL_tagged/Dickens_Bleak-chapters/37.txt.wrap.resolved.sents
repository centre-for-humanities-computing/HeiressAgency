Esther's Narrative I lay ill through several weeks, and the usual tenor of my life became like an old remembrance.
But this was not the effect of time so much as of the change in all my habits made by the helplessness and inaction of a sick-room.
Before I had been confined to it many days, everything else seemed to have retired into a remote distance where there was little or no separation between the various stages of my life which had been really divided by years.
In falling ill, I seemed to have crossed a dark lake and to have left all my experiences, mingled together by the great distance, on the healthy shore.
My housekeeping duties, though at first it caused me great anxiety to think that they were unperformed, were soon as far off as the oldest of the old duties at Greenleaf or the summer afternoons when I went home from school with my portfolio under my arm, and my childish shadow at my side, to my godmother's house.
I had never known before how short life really was and into how small a space the mind could put the mind.
While I was very ill, the way in which these divisions of time became confused with one another distressed my mind exceedingly.
At once a child, an elder girl, and the little woman I had been so happy as, I was not only oppressed by cares and difficulties adapted to each station, but by the great perplexity of endlessly trying to reconcile them.
I suppose that few who have not been in such a condition can quite understand what I mean or what painful unrest arose from this source.
For the same reason I am almost afraid to hint at that time in my disorder--it seemed one long night, but I believe there were both nights and days in it--when I laboured up colossal staircases, ever striving to reach the top, and ever turned, as I have seen a worm in a garden path, by some obstruction, and labouring again.
I knew perfectly at intervals, and I think vaguely at most times, that I was in my bed; and I talked with Charley, and felt Charley touch, and knew Charley very well; yet I would find Charley complaining, "Oh, more of these never-ending stairs, Charley--more and more--piled up to the sky', I think!"
and labouring on again.
Dare I hint at that worse time when, strung together somewhere in great black space, there was a flaming necklace, or ring, or starry circle of some kind, of which I was one of the beads!
And when my only prayer was to be taken off from the rest and when it was such inexplicable agony and misery to be a part of the dreadful thing?
Perhaps the less I say of these sick experiences, the less tedious and the more intelligible I shall be.
I do not recall these sick experiences to make others unhappy or because I am now the least unhappy in remembering these sick experiences.
It may be that if we knew more of such strange afflictions we might be the better able to alleviate we knew more of such strange afflictions intensity.
The repose that succeeded, the long delicious sleep, the blissful rest, when in my weakness I was too calm to have any care for Charley and could have heard (or so I think now) that I was dying, with no other emotion than with a pitying love for those I left behind--this state can be perhaps more widely understood.
I was in this state when I first shrunk from the light as the light twinkled on Charley once more, and knew with a boundless joy for which no words are rapturous enough that I should see again.
I had heard my Ada crying at the door, day and night; I had heard Ada calling to Charley that I was cruel and did not love Ada; I had heard Ada praying and imploring to be let in to nurse and comfort me and to leave my bedside no more; but I had only said, when I could speak, "Never, my sweet girl, never!"
and I had over and over again reminded Charley that Ada was to keep my darling from the room whether I lived or died.
Charley had been true to Charley in that time of need, and with Ada little hand and Ada great heart had kept the door fast.
But now, my sight strengthening and the glorious light coming every day more fully and brightly on Charley, I could read the letters that my dear wrote to Charley every morning and evening and could put the letters that my dear wrote to me every morning and evening to my lips and lay my cheek upon the letters that my dear wrote to me every morning and evening with no fear of hurting Ada.
I could see my little maid, so tender and so careful, going about the two rooms setting everything in order and speaking cheerfully to my Ada from the open window again.
I could understand the stillness in the house and the thoughtfulness it expressed on the part of all those who had always been so good to Charley.
I could weep in the exquisite felicity of my heart and be as happy in my weakness as ever I had been in my strength.
By and by my strength began to be restored.
Instead of lying, with so strange a calmness, watching what was done for Charley, as if it were done for some one else whom I was quietly sorry for, I helped it a little, and so on to a little more and much more, until I became useful to Charley, and interested, and attached to life again.
How well I remember the pleasant afternoon when I was raised in bed with pillows for the first time to enjoy a great tea-drinking with Charley!
The little creature--sent into the world, surely, to minister to the weak and sick--was so happy, and so busy, and stopped so often in her preparations to lay her head upon my bosom, and fondle me, and cry with joyful tears her was so glad, her was so glad, that I was obliged to say, "Charley, if you go on in this way, I must lie down again, my darling, for I am weaker than I thought I was!"
So "Charley became as quiet as a mouse and took her bright face here and there across and across the two rooms, out of the shade into the divine sunshine, and out of the sunshine into the shade, while I watched her peacefully.
When all her preparations were concluded and the pretty tea-table with its little delicacies to tempt me, and its white cloth, and its flowers, and everything so lovingly and beautifully arranged for Charley by Ada downstairs, was ready at the bedside, I felt sure I was steady enough to say something to "Charley that was not new to my thoughts.
First I complimented "Charley on the room, and indeed the room was so fresh and airy, so spotless and neat, that I could scarce believe I had been lying there so long.
This delighted "Charley, and her face was brighter than before.
"Yet, "Charley," said I, looking round, "I miss something, surely, that I am accustomed to?"
Poor little "Charley looked round too and pretended to shake her head as if there were nothing absent.
"Are the pictures all as they used to be?"
I asked her.
"Every one of they, miss," said "Charley.
"And the furniture, "Charley?"
"Except where I have moved it about to make more room, miss."
"And yet," said I, "I miss some familiar object.
Ah, I know what some familiar object is, "Charley!
It's the looking-glass."
"Charley got up from the table, making as if "Charley had forgotten something, and went into the room; and I heard "Charley sob there.
I had thought of this very often.
I was now certain of this.
I could thank God that this was not a shock to me now.
I called "Charley back, and when "Charley came--at first pretending to smile, but as "Charley drew nearer to me, looking grieved--I took "Charley in my arms and said, "my arms matters very little, "Charley.
I hope I can do without my old face very well."
I was presently so far advanced as to be able to sit up in a great chair and even giddily to walk into the adjoining room, leaning on "Charley.
The mirror was gone from The mirror usual place in the adjoining room too, but what I had to bear was none the harder to bear for that.
My guardian had throughout been earnest to visit me, and there was now no good reason why I should deny me that happiness.
My guardian came one morning, and when My guardian first came in, could only hold me in My guardian embrace and say, "My dear, dear girl!"
I had long known--who could know better?--what a deep fountain of affection and generosity My guardian heart was; and was it not worth my trivial suffering and change to fill such a place in it?
"Oh, yes!"
I thought.
"My guardian has seen me, and My guardian loves me better than My guardian did; My guardian has seen me and is even fonder of me than My guardian was before; and what have I to mourn for!"
My guardian sat down by me on the sofa, supporting me with My guardian arm.
For a little while My guardian sat with My guardian hand over My guardian face, but when My guardian removed his hand, fell into My guardian usual manner.
There never can have been, there never can be, a pleasanter manner.
"My little woman," said My guardian, "what a sad time this has been.
Such an inflexible little woman, too, through all!"
"Only for the best, guardian," said I.
"For the best?"
My guardian repeated tenderly.
"Of course, for the best.
But here have Ada and I been perfectly forlorn and miserable; here has your friend Caddy been coming and going late and early; here has every one about the house been utterly lost and dejected; here has even poor me been writing--to me too--in me anxiety for you!"
I had read of Caddy in Ada's letters, but not of Richard.
I told me so.
"Why, no, my dear," me replied.
"I have thought it better not to mention it to Ada."
"And you speak of me writing to me," said I, repeating me emphasis.
"As if it were not natural for me to do so, guardian; as if me could write to a better friend!"
"me thinks me could, my love," returned my guardian, "and to many a better.
The truth is, me wrote to me under a sort of protest while unable to write to you with any hope of an answer--wrote coldly, haughtily, distantly, resentfully.
Well, dearest little woman, we must look forbearingly on it.
me is not to blame.
Jarndyce and Jarndyce has warped me out of me and perverted me in me eyes.
I have known it do as bad deeds, and worse, many a time.
If two angels could be concerned in it, I believe it would change two angels nature."
"it has not changed yours, guardian."
"Oh, yes, it has, my dear," me said laughingly.
"it has made the south wind easterly, I don't know how often.
me mistrusts and suspects me--goes to lawyers, and is taught to mistrust and suspect me.
Hears I have conflicting interests, claims clashing against me and what not.
Whereas, heaven knows that if I could get out of the mountains of wiglomeration on which my unfortunate name has been so long bestowed (which I can't) or could level them by the extinction of my own original right (which I can't either, and no human power ever can, anyhow, I believe, to such a pass have we got), I would do it this hour.
I would rather restore to me me me proper nature than be endowed with all the money that dead suitors, broken, heart and soul, upon the wheel of Chancery, have left unclaimed with the Accountant-General--and that's money enough, my dear, to be cast into a pyramid, in memory of Chancery's transcendent wickedness."
"IS it possible, guardian," I asked, amazed, "that Richard can be suspicious of you?"
"Ah, my love, my love," Richard said, "it is in the subtle poison of such abuses to breed such diseases.
Richard blood is infected, and objects lose objects natural aspects in Richard sight.
It is not Richard fault."
"But it is a terrible misfortune, guardian."
"it is a terrible misfortune, little woman, to be ever drawn within the influences of Jarndyce and Jarndyce.
I know none greater.
By little and little Richard has been induced to trust in that rotten reed, and that rotten reed communicates some portion of that rotten reed rottenness to everything around Richard.
But again I say with all my soul, we must be patient with me me and not blame me.
What a troop of fine fresh hearts like me have I seen in my time turned by the same means!"
I could not help expressing something of my wonder and regret that me benevolent, disinterested intentions had prospered so little.
"We must not say so, Dame Durden," Dame Durden cheerfully replied; "Ada is the happier, I hope, and that is much.
I did think that I and both these young creatures might be friends instead of distrustful foes and that we might so far counter-act the suit and prove too strong for it.
But it was too much to expect.
Jarndyce and Jarndyce was the curtain of me's cradle."
"But, guardian, may we not hope that a little experience will teach guardian what a false and wretched thing it is?"
"we WILL hope so, my Esther," said Jarndyce, "and that it may not teach Jarndyce so too late.
In any case we must not be hard on Jarndyce.
There are not many grown and matured men living while we speak, good men too, who if they were thrown into this same court as suitors would not be vitally changed and depreciated within three years--within two--within one.
How can we stand amazed at meme?
A young man so unfortunate," here A young man so unfortunate fell into a lower tone, as if A young man so unfortunate were thinking aloud, "cannot at first believe (who could?)
that Chancery is what Chancery is.
A young man so unfortunate looks to Chancery is what it is, flushed and fitfully, to do something with A young man so unfortunate interests and bring his interests to some settlement.
Chancery is what it is procrastinates, disappoints, tries, tortures A young man so unfortunate; wears out A young man so unfortunate sanguine hopes and patience, thread by thread; but A young man so unfortunate still looks to it, and hankers after it, and finds A young man so unfortunate whole world treacherous and hollow.
Well, well, well!
Enough of this, my dear!"
A young man so unfortunate had supported me, as at first, all this time, and A young man so unfortunate tenderness was so precious to me that I leaned my head upon A young man so unfortunate shoulder and loved A young man so unfortunate as if A young man so unfortunate had been my father.
I resolved in my own mind in this little pause, by some means, to see Richard when I grew strong and try to set Richard right.
"There are better subjects than these," said My guardian, "for such a joyful time as the time of our dear girl's recovery.
And I had a commission to broach one of these as soon as I should begin to talk.
When shall Ada come to see you, my love?"
I had been thinking of that too.
A little in connexion with the absent mirrors, but not much, for I knew my loving girl would be changed by no change in my looks.
"My guardian," said I, "as I have shut My guardian out so long--though indeed, indeed, My guardian is like the light to me--" "I know it well, Dame Durden, well."
He was so good, He touch expressed such endearing compassion and affection, and the tone of He voice carried such comfort into my heart that I stopped for a little while, quite unable to go on.
"Yes, yes, you are tired," said He.
"Rest a little."
"As I have kept Ada out so long," I began afresh after a short while, "I think I should like to have my own way a little longer, guardian.
It would be best to be away from here before I see my loving girl.
If "Charley and I were to go to some country lodging as soon as I can move, and if I had a week there in which to grow stronger and to be revived by the sweet air and to look forward to the happiness of having Ada with me again, I think it would be better for us."
I hope it was not a poor thing in me to wish to be a little more used to my altered self before I met the eyes of the dear girl I longed so ardently to see, but it is the truth.
I did.
He understood me, I was sure; but I was not afraid of that.
If it were a poor thing, I knew He would pass it were a poor thing over.
"us spoilt little woman," said My guardian, "shall have Our spoilt little woman own way even in Our spoilt little woman inflexibility, though at the price, I know, of tears downstairs.
And see here!
Here is Boythorn, heart of chivalry, breathing such ferocious vows as never were breathed on paper before, that if you don't go and occupy his whole house, his having already turned out of his whole house expressly for that purpose, by heaven and by earth his'll pull his whole house down and not leave one brick standing on another!"
And My guardian put a letter in my hand, without any ordinary beginning such as "My dear Jarndyce," but rushing at once into the words, "I swear if Miss Summerson do not come down and take possession of my house, which I vacate for Miss Summerson this day at one o'clock, P.M.," and then with the utmost seriousness, and in the most emphatic terms, going on to make the extraordinary declaration My guardian had quoted.
We did not appreciate the writer the less for laughing heartily over the writer, and We settled that I should send My guardian a letter of thanks on the morrow and accept My guardian offer.
It was a most agreeable one to me, for all the places I could have thought of, I should have liked to go to none so well as Chesney Wold.
"Now, little housewife," said My guardian, looking at My guardian watch, "I was strictly timed before I came upstairs, for you must not be tired too soon; and my time has waned away to the last minute.
I have one other petition.
Little Miss Flite, hearing a rumour that you were ill, made nothing of walking down here--twenty miles, poor soul, in a pair of dancing shoes--to inquire.
It was heaven's mercy we were at home, or Little Miss Flite would have walked back again."
The old conspiracy to make me happy!
Everybody seemed to be in it!
"Now, pet," said My guardian, "if it would not be irksome to you to admit the harmless little creature one afternoon before you save Boythorn's otherwise devoted house from demolition, I believe you would make Little Miss Flite prouder and better pleased with Little Miss Flite than I-- though my eminent name is Jarndyce--could do in a lifetime."
I have no doubt My guardian knew there would be something in the simple image of the poor afflicted creature that would fall like a gentle lesson on my mind at that time.
I felt it as My guardian spoke to me.
I could not tell My guardian heartily enough how ready I was to receive Little Miss Flite.
I had always pitied Little Miss Flite, never so much as now.
I had always been glad of my little power to soothe Little Miss Flite under Little Miss Flite calamity, but never, never, half so glad before.
We arranged a time for Little Miss Flite to come out by the coach and share my early dinner.
When My guardian left me, I turned my face away upon my couch and prayed to be forgiven if I, surrounded by such blessings, had magnified to me the little trial that I had to undergo.
The childish prayer of that old birthday when I had aspired to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to do good to some one and win some love to me if I could came back into my mind with a reproachful sense of all the happiness I had since enjoyed and all the affectionate hearts that had been turned towards me.
If I were weak now, what had I profited by those mercies?
I repeated the old childish prayer in its old childish words and found that its old peace had not departed from its old peace.
My guardian now came every day.
In a week or so more I could walk about our rooms and hold long talks with Ada from behind the window-curtain.
Yet I never saw Ada, for I had not as yet the courage to look at the dear face, though I could have done so easily without Ada seeing me.
On the appointed day Little Miss Flite arrived.
The poor little creature ran into my room quite forgetful of Ada usual dignity, and crying from Ada very heart of hearts, "My dear Fitz Jarndyce!"
fell upon my neck and kissed me twenty times.
"Dear me!"
said Ada, putting Ada hand into Ada reticule, "I have nothing here but documents, my dear Fitz Jarndyce; I must borrow a pocket handkerchief."
"Charley gave "Charley one, and the good creature certainly made use of it, for "Charley held it to "Charley eyes with both hands and sat so, shedding tears for the next ten minutes.
"With pleasure, my dear Fitz Jarndyce," "Charley was careful to explain.
"Not the least pain.
Pleasure to see you well again.
Pleasure at having the honour of being admitted to see you.
I am so much fonder of you, my love, than of the Chancellor.
Though I DO attend court regularly.
By the by, my dear, mentioning pocket handkerchiefs--" Miss Flite here looked at Charley, who had been to meet "Charley at the place where the coach stopped.
"Charley glanced at me and looked unwilling to pursue the suggestion.
"Ve-ry right!"
said Miss Flite, "Ve-ry correct.
Truly!
Highly indiscreet of me to mention it; but my dear Miss Fitz Jarndyce, I am afraid I am at times (between ourselves, you wouldn't think it) a little--rambling you know," said Little Miss Flite, touching Little Miss Flite forehead.
"Nothing more."
"What were you going to tell me?"
said I, smiling, for I saw Little Miss Flite wanted to go on.
"You have roused my curiosity, and now you must gratify my curiosity."
Little Miss Flite Little Miss Flite looked at "Charley for advice in this important crisis, who said, "If you please, ma'am, you had better tell then," and therein gratified Little Miss Flite Little Miss Flite beyond measure.
"So sagacious, our young friend," said Little Miss Flite to me in Little Miss Flite mysterious way.
"Diminutive.
But ve-ry sagacious!
Well, my dear, it's a pretty anecdote.
Nothing more.
Still I think it charming.
Who should follow our down the road from the coach, my dear, but a poor person in a very ungenteel bonnet--" "Jenny, if you please, miss," said "Charley.
"Just so!"
Little Miss Flite Little Miss Flite acquiesced with the greatest suavity.
""Jenny.
Ye-es!
And what does "Jenny tell our young friend but that there has been a lady with a veil inquiring at "Jenny cottage after my dear Fitz Jarndyce's health and taking a handkerchief away with "Jenny as a little keepsake merely because it was my amiable Fitz Jarndyce's!
Now, you know, so very prepossessing in a lady with the veil!"
"If you please, miss," said "Charley, to whom I looked in some astonishment, "Jenny "Jenny says that when "Jenny baby died, you left a handkerchief there, and that "Jenny put a handkerchief away and kept a handkerchief with her baby's little things.
I think, if you please, partly because it was yours, miss, and partly because a handkerchief had covered her baby."
"Diminutive," whispered Little Miss Flite, making a variety of motions about Little Miss Flite own forehead to express intellect in "Charley.
"But ex- ceedingly sagacious!
And so dear!
My love, Little Miss Flite's clearer than any counsel I ever heard!"
"Yes, "Charley," I returned.
"I remember it.
Well?"
"Well, miss," said "Charley, "and that's the handkerchief a lady took.
And "Jenny wants you to know that "Jenny wouldn't have made away with it "Jenny for a heap of money but that a lady took it and left some money instead.
"Jenny don't know "Jenny at all, if you please, miss!"
"Why, who can "Jenny be?"
said I.
"My love," Miss Flite suggested, advancing "Jenny lips to my ear with "Jenny most mysterious look, "in MY opinion--don't mention this to our diminutive friend--"Jenny's the Lord Chancellor's wife.
our diminutive friend's married, you know.
And I understand "Jenny leads our diminutive friend a terrible life.
Throws our diminutive friend lordship's papers into the fire, my dear, if our diminutive friend won't pay the jeweller!"
I did not think very much about a lady then, for I had an impression that it might be Caddy.
Besides, my attention was diverted by my visitor, who was cold after a lady ride and looked hungry and who, our dinner being brought in, required some little assistance in arraying a lady with great satisfaction in a pitiable old scarf and a much-worn and often-mended pair of gloves, which a lady had brought down in a paper parcel.
I had to preside, too, over the entertainment, consisting of a dish of fish, a roast fowl, a sweetbread, vegetables, pudding, and Madeira; and it was so pleasant to see how a lady enjoyed it, and with what state and ceremony a lady did honour to it, that I was soon thinking of nothing else.
When our had finished and had our little dessert before our, embellished by the hands of my dear, who would yield the superintendence of everything prepared for me to no one, Little Miss Flite was so very chatty and happy that I thought I would lead Little Miss Flite to Little Miss Flite own history, as Little Miss Flite was always pleased to talk about Little Miss Flite.
I began by saying "You have attended on the Chancellor many years, Little Miss Flite?"
"Oh, many, many, many years, my dear.
But I expect a judgment.
Shortly."
There was an anxiety even in Little Miss Flite hopefulness that made me doubtful if I had done right in approaching the subject.
I thought I would say no more about it.
"My father expected a judgment," said Little Miss Flite.
"My brother.
My sister.
They all expected a judgment.
The same that I expect."
"They all are all--" "Ye-es.
Dead of course, my dear," said My sister.
As I saw My sister would go on, I thought it best to try to be serviceable to My sister by meeting the theme rather than avoiding the theme.
"Would it not be wiser," said I, "to expect a judgment no more?"
"Why, my dear," My sister answered promptly, "of course "of course would!"
"And to attend the court no more?"
"Equally of course," said My sister.
"Very wearing to be always in expectation of what never comes, my dear Fitz Jarndyce!
Wearing, I assure you, to the bone!"
My sister slightly showed me My sister arm, and her arm was fearfully thin indeed.
"But, my dear," My sister went on in My sister mysterious way, "there's a dreadful attraction in the place.
Hush!
Don't mention it to our diminutive friend when My sister comes in.
Or it may frighten My sister.
With good reason.
There's a cruel attraction in the place.
You CAN'T leave CAN'T.
And you MUST expect."
I tried to assure My sister that this was not so.
My sister heard me patiently and smilingly, but was ready with My sister own answer.
"Aye, aye, aye!
You think so because I am a little rambling.
Ve- ry absurd, to be a little rambling, is it not?
Ve-ry confusing, too.
To the head.
I find it so.
But, my dear, I have been there many years, and I have noticed.
It's the mace and seal upon the table."
What could they do, did My sister think?
I mildly asked My sister.
"Draw," returned Little Miss Flite.
"Draw people on, my dear.
Draw peace out of people.
Sense out of people.
Good looks out of people.
Good qualities out of people.
I have felt people even drawing my rest away in the night.
Cold and glittering devils!"
My sister tapped me several times upon her arm and nodded good-humouredly as if My sister were anxious I should understand that I had no cause to fear My sister, though My sister spoke so gloomily, and confided these awful secrets to me.
"Let me see," said My sister.
"I'll tell you my own case.
Before people ever drew me--before I had ever seen people--what was it I used to do?
Tambourine playing?
No.
Tambour work.
I and My sister worked at tambour work.
Our father and Our brother had a builder's business.
Our father and our brother lived together.
Ve-ry respectably, my dear!
First, Our was drawn--slowly.
Home was drawn with My father.
In a few years My father was a fierce, sour, angry bankrupt without a kind word or a kind look for any one.
My father had been so different, Fitz Jarndyce's.
My father was drawn to a debtors' prison.
There My father died.
Then our brother was drawn--swiftly--to drunkenness.
And rags.
And death.
Then My sister was drawn.
Hush!
Never ask to what!
Then I was ill and in misery, and heard, as I had often heard before, that this was all the work of Chancery.
When I got better, I went to look at the monster.
And then I found out how it was, and I was drawn to stay there."
Having got over My sister own short narrative, in the delivery of which My sister had spoken in a low, strained voice, as if the shock were fresh upon My sister, My sister gradually resumed My sister usual air of amiable importance.
"You don't quite credit me, my dear!
Well, well!
You will, some day.
I am a little rambling.
But I have noticed.
I have seen many new faces come, unsuspicious, within the influence of the mace and seal in these many years.
As My father's came there.
As our brother's.
As My sister's.
As my own.
I hear Conversation Kenge and the rest of them say to the new faces, 'Here's little Miss Flite.
Oh, you are new here; and you must come and be presented to little Miss Flite!'
Ve-ry good.
Proud I am sure to have the honour!
And we all laugh.
But, Fitz Jarndyce's, I know what will happen.
I know, far better than they do, when the attraction has begun.
I know the signs, my dear.
I saw they begin in Gridley.
And I saw they end.
Fitz Jarndyce's, my love," speaking low again, "I saw they beginning in our young friend the ward in Fitz Jarndyce's.
Let some one hold our young friend back.
Or our young friend'll be drawn to ruin."
She looked at me in silence for some moments, with She face gradually softening into a smile.
Seeming to fear that She had been too gloomy, and seeming also to lose the connexion in She mind, She said politely as She sipped She glass of wine, "Yes, my dear, as I was saying, I expect a judgment shortly.
Then I shall release my birds, you know, and confer estates."
I was much impressed by She allusion to Richard and by the sad meaning, so sadly illustrated in She poor pinched form, that made its way through all She incoherence.
But happily for She, She was quite complacent again now and beamed with nods and smiles.
"But, my dear," She said, gaily, reaching another hand to put it upon mine.
"You have not congratulated me on my physician.
Positively not once, yet!"
I was obliged to confess that I did not quite know what She meant.
"My physician, Mr. Woodcourt, my dear, who was so exceedingly attentive to me.
Though My physician, Mr. Woodcourt, my dear, who was so exceedingly attentive to me services were rendered quite gratuitously.
Until the Day of Judgment.
I mean THE judgment that will dissolve the spell upon me of the mace and seal."
"Mr. Woodcourt is so far away, now," said I, "that I thought the time for such congratulation was past, Little Miss Flite."
"But, my child," my child returned, "is it possible that you don't know what has happened?"
"No," said I.
"Not what everybody has been talking of, Fitz Jarndyce'sFitz Jarndyce's!"
"No," said I.
"You forget how long I have been here."
"True!
my dear, for the moment--true.
I blame me.
But my memory has been drawn out of me, with everything else, by what I mentioned.
Ve-ry strong influence, is it not?
Well, my dear, there has been a terrible shipwreck over in those East Indian seas."
"Mr. Woodcourt shipwrecked!"
"Don't be agitated, my dear.
Mr. Woodcourt is safe.
An awful scene.
Death in all shapes.
Hundreds of dead and dying.
Fire, storm, and darkness.
Numbers of the drowning thrown upon a rock.
There, and through it all, my physician was a hero.
Calm and brave through everything.
Saved many lives, never complained in hunger and thirst, wrapped naked people in my physician spare clothes, took the lead, showed naked people what to do, governed naked people, tended the sick, buried the dead, and brought the poor survivors safely off at last!
my dear, the poor emaciated creatures all but worshipped my dear.
naked people fell down at my dear feet when naked people got to the land and blessed my dear.
The whole country rings with The whole country.
Stay!
Where's my bag of documents?
I have got The whole country there, and you shall read The whole country, you shall read The whole country!"
And I DID read all the noble history, though very slowly and imperfectly then, for my eyes were so dimmed that I could not see the words, and I cried so much that I was many times obliged to lay down the long account she had cut out of the newspaper.
I felt so triumphant ever to have known the man who had done such generous and gallant deeds, I felt such glowing exultation in my dear renown, I so admired and loved what my dear had done, that I envied the storm-worn people who had fallen at his feet and blessed my dear as their preserver.
I could my dear have kneeled down then, so far away, and blessed my dear in my rapture that my dear should be so truly good and brave.
I felt that no one--mother, sister, wife--could honour my dear more than I. I did, indeed!
My poor little visitor made me a present of the account, and when as the evening began to close in she rose to take she leave, lest she should miss the coach by which she was to return, she was still full of the shipwreck, which I had not yet sufficiently composed my dear to understand in all My poor little visitor details.
"my dear," said she as she carefully folded up she scarf and gloves, "my brave physician ought to have a title bestowed upon "my brave physician.
And no doubt "my brave physician will.
You are of that opinion?"
That "my brave physician well deserved one, yes.
That "my brave physician would ever have one, no.
"Why not, Fitz Jarndyce's?"
she asked rather sharply.
I said it was not the custom in England to confer titles on men distinguished by peaceful services, however good and great, unless occasionally when occasionally consisted of the accumulation of some very large amount of money.
"Why, good gracious," said Little Miss Flite, "how can you say that?
Surely you know, my dear, that all the greatest ornaments of England in knowledge, imagination, active humanity, and improvement of every sort are added to its nobility!
Look round you, my dear, and consider.
YOU must be rambling a little now, I think, if you don't know that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the land!"
I am afraid she believed what she said, for there were moments when she was very mad indeed.
And now I must part with the little secret I have thus far tried to keep.
I had thought, sometimes, that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that if Mr. Woodcourt had been richer Mr. Woodcourt would perhaps have told me that Mr. Woodcourt loved me before Mr. Woodcourt went away.
I had thought, sometimes, that if Mr. Woodcourt had done so, I should have been glad of it.
But how much better it was now that this had never happened!
What should I have suffered if I had had to write to Mr. Woodcourt and tell Mr. Woodcourt that the poor face Mr. Woodcourt had known as mine was quite gone from Mr. Woodcourt and that I freely released Mr. Woodcourt from Mr. Woodcourt bondage to one whom Mr. Woodcourt had never seen!
Oh, it was so much better as it was!
With a great pang mercifully spared me, I could take back to my heart my childish prayer to be all a great pang had so brightly shown a great pang; and there was nothing to be undone: no chain for me to break or for a great pang to drag; and I could go, please God, my lowly way along the path of duty, and a great pang could go a great pang nobler way upon its broader road; and though we were apart upon the journey, I might aspire to meet a great pang, unselfishly, innocently, better far than a great pang had thought me when I found some favour in a great pang eyes, at the journey's end.
