More Old Soldiers Than One Mr. George has not far to ride with folded arms upon the box, for their destination is Lincoln's Inn Fields.
When the driver stops the driver horses, Mr. George alights, and looking in at the window, says, "What, Mr. Tulkinghorn's your man, is Mr.
Tulkinghorn?"
"Yes, my dear friend.
Do you know Mr. Tulkinghorn, Mr.
George?"
"Why, I have heard of Mr. George--seen Mr. George too, I think.
But I don't know Mr. George, and Mr. George don't know me."
There ensues the carrying of Mr. Smallweed upstairs, which is done to perfection with the trooper's help.
Mr. George is borne into Mr. Tulkinghorn's great room and deposited on the Turkey rug before the fire.
Mr. Tulkinghorn is not within at the present moment but will be back directly.
The occupant of the pew in the hall, having said thus much, stirs the fire and leaves the triumvirate to warm the pew.
Mr. George is mightily curious in respect of Mr. Tulkinghorn's great room.
Mr. George looks up at the painted ceiling, looks round at the old law-books, contemplates the portraits of the great clients, reads aloud the names on the boxes.
"'Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,'" Mr. George reads thoughtfully.
"Ha!
'Manor of Chesney Wold.'
Humph!"
Mr. George stands looking at the boxes a long while--as if the boxes were pictures--and comes back to the fire repeating, "Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and Manor of Chesney Wold, hey?"
"Worth a mint of money, Mr.
George!"
whispers Grandfather Smallweed, rubbing " whispers Grandfather Smallweed legs.
"Powerfully rich!"
"Who do you mean?
This old gentleman, or the Baronet?"
"This gentleman, this gentleman."
"So I have heard; and knows a thing or two, I'll hold a wager.
Not bad quarters, either," says Mr. George, looking round again.
"See the strong-box yonder!"
This reply is cut short by Mr. Tulkinghorn's arrival.
There is no change in Mr. George, of course.
Rustily drest, with Mr. George spectacles in Mr. George hand, and their very case worn threadbare.
In manner, close and dry.
In voice, husky and low.
In face, watchful behind a blind; habitually not uncensorious and contemptuous perhaps.
The peerage may have warmer worshippers and faithfuller believers than Mr. Tulkinghorn, after all, if everything were known.
"Good morning, Mr. Smallweed, good morning!"
he says as he comes in.
"You have brought the sergeant, I see.
Sit down, sergeant."
As Mr. Tulkinghorn takes off Mr. Tulkinghorn gloves and puts them in Mr. Tulkinghorn hat, Mr. Tulkinghorn looks with half-closed eyes across the room to where the trooper stands and says within the trooper perchance, "You'll do, my friend!"
"Sit down, sergeant," the trooper repeats as the trooper comes to the trooper table, which is set on one side of the fire, and takes the trooper easy-chair.
"Cold and raw this morning, cold and raw!Mr.
Tulkinghorn warms before the bars, alternately, the palms and knuckles of Mr. Tulkinghorn hands and looks (from behind that blind which is always down) at the trio sitting in a little semicircle before Mr. Tulkinghorn.
"Now, I can feel what I am about" (as perhaps Mr. Tulkinghorn can in two senses), "Mr.
Smallweed."
The old gentleman is newly shaken up by Judy to bear The old gentleman part in the conversation.
"You have brought my friend the sergeant, I see."
"Yes, sir," returns "Mr. Smallweed, very servile to the lawyer's wealth and influence.
"And what does the sergeant say about this business?"
"Mr. George," says Grandfather Smallweed with a tremulous wave of Grandfather Smallweed shrivelled hand, "this is the gentleman, sir."
" "Mr. George salutes The old gentleman but otherwise sits bolt upright and profoundly silent--very forward in " "Mr. George , as if the full complement of regulation appendages for a field-day hung about " "Mr. George.
Mr. Tulkinghorn proceeds, "Well, " "Mr. George--I believe your name is " "Mr.
George?"
"your name is so, sir."
"What do you say, " "Mr.
George?"
"I ask your pardon, sir," returns the trooper, "but I should wish to know what YOU say?"
"Do you mean in point of reward?"
"I mean in point of everything, sir."
This is so very trying to "Mr. Smallweed's temper that "Mr. Smallweed suddenly breaks out with "You're a brimstone beast!"
and as suddenly asks pardon of Mr. Tulkinghorn, excusing "Mr. Smallweed for this slip of the tongue by saying to Judy, "I was thinking of your grandmother, my dear."
"I supposed, sergeant," Mr. Tulkinghorn resumes as "Mr. Smallweed leans on one side of "Mr. Smallweed and crosses "Mr. Smallweed legs, "that "Mr. Smallweed might have sufficiently explained the matter.
the matter lies in the smallest compass, however.
You served under Captain Hawdon at one time, and were Captain Hawdon attendant in illness, and rendered Captain Hawdon many little services, and were rather in Captain Hawdon confidence, I am told.
That is so, is it not?"
"Yes, sir, that is so," says Mr. George with military brevity.
"Therefore you may happen to have in your possession something-- anything, no matter what; accounts, instructions, orders, a letter, anything--in Captain Hawdon writing.
I wish to compare Captain Hawdon's writing with some that I have.
If you can give me the opportunity, you shall be rewarded for your trouble.
Three, four, five, guineas, you would consider handsome, I dare say."
"Noble, my dear friend!"
cries Grandfather Smallweed, screwing up Grandfather Smallweed eyes.
"If not, say how much more, in your conscience as a soldier, you can demand.
There is no need for you to part with the writing, against your inclination--though I should prefer to have it."
Mr. George with military brevity sits squared in exactly the same attitude, looks at the painted ceiling, and says never a word.
Grandfather Smallweed scratches the air.
"The question is," says Mr. Tulkinghorn in Grandfather Smallweed methodical, subdued, uninterested way, "first, whether you have any of Captain Hawdon writing?"
"First, whether I have any of Captain Hawdon writing, sir," repeats Mr. George with military brevity.
"Secondly, what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it?"
"Secondly, what will satisfy me for the trouble of producing it, sir," repeats Mr. George with military brevity.
"Thirdly, you can judge for yourself whether it is at all like that," says Grandfather Smallweed, suddenly handing Grandfather Smallweed some sheets of written paper tied together.
"Whether it is at all like that, sir.
Just so," repeats Mr. George with military brevity.
All three repetitions Mr. George with military brevity pronounces in a mechanical manner, looking straight at Grandfather Smallweed; nor does Grandfather Smallweed so much as glance at the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, that has been given to Grandfather Smallweed for Grandfather Smallweed inspection (though Grandfather Smallweed still holds his inspection in Grandfather Smallweed hand), but continues to look at the lawyer with an air of troubled meditation.
"Well?"
says Grandfather Smallweed.
"What do you say?"
"Well, sir," replies Mr. George, rising erect and looking immense, "I would rather, if you'll excuse me, have nothing to do with this."
Mr. Tulkinghorn, outwardly quite undisturbed, demands, "Why not?"
"Why, sir," returns the trooper.
"Except on military compulsion, I am not a man of business.
Among civilians I am what civilians call in Scotland a ne'er-do-weel.
I have no head for papers, sir.
I can stand any fire better than a fire of cross questions.
I mentioned to Mr. Smallweed, only an hour or so ago, that when I come into things of this kind I feel as if I was being smothered.
And that is my sensation," says Mr. George, looking round upon the company, "at the present moment."
With that, Mr. George takes three strides forward to replace the papers on the lawyer's table and three strides backward to resume Mr. George former station, where Mr. George stands perfectly upright, now looking at the ground and now at the painted ceiling, with Mr. George hands behind Mr. George as if to prevent Mr. George from accepting any other document whatever.
Under this provocation, Mr. Smallweed's favourite adjective of disparagement is so close to Mr. Smallweed tongue that Mr. Smallweed begins the words "my dear friend" with the monosyllable "brim," thus converting the possessive pronoun into brimmy and appearing to have an impediment in Mr. Smallweed speech.
Once past this difficulty, however, Mr. Smallweed exhorts Mr. Smallweed dear friend in the tenderest manner not to be rash, but to do what so eminent a gentleman requires, and to do it with a good grace, confident that it must be unobjectionable as well as profitable.
Mr. Tulkinghorn merely utters an occasional sentence, as, "You are the best judge of your own interest, sergeant."
"Take care you do no harm by this."
"Please yourself, please yourself."
"If you know what you mean, that's quite enough."
These Mr. Tulkinghorn utters with an appearance of perfect indifference as Mr. Tulkinghorn looks over the papers on Mr. Tulkinghorn table and prepares to write a letter.
Mr. Tulkinghorn looks distrustfully from the painted ceiling to the ground, from the ground to Mr. Smallweed, from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Tulkinghorn, and from Mr. Tulkinghorn to the painted ceiling again, often in Mr. Tulkinghorn perplexity changing the leg on which Mr. Tulkinghorn rests.
"I do assure you, sir," says Mr. George, "not to say it offensively, that between you and Mr. Smallweed here, I really am being smothered fifty times over.
I really am, sir.
I am not a match for you gentlemen.
Will you allow me to ask why you want to see the captain's hand, in the case that I could find any specimen of the captain's hand?"
Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly shakes Mr. Tulkinghorn head.
"No.
If you were a man of business, sergeant, you would not need to be informed that there are confidential reasons, very harmless in there are confidential reasons, very harmless in themselves, for many such wants in the profession to which I belong, for many such wants in the profession to which I belong.
But if you are afraid of doing any injury to Captain Hawdon, you may set your mind at rest about that."
"Aye!
Aye is dead, sir."
"IS Aye?"
Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly sits down to write.
"Well, sir," says the trooper, looking into Mr. Tulkinghorn after another disconcerted pause, "I am sorry not to have given you more satisfaction.
If it would be any satisfaction to any one that I should be confirmed in my judgment that I would rather have nothing to do with this by a friend of mine who has a better head for business than I have, and who is an old soldier, I am willing to consult with an old soldier.
I--I really am so completely smothered Mr. Tulkinghorn at present," says " "Mr. George, passing " "Mr. George hand hopelessly across " "Mr. George brow, "that I don't know but what it might be a satisfaction to Mr.
Tulkinghorn."
"Mr. Smallweed, hearing that this authority is an old soldier, so strongly inculcates the expediency of the trooper's taking counsel with "Mr. Smallweed, and particularly informing "Mr. Smallweed of this authority being a question of five guineas or more, that Mr. George with military brevity engages to go and see "Mr. Smallweed.
Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing either way.
"I'll consult my friend, then, by your leave, sir," says the trooper, "and I'll take the liberty of looking in again with the final answer in the course of the day.
Mr. Smallweed, if you wish to be carried downstairs--" "In a moment, my dear friend, in a moment.
Will you first let me speak half a word with The old gentleman in private?"
"Certainly, sir.
Don't hurry my friend on my account."
the trooper retires to a distant part of the room and resumes the trooper curious inspection of the boxes, strong and otherwise.
"If I wasn't as weak as a brimstone baby, sir," whispers Grandfather Smallweed, drawing the lawyer down to the lawyer level by the lapel of the lawyer coat and flashing some half-quenched green fire out of the lawyer angry eyes, "I'd tear the writing away from the lawyer.
the lawyer's got the writing buttoned in the lawyer breast.
I saw the lawyer put the writing there.
Judy saw the lawyer put the writing there.
Speak up, you crabbed image for the sign of a walking- stick shop, and say you saw the lawyer put the sign of a walking- stick shop there!"
This vehement conjuration The old gentleman accompanies with such a thrust at the lawyer granddaughter that it is too much for the lawyer strength, and the lawyer slips away out of the lawyer , drawing Grandfather Smallweed with the lawyer, until the lawyer is arrested by Judy, and well shaken.
"Violence will not do for me, my friend," Mr. Tulkinghorn then remarks coolly.
"No, no, I know, I know, sir.
But it's chafing and galling--it's-- it's worse than your smattering chattering magpie of a grandmother," to the imperturbable Judy, who only looks at the fire, "to know he has got what's wanted and won't give it up.
he, not to give it up!
HE!
A vagabond!
But never mind, sir, never mind.
At the most, sir has only sir own way for a little while.
I have sir periodically in a vice.
I'll twist sir, sir.
I'll screw sir, sir.
If sir won't do it with a good grace, I'll make sir do it with a bad one, sir!
Now, my dear Mr. George," says Grandfather Smallweed, winking at the lawyer hideously as the lawyer releases the lawyer, "I am ready for your kind assistance, my excellent friend!"
Mr. Tulkinghorn, with some shadowy sign of amusement manifesting itself through Mr. Tulkinghorn self-possession, stands on the hearth-rug with Mr. Tulkinghorn back to the fire, watching the disappearance of "Mr. Smallweed and acknowledging the trooper's parting salute with one slight nod.
It is more difficult to get rid of the old gentleman, Mr. George with military brevity finds, than to bear a hand in carrying Mr. George with military brevity downstairs, for when Mr. George with military brevity is replaced in Mr. George with military brevity conveyance, Mr. George with military brevity is so loquacious on the subject of the guineas and retains such an affectionate hold of Mr. George with military brevity button --having, in truth, a secret longing to rip Mr. George with military brevity coat open and rob Mr. George with military brevity--that some degree of force is necessary on the trooper's part to effect a separation.
It is accomplished at last, and Mr. George with military brevity proceeds alone in quest of Mr. George with military brevity adviser.
By the cloisterly Temple, and by Whitefriars (there, not without a glance at Hanging-Sword Alley, which would seem to be something in Mr. George with military brevity way), and by Blackfriars Bridge, and Blackfriars Road, Mr. George with military brevity sedately marches to a street of little shops lying somewhere in that ganglion of roads from Kent and Surrey, and of streets from the bridges of London, centring in the far-famed elephant who has lost Mr. George with military brevity castle formed of a thousand four-horse coaches to a stronger iron monster than Mr. George with military brevity, ready to chop Mr. George with military brevity into mince-meat any day Mr. George with military brevity dares.
To one of the little shops in this street, which is a musician's shop, having a few fiddles in the window, and some Pan's pipes and a tambourine, and a triangle, and certain elongated scraps of music, Mr. George with military brevity directs Mr. George with military brevity massive tread.
And halting at a few paces from it, as Mr. George with military brevity sees a soldierly looking woman, with a soldierly looking woman outer skirts tucked up, come forth with a small wooden tub, and in that tub commence a-whisking and a-splashing on the margin of the pavement, Mr. Tulkinghorn says to Mr. Tulkinghorn, "a soldierly looking woman's as usual, washing greens.
I never saw a soldierly looking woman, except upon a baggage-waggon, when a soldierly looking woman wasn't washing greens!"
The subject of this reflection is at all events so occupied in washing greens at present that a soldierly looking woman remains unsuspicious of Mr. Tulkinghorn's approach until, lifting up a soldierly looking woman and a soldierly looking woman tub together when a soldierly looking woman has poured the water off into the gutter, a soldierly looking woman finds Mr. Tulkinghorn standing near a soldierly looking woman.
a soldierly looking woman reception of Mr. Tulkinghorn is not flattering.
"Mr. George with military brevity, I never see you but I wish you was a hundred mile away!"
the trooper, without remarking on this welcome, follows into the musical-instrument shop, where the lady places the lady tub of greens upon the counter, and having shaken hands with Mr. Tulkinghorn, rests the lady arms upon her arms.
"I never," the lady says, Mr. George with military brevityMr.
George with military brevity, consider Matthew Bagnet safe a minute when you're near Matthew Bagnet.
You are that restless and that roving--" "Yes!
I know I am, Matthew Bagnet.
I know I am."
"You know you are!"
says Matthew Bagnet.
"What's the use of that?
WHY are you?"
"The nature of the animal, I suppose," returns the trooper good- humouredly.
"Ah!"
cries Matthew Bagnet, something shrilly.
"But what satisfaction will The nature of the animal the animal be to me when the animal shall have tempted my Mat away from the musical business to New Zealand or Australey?"
Matthew Bagnet is not at all an ill-looking woman.
Rather large- boned, a little coarse in the grain, and freckled by the sun and wind which have tanned Matthew Bagnet hair upon the forehead, but healthy, wholesome, and bright-eyed.
A strong, busy, active, honest-faced woman of from forty-five to fifty.
Clean, hardy, and so economically dressed (though substantially) that the only article of ornament of which Matthew Bagnet stands possessed appear's to be Matthew Bagnet wedding-ring, around which Matthew Bagnet finger has grown to be so large since her finger was put on that her finger will never come off again until her finger shall mingle with Matthew Bagnet's dust.
"Matthew Bagnet," says the trooper, "I am on my parole with Matthew Bagnet.
my Mat will get no harm from my Mat.
You may trust me so far."
"Well, I think I may.
But the very looks of Matthew Bagnet are unsettling," Matthew Bagnet rejoins.
"Ah, George, Mr. George with military brevity!
If you had only settled down and married Joe Pouch's widow when Joe Pouch's died in North America, SHE'D have combed your hair for you had only settled down and married Joe Pouch's widow when he died in North America."
"It was a chance for my Mat, certainly," returns the trooper half laughingly, half seriously, "but I shall never settle down into a respectable man now.
Joe Pouch's widow might have done me good-- there was something in Joe Pouch's widow, and something of Joe Pouch's widow--but I couldn't make up my mind to it.
If I had had the luck to meet with such a wife as my Mat found!"
Mrs. Bagnet, who seems in a virtuous way to be under little reserve with a good sort of fellow, but to be another good sort of fellow herself for that matter, receives this compliment by flicking " "Mr. George in the face with a head of greens and taking Joe Pouch's widow tub into the little room behind the shop.
"Why, Quebec, my poppet," says Mr. George with military brevity, following, on invitation, into that department.
"And little Malta, too!
Come and kiss your Bluffy!"
These young ladies--not supposed to have been actually christened by the names applied to them, though always so called in the family from the places of them birth in barracks--are respectively employed on three-legged stools, the younger (some five or six years old) in learning her letters out of a penny primer, the elder (eight or nine perhaps) in teaching her and sewing with great assiduity.
Both hail Mr. George with military brevity with acclamations as an old friend and after some kissing and romping plant their stools beside Mr. George with military brevity.
"And how's young Woolwich?"
says Mr. George with military brevity.
"Ah!
There now!"
cries Matthew Bagnet, turning about from Matthew Bagnet saucepans (for Matthew Bagnet is cooking dinner) with a bright flush on Matthew Bagnet face.
"Would you believe it?
Got an engagement at the theayter, with his father, to play the fife in a military piece."
"Well done, my godson!"
cries Mr. George with military brevity, slapping Mr. George with military brevity thigh.
"I believe you!"
says Matthew Bagnet.
"Matthew Bagnet's a Briton.
That's what young Woolwich is.
A Briton!"
"And my Mat blows away at my Mat bassoon, and you're respectable civilians one and all," says Mr. George with military brevity.
"Family people.
Children growing up.
Mat's old mother in Scotland, and your old father somewhere else, corresponded with, and helped a little, and--well, well!
To be sure, I don't know why I shouldn't be wished a hundred mile away, for I have not much to do with all this!"
Mr. George with military brevity is becoming thoughtful, sitting before the fire in the whitewashed room, which has a sanded floor and a barrack smell and contains nothing superfluous and has not a visible speck of dirt or dust in it, from the faces of Quebec and Malta to the bright tin pots and pannikins upon the dresser shelves--Mr. Mr. George with military brevity is becoming thoughtful, sitting here while Matthew Bagnet is busy, when Mr. Bagnet and young Woolwich opportunely come home.
Matthew Bagnet is an ex- artilleryman, tall and upright, with shaggy eyebrows and whiskers like the fibres of a coco-nut, not a hair upon Matthew Bagnet head, and a torrid complexion.
Matthew Bagnet voice, short, deep, and resonant, is not at all unlike the tones of the instrument to which Matthew Bagnet is devoted.
Indeed there may be generally observed in Matthew Bagnet an unbending, unyielding, brass-bound air, as if Matthew Bagnet were Matthew Bagnet the bassoon of the human orchestra.
young Woolwich is the type and model of a young drummer.
Both father and son salute the trooper heartily.
Both father and son saying, in due season, that Both father and son has come to advise with Matthew Bagnet, Matthew Bagnet hospitably declares that Matthew Bagnet will hear of no business until after dinner and that Matthew Bagnet friend shall not partake of Matthew Bagnet counsel without first partaking of boiled pork and greens.
The trooper yielding to this invitation, Matthew Bagnet and Mr. Bagnet, not to embarrass the domestic preparations, go forth to take a turn up and down the little street, which they promenade with measured tread and folded arms, as if it were a rampart.
"Mr. George with military brevity," says Matthew Bagnet.
"You know me.
It's my old girl that advises.
my old girl that advises has the head.
But I never own to it before my old girl that advises.
Discipline must be maintained.
Wait till the greens is off my old girl that advises mind.
Then we'll consult.
Whatever my old girl that advises says, do--do it!"
"I intend to, my Mat," replies the other.
"I would sooner take my old girl that advises opinion than that of a college."
"College," returns Matthew Bagnet in short sentences, bassoon-like.
"What college could you leave--in another quarter of the world-- with nothing but a grey cloak and an umbrella--to make a grey cloak and an umbrella way home to Europe?
my old girl that advises would do it to-morrow.
Did it once!"
"You are right," says Mr. George with military brevity.
"What college," pursues Bagnet, "could you set up in life--with two penn'orth of white lime--a penn'orth of fuller's earth--a ha'porth of sand--and the rest of the change out of sixpence in money?
That's what my old girl that advises started on.
In the present business."
"I am rejoiced to hear it's thriving, my Mat."
"my old girl that advises," says Mr. Bagnet, acquiescing, "saves.
Has a stocking somewhere.
With money in it.
I never saw it.
But I know my old girl that advises's got it.
Wait till the greens is off her mindher mind.
Then my old girl that advises'll set you up."
"my old girl that advises is a treasure!"
exclaims Mr. George with military brevity.
"my old girl that advises's more.
But I never own to it before my old girl that advises.
Discipline must be maintained.
It was the old girl that brought out my musical abilities.
I should have been in the artillery now but for my old girl that advises.
Six years I hammered at the fiddle.
Ten at the flute.
my old girl that advises said it wouldn't do; intention good, but want of flexibility; try the bassoon.
my old girl that advises borrowed a bassoon from the bandmaster of the Rifle Regiment.
I practised in the trenches.
Got on, got another, get a living by it!"
Mr. George with military brevity remarks that my old girl that advises looks as fresh as a rose and as sound as an apple.
"my old girl that advises," says Mr. Bagnet in reply, "is a thoroughly fine woman.
Consequently my old girl that advises is like a thoroughly fine day.
Gets finer as my old girl that advises gets on.
I never saw my old girl that advises's equal.
But I never own to it before my old girl that advises.
Discipline must be maintained!"
Proceeding to converse on indifferent matters, indifferent matters walk up and down the little street, keeping step and time, until summoned by Quebec and Malta Malta to do justice to the pork and greens, over which Matthew Bagnet, like a military chaplain, says a short grace.
In the distribution of these comestibles, as in every other household duty, Matthew Bagnet developes an exact system, sitting with every dish before Matthew Bagnet, allotting to every portion of pork every portion of pork own portion of pot-liquor, greens, potatoes, and even mustard, and serving every portion of pork out complete.
Having likewise served out the beer from a can and thus supplied the mess with all things necessary, Matthew Bagnet proceeds to satisfy Matthew Bagnet own hunger, which is in a healthy state.
The kit of the mess, if the table furniture may be so denominated, is chiefly composed of utensils of horn and tin that have done duty in several parts of the world.
young Woolwich's knife, in particular, which is of the oyster kind, with the additional feature of a strong shutting-up movement which frequently balks the appetite of that young musician, is mentioned as having gone in various hands the complete round of foreign service.
The dinner done, Matthew Bagnet, assisted by the younger branches (who polish their own cups and platters, knives and forks), makes all the dinner garniture shine as brightly as before and puts it all away, first sweeping the hearth, to the end that Mr. Bagnet and the visitor may not be retarded in the smoking of Mr. Bagnet and the visitor pipes.
These household cares involve much pattening and counter-pattening in the backyard and considerable use of a pail, which is finally so happy as to assist in the ablutions of Matthew Bagnet.
my old girl that advises reappearing by and by, quite fresh, and sitting down to my old girl that advises needlework, then and only then--the greens being only then to be considered as entirely off my old girl that advises mind--Mr. Bagnet requests the trooper to state Bagnet case.
Mr. George with military brevity does with great discretion, appearing to address Mr. George with military brevity to Matthew Bagnet, but having an eye solely on the old girl all the time, as Bagnet has Mr. George with military brevity.
my old girl that advises, equally discreet, busies my old girl that advises with her needlework.
his case fully stated, Matthew Bagnet resorts to Matthew Bagnet standard artifice for the maintenance of discipline.
"That's the whole of it, is it, Mr. George with military brevity?"
says Mr. George with military brevity.
"That's the whole of it."
"You act according to my opinion?"
"I shall be guided," replies Mr. George with military brevity, "entirely by it."
"Old girl," says Matthew Bagnet, "give Matthew Bagnet my opinion.
You know my opinion.
Tell Matthew Bagnet what my opinion is."
It is that Matthew Bagnet cannot have too little to do with people who are too deep for Matthew Bagnet and cannot be too careful of interference with matters Matthew Bagnet does not understand--that the plain rule is to do nothing in the dark, to be a party to nothing underhanded or mysterious, and never to put Matthew Bagnet foot where Matthew Bagnet cannot see the ground.
This, in effect, is Mr. Bagnet's opinion, as delivered through my old girl that advises, and it so relieves Mr. George with military brevity's mind by confirming Mr. George with military brevity own opinion and banishing Mr. George with military brevity doubts that Mr. George with military brevity composes Mr. George with military brevity to smoke another pipe on that exceptional occasion and to have a talk over old times with the whole Bagnet family, according to the whole Bagnet family various ranges of experience.
Through these means it comes to pass that Mr. George with military brevity does not again rise to Mr. George with military brevity full height in that parlour until the time is drawing on when the bassoon and fife are expected by a British public at the theatre; and as it takes time even then for Mr. George with military brevity, in Mr. George with military brevity domestic character of Bluffy, to take leave of Quebec and Malta Malta and insinuate a sponsorial shilling into the pocket of Mr. George with military brevity godson with felicitations on Mr. George with military brevity success in life, it is dark when Mr. George with military brevity again turns Mr. George with military brevity face towards Lincoln's Inn Fields.
"A family home," Mr. George with military brevity ruminates as Mr. George with military brevity marches along, "however small it is, makes a man like me look lonely.
But it's well I never made that evolution of matrimony.
I shouldn't have been fit for that evolution of matrimony.
I am such a vagabond still, even at my present time of life, that I couldn't hold to the gallery a month together if it was a regular pursuit or if I didn't camp there, gipsy fashion.
Come!
I disgrace nobody and cumber nobody; that's something.
I have not done that for many a long year!"
So Mr. George with military brevity whistles it off and marches on.
Arrived in Lincoln's Inn Fields and mounting Mr. Tulkinghorn's stair, Mr. George with military brevity finds the outer door closed and the chambers shut, but the trooper not knowing much about outer doors, and the staircase being dark besides, the trooper is yet fumbling and groping about, hoping to discover a bell-handle or to open the outer door for the trooper, when Mr. Tulkinghorn comes up the stairs (quietly, of course) and angrily asks, "Who is that?
What are you doing there?"
"I ask your pardon, sir.
It's Mr. George with military brevity.
The sergeant."
"And couldn't Mr. George with military brevity, the sergeant, see that the outer door was locked?"
"Why, no, sir, I couldn't.
At any rate, I didn't," says the trooper, rather nettled.
"Have you changed your mind?
Or are you in the same mind?Mr.
Tulkinghorn demands.
But Mr. Tulkinghorn knows well enough at a glance.
"In the same mind, sir."
"I thought so.
That's sufficient.
You can go.
So you are the man," says Mr. Tulkinghorn, opening the outer door with the key, "in whose hiding-place Mr. Gridley was found?"
"Yes, I AM the man," says the trooper, stopping two or three stairs down.
"What then, sir?"
"What then?
I don't like your associates.
You should not have seen the inside of the outer door this morning if I had thought of your being that man.
Gridley?
A threatening, murderous, dangerous fellow."
With these words, spoken in an unusually high tone for the man, the lawyer goes into the lawyer rooms and shuts the outer door with a thundering noise.
Mr. George with military brevity takes Mr. George with military brevity dismissal in great dudgeon, the greater because a clerk coming up the stairs has heard the last words of all and evidently applies them to Mr. George with military brevity.
"A pretty character to bear," the trooper growls with a hasty oath as the trooper strides downstairs.
"A threatening, murderous, dangerous fellow!"
And looking up, the trooper sees a clerk coming up the stairs looking down at the trooper and marking the trooper as the trooper passes a lamp.
This so intensifies the trooper dudgeon that for five minutes the trooper is in an ill humour.
But the trooper whistles that off like the rest of it and marches home to the shooting gallery.
