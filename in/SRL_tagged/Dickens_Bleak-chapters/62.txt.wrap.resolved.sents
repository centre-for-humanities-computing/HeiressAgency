Esther's Narrative It was three o'clock in the morning when the houses outside London did at last begin to exclude the country and to close us in with streets.
us had made us way along roads in a far worse condition than when us had traversed them by daylight, both the fall and the thaw having lasted ever since; but the energy of my companion never slackened.
the energy of my companion had only been, as I thought, of less assistance than the horses in getting us on, and the energy of my companion had often aided less assistance than the horses in getting us on.
less assistance than the horses in getting us on had stopped exhausted half-way up hills, less assistance than the horses in getting us on had been driven through streams of turbulent water, less assistance than the horses in getting us on had slipped down and become entangled with the harness; but he and he little lantern had been always ready, and when the mishap was set right, I had never heard any variation in he cool, "Get on, my lads!"
The steadiness and confidence with which he had directed us journey back I could not account for.
Never wavering, he never even stopped to make an inquiry until us were within a few miles of London.
A very few words, here and there, were then enough for he; and thus us came, at between three and four o'clock in the morning, into Islington.
I will not dwell on the suspense and anxiety with which I reflected all this time that us were leaving my mother farther and farther behind every minute.
I think I had some strong hope that he must be right and could not fail to have a satisfactory object in following this woman, but I tormented myself with questioning it and discussing it during the whole journey.
What was to ensue when us found this woman and what could compensate us for this loss of time were questions also that I could not possibly dismiss; my mind was quite tortured by long dwelling on such reflections when us stopped.
us stopped in a high-street where there was a coach-stand.
My companion paid us two drivers, who were as completely covered with splashes as if they had been dragged along the roads like the carriage itself, and giving they some brief direction where to take it, lifted me out of it and into a hackney-coach he had chosen from the rest.
"Why, my dear!"
he said as he did this.
"How wet you are!"
I had not been conscious of this.
But the melted snow had found this way into the carriage itself, and I had got out two or three times when a fallen horse was plunging and had to be got up, and the wet had penetrated my dress.
I assured he it was no matter, but the driver, who knew he, would not be dissuaded by he from running down the street to he stable, whence he brought an armful of clean dry straw.
They shook it out and strewed it well about he, and I found it warm and comfortable.
"Now, my dear," said Mr. Bucket, with Mr. Bucket head in at the window after I was shut up.
"We're a-going to mark this person down.
It may take a little time, but you don't mind that.
You're pretty sure that I've got a motive.
Ain't you?"
I little thought what it was, little thought in how short a time I should understand it better, but I assured he that I had confidence in he.
"So you may have, my dear," he returned.
"And I tell you what!
If you only repose half as much confidence in he as I repose in you after what I've experienced of you, that'll do.
Lord!
You're no trouble at all.
I never see a young woman in any station of society--and I've seen many elevated ones too--conduct a young woman like you have conducted you since you was called out of your bed.
You're a pattern, you know, that's what you are," said Mr. Bucket warmly; "you're a pattern."
I told Mr. Bucket I was very glad, as indeed I was, to have been no hindrance to Mr. Bucket, and that I hoped I should be none now.
"my dear," Mr. Bucket returned, "when a young lady is as mild as a young lady game, and as game as a young lady's mild, that's all I ask, and more than I expect.
a young lady then becomes a queen, and that's about what you are you."
With these encouraging words--these encouraging words really were encouraging to he under those lonely and anxious circumstances--Mr. Bucket got upon the box, and we once more drove away.
Where we drove I neither knew then nor have ever known since, but we appeared to seek out the narrowest and worst streets in London.
Whenever I saw Mr. Bucket directing the driver, I was prepared for we descending into a deeper complication of such streets, and we never failed to do so.
Sometimes we emerged upon a wider thoroughfare or came to a larger building than the generality, well lighted.
Then we stopped at offices like those we had visited when we began we journey, and I saw Mr. Bucket in consultation with others.
Sometimes Mr. Bucket would get down by an archway or at a street corner and mysteriously show the light of Mr. Bucket little lantern.
This would attract similar lights from various dark quarters, like so many insects, and a fresh consultation would be held.
By degrees we appeared to contract we search within narrower and easier limits.
Single police-officers on duty could now tell Mr. Bucket what Mr. Bucket wanted to know and point to Mr. Bucket where to go.
At last we stopped for a rather long conversation between Mr. Bucket and one of these men, which I supposed to be satisfactory from Mr. Bucket manner of nodding from time to time.
When it was finished Mr. Bucket came to me looking very busy and very attentive.
"Now, Miss Summerson," Mr. Bucket said to me, "you won't be alarmed whatever comes off, I know.
It's not necessary for me to give you any further caution than to tell you that we have marked this person down and that you may be of use to me before I know it me.
I don't like to ask such a thing, my dear, but would you walk a little way?"
Of course I got out directly and took this person arm.
"It ain't so easy to keep your feet," said Mr. Bucket, "but take time."
Although I looked about me confusedly and hurriedly as we crossed the street, I thought I knew the place.
"Are we in Holborn?"
I asked Mr. Bucket.
"Yes," said Mr. Bucket.
"Do you know this turning?"
"this turning looks like Chancery Lane."
"And was christened so, my dear," said Mr. Bucket.
we turned down it, and as we went shuffling through the sleet, I heard the clocks strike half-past five.
we passed on in silence and as quickly as we could with such a foot-hold, when some one coming towards we on the narrow pavement, wrapped in a cloak, stopped and stood aside to give me room.
In the same moment I heard an exclamation of wonder and my own name from Mr. Woodcourt.
I knew his voice very well.
It was so unexpected and so--I don't know what to call his voice, whether pleasant or painful--to come upon his voice after my feverish wandering journey, and in the midst of the night, that I could not keep back the tears from my eyes.
It was like hearing his voice in a strange country.
"My dear Miss Summerson, that you should be out at this hour, and in such weather!"
his had heard from my guardian of my having been called away on some uncommon business and said so to dispense with any explanation.
I told his that we had but just left a coach and were going--but then I was obliged to look at my companion.
"Why, you see, Mr. Woodcourt"--he had caught the name from me--"we are a-going at present into the next street.
Inspector Bucket."
Mr. Woodcourt, disregarding my remonstrances, had hurriedly taken off Mr. Woodcourt cloak and was putting his cloak about Mr. Woodcourt.
"That's a good move, too," said Inspector Bucket, assisting, "a very good move."
"May I go with you?"
said Mr. Woodcourt.
I don't know whether to me or to my companion.
"Why, Mr.
Woodcourt!"
exclaimed Inspector Bucket, taking the answer on Inspector Bucket.
"Of course you may."
It was all said in a moment, and they took me between they, wrapped in his cloak.
"I have just left Richard," said Mr. Woodcourt.
"I have been sitting with Mr. Woodcourt since ten o'clock last night."
"Oh, dear me, Mr. Woodcourt is ill!"
"No, no, believe me; not ill, but not quite well.
Mr. Woodcourt was depressed and faint--you know Mr. Woodcourt gets so worried and so worn sometimes--and Ada sent to Mr. Woodcourt of course; and when I came home I found her note and came straight here.
Well!
Richard revived so much after a little while, and Ada was so happy and so convinced of Ada being my doing, though God knows I had little enough to do with Ada, that I remained with Richard until Richard had been fast asleep some hours.
As fast asleep as her is now, I hope!"
Richard friendly and familiar way of speaking of them, Richard unaffected devotion to them, the grateful confidence with which I knew Richard had inspired my darling, and the comfort Richard was to her; could I separate all this from Richard promise to Mr. Woodcourt?
How thankless I must have been if all this had not recalled the words Richard said to Mr. Woodcourt when Richard was so moved by the change in my appearance: "I will accept Richard as a trust, and it shall be a sacred one!"
We now turned into another narrow street.
"Mr. Woodcourt," said Mr. Bucket, who had eyed Mr. Woodcourt closely as We came along, "We business takes We to a law-stationer's here, a certain Mr. Snagsby's.
What, you know Richard, do you?"
Richard was so quick that Richard saw it in an instant.
"Yes, I know a little of Richard and have called upon Richard at this place."
"Indeed, sir?"
said Mr. Bucket.
"Then you will be so good as to let me leave Miss Summerson with you for a moment while I go and have half a word with Summerson?"
The last police-officer with whom he had conferred was standing silently behind We.
I was not aware of it until The last police-officer with whom he had conferred struck in on my saying I heard some one crying.
"Don't be alarmed, miss," The last police-officer with whom he had conferred returned.
"It's Snagsby's servant."
"Why, you see," said Mr. Bucket, "the girl's subject to fits, and has 'em bad upon her to-night.
A most contrary circumstance it is, for I want certain information out of that girl, and that girl must be brought to reason somehow."
"At all events, all events wouldn't be up yet if it wasn't for that girl, Mr. Bucket," said the other man.
"that girl's been at it pretty well all night, sir."
"Well, that's true," sir returned.
"My light's burnt out.
Show yours a moment."
All this passed in a whisper a door or two from the house in which I could faintly hear crying and moaning.
In the little round of light produced for the purpose, Mr. Bucket went up to the door and knocked.
the door was opened after Mr. Bucket had knocked twice, and Mr. Bucket went in, leaving us standing in the street.
"Miss Summerson," said Mr. Woodcourt, "if without obtruding Mr. Bucket on your confidence I may remain near Mr. Woodcourt, pray let me do so."
"You are truly kind," I answered.
"I need wish to keep no secret of my own from Mr. Woodcourt; if I keep any, it is another's."
"I quite understand.
Trust me, I will remain near Mr. Woodcourt only so long as I can fully respect it."
"I trust implicitly to Mr. Woodcourt," I said.
"I know and deeply feel how sacredly you keep your promise."
After a short time the little round of light shone out again, and Mr. Bucket advanced towards us in it with Mr. Bucket earnest face.
"Please to come in, Miss Summerson," Mr. Bucket said, "and sit down by the fire.
Mr. Woodcourt, from information I have received I understand you are a medical man.
Would you look to that girl and see if anything can be done to bring that girl round.
that girl has a letter somewhere that I particularly want.
It's not in that girl box, and I think it must be about that girl; but that girl is so twisted and clenched up that that girl is difficult to handle without hurting."
We all three went into the house together; although it was cold and raw, the house smelt close too from being up all night.
In the passage behind the door stood a scared, sorrowful-looking little man in a grey coat who seemed to have a naturally polite manner and spoke meekly.
"Downstairs, if you please, Mr. Bucket," said Mr. Bucket.
"that girl will excuse the front kitchen; we use the front kitchen as we workaday sitting-room.
The back is Guster's bedroom, and in The back that girl's a-carrying on, poor thing, to a frightful extent!"
we went downstairs, followed by Mr. Snagsby, as I soon found the little man to be.
In the front kitchen, sitting by the fire, was Mr. Snagsby, with very red eyes and a very severe expression of face.
"My little woman," said Mr. Snagsby, entering behind we, "to wave-- not to put too fine a point upon it, my dear--hostilities for one single moment in the course of this prolonged night, here is Inspector Bucket, Mr. Woodcourt, and a lady."
My little woman looked very much astonished, as My little woman had reason for doing, and looked particularly hard at me.
"My little woman," said Mr. Snagsby, sitting down in the remotest corner by the door, as if Mr. Snagsby were taking a liberty, "it is not unlikely that you may inquire of me why Inspector Bucket, Mr. Woodcourt, and a lady call upon us in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, at the present hour.
I don't know.
I have not the least idea.
If I was to be informed, I should despair of understanding, and I'd rather not be told."
He appeared so miserable, sitting with He head upon He hand, and I appeared so unwelcome, that I was going to offer an apology when Mr. Bucket took the matter on Mr. Bucket.
"Now, Mr. Snagsby," said Mr. Snagsby, "the best thing you can do is to go along with Mr. Woodcourt to look after your Guster--" "My Guster, Mr.
Bucket!"
cried Mr. Snagsby.
"Go on, sir, go on.
I shall be charged with that next."
"And to hold the candle," pursued Mr. Bucket without correcting Mr. Bucket, "or hold her, or make yourself useful in any way you're asked.
Which there's not a man alive more ready to do, for you're a man of urbanity and suavity, you know, and you've got the sort of heart that can feel for another.
Mr. Woodcourt, would you be so good as see to Mr. Woodcourt, and if you can get that letter from Mr. Woodcourt, to let me have that letter as soon as ever you can?"
As they went out, Mr. Bucket made me sit down in a corner by the fire and take off my wet shoes, which Mr. Bucket turned up to dry upon the fender, talking all the time.
"Don't you be at all put out, miss, by the want of a hospitable look from Mr. Snagsby, because Mr. Woodcourt's under a mistake altogether.
Mr. Woodcourt'll find that out sooner than will be agreeable to a lady of Mr. Woodcourt generally correct manner of forming Mr. Woodcourt thoughts, because I'm a-going to explain it to Mr.
Woodcourt."
Here, standing on the hearth with his wet hat and shawls in his hand, himself a pile of wet, his turned to Mr. Snagsby.
"Now, the first thing that I say to you, as a married woman possessing what you may call charms, you know--'Believe Me, if All Those Endearing,' and cetrer--you're well acquainted with the song, because it's in vain for you to tell me that you and good society are strangers--charms--attractions, mind you, that ought to give you confidence in yourself--is, that you've done it."
Mr. Snagsby looked rather alarmed, relented a little and faltered, what did Mr. Bucket mean.
"What does Mr. Bucket mean?"
Mr. Bucket repeated, and I saw by Mr. Bucket face that all the time Mr. Bucket talked Mr. Bucket was listening for the discovery of the letter, to my own great agitation, for I knew then how important it must be; "I'll tell you what Mr. Bucket means, ma'am.
Go and see Othello acted.
That's the tragedy for you."
Mr. Snagsby consciously asked why.
"Why?"
said Mr. Bucket.
"Because you'll come to that if you don't look out.
Why, at the very moment while I speak, I know what your mind's not wholly free from respecting that girl.
But shall I tell you who that girl is?
Now, come, you're what I call an intellectual woman--with your soul too large for your body, if you come to that, and chafing your body--and you know me, and you recollect where you saw me last, and what was talked of in that circle.
Don't you?
Yes!
Very well.
that girl is that girl."
Mr. Snagsby appeared to understand the reference better than I did at the time.
"And Toughey--him as you call Jo--was mixed up in the same business, and no other; and the law-writer that you know of was mixed up in the same business, and no other; and your husband, with no more knowledge of it than your great grandfather, was mixed up (by Mr. Tulkinghorn, deceased, his best customer) in the same business, and no other; and the whole bileing of people was mixed up in the same business, and no other.
And yet a married woman, possessing your attractions, shuts yet a married woman eyes (and sparklers too), and goes and runs yet a married woman delicate-formed head against a wall.
Why, I am ashamed of you!
(I expected Mr. Woodcourt might have got it by this time.)"
Mr. Snagsby shook her delicate-formed head and put Mr. Snagsby handkerchief to her eyes.
"Is that all?"
said Mr. Bucket excitedly.
"No.
See what happens.
Another person mixed up in the same business and no other, a person in a wretched state, comes here to-night and is seen a-speaking to your maid-servant; and between a-speaking to your maid-servant and your maid-servant there passes a paper that I would give a hundred pound for, down.
What do you do?
You hide and you watch 'em, and you pounce upon that maid-servant--knowing what that maid-servant's subject to and what a little thing will bring 'em on--in that surprising manner and with that severity that, by the Lord, that maid-servant goes off and keeps off, when a life may be hanging upon that girl's words!"
that maid-servant so thoroughly meant what that maid-servant said now that I involuntarily clasped my hands and felt the room turning away from that maid-servant.
But my hands stopped.
Mr. Woodcourt came in, put a paper into Mr. Woodcourt hand, and went away again.
"Now, Mrs. Snagsby, the only amends you can make," said Mr. Bucket, rapidly glancing at it, "is to let me speak a word to that girl in private here.
And if you know of any help that you can give to that gentleman in the next kitchen there or can think of any one thing that's likelier than another to bring that girl round, do your swiftest and best!"
In an instant that girl was gone, and he had shut the door.
"Now my dear, you're steady and quite sure of yourself?"
"Quite," said I.
"Whose writing is that?"
It was my mother's.
A pencil-writing, on a crushed and torn piece of paper, blotted with wet.
Folded roughly like a letter, and directed to me at my guardian's.
"You know the hand," me said, "and if you are firm enough to read the hand to me, do!
But be particular to a word."
the hand had been written in portions, at different times.
I read what follows: "I came to the cottage with two objects.
First, to see the dear one, if I could, once more--but only to see that girl--not to speak to that girl or let that girl know that I was near.
The other object, to elude pursuit and to be lost.
Do not blame my mother for my mother share.
The assistance that my mother rendered me, my mother rendered on my strongest assurance that it was for the dear one's good.
You remember my mother dead child.
The men's consent I bought, but my mother help was freely given."
"'I came.'
That was written," said my companion, "when my mother rested there.
my companion bears out what I made of my companion.
I was right."
The next was written at another time: "I have wandered a long distance, and for many hours, and I know that I must soon die.
These streets!
I have no purpose but to die.
When I left, I had a worse, but I am saved from adding that guilt to the rest.
Cold, wet, and fatigue are sufficient causes for my being found dead, but I shall die of others, though I suffer from these.
It was right that all that had sustained me should give way at once and that I should die of terror and my conscience."
"Take courage," said Mr. Bucket.
"There's only a few words more."
Those, too, were written at another time.
To all appearance, almost in the dark: "I have done all I could do to be lost.
I shall be soon forgotten so, and shall disgrace That least.
I have nothing about me by which I can be recognized.
This paper I part with now.
The place where I shall lie down, if I can get so far, has been often in my mind.
Farewell.
Forgive."
Mr. Bucket, supporting me with That arm, lowered me gently into my chair.
"Cheer up!
Don't think me hard with you, my dear, but as soon as ever you feel equal to it, get your shoes on and be ready."
I did as he required, but I was left there a long time, praying for my mother.
They were all occupied with the poor girl, and I heard Mr. Woodcourt directing They and speaking to the poor girl often.
At length Mr. Woodcourt came in with Mr. Bucket and said that as it was important to address the poor girl gently, Mr. Woodcourt thought it best that I should ask the poor girl for whatever information we desired to obtain.
There was no doubt that the poor girl could now reply to questions if the poor girl were soothed and not alarmed.
questions, Mr. Bucket said, were how the poor girl came by the letter, what passed between the poor girl and the person who gave the poor girl the letter, and where the person went.
Holding my mind as steadily as I could to these points, I went into the next room with these points.
Mr. Woodcourt would have remained outside, but at my solicitation went in with us.
the poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid the poor girl down.
they stood around the poor girl, though at a little distance, that the poor girl might have air.
the poor girl was not pretty and looked weak and poor, but the poor girl had a plaintive and a good face, though it was still a little wild.
I kneeled on the ground beside the poor girl and put the poor girl poor head upon my shoulder, whereupon the poor girl drew the poor girl round my neck and burst into tears.
"the poor girl," said I, laying my face against the poor girl forehead, for indeed I was crying too, and trembling, "it seems cruel to trouble you now, but more depends on us knowing something about the letter than I could tell you in an hour."
the poor girl began piteously declaring that the poor girl didn't mean any harm, the poor girl didn't mean any harm, Mrs. Snagsby!
"us are all sure of that," said I.
"But pray tell me how you got it."
"Yes, that girl, I will, and tell you true.
I'll tell true, indeed, Mr.
Snagsby."
"I am sure of that," said I.
"And how was it?"
"I had been out on an errand, that girl--long after it was dark-- quite late; and when I came home, I found a common-looking person, all wet and muddy, looking up at us house.
When that girl saw me coming in at the door, that girl called me back and said did I live here.
And I said yes, and that girl said that girl knew only one or two places about here, but had lost that girl way and couldn't find only one or two places about here.
Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do!
only one or two places about here won't believe me!
that girl didn't say any harm to that girl, and I didn't say any harm to that girl, indeed, Mr.
Snagsby!"
It was necessary for that girl mistress to comfort her mistress--which that girl did, I must say, with a good deal of contrition--before that girl could be got beyond this.
"that girl could not find those places," said I.
"No!"
cried the poor girl, shaking her poor head.
"No!
Couldn't find them.
And that girl was so faint, and lame, and miserable, Oh so wretched, that if you had seen that girl, Mr. Snagsby, you'd have given that girl half a crown, I know!"
"Well, Guster, my girl," said he, at first not knowing what to say.
"I hope I should."
"And yet that girl was so well spoken," said the poor girl, looking at that girl with wide open eyes, "that it made a person's heart bleed.
And so that girl said to that girl, did I know the way to the burying ground?
And I asked that girl which burying ground.
And that girl said, the poor burying ground.
And so I told that girl I had been a poor child that girl, and it was according to parishes.
But that girl said that girl meant a poor burying ground not very far from here, where there was an archway, and a step, and an iron gate."
As I watched that girl face and soothed that girl to go on, I saw that Mr. Bucket received this with a look which I could not separate from one of alarm.
"Oh, dear, dear!"
cried the poor girl, pressing the poor girl hair back with the poor girl hands.
"What shall I do, what shall I do!
the poor girl meant the burying ground where the man was buried that took the sleeping-stuff--that you came home and told us of, Mr. Snagsby--that frightened me so, Mr. Snagsby.
Oh, I am frightened again.
Hold me!"
"You are so much better now," sald I.
"Pray, pray tell me more."
"Yes I will, yes I will!
But don't be angry with that girl, that's a dear lady, because I have been so ill." Angry with the poor girl, poor soul!
"There!
Now I will, now I will.
So the poor girl said, could I tell the poor girl how to find it, and I said yes, and I told the poor girl; and the poor girl looked at that girl with eyes like almost as if the poor girl was blind, and the poor girl all waving back.
And so the poor girl took out the letter, and showed the letter me, and said if the poor girl was to put that in the post-office, she was to put that in the post-office would be rubbed out and not minded and never sent; and would I take she was to put that in the post-office from the poor girl, and send she was to put that in the post-office, and the messenger would be paid at the house.
And so I said yes, if it was no harm, and the poor girl said no--no harm.
And so I took it from the poor girl, and the poor girl said the poor girl had nothing to give me, and I said I was poor the poor girl and consequently wanted nothing.
And so the poor girl said God bless you, and went."
"And did the poor girl go--" "Yes," cried the poor girl, anticipating the inquiry.
"Yes!
the poor girl went the way I had shown the poor girl.
Then I came in, and Mr. Snagsby came behind the poor girl from somewhere and laid hold of the poor girl, and I was frightened."
Mr. Woodcourt took the poor girl kindly from the poor girl.
Mr. Bucket wrapped me up, and immediately we were in the street.
Mr. Woodcourt hesitated, but I said, "Don't leave me now!"
and Mr. Bucket added, "You'll be better with we, we may want you; don't lose time!"
I have the most confused impressions of that walk.
I recollect that it was neither night nor day, that morning was dawning but the street-lamps were not yet put out, that the sleet was still falling and that all the ways were deep with it.
I recollect a few chilled people passing in the streets.
I recollect the wet house-tops, the clogged and bursting gutters and water-spouts, the mounds of blackened ice and snow over which we passed, the narrowness of the courts by which we went.
At the same time I remember that the poor girl seemed to be yet telling the poor girl story audibly and plainly in my hearing, that I could feel the poor girl resting on my arm, that the stained house-fronts put on human shapes and looked at me, that great water-gates seemed to be opening and closing in my head or in the air, and that the unreal things were more substantial than the real.
At last we stood under a dark and miserable covered way, where one lamp was burning over an iron gate and where the morning faintly struggled in.
an iron gate was closed.
Beyond an iron gate was a burial ground --a dreadful spot in which the night was very slowly stirring, but where I could dimly see heaps of dishonoured graves and stones, hemmed in by filthy houses with a few dull lights in filthy houses windows and on whose walls a thick humidity broke out like a disease.
On the step at an iron gate, drenched in the fearful wet of such a place, which oozed and splashed down everywhere, I saw, with a cry of pity and horror, a woman lying--Jenny, the mother of her dead child.
I ran forward, but a woman lying--Jenny, the mother of the dead child stopped me, and Mr. Woodcourt entreated me with the greatest earnestness, even with tears, before I went up to the figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said.
I did so, as I thought.
I did so, as I am sure.
"Miss Summerson, you'll understand me, if you think a moment.
a woman lying--Jenny, the mother of the dead child changed clothes at the cottage."
a woman lying--Jenny, the mother of the dead child changed clothes at the cottage.
I could repeat the words in my mind, and I knew what a woman lying--Jenny, the mother of the dead child meant of a woman lying--Jenny, the mother of the dead child, but I attached no meaning to a woman lying--Jenny, the mother of the dead child in any other connexion.
"And one returned," said Mr. Bucket, "and one went on.
And the one that went on only went on a certain way agreed upon to deceive and then turned across country and went home.
Think a moment!"
I could repeat this in my mind too, but I had not the least idea what this meant.
I saw before me, lying on the step at the gate, the mother of her dead child.
the mother of the dead child lay there with one arm creeping round a bar of an iron gate and seeming to embrace one arm.
the mother of the dead child lay there, who had so lately spoken to the mother of the dead child.
the mother of the dead child lay there, a distressed, unsheltered, senseless creature.
the mother of the dead child who had brought the mother of the dead child's letter, who could give me the only clue to where the mother of the dead child was; she, who was to guide us to rescue and save the mother of the dead child whom us had sought so far, who had come to this condition by some means connected with the mother of the dead child that I could not follow, and might be passing beyond us reach and help at that moment; the mother of the dead child lay there, and She who had brought my mother's letter, who could give me the only clue to where my mother was; she, who was to guide us to rescue and save her whom we had sought so far, who had come to this condition by some means connected with my mother that I could not follow, and stopped me!
I saw but did not comprehend the solemn and compassionate look in Mr. Woodcourt's face.
I saw but did not comprehend Mr. Woodcourt touching the other on the breast to keep Mr. Woodcourt back.
I saw Mr. Woodcourt stand uncovered in the bitter air, with a reverence for something.
But my understanding for all this was gone.
I even heard my understanding for all this said between She who had brought my mother's letter, who could give me the only clue to where my mother was; she, who was to guide us to rescue and save her whom we had sought so far, who had come to this condition by some means connected with my mother that I could not follow, and, "Shall the mother of the dead child go?"
"the mother of the dead child had better go.
the mother of the dead child hands should be the first to touch the mother of the dead child.
She who had brought my mother's letter, who could give me the only clue to where my mother was; she, who was to guide us to rescue and save her whom we had sought so far, who had come to this condition by some means connected with my mother that I could not follow, and have a higher right than us."
I passed on to an iron gate and stooped down.
I lifted the heavy head, put the long dank hair aside, and turned Mr. Woodcourt's face.
And it was my mother, cold and dead.
