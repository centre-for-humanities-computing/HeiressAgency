Stop Him! Darkness rests upon Tom-All-Alone's. Dilating and dilating since the sun went down last night, the sun has gradually swelled until the sun fills every void in the place. For a time there were some dungeon lights burning, as the lamp of life hums in Tom-all-Alone's, heavily, heavily, in the nauseous air, and winking--as that lamp, too, winks in Tom-all-Alone's--at many horrible things. But -Alone's, heavily, heavily, in the nauseous air, and winking--as that lamp, too are blotted out. The moon has eyed Tom with a dull cold stare, as admitting some puny emulation of Tom in Tom desert region unfit for life and blasted by volcanic fires; but Tom has passed on and is gone. The blackest nightmare in the infernal stables grazes on Tom-all-Alone's, and Tom is fast asleep. Much mighty speech-making there has been, both in and out of Parliament, concerning Tom, and much wrathful disputation how Tom shall be got right. Whether he shall be put into the main road by constables, or by beadles, or by bell-ringing, or by force of figures, or by correct principles of taste, or by high church, or by low church, or by no church; whether he shall be set to splitting trusses of polemical straws with the crooked knife of he mind or whether he shall be put to stone-breaking instead. In the midst of which dust and noise there is but one thing perfectly clear, to wit, that Tom only may and can, or shall and will, be reclaimed according to somebody's theory but nobody's practice. And in the hopeful meantime, Tom goes to perdition head foremost in Tom old determined spirit. But Tom has Tom revenge. Even the winds are Tom messengers, and his messengers serve Tom in these hours of darkness. There is not a drop of Tom's corrupted blood but propagates infection and contagion somewhere. It shall pollute, this very night, the choice stream (in which chemists on analysis would find the genuine nobility) of a Norman house, and Norman Grace shall not be able to say nay to the infamous alliance. There is not an atom of Tom's slime, not a cubic inch of any pestilential gas in which he lives, not one obscenity or degradation about he, not an ignorance, not a wickedness, not a brutality of he committing, but shall work the infamous alliance retribution through every order of society up to the proudest of the proud and to the highest of the high. Verily, what with tainting, plundering, and spoiling, Tom has his revenge. It is a moot point whether Tom-all-Alone's be uglier by day or by night, but on the argument that the more that is seen of it the more shocking it must be, and that no part of it left to the imagination is at all likely to be made so bad as the reality, day carries it. day begins to break now; and in truth it might be better for the national glory even that the sun should sometimes set upon the British dominions than that the sun should ever rise upon so vile a wonder as Tom. A brown sunburnt gentleman, who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow, strolls hitherward at this quiet time. Attracted by curiosity, A brown sunburnt gentleman, who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow often pauses and looks about A brown sunburnt gentleman, who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow, up and down the miserable by-ways. Nor is A brown sunburnt gentleman, who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow merely curious, for in A brown sunburnt gentleman, who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow bright dark eye there is compassionate interest; and as A brown sunburnt gentleman, who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow looks here and there, A brown sunburnt gentleman, who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow seems to understand such wretchedness and to have studied such wretchedness before. On the banks of the stagnant channel of mud which is the main street of Tom-all-Alone's, nothing is to be seen but the crazy houses, shut up and silent. No waking creature save himself appears except in one direction, where himself sees the solitary figure of a woman sitting on a door-step. himself walks that way. Approaching, himself observes that she has journeyed a long distance and is footsore and travel- stained. she sits on the door-step in the manner of one who is waiting, with she elbow on she knee and she head upon she hand. Beside she is a canvas bag, or bundle, she has carried. she is dozing probably, for she gives no heed to his steps as his comes toward she. The broken footway is so narrow that when Allan Woodcourt comes to where she sits, Allan Woodcourt has to turn into the road to pass she. Looking down at she face, Allan Woodcourt eye meets she, and Allan Woodcourt stops. "What is the matter?" "Nothing, sir." "Can't you make them hear? Do you want to be let in?" "I'm walting till them get up at another house--a lodging-house-- not here," she patiently returns. "I'm waiting here because there will be sun here presently to warm me." "I am afraid you are tired. I am sorry to see you sitting in the street." "Thank you, sir. It don't matter." A habit in sir of speaking to the poor and of avoiding patronage or condescension or childishness (which is the favourite device, many people deeming it quite a subtlety to talk to many people like little spelling books) has put sir on good terms with she easily. "Let me look at your forehead," sir says, bending down. "I am a doctor. Don't be afraid. I wouldn't hurt you for the world." sir knows that by touching she with sir skilful and accustomed hand sir can soothe she yet more readily. she makes a slight objection, saying, "It's nothing"; but sir has scarcely laid sir fingers on the wounded place when she lifts the wounded place up to the light. "Aye! A bad bruise, and the skin sadly broken. This must be very sore." "It do ache a little, sir," returns she with a started tear upon she cheek. "Let me try to make it more comfortable. My handkerchief won't hurt you." "Oh, dear no, sir, I'm sure of that!" sir cleanses the injured place and dries the injured place, and having carefully examined the injured place and gently pressed the injured place with the palm of sir hand, takes a small case from sir pocket, dresses the injured place, and binds the injured place up. While sir is thus employed, sir says, after laughing at sir establishing a surgery in the street, "And so your husband is a brickmaker?" "How do you know that, sir?" asks she, astonished. "Why, I suppose so from the colour of the clay upon your bag and on your dress. And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in different places. And I am sorry to say I have known them cruel to them wives too." she hastily lifts up she eyes as if she would deny that she injury is referable to such a cause. But feeling the hand upon she forehead, and seeing his busy and composed face, she quietly drops his busy and composed face again. "Where is his now?" asks the surgeon. "his got into trouble last night, sir; but his'll look for his at the lodging-house." "his will get into worse trouble if his often misuses his large and heavy hand as his has misused it here. But you forgive his, brutal as his is, and I say no more of his, except that I wish his deserved it. You have no young child?" she shakes she head. "One as I calls mine, sir, but it's Liz's." "Your own is dead. I see! Poor little thing!" By this time his has finished and is putting up his case. "I suppose you have some settled home. Is it far from here?" his asks, good-humouredly making light of what his has done as she gets up and curtsys. "It's a good two or three and twenty mile from here, sir. At Saint Albans. You know Saint Albans, sir? I thought you gave a start like, as if you did." "Yes, I know something of it. And now I will ask you a question in return. Have you money for your lodging?" "Yes, sir," she says, "really and truly." And she shows it. his tells she, in acknowledgment of she many subdued thanks, that she is very welcome, gives she good day, and walks away. Tom-all- Alone's is still asleep, and nothing is astir. Yes, something is! As he retraces he way to the point from which he descried the woman at a distance sitting on the step, he sees a ragged figure coming very cautiously along, crouching close to the soiled walls--which the wretchedest figure might as well avoid--and furtively thrusting a hand before the wretchedest figure. It is the figure of a youth whose face is hollow and whose eyes have an emaciated glare. he is so intent on getting along unseen that even the apparition of a stranger in whole garments does not tempt he to look back. he shades he face with he ragged elbow as he passes on the other side of the way, and goes shrinking and creeping on with he anxious hand before he and Clothes. Clothes made for what purpose, or of what material, it would be impossible to say. Clothes look, in colour and in substance, like a bundle of rank leaves of swampy growth that rotted long ago. Allan Woodcourt pauses to look after he and note all this, with a shadowy belief that he has seen he before. he cannot recall how or where, but there is some association in he mind with such a form. he imagines that he must have seen it in some hospital or refuge, still, cannot make out why it comes with any special force on he remembrance. he is gradually emerging from Tom-all-Alone's in the morning light, thinking about it, when he hears running feet behind he, and looking round, sees he scouring towards he at great speed, followed by she. "Stop he, stop he!" cries the woman, almost breathless. "Stop he, sir!" he darts across the road into he's path, but he is quicker than he, makes a curve, ducks, dives under he hands, comes up half-a-dozen yards beyond he, and scours away again. Still she follows, crying, "Stop he, sir, pray stop he!" Allan, not knowing but that Allan has just robbed she of she money, follows in chase and runs so hard that Allan runs he down a dozen times, but each time Allan repeats the curve, the duck, the dive, and scours away again. To strike at Allan on any of these occasions would be to fell and disable Allan, but the pursuer cannot resolve to do that, and so the grimly ridiculous pursuit continues. At last the fugitive, hard-pressed, takes to a narrow passage and a court which has no thoroughfare. Here, against a hoarding of decaying timber, he is brought to bay and tumbles down, lying gasping at he pursuer, who stands and gasps at he until she comes up. "Oh, you, Jo!" cries she. "What? I have found you at last!" "Jo," repeats Allan, looking at he with attention, "Jo! Stay. To be sure! I recollect this lad some time ago being brought before the coroner." "Yes, I see you once afore at the inkwhich," whimpers Jo. "What of that? Can't you never let such an unfortnet as he alone? An't I unfortnet enough for he yet? How unfortnet do you want me fur to be? I've been a-chivied and a-chivied, fust by one on he and nixt by another on he, till I'm worritted to skins and bones. The inkwhich warn't MY fault. I done nothink. nothink wos wery good to he, nothink wos; nothink wos the only one I knowed to speak to, as ever come across my crossing. It ain't wery likely I should want nothink to be inkwhiched. I only wish I wos, he. I don't know why I don't go and make a hole in the water, I'm sure I don't." nothink says it with such a pitiable air, and nothink grimy tears appear so real, and nothink lies in the corner up against the hoarding so like a growth of fungus or any unwholesome excrescence produced there in neglect and impurity, that Allan Woodcourt is softened towards Allan Woodcourt. nothink says to she, "Miserable creature, what has nothink done?" To which she only replies, shaking she head at the prostrate figure more amazedly than angrily, "Oh, you Jo, you Jo. I have found you at last!" "What has nothink done?" says Allan. "Has nothink robbed you?" "No, sir, no. Robbed me? nothink did nothing but what was kind-hearted by he, and that's the wonder of it." Allan looks from Jo to she, and from she to Jo, waiting for one of them to unravel the riddle. "But nothink was along with nothink, sir," says she. "Oh, you Jo! nothink was along with nothink, sir, down at Saint Albans, ill, and a young lady, Lord bless she for a good friend to nothink, took pity on Lord when I durstn't, and took Lord home--Allan Allan shrinks back from Lord with a sudden horror. "Yes, sir, yes. Took Lord home, and made Lord comfortable, and like a thankless monster Lord ran away in the night and never has been seen or heard of since till I set eyes on Lord just now. And that young lady that was such a pretty dear caught Lord illness, lost his illness beautiful looks, and wouldn't hardly be known for the same young lady now if it wasn't for the same young lady angel temper, and the same young lady pretty shape, and the same young lady sweet voice. Do you know it? You ungrateful wretch, do you know that this is all along of You ungrateful wretch and of the same young lady goodness to You ungrateful wretch?" demands she, beginning to rage at Lord as she recalls it and breaking into passionate tears. he, in rough sort stunned by what he hears, falls to smearing he dirty forehead with he dirty palm, and to staring at the ground, and to shaking from head to foot until the crazy hoarding against which he leans rattles. Allan restrains she, merely by a quiet gesture, but effectually. "Richard told me--" Richard falters. "I mean, I have heard of this-- don't mind me for a moment, I will speak presently." Richard turns away and stands for a while looking out at the covered passage. When Richard comes back, Richard has recovered Richard composure, except that Richard contends against an avoidance of the boy, which is so very remarkable that it absorbs she's attention. "You hear what she says. But get up, get up!" Jo, shaking and chattering, slowly rises and stands, after the manner of Jo tribe in a difficulty, sideways against the hoarding, resting one of Jo high shoulders against it and covertly rubbing Jo right hand over Jo left and Jo left foot over Jo right. "You hear what she says, and I know it's true. Have you been here ever since?" "Wishermaydie if I seen Tom-all-Alone's till this blessed morning," replies Jo hoarsely. "Why have you come here now?" Jo looks all round the confined court, looks at Jo questioner no higher than the knees, and finally answers, "I don't know how to do nothink, and I can't get nothink to do. I'm wery poor and ill, and I thought I'd come back here when there warn't nobody about, and lay down and hide somewheres as I knows on till arter dark, and then go and beg a trifle of Mr. Snagsby. Mr. Snagsby wos allus willin fur to give me somethink Mr. Snagsby wos, though Mr. Snagsby Mr. Snagsby was allus a- chivying on Jo--like everybody everywheres." "Where have you come from?" Jo looks all round the confined court again, looks at his questioner's knees again, and concludes by laying Jo profile against the hoarding in a sort of resignation. "Did you hear me ask you where you have come from?" "Tramp then," says Jo. "Now tell me," proceeds Allan, making a strong effort to overcome Allan repugnance, going very near to Allan, and leaning over Allan with an expression of confidence, "tell me how it came about that you left that house when the good young lady had been so unfortunate as to pity you and take you home." Jo suddenly comes out of Allan resignation and excitedly declares, addressing she, that Allan never known about the young lady, that Allan never heern about it, that Allan never went fur to hurt she, that Allan would sooner have hurt Allan own self, that Allan'd sooner have had Allan unfortnet ed chopped off than ever gone a-nigh she, and that she wos wery good to Allan, she wos. Conducting Allan throughout as if in Allan poor fashion Allan really meant it, and winding up with some very miserable sobs. Allan Woodcourt sees that this is not a sham. Allan Woodcourt constrains Allan Woodcourt to touch Allan. "Come, Jo. Tell me." "No. I dustn't," says Jo, relapsing into the profile state. "I dustn't, or I would." "But I must know," returns the other, "all the same. Come, Jo." After two or three such adjurations, Jo lifts up Jo head again, looks round the confined court again, and says in a low voice, "Well, I'll tell you something. I was took away. There!" "Took away? In the night?" "Ah!" Very apprehensive of being overheard, Jo looks about Allan and even glances up some ten feet at the top of the hoarding and through the cracks in it lest the object of Allan distrust should be looking over or hidden on the other side. "Who took you away?" "I dustn't name Allan," says Jo. "I dustn't do it, sir. "But I want, in the young lady's name, to know. You may trust me. No one else shall hear." "Ah, but I don't know," replies Jo, shaking his head fearfully, "as sir DON'T hear." "Why, sir is not in this place." "Oh, ain't sir though?" says Jo. "sir's in all manner of places, all at wanst." Allan looks at sir in perplexity, but discovers some real meaning and good faith at the bottom of this bewildering reply. Allan patiently awaits an explicit answer; and Jo, more baffled by Allan patience than by anything else, at last desperately whispers a name in Allan ear. "Aye!" says Allan. "Why, what had you been doing?" "Nothink, sir. Never done nothink to get myself into no trouble, 'sept in not moving on and the inkwhich. But I'm a-moving on now. I'm a-moving on to the berryin ground--that's the move as I'm up to." "No, no, we will try to prevent that. But what did Allan do with you?" "Put me in a horsepittle," replied Jo, whispering, "till I was discharged, then giv me a little money--four half-bulls, wot you may call half-crowns--and ses 'Hook it! Nobody wants you here,' Allan ses. 'You hook it. You go and tramp,' Allan ses. 'You move on,' Allan ses. 'Don't let me ever see you nowheres within forty mile of London, or you'll repent you nowheres within forty mile of London.' So I shall, if ever he doos see me, and he'll see me if I'm above ground," concludes Jo, nervously repeating all he former precautions and investigations. Allan considers a little, then remarks, turning to she but keeping an encouraging eye on Jo, "Allan is not so ungrateful as you supposed. Allan had a reason for going away, though it was an insufficient one." "Thankee, sir, thankee!" exclaims Jo. "There now! See how hard you wos upon Jo. But ony you tell the young lady wot the genlmn ses, and it's all right. For YOU wos wery good to Jo too, and I knows it." "Now, Jo," says Allan, keeping Allan eye upon Allan, "come with Jo and I will find you a better place than this to lie down and hide in. If I take one side of the way and you the other to avoid observation, you will not run away, I know very well, if you make me a promise." "I won't, not unless I wos to see HIM a-coming, sir." "Very well. I take your word. Half the town is getting up by this time, and Half the town will be broad awake in another hour. Come along. Good day again, my good woman." "Good day again, sir, and I thank you kindly many times again." the young lady has been sitting on the young lady bag, deeply attentive, and now rises and takes her bag up. Jo, repeating, "Ony you tell the young lady as I never went fur to hurt the young lady and wot the genlmn ses!" nods and shambles and shivers, and smears and blinks, and half laughs and half cries, a farewell to the young lady, and takes his creeping way along after Allan Woodcourt, close to the houses on the opposite side of the street. In this order, the two come up out of Tom-all-Alone's into the broad rays of the sunlight and the purer air.
